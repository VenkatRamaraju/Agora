"An article from May 2021 giving more color on XR Optics.Dr Welch commented that any acceleration of general availability will all depend on how strongly network owners embrace hub-spoke topologies and initial unit volumes, starting in 2022. I remember him expecting XR Optics to apply mainly to upgrading existing hub-spoke installations and admitting that there will be a lot of inertia against point-to-point making the conversion. That was before they announced that XR Optics would be compatible with conventional point-to-point pluggables so network owners would be faced with condensing only one end of their existing aggregation footprints. eetimesDOTcom/xr-optics-trains-spotlight-back-on-fiber-networks/#replace DOT with ."

"Hello, new to the board but long time telecom engineer. Love Infinera in the network. Recent low price was too attractive to pass. Got in with 10k at $4.65. Will average down if possible. Hopefully a good long entry."
"Infinera should be announcing their Q3 quarterly earnings reporting date early next week. - Q3 revenue relative to guidance $340M - $370M- Q4 guidance- visibility on chip shortage -- currently affecting about 2% of the parts they purchase-- represents about 1% to 1.5% hit to margins for Q3, short term-- averaging $15M delivery delay per quarter accumulating (including Q3 effect: $45M - $50M deferred revenue pushed into backlog expected to be delivered in 1H2022)- ICE6 wins------------------------optional topics:- XR Optics progress (XR Forum)as of Q2 XR Forum membership represents ""significant"" share of service provider CapEx spendingas of Q2 conducted 30 XR trials/demos- any additional ICE6 system development statusI keep on waiting for a DTN-X linecard, to capture those easy sales into their significant installed footprint- any additional progress on next generation 1.6T engineno rush there except to match up with Acacia's ac1200sc2 news Cisco keeps on touting"
"Looks like Ray Milano and Glen Laxdal (last name by memory) are no longer on Management page. Ray was Senior VP Optical Module Group. Also, looks like Rob Shore jumped up a few spots in the stature ranking."
Every August is terrible for this trading stock. It's like clockwork.
"OT: Apollo Group has been showing up in the telecom space acquiring portions of public companies. Interesting what they're intending with those disparate pieces. Maybe just spruce them up and sell, unlike our favorite Marlin Equities mashup of Sycamore/Tellabs/NSM = Coriant- Verizon Media (previously Yahoo) deal closed out- ILEC operations in 20 states to be acquired from Lumen- $200M investment in First Digital TelecomJust musing if OakTree/Brookfield will be much of an active shareholder with their one seat on Infinera's BOD and 12% or so common stock stake along with any portion of Infinera Notes they might have picked up, as well.This private equity stuff is way over my head and sometimes seems somewhat slippery in how they say they create value in so many different sectors."
"$8.42 gap filled today. Up on solid volume, especially in the last few minutes of the day…all this despite the market eating a few punches today. Today is the first time in 7 trading days I felt the volume spikes throughout the day were buyers stepping up(yeah, obviously someone is selling)."
Back to the $8's tomorrow. Meanwhile CIEN is close to a 52 week high. I guess CIEN make all their key components and the INFN's Purchasing Depertment is working 24/7 and is waiting 50 weeks for parts they pay 2-3x more. INFN is now a 2H22' story maybe. Be surprised if we see $10 again this year. Hope I'm wrong but history says different. Keep reading my posts. Keep those thumbs down coming.
"Infinera today dropping below 50/100/200 DMA bottom of envelopes. Last time stock most recently behaved this way was on 03/16/2020 and 05/14/2020 where it subsequently rebounded by the following two weeks above those DMA top of envelope, currently above $10.One day, their guidance needs some high five wins to step function spice things up."
"CIena share price in 2021 has been bouncing between 50-58, touching 60 for a bit. Sliding the last week or so. At today's $54.50 range, P/E of 18.5 no growth, Hold. ADTN/ADVA merger closing in mid 2022 is positioning to benefit from anticipated big surge in optical system sales and will put them close to the same range revenue-wise with Infinera/Coriant/Transmode.Stocks in this hardware sector either waiting for or getting in position for the next big wave."
Open XR Forum site still only shows original six. It would not surprise me if we see several additions all at once prior to the CC. I don’t mean to wind up SharkBait but it would be nice if Infinera can move up their reporting by one week.
CEO comments leading off the EC quite positive...revenue could have been $35 mill higher. Interested in the analysts' questions. These cats may be finally turning the corner. 800 Gig biz is taking hold.
"Jeff, I believe it was you who made the point a few months ago that the Q2 and Q3 CC’s are important in terms of what we here. If it was you I am curious what you thought of Q2. Thanks, Joe."
"Excellent. Strong revenues, beat estimates, and now nicely profitable: Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $6.4 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $(30.5) million, or $(0.17) per share, in the third quarter of 2019, and $(44.3) million, or $(0.25) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2018. Headed toward $14 per share."
Will probably bounce off of 8.50 again.
They can't get the phone number right on their press release. i called 866-373-6878 per the PR and they said they no longer host calls for Infinera. LOL
"$15M to $20M/quarter accumulated delays in shipments due to parts shortages.Flush of this $60M or so in delayed shipments not until 2022.Yeah it's always something with this company, this time again from an external reason.For their part, Supply Chain got caught flat footed."

"Article at FierceTelecom, ""ADVA, Infinera post Q4 revenue declines""Writer with respect to Infinera later clarified in the article that the decline he was referring to was YoY... 4Q2020 vs 4Q2019 due to drag from COVID.End of article mentions that industry research experts predict optical transport (network)-related revenues should continue to rise through 2025.Infinera is well positioned to benefit from the 4-year run, barring any US or world economic upsets.Hopefully it starts now, in 1Q2021."
PR this morning with Sparkle for ICE6.
"I thought it was a good quarter. All the numbers and margins were solid. I read a lot of good comments here and perhaps the only things I didn’t see or at least not emphasized: * the quarter was negatively impacted by supply chain and COVID by $5M. * book to bill ratio for the year is over 1 * there was no budget flush in Q4. It seems as though Heard is determined to be conservative, particularly in the first half with Covid related supply chain issues in play. I thought he did a nice job on the call.On the downside it appears 2021 topline will only grow about 5% YoY. They did not say this, rather it is my fuzzy math based on what they said about market growth and their place in the market. Prior to the call I was hoping for 10% topline growth. This is only my second CC with them so I don’t have the same old Infinera bad taste in my mouth...they seem upbeat about their products in comparison to competition."
"Usually it's not good to put much attention to the total quantity of Infinera's ""opportunities"" and ""trials"" ... below, a few more bullets from one of their Stifel Powerpoint presentation charts- Groove: 30 new customers, bookings grew 40% QoQ and 400% YoY, strong trial demand for our 600G (DCI)- DRX: 4 deployment wins, 8 trials at several T1 operators (disaggregated solutions)- Transcend: 4 new customers, including major win at VZ, 10 on-going trials and 25+ open opportunities (Coriant SDN software)- ICE4: strong growth in subsea business with continued leadership in key optical performance areas------------------------------It's too bad that they had to shelve ICE5 efforts. Offering four channels of 600G would have been the highest density for DCI and moderate distance Metro routes. ICE6 with two channels of 800G will cover all of the shorter distance applications. Perhaps they are accelerating adding a couple more channels to the module as well, to overmatch ICE5 in all aspects."
Just bought another 4000 shares at 5.06. Still feel that we are near a point where the stock will make me some money in the next few quarters.
"According to their conference call viewgraphs:Q1 Revenue: YoY, By Vertical: % up from Tier 1's and ICP's, down from Cable and ""Other Service Providers"" YoY, By Region: % up in North/South America, flat in Asia and other Americas, down in EMEAQ2 Revenue guidance, flat to down sequentially from Q1---------------------------------------------------ICE6 800G coming out in 2H2020 caused some concern from analysts about what will happen to Groove 30 600G sales. The way they fanned out their Groove product family out to 4 systems, it looks like they anticipate 600G and 800G to sell in parallel rather than cannibalize sales. 800G will be in their larger Groove chassis. It looks like their legacy Groove 30 remains unchanged as a 600G sled platform and they've added a scaled down Groove 25 with simpler Customer-side options."
"New position in INFN today.LITE has regained its footing on charts. As the leader . This industry GOES as LITE goes. Additionally Telecom Infrastructure was among top perf industries today, otherwise a fairly quiet session . With 24mm+ shares still short, sizeable % of float . I can’t see that short int not Motivated to cover fairly aggressively here. Above all the chart has bottomed now . And from fundamentals"
"For those who make up the 25 million shares currently short, it could get very costly for them when INFN again goes over $20 per share."
INFN will state they are doing great.They have a great product line.They have a ton of interested parties.The future looks brightBut today...... is anyone giving them money today.Not really.stock goes to 7.35
"Ciena call regarding future sales growth:Jeff KvaalOkay. Okay. Great, great, great. And then let me follow that up by asking, is it possible that 1 day that you'll get back to talking about that 6% to 8% long-term sales growth?Jim MoylanWe’re going to revisit the issue of long-term guidance as we turn the year. We’ve been through an incredibly dynamic period in our market with all sorts of behavioral changes on the part of our customers and with good reason, of course. And that caused us to suspend our 3-year guide. Although I would say this, remember, we just – we did talk about the future as we began this year. We said that we still expected the market to grow in the low to mid-single digits overall, and we expected to take share in that context. We just didn’t continue that thought to give a number in terms of our revenue growth. I won’t say that we’re going to as we come into the first part of next year, but it’s certainly what we’re thinking about as we sit here today."
"INFN website shows an impressive test. Worth the read.Orange Tested Seven-core Fibre Reaching 11.2 Tb/s August 11, 2021 – In its Innovation Lab, together with Infinera and InPhoTech group, Orange Polska ran tests of innovative multi-core fibre and Infinera ICE6 800G technology. The throughput obtained during the tests is seven times greater than the maximum that can be achieved today using a standard fibre optic cable."
"Infinera Q2 guidance:- Revenue: $345M + / - $10M- Gross Margin: 35.0 - 37.0%Sounds like no rest for the weary. They're looking forward to selling their new products and accelerating development.

"We need a surprise. If Q2 revs come in toward the higher range we are looking at $347.1M. First 6 months will be $678M. The low estimate for 2021 is $1.42B. That means INFN needs to show Q3 and Q4 to average $371M. That seems pretty hefty to me, but welcome any surprise. Q3 est. needs to be at least $365M, leaving Q4 to be $377M just to hit the low range of 2021 est. GLTALReally need to see a nice jump in GPM and cash flow to keep us in the upward trajectory. I hope I am wrong but the second half needs to be better than good."
"04/01/2020: T-Mobile announces it has closed it's acquisition of Sprint.Fast forward 10+ months, the combined company might be comfortable with the housekeeping of its combined network to be able to ramp up equipment purchases. Good timing for possible entry of Infinera 800G, XR Optics, and their disaggregated solution into their Metro networks.Hope Infinera has the sales chops to capture new wins at all 3 US network owners. Their systems are definitely up to it. Price them to win and make it up with unit volumes will put expanded scrutiny on not stumbling their Supply Chain, Manufacturing, Customer Service. Hopefully no Tesla-like stumbling, if unit deliveries get to step function upwards."

"If a company schedules its earnings much earlier than normal, (3 days), then earnings are often better than expected and share price gains typically follow. = Per Guy's link."
"Earnings date probably getting announced, this week and might be too late to make it by 02/04/21 last mid-week work day. Second or third week of February, again. Hope they had a decent Q4. Guidance for a flat Q1 QoQ would be a reasonable upside for this Company. Their entire product line is still fresh or getting refreshed with 800G. Pandemic is still jamming up travel and triggering border lockdowns but telecoms starting to gear up for 5G. XR Optics going on 2 years in-development. Maybe Infinera and its partners just stretching out their costs to align with when Customers will feel like spending on the technology."
"In the US:Seems like Lumen is in the bag for GX ICE6 sales, based on a wag extrapolation from statements Joey noticed from a recent major optical conference about winning a GX deployment at a US Tier 1. It's probably lucky that monetizing some of Lumen's non-core network assets was pushed out from 2019 till now. It gave Infinera more time to get ICE6 systems generally available during a time when Ciena was purportedly putting pressure on Lumen to go with them.Doesn't seem like a Verizon decision on GX w/ICE6 has occurred yet but as someone here already pointed out, with only two 800G players plus ADVA Optical implementing Acacia AC1200 (and banned Huawei), it's probably in the bag as a 2nd source. Lumen/VZ one-two-comboWindstream announced they went with Ciena for their next generation network unification effort, with the door left open for Infinera to bid their ICE6 at some point, most likely just to upgrade their legacy DTN-X systems. Unfortunate that they made that call after being a heavy Infinera Customer going years back, but at least the door isn't closed. Add a few jabs to Ciena's gutIt would be nice if AT&T continued its past Coriant buys by jumping on GX ICE6. That should show up in the revenues as another nice slope addition and ring Ciena's bell, for once.We'll see how ICE6 punches go plus XR Optics next year can't come soon enough.Infinera talking about leaning forward on engine development... new product cadence with Ciena and Acacia never ends but at least everybody is sweating on the same uphill technology advancement road."

"Supply issues at least thru mid 2022…continue to take market share. From Ciena call:“ Within the strong demand environment, however, there remain global and industry-wide supply chain constraints. And as we have consistently proven, we have the best-in-class ability to manage through this challenge and to deliver outcomes for our customers better than anyone else in our industry. However, as we've said before, we are not immune, particularly if supply challenges persist. And as has been widely reported, good conditions have somewhat deteriorated and are posing headwinds with Ciena, including difficulty to fully address demand. We have also seen some extensions of our lead times and some increased costs.As we sit here today, we believe these challenges will likely persist through at least the middle of calendar '22. Moving to highlights from the quarter, our competitive position remains strong and we continue to take market share. ”"

Telstrahmm...........TASTY
Another 52 week high. Another year high close. The trading pattern suggests the shorts are keeping the share price in ranges to create option opportunities before they move it up to the next notch. This is a standard trade method to get out of a bad position without creating a squeeze. The retail shorts could be in big trouble if the institutions can actually acquire the options they need to safely dispose their short interests. I think this continues for another few weeks and then the shirts themselves will start the squeeze after they have the options they need. Perfect execution so far as long as the little guys do not panic on the small share price boosts every few days. I see the 8 calls as their Best Buy right now. Then a jump to 8.50 to start buying the 9s. Classic. Glad I stayed on the long side and loaded up through 2019. GLTA in the New Year. Do your DD and don’t panic or make this an easy exit for the shorts. We will see double digits before they can get out. Next earnings will be to late for them so I expect the short plan to be completely done by end of February.
"Markets moderately selling off these last few end of days... bobbing in smooth water sounds good but probably unrealistic for things to stay dead calm into next year, to give INFN a chance to get back into the low teens before any severe choppiness.End of Q3 in a couple more weeks and then wait a month to hear Q4 guidance and chip shortage status."

"Reduced inventory in 4Q2020 by $71M as they executed on a large installation that they were gearing up for in early 2020. In preparation for further relatively big contracts, we might belatedly see/hear about inventory buildup again 3-6 months ahead of deployment and revenue recognition. QoQ increase in operation expense, spent on gearing up product development and restoration of employee bonus compensation halted during COVID.Healthy sales across their product line. Some analyst concerns that sales of their Coriant GX 600G systems based on merchant modules are cannibalizing 200G ICE4-based CloudXpress. CEO commented that enjoying long sales cycle for 100G/200G1-2% growth above the market2H2021 meaningful ramp ICE6 shipments implies Coriant 600G sleds should continue to be a good revenue contributor.ICE6 GX selling now is applicable to ICP's and CSP's. Rollout to DTN-X linecards and other Infinera systems rolling out over the next 18-24 months, prioritized by market demand/readiness.ZR and ZR+ pluggables forecasted in 3 years to carve away about $800M-$900M of the $12B ICP market for DCI and other Metro systems. CEO reminded analysts that Coriant systems will be compatible with ZR and ZR+ pluggables, in addition to in-house XR Optics.It was the analyst from Northland Securities (Tim Savageaux) who had the lone negative-sounding questions: recent downturn in their sales to their best Tier 1 US Customer (implying slowly losing that Customer). CEO says large Customer purchases always fluctuate and in the meantime they are winning new opportunities with US Tier 1's. Lighter Tier-1 spending 1H2021 with conservative expectation of heavier spending in 2H2021.MKM analyst filling in or replacing Michael Genovese mentioned that Ciena has shipped 5000 800G channels to about 70 Customers, representing twice the ramp-up that they've experienced with previous speed upgrade cycles. Infinera so far has closed several orders and wins in 4Q2020 and sales are building in Q1 faster than their own previous speed upgrade cycles, as well."
"It's a bit strange to see Genovese release this sort of news on a summer Friday. I wonder if he doesn't want to be caught flat-footed if positive news is announced on, say, Monday? If there is a buyout, I only hope that they deliver a fair price, which is north of $15 a share."
"Daily volume way over double the average on a Friday with a breakout pattern? Yup, there is some good news being shared somewhere by somebody. I think it may be the paradigm shift modular approach they are taking and perhaps people are finally catching on to why their solution is a no brainer in scaling business in the future. I'll tell you what. I've rarely look forward to Mondays more than Saturdays, and this is the rare exception."
"Lumen reports on Wednesday, after the market closes. Their stock price trajectory has been weak like Infinera's for years so hopefully they can announce seeing light at the end of their tunnel and will feel more inclined to throw more capital Infinera's way, especially since the Company is cranking out ICE6.Zero announcements relating to Infinera's relationship with Lumen for quite awhile... going back to 10/01/2018 when MKM Michael Genovese claimed CenturyLink dumped them for Ciena because of doubts about whether Infinera can timely get to 800G. Lumen recently did join Infinera's XR Optics Forum, though, so maybe things are still not a problem and they're just silently populating their DTN-X racks and adding new GX 600G/800G systems, as needed. Ciena posturing to push them out has toned down. Just goes to show that Ciena maintains a relatively hostile attitude towards its competition, like there's not enough room for at least 3 players."
"While shareholders sit in Infinera's waiting room on their bed-of-nails furnishing, MKM discusses his take on Cisco's acquisition of Acacia:""... From a historic point of view, companies Cisco acquires typically ""disappear"" inside of Cisco and are merely featured within Cisco's products, Genovese said in a Tuesday note.While Cisco said it will continue supporting Acacia's customers, the history ""suggests otherwise,"" the analyst said. The deal could have ""major industry implications,"" including the potential end of the merchant Digital Signal Processing market, he said.Merchant DSP allowed tier two and tier three optical systems vendors to ""survive,"" so the deal is likely to ""severely"" weaken these vendors, Genovese said. The small handful of large optical systems companies who make their own DSPs, including Ciena, will benefit, the analyst said.Ciena stands out as a potential winner in the group, since Cisco's acquisition highlights that Acacia's 600G DCI products have ""fading prospects"" in the market, according to MKM."""

"Since the filing of the initial Schedule 13D in October 2018, the Reporting Persons have been closely monitoring developments at the Issuer and have remained constructively engaged with management and the Board of Directors (the “Board”) on a variety of matters. In recent discussions with the Issuer, the Reporting Persons communicated their strong belief that meaningful shareholder representation is immediately required on the Board in order to ensure that the Board is aligned and acting in the best interests of its shareholders. To that end, the Reporting Persons have called upon the Board to immediately appoint both a direct representative of the Reporting Persons to the Board as well as a highly-qualified independent director designee identified by the Reporting Persons. The Reporting Persons have expressed their sense of urgency regarding these matters and look forward to working with the Board towards a cooperative outcome. The Reporting Persons are optimistic that an amicable resolution with the Issuer can be promptly achieved and intend to continue their dialogue with the Board in this regard. The Reporting Persons reserve their rights to take whatever steps they believe may be required to protect and enhance shareholder value, including certain actions relating to the Issuer’s upcoming 2020 Annual Meeting, but hope any such steps will prove unnecessary."
"Excellent. Telia won a big contract in Mexico. This is great because Telia mainly uses INFN.""Gigacable to use Telia Carrier backbone to improve internet services in MexicoGigacable will use the services to enable the provision of dedicated Internet access to its residential and business customers.by Stephen Hardy, Jan 26th, 2020Network services provider Telia Carrier says it has won a contract from Mexican cable MSO Gigacable to supply IP transit and backbone services. Gigacable will use the services to enable the provision of dedicated Internet access to its residential and business customers. Gigacable also gains access to Telia Carrier’s global network by virtue of the deal.“As one of the leading broadband and cable TV service providers in Mexico, tapping into Telia Carrier’s IP backbone enables us to deliver advanced solutions and robust networks,” said Jose Alfredo Mercado, general manager of Gigacable. “Working with Telia Carrier assures both our business and consumer subscribers a direct secure connection to Internet access with lower latency as well as more capacity than they need to grow.”Telia Carrier launched services in Mexico in the Spring of 2018 (see ""Telia Carrier establishes PoP in city of Queretaro to connect Mexican providers to AS1299 backbone""). It offers wholesale IP transit, Ethernet, IPX, and Cloud Connect offerings for ISPs and content and cloud providers in the region.“We’ve seen a huge demand in Mexico for our IP Transit and Cloud Connect services, and have many customers in the region, including mobile operators, local access providers, and ISPs, amongst others,” said Luis Velasquez, Mexico business manager, Telia Carrier. “Up until recently, ISPs and operators in the region have had limited options to help them meet their subscribers’ needs. With our formidable IP backbone, Telia Carrier can directly serve those mid-size ISPs, looking for higher-bandwidth solutions that will enable them to deliver better services and cloud connectivity to the Mexican market.”"

"It seems like their upcoming Analyst/Investor Day on 05/19/2021 will be a relatively informal discussion, since there's no formal announcement at their website. Maybe local analysts and significant investors are invited to come to their San Jose HQ meeting room while they webcast and conference call Q&A to support remote participants. May be something similar to their DTN-X debut 8 years ago along with a few representatives from major Customers giving endorsements of the Company's products. Maybe Verizon this time will say GX is good stuff and their recently approved 2nd source system for 800G deployments.The Company should be making some relatively heavyweight announcements with respect to 800G and bringing more engine manufacturing in-house, at least as a parallel effort to hedge Cisco closing the Acacia purchase order counter on everybody."

"April 26, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Infinera (NASDAQ: INFN) announced today that WPD Telecoms, Western Power Distribution’s telecoms division, selected Infinera’s XTM Series metro optical platform for its high-capacity network, enabling delivery of next-generation high-speed services to its customers across South West England."
"Rough comparison of Infinera's QoQ 2021 performance with ADVA Optical Germany (in Euros, EUR).ADVA making money and is one of the other legitimate 800G players (not vertically integrated) besides Ciena2Q2021 revenue: EUR 149.4Mdiluted earnings per share EUR 0.22/shareCash EUR 79.0MDebt EUR 89.7Memployee headcount: 1,9081Q2021 revenue: EUR 144.5Mdiluted earnings per share EUR 0.23/shareCash EUR 85.0MDebt EUR 81.1Memployee headcount: 1,879Highest to lowest revenue geographies (1H2021)EMEA 65.5%Americas 26.7%Asia Pacific 7.8%Just for example, their TeraFlex FSP3000 optical transport system runs 800G/channel (1600km reach), 9 channels per 1RU chassis. I believe they use Acacia's AC1200-SC2 to do this.Looks like their product line pretty much shadows Ciena and Infinera, especially for Metro Core and Aggregation. They don't have anything to match up with Infinera's DTN-X, maybe because everybody's leaning towards stackable appliance and compact modular formats. From a power usage standpoint, it would be interesting to see how the multi-rack expandable DTN-X with ICE6 populating all linecards compares with equivalent through-put compact modular systems."
Infinera's buy rating reiterated at Needham & Company LLC. $10.00 PT.
"Somewhat related, Juniper Q2 reports tomorrow, after the close. Start to get a glimpse of how the other network equipment companies are doing, way ahead of when Ciena reports out of sync with everybody (their Q3 report approx early October) due to their shifted financial calendar.Looks like Cisco reports their Q4 and yearend 08/18/2021, I'm guessing pre-market.The monster equipment companies giving a broad lay of the land going forward while little Infinera motors ahead hopefully on the relatively easy straight road relative to their past steep inclines, curves, detours, dead ends."
"It's going to be an interesting dynamic for awhile with COVID raging:- social isolation demanding more enterprise network bandwidth to keep business activities going- retail and small businesses taking a beating and using less point-of-sale network connections- network installations hampered by travel restrictions and heightened cargo inspectionsInfinera featuring Instant Bandwidth, relatively straightforward hardware installation, and remote diagnostics/bandwidth activation will be critical to keeping their installed footprint worldwide running correctly... a stress test of Infinera and its Competitions' overall service logistics and equipment architecture. We'll see over time if Infinera impresses and is awarded more market share."
"A couple of snips from the CenturyLink conference call:---------------------------Jeff Storey -- Chief Executive OfficeroooCompared to typical traffic levels, we've seen 30% to 40% growth in Internet backbone traffic and a correspondingly significant increase in average usage across our CDN end user IP, voice and conferencing platforms. While the daily growth in traffic has leveled off over the last few weeks, usage remains high.Not all of that growth translates to revenue as contracts often include unlimited usage. But the overall increase in traffic is a positive leading indicator for us. The good news here is that the CenturyLink network was purpose-built as a platform of capabilities to handle the growing consumption of bandwidth that is brought about by digital transformation and the fourth industrial revolution. You've heard me talk about the benefits of fiber. It is faster, more secure and far more scalable than other infrastructures.Our network is built to flex in response to -- in the moment traffic increases. But when those increases begin to reach beyond the limits of our ability to flex the robustness of our technology and the scope of our fiber and conduit infrastructure allows us to quickly and economically augment to handle the ever-increasing demand, ensuring a great experience for our customers around the world. We are also seeing changes in the way we conduct business and an acceleration toward digital selling and customer care. However, I want to be clear, we do expect delays in decision making from our business customers as they reassess their priorities and determine what the future of work looks like within their companies. oooAngela Zhao -- Bank of America -- AnalystThank you so much. And then just last one. How have sales been affected by COVID-related stay at home measures? And do you see this evolving as we go through the recession and specifically across various business divisions?Jeff Storey -- Chief Executive OfficerSo, for first quarter, given the impact was only a couple of weeks, and for some of the regions that we operate and some of the markets like Seattle and San Francisco Bay Area, it might have been a little longer. Our sales were still up year-over-year for IGAM and Enterprise. So relatively small time period in terms of the impact, but for second quarter, it's too early to tell. And so we'll continue to monitor that."
"TPG Telecom Group, Australia per Wikipedia summary (Infinera ICE6 deal supporting just one albeit major subsea route, for now.

"From NPTN Call:This is important as it supports and validates our view that 400ZR and its architectures is a large market opportunity, delivering significant savings to network operators. We are conducting qualifications with multiple potential customers. Based on current schedules, we expect to increase production to hundreds of units this quarter and to initial deployments in the second half.Near term demand in western carrier markets is muted. Our customers tell us that they are seeing modest deployment rates at this point in the pandemic, as well as pauses in spending by large carriers following the U.S. 5G wireless spectrum auctions. The muted demand is exacerbated by semiconductor shortages. These shortages did not impact us in Q1, but we are seeing some impact in Q2. We expect that this will limit upside in our near term due to the inability to “pull in” IC chip deliveries."

They are now one of just two players in the 800G space and are still ramping up.If Tom Fallon was still at the helm, he might have been giddy on the conference call but I like David Heard's calm and confident approach. Bookings and backlog are healthy so I'll take that positive for now and look forward to when it translates into revenue"

"Infinera's new HQ relocated in South San Jose getting away from the super high commercial leases close to the Bay. Too bad Infinera didn't own that property on Caspian Court from the beginning, to save the cost of relocating. But it sounds like their past lease terms were pretty good at least, given they were probably offered first right of refusal upon renewal and decided to pass on the new terms.Their other Bay Area facility at Bordeaux Dr, Sunnyvale is relatively down the street from Lumentum and II-VI, once XR Optics gets some manufacturing momentum. Not that that'll matter nowadays, with reliable networking bridging distances."

"Let's Go! Crazy market. Current volatility exacerbated by weekly option expirations, uncertainty regarding shortages in supply chain, downgrade in rating, creates attractive opportunity to buy INFN. Bloomberg article on August 10th flamed fear of bottlenecks/shortages not abating soon and lasting longer. I believe supply chain bottlenecks are improving more than appreciated! 20 weeks of inventory is already a lot! Are we going into the first capacity cycle in 20 years while this inventory cycle turns? Double ordering has already begun, what will happen when real demand slows slightly? Fast INFN money positioned for more weakness, and long term buy & hold investors writing calls to collect option premium. Step on the other side and buy the weakness. Near term support $8.45. Long term price target is more than $20.00. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-10/chip-delivery-time-surpasses-20-weeks-in-no-sign-shortage-easing?utm_source=url_link"
So glad to see most of INFN’s top management successfully hitting their RSU metrics. Too bad shareholders have yet to be invited to the champagne and caviar celebration. I was one of the longstanding bulls on this company who finally got disgusted and bailed out. I know the pain of being a true believer - continuing to hope for future success despite management’s lame performance record and excuses.
Follow John and the mouse into the sevens.Or follow some logic and invest into a new company.INFN with all of its great products is going nowhere.Where do you think it is going to go with more competition and ultimately technology that will either be replaced or aged out.Dont be the mouse

"Someone was wondering about a share lock-up expiring, here you go:Oaktree Agrees to Extend Lock-Up of Infinera Shares PDF IconSunnyvale, Calif. – March 4, 2019, 8:00 a.m. ETInfinera (NASDAQ: INFN) today announced that funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”) have agreed to extend the expiration of the lock-up of approximately 10.5 million shares of Infinera common stock received in consideration for the Coriant acquisition by twelve months until April 1, 2020.“The acquisition has put Infinera in a strong market position with greater scale, an expanded solutions portfolio, and deeper relationships with leading network operators around the world,” said Matt Wilson, Co-Portfolio Manager at Oaktree. “We believe in the company’s ability to continue to successfully integrate the businesses, realize synergies, drive innovation and deliver material value for shareholders.”"
"Infinera has a lot on its plate to execute on through 2019. If they can show good numbers for the first two items beyond just optimism spin, the stock should recover. Their reliance on spin with respect to their CenturyLink relationship going forward was not a good sign, so far. Doing well in their Metro strategy is key, not consolation talk about still having legacy work with them: 1) Get yearly revenues back up to at least $1.55B which would represent an unaffected combination of Infinera+Coriant. They're about $250M/year short, as of Q1 guidancePre-merger Coriant standalone yearly revenue: $750M Infinera standalone yearly revenue: $800M2) Clean up the Coriant Customer portfolio and add good quality Customers, going forward.3) Work past all the spin going quiet on ICE5 and get ICE6 out to market, next year."
INFN holds up pretty well in the face of a weak quarterly. I guess we could rename them HSE Photonics. The HSE would stand for hope springs eternal.

It could be just the new-high markets giving question mark stocks like Infinera pause. My usually optimistic interpretation about the latest range-bound low 8's to 10 is some imminent bigger ICE6 contract captures not on the books are looking good but nobody knows when it'll happen. Anything about XR Optics won't trigger a lasting woody until later next year.

"Infn has been on a rocky road. It needed to change its technology strategy, which lost it valuable time. It needed to become a bigger player, thus the buyout of Coriant and the challenges that go with absorbing a company as big as you are.Well, now it has largely addressed those challenges. It is one of the technology leaders in its field. So at some point it's gonna have to show some business results. Something called ""profits"". This company ought to be able to produce a comparable profit margin to Ciena. Shareholders have shown a lot of patience, but at some point we are going to need to see results."

BT, he said, recognized more than 70% savings in capex.""XR Optics is the only coherent point-to-multipoint solution being proposed enabling significantly greater capacity [400G and above],"" he asserted.""XR Optics also enables efficiencies and network simplification beyond access by enabling a single transceiver to aggregate traffic from multiple lower speed transceivers anywhere in the network.""This capability, added Welch, can reduce the total number of transceivers by 50%, as well as enable the elimination of intermediate electric aggregation points and provide ""seamless generational upgrades.""While he acknowledged ""some overlap"" in the applications that next-gen PON variants and XR Optics addressed, he claimed ""XR Optics provides significantly greater value across a significantly wider set of applications.""Will try to post link."

"MF article : 2. Infinera. With a market capitalization recently below $2 billion, Infinera (NASDAQ:INFN) is another smallish company with great potential. It specializes in optical technology, some of which can, for example, help carriers boost their bandwidth without having to lay any additional fiber. The year 2020 was challenging for most companies, and Infinera was no exception, but it still managed to post a year-over-year revenue gain of 3% while boosting its operating profit margin, reducing its inventory levels, and increasing its cash flow.Infinera is not the biggest player in its arena; that title would be more apt for Ciena, which is about four times bigger, or Chinese concern Huawei. Its smaller size is a plus, though, because many companies don't want to put all their eggs in one basket by relying on just one provider, so plenty will look to do business with Infinera.The company sees increased demand for bandwidth as a growth driver, along with geopolitical developments, as many countries' issues with China are leading them to bypass Huawei and focus on Ciena and Infinera. In a February conference call, CEO David Heard noted that the company is making progress in its goal to achieve vertical integration: ""We remain focused on our investments in vertical integration, a scarce and highly differentiated capability in the industry. As we look back to the full-year results for 2020, it's clear that the heavy lifting over the past two years to drive operational improvements is taking hold, as evidenced in our results."""
"FN beat and made an announcement about Infinera yesterday in the call:""While we don't generally disclose specific transactions, during the third quarter, we entered into an agreement with an existing customer that could have a meaningful impact on our results in the coming quarters, and hence, warrants further discussion. We typically engage with our customers during the design phase and early in the manufacturing process to help them transition from new product introduction into volume manufacturing. During the third quarter, we signed an agreement with Infinera, an existing customer, to assume manufacturing responsibilities for the products currently being manufactured at their Coriant division in Berlin. We already have staff in Berlin to support this program and anticipate migrating the products currently being manufactured at this location to our facility in Thailand in the coming quarters.While we expect the revenue impact from this program to be small in fiscal 2019, we believe that it could lead to Infinera becoming a greater-than-10% customer in fiscal 2020 in what we believe is a win-win relationship. With this transaction, as well as other new business wins, we expect our first building in Chonburi to reach a level of 70% that is either occupied or spoken for in the coming months. In summary, we are pleased to have exceeded our expectations for the third quarter with revenue above the high end of our guidance and to have delivered earnings per share that were also above the high end of expectations. We are pleased to see gross margins return to our target range and are optimistic that our new program with Infinera will further support the momentum we see across our business."""
"CIEN Conf. callJohn-John,INFN is primarily on the business of ""webscale"" cloud-services, or the telco business?Ciena shares are trading lower Thursday after the networking hardware company posted solid results for its fiscal first quarter, but reduced its outlook for the full fiscal year ending in October.For the fiscal third quarter, Ciena sees revenue of $955 million to $985 million; at the midpoint of the range, that's slightly ahead of the Street's $961.3 million. For the full fiscal year, Ciena sees revenue up 2%-4%, which is down from a previous forecast for revenue toward the lower end of its standard target range of 6%-8%.Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani points out in a research note Thursday morning that results were driven by 30% growth from ""webscale"" cloud-services companies, offsetting a 10% decline in the company's core telco business. He also notes that gross margin at 46.9% was well ahead of his estimate at 42.5%.""While demand has remained strong, social distancing requirements make it challenging to engage with customers in the validation and installation process,"" the analyst writes. ""We think this revenue is delayed rather than lost and investors should focus on the potential for growth to exceed the 6-8% target in fiscal 2021."" Daryanani repeats his Outperform rating, while lifting his price target to $62 from $60."

That (expletive) is (expletive) over,' "" Tarantino said.Oscar-winning filmmaker Quentin Tarantino says he hasn't given a penny of his Hollywood fortune to his mom — and it's all because of a harsh comment she made to him when he was a kid.The director then clarified his mother meant she didn't want him writing in class, when he was ""supposed to be doing something else.""Regardless, the comment struck a nerve with Tarantino.""And when she said that to me in that sarcastic way, I was in my head, and I go, 'Okay, lady, when I become a successful writer, you will never see one penny from my success. There will be no house for you. There’s no vacation for you. No Elvis Cadillac for mommy. You get nothing because you said that,' "" he said."""

"NewsReally Fast Optical Tech Shipments To Triple in 2021, Dell'Oro PredictsGoogle this headline. Nice mention about INFN. I tried posting link but it gets taken down."
"09/28/2021 article about upcoming OFC show where all the major optical system and merchant vendors will be displaying latest wares lightwaveonlineDOTcom/optical-tech/article/14203159/four-topics-to-follow-on-the-virtual-ofc-exhibit-floorreplace DOT with .--------------------------------------It's interesting that at the beginning of the article they mention that merchant module vendors will be offering 800G optics and DSP's, to catch up to Ciena (and Infinera). Infinera's Dr Welch awhile ago mentioned that it was critical to co-package the PIC with the DSP, for them to get to 800G with ICE6. It seems these other module vendors either have to be presenting 800G engines in one package too, or selling separate 800G-rated PIC's and DSP's for spread-out, embedded linecard format-only and offering more limited reach because of the PIC-to-DSP larger separation.Besides the Acacia booth, it'll be interesting to see what the other merchant module vendors are touting.See how right the Motley Fool analyst was in throwing in the towel and jumping out the window due to all the purported me-too 800G and beyond module sources.- ADVA (merging with ADTRAN, next year) is an Acacia customer for 1.2T AC1200SC/AC200SC2- Huawei 800G, I thought Mr Fallon mentioned they are using merchant modules............who else."
Bizarre trading action going on with Infinera. All last week and continues today. Not sure if someone is unloading or MMs trying to keep it down here. I'll be buying some trading shares again.
"Comments from Ciena about their 800G sales ramp:> 2Q2021 ending 05/01/2021: 16 new design wins 95 total customers 5000 units shipped in the quarter> 04/2021: 75 total customers 6000 units shipped since commercially available in 2H2020Shipped 11,500 units total----------------------------Backing it out from those numbers:Units shipped since commercially availability in 2H202005/01/2021: 11,50002/01/2021: 6,5002H2020: start, set total to zero around 4Q2020 when it was previously estimated that Ciena would be rolling out their 800G products, contrary with their latest statement that it's been almost a year.Looks like sales so far have been piecewise relatively linear, averaging about 1300 units/month 4Q2020-1Q2021 and 1670 units/month in 2Q2021What makes it somewhat tricky is I believe Ciena has rolled out their Wavelogic 5e engine on both their DCI/Metro systems and their Long Haul/Metro 6500 system linecards. Unit total is probably a combination of stackable appliances and linecards going into existing installed rack footprint. Perhaps selling linecards isn't significantly easier than appliances, though.95 distinct installations is impressive, over the last 9 months, or so."
"Did we determine who the tier 1 is referenced in last CC? At this year's OIC, optical industry show a major North American Tier 1 service provider highlighted that they have chosen Infinera's open optical portfolio including our 400 gig GX Metro solution for deployments across their network. Additionally, we operationalize another major web-scale customer in quarter four, our 600 gig GX solution for their Metro network. And this customer is actively testing our ICE6 800 gig solution."
"There are many long time, loyal shareholders in this company, it’s a shame management didn’t deliver."
"Looks like most of the telecom people visiting the Infinera website are focusing on a solution to known issues and not really looking for a cross reference to specific hardware/software or impressed by endorsements. Akin to all the case studies, the Webmaster took away the promotion back to Front Page of their product matrix and pushed it down one level to their infineraDOTcom/product-overview section. Up down up down up down. Anyway, settle down with whatever is the best way to make it quickly intuitive for potential Customer representatives to find answers to their questions makes for a good impression that the Company is on the ball. GLTA with next week's reporting on 05/04, Tuesday. Hope Q1 seasonality wasn't too slow and Q2 guidance and later on in 2H2021 show a constant revenue ramp up.Mr Heard stated during the 3Q2020 call that Q3 is a seasonally down quarter for them (?). That sounds out-of-family with Infinera's track record and gives a slightly odd feeling about the handoff of transparency from Mr Fallon over to Mr Heard."

"Gazettabyte article discussing XR Optics... sorry if it was already posted gazettabyteDOTcom/home/2021/8/8/infineras-xr-optics-pluggable-plans.htmlreplace DOT with .-----------------------------Infinera has had to adjust its XR Optics strategy over time.I clearly remember the Company originally explaining that XR Optics pluggables wouldn't be compatible with 400ZR, 400ZR+ and that Customers would have to have XR Optics at either end of an optical connection. It's good they added degeneration to compatibility with ZR in its baseline capability.Since embedded designs account for only 20% of Metro ports sold, the Company is depending on XR Optics to keep their vertically integrated business plan cost competitive. The trade-off with Lumentum and II-VI is that the Company weans itself off of merchant vendor pluggables in exchange for the rights to market XR Optics to other equipment makers."
"fwiw, Infinera blog mentions that they see Customers are mixing their DTN-X long haul switch systems with transponder-only boxes that groom traffic at the edge, to eliminate the need to sort and switch data downstream. Looks like DTN-X will continue to be relevant alongside their GX systems. XR Optics couldn't come fast enough, to catch network owners at a good time to re-architect their aggregation connections.

"GEANT is a long-time Customer representing execution of leading-edge network deployments to support their research. I don't think it represents a lot of nodes but each route is expected to reliably provide max throughput the current commercial technology can provide. A great endorsement for Infinera that their equipment is best of breed, for each product generation.It's too bad that Infinera doesn't do nearly as well for supporting Internet2, but I suspect the academic committee that decides how to upgrade that network linking universities and colleges is forced to trade off cost vs capability and ends up consistently getting seduced by Ciena aggressive bidding."

"While we wait for good news (hopefully not too long), some Infinera statements from their Full Year 2018 10K:""We believe we are in the midst of two significant shifts in transport network architectures that impact the markets we serve. The first is the bifurcation ofthe traditional transport market into either a cloud-based model or a more traditional carrier model. oooA second shift is happening at the edge of the network, where fiber is increasingly being deployed closer to the end- user. This trend is frequentlyreferred to as “Fiber Deep,” and occurs in primarily two types of access networks: 4G/5G mobile transport networks and next-generation cable and multiplesystem operator (“MSO”) networks. Both of these trends require cost-efficient scalability, higher density and lower power per bit networking devices withintegrated packet switching capabilities.ooo...we believe our customers seek the following solutions ...- high-bandwidth solutions- efficient solutions with the right mix of disaggregated and integrated systems- easy-to-use solutions that are highly programmable, open, and automated- improved integration between Ethernet or Internet Protocol equipment such as switches or routers, and optical transport networking equipment- strong encryption at the transport layer processed using hardware at line-rate speeds"""

Seems to be trickling up entire day as market trickles down?short covering? Let#$%$ them with a PR in the morning and ?let?s give them something to talk about? for the CC
"Ciena can't be labeled shy during their Q4 conference call about guidance. Detailed guidance for the next quarter and general market sector gains out for the next 3 years. It is good that they see a strong trajectory for themselves out that long. Infinera should parallel their success. CIEN has been doing extremely well these last two years taking away market share from their Competition. They quickly took over the DCI market when Infinera was 1 year late in rolling out CloudXpress2. Infinera seems to be gaining back some in DCI with Coriant's Groove 30 but now Ciena is shouting that their 800G will be commercially selling in 1Q2020, 6 months+ earlier than Infinera's 800G ICE6 systems.The competition in DCI driving to roll out faster systems, is brutal. A 2 years per product cycle doesn't give much time to recoup development costs, unless equipment makers can recycle older generation of optical engines in longer reach applications."
"Anything related to optical network hardware trading in the US remains relatively out of favor for the last couple of weeks:Trending down:- Applied Optoelectronics- Arista (for some reason)- Ciena- Fabrinet (somewhat trending down, reporting Monday 08/16/21 after market close)- Infinera- Lumentum- Neophotonics- II-VIControl examples not following downward trend- ADVA Optical (German exchange)- Cisco- Juniper Networks- Extreme Networks- Ribbon Communications"
Good thing INFN has all this great technology and promise.Or the stock would really be down a lot
UBS analyst concluded from indirect evidence that Ciena Customers will be throttling down purchases below analysts' current guidance range of $810M to $828M - Facebook (reducing purchases from Arista) - AT&T (reducing CapEx spending) - Jio (reducing CapEx spending) - AIrtel (reducing CapEx spending)Ciena today (12/12/19) reported 4Q2019 revenue of $968M. Conference call guidance for 1Q2020 will show whether the UBS analyst's suspicions are correct for the next quarter or maybe at the least indicating a downward trend for Ciena in 2020 after enjoying a few years' of surging sales.
"Below excerpt, from the 12/10/2020 Ciena CC Q&A.2H2021 is when Ciena sales visibility to Verizon and AT&T improve from current levels.Infinera 4Q2020 guidance is expected to grow revenues a bit QoQ from Q3, but then Q1 will probably sagas seasonally low quarter for all equipment makers.Q2 and on is when we should start seeing more significant revenue add-on effects from 800G and probably a slower uptake with XR Optics. It's good that some experts see 800G as ahead of network traffic demand, for the most part. Maybe that implies Infinera's GX 600G sleds will keep on selling like hotcakes for awhile, especially since Ciena doesn't have a Wavelogic/Waveserver equivalent, after skipping 600G.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst""The follow-up, hopefully, is pretty simple. Your top traditional North American operator customers, AT&T and Verizon, have been a bit softer. One topic I've heard debate on, and I'd like your view, is how their spending patterns with Ciena may or may not be related to spectrum auctions?

News - South Reach Networks deploys INFN.
"Piper Sandler analyst Troy Jensen upgraded Infinera to Overweight from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $8.50. The analyst believes the network stress from work-at-home initiatives due to the COVID-19 outbreak is stressing carrier and data center networks and is improving the overall demand environment for optical equipment suppliers. Further, prior supply constraints are being alleviated with China manufacturing nearing full production capacity, Jensen tells investors in a research note. The analyst says Infinera has an ""impressive"" product pipeline and that the recent selloff in the shares creates a ""compelling risk/reward scenario."""
"Infinera management top ranks have been pretty much constant for 1-2 years, once the Coriant merger got squared away and Oaktree filled two BOD seats. Only one recent new executive that Joey flagged (SVP, Strategy, Marketing, and Corporate Development), to add more horsepower behind whatever Mr Shore initiated.Might be another good sign that the Company is firing on all cylinders when nobody is bailing out of the ride."
"The weak share price and analyst price targets all over the place probably reacting to the Company's current resume/skillset: roller coaster new product development cadence and sales history, Q1 being seasonally slow, typical initial slow uptake of new systems (800G) , XR Optics not rolling out until 2H2021, apparently no decision yet on 800G second sourcing with Verizon.The Company is significantly cashflow positive with a fresh GX product line and later rolling out ICE6 to their Transmode Metro XTM systems and legacy long-haul, big-iron DTN-X. Telecoms starring each other down with respect to who's going to start escalating throwing serious coin at their 5G rollouts and upgrading to 800G, to suit. When they're ready to buy, Infinera will have product ready to sell.They've lost credibility long ago with habitually showing optimism 6 months out, but it seems this time is really different. 2021 is also when they are under the gun debt-wise to significantly ramp revenue and cash accumulation. The Company has significant Notes coming due in 3-5 years. Doubtful that they can cash-out the debt, but the next best thing would be a significantly rising share price so that we don't care about Note holders converting."
"INFN is still at it's all time lows, and it looks mostly like the ""market"" is expecting failure. I really don't get it. It's pretty clear to me that INFN is a world class operation. They have had equipment installed with some of the biggest players in the industry for many years. That's talking Netflix, Verizon (via XO acquisition), Telefonica , Century Link and others. I have never heard of any malfunction other than the recent bad line card in Denver. Reliability is legendary. Sure Ciena was first with 400G but how many customers are switching immediately? It's going to be adopted over many years and INFN is releasing 600G with ICE5. Who's to say CIEN won't be playing catchup to INFN? Coriant looks to be fully integrated into the portfolio - website has all products now as Infinera - no more mention of Coriant. A big part of the price paid for Coriant was the 21 million shares of stock - at the time valued about double the share price now so if one looks at today's share price the whole acquisition was only $330 million. Impossible to get an accurate run rate on those revenues with just the Q4 guidance but it looks to me like Coriant stuff is as good as any peer product out there. INFN immediately got cost reduction on the components going into the Coriant gear so that margin will be improving as soon as previous inventory gets washed through. You have to bet by now they have been out talking to all major Coriant customers and put their mind at ease as to the combined company. By 12/31 they should have had most of the headcount reductions accounted for and by the time earnings are released they'll have an excellent number nailed down for Q1 revenues and Q2 outlook. Plenty of cash and a product road map competitive with anyone in the industry. The stock has never been this low and the combined Infinera/Coriant has exposure to all the top customers in the world and a product portfolio competitive with anyone in the world. That to me says the future is very promising. The upside is huge.The Century Link RFP appears to still be undecided or some word would have leaked by now. Even that should not really be a factor in the share price because INFN has made it clear numerous times that they have never baked in any revenue from that RFP into their forecasts. I still think they have as good or better shot than Ciena given the long relationship and large installed base of gear already with CTL. Even a whiff of good news that the ""pause"" is over or the CTL RFP is a win for INFN and the stock can literally double overnight. A huge part of the downside is already washed out here - the major downside risk here would be if things have just completely gone into the toilet and Coriant customers have been bailing out but en masse but that just seems unlikely to me. I'm standing pat and thinking Feb 22nd will be a pretty good day. At least by then the outlook is going to much more clear nearly 5 months into the Coriant integration.Anyway, just my thoughts as I ponder the investment."
"some recap cherry picked from Q2 CC Q&A:- 2% of parts causing shortage (wide variety of critical parts, not just chips)* about 1.0% short term impact to revenues in Q2* about 1.0-1.5% short term impact to revenues in Q3* 1H2021 impact: $30M - 35M* Q3 impact: $15M* Q4 impact: non-zero if their forecast that Q3 being worst of it is not accurate (my opinion)* flow back into revenues starting maybe in Q4 and Q1 but most likely 1H2022- 800G started shipping 4Q2020, first revenue starts coming in 2Q2021, ramping 2H2021 andbecoming 20-25% of revenue composition for all of 2022 (weighted towards back half of year)e.g. from Needham's Alex Henderson, 10% in 1Q2022, 30% by 4Q2022- 800G sales are across their Customer spectrum (long haul, Metro, subsea)- $50M+ in delayed shipments plus Huawei-alternative orders baked into guaranteeing 8-12% revenue growth in 2022- ICE6 is performing better in terms of Reach than the Competition at max 800G and downshifted speed increments that increase reach. They will have a better handle on what speed vs distance Customers decide to utilize ICE6 at later into 2022.- none of the parts shortage backlog was associated with ICE6 systems- normal lead times for parts experiencing shortages was 8-12 weeks, now 30-50 weeks- Q2 paid 1% premium due to parts shortage attributed to increased component costs, freight, or expediting fees- Q3 expect to cough up 1.5% premium for the two percent of troublesome parts- too soon to tell whether parts shortage continues into Q4 (knowing Infinera's luck it will)- they will engineer their designs keeping in mind which partners or situations caused them costing or availability problems- Q2 revenue trend vs Q1* USA, up* other Americas, up* Asia, down (but mostly timing related, up in other periods)* EMEA, down (but bookings up solidly)- question from George Notter about whether bookings and orders are increasing now only because of longer lead timesAnswers from Infinera CEO and CFO didn't seem to exactly address it, even after several triesThere might have been some confusion between clarifying Bookings vs Backlog* Customers don't usually order line systems well in advance. They plan with budgets in-hand* Customers communicate budgets to Infinera's Sales Team, Q1, Q2, Q3 Actual bookings ending up meaningfully higher than communicated early on this year* Customers aren't placing parallel orders to see which equipment maker can deliver first (not sure what that answers)Bookings are trending above this year's plans from CustomersBacklog is increasing partially due to the Supply Chain issues, the rest from above 1.0 quarterly BookingsHopefully George Notter didn't come away from that with a skeptical outlook"
So...does the market take guidance with the pretty large plus/minus as the potential to beat high revenue estimate or the potential to completely lay an egg?
"Looks like the recent share volume surge pushing the price over $6 is just on anticipation of TBD 800G-related contract wins. Infinera never captures wins until systems are in general availability status, so 2H2020 target can't come soon enough for shareholders. In contrast, it's interesting that Ciena seems to tout wins ahead of having product ready. I guess with their legacy Customers, it's in the bag, outright.The players for next generation optical engines are narrowing down and Infinera has the most experience with what's turning out to be the preferred general approach."
Alex Henderson counters Michael Genovese. Reiterates $15 PT.
"I might have been off by a day.What do you think.By 2pm , should be back in the sevens ?"
"INFN Mentioned 2x today on Main thread of Wall Street Bets.mentioned short interest at 25mm plus shares, that is a crazy amount to be short and not cover at below 9-10 bucks a share!! ADDING MORE"
"FWIW. From Alex Henderson: ""Substantially Undervalued""We believe Infinera is at the early stages of a major revitalization on the strength of its new products, similar to the strong run Ciena had when it owned the 400G market for 3-4 years. We think the stock is substantially undervalued."""
"I am not saying there's a conspiracy or even a rumor. All I am saying is what's on my mind.With the recent announcement of the addition of some very qualified individuals to the leadership team, I ask my self why. Is it to beef up the support for impending sales boost? Well not only does INFN have a backlog but we can't fill orders that have have. INFN is hung up on supply chain issues. Adding the new group does little to help that. Perhaps the addition is for the long-term growth? Who brought in these people? Heard? That a huge leap based on his time at INFN and that we are struggling. Was it the Board? I know we have some new directors but they haven't done diddly squat before. The ones with skin in the game are Oaktree. They positioned for a couple of seats on the board but nothing has materialized since then.I think the addition of these skilled professionals was the request by a potential suitor. That suitor will initially just take out Oaktree and I see them as part of due diligence to get Oaktree what they want, and that is OUT. Years with Coriant in Infinera has been a long nightmare.Within 6 months we will see the real reason behind the addition to the leadership team. Just my thoughts."

Interesting tweet just now from Infinera about Orange and another company trialing ICE6
"I tend to take a contrarian approach. I'm holding tight onto my shares (average cost $4.25). This is already the most what ""panic"" and shorts, exacerbated by the huge overall market sell-off, can do. The stock shareholder structure (mainly held by big institutions that just need to invest in the strategic optic industry in this info era and have tremendous amount of patience, especially given the current super low valuation of INFN which may trigger acquisition offers) makes it almost impossible to go further down. Once the panic is over (expecting as early as this afternoon), it'll climb back up quickly."
"Not able to grow revenue, continue to lose money and burn cash. Debt is piling up and share count keep on going up. The best solution is someone takes it over. This management team is terrible."

"Q2 2019 CC (yeah, about 18 months ago) question from Goldman Sachs:Balaji KrishnamurthyThanks. This is Balaji on behalf of Rod. Congrats on the stabilization and the quarter and Brad, all best wishes for your next move as well. I think my question really is on – focus on the recent announcement on Acacia's acquisition by Cisco. Maybe if you want to comment on the state of the merchant solutions and if you think that there's other suppliers available for future needs and if you want to comment on your own potential to be a merchant supplier? Thank you.Thomas FallonYes. So a good question. And we're certainly seeing a lot of interest there. A couple of things. One, I personally believe this is good for us and it's good for the industry. I know Raj, I know Bill very well. I am a 100% consonant. They're going to continue to provide us the technology that we need in the platforms today and they're going to make available technology if we choose to in the future. We've been clear, we will make our own DSPs in optical technology and we will also buy where it makes commercial sense to do that. And I fully believe that that technology will be available to us.Two, I do think it makes our own strategy around vertical integration, quite frankly, more valuable. There are fewer choices every day on the market and I think that this DSP technology and soon to be the optical technology, the value of being able to control that value chain are going to become more appreciated. And I think it underscores some of the basic value and the opportunity of Infinera.In regard to will we make our technology potentially available in the merchant? Two quick points. We have been approached in regard to our ICE6 by some people who I think maybe in conjunction with this Acacia, Cisco announcement are now interested in diversifying and working with other suppliers. I also see that the point that it's resonating with the market, that we are one of two choices in 800-gig and lots of people need 800-gig besides the two people that are making it.So people are approaching us to discuss opportunities in DCO. I don't know if anything will materialize, but clearly it's something directionally that we are going to spend time with. I was very clear on my script that at ECOC, we will discuss where we're heading with our pluggable strategy. You should pay attention to see how we're planning on commercializing parts of optics and DSP.*****************I was going back looking to see how long ago they started talking about vertical integration ( I get it is not an overnight endeavor) and also stumbled upon the Cisco / Acacai acquisition comment from back then. Fallon painting it as a good thing seems silly."
Recent article on Lightreading mentions that part of Nokia's cost-cutting strategy to climb back to profitability is to reduce R&D headcount at the former Alcatel-Lucent optical equipment business.----------------Technology companies struggling financially focus on their core competencies. Nokia and Ericsson focusing on 5G RAN might give up market share in Fronthaul and Backhaul to other companies like Infinera.
This is sector wide. Due to ongoing chip shortage that is tangling things up longer than expected. The big positions are making money trading around their positions both long and short.
"Everything related to optical fiber going down today while the overall markets take a breather.The Russell hasn't tested its last high back in mid March, so doesn't look like the market is ready to roll over for an extended period."

Another good reason to vertically integrate to be able to bid more aggressively than others buying merchant modules for their competing systems."
"It appears Infinera only participated in one conference going back to about March 2020. I realize Covid impacted these venues, but other companies participated on webcasts. Does anyone recall their participation prior to Covid? Thx"
Great trading stock. Rinse and repeat.

"It'll be interesting to see how Infinera moves forward or not with its Cloud Xpress, ever since GX and its sled format seemed to put the kibosh on their legacy Cloud Xpress stacking appliance approach growing beyond its DCI roots.If there is an 800G Cloud Xpress 3 coming over the horizon soon, that system format and form factor still has relevance. We should see the verdict soon, since Cloud Xpress 2 is based on ICE4 6x200G channels, a big gap with 800G/channel. From my cheap stadium seat I've never figured out whether Cloud Xpress is differentiated enough from GX systems to have a future and amazed at how long they've been cranking out Cloud Xpress 2 systems all the way to the present.Some development news on the Cloud Xpress and DTN-X front should be coming out soon."
Excellent results. Don't know why the stock is down.Q1 is always seasonally low quarter. Strong pipeline for 800G.

"Hyperscale capital spending accelerating at Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and other datacenter and cloud owners.

At the rate datacenters and cloud computing centers are constantly upgrading, that'll be about 2 product cycles from now for Juniper, Arista, Cisco, Extreme"

Good job INFN. Pleasantly surprised.

Read an article where Toyota has reduced production in N/A due supply chain issues in Asia associated with the recent Covid spikes. Looks like the street has assumed INFN will continue to be impacted for at least the remainder of CY21' and possibly into 1H22'. How long will customers delay their own build outs waiting for INFN to ship equipment. Looks like the Company with the best supply chain execution will win the day.
Interesting Reuters story about Huawei equipment to be replaced in the US..looks like the government is gonna pay for alot of it. Beneficial to Infinera? Link gets removedU.S. to open program to replace Huawei equipment in U.S networks

Unfortunately Infinera is like a wounded veteran struggling to rehabilitate after all these years of fighting and sometimes being caught at a disadvantage and taking a hit. Luckily it hasn't suffered any brain damage or shell shock. Have to learn how to walk all over again before it can run and also avoid future landmine setbacks.
"Best ever Infinera product line- Per Infinera's latest video shorts, compact modular and disaggregated hardware looks to be their current headliner, with Coriant systems right in the middle of things. Merger turning out well.- Transmode XTM2 and legacy Infinera DTN/DTN-X systems available to network owners who don't have the in-house expertise or need to customize via mix-and-matching disaggregated hardware from various vendors. Relatively huge installed base of XTM/XTM2 and DTN/DTN-X to continue populating/upgrading, as well.- XR Optics pluggables to add to their disaggregated hardware selection and to be implemented in XTM2------------------Seems a little slow going with announcements of new ICE6 systems. Maybe GX family is more than capable of selling into all opportunities and hopefully they aren't losing sales to Ciena by not yet having 800G across their product lineup. It''s usually a year between new system announcements so right about now should be hearing the next drum roll from their system developers."
Just listened to the 45 min Citi presentation. Very positive impression from CFO and COO. It was one of the largest investor audience in the room according to the Citi meeting chair. Six Q&As with Very positive impression from CFO and COO
"Some Q2 CC CEO highlights, sorry if already mentioned:- strategy to drive growth and expand market share* sell ICE6 into core Metro networks* sell 400G into Metro aggregation networks (systems adapted to merchant 400G and ICE6 pluggables)* sell into 5G fronthaul/backhaul networks- quarter bookings meaningfully above 1.0- quarterly and first half of the year bookings improved YoY by double digit %- record backlog- 2022-2023 metric targets* 8-12% revenue growth* mid 40's gross margins* double digit % operating margins- tracking towards ICE6 growing to 20-25% of revenue- line system bookings 60% above plan, indicating good future adoption of ICE6 systems- 19 purchase orders for ICE6 systems (+6 since 05/19/2021)- announced ICE6 Customers include Celsius Cable, TPG Telecom, PCCW, UCNET, Seabornpast 2021 accomplishments- North American Tier 1 service provider chose GX for deployment across their network- web-scale customer chose 600G GX in 4Q2020 and now testing ICE6- ICE6 performance is industry leading and exceeding original specifications- strong interest in XR Optics, conducted 30 tests and demos in 2H2021"
Optical equipment stocks out-of-favor lately to varying degreesSince beginning of September:- Ciena down ~ 20% (about to dip into the high 40's from the past high 50's- Infinera down ~ 11%- Neophotonics down about ~ 13%- Lumentum down ~ 6%- II-VI down ~ 6%Ciena in the 40's is starting to look interesting from a trailing P/E standpoint.
"A few diverse recent Lightreading article topics refer to Infinera's comment that chip shortages ""may"" affect their revenues by up to $10M over the March-May 2021 period. Sounds like just a risk of delay in delivering systems rather than permanently lost revenue, but it may put a ceiling on how much they can deliver in the short term. Some will probably comment that if it's not one thing it's another with this Company. Frustratingly true that. I guess a ceiling now towards their seasonally slow quarter is better than later in the year when revenue expectations ramp up.Even more incentive to become more vertically integrated and better predictive with Supply Chain stockpiles in order to position themselves better for consistent growth, especially when these infrequent external negative surprises occur."

"Infinera opening office in Richardson, TX anticipated to eventually occupy 250 employees sounds like partially an expansion on the Coriant-side of their business, in a cheaper state to do business than California. Infinera probably shifting any and all California manufacturing, too. Toyota and Raytheon uprooted and migrated significant California headcount to that Dallas-adjacent area, to cut support and manufacturing related costs. California Bay Area and Los Angeles still able to maintain a critical mass of high tech functions, for the time being.“Our new Richardson facility includes office space accommodating multiple business functions, as well as labs and a world-class customer demonstration center,” Heard said in an emailed response to questions."
"Lumen in 2022 monetizing assets in LATM for $2B and part of their ILEC assets in 20 states for $7.5BIt Intends to ramp up its Quantum Fiber investment... Infinera should be positioned well and gunning for a major part of that opportunity, as one of the incumbents."

"UBER is a good example of what will happen when INFN becomes profitable . Stocks which are working in this market are being valued on 2023 numbers…while stocks that are not are being crucified on short-term, Q3 / Q4 concerns."
"Trading volume is only moderate, not dumping like on solid bad news. Might revisit 7.74 on more market overall market dry heaves despite my relatively consistent optimism.Market indexes seem to be promptly bounced off the early morning heaves, almost even for the day already so that's encouraging.GLTA."
"Usually John is the only one who can pretend that any report INFN post somehow is not such a bad report.So when even John states that INFN probably will not do much.Very telling.He can blame it on the election, not sure how that tied into his thoughts, but never the less.Lets remember, INFN will state they have incredible products, many interested parties, the belief they will make money in the future.But right now, they are not making money.But they are very confident with the futureShare price down to $7.50"
So all these analysis on the CC left saying BS and put in in sell orders after they got off the call.
"INFN getting walked down once again before earnings period, today on really low total volume for the day in a mixed market and despite guiding revenues moderately up despite nagging chip shortages. CIEN has also been going down and lately bobbing around 50-52 for awhile despite analyst PT average in the 60's with high in 80's.- Next week major company earnings reports start rolling out hopefully pulls the markets forward out of its information vacuum - Congress gets Reconciliation Bill passed and moves on to other burning issues- Breaking out of this chip shortage quicksand everybody is stuck in should help the optical equipment makers- Infinera announces reporting date (a minor but tangible flag spotted in the distance)GLTA as market absorbs latest quarterly performance numbers."
"Michael Genovese - thought he left MKM Partners and went to WestPark Capital, Inc. Looks like he is back with MKM.Had not been very active on questions during the latest CC but decides to suddenly downgrade Infinera? Must be doing his channel checks and stealth research like in the past!We can't catch a break!"
"Nice of Infinera IR to throw out a small bit of Auto-Lambda news with Globe Telecom, although it looks like the share price is holding for now on its own around support that Joey and others here pointed out. News alone has never really held up the share price in the past but it's something for the Infinera waiting room as the markets go submarine. glta going into end of Q3 and October earnings dump. Entities way overleveraged gorging on overpriced HK and mainland China real estate can be that destructive to US economy. Maybe they need to cash out some of their US holdings to pay down their debt, which would be a good repatriation, anyway. Rude Communist investors, go home."
"It is surprising their low end of Q3 guidance range is flat with where Q2 landed. Q2 revenue is $339M. Q3 revenue guide is $340M - $370M. If Q2 was affected by 15M supply constraints and you estimated similar for Q3, I find it surprising for the low end range to be flat given:* comments from months ago about stronger 800G in 2nd half.* comments 800G not affected by supply constraints.* comments line bookings are 60% more now than expected for the year.* comment that 70% of line bookings are for 800G.* comment that Q2 line bookings pushed to Q3 (maybe not exact wording).They had to know the 340M would be a weight…but they stuck to it. Hmm."
"Q2 CC CFO highlights, sorry if already mentioned:- Q2 revenue: $339M towards low end of guidance (guidance range was $345M + / - $10M)- gross margin: 37.7% (guidance range was 35 - 37%)- Q2 impact from parts shortage was about $10M worse than guidance estimate- 1H2021 impact from parts shortage: $30M - $35M- exited Q2 with $233M cash (+$21M OPEX, +$7M free cashflow)- exited Q2 with zero drawn against $150M revolving credit facility- Q3 revenue guidance: $340M - $370M (wide error bar due entirely to parts shortage uncertainties)- Q3 lower margin line system deployments weighing down gross margin performance by 1.0 - 1.5% but higher margin equipment installations will follow in subsequent quarters- Q3 OPEX will go negative, using some cash to support rollout of the new products- Q3 basic share count: 210M- Q3 diluted share count: 224M (in the event they are profitable on a non-GAAP basis)I'm not understanding what that CFO comment about Q3 share count means, if profitable non-GAAP2Q2021: 206.8M shares1Q2021: 202.6M shares4Q2020: 188.2M shares3Q2020: 189.6M shares2Q2020: 185.6M shares1Q2020: 182.0M shares4Q2019: 179.0M shares3Q2019: 188.0M shares2Q2019: 179.0M shares1Q2019: 176.4M shares"
"Short interest at 8/31 is only down about 425k…landing at 23,474,000 shares short. This is the lowest it has been in the last 12 months. NASDAQ’s site only goes back one year."
"Shareholders,Nothing to worry about.I know we said to wait and hold in 2015 then 2016, then 2017 and 2018.But this time we really mean it.Just hold for another couple of quarters, and that is when you will see shareholder appreciationthanks"
"Where are INFN products assembled, please ?"
Today Infinera released an interesting blog on ICE6 over Facebooks Marea TransAtlantic submarine cable. Looks very promising for ICE6 deployments...https://www.infinera.com/blog/ice6-trial-on-marea-trans-atlantic-cable-yields-two-record-results/tag/submarine/
"The share price touched $3.00 so it's plausible that the big money will max out their opportunity and pull it down into the mid-high 2's for the short term, especially if the Markets continue to make excuses to tank over tariffs and other international current events. Doubtful it will stay there for long even in this information vacuum but then the low 3's is all she wrote until August.That Q1 deployment stoppage and issue with some Receivables bumping up their cash burn was classic Infinera hard luck twisting the knife in the wound from the lost/paused Coriant revenue run rate. Infinera is executing cost cutting but the revenue side is really making them look bad. They claimed they anticipated a pause but it's doubtful they predicted its depth and duration. A repeat of disappointment from the Transmode days. One trivial consolation would be to bring forward the Q2 call into the end of July, regardless of how the second half of the year is shaping up. Even then, that's still 2 months' away. We need some significant announcements to chase away the INFN Bears."
"Revenue guidance is for Q4 is $365 million +/-$10 million, stronger than previous consensus. The company moved to 1 ERP systems (from 3 SAP systems), and this had 3-week impact on collection and inventory (but not on revenue recognition). OpEx fpr Q4 is expected to be $127 million +/- $2 million. INFN said they are on-track for cash flow positive for Q4. Also on-track for delivery of 600G in the current Q4, while 800G is on-track for delivery in 2H of 2020."
I am very concerned for the INFN believers.I want everybody to start mentally preparing for an INFN Share price that could be back in the 6's after next Conference Call.This is going to be hard to take for a lot of you.
Anyone care to explain why MKM downgrade INFN from PT 11.50$ to 10.50$ which is still a whopping 28% above current price is a problem ? Thanks a lots

"Motley Fool gives up on Infinera. Last week, after 14 years, the Motley Fool pulled the plug on Infinera contending that, although the company has made the right moves, it operates in an increasingly commoditized space with dozens of new competitors. I'd appreciate comments on whether this is a fair description of what Infinera is now up against?"
"A quiet recap:- Monday, MLK holiday- Tuesday, start of most earnings reports- Wednesday, Inauguration- Infinera probably not reporting until the tail end of earnings period, again (1st or 2nd week of February) 4Q2020 Revenue guidance range $340M - $370M 4Q2020 Gross margin guidance range: 34% - 37% 2H2021 expectation when 800G shipments will meaningfully ramp 2H2021 anticipated XR Optics trials (currently finishing transponder management software, per Dr Welch) 2022 gross margin target: mid 40% (relatively slow improvement, eventually getting to mid 50%)1H2021 shaping up to be relatively boring share price-wise unless their usually conservative outlook gets blessed with some big 600G and 800G opportunities turning into solid wins. Luckily 600G selling like hotcakes. Subsea ICE4 holding its own with ICE6 trialing"
"Cherrypicking recap from Infinera 05/19/2021 Investor's DayAddressable Market- 74% from Top Service Providers (Infinera sells to 9 of 10)- 14% from Top Content Providers (Infinera sells to 5 of 6)- 12% from Enterprise and Government- Edge going to 100G- Metro going to 400G- Metro Core going to 800G (I think by Core they mean DCI and main Metro trunk lines)Long Haul is expected to go to 800G, so we'll see a DTN-X ICE6 linecard some dayXR Optics pluggables eventually predicted to be a new $1-2B market (probably on the usual slow ramp over several years is my expectation.
