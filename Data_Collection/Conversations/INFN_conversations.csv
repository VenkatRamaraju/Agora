Telxius Delivers 400Gb/s Ethernet Service powered by Ciena and Infinera17 SEP 2021
pR today…new executives. Russ E. Was announced about a month or two ago I believe…others new and appear to be joining in September.
"I just noticed this, it’s taking place tomorrow Optical Networking Session One: 400G and 800G Pluggable Optics and IPoDWDM for TelecomDate: Thursday, September 16, 2021Time: 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight TimeRegister Now400ZR pluggables are now widely available and are having a significant impact on optical architectures by making IPoDWDM and open optical networking a commercial reality. 400ZR+ modules will extend reach beyond 120 km, and next-generation 800G modules are on the horizon offering a doubling in bandwidth."
So glad to see most of INFN’s top management successfully hitting their RSU metrics. Too bad shareholders have yet to be invited to the champagne and caviar celebration. I was one of the longstanding bulls on this company who finally got disgusted and bailed out. I know the pain of being a true believer - continuing to hope for future success despite management’s lame performance record and excuses.
"JUST ADDED BACK NEW POSITION IN INFN.CHART A CLEAR DOUBLE BOTTOM, AND INDUSTRY HEATING BACK UP.LAST SOLD INFN AT 10.61, BACK IN NOW!!LETS GO...TOO CHEAP AND 23-24MM SHARES STILL SHORT. NOT GOING LOWER HERE, IN FACT SHOULD BE BACK ABOVE 9.50 THIS MONTH"
"While we wait, an attempt to recap Infinera management focus and expertise... heavy on technology development and execution.Mr Shore is just what they need as a transparent, coherent, high energy marketing front man with outstanding presentations. Hopefully their sales team top to bottom is equally responsive, compared with the one unintentional contact with an Infinera sales rep I had years ago, that was unimpressive to say the least.Operations- David Heard, CEO- Nancy Erba, CFO- Tom Burns, GM optical modules and coherent solutions- Ron Johnson, GM optical systems and network solutions- Brett Hooper, HR Senior Executive- David Teichmann, Legal Senior Executive- Jim Henderson Jr, Transformation Senior ExecutiveTechnology- Dr Dave Welch, PhD- Parthiban Kandappan, CTO- Greg Greco, SVP global R&DMarketing/Sales- Nick Walden, SVP worldwide sales- Russ Esmacher, SVP strategy/marketing/corporate development- Robert Shore, SVP marketing (impressive memory, coherence, speaking skills)Customer Service- Craig Cocchi, SVP global operations- Alex Derecho, SVP global services"
Definitely last minute (actually more like last 10 minutes) drops the last 2 days and on volume. So in my opinion you are not wrong and I was thinking about it too.
"While shareholders sit in Infinera's waiting room on their bed-of-nails furnishing, MKM discusses his take on Cisco's acquisition of Acacia:""... From a historic point of view, companies Cisco acquires typically ""disappear"" inside of Cisco and are merely featured within Cisco's products, Genovese said in a Tuesday note.While Cisco said it will continue supporting Acacia's customers, the history ""suggests otherwise,"" the analyst said. The deal could have ""major industry implications,"" including the potential end of the merchant Digital Signal Processing market, he said.Merchant DSP allowed tier two and tier three optical systems vendors to ""survive,"" so the deal is likely to ""severely"" weaken these vendors, Genovese said. The small handful of large optical systems companies who make their own DSPs, including Ciena, will benefit, the analyst said.Ciena stands out as a potential winner in the group, since Cisco's acquisition highlights that Acacia's 600G DCI products have ""fading prospects"" in the market, according to MKM."""
Anyone care to explain why MKM downgrade INFN from PT 11.50$ to 10.50$ which is still a whopping 28% above current price is a problem ? Thanks a lots
"some recap cherry picked from Q2 CC Q&A:- 2% of parts causing shortage (wide variety of critical parts, not just chips)* about 1.0% short term impact to revenues in Q2* about 1.0-1.5% short term impact to revenues in Q3* 1H2021 impact: $30M - 35M* Q3 impact: $15M* Q4 impact: non-zero if their forecast that Q3 being worst of it is not accurate (my opinion)* flow back into revenues starting maybe in Q4 and Q1 but most likely 1H2022- 800G started shipping 4Q2020, first revenue starts coming in 2Q2021, ramping 2H2021 andbecoming 20-25% of revenue composition for all of 2022 (weighted towards back half of year)e.g. from Needham's Alex Henderson, 10% in 1Q2022, 30% by 4Q2022- 800G sales are across their Customer spectrum (long haul, Metro, subsea)- $50M+ in delayed shipments plus Huawei-alternative orders baked into guaranteeing 8-12% revenue growth in 2022- ICE6 is performing better in terms of Reach than the Competition at max 800G and downshifted speed increments that increase reach. They will have a better handle on what speed vs distance Customers decide to utilize ICE6 at later into 2022.- none of the parts shortage backlog was associated with ICE6 systems- normal lead times for parts experiencing shortages was 8-12 weeks, now 30-50 weeks- Q2 paid 1% premium due to parts shortage attributed to increased component costs, freight, or expediting fees- Q3 expect to cough up 1.5% premium for the two percent of troublesome parts- too soon to tell whether parts shortage continues into Q4 (knowing Infinera's luck it will)- they will engineer their designs keeping in mind which partners or situations caused them costing or availability problems- Q2 revenue trend vs Q1* USA, up* other Americas, up* Asia, down (but mostly timing related, up in other periods)* EMEA, down (but bookings up solidly)- question from George Notter about whether bookings and orders are increasing now only because of longer lead timesAnswers from Infinera CEO and CFO didn't seem to exactly address it, even after several triesThere might have been some confusion between clarifying Bookings vs Backlog* Customers don't usually order line systems well in advance. They plan with budgets in-hand* Customers communicate budgets to Infinera's Sales Team, Q1, Q2, Q3 Actual bookings ending up meaningfully higher than communicated early on this year* Customers aren't placing parallel orders to see which equipment maker can deliver first (not sure what that answers)Bookings are trending above this year's plans from CustomersBacklog is increasing partially due to the Supply Chain issues, the rest from above 1.0 quarterly BookingsHopefully George Notter didn't come away from that with a skeptical outlook"
Shocked that they announced a 11/3 CC. They seem to be improving. I was expecting 11/10ish.
"Will INFN see eight again. I don't think it will for a long time.As we are about to hear from our INFN fearless leader on the conference call.The chip shortage will be used as this quarter reason why the company is not moving forward.Whether it meets guidance or not, not nearly as important if they have to shift down in the future guidance.They will promise they have great excitement over the current products, but contracts ? NO.People paying right now NO.And the stock should move comfortably into the six's and possibly lower"
Viavi CEO sees 'tectonic shift' in operator spending Above is title of article on Lightreading. I believe Viavi provides test equipment to the telco equipment vendors….good proxy for where the spend is going and appears consistent with Infinera’s statements.
"Reduced inventory in 4Q2020 by $71M as they executed on a large installation that they were gearing up for in early 2020. In preparation for further relatively big contracts, we might belatedly see/hear about inventory buildup again 3-6 months ahead of deployment and revenue recognition. QoQ increase in operation expense, spent on gearing up product development and restoration of employee bonus compensation halted during COVID.Healthy sales across their product line. Some analyst concerns that sales of their Coriant GX 600G systems based on merchant modules are cannibalizing 200G ICE4-based CloudXpress. CEO commented that enjoying long sales cycle for 100G/200G1-2% growth above the market2H2021 meaningful ramp ICE6 shipments implies Coriant 600G sleds should continue to be a good revenue contributor.ICE6 GX selling now is applicable to ICP's and CSP's. Rollout to DTN-X linecards and other Infinera systems rolling out over the next 18-24 months, prioritized by market demand/readiness.ZR and ZR+ pluggables forecasted in 3 years to carve away about $800M-$900M of the $12B ICP market for DCI and other Metro systems. CEO reminded analysts that Coriant systems will be compatible with ZR and ZR+ pluggables, in addition to in-house XR Optics.It was the analyst from Northland Securities (Tim Savageaux) who had the lone negative-sounding questions: recent downturn in their sales to their best Tier 1 US Customer (implying slowly losing that Customer). CEO says large Customer purchases always fluctuate and in the meantime they are winning new opportunities with US Tier 1's. Lighter Tier-1 spending 1H2021 with conservative expectation of heavier spending in 2H2021.MKM analyst filling in or replacing Michael Genovese mentioned that Ciena has shipped 5000 800G channels to about 70 Customers, representing twice the ramp-up that they've experienced with previous speed upgrade cycles. Infinera so far has closed several orders and wins in 4Q2020 and sales are building in Q1 faster than their own previous speed upgrade cycles, as well."
"New position in INFN today.LITE has regained its footing on charts. As the leader . This industry GOES as LITE goes. Additionally Telecom Infrastructure was among top perf industries today, otherwise a fairly quiet session . With 24mm+ shares still short, sizeable % of float . I can’t see that short int not Motivated to cover fairly aggressively here. Above all the chart has bottomed now . And from fundamentals"

"Good strength today. Strong volume in afternoon when it rose in price, then market moved down aggressively and it hung in there. I recommend a look at the 5 minute chart for today using volume as bottom indicator and candlesticks"

"A couple of snips from the CenturyLink conference call:---------------------------Jeff Storey -- Chief Executive OfficeroooCompared to typical traffic levels, we've seen 30% to 40% growth in Internet backbone traffic and a correspondingly significant increase in average usage across our CDN end user IP, voice and conferencing platforms. While the daily growth in traffic has leveled off over the last few weeks, usage remains high.Not all of that growth translates to revenue as contracts often include unlimited usage. But the overall increase in traffic is a positive leading indicator for us. The good news here is that the CenturyLink network was purpose-built as a platform of capabilities to handle the growing consumption of bandwidth that is brought about by digital transformation and the fourth industrial revolution. You've heard me talk about the benefits of fiber. It is faster, more secure and far more scalable than other infrastructures.Our network is built to flex in response to -- in the moment traffic increases. But when those increases begin to reach beyond the limits of our ability to flex the robustness of our technology and the scope of our fiber and conduit infrastructure allows us to quickly and economically augment to handle the ever-increasing demand, ensuring a great experience for our customers around the world. We are also seeing changes in the way we conduct business and an acceleration toward digital selling and customer care. However, I want to be clear, we do expect delays in decision making from our business customers as they reassess their priorities and determine what the future of work looks like within their companies. oooAngela Zhao -- Bank of America -- AnalystThank you so much. And then just last one. How have sales been affected by COVID-related stay at home measures? And do you see this evolving as we go through the recession and specifically across various business divisions?Jeff Storey -- Chief Executive OfficerSo, for first quarter, given the impact was only a couple of weeks, and for some of the regions that we operate and some of the markets like Seattle and San Francisco Bay Area, it might have been a little longer. Our sales were still up year-over-year for IGAM and Enterprise. So relatively small time period in terms of the impact, but for second quarter, it's too early to tell. And so we'll continue to monitor that."

"Looks like most of the telecom people visiting the Infinera website are focusing on a solution to known issues and not really looking for a cross reference to specific hardware/software or impressed by endorsements. Akin to all the case studies, the Webmaster took away the promotion back to Front Page of their product matrix and pushed it down one level to their infineraDOTcom/product-overview section. Up down up down up down. Anyway, settle down with whatever is the best way to make it quickly intuitive for potential Customer representatives to find answers to their questions makes for a good impression that the Company is on the ball. GLTA with next week's reporting on 05/04, Tuesday. Hope Q1 seasonality wasn't too slow and Q2 guidance and later on in 2H2021 show a constant revenue ramp up.Mr Heard stated during the 3Q2020 call that Q3 is a seasonally down quarter for them (?). That sounds out-of-family with Infinera's track record and gives a slightly odd feeling about the handoff of transparency from Mr Fallon over to Mr Heard."

"Meanwhile JNPR, CIEN, and CSCO seem to be doing just fine. INFN not so much."
Read an article where Toyota has reduced production in N/A due supply chain issues in Asia associated with the recent Covid spikes. Looks like the street has assumed INFN will continue to be impacted for at least the remainder of CY21' and possibly into 1H22'. How long will customers delay their own build outs waiting for INFN to ship equipment. Looks like the Company with the best supply chain execution will win the day.

"It seems like their upcoming Analyst/Investor Day on 05/19/2021 will be a relatively informal discussion, since there's no formal announcement at their website. Maybe local analysts and significant investors are invited to come to their San Jose HQ meeting room while they webcast and conference call Q&A to support remote participants. May be something similar to their DTN-X debut 8 years ago along with a few representatives from major Customers giving endorsements of the Company's products. Maybe Verizon this time will say GX is good stuff and their recently approved 2nd source system for 800G deployments.The Company should be making some relatively heavyweight announcements with respect to 800G and bringing more engine manufacturing in-house, at least as a parallel effort to hedge Cisco closing the Acacia purchase order counter on everybody."

Unit total is probably a combination of stackable appliances and linecards going into existing installed rack footprint. Perhaps selling linecards isn't significantly easier than appliances, though.95 distinct installations is impressive, over the last 9 months, or so."
"An article from May 2021 giving more color on XR Optics.Dr Welch commented that any acceleration of general availability will all depend on how strongly network owners embrace hub-spoke topologies and initial unit volumes, starting in 2022.

That was before they announced that XR Optics would be compatible with conventional point-to-point pluggables so network owners would be faced with condensing only one end of their existing aggregation footprints. eetimesDOTcom/xr-optics-trains-spotlight-back-on-fiber-networks/#replace DOT with ."

Nice PR this morning. !!!
"INFN is still at it's all time lows, and it looks mostly like the ""market"" is expecting failure. I really don't get it. It's pretty clear to me that INFN is a world class operation. They have had equipment installed with some of the biggest players in the industry for many years. That's talking Netflix, Verizon (via XO acquisition), Telefonica , Century Link and others. I have never heard of any malfunction other than the recent bad line card in Denver. Reliability is legendary. Sure Ciena was first with 400G but how many customers are switching immediately? It's going to be adopted over many years and INFN is releasing 600G with ICE5. Who's to say CIEN won't be playing catchup to INFN? Coriant looks to be fully integrated into the portfolio - website has all products now as Infinera - no more mention of Coriant. A big part of the price paid for Coriant was the 21 million shares of stock - at the time valued about double the share price now so if one looks at today's share price the whole acquisition was only $330 million. Impossible to get an accurate run rate on those revenues with just the Q4 guidance but it looks to me like Coriant stuff is as good as any peer product out there. INFN immediately got cost reduction on the components going into the Coriant gear so that margin will be improving as soon as previous inventory gets washed through. You have to bet by now they have been out talking to all major Coriant customers and put their mind at ease as to the combined company. By 12/31 they should have had most of the headcount reductions accounted for and by the time earnings are released they'll have an excellent number nailed down for Q1 revenues and Q2 outlook. Plenty of cash and a product road map competitive with anyone in the industry. The stock has never been this low and the combined Infinera/Coriant has exposure to all the top customers in the world and a product portfolio competitive with anyone in the world. That to me says the future is very promising. The upside is huge.The Century Link RFP appears to still be undecided or some word would have leaked by now. Even that should not really be a factor in the share price because INFN has made it clear numerous times that they have never baked in any revenue from that RFP into their forecasts. I still think they have as good or better shot than Ciena given the long relationship and large installed base of gear already with CTL. Even a whiff of good news that the ""pause"" is over or the CTL RFP is a win for INFN and the stock can literally double overnight. A huge part of the downside is already washed out here - the major downside risk here would be if things have just completely gone into the toilet and Coriant customers have been bailing out but en masse but that just seems unlikely to me. I'm standing pat and thinking Feb 22nd will be a pretty good day. At least by then the outlook is going to much more clear nearly 5 months into the Coriant integration.Anyway, just my thoughts as I ponder the investment."
"Infinera today dropping below 50/100/200 DMA bottom of envelopes.

"A few diverse recent Lightreading article topics refer to Infinera's comment that chip shortages ""may"" affect their revenues by up to $10M over the March-May 2021 period. Sounds like just a risk of delay in delivering systems rather than permanently lost revenue, but it may put a ceiling on how much they can deliver in the short term. Some will probably comment that if it's not one thing it's another with this Company. Frustratingly true that. I guess a ceiling now towards their seasonally slow quarter is better than later in the year when revenue expectations ramp up.Even more incentive to become more vertically integrated and better predictive with Supply Chain stockpiles in order to position themselves better for consistent growth, especially when these infrequent external negative surprises occur."

"Usually it's not good to put much attention to the total quantity of Infinera's ""opportunities"" and ""trials"" ... below, a few more bullets from one of their Stifel Powerpoint presentation charts- Groove: 30 new customers, bookings grew 40% QoQ and 400% YoY, strong trial demand for our 600G (DCI)- DRX: 4 deployment wins, 8 trials at several T1 operators (disaggregated solutions)- Transcend: 4 new customers, including major win at VZ, 10 on-going trials and 25+ open opportunities (Coriant SDN software)- ICE4: strong growth in subsea business with continued leadership in key optical performance areas------------------------------It's too bad that they had to shelve ICE5 efforts. Offering four channels of 600G would have been the highest density for DCI and moderate distance Metro routes. ICE6 with two channels of 800G will cover all of the shorter distance applications. Perhaps they are accelerating adding a couple more channels to the module as well, to overmatch ICE5 in all aspects."
"Can they beat the $318 million and the -0.14 non-GAAP EPS? That is the question. If they do, INFN will go MUCH higher."
Open XR Forum site still only shows original six. It would not surprise me if we see several additions all at once prior to the CC. I don’t mean to wind up SharkBait but it would be nice if Infinera can move up their reporting by one week.

"Hello 10s. It's nice to see you again. The company, excluding the chip shortage, is doing good. They finally have a product mix that can compete and outperform (biased) Ciena. They are now one of just two players in the 800G space and are still ramping up.If Tom Fallon was still at the helm, he might have been giddy on the conference call but I like David Heard's calm and confident approach. Bookings and backlog are healthy so I'll take that positive for now and look forward to when it translates into revenue"
"I tend to take a contrarian approach. I'm holding tight onto my shares (average cost $4.25). This is already the most what ""panic"" and shorts, exacerbated by the huge overall market sell-off, can do. The stock shareholder structure (mainly held by big institutions that just need to invest in the strategic optic industry in this info era and have tremendous amount of patience, especially given the current super low valuation of INFN which may trigger acquisition offers) makes it almost impossible to go further down. Once the panic is over (expecting as early as this afternoon), it'll climb back up quickly."

A tall order given how 3rd party innovation constantly shifts which tools are popular... I read that Infinera's open environment eases plug-ins so I guess their expertise is in making the environment seamless."

It's good that some experts see 800G as ahead of network traffic demand, for the most part. Maybe that implies Infinera's GX 600G sleds will keep on selling like hotcakes for awhile, especially since Ciena doesn't have a Wavelogic/Waveserver equivalent, after skipping 600G.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst""The follow-up, hopefully, is pretty simple. Your top traditional North American operator customers, AT&T and Verizon, have been a bit softer. One topic I've heard debate on, and I'd like your view, is how their spending patterns with Ciena may or may not be related to spectrum auctions? And where I'm going with this is, what will be the factors that lead them to come back to more normal spending pattern? Thanks.""Gary B. Smith -- President and Chief Executive Officer""I think what you're seeing, if you look at the sort of the large Tier 1s, or a couple of the large Tier 1s in North America, were very kind of front-end loaded in '20. Some of that, I think, was also about supply chain provisioning and making sure that they've got that when COVID first happened.So, I -- to some extent, it's sort of normal ebbs and flows of that. And our dialog with them and engagement as we get into '21, I think you are going to see a stronger second half for some of those large carriers, and I don't think that's particularly affected by this whole sort of notion of the auction cost. I think what we're seeing is pretty steady visibility in terms of --Now, we're engaged with these major carriers pretty much on all of their strategic platforms and across all of their business.

"Piper Sandler analyst Troy Jensen upgraded Infinera to Overweight from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $8.50. The analyst believes the network stress from work-at-home initiatives due to the COVID-19 outbreak is stressing carrier and data center networks and is improving the overall demand environment for optical equipment suppliers. Further, prior supply constraints are being alleviated with China manufacturing nearing full production capacity, Jensen tells investors in a research note. The analyst says Infinera has an ""impressive"" product pipeline and that the recent selloff in the shares creates a ""compelling risk/reward scenario."""
Another 52 week high. Another year high close. The trading pattern suggests the shorts are keeping the share price in ranges to create option opportunities before they move it up to the next notch. This is a standard trade method to get out of a bad position without creating a squeeze. The retail shorts could be in big trouble if the institutions can actually acquire the options they need to safely dispose their short interests. I think this continues for another few weeks and then the shirts themselves will start the squeeze after they have the options they need. Perfect execution so far as long as the little guys do not panic on the small share price boosts every few days. I see the 8 calls as their Best Buy right now. Then a jump to 8.50 to start buying the 9s. Classic. Glad I stayed on the long side and loaded up through 2019. GLTA in the New Year. Do your DD and don’t panic or make this an easy exit for the shorts. We will see double digits before they can get out. Next earnings will be to late for them so I expect the short plan to be completely done by end of February.

Good thing INFN has all this great technology and promise.Or the stock would really be down a lot
"Best ever Infinera product line- Per Infinera's latest video shorts, compact modular and disaggregated hardware looks to be their current headliner, with Coriant systems right in the middle of things. Merger turning out well.- Transmode XTM2 and legacy Infinera DTN/DTN-X systems available to network owners who don't have the in-house expertise or need to customize via mix-and-matching disaggregated hardware from various vendors. Relatively huge installed base of XTM/XTM2 and DTN/DTN-X to continue populating/upgrading, as well.- XR Optics pluggables to add to their disaggregated hardware selection and to be implemented in XTM2------------------Seems a little slow going with announcements of new ICE6 systems. Maybe GX family is more than capable of selling into all opportunities and hopefully they aren't losing sales to Ciena by not yet having 800G across their product lineup. It''s usually a year between new system announcements so right about now should be hearing the next drum roll from their system developers."

Wouldn't be as painful watching INFN go down if all of its peers were going down 5% as well.Not the case.This is just INFN
Interesting tweet just now from Infinera about Orange and another company trialing ICE6
"I thought it was a good quarter. All the numbers and margins were solid. I read a lot of good comments here and perhaps the only things I didn’t see or at least not emphasized: * the quarter was negatively impacted by supply chain and COVID by $5M. * book to bill ratio for the year is over 1 * there was no budget flush in Q4. It seems as though Heard is determined to be conservative, particularly in the first half with Covid related supply chain issues in play. I thought he did a nice job on the call.On the downside it appears 2021 topline will only grow about 5% YoY. They did not say this, rather it is my fuzzy math based on what they said about market growth and their place in the market. Prior to the call I was hoping for 10% topline growth. This is only my second CC with them so I don’t have the same old Infinera bad taste in my mouth...they seem upbeat about their products in comparison to competition."

"I am not saying there's a conspiracy or even a rumor. All I am saying is what's on my mind.With the recent announcement of the addition of some very qualified individuals to the leadership team, I ask my self why. Is it to beef up the support for impending sales boost? Well not only does INFN have a backlog but we can't fill orders that have have. INFN is hung up on supply chain issues. Adding the new group does little to help that. Perhaps the addition is for the long-term growth? Who brought in these people? Heard? That a huge leap based on his time at INFN and that we are struggling. Was it the Board? I know we have some new directors but they haven't done diddly squat before. The ones with skin in the game are Oaktree. They positioned for a couple of seats on the board but nothing has materialized since then.I think the addition of these skilled professionals was the request by a potential suitor. That suitor will initially just take out Oaktree and I see them as part of due diligence to get Oaktree what they want, and that is OUT. Years with Coriant in Infinera has been a long nightmare.Within 6 months we will see the real reason behind the addition to the leadership team. Just my thoughts."
"Hyperscale capital spending accelerating at Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and other datacenter and cloud owners. Infinera should be catching some of that tailwind on the transport line-side, with their DCI systems. XR Optics pluggables for datacenters/cloud customer-side connections not ready for prime time until after 2025 according to Infinera's Mr. Shore. At the rate datacenters and cloud computing centers are constantly upgrading, that'll be about 2 product cycles from now for Juniper, Arista, Cisco, Extreme"

Their systems are definitely up to it. Price them to win and make it up with unit volumes will put expanded scrutiny on not stumbling their Supply Chain, Manufacturing, Customer Service. Hopefully no Tesla-like stumbling, if unit deliveries get to step function upwards."
"09/28/2021 article about upcoming OFC show where all the major optical system and merchant vendors will be displaying latest wares lightwaveonlineDOTcom/optical-tech/article/14203159/four-topics-to-follow-on-the-virtual-ofc-exhibit-floorreplace DOT with .--------------------------------------It's interesting that at the beginning of the article they mention that merchant module vendors will be offering 800G optics and DSP's, to catch up to Ciena (and Infinera). Infinera's Dr Welch awhile ago mentioned that it was critical to co-package the PIC with the DSP, for them to get to 800G with ICE6. It seems these other module vendors either have to be presenting 800G engines in one package too, or selling separate 800G-rated PIC's and DSP's for spread-out, embedded linecard format-only and offering more limited reach because of the PIC-to-DSP larger separation.Besides the Acacia booth, it'll be interesting to see what the other merchant module vendors are touting.See how right the Motley Fool analyst was in throwing in the towel and jumping out the window due to all the purported me-too 800G and beyond module sources.- ADVA (merging with ADTRAN, next year) is an Acacia customer for 1.2T AC1200SC/AC200SC2- Huawei 800G, I thought Mr Fallon mentioned they are using merchant modules............who else."
"MF article : 2. Infinera. With a market capitalization recently below $2 billion, Infinera (NASDAQ:INFN) is another smallish company with great potential. It specializes in optical technology, some of which can, for example, help carriers boost their bandwidth without having to lay any additional fiber. The year 2020 was challenging for most companies, and Infinera was no exception, but it still managed to post a year-over-year revenue gain of 3% while boosting its operating profit margin, reducing its inventory levels, and increasing its cash flow.Infinera is not the biggest player in its arena; that title would be more apt for Ciena, which is about four times bigger, or Chinese concern Huawei. Its smaller size is a plus, though, because many companies don't want to put all their eggs in one basket by relying on just one provider, so plenty will look to do business with Infinera.The company sees increased demand for bandwidth as a growth driver, along with geopolitical developments, as many countries' issues with China are leading them to bypass Huawei and focus on Ciena and Infinera. In a February conference call, CEO David Heard noted that the company is making progress in its goal to achieve vertical integration: ""We remain focused on our investments in vertical integration, a scarce and highly differentiated capability in the industry. As we look back to the full-year results for 2020, it's clear that the heavy lifting over the past two years to drive operational improvements is taking hold, as evidenced in our results."""
Recent article on Lightreading mentions that part of Nokia's cost-cutting strategy to climb back to profitability is to reduce R&D headcount at the former Alcatel-Lucent optical equipment business.----------------Technology companies struggling financially focus on their core competencies. Nokia and Ericsson focusing on 5G RAN might give up market share in Fronthaul and Backhaul to other companies like Infinera.

"fwiw, Infinera blog mentions that they see Customers are mixing their DTN-X long haul switch systems with transponder-only boxes that groom traffic at the edge, to eliminate the need to sort and switch data downstream. Looks like DTN-X will continue to be relevant alongside their GX systems. XR Optics couldn't come fast enough, to catch network owners at a good time to re-architect their aggregation connections.

"Earnings date probably getting announced, this week and might be too late to make it by 02/04/21 last mid-week work day. Second or third week of February, again. Hope they had a decent Q4. Guidance for a flat Q1 QoQ would be a reasonable upside for this Company. Their entire product line is still fresh or getting refreshed with 800G. Pandemic is still jamming up travel and triggering border lockdowns but telecoms starting to gear up for 5G. XR Optics going on 2 years in-development. Maybe Infinera and its partners just stretching out their costs to align with when Customers will feel like spending on the technology."
"Ciena call regarding future sales growth:Jeff KvaalOkay. Okay. Great, great, great. And then let me follow that up by asking, is it possible that 1 day that you'll get back to talking about that 6% to 8% long-term sales growth?Jim MoylanWe’re going to revisit the issue of long-term guidance as we turn the year. We’ve been through an incredibly dynamic period in our market with all sorts of behavioral changes on the part of our customers and with good reason, of course. And that caused us to suspend our 3-year guide. Although I would say this, remember, we just – we did talk about the future as we began this year. We said that we still expected the market to grow in the low to mid-single digits overall, and we expected to take share in that context. We just didn’t continue that thought to give a number in terms of our revenue growth. I won’t say that we’re going to as we come into the first part of next year, but it’s certainly what we’re thinking about as we sit here today."

"It is surprising their low end of Q3 guidance range is flat with where Q2 landed. Q2 revenue is $339M. Q3 revenue guide is $340M - $370M. If Q2 was affected by 15M supply constraints and you estimated similar for Q3, I find it surprising for the low end range to be flat given:* comments from months ago about stronger 800G in 2nd half.* comments 800G not affected by supply constraints.* comments line bookings are 60% more now than expected for the year.* comment that 70% of line bookings are for 800G.* comment that Q2 line bookings pushed to Q3 (maybe not exact wording).They had to know the 340M would be a weight…but they stuck to it. Hmm."
It could be just the new-high markets giving question mark stocks like Infinera pause. My usually optimistic interpretation about the latest range-bound low 8's to 10 is some imminent bigger ICE6 contract captures not on the books are looking good but nobody knows when it'll happen. Anything about XR Optics won't trigger a lasting woody until later next year.
"Supply issues at least thru mid 2022…continue to take market share. From Ciena call:“ Within the strong demand environment, however, there remain global and industry-wide supply chain constraints. And as we have consistently proven, we have the best-in-class ability to manage through this challenge and to deliver outcomes for our customers better than anyone else in our industry. However, as we've said before, we are not immune, particularly if supply challenges persist. And as has been widely reported, good conditions have somewhat deteriorated and are posing headwinds with Ciena, including difficulty to fully address demand. We have also seen some extensions of our lead times and some increased costs.As we sit here today, we believe these challenges will likely persist through at least the middle of calendar '22. Moving to highlights from the quarter, our competitive position remains strong and we continue to take market share. ”"
UBS analyst concluded from indirect evidence that Ciena Customers will be throttling down purchases below analysts' current guidance range of $810M to $828M - Facebook (reducing purchases from Arista) - AT&T (reducing CapEx spending) - Jio (reducing CapEx spending) - AIrtel (reducing CapEx spending)Ciena today (12/12/19) reported 4Q2019 revenue of $968M. Conference call guidance for 1Q2020 will show whether the UBS analyst's suspicions are correct for the next quarter or maybe at the least indicating a downward trend for Ciena in 2020 after enjoying a few years' of surging sales.
"Lyle's comments about Infinera reminds me of that recent article about Quentin Tarantino. Maybe Infinera and Lyle will end up being a humanized parallel of that story, maybe not:------------------------""Quentin Tarantino says he hasn't given a penny of his Hollywood fortune to his mom — and it's all because of a harsh comment she made to him when he was a kid.The renowned director, whose net worth is an estimated $120 million, opened up about his childhood promise to never give his mother any money from his Hollywood success during a July appearance on the podcast ""The Moment with Brian Koppelman.""Though Tarantino, 58, said he knew he wanted to pursue a writing career from a young age, he struggled in school, something his mother, Connie Zastoupil, ""always had a hard time about.""One day, as his mother berated him over his poor academics, she told the budding writer something he never forgot.""And then, in the middle of her little tirade, she said, 'Oh, and by the way, this little writing career?' — with the finger quotes — 'this little writing career that you’re doing? That (expletive) is (expletive) over,' "" Tarantino said.Oscar-winning filmmaker Quentin Tarantino says he hasn't given a penny of his Hollywood fortune to his mom — and it's all because of a harsh comment she made to him when he was a kid.The director then clarified his mother meant she didn't want him writing in class, when he was ""supposed to be doing something else.""Regardless, the comment struck a nerve with Tarantino.""And when she said that to me in that sarcastic way, I was in my head, and I go, 'Okay, lady, when I become a successful writer, you will never see one penny from my success. There will be no house for you. There’s no vacation for you. No Elvis Cadillac for mommy. You get nothing because you said that,' "" he said."""

"Official announcement of XR collaboration with Lumentum today. Hope it catches on quickly to become a preferred approach for supporting 5G towers, among other things. No downside to broadening their revenue sources and maybe Infinera will be able to sign up the other major optical module makers."
"Glad I bailed on this six months ago as well as individual stocks and keeping just cash as well as mutual and index funds. Looking back, it's absolutely astounding how much time and energy I wasted through the years looking at stocks like Infinera going up and down, wishing, hoping and praying that ""this time, it will be different."" Life is too short."
"The weak share price and analyst price targets all over the place probably reacting to the Company's current resume/skillset: roller coaster new product development cadence and sales history, Q1 being seasonally slow, typical initial slow uptake of new systems (800G) , XR Optics not rolling out until 2H2021, apparently no decision yet on 800G second sourcing with Verizon.The Company is significantly cashflow positive with a fresh GX product line and later rolling out ICE6 to their Transmode Metro XTM systems and legacy long-haul, big-iron DTN-X. Telecoms starring each other down with respect to who's going to start escalating throwing serious coin at their 5G rollouts and upgrading to 800G, to suit. When they're ready to buy, Infinera will have product ready to sell.They've lost credibility long ago with habitually showing optimism 6 months out, but it seems this time is really different. 2021 is also when they are under the gun debt-wise to significantly ramp revenue and cash accumulation. The Company has significant Notes coming due in 3-5 years.

"Gazettabyte article discussing XR Optics... sorry if it was already posted gazettabyteDOTcom/home/2021/8/8/infineras-xr-optics-pluggable-plans.htmlreplace DOT with .-----------------------------Infinera has had to adjust its XR Optics strategy over time.I clearly remember the Company originally explaining that XR Optics pluggables wouldn't be compatible with 400ZR, 400ZR+ and that Customers would have to have XR Optics at either end of an optical connection. It's good they added degeneration to compatibility with ZR in its baseline capability.Since embedded designs account for only 20% of Metro ports sold, the Company is depending on XR Optics to keep their vertically integrated business plan cost competitive. The trade-off with Lumentum and II-VI is that the Company weans itself off of merchant vendor pluggables in exchange for the rights to market XR Optics to other equipment makers."
Ciena to report before the market opens. Let’s see if analysts ask about Infinera 800G again…that would be the third time I believe. Would be funny.

Another good reason to vertically integrate to be able to bid more aggressively than others buying merchant modules for their competing systems."

"Just wait....a little bit longer. I see this unfolding in the weeks ahead. Q2 will come in at $345M, and Q3 est may be close to $375M and people will see the potential for Q4 yo be $385M. Just need a couple of things to go our way whether it be new announced wins, supply chain managed, and everyone looking forward to 800g and acceptance of XR. What this will show is revenue for 2021 of $1.47B which exceeds street expectations paving the way for a profitable $1.6B in 2022. IMHO that this is what we have been waiting for. Just a real strong feeling. GLTAL"
"GEANT is a long-time Customer representing execution of leading-edge network deployments to support their research. I don't think it represents a lot of nodes but each route is expected to reliably provide max throughput the current commercial technology can provide. A great endorsement for Infinera that their equipment is best of breed, for each product generation.It's too bad that Infinera doesn't do nearly as well for supporting Internet2, but I suspect the academic committee that decides how to upgrade that network linking universities and colleges is forced to trade off cost vs capability and ends up consistently getting seduced by Ciena aggressive bidding."
"It's going to be an interesting dynamic for awhile with COVID raging:- social isolation demanding more enterprise network bandwidth to keep business activities going- retail and small businesses taking a beating and using less point-of-sale network connections- network installations hampered by travel restrictions and heightened cargo inspectionsInfinera featuring Instant Bandwidth, relatively straightforward hardware installation, and remote diagnostics/bandwidth activation will be critical to keeping their installed footprint worldwide running correctly... a stress test of Infinera and its Competitions' overall service logistics and equipment architecture. We'll see over time if Infinera impresses and is awarded more market share."
"Did we determine who the tier 1 is referenced in last CC? At this year's OIC, optical industry show a major North American Tier 1 service provider highlighted that they have chosen Infinera's open optical portfolio including our 400 gig GX Metro solution for deployments across their network. Additionally, we operationalize another major web-scale customer in quarter four, our 600 gig GX solution for their Metro network. And this customer is actively testing our ICE6 800 gig solution."

As INFN drifts towards the sevens.Please remember.They have great products.A lot of hope that someone may buy them in the future.And although no big company is interested in them today.That doesn't mean we cant all hope the stock will just go back up with hope and dreams.

I believe they use Acacia's AC1200-SC2 to do this.Looks like their product line pretty much shadows Ciena and Infinera, especially for Metro Core and Aggregation. They don't have anything to match up with Infinera's DTN-X, maybe because everybody's leaning towards stackable appliance and compact modular formats. From a power usage standpoint, it would be interesting to see how the multi-rack expandable DTN-X with ICE6 populating all linecards compares with equivalent through-put compact modular systems."
Ouch on decline last 2 minutes on big volume. Same pattern as last week.
Excellent results. Don't know why the stock is down.Q1 is always seasonally low quarter. Strong pipeline for 800G.

"Since the filing of the initial Schedule 13D in October 2018, the Reporting Persons have been closely monitoring developments at the Issuer and have remained constructively engaged with management and the Board of Directors (the “Board”) on a variety of matters. In recent discussions with the Issuer, the Reporting Persons communicated their strong belief that meaningful shareholder representation is immediately required on the Board in order to ensure that the Board is aligned and acting in the best interests of its shareholders. To that end, the Reporting Persons have called upon the Board to immediately appoint both a direct representative of the Reporting Persons to the Board as well as a highly-qualified independent director designee identified by the Reporting Persons. The Reporting Persons have expressed their sense of urgency regarding these matters and look forward to working with the Board towards a cooperative outcome. The Reporting Persons are optimistic that an amicable resolution with the Issuer can be promptly achieved and intend to continue their dialogue with the Board in this regard. The Reporting Persons reserve their rights to take whatever steps they believe may be required to protect and enhance shareholder value, including certain actions relating to the Issuer’s upcoming 2020 Annual Meeting, but hope any such steps will prove unnecessary."
"Adtran artle on LR:“Broadband network Adtran reported record demand for its products, but warned that it will post a loss in its most recent quarter due to supply-chain constraints.Broadly, the situation does not come as a surprise. After all, a number of other fiber operators and network suppliers have hinted at similar supply-chain problems. Further, demand for fiber networks has been growing all year, and could shift into overdrive if Congress approves $65 billion in funding for broadband buildouts.Adtran, which referenced some of the issues the company was facing due to supply chain constraints during its second quarter call, said this week it expects to report $138 million in revenue in the third quarter paired along with an operating loss of $10.1 million, below its previous forecasts.""This lower gross margin and decreased profitability, as compared to prior guidance, was attributed to approximately $9 million in quantifiable supply chain constraint-related expenses incurred during the quarter,"" the company reported.“I feel as though Infinera has underestimated the chip / supply issues from the get-go."
"It'll be interesting to see how Infinera moves forward or not with its Cloud Xpress, ever since GX and its sled format seemed to put the kibosh on their legacy Cloud Xpress stacking appliance approach growing beyond its DCI roots.If there is an 800G Cloud Xpress 3 coming over the horizon soon, that system format and form factor still has relevance. We should see the verdict soon, since Cloud Xpress 2 is based on ICE4 6x200G channels, a big gap with 800G/channel. From my cheap stadium seat I've never figured out whether Cloud Xpress is differentiated enough from GX systems to have a future and amazed at how long they've been cranking out Cloud Xpress 2 systems all the way to the present.Some development news on the Cloud Xpress and DTN-X front should be coming out soon."

"Nice of Infinera IR to throw out a small bit of Auto-Lambda news with Globe Telecom, although it looks like the share price is holding for now on its own around support that Joey and others here pointed out. News alone has never really held up the share price in the past but it's something for the Infinera waiting room as the markets go submarine. glta going into end of Q3 and October earnings dump.

"Welch on XR Optics from Lightreading: David Welch, Infinera's founder and chief innovation officer, told Light Reading that XR Optics has been used in nearly two dozen trials with operators globally, including BT.The new optics technology being developed by Infinera, he argued, fares extremely well in terms of both cost and performance when compared with next-generation PON variants, such as XGS-PON and NG-PON2. BT, he said, recognized more than 70% savings in capex.""XR Optics is the only coherent point-to-multipoint solution being proposed enabling significantly greater capacity [400G and above],"" he asserted.""XR Optics also enables efficiencies and network simplification beyond access by enabling a single transceiver to aggregate traffic from multiple lower speed transceivers anywhere in the network.""This capability, added Welch, can reduce the total number of transceivers by 50%, as well as enable the elimination of intermediate electric aggregation points and provide ""seamless generational upgrades.""While he acknowledged ""some overlap"" in the applications that next-gen PON variants and XR Optics addressed, he claimed ""XR Optics provides significantly greater value across a significantly wider set of applications.""Will try to post link."
"FN beat and made an announcement about Infinera yesterday in the call:""While we don't generally disclose specific transactions, during the third quarter, we entered into an agreement with an existing customer that could have a meaningful impact on our results in the coming quarters, and hence, warrants further discussion. We typically engage with our customers during the design phase and early in the manufacturing process to help them transition from new product introduction into volume manufacturing. During the third quarter, we signed an agreement with Infinera, an existing customer, to assume manufacturing responsibilities for the products currently being manufactured at their Coriant division in Berlin. We already have staff in Berlin to support this program and anticipate migrating the products currently being manufactured at this location to our facility in Thailand in the coming quarters.While we expect the revenue impact from this program to be small in fiscal 2019, we believe that it could lead to Infinera becoming a greater-than-10% customer in fiscal 2020 in what we believe is a win-win relationship. With this transaction, as well as other new business wins, we expect our first building in Chonburi to reach a level of 70% that is either occupied or spoken for in the coming months. In summary, we are pleased to have exceeded our expectations for the third quarter with revenue above the high end of our guidance and to have delivered earnings per share that were also above the high end of expectations. We are pleased to see gross margins return to our target range and are optimistic that our new program with Infinera will further support the momentum we see across our business."""
