Sorry. Hit buy button on wrong ticker. Bought HUBS. Meant to buy HIBB. Working to resolve now...
I read through the report real quick and couldnt make the call; was there a reason for the drop?
How is this stock moves 20 points up and down
"HUBS investors, do me a favor and compare financials of HUBS and EXPI. I’M ALL EARS! Really"
the BS stocks keep inflating. Fed does not care about inflation.
"Of all my big winners, this is the only one that truly shocks me still to this day. What a fantastic stock. I started buying at $91 and never imagined this kind of return."
"Overhype alert. Time to make money on the way down now. You're allowed to do that, so don't be one dimensional."
Only $300 more DOWN to go for fair value
bubble stock. 32B value for 1.3B rev and ZERO profit. They are not saving the world.
In Jan 2015 weeks paid $25 for HUBS. Never sold it.
Just bought my first shares of HUBS today!!!!
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
"The float on HUB is over 40,000,000 shares. The average daily volume is about 550,000 shares. Near the end of today less than 250,000 shares have been traded and yet the stock price is off 2.73%, down $5.35. A big player can manipulate the share price which is likely what is happening. Hubs had excellent earnings,"
"KeyBanc Adjusts Price Target on HubSpot to $912 from $834, Keeps Overweight Rating"
Is HUBS still worth buying at this price?
yeah this stock valuation is ridiculous.PE negativeobvious buyout playwho will pay over 32 B??
Great Quarter! 400% EPS Growth YOY. 40% Revenue Growth YOY. Raises FY18 EPS.
it is sad that yahoo edits posts. 1984 here we come.cannot even call out price manipulation for what it is? people knew yesterday.think they will be arrested? no chance.
Another huge winner from Motley Fool. Suggested in late 2019. I’m up over 345%.
Hahahahahaha
"I officially declare the stock market one big joke.similar to Santa claus, the Easter bunny and the US government."
99% sure they’ll smash earnings out the park with all the new additions this year.Future salesforce beater
nice move.....but I HUBJECT to not getting in earlier
"From their May 6th 2020, earnings call, take their midpoint revenue guidance for the full year, $805M. That means their 2nd half will be about $410M, or $205M per quarter. Assuming a ramp up from next quarter, you're looking at something like $195 (Q2), $202 (Q3), $208M (Q4), and that assumes things start to bounce back. The year-over-year revenue growth for those quarters will then be 20%, 16%, 12%. So you got a SaaS company growing at 12% by end of 2020! There are better Saas companies out there that are not selling marketing (non essential) software."
"I use HUBS for my business and it makes me SO much more money it's crazy! I'm still skating for free, but will need to upgrade by the end of the year.I probably captured an additional $60-$100k in sales in 2020 with the free version..."
What is driving this stock. Is it a herd mentality that it is latching on the coat tails of other tech stocks

"I've been wanting to open a position for such a long time... finally did it during the start of OCT dip. One of my rules is once your identify a great company you just buy it - and if it dips you have an opportunity to buy more at a better price. You can never time when it's going to move. It's quite difficult to follow your own rules sometimes, but I guess better late than never."
not a fly by nite co. been around 16 years...1b revs..strong b sheet and sales...
I'm up 140%. Bought last year on a Motley Fool rec. Love you HUBS!
