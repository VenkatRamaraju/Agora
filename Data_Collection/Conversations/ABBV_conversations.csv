A pop in earnings and divvy increase on the way……
Just read that same Barron's article. Stock should easily be trading in the 120s 130s
125…here we come
Why would you buy a franchise that in a year will be hit with losing exclusivity on Humira?
Don't mind me I am just counting my shekels from the Abbvie 8% dividend taking place Q1 2022.
"Abbvie report $3.33 earnings per share, analysts consensus estimate was $3.22. Go fly."
Nice bump up! ABBV is one of my favorites.
"From the AAP guysWe continue to like the company's portfolio, its rising dividend policy that has it included in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, and we are boosting our price target to $130 from $125."
Nice to finally see some green again in ABBV
"AbbVie Receives CHMP Positive Opinion for Risankizumab (SKYRIZI) for the Treatment of Adults with Active Psoriatic Arthritis in the European Union (EU)Fri, October 15, 2021, 7:35 AM"
Dropping before earnings. Don’t know what to make of it. I sure hope this blasts off and gets momentum.
Nice. Bought in the upper 60s. Initial investment is yielding me 8%. Gonna keep this cash cow around awhile.
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"

JPM likes ABBV and LLY. I trust JPM
"FDA Approves First Interchangeable Humira Biosimilar -- Market Talk12:23 pm ET October 18, 2021 (Dow Jones) Print1223 ET - The FDA gives the green light to Boehringer Ingelheim's Cyltezo as the first interchangeable biosimilar to AbbVie's blockbuster Humira, the world's biggest-selling drug, which is used to treat diseases from rheumatoid arthritis to gut disorders. The FDA originally approved Cyltezo in 2017 for multiple chronic inflammatory diseases, and the new designation makes it interchangeable across the indications, meaning it can be substituted without the prescriber having to change the prescription. AbbVie has successfully used patent litigation to fend off the entry of Humira biosimilars. Boehringer Ingelheim struck a deal with AbbVie in 2019 that let the German company launch its Humira rival in July 2023"
Yahoo ABBV
"yowza.... E beat, FY22 E est. raised, div hiked.. the trifecta, once again.. Not too shabby %^)"
p/e less than 8 using 2022 estimates.
"What abbv said one year ago (10/30/2020) relative to dividend: ""WAbbVie is announcing today that its board of directors declared an increase in the company’s quarterly cash dividend from $1.18 per share to $1.30 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 16, 2021 to shareholders of record as of January 15, 2021. This reflects an increase of approximately 10.2 percent, continuing AbbVie’s strong commitment to returning cash to shareholders through a growing dividend. Since the company's inception in 2013, AbbVie has increased its quarterly dividend by 225 percent. AbbVie is a member of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks companies that have annually increased their dividend for at least 25 consecutive years."" Hope we have good report tomorrow."
"Earnings Beat, Guidance Boost, Dividend IncreaseDo I hear Upgrades !!!"
Are there any former Allergan shareholders here who received the class action info in the mail today? It seems to me that the potential recovery payment per share isn't high enough to go thru the hassle of filing all the paperwork. I was wondering what others thought. Thanks.
"Nice to see Abbv getting some love today! Should be at least 125 tho. AND Thx for the divy!!! I honestly think with their deals and pipeline, Humira issue will fade soon."
What an amazing Company Quarter after Quarter blow outs
"Abbvie successfully climbing the Market’s proverbial wall of worry. Growing Revenue, growing Profit, Innovation, all on track. Progress on paying down debt and we’ll win the trifecta!"
The company is a cash cow.
"Accumulate, hold, repeat.Great company, great dividend, long term winner."
Remember when the loudmouths were throwing a party over warning labels? lol  smart people were adding. back to ATH in no time
"Early 2020 was just a great generational time to buy strong dividends companies whether Abbvie, prudential, MetLife etc. turning a normalized 4to5 % to 9-10-11% on principle. I hope older people had money managers that took advantage of this but unfortunately I think they were selling as I bought. Good luck to all "
"Diluted EPS in the third quarter was $1.78 on a GAAP basis. Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding specified items, was $3.33."
