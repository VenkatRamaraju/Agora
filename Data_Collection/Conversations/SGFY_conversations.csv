"May be Collusion from HF,s on Cathy Woods ?"
the last weeks charts look like a decending stairway to hell
"Well, probably Baird advised its clients to sell prior to today, which may account for the drops earlier this week. Perhaps Jess is correct that Signify is at risk of losing revenue because of an investigation-induced change (Humana/United) in medical-coding practices. One thing is certain: the stock had dropped 19% in the prior 9 weeks, then plummeted another 11% this week... and that doesn't happen without a reason. The 2Q earnings report came 4 weeks AFTER the drop started, yet at that time the company gave rosey forward projections.I added a very few more shares to my IRA today below $20, but none in my trading account. I just can't stomach buying a stock in which there's obviously some behind-the-scenes knowledge that larger traders are privy to. On the other hand, there's the Cathie Woods factor... is she unaware of the risk of this supposed OIG investigation? She bought another 1.5% ownership of Signify this week. Or is she aware of the issue and thinks it's overblown.This feels more like I'm gambling rather than investing right now."
I think and hope it bottomed out already and will start back to the twenties.
How many upgrades and how many shares does Cathie Wood have to buy for SGFY to go up $1?
ARK bump after hours
In at $32. I like this long term. May be bumpy though.
After reading the latest articles and white paper by VBIDHEALTH I’ve come to the conclusion that SGFY is lost and will migrate to the standard HealthCare PE of 45 for the current 51; ie a price of 15.61
Signify Health is up 6.67% to 25.92
Just started a position. Hopefully it will be a good longterm play.
Earnings in 7 weeks. Does anyone know the current short interest in this stock? 3 weeks ago it was 16.23% of the float.
what the hell happened to this stock today. Dropping much further in percentage than the rest of the market.
This stock after or before open and close market pushes price up but during market day trade keep dropping. Be careful.
"ARK buys more: added over half-a-million new shares yesterday & Sep.20th.Does anyone have ANY clue why the stock dropped 8% within a few minutes, a half-hour AFTER trading began? I can’t find any news on it."
Does SGFY ever go up? The market couldn't care less how many Cath wood buys.
Bending a falsely reported that Cathie Wood sold SGFY on Monday when in fact Cathie Wood bought additional shares on Monday. The false report by Rashit Vats out of India is driving SGFY lower in premarket.
"Anyone who’s selling to Cathie at these prices, and at such large quantities, is taking big losses…. unless they had ownership BEFORE the IPO… that basically means the management or the one investment firm that still manages over 50% of the SGFY shares."
"Up 3.28% in pre-market. Rest of the market is up too, but not that much."
SGFY reached an all time low at 30.20
Cathie Wood buys again and again . (Today)
I think we've reached bottom-ish. Loading up at 20.05
SGFY reached an all time high at 37.24
ARK Investment purchased $SGFY four day in a row last week...
Maybe we will have a green day this week?
I wonder how this ipo is going to go?
Cathie Wood now owns more than 5% of this firm. Very good sign.
Expected EBITDA at year-end is $160 million. That's 14 weeks from now (plus the delay to get the quarterly reporting).
Anything under $30 is good IMO
Seriously the last message posted was 6 days ago? Nobody discusses anything here?
Big selloff Wednesday and downgrade to Neutral today Thursday. How does that happen?
What’s going on? Are we setting up for a buying op or is there some serious problem.
"I was happy to see a press release this morning, it shows me that the company is still a going concern, at least. Perhaps when all the trades are settled, and the 3Q trades becomes available, we will be able to see which institution is selling.￼ This type of movement in a stock price is not normal, and I suspect something material will be revealed to us soon.￼"
Superb buying opportunity. This is a company hitting on all cylinders

"Earnings out, they crushed it and guided higher."
Wats d reason for downward movement..??the results have been good and future is promosing too!!!
SGFY is down 11.64% to 32.03
"Many stocks Cathy Wood buy is at higher prices and many stocks she sold at the lowest prices. What's going on with Cathy Wood? Example, she sold Opendoor at $14 and now Opendoor is $24. She bought SKLZ at $25 and then she sold out at $9."
Well chumps sold I bought. Now I'm rich and you're poor.
"The word all over reddit is that they are gonna run up #NAKD tomorrow. They are gonna start buying at 10am and set off a huge short squeeze. All hands on deck, we need everyone to start buying at 10am#NAKD"
Cathy Wood brought another ~ 1.4 million shares today.

Value based health is the future!
Might be great buy when it stops going down every day!
"Someone tell me how it is legal for BENZINGA to falsely report that one of SGFY's largest shareholder ARK, sold SGFY on Monday. When in fact ARK bought SGFY. This drove SGFY down premarket today and it never recovered. BENZINGA did not correct this. The media can do this to manipulate the stock price. Why doesn't the SEC look at this?"
"Has anyone noticed that the more Cathie Wood buys, the lower it goes. Just name a few BLI, QSI, SKLZ, PATH, SGFY....Funny I start feeling better as I am writing this now, LOL."
Saw the overreaction and just got in
Will be 6-7 in the end to buy some.
This is starting to get dirt cheap for 30% rev growth
Why no one likes this company except Cathy Wood? Cathy has not been doing great since this whole year.
This stock is down every single day without any good news or bad news . Is that a 30% drop ? Cathy was buying SGFY for months.
Feel pretty good getting in at 24.75
this dip is a BUYING opportunity.
Is the stock price a reflection of how bad this company is doing?
Crazy volume today
"Ark keeps on buying , Cathie Wood loves SGFY and will load up again today at this discount but stock is down big on a big day for market"
Cathie Wood buys more on Friday
Very very very over sold. Look for a $3-4 bounce very soon
I bought 300 shares today a little over $20… selling looks over done… in short term at least
Ark buying like a maniak
people will just at another IPO. It doesn't matter what they do.
"Another 300,000 shares of SHFY for Cathie Wood’s Ark on Tuesday.Cathie is buying SGFY like crazy"
Buying in today sub 20.00
cathy Wood bought a lot more but it still dropped a dollar!
"I bought at 20. If it goes down to 16, Im doubling down. This seems like a strong pickup at these prices. Down 5% on a nothing day seems excessive"
Baird downgraded it to Neutral this morning…. Decreased their price target from $30 to $24. I am not a customer so I don’t know their rationale.
This company is only company that has growth potential. It save insurers a lot of money. It can grow much higher and faster rate.
Impressive hires today. This is a $40 stock minimum.
This stock is going to fly. $40 minimum
They are on track for a 33% CAGR in 2021 and are almost profitable. What am I missing?
STRONG day for this stock when everything else was down. Hope this keeps up. I would be surprised to see this drop below its IPO $ price.
"Mike T, you must have created a lot of enemies or people here really dislike you. No wonder what you post, you got 30+ thumbs down. "
What’s wrong this stock? It is going down every day.
Cathie Wood is getting burn.
Cathie Wood picked up another 1.6 million shares . One find with about 1 million and the other over 600k shares
"Cathie wood bought over 300,000 shares of SGFY today"
The current price is definitely more reasonable for me. Is there any driver behind?
Signify Health is down 6.44% to 26.31
I think its crazy how Cathie buys this daily and no one cares. But when she sells everyone runs for the hills
cathieeeeeeee
I was surprised that Cathy Wood didn't get more GSFY with another 4% drop yesterday. I have a question for all of you. These institutions own 104% and insiders own another 5%. How is that possible? Someone borrowed the stock and sold it?
Does anyone know if options are expiring?
Don't miss a d t x....it will be on yahoo trending sometime soonAnd shoot over ten with the quicknessSektor
Signify Health is down 6.73% to 24.25
all-time low today. Proactive good time to lower my average.
The trend is ur friend till the end! Lower highs & lower lows means ….?
"I actually like this company but since Cathy Wood bought, I hesitated to follow her. Cathy has been bad luck lately."

SGFY is down 4.97% to 34.59
SGFY needs to go back up to $20+ ... Cathie Woods says so.
