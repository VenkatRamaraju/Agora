"Mike T, you must have created a lot of enemies or people here really dislike you. No wonder what you post, you got 30+ thumbs down. "
Who is still selling? Anyone selling these levels are just losing money and the upside far surpasses the down side risk.
"May be Collusion from HF,s on Cathy Woods ?"
This company is only company that has growth potential. It save insurers a lot of money. It can grow much higher and faster rate.
"I bought at 20. If it goes down to 16, Im doubling down. This seems like a strong pickup at these prices. Down 5% on a nothing day seems excessive"
This is starting to get dirt cheap for 30% rev growth
Looking forward to earnings 22 days.
"Signify Health is a middleman that works with healthcare providers and healthcare benefits managers such as Anthem to keep average costs low. Signify Health's most popular service at the moment involves in-home evaluations of patients in an attempt to reduce hospital readmissions.Ever since the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, healthcare providers are increasingly likely to receive fixed rates for specific health episodes like cataract-removal surgery or knee replacement. By keeping patients at home as much as is safely manageable, Signify Health can save insurers a bundle.Signify Health's approach to healthcare spending management is working out well for Signify and its clients. In the first half of 2021, the company reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) that reached an impressive $89 million."
They are on track for a 33% CAGR in 2021 and are almost profitable. What am I missing?
Very very very over sold. Look for a $3-4 bounce very soon
Cathie Wood picked up another 1.6 million shares . One find with about 1 million and the other over 600k shares
"I work in the company, calling to schedule these appointments"
Seriously the last message posted was 6 days ago? Nobody discusses anything here?
"ARK buys more: added over half-a-million new shares yesterday & Sep.20th.Does anyone have ANY clue why the stock dropped 8% within a few minutes, a half-hour AFTER trading began? I can’t find any news on it."
"Ark keeps on buying , Cathie Wood loves SGFY and will load up again today at this discount but stock is down big on a big day for market"
Hopefully this is not a preview to earnings...
"Has anyone noticed that the more Cathie Wood buys, the lower it goes. Just name a few BLI, QSI, SKLZ, PATH, SGFY....Funny I start feeling better as I am writing this now, LOL."
"Anyone who’s selling to Cathie at these prices, and at such large quantities, is taking big losses…. unless they had ownership BEFORE the IPO… that basically means the management or the one investment firm that still manages over 50% of the SGFY shares."
I was surprised that Cathy Wood didn't get more GSFY with another 4% drop yesterday. I have a question for all of you. These institutions own 104% and insiders own another 5%. How is that possible? Someone borrowed the stock and sold it?
"FWIW, Ark Invest had to file a 13G because they now own more than 10% of the SGFY shares… 10.67% to be exact (17.9 mil shares). They’re the 2nd largest owner. The 3rd-largest owner owns 5 mil shares, 90% of which were acquired this summer as the price plummeted."
Is the stock price a reflection of how bad this company is doing?
all-time low today. Proactive good time to lower my average.
Might be great buy when it stops going down every day!
Signify Health is down 6.61% to 15.95
Cathy Wood brought another ~ 1.4 million shares today.
Cathie Wood is getting burn.
After reading the latest articles and white paper by VBIDHEALTH I’ve come to the conclusion that SGFY is lost and will migrate to the standard HealthCare PE of 45 for the current 51; ie a price of 15.61
"$15.77 today, Wow. Cathy Wood has over 9 million shares. I wonder if she bought some more today. The only positive today is that it traded half of the daily average."
Buying in today sub 20.00
Does SGFY ever go up? The market couldn't care less how many Cath wood buys.
Does anyone know if options are expiring?
"Man this one is testing my patience. One step forward, three steps back... Hopefully earnings helps rebound this one!"
So much value at this price. Glad to see the markets taking notice
"SGFY over $30 in July , and $28 week of last earnings call in August . Why did it drop so hard ?"
$16.20 is now the all time low for SGFY
What’s going on? Are we setting up for a buying op or is there some serious problem.
stop falling please!!!
Expected EBITDA at year-end is $160 million. That's 14 weeks from now (plus the delay to get the quarterly reporting).
SGFY needs to go back up to $20+ ... Cathie Woods says so.
"Up 3.28% in pre-market. Rest of the market is up too, but not that much."
