I just sold crack on the corner so i could buy 2 more shares! #All in!
Bought more in Low 90's. Firmly believe the $125 target for 2021 is reasonable. %15 gain plus Div. All should be looking at more traditional rates of return with reduced risk. IMO
Anyone care to explain why ALL is looking bearish after good earnings. Feel like it should be sitting around $101 right now
Concentrated focus on property and casualty business will help accelerate growth
Allstate insurance is more expensive than most other insurance companies

This seems like a very undervalued stock. Am I missing something? Is the risk that customers won't pay their premiums?
Insurance companies thrive in a rising interest rate environment. That is the reason this is going up everyday. Big/Smart money knows this and are buying.
"I’ve posted before and I’ll post again, this is one of those epic moments/opportunities to go all in or fold. You will never have a better opportunity, yes this stock is super high risk, but you gotta ask yourself, is the reward worth it? I for one will not sell a single share until court has ruled a decision. I also can not allow this opportunity to pass by... #all-in"
"15% plus yield on cash flow per share, 4% annualized yoy rev since 2012, 8% cash flow growth yoy, light capex & decreasing shares outstanding from buy backs.Gross margins are largest in industry, price to book & sales is spot, or under.Tangibles are light.What’s not to like?We are heavily accumulating."
"Very undervalued IMO, p/b around 1. pe=6 (yes pe will be higher next year but still around 8). Revenue eps steady growth...Returning lot of capital to shareholder 3% dividend + 6% buyback yield"
Just bought ALL a few weeks ago. Stumbled across it and really liked what I saw. Seems like an absolute no brainer. Happy to hold this. I suspect this to be a slow and steady grower paying a handsome dividend.
"Any thoughts on the purchase of ""The General"" for $4 billion in cash? It tells me All State is doing well financially and is seeking to expand into lower priced markets."
"Parent company Sears in bankruptcy, allstate is outdated too"
Sold this yesterday morning at $136.05 after getting in at $100.46 last November - nice profit but I was hoping to ride it to long-term. Lots of damage from Ida though and it's early in the hurricane season. My only other Ida exposure is First Energy and its only risk is in its pathway out the east and I doubt things will be that dicey after 2-3 days on land.
"With interest rates rising and increasing inflation on the horizon, ALL (and other value stocks) are poised to soar as investors unload from their overvalued growth stocks."

"I am a customer of a home owner policy from Allstate. Unfortunately, I was hit by HurricanE Harvey and my roof was totaled. All state personnel had led me to believe that my roof would be covered in such an event. Instead, my policy was based on a cash value premise, meaning that my roof was considered older and only worth 40 cents on the dollars. Combined with my deductible, Allstate basically did not pay but only a few hundred dollars on my new $10,000 roof. Basically, Allstate sells inferior insurance policies which have coverage gaps that you can drive a truck through. I spoke with 1/2 dozen Allstaters up the chain of command. All I heard was how sorry they were. That did not pay the bill. So much for the ""good hands people"". When you see these guys coming for you with their good hands, hide your wallets. I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN. I WOULD GIVE THEM ZERO STARS IF I COULD. BUYER BEWARE."
"Even if BB stock opens over 30, have no fear, buy and hold! $BB is blasting off.  Then same thing tomorrow morning!. I shed no tears for these large hedge funds. The same ones that took Gov't bailout. They can sell their jets and yachts and get a taste of what its like to struggle. They can control pre market, but when the bell rings, we the people take control. Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno#All for one and one for all"
