"Unable to grow, buying market share through acquisitions to mask their weakness."
Just a heads up Allstate stock is trading on Robinhood for 11 bucks... it says the stock dropped 87% but I’m sure somethings wrong with the app... still funny tho... unless I’m missing something
Premium increases causing adverse selection in terms of remaining new growth
"15% plus yield on cash flow per share, 4% annualized yoy rev since 2012, 8% cash flow growth yoy, light capex & decreasing shares outstanding from buy backs.Gross margins are largest in industry, price to book & sales is spot, or under.Tangibles are light.What’s not to like?We are heavily accumulating."

"I just listened to the earnings call, and there were no surprises that should drive the stock down. They said they are continuing their share buyback program, and they implied they thought the price of $97 is too low. They also said there will not be a ""Shelter-in-Place Payback"" program in the future. They said they benefited from the virus, but the underlying business is ""quite strong"".I've found this stock moves in odd ways, such as a huge drop when they bought an earnings accretive company, and then it climbed back up over the next 2 weeks.Remember, the lowest Analyst target price is $101."

Just bought ALL a few weeks ago. Stumbled across it and really liked what I saw. Seems like an absolute no brainer. Happy to hold this. I suspect this to be a slow and steady grower paying a handsome dividend.

Sold this yesterday morning at $136.05 after getting in at $100.46 last November - nice profit but I was hoping to ride it to long-term. Lots of damage from Ida though and it's early in the hurricane season. My only other Ida exposure is First Energy and its only risk is in its pathway out the east and I doubt things will be that dicey after 2-3 days on land.
Insurance companies thrive in a rising interest rate environment. That is the reason this is going up everyday. Big/Smart money knows this and are buying.

They adjusted down their agent force compensation by 10% in 2020 and are looking to possibly cut another 22% in compensation from their agent sales force in 2022.

"Just got done going through the claim process with Allstate concerning the damage I sustained to my house from Hurricane Harvey. I was VERY disappointed to learn how my Allstate home owners insurance policy was not going to cover the majority of my roof replacement. Crooked Allstate uses actual cash value in policies vs. replace cost values and depreciates the value of your roof by age. They seem to be the only crooked insurance company here doing it that way. Anyways, Crooked Allstate sold me an insurance policy with a coverage hole you could drive a truck through. Shame on me for believing Allstate. Good Hands people? My #$%$.

Boost in dividend is very good news.
ALL-PI is down 6.90% to 17.99
So ALL announces it's spending $1.4 billion to buy Squaretrade and Allstate loses $800 million in stock value. Sounds like another deal where some investment bankers made a sweet commision while Allstate takes it in the shorts. Time will tell.
Appears this Allstate preferred stock has been called with the call Date being Oct 15th.
"Allstate continues to use delay, deny, defend as a business model. This means they will try to lowball paying claims to certain individuals. I'm a senior citizen collecting my retirement benefits. Allstate thinks its appropriate to offer me an 80% claims settlement, when, in fact, their insured driver was 100% responsible for causing the accident. He admitted his fault to the police too! I'm suing them (their insured driver) in small claims court."
ALL-PA reached a new All Time Low at $23.81
"AI will be used more in insurance, new form of competition coming like for eg: Root for car insurance and swyfft for home insurance are few examples. Plus self driving cars will be insured by manufacturers. Agency/ agent model is 100 years old. Insurance is not complicated, it’s self explanatory, no need for a agent “ advisor”"
This is all I can find that might explain a post-ER drop: 1/27/2021 The Allstate Corp. is selling Allstate Life Insurance Co. to entities managed by investment firm Blackstone for $2.8 billion.
"AI is advancing faster, I think agents will be eliminated, allstate will be more automated for more profitability"
Allstate insurance is more expensive than most other insurance companies
Merrill raised its price target to $193 while several others went to $150-$155 while the stubborn Morningstar analyst is at $110 - a clown but that happens often with Morningstar.
Maybe the earnings release will bode well for this stock intermediate term. The continued stock buyback plan and potential rotation into this stock and out of other P&C companies such as CB should support current valuations and provide for upside.
Adding the second half of the year will be good imho for insurance companies.
"Earnings will be released after the close on 2/5/2019. The market has already priced in the anticipated cost for the California Wildfires from November. But, do remember, that the company has a large stock buyback in place. This buyback program may well be impacted by a black out period which may be estimated to be from roughly 12/17/2018 to 2/5/2019. So, for roughly six and a half weeks, the company could not buy back shares. When the buy back resumes in earnest, this should support the stock price. I anticipate ALL to be higher a month from now due to the expiration of the blackout period, and the resumption of stock buybacks."
Allstate is up 7.33% to 89.94
"Down again. Buy, buy, buy. Good discount on an already undervalued stock."

"Allstate Claim number 055566395 Lori Williams at 800-767-7619 knows how to reach me. I continue to receive unwanted messages from emergency service providers, medical providers and others complaining that they have not been paid. Lori claims that I must sign a release on order for her to pay Allstates bills. That creates a situation in which I am writing an insurance policy to protect Allstate. I simply can't do that. There is no way for me to know what bills may come in the future from that potentially fatal day. Your bills are $894.28 MCHD EMS, $202 Houston Radiology, $6090 Houston Methodist and $1992 for Woodlands Emergency Physicians. I think Lori believes that the $3500 offered to me for my pain, inconvenience and lost wages will persuade me to do something imprudent like sign the release. The only release I can control, and grant is that I accept the $3500 for the impact to me. I have offered that to Lori, but she does not understand this. You can keep the $3500 and just pay the bills. I will likely never sign the release for all the other parties, and I have no intention of spending my time obtaining documentation from the providers that their bills are complete and accurate."

No buy on Allstate. Sold off life ins division which was a money maker. Lowest renewal ratio on auto insurance for 15 years. Still don’t know what they are doing.
"Since most people are still commuting then why haven’t auto insurance rates plunged? Again, Congress is asleep at the helm"
Insurance companies have been providing credits to clients due to lack of activity. You can bet that if they give back 1 million they saved 2. Lack of auto accident exposure and property damage for unoccupied homes will be reduced. Expect a beat on earnings.
Allstate breaks out from the resistance is a sign for strong buy .
"I've been with Allstate auto insurance since 1978 and homeowners since about 2000. Neighborhood had hail damage with literally every house next to mine getting roofs replaced by their insurance companies. Allstate denied my claim. I Had a public adjuster inspect the roof and send the photos to Allstate showing the damage. They claimed the damage was from the age of the roof, despite 2 other homes next to mine had the same roof built at the same time. Their roofs were replaced by their insurance companies with no problems. My public adjuster said she had never had this experience with an insurance company ever. She said I could sue, but it was possible I could lose. This process took about 7 months with Allstate refusing to pay. Naturally I dumped them and received a refund of about $1000 back from 3 policies I've had with them. They're making more profits now because of policies like these I've experienced, but I believe time will catch up to them when the customer goes elsewhere. Then, their ex-customers will be with other insurance companies and the profits will dry up. It's disgusting what they're doing. Don't even consider getting insurance from this company. When you need it, they won't pay. What a rip off."
Allstate about to lose tons of customers. ALL spent over 500 million on TV adds massive CEO salary and his board Thugs to raise Great customers rates 19%
Concentrated focus on property and casualty business will help accelerate growth
"I am a customer of a home owner policy from Allstate. Unfortunately, I was hit by HurricanE Harvey and my roof was totaled. All state personnel had led me to believe that my roof would be covered in such an event. Instead, my policy was based on a cash value premise, meaning that my roof was considered older and only worth 40 cents on the dollars. Combined with my deductible, Allstate basically did not pay but only a few hundred dollars on my new $10,000 roof. Basically, Allstate sells inferior insurance policies which have coverage gaps that you can drive a truck through. I spoke with 1/2 dozen Allstaters up the chain of command. All I heard was how sorry they were. That did not pay the bill. So much for the ""good hands people"". When you see these guys coming for you with their good hands, hide your wallets. I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN. I WOULD GIVE THEM ZERO STARS IF I COULD. BUYER BEWARE."
Trv pps target raised from 175 to 185 and imho All has more upside and a higher ROE.

Allstate plans to release much of its claim staff to India. Plans also to gradually phase out its exclusive agency force. Shades of AT&T with Directv they spun off their customer service staff to India and customers fled in droves. Buyer beware.
This will be over $100 soon
Bought more in Low 90's. Firmly believe the $125 target for 2021 is reasonable. %15 gain plus Div. All should be looking at more traditional rates of return with reduced risk. IMO
