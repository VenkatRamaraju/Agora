"Well, new management has started delivering."

This is seen as TOP TAKEOVER target. Nice time to buy it. WAYYYYY oversold..
Didn't Perrigo trade near 200 a couple of years ago and was a takeover candidate? What the h... happened?
glad I sold PRGO at $190/sh a couple years back....I thought they should have accepted the buyout offer
Any facts to support claims that Amazon will contract with Perrigo to make medical products for Amazon to sell?I got a broker calling me with a buy recommendation for PRGO due to pending business alliance between Amazon and Perrigo.Please advise.
PRGO fairly large May 45 call buyer today with stock at $41.57.
Perrigo is down 5.00% to 38.74
Extremely disappointed. This may be a value trap.

Am I the only one interested in the stock ?? this conversation page is dead. Has everyone alreaedy lost faith in perrigo . no hope ? I still own quite a lot of shares and believe that new management can really rebuild this company and eventually someone will want to buy it. Companies like Mylan must be considering a second offer. probably not as high as the original but somewhere around 110 120.

With the flu season rising and the approval of a could and flu (MUCINEX DM) like OTC. Earnings will rise.

"Wouldnâ€™t the prudent response be to move their headquarters out of Ireland and into the US - though spiteful, with the recent cut to US corporate tax it would probably a neutral move with respect to future taxes."
I believe we can expect a small pop in the next few days. Stay tuned
"Perrigo is one of many Big Pharma after Vaxil Bio VXL.V VXLLF that developed a Covid Vaccine Oral Pill, that safer and far more effective. Stock has millions of trades today and up 60%. https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/VXL.VN/opinion"
"Now that they are out of generics, look for strong cash flow from their consumer brandsdont forget they have a ton of cash on the balance sheetattractive take over targetI could see JNJ PG or private equity come along and take them out at say $65 - $70"
"Scientists at the University of Oxford said on Tuesday that they have identified what they called the first drug proven to reduce coronavirus-related deaths, after a 6,000-patient trial of the drug in Britain showed that a low-cost steroid could reduce deaths significantly for hospitalized patients.The steroid, dexamethasone, reduced deaths by a third in patients receiving ventilation, and by a fifth in patients receiving only oxygen treatment, the scientists said. They found no benefit from the drug in patients who did not need respiratory support"

This week CEO stated they will be releasing results on a Covid Oral pill Vaccine. They had already had 3 successful with injection Vaccine. Total different Vaccine, as they are using cell treatment.
