Will replace the Needle/ pill form of the same drug. In the USA a lone over 3/4 million prescriptions a year. 2. Last year 10 billion world wide sales in Diabetic Gastro Market, growing daily. 3. Drug has been used for Migraines, cancer and post operation surgery.4. EVOKE can black label Gimoti, sell to multiple mentioned markets that produce billions of sales every year. 5. 10 year patent in USA, 12 years outside the USA. Curently there is no compition only approved drug.6. The potential sales with attacking all market suffers, could easily exceed 500 million. All markets mentioned are growing daily. 7. Company has 24M shares in circulation. roughly 22M in reserve. 8. CEO Gonyer has sold every FDA approved drug he has been involved with. This is a great investment at this very low price. Monday Evoke has a world wide investors presentation at the H.C. Wainwright investment conference."
"So whats the big deal on the offices searched business. Everyone knew that perrigo is under investigation , this is no big news , so whats happening today? Its pretty obvious that offices will be searched."
UNLESS WE GET A BUYOUT OFFER THIS WILL BE DEAD MONEY
$190/share Mylan offer just wasn't good enough. We all were duped.
great new CEO
"Guys: If we want to see any bounce back of the stock , this requires a complete shake up of management. We need some figures that are appreciated by the street. Current management is just default , nothing special , with no exciting vision except trying to keep the ship from sinking. this is not good enough , we need some drastic and inovative steps. One good CEO can make this change. This is what happened to Teva after the replace the CEO with Erez Vaigman. the share just shot up at once. Hendrikson is not a bad guy , but he doesnt seem to have the vision required to get the ship moving full steam ahead."
I drew my line in the sand on this at $200/sh.....sold at $199/sh about 2 years ago as you idiots turned down Mylan's offer. When opportunity knocks you gotta open the door...that's what my aunt Myrtle use to say
Buying now. :-)

Bought the Feb. 50$ calls just saying . Cheers to all
Didn't Perrigo trade near 200 a couple of years ago and was a takeover candidate? What the h... happened?
Glad I got out when it briefly went 49 $ + some months ago ... I see it went right back down again since. Would have been trapped. Couldn't actually believe it went up then on (bad) news in the context of the Irish tax issue. Sometimes I'm lucky ... :-)
"Stock starting to break out today, wonder if they have a deal to sell their royalty rights to a big pharma for 3 billion......has been shopped a while so likely deal should be happening soon."

PRGO is down 4.94% to $69.21
I would like to know why they are selling the rights to the royalties of the drug. It sounds like a terrible deal to me.
"The way things are going , I wouldnt be surprised if perrigo get a buyout offer during 2018. I am sure companies like JNJ of Pfizer would be interested and now that perrigo seemed to have stablized the ship . looks like a possibility."
Perrigo is a strong takeover target... just hold and add low... xoxo

You have to wonder about a mgmt group that told a tale one way with Mr. Papa vs. the way they are telling it now. This stock has been an un-mitigated disaster from the time the Mylan bid was rejected (what were mgmt and big shareholders thinking?) to now. Just a complete train wreck of a company. Perhaps PRGO strategy has been more like the dirty V than many would like to admit.. I think Papa seems a bit crooked from all that's transpired here. How does this guy still have any credibility on the street? Maybe VRX is the last-gasp place for this guy - like Bernie Ebbers taking over Enron.

"If you ask me , hendrikson didnt retire. he was removed and maybe there already is a candidate. they just want to make this change elegantly without causing too much waves."
"When things start break apart, then time to Sell"
PRGO stock is broken. They have an incompetent CEO to turned down a great buyout offer. Sitting now with 60% loss because CEO said his company was valued more.
buyout rumor by Teva makes a lot of sense and even a 15 billion offer or 103.00 would be a steal to TEVA. Could be some truth to this!
word is they hired some bankers
Perrigo Company is down 12.73% to 42.91
buyout by yearend
"Touched breakout today at 86.30, watch for another try. MACD crossing to green as well"
"Now that they are out of generics, look for strong cash flow from their consumer brandsdont forget they have a ton of cash on the balance sheetattractive take over targetI could see JNJ PG or private equity come along and take them out at say $65 - $70"
"I think , the split is just a promo to enable its acquisition e.g. J&J , P&G,"
they've got those lawyers who negotiate and will settle for less than 100 million. Chump change. PRGO just needs to cut salaries by 25% and they'll make that million up really fast. No problem. just buy here and hold for a 2x in a year.
"everyone sold tesaro and it tripled. this is hedge fund redemption related, believe in the company then buy it. otherwise good bye"

SP ? ;) Anyway I see the stock zooming to the low $100's as developments unfold, LOVE IT DOWN HERE AT $88 A STEAL!!!!"
what a massive dump these past 2 weeks have been
Greatly undervalued stock!
Is the stock chart correct from 200 to 63 in past 3 years?!
"Well, the combination of the CEO saying generics could not easily be separated from the business, along with the crash in generic drug manufacturer's stocks after the report that DOJ is going to charge generic companies with price collusion, means any chance of a buyout has pretty much vanished.The question is if this is an overreaction, and PRGO perhaps won't be as hurt as other generics because of its OTC business...http://www.investors.com/news/technology/generic-drugmakers-crash-on-report-doj-plans-collusion-charges/?yptr=yahoo"

"IS it just a rumour that JNJ might have their eyes on perrigo ? . Someone I know bought quite a large amount of shares last week, but I couldn't find anything on the internet about it. Actually I myself was wondering whether mylan will try again now that a year has already past."
"Looking at recent history, this stock spiked over $200 for a short period of time. Does anyone know what caused this and could it happen again?"
I bought some of this. the most boring stock in the world. hope to see 50% return in 18 months.
There's only one reason to own PRGO. As a stand alone company it's fairly pedestrian. Some one will buy them out. Remember they turned down >$200 price over a year ago. Gotta believe it's worth at least 1/2 that.
"buyout before yearend imho good luck , add more at these prices"
"JNJ DROPS BID FOR ACTELION, PRGO NEXT??"
"we wont get a buy out offer here, there are too many negatives, to name a few1, price fixing and the ongoing lawsuit against that.2, the delayed earnings, which will probably be negative3. the outlook on earnings will be bad as they sold the royalties from tysabri, which will have a mayor hit on future income.it also looks like the big boys are unloading quietly before the next crash down."
the move does not seem to be creating any shareholder value today.
glad I sold PRGO at $190/sh a couple years back....I thought they should have accepted the buyout offer
Sell before too late
no news. why is this down?
"We need new blood across the board.this share has no hope with current management. Hendrikson is just a mediocre manager with no inspiration. We need someone to completely rearange the company. Jesus , I cant believe he 60 perwho rejected mylans offer. I wasnt one of them myself."

4 months since any conversation on this #$%$ - what is everyone's crystal ball saying now???
Am I the only one interested in the stock ?? this conversation page is dead. Has everyone alreaedy lost faith in perrigo . no hope ? I still own quite a lot of shares and believe that new management can really rebuild this company and eventually someone will want to buy it. Companies like Mylan must be considering a second offer. probably not as high as the original but somewhere around 110 120.

"Don't be fooled by their insider purchases. PRGO still is a terriable investment. Terrible guidance, high risk of losing your investment. PRGO BOD, CEO and Exec's have provin they will not do whats in the best interest for their shareholders.Always look at the integrity of the people runing a company."
Crooks do it again:If you look at the news. prgo only has good news but its price quietly drops heavily during the last 2 days without any bad news. Why?I guess Wall Street crooks try every thing to pull down prgo price so they can load shares of prgo as much as they can from retail investors before prgo zooms up because prgo sells part of company or the whole company at least $120/share. On the other hand after loading enough shares they will tell their analyst upgrades prgo and make the price going up by selling and buying at the same time with price higher and higher like now they buy and sell at the same time with price lower and lower to push the price down.
Finally the start to breaking up. First to go royalty interest!
Accounting issues and CFO let go. This is terrible news and I predict 10 to 20 percent price drop tomorrow. This is very disturbing news.
"No Larry, PRGO may be buying MNKD. Whoohoooo"

"it seems like lots of companies have negative net worth when you subtract intangibles - PRGO is no exception- something like 8 billion in goodwill and 6-7 bil other intangible assets- bringing real ""book value"" to negative 4-5 billion. Another interesting fact is over the years they raised 8 billion (since inception) in stock offerings- But they now only have 2 billion in retained earnings- so over 20 years they have made 25% return on raised capital- that's a total return in 20 years- not the best track record if u ask me"

"Interview with Starwood group backs that management is actively looking to sell the royalty stream off for around 3 billion and is not unopposed to selling off drug division too, leaving the company a over the counter product company like JNJ.

They found no benefit from the drug in patients who did not need respiratory support"

what is your source for buyout? why the stock price did not respond today?
PRGO due for some news on Starwood increasing ownership and putting more pressure on management to divest divisions and get stock up to 150+. Sale of royalty rights for around 3 billion will get the ball rolling soon.
