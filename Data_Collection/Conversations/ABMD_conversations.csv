Sky is now the limit. Will be interesting to watch if chart technic works here. 400 would be the next resistance
"We, in the medical field use Impella all the time. No other device comes close to supporting an acutely injured heart. Usage in cardiac ICU an OR is increasing. Just a matter of time with new trial results earnings and stock will rise back to previous highs."
"I’ve never seen a stock with solid fundamental (FDA approvals, respectable growth profile, sound financials) move like a broken stock... until ABMD. I am still averaging down. Gone this far with this stock (since 290s). I hope one of the bigger boys like Medtronic will acquire it. I dont see other way out. It has fallen despite every positive headlines."
"From ZACK April 9, 19ABIOMED, Inc.engages in the research, development, and sale of medical devices to assist or replace the pumping function of the failing heart. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 3.7% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 106.1%, higher than the Medical - Instruments industry’s rise of 17.7%. The company has outperformed the broader industry in the past two-year period (+127.7% vs +37.4%)."
I believe there are also study results that show Impella much more favorable for patient outcomes than Balloon. Part of the problem possibly is proficiency of Users to deliver Impella correctly.But you are correct. Sale growth has slowed slightly. They have missed slightly on last 2 QTRs. The stock was arguably overpriced at $450. But sure seems to be oversold @ $165.Next QTR results are Key. Impella 5.5 may be a plus in guidance because that is coming online now or soon and has great potential
Pretty much as expected - solid execution. I do not see a reason for a big move because of ER. Should prosper with rising sales/ profits....
Abmd may want to buy iinn.
could be employees cashing in stock options
so back to 280 or less.Was a nice try to push to 400 but the reality it was just a technical reaction from algos....volumen was very low on high days (>350) so the traders left now!
"New Seeking alpha article about ABMD ""Abiomed: Impella Will Continue To Drive Revenue Growth"""
another fda approval..
"Shorts are very stubborn on this stock. They have been trying to get it to $150 since the big drop months ago. The low daily average volume allows them to just kick back and control the trading price. This stock has made multiple failed attempts to get in the $200 range but every time it has some momentum, a re-print short article pops up to scare new buyers and attract more shorts. This stock just drip under $155 for the shorts to cover and move on.or big buyers on the ask for a few days keeps this over $225 and force them to cover.For now, it's a tight range between $175 and $196 until something changes it."
Mmmh isn't moving at all after breaking resistance...no Volumen again. Need news for flying to 400
Next stop 400!
FYI TO ALL. THE MAJOR DROP IN THE LAST WEEK IS DUE TO THE SHIFT IN MARKET RISKS AND RETURNS. HEDGE FUNDS ARE FAVORING MUCH HIGHER GROWTH COMPANIES LIKE MDB ZS AND OKTA VS SLOW GROWTH MED DEVICE INDUSTRY COMPANIES.
So unpredictable for a stock rated strong buy. Hard to believe this was trading 450 6 months ago
"I have owned shares of Abiomed at $18 and bought as high as $369 and back down to its current range of $176-$178. It has been painful to watch the stock fall from highs of $450; of course in hindsight I wish to have sold more shares on the way down. My optimism for buying on the way up was the product itself, Impella is one of the most innovative and significant devices in the Cardiovascular/Heart failure space today. I still feel the same about the device, but at these levels and a market cap around 8B Abiomed now presents itself as a viable buyout . At a 14-16B price tag Abiomed could be an attractive and very doable takeover for companies such as Abbott, who is building their Heart Failure space (acquisition of St Jude) or Phillips, who would benefit from integration of the Impella hardware in their cath lab systems (similar reason Siemens recently bought Corindus Vascular Robotics). In addition, Abiomed who be a great fit for Boston Scientific or Medtronic providing relevance to their coronary portfolios. Bottom line, if Abiomed continues to falter and management can not provide any confidence to the market and soon a buyout will be in their future."
i have not a good feeling going into ER.This will likely go back to low 300 / high 200 after ER.A touch to $400 would be epic but we all know ABMD tanks usually at ER
We are breaking 355 resistance! Looks good! Let's go for a closure above it. Bullish!
got back in and added a few shares at 250. I have been trading this stock for about 4 yrs. solid company that will work it way back up to $400. they have little competition and are at the top of their game.
