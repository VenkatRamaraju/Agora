Fanh is up too fast and too much. It is very expensive and high risk at this level.

"A CEO and founder only had 1.8% of the shares? Why? and why is he still controlling the company? Only under pressure of lawsuit, he bought some shares!!"
FANH reached a new All Time High at 28.91
Why doesn't anyone post here?
"Reading the latest report, I was shocked that CEO only had ~1% of the company shares!! Not much of confidence about his own company. Only after the big drop on Auguest 27th, he and the CFO bought some shares, under the pressure!!Does not bode well and feels fishy!"

"Reading the lastest earning report, the operating income and the net income looked very good. The increase in operating margin and net margin were very impressive. The operating income expectation of RMB80.0 million for the next quarter (Q1 2018) were equally impressive, compared to the previous quarter expectation of RMB60.0 million (for Q4 2017) and RMB50.0 million (for Q3 2017). Nowadays, it not easy to find such a very-high-growth company that also pays good dividend. It is too bad that the dividend ($0.20 per ADS) for this quarter is not increased."

"scorpion capital historyLast 4 shorts $NVRO after the short in mid dec, price is still up (false report)$ALLK after the short in mid dec, price is still up (false report)$AXGN (must check, it was more then 50% up)$FANH https://scorpioncapital.com/This company is a liar, the screenshot they used in the report is there from December on the company website. They can now short because there is a lot of free float in the market, he dare to short when equity was 50M only."
"Report is hard to figure, but Fanhua expects its operating income to be no less than RMB80.0 million for the first quarter of 2018. Total operating income for FY2017 was 273. So that would be about 320 for FY18. Not a ad increase in operating income."

"Just read that China insurance industry was growing at more than 20% in 2017 due to GDP growth and low insurance penetration rate. This company just need to ride the wave and grow with the industry, and its stock price will do well. It is added bonus if it can grow faster than the industry. Of course, seeing this kind of growth rate, new competitors will join in and intensify the competition."

"Anyone watch this stock at all?I know this is a Chinese stock and I'm very leery of that, but unless I'm reading it wrong the statistics indicate this is greatly undervalued. 1.55B in cash, 189M debt, positive cash flow and earnings, book value indicates around $28/share if it were liquidated. What am I missing?"

"As investors of this stock, what is your opinion about the “521” plan just announced?"

Any thoughts regarding the 20 percent drop in two days
"With 2017 earning per ADS of $1.13 and projected 2018 earning growth of more than 40%, what would be the fair price for this stock?"
