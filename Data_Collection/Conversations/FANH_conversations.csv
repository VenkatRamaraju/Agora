"Just read that China insurance industry was growing at more than 20% in 2017 due to GDP growth and low insurance penetration rate. This company just need to ride the wave and grow with the industry, and its stock price will do well. It is added bonus if it can grow faster than the industry. Of course, seeing this kind of growth rate, new competitors will join in and intensify the competition."

"Anyone watch this stock at all?I know this is a Chinese stock and I'm very leery of that, but unless I'm reading it wrong the statistics indicate this is greatly undervalued. 1.55B in cash, 189M debt, positive cash flow and earnings, book value indicates around $28/share if it were liquidated. What am I missing?"

"Reading the lastest earning report, the operating income and the net income looked very good. The increase in operating margin and net margin were very impressive. The operating income expectation of RMB80.0 million for the next quarter (Q1 2018) were equally impressive, compared to the previous quarter expectation of RMB60.0 million (for Q4 2017) and RMB50.0 million (for Q3 2017). Nowadays, it not easy to find such a very-high-growth company that also pays good dividend. It is too bad that the dividend ($0.20 per ADS) for this quarter is not increased."

"I just noticed that 1y Target Est has been raised to $35.5 in this Yahoo site very recently. If I am not mistaken, it was $28.5 not long ago."
"Reading the latest report, I was shocked that CEO only had ~1% of the company shares!! Not much of confidence about his own company. Only after the big drop on Auguest 27th, he and the CFO bought some shares, under the pressure!!Does not bode well and feels fishy!"

"Report is hard to figure, but Fanhua expects its operating income to be no less than RMB80.0 million for the first quarter of 2018. Total operating income for FY2017 was 273. So that would be about 320 for FY18. Not a ad increase in operating income."

"With cash of $7.46/share, book value of $8.93/share, quarter earning of $0.32/share and quarter dividend of not less than 50% of net income, it sounds like a value buy. Of course, the down side is that it is a China company. If it pays the dividend that it claims it will, it will definitely calm all the fears and silent all the critics."
