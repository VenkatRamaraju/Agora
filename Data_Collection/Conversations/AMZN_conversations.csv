"What do you think about when you visit a brick and mortar store? I tend to think ""what a waste of my time, I'll order from AMZN when I get home""."
at least heading to 3500
Loaded up at the close. Excited for tomorrow’s run!
I wonder if Jassy will split the stock to make his mark on the company as CEO......
"Remember when I told you guys to sell everything and buy Amazon, did you guys listen? Check my message history 3 days ago. I got 11 thumbs down by haters and I said hate all you want you guys will see. I am going to say it again inflation around the corner, less spending on luxury items, make sure you guys are buying amazon if not partials. Second time you have been warned."
I love my calls right now
"So it seems to me looking at the chart, that it will retrace by 50% from its recent high/low before it gets a little choppy. Any experienced trader have an opinion on whether it will retrace from its 52 week high or from 7/28 high? Id like to try and play the volatility a bit. Im using the RSI too, thinking it might chop around 50 RSI??"
One more share added don’t mind if I do. If you can’t afford it then partials. Sell everything else we heading for inflation and luxary items will not be bought. You were warned
strong buy
"I just started trading AMZN after the earnings drop expecting a bounce. I've never been one to cry manipulation, but I haven't seen a stock that consistently gets pegged to a narrow trading range and just stays there like this stock does. Either someone is intentionally propping it up, or someone is intentionally holding it down. It's a bit frustrating."
"Shorts are covering, 4,000 year end!"
AMAZON is the most undervalued big tech at the moment !!$3800 by Oct/Nov
I just looked up Amazon’s past 6 months and seen it’s down almost 2%. Does anyone have anything to say about this? For me I’m pretty upset. I truly am shocked that upper management isn’t doing anything for all of us shareholders.
"When you combine the sleeping giant reality of Amazon, with incredible growth on the horizon, a record Christmas coming, and the inevitable split in their back pocket, expect 20%-25% stock price price increase by January/February."
Suggestion for AMZN holders: jump ship to MSFT. best stock of all
Incredible comeback! From down $77 to plus $5. Well done Amazon! Onwards and Upwards! Arriba! 
Buy amazon fractional or partial shares and for crypto vechain (vet-usd) simple yet people want to reinvent the wheel that isn't broken. Cheers.
"I think the move towards more physical stores is a wise one. Amazon looks at others who do well (Costco, Target) and bring in its own, highly sophisticated and automated business model. It is very likely that, in the selected locations where they choose to operate, they will be a strong competitor for Walmart, Costco & Co. These people don't do things haphazardly. They are highly focused and determined to do everything better than the competition. Still, the rewards will come in in years, not days or months."
RSI 29.1…Oversold…expect an upward trend starting next week!Stay long my friends! Long term investor…10-20 yrs
"Sell every single stock you have and buy AMZN, and no this isn't a joke. A little birdie told me. Sell everything and I mean everything not named AMZN. News is coming. AWS was just a sprinkle."
"This is a company built to thrive for years to come , it was thriving before pandemic, through pandemic, has strengthened its position considerably and will thrive through any inflationary environment transitory or not. So many options to defend any lag or sell off. Build stores, buy stores. split stock whatever. If you don't own this, buy it while it's dragging on the floor right now."
GOODNEWS :) The National Security Agency (NSA) has reportedly signed a $10 billion cloud computing service contract with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Green day for AMZN on a down day. Good sign for sure.
"Those who stayed strong during the down phase, congratulations. Do remember to book profit from time to time though."
"Affirm stock $AFRM climbed 40% in Monday’s premarket trading following the company’s tie-up with Amazon $AMZN which will allow it to offer its ‘buy now, pay later’ option to the online retailer’s customers. I love this platform https://stockhaul.today/vsvx4y ! I signed up three years ago and so glad I did with all of the innovations they are coming out with. It is really an important tool to use everyday for traders. I have found no better tool on the market and i have used a lot of them."
So far amazon has done nothing to help the shareholders. not even dividend. How long can you keep this stock? .Not even 3% return for such an expensive stock.
"If AWS was spun off, there would be overnight multi millionaires."
"Will Amazon, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) reach $2 trillion market cap in 2021? See details: https://prem.li/StockMarketToday"
Charts are strong / showing we are gonna to 3500 by end of this week
"AMZN opens its $1.5 billion air hub in Kentucky in latest push to speed deliveriesAmazon on Wednesday opened its $1.5 billion air hub in northern Kentucky, which will help accelerate its push for faster delivery and greater control over its logistics network.https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/amazon-opens-1point5-billion-kentucky-air-hub-in-bid-to-speed-deliveries.html"
"So wow, google is closing in on Amazon price. Got that one wrong "
short squeeze is coming. thank you
"the hurricane that hit the northeastern part of the United States has reset transitory, again every hiccup brings us resetting transitory as we do not have the labor to keep up with the demand and businesses are keeping a tight squeeze on Supply to keep prices High. the reason why I advocate the FED for going to negative rates because those that have been taking care of the most are raising the prices for those who have been taken care of last and that care will be taking away first, same old story for the middle and lower-class continually getting badder"
Recovery will take years unless you believe in unicorns. Look at GOOG and MSFT's growth.. Now they represent real opportunity.
Retail loss due to delta is Amazon gain. Maybe dynamic is changing again
The only thing to pump this share price is a stock split to bring in more investors. It's too high.
I am so happy that I'm not holding a stock that screams SEC Investigation.
"Amazon should advertise more for Wholefoods. There's a space in Wholefoods that is great for coffee, breakfast, lunch or even dinner - a great place for meeting and get together - better than Starbucks, Panera or McDonalds.The grocery prices are comparable with Walmart, Kroger, HEB and other stores. And the stores are neat, clean and well organized. There is a wrong preconception that prices are high at Wholefoods because they sell Organic food but again, prices are comparable - some wines are even cheaper than those at Aldi."
No doubt investment firms are calling it the catch up trade with 10-20% upside and they are all loading it up with predicting it hits 3600-3750 in the catch up trade to other FAANG stocks. Buy here as it fills a gap higher with several block orders over the past several days. Cheapest Faang stock right now and has more room to run to catch the high like all the other faangs.
"Buying amazon now is probably the easiest money to make in he stock market, if you think anyone would sell this with Xmas shopping starting, then you shouldn’t be investing. People are going to be very cautious with flu season coming up combined with the other virus. Quarter 3 will be record breaking"
Jassy finding his footing and settling into the job. We’re just getting starting compadres. Hasta $4000 
"I just closed my position in AMZN___ The last three orders that I placed with them were late... One ordered was changed two times for delivery... With service deteriorating like this and no recompense offered for their failure, I look for another provider such as Walmart, etc to take market share and take it fast..."
"AMZN WILL CONTINUE TO THRIVE. NO FEARALSO, DOCN (Digital Ocean) is another one to have in your portfolio IMO."
better sell your Puts
"I've been very bullish on $AFRM and $SOFI for a few months as they both have been gaining market share at various websites I'd visit. So the $AMZN partnership announcement on Friday was no surprise. I sold my $AFRM over $100 this morning for over 45% gain and moving it to $SOFI and adding even more shares of $JWN under 29....Nordstrom will be back above 38 in the short term in no time. I have also added more shares to $ADSK, which I expect to be back above 340 also in the short term.Keep buying $JWN, $ADSK, $SOFI. Keep holding."
"If you buy this and hold it for around 5+ years it is probably one of the best investments you can make from a risk/reward view. If you are looking to trade it or are complaining about AMZN's movement over a one year period, there are better stocks to trade."
Usually AMZN outperforms my other core holding Alphabet. I'll be patient .
"Amzn is still way oversold on the daily and 195m. 91% of gaps close. If that nasty price gap is filled, whomever is buying is gonna make some serious money"
Wow 50 MA beat! 3600 next!
Thank you Lord for accumulation opportunity at $3250 per share last last week and also am accumulating Russian AMAZON called OZON at $52.50 per share -- ok guys see you all at $4000 per share mark...!!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazon longs…Happy Days are back to stay! On to $4000 soon!
Another jaw dropping Stellar performance from Amazon. Major rotation into this stock well under way as predicted. Still over $300 from its high so long way to go just to get back to that level. We’re on a roll compadres. 
We finally have adults in the white house again. That's good for the economy and good for AMZN.
God bless our troops here and abroad God bless our people who should be taking the responsibility under the Second Amendment to protect this country from within.
Look for a Rebound $gme $amc $tsla $amzn $xela $sonn
"Now that today’s monthly options expiration manipulation is over, next week might be good for suffering AMZN bulls!!! Getting back over the 200 DMA at 3250 is next!"
"be nice if AMZN could break down today to around $3,350. I'd like to buy a few shares, but not at the current price."
"Michael is obviously the best I invested $3k and he made me profit of over 21,000 US dollars for me in just 14days. I was so amazed with his brilliant and unique strategies in earning"
Never ordered Amazon Fresh before the pandemic .........I now order Amazon Fresh half of the time I shop for groceries..........Never ordered Pantry stuff from Amazon before the Pandemic......I now order canned and dry food on Amazon regularly .....
"What do you think about when you think of Amazon? I tend to think about their trucks and how I get packages almost every day. AMZN e-commerce segment op income averaged 2.2% over the last 10 years. Real growth, and margins, are in Digital Advertising, AWS, healthcare and logistics. AWS could hit $100b by 2023. AMZN spends billions each year on fulfillment. A AMZN dept store chain would reduce costs, ie, custs could pu there products there, AMZN could move warehouses full of slow, discontinued and open boxed product, etc. AMC could make sense, and AMZN would give away tickets . . . to Prime Members, and they would air some of their movies, and drastically cut prices . . . all for about the amount of $ they paid for MGM.AMZN is on sale now: ""AVG"" PT is 28% after 1.29% today and 8/20 analyst said if you based val on Discounted Future Cash Flow 12 mo PT would be $4,735."
It’s Key Lime Pie Time here in the FLA! The Key Conchs are celebrating. Vamos Amazon! 
Imagine if one day amazon said we are going to spinoff twitch or spinoff aws or blue origin or anything like that. That would be cool
The future of Amazon is AWS. Higher margins and faster growth. Jassy is the perfect CEO for the next 20 years.
"72 year old investor with too much time on my hands...Let me ask....Would any of you guys think your children's lives had been well spent if they had ""given their lives for their country"" ?"
"For anybody that still does not get it: Dividends are not paid with earnings. Dividends are paid with cash. That cash usually comes from free cash flow, of which Amazon has mucho. The same goes for the billions Amazon invests in expansion. Short at your own risk."
"Regret selling $NVDA and Buying $AMZN. There is nothing that can move this stock. Atleast, I am still holding my substantial $NVDA investment."
"YTD return, including 2.15% today, is still only 5.05%. Essentially 6% return since 7/13/2020. . . a full year. The longer the base, the higher in space (see below).SA article today: ""Based on the consensus estimates, we estimate it's (AMZN's) worth $4,847 today on a 12-month forward basis. That's a 32% discount to fair value and 46% upside to fair value."""
"Always alway buy AMZN on big dips, always always !"
Open is Retail and close is Wall Street. We will see if we can lock in these gains for the day. Really need to see AMZN over $3500 and soon. Really been lagging all year long.
Away we go
With the going rate of carbon tax being 50.00 per ton and this tax being written into the latest budget plan; will Amazon regret their decision not to reduce carbon emissions and instead increase it by 18% to 60million metric tons in 2020?
$ESGC highly undervalued. Amazon already inked some deals with it and some region specific deal underway. Buy some ESGC stock now as it will bring huge revenues to Amazon in future...Save ESGC from shorts
AMZN isn’t meant for trading it is meant for owning. If you are not putting all your money into amazon and are playing it risky with random nonsense just remember inflation means less luxury goods so if you own a share of a company with luxury goods then good luck next earnings. Keep buying amzn keep accumulating they can weather any storm.
"Mini distribution centers for the last mile in core areas. Implement heavy tech to solve solutions. Grocery, healthcare, walkout cashierless technology and drone delivery for those who order online. Amzn will continue to disrupt."
Amazon Fresh delivered to my door twice a week I’ll never go to regular grocery store again !
THANK YOU FOR YOUR MONEY SHORTY
$3300 tastes really really sweet. Like a fine key lime pie that we have here in the Florida Keys. Delectable and Delicioso. Vamos Amazonas! 
"AMZN SMASHING SHORTS. Call buyers celebrating ALSO, DOCN (Digital Ocean) will become a triple digit stock IMO."
Did you cost average down from last earnings? Buying at 3180 was sweet. Time to make money. Buying more Friday.
Jassy should raise the price of Prime.ASAP. It’s way too cheap. He would get no resistance and the stock would get a nice big pop. Wait for it it’s coming. 
"Saw this posted on SeekingAlpha by user Doug- . What do you think of his analysis? Since I am long on AMZN, naturally I liked the way he has done the math, but am interested in other perspectives. "".... Sales projections are reliable and since the projected rate per year compounded is 25% then in 5 years Amazon will be trading at $9,773 a share. Using Cash Flow which is also predictive at 31% annual compounded projected return and projecting that 5 years ahead you get $12,354 a share. Take the average of the 2 and you get a price of $11,063 a share. That should be the median price in 5 years time, which is a compounded forwarding return of 28.14% per annum."""
"On July 10, 2020, AMZN closed at $3,220. On August 10, 2021, AMZN closed at $3,320. Congratulations to shareholders: We have earned an average of $1.79 cents per week over a 56-week period. Amazon may be a fantastic company, but it's been a terrible investment for much too long."
I bought another share at $3200. I was hoping it fell below $3k but I took what I could get. Owning shares of AMZN is a no-brainer long term. $4200 by Jan ‘22. Buy and HOLD long term…you will not lose sleep over owning shares in this powerhouse of a company!
I urged the company to buy back... I guess
I wouldn't short this but would sell em if I had them.
Rotation into Amazon continues 
"Last two times that AMZN dipped down to the 200 MDA area, it SOARED + 300 in two weeks. Hopefully this is the start for another + 300!!!!!"
accumulation
The thing is if both wmt and tgt are seeing slowing online sales its because amzn is eating their lunch! How many amzn trucks do you see around your neighborhood? Yet we fall on their sentiments! I think we are seeing a helluva opportunity here...
buying opportunity
"Oh boy, everyone is signing up to run their business on the AWS!Really undervalued even at $4000/share!Any day now, this will pop big time and for a longer period.Long term 10-20 yrs!!!"
Buy AMZN buy Vechain dump thousands of dollars let’s do this boys and girls
"Congratulations, those that were patient..you deserved this week"
Kabul fulfillment center is down that's the reason Amzn down today.
"New PT. Some analysts are very sharp and some are not. It’s the investor’s job to distinguish between the two. 8/20/21 Seeking Alpha - Ben Howard – Now May be the Time to Add Amzn – is a well-researched and well-presented valuation and DFC PT. He states you can’t compare AMZN to just one competitor to determine the right P/E and EV/S (Enterprise Value to Sales): AMZN is too diversified. So he compares it to 4 competitors: GOOG (cloud & advertising), WMT (retail/wholesale – online & stores), BABA (online retail, coud, subscriber services) and EBAY (3rd party svces).His conclusion is that AMZN could hit $4,377 next year, a 37% upside. When he looks at their valuation based on discounted Future cash flows, then it’s almost 48% (almost $4,735).RSI 28.79 . . . technically oversold."
"sell your Puts, its green this week"
What has really been in the news as one of the most profitable investments? I really wanna understand much about one
"See you at 10,000"
all the information you needed how to make the decision to hold fast and stay in Afghanistan was presented as the orders to withdraw were giving you're not taking into consideration the Americans and Afghan allies that would be left behind with no protective safe zones to the airport
"AMZN is being viewed as a safe have stock, today. Like AAPL."
Bully bully…AMZN didn’t I say last week that the uptrend will start this week?AMZN is the best stock to own…will be a lot higher when they start paying dividends after next earnings report!Longs always win!!!10-20yrs
"Based on 30 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for Amazon in the last 3 months. The average price target is $4,214.13 with a high forecast of $5,000.00 and a low forecast of $3,775.00. The average price target represents a 25.81% change from the last price of $3,349.63."
"Bezo should stop pursuing space business since he is too behind Elon, in my opinion. Don’t waste money and energy on space . You will never catch him. My advice to him is to concentrate in his primary role , e-commerce, aws, commercial, streaming etc. I quest that I’m not able to convince him. I plan to reduce amzn shares and invest in other growth stocks."
"If the new CEO and BOD of Amazon have not discussed the AMZN share price going nowhere over the past year and the need to create more shareholder return by splitting the stock, I’d be very surprised. The topic of a split must be “on the table” but the question is NOT if the stock will split, but when. I would expect a rally similar to TSLA and NVDA after a split announcement."
"AMZN and MSFT dominating the Cloud, but DOCN (Digital Ocean) is another stock to have in your portfolio IMO."
With Toyota reducing their production output by 50% based on supply chain problems as well as lowered demand outlook; how well can we expect Rivian to perform as a startup in a rather overcrowded industry?
"If we go back to the way shoppers operated prepandemic, where does that put the shares? Below $3,000?"
"500,000 shares trades to the BUY side in last 10 minutes of trading. Stock up, also, after hours."
"AMZN heading back to all time highs..........I almost added more......but my holdings are so big already that I needed it down another 5% from the highs before the Limit Buy triggered.......oh well, I will enjoy the ride back in any case..."
Did the President of Afghanistan own a lot of AMZN stock?
I really think that there is nothing wrong with AMZN here to warrant the selloff but this is attributed to the technicals. The chart is very ugly but fundamentally I think its strong. Also the big boys are taking advantage of the summer doldrums when volume is low and easy to manipulate the action.
Scrap the infrastructure Bill and start over do not allow anything to be attached like outlandish spending that we have no idea no bill no wording no idea what the spending will be for
Closed out the 2 puts I sold for a mini loss. I prefer to use options than shares with Amzn.No conviction in the bid yet. Can’t wait with options. Want see strong day with no fade.RSI = 27-28. Oversold

beautiful chart running up early before earnings in October
Set it and forget it.
Today 3380-3400!
"Up on heavy volume today. Bears be sweating..,"
"Based on the amount of capital expenditures during the past 15 months on building logistics as well as equipment leases,up 74% from previous year, this company is still growing. Any thoughts?"
3400 end of week
"Amazon does not want to be a department store. Amazon does not want to buy Kohl's. Amazon's history is to be selective, start small, set targets and not expand if they are not met. Amazon has proved their physical store ability with a carefully-placed convenience stores. They have a trove of data to allow them to locate and merchandise where they can make good margins. The other department stores blanket the country, and that is their model, but it is not Amazon."
Just bought 10 AMZN stocks. Get in tell your friends and family we not messing around. There is something special brewing.
"For the last 21 years I have kept telling myself that Amazon was too expensive. Around one week ago, I have gone in big (for me) with around EUR60,000 in AMZN now in the game. It seems to me that, given the fundamentals, this stock is now, believe it or not, cheap. Also, not interested in what happens in the short term, like 36 or 48 months. I am in for the long haul and will ride this tiger for the next 12, 15 years or more, which is my retirement age horizon. AWS is cleaning up. The retail part goes from strength to strength and can count on the backup from the AWS-generated cash flow. The other sectors are also prospering. This one's a keeper and fair price at 3300. If it goes down at 2800 I will buy more, but honestly I don't see it happening."
Cramer just said cvs Wal-Mart and target are better than dark star AMZN time to buy more amzn
"Done commenting here and done looking. I will not mention my purchases here anymore. Analysts talking smack as usual, people placing puts, government manipulation, and jealousy/haters. So from now on the amount of amazon shares I buy will be private. Overall I have $2.1K average price so not sweating. Just give me some time almost payday."
The sleeping Giant has awakened. Well done Amazon. Setting ourselves up for a great last quarter and massive run up. IMHO 
People who aren't buying now going to be sorry. You trying to nickel and dime for $10 lol. Good luck all investors. The good news is yet to come after hours. Don't say you weren't warned because now you read this message.
COME ON GIVE US 3500
If we can close out the year above $4000 that would make my year. I am retiring Jan 6 so I am counting on AMZN. By far my largest holding.
"Amazon is after the best of BestBuy, Walmart, Kohl's and Target and they'll get it. I bought my latest iPad from Amazon because it was available and at the lowest price. Trying to order from ATT was a joke and Apple had none available.See you at 10,000"
Does anyone think Amazon will ever split the stock?
"Published today:“Finally, Cramer called out Amazon (AMZN) - Get Report, a stock which many investors now see only as a pandemic stock. But the truth is that Amazon Prime is now a staple of many households and that isn't going to change anytime soon. Cramer said that Prime is a steal at any price and that's why Amazon also belongs in your portfolio.”"
"whtas up with Cramer now he bushing Amazon when at 3700 buy buy now what guy ,,,"
"With the eps less than 10 and the ad and Aws booming , I don’t know why people not buying."
Looking forward for AMZN rebuilding strength to make up the 350 point punishment after last earning report chaos. Now is a huge buying opportunity to get into AMZN at discount price..
Great Day Amazon. Keep the momentum going Andy. Hasta $4000! 
10 for 1 split announcement during earnings call next quarter.
AMZN back to $3400 this week!Strong AWS performance will take this to $4000 by January 2022!Now is the time to buy more AMZN…it’s on Sale!
"Great article in Seeking Alpha today - 6 Reasons Amazon Is Set To Soar And Too Cheap To Ignore - ""Amazon's hyper-growth is expected to continue thanks to the fact that its two fastest-growing businesses are AWS and advertising with operating margins of 30% and 75%, respectively, according to Piper Jaffrey. In the next 5 years, analysts think Amazon could potentially quadruple to $12,800 per share. . . "" ""For 20 years, investors consistently paid 24-26x operating cash flow. That means 25x cash flow is a conservative intrinsic value estimate for Amazon. It’s currently trading at 20.5x forward cash flow—at a wonderful price given its quality and growth potential."""
Yet again another breathtaking day for Amazon as the rotation into this fantastic company continues. And then to top it off Amazon makes that blockbuster announcement of its “Buy Now Pay Later” partnership with Affirm. The news keeps getting better and better for Amazon. Giddy Up!!

To buy 3 shares of AMZN today or tomorrow hmm decisions decisions.
Look for a Rebound $tsla $sprt $amzn $taop
"Amazon (AMZN Stock) shares have risen 80% of the time over the following monthAfter Amazon’s second-quarter earnings were announced, the stock fell around 9% after the company missed on Wall Street’s expectations. However, one of Amazon’s weapons is their Amazon Web Services (AWS). This is a way of bringing Amazon’s expertise in operating a massive computer infrastructure to market. AWS revenue has been growing faster recently, so will that help Amazon move higher in line with its strong seasonal pattern?Over the last 15 years, Amazon has risen 80.00% of the time between August 18 and September 19 with an average return of +6.15%. The largest gain was in 2011 with a 32.42% gain. The largest loss was in 2020 with a -10.63% loss."
"To illustrate the barriers to entry one would have to overcome to directly compete with AMZN one way to determine them is to look at the amount of patents AMZN owns. The number of patents they own is a staggering 11,000. So one would have to make sure not to infringe on even 1 of those 11000 patents to try and build a better mousetrap than AMZN. Of course that's just one of things indicating how dominant AMZN is but it is quite telling when one wants to determine the difficulty of taking on AMZN directly."
$3700 coming back again and then $4000. Get ready!!!
"This is what Warren Buffets talks about , if you buy a company at a discounted rate , you are set to make a good return in the future. I belive comparing the entire year , this is a discounted price,"

We continue to view Amazon as one of the best positioned businesses globally, with its share price still not reflecting fair value."""
"Amazon just invested Millions into its cloud based services the past 15 months.

"my birthday present last year was buying 1 share at $2.9k. Not much but I’m glad I invest in a company that does everything! Yes, it’s been rocky for amzn this year, but I still believe we can see $3.9k by the eoy!!"

"Buying amazon now, is like buying sears in 1920!! They going to print money for the next 50 years!!"
10 shares just added. Special news incoming keep buying partial or full shares thank me later.
"On July 10, 2020, AMZN closed the trading day at its then all-time high of $3,200. In the ensuing 280 trading sessions over a one year, one month and eight day period, the stock has returned a $1.22 profit. Unfortunately, long-term capital gains is going to reduce that to 72 cents, but at least I can still buy one US postage stamp and have 17 cents left over."
"I shorted Amzn, Googl, and Aapl. Very bad decision down big today."
"Even with a $1.6 trillion current market valuation, Amazon might be a bargain based on its cloud business alone. Growth at Amazon Web Services is accelerating, and revenue from the unit could hit an annualized $100 billion by 2023. Valuing that business at, say, 15 times sales (most cloud application companies fetch higher valuations than that), gives you a market cap of $1.5 trillion, meaning that investors are getting Amazon’s e-commerce business and its nascent advertising business almost for free."
"$3,299.95 = Friday's close. Then up another 100 to the next week's option period end."
"Opening large ""department stores"" at 30,000 sf is not large. They need to open 300,000-600,000 sf warehouse stores. Then look out Costco."
"For those of you an here who are raving about Amazon's ""great customer service"", please allow me to share with you my latest interaction with said company. Mind you, I'm not trying to intentionally badmouth Amazon or anything, I even have 20 shares in my portfolio.My birthday was the 17th of last month so I decided to treat myself and order the $740 Samsung G7 monitor. Was promised an Amazon Prime 2-day delivery date of Monday the 16th; perfect just in time for my BD. On the 16th I got an email saying that my delivery has been postponed until Wed the 18th. So I gave them two more days... No present on my BD :-( Come the 18th, I got another email saying that my order has been canceled & my package will no longer be arriving and that I'll be getting a refund. At this point I was just livid and called Amazon customer service. They never gave me a definitive answer as to why they just up and canceled my order. I have a suspicion that they never processed the order in the first place... I asked Amazon what are they going to do to rectify the situation after they went and put me thru this hell, especially on my birthday week. They said they're not going to do anything and that ""they'll just refund my money"" and pretend like nothing bad happened. I told them: ""Oh BLEEP no! That's not good enough!"" They finally relented and gave me a $35 credit off of my next order. After I hung up with them, I went back on the site and reorder the same monitor and was promised another delivery date of Friday the 20th. When I got home late on the 20th I was expecting the package to be either sitting in the delivery storage locker in the building lobby or at the very least on door step. Checked my email and was greeted with an email saying that the package has been delivered with a picture of package sitting ON TOP OF THE DELIVERY LOCKER instead of inside a locked locker. I immediately said to myself: Oh bleeping bleep bleep. They left an expensive monitor sitting in plain sight on top of the locker where anyone can just walk into the lobby and reach up to take the package!!!I must have broken a world record rushing from my place down to the lobby. Thankfully, when I got to the storage locker the package was still sitting on top and no one has managed to steal it yet. If I had left that package there for another hour or so then it would have been stolen for sure.Moral of the story: Amazon's customer service is not the stellar service that it used to be. And that when you order something from Amazon, expect it to either not arrive on time or expect it to get stolen!"
Wal Mart has the shop lifting and AMZN has the service so I think we know who wins in the long run
What’s our price target this week?
"1 year performance: MSFT +41%, FB +35%, AAPL + 27%, TSLA +79%, GOOG + 75.5%, trash NFLX + 12.5%, .... AMZN -2.5% LOOOOOOOOOOL"
small green steps will take us back to 52 week high. Hang in there. Super long!
is this goin to split any time soon? Want to buy in but cant buy fractional shares
$3300.00 today. $4000.00 eoy
Fantastic resilience on a brutal day for Nasdaq. Looks like the beginnings of a rotation back into Amazon. ‘Bout Time! 
Buy fractional shares if you can’t afford one whole share. I really hope this doesn’t split so that only a select few own it kind of like berkshire. Splitting any less than $4k is dangerous and that is why they haven’t done it for you children who keep saying split and making it overvalued by splitting. If you are buying amazon in hopes of making a quick buck go buy other junk. We slowly rising every year just check the charts. Keep adding every dip.
AFRM went up too high. the deal benefits Amazon too. besides amazon stock is just stagnant for an year. that too after blockbuster earnings qtr after qtr. Amzn should have jumped 5-10% too

Jassy was at the capital yesterday discussing cyber security. I love how the govt. wants to break up big tech but then wants there help and $ amazing only in the USA
"Walmart PE 42, Amazon PE 55, not hard to figure which one to buy."
"CAN’T KEEP AMZN DOWN TOO LONG. ALSO, PICK UP SOME DOCN (Digital Ocean) as well imo."
"Is It Time to BUY Amazon? Fox Business News guest, Jeff Sica, says ""down 15% last few months hasn't participated in the rally....now going into brick & mortar....a stock that cannot be stopped....market cap makes it very attractive....next few months could break ALL TIME HIGH and into the 4,000 mark....may acquire a brick & mortar....put many out of business and now may acquire"""
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"I am currently on the fence about buying more Amazon. I believe it's a good opportunity here. However, I bought Amazon years ago and don't want to average up. "
"If the economy is really booming, why would anyone do $50 purchase pay over time ? something doesn't add up."
What in the world is going on? 2.5% on no news day? What is driving this?
Remember when I told you guys dump everything into Amazon? Check my messages. Dump everything into amazon get rid of all your other stocks. If you are looking for cryptocurrency buy vechain (vet-usd). You are all very welcome. Hurry and buy both before too late. Invest at your own risk whatever you can afford.
Collapse of OnlyFans will force thots to migrate to $AMZN- Twitch which is bullish for $CRSR.
"What baffles me is that Amazon is tanking day after day and Motley Fool swears by the 1 stock they would buy. Amazon has made a fundamental mistake by forecasting to make pandemic level sales, as we open lockdowns there is reduced interest in purchasing off Amazon. So atleast 2021 and 2022 will be massive pains as expectation will not be met each year. Not to forget the massive cash outlay planned to expand growth in UK."
