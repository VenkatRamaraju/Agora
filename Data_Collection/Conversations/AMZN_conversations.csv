"Someone posted the other day that the stock is simply out of favor. I believe that. I sold 2/3rds of my shares at $3,700 a long time ago (dumb luck and not wanting to be greedy - and making $1,000 a share profit), and I sold my last 1/3rd at 3 pm today. Even if the company had made estimates, the stock just has a bad track record of going down on good news. I still feel it is one of the best companies on the planet, but if the S&P 500 can beat it by 35% (?) in the last 12 months, why have that kind of risk on a single stock when you can buy the S&P 500 index — and not worry about what Amazon is going to do after the bell? I realize that’s just too conservative investing for many people. I own lots of individual stocks, but I still benchmark them in their industry and against the Dow and S&P. If they trail for too long, I make a change — but everyone has different financial situations, goals, and time horizons. I really appreciate reading everyone’s comment on Amazon. My wife and I buy a ton of stuff from the company. Think how much time, gas, and mileage we have saved on our cars, in the past four years by not going out to stores as often."
"UPS’s earnings heavily relied on Amazon’s uptick in demand for online shopping. Not only did they manage to beat earnings and revenue on all top line forecasts, but they did so while battling rising costs, inflation, and a shortage of workers. With Amazon announcing they now deliver more packages than FedEx, it’s quite near impossible that we see Amazon miss this quarter. Not only do I expect a beat when Wall Street expects a drop in earnings, I expect the Supply Chain Crisis to have caused a huge uptick in demand for Amazon products and services. Amazon’s stock has been flat all year, not posting significant gains, this could be the quarter that solidifies Amazon’s return to shareholders this year. Can’t wait for the 29th!!!"
"We will know at the end of the day. Jassy pulled a RopeDope last quarter downplaying 3rd quarter. Lets see if he was setting up for a big beat by lowering expectations. Amazon has doubled it's fulfillment network over the last 18 months. AWS is king of the cloud, Amazon music has quietly become of of the largest streaming music services, Ads are going up. etc etc etc."
AMZN is taking care of their business; they are expanding for delivering +$400B goods and services on a consistent basis. They are investing. They are preparing for even larger number of prime members and faster delivery. That is exactly what they should be doing. I don't care a bit about this drop. Holding.
"The analysts already had a lot this supply chain/labor costs built in with most revising targets earlier in October. The one year target still averages $4,180, low target $3,775 and a high of $5,000. While most any business that focuses on the sales of goods are struggling through this reopening of the economy here's the great news for AMZN: Sales for the cloud unit continued to climb sharply, totaling $16.1 billion in the third quarter, up about 39% from a year earlier. Amazon's unit that primarily includes ad sales grew by 50%.Expect cloud and ads to be an ever increasing portion of revenue and profit!"
"10 Signs of an impending buyout!1. Dead silence from management and IR on all fronts for months.2. Multiple amazing trial data releases in June of 2021.3. Licensing deal and cash from December of 2020 with $200 million 3DMeds deal.4. Market maker's unwillingness to let it move higher even in the face of outweighing inflow.5. Mass manipulation to push the share price down for accumulation prior to the deal being released.6. S3 ATM offering to shift the balance of the negotiations in SLS favor with cash on hand vs bidder.7. Three open positions on the website that still haven't been filled, also another bargaining chip vs the bidder.8. Not a single negative data release yet constant down pressure vs comparable companies.9. Institutions like Vanguard, Blackrock, and Susquehanna are still loaded big given the size of the float.10. Existing relationships and trials with Roche, Merck, Bristol-Myers, and 3DMeds.$XBI $AAPL $AMZNShow Less"
"After all the negative reports, AMZN only down 1.85% today. Bullish signal…$4100 at EOY.Buy the dip and stay long my friends!AWS alone will be bigger than TSLA!"
"AWS is the real reason AMZN will blow up in the future. 16.11B a Q, growing at a 30-40% CAGR is insane. My predictions are below.We all know the stock needs a split, but instead I believe they will do a spin off instead. AMZN is using AWS right now to build its infrastructure for retail services and once that becomes stable enough they will spin off AWS.With all the Retail services AMZN plays in + Digital adversing (growing at really fast pace) that alone is still a trillion dollar company (still $AZMN). Here comes the spin off ($AWS): AWS is producing 16.11B a Q, If AMZN can get that up to 25B a Q that is another trillion dollar company by its-self. I get that valuation by looking at other tech companies. 25B a Q is 100B a year and with margins of 30-40% they can easily trade 10X sales. (100B X 10 = 1T company spin off).To compare that: AMD is around $4-5B a Q ($14B a year), growing at the same pace as AWS (just my opinion) also trading at 10X sales. So AWS is a huge growth stock within a lower margin retail stock.Current share holders of AMZN when they announce a spin off will either get shares of AWS in a dividend, or be able to buy/trade AMZN shares for AWS shares (At a discount).If you ask me, I'm in this for a long run. Let me know if you guys agree"
The most important number. AWS has seen growth accelerate meaningfully. AWS +39% to 16.11B above the 15.52B consensus.
between the $54 gain before the call yesterday and $70 down today; AMZN lost $20/share. Expect green on Monday. Look at the volume and how much upside buying happened. Clearly undervalued when they expect to sell $140B worth of goods and services in the next quarter. Slight changes will result in at least a few billions in operations cash flow and ending up in very green EPS in Q4. Rivian will turn at least $20B post IPO directly to the balance sheet. Awesome company.
"Amazon will spend billions of dollars to try and manage labour shortages and supply chain issues in the run up to Christmas, it has been reported.The company’s chief executive, Andy Jassy said that the retail giant expected to “incur several billion dollars of additional costs” due to “labour supply shortages, increased wage costs, global supply chain issues, and increased freight and shipping costs.” If you want investment ideas from real knowledgeable traders, check them out at the https://dailytrading.tools/BTFDeBook platform"
AWS is a bright spot for AMZN. They are taking market share from everybody else including Microsoft and Google.
Looks like amazon needs to start paying a dividend. This isn’t a growth stock anymore
"For those fairly new to this, the last 30 hours is the best lesson you will ever have about speculation, and controlling fear and panic. (It's a lesson we all have to learn that only comes from experience. I could write a book on my mistakes when I started out.)"
"WS has all the bears focus on the 1 billion in sales they didn’t make instead of the 110 billion in sales they made, lol. I buy every Friday. Thanks for the cheap shares."
"Will someone please help me understand why AMZN is $300 less than last quarter and has hardly grown in the last year, yet has shown incredible gains as well as helped so many buyers around the world during the last 18 months of Covid? Not to mention all the Prime movies, AWS, cloud, etc.? Appreciate your input."
Isn’t it funny how the stock plummeted past $100 after hours before the news of earning was disseminated to the masses? Like some people already had the info….
"eh obviously nobody going to liquidate a position in one of the top 5 stocks in the world over a bad earnings report and guidance, but there will be some dumping due to the opportunity cost calculus, and with no foreseeable upward catalysts in the short term, fairly safe bet that today's negligible movement is a shoring up of the exits, and the filing out begins in earnest next week."
the real reason why this is tanking today is because i bought it yesterday
Heavy open Put Options at $3350 helping today. Will probably close about that...
