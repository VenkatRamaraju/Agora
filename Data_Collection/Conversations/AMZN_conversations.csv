Another successful flight!! ... William S. said it was more than he could have expected!
I can taste 3400
I am buying AMZN at the open. Some in pre market and the 2nd chunk at 9.30 AM ET. I know eps/revenues keep growing year over year. Correction will come quick this week. AMZN 4500 will come
AMZN needs to split so more retail investors can afford the stock.
"I said it, $60 to $100 jumps coming, it's here. On a weekly basis expect $150/share up. Better cover your short position before it's too late. Losing money should not be an emotional decision. Your short decision did not work. Come out of it."
Rivian going public should give AMZN a nice bit of profit to the bottom line. They own a nice chunk of them.
"Everyone is selling stocks right now, so they can pay a ton of taxes and buy back at a higher price later. Genius."
Any books to recommend?
"Amazon will be launching food delivery in a few months. They will own this sector with their built-in distribution network. Short home delivery services that won't be able to complete and grocery stores, buy AMZN."
Amazon brought the market from red to green today. Keep shorting bears.
Come on AMZN you can do it. Lets see $3500 in the rear view mirror.
"Andy low balled this quarter to deliver a surprise. Guidance for the next quarter will be awesome due to black Friday, Christmas shopping, India holidays, etc etc. AMZN will see $4000 before year end. Once it takes off, no stopping it."
3700 just before earnings
I’ve seen this story before. $AMZN will finish red today.
Dr frog is short for sure 
how is it that there's these homeless kids on the street for over a year when there's been a moratorium on mortgages and rents? the moratorium on mortgages that is a breach of contract a negative rate should be given to the responsible taxpayers of the nation as well as many of the issues that we deal with. There are many Americans that have outstanding ideas about how to fix some of our most intricate issues. but because we are not rich and famous corrupt and in the media is favored we have no voice The Voice of Freedom has been taken by our government and held hostage by our media
"It’s a big game! Amzn was excessively bought by individuals… lot of institutions can’t buy at high prices! For 1.25 years it has been suppressed… by now, most of the commoners have sold for little profit or loss! Now when most feel like selling is the big signal to buy for institutions! This could breakout any day and will not stop until 4400. Good luck!"
Where are we at for AMZN tomorrow? Bullish or Bearish?
"REMMY for president do not increase the debt ceiling do not pass an infrastructure bill it only has numbers tied to it and while those numbers are out of the park now they got one signing it should be six and a half trillion dollars while the real world the real economy it's stuck between the real world and video game worlds are colliding. world of electrification but does it work in the winter? world of traveling into space Joy rides for the billionaires, while real suffering goes on around the country and world. and when the banks are bailed out and businesses are bailed out they are already paid for services rendered therefore why are we continuing to pay on mortgages that have already been bailed out by our government? the banks the businesses they're getting it on both sides for their part in our society and the American taxpayers what's left of the middle class are paying for both sides time for some changes"
Hold forever!!
ain't going down; not repeating the pattern. going up in the closing minutes!
Futures are all up and green. AMZN is accelerating in moving up; outpacing the broader markets. Another $40-$60 day tomorrow? Tighten seat belts!
"stop the culture of dysfunction stop the culture of career politicians and the circle CORRUPTION, do not allow the lifting of the debt ceiling oh, do not pass the outrageous spending in the infrastructure bill that does nothing for the people themselves and is it a huge giveaway and spending spree for the businesses politicians in the circle of corruption"
Oversold based off general market fears completely unrelated to Q3 performance and Q4 forecasts. AMZN is continuing to deliver on their business plan regardless of the noise of the market.
"My 3 largest holdings. AMZN, TSLA, ARK funds. 2 of the 3 are breaking out to the upside. Ark needs to kick it and move up. Retiring in January."
sell sell sell take ur profit now
"To ""oldly"" go where no one has gone before""!! Way to go Shatner; 90 years young and still ""Space Truckin""!! I hope you actually get to go into ""space"" someday."
"yep I added at 3207 and 3212.. I am buying more at dollar scale. AMZN will pop above 5000. All games from hedge funds so they can buy low as now...I am buying more and steal their prey (intention game to buy low), the more we buy this low, he more explosive the short squeeze. FB , INTC or WDC will explode...tic toc"
shorts better cover $4257.00 coming soon to a theater near you bahahahahaha
Secured that contract for a profit!!!! Told y’all just needed about $20 spike!
Erratic after hour movement…it was up 100+ points and suddenly down 200+…anyone noticed? Or it’s a tech glitch?
Tired of this stock. -1.2% one-year performance. There’s better options for sure. This is the weakest performer in my portfolio and not long for it anymore.
I just need a $20 spike top of the morning so i can sell this $3260 CALL option.
Jassy talked down 3rd Quarter earnings and growth in the 2nd quarter meeting. Lets see if his little mental Jujitsu worked. People are shopping for Christmas now so maybe a big earnings surprise and upside for the stock?
"We have watched Google and Amazon aggressively pursue contracts with institutions like the US Department of Defense, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), and state and local police departments. These contracts are part of a disturbing pattern of militarization, lack of transparency and avoidance of oversight."
$4000 by end of year.
Only $119 from its 52 week low. I can’t imagine this will go down too much from here. It could split now that Bezos is out. It was his idea not to split.
"I guess like the kids in Kensington in Philadelphia as well as kids and people around the country have to wait until 2025. how many of them do you think that will make it through the winter? our government has a responsibility here for what they have created until they release emergency funds while there is extension on moratoriums until we can figure everything out, do not extend the debt ceiling do not pass any infrastructure to allow them to continue to spend our money on everything but us"
Martin Pulgatch has a $4400 Christmas targetprice on AMZN>
AMZN is just waiting around.. they could be making a lot more $ if they just split the stock so it's more affordable to more people
Why did jump?
"Let me ask you a question, who on this board would short $AMZN at $860/ share? that is not a typo, at $860/ share it is a PE of 15. The same PE that $BABA was trading at $138/ share. The answer to this question is an amateur short would. All because CNBC told him too. CNBC is no better than a crooked salesman’s trying to take money out of your pocket and transfer it to his. However the amateur short keeps these guys in business. The amateur short will short a quality company at 15 times earnings while growing at 20-30% a year. Only for the reasons that CNBC told them to and their inability to calculate simple valuation metrics has put them in a tough spot today. 1. Cover their position2. Have 3 sleepless nights - Friday, Saturday, Sunday Sleep while standing up amateur short. The amateur short was warned."
"4th quarter is AMZN's quarter. It maybe a tough quarter for everyone but no one does it better than AMZN. Couple years ago AMZN overwhelmed Fedex, USPS, so they started their one last mile delivery. Maye next year we will see Amazon ships bringing stuff from around the world. If you don't walk at Amazons cadence they take it in house and once they perfect it they sell it to the rest of the world. Amazon shipping around the corner?"
Sheesh huge up day on practically everything except this thing.
HEY!!!!!! DID DAVID Forget to BUY Pre-Market...9:30 ...10:30 etc????
This is better than William Shatner’s rocket.
People who comment about Amazon on regular Yahoo News stories think we pay far too much in dividends. Short supply of financial literacy out there in the wastelands.
"Due to number of shares held, GOOG is my largest holding, Amazon is my #2. Today my #2 took big strides toward catching up to my #1. I would be thrilled if #2 surpasses #1 because AMZN rocketed to $4,000."
Do we let it ride over the weekend?Sentiment shifted on a dime with those retail numbers. Next week could be a huge run into earnings?
Sears and Roebuck was the first all-in-one Amazon on the manufacturing side the built this great country and Amazon is on the virtual side that has destroyed all the manufacturing
Going into the Amazon Santa Rally. 4th quarter is Amazons quarter.
"This was nearly 3800, strong Fundamentals here."
I love This Platform https://stockhaul.today/StrengthAlerts ! This is the most amazing piece of software I have ever used. Totally customizable and incredibly powerful. There is very little I want that it doesn't already have.
AMZN to $4000 by year end! Brace yourself!
Thoughts about transitioning out of AMZN and into TSLA? Good idea or stick with AMZN for growth?
Santa Rally this year? Amazon and everyone else are starting Christmas sales early. I remember a time when Christmas shopping started the day after Thanksgiving. Those days are long gone.
Stock split coming..news out.
Amazon is buying jets to fly cargo from China. Cargo is backed up on the west coast for 2 months. I am already buying Christmas gifts.
SOLD most of my shares back when it was $90. I've been buying back since $70. Will hold until it goes back to $80. $CHWY is a market leader and $AMZN could eventually end up buying them if CHWY continues to execute and become more profitable as they have been. GLTA LONGS!!!
I don't think Morgan Stanley understands AMZN is hiring and raising wages out of strength. Their future is so strong they need to hire more people and even the higher wages will not be a problem because of all the extra activity. Also Amazon is one of the more efficient companies in the world. They will be grabbing more market share. Plus AWS is the rising star at AMZN. AWS will contribute more of the bottom line in the future. There is also the Henry Ford affect. Raising wages allows people to spend more money helping them buy their products. Plus is forces other companies to raise wages.
There's a decent rally out there folks and after notching 1.62 % on the 10 year we have backed off to 1.57%. Put another way Amazon was at 3750 when the 10 year was down under 1.4%. Much of all the noise is the inflationary impact of 80 a barrel oil and higher..a lot of higher prices is blind momentum that once started is difficult to reverse on a dime. So let's see what the inflation report has to say.
"heck of a buy low opportunity for $RDW @ 50%+ discount before the news of more major contracts with NASA, $AMZN and others. Great Stock !!!!!!"
Andy says he can do more to help their employees. How about helping shareholders ??
a 10 for 1 split ????? ... 3300 > 330 a share ?
Here we go again...AMZN shooting to $100+ due to split split split
"well since our federal government can't make the minimum payments and is in bankruptcy unless the debt ceiling is lifted, again, after was just lifted not too long ago and you can't seem to get any money out to relieve the mortgages. confidence in our government has been lost for those that are at the mercy of Social Security and or the stock market because of Pensions and other income streams how can we go about our lives paying our mortgage is knowing that social security the market along with all the pensions and income streams for paying said Mortgage Debt will be all but gone and then what are we supposed to do with no Monies until 2025. Here's a suggestion I suggest you tell the mortgage companies to extend the moratorium in till 2025 force majeure you can't pay your bills how do you expect us to pay ours"
Heading to $3700
Wall Street has left New York and the government has allowed them to destroy the rest of the country working virtually. States where people retire are now unaffordable for retirees and those that are in these areas are being driven out by mad traffic overcrowding on your two billions of dollars rushing in transforming affordability for retirees around the country
$4000 by end of year
"Shorted AMZN and will cover tomorrow, FRIDAY. This is how to make $ as long as AMZN is not splitting. Do and repeat every Thurs, covering every Friday."
"Amazon in the buy zone again. Nice little drop to scoop up some more. Earnings around the corner, holidays around the corner, Covid numbers dropping, vaccinations increasing, Merck's pill around the corner."
"It's about time, AMZN. Thanks..."
Q3 earnings report Oct 28- look for AMZN to jump 400 points!
Fun facts. Current price as a percentage from all time high:MSFT -1.6%NFLX -2%GOOG -3.8%NAZ -3.8%AAPL -8.2%AMZN -12.3%Glass half full or half empty?
I’m not an expert. Earning end of the month. Any idea which direction it will go?
Wow good thing I never sold
Don't ever bet against AMZN
AMZN is now splitting.
Earnings will be epic.James Dontino has a $4400.00 target for Christmas.
Amazon's Jassy bought himself a COOKIE! He sandbagged projections ....Analysts cooperated by LOWERING THE BAR OF ESTIMATES and now he can OVER DELIVER! You Short Term OPTIONS LOTTO PLAYERS HAVE 7-10 DAYS TO COVER I'D ESTIMATE??? Good Luck....YOUR GOING TO NEED IT!
3 FED chairman caught with their hands in the cookie jar and one has the audacity to try to manipulate the citizens of the United States of America now knowing that the circle corruption is all doing the same thing. trading on Vital Information only privy to themselves and those in the room. not too hard to make the jump to the ones that are in the room either
"got a feeling we aren't going to hold green today. Gold lost all of yesterdays gains, 10 year yields going up and option sentiment is changing."
How about a profit sharing check for your employees. Do you guys do that out on the west coast?
Amzn is the cheapest growth stock out there. Will be 10k in 5 years. So undervalued
"AMZN is off to races. We will see $3500 --> $3700 --> split --> $4100 (pre split value) --> $4500 (pre split adjusted). That is $1300 /share from here in less than 6 months. Sit tight everyone.They cannot break up AMZN. Based on what? That they run multiple businesses? Then they will have to break up Google (YouTube, Phone business, Autonomous vehicle, Cloud, Ads, internet search, etc, etc); AAPL (phone, computing, cloud, Apple TV, iTunes, etc etc), FB (social, Instagram, Video streaming, ads, cloud, etc etc), MSFT (cloud, computing and operating system, software, etc etc) among others. Nonsensical."
LATE DAY SURGE!! 4000 ON HORIZON CAP'N KIRK!
"YTD return only 0.76% & consolidating since July 2020. Per Seeking Alpha 10/3/21 - "". . . the last time AMZN built a L-T base it resolved it by jumping 50%"".Are there any potential catalysts? Yes. FOMO with RSI teetering on oversold at 36.24, Branded TV later this mo, Logistics could be huge taking business from FDX, UPS and USPS, $1.34B investment in Rivian could be worth $5.47B depending on IPO valuation, Digital Ad revenue growth, E-commerce potential Intl and AWS' margins and growth. As they say, ""the longer the base, the higher in space!"""
"split will come when there is solid upward movement on stock price. If the trend continues and AMZN expects good earnings report and good guidance, anticipating share prices moving higher, then they will announce stock split in the earnings call."
Looks like breakout coming… the only stock that deserves to gain 7%. Google MSFT had their strong days of gains. Time fir Amazon to take off! Too long to get stuck at 3250. Check my comments couple of days ago!
"Amazon invested in $NAUT a insanely undervalued company + insiders loaded up past 2 weeks and institutions. Check Fintel, it’s next to run IMO. $OCGN $DATS"
praise be - out performing the market? How can these be?
"I think people are obsessing too much on supply chains & .1 point moves in interest rates where it comes to AMZN! Fact is the potential for shortages will actually play into AMZN'S hands! Shoppers with limited time, attempting to limit time in HIGH TRAFFIC AREAS will NOT want to travel to multiple locations ONLY To Find Out that store does not have the item their looking for.....Why not stay home and SHOP ON LINE!"
Where did all the shorts go?
In reading thru last 10Q I noticed that the fulfillment division recorded $908M USD in stock compensation in Q1 & Q2. Seems the media never picks up on this nice bonus for employees. That’s a 30% increase yoy. Some people love to beat on AMZN but principle holds true - work hard and rewards follow.
Depending on what this Amazon deal turns out to be....it can potentially double $RDW share price within a day or two and more.....and you know that if $AMZN gets involved it won't be for a short term one time deal. This will be a long term project! We will soon find out. $RKLB you with us?
"where are the federal prosecutors looking into homelessness on the street during the moratorium, as well as all of the criminal activity while outrageous amounts of taxpayer money was given out? treasury secretary wants to check out $600 transactions but no one wants to set up a task force for finding out where 30 trillion dollars went to. and the whole time your president as well as others professional career politicians have been in office to reap the rewards. when is somebody going to HELP We the People?"
We have a strong battle ahead but I’m certain we will overcome the past week price actions soon enough. Long and strong
Hope everyone bought that dip yesterday. Bears in some serious trouble here. Onward toward earnings.
"Short covering will push this past $3500 next week, easily. By earnings call at $3600. Post earnings to $3800-$4000. Split must be announced at $3500. If they announce split, $4500 or $450/share post 10:1 split."
"Good morning long, let’s stay strong and ong for the battle ahead!"
SPLIT is the solution for AMZN's problem. Jassy is just too blind.
Did I read that correctly ? 10 minute total space flight
"Warren Granger, calling for 4400.00 by Christmas!"
Cpt Kirk lead us to the moon! All jokes aside GL to all longs
"Yes keep bashing amazon, more it drops more money we make. Come on article writers more bad articles. Add a couple more 0s to my balance. We shorting this to the moon paying off handsomely :)."
"It's monday so let's look at AMZN options this week. Lines are at 3250, $3300 and $3350. One could expect a close on friday around $3300 but put buyers at $3250 are quite active today trying to push down the line.As I keep saying, as long as Amazon doesn't split 10/1, Options will rule this stock every single week outside ER. That's what is keeping tis stock in range and going nowhere."
Added a lot of shares in the 3100's during these sell-offs for the long term making this my 2nd biggest holding behind AVGO. This will be a $5000 stock in short fashion. This company has really expanded in theirretail division. Cloud is still booming. This could prove to be the best 'tech' stock in which to be involved.So much potential. After $5000 who knows where it could go. Needs to be a CORE position in anyone's portfolio.
Best case scenario: $AMZN of Biotechs. Worst case scenario: $NVDA of Biotechs. It’s a win/win. Ark aggressive buying is just the icing on the cake.
Stock will go to 4200 after stock split
"intentional supply chain confusion set up by the corrupt political Circle in order to raise prices astronomically to this they the corrupt government and the Circle of corrupt businesses own the media and the lobbyist who owned the politicians who owned the bed and the Supreme Court, make ungodly profits by stapling the supply chain and then raise wages by pennies to keep the people quiet oh, the whole time using technology to swallow up the jobs they're paying pennies for now knowing you'll be paying nothing later. technology you got to love it except if you see its future, our future"
"This is a very good lineup, if it can be maintained $AMZN $VENA"
It's pretty funny how Yahoo filters comments they like. I commented earlier about the lack of diversity in the Blue Origin flight and how they were all white yuppies. They didnt let it post. I wonder why?
Split is confirmed.
"The US Government continues to PUMP NASDAQ Composite (^IXIC) Tulip Mania Relentlessly and Artificially, DESPITE Skyrocketing HYPERINFLATION, Tanking Corporate Revenues, ABSURD Valuations, Collapsing Economy, Insanely Astronomically High Debt Levels and Record High Bankruptcies!$AMZN $TWTR $FB"
"Sepetember Retail sales number this morning was almost entirely driven by online sales. Online sales rose 0.6% for the month,"
"Bought my 1st share of Amazon. My brokerage does not offer fractional, so bought 1 full share. I don't like fractional shares, anyway."
Low volume day. The 10-year bod yield will dictate what happens tomorrow
Oops! Retail sales number is up. AMZN to $4000.
"I will diversify , I am adding Amazon tomorrow. I see double bottom (W-shap) big breakout at 3540 and it will come quick due to HOLLOWEEN sales online , I hear 4800 at earnings"
Best stock in the planet
"To all financial backers searching for a real procedure to contribute and make genuine benefit. Mr Spencer Hudson signs, systems and capacities with regards to supporting my crypto portfolio increment through exchanging outline,from 2BTC to 20BTC and now tradingfor extra. contact spencer signals Telegm: @spencerhudtrading"
"Amazon should split 10:1, this way a lot of retail investors would buy shares at an accessible price"
Shareholder and soon to be employee
AWS and Ads are the diamond in the rough in AMZN. Those two divisions trade at a discount because of the Retail part of AMZN.
2.5 million shares traded. Whoop de do. In 2018-2019 we were averaging 5 million plus per day.
I’m amazed at the negative sentiment on what has a high probability to be the very first 5t mkt cap company ever. Easy buy and forget deal here
"Inflation is not going to be the worry some people think. So, companies have overordered to ensure they get at least some of their items they need. Yes, some companies have leased ships. They will need to sell all the excess inventory they will be receiving as the Port of Long Beach operates 24/7.... Costs have risen, but will fall with excessive inventory which companies don't want to store. Don't have the employees to handle the large amount of warehousing and delivery by last mile/trucks without enough drivers."
"Guess which FAANG is underperforming again. Here’s a hint, it’s not FB, AAPL, NFLX or GOOGL."
A lot of positive news coming before and after earnings.Buy AMZN before it hits $4k by November 2021!
Split news on october28th!!
"Nothing the Morgan Stanley analyst provided in his report was not already known by the market. One must chuckle when he states the stock is ""rangebound""... I get the sense they are attacking tech stocks in an attempt to fuel a sell off as they position themselves for the end of year. And Amazon is a prime target because it is held by so many large hedge funds. As usual the market yawns."
"I agree Amazon new Black Friday October will boost Q3 earning breaking consolidation to a different level. I see AMZN above 4300 above by earnings, in few weeks. OCTOBER is the new NOVEMBER"
COME ON 3500 3600 3700 3800 3900 4000 WE DESERVE IT ALREADY !!!
"When NASDAQ drops by 0.1%, AMZN drops by 1.46%, while GME gains 5%; you know something is screwed up with the system and manipulation of stocks. Have you ever wondered why analysts always have a different opinion than the estimates that the companies themselves give to the street? As if the analysts know more than the people who run the company! The system is rigged; no doubt about it."
"Options ruling again today... That will be the case every Friday until they split and make it easier for people to buy the stock and not options.AMAZN hasn't gone anywhere for awhile now. All other techs appreciated, especially Microsoft and Google or Neflix. Only difference is stock price being too high to buy so people jus trade options..."
Stock is pretty oversold but not getting any help from the 10 year treasury which notched above 1.6 percent today. There's rally potential out there but I'm keeping my powder dry.
"Cloud, retail and soon food distribution. They'll own most of it. The stock should have went to $4,000 after the last earnings announcement. Now if they'd make the shares more affordable."
Did I hear Josh Brown the other day say that Amazon to 5k by end of this year ? Or did he say end of 2022?
Oct 28 earnings call. Should have our traditional run up week before and our traditional fall off after a record breaking quarter lol. Sigh.
everything is speculative many strong fundamental stock seating below correct price
"more pain for whoever shorting AMZN now. If it wasn't for Warren's comments, this would have been up $100/share. Politicians come and go, businesses survive."
still nothing from your president on what has happened and what the government has done to our people and the younger generation. with no jobs nothing to do terrified of a virus that the media and the government is promoting fear with a generation of people that have no coping skills no real education due to No Child Left Behind and a host of other lingering problems with our education and those who teach it and how they wield their power. a plan of replacing this generation with technology in order to continue the technological Revolution that is destroying the country
$ALFI and $GRVI in partnership with $AMZN
Amazon will split but it will split into two separate companies: Amazon and AWS (my opinion).
Time for ALFI to run hard today!!! $ALF and $GRVI are already partners and now with $AMZN !!
Will buy back lower ...3356
"Im waiting for a slight pull back to $3,250 Then buying big. . Should see $4,000 in a year or sooner"
"Amazon is gonna have a strong holiday season, and probably make up for it’s neutral movement in 2022"
AMZN demonstrates its lack of resilience again today as it sinks almost 40 points.
Unbelievable this thing hasn't moved in a year. Makes no sense.
I KNEW IT WOULD EVENTUALLY HAPPEN!!!! AMAZON IS ROCKETING HIGHER TODAY!!!!
"Since Tu, it is up $150/share. Wow!"
September retail sales higher than expected. Christmas sales starting early. AMZN the worlds largest retailer should get a nice chunk of that.
"One of the largest commercial real estatedevelopers on the East Coast, purchasedupside call options at a strike price of $3800.00with a Jan 21, 2022 expiration date."
Added here. Amazon green on a down day
"AMZN market cap 1.6 Trillion, shares outstanding 505 million, employees 1335000, share price 3247,33$"
can take off any minute for +$60 now
"Amazon is a ""services"" sector company and will be pounded by continued inflation."
volume 4 mill today
"most of all a task force for cryptocurrency, its creator and it's dismantlement to produce confidence and transparency back to the financial markets. come up with a plan to swallow up all the debt and reset the country and globally"
3% would be a nice move today. Have not seen a 3% move in a long time.
"Amazon new Black Friday October 10th will be blast!! for the hungry shoppers due to quarantine and covid. Also Q3 earnings will be blast to breakout consolidation above 4500 due to huge EPS/revenues for Q3. Good strategies,,,,so for Q4 expect another boost above 5000. Also, FB, WDC, INTC also will benefit from Oct Black Friday. FB Ads links to amazon and other stores. Amazon sells WDC and INTC in Black Friday like hot cake. buy after hours.."
The whole stockMarket was down. You guys have no optimism? As close as it is to its 52 week low there is no way it’s going to go down that much further.
Yes keep dropping. Make the rich lose more money. We will keep shorting. Thanks for playing
never giving out the moratorium money and holding it until 2025 basically saying that they're not giving out the moratorium money the emergency money is that the common people need to shore up and feel safe with the purchase of real estate purchases made but because of the increases and the lack of money for the common people and pushing out the emergency money is until 2025 gives all the rich the opportunity to come in and swoop up and steal all the real estate that will ultimately default
$4000 stock in 3 months. Americans sitting on a ton of cash and ready to spend. Congress soon to pass both bills
"We’ll see a good day tomorrow this is the second day it underperformed and Trading volume (2.0 M) remained 858,456 below its 50-day average volume of 2.9 M. We’ll see upward movement tomorrow at some portion of the day"
"Andy set up this quarter earnings report to be a success. He lowered the expectations in order to overdeliver. That combined with an upbeat holiday season fourth quarter guidance will push the share prices to over $4000. The big boys are manipulating the price to just accumulate shares. There is fixed supply of number of shares, so if everyone knew about this strategy and not selling at low prices, they have to buy at high to accumulate. Thus, this manipulation to get your shares. Hold on tight to whatever you got!"
"AMZN building brick and mortar retail stores...BEZO's says, If we build it...they will LOOT it ! good thinking BEZOS !"
AMZN investors: deal with reality. How long will it take to regain highs? Time to switch into profitable companies like MSFT and GOOG for example.
BIG EARNINGS?
Amazon new world video game is awesome cool new electronic gagets for the hoildays.tommarow Amazon will cure cancer the headlines amazo n cures cancer wall street investors not impressed stock dives 2% never seen such a always innovating evolving state of the art co.pany gets no love
AMZN to 4000 by year end!
"Smells like a breakout, we’ve been due for over a year. I think Jaffey will have a track record like Satya when he took over at Microsoft. Patience is a virtue"
"Anyone come across this potential value play, Advanced Emissions (ADES). Company has a ""for sale sign"" on the window (see press release on strat review). Not a well know stock but a good play on climate change. There are a few good articles in Seeking Alpha on this company. Company expects to have $80M cash at EOY. SA makes a real good case for ADES. Less than 19M shares out.The SA article speculates a deal should be announced shortly but can't close until next quarter (Q1)."
Wow Option are actually moving this up today with a vengeance! Unexpected but great for bulls. $3300 to $3400 in a hurry.
Same P/E as 2009. You can't tell me they aren't Making Money in Retail & Cloud. Would almost be impossible not to be???
Where else can you make 0.03% on your money in 7.5 hrs?? LOL!
"The longer the base, the higher in space!! Consolidating since July 2020 and YTD return, thru 10/7, only 1.40%. ""Avg"" PT $4,190 & Bull PT $5,000."
Bears come out and eat and then go to hibernate. Bulls run and graze for long periods of time. Down markets are usually short.
"New investors who are struggling need to understand one thing: Logic has nothing to do with price movement. ""OMG, Amazon stayed red today while the rest of Faang went green"". Seriously, do you think this has NEVER happened before? Do you think every other stock has never experienced the same thing? (Just as there will be days a stock takes a MASSIVE spike for NO reason, you just roll with it.)"
About 2.75x normal 10 day volume on explosive upside of 3.31%. Sweet day for Ammie!
With aws and ai technology starting AMZN knowsholiday shopping is in full swing already with sales and prime day and and items in stock and shipping times firing on all cylinders this 4th qrt is going to be huge
Guys and ladies look past the five min or hourly charts this is at a key level look at 1yr charts and ytd ones clear bearish signals on the charts short some call spreads but don’t go long this one all jokes aside clear head shoulder made over time hate to see anyone loose money but don’t get fooled because one good day amzn is barely up for the year
WOW in such a short period of time Jassy has done for Amazon shareholders what Kenneth Lay did for Enron shareholders!!!! Thank You VERY LITTLE!!
"I just jumped into Amazon using options. At a 21% 9-day RSI, I think this stock is close to a bottom. Hard to see Amazon going below 3050 in the near term. Opinions?"
Time to jump ship? AMZN's best days are likely behind it. Open your eyes to the reality of its trading pattern the last few months.
$VENA $AMZN $FB Trust your vision
Poor performance today compared to GOOG.
Earnings report incoming
dont miss your chance to buy before earnings this usually runs up fast
"I'm questoning myself - how many investors here understand that 50 percent of profit in last quarter was from AWS. World leading cloud solution - being leader in industry which just can't be stopped.Im working as cloud expert and trust me - AWS will be 75 percent of profit of Amazon in 3 years. Check for yourselves what is average PE of any leading Cloud/SaaS company - Salesforce, Snowflake etc. You cant find any under 100 PE. Amazon has forward PE under 50 - lowest in decades. This stock did not move for 18 months. Prepare for huge growth.Forget to see Amazon as ecommerce. You don't care about prime day or black friday.. What you need to care about news in their storage and computation services, new data centers, cloud solutions for goverments etc. That is what matter for 2026 in Amazon. And as a cloud expert I will tell you ""secret"". Once you migrate/deploy your infra into Cloud (eg AWS) you are doing that for years. Because migration into another cloud cost you huge pile of money. That is reason AWS just cant stop to grow. It's rise 25-20 percent lee year at least next 8-10 years."
No company on earth has a better supply chain than AMZN. It is affecting every company but Amazon should show us how it is done this year. They spent over $60B on infrastructure this year alone. Jassy said they basically doubled their fulfillment operations in the last 18 months. AWS will be the shiny star of the 3rd and 4th quarter.
We should all go short till they decide to wake up and do a stock split
late day buying will push this past 3.30%
"i feel the secret behind bitcoin is buying at a lower price and selling higher,i really need to invest in bitcoin before it goes more higher than this . Moreover i need another source of income"
"Shorts running out of time. Heavy squeeze coming. Once it starts, it goes +$60 to +$100 a day. Will go to $4000 in no time."
"The market is crazy. Never know when a stock will make a positive move. So, you just have to be in multiple stocks and 'hope' you make the right choices. Selling a great stock and then it makes huge move can be very demoralizing. AMZN is a core holding and all I do is add shares when possible."
What just happened hahahahaha
Split or no split? I know they don’t add value but they do peak interest.
