Fantastic resilience on a brutal day for Nasdaq. Looks like the beginnings of a rotation back into Amazon. ‘Bout Time! 
"What do you think about when you think of Amazon? I tend to think about their trucks and how I get packages almost every day. AMZN e-commerce segment op income averaged 2.2% over the last 10 years. Real growth, and margins, are in Digital Advertising, AWS, healthcare and logistics. AWS could hit $100b by 2023. AMZN spends billions each year on fulfillment. A AMZN dept store chain would reduce costs, ie, custs could pu there products there, AMZN could move warehouses full of slow, discontinued and open boxed product, etc. AMC could make sense, and AMZN would give away tickets . . . to Prime Members, and they would air some of their movies, and drastically cut prices . . . all for about the amount of $ they paid for MGM.AMZN is on sale now: ""AVG"" PT is 28% after 1.29% today and 8/20 analyst said if you based val on Discounted Future Cash Flow 12 mo PT would be $4,735."
Wal Mart has the shop lifting and AMZN has the service so I think we know who wins in the long run
It’s Key Lime Pie Time here in the FLA! The Key Conchs are celebrating. Vamos Amazon! 
I've been able to build a huge income stream by investing in bitcoin with the help of Mrs Evelyn T hills trading skills & accurate analysis.
"L1 Capital Q2 Investor letter: ""Amazon flipped from being the largest detractor from portfolio performance in the March 2021 quarter, to one of the leading contributors in the June 2021 quarter. We took advantage of negative near-term sentiment in the March 2021 quarter to add to our Amazon investment. We continue to view Amazon as one of the best positioned businesses globally, with its share price still not reflecting fair value."""
"Amazon should advertise more for Wholefoods. There's a space in Wholefoods that is great for coffee, breakfast, lunch or even dinner - a great place for meeting and get together - better than Starbucks, Panera or McDonalds.The grocery prices are comparable with Walmart, Kroger, HEB and other stores. And the stores are neat, clean and well organized. There is a wrong preconception that prices are high at Wholefoods because they sell Organic food but again, prices are comparable - some wines are even cheaper than those at Aldi."
"New PT. Some analysts are very sharp and some are not. It’s the investor’s job to distinguish between the two. 8/20/21 Seeking Alpha - Ben Howard – Now May be the Time to Add Amzn – is a well-researched and well-presented valuation and DFC PT. He states you can’t compare AMZN to just one competitor to determine the right P/E and EV/S (Enterprise Value to Sales): AMZN is too diversified. So he compares it to 4 competitors: GOOG (cloud & advertising), WMT (retail/wholesale – online & stores), BABA (online retail, coud, subscriber services) and EBAY (3rd party svces).His conclusion is that AMZN could hit $4,377 next year, a 37% upside. When he looks at their valuation based on discounted Future cash flows, then it’s almost 48% (almost $4,735).RSI 28.79 . . . technically oversold."
"Saw this posted on SeekingAlpha by user Doug- . What do you think of his analysis? Since I am long on AMZN, naturally I liked the way he has done the math, but am interested in other perspectives. "".... Sales projections are reliable and since the projected rate per year compounded is 25% then in 5 years Amazon will be trading at $9,773 a share. Using Cash Flow which is also predictive at 31% annual compounded projected return and projecting that 5 years ahead you get $12,354 a share. Take the average of the 2 and you get a price of $11,063 a share. That should be the median price in 5 years time, which is a compounded forwarding return of 28.14% per annum."""
"Buying amazon now is probably the easiest money to make in he stock market, if you think anyone would sell this with Xmas shopping starting, then you shouldn’t be investing. People are going to be very cautious with flu season coming up combined with the other virus. Quarter 3 will be record breaking"
"Based on 30 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for Amazon in the last 3 months. The average price target is $4,214.13 with a high forecast of $5,000.00 and a low forecast of $3,775.00. The average price target represents a 25.81% change from the last price of $3,349.63."
"I've been very bullish on $AFRM and $SOFI for a few months as they both have been gaining market share at various websites I'd visit. So the $AMZN partnership announcement on Friday was no surprise. I sold my $AFRM over $100 this morning for over 45% gain and moving it to $SOFI and adding even more shares of $JWN under 29....Nordstrom will be back above 38 in the short term in no time. I have also added more shares to $ADSK, which I expect to be back above 340 also in the short term.Keep buying $JWN, $ADSK, $SOFI. Keep holding."
"Those who stayed strong during the down phase, congratulations. Do remember to book profit from time to time though."
"Seeking Alpha has an article out saying Amazon stock could quadruple in 5 years to $12,800 a share"
"I shorted Amzn, Googl, and Aapl. Very bad decision down big today."
is this goin to split any time soon? Want to buy in but cant buy fractional shares
"Michael is obviously the best I invested $3k and he made me profit of over 21,000 US dollars for me in just 14days. I was so amazed with his brilliant and unique strategies in earning"
"Affirm stock $AFRM climbed 40% in Monday’s premarket trading following the company’s tie-up with Amazon $AMZN which will allow it to offer its ‘buy now, pay later’ option to the online retailer’s customers. I love this platform https://stockhaul.today/vsvx4y ! I signed up three years ago and so glad I did with all of the innovations they are coming out with. It is really an important tool to use everyday for traders. I have found no better tool on the market and i have used a lot of them."
I just bought more stuff for the family on AMZN. Share price will rise accordingly.
"Great article in Seeking Alpha today - 6 Reasons Amazon Is Set To Soar And Too Cheap To Ignore - ""Amazon's hyper-growth is expected to continue thanks to the fact that its two fastest-growing businesses are AWS and advertising with operating margins of 30% and 75%, respectively, according to Piper Jaffrey. In the next 5 years, analysts think Amazon could potentially quadruple to $12,800 per share. . . "" ""For 20 years, investors consistently paid 24-26x operating cash flow. That means 25x cash flow is a conservative intrinsic value estimate for Amazon. It’s currently trading at 20.5x forward cash flow—at a wonderful price given its quality and growth potential."""
