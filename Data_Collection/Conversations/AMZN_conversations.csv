"Stayed with amzn because the pe was decreasing, the market expects the pe to come down.This miss caused the ttm pe to shoot back up from 59 to 64. Hard decision to sell because amzn has been a long term core holding. Great company but the stock is 200 to 400 dollars over priced. Also the top 200 companies are being targeted by a 15% tax and that can't be shareholder friendly."
"AWS Operating Income 4 Billion Advertising Revenue 8 Billion Total Op Profit 4 BillionSo retail LOSES 8 Billion Per Quarter? Yeah, I know, there is video cost in there but.AWS is a relatively low margin business, which will become lower margin in the future.After tax profit using the latest quarter is roughly 3 billion x 4 =12 Billion annual.12 Billion doesn't remotely get you to 1.7 trillion of market cap.Bad news is advertising was roughly flat quarter over quarter as was Prime revenue. Iftheir items sold number doesn't pick up advertising will likely stay flat or go down. Primelooks like it's pretty much done and they won't be able to raise prices for it in this environment.As far as infrastructure, Walmart, Target, Best Buy all have stores everywhere so what infrastructureadvantage does Amazon have? Like the others, they lease buildings, so all Amazon's capital expenditures are going into buildings they don't own."
Maybe they can change their name
Shorts when AMZN beats earnings.
That was not too bad for a miss. I think Wallstreet sees this for what it is. Temporary setback. Amazon has forgone short term profits for long term growth forever. 2022 should be a good year.
Wasn’t it last week that the retail numbers were so good and Amazon went up over $100? How is it possible that stock drops today?
I must have missed the 10;1 split announcement that was predicted by so many on this site. Maybe next quarter.
Only way this will breakout to upside is if split announced. Why else buy a company whose stock price has gone nowhere recently and pays no dividend.
In about a year:Tesla: $300 to $1000Amazon: $3300 to $3300I shoulda' bought Tesla.

"As customers returned to physical stores and supply chain challenges increased, the mega-cap company reported its first earnings miss in six quarters. Amazon shares were down nearly 5% in premarket trading Friday morning. Goldman and Morgan Stanley admitted that at the moment Amazon is among the best stocks to buy now.“Its broad third-quarter performance and fourth-quarter commentary on operating profit will no doubt disappoint, but we see Amazon positioned… to absorb a host of labor, wage, logistics, and COVID costs,” Goldman Sachs’ Eric Sheridan wrote in a note.https://beststocks.com/best-stocks-to-buy-now-analysts-love-amazon/"
"Definitely a Buy before earnings. AWS, Cloud services and Online shopping with beat the earnings estimate."
"Haha, moving to green in AH."
"Amazon is the epitome of diversification. When one area is down another is up. AWS is very profitable and growing. Retail suffers but the holiday season is among us. Doing 100+ billion in a quarter. That’s just wow. AMZN is the perfect stock. One day you will wake up and boom, up 200. I think I will hold"
"This was as high as 3700. based on UPS blowout quarter yesterday I predict at least 3500 for Amazon Thursday ah.. United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS)NYSE - NYSE Delayed Price. Currency in US218.07+14.17 (+6.95%)<--- YOWSA"
"Love this stock and been a holder for over a decade, but this has been one dissapointing year."

A better option now is Mercadolibre (MELI) the Amazon of Latin America.
"Entering extremely Undervalued territory with AWS Super charging Amazon future growth. Load up and AMZN will be $4,000+ by 2022."
"AMZN is more than a friggn online storeits Aws, Augmented Reality-basedand other technology is at work here Stop with shopping storePS, I buy everything from AMZN"
"well who scooped up shares on sale AH at $3,253? hehehe"
"Investor psychology can be both fascinating and deranged at times! This is probably the one of the top 5 companies EVER CREATED, it's basically FLAT on the year and was at least initially Paned for investing in the companies expansion! The very same investors would gladly buy stock in a SPAC Charging Station Lottery Ticket Trading at 800 times 2035 SALES??? For DOING THE SAME THING??? Food for THOUGHT!!!"
"To all my bear friends, WS is playing you to steal your money. Amazon will do 140 billion in sales next quarter. Yet they have you believe it’s a slow down, lol. Keep being bearish."
TURDMeisters....After the open AMZN has GAINED 80+ Points on Above Average Volume! Thats Conviction!!
i fully expect price to drop below 3300 on Monday. (long and strong)
"$AMZN misses diminished expectations Big time, but $BABA nosedives and AMZN stock gets Pumped all day long. Why? Because BABA is a Chinese company and AMZN is an American Scam?"
nobody reads the tea leaves anymore.... you think amazon misses like this organically? the big boys never miss wildly...expectations are always revised lower for a modest beat or loss.... this is inflation taming and gearing up for the no taper cover.....
"Only down 3.5% as of 10:19 am, not much. In fact, it is down the same percentage as Apple. It is not a big deal."
Don’t forget Black Friday and Christmas are just around the corner.
"Can’t believe all the whining in here this morning. New investors think stocks only ever go up, well they don’t. Make your investments, after you did your research, then buy and hold. Too many people thinking they’re genius traders nowadays."
If your selling this morning you are a day late. Might as well ride it out. Any problems Amazon is having is temporary and if they are having problems everyone else is having problems in the retail business. AWS is the future of Amazon and they are hitting on all cylinders.

"Buy the dip. This ER is positioned to be a blowout. AMZN's expected EPS is $8.93 for this Thursday's ER, but their last qtr's actual EPS was over $15! Should be a very easy beat."
"Amazon will spend billions of dollars to try and manage labour shortages and supply chain issues in the run up to Christmas, it has been reported.The company’s chief executive, Andy Jassy said that the retail giant expected to “incur several billion dollars of additional costs” due to “labour supply shortages, increased wage costs, global supply chain issues, and increased freight and shipping costs.” If you want investment ideas from real knowledgeable traders, check them out at the https://dailytrading.tools/BTFDeBook platform"
AMZN will have blow-out earnings tomorrow and have a similar reaction as MSFT and GOOGL today to new ATHs!!!Friday AMZN will close ABOVE 3731 AND NASDAQ will also close at a new ATH.
Never ever Amazon options. No puts or calls. stocks for long term on dips.. THATS IT
Looks like amazon needs to start paying a dividend. This isn’t a growth stock anymore
"We will know at the end of the day. Jassy pulled a RopeDope last quarter downplaying 3rd quarter. Lets see if he was setting up for a big beat by lowering expectations. Amazon has doubled it's fulfillment network over the last 18 months. AWS is king of the cloud, Amazon music has quietly become of of the largest streaming music services, Ads are going up. etc etc etc."
"Amazon always thinking like a startup.........20% ownership in EV, Rivian......"
"“We’ve always said that when confronted with the choice between optimizing for short-term profits versus what’s best for customers over the long term, we will choose the latter—and you can see that during every phase of this pandemic,” said Jassy.Better times are on the horizon."
Only down 2% after a bad miss?Warren Buffet didn’t sell…on to $4000 within 6 months.Stay long my friends!
This forum will become hilarious when we get 2% interest rate to fight inflation lol
Today wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Guess I'll hold
"Credit Suisse cut it's target price to $900 above today's price, so people sell. LOL. They are adding 150,000 people, because their sales are BOOMING, and they will just pass on those distribution costs and higher wages to the consumer, because they have zip for competition. He clearly has no idea about their launch into food distribution next year. Back to school buddy.....back to school."
"I'm buying the ER drop. 3340 filled, 3290 filled, 3260 waiting. 3 shares per buy only. AMZN drops are never permanent."
"eh obviously nobody going to liquidate a position in one of the top 5 stocks in the world over a bad earnings report and guidance, but there will be some dumping due to the opportunity cost calculus, and with no foreseeable upward catalysts in the short term, fairly safe bet that today's negligible movement is a shoring up of the exits, and the filing out begins in earnest next week."
Up 20 points in the last half hour. Up another 100 points on Monday after smart investors pile in
"Still an expensive stock, market still near all time high, around 2600 is a good entry price."
"with an army of people hired for this holiday season, they will guide high for Q4. Earnings call with be a $200 boost to the share price, then news of a huge Black Friday will be another $200. If they announce a stock split, we will be at $4300 by Jan."
"Someone posted the other day that the stock is simply out of favor. I believe that. I sold 2/3rds of my shares at $3,700 a long time ago (dumb luck and not wanting to be greedy - and making $1,000 a share profit), and I sold my last 1/3rd at 3 pm today. Even if the company had made estimates, the stock just has a bad track record of going down on good news. I still feel it is one of the best companies on the planet, but if the S&P 500 can beat it by 35% (?) in the last 12 months, why have that kind of risk on a single stock when you can buy the S&P 500 index — and not worry about what Amazon is going to do after the bell? I realize that’s just too conservative investing for many people. I own lots of individual stocks, but I still benchmark them in their industry and against the Dow and S&P. If they trail for too long, I make a change — but everyone has different financial situations, goals, and time horizons. I really appreciate reading everyone’s comment on Amazon. My wife and I buy a ton of stuff from the company. Think how much time, gas, and mileage we have saved on our cars, in the past four years by not going out to stores as often."
"10 Signs of an impending buyout!1. Dead silence from management and IR on all fronts for months.2. Multiple amazing trial data releases in June of 2021.3.

the real reason why this is tanking today is because i bought it yesterday
$AMZN any solid sources on stock split rumors or just people having wishful thinking?
"Lost a couple days worth of profits. No big deal, will get money back in the next week or two."

"WS has all the bears focus on the 1 billion in sales they didn’t make instead of the 110 billion in sales they made, lol. I buy every Friday. Thanks for the cheap shares."
"That's the scary thing about amazon, especially since they said they wont split--the only way for the SP to go up is the company has to grow more. How could Amazon possibly grow more after the pandemic when they were the only place to shop. Short of taking over the world this company can't get much bigger, it's already a disaster logistically, borderline slave labor. They need to split and pay a dividend...."
The wisest thing that should be on everyones mind currently should be to invest in different stream of income.
its all over for Amazon! Sell all your shares today!(we want to buy this dip so pleeeeze sell now!)
"AWS is the real reason AMZN will blow up in the future. 16.11B a Q, growing at a 30-40% CAGR is insane. My predictions are below.We all know the stock needs a split, but instead I believe they will do a spin off instead. AMZN is using AWS right now to build its infrastructure for retail services and once that becomes stable enough they will spin off AWS.With all the Retail services AMZN plays in + Digital adversing (growing at really fast pace) that alone is still a trillion dollar company (still $AZMN). Here comes the spin off ($AWS): AWS is producing 16.11B a Q, If AMZN can get that up to 25B a Q that is another trillion dollar company by its-self. I get that valuation by looking at other tech companies. 25B a Q is 100B a year and with margins of 30-40% they can easily trade 10X sales. (100B X 10 = 1T company spin off).To compare that: AMD is around $4-5B a Q ($14B a year), growing at the same pace as AWS (just my opinion) also trading at 10X sales. So AWS is a huge growth stock within a lower margin retail stock.Current share holders of AMZN when they announce a spin off will either get shares of AWS in a dividend, or be able to buy/trade AMZN shares for AWS shares (At a discount).If you ask me, I'm in this for a long run. Let me know if you guys agree"
"Beat earnings today and split stock, price will reach 3700!"
overpriced tech stocks that don't fall when they miss earnings haha welcome to the casino!
Ouch glad I sold amzn amd went to goog months ago. Timber!
Will this stock ever hit $4K??? We've been promised this for years now.
"The analysts already had a lot this supply chain/labor costs built in with most revising targets earlier in October. The one year target still averages $4,180, low target $3,775 and a high of $5,000. While most any business that focuses on the sales of goods are struggling through this reopening of the economy here's the great news for AMZN: Sales for the cloud unit continued to climb sharply, totaling $16.1 billion in the third quarter, up about 39% from a year earlier. Amazon's unit that primarily includes ad sales grew by 50%.Expect cloud and ads to be an ever increasing portion of revenue and profit!"
"This is what it means to go long. I bought in at 3,200. I for the first time decided to go long . I will not touch this for the next 10 years. I have 5 shares."
happened the exact same thing 2-3 years back.. for the same quarter if I remember correctly. Went up about a $100 during the trading session and fell 200$ after hours ... I see the same trend this time too.... hope I am wrong. I just have 2 shares :)
Black Friday Sale on AMZN Stock!!! While other companies are pumping their numbers for end of Quarter AMZN is spending on the future. As Jassy said they could focus on short term gains or focus on long term growth. 2022 should start seeing AMZN harvesting some of these investments in infrastructure.
Over an hour after reporting and barely even down now. Could this actually not be negative tomorrow or even go green
"UPS’s earnings heavily relied on Amazon’s uptick in demand for online shopping. Not only did they manage to beat earnings and revenue on all top line forecasts, but they did so while battling rising costs, inflation, and a shortage of workers. With Amazon announcing they now deliver more packages than FedEx, it’s quite near impossible that we see Amazon miss this quarter. Not only do I expect a beat when Wall Street expects a drop in earnings, I expect the Supply Chain Crisis to have caused a huge uptick in demand for Amazon products and services. Amazon’s stock has been flat all year, not posting significant gains, this could be the quarter that solidifies Amazon’s return to shareholders this year. Can’t wait for the 29th!!!"
"I am buying AMZN at the open. AMZN p/E still cheap since 12 months, despite solid Q2, Q1,Q4 ..still under this price? Cmon give me a break. AMZN will correct above 4000 in Nov. The best bullish month for tech"
Stock was up for the week!
amazon should be at 4000. . been holding my 1 share since 2019
"Sell AMZN, buy MSFT TSLA GOOG"
"$140B in top line for the next quarter and people are disappointed; that’s a joke. Costs will come under control soon, then profits will soar. AMZN may not make it to $4000 now but will go up to $3700-$3800 level by year end."
"Buy AMZN when it slides down to the $2,600 to $2,800 range."
We have been here before and have always come back strong. Nothing has changed and we will re group and move on.
"Very disappointing... Jeff Bezos is a smart guy that left in time to focus on the future with Blue Origin. Amazon is done growing with the competition catching up big time.SHOP is taking the ecommerce business, Microsoft, Ebay and others gaining on the Cloud business, Netflix killing them on the streaming etc...We should have known there were leak with the performance yesterday and today closing. Two misses in a row and this time, it's worse because all the competitions did much better.Amazon will keep being the worse big tech company so short at will and pill on puts."
The most important number. AWS has seen growth accelerate meaningfully. AWS +39% to 16.11B above the 15.52B consensus.

AMZN should have blow out earnings especially the cloud I hope they get the recognition they deserve and finally push over the 4000 mark and stay there they are worth a whole lot more then that
stock has doubled since pandemic .. now pandemic is over and buyers are back to stores and looking for bargain and buy only what they needs instead of hoarding stuff
"How Amazon stock price has remained over valued for 25 years in a complete shock to me.This is an old company trading at 75 x earnings and these are the good times. For most of its life Amazon never made any money at all and actually lost Billions...But somehow after 25 years of trying people still are holding out hope it will actually make ""normal"" income. Here is a secret----Amazon's model is actually broken."
"No position in AMZN. Don't care if it goes up/down. But as a key gauge for the broad economy, clearly things are heading south. Many stocks have not tested their 200EMA in over a year. Long overdue for a correction beyond a 1 day dip."
if you guys look at the charts -- this 1 year area of consolidation (stock moving sideways) is historically normal for this stock -- with a little bit of technical analysis (fortune teller abilities) you can conclude that this stock will explode in the next 3 months -- I have been trading this in and out for the last 3 months but this last time I bought I am going to hold because I feel an explosion coming in the next 3 months that will be a bigger gain than the trades overall (and much less work on my part)
"Online sales are down now, but let’s not forget that the Global Supply Chain Crisis is pushing consumers to shop online again. They can’t find products in store so they turn to the online alternative, aka, Amazon. That, in combination with Amazon optimizing its delivery service fleet and now delivering more packages than FedEx, only means higher margins for the company. This may not be reflected this quarter, but next quarter these two points will be the center of attention. Oh and Holiday Shopping?!?"
it's disappointing to have only 5% return on a year of owing this stock
"Time to send hedgies home. They don't have time left. AMZN above 4000 at earning. AMZN P/E has became cheaper since last 4 Qs. This time big boys will push the breakout 4000. The more we buy accumulate, the more explosive the short squeeze become. Buy in mass. Time punish hedgies for their rotten games. Cuz TRUTH will prevail , EPS is what matters. AMZN has been growing and growing. COrrection will come quick"
The fed will come to the rescue tomorrow. This is why they wont stop their buying. A week of not buying will completely crash the market with some of these stocks. Tesla has gone up 20% in a month. Its unsustainable. The economy is not good right now.
"A year ago well into the height of the pandemic:Revenue: $96 BillionToday, as people go back to physical stores and use Amazon less:Revenue: $111 BillionCurrent $111 Billion vs. $96 Billion during the best of times, and AWS is taking off with $16.11 Billion"
"Lunch hour is going to be interesting. 50/50 chance this either goes past 3350, 50/50 chance is slides down to 3275. Thoughts?"
Been in on AMZN since 290.........I have seen a ton of these down days........I just keep adding on big down days......has worked out for me every single time........AMZN will be 5000 in 2022! Will be adding more soon...
"What you need to realize, a lot of the volume is fractional shares. I buy more every paycheck. 64.1476 shares in 9 years. Stay poor bears."
oh well. amzon gives bakc 2 days of gains . big deal. next 250 will be up . heads you win ..tails you dont lose !
Would not be surprised to see AMZN close in the green tomorrow............the AWS numbers were fantastic ! This is also an investment year........this happens in investment years......large EPS misses
Wow huge miss.... 3200 tomorrow.
Of course Amazon is slowing and its because of inflation and people mostly only buy stuff when they get free money and don't have to work for money.
AWS is a bright spot for AMZN. They are taking market share from everybody else including Microsoft and Google.
Isn’t it funny how the stock plummeted past $100 after hours before the news of earning was disseminated to the masses? Like some people already had the info….
If you look at available information and estimate the '21 earnings then apply the historical multiple you will see the SP of Q1'22. But the multiple can't be rationalized with a degraded future so mark that down from 60 and recalculate. You will see SP at a low of 2400-2800 in early 22. Expect a long term gradual recovery starting in Q2 of 22 as labor and shipping issues resolve yielding a return to earnings growth. Get out now and buy back in 9 months......just an opinion.
My account today My account tomorrow My account over the coming years $AAPL $AMZN
$9.99 delivery fee - Whole Foods.
Supply and demand. If we all bought 1 share of amazon today. That's x amount of shares off the market. If you can afford more go for it now buy and HODL!
"For us Long holders, . It just puts us back 6 months. Not a big deal."
"Who will have the larger day gain today, AAPL or AMZN?"
Google and Microsoft beating earning and Amazon not expected to do so? Retailers are doing great and Microsoft and Google showed the cloud is even better. So it's very likely Amazon will also blow out Earning...So why is the stock wobbling today? Makes no sense at all who would sell or short Amazon today and tomorrow.Just weird game by the mm...
"hours and hours and months and months of negotiating on a package that oh, oh wait a minute was just scratched because 3.5 Trillian was too much swallow oh, no way to pay for it, lying about how it's going to be paid for and what's in it. all of trillions being asked for to spend on infrastructure are not going to help a failing infrastructure oh, but an infrastructure of mishandled misappropriated Monies. do not pass an infrastructure bill this should have already been taken care of with 30 trillion dollars of taxpayers money oh, do not allow the debt ceiling to be lifted instead allow those who spent 30 trillion dollars to come up with the solution without harming the people or the country anymore. Utilizing the great education that has gotten them to the places and positions they now find themselves"
"CNBC headline is so misleading . They mention amazon web services beat Estimates , fail to mention overall numbers and the disappointing they Are in reality . I’m out . AMZN Priced to perfection, no way they can keep pace with Covid era"
You know guy's all I have to do is sell my 45 shares right now like I'm tempted to and you'll all be rich tomorrow.
between the $54 gain before the call yesterday and $70 down today; AMZN lost $20/share. Expect green on Monday. Look at the volume and how much upside buying happened. Clearly undervalued when they expect to sell $140B worth of goods and services in the next quarter. Slight changes will result in at least a few billions in operations cash flow and ending up in very green EPS in Q4. Rivian will turn at least $20B post IPO directly to the balance sheet. Awesome company.
How come it missed. I don't see the amzn orders decreasing around me and my friends ? Is that because of the pandemic ?
Don't worry the fed no longer allows stocks to drop will go green tomorrow amidst upgrades like google and shopify did....
"There is nothing disappointing in this report except higher cost of doing business which is temporary. Otherwise, top line was at the higher end of their guidance and next quarter is the biggest quarter in company’s history for top line revenue. Who can claim over $400b annual top line sales? No one!And AWS showed healthy growth.Stock price movement will surprise everyone."
I learned my lesson many years ago by buying a very expensive stock and ended up losing a lot of money. NEVER again will I buy an expensive stock like AMZN.
"For those fairly new to this, the last 30 hours is the best lesson you will ever have about speculation, and controlling fear and panic. (It's a lesson we all have to learn that only comes from experience. I could write a book on my mistakes when I started out.)"
Price action will surprise everyone.
"Here comes the breaking point to the new highs, earnings report will skyrocket"
Amazon massive miss: -3-4%Intel big eps beat: -12-14% Lol
Most funny thing about today is if earnings would be positive it would drop even more :D
I buy everything from Amazon. I use Prime TV more than Netflix. AWS is by far the best cloud platform. And still...jeez
Got out 5mins before the closing bell. Thank god I did. Learned my lesson from last quarter. Good luck to you all. It should rebound eventually.
Not sure why anyone cares about retail slow downs. We all know whats going on there. Labor shortages are going to hurt all retailers and shippers and its not fully priced in at all. Analysts are still trying to figure out where those problem will land in terms of P/L. All I want to know is how their shipping and automation investment are going because that is the key to future retail margins.I am much more interested in AWS. They killed it on that front. 39% growth given their size is crazy. Im also interested in how they are expanding on Ads. Thats still relatively new for Amazon and wasnt even on the radar 3-4 years ago. And of course I want to see how streaming will do after the MGM purchase and investment into in house exclusives. Streaming is very important because its tied to Prime and Prime is really where future retail money will be made (basically the Costco model).Last I want to hear more about robotics. I really like the Astro. Do they have plans to expand to other vision/hearing bots? I want a fully fledged cooking bot... I would pay through the nose for that if its high quality and lasts a good decade or so. Hell I might pay $20k for a cooking bot that can learn recipes and such... much rather have that than a expensive car. I would also pay for a gardening bot and a laundry folding bot. All of these eat hours and hours every week. Id rather have that time back to do other things.Could care less about the retail numbers.
"Still an amazing company with an impenetrable economic moat and great growth prospects. Therefore, I am going to hold the line!"
Heavy open Put Options at $3350 helping today. Will probably close about that...
"Amazon leads the world in the race to zero. Bezos killed thousands of businesses with strongarm policies and if you've ever had the displeasure of having to solve a problem behind the scenes as a Vendor — well, good luck! Customers have celebrated lower prices and in some ways an accelerated race to improve quality, but many throats have been slashed. We are now buying direct from the Chinese manufacturers, which is of course not only Amazon's fault, but a huge problem! Supply ""shortages"" are the direct consequence of Americans not making anything themselves and passing off the environmental responsibility to someone else."
don't be surprised to see both amazon and apple in the green during the trading day tomorrow just like google and shopify after bad ER AH and pre-market but both went green after initial fierce sell-offs good luck and good night folks
Over reaction of market.
A perfect buy opportunity here for AMZN and Google. Neither company is remotely close to Snap's small and limited business model.
"Inventory for Q4 in good shape. Supply chain issues are overblown. Labor costs, AWS and Q4 forecast will be the driver of the stock performance short term."
Congrats to thosethat didn't panic last night and today.
Tomorrow will be a good time to invest after the bell. Get your cash ready. Buy after earnings release!
"Amazon reports Q3 revenue of $110.81B, below a $111.55B consensus. GAAP EPS of $6.12 misses an $8.90 consensus."
"$3700 by Friday, in two days! If they announce a split; it will expect lode to $3950 on its way to $4100. After Black Friday sales, on its way to $4300 by Jan."
Why would anyone pay this much for a stock that doesn't even pay a dividend???
"After all the negative reports, AMZN only down 1.85% today. Bullish signal…$4100 at EOY.Buy the dip and stay long my friends!AWS alone will be bigger than TSLA!"

"""Free cash flow decreased to $2.6 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $29.5 billion for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2020"" - where is the money went? space travel ?"
This appears pegged at $3350. I don't know how they do it but AMZN trying to get to $3355 and it can't
Crazy undervalued trading in the same range as 2020 with AWS insane growth and cashflow.
"Looking for this stock to perform well after hours today. Today will be the beginning of a hugeupward spiral in weeks and months ahead. Josh Brown, CNBC, has been positive on the stock and even recommended it on the LAST TRADE segment today. Terrific company that has underperformed for a year now vs. indexes. Today begins a new trend to the UPSIDE!"
Institutional investors will focus on AWS. AWS is growing exponentially. This stock should hit ATH soon.
"I don't own AMZN stock directly, but I do have ETFs that contains AMZN stock. I think AMZN is still a valuable company. Its Cloud Service is the most valuable part. It will find a way to survive. long term wise, it is still a growing company."
Nearly half of Amazon's revenues now come from businesses where they have significant price controls as well as high margins. Everyone is focused on the ugly step child where margins are low and the operating costs are increasing (due to pricing pressure). Amazon could increase prices in the other businesses overnight and add instant profitability - but it has elected not to. Likely because it wants to ensure its leadership in those markets - scale and drive better and better margins. If you read this earnings' report and follow Amazon what they just delivered and where they are headed is really impressive.
Soon AMZN will no longer be buying fuel will be all electric all those distrubutiom and fulfilment people who won t work for less than $20 per hour will no lo ger be needed 24/7robotic autmationwill sort pick n pack to replace them amzn profits will go thur the roof ads is just start to grow early innings
Amazon passes fed ex in shipping for first time ever. Knew it would happen soon and glad. Fed ex is terrible at handling packages. They either come crushed or delivered to a neighbor.
"While the value of one's home typically accounts for most of the net worth of the average individual, most of the affluent and very rich generally have the majority of their wealth invested."
Back up the truck before market close and Ride this AWS Cashflow machine to $4000 next.
"AMZN is really becoming a CLOUD and AWS company and less a retailer.Of Amazon's $113.08 billion in total revenue, 13% is attributable to the cloud unit, and 54% of the company's operating income came from AWS."
tomorrow will be selloff in the morning bottom around 3200 and then the bounce back starts. Close a couple of points down and next week will regain momentum.
Just under $8.1 billion in ad revenue in q3….49% YoY growth w/ high margins this is another “AWS-like” high growth and high margin area of business. Consumer sales lower than services revenues for first time and services are the high margin areas. I believe evaluating Amazon solely by its low margin business is a big mistake.
"For perspective also (for anyone new that has this stock) - there have been $200 a share drops after earnings before - and look where it sits compared to 12, 24, 36 months ago."
AMZN is taking care of their business; they are expanding for delivering +$400B goods and services on a consistent basis. They are investing. They are preparing for even larger number of prime members and faster delivery. That is exactly what they should be doing. I don't care a bit about this drop. Holding.
Amazon missed its earnings from the Estimate of 8.92 versus Actual 6.12 that is a whopping 28.51%!!! The stock should drop accordingly about 10%
I wouldnt panic. Look at SHOP. Missed earnings and was down 60 pre-market only to surge back over 100 today. But yeah...Go ahead and sell and give the bargain hunters a nice buy-in point. Amazon is not going anywhere. Xmas is right around the corner. You think people are gonna put up with Black Friday stampedes and anti-maskers when they can sit back in the comfort of their homes and click? LOL...yeah. I'm not worried.
"good opportunity to buy before earnings. This will go over $3600 this week, IMHO"
"Will someone please help me understand why AMZN is $300 less than last quarter and has hardly grown in the last year, yet has shown incredible gains as well as helped so many buyers around the world during the last 18 months of Covid? Not to mention all the Prime movies, AWS, cloud, etc.? Appreciate your input."
"yep a lot of puts at 3350. today we will not take a huge loss, on Monday its going to go down a bit more."
"WalMart has pushed hard to take on Amazon online. It is working, I know I have bought WalMart online a lot lately, and some of the items actually comes to my door in a WalMart bag from the local store.As many excuses as Amazon makes for why it has had 2 bad quarters, I think they need to take a serious look at the competition from WalMart."
Huh up after hours what da ya know
