Apparently people don’t want to own dividend paying stocks anymore. They would rather overpay for money losing businesses like Lyft.
"Have the shorts started to retreat? They helped knock this down the last few trading sessions mercilessly. I know shorts had committed to buy over 8 million shares so hopefully they will add a little push up now. This merger could fall through and there are still two more normal dividends of $.43 cent in the next 4 months so we should see some recovery now. My last two buys are both green now but like most here I'm still way underwater. I'm still going to wait this out, collect the next two dividends and see if the company comes up with a better solution. Good luck to us long's who are still holding."
Wish I could figure out this play as it trades erratically on no news.......................
15.92 as of 11am yesterday--now 14.88 . Must be the ex/eff date 07/27/18 today causing the drop.
"The real question is whether they will still be renting property to the government in 5-10 years and will they still be paying an annual dividend of at least $1.50. History says they will so this one is now tucked away in my ""collect 10% per year"" pocket."
"If they are able to sell debt at 2.4%, it means their balance sheet looks good to the professional money people"
Will be back to $20 by March imo.
"After listening to the conference call, I believe the current dividend is safe. They talked about growth in the second half of 2019 and the possibility of future dividend increases. I’m glad I bought more last week."
"well GOV has been just crushed since they did the deal for First Potomac - investors see too much debt and potential dividend cut, rising rates and Trump's negative view of government also negative. Looking forward to a surprise next earnings - coverage of the dividend and sale of properties to reduce debt."
Today GOV cut to $8 from $11after they cut from $14 to $11
OPI is up $2 bucks in last 6 trading sessions. Maybe this has finally turned the corner.
"If i buy today, will i get the .43 dividend in Nov?"
"I'd like to know how GOV is benefiting from the merger. We have lost half the value before the announcement and yet management think's this is the right way to go as to increase shareholder value, how is that working so far?"
"Kaplan, President of Investor Consulting ""It's usually a very negative sign when a company does a reverse stock split"" Has it been announced by GOV management that they are definitely doing a 1 for 4 reverse stock split?"
"RMR filed a registration statement according to which OPI, HPT, and SNH will each be selling all of its stock in RMR. After the transaction, RMR will be owned entirely by public shareholders and the Adam Portnoy trust. So, this eliminates a complicating cross-ownership wrinkle. OPI will sell all of its 2.8 million shares of RMR common stock, yielding about $100 million. At OPI""s presentation during the NAREIT conference on June 4, 2019, OPI's CEO explicitly ruled out buying back stock. I imagine they will use the proceeds to pay down debt."
Green on a red market means good news for me .
"Does it begin trading ex-dividend tomorrow? Record date is Monday, April 29, right? If so, today must have been the last day to buy and still get the divvy. Wonder how much it gaps down at the open tomorrow."
Law firm should get into this and sue the board for destroying the company
What value have you assigned the raw land held by OPI which is on the books for nearly one billion. The raw land is NOT part of the math equation that you demonstrate.At book value this raw land adds $19.75 more per share.How do you reconcile this?
"We are at a 30% discount to book value. And an 8.3% dividend currently.Book value is calculated as the actual assets minus liabilities. That leaves approximately $1.8 billion times approximately 48 million shares outstanding according to the 8-K on 3/22/19 (http://govreit.com/investors/financial-information/default.aspx#quarterly). Using the exact numbers, that comes down to $37.50 per share.I can only think that book value will increase - especially since they are only paying out a fraction of earnings as dividends going forward. Although if they continue to renew leases at a 10% discount, that will hurt. At least the SIR assets saw a 4.4% increase in rent for their renweals. And they need to sell properties for what they paid or higher to prevent more loss to book value.Management. That is why I believe everyone has turned their eye on this stock. I cannot see any other reason with the majority of other REITs trading at higher than book value.Many on the board already know this, just reiterating what I see and why I doubled down yesterday. If this goes up to book value, that would be an almost 42% gain at the current price."
Great Company - the shares I bought at 18 are now worth under 10.
Based on current SIR and ILPT prices the corresponding (based on deal structure) GOV price is $11.53
"I read the annual report, to figure out how much GOV is worth.Here's is the crucial data I found in it:1. There are 0.1 billion shares2. The no. of SIR shares that GOV owns multiplied by current SIR price is about $0.5 Billion thus $5/share of GOV3. Total debt $2.4 billion or $24/share4. How much is the real estate worth? One can only get two types of values from the annual report (both are useless): One is the cost (how much GOV paid), but since some they bought a long time ago, its worth much more. The second is the ""book value"" which is even less useful, its the cost minus accumulated depreciation taken for reducing income taxes (cost minus about 3% per year). So how can I find the real estate's value.? Read number 5 below...5. Annual rent from the office buildings is $0.316 billion.Now let's compute the value!Cap rate (rent divided by value of real estate) that is prevalent for the type of office building that GOV has is around 4 to 5%.Cap rate Real Estate Value $/share real estate $/share (+SIR - debt)=========================================================5% 0.316 / 0.05 $63.2 Bil $44.27% 0.316 / 0.07 $45.1 Bil $26.1So why is this stock under $20 ?In the Past, Portnoy did a lot of abusive things, like using GOV's money (or rather borrowing ability) to buy SIR from HRP in order not to lose control of SIR after they lost control of HRP (which was renamed to commonwealth RIET). Portnoy (the father) passed away. So far his son has not done anything bad. So the market needs time to assess the son. Meanwhile we can buy $40 worth of real estate for under $20. Looks like a good deal to me. Are any of my numbers wrong? I appreciate anyone who can correct any errors."
What can one say? This is now worth $6 pre-split. The most massive destruction of value I've ever seen short of BK. Hope is that investors are using the rear view mirror not looking ahead.
"The current price of $25.75 translates to a pre-split $6.43. Already below the all-time low. How much longer before we go to post-split $16? That would be one-fourth of the pre-merger price. Helluva job, losing three-quarters of market cap in one deal!"
"Looks like the beat earnings. According to the Yahoo page, estimates were for 66 cents a share and actual was 71 cents. Glad to see that the renewals were an average of 12.8% in rent increases too. There was an uptick in the vacancy rate though - from 91.0% to 89.6%."
"I think we are entering the ""dividend-watch"" period. By my reckoning, there should be a dividend announcement exactly a week from today, Thursday, July 18. Fluctuations in stock price during the intervening five trading days will reflect the market's guesses on whether the quarterly dividend remains the same, gets cut, or goes up."
Looks like the only winners here are the insiders.
Does anyone know how many shares of RMR OPI owns? I think it’s worth around $22 million as of the last report. David said they had no plans on selling the shares.
"1 SIR = 1.4 GOV + special dividend = 11.5* 1.4 + SD , I don’t really know how to calculate the price, anyone explains ? Thanks for your help."
Any company news is just bad news for this company. It's pretty amazing to see that 1 day before .43 div stock drops almost $1.
"On October 16, 2018, when the stock opened at a (reverse-stock-split-adjusted) price of $40.40, Morgan Stanley analyst Vikram Malhotra set a 12-month price target of $41. Ever since, the stock has been retreating and hasn't come close to crossing that threshold. On June 17, 2019, when the stock opened at $24.02, the same genius analyst set a 12-month price target of $27. The stock reached that threshold two days later and crossed it today. And folks like him get paid the big bucks for this ""analysis"""
GOV Shareholders Sure Got Ripped Off. Mgmt. Gets Rich And Shareholders Loose Their Money.
Just playing with numbers but sometimes a kernel of truth can be gleaned. On 8/10/18 shares outstanding were 99.17 million and shorts were 7.88 million on the last reporting of 7/12/18 representing 7.94% of shares outstanding. Since 62.26% of outstanding shares are owned by institutions this leaves only 36.91million of stocks available for regular trading and this seems toindicate that 21.34% of stocks regularly available for trading are shorted and this seems high.
"Someone Likes The Results. They Are Very Confusing. Need To Be A CPA, Tax Lawyer, To Understand."
"Well, this Fridays first quarter financials will be posted. Considering that, we now get to see a glimps into OPI’s future. I only hope management doesn’t give shareholders that song and dance about how great their ratios look and tell us poor shareholders how in the world they took two companies and shrunk their combined market cap by 1/2 and slashed dividends."
"One thing is for certain, OPI is not priced according to it’s value. Market cap is only 1.6 billion on 5 billion in assets and 800 million a year in revenue. The merger and split caused confusion with pricing OPI. This should be much higher."
I voted no on the merger! What do you think our chances are to defeat the merger? I suppose it depends on the biggest holders like blackrock and fidelity. Any clues out there?
"Why would anyone with a functioning mind trust management after the way this stock has treated investors? Has anyone in the management bought shares recently with their own money? Even after market cap has dropped 900,000 million + or 60% insiders are not buying."
"If we assume a new payout at .60, then looks like this will drop below 10 before its stable."
Aren't REITs required to pay out 90% of their income as dividends? Won't OPI have to do that to be a REIT?
"The ""secret is out""...(recent article) OPI is externally managed by The RMR Group LLC, which has underperformed in several of its clients: Hospitality Properties Trust (HPT), Senior Housing Properties (SNH), Industrial Logistics Properties (ILPT), Tremont Mortgage Trust (TRMT), and, of course, OPI. To say that RMR has underperformed with its various managed REITs would be an understatement:"
"Holders of GOV: We've been had! This is an absurd deal. 1. The deal: Cut GOV's dividend by more than 1/2. 2. The deal: Raising capital by issuing shares in the stealth, done by forcing GOV to sell 27% of the company it is acquiring! This is dirty financial engineering at its worst. Shareholders' value is diluted without benefit.3. The deal: GOV shareholders being indirect owners of SIR get the shaft when it comes to the indirect ownership of ILPT.4. The deal: Incest relationship between the two companies controlled by RMR.The result: Your capital has lost 25% of its value over 24 hours at the time I am writing this. It is time to mobilize and vote NO."
"Stock cannot bleed 5% a day. The company has assets to sell and they won't go BK, but investors are taking it on the chin the last few months."
"My take as someone who bought in the mid-14s in the early summer. I saw a stock near its 52-week low with a long history of dividend stability. Digging deeper would have taken me beyond my abilities, which are limited in this area. I don't like having my substantial gains wiped out. I don't like the hole I'm in now. I don't like the deep dividend cut. This stock is no longer serving the purpose (income) that made me choose it in the first place. But I'm holding until I'm back to even, at least. And, then, I'll have to see whether there's reason to hold further. The announced merger/acquisition makes this a different stock from what many (including myself) thought we were buying. That is not, in itself, a crime or even poor judgment, on the part of management. There are many different ways of thinking about value."
According to broker Fidelity today is the ex div date. So the stock is “essentially” down 9 cents not 52 cents.
"RMR priced the offering of an aggregate 7.9 million shares by OPI, HPT, and SNH at $40 a share. That's slightly over a 20% discount from the $50.90 close on June 14, the last trading day before RMR announced the offering. Not too bad, given that the sale will almost double RMR's outstanding shares. As expected, the investment banks struggled to sell this large of an offering. But at $40 a share, OPI's 2.8 million shares should net well above $100 million, after expenses. What I don't understand is the decline in OPI's share price. Even if the offering had been priced at $50.90, the additional $30.52 million in proceeds to OPI would have amounted to no more than 63 cents a share. But OPI has been down over $2 as RMR declined in price to reflect the difficulty of placing this offering. Not sure what this portends. The ""smart"" play on June 17, the day the offering was announced, would have been to short RMR and go long on OPI (and HPT and SNH). Good thing I decided to play dumb ;-)"
"I'm not a short. Not trying to funny or gloomy. Bankruptcy not possible here, right? I figure I might as well hold."
"I am afraid the downside here is considerable. OPI is selling 36 properties with 5.9 million square feet for $750 million. That means $127 a square foot. Apply that to the entire portfolio of 213 properties with 30.2 million square feet, and you get a gross asset value of $3.83 billion. Subtract from that the $3.45 billion in debt, and you are left with 379 million in equity. Divide that over 48 million outstanding shares for a share price of $7.89. Ouch!!!!!!!!"
Is anyone considering a class action suit on behalf of shareholders??
"Appears to be a good buying opportunity when the sell off stops. IMHO, oversold at this point."
"Equities researchers at B. Riley issued their Q1 2019 earnings per share estimates for Office Properties Income Trust in a research note issued to investors on Tuesday, March 12th. B.

Sell all assets for $4.9 billion.Pay off all debt of $3.1 billion.Pay shareholders the remainder as a special dividend of $37/share.Close down the trust.
Why would anyone vote for this merger?
OPI mentioned on Mad Money on Friday. People are searching for high yield. I just watch the show to laugh.
"50% of book value..and GOV can't get out of it's own way because the market really doesn't trust RMR and Portnoy..the bright side, someone will come in and make a bid and #$%$ GOV right from under Jr's eyes. Happened before will happen again ..hopefully. Bid price will be about $9+. Third party will add it to their inventory and we'll wind up with another Dividend paying stock or cash. Management (insiders) only own less than 2%, and from history repeating itself, a slam bang. Management has basically ruined a good thing...IMHO...(but I've been right on Portnoy holdings before)."
"Bought back for $26.00 half the shares I had sold earlier for $27.65. Will probably regret it, but hope spring eternal ;-)"
"From the Prospectus: (in other words, dividend is expected to be $2.00 - $2.40 on the new stock) "" Following the Merger, GOV and SIR expect that the combined company's annual distribution will range between $0.50 and $0.60 per common share of beneficial interest (before giving effect to the one-for-four reverse stock split described above), based on a target payout ratio of 75% of the combined company's projected cash available for distribution, which is below GOV's current annualized distribution of $1.72 per share and SIR's current annualized distribution of $2.04 per share. The combined company may not be able to increase or maintain this expected distribution rate for various reasons"""
what will happen if this Deal Won't Go Through.
Outrageous!
RMR returned my phone calls. They said the div announcement is going out tomorrow am.
"Just wanted to let you know I phoned in to the quarterly conf. call to ask questions on the markets reaction to the merger, the dividend, rumors of a reverse stock split etc. and was cut off by the operator. I know I am not not their largest shareholder, but it's pretty clear that these guys don't seem to think they owe shareholders any explanations of the exceptionally poor reaction their getting from their merger plans."
"Several points:The company reported normalized funds from operations (FFO) of $0.50 per share, down from $0.58 a year ago but above the Capital IQ consensus estimate of $0.42 per share. (Is that a real negative?)Total revenue increased to $107.2 million from $66.0 million but missed the estimated $107.6 million. (hardly a significant “”miss”).Completed significant leasing volume in the fourth quarter of 2017, entering new and renewal leases for over 520,000 square feet with a 3.3% average roll up in rent. (Bad???)The integration of Potomac is complete and initial property level operating results relating to that acquisition have exceeded expectations. (Exceeding expectations is a negative?)FFO of 50 cents vs expected 58 cent was disappointing but the dividend appears intact.One can imagine an improved FFO in the futureThat 94.2% of GOV’s total rentable square feet was leased, compared to 95.0% as of September 30, 2017 is still excellent. (Are investors supposed to panic over that percentage difference).Potomac has a 93.3% occupancy rate which is decent enough with room to improve.Todays sharp decline appears to be excessive especially if the dividend is going to be maintained. PS. Book value stands close to $14 per share"
This seems to be the market's reaction to the sad news that we are stuck with Adam Portnoy for another three years.
"SA has article entitled: ""Government Properties - Expect Dividend To Be Cut By A Third."" 66 reader comments.But one has to have a PRO membership to read this.Anyone know what the analysis was?Of course GOV market price has been signalling a dividend cut for awhile. There is a concern that GOV will have some cash flow problems when it needs to fix up properties to the liking of new tenants. This may be what the SA author was looking at."
"See it just needed to see the 10s and now hopefully we can stay above $11 and stabilize. When you look at the future combined company (if it passes) the combo does look appealing. It’s better diversified,has high grade tenants, is over 90% occupied, and will have a better balance sheet"
I think all disappointing investors should send an email to investor relations at GOV to: ir@govreit.com
Time For Sam Zell To Buy These Guys Out And Send Management To Borneo Or Havana.
"B. Riley Raises Office Properties Income Trust's PT to $42 from $38, Says Well-Positioned to Grow; Keeps Buy Rating"
check out the institutions and insiders; they are buying !!!
SIR getting gutted today also. This feels like institutional investor capitulation. Nobody on Wall St. trusts or wants to be anywhere near this mgmt. team. Actually comical now even though I'm still long.....
Absolutely no sense with this stock. Down almost 10% when the market and almost everything else is up. SIR going down at the same rate now that it is a done deal. SIR stock a bit higher since they get 1.04 shares of GOV once the merger is done. The assets of this company are worth almost double what the current price is. Oh well. Others brought the stock way down with the purchase of Potomac too and it recovered very well. Just forget the daily action and come back in a few months and see where we are at. I'm definitely loaded up very heavily in GOV compared to other stocks because of the significant value here. That is how Warren Buffett invests.
"Couple of questions if anyone can answer:#1 - REITs are required to pay out a minimum of 90% earnings as dividends/distributions to get the tax sheltered advantages. With OPI paying less than that, do you believe that they will have to start paying income taxes?#2 - How is FFO calculated? Is it based purely on real income minus expenses? That means asset depreciation not factored in?#3 - Once concern I have is in the report, there showed to be pretty big gains off one-time items. Sale of properties and another one was 'unrealized gain' on RMR stock. So apparently they must change their EPS based on what the value of RMR stock is? So if RMR stock goes down, then it will cause our EPS to suffer? Or maybe I read this part wrong. Looking at the Yahoo press release (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/office-properties-income-trust-announces-110000648.html), 46 cents is based on that unrealized gain and another 46 cents based on the sale of properties. So if earnings were 71 cents and you subtract the one-time items, it is actually a loss."
"The earnings report does not justify this sharp decline. Total revenue increased to $107.2 million from $66.0 million but missed the estimated $107.6 million. Completed significant leasing volume in the fourth quarter of 2017, entering new and renewal leases for over 520,000 square feet with a 3.3% average roll up in rent. The integration of Potomac is complete and initial property level operating results relating to that acquisition have exceeded expectations. The dividend remains in tact accotding to CC That 94.2% of GOV’s total rentable square feet was leased. Book value stands close to $14 per share."
"From the September level of $68, the stock has shed almost 2/3rd of its value, with no apparent change in the company's business environment or on-the-ground operations. All the result of corporate shenanigans: merger and property divestitures. Takes a special sort of genius to destroy shareholder value that way."
GOV at $17 on Aug 31. Now at $8.50 on Oct 31 Is the management going to make any attempt explain this on their conference call tomorrow? How are they going to explain this? What do you think their going to say?
"I believe the dividend is expected to start out in the $2.00 to $2.20 range for the year, which is around 7% at this price level. I'm certain they will be raising the dividend in the future as well when things improve. I also believe fair value is a lot closer to $60 bucks than $30. The future is starting to look bright again."
The current market cap is barely above the total price they paid for potomac. The current price appears to be a bargain. 17.3 million sq feet of space and 107 properties in 29 states of which 62% are rented to government entities .
The management says the advantage for gov is a more diversified tenant base. What is the advantage of a more diversified tenant base when your main tenant is the US government. Is there a less risky tenant out there?
"I also have not seen my share of OPI show up in my account yet, my broker is Ameritrade."
$13.39 one year target probably a bit low. More like $16.
Looks like gov found a temporary bottom.
down again. Market is up GOV is down. Market is down GOV still down.
I think one aspect of GOV many over look is the fact they just raised about 500M at a share price 5 dollars higher than it trades now (18.50).https://finance.yahoo.com/news/government-properties-income-trust-prices-233000517.htmlhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/government-properties-income-trust-announces-120000167.htmlIn addition they were able to float a bond at 4% interest for the next 4 years...before interest rates started rising.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/government-properties-income-trust-prices-214500080.html
Shorties are going to pay that fat dividend at the end of the month. Going higher.
"This latest decline began March 1, the day after the annual and quarterly results came out. Today saw the lightest volume since then. We might be clutching at straws here, but that is one indication that the selling could be easing off."
"It's accelerating downward, and the volume is picking up. An RMR-Portnoy special coming up? Some bad news that they have been hiding? I said earlier, the downside risk is greater than the forlorn hope that the stock price will catch up to its ""true value."" It could break below $20."
"I think it is headed down to, if not below, its all-time low of 25.94. That was on December 21, and was probably the result of tax-motivated selling. This seems driven by one or more institutions fleeing."
"Office Properties Income Trust ( OPI Loading...Loading...) today announced a regular quarterly cash distribution on its common shares of $0.55 per common share ($2.20 per share per year). This distribution will be paid to OPI's common shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 27, 2020 and distributed on or about February 20, 2020."
"I would think the real estate has appreciated a lot since this companies' inception, but the stock seems to languish and not go anywhere."
"My understanding of the calculus of this deal was that the SIR shareholders were to receive a GOV that was trading at $17 a share. Now that it is the 11s, doesn't that change things. If balance sheet confusion is the problem, can't GOV just slowly divest itself of SIR instead - or just give GOV owners those shares as a special dividend? Is this a case where the shareholders can step in a make a difference as I don't see how this is in the best interest of the GOV owners."
This has to be the worst company in the entire market. How can you rent to mostly government entities and lose money?
"Gov will be changed to OPI and the dividend will be 50-60 cents, which when the recession hits may not hold."
"$700,000,000 loss of shareholder value in one mouth. Does anyone doubt the absolute integrity of management?"
When is the DIV DECLARATION DATE. It is the 16th and the latest date ever was 4/13. Why not declare the dividend and end the hemorrhaging?
The next dividend announcement is coming up soon. Buy now before it’s too late.
"I don't think this decline is the results of institutional shareholders offloading. I suspect that had already happened earlier this year. I would venture that risk arbitrageurs acquired moderate quantities of stock in the immediate aftermath of the quarterly earnings report coming out, expecting to see a quick 10% or so appreciation on the back of upgrades, and when that failed to materialize, are now liquidating."
Whoever wrote this after the merger was announced nailed it!https://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/Government_Properties_Income_Trust/2818335034#description
"portnoys, popeo and trustess continue with the shell game. - they do these spinoffs - create a complicated structure then merge them back. - where;s the pea? - in portnoy's pocket"
I am an 83 yr old retiree and have been in this stock (sorta like a bond) for the past 5 years and I have seen it as low as $12 and as high as $26 but I have never considered this income investment for its growth potential. This is for retires who want better than 1% on their Bank deposits.
"Just went through the Merger transcript on SA. Couldn't find any mention of a 1:4 reverse post merger.The only reference I could find to this potential action was from the analyst at B. Riley who said:""GOV expects to do a 1-to-4 reverse stock split after the deal closes, a tidbit that wasn't in Monday's press release""."
"JIM 6 months ago the stock price was $17 or today's price of $68, Right now we are at $32. 6 months ago the dividend was at $1.72 or today's price of $6.88. Right now we are at $2.20. They say after you take out the SIR income GOV was getting from SIR, the Dividend would fall to $1.20 or today of $4.80. After all the benefits of the merger, great properties, long term leases, reduced costs etc. OK, then pay me the $4.80. No, can't do that can only pay a 75% pay out. But that would be $3,60 not $2.20. With the stock price cut by more than 50%, and the dividend cut by more than two thirds, what's the advantage to shareholders? I can see the advantages to management in creased management income but what's the advantage to shareholders?"
"THE TRUTH ABOUT RMR: Office Properties Income Trust (OPI) is one of the most undervalued REITs on the market, in no small part thanks to doubt of its future due to a troubled past. Before becoming OPI, the company was known as Government Properties Trust (GOV) and, despite the seeming security of a REIT focused on renting office space to the U.S. government, a combination of mismanagement by external managers RMR Group (RMR) and declining demand from the public sector made GOV unsustainable.A merger with Select Income REIT (SIR) and a spin-off of GOV’s office properties, and OPI was born. In that transition, however, GOV shares were massively devalued, thus accelerating a trend that had plagued the company for years: While the devaluation was well deserved, OPI looks oversold right now for a variety of reasons that I wish to address here.ManagementOPI is externally managed by The RMR Group LLC, which has underperformed in several of its clients: Hospitality Properties Trust (HPT), Senior Housing Properties (SNH), Industrial Logistics Properties (ILPT), Tremont Mortgage Trust (TRMT), and, of course, OPI. To say that RMR has underperformed with its various managed REITs would be an understatement:"
"With the announcement of no dividend cut, why is the price dropping still?"
Who can have any confidence in the Board or management when they have continually failed to do anything the investing public considers positive.
Same here. TD Proxies arrived today. All went back NO!!!!
OPI just received a Moderate Buy rating from Tipranks. It’s too bad people sold at the bottom.
If the deal was good would the stock be down 25%. Remember what happened to the stock when they bought First Potomac.This is the second time shareholders have been led over the cliff.
"Wall St. is day-trading this stock. Strong selling, followed by strong buying. The bottom seems to be around 13. We won't know if the dividend will be cut until the next conf. call. My guess is no. They just acquired First Potomac, and it takes time to integrate into overall operations. I'm holding this, not panic selling the stock."
"Just read SIR earnings transcript. Looks like proceeds from the sale of SIR shares was used to pay down GOV debt which is great for GOV. I don't see why GOV should take on more debt by merging with SIR and assume their expiring leases. Better stay solo and lean. Less debt means more money avail for distributions. Vote ""no"" on the merger."
I like to take poll at what price do you think gov will be trading at 1 months from now and why please post below
Want to know how good a deal this is for us GOV shareholders? Just look at the share price after the CC. My bet is we are getting hosed.
Reverse split 1 for 4 will happen Jan. 2 so 100 shares becomes 25 of the new merged company OPI. The opening price should be in the 20s (4x6+) but if the announced .60 annual dividend is on the split shares that's a yield of about 2.5% - my jaw just dropped writing that. If true - that the dividend will be .60 cents post split - we're in for one h*ll of a slide.
Funds from operations (FFO) refers to the figure used by real estate investment trusts (REITs) to define the cash flow from their operations.Gov had a FFO of 50 cents last quarter.
Great company. Great management. The shares I bought for 18 are now worth 11.
"As of June 30, BlackRock owned 8 million of 48 million outstanding shares, or about 16.67 percent, down 4.5 million shares from March 31. Also, as of June 30, Vanguard owned 7 million shares, or about 14.59 percent, down 9.4 million shares from March 31. Both of the top two institutional shareholders have significantly pared down their respective holdings in the last quarter."
The dividend is still green money. That's the only thing positive O can say.
"Redundant costs will be reduced, dead wood will be terminated, renovate some old but valuable dogs, increase rentals, First Potomoc will be pruned to its fruit bearing properties with solid cash flow..Give them a year to make those moves and you will have a lean machine making its bones on secure properties not replaceable at the costs of building and sales revenues will be used to cut debt. The old dependable Plan A when cleaning up a large merger. Dip now is a buying opportunity..for long term holders."
The Portnoys reputation and concern for investors has been well documented.
"Just reading more tea leaves, as many millions of $ of excess properties are sold any original over booking of First Potomac properties does not create a cash loss (FFO is not negative impacted) but deminishes book value by a lot and shareholders value and this goes the same for the non cash loss on the SIR stock sale multi million $ loss. Book value has taken a huge hit from someplace, any one know?"
"I understand the frustration with the merger and the share price decline, but surely it’s oversold at this point. ILPT has been beat up and SIR is barely above its pre announcement price. All three are pretty cheap."
What was the loss on the SIR stock sale? Maybe several hundred million? Purchased at $31 2014 and sold for $18 2018 any one know?
On Oct 2009 Gov paid 50 c div. That was cut 20% on Jan 2010 to 40 cents. Shortly thereafter it moved up to $27
"The other shoe may have just dropped. OPI filed a shelf registration statement for public offering of debt, common and preferred stock, and warrants ""from time to time."" Selling assets (both buildings and RMR stock) to pay down debt, while getting ready to issue more debt and equity. If I didn't know any better, I would say that this looks, walks, and talks like a Ponzi scheme. And do I really know any better?"
Are the good times back again for OPI and SNH share-holders?
"Thanks for lowering the price just for me. Bought tons of GOV.Now, I just need to collect my 12% dividend (half of which is tax free because this is a REIT)every 3 months."
I encourage everyone to take the time to read this summation of the merger. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4207016-government-properties-income-trust-gov-and-select-income-reit-announce-agreement-merge
"As of December 31, 2018, BlackRock held 15.65 million (pre-split) shares. That's up from 9.4 million (pre-split) shares on September 30, 2018. Is BlackRock hedging, or does it actually expect an increase in share price in the near term?https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364742/000021545719001536/us38376a1034_012819.txt"
BlackRock has increased its ownership stake in GOV in the last quarter by over 45% to 15.9%. What do they know that we don't? Will they vote against the merger?https://fintel.io/so/us/gov
"Seems like the earnings report is still causing investors to leave, like Ajay. Stocks never follow logic or 'make sense' but with the book value being around $37 a share, we're now $10 a share below that. Question is... how long will it take for this stock to turn around and get more back to book value? I just can't see taking a loss on it right now myself. Most other stocks I own are all at a premium to the book value except for XAN which had a falling out with management but it has been progressively getting better and they have increased the dividend again."
Done deal. 90% of the shareholders approved. That is a really high number. Certainly shows that they had the institutions on board and us little folks mean nothing.
"If half of the 12.45 million Broker Non-Votes had been cast against Adam Portnoy, he would not have been elected Managing Trustee, and this thing might have started approaching its fair value!"
On paper this looks good for us. Sellers must think there is an arbitrage. Volume in pre market is small...butgood question. What do we get out of this deal?
Someone needs to look into this companies Management to assure share holders that Management is working in share holders best interest. JMHO.
Will Someone Take Over This Company And Stop The Management From Ignoring The Real Owners? The Shareholders.
Shareholders lost over 400 million today! And to think gov executives and trustees are filling their pockets with money.
"Well, I am so looking forward to May 3rd when the first quarter conference call is aired because I have persevered through nothing but bad news and surely there will be a little good news to give me hope for the future of OPI."
"Dividend the same as expected. Would have been nice to see 56 cents instead of 55 but that won't happen, even though OPI can easily afford it. Any good news is a positive and maybe that would help get the stock stabilized and moving up."
Dividend is SAFE for the rest of 2018 and they will reevaluate in January of 2019.
my vote is no. You must be joking voting yes on this.
"After an underwriting discount of $2.50, OPI will sell 2.8 million RMR shares at $37.50 a share for aggregate proceeds of $105 million. In addition, the sale entails expenses of about $1 million to be shared by all selling shareholders. So, OPI will net about $104.75 million from its RMR stake. Meanwhile, RMR stock has climbed back to the $47 level. At almost a $10 spread, that's about $25 to $28 million that rightfully belonged to OPI now in the pockets of the investment banks who ""placed"" the RMR stock. With friends like these, . . ."
"Welp, I did it and already down since my purchase. Pretty well doubled my position at $26.68 to average down by quite a bit. Here goes to hoping that a good earnings report will get this moving the opposite direction. The book value of the company is worth more than this - but we all know that and it has been under book value all this year."
Well here is hoping that in a few days that when 2019 numbers are posted that we see a clean income and balance sheet. By that I mean the 500 to one billion in losses associated with the first Potomac purchase and SIR stock sale has finally been flushed through the financials. I’m hoping for the best.
This should sell at 9% dividend yield Stock should rise close to 19 at current dividend of $1.68 per year I will hold my shares
Any insight on price drop Ajay? Just doesn't seem to be any interest in the stock with low volume too. Still trending further down.
The dividend of $.50-$.60 is pre spli $2.00-$2.40 post splitInvestor services returned my call. They also said there will be more compelling information released with the proxy in two weeks.
They booked $24 million in income on the sale of the DC property. That's 50 cents a share. And the stock is down over 6%. Makes no sense.
The Portnoy cartel rarely misses an opportunity to align their interest with that of their shareholders.
I Don't Think This Deal Will Go Through.
My Broker Feels There Will Be No Shareholder Vote. Done Deal. Wrong Or Right?
"I think the quarterly dividend will be above $0.60. Closer to $0.75. Stock should stabilize around $32-$33, until the earnings announcement."
"I’m buying in my personal taxable account now. Already own a bunch in my IRA. Holding onto those shares for at least 15 years to collect tax-free dividends. Looking at the balance sheet, I see no reason to sell."
I know the management has not been great in the past. But the move to combine GOV with SIR was a right move. It is now just focused in office sector with cleaner and more straightforward financials. I would not be surprised if it gets a takeover offer. It is now the best REIT bargain out there. Hopefully the management has learned the consequences of mismanaging the company and will be making the right decisions going forward.
Up to its old behavior today - competing for the most hated stock. I though fundamentals were improving here.
"GOV... Would be lowest close since May 23, 2018 when it closed at $14.06-- Would be largest percent decrease on record (Based on available data back to June 3, 2009)"
Very nice - finally broke through $30 a share today. Markets must like the fact that they have sold additional properties and are making progress on their promises.
My apologies to Robert. It was Ron that posted that he read S&P upgraded GOV debt to stable. Ron if you can please site the source. Moody’s reiterated the negative outlook. Not sure how they see it differently and lik Robert said the balance sheet will improve so it should have a better outlook.
Anyone think they can sell a lot of properties and buy back a load of stock???
Finally meshing after the last buyout. Looking good going forward.
"For Gov shareholders who were counting on the $1.72 distribution, the cut to $.60 is catastrophic. If new purchasers are looking for 6% income, the shares are worth $10.As previously said, the Portnoys are at it again."
"The net book value of the DC property on both the Form 8-K filed on March 18, 2019, and the balance sheet as of December 31, 2018, was $45.734 million. That was its ""Depreciated Carrying Value."""
Bought more today almost at the low. I’ll take the 9% dividend yield if nobody else wants it.
"Larry- I know your angry, but it’s not Robert’s fault. He’s just giving his perspective and some good information."
When Are These Guys Going To Jail? Why Do The Senior Executives Get Rich And The Regular Stockholders Lose Money?
Shorts have to be getting very nervous. We could have lift off in near future. There is a large gap to make up and a lot of shares borrowed.
So here is a crazy theory and it is all bases around RMR. A huge chunk of their revenue depended on GOV and SIR. Both GOV and Sir were decently primed for being bought because of size which could then tank RMR stock. So RMR execs then had GOV buy Potomac which put them in a sizable debt and a little less attractive. Then bought a huge Chunk of SIR with GOV so they could keep them from getting bought out while maintaining RMR revenue stream. Then when numbers lined up and they came up with a good enough proposal for a merger to get least amount of rsistance OPI.
"In my opinion, the merger was a set up from the beginning....namely, when gov bought 1.2 billion worth of properties they knew they could not afford, which was the wedge the ceo and cohorts put into play the screwger.........and if you dont think you got screwed, just do the simple math: 4 shares of SIR (annual dividend 2 dollars) got you one share of OPI, paying you 2.10 . In other words, you gave up 8 dollars in dividends for 2.10 in dividends. Same thing applies to GOV. If this isnt considered screwing the shareholders, who own the companies, I dont know what is. It was set up from the beginning, imo."
"What to make of OPI at this time? Last report wasn't bad, FFO covered div well, renewed rentals and rent payments ok. But going forward is hard to see. Certainly the tanking stock reflects this uncertainty. Personally, I don't think the work from home is going to be as strong as advertised, once pandemic passes. The isolation and zoom zombification are negatives."
"Well, I’m an 85 year old retiree who dumped a major portion of my retirement $ in 2013 into several thousand shares of GOV and SIR pretty much evenly split between the two. Over this time span I have seen the good the bad and the ugly. The good was the first 5 years, the bad was GOVs desperate need to merg with SIR that appeared as a complete surprise and was followed by a precipitous drop in GOVs share price. What happened? Was it GOVs July 9, purchase of 21,500,000 sh of SIR at 31.51 per sh and later sold at 18.50 per share which resulted in a huge multi million $ loss? (do the math) Was it GOVs purchase of First Potomac for 1.4 billion that on 5/2/17 John Banister an reporter for Bisnow, Washington, DC said that Stifels analyst John Guinee rated First Potomac a SELL and further said that the talk of a merger with GOV as “rope-a-dope” ( what does that mean?). Well, I’m ready to move on, no sence crying over spilled milk, as they say."
"georgio: the main purpose was to make more money for RMR and its main stockholder since they are paid based upon the percentage of property under management; A 1.2 billion dollar number results in a LOT more fees for RMR and its head man, Adam Portnoy. In 45 years in the market, I have never seen such a maneuver that was in direct conflict with shareholders' interest; and some lawyers feel the same way since suit has been filed against the RMR gang in federal court over this merger maneuver."
It’s been holding above $11 for two hours. That may be the support level. My prediction is it gravitates back to $12 till the vote is done.

"Dividend cut impending??? See they announced dividend 7 days ahead of last ex-dividend date. Don't see the announcement yet. Guess is it is coming in matter of days. If so, and it is cut, might be worth waiting to purchase on the downswing. Likely to occur within next week or so."

"Share price is at a point that we may be having some eyes on us for a takeover, that will be warmly welcomed to get out of the grips of RMR and the Portnoy's .."
Amazing! Shareholders have only lost $550 million since Friday.
"So, I guess I should sell GOV now and take a 30% loss because the talk is bad, and buy a stock where the talk is good. When the talk turns bad on the 2nd investment, then I should more onto another ""feel good"" stock. This looks like a good way to lose most of your money over time!"
"As I said, they will beat the estimates and be upbeat on the call, and the stock will pop a little, and then the gains will peter out quickly. The guidance for the rest of the year couldn't really have been more optimistic. But the market stays away from the putrid Portnoy smell!"
"Ill tell you what this stock is a lesson learned. I typically look at product and financials to see the health of a company. This looked good with government properties and high payouts. I didn't factor in the management team of RMR / Pourtney's. Lesson learned from now on whenever I buy a smaller high yield product I am investigating ownership and history of the management team. It seems clear that this team is just above grifter class, I will never get the money invested back I recognize that now but I will keep a bit of this to remind myself to stay away form these guys"
Bullish pattern detected.
What do you call people who willingly turn 25% of your assets into dust in a matter of hours.
"Don when I bought GOV 5 years ago my main focus was dividend income and I have not been disappointed. REITS are not growth stocks but stocks that pay historical high dividends. The recent purchase of Potomac, last November, has created a false picture of their financials going forward due to the heavy expenses of merging. Now, I am sure that the Board has a strategic plan to make the shareholders happy so let's give them a few quarters to prove value. On May 3 we will get a financial review of progress made. Hopefully it's posivitive."
"Looks like GOV s ready to offload all of it's shares of SIR - offering announced for 24,918,421 shares. At current value, that is approximately $528,021,340.99 before selling fees. Wow, that is half of GOV's market cap right now. They should just use that to pay down debt and be done with this merger."
"As a public service to newbies, and do not understand how RMR runs things, I refer you to:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/803649/000110465913016872/a13-5944_10ex99d3.pdfhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-know-reit-management-could-190814292.htmlIt has not changed over the years."
and those who own SNH watch out; they can barely cover the dividend now and they have real problems with Five that are not easily solved. I see a dividend cut this year but will not be announced until insiders short it . Just my old man opinion
"The last two Qs, they have beaten estimates and been upbeat on the earnings call, and the stock has popped, but then the gains have petered out very quickly. I suspect the same thing will happen May 3. The market just doesn't believe management anymore. And who can blame the market? They kept insisting all was well, and the dividend was sustainable, right to the very end, until they couldn't sustain the fiction any longer. It's not that the terms of the merger were terrible, but that they had to resort to it to keep GOV afloat that #$%$ everyone."
"Just some interesting stats: gov reported tossed 10k 12/31/17 shareholder equity of 1.3 bil; sir reported to sec 10k 12/31/17 1.9 bil shareholder equity; they merged 12/31/18 and OPI reported to sec 10k shareholder equity of 1.7 bil. The total combined shareholder value would seem to be 3.2 bil were it not for sirs stock div to their shareholders of all ilpt stock with a book value of 500 mil leaving a combined book value, it would seem, of 2.7 bil. I have no definitive answer except maybe somewhere in the sir stock sale and first Potomac deal is some answers for the missing 1 bil."
The Portnoys are at it again. They continue to build their fortune at the expense of shareholder's.
"Who ever invest in RMR, HPT, SNH, ILPT, TRMT, OPI, should research what the Portnoy did to SIR and GOV about a year ago. Investor lost money.. glad I dump them cutting my lost to a couple of thousand dollars. I invested with them because of the promise of high dividend and all the analyst giving them a thump up. Also research about the lawsuit with the Portnoy regarding CCW (that stock symbol longer exist though). I do not short these company, because the Portnoy can manipulate those company they control. I just don't want investor like us to lose money."
According to news and comments on SA - OPI will be selling its RMR shares - another genius move - a few months ago these 2+ million shares were valued in the $90s - now $50 - these guys will continue to amaze.
DC SALE: aquire @46mmSale 70mm= 24mm profitIt's a fact.
"Page 12 shows the Total Shareholder Equity of $1.787007 billion. That is the amount of assets minus liabilities. Divide that by 48,091,903 shares and you get a NAV value of $37.16. Posting this since there was a question about the value per share the company has. https://s22.q4cdn.com/479231927/files/doc_financials/quarterly/2019/Q1/OPI_NR_1Q19_Earnings-Release_FINAL.pdf"
"So question... I read where GOV plans a 4-1 reverse split immediately after the closing of the merger. If this is true and they plan a $0.50 to $0.60 dividend. What the heck will that push the yield to? Assuming the price stabilizes at $12 (a big assumption and one I doubt, but I have to have some price to calculate a forward yield), that would put the price after the reverse split at $48. So the question is whether that $0.50 to $0.60 dividend they mentioned would be multiplied by 4 or is it that they plan that range AFTER the reverse split? Even if multiplied by 4, wouldn't that make drive the yield under 5% at best? I got out today and took a big loss and won't even consider getting back in until there is more clarity on just what the plans are. Since I sold today I won't get to vote but if I could, I would still vote against it. SIR holders got the moon and GOV holders got the shaft."
institutional holders will decide if deal goes thru or not; individual shareholders do not have enough shares combined to make any difference whatsoever
"FFO virtually unchanged from a year ago in Q1. Looks like the latest panic-stricken sellers didn't know what they were talking about, as usual."
"Another brilliant call by another brilliant analyst ;-) Today, June 28, Michael Carroll of RBC Capital raised OPI from ""sector underperform"" to ""sector perform"" and set a 12-month price target of $27. The stock had closed yesterday, June 27, at $25.16. On May 8, Jonathan Petersen of Jeffries had raised OPI from ""underperform"" to ""hold"" with a similar 12-month price target of $27. The stock had closed the previous day, May 7, at $26.68 and had seen an intra-day high of $27.90. Someone needs to tell these overpaid analysts what the term ""target"" means!"
"HOLD OR SELL? GOV has been hit the past two days as Forbes/Richard Lehmann came out and switched from Buy to Sell for his Income Investor followers. Of course, it was in his ""low risk"" portfolio before, so I am not sure how prescient he is. With that said, the risk of a 1/3 dividend cut is real. I do not think it will happen this quarter though and the ex-divdend date is coming up soon so it would not be wise to sell at this juncture. If the next earnings show improved or rising AFFO that still covers the dividend, GOV will quickly recover. If AFFO is poor, management credibility even if they don't force cutting the dividend will be tested. However, even if they it the dividend 30%, this will still be an 8% sustainable yield and the stock has already baked that in at these prices. If it gets any lower, GOV starts to become a takeover target. So, my advice, hold the month for sure, collect the dividend and wait for earnings ..oh and cross fingers"
Recently updated book value: $37.16. Trading right now at $25.56?? Is the business really deteriorating that rapidly? What other factors could be in play here?
"I just looked at 10 year chart for GOV. In 2016 it was down near these levels, as market doubted their ability to keep leases up. It quickly rose to near 25. I also counted the dividends over that period, 34 in all at least .40 (lately more). That's over $13 in dividends. I suspect in a year or so we will look back and wonder what in the world the market was doing here."
"This is outstanding for shareholders. Fourth Quarter Normalized FFO Available for Common Shareholders of $66.4 Million, or $1.38 Per Share. The $.55 dividend is safe and maybe will be increased in the near future."
It will be over $17 per share within four months Good income stockPays 11% at current levelStrong cash flow easily covers dividend
"Fiduciary duty connatates a boards responsibility toward shareholders. Currently the boards are basically the same for OPI as they were previously for RMR, SIR and GOV all interwound. The independent directors have impressive resumes but little experience in large complex real estate matters must surely relie on the management directors for guidance. In Oklahoma during the 1988 oil bust years many independent directors filed bankruptcy duetothe managing directors miss direction of the boards fiduciary duty. D & O policy’s always have “outs” and can be voided under certain circumstances. Two pending lawsuits have been instigated alleging shareholder issues. One filed11/12/18 by Levi & Korsinky LLP and the second filed 11/16/18 by Monteverde & Associates PC. Both law firms are very large firms with reputations for recovering large multimillion dollar settlements."
Research RMR management the destroy the reit and then merge or sell to change the stock symbol.
Have we figured out what happens to the 50-60 cent annual dividend after the 1 for 4 stock split?
Nice to know someone insider sold 7000 shares the day before the shares tanked.... I guess it wasn't insider trading... just pot luck ha?http://archive.fast-edgar.com//20180917/ASAZ622C8Z2262ZZ27JW2MZZ2CWIZ2V2ZVA2/
"Odd trading behavior. OPI was up yesterday after the announcement and today it hasn't found a bottom yet, even after being down 7%. I couldn't make heads or tails out of this last report especially since NONE of the SIR income was included - since the merger was not completed. The next quarterly report should give a much clearer picture since all of the income/expenses will be factored in."
"insiders hold 2%, institutions hold 62%, leaving investors holding 36% so the vote should easily be NO NOI NO! I can not figure this one out at all- how do they expect to get this one passed? only positives will be less debt and higher quality holdings-- and even tht is speculative."
"1 property sold in the Q. Two more under contract. Disposition of properties moving along well. $0.55 FFO easily covers the $0.43 dividend resulting in 1.28 coverage. I think we can dispel with the notion of a dividend cut anytime soon.""Government Properties Income Trust saw continued positive leasing momentum in the first quarter of 2018, entering new and renewal leases for over 280,000 square feet with a 4.9% average roll up in rent. Same property occupancy increased to 95.3% during the quarter, a 20 basis point increase compared to year end. We also continued to advance our property disposition plans, completing the sale of one office property in the quarter. The marketing of additional properties for sale continues to progress, with two office properties currently under agreement to sell for $129.3 million and additional properties identified to market for potential sale during the quarter."""
I’m going to own more shares than Blackrock if this selling continues. Buying the panic.
"All the good news is out, and the stock is back where it was last week before the earnings report came out. It is hard to see how the earnings report and the call that followed could have been any better. Yes, the occupancy rate ticked down a little, but the CEO explained on the call that that merely reflected the higher vacancy rates in the buildings already under contract for sale. Once those sales are completed in the second quarter, he added, the occupancy rate will be comfortably into the 90% range. Unless they are cooking the books or lying through their teeth, every reason for the stock price to go up has been made public. And the only discernible reaction from analysts: Jeffries upgraded the stock from underperform to hold, and increased their price rages from $23 to $25!!!! If there are any surprises between now and the next quarter's earnings report, they can only be negative ones. I am not saying there will be bad news, all I am saying is that the good news has already been factored in. And the stock just refuses to go above $27-28. But if there is any bad news, it will quickly descend into the low $20s and perhaps even below that. I am at a loss to see how this stock gets back to even the levels we saw this January, when there was so much uncertainty about the effects of the merger."
"If GOV owns real estate, doesn't it stand to reason that over time the real estate will appreciate in value, and the stock should go up to?"
I'm confused on what we are receiving under this deal
I could be hallucinating but I think they just made a wise business decision - sale of property.
