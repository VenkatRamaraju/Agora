"This 'junk bond' issue is troubling, to say the lease. I am becoming increasingly uneasy about this one. I can just picture investors hurrying toward the turnstiles, crowding to be the first to exit.

"Gentlemen of Ardagh Group S.A. (ARD) or Ardagh Metal Packaging S.A (AMBP). I feel very mortified by what they have done, I just informed myself that the shares that I have in my broker I cannot make any movement (buy or sell) because they have left the NYSE market, I do not know what the intention is in leaving ARD shareholders Without any endorsement, they should have made the exchange with all shareholders without discrimination, since there are shareholders who have just been informed of the exchange that they have made from ARD to AMBP, this fact will be reported to the Investor Defense (IAEA) - SEC so that these malicious procedures do not happen again from my perspective and I will present my complaint to the media. I hope they present some worthy solution for the shareholders that were not written for in exchange, in any case we will proceed with the aforementioned measures"
"These two companies from Ardagh Group (ARD) or Ardagh Metal Packaging (AMBP). They have been denounced because they have scammed and discriminated against shareholders and investors, the shares of (ARD) have left the NYSE market to enter the market with the ticket (AMBP), they have sent an exchange offer expiring 10-05-2021 , they should have made the exchange for everyone without discrimination, not all shareholders reached or were informed of these practices; A good percentage of shareholders have left them in the air without being able to sell shares of this company (ARD) because the NYSE market came out, only a malicious name change with AMBP, the complaints have already been made to the SEC, I hope that my report sent to the media can go on the air."
