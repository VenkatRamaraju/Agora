"Disgust in Alabama:""Fed-up doctor tells anti-vaxxers they're on their ownAn Alabama doctor is tired of helping people who refuse to protect themselves and others — so he’s no longer taking appointments with anti-vaxxers. Mobile, Ala., physician Dr. Jason Valentine posted a photo on Facebook in which he’s seen standing in front of a sign that reads “Effective Oct. 1, 2021, Dr. Valentine will no longer see patients that are not vaccinated against COVID-19.”Alabama is one of several southern states that has struggled to contain the pandemic, due in part to vaccine skepticism. Valentine doesn’t appear to be picking on the ignorant so much as he doesn’t want to watch them hack, gasp and cough themselves to death after finally coming to appreciate the wonders of modern medicine once it’s too late.“If they asked why, I told them covid is a miserable way to die and I can’t watch them die like that,” he wrote. “We do not yet have any great treatments for severe disease, but we do have great prevention with vaccines. Unfortunately, many have declined to take the vaccine, and some end up severely ill or dead,” that letter reportedly says. “I cannot and will not force anyone to take the vaccine, but I also cannot continue to watch my patients suffer and die from an eminently preventable disease.”Valentine plans to send a letter to his patients telling them that if they object to his position,he will happily forward their medical records to a practitioner of their choosing."""
"The GOP is an historical fear monger . ""In the 1960s and 70s, conservatives were waging a war against what they considered an existential threat infiltrating America’s public schools. Pamphlets were circulated by the John Birch Society, a right-wing extremist group, declaring it a “filthy Communist plot.” And then-Governor Ronald Reagan of California decried it as a “moral crisis” that needed to be eradicated. What was poisoning the minds of America’s youth? Sex education. These days, sex ed is more widely accepted, especially following the HIV/AIDS epidemic (though conservatives have still managed to beat back more progressive school curricula when it comes to sexual health), but the Republican Party’s habit of identifying a bogeyman in America’s education system hasn’t wavered. ""Today, critical race theory has replaced sex Ed. as the horror coming for your kids."

"""Nathaniel Polnaszek: Associate Professor at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine I’m upset, saddened and frustrated. As a physician I devote my life to taking care of people. I feel helpless right now as I watch another wave of COVID 19 hospitalizations taking over our healthcare system. Most hospitals in the region have put a halt on scheduling elective surgeries for the foreseeable future. This includes any surgeries that would not lead to death or permanent impairment if delayed beyond 72h. This means that thousands of patients with heart disease, severe joint pain, kidneys stones, cancer, etc. will need to delay their care for weeks on end. Right now, my colleagues and I are canceling almost all of our surgeries so that we have enough beds and staff to handle the influx of hospitalized COVID 19 patients. It pains me greatly to tell my cancer patients that I need to push their surgery back without any assurances about when their surgery can be rescheduled or if this will impact the outcome of treatment.That leads me to my point… The only way we can get out of this mess is to get as many human beings vaccinated as possible. Vaccines are NOT a personal choice. Your vaccination status affects everyone around you. While there is not any guarantee that you will not contract the virus if you are vaccinated, there is a strong likelihood that you will stay out of the hospital and not need a ventilator. Those beds will allow us to treat your friend, neighbor, or family member that needs life saving surgery."""

"""In western South Dakota’s Meade County, more than one in three COVID-19 tests are currently returning positive, and over the last three weeks, seven-day average case counts have increased by 3,400 percent. This exponential growth in cases is likely attributable to the 81st Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which drew an estimated half a million visitors to Meade County and its environs from Aug. 6 through 15, potentially acting as a superspreader event.The pandemic is surging nationally, not just proximal to biker chaos in South Dakota. Defined in large part by the emergence of the highly transmissible Delta variant, the United States is experiencing its fourth surge of COVID-19 right now, and our nationwide case counts have increased by 64.4 percent over the last 21 days. (For more on our methodology, see our note at the bottom of this column.)But while Southern states have been the main drivers of this surge thus far, the recent spike in cases in South Dakota warrants special concern.The state more broadly has witnessed a 686.8 percent increase in daily case counts over the past three weeks, currently more than 10 times the nationwide rate. Meade County’s post-Sturgis uptick is certainly a contributor to this state-level increase, but neighboring counties have experienced a sharp incline in cases, too—ranging from a 1,900 percent increase in the past three weeks in Butte to a 1,050 percent increase in Lawrence."""

Sober analysts at the time made clear that remaking Iraq and the “graveyard of empires” into Western-friendly, capitalist, liberal democracies was a fool’s errand.As we evaluate the failures of those efforts today, we must recognize the problem was not in the execution of the wars, or the withdrawals, but in the very idea of committing American lives and wealth to forcibly “rebuilding” nations across the globe to fit neoconservatives' vision of society.

"""Ken Starr, the lawyer who hounded Bill Clinton over his affair with Monica Lewinsky, waged a “scorched-earth” legal campaign to persuade federal prosecutors to drop a sex-trafficking case against the billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein relating to the abuse of multiple underaged girls, according to a new book.In Perversion of Justice the Miami Herald reporter Julie K Brown writes about Starr’s role in securing the secret 2008 sweetheart deal that granted Epstein effective immunity from federal prosecution. The author, who is credited with blowing open the cover-up, calls Starr a “fixer” who “used his political connections in the White House to get the Justice Department to review Epstein’s case”.The book says that emails and letters sent by Starr and Epstein’s then criminal defense lawyer Jay Lefkowitz show that the duo were “campaigning to pressure the Justice Department to drop the case”. Starr had been brought into “center stage” of Epstein’s legal team because of his connections in Washington to the Bush administration.Perversion of Justice will be published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy.When Epstein’s lawyers appeared to be failing in their pressure campaign, with senior DoJ officials concluding that Epstein was ripe for federal prosecution, Starr pulled out the stops. Brown discloses that he wrote an eight-page letter to Mark Filip, who had just been confirmed as deputy US attorney general, the second most powerful prosecutor in the country."""

"""Over the last eight months, Fox News has led a relentless effort to ridicule and dismiss the danger of new COVID-19 variants, with some network figures suggesting that the threat is being hyped to promote vaccination campaigns and enable government overreach.Now, amid stalling vaccination rates and an uptick in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and hospitalizations in the United States, a new strain of the coronavirus known as the delta variant threatens to reverse the progress the country has made in eradicating COVID-19, especially in areas with low vaccination rates. Scientists have been concerned about previous variants -- the Brazilian, South African, and U.K. variants -- because they often alter the virus’s transmissibility and lethality. Recent research suggests that the delta variant causes more severe illness and is as contagious as chickenpox, and scientists are consequently concerned that unmitigated spread of the delta variant may lead to future variations that evade the highly effective COVID-19 vaccines.Despite public health concerns, Fox News and its hosts, anchors, correspondents, and guests have complemented the network’s campaign against vaccinations with a concerted effort to downplay and undermine the threat of coronavirus variants."""

"GOP's inability to govern appears to be a genetic trait.""Texas veterans homes overseen by George P. Bush were often the deadliest places to be during COVID-19 pandemicby Shannon Najmabadi, Texas TribuneJay Root, Houston ChronicleCarla Astudillo, Texas TribuneMary Kay Dieterich was encouraged last year when Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush promised to shake up the management of the El Paso nursing home where her father died of COVID-19.She knew it wouldn’t bring Eugene Forti, a World War II veteran, back to life. But as the top elected official in charge of all nine of the state’s nursing homes catering to veterans in Texas, Bush certainly had the power to hold the private management company accountable for what Dieterich saw as a botched response to the pandemic.Yet, despite telling the for-profit operator of the Ambrosio Guillen Texas State Veterans Home that he was “deeply concerned” about the care it was providing in El Paso, Bush’s promised shakeup, delivered to the local news outlet El Paso Matters, never came — even as COVID deaths soared at the facility.More than a quarter of its infected residents died, nearly double the average 13% death rate across El Paso County’s 21 nursing homes.And it’s not the only one.""Read more: https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/23/texas-coronavirus-veterans-homes-george-p-bush/"

"It's ""different"" in Texas:""On Wednesday, barring some kind of miracle, Texas will have their abortion ban, enforced by citizens ratting on one another. The state is so desperate to force people to give birth that they created an unconstitutional law that can be enforced not by government but by civil lawsuits filed by their neighbors or by anti-choice organizations alerted to their abortions by their neighbors. The new law will allow anyone to sue anyone who ""aids and abets"" an abortion that occurs after fetal pole cardiac activity is detectable, including anyone who performs an abortion on a Texas resident or gives a Texas resident money to get an abortion, for at least $10,000. This applies to anyone, in any state who:(1) performs or induces an abortion in violation of this chapter;(2) knowingly engages in conduct that aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion, including paying for or reimbursing the costs of an abortion through insurance or otherwise, if the abortion is performed or induced in violation of this chapter, regardless of whether the person knew or should have known that the abortion would be performed or induced in violation of this chapter.There are no exceptions for rape and incest, either.So, hypothetically — if you, a non-Texas resident, could give your cousin in Texas a few hundred bucks to get an abortion, Gladys Kravitz can sue you and you have to give her $10,000. Oh! And even if you are found innocent, even if it turns out she didn't even have an abortion, Gladys doesn't have to pay your lawyers fees. So you have to spend all that money defending yourself whether you ""aided and abetted"" an abortion or not."""

Our client has served 13 years in law enforcement and on January 6, 2021, fought against an insurrectionist violent crowd — no doubt many of them Carlson’s supporters — to protect the lives of our elected officials, including Vice President Pence.”They went on, “Officer Dunn, who would lay down his life to protect a Member of Congress, regardless of being a Republican or Democrat, will testify next Tuesday before the House Select Committee investigating the events of the insurrection.
