"De Joy and GOP beginning voter suppression efforts:""Virginia Democrats sue USPS over delayed delivery of election-related materialSource: CNNThe Virginia Democratic Party filed a lawsuit against the US Postal Service on Friday, alleging local branches failed to deliver and process election-related material ahead of its high stakes gubernatorial race, thereby ""threatening to disenfranchise thousands of Virginia voters.""The organization says delays in election-related mail across Albemarle County, which includes the city of Charlottesville, James City County, which is adjacent to Williamsburg, and the area of Portsmouth near Norfolk, are ""particularly egregious,"" according to the lawsuit.Friday's lawsuit was filed less than two weeks before the closely watched governor's race between Terry McAuliffe and Glenn Youngkin. Democrats are hoping to hold onto the governor's mansion and maintain control of the state legislature, while Youngkin seeks to be Virginia's first Republican to win a statewide election since 2009.""Thousands of ballots delivered to postal facilities by the general registrars weeks ago are still outstanding and, weeks later, have not yet even been scanned into USPS's system. Even if these voters do eventually receive their ballots before Election Day, the slowdowns promise that they will not have sufficient time to send them back with assurance that they will arrive in time to be counted,"" the lawsuit filed in US District Court says."""

"""Joe Arpaio has cost taxpayers $100MPHOENIX (AP) — Nearly five years after Joe Arpaio was voted out as sheriff of Arizona's most populous county, taxpayers are covering one of the last major bills from the thousands of lawsuits the lawman's headline-grabbing tactics inspired — and the overall legal tab has hit $100 million.Officials in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, agreed last week to pay $3.1 million to cover the county’s portion of a settlement with a restaurant owner who alleged Arpaio defamed him and violated his rights when raiding his businesses.The payout boosted the cost stemming from Arpaio's six terms to $100 million for attorney fees, settlements and other costs the county has paid from lawsuits over things such as jail deaths, failed investigations of the sheriff's political enemies and immigration raids of businesses.That doesn't include the separate $178 million and counting taxpayers have shelled out in a 2007 racial profiling case stemming from Arpaio’s signature traffic patrols targeting immigrants, though about 75% of that spending has occurred during his successor’s watch as he works to comply with court-ordered overhauls of the sheriff’s office."""
"GOP racism is costing us taxpayers money:""Families of Charleston church massacre victims reach an $88M settlement with the Justice Department(CNN)The families of nine people fatally shot in 2015 at a historically Black church in Charleston, South Carolina, have reached an $88 million settlement with the Justice Department in their lawsuit over the shooter's weapon purchase, according to agency officials and a news release Thursday.snipPinckney's daughter Eliana said the settlement has profound meaning.""For the first time, I think, in so long ... as a young African American woman to see the government acknowledge the fact that racism still exists and how prevalent it is in our community and then actively try to combat it in every way that they can and to acknowledge that gun violence is an issue and to do everything they can to correct a mistake ... is so important,"" she said.snipBakari Sellers, one of the attorneys for the victims, said the settlement is a ""big 'F you' to White supremacists of this country.""He said the settlement of $88 million -- $25 million split among survivors and $63 million split among the families for those killed -- is symbolic because the number 88 is a symbol of hate and was written on Roof's shoes while he carried out the shooting."""
"WRONG on so many levels:""Florida's top doctor refuses mask, is told to leave meetingFlorida's top health official was asked to leave a meeting after refusing to wear a mask at the office of the state senator who told him she had a serious medical condition, officials have confirmed. Florida Senate leader Wilton Simpson, a Republican, sent a memo to senators Saturday, Oct. 23, 2021 regarding the incident at the office of Democratic state Sen. Tina Polsky, asking visitors at the building to be respectful with social interactions....“It was so shocking to me that he treated me in this manner,” Polsky said. “If he is a surgeon general for the next several years, I am really concerned about a future public health emergency and not being able to rely on him for necessary guidance and proper scientific leadership....In the memo sent by Simpson to senators and their staff members, he said that while there's no mask mandate in the Senate, senators can request social distancing and masking within their offices.“It shouldn't take a cancer diagnosis for people to respect each other's level of comfort with social interactions during a pandemic,” he said. ""What occurred in Senator Polsky's office was unprofessional and will not be tolerated in the Senate."""

"""This week, there has been a lot of discussion about whether politicians might have helped to plan the January 6 rally that led to a violent insurrection at the Capitol, following the publication of an explosive article by Rolling Stone. The article claimed that people who organized the protest had participated in “dozens” of planning meetings “with members of Congress and White House staff”. And the way in which lawmakers have responded to such allegations is particularly telling.Alabama Representative Mo Brooks denied involvement, but then went on to say, “I don’t know if my staff did [help plan the rally].. but if they did I’d be proud of them for helping to put together a rally lawful under the First Amendment at the Ellipse to protest voter fraud and election theft.”Brooks, in his statement, reiterated the debunked and completely baseless claims of election theft which justified and inspired the violent attack on the Capitol. He denies the accusation that he tried to undermine democracy — then he turns around and publicly, boldly, tries to undermine democracy."""

"GOP fascisti doing their thing:""Three University of Florida professors said in a federal court filing on Friday that they had been barred from assisting plaintiffs in a lawsuit to overturn the state’s new law restricting voting rights, an extraordinary limit on speech that raises questions of academic freedom and First Amendment rights.University officials told the three that because the school was a state institution, participating in a lawsuit against the state “is adverse to U.F.’s interests” and could not be permitted. In their filing, the professors sought to question Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, on whether he was involved in the decision.Mr. DeSantis has resisted questioning, arguing that all of his communications about the law are protected from disclosure because discussions about legislation are privileged. In their filing on Friday, lawyers for the plaintiffs said the federal questions in the case — including whether the law discriminates against minority groups — override any state protections.Spokespeople for Mr. DeSantis and the university could not be immediately reached for comment.The university’s refusal to allow the professors to testify was a marked turnabout for the University of Florida. Like schools nationwide, the university has routinely allowed academic experts to offer expert testimony in lawsuits, even when they oppose the interests of the political party in power."""

"""PLANO, TX—In a purported effort to stop the rise of woke, leftist Critical Race Theory in the classroom, a local school district issued a decision Thursday censoring all of The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain except for its copious use of the n-word. “This move will allow educators to focus on the key elements of an American classic without fear of trafficking in the novel’s harmful themes of compassion and racial equality,” said superintendent James Appelbaum, telling reporters that the school board had voted unanimously to excise the book’s “dangerous lies” about the cruelties of slavery and that a journey of self-discovery on the margins of society could lay bare the immorality and hypocrisy of white institutions. “We’ve heard stories about caucasian students that are ashamed of their own whiteness, or think of themselves as inherently inferior to students of color, and we’re hopeful that reading a racial slur dozens and dozens of times over again will help fix this pernicious misconception.” Appelbaum added that the school board would next be considering a proposal to remove all of To Kill A Mockingbird except the section where the wrongfully-convicted Black man Tom Robinson is shot to death trying to escape prison.""The Onion"

"""Long the king of Washington political scandals, the Watergate office, residential, and hotel complex stands to be eclipsed by “Willardgate.” Watergate lent its name to countless other political “gate” scandals due to its being the location where the Democratic National Committee headquarters was burglarized by Richard Nixon re-election henchmen, an act that ultimately brought down the administration of Richard Nixon. Willardgate, however, may replace Watergate as the granddaddy of all DC scandals because, as with Guy Fawkes Day in England, Willardgate has become synonymous with “Treason and Plot.”"

To understand the high costs of inaction, look no further than Texas.One month after passing one of the country’s worst voter suppression laws, Texas Republicans enacted new redistricting maps that lock in power for white Republicans by denying fair representation to communities of color.“The partisan effects of the map are achieved by discriminating against communities of color.”Ninety-five percent of the state’s population growth in the last decade came from communities of color, but, in an astonishingly brazen effort to forestall these demographic changes, the new redistricting maps for the state legislature and US House increase the number of districts with white majorities—overwhelmingly held by Republicans—and decrease the number of districts with Hispanic and Black majorities."""
