"Zacks ! PhhhhhtHears what these clowns said two days ago.""Weak Trading Performance to Mar Morgan Stanley (MS) Q3 Earnings""But the facts prove otherwise ...BOOM !""Revenue and net income jumped more than 25% from a year ago, aided by CEO James Gorman’s acquisitions of E-Trade and Eaton Vance, which bulked up the firms’ wealth and asset management divisions. Shares of the bank rose 1.5%.“The Firm delivered another very strong quarter, with robust revenues and improved efficiency,” Gorman said in the release. “We had standout performance of our integrated investment bank and record net new assets of $135 billion in wealth management.”While rival banks have reported a slowdown in third-quarter fixed income trading revenue, Morgan Stanley’s strength has traditionally been in its equities franchise, the biggest in the world.Equities trading revenue jumped 24% from a year earlier to $2.88 billion, topping the StreetAccount estimate by more than $500 million. Fixed income revenue dropped 16% to $1.64 billion, edging out the $1.53 billion estimate."""

The training came four days after the Carroll school board, responding to a parent’s complaint, voted to reprimand a fourth grade teacher who had kept an anti-racism book in her classroom.A Carroll staff member secretly recorded the Friday training and shared the audio with NBC News.“Just try to remember the concepts of [House Bill] 3979,” Peddy said in the recording, referring to a new Texas law that requires teachers to present multiple perspectives when discussing “widely debated and currently controversial” issues. “And make sure that if you have a book on the Holocaust,” Peddy continued, “that you have one that has an opposing, that has other perspectives.”“How do you oppose the Holocaust?” one teacher said in response.“Believe me,” Peddy said. “That’s come up."""
Make up your mind Morgan Stanley. First you say a 10% crash then you say a 20% crash.News Flash even if it dropped 20% percent it's only a crash if people believe the media . A true crash is actually 22% . Anything less is just media bull.

"Oppenheimer: Silently Overperforming And Eternally UnderfollowedOct. 01, 2021 3:48 PM ETOppenheimer Holdings Inc. (OPY)9 Comments4 LikesSummaryThis company has delivered superior returns and continued to show promising results at almost every quarter.The stock is widely underfollowed and they are not covered by Wall Street, this led to chronic cheapness and historically low multiples.Wealth management and consulting firms like Oppenheimer are here to stay and they demonstrated good cost-management skills over the years.The stock is set to continue delivering good returns that will please investors over the long term.audit aziendali utilizzando un fondo di investimento di dati finanziari calcolatrice in un luogo di lavoro, concetto di ricchezzaChalirmpoj Pimpisarn/iStock via Getty ImagesWhat is Oppenheimer and why it's so cheapOppenheimer (OPY) is ""a leading middle-market investment bank and full-service broker-dealer"". They offer different services, from Wealth management to investment banking. Their business model is really straightforward and they derive the majority of revenues from Advisory fees and commissions, while still doing quite good on investment banking too. While asset management followed the industry's trends and lowered fees, they are still managing to keep margins high on about all segments. This demonstrated that they're good at keeping compensation-to-revenues low while growing (cost-management skills). The big fact here is that because they are not covered by Wall Street's analysts, they don't do conference calls, and are a relatively boring business they are well under the radar. Multiples on this name have been incredibly low while management continued to deliver very positive results on all segments. So the thesis here is simple, they are a good company with a very strong track record of positive results, established industry know-how, selling for a really cheap price.Successfully managing costs and aligning with shareholders' interestsWhile no one was discussing this name, they continued to deliver strong results to the market. While many argue that management is not shareholders-friendly, the number of outstanding shares passed from 13 million in 2018 to 12.5 million now. Dividends passed from $0.4 to $0.6. The stock returned 27% CAGR in the last 5 years, against the 16% of the S&P500. These are results of a great business that did very well for all stakeholders, and they show that management's interests are perfectly aligned with shareholders' ones. Another big fact in support of this thesis is the CEO's ownership of the stock. As of June 30, 2021, he owns about 26% of the company and did not make significant sales in the last 12 months. Discussing the past results, Oppenheimer has been able to steadily grow advisory fees and commissions, which make about 70% of total revenues. The expansion in advisory fees was due to the strong equity markets in the last years, that fueled their performance-based fees on the Asset Management division. At the same time, the positive M&A contributed to higher both commissions and Investment Banking revenues.OPY revenue by segment(Source: Own made chart with data from 10K)This chart shows the composition of revenue by segment. The business model is diversified although OPY earns a significant share of their revenues from their AUM, in the form of performance-related and fixed fees. While these divisions were showing strong results, the company kept compensation as a percentage of revenues on the historical average.OPY 2020 10-K report(Source: Taken from 2020 10K)While the Private Client segment experienced a rise in this ratio, the overall firm's average showed a very modest increase, of less than 1%. Since compensation makes about 80% of operational expenses this is a clear example of how good management is on growing margins and managing costs. The other big point is about alternative investments. Like other players, such as AllianceBernstein (AB), Oppenheimer is betting on more exotic and non-conventional products to increase margins. Since fees are declining in the Asset Management industry, products like PE funds, Hedge funds, and customized programs for clients, help keep revenues high and improve margins. The alternatives now represent more than 10% of total AUM, in case they will continue growing OPY will deliver better-than-expected earnings and margins in the future.This name chronically underfollowed and thus cheapOppenheimer does not hold conference calls and they are barely followed by Wall Street analysts. On their website there is no section for ""coverage"" and also here on SA, there is no mention of analysts' rating. Looking at the multiples, the results are quite astonishing and show a chronically underfollowed name that trades at an incredibly cheap valuation. This happens despite the absence of major regulatory headwinds or reputational issues. It's simply the market not caring much about their results."
"From Q2 earnings call1) ""I think we should pay out effectively what we make in Wealth Management as dividend and think of that as yield stock and think of the institutional business as a growth stock, so that’s coming""2) ""Now turning to Wealth Management. Second quarter revenues were $4.7 billion...Pre-tax profit was $1.1 billion."" 3) ""Our tax rate was 22.6%""4) Shares Outstanding 1.75B (from yahoo)So, 1.1B after tax = 851M.851M shared between 1.75B shares = ~.50 per share = PER QUARTERSo I can see us going from 1.40 to $2 per share.Best guess, they raise it .10 per quarter in 2021 or 1.80 per share.This is my best guess, we certainly could see a surprise."

What’s being taught instead — and squelched — is American history, which happens to include slavery, Jim Crow repression and structural racism.I get it. The GOP has become the party of White racial grievance, and this battle against an imaginary enemy stirs the base. But the whole charade involves Republican officials — many of them educated at the nation’s top schools — betting that their constituents are too dumb to know they’re being lied to. So far, the bet is paying off.And then, of course, there’s the whole “stolen election” farce, which led to the tragedy of Jan. 6.

"The concept of CHOICE: ""Reasonable people can disagree about when a zygote becomes a ""human life"" -- that's a philosophical question. However, regardless of whether or not one believes a fetus is ethically equivalent to an adult, it doesn't obligate a mother to sacrifice her body autonomy for another, innocent or not.""Body autonomy is a critical component of the right to privacy protected by the Constitution, as decided in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), McFall v. Shimp (1978), and of course Roe v. Wade (1973). Consider a scenario where you are a perfect bone marrow match for a child with severe aplastic anemia; no other person on earth is a close enough match to save the child's life, and the child will certainly die without a bone marrow transplant from you. If you decided that you did not want to donate your marrow to save the child, for whatever reason, the state cannot demand the use of any part of your body for something to which you do not consent. It doesn't matter if the procedure required to complete the donation is trivial, or if the rationale for refusing is flimsy and arbitrary, or if the procedure is the only hope the child has to survive, or if the child is a genius or a saint or anything else -- the decision to donate must be voluntary to be constitutional. This right is even extended to a person's body after they die; if they did not voluntarily commit to donate their organs while alive, their organs cannot be harvested after death, regardless of how useless those organs are to the deceased or how many lives they would save.""That's the law.""Use of a woman's uterus to save a life is no different from use of her bone marrow to save a life -- it must be offered voluntarily. By all means, profess your belief that providing one's uterus to save the child is morally just, and refusing is morally wrong. That is a defensible philosophical position, regardless of who agrees and who disagrees. But legally, it must be the woman's choice to carry out the pregnancy. She may choose to carry the baby to term. She may choose not to. Either decision could be made for all the right reasons, all the wrong reasons, or anything in between. But it must be her choice, and protecting the right of body autonomy means the law is on her side.""Supporting that precedent is what being pro-choice means."""

"""Using the Cline Center’s Coup D’état Project definitions, the storming of the US Capitol Building on January 6, 2021 was an attempted coup d’état: an organized, illegal attempt to intervene in the presidential transition by displacing the power of the Congress to certify the election.

"""A series of polls shows the public's faith in the Supreme Court dropping and an understanding of the court’s partisanship rising. The furthest-right, most partisan justices are hearing that criticism, but their response has been a series of gaslighting speeches.Barrett claimed to be ""concerned"" about the public’s view of the court as partisan. She said this in a speech at the University of Louisville's McConnell Center, founded by McConnell, after being introduced by … McConnell. You know, the guy who held one Supreme Court seat open for nearly a year because there was an election coming and it would be wrong to let a president fill a Supreme Court seat in the last year of his term, then turned around and got Barrett onto the court in the matter of weeks between Ginsburg’s death and the election.Samuel Alito, basically a Republican operative in the guise of a justice, recently whined about “unprecedented efforts to intimidate the court or damage it as an independent institution,” aka observations that the court has been packed with far-right justices by Republicans who lost the popular vote for the presidency, and has consistently acted to bolster Republican electoral chances to solidify that control. How dare Democrats notice that Republicans have waged a decades-long campaign to take over the courts, just as Republicans succeeded at taking over the courts!Clarence Thomas also chimed in, talking about people “destroying our institutions because they don't give us what we want, when we want it.” Again, after decades of Republicans undermining the reputation of the court for partisan purposes—Bush v.

"MICHAEL HILTZIK AUG. 20, 2021“People who don’t vaccinate are imposing costs on the community that they’re not paying for,” says Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, an expert in vaccine policy at UC Hastings College of the Law. She equates them with environmental polluters, who are often charged for cleaning up the messes they’ve created…It’s hardly in doubt that vaccine refusal imposes costs on individuals and society. The unvaccinated account for the preponderance of COVID-19 patients landing in the hospital during the most recent pandemic surge in the U.S., placing a disproportionate burden on medical providers and the healthcare system, sometimes shouldering other patients out of the way…Economist Jonathan Meer of Texas A&M University argued in MarketWatch that “insurers, led by government programs, should declare that medically able, eligible people who choose not to be vaccinated are responsible for the full financial cost of COVID-related hospitalizations.”Meer was seconded by economist Justin Wolfers of the University of Michigan, who observed on Twitter that anti-vaxxers’ “political positions are effectively being subsidized by members of insurance pools, taxpayers, and the vaccinated.”"

The second is the task of getting people to accept that truth – knowing that many will not....Though Mr Trump initiated these beliefs, other politicians continue to cynically stoke them: “Nobody actually believes the election was stolen from Donald Trump. But a lot of them are happy to go out and say it was,” Mr Kinzinger observed of his colleagues.Their behaviour is extraordinary as well as reprehensible: for the sake of their political careers, they seem as reckless about their own safety as they are about democracy’s. They presumably count on staying on the right side of any future mob. Far from deterring the committee from pursuing this investigation fully, their actions and rhetoric should provide a spur.

"If you wondering why Shopify dropped yesterday; look at insider selling. John Phillips sold $17 Million. The share price was up $20 in the morning but ending up -$40.Tuesday morning the share price was up over $30 and ended up down $20 as Tobi the CEO sold over $10 Million. He does this every week. I know it is part of the incentive plan but they are not forced to exercise their options, they do it because they believe the share price is grossly overvalued. If it was undervalued they wouldn't be selling. I know some of you don't care but if $MS gets fed up with the insider selling and they sell off their $6 Billion market share it will be a big problem for Shopify share holders."

"There may be indications that the Archegos collapse was a pump 'n' dump. Over a 5 year timeline the most popular stocks in the basket seemed to be trading accordingly with market conditions. Tencent, Baidu, Discovery, Viacom CBS. GSX, etc. Then in January through March 2021 these stocks spiked heavily up until the day of the collapse. It seems wall street enacted their own version of wallstreetbets on Archegos, but in this case their intent was to let it wither on the vine. Hopefully all the carnage caused by this type of outfit called family offices are secluded to those who can afford to lose $100M. Here's the calamity, the lack of regulatory oversight allowed a man who was convicted of insider trading in 2012, to again begin a practice specializing in stock trading."
James Gorman Rocks
"MS Interview of Gorman (after earnings):CRAMER: Well that’s what we’re going to talk about. At one point, Morgan Stanley before you came in, had what I regarded as episodic earnings. They’d be good, and then bad and good and bad and therefore it’s very hard to give a price earnings multiple. The business that you’re bringing in, including by the way E*TRADE, is really sticky and steadily growth, growth, secular growth. And I’m wondering what you when you sit around your board meetings, doesn’t someone say, you know what, how come we’re still at 12 times earnings because this is a secular growth story, it’s not cyclical, I’m trying to understand why you’re not given a greater price.GORMAN: Yeah, well it’s getting there. I mean to be fair we were, you know, we were sub 10 and I thought that was just nuts. We’re now managing if you put wealth and asset management together, which gives us the balance, that’s about six and a half trillion on that we’re generating revenues of over 30 billion. Just that, and that’s very sticky but on the other hand the investment bank and what it’s done the resurgence of fixed income after it was restructured dramatically in 2015. You know, equities is number one, the investment bank itself and M&A is on fire, the equity underwriting. So, Jim, it’s this balance and speed concept that I’ve talked about, and, you know, we’re starting to get the multiple. I mean we’re getting the recognition, you look at some of the other pure wealth players in the marketplace, they’re trading at, you know, 20, 30 times earnings, you know, we’d love a piece of that and I think our investors are starting to understand that so it’s getting there."

"""According to statistics provided by the Texas Attorney General’s Office, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the state dating back to 2004. In total, between 2004 and March 2021, the state charged 154 people with 534 counts related to possible voter fraud.A report from local ABC-affiliated news station KVUE-TV compared the fraud-related charges brought in the state to the total number of votes cast over that period and concluded that “approximately 0.0006% of the votes cast in that time frame resulted in a prosecution case being resolved.”Further evincing the dearth of evidence indicating widespread voter fraud, Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick (R) in November offered a reward of up to $1 million from his campaign account for “whistleblowers and tipsters” from anywhere in the nation that were able to come forward with evidence of voter fraud. There is no evidence that Patrick has paid out any reward money.

I expect a bit of a price pull back as September historically the worst month for stocks. If someone knew this they wouldn’t be buying Aug 31 but they might buy in the last week of September.

"The MAJOR GOP FAIL:""We relied on common sense eventually kicking-in when anti-vaxxers noticed that it was the unvaccinated that were flooding our hospitals. We relied on common sense taking hold when anti-maskers insisted that their unmasked children be sent back to school - and their schools had to shut down as the virus spread as a result."""
"""Fascisti will suddenly be here, and there will be nothing we can do. It is being slowly normalized. I mean, an insurrection takes place, with evidence of pre-planning from the former President and his aids, and one of the major parties not only does not participate in an inquiry, but actively tries to sabotage it and demean it, and even more, deify the rioters as ""patriots"". And this is now normal. Most Republican voters think the election was stolen. This is now normal."""
"""September 10, 2021(CNN) Federal prosecutors cited seditious conspiracy as a crime under investigation in a recent search that appears to be related to the US Capitol riot probe, according to a court document supporting the search.The move, made known through the iPhone search of the Oath Keepers-linked Texas lawyer Kellye SoRelle, again raises the possibility that the Justice Department could be considering use of the provocative charge.Sedition has not been used against any of the more than 600 Capitol riot federal criminal defendants, and is rarely charged. But the possibility of federal authorities attempting to use it as a legal hammer in response to the insurrection has hung over the investigation since the former acting DC US attorney first announced it was under consideration."""
"""While Mr. Meadows and Mr. Patel are, so far, engaging with the Select Committee, Mr. Bannon has indicated that he will try to hide behind vague references to privileges of the former President. The Select Committee fully expects all of these witnesses to comply with our demands for both documents and deposition testimony.Though the Select Committee welcomes good-faith engagement with witnesses seeking to cooperate with our investigation, we will not allow any witness to defy a lawful subpoena or attempt to run out the clock, and we will swiftly consider advancing a criminal contempt of Congress referral.We thank those many patriotic Americans who are coming forward voluntarily to participate in our inquiry. The Committee is making rapid progress and will not be deterred by those who seek to obstruct our efforts."""
"On December 18, 2020, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) notified Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) that it would be permitted to resume repurchases of common stock in the first quarter of 2021, consistent with the FRB’s recently announced distribution limitations.

"Want lower taxes?""Consider H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, and what it can mean for US taxpayers.H.R.3 is designed fix the enormous problem of many Americans being unable to afford their prescription drugs.

"I cant put my finger on it so can someone explain in their best beliefs or understanding on why the brokerages have such a wide daily trading range particularly with a low daily volume, teeny short interest, and large float, and even larger outstanding count such as with MS. The large continuous daily swings just dont correspond to most blue chips except when we see index breakdown. I've seen no news which would precede these slides of MS stock. I know it usually bounces back so I'm not really concerned, I'm just trying to understand the logistics of the moves.It's just a question. Thanks in advance."
Whats the good range to get in?
