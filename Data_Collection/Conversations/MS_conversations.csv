"""The State Department’s Afghanistan Chargé d’Affaires Ross Wilson on Wednesday revealed that Americans who were trapped in Afghanistan failed to heed his department’s warnings about the country deteriorating.“You warned about this in a cable,” CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell asked Wilson in an evening interview.“Were you ignored?”“We put out repeated warnings every three weeks to Americans going back to, I think, March or April, each one in stronger terms,” Ross said. “‘Leave now.’ ‘Leave immediately.’ Never in my 40 years of working … at the State Department have I seen such strong language used.Ross said ""People chose not to leave. That’s their business, there’s their right. We regret now that many may find themselves in a position that they would rather not be in, and we are determined to try to help them.”"

"It's ""different"" in Texas:""On Wednesday, barring some kind of miracle, Texas will have their abortion ban, enforced by citizens ratting on one another. The state is so desperate to force people to give birth that they created an unconstitutional law that can be enforced not by government but by civil lawsuits filed by their neighbors or by anti-choice organizations alerted to their abortions by their neighbors. The new law will allow anyone to sue anyone who ""aids and abets"" an abortion that occurs after fetal pole cardiac activity is detectable, including anyone who performs an abortion on a Texas resident or gives a Texas resident money to get an abortion, for at least $10,000. This applies to anyone, in any state who:(1) performs or induces an abortion in violation of this chapter;(2) knowingly engages in conduct that aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion, including paying for or reimbursing the costs of an abortion through insurance or otherwise, if the abortion is performed or induced in violation of this chapter, regardless of whether the person knew or should have known that the abortion would be performed or induced in violation of this chapter.There are no exceptions for rape and incest, either.So, hypothetically — if you, a non-Texas resident, could give your cousin in Texas a few hundred bucks to get an abortion, Gladys Kravitz can sue you and you have to give her $10,000. Oh! And even if you are found innocent, even if it turns out she didn't even have an abortion, Gladys doesn't have to pay your lawyers fees. So you have to spend all that money defending yourself whether you ""aided and abetted"" an abortion or not."""
"No bias there, eh?""Texas Attorney General Clears Self of Bribery Accusations in Unsigned Report‘AG Paxton Committed No Crime’: Texas Attorney General Clears Self of Bribery Accusations in Unsigned Reporthttps://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/ag-paxton-committed-no-crime-texas-attorney-general-clears-self-of-bribery-accusations-in-unsigned-report/Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), who has spent the better part of six-year tenure under indictment for securities fraud, committed no crime. That’s the finding of a new report by Paxton’s office clearing the attorney general of unrelated bribery accusations leveled against him by his former employees.“AG Paxton’s actions were lawful, and consistent with his legal duties and prior actions taken by Attorneys General of Texas,” the first bullet point of his executive summary states. “AG Paxton committed no crime.”In a report totaling 374 pages with exhibits, Paxton’s office found that the former employees alleging otherwise have “no evidence” of a “quid pro quo”—that Latin phrase meaning “this for that,” the type of transactions forbidden by public office holders under anti-corruption law.Several of Paxton’s ex-top aides—described in the report as the “Complainants”—accused him of improper influence in the case of Austin real estate investor Nate Paul, who donated to the attorney general’s 2018 re-election campaign. They claimed the attorney general performed a series of favors for Paul, allegedly in return for a job for Paxton’s mistress, according to the Houston Chronicle. Paul has been under a lengthy FBI investigation, and the investor’s properties in the Lone Star State’s capital were raided on Aug. 19, 2020."""

"""In western South Dakota’s Meade County, more than one in three COVID-19 tests are currently returning positive, and over the last three weeks, seven-day average case counts have increased by 3,400 percent. This exponential growth in cases is likely attributable to the 81st Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which drew an estimated half a million visitors to Meade County and its environs from Aug. 6 through 15, potentially acting as a superspreader event.The pandemic is surging nationally, not just proximal to biker chaos in South Dakota. Defined in large part by the emergence of the highly transmissible Delta variant, the United States is experiencing its fourth surge of COVID-19 right now, and our nationwide case counts have increased by 64.4 percent over the last 21 days. (For more on our methodology, see our note at the bottom of this column.)But while Southern states have been the main drivers of this surge thus far, the recent spike in cases in South Dakota warrants special concern.The state more broadly has witnessed a 686.8 percent increase in daily case counts over the past three weeks, currently more than 10 times the nationwide rate. Meade County’s post-Sturgis uptick is certainly a contributor to this state-level increase, but neighboring counties have experienced a sharp incline in cases, too—ranging from a 1,900 percent increase in the past three weeks in Butte to a 1,050 percent increase in Lawrence."""

"""South Dakota has seen a sharp increase in daily COVID-19 cases following the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in Meade County this month. Hundreds of thousands of bikers descended upon the area August 6-15, despite the Delta variant wreaking havoc on the U.S.On August 4, the date closest to the start of the rally for which data was available, the state reported 657 active cases. On August 25, the state reported 3,655 active cases. That's a 456% increase of active cases from before the start of the rally to two weeks after, according to the state's department of health.As of August 24, about two weeks from the start of the event, South Dakota saw a weekly positivity rate of 38.8%. The week leading up to the rally — July 30 to August 6 — the state's weekly positivity rate was much lower, at 10.38%, the department of health data shows. The week before that, July 23-30, the positivity rate was just 6.10%.The rate of daily cases increased 486% from August 6, when 80 new cases were reported, to August 23, when 469 cases were reported."""
