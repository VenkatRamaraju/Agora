It would be nice to know the timing of this ChMP thing! RDUS resubmitted for them to look it over again but there’s no mention of timing. Does anyone know anything on this matter?
I’m not sure why I’m not panicking even though I’m down a ship load of money
Somebody is offloading. I’m beginning to think the sales numbers must be bad.
"seems like today somebody did a collar buying 35 march puts and partially financing it with a 50 march call net proceeds 1$ for 786 contracts, but probably to small to be meaningful but nevertheless interesting"
Market cap is back down to 600 Million....thats a litle more than 2x Sales of Tymlos. Even with some valid criticisms of the company's size and overhead that is empiracly cheap especially considering new markets and drugs on the near horizon. Not a bad spot to pick up a trading position
So today’s downturn is not RDUS specific; the whole biotech sector is getting crushed.
"I am sorry to say but do not buy the dip yet, all indices as well as RDUS have given sell signals over the last few days. RDUS has broken the uptrend we had from 25 and we first need to wait to see whether the next support levels hold. This move we are seeing right now is impulsive and strong in the indices. RDUS is doing much better, relative strength vs index and small volume, however no bottom in momentum indicators right now. As I wrote 10 days ago ""we will see a signal within the next 5-10 days"" , unfortunately this signal was a sell for me, so I will be patient and see whether we will get either a reversal doji pattern or at least a flattening of the momentum. my best guess as mentioned is before is that we might see a right shoulder building somewhere between 32 and 34.5, will see but for the time being I stay flat. GLTAL"
It has got very quiet with the board and the volume
"Trey, buy this book, read it, learn about the correlation of option delta, gamma, the probability of an exercise and one day you might understand what i meant when I mentioned the ""delta of dilution"" or to make it easier for you - what is the likelihood of an exercise at a certain point and therefore expected likelihood of a dilution. You might not understand this, as it is not gramar 101, but if you are willing to learn, you might understand it one day. the likelihood of an exercise right now is about 35% and therefore the likelihood of a dilution as well. Maybe you want to post it on Twitter, you might for once look intelligent with your friends there............https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=c1N36C7LxU4C&pg=PA371&lpg=PA371&dq=probability+of+dilution+and+delta+function+in+convertible+bond&source=bl&ots=Uk4L7wG5Pq&sig=oPuEPthLthBEvPPMn6T_WN91cgo&hl=es-419&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiI0uKQ977aAhUIQ6wKHQpLC2sQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=probability%20of%20dilution%20and%20delta%20function%20in%20convertible%20bond&f=false"
Nice day. Let’s go $30. Looks like the street liked the acquisition of the new orphan drug
Hoping RDUS follows ARRY's lead and gets bought out soon. 6 month charts on each look very similar to me!
No volume so this drifts lower........Still undervalued. Just picked some up as an announcement could come anytime that they have sold their cancer portfolio.......it will pop on that cash.
New guy took options deal at current stock price. He is top notch and must know good things ahead or would have walked. The need for take-overs is starting to be thrown out by the media and RDUS is so undervalued. Stay strong.
Could explode from here Back to $85
"Alert to buy: Milad just sent me a private message that he’s fed up and exited his position the second time, thus the reason for cutting losses and turning green. —:)"
"No correlation to RDUS, but EMA CHMP gave a negative opinion for PBYI, when the FDA approved? To be clear, Tymlos is a good product/drug, but just for a point of reference"
anybody out there????
"Every body to bullish beware. we have no buy signal yet, but at the same time we have no negative divergences. as I said before be patient and wait for the signal and a break out so that we have a proper inverse SHS formation, NL is around 40.5 to 41.5. anticipating this move might cost, rather give up these 2 dollar to make 15 if it happens, if not we could se2 a consolidation of 10-20%, I am still flat and are waiting for the signals to come"
"strategy for the next 2 weeks before figures are coming out. We didn't have an immediate positive confirmation of the hammer 3 days ago, however all momentum indicators have turned and the last few days also showed a relative strength vs the indexes. My best guess is that we will have a rebound towards the 50 day moving average around 35.5 I will stay long for this expected move but will sell before figures are coming out. they have disappointed for the last 8 quarters and the last one, even sales were ok, the costs were totally out of control and I first want to see that they control the cost. so if the stock does what I hope for, I will sell with a profit of 8% and see how the stock reacts after earnings"
"With price this low, BB Biotech needs to step up and take this company private. Since the new CEO took over from Ward, it has been a disaster for shareholders."
Morgan Stanley revisited price target today 12/20/2018. They lowered target to $45. Plus recent Insider Buy. The stock hasn't been this low since September 2014. I'm willing to be patient.
"How much of the rise is due to short covering and how much is due to improved outlook? Anyway I’ll take either or, preferably, both."
The head of investor relations Elhan Webb used to work at BB Biotech
"Morgan Stanley report on Nov. 2nd, solid quarter, reaffirms base case price target of $57 and bull case target of $147."
New guy on board -next you will hear new product positive updates . A person of his caliber does not go to a sinking ship. This is the bottom.
Interesting read on how and why BB Bio invests into its portfolio companies. They obviously believe in the fundamentals of RDUS as its now its 7th largest position.https://www.bbbiotech.ch/en/bb-biotech/strategy-portfolio/investment-strategy/
"BB Bio adding 60k @ 19.65, total held: 6,590,276"
This volatility today at this level is positive for the market. If we close flat or up it means that the week hands are out and I would bet that next week we will go up again. Buying a few stocks for trading and rebound
"i guess that some are very much biased here, the ""demotion"" of the VP for me rather hints that there might be issues or delays for the products the VP is responsible. at least this is what happens at other companies. combining this news with the price action and the momentum indicators i will continue to wait and put limits in in the low 32 scaled down and a stopp at 31"
Some news coming soon ?
"Nice rebound in the markets and RDUS over the last 3 days. so where do we go from here.as mentioned before, I have sold my positions in Europe and also have sold the rest in RDUS as I am not quite clear on the signals I get. I looks like the worst might be over, however I still feel that there is more volatility to come. RDUS might potentially give a buy signal this week but I will be patient and wait whether we can take out resistance I mentioned before."
wake me up when we are at $36. $50 by March. So undervalued with nothing but good news and inside buying. The day will come when shorts will be taken to the wood shed.

Morgan Stanley reiterates Overweight rating and Base case price target of $45 on 3/4/2019. Their Bull case on RDUS has a price target of $154.
"what disturbs me a bit is that management hasn't bought any shares this year, only BB was insider buyer and we are at a 52 week low. would love to see management stepping in and buy this would give me more confidence. why are they not buying at these leves, are they waiting for bad sales figures, another secondary?? many questions - but if they were that confident as in their conf call they would buy if they were congruent...…………."

"Some relief to see today’s price action after what seems like an eternity. I would like to see volume pick up and it holds $30 plus by closing and, hopefully this momentum continues in coming days."
Any dip is a good buy until earnings
"after having closed the gap at 37.11 we have seen a reversal candle today until now. Nothing dramatic as not a dark cloud cover, but nevertheless a small reversal that could lead us back below 35 where we have another small gap opening after the upgrade last week. Momentum indicators are not negative but flattening out, so my best guess is that we might have a little more to go for the time being. The before mentioned strategy to buy towards 31.5-32.5 with a tight stopp at 31 remains. I continue to dislike the markets and therefore continue to play it small and safe, rather miss a trade than take a big hit.GL"
"Maybe the market is starting to sit up and see the potential in this stock; 10% higher this month since its low point. Analysts covering this stock are split between buy and hold with an average target of $50. Hedge funds hugely positive as is ""insider buying"" Hopefully it will surpass my average buy price of $35.59 in the not too distant future."
we breaking out here?
Citigroup upgrades to buy! Price target is $40
"yesterdays price action was not that nice, initially we had a dark cloud cover and settled for a hanging man. Both chart patterns are not the best as they show increased volatility after a strong run up. momentum is starting to weaken but no sell signal yet. as we have hit the 200 ma and entered the first resistance at around 36.5 to 37.5 on the way to the 4 handle it is most likely that we sill see a consolidation - we might see a consolidation to the 32.5 to 33.5 level meaning a 10 % correction. for people who bought the break at 33 I would sell these, keep core and try to buy them back lower - it feels a little heavy here"
"Just because we received FDA approval, doesn’t mean EMA CHMP approval was “likely”. For example, look at Keytruda. The further we were delayed and the more CHMP extensions we received, we kind of knew. The good news is, the market is pricing this in, the European market isn’t that important."
"we are reaching a crucial level in the macd over the next 72 hours. we are very close to a sell signal and this signal has been quite accurate in this stock. I hope that Milad is right and we get good news from the FDA and can reverse this possibly negative chart pattern.the candles do not show any relieve for the time being - after the hanging man any reversal attempt was torn down, so stay disciplined and patient, I believe you might get a better entry level. medium term the structure still looks like a bull flag to me, so i stick to my view that will see higher prices this year. The wave count might be a 5 wave count and now being in 4th so the 5th should lead us to the before mentioned 40 is level later this year. btw the s&p is building divergences too, new highs are not confirmed by momentum indicators, but no sell signal yet, but things are getting a little toppish there too"
"I put in a ticket to sell at $60 why let them use my shares to short. Never thought we would go this low. Not selling. Will add a little. Shorts will pay, its a matter of time."
"SOMETHING IN THE BUSHI believe there is a big move coming within the next 3 months as we have built a huge 18 month triangle, a break of this will be very decisive and we will see either a move to 20 or 40, as MACD is close to a buy on the 2 year chart, I would give slightly higher odds to a break on the upside - I will however wait for the break to happen before getting in againGLTAL"
Lets see if they surprise us tomorrow at the conference and announce something that burns the shorts! I’m not holding much hope with this management team but will see. Hope they finally do something. Announce partnership or any new good news
"So hen they say ""First half of 2018"" does that mean we will hear the results in July? Or perhaps some time before then? Seems like they always wait until the very last day of whatever estimate they give."
Two days in a row we turn green. Wow. They just filed an 8K not sure why
"Just add more. The stock is breaking out. STO @82, RSI @65 and moving up.Will be $25 in a month or 2."
No real catalyst to move share price until next quarters results.
"I bought the first few shares, divergences and volume indicates we might have seen a bottom, will see if follow through will come over next few days. First target 24.5 some 20% upside"
"The legal counsel just bought 1,778 shares on Friday at $28.09"
"first signs are arising that we might actually bottom out a little higher than I thought. after the 10% correction it seems like the absolute momentum indicators are slowly flattening out and that the 33-33.5 support level might hold. relative strength however is still weakish. the Bollinger bands continue to tighten, so we might soon see a decisive move. right now I do not know in which direction, but we should see some clarification until the end of the weak. I am still flat for the time being, but ready to step in small again for a trade if and when the indicators and/or the candlesticks give me a signal. GL"
Heading back to over $40 a share.
Anyone wants to guess what the revenue will be like and the reaction to the report? I guess a number around $16 million and a modest upside to share price.
27.6 million in sales / 22% increase from last quarter / pretty healthy Medicare numbers and Tymlos sales projections for 19
A decent up day but unfortunately not with any convincing volume.
If I’m not mistaking it looks like BB bio picked ip another 50K shares late Friday? So that was 50k on the 25th and 50K on the 27th? I see it on some website but not others. Hopefully not spreading fake news.
"Another reason the share price keeps going down is the insiders trading, so far I haven't seen any employee buying at this low price which only means one thing to the investors that they don't have confidence in the company either"
Bottoms in. To all shorts time to run - we are not going any ware.
"Averaging up, buy pattern confirmed, first target 21.83, then 24-24.5"
"what has changed since 20181. stock is in a long term uptrend and has an open gap at 25-272. stock is oversold and has built positive divergencies on a 5 year chart3. Trey has not learned anything in live and still believes to be the oracle of Delphi and having the right to abuse people4. Strategie: start to go long on weak days, use option strategy to go in, sell 17.5 July put for 2.5, buy 20 July call at 3.5 for a net debit of 15. we might continue so see a bit of a bumpy ride for the time being but risk reward seems to be positive around this level for the next 6-12 months6. don't be greedy, start small and once the trend goes into your direction add to your position, first target 25-27"
"small update before year end. charts still look encouraging and after having closed the gap we never traded below 27 again and ticked slowly up with little volume. the early divergences we had seen 2 weeks ago have not been confirmed and the sky seems to be blue for the time being, as mentioned before we will enter resistance in the 32.5-33.5 area. this is pretty crucial as a break of this level would confirm a bullish reverse pattern with a target of 40.5-41 where the next resistance lies. as mentioned before the chart patterns look rather good for 2018 and I would continue to expect a move towards the 40 level within the next 6 months. stay long but wait to add either below 27 or with a break of the 33.5-34 level with a target of 40ish. HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS 2018 TO EVERY BODY"
ABFT we have a decent day after a good earnings report IMHO
what is this we are going up!
"the management has not bought one stock the price has halved since the CEO has bought some stocks, BB has not bought since august 20th at 19.5, o what is going on?? as long as the management doesn't show confidence this stock will continue to erode, lots of presentations, speaking about progress and pipeline but no action, words are cheap, I WANT TO SEE THE MANAGEMENT PUTTING SOME SKIN INTO WHAT THEY COMUNICATE...………..."
Bring on the analysts upgrades and hopefully they will be listened to this time!
"@Milad Please can you get out, the market is waiting for this signal. When you last sold your position the stock went up 10%.Only joking, as we need to get a smile from somewhere. GL"
"Three possibilities as I see it: (1) Margin longs being squeezed, (2) Something amiss with either the trading results or the product, (3) It is at a price which is “the bargain of the year”."
News has to be coming. I’m thinking partnership or buyout. Just a guess
"There is a trade I am considering to do this week. If you believe that the markets stabilize and that volatility will recede, have a loo at XIV. this is an inverse daily volatility ETF that has been crushed over the last 2 days. This instrument has also been blamed apart from algorithm trading for the rapid sell off 2 days ago. this thing was trading at 145 usd 4 days ago now at 6.1, so if you believe that the markets stabilize and the volatility will go down again you can make a small bet on this and make a small fortune if you are right and Credit Suisse doesn't call the product it has the right to if it trades at 20% of the previous daily close. I am considering to put a little money in this as a bet"
Bob Ward was in for the quick buck......................
Can someone help me understand the upside here?
"this move today doesn't make sense at all. Might be option expiry but there are only a few hundred 35 calls open interest, so it might be an OTC transaction weighing on stock.put my tow in the water for a few shares below 34, but kept 3/4 of the money dry if we were to reach the next support levels."
Wow- just wow with this company
Morgan Stanley reiterates Buy rating and $52 price target on Dec. 7th.
Maybe I should sell it to help my fellow longs because every stock I’ve sold recently has gone up even more.
did we break through 20 for good?
What happened to Marco. Anyone from the old days when he used to post here regularly
How about laying off the sales force with an announcement the company is pursuing alternative solutions. That would get the stock moving.
as the figures were more or less in line or a touch better i could buy back my stocks at the level i sold it yesterday. the feared disappointment did not happen and so I will follow again the charts that look constructive for the time being and hope for a rebound towards the 35.5-37.5 level
"B.B. bought another 50k shares! They haven’t given up and are still stocking up, whatever that’s worth!"
"last month rdus presents on breast cancer (elacestrant) trial: The data presented gave management enough confidence to green light a phase 2 study that will kick off in early 2018. Since elacestrant has already received fast track designation from the FDA, it is possible that data from the phase 2 study could be enough for Radius Health to seek regulatory approval."
"I bought back today at $27.70. I feel like even if they got a negative opinion from the EMA guys, then the price shouldn’t go down much since it’s priced in! I believe this is the company’s last chance so no matter what, the next step is to find a partner over seas with or without abaloparatide! The other catalyst is Rad1901 and Rad140 data in the next 4 months! I feel OK about it, will see if earnings keep going up and cost of operations is controlled! I’m really banking on the management team so I hope they deliver for us all! Just my opinions!"
ok now i agree this is too much went in at 32.5 which was my first target
Bought small this morning at 33.5
Can anyone confirm?The Company plans to report its complete fourth quarter and audited full-year 2019 financial and operating results in February 2020.
"Good report from San Antonio mtging. Sales ahead of expectations for Tymlos, hear on EU next week; Express scripts starting Jan 1; partnerships 1st quarter of next year if EU approved. SERD data looks favorable and will move on to phase two. Good set up for 2018!"
"So what do you guys make of the report? I quickly glanced through it and the revenue is slightly above estimates, the loss was pretty much in line."
"There’s barely any options activity for the next 3 months, especially the call options. It probably means not much movement in either direction, but it’s already devastating the last two weeks."
"if one is bullish one might see a triangle forming on the 30 min chart that could give us a 2 dollar upside, however I rather believe, as I mentioned before that we will consolidate and close the gap below 35 - why - the relative as well as absolut momentum and rsi are weakening, which is normally a sign of further distribution patterns. I remain flat for the time being unless either of my signal triggers a direction. there are very clearly better stocks with more momentum and more interesting chart patterns as RDUS"
"RDUS Director Jessica Hopfield purchased 12,800 shares on Tuesday"
we done for... frustration finally setting in.
"good morning everyone. I lost money on AMD and SQUARE. Now, I want to put all my money in Rdus. Anyone can advice me. the reasons I put all in. Because, I trust BB, insider, good stock, cheap price and potential to moves up. I have 1100 shares. I will buy 900 shares more at open market. Thank you."
"since the reversal 2 weeks ago the stock has added some 8% , the indicators do not show any divergences and keep on being positive. I continue to believe that we might see a move towards 32 to 33 before December 15th as some might cover their shorts before the CMPH advisory panel decision. contrarian to some here I believe that a positive decision (even though only 20% of sales) will trigger a positive move and some shorts will cover. the next 6 months will show how sales are going but the charts (wave counts and timing indicators) continue to indicate a likely good 2018. GLTAL"
Finally phase 3 of Elacestrant has been initiated and Rad140 phase I dose escalation is still ongoing. This update along with some presentations at SABCS is good to see and should help the price of the stock for the near future in my opinion.
I believe Jesper Høiland has sold two or three companies in the past
"All things considered, RDUS weathered the storm quite well!"
"That was some nice action yesterday. Lets hope it follows on to today. Would love to see a break through $38 with good, steady volume."
"Great buying opportunity today, completely oversold. No negative news. Solid Q3 earnings. The news about Elacestrant future partnership wasn’t taken well, but doesn’t justify a share price move from 30 to 21. Nor does Evenity approval in EU.We should see continued revenue growth in Q4, along with solid 2020 revenue guidance. We should see 2020 full year sales somewhere around 250-300 million or more. Current market cap of RDUS is $972 million..."
"After hours trades are mostly small except a trade for over 12000 at $27.73, let’s see how it trades during regular market."
"Prescriptions rising nicely!Tymlos growth reflects access expansionAs we enter the new year, Tymlos is gaining formulary exclusivity from Express Scripts’commercial business, which represents approximately 11% of total lives. Accordingly, weclosely monitor Tymlos and Forteo scripts and note that Tymlos New to Brand (NBRx)scripts and total scripts (TRx) increased 43% and 25%, significantly outpacingcompetitor Forteo’s NBRx growth of 3% and TRx decrease of 18% while the overallanabolics market NBRx increased 12% and TRx decreased 15% in the week ending01/05/18. Of note, NBRx is the number of new patients coming onto a therapy class. Inour view, Tymlos’ NBRx trend could be a leading indicator for TRx and an effectivemeasure on patient acquisition. As of January 3, 2018, Tymlos had access toapproximately 214M covered lives compared to 268M lives for Forteo in the US.However, since its launch, Tymlos has steadily gained NBRx market share to 29% in theweek ending 01/05/08 (Chart 1). We see 50% Tymlos share of NBRx by end of 2018.For the week ending January 12, IMS reported 271 NRx and 496 TRx of Tymlos,representing 15% and 8% market share, respectively. We believe Tymlos’ upward scripttrends in January provide positive signals for its continued patient acquisitions throughswitches as well as expansion of the overall anabolics market (Chart 2). We maintain ourBuy rating on RDUS.Excerpt from ML report."
We all should email the company and get them to say/do something to explain this unjustified bs drop. I can’t believe they haven’t done anything unless they know something that they’re hiding. What else could it be?

"The Cup with Handle is a bullish continuation pattern that marks a consolidation period followed by a breakout. It was developed by William O'Neil and introduced in his 1988 book, How to Make Money in Stocks.As its name implies, there are two parts to the pattern: the cup and the handle. The cup forms after an advance and looks like a bowl or rounding bottom. As the cup is completed, a trading range develops on the right-hand side and the handle is formed. A subsequent breakout from the handle's trading range signals a continuation of the prior advance.If you look it up in a dictionary this RDUS 6 month chart shows up"
MPM has issued a 13D.Has sold its entire position. Any thoughts?
"Since RDUS has reached it's target area of 32-33 2 days ago, we have seen a consolidation of about 10%. The momentum indicators have been weakening too and we have a gap open at 27.41, which we might fill. I know that some will say that charts are not relevant before a binary event and I agree but its a part of the puzzle to consider.a lot of people wrote extensively about the schedule and what the likelihood is of getting approved based on their views. I will try to add to it but a little more statistically. 1. The charts might indicate further downside for the time being.2. a study of a broker was mentioning yesterday (for another company who is going through a second review as well) that the EPA/CMPH has been very restrictive in overturning initial decisions and that statistically there is only a 25% chance of getting an approval after refusal the first time ( I really do not know why, but it seems they have real problems to jump over their own shadow and implicitly consent that their first decision was a mistake).3. some suggested to buy protection with December puts, this is very risky as the decision might come out after expiration. I have seen it in two stocks that the companies normally delay publishing the results until the stock exchange is closed or even only communicate on Monday even though it is adhoc sensitive information. I would therefore advice to go for the January one it's the safer bet, you do not want to lose fire insurance when the house is on flames.4. depending on your tax status (capital gain) it might be better to do a cash extraction strategy = sell stock and buy calls with the rest in cash.Based on these thoughts I've been selling out my stocks when we reached my target area of 32-33 and have started to buy 30 Jan calls instead. if you do that be aware that the 30 Jan call only has a delta of 52 (i.e. for every dollar the underlying moves the option moves by .52 cents). if you want to participate 1:1 you need to buy 20 calls for each 1000 stocks you sell. Time decay (theta) shouldn't be too much of a concern as the news will be out in the next 5 days and therefore you will not be hit too much by this, however the implied volatility (vega) will hit you as once the news is out this parameter will decrease.so lets hope all statistics are wrong and we get the approval and head towards the 40 area where we will encounter the next resistance if we move above the 32 to 33 resistance.GLTAL"
BB biotech buying again and also an employee purchase. Fingers crossed.
"Where is Milad, Arif, Marco?? this board is been extremely sad and quite as of lately."
News out on Elacestrant
Engulfing candle pattern trend reversal
"$7.7M, not horrible"
"Have been watching rdus for a while. Here are my 2 cents as potential investor without being emotionally attached long. Good company but stock at this point is not honestly worth $1.7B. Burning about $55m per they are literally 2 years away from being profitable, at least. Tymlos uptake should increase but they would be lucky to make $40m net in 2018 which is still crazy rich 40x earnings valuation. New Investors should honestly stay on sidelines monitoring Tymlos sales which is the main revenue driver. Rest of the pipeline in early stages. And when comparing rdus to other biotech peers there are definitely way better plays with similar valuation, profitable and making $170-300m per year. Cort and Supn are such examples"
Finally showing a respectable move up with increasing volume.
good way to end the week. anyone else nervous for ER on Thursday? or just me?
RDUS had a pretty good day on Friday but as usual there’s no follow through. Is the narrow trading range today really due to the presentation today? I wonder what could they really disclose that wasn’t already done on earnings call?
"RDUS up 3% as we speak, go figure"
I’m toast if this doesn’t go up like $10 tomorrow. And that would only be recovering about a month’s losses.
This is trading like we'll have bad news tomorrow.
"Patch trial is “pivotal”, meaning we could get FDA approval as soon as end points met after day 29 dose, which could be in as little as 6 weeks. Hoping this patch trial will also satisfy EMA for approval in Europe. This may well be the turning point we have been waiting for. GLTA."
hard to say ER gonna be good with the CEO out. unless it was personal reasons... didn't read up on that.
New trials over 400 people with 2021 FDA approval target well underway. PR department seemed very positive.
Almost twice the average volume today and it moves how much? Somebody accumulating?
"Most recent analyst said that tymlos alone is worth a market cap for Rdus of 1.5 billion or $35/share. This means that the rest of the pipeline is heavily discounted and. not even counted for. Right now, we’re at 1.39 billion in valuation or $30.77/ share. What bugs me is that management is sitting back and not doing anything for us shareholders!"
"so the target for the triangle break out that occurred is 18-20. This would imply a valuation range of 750 to 850 million usd. This would only be logical to me if we were to see a dilution of 20 % or so. I am not a fundamentalist but this company is valued at roughly one times peak sales and you get all the other indications and possible new product for free.so for me there are 3 possible reasons why this is happening1. we need money as cost continue to be out of control and sales don't increase as quickly as one expected => dilution 2. we are missing the point and the generics that might hit the market in 12 months might really eat into sales prospects so that it trades 2 times peak sales that is still not that expensive if you value the pipeline3. Stock specific issues of forced liquidation, margin calls (3 point?) or just chartists playing the move that has been triggered.I really don't know but this move the last 7 days really feels climatic to me, will see what will happen but I am definitively oing to start to write some 20 puts into January and put some limits in to buy into the low 20ties and below unless we have a huge fundamental change, gltal3."
CHMP Fail seems highly unlikely. If it fails its not going to be because of safety issues. Tymlos doesn't have any side effects beyond other drugs in the field that are already approved. If it fails its going to be because the EME doesn't think the testing was thorough enough - which means acceptance will be delayed until they feel better testing has shown results.I've been around long enough to know better than to predict things like this - but it would be a big shock if the CHMP rejects TYMLOS. I'd say 20% would be a fair assumption if that occurs - maybe more as a knee jerk reaction.
"I wanted to sell 800 shares, but I changed my mind. I want to double down right here, I just bought it 1000 shares at $31.02."
"i agree with everybody here that we seem to flatten out and have problems to pass the resistance in the low 40ties. momentum indicators seem to flatten out too and we see small divergences. my best guess is that we first consolidate back to the 36-37 level before going higher. the signals are not quite clear hear, but we can see very clearly that the momentum is not there for the time being. the indicators are at a crucial level and will give a signal over the next 5-10 days - if I had to bet I would guess down as everything is a little extended , BUT, I am not going to anticipate any signal and wait patiently for any to happen so that I will not make the same mistake as last time."
"I hope BB buy an other 50k shares, Rdus will gain 5 t0 10% more."
Nice move today!! I hope continues next week.
I think Tymlos is different enough that it will continue grow and sooner or later to reach blockbuster or near blockbuster sale.If patches approved it can speed up that quiet a bit. Overall this is great drug.On top breast cancer drug result is binary event can double or even triple stock prices. Downside risk is small since Tymlos sales will help support price at current level.I have 2500 and loading up more (I will have 2000 more if price remain below 22.5)
Radius management rang the bell today at the stock exchange. On he day of reporting earnings. Must be good news coming from that front
o great
So Marco’s post from 6 days ago predicting that it would consolidate back to 36-37 area was right on the money.
"Thank you for the upgrade sold half my position at 36.5 as i still believe we are range bound for the time being, happy Eastern and Passover"
It's all about Tymlos sales and exceptions on the TD and Rad 1901. Would be a boost to hear positive news from European effort regarding their MAA for abaloparatide SC. Hope that the results are not already baked in.............
"So frustrating. The analysts have the stock as a buy with a consensus price target of $55 (we should be so lucky!), “insider” buying has been consistently high for a year or so now, the fundamentals appear to be improving, R&D seem to be going in the right direction, and yet the share price is languishing. I just don’t get it!"
"MAYBE THE WORST IS OVER, there wasn't the wash out i hoped for, however the volume has increased and we see that the sellers find better buyers around the 29 level.rsi as well as macd are flattening out and we are at the lower end of the Bollinger band. so i am not quite calling a bottom, but this and sorry to say, the counter indicator always being bearish at the bottom, might make me feel that we are very close, so will see what happens. i am still flat after having sold at 32.58 but might consider a little trade the next few days. GLTAL"
"Long of this stock at an average price of $35.59, ""insider"" activity underpins my confidence but closely listening to Marco who really seems to have his finger on the pulse."
I honestly would have never thought I would see the stock trade like this! It’s trading at half the price before Tymlos approval and progression of their oncology pipeline! What’s frustrating is the silence from the company!
Morgan Stanley raised target today from $57 to $61 Black Rock bought just a few weeks ago. Biotech's up across the board on down market. Growth stocks will again take over starting next week. Its not about revenue with a biotech its the success of the pipe. RDUS is fine. Don't let the machines take your shares. This will soon be a great gift. Have a great weekend. March will be a homerun for Biotech's and it will pull RDUS with it.
to the moon from this day forwRd
Just no belief in this company - all support gone.
"if you want to buy something in good old Switzerland buy COTN SW (Comet Holding)reasons:1. be long CHF against USD, raising wedge formation fulfilled - target 93-95, CHF will benefit as safe haven during this trade war2. tripple top NL breach with target of 102 we reached today and 1/3 Fibonacci retracement from top at 1683. positive divergencies in RSI not confirming price action4. filled gap from back in February 20175. sound financials with a in demand product that will grow over next 5 yearsfirst target 118 then 125, stopp 95 - upside 15-20 %, downside 7%"
Going to take a long time and many earnings beats for this stock to recover. Very high short %
Now we need some analysts upgrades. Hopefully we start moving upward from here. I just want my money back and you’ll never see me again :)
"NBRx for Tymlos up to 23%, for what it’s worth"
almost back to even... been tough ride! Hope the price action continues onward and upward!
cant we catch a break?
"Good morning things look quite a bit better. RSI flat and turning, macd still down but flattening. I would expect a retest of the resistance area 37.5-40 this week if the markets do what I mentioned on Friday. Will sell into strength and keep powder dry to either buy back lower or the before mentioned break at 40.4-42 that will trigger a inverse SHS formation with a potential target price of 55 this year"
Wonder why the volume has dried up suddenly?
"Is anybody familiar with the Ipsen-Radius arbitration? Doesn't seem like a big deal, but has been going on for over one year per the 10Q reports"
"I haven't seen anything like this since 2008-2009. The rsi went from 85 to 22 the macd from 50 to minus 25. Biggest point loss ever in the DJI.Worries inflation, crypto, high yield, valuationI have mentioned before i was worried about a market sell off, now 11% in s&p within 5 daysThere were some bargains in Europe this morning in the opening, felt like climax sell off with panic, most of these stocks have already regained half of their loses.We have been craving for some inflation to creep back into the economy, the dollar is at it's low for the last 5 years, taxes will be dramatically lower for the years to come, market feels like heavily oversold and not to forget that hedge funds had their biggest allocation in equities ever according to ML study (i feel this was the trigger when market started to sell off).I am starting to buy s&p futures here, good support around 2500 to 2550, i am not predicting a rebound but my gut tells me it's overdone, so i have bought this morning in Europe and will buy today into this weakness in the s&p for a rebound, good luck to everybody,"
when do they address the european market?
Beat on revenue. Patch trial still on schedule. 12 months of cash on balance sheet. pretty good news for the most part - nothing thats going to double the stock price in the short term.
bought another 200 shares today while its under 26. I'll probably dump those around the $29 level just for a quick profit. Still sitting on my big position waiting a break through 40
pricing in good news AND when the numbers come in on tymlos then perhaps price targets get taken higher.....not to forget elacetrant for breast cancer which is on fast track with the FDA....lots to celebrate!!
Something is up as there’s pre market trading and it’s up a $1
"Lets see $45 into March , then some upgrades. Its been too long of a wait. This should be at $50 looking for $70 with a good update. Biotech's across the board should have a record March. Stay long. Another cheap Bio to watch KERX."
Why aren’t management or BB picking up shares
Dead money holding it; so frustrating
I have 1600 shares of RDUS. I want to sell 800 shares because I am scare about CHMP in EUROPE next week.
Somebody knows something........
Looking good. Any collaboration or buyout news would move this up nicely! Keeping my fingers crossed and hopefully soon enough I’ll get my money back and some
"Pretty unbelievable that there is no buzz anywhere / here / twitter, etc. on the initiation of the Tymlos wearable patch phase 3 trials.Am I the only one seeing that this happened yesterday? Not sure why they announced 2 days before earnings... Will listen to podcast and see if I can learn anything."
They are having hard time recruiting candidates for their phase3 study because candidates must not have received any previous treatment. But they are expanding the sites to include patients from outside US. But this should not be a big concern.
"Everyone seems to think the new CEO is going to ready this company for sale. Does anyone know that, I don’t think so. The only hope this company has is to step up its game, do a better job of communicating and take a more positive attitude toward success. I get it, we are dealing with a pandemic, but they have had time to adjust. The bottom line is turning a positive profit. Increased sales is great, but it’s not enough."
I have secured the financing and will take this company private at $50.
buy it now. you will win this afternoon.
Just my opinion - I think the price is going to be stuck until investors can be assured Tymlos will make more money than it costs to market and distribute. Nobody wants another share dilution. They need to get to about $60 million in quarterly sales. Q1 will give us a good glance.
"Arif, actually I am not disappointed at all and bought more when they were smashing it down below 20. I think it is wonderful to see this reaction, most likely they were looking for the low one to cross the block and than the stock went up again. This might have been the big seller and this might have been his last holding, so NO, I am not disappointed at all, actually very excited because this now might have been the real bottom and the seller might be done. I stick to my view and I am now longer."
"as I have been stopped out at 19.24 I need to review my strategy. it is rather clear that chart analysis doesn't work with this stock any longer. t has worked well for 2 years, however now the move are erratic and conflicting messages come out of candle chart analysis and momentum analysis. I will stop trading this stock for the time being and will instead buy a position in the 17.5 call January 2019 as I see some value at this point. might it go lower - sure 15 is support, might we get a secondary on good news somewhen within the next 9 months, most probably unless they get a good upfront payment for licensing out … the volatility is rather high at 50, but if you see the moves this stock makes within a week or two I belive that paying 4.5 with a break even of 22 might be a good strategy. I am goin to buy some 5k options for 22.5k usd, if the stock were to go back to 40, which is very possible with some positive news until 2020, this option would be worth 22.5 usd or a return of 500%.I kind of like the risk reward at this level, downside 4.5 upside with a bit of luck 22.5 - GLTAL"
sold out rest at gap close of 37.11 no flat
"as mentioned 2 days ago the worst might be over or at least that's what the charts are suggesting. after having closed the gap at 24.76 we had a strong and good technical reaction that continued over the last 2 days. all indicators have turned bullish and we are also close to get a macd buy signal, the first one for some time. the level we are at is quite crucial as the downtrend chanel's upper line is around 28.25. a break above this level would trigger anther buy signal with a target of 32 to 33. things definitely look much better technically. I stay long fully invested with a target of 32 to 33. GLTAL"
"FYI, T. Rowe Price reduced their position in RDUS, from over 6M shares to just over 3M shares. This is most likely the best explanation for why the share price has been steadily declining, not because of poor reviews on Glassdoor. That’s a lot of pressure on the stock, and a lot of shares for the market to absorb."
"Wait till summer, Insiders are buying. Easy $40."
don't expect tymlos will have blockbuster sales. pricing & competition is though there
Nice and strong on a bad market day thus far!
Heading to $44 a share on this move!
Marco. What’s the charts saying? Are you buying at this level?
"After having run up 15% charts continue to look constructive, we are on the way to close the gap at 37.11. MACD very close to a buy signal, will see whether it happens or not, if we get this buy signal i would expect it to go and retest strong resistance at the 40.5-42.5 resistance. sold some and will continue to hold until any indicators show me weakness. GLTAL"
Radius Health (NASDAQ:RDUS): Q2 Non-GAAP EPS of -$0.55 beats by $0.21; GAAP EPS of -$0.77 beats by $0.10.Revenue of $41M (+81.2% Y/Y) beats by $0.4M
I just emailed investor relations asking about the silence and more specifically about an update regarding Elacestrant. Will keep you all updated once I hear anything
Any thoughts Marco?
Short interest is really beginning to drop off. Last time it was this low was Dec 17.
BB Biotech just purchased another 50k shares at $26.24
"There was a large volume on Feb and March 40 calls today, any takeaway from that?"
"so on march 1st we ill know more, we are on the verge to get a buy signal in macd as i mentioned before. if this buy signal were to come with a break above 41 this would be super bullish and the shorts will have to cover. I am flat as i said before, i first want to see the prove of the pudding as we are approaching resistance in the 40-41 area, i just do not trust this market."
An upgrade by Goldman Sachs from neutral to buy and price target raised from $26 to $38. There’s some premarket activity on low volume so far; it could’ve been a better day but negative market sentiment will spoil it.
"I wish everyone well but the reality is that we're a long ways away from the patch or the results from any breast cancer expedited study. After holding for a couple years I sold half at 39 and moved an April 40 call to March 35's, will be happy to be out soon. I bought a bunch of Micron at 46 a couple weeks ago and watched it rise to 60.There's just too much opportunity lost tying up money here any longer. The reality is that RDUS is going to hemorrhage cash for at least the next 18 months with no significant cash flow in the near future. I'll keep RDUS on my radar but I can't see upside catalysts in the near future so I'm out. Good luck."
Need to break $26. This sleeper maybe ready to run. So undervalued should be at $36 with no news.
Nice pop...my bet is BB picked up another lot. I hope escalating SP takes shorts for a ride soon.
"is there a new convertible offering..... did I miss something. Trey if you speak about the old one you are totally wrong. The arbitrage guys who bought the convert are actually buying again and not selling, the lower the price goes the smaller the delta and the less shares they need to be short, so they are net buyers and not sellers as the delta of the convertible is lower at 33 than at 40. IT'S REALLY NOT YOUR DAY........please leave this chat room, your misinformation is so embarrassing it's not even funny any longer"
$20 by Friday. This stock still is 50% underpriced. It's time to run.
I expected rdus to open lower and then go higher today. I hope I'm still right even tho it had a quick start
"Dr. Lorraine Fitzpatrick is transitioning to a new role within the company? I’m glad she’s staying, because she has a wealth of experience"
Dropping fast
"Yes, end of the year,"" they"" will sell losers and winners , balance gains and losses, make books look good, award themselves hefty management fees and send report to their investors. ""They"" will have to wait 30 days to avoid wash/sale rule, so most of ""them"" start buying in towards end of January."
So there was a sell order of about 250K that pushed it down below $26. I don’t believe in conspiracy theories but some big investors know what’s coming and keep selling. Look what happened before the earnings and sellers were proven right.
There is nothing wrong. New management does not want to over promise. Everything on track. Its a buy. Stock should be at $36. Stay strong and long.
Still standing. The have new products in pipeline. This is a market issue not a company issue. Yes I have been a big supporter and yes I am eating crow and crewing - but I still think this work out. I want to thank everyone on this board for being civil.
"Wow :120% institutional ownership 25% : short !!!I guess a lot of betting are going on between the Hedgies .Between you and me, we don't have the money to short/own 25%!!!"
"5 firms filed SC 13G/A forms yesterday....Point 72, Consonance Capital Management, T Rowe Price, Tourbillon Capital Partners & State Street Corp.....Anyone have any insight or comment on this action?"
"milad you are absolutely right, a licence deal can be done at any time whether approved or not. Many deals are actually done before approval to licence it in more cheaply and on the other hand the company licensing it out normally gets development ""help"" milestone payments and royalties later once launched. so Trey sorry, Mr. always right, but you are wrong again"
"Point72, or Stevie Cohen's hedge fund, just announced a 5.1% stake in RDUS, probably explains the bounce afterhours."
I am adding even more . Look at the biotech's almost all up across the board. Growth stocks will be in favor. Just because everyone thinks we can be taken out just now - the pipe line looks very good. Someone could try to steal at $50. You need to stay long. We have been here before - saw this with Juno on a bad report 6 months later a buy out . Even without a buy out $45 is not asking much. Stay long and strong. I feel we will be back to $40 in just a few weeks.
"Something is brewing….. what is it, what is it?"
"OT. I took three week vacation, seems like nothing changed here. Wishing everyone Happy Holidays and hope 2018 will be good year for investors."
Good news coming from Madison Avenue Wed?
What happened here? Any news as this is a big drop in the first few minuets...
"On days like this, BB used to step in and make some nice purchases which would reverse the downtrend! I haven’t seen them add in a while which is really concerning"
"nice hammer today, if confirmed tomorrow, this pattern would be bullish and i would anticipate a move towards, 35 to 37.5 range"
I really hope that management is thinking about selling the company at this point! They can’t do this by themselves. Their oncology pipeline needs to move quicker because of the promise.
"@Milad Atallah ""Looks like B.B. Purchased another 60k shares for $29.27 as well! Hopefully it will go up from here. Not sure what these guys know but they keep buying.""Yes, I saw this as well. A bit mysterious that they have added so much and at a far higher price than at present. Gives me some comfort but not as much as a higher share price!I do think that there is a real possibility that one day, in the not too distant future, we might be in for a nice surprise."
"I wouldn't be surprised if Farrallon Capital starts buying again. They filed a 13D which means they are an activist investor. Also if you look at their previous trading history in RDUS, you'll see that they sold down 74% (from 3,087,000 to 803,800) of their position and then re-bought it back again and some more (from 803,800 to 3,579,00). This time around they've only sold 43% of their position (holding 2,043,149)."
"Charts start to look a little more encouraging. After the sell off we can see a flattening out of momentum indicators and some of them have turned slightly more positive. I would expect the stock to slowly head higher over the next 5-10 days into the 35-36 level and try to close the opening gap we had last week. we do not have a buy signal yet, but if i had to bet i think we have better chances for the stock to make a 10% move up than down, however a lot will depend as mentioned how the markets will do."
what wrong is it?
well I hope the downtrend ends soon... earnings is coming. I need it to be decent for me to want to stay full in.
There’s some premarket volume after a very long time and it’s up a bit. Hope it means a good positive day for all longs.
"There is no way for us retailers to know what the hedges know. So you try to take what risk you can out of your investments. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. Anything under $30 is a gift to be put away until next Christmas if you ask me. But that is just my opinion, nothing more and nothing less. I like to see the big C buying a large stake (large in my book) and BB keeps buying so I feel OK buying here as well. Down a bunch but lowering my avg. price down here. Guess we all will see in a few quarters!"
no wonder why this company dropping likes a rock. check out the review from from its employees https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Radius-Health-Reviews-E1375769.htm
fast track status from the FDA on breast cancer drug in trial with positive early results is why rdus will go higher......
"New management might be on to something. 12.5 million they paid for RAD101 seems cheap to what JAZZ just paid for their new cannabidiol asset. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ) announced a $7.6 billion deal to acquire GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: GWPH), a British biotech company focused on drugs derived from cannabis. The unexpected news sent shares of GW Pharmaceuticals soaring 46%."
"Is RDUS now in resistance area around $33+ and can go either way? To break the resistance, we would need a strong up volume day or If the volume stays low, it can easily be pushed back to $30. Any thoughts?"
Run into investor day?
I guess we are getting this fill the gap thing out of the way prior to any announcement.
"CTO filed earlier today:Radius Health, Inc. submitted an application under Rule 24b-2 requesting confidential treatment for information it excluded from the Exhibits to a Form 10-Q filed on November 2, 2017.

Late start on presentation?
G - is spot on this is a good report. Sales ramping up more new things in pipe line. This is a hold. The China market scare pulled this down We will move up to $24 then $27 once market has China leveling off- unless someone just takes them out. New board member great add. Its a biotech it takes time but at least this is a very solid player with many products.
"BB Biotech just bought 80,000 more shares of the company at $32.52 per share, on March 02, 2018."
BlackRock raises stake by 68K shares in newly filed 13G/A.
I'm scared dropped a bunch before ER
Crumbling.....right before your eyes with no sign of easement ahead..............Jasper has a tall task ahead.
Amgen’s osteoporosis drug Evenity was just rejected in the EU. Tymlos was rejected by them as well and got the shorts all of the Radius’s stock which is one of the reasons it fell in my opinion! At least the EU is consistent but the patients in the EU are missing out on new treatment options. Tymlos should have been approved in my opinion.
action since the open is Not Good!
"Hopefully EU approval will come in the next week or so. Should at least see some kind of short term pop from that. I think year-end selling might be a factor, though. Not execting any substantial upside moves until January."
I think RDUS held its own today considering. From what I read the earnings call will be at 8 am....I have bullish feelings on this time slot. 3 Months of s-scripts support could surprise. Thoughts?
Looks like there were a couple of large block trades over 300K shares of sales. I hope this is not a sign of what’s coming later this week.
"THE CHARTS LOOK GREEN..................BUT...............I am selling out here before the figures even though the charts look promising. macd is just giving a buy signal, RSI has momentum and we closed above the 31.5-32 level that was important to abolish the negative chart pattern.so why do I sell out with a minimal profit, I just don't trust the management that they can control costs and the last 8 quarters were always worse than expected and disappointed and therefore I follow my gut and not the charts.I first want to see that the new management establishes a positive track on figures and cost control. In my view this is the issue holding the stock back and I also disagree with Trey, having running costs of 70 mln a quater and minimal sales will raise the question of cash at hand within the next 12 months, unless they can strike a deal and the partner is going to take on some of the costs or pays a big upfront payment.so will see tomorrow, normally I follow charts but right now I will follow my gut"
"""$RDUS Expected to be on the CHMP Agenda of December 9th for Tymlos approval in EU."""
Stocked bounced up today after an initial drop with the rest of the market. People are buying on dips even on down market days.....that's a really good sign
"""beati paupers spiritu"", Trey, funny you mention INCY, a classic example how charts work. back in march 2017 it formed a classic top formation with a confirmed evening star and divergences, the first sell signal, the second came at the end of October when it broke the NL at 110 when it filled the GAP from January 2017 (remember most gaps will get closed) and left another classic top formation with a target price of 66-67. So if you want to be so smart, at least choose a stock that hadn't given twice a clear and strong sell signal. as I said before I am so sorry that you do not find anything else in life that satisfies you than picking on people sharing their view on this board. Why don't you start to work for a NGO, working with children that are underprivileged or have special needs, believe me Trey it is very satisfying and might help you to overcome your frustration in life. go to pursuit-of-happiness.org and see what happy people have in common, maybe you will find that one of the 7 habits of happy people might be something for you."
I know this stock for long time. RDUS should be $50. I don't know why it is under $35?
The growth on Tymlos is fantastic. On that alone this should be trading in the 30's. Also the chief science officers comments at the end of the call on RAD140 were very positive. The pipeline will be the real catalyst for the stock price.
The trading so far suggests that there’s a lot of anticipation for the conference.
RDUS announced this morning the latest 2019 Medicare Part D coverage for TYMLOS which increased to approximately 26.2 million lives or 64% of those enrolled in Medicare Part D plans in the U.S.
"If this moves passed $20 this week, everyone should look to add more.Chart looks pretty good so far. MACD > 0. RSI @ 62.5 and should hit above 70 if we hold trend."
I'm just wondering what sales numbers have to be in quarter for the stock to go positive.
Without trying to sound like a cheerleader I'll say it does seem like we are finally turning a corner execution wise with the company fundamentals: Tymlos international expansion into Japan and promising outlook for EU. Patch trial on the verge of submission to FDA. More broad range of treatment for these drugs...and then the partnerships with the oncology stuff. 2021 is looking like the year this thing turns a profit and actually begins to build financial standing.
"The company needs to show the value of its assets! I recall Bon Ward during one of his cc’s stating that Tymlos alone is worth 1.5 billion alone. Therefore, the remainder of three pipeline is not valued. If Rad1901 continues to show good data with good safety, it should be worth more then 1 billion. The company is at 1.3 billion dollars currently at just over $28 dollars. The company needs to hammer this at their next conference call!"
The last two trading days have been good with increased volume; there’s not likely to be much movement in either direction until the earnings on Thursday 3/1. So fingers crossed and we’ll find out what they report and say for remainder of the year.
BB picked another 50K shares. No faith lost over there.
This stock never fails to disappoint you when you feel a little optimism. Even a good chart reader like Marco must have been deceived by this move.
"For almost 3 days, RDUS is stuck in this very narrow range on declining volume. I’m worried that if it doesn’t move up from here, it could be pushed down on low volume."
Wait for some large insider buys ???
Trey - what are your thoughts as to why the EC approved Evenity (even though box warning of increased risk of myocardial infarction) while not approving TYMLOS? Different class via bone building capability??
"so, as mentioned before confirmation today with a nice big candle after the ""kind of hammer"" yesterday. RSI ha turned positive but is at 33, so room to run, macd no buy yet but on the verge, most likely if we hold or go higher towards 22 we will get a buy in the next 8 hours. so chart vice, all is green and we can expect another 10-15%. Stay long or even increase positions with a stop at 19 target 24.44"
Any thoughts on whats fueling this recent rally? Seems to be backed by some nice volume. M&A chatter? Pipeline progress?Blowout Q1 Tymlos numbers? With some positive news about now this could bounce pretty nicely.
Next stop $45 way to cheap. Biotech's will all run. Staying long all this time will be rewarded.

@James.....what's the deal?
"Now the company has officially stated they will have enough money for at least 12 months without any licensing deal (so Trey my guess was not that wrong 9-12 months). They have about 320 mln in cash and cash equivalent plus the revenues that are going to grow. We are running at a burn rate of 70 mln a quater - this makes 280 mln in 12 months plus the revenues over the next 12 months that should be around 200mln. THE MATH DOESN'T ADD UP - 320 cash plus 200 mln revenues, they should have 520 mln by june 2019 - if they speak they have enough money for 12 months the burn rate would increase dramatically to 125 mln per quater for 12 months.so either my math is totally wrong or theirs or their cash burn will not decrease or at least be stable as we hoped for it will increase quite dramatically over the next 12 months. This is probably the explanation why the stock doesn't rebound for the time being. If my math is correct and the results and updates come out positively, they will use the higher stock prices for another secondary or another convertible over the next 3 quarters unless there is a mega upfront payment for a licensing deal.as I mentioned before, I will use this weakness to start to write some 22 and 20 puts and wait to buy stock once the charts and momentum picture looks better. At least we seem to bottom out in the low 20ties. GLTAL"
Radius must post solid results and tighten their belt on expenses. Enough time has passed to build sales and support pipeline. EMA is now a “Boat Anchor” and am just about convinced higher forces are acting negatively because Radius threatens their turf.
Adding - just can't help myself.
Does anyone know what Form SC 13G/A is?
"What Radius needs to do is execute. Missing target estimates are not good. Saying we have the best in class product is not enough. EMA is pending, Patch is pending....Key is the patch. Rest is good, but more than 3-4 years away."
Stay strong - low volume - machines looking for weak hands to take your shares .
Is this a buy at 39.10?
So what to make of the results and any predictions for tomorrow? Any insights on conference call would be welcome.

what this company needs is a change in board of directors and the management team. after that the new management should find a buyer. with the pipeline it has this company should worth around 2.5 to 3B.
If this is more tax selling - these people won't be back in by the end of the year. They could miss the European Approval.
"Not a bad for RDUS, considering there was a slight sell off in the biotech sector. Recovered nicely from the morning lows and maybe a little consolidation before the next leg up higher, hopefully."
very nice result. Slowing taking majority of market share. Market is pricing too low.
Recent positive CHMP decision for Proliahttps://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/comment/positive-chmp-opinion-prolia-label-expansion-will-boost-sales/
Year end portfolio management (tax selling?); the price drop; the rate of the price drop. Short term pain but many green shoots. Don’t let go; sometimes the whole tide of the market will take you where you don’t think you should be. Good sales will reward your patience. Invest for the trend don’t think anyone can explain each individual days action.
Morgan Stanley initiated a buy rating for RDUS with a $43 price target.
"BB bought another 80K shares! At these prices, who can blame them?"
Meeting was Wednesday. Vote was Wednesday. Announcement will be Thursday.
"even though this news is not nice the reaction is muted. chart wise not a lot has changed as momentum indicators are holding up and flattening out, so no sell signal. MACD that was close to a buy signal has flattened out but is not negative. we seem to continue to be in a trading range of 32-40 for the time being. I have bought back the 1/3 I had sold a few days ago in the opening. so what is the most likely outcome. we have two possible scenarios, the one I favor and I mentioned before, a break of 42.5 will trigger a big inverse SHS formation with a price target of 50-55, the other is a possible double top, formed since January, with a NL at 31.5 that would lead to new lows with a target of 21-22. it is very important to be disciplined and take both scenarios into account. I am holding my trading position established at 32.5 with a stopp loss at 31 and will sell them towards the gap closing at 37. If we were to break 42.5 I will load up for a big move up. As mentioned before I do not like these markets and therefore continue to play small (3-5k stocks) in order not to lose a fortune if the stopp gets triggered. GLTAL"
"Do not be fooled with the after hours trades at $21.66, only volume of 50 shares at that price."
I’m thinking we should hear about the partnership for Elacestrant by now! I’m hoping the delay is because the partner is thinking of buying them. The company never gave a timeline for the partnership but they’ve been talking about it for a long time. I just have this feeling that something might happen soon. I hope
Nothing particularly noteworthy on the call aside from a little insight on revenue/earnings growth. 2nd half should see a pickup in earnings and achieving profitability. All R&D is on schedule as is global rollout of Tymlos. Likely another three months of skidding along.
"WE ARE STUCK, they way it looks like we seem to be stuck. momentum indicators flat like a pancake, we are in the middle of the Bollinger bands, no doji signal either. so my best guess is that we will continue in the range of 31.5-37, buy at lower band with tight stopp and sell towards the 36-37 level giving some 10-15% upside, the other strategy is to earn some premium and sell calls, but this makes the flexibility a little more awkward as you first need to unwind before selling. Happy Eastern or Passover"
"More insider buying, another 100k same buyer as last week"
"I sold a little a couple of days ago, of course it goes up. If I sold the who;e position it would rally 12 points"

"Only approval of patch is going to save this company. They need to put significant horse power behind it. They had been talking about the patch for very long time. Generic Forteo threat is real hence, they need hurry up."
1323 open interest $50 call options for March 16. Someone other than myself is extremely bullish! Viva RDUS!
"We are up 50% since November 14. Nice, steady climb. I think we close above $40 today and never look back. Its been a difficult slog, but the rewards are starting to roll in. Cheers!"
any thoughts on upcoming earnings report? I honestly don't know what to think.
Big news coming and CHMP approval!
$20 by Friday- book it.
