"Prescriptions rising nicely!Tymlos growth reflects access expansionAs we enter the new year, Tymlos is gaining formulary exclusivity from Express Scripts’commercial business, which represents approximately 11% of total lives. Accordingly, weclosely monitor Tymlos and Forteo scripts and note that Tymlos New to Brand (NBRx)scripts and total scripts (TRx) increased 43% and 25%, significantly outpacingcompetitor Forteo’s NBRx growth of 3% and TRx decrease of 18% while the overallanabolics market NBRx increased 12% and TRx decreased 15% in the week ending01/05/18. Of note, NBRx is the number of new patients coming onto a therapy class. Inour view, Tymlos’ NBRx trend could be a leading indicator for TRx and an effectivemeasure on patient acquisition. As of January 3, 2018, Tymlos had access toapproximately 214M covered lives compared to 268M lives for Forteo in the US.However, since its launch, Tymlos has steadily gained NBRx market share to 29% in theweek ending 01/05/08 (Chart 1). We see 50% Tymlos share of NBRx by end of 2018.For the week ending January 12, IMS reported 271 NRx and 496 TRx of Tymlos,representing 15% and 8% market share, respectively. We believe Tymlos’ upward scripttrends in January provide positive signals for its continued patient acquisitions throughswitches as well as expansion of the overall anabolics market (Chart 2). We maintain ourBuy rating on RDUS.Excerpt from ML report."
fast track status from the FDA on breast cancer drug in trial with positive early results is why rdus will go higher......
Any thoughts on whats fueling this recent rally? Seems to be backed by some nice volume. M&A chatter? Pipeline progress?Blowout Q1 Tymlos numbers? With some positive news about now this could bounce pretty nicely.
Sold 2/3 of my position at 21 and change. That was a great move! I'll ride out the other 1/3 and look to add more if it falls back down into the lower teens again.
almost back to even... been tough ride! Hope the price action continues onward and upward!
as the figures were more or less in line or a touch better i could buy back my stocks at the level i sold it yesterday. the feared disappointment did not happen and so I will follow again the charts that look constructive for the time being and hope for a rebound towards the 35.5-37.5 level
Radius Health is up 36.93% to 21.17
"Do not be fooled with the after hours trades at $21.66, only volume of 50 shares at that price."
BB biotech buying again and also an employee purchase. Fingers crossed.
Can anyone confirm?The Company plans to report its complete fourth quarter and audited full-year 2019 financial and operating results in February 2020.
I think RDUS held its own today considering. From what I read the earnings call will be at 8 am....I have bullish feelings on this time slot. 3 Months of s-scripts support could surprise. Thoughts?
bagholder here.. looks like all the bios are the same
Morgan Stanley revisited price target today 12/20/2018. They lowered target to $45. Plus recent Insider Buy. The stock hasn't been this low since September 2014. I'm willing to be patient.
The last two trading days have been good with increased volume; there’s not likely to be much movement in either direction until the earnings on Thursday 3/1. So fingers crossed and we’ll find out what they report and say for remainder of the year.
Is this a buy at 39.10?
"even though this news is not nice the reaction is muted. chart wise not a lot has changed as momentum indicators are holding up and flattening out, so no sell signal. MACD that was close to a buy signal has flattened out but is not negative. we seem to continue to be in a trading range of 32-40 for the time being. I have bought back the 1/3 I had sold a few days ago in the opening. so what is the most likely outcome. we have two possible scenarios, the one I favor and I mentioned before, a break of 42.5 will trigger a big inverse SHS formation with a price target of 50-55, the other is a possible double top, formed since January, with a NL at 31.5 that would lead to new lows with a target of 21-22. it is very important to be disciplined and take both scenarios into account. I am holding my trading position established at 32.5 with a stopp loss at 31 and will sell them towards the gap closing at 37. If we were to break 42.5 I will load up for a big move up. As mentioned before I do not like these markets and therefore continue to play small (3-5k stocks) in order not to lose a fortune if the stopp gets triggered. GLTAL"
Morgan Stanley reiterates Buy rating and $52 price target on Dec. 7th.
So Marco’s post from 6 days ago predicting that it would consolidate back to 36-37 area was right on the money.
Market cap is back down to 600 Million....thats a litle more than 2x Sales of Tymlos. Even with some valid criticisms of the company's size and overhead that is empiracly cheap especially considering new markets and drugs on the near horizon. Not a bad spot to pick up a trading position
"Something is brewing….. what is it, what is it?"
Will be back to $15 in no time...........
o great
very nice result. Slowing taking majority of market share. Market is pricing too low.
"New management might be on to something. 12.5 million they paid for RAD101 seems cheap to what JAZZ just paid for their new cannabidiol asset. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ) announced a $7.6 billion deal to acquire GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: GWPH), a British biotech company focused on drugs derived from cannabis. The unexpected news sent shares of GW Pharmaceuticals soaring 46%."
"i guess that some are very much biased here, the ""demotion"" of the VP for me rather hints that there might be issues or delays for the products the VP is responsible. at least this is what happens at other companies. combining this news with the price action and the momentum indicators i will continue to wait and put limits in in the low 32 scaled down and a stopp at 31"
"The Cup with Handle is a bullish continuation pattern that marks a consolidation period followed by a breakout. It was developed by William O'Neil and introduced in his 1988 book, How to Make Money in Stocks.As its name implies, there are two parts to the pattern: the cup and the handle. The cup forms after an advance and looks like a bowl or rounding bottom. As the cup is completed, a trading range develops on the right-hand side and the handle is formed. A subsequent breakout from the handle's trading range signals a continuation of the prior advance.If you look it up in a dictionary this RDUS 6 month chart shows up"
What is going on?
G - is spot on this is a good report. Sales ramping up more new things in pipe line. This is a hold. The China market scare pulled this down We will move up to $24 then $27 once market has China leveling off- unless someone just takes them out. New board member great add. Its a biotech it takes time but at least this is a very solid player with many products.
"On days like this, BB used to step in and make some nice purchases which would reverse the downtrend! I haven’t seen them add in a while which is really concerning"
I'm just wondering what sales numbers have to be in quarter for the stock to go positive.
"The legal counsel just bought 1,778 shares on Friday at $28.09"
"There was a large volume on Feb and March 40 calls today, any takeaway from that?"
sell the news
"Good morning things look quite a bit better. RSI flat and turning, macd still down but flattening. I would expect a retest of the resistance area 37.5-40 this week if the markets do what I mentioned on Friday. Will sell into strength and keep powder dry to either buy back lower or the before mentioned break at 40.4-42 that will trigger a inverse SHS formation with a potential target price of 55 this year"
"Have been watching rdus for a while. Here are my 2 cents as potential investor without being emotionally attached long. Good company but stock at this point is not honestly worth $1.7B. Burning about $55m per they are literally 2 years away from being profitable, at least. Tymlos uptake should increase but they would be lucky to make $40m net in 2018 which is still crazy rich 40x earnings valuation. New Investors should honestly stay on sidelines monitoring Tymlos sales which is the main revenue driver. Rest of the pipeline in early stages. And when comparing rdus to other biotech peers there are definitely way better plays with similar valuation, profitable and making $170-300m per year. Cort and Supn are such examples"
I’m waiting for the Patch read out…..
Wow- just wow with this company
I start a position on pull back. Looking forward to ER and wearABLe readout. LG.
What happened here? Any news as this is a big drop in the first few minuets...
with this news could be bought out $40
what this company needs is a change in board of directors and the management team. after that the new management should find a buyer. with the pipeline it has this company should worth around 2.5 to 3B.
"So I bought this early at 21.50 and I was able to leave at 22.27 for a little over 700 bucks profit. The market can be dumb. I am usually short on biotech because they all have huge market cap and little sales based on some hope they will find a miraculous drug. But RDUS and AVIR seem like a long to me. Low market cap compared to current sales. And they also offer that hail Mary of a miraculous drug. For now, I am flat on both, but seriously considering taking a LT position."
"Pretty unbelievable that there is no buzz anywhere / here / twitter, etc. on the initiation of the Tymlos wearable patch phase 3 trials.Am I the only one seeing that this happened yesterday? Not sure why they announced 2 days before earnings... Will listen to podcast and see if I can learn anything."
bought another 200 shares today while its under 26. I'll probably dump those around the $29 level just for a quick profit. Still sitting on my big position waiting a break through 40
no wonder why this company dropping likes a rock. check out the review from from its employees https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Radius-Health-Reviews-E1375769.htm
Bought small this morning at 33.5

So what to make of the results and any predictions for tomorrow? Any insights on conference call would be welcome.
If I’m not mistaking it looks like BB bio picked ip another 50K shares late Friday? So that was 50k on the 25th and 50K on the 27th? I see it on some website but not others. Hopefully not spreading fake news.
Today's phase-3 topline makes RDUS is a buyout candidate !! Heavily undervalued here. IMO
This is a prime buyout candidate. Looking for at least $50
MPM has issued a 13D.Has sold its entire position. Any thoughts?
What a sad company! All the good news and they’re under $20
There is nothing wrong. New management does not want to over promise. Everything on track. Its a buy. Stock should be at $36. Stay strong and long.
8000% volume and going down? Nice joke Break 30 eod
"THE CHARTS LOOK GREEN..................BUT...............I am selling out here before the figures even though the charts look promising. macd is just giving a buy signal, RSI has momentum and we closed above the 31.5-32 level that was important to abolish the negative chart pattern.so why do I sell out with a minimal profit, I just don't trust the management that they can control costs and the last 8 quarters were always worse than expected and disappointed and therefore I follow my gut and not the charts.I first want to see that the new management establishes a positive track on figures and cost control. In my view this is the issue holding the stock back and I also disagree with Trey, having running costs of 70 mln a quater and minimal sales will raise the question of cash at hand within the next 12 months, unless they can strike a deal and the partner is going to take on some of the costs or pays a big upfront payment.so will see tomorrow, normally I follow charts but right now I will follow my gut"
I just emailed investor relations asking about the silence and more specifically about an update regarding Elacestrant. Will keep you all updated once I hear anything
"That was some nice action yesterday. Lets hope it follows on to today. Would love to see a break through $38 with good, steady volume."
"5 firms filed SC 13G/A forms yesterday....Point 72, Consonance Capital Management, T Rowe Price, Tourbillon Capital Partners & State Street Corp.....Anyone have any insight or comment on this action?"
"yesterdays price action was not that nice, initially we had a dark cloud cover and settled for a hanging man. Both chart patterns are not the best as they show increased volatility after a strong run up. momentum is starting to weaken but no sell signal yet. as we have hit the 200 ma and entered the first resistance at around 36.5 to 37.5 on the way to the 4 handle it is most likely that we sill see a consolidation - we might see a consolidation to the 32.5 to 33.5 level meaning a 10 % correction. for people who bought the break at 33 I would sell these, keep core and try to buy them back lower - it feels a little heavy here"
Bob Ward was in for the quick buck......................
Looks like the algos got a hold of the stock in early trading before the humans settled the price down. Glad I sold in the first hour of trading. Still good news for the company. Historically RDUS get a little pop right after earnings and then sells off. I'll be looking for similar behavior after this earnings call and pick an entery point somewhere below $15.
"Averaging up, buy pattern confirmed, first target 21.83, then 24-24.5"
"SOMETHING IN THE BUSHI believe there is a big move coming within the next 3 months as we have built a huge 18 month triangle, a break of this will be very decisive and we will see either a move to 20 or 40, as MACD is close to a buy on the 2 year chart, I would give slightly higher odds to a break on the upside - I will however wait for the break to happen before getting in againGLTAL"
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
RDUS Goldman Sachs Upgrades stock to Strong Buy w 33$ Price Target
It has got very quiet with the board and the volume
"Just because we received FDA approval, doesn’t mean EMA CHMP approval was “likely”. For example, look at Keytruda. The further we were delayed and the more CHMP extensions we received, we kind of knew. The good news is, the market is pricing this in, the European market isn’t that important."
well I hope the downtrend ends soon... earnings is coming. I need it to be decent for me to want to stay full in.
"""$RDUS Expected to be on the CHMP Agenda of December 9th for Tymlos approval in EU."""
"Just add more. The stock is breaking out. STO @82, RSI @65 and moving up.Will be $25 in a month or 2."
"Is RDUS now in resistance area around $33+ and can go either way? To break the resistance, we would need a strong up volume day or If the volume stays low, it can easily be pushed back to $30. Any thoughts?"
This is trading like we'll have bad news tomorrow.
Radius Health (NASDAQ:RDUS): Q2 Non-GAAP EPS of -$0.55 beats by $0.21; GAAP EPS of -$0.77 beats by $0.10.Revenue of $41M (+81.2% Y/Y) beats by $0.4M
Nice move today!! I hope continues next week.
It would be nice to know the timing of this ChMP thing! RDUS resubmitted for them to look it over again but there’s no mention of timing. Does anyone know anything on this matter?
1323 open interest $50 call options for March 16. Someone other than myself is extremely bullish! Viva RDUS!
"There’s barely any options activity for the next 3 months, especially the call options. It probably means not much movement in either direction, but it’s already devastating the last two weeks."
Come on Radius. Get the data and catalysts out already.
sold out rest at gap close of 37.11 no flat
"good morning everyone. I lost money on AMD and SQUARE. Now, I want to put all my money in Rdus. Anyone can advice me. the reasons I put all in. Because, I trust BB, insider, good stock, cheap price and potential to moves up. I have 1100 shares. I will buy 900 shares more at open market. Thank you."
any thoughts on upcoming earnings report? I honestly don't know what to think.
Nothing particularly noteworthy on the call aside from a little insight on revenue/earnings growth. 2nd half should see a pickup in earnings and achieving profitability. All R&D is on schedule as is global rollout of Tymlos. Likely another three months of skidding along.
"Point72, or Stevie Cohen's hedge fund, just announced a 5.1% stake in RDUS, probably explains the bounce afterhours."
"So what do you guys make of the report? I quickly glanced through it and the revenue is slightly above estimates, the loss was pretty much in line."
A little pull back short term then resume the trend up. Buy the dips
Multi billion dollar potential. $$$
27.6 million in sales / 22% increase from last quarter / pretty healthy Medicare numbers and Tymlos sales projections for 19

"For almost 3 days, RDUS is stuck in this very narrow range on declining volume. I’m worried that if it doesn’t move up from here, it could be pushed down on low volume."
This should be OVER 50% with this great news. MMs keeping this down to Accumulate. Buncha Kruks...... This should Pop any minute.... Predicting $20+ Close
Morgan Stanley initiated a buy rating for RDUS with a $43 price target.
Without trying to sound like a cheerleader I'll say it does seem like we are finally turning a corner execution wise with the company fundamentals: Tymlos international expansion into Japan and promising outlook for EU. Patch trial on the verge of submission to FDA. More broad range of treatment for these drugs...and then the partnerships with the oncology stuff. 2021 is looking like the year this thing turns a profit and actually begins to build financial standing.
"what has changed since 20181. stock is in a long term uptrend and has an open gap at 25-272. stock is oversold and has built positive divergencies on a 5 year chart3. Trey has not learned anything in live and still believes to be the oracle of Delphi and having the right to abuse people4. Strategie: start to go long on weak days, use option strategy to go in, sell 17.5 July put for 2.5, buy 20 July call at 3.5 for a net debit of 15. we might continue so see a bit of a bumpy ride for the time being but risk reward seems to be positive around this level for the next 6-12 months6. don't be greedy, start small and once the trend goes into your direction add to your position, first target 25-27"
Late start on presentation?
Radius Health is up 5.83% to 15.98
I have secured the financing and will take this company private at $50.
"The Phase-3 breast cancer drug news is fantastic. Also, I believe abaloparatide-SC, which is in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of osteoporosis in men was successful and they will file NDA on or before Q1 2022. 2022 current revenue forecast is 50% increase over 2021 revenue and net ESP somewhere between $0.70 - $1 per share. Looks extremely undervalued here."
"If this moves passed $20 this week, everyone should look to add more.Chart looks pretty good so far. MACD > 0. RSI @ 62.5 and should hit above 70 if we hold trend."
"Great buying opportunity today, completely oversold. No negative news. Solid Q3 earnings. The news about Elacestrant future partnership wasn’t taken well, but doesn’t justify a share price move from 30 to 21. Nor does Evenity approval in EU.We should see continued revenue growth in Q4, along with solid 2020 revenue guidance. We should see 2020 full year sales somewhere around 250-300 million or more. Current market cap of RDUS is $972 million..."
@James.....what's the deal?
pricing in good news AND when the numbers come in on tymlos then perhaps price targets get taken higher.....not to forget elacetrant for breast cancer which is on fast track with the FDA....lots to celebrate!!
Citigroup upgrades to buy! Price target is $40
ok now i agree this is too much went in at 32.5 which was my first target
No real catalyst to move share price until next quarters results.
"Volume is up 12,000% at noonAnd price is dropping?"

Is this Shorts causing this dip today?
BB picked another 50K shares. No faith lost over there.
anybody out there????
Keep on going please…..
Adding - just can't help myself.
"so on march 1st we ill know more, we are on the verge to get a buy signal in macd as i mentioned before. if this buy signal were to come with a break above 41 this would be super bullish and the shorts will have to cover. I am flat as i said before, i first want to see the prove of the pudding as we are approaching resistance in the 40-41 area, i just do not trust this market."
"Some relief to see today’s price action after what seems like an eternity. I would like to see volume pick up and it holds $30 plus by closing and, hopefully this momentum continues in coming days."
An upgrade by Goldman Sachs from neutral to buy and price target raised from $26 to $38. There’s some premarket activity on low volume so far; it could’ve been a better day but negative market sentiment will spoil it.
News has to be coming. I’m thinking partnership or buyout. Just a guess
Just my opinion - I think the price is going to be stuck until investors can be assured Tymlos will make more money than it costs to market and distribute. Nobody wants another share dilution. They need to get to about $60 million in quarterly sales. Q1 will give us a good glance.
"No correlation to RDUS, but EMA CHMP gave a negative opinion for PBYI, when the FDA approved? To be clear, Tymlos is a good product/drug, but just for a point of reference"
"Thank you for the upgrade sold half my position at 36.5 as i still believe we are range bound for the time being, happy Eastern and Passover"
30 here we come!
"Another reason the share price keeps going down is the insiders trading, so far I haven't seen any employee buying at this low price which only means one thing to the investors that they don't have confidence in the company either"
Why they stopped?
I have 1600 shares of RDUS. I want to sell 800 shares because I am scare about CHMP in EUROPE next week.
"And just like that, I have become a long term investor on RDUS..."
"More insider buying, another 100k same buyer as last week"
buy it now. you will win this afternoon.
"Charts start to look a little more encouraging. After the sell off we can see a flattening out of momentum indicators and some of them have turned slightly more positive. I would expect the stock to slowly head higher over the next 5-10 days into the 35-36 level and try to close the opening gap we had last week. we do not have a buy signal yet, but if i had to bet i think we have better chances for the stock to make a 10% move up than down, however a lot will depend as mentioned how the markets will do."
"With price this low, BB Biotech needs to step up and take this company private. Since the new CEO took over from Ward, it has been a disaster for shareholders."
"I apologize. I just found out RDUS is entitled to only $320 millions from Menarini Group. So there would be no issuance of stocks which is good, but RDUS stock price will be dependant on its own Tymlos sales. So wait till its earnings report."
"As long as they don't dilute the stocks, around $18 should be a good entry point. Just wait till AH to see if there're issuing stocks. I think they should utilize the opportunity though. And if they do, it will only create very short term impact on the price and would create better entry points."
Yesterday was volatile. today more stable uptrend. going to $30 next week.
"this move today doesn't make sense at all. Might be option expiry but there are only a few hundred 35 calls open interest, so it might be an OTC transaction weighing on stock.put my tow in the water for a few shares below 34, but kept 3/4 of the money dry if we were to reach the next support levels."
"Although I shouldn’t have bought more but I’m so stubborn and don’t want to give up, so I just bought 900 shares at $22.45."
Huge news 30 eod.
I am in LT. 18.70. 300M+ in revenues and 900M market cap. That's a no brainer. Especially with positive results on phase 3 tests for breast cancer drug.
I’m toast if this doesn’t go up like $10 tomorrow. And that would only be recovering about a month’s losses.
ABFT we have a decent day after a good earnings report IMHO
"An approved, effective product in US, a trial that met endpoints in Japan and coming approval for a treatment for both men and women, what’s not to like. Shot up a buck today, just setting up for buyout"
Finally showing a respectable move up with increasing volume.
"small update before year end. charts still look encouraging and after having closed the gap we never traded below 27 again and ticked slowly up with little volume. the early divergences we had seen 2 weeks ago have not been confirmed and the sky seems to be blue for the time being, as mentioned before we will enter resistance in the 32.5-33.5 area. this is pretty crucial as a break of this level would confirm a bullish reverse pattern with a target of 40.5-41 where the next resistance lies. as mentioned before the chart patterns look rather good for 2018 and I would continue to expect a move towards the 40 level within the next 6 months. stay long but wait to add either below 27 or with a break of the 33.5-34 level with a target of 40ish. HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS 2018 TO EVERY BODY"

don't expect tymlos will have blockbuster sales. pricing & competition is though there
"I put in a ticket to sell at $60 why let them use my shares to short. Never thought we would go this low. Not selling. Will add a little. Shorts will pay, its a matter of time."
 Top Trades Ideas For October 2021 >> https://chart-analysis.tools/top-trade-idea
Finally phase 3 of Elacestrant has been initiated and Rad140 phase I dose escalation is still ongoing. This update along with some presentations at SABCS is good to see and should help the price of the stock for the near future in my opinion.
"There is no way for us retailers to know what the hedges know. So you try to take what risk you can out of your investments. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. Anything under $30 is a gift to be put away until next Christmas if you ask me. But that is just my opinion, nothing more and nothing less. I like to see the big C buying a large stake (large in my book) and BB keeps buying so I feel OK buying here as well. Down a bunch but lowering my avg. price down here. Guess we all will see in a few quarters!"
Radius Health is up 7.46% to 21.60
wow...
"@Milad Atallah ""Looks like B.B. Purchased another 60k shares for $29.27 as well! Hopefully it will go up from here. Not sure what these guys know but they keep buying.""Yes, I saw this as well. A bit mysterious that they have added so much and at a far higher price than at present. Gives me some comfort but not as much as a higher share price!I do think that there is a real possibility that one day, in the not too distant future, we might be in for a nice surprise."
Fair value $50+ IMO
why are you selling at this price??
"The company needs to show the value of its assets! I recall Bon Ward during one of his cc’s stating that Tymlos alone is worth 1.5 billion alone. Therefore, the remainder of three pipeline is not valued. If Rad1901 continues to show good data with good safety, it should be worth more then 1 billion. The company is at 1.3 billion dollars currently at just over $28 dollars. The company needs to hammer this at their next conference call!"
Any thoughts Marco?
New guy took options deal at current stock price. He is top notch and must know good things ahead or would have walked. The need for take-overs is starting to be thrown out by the media and RDUS is so undervalued. Stay strong.
what is this we are going up!
Good joke
