"Equity Bank Vs Inherited Bank. There is no greater distinction between two companies. One is managing with a plan, the other is managing an estate."
CEO should take responsibility for over selling shares. Goldman is doing fine. CFFN resembles Wells Fargo. Why?

"“Stakeholder capitalism is used as a way to obfuscate what counts as success in business. By focusing less on profits and more on vague social values, “enlightened” executives will find it easier to avoid accountability even as they squander business resources.”"
Market down cffn down. Market up cffn down. There is no upside. Only reliable forecast is horrible sycophant management with no value to shareholders.

Market has erased Covid decline-CFFN erased all market doubt about management quality.
I never think of the future. It comes soon enough. http://dataunion.tistory.com/10405 To act as one thinks is the most difficult of all.
Dicus decline underway! Interest rate margin debacle.

The Bubb Light Circle at Washburn University is a big embarrassment. It needs to be removed for the same reason Jefferson and Franklin was removed!
Hello there. The markets are shaky right now and a crash could be imminent. Do you know where to put your cash? Learn now at https://winningstockalertsonline.blogspot.in/ .
CFFN's 15% equity (1.368 billion) to asset (9.2 billion) ratio is higher than the 10% ratio of most banks. They've been choosing to bring it down by returning equity to shareholders in the form of true blue dividends twice a year for the last 16 years in addition to their quarterly dividends. .448 billion dollars of equity could still be distributed which is enough to keep these dividends coming for the next 18 years (maybe even longer if the Trump tax cut results in increased earnings and a good economy). Total dividends per year is about 7% at the current share price and it may increase if they continue the same course. Where can you get that kind of return and still be in an investment that is low risk? A PERPETUAL MONEY MACHINE.
Jackson recovery!
New Director is management insider. Will be up CEO’s but and not a voice for outside shareholders. Lower prices ahead. Too bad. Expanding board to fortify CEO is so predictable of scared CEO.

Dicus failure
The upside potential for CFFN just got a whole lot more interesting. Do you guys find it difficult to know when to buy or sell something? I prefer to get my stocks from awesom-eSTOCKS.
Dividends have been around 8% per year because of CFFN's special dividend policy. Yahoo ignores this and reports only 3% for the last 16 years. Why?? Is the stock price intentionally being held down with false information???
CFFN down. Moving in right direction.
The turd rose to the top of the bowl and is slowly sinking back down to the bottom.
"CFFN is still over priced. Stock buy back didn’t work since a massive number of shares have been issued to insiders. Thus, shares price needs to drop to the $9 range. Yield is not guaranteed like a bond. Management has shown intent to not grow the company, thus there is significant risk."
"The CEO is the son and grandson of long time board members. Sort of like Jerry Falwell, Jr., DNA can be risky to bet a company on."
Failure on display
Dicus is such a failure. Nothing like his grandfather.

Did you buy CFFN to increase your wealth over time? Cash distributions used for retirement? Lol Vanguard stock index fund has out performed. This company only went public to line its CEO pocket. As a mutual there was no hope of pocketing the company. Happy investing! Lol
Is white privilege defined as inheriting the ceo job of a publicly held company from a grandfather to father to son?
This stock moves inversely with rates. Acts like a bond.
"No one cares about this company. But, I love it. As it goes down it become more likely to right size the yield, as this is just a bond."

"Today we had the over-all market hit a new high with many high flying stocks hitting new highs, and many value stocks like banks also finally starting to break out from low bases.What a time to be alive and trade where you could make and lose fortunes each day if you bet the right way or wrong way on the big bubbles names, ok maybe some are not bubbles. But ones like MSFT, NFLX, BYND, and CHWY are bubbles, overvalued by any reasonable metric. Even with NFLX big collapse this week, where are the earnings? People say Netflix is the best and the first mover, so it deserves the valuation. Shows like Stranger Things are it’s best shows. First, the show is a bunch of kids, running around in the basement could not be much to produce, yet the volume goes up and down as I made it in my basement, this is not a company I want to be involved. If you are going to do something, do it well, and right, they have the money. They also just had a movie with Jennifer Aniston, the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. God knows what that cost them to make at least the volume worked on that one. Also the noise they do at the beginning of each show, again sounds like a child made it and it very annoying.Anyway, what I am saying if you own any of these stocks and are not taking profits don’t say I didn't warn you.Sell all these names in stages starting Monday over the next 1-3 months if the market goes up another 5-10% which seems like it wants to you will make more in value names going forward with way less risk. I would start on Monday morning.First, many small banks are merging or selling; there were three more deals this past week, one in NY, one in CA and one in NC, they are occurring across the USA. These are safe places to be if the market gets hits if you own the right names at the correct prices, of course. Buffett owns a lot of banks and would hold the small ones if he could, trust me.But back to the names we like with low downside risk first and foremost is Oppenheimer ( OPY $29).Friday they announced their best quarter in a decade. They announced another 5% stock buyback plus 1% left on the old buyback, which they will do starting this week, very aggressively I feel, since the stock is still under tangible book value. Second, they are paying back 25% of their outstanding debt in one shot next month, years ahead of schedule. These will both add a bunch to earnings growth going forward at these levels. Third, they probably will pay down another 25% of the debt by the end of the year, saving even more money. Fourth, earnings are growing and growing as the market goes up and up they make more and more money each quarter. Fifth, their CEO is another year older and ready to retire to his estate; he has worked a long hard career. OPY probably was within a few days of going under just over a decade ago, in the crash, BUD is smart and prudent he will not let this opportunity slip away. People are paying top dollar today for these kinds of firms, and OPY is worth at least 65% more than it is trading at today and maybe 100% more. The downside is so limited unless we get a crash. Just the fact that his comments the past few years have been so positive for this man is a huge statement in itself. He is a safe and prudent man and to say, “ The future looks bright” is a statement for any CEO, let alone him.The last thing BUD said in the latest quarter yesterday was this. “ Our reduced leverage and continued high level of liquidity will be advantageous as we look to expand our business.”If he was looking to expand why would he pay down debt, he is selling the firm this summer the writing is on the wall. Why would he let go 5% of the stake this year, the most significant cut in a while?They also just finished all the ARS Securities after ten years this month that is a huge monkey of there back also. The regulators were on their backs and all firms like them the past ten years; this is 99% done now and the most important thing that has happened for these type of firms the in recent two years. They can now make money again.With them repurchasing over 800,000 shares in the open market the next six months, as I think they will do, this will create a floor on the stock and with the real float probably as low as 3-4 million shares. That’s 25% of the float as I see it. Once they pay that debt down next month and if they do that amount again at the end of the year it is really like buying back one-third of their stock in six months enough said read that twice, please. If they didn't pay down the debt, they could have repurchased 31% of the stock by years end to be precise. “BUDs” significant stake in the firm over 26%, several big hedge funds that won’t sell and many long-time employees that won’t sell that own a good amount each also, this stock could easily trade to $35- $40 next month on fundamentals and $50 plus in a sale. They will make well over $4.00 a share in 2019 and $5.00 plus in 2020, that’s a P/E of 6 today"
Down down down Good news for dividend yield. At CFFN less is more.
Wow this looks like the ultimate dead money stock.
CFFN is up 7.41% to 11.88
Dividends under attack from fed? Happy Juneteenth!
Bank purchase referendum on full display.
"8.5 cent dividend, market declares it a dumbedend. You can bet management is having a great time with no care at all about stuckholders."
"Is CFFN over valued? Do the math. With no prospects for growth and no hope for quality management, there is no case to view this stock as any thing but a turd."
"$20,000,000 gift to hugely white KU business school would have provided $10,000 downpayment assistance to 2,000 black families in Topeka."
Down 8% since beginning of year.
"Berkshire Hathaway-“ In selecting a new director, we were guided by our long-standing criteria, which are that board mem-bers be owner-oriented, busi-ness-savvy, inter-ested and truly independent. . . .CFFN Directors are apparently selected for their loyalty to the CEO and Chair."
So sad stock is tanking.
Stock is taking a Dicus bounce.
"The thrift made a bank acquisition. Unfortunately, they also pledged not to grow. This is a very odd premise. I suppose CFFN liked the logo. The bank has a 50% reduction in income tax, yet only squeezes 1 cent per share. The acquisition does not boost stock price. Management is a reliable fail."
Get the best before they run. Just search for
Going to 5 baby! Price is trying to reflect value of management.
CFFN is down 6.06% to 10.07
"I have to say that even with the earning miss, the expanded business should help the share price and the total dividend go up if they continue with the conservative (read low risk) approach continues. As I read it, I see this last 12 months as a 0.98 dividend on a ~12 dollar share price which looks like a 8+% dividend if it continues into next year. If it continues with the 0.39 dollar specials twice a year you are looking at 9.3%, assuming little growth on capital. Where else are you going to find that?"

A bad company to work for or own. That's all you need to know. Disclosure: Never worked for them.
CapFed Best News. Henry Bubb legacy is enduring.
Jackson Rally!!
Dicus decline is amazing. Capfed is very sensitive to China.
CapFed best news. Stock now reflects management quality.
"Toilet time, baby!"
The market roars and CFFN disappoints.

Capitol Federal shares have dropped nearly 6 percent since the beginning of the year.
$9 a share stock. This company goes nowhere until Jackson is CEO and Chair.
Ricketts is BLM member of board. Still an insider that is likely not in best interests of non management shareholders. Too bad.
Turding continues
Thanks Yahoo for putting most recent messages with the truth at the top where they belong. Now if you would flush the Turds down the can so the smell of his fake news goes away that would be another improvement on this board and give CFFN the press it deserves for it's consistently high dividend.
Love this stock!
"For those who are complaining about the ups and downs of CFFN, Sell...Your comments are getting a bit boring. Go somewhere else. Thank you so much"
Very disappointing earnings.
Management appears to be over valued.
"Lower interest rates and reduction in payroll are a winning combination for CFFN. Employees are a shareholder’s parasite. Grow margins, not payroll."
Movin to 9! Leading from behind. I am the only poster because I am the only shareholder that can write!
Dicus bounce alert!
This stock is such a turd.
Don’t you wish you bought Apple?
CFFN is up 5.30% to 10.73
Down over 3%. Did a large investor meet management?
Dicus bottom?
Turdung in progress. So easily predictable. A $9 stock since it was issued.
Turding territory.
Time to restructure. Again....
CFFN is down 5.69% to 11.27
3 million more mouths to feed.
CFFN is horribly run - time is running out for this one
Yeah! Stock is right sizing!
Going down!
Apple: 4:1 stock splitCFFN: just split! Really! Dump this turdung!
Why is it falling? It’s a vote of no confidence in management.
I am really glad that I found (http://sharelabs.xyz) - they just sent an alrt that is up like 77% in a week. Good stuff!

"Once again cffn management has kept it's promise of returning equity to shareholders, despite the crying of some over lack of company growth, by giving a ""ridiculous"" dividend of 98 cents- that's 7.8% for the year and not 2.7% as reported by Yahoo. And it raises the 16 year average of 91 cents. There's 39 cents available to shareholders on record by November 16 and share price is low. Do the math- that's over 3% dividend right there alone on Friday's closing share price."
"Going to $8 baby!! Calling from the wilderness, the prophet heralds the failure of weak sycophant management."
Turdriffic!
S&P record high! Poor stuckholders of CFFN.
CFFN reached a 52 Week low at 11.38
When will growth be a company virtue?
"91 cent dividend seems kind of ridiculous. What is the purpose of this company? Based on inflation, the company is the same size now as it was in 1987, when you remove the borrowing. No growth in over 30 years. Why has this company failed to grow in over a generation? There is something very odd about this."
Over value alert!! CFFN has not bought their own stock since it went over $12. Even this moronic management and board knows it’s over valued!! Have a turd day.
Capitol Federal Financial reached a 52 Week low at 9.07
Looks like the bank was overpriced by about half a million in bad loans. Wonder if there is more? Due diligence adequate at acquisition?
True Blue dividend or lack of dividends gives the blues.
Feel the BURN!
CFFN is down 5.53% to 10.94
$9.98 today!! Go CFFN. Down is dirty!
Got to love the acquisition!
Capitol Federal Financial reached a 52 Week low at 10.55
Welcome to CFFN. Enjoy the ride. Weak management. Complacent Board. Any company that pays out 100% of its earnings has decided the future is not for them.
A nice run up.
CFFN reached a 52 Week low at 10.55
"This turdung has a problem. Costs. Too many employees, and yes interest margins declining. Giving away money is s poor business plan. Maybe Henry can be resurrected to help. Look at this company carefully and consider the three musketeers track record for shareholder value."
I wonder if the bank purchase will finally contribute to EPS. We will know soon if the issuance of 3 million shares of stock was a good management decision.
"Rich tax returns released. 1000’s. We will soon see Dicus’?Time to tax wealth. If mutual companies can be taken over by the rich, it is time for the rich to pay."
Going to $9 today? Going down is what Dicus does best. Good news!
A turn toward the Dicus side.
It's like the market doesn't know this stock will pay around 7% dividend.
Earnings were disappointing.
