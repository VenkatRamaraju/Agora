"8.5 cent dividend, market declares it a dumbedend. You can bet management is having a great time with no care at all about stuckholders."
Capitol Federal shares have dropped nearly 6 percent since the beginning of the year.
"With a 91 cent yearly average dividend for the last 16 years and the 40% tax cut, I expect about a 9% dividend at this price."
True Blue dividend or lack of dividends gives the blues.
$9 a share stock. This company goes nowhere until Jackson is CEO and Chair.
"CFFN is still over priced. Stock buy back didn’t work since a massive number of shares have been issued to insiders. Thus, shares price needs to drop to the $9 range. Yield is not guaranteed like a bond. Management has shown intent to not grow the company, thus there is significant risk."
Market has erased Covid decline-CFFN erased all market doubt about management quality.
Why does Yahoo let old and negative slams about CFFN stay at the top and put recent positive comments down the list where they won't be read???
CapFed Best News. Henry Bubb legacy is enduring.
"The thrift made a bank acquisition. Unfortunately, they also pledged not to grow. This is a very odd premise. I suppose CFFN liked the logo. The bank has a 50% reduction in income tax, yet only squeezes 1 cent per share. The acquisition does not boost stock price. Management is a reliable fail."
"Equity Bank Vs Inherited Bank. There is no greater distinction between two companies. One is managing with a plan, the other is managing an estate."
"Berkshire Hathaway-“ In selecting a new director, we were guided by our long-standing criteria, which are that board mem-bers be owner-oriented, busi-ness-savvy, inter-ested and truly independent. . . .CFFN Directors are apparently selected for their loyalty to the CEO and Chair."
CFFN reached a new 52 Week Low at 12.52
I wonder if the bank purchase will finally contribute to EPS. We will know soon if the issuance of 3 million shares of stock was a good management decision.
New Director is management insider. Will be up CEO’s but and not a voice for outside shareholders. Lower prices ahead. Too bad. Expanding board to fortify CEO is so predictable of scared CEO.
CapFed best news. Stock now reflects management quality.
Capitol Federal Financial reached a 52 Week low at 11.38
Earnings were disappointing.

Stock price back to conversion price. Lol
