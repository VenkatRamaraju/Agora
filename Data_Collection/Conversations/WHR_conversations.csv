I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
Load up we have a Great dividend and the short interest and 9.6 days to cover will push WHR alot higher than you think tomorrowGREAT EARNINGSGREAT GUIDANCE
Here is a company (WHR) that earned over $4.00 per share in the last 4 quarters than (CMG) did in the same 4 quarters and look where both stocks are trading? did the (Advisory Fee Group ) go to a different class about these shares?
"Unusual Options Alert (WHR) $225.00 Call At The Ask Exp Date October 29, 2021 Open Interest 23,056 Bullish Sentiment"
$WHR Target Lowered by Bank of America Neutral USD 250 » USD 240Downgrades RBC Capital Underperform USD 208 » USD 190
WHR current PE is 7. The 5 average PE is 15. The average PE of the S and P 500 is 22.
"best time to buy, next week with the dividend coming WHR will only be going up! GREAT EARNINGS WOOHHOOO"
$180's next week. Supply chain issues and loss of revenue will take its' toll. Forward looking market. $120-$150 by EOY.

"Strange, I thought $7.51 eps was a pretty good number. You know it would only take 7 years of earnings to buy the entire float at this price..."
Strong Quarter! and the price was already pulled back prior to the quarter and we have a dividend!

Great earnings and bought an additional 500 shares just now and will buy an additional 1000 shares tomorrow at open
The appliance industry can't get much more condensed. It's a lot like the lumber/paper product industry was several years ago. PE multiples kept compressing into single digits at which time Georgia-Pacific was bought out by venture capitalist. I see Warren Buffet and Berkshire Hathaway buying out Whirlpool if it gets and further price compression.
"AMAZING!!!!2021-10-21 20:05:00 GMT Press Release: Whirlpool Announces Increased Long-Term Value Creation Goals on the Back of Continued Record Performance and Delivers Very Strong Third-Quarter ResultsWhirlpool Announces Increased Long-Term Value Creation Goals on the Back of Continued Record Performance and Delivers Very Strong Third-Quarter Results-- Announcing increased long-term value creation goals-- Third-quarter net sales growth of 4%, driven by cost-based pricing initiatives and a continued strong consumer demand environment-- Strong GAAP net earnings margin of 8.6% (up 120 bps) and very strong ongoing (non-GAAP) EBIT margin(2) of 11.1% (down 80 bps), largely offsetting 650 bps of raw material inflation-- Cash provided by operating activities improved by $887 million driven by strong earnings; adjusted free cash flow(4) improved by $1,126 million driven by strong earnings and positively impacted by the divestitures of Whirlpool China(6) and Turkey subsidiary-- Repurchased $441 million of shares in the quarter"
Not a lot of buying right now don't let the shorts worry you. tomorrow when the market opens you will see everyone jump on this price shorts just gave us. Investors want that dividend
"When the (Advisory Fee Group) aka market rigging & manipulators decides to squeeze you out of any position and of any stock that's listed in the market there is no stopping them, welcome to American Greed, home of the stock market rigging & manipulators, Bam."
Bought 2000 shares at 200.00 and expect WHR to ride over 220.00 tomorrow
I'll buy every company that you can send me that has a PE of 7 and a 2 point 7 percent dividend yield. LOVING this....CHEERS!!!
