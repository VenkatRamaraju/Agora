The loss was worse than the analyst estimate of a $0.03 loss per share in a Capital IQ poll.Revenue grew 33.3% to $93.4 million from a year ago, compared with the $94.0 million consensus estimate.For full year 2021, the company reiterated its guidance, projecting revenue to surpass $430 million and adjusted EBITDA to exceed $61.0 million, against the Street consensus of $432.3 million for revenue.Price: 177.00, Change: -7.00, Percent Change: -3.80how and who kept this #$%$ pumped up for so long ?it was obvious that they would miss againeven if they didn't miss they aren't worth 1/10th of their price"
FRPT reached a new All Time High at $38.76
"I agree, I think 32.00. - 33.00 will be a good level to add more."
how long before internet sales close all the brick and mortar pet stores and thus sell their fresh pet refrigerators ?

"I saw a commercial for fresh pet last night. What kind of dog or nutcase cat owner, would put animal food in their refrigerator? i mean really. reminds me of those nutcase people that put their animals in their shopping carts at walmart."
This stock is an example of why people don't play individual names as much anymore.Every quarter results and estimates are missed and lowered and the stock skyrockets. The previous quarter was a disaster and the stock went up almost 50%. Another pathetic quarter just reported and up we go. Computers are now making most trades and none of them seem to be trading on logic or results. God help FRPT if they actually start making money. The stock will probably tank.
FRPT is down 5.39% to 70.01
Nice upward move the last couple of days.
617 times earnings. Cheers.
"valuation seems stretched. would guess a downward move after earnings report... but I never really know, so we will see."
inflation will cause people to eat their dogs food and feed Rover old Roy's from wall mart ...
"Spoiler alert!If you bought Freshpet because you are looking forward to a buyout, in my opinion that ship has already sailed.On March 17, 2009 Tyson Foods took a stake in Freshpet. After that point, they helped market Freshpet and werelikely responsible in getting the Freshpet refrigerators in so many key retailers. Tyson Foods also was involved in the $100 M IPO. It seems to me that it would be illogical for Tyson Foods to allow another food company, or any otherentity, to acquire Freshpet as they would be at risk of losing a major customer that consumes millions of pounds of meat.

Recent market selloff has brought FRPT down to a mere 133 times earnings. Just sayin'.
Stock has skyrocketed over 100 dollars per share price this year. Earnings again were horrible this quarter and it is again upgraded. Something needs to be done with these definite conflicts of interest between firms and these companies. Absolutely disgusting on the manipulation that takes place!
both demand and supply for frpt product is collapsing yet it nearly hits a 52 week high today?
they have 2 mil in cash. they probably have to sell more stock to raise money.

it's actually cheaper to buy your pet real chicken and beef and feed them it directly ....

"Two swindlers arrive at the capital city of an emperor who spends lavishly on clothing at the expense of state matters. Posing as weavers, they offer to supply him with magnificent clothes that are invisible to those who are stupid or incompetent. The emperor hires them, and they set up looms and go to work. A succession of officials, and then the emperor himself, visit them to check their progress. Each sees that the looms are empty but pretends otherwise to avoid being thought a fool. Finally, the weavers report that the emperor's suit is finished. They mime dressing him and he sets off in a procession before the whole city. The townsfolk uncomfortably go along with the pretense, not wanting to appear inept or stupid, until a child blurts out that the emperor is wearing nothing at all. The people then realize that everyone has been fooled. Although startled, the emperor continues the procession, walking more proudly than ever."
this thing is trading higher than SBUX Does the SEC even care about anything theses days ???soo much fraud going on
Would be surprised by a market cap of 1/2 billion forget about 1.3 bil

Fresh pet is a strange name. I am not sure what that means.
"There was a $345MM secondary approved. The price per share: ""no more than $143 per share"" (see sec prospectus filed 2/24). The lead banker is B of A securities. I would have to think that before FRPT goes up, it needs to go down (converge) a bit to offset this difference. I have not checked with any members of the selling group, whether one cold buy at $143, as even though it was approved for distribution, it is a ""shelve"" issue, which I think provides some discretion................. Short term only:"

"Still losing money, 100 times next year's earnings and stock almost doubled since March. Makes total sense."
what shadow bank is driving this price ?another Archegos criminal scam type set up ?
I am about to buy in. This stock is a hyper growth story with a 5 year earnings growth rate of 106 percent. I believe a lot of growth is still ahead for this name and that while the P/E is sky high it will contract over time through earnings without the stock price having to do a major implosion. Analysts are extremely bullish as well. While not yet positive on operating margins or earnings this is a young company in terms of being public and the metrics are typical for a company freshly new to the earnings game. Overall there is a lot more to like than dislike here.
Seeing near empty fridges at supermarkets. One even had a note about distribution problems effecting inventory.

"Peter Lynch liked value stocks that traded at cheap valuations based on their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. However, he also considered growth as part of the equation and thus wouldn't reject a high-P/E stock if it had a high growth rate, too. Lynch is famous for introducing price/earnings-to-growth (PEG), which factors growth into value. FRPT P/E (Trailing Twelve Months) 1,275.00 yet the fools claim this is a peter lynch type stock LOL PUMP PUMP PUMP then one day DUMP"

"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.

Should be trading around $3/share.I agree with the previous poster that I've never seen anybody even looking at the product, let alone buying it. That explains the flat to negative earnings year after year but doesn't explain a 500+ p/e ratio.Anybody with an explanation why a dog food company is among the richest valued companies in the world if not the richest, please enlighten the rest of us."

These bears like Don and Effsocialism don’t get that at this point P/E is meaningless and that FRPT for the moment has an advantage over the competition both in terms of cost leadership in their dog and cat food as well as food quality. Right now shorting it makes as much sense as sticking your hand down a running garbage disposal. Not a question of if you’ll get hurt but your pain tolerance.

Food supply chains are seriously broken. Fresh pet may mean fresh pet meat going forward. Make certain your dogs and cats are not straying as the country goes hungry.
your retail outlets need more inventory.. always running out of dog food.

ever wonder who is behind this Ponzi scam ?where is the SEC ???? maybe they own some shares too.
"Losses widening, forward ""projected"" p/e (which we know they won't hit since they can't turn a profit) is 128. Smart money is finally seeing the light with the recent 20% sell-off but when reality hits the fan, a realistic price would be in the $4-$6 range. Maybe the best short set-up in the entire market right now."

Only problem is that they had 4x more revenues and actual earnings."
Not sure how this stock maintains high double digits when they still can't turn a profit. I've been in and out over the years but I don't see a catalyst here. Maybe take another look when it gets back down to the 7-8 range.
It is unbelievable that a larger player hasn't come along and taken FRPT out by now. $350 million market cap is a rounding error for the big manufacturers. FRPT is in the sweet spot and exactly where the other guys need to be. Why try to get refrigerated shelf space and compete against them when you can just buy them and be there from day one.
Time for me to exit this stock on both sides. It’s definitely not a value stock. Makes basically no money and has a PE in the stratosphere while being up 200 percent for the year. Analysts keep upgrading it as they tend to do to make money so shorting this might not be too smart. The Apocalypse is upon us

Have 2 dogs and I've been in numerous pet stores and not once have I ever seen anyone buying this. Not even people looking at it.

FRPT is growing fast . For folks who DO read the earnings call there is reason for optimism . Will it cater a few days? Absolutely . But then ...

Surprised I wasn't tuned into FRPT... But they have impressive looking short and long-term charts...Still wondering about their valuation though?? Their growth rate is great ...but still I am seeing a PE of 200+ for fiscal 2021....Are they really going to grow that fast?Or are they a bit overbought?
