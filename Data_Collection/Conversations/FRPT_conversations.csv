"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"
"Spoiler alert!If you bought Freshpet because you are looking forward to a buyout, in my opinion that ship has already sailed.On March 17, 2009 Tyson Foods took a stake in Freshpet. After that point, they helped market Freshpet and werelikely responsible in getting the Freshpet refrigerators in so many key retailers. Tyson Foods also was involved in the $100 M IPO. It seems to me that it would be illogical for Tyson Foods to allow another food company, or any otherentity, to acquire Freshpet as they would be at risk of losing a major customer that consumes millions of pounds of meat.

ahhh yes a high end dog food company trading at 20x forward sales. trades like a tech company
"earnings just came out, missed expected earnings, stock down over 10% after hours, and nobody home here? Am I now the only shareholder?"
Your dog when you feed them plant based dog food.
"If you make a decision based on the false information provided by the Hedge Funds, my condolences"
Dog food company pretending to be a tech stock.
"BLUE is the #1 Wholesome Natural pet food brand in the U.S. with $1.275 billion in net sales and $319 million in Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2017, representing an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 25%. Over the past three years, Blue Buffalo has delivered compound annual net sales growth of 12% and Adjusted EBITDA growth of 18%.BLUE was bought for $8 Billion, about the price FRPT is today. Only problem is that they had 4x more revenues and actual earnings."
Do you love the growth with this company?Do you like the TAM ? Do you like the management?If you like all of these and profits you should take a peek at EXPI. You won’t Be disappointed !
Have 2 dogs and I've been in numerous pet stores and not once have I ever seen anyone buying this. Not even people looking at it.
I haven't been able to find this in any local pet stores for over a week.
Up on negative earnings from Chewy? If it cant break 134 resistance then it might have issues in the new couple weeks and keep the down trend going.
I am about to buy in. This stock is a hyper growth story with a 5 year earnings growth rate of 106 percent. I believe a lot of growth is still ahead for this name and that while the P/E is sky high it will contract over time through earnings without the stock price having to do a major implosion. Analysts are extremely bullish as well. While not yet positive on operating margins or earnings this is a young company in terms of being public and the metrics are typical for a company freshly new to the earnings game. Overall there is a lot more to like than dislike here.
"$WOOF is at $25 , $CHWY is at $75, $FRPT is at $180, $STIC is currently way undervalued , we will be $BARK and catch up soon !"
"This stock has been trading at somewhere between 350 to 2,000 times earnings for the last 5 years and has gone from $6/share to $90. Consistently misses earnings like clockwork.As we speak it's around 500 times earnings. Should be trading around $3/share.I agree with the previous poster that I've never seen anybody even looking at the product, let alone buying it. That explains the flat to negative earnings year after year but doesn't explain a 500+ p/e ratio.Anybody with an explanation why a dog food company is among the richest valued companies in the world if not the richest, please enlighten the rest of us."

Short sellers are going to chew through this waaay over priced stock like a hungry dog on a package of Freshpet. This company will be $65 by year end
Seeing near empty fridges at supermarkets. One even had a note about distribution problems effecting inventory.
