Is everyone holding till after merger ? Or are you guys going to sell on Merger vote day?
What a day. Congrats longs it’s been a rough journey lol
"Cramer said just said ring the register, so the best thing to do would probably hold for a bigger gain."
all of you are gone
"Already owned GNOG and was going to buy DKNG this morning. Ironically, this buyout happened so staying put and holding for more $$$$$. This will be a nice investment!!!"
Finally paying off been holding
"$BRAG should hit $60-$100 to catch up to the same P/S such as $SCR $GNOG, $GAN, $DKNG"
the approvals to Go Live in more states is approaching.
"So what do we do now, guys, hold or say bye ?"
I promise u wont see me on this board if this reaches 12.95 or above.
Why is it going down?

Shorts are getting crushed. Awesome!
"everybody is forgetting that GNOG has more state approvals to operate over the next few months, that along with Draftkings Positives , both stocks will go higher,"
Board is dead! Did everyone migrate to DKNG? Done Deal?
"I own xxxx $DKNG and XXXXX SHARES OF GNOG.,will not let go until the numbers get much higher. Hang on. This is just the beginning"
Date for the acquisition?
I’ve held GNOG for over a year. Does anyone know whether or not when the GNOG shares transfer to DraftKings shares if I will have to hold those shares for more than a year to avoid the higher capital gains taxes?
"No discussion of this stock for a long time and then Cramer randomly mentions he likes it the week before a merger? Don't be suspicious, don't be suspicious."
sold every last share of this stock. had to hold it for 6 months to exit with 10% loss. for my gaming dollar its $ELYS ALL DAY!
"I have an average share price of about $18, I’m long because here in Texas where GNOG is headquartered, gambling is actually illegal, but we will be voting on this in the fall. There’s commercials talking about the billions that leave the state going to casinos in Louisiana, that could create jobs in Texas, so I’m betting the law will probably get passed."
"Weak hands and swing traders just sold at the opening now wise investors hold their position and even are adding more, GNOG is well on the way to $ 23 minimum today (or more ... !) be patient guys, this will be a winner for sure ! GL all"
"Man, I remember the red days. All of those days I held the stock while it was falling, seem so long ago now."
"As we enter August, the eighth month of the year, it is important to remember that both Tilman and @chase have promised us to be in 10 more states by the EOY."
Why is the stock price not at the 1.56 Billion buyout price? We are 10% short. Stock should be at $20.00. Any reason for this?
A $5 upside this week from this level when the longs selling pressure decreases later today? Thoughts? Congrats to all who recovered today!
"The smart investors sold in the $20s after merger and didn't deal with all this drama. But I'm happy for the GNOG baggies, this stock was so undervalued and a tease. Y'all keeping your Draftkings shares? Or selling out and finding the next hidden gem?"
Writing “something”
"For the LCA to GNOG long stockholders my question is why would we hang on for another $1 move here. We have seen 12 to 25 to 12 to 18 today. We saw the delays of LCA, the AC commission news pop/drop, silent Tillman and some odd stock moves. The deal is $300 per user to dkng, equity for Tillman in Dkng (which he knew he couldn’t put up $ to develop mobile like them) and I have said the gnog app was horrible like 6 months ago. I think it’s time to sell and maybe put $ elsewhere. Who knows the deal might get delayed with a chance to buy in a bit lower? Thoughts?? Love the ride, and good luck to all either way."
Draftings goes to 75-80 bucks we are looking real good
should I sell off ? seem like keep going down for the past few days
Yeah it didn't like $12.
GNOG is still a bit cheaper to buy than DKNG...$55.84(.365) = $20.38 GNOG trading at $20.19.interesting
"Will the share price be calculated at the merger, pr is it already set in stone?"
What is the DKNG dollar amount x .365 Where can I verify the locked in price?
can't wait to see what my January 10call does at 930... oh my oh my.
this is it
"I know it’s not that big a deal but I noticed the ARK fintech fund bought 55,000 shares of draft kings yesterday."
"I hav 237 shares of GNOG would that be only 86.5 shares of ""New Draftkings"" ??"
How sweet it is !!
You should buy it on Friday.
These stocks should easily reach around $35 with the acquisition! This should be a very interesting day that i think we have all been waiting so patiently for !GLTA Be in it too win it
It was a classy move for GNOG to let DKNG be on the top end of the buyout. We know the M&A was really the other way around. I'm sure Draftkings share holders are breathing a sigh of relief to have GNOG bail them out.8>D
"So what should we do, sell GNOG and buy Draftkings or just wait until the conversion"
No sellers here
No telling how many we’re scared out of their shares before the pop because of these endless lawsuit postings below ?
Goldman Sachs new PT 73 FOR DKNG!
"Congrats to the GNOG longs. Kind ironic big bad DKNG bought them out, but it makes sense. As long as the SEC investigation DKNG is no big issue, should be all good. Cheers!"
PAYtience.
"Under the terms of the deal, Golden Nugget shareholders will receive 0.365 DraftKings share per each share owned."
20 million Volume soon
"Stock will move up big soon. Penn bought SCR for 2 billion on 23 million sales. That puts GNOG at 8 billion valuation,so, we should be at 96$ right now."
$ 22 BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY ? ... OR MORE ... ?
There is still a few days left for those attorneys to help you bears out. Looking forward to add to my position on the final day of August in preparation for big months ahead!
"JT posted dead money few mins ago, but he posted yesterday he sold at 18.50 and said dead money. So he's short, thats what she said."
No volume is the problem
Any recommendations on what to do with my December calls?
"nice up 6%, only 35% more and I'm even!"
"Dkng just bought 5 million customers for $300 each. The technology, talent, licenses and technology were free. Then the gnog shareholders sold their shares at a discount and let the shorts off the hook. Amazing really. Any bets a better deal doesn’t come along?"
"Remember me saying my friends girlfriend read my tarot for the first time ever and said I’d make a ton of money within next month?Well, here we are. Lol"
1.56B$/78.06M shares = 19.98$ / share implied value for GNOG in this deal. DKNG are stealing this company really.
Sell Sell Sell ..Book Profit. Hit Like it you made some money!
BOYOS GET READY FOR 30$!!!!
Looking for those apologies for slandering my name for 6 months…
$dkng printing money with nft’s
This board seems dead now. Sad…Still holding strong. Will transfer to DKNG.
"I had written Sept17, $22-1/2 call against all my shares. I was pleased to take in over $23/share. Looks like they will expire worthless and I'll just take in the $0.80/share."
"QUICK SURVEY: what you guys doing at opening? (1) Sell(2) Wait and see(3) Hodl and wait for my GNOG shares to be converted into DKNG1,2,3?"
Lets get to 20 bucks
Thank you DKNG for the buyout. I was under water for many months but no longer. Went from drowning to now having hope $$. Yahooooooooweeeeeeeee. Come on NFL lets cause another spike!
I'm here until this puppy hits $30
This is never going back to 11. Just hold and watch it grow.
"I am out if it hits 20, already have the order in."
My 2nd biggest position aquired by my 8th biggest. I think GNOG is worth way more but I am never one to complain about a quick gainer. Not selling yet. Grats to Chase and Dagster as well.
"Shorts are panicking , trust me. They are margin called , and they need the stock to move back down."
New York-listed Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG) has agreed a deal to sponsor American stock car racing team Front Row Motorsports (FRM). Car is very cool
"Michigan Numbers: $4.3 Million. GNOG was one of only two companies to gain market share, everyone else lost it.Where are the bears now?"
y'all remember the $10-$12 range that would seemingly never end?
"I can see over 20 today, short squeeze is possible with short covering so hold and do not sale at this level because the actual now should be over $19.30"
Golden Nugget Online Gaming is up 48.90% to 18.27
Just ordered from taco bell. Might take a nap after that and go for a walk in the evening.
"Congratulations to all longs! Unfortunately, I sold last week. But good too see that the future is looking bright for Gnog"
Come on $22
No longer a bag holder. Thank you GNOG!
Can we break 19 today?
Sell order at 22.
"Need to get Reddit on this stock. Low float, low volume, high short interest. EPS on the 16th."
"You people just do not know how to let things run. , you gotta cash out so fast."
"This is THE biggest gambling time of the year from now until SB, this is a perfect stock to establish a position in as DKNG will have a great season. World Series, College and NBA all will have their greatest gambling volume as there is pent up demand."
This should go up to 75% after the 8:30 EST conf call and during the trading day.
Hey so how would call options work after the merger? Lets say you had jan 2023 GNOG strike 10 calls. How would they convert this option? Would they change the strike? Because a draft Kings strike 10 would make the call instantly worth 41$ which would be too good to be true. How would this be handled?
"Just did the maths. Basically, you will get 100% ROI if you bought at the pre-acquisition levels. Prepare for takeoff"
To calculate the correct share price fir GNOG take the DKNG share price and multiply by 0.365. At the current DKNG price that’s over $ 19 so you should not sell below that !!
Arizona Approval Announced This Morning
"Checking my math…so if I have 1,000 shares GNOG, that converts to a holding of 365 shares of DraftKings at the market rate today and it’s all under the draftkings ticker. Is that correct?"
Think this deal could go way up in value before it closes. Draft could go as high as 80.00 to 90. Making this a real sweet deal..
"So gnog and draft will become one and be ""new drafting"" merging both stocks in to one"
Sold last week what a journey from LCA! only the beginning for some of you if your holding past merger. All the best Team GNOG
I dont like draftkings but I do like getting my money back
"Good nugget, go to 24.5 tomorrow"
"Nice healthy dip from draftkings. You're crazy to sell at this point. Chart looks great, upcoming catalysts look great. I don't know what else to say. This is going to 25-30 by end of year because draft Kings will approach 80-90 based on NFT expansions and more states and whatever other surprises they have for us. We're invested in the Amazon of gambling."
Dkng just hit 64 and more importantly it's RSI just went above 80. I would not sell yet. dkng should be 70+ soon barring mkt correction.
Why would anyone sell before earnings?
"This week 23-4 for sure, I´m gonna sell then, not so optimistic going into September.."
DKNG future $250 stock. This is the most beautiful acquisition I've seen in a loooonnngggg time
Congrats it’s a beautiful morning.
buy buy buy
"PlayUSA.com is writing that $20Billion will be gambled on just Pro and College football in just the coming months, exceeding previous assumptions and NOT including any Baseball or Pro and College BB so expect some stunning Earnings Revenues!!!!"
What exactly does it mean for Shareholders? Will we getting Draftkings shares instead? (cheaper)? or what?
"After being a shareholder of LCA/GNOG for over a year now..through the good and mostly bad days, today I decided to sell my shares at $20.50. I would have held to my shares for a very long period of time if DKNG did not propose to purchase GNOG. Having said that I won't be going anywhere. I figured out that it's best to sell GNOG and convert the money into DKNG stock immediately. There are 2 reasons for this.. Firstly GNOG is pegged to DKNG now so if DKNG goes up or down.. GNOG will follow accordingly. Secondly if the purchase agreement falls off for any reason (and GNOG is famous for being the cursed ugly duckling) then GNOG will return to its 12$ range while DKNG will keep the same value. I will definitely consider to buy again some GNOG shares if the latter happens :) but I won't risk getting back to 12$ given this golden opportunity.See you all on DKNG board fellas and hold on to your shares if possible, this is just the tip of the iceberg!Congrats once again to all the diamond hands and it's been a pleasure to go through this journey with you guys."
LOL I'm finally at break even after 8 months.
Since LCA all these haters on here complaining everyday. Zero patience no longer term horizon. All I can say is congrats to us longs who KNEW what we held and averaged down to great prices.
Don’t sell until we get the earnings report and we get a bit more information about the merger with draftkings.
Draftking is up! Buy buy buy when gnog is down
0.365 DKNG shares per share of GNOG. Today’s DKNG share price is $55. 365x($55/1000) = $20.07. Therefore buying more GNOG is a no brainer below $20. Anything below $18 is a bargain. That is if you’re bullish on DKNG between now and the acquisition date ofcourse! $DKNG
Take the money and run….. good for you
"Those that held, congrats today…. I had this stock since LCA but needed the money to make money in other stocks…. Hope you get paid today enjoy"
"Who's thinking of staying on board with this new entity ? I was in for the long run with GNOG and always thought those two companies were polar opposites on some specifics such as CX acquisition, marketing and their core business focus (iGaming vs sports betting). The hype has me wondering if we can actually get the benefits of both worlds. Not buying more yet buy not selling for sure. Thoughts?"
"Glad I added while everyone was complaining! Congrats to the patient ones. As for the shorts, well, thank you for making my gain bigger after you cover today."
"Hello people, been in this since LCA. Congrats to all longs!"
"Big question: sell thumbs down , hold thumbs up"
Draftkings will hit $60 minimum short term. That puts GNOG at $22. I am holding. You are selling with Draftkings depressed price. The NFL season is on its way and this stock will fly.
This is a bad deal shareholders should reject this offer. GNOG is worth at least $30 a share￼￼
"I will sell in 22-23 range. Would be great if I could exit this week to get some gains taken out before volatile September coming.. I am bullish, but there is way too much uncertainty right now and too much red in my portfolio. Better collect some green until it is green.. Wish you good luck who are holding through NFL and transfer to DKNG!!"
This one is a winner. Enjoy the AH pop as well.
Some people chatting as if they don't know about Draftkings merger. You own Draftkings now. The share price of GNOG will hover around (DKNG share price * .365). Just sell if you don't want to own Draftkings.
"Are we getting screwed?Ademi LLP alleges Golden Nugget Online Gaming's financial outlook and prospects are excellent and yet Golden Nugget Online Gaming shareholders will receive only a fixed ratio of 0.365 shares of New DraftKings' Class A Common Stock for each Common Share of Golden Nugget Online Gaming. The merger agreement unreasonably limits competing bids for Golden Nugget Online Gaming by prohibiting solicitation of further bids, and imposing a substantial penalty if Golden Nugget Online Gaming accepts a superior bid. Golden Nugget Online Gaming insiders will receive millions of dollars as part of change of control arrangements. We are investigating the conduct of Golden Nugget Online Gaming's board of directors, and whether they are (i) fulfilling their fiduciary duties to all shareholders, and (ii) obtaining a fair and reasonable price for Golden Nugget Online Gaming."
"GNOG was a stranded vessel, but the coast guard (draftkings) came to the rescue, put a line on it and it is pulling it higher and higher with it. Tilman is one smart dude, was down $22 large now even, but holding. what, jump off a locomotive to walk through the getto? NOT!"
"This stock only came out last year and like Draft kings it took a little time to get it,s footing! All stocks need to prove their worth and Like Jim Kramer said it was one of his favorite stocks that will eventually make it,s move ! I believe as most of us that GNOG is way undervalued and at it,s current price and the up and coming earnings on the 15th ,we should be hearing some very favorable reports on Revenue that will quickly catapult this stock to near $15 dollar levels before settling in around $13 to $14 !I am in it for the long haul and buy Value stocks !These are stocks that have a ton of room to grow !Looking at all the other gaming stocks we are in at one of the best values still left to buy into a solid stock, The risk with Gambling stocks is extremely low and with a proven business model that continually seeks out new gaming licenses as more and more states make it legal giving GNOG stock a steady slow rise as each quarter sees a profit !Wishing all fellow holders a very good luck ,I think we got a winner here!"
See what happens when Cramer says ring the register.
Know what you own lesson. Took a long time but avg'ed down hard at 12/13 levels to recoop and gain. Shareholders get .365 of DKNG upon merger. By my math it is undervalued right now and should increase based on YOLO crowd. Since I bought so much on dip I let a few go but still holding the rest. All depends on DKNG future value.
"when people do the math, they'll realise this is still undervalued"
But honestly *cough cough* $gnog and $dkng still waiting to blast off… and thats legit.. good luck to all here tho 
$20.00 by end of year.
"Since Draftkings wants to takeover GNOG, imho this is a good deal but when Disney is planning to join the group (?) ... it is a much better deal for GNOG investors. That means the offer could be raised to new level. At the end GNOG was a good bet but nobody could expect this powerful event taking place !!https://finance.yahoo.com/m/652ceacf-dcac-326e-b488-133f23d14999/disney-mulls-deeper-gambling.html"
"So great to see my guys DKNG come in and save my other guys GNOG, fun stuff."
"I will sell at 22-24 range, too risky autumn coming"

seems like the stock was driven down for months in anticipation of the dkng acquisition.
"During a stock swap buyout, investors with shares may see greater corporate profits as the consolidated company and the target company aligns.When the buyout is a stock deal with no cash involved, the stock for the target company tends to trade along the same lines as the acquiring company."
The Fertittas/Golden Nugget is an old player in the gambling world. My money is on Tilman.I literally bet the CEO on this one. I was worried for a while but no longer.GO GNOG !
$20 per share I believe
Hitting $27 in the coming weeks
"I remember back about a year ago when Tillman was pumping this stock on CNBC and I bought it hook line & sinker @ 18.60 except for one thing ?I don’t trust Billionaires!I started buying @ 14 and have rebought several times.I pretty much called the low of 10 and I always thought he would sell to a bigger fish, so I knew chasing lower prices would have a pay day.It took a while !Good luck to longs !4ck the shorts !"
"Dagster the Champion of GNOG drafting up a mad report right now, we readyy!!"
Boat the load
DKNG will acquire GNOG price 1.56 billion? Which means GNOG has another 50% room to appreciate?
"I'm up over 69% on this one as of today. I'm pretty surprised, because I anticipated we'd be pretty stagnant in the $18.50 range until the acquisition is finalized. I'm calling this one a long-term hold."
Around 30% of stock has traded today.
Sold for nice profit...thanks everyone. There were some good times and some bad times but Tilman made his investors happy. Goodbye.
"Still here!Only thing that’s changed is I now control 3,200 shares!"
Worth buying more before the buyout? What’s the cut off date for share conversion?
"if everyone holds, this squeezes?"
First ever buyout I have been in before any buyout offers were made. It feels good!
What date do you have to be a shareholder by to receive the draft kings shares?
for some reasons everybody just joined in one downgraded gnog to below 19. looks like the institutions are trying to scare us.
"I dump this dog for a profit after holding for over a year, 10,000 shares I let go this morning, breathing a sigh of relief.￼"
P is dead man walking.
"What happens to our gnog shares? Does the symbol go away, I don’t understand and need someone to explain what would we do with our shares"
Well I am happy with this of course but I think we could’ve even done better. My overriding simple philosophy on this was that Tillman took one restaurant and made himself a billionaire. He was going to find a way to make money with this situation one way or another.Not crazy about draft kings huge expanding losses but love thier app.Don’t own a massive amount But enough for me. I think this will help his restaurant companies as well as I would not be surprised to see draft kings offer comps to be use there. Congrats to all including brew crew Dags Chase who a lot of people owe apologies to Cptve etcCurious what some of you are going to do with your sharesEveryone have a nice day
it will cross the moon to the Mars
"One thing is certain. Tilman didn't work with retail investors best interest on this. He hyped this stock to be a no pipe investment, so us retail investors flooded to buy this. And he left us bag holding for a year. Folks who have been in this since LCA knew that GNOG was heavily manipulated. However, who would've guessed it's Tilman and BOD were manipulating this after all. They exactly knew what they were doing by taking this public. There is no reason to sell GNOG (to DKNG) at it's lowest point, at this dirt cheap valuation. Well, until you realize the bottom line. That is, retail investors got played again."
there's always these investigations by these law firms following ever deal announced.
"I’m going to keep holding, because I’m happy to get DKNG shares, but it’s also disappointing that the price is now going to be suppressed after earnings and any other upcoming catalysts. I don’t see growth as aggressive now, price is going to hover around the acquisition ratio."
"I bought 1,000 shares of Draftkings $10.81 when it was a Spac and bought 1,000 shares of LCA / GNOG at $15.94. I still own Draftkings and sold my 1,000 shares of GNOG today. I’m not being greedy but I think we got short changed. GNOG should easily be $30 to $50 a share. Tilman gets all these side marking agreements with the Rockets & Laundry’s. GNOG gets a large penalty if they seek or accept a higher bid. We got short changed."
anything under $19.36 is not worth saling since the actual value of this stock is worth now that at .365 of draft-king.
"baseball playoffs, football season and more approvals for GNOG in more states in the next few months will increase both stock prices"
Buying the dip means you get dkng cheaper...
Why don’t I just sell GNOG and go buy dkng right now? What is the point of waiting for merger? 1 little piece of bad news or a deal falls through and this tanks again…
I sold all my shares at 18.71 and don't regret even a bit. Put all my money into Apple now I can sleep peacefully at night.
"Look at the chart, the reversal is coming, we are in a solid acumulation zone and going up"
"I wipe with nice profits, I want 6 figure profits"
I'm OK with owning more DKNG. GNOG came with a big opportunity cost. Bought back in LCA days. Lesson learned.
That's nice seeing the number 20 the first time after a half a year!
Sell order in at 21.00 for today. Missed 20 by a nickel yesterday.
18.98 is the minimum you will get.I am assuming it will run upto 19.7 today
"This could easily double. Depends on the price of Draft but coming out of football season and going into the Super Bowl, Draft could hot 100. Which puts GNOG close to 40.00. Hold and buy more isy rec."
Someone mentioned this a couple of weeks back in this forum. I only invested a month ago or so. Love the profit.
What does this mean for the stock ?
"what's the proce target by January? it almost hit 30 just a few months ago, does anyone think it will find that level again soon?"
Anyone sell? Or still holding
"Lots of growing interest in the online gaming -- here is an extract of last friday aug. 27th -- sounds good news for GNOG, monday GNOG could be very active on the stocks market, I'm ready !https://finance.yahoo.com/m/652ceacf-dcac-326e-b488-133f23d14999/disney-mulls-deeper-gambling.html"
I'm a long hold I believe in Tillman and draft Kings I think it's gonna be a monster in a few years
Lets goooo
"I bought GNOG because I felt it was fairly valued relative to similar stocks in this sector. Why would I want my GNOG shares to convert (0.365) to DraftKIngs when DraftKings is overvalued. At current share price, DraftKings is at a 21 billion valuation . On 1 billion in revenue, that's 21x revenue. Not saying the stock price can't or won't go higher, but it doesn't make since based on the current numbers. Just my 2 cents...."
"Been here since LCA, why leave now???????????????"
I'm guessing the staff went home and forgot they were supposed to release earnings.
congrats longs
$23.97 Target by EOD
"1.56B = 19.97 a shareOK do the math... that $1,56B divided by total shares 78,1M = $19.97 a share... easy 10% gain at under 18.50... will float up to 19,50 by end of next week.. been here before ...barring an issue.. but easy money otherwise,"
load the boat
Next up is $RSI $25+ PT
Who will hold Draftkings after the acquisition?
Until the acquisition happens should I continue to buy GNOG or average in to DKNG?
"Should I keep buying more gnog, to accumulate more shares of the new draft kings?"
hold and do not sale guys. its actual value now is over 19.30 if the marriage goes thru.
keeping all my shares. This will continue to rocket
Thanks to paper hands short sellers are getting off easy. Never whine about not making money again. You may not know how.
"We are still bag holders, but we have a few coins inside"
when is GNOG expected to expand into more states?
"So the offer is 1,56 bn.Friday closure was at 12,27 or about 0,957 bn.So today the stock should go to 20.001$ and stay around 19/20$ area until the acquisition is done. Correct?"
SOLD MY 5000 SHARES FOR A NICE PROFITI ALREADY OWN DKNG AT 29.80 WHY WOULD I PAY 52 FOR IT NOW
Shorts could drive it higher then $18-20
buy more pass 19 and were flying !!!!
No one left here? You all sold?
So now the lawsuits begin with a firm investigating if GNOG got a fair price. Thoughts???
Is there any chance this deal doesn’t go through? Why wouldn’t this be trading at the 1.56B the deal values it at?
Any one listening to the merger conf call now?
"I wonder if people know they're selling below the value of the deal. Emotional trading is never good. ""I'm finally even, I'm getting out, wah""."
Anyone know the number for the earnings calls
What do shareholders get
Will this ever become a meme stock?
Hopefully we will get an update after earnings of Virginia and when we will be entering it
BUY BUY BUY
"i'm out, will re-invest soon in DKNG GL to all. Lets go RSI"
Expectations for tomorrow?
Any bag holders going to contact the law firm?I’ve got a fairly large loss even after yesterday but don’t think I want to wait another year to see if DKNG goes back to $70
Tillman has agreed as part of the merger to hold onto new draftking shares for a minimum of 1 year
There is going to be a massive short squeeze !!!!
Each Golden nugget share will turn into new draftkings with a ratio of 1 to 0.365 so this means currently DKNG is 53$ per share x0.365 = the real value of GNOG 1 share should be 19.345$ that`s an upside of #$%$ roughly HELL YEAH
