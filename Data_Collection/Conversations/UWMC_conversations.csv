Safest and under valued stock on the market 
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Even with a strong hype the share price can't hold over $6.50 a share. Pretty sad.
"@Brenda... I'm rooting for you here, but gosh sell this ifyou get close to even.. I'm sitting on a 135K paper loss on 91,000 shares ofATT (T), but I feel it's a much safer stock, better dividend, etc..I was a Mortgage Banker for 25 years in Ga.. With rising rates, and tremendous competition in themortgage business, margins are really getting squeezed."
Flatlined... beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
The average pricing in our area is $1.5 mil
I'll b adding this week freaking 6% is just to dam good 
"Market cap is 10.2 billion. Given current headwinds, still plenty of room to fall. I won't buy back in above 6."
"Dividend, under valued, and over sold "
Bolt Baby!
Woodie did you see what happened to NVAX today? I hope you did not get in that one. I know you posted about it a week ago.
Both $RKT and UWMC have a bright future. United We Make Cash!
This boat just keeps leaking
"Steve: Undervalued at 10, wait 9, wait 8, wait 7, wait 6....oh well dividend.Brenda: I'm riding UWMC to the moon along with RKT. Everything they do means higher profits. High rates, low rates, purchases, refi, more market share, lower margins, more, more, more. Who's with me?Steve: I am honey, I'm averaging down all the way to $1.Brenda: That's so sweet Steve."
"It's not only uwmc, it's going to be everything directly or indirectly related to the consumer that trades sideways and down until the government passes its budget. I doubt China will be getting much better either, so I'm holding off on this stock and many others because everything is connected and could be pulled down. The time to consider buying is after they pass a budget."
"Business 101 quiz, is increased volume really increased volume if it was done at a loss to bring it in?"
Stars are aligned to make uwmc fly. With great earnings and positive market time to average down!!
The biggest problemThis stock has it is too diluted when they went public and all the stock issued over 1.603 billion shares outstanding so regardless of how much the profit maybe this stock is stuck unless the company does a reverse split this company will stay in this price
August home sales up significantly. That should be a positive for mortgage stocks
As I have been saying before the next three years are up everyone is going to need a mortgage or second mortgage. The mortgage companies are going to make a fortune!
"Greatly oversold, huge value play with an excellent dividend, This will get bought up by more ETFs and millions in UWM buy backs over the next 18 months."
Options expiry today. Hope they don’t crash this to 6.99 by close 
Well I’m back to the first reason I bought UWMC and $RKT. Before the next three and half years are over everyone is going to need a loan! The interest rates will rise with inflation and so will the profit these stocks take in. Thinking ahead and planning is everything!
100k Buy to go. Debt ceiling raised and increasing revenues. No crypto for now for mortgage payments.
Actually thought this would be a lot lower today. Surprisingly holding up fairly well all things considered.
Way too many shares and way too much $$ paid in dividends to the ceo. Love that they are aggressively chasing market share now in lieu of margins as a future growth plan but I have a hard time seeing any catalysts that will drive shareholder value in the short or medium term
"The stock is clearly being manipulated, there's a reason it was on the Threshold list for 13 consecutive days then magically gone on the 14th when regulators would have forced action on naked short positions"
Debt ceiling will be approved tomorrow. Congress and white house will come with long term strategy. UWC will have great quarters. Hoping to see 10+
Revenues will be higher for this quarter and for coming quarters.
But the dividend.......
$5 at best. How many defaults are in their servicing portfolio? I can only wonder.
"Earnings are not next week, Yahoo is wrong on their prediction (and way off) for that. Second quarter earnings were announced 8/16/21, Q3 earnings will likely be announced in November (three months later) sometime, but there is no official date set yet."
"Ok, as long as the market keeps going up 500 points a day, we will gain a penny a day"
Show of hands . . . who is NOT under water?
"Dumped my 2,000 shares at a loss ($9.03 avg.) Like Craaig Daavid said below, at this point its an opportunity cost."
UWM is up 5.29% to 7.17
So that everyone knows I make money with the company doing business with them.UWMC has invested heavily into technology that compared to other lenders like ROCKET no comparisonWhat takes a broker like myself to close a transaction I. 2 weeks with UWMC will take me 4-6 weeks with Rocket
When is earnings? Pm?
The dividend is great! . . . guess who gets 94% of the dividends?
As interest rates rise so will the bottom line for both RKT and $UWMC. Enjoy this beautiful journey we will be taking over the next couple of years:)
$UWMC the largest Mortgage Wholesaler in the US is using Voxtur’s ANOW platform
Mat retire half of the shares. Now Please!
Safest stock on the market and I get paid to wait
give us 10% yield
When we expect the ER? Anyone? Thank you
"Both $UWMC and RKT will go up when everyone least expects it. Then everyone will say, ""I wish I had bought more"". It happens this way every time!"
There are just way too many shares for this thing to ever get off the ground.
6.45 EOY. Your money is dead here...
"well you got scammed it's ok, take your umwc losses as an education, you paid that money to learn how to spot scams. Too bad you lost all that money but it happens.."
well the good news???...yeah.. the dividend payout is now 6% at this SP!
Again I truly think the only reason why the stock is stuck is because the stock is to diluted Ishiaba reverse split this company ASAP
Down again? Ouch!
"Someone explain how a company with over 1,600,000,000 outstanding shares (thanks to an overly selfish CEO) is supposed to ever go up. Tell the greedy SOB to retire half the shares !!!!!"
Accumulating 
first-hand experience of appraisal direct https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZjn43cQcrw
Safest under valued stock on the market 
Going to $7 & $8 next week We dipped like this in May & went up to 10.50 so will see that again 
"Very red market day! But, both UWMC and $RKT end green. I like it:)"
"If 2022 looks like Q2 did, that's. 357.8million * 4 = 1.431 billion in net income. Assuming no more 219.1 million dollar write offs.The ipo valuation multiple off 9.5 was high. About 40% more than RKT/LDI/COOP. So let's take a multiple of 7 instead. 7*1.431billion = 10.017billion Divide 10.017 by 1.6 billion shares and you have a stock price off $6.26 a share. Decrease the multiple to 5 too offset expected decreasing refinance volume and increasing competition. Not hard to see this in the $5 range."
First day off the NYSE Threshold Security List after many days in a row now on the list.
"Way Undervalued right now. Company is doing stocks buy back, Last qtr 3 million!!"
Quick Review of UWM's Appraisal Direct - from Broker...This is essentially a 'hot take' on trying out the new Appraisal Direct service.https://youtu.be/HfeyLyWn_hwI think this is going be really good for $UWMCThis service is being powered by ANOW - A Voxtur company ($VXTR / $VXTRF) www.voxtur.comThere is now a subreddit for r/VoxturAnalytics ( https://www.reddit.com/r/VoxturAnalytics/ )- where you can see more information on them. It's a new subreddit.
going to accept bitcoin soon
Is 3rd qtr revenue on oct 11th?
Anyone with info on warrants? UWMCWS
With buy momentum we should see 10+
Beautiful bullish hammers have formed on the chart. I'm loving it!
We going 8 next week
number of the beast
Good article I say buy Voxtur https://www.mpamag.com/us/mortgage-industry/business-growth/the-firm-behind-the-uwm-app/311771?utm_source=GA&utm_medium=20210930&utm_campaign=MPAmW-Newsletter-20210930&utm_content=DF199BCB-666F-47D3-B316
I'll wait for $4 to jump in. Inflation and economy don't look too good now.
So many shares shorted.
Spot on Mike margin calls and rising rates are no good for mortgage companies. Higher rates means less refinancing. Purchase will stillBe around but overall volume will decrease. Rather be in the big banks
It was a great move to create a war with RKT. Lol worked out well for the employees.
Dividend 
This isn't a huge holding of mine but I to like to direct extra cash into it. Divvy makes it easy to hold
We require few angel investors to buy on deep along with company stock buy back.
300 million dollar of stock purchasing. 3 million stocks already purchased as per filing. We might see few more million in 3rd qtr update. Recenue is increasing along with Equity and cash flow. Adding more!!
Buy time with debt ceiling passed and rates low
Nice day. Is the bottom in Brenda?
"it's a joke, get rid of ishibia"
"according to summary, PE ratio is 0.24. #$%$ how is it so low? is it a bug"
owning UWMC proves it best strategy to be diversified. this is my only stock trading sideways today.. all others 2-10% higher.
At least it pays a dividend
In case anybody needs to know the bottom is in for both UWMC and $RKT
At $6.66 this stock can go to he11
"October 15, 20217:30 am ET UWM Holdings Initiated at Buy by UBSDow Jones7:20 am ET UBS Initiates Coverage On UWM Holdings with Buy Rating, Announces Price Target of $8.5"
Two weeks ago I bought May 2022 7.00 call options for 0.72. That is a good price!
Maybe somebody can explain what the problem is with this skum ?
The dive to five. How many FHA defaults in portfolio. Blow hard CEO needs to let people know the numbers.
$VXTRF / $VXTR Voxtur Analytics 2 business until the in-the-money warrants expire. I believe this will have a material positive impact on the share price. $UWMC $COOP $RDFN $OPEN
"If Mkt. Cap. goes down below 10B, UWMC would not qualify for Russell1000 any longer, right?"
any news on ER? thank you
NVAX dropped 20% today BBBY dropped 25% yesterday. I'm perfectly fine holding UWMC and collecting my dividend! I'm not planning on selling for a number of years anyway!
A very nice day for both UWMC and $RKT I like it! I hope everyone has a great weekend:)
Good time to buy!! Will go 8+ in next few weeks when shorters will be forced to cover. Short squeeze at 73% more them AMC and GME
Analysts are forecasting 100 to 150% increase in revenues this quarter. Will add more!!
Every quarter they have made money but yet the stock does not move
100 to 120 million cash equity every year for investors. Multiply by 10 it us 1 billion plus. 6.5 is steal and too tempting to get all in
PE: 0.25 & Forward Dividend & Yield 0.40 (5.86%)... What else can you expect ????
"The markets are open on Monday. Will earnings happen on Monday as predicted by TD? I don't know, but it will likely be next week. The 7 strike calls are 5 bucks for Oct 15th. Cheap bet."
"NRZ better stock play, safer company, stronger dividend. PMT too. UWMC $5 stock tops. Cant see how they will keep dividend going. Bad business model."
"If not for the dividend this con job would be trading on the pink sheets, imo."
Let's take a vote thumps up if you want me to start calling a daily bottom on $UWMC and RKT!
When is ER?
For 300 million dollars we can have 40 million stock buy back. Will be if we had 6 to 10 million stock buy back. Wouldn't be surprised to see equity value going to 10.
Hate myself for holding this
6 days in a row on the NYSE Threshold Security List as of last night at 11pm.
"10 days in a row now on the NYSE Threshold Security List. If anyone cares, you should whether long or short ; )"
Usually Friday here at $UWMC and RKT. Everyone go and have a great weekend!
Under valued
well the good news?...i can buy2 shares for same price as my lunch today!
"I am long no doubt in it and lost decent amount of money. But I feel really sorry to the ppl who buy just because of some one keep pumping it saying here is the bottom and it will moon, chart looks great etc. plz don’t follow some one blindly and get hurt!! God bless all of us who bought at 2 digits. My cost is 11 after new averaging down "
UWMC Technicals are just awful. Look at the 3 month if you don't like technicals. Straight line down. I'd rather be in $ET. At least oil is going up. House financing is not.
"@Brenda.. Hey, Sorry you're still in these 2. Told ya a month or so ago, you need to RUN from these.Rkt is one of the worst I ever owned. Only by the grace of Reddit I got out of that one with a small profit instead of losing over 100K. Decreasing margins on these 2. Increasing rates and brutal competition make fora recipe of disaster for these... IMO.. I hope I'm wrong, I'd love to see you get out alive, like I did..."
We are actually realistically at a decent entry point now. It’s entirely possible a better one comes in the coming weeks as there are really no substantial catalysts on the horizon but as a long term hold 7$ is a great entry for uwmc. My avg will be about 8.50 after the coming dividend.
You know as soon as you sell. $UWMC and RKT will both take off like a rocket! United We Make Cash!
I saw a post on reddit to buy $VXTR $VXTRF - Voxtur Analytics as a way of playing the success of the $UWMC Appraisal Direct offering. Apparently sign up is through the roof. The Appraisal Direct is on Voxtur’s ANOW platformBasically a long dated option to participate in the success of $UWMC Appraisal Direct
Lot of institutional buys in last one month at average of 8. Now Debt ceiling issue is resolved and great revenues coming we should be 8+
This company makes money quarter after quarter and the stock won’t move.They made a mistake in issuing too much stock 1.6 billion shares(stand to be corrected Too diluted at this point need to do a reverse split
"According to Yahoo, PE ratio is .25. Wow. Way oversold, people."
Increasing Positive revenue with stock buyback in place. Receipe for company growth and investor equity value.
"hmmm. what to do...buy, sell or hold? ive been holding mainly because i figure the downside risk is minimal at this point. i feel the company is going in right direction, but mortgage industry is unliked by investors right now and therefore the SP can't get any positive movement. thoughts?"
$10.50 price target by financial expert Ruslan Provodnikov
"This is NOT oversold, it's trading at a huge premium. When one understands the massive amount of outstanding shares then they will come to realize the CEO is one of the greediest person on the face of the earth, imo. fair value is maybe 1 billion market cap or lower not the current 11 billion."
what's moving this up today? mortgage demand?
"when you're right... you're right, sold at $10, been lolling ever since"

"UWM holdings has same situation once Tesla had. Hopefully Mr. Mathew R. Ishbia can pull page from Elon Musk play book. Disruptive platform, Great revenues and shorted."
Ive just been collecting covered calls 
"Homegamers......It Could Be Worse.. My Account is $75,000 RED Today on the 3 Stocks I Own.....PLUG......LVS......T.....I used to own RKT several times, so I peek into the Rocket and UWMC chatroom about oncea week.."
Under valued  accumulate 
In the short-term the stock market looks ugly. It would be wise to cover up for a while and certainly not overextend. That includes uwmc. I'm setting up my positions and waiting to strike when things turn around.
"So glad my 6k shares were called away at $9. That being said, at current price it's looking attractive."
bouncy!
The dividend drip starts tomorrow. The bottom is in guys!
Coming back strong 
"So the Democrats are going to be looking at how SPAC's have perhaps ripped off retail investors? UWMC is a perfect example, imo."
House buying and refinancing is at all time high. Rates are low will be end of the next year. Company is doing stock buy back and revenues are positively increasing. What shorters are seeing bad in this company to short??
Wow! The dividend now pays over 6% . . . simply amazing!
Next week 
UWMC trying to market Appraisal Direct as something different when every lender in America does this. UWMC reaching now. Be weary.
"for those who are interested in making $$$, the appraisal software they are using is from a cutting edge software company from Canada call Voxtur VXTR curring trading at a 1$ it will be 10x next year, Fannie May rollout this month"
I don't think earnings have been announced but I am loading up at these prices.
What is UWM's long term plan? They are trying to capture market share from Rocket by giving away loans. UWM margins are basically near zero. How is that sustainable long-term?
Meanwhile NRZ and PMT keep going up up up. With better dividends.
What’s everyone doing today in front of earnings Monday AM?
I was in it from $13.00 -7.03 with 5000 shares. Made about half my lost money back with covered calls. This is going to 5 something. Was over valued at 9.5 2021 exp earnings which won't come to fruition. Add up how much we made in 2021 and what was expected.
UWM holdings average loan interest rate return 3% with 1% on loan origination revenue this qtr can be 700+. We might get surprise revenue increase with profit margin
"Does anybody else realize not much is going on with this stock, but they check in for the zaniness of this board?"
"Reasons Why UWMC Is A Buy, Hold Or An Add More: We Have The Dividend Pay Out On The Way! We Have Had No Inside Sellers! Only Inside Buyers! And May I Add They Are Buying On A Regular Basis! Our Chief Technology Officer, Jason Bressler Along With His Team Will Continue To Build Our Technology! Plus UWMC Has Hired Desmond Smith a Former Top Executive From Fannie Mae And Who Also Ran Chase and Citi Retail Divisions! We Have A Share Buy Back In Progress Over The Next 2 Years! And Last But Not Least We Have A CEO That Hates To Lose!"
Why the implied Shares (1.61 billion) of $UWMC are more than 10X of shares outstanding??? But $AMC and $GME have the same implied shares as shares outstanding??? What is going on????
$8 on monday.
Wait for a bottom. Better late than wrong.
"$VXTRF / VXTR.V I believe that the current revenues - the ""falling out of bed"" revenues post the XOME ( $COOP ) deal - but before the $UWMC deal - is $250mm $CAD for 2022.That is assuming $100mm for 2021 and $100mm for XOME - and 25% growth. Apply whatever multiple you want to that (I would use 10X to 15X).With new business wins, taxation, foreclosure and acquisitions - I think we could easily see $350mm and not too much of a stretch $500mm.To be clear - I think we land closer to $500mm than $350mm."
I average down to $6.77 hope I didn’t made a mistake

"100,000 shares left to short which is lower then it was. Cost to short went up too. The cmf line is positive which means strength. Which makes sense if you look at the options chain. There isn't any premium on the chain left. 8 calls are averaging 6¢ right now. If they pop UWMC stock price up, they can sell the chain for much more and then bring the price back down."
Added 2k today!! Seems good bet!!! Short squeeze us showing 73% . We require our reddit fellow investors on uwmc
"You're still here? This stock is over, accept it and move on."
September is almost over. I'm ready for October! UWMC and $RKT are going to Rock! Bring it on baby;)
Take your $ to Vegas. You are welcome in advance.
$40 in 10 years! Buy buy buy
"FHA Neighborhood Watch, public data available for anyone to read. Educate yourself. Look up 2 year FHA numbers. Doing loans at a loss in areas of high default are not good for long haul. Lots of lenders banking on rates going up and have bad loans in their servicing portfolios. What if rates dont go up? Going to be ugly come beginning of year."
"Keeping fingers crossed for next week. Congress passes debt ceiling, 3rd qtr news and additional stock buyback from management."
6.99 at close
103.1M shares outstanding? target for shorting?
How is that buyback going?
Both RKT and $UWMC will be winners in the coming months. United We Make Cash!
no problem just 10 years of dividend reinvestment and I will break even
"As a Broker I had the pleasure to Visit Headquarters in Pontiac MI last week for Broker Success Training. Very impressed, management is super smart and motivated. Matt is very driven, well spoken and has a unique platform to deliver mortgages with speed and efficiency. Their new Appraisal direct is another game changer in the industry. At first i was led to believe it was their own AMC company which would drive revenue to the parent co. Not the case, its purpose is to go directly to the same appraisers with NO middleman resulting in full fee paid to appraiser. This will further increase turn times for closing and most importantly eliminate the negativity with Realtors who do not like companies that have AMCs. If you are in the industry you now what I am talking about. If not trust me its a game changer."
That $.10 cent dividend is nice if you're never going to sell. In 20 years you'll be playing with house money. Otherwise you could be turning profits by realizing the share price would sink.
Just do a wellness check on Brenda. Everything alright buddy?
"Still holding GHIV shares which was merged into this total #$%$.. Still can't fathom how the CEO managed to get millions upon millions of shares for his own wretched carcass with a total of over 1,600,000,000 outstanding shares.. UNBELIEVABLE !!!!!"
28% short interest. just people shorting the wsb hype.
If ppl don’t know y this is up: dividend reinvestment. Received yesterday
"I saw a previous post that referenced AMD. I was following AMD back in the day and also sold in the single digits, long before they started their their ascent. The catalyst that made AMD rocket to the stratosphere was a management change at the top. Microsoft also didn't escalate until Bill Gates found a talented replacement for his company. I don't see it happening here because I don't see Mat handing the reins to HIS company over to someone who is interested in really maximizing its potential anytime soon. It may take years, so I look for major dips and take that relatively mediocre dividend. I hope to always retain a position here."
today's good news...2 green days in a row!
