Between buying the extreme lows to average down. Selling on every pump. Covered calls and dividends I managed to get out with an insignificant loss. Keeping 400 shares until either covered calls get exercised or the price goes to zero. Still think There will be a run at some point but I personally don’t see any major catalyst in the near or mid term for sure. Would have to be a retail run or something IMO
what news caused the bump?!!
Matt just deliver to your shareholders stop wasting money on football teams
"Usually stocks go up pre earnings, not this on"
today's good news....really cool full moon visible looking west this morning and followed with a beautiful fall day....and housing starts in September up 7.4% from Sept 2020.
"Way too many shares out there for this to ever go up again, but if there happens to be a quick spike to the upside then know it's only to trap new bagholders as it will certainly fall again"
"October 15, 20217:30 am ET UWM Holdings Initiated at Buy by UBSDow Jones7:20 am ET UBS Initiates Coverage On UWM Holdings with Buy Rating, Announces Price Target of $8.5"
Going to $7 & $8 next week We dipped like this in May & went up to 10.50 so will see that again 
Does anyone else think Kyle Shanahan and Mat Ishiba had the same public speaking professor?
These guys are so efficient on what they do other companies cannot compete with themThis quarter they willMake money again and the next but the company is being punish because they went the SPAC WAY when they went to IPO and have there shares diluted issuing over a 1 billion shares
"Every single person that invested in UWM is underwater, and this is with interest rates at all-time lows. What will happen to the stock price as interest rates go up?? Horrible investment opportunity."
Wasn’t there a share buy back plan?
RKT and $UWMC going much higher. Maybe sooner than we all think!
Q3 is not being released today I think? Yahoo has wrong info?
Is it tomorrow for earnings release?
"UWM is outrageously overpriced at $7/share. Fair market value is $3 based on rising 10-year treasury yields and the following 30% decrease in mortgage originations going into 2022. UWM is a great company with plenty of profits but for an investor to make money, this stock needs to drop another 50% off of current values."
Me in 2022
So glad I got outta this as soon as I turned a profit
UWM holdings average loan interest rate return 3% with 1% on loan origination revenue this qtr can be 700+. We might get surprise revenue increase with profit margin
Wow! The dividend now pays over 6% . . . simply amazing!
