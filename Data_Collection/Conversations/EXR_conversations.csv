What makes this company go up or down? I suppose a recession would make it go up.
A heck of a dividend grower. Will buy at a better price.
Excited to see a methodical rise to $105 after the earning report at the end of July...Keyword here...methodical!
"reported great quarter results, why is price down 6%???"
Anyone know why big drop today as nearing x-date??

"Any idea why the move today? I know the segment is over built, but I like their growth in management of third party buildings, I think it’s a great inflation hedge to own real estate, and I thing people will look for yield because bonds pay nothing"
