What a tough spot. I don’t know if I should double down or just sell and live to fight another day. They should be hitting highs right now given the pickup in fracking and construction. If management cant execute in this environment then we may see a 40-50% decline if market conditions tighten.
"From my direct experience, the management of EXP is outstanding. They don't take unreasonable risks just for the sake of growth.The low cost of natural gas and population shift from CA to TX are tailwinds that should help long-term."

It was quite the run in 2017 but it isn’t over yet. They are in every area of construction that is hot right now. They have a nice mix of residential along with commercial construction products. Mix in the frack sand that demand will increase in 2018 for and we are looking at $135 in 2018.
Kinda baffled any constructive reasons why the drop after a good report? Thanks fr any enlightenment.
