It was quite the run in 2017 but it isn’t over yet. They are in every area of construction that is hot right now. They have a nice mix of residential along with commercial construction products. Mix in the frack sand that demand will increase in 2018 for and we are looking at $135 in 2018.
EXP continues in the sweet spotDemand improves for frac sand as oil goes up and the cement and wallboard demand will be HUGE in the southwest with hurricane rebuild and infrastructure possibilities

Went 10 pts straight up since my last comment. Will see some profit taking along the way but EXP is clearly well positioned to benefit TX recovery. They can also take a plant out of mothballs to make up for demand

What a tough spot. I don’t know if I should double down or just sell and live to fight another day. They should be hitting highs right now given the pickup in fracking and construction. If management cant execute in this environment then we may see a 40-50% decline if market conditions tighten.
