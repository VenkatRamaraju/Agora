I'm surprised such a massive profitable company languish at these low levels. Cannot find much negative information about it's fundamentals and I'm seriously considering to put most of my cheeky gamble profits on airlines here for a long term...Any serious thoughts for the next earnings call? More positive than the last one?
Grabbed some of Trane and added it to my growing CVS shares. Both are set to keep flying!

Trane and Ingersoll Rand considered “essential “ services and will continue to operate!
it's not down... they are issuing new IPO stock price... they're doing 1 for 1 split
Trane is no longer tied to oil so no impact from lower oil prices. It is now all about new commercial and residential building and replacement with a strong focus on environmental friendly solutions. This stock has strong legs. Expect it to climb quickly coming out of the corona virus pandemic.
This stock has been a big winner for me. And I think it's gonna continue it's rise well into the future.
"solid Q2 earnings report. traders are selling on the news, investors are buying. no matter who wins the midterm elections in '22 or the presidency in '24, people will need HVAC. Any acceleration on the pivot to green technologies is gravy."
Why is this train moving?
so did IR Residential division sell to Mitsubishi?
IR should be valued +$120 considering the reverse Morris merger. Shareholders of IR will end up with new IR company stock and stock in Climate Solutions newco.
not bad for a day can't complain about 5% rise :) I used to earn that kind of % in a quarter or even a year on steady companies like this
"Can someone explain why $TT is much more expensive than $CARR ? Both should do very well, but Carrier seems like a bargain here."
Schwab is taking their time sorting this out. I had one position in IR...today I have 2. They're both called IR with one having 100 shares and the other with 88 shares. The 88 share position is trading and the 100 share position is not. What's the deal?
What is the impact of global tax deal which Ireland agreed to sign on this company as TT is based out of Ireland for tax purpose?
train is the largest and best manufacturer of units for 18 wheeler cargo trailers
Just received my 1099 from Fidelity- Trane's dividends are not being categorized as qualified. Has anybody else noticed this? Is it correct? I would think that they should be considered qualified dividends? Thx
Why is this still cheaper than $TT. Could easily argue there is more upside.
