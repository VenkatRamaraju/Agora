"Another earnings stinker. I wouldn't be surprised if we head to the low 20s. Business is definitely hurting and a recovery is only expected in 2022. Lot's of uncertainty. Falling sales and margins and Home Depot is ramping up competition. Sorry boys, I'm out for now. Maybe I get back if we hit the teens."
Heading to 40s
Mgmt needs to take a huge pay cut based upon declining performance. The BOD has the obligation of addressing the senior compensation level based upon where this stock was and now is....
My new investment stratagy.... buy any co1mpany one of my son-n-laws goes to work for. One went to Boeing stock @ $29.75 today $185.00. Another CVS $45 now $83. and next HD could have bought @ $21 when he was there now @ $155.So I'm in on FND @ $30.29 NOW LET IT ROCK & ROLL........
Need to reign in Exec comp since they are not performing....one of the most over-paid Exec teams in America...
Lowes should buy this. It expands their specialty footprint.
I'm strongly thinking about shorting FND or TTSH. Anyone else see these two as overbought?
I'm afraid we're going give up the last week's big gains....Virus becoming more of concern due non-containment and supply disruption lowering ability to meet demands
Huge buying opportunity!!! A great earning and bright future!!!
patience will see this stock climb to 70
"Looks like they money and dilute the stock holders value, time to sell this"
"Today FND was downgraded by an analyst who said the housing market is slowing, and doesn't see any upside from here. She gave a 12 month price target of $44. Yet today, the stock is trading over the 12 month target. This is the second downgrade for FND in as many days."
oh yeah
I'll take 47.17 for a nice profit.
"I flew into O'Hara last week, while I was there I stopped by one of their stores. I'm a contractor here in Southern California. I build showers and install floors amongst other things. IT WAS IMPRESSIVE!!!!!! 72,000 sq ft don't lie. I spoke to a few of the employees that were working there. They told me that people travel from Indiana, Michigan, Minn. and all over just to come to the store!!!!! In addition, they also told me that when people come, they stay for hours and hours!!!! There was a line forming before they even opened the doors and people kept on coming! the reason HD is doing better and has the lion share over Lowes has been that contractors go to HD and homeowners go to Lowes. Same goes for FND. They have so much more to offer and its in stock! This is a winner! been in since IPO."
picked more 40.65 added to my 30s
sold 50% 38.50let rest ride will sell if it hits 34-36
"There is nothing ""wrong with this stock"". It is called ""dilution"". You are in bed with private equity and they don't give a damn about you. They are in at a much lower price than you and they will use every opportunity to cash in and dilute you. As it is, they still own 75% of the company even after last week's secondary."
"In the earning conference call, their sales actually declined by 46% during lock downhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4341867-floor-decor-holdings-inc-fnd-ceo-thomas-taylor-on-q1-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single"

love the movement
Home remodeling is on the decline.https://amp.businessinsider.com/home-depot-lowes-housing-market-2018-11
this is a good stock to hold onto. it may take a while to move up but it will
"FND has a class action lawsuit in the works. Also, they depend on buying materials from China. For those reasons and others, I just sold my shares with a profit. I may buy again in the high $30's, because that's where I think it's headed next."
This stock is oversold big time IMO..look at the rsi...look at the share price...look at the p/e
Time for HD to buy this out.....
time to jump before I sink.
great action for after hours. let's keep it going on Monday
Why no dividends ?

Housing market sentiment needs to improve then this stock will take off in my opinion. Long FND.
The guys beat forecasts with amazing results again.Net sales increased 86.0% from the second quarter of fiscal 2020 to $860.1 million.Comparable store sales increased 68.4% from the second quarter of fiscal 2020.Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) increased 156.7% to $0.77 from $0.30 in the second quarter of fiscal 2020; Adjusted diluted EPS* increased 461.5% to $0.73 from $0.13 in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
"This will be a nice one. I do mega business them and have for years. Solid company, should look something like Home Depot over time, its not a short play."
is it going to end in green today?
"This company will never move forward it’s almost imposable to pay with a check , thanks an hour to clear . 2019 and they haven’t figured it out realproblem"
Boom!
"Where do you get that 50% statistic from?.... I do not remember ANY of the NON wood/laminate products from Asia.... more than 50% of their flooring is marble, travertine, tile and these do not come from China/Asia...."
Im waiting for $35
Wonder how many people who are selling have been to a store. Go visit a store talk to the people on the floor. Strong management they know how to drive sales. See you at 60.
"The institutional investors of this stock have historically been quite happy to hold at these PE ratios. Since analyst estimates of YoY quarterly improvements are huge, I think it would be a mistake to short and this time. Unless, the stock price skyrockets prior to earnings."
"The numerous analyst that maintained, and even upgraded this company, in February with full knowledge of the characteristics of Covid 19 and the pandemic to come has me wondering how they have gumption to continue posting their ratings as if it had any credibility. People are not concerned with their flooring while they fear, or battle, a two-week viral lung infection (or worse). They will be focused on themselves, their relatives and friends, and their jobs. This will take a long time to recover. I wouldn't touch this company above $20 now and would buy with a long term hold of 2-3 years. Why 20? I see a decline in it's commercial asset value. I see the reduction in sales making Accounts Payable very difficult to manage while wiping out its cash. Receivables will likely have a reduction in collections, and the financing that is sold to a third party will fetch a lower prices as its collection risk goes up. (Its near 30% interest charge for the total sales upon one late or missed payment is so unethical - but that's issue surrounding the company's reputation) The carrying cost of inventory and supply issues are another threat. Despite all this, when we get to the other side of this pandemic, this company will be in the best position to increase market share and sales. For now, I think those analyst are saying one thing publicly for the benefit its large clients. I would trust their opinion now any more than I did their in February."
Sell off this morning was due to Sherwin Williams 4Q miss and FND did not provide any 4Q update at the conference today but they did last year. Source MT newswires.
Nice start. ae 50s
# 16 IBD top 50...........
"I suppose that the Secondary Offering has been completed. For those of us with nothing better to do, now we can get back in and ride it up again over the next few weeks/months."
Does anybody know anything?
could drop 20-22
Agree this is a non issue.
"So we all know that ares sold 7.5 million shares and then there was a 10 million share dilution to get capital to expand growth —- all of which happened around 37$. This which represents a roughly twenty percent amount of shares that must be purchased. Tatiffs, interest rate increases and revised guidance 2018 ...are all near term headwinds. On the positive, more institutional money and funds are clearly taking advantage and buying up cheap shares in the low thirties and high twenties. As the share price decreases, more funds will start buying up larger quanties of shares as evidenced buy the 3+ million volume...P/e is around 18 (I wonder why p/e is always a different number on different sites) whereas other comparable companies are trading in the mid twenties p/eI keep buying into this sellingBe greedy when others are fearfulBased on growth, I will see good return on my investment in 2 weeks or up to 12 months (but I think it will be sooner rather than later)"
looks like it is the attack of the shorts. up 4 percent but down now .60 percent
"I’ll buy when it hits $45-$46 again, assuming the stock price d crease is NOT related to tariffs"
"Being the cheapskate that I am this is starting to seem expensive to me. Any news that would warrant this run up? Maybe it is back in the momo investors good graces , is it back on the ibd hot list?"
Uptrend is intact -- looking good!!!
How is this stock valuation defying economic gravity? Are people spending their unemployment checks on new flooring?
10% tarrifs are irrelevant right now with China currency down 8% in last 4 months. 25% Jan 1 would be a headache. I think trump is posturing. Hopefully.
its Friday let's get back to $48 today.
UBS upgraded FND from neutral to buy.
So we’re does everyone see this stock in the next year or two
Will buy your shares under 30
this stock should be at $40 a share
any news?
Starting to recover. Buying opportunity!!!
Would consider under 30
What’s happening?
$FND Target Raised by Barclays Overweight USD 110 » USD 125 Maintains Goldman Sachs Buy USD 118 » USD 133
Great entry point IMO

"Waiting for a solid bottom to form, but this is finally starting to look interesting price wise."
just add more at 34.38
would love to buy a 1000 shares at $43
"Question -- if FND is trading at $38.45 at close of business on 11/17-- why would the insiders be willing to sell 6,500,000 of common stock at a lower price of $36 and leave $15,925,000 on the table (6,500,000 shared x $2.45)?https://finance.yahoo.com/news/floor-decor-holdings-inc-announces-022500402.html"
Wow...nice!!!
Top remolding and new construction play
"btw 2400 shares and counting at presentgot in a bit early in the low thirties but have been averaging down everytime we hit a lower point hoping to get a chance to get to 3000 share count with an average price around 29I like the big picture here and see it as a great buy in this spot - imagine getting home depot when it first came out....other positives are :drastically oversold equity. Moderate growth. Financing, debt, capital secured already. growing in areas that will need new construction yearly (ie florida). Stealing market share from the big players. potential for buyout. Low P/E. Ceo confirming growth. etc etc"
I just popped over to the insider trading and it was crazy how much selling and no buying was being done by insiders.
"So again, Mgmt looked out for themselves by selling their shares in a secondary offering? Please tell me that I'm wrong and they are not just self-serving......"
"Very bullish movement recently. I see mid 50's soon, possibly $60 by year end. Stay long and strong on this growth stock."
Back to $51
"This company has an outstanding supply chain, with multiple advantages over most competitors. FND is opening another DC this fall that will be sufficient for them to reach 250 units. Moreover, 70% of its warehouse stores receive product directly from vendors. GM% can withstand a few bruises from Trump tweets. I see this as a $8b company within 6 years"
Nobody even looks at this board. This little gem has been performing this whole year.
"Wow, ave volume is only 740,481? I am a LL shareholder and I know FND is reporting tomorrow so I was looking and noticed their ave volume. Seems very low...."
Buying opportunity!!!
Very low volume. Not many people want to sell at this low price. A buying opportunity!!!
Did i tell yah $51 coming?
"glad I jumped, should have jumped two days ago"
"That article has a financial biased. The writer has a shorted-put position. Time is not on his side. I'd talk it up too in that case. That doesn't make the assessment wrong. Just be skeptical. I do agree with the long term view. I will enter at a much lower price than here (currently $46). I agree that FND likely is best suited to handle the supply shock, but going forward I expect inflation to eat into costs as suppliers have less product churn and need to increase costs to break even. I am sorry to say I have a hunch that this virus had too many mutations to get to its current form to have developed naturally. This is obviously not the typical flu. Consumers are not going to be focused on flooring due to the health, consumer behavior, macro and micro -economic impact that we will experience. As soon as there is hope of curtailment along the lines of the polio epidemic of past decades, I will be loading up. The economy will be a coiled spring."
time to turn this back up to the mid 40s.. get on before it takes off again..
Looks like the new Buy point is $36.00
How many quarters of +25% sales growth will be needed before the trend line on this stock is solidly up again?
i love this business but it is WILDLY overvalued here. Did you not see ARES CAPITAL (the majority shareholder that took it public) puking their entire stake at 40??
"this should be around $43 right now...still a great company, though some expenses need to be reviewed..."
Confirmation break out volume.IBD top stock today being bought by funds.A nice future for FND..................................
"nice pick up today, let's keep it going"
that is pretty cheap for a fantastic business model that will double revenues in 4 years and currently trading at sub 20x earnings. They are taking lumber liquidators to school and contractors much prefer these guys to HD and LOW. this business will never be amazoned due to freight logistics and customers wanting to touch and feel. Using the tariff and home fears to stock up. Good priced flooring isn't going out of style. Ares had to take 1/3rd of their great investment off the table of liquidity purposes. They also did this at $37 a share... I believe in 10 years this business will be doing $5B a year with a $500MM operating profit and will eventually be paying a juicy dividend. This is just a great business with only 80 stores and can easily open 500 in USA.
Nothing surprising here. Good business good quarter. How could you short this cash flow machine business model with another 400 cookie cutter stores to open in the US?
Just wow with no reason
let's go 52 today
"Still a good growth story.Import tariffs could be an issue, but all retailers of floor tile and related products will face the same increase in costs, resulting in higher selling prices for all."
"Being an optimist about growth of the hard flooring market, I'd say FND is worth maybe 50% more than it was exactly two years ago, about $65."
This stock is dropping a dollar everyday without any news
FND is just a pump n dump by insiders
"I'm in, but that drop going into the close is making me feel like I should have waited a little longer."
Bought 2000 at $39.50. We'll see what tomorrow brings.
FND performed well today
This is not good but i had a feeling this was camping because the stock was going down for almost a month
wow
"Jesus. From the COVID moment to now, this stock did one thing, and one thing only, bullish... unbelievable... what happens here... Don’t care, I am making money..."
bought at 46.36 sold at 48.06. watched it drop down to 46.60. waiting now
time to buy more
I do remember reading that they may have somehow over-stated revenue related to stores in the Hurricane Harvey damaged areas.
"hurricanes, as bad as they are for people involved in them are great for longs. More sales will be created for home repairs post destruction."
"Insiders just agreed to sell 6,500,000 of common stock of FND at $36.00 per share with an option to sell an additional 975,000 within 30 days at the same price. Therefore, be prepared for pricing pressure down to at least $36.00 if not lower. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/floor-decor-holdings-inc-announces-022500402.html"
Back 38s sold several months ago small profit.I think next year can move high 40s..
"With a terrific quarter, why is FNB down?"
"They just announced a shelf offering of 5,686,000 shares. That's not a good thing."
"Someone inside must have sold high volume, 500k + shares, this morning. Expect a come back to 28-29 by tomorrow."
glad I sold yesterday at 38.93
It's EPS is twice that of LL but it costs 4x as much per share and it isn't growing substantially faster
Nice week.
FND should buy LL.....
time to buy more!!!!
"Interesting pinning action at $120 since just before noon, for what it's worth."
"I'm glad to see the top executives taking steps to share some pain with it's workers. However, the 8-K reported a temporary suspension of full pay for executives and salaried workers. When it went into effect is clear, when it will end or be reviewed is undefined. I understand, no one knows for sure how this pandemic will play out. But I would also like to see that the options will not be repriced as the stock heads lower (and it will - sorry). The good news is that when this is over, much competition will be out of business and demand pent up. The existing options will regain its value. There is no need to reprice at the expense of investors. Investors can't reprice what was paid for the stock, executives and directions shouldn't reprice their options. We are either in this together, or not."
higher volume today while down 7.5%. I think those earlier buyers are starting to get a sense of the severity of the pandemic. I wouldn't touch these shares above 20.
"Here they go, flood the shareholders with more stocks to devalue the current stockholder."
Where's the bottom for FND?
I like this company as a longterm hold. Over the next five years they should see considerable growth. In at $32. Hopefully they will keep opening 20 or so stores a year.
Looks as though FND is bottoming out . Trend should be up from here with over 20% topline growth.
let's get back into the mid 38
"This is a non-dilutive secondary offering since no new shares are created as company said (no selling of shares and not receiving any proceedings). This kind of secondary offering is common in the years following an IPO, after termination of the lock-up period."
"Excellent business model, but brace for impact. Consumer focus on new flooring will be downgraded in a direct inverse relation to consumers concerns on their health, their family’s health, the health of friends and neighbors that are in daily close contact with the old, very young, or physically at risk. Tom may have to take a pay cut. He is compensated as if he is taking this company to the level of his past employer - Home Dept. It ain’t happening. Suggestion, no new stores until this health crisis is under control, preserve cash, reduce consumer financing. The company may have issues with consumer financing, inventory, return on assets, lower inventory churn, administrative costs, covering interest and borrowing. The store many need to go to the capital market when it is least beneficial."
"On July 13th FND is opening a store near me. I signed up to receive emails from FND and gave them my information.Two days ago I received a $25 gift cert. to the grand opening! I also notice that my FB feed gets some FND ads for the grand opening. If this store is anything like the other ones I have been to...it will be AMAZING! Stores are clean, lots of people to help you! I have been adding to my position under $40. As long as the growth is in place, stores comps are good....this has lots of room. Goodluck longs!"
"If investors will pay $70 for quarterly earnings of 7 cents, this company should go to $80 if it earn 8 cents, $90 if it earn 9 cents. Asset valuation is outdated. Dog-pile investing is the future. Robinhood is taking over."
Don’t worry too much about insider selling right now.
Floor & Decor reached an all time high at 102.68
20s on the way.
I love Floor and Decor but the comapany just received the best short idea for Q4 from my broker. Dang. Sorry taking profits here and moving on.
the company is under promising and wants to over deliver when the next earnings report comes out. buys this stock at this low price it's going to go up to $60 in the next quarter.
The resilience of this stock is tremendous!
don't fretEverything will be fine....
Another secondary offering to temporarily rain on the recent parade. Gotta keep thinking LONG to make it with this one.
THIS STOCK WAS ZERO! APRIL 2016? EXPLAIN THAT.
"Everything seems to look okay with the earnings report except for that operating margin drop of 40 basis points, what's up with that?"
This is an excellent earning report. I don't understand the negative reaction?
To the moon Alice!
Nice beat on both top and bottom lines.
holding on...
Mostly positive article on FND from Seeking Alpha - https://seekingalpha.com/article/4329867-retail-flooring-winners-and-losers
Great 1st qtr earnings!
Could go back over $35 too.
"Piper Jaffray lowers price target of FND. They say luxury vinyl tile is taking share and Home Depot is targeting that product. However, FND still can expand LVT as category expands.Also, this PJ thesis forgot to discuss Nationwide expansion potential for FND. It is monumental. FND can add stores adjacent to HD and Lowe’s, for the next 20 years and capture half of the competition’s business. Whereas, HD and Lowe’s has already saturated the nationwide landscape. FND, managed by mostly X Home Depot executives, know how to grow quickly and be profitable at the same time.I wouldn’t be surprised if HD or Lowe’s tries to buy them out in a year or so. Plenty of open building retail space nationwide for FND to expand!!"
earnings?
Another 3M shares issued by FND this quarter. Where is management's faith in the company!?
Who can please explain why the stock is down?
Any news regarding today's drop?
if China is smart they will try to negotiate with trump. it seems to be hurting them more
down today because of secondary offering?
what a great bounce back
"Look at those Executive salaries. Are any of these folks worth $Millions per year? I doubt it...Stock has done nothing but follow the home improvement trend....They have not done anything beyond the average of other home improvement stocks....""a rising tide lifts all the boats"""
