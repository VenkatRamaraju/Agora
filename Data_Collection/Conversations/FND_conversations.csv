I just popped over to the insider trading and it was crazy how much selling and no buying was being done by insiders.
"In the earning conference call, their sales actually declined by 46% during lock downhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4341867-floor-decor-holdings-inc-fnd-ceo-thomas-taylor-on-q1-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single"
Thoughts on supply chain issues? Big impact to margin or has FND mitigated.
that is pretty cheap for a fantastic business model that will double revenues in 4 years and currently trading at sub 20x earnings. They are taking lumber liquidators to school and contractors much prefer these guys to HD and LOW. this business will never be amazoned due to freight logistics and customers wanting to touch and feel. Using the tariff and home fears to stock up. Good priced flooring isn't going out of style. Ares had to take 1/3rd of their great investment off the table of liquidity purposes. They also did this at $37 a share... I believe in 10 years this business will be doing $5B a year with a $500MM operating profit and will eventually be paying a juicy dividend. This is just a great business with only 80 stores and can easily open 500 in USA.
"I'm glad to see the top executives taking steps to share some pain with it's workers. However, the 8-K reported a temporary suspension of full pay for executives and salaried workers. When it went into effect is clear, when it will end or be reviewed is undefined. I understand, no one knows for sure how this pandemic will play out. But I would also like to see that the options will not be repriced as the stock heads lower (and it will - sorry). The good news is that when this is over, much competition will be out of business and demand pent up. The existing options will regain its value. There is no need to reprice at the expense of investors. Investors can't reprice what was paid for the stock, executives and directions shouldn't reprice their options. We are either in this together, or not."
The guys beat forecasts with amazing results again.Net sales increased 86.0% from the second quarter of fiscal 2020 to $860.1 million.Comparable store sales increased 68.4% from the second quarter of fiscal 2020.Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) increased 156.7% to $0.77 from $0.30 in the second quarter of fiscal 2020; Adjusted diluted EPS* increased 461.5% to $0.73 from $0.13 in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
"Today FND was downgraded by an analyst who said the housing market is slowing, and doesn't see any upside from here. She gave a 12 month price target of $44. Yet today, the stock is trading over the 12 month target. This is the second downgrade for FND in as many days."
Bought 2000 at $39.50. We'll see what tomorrow brings.

Nothing surprising here. Good business good quarter. How could you short this cash flow machine business model with another 400 cookie cutter stores to open in the US?
Another 3M shares issued by FND this quarter. Where is management's faith in the company!?
This is an excellent earning report. I don't understand the negative reaction?
20s on the way.
"Still a good growth story.Import tariffs could be an issue, but all retailers of floor tile and related products will face the same increase in costs, resulting in higher selling prices for all."
"The institutional investors of this stock have historically been quite happy to hold at these PE ratios. Since analyst estimates of YoY quarterly improvements are huge, I think it would be a mistake to short and this time. Unless, the stock price skyrockets prior to earnings."
"hurricanes, as bad as they are for people involved in them are great for longs. More sales will be created for home repairs post destruction."
12% up after the close is great but any idea why?
