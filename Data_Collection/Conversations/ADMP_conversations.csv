"E. Kevin...Because you asked...May 24, 2021 NT 10/Q/A; Amendment to a previously filed NT 10-Q...marc, doug, stemcell, you may want to look away as the following points out a company RISK which I know you don't like to discuss nor acknowledge...https://ir.adamispharmaceuticals.com/static-files/bb89b692-3472-42bf-a219-8dd2a02be3e1""On May 11, 2021, each of the Company and its US Compounding Inc. subsidiary received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York issued in connection with a criminal investigation, requesting a broad range of documents and materials relating to, among other matters, certain veterinary products sold by the Company’s USC subsidiary, certain practices, agreements and arrangements relating to products sold by USC, including veterinary products, and certain regulatory and other matters relating to the Company and USC. The Audit Committee has engaged outside counsel to conduct an independent internal investigation to review these and other matters. The internal investigation is ongoing and the Company cannot predict its duration or outcome. The Company intends to cooperate fully with the U.S. Attorney’s Office. At this time, the Company is unable to determine what, if any, action the U.S. Attorney’s Office or other federal or state authorities may take, what, if any, remedial measures the U.S. Attorney’s Office may seek, and what, if any, impact the foregoing matters may have on USC’s and the Company’s previously reported financial results, financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2021 or future financial results. This matter may divert management’s attention, cause the Company to suffer reputational harm, require the Company to devote significant financial resources, subject the Company and its officers and directors to civil or criminal proceedings, and depending on the resolutionof the matter, result in fines, penalties, equitable remedies, and affect the Company’s previously reported financial results, financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2021 or future financial results. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations."""
"ZIM-Hidey-Hidey-Hidey-HI; ADMP Sports Three Mile Smile As FDAFinally Approves Naloxone AssetFDA has approved ADMP’s ZIMHI, a high-dose naloxone injectable for use in the treatmentof opioid overdose, almost a month sooner than the target action date of November 12. Theapproval follows launch of a competing high dose naloxone launch back in August, Hikma’sintranasal KLOXADDO, while ZIMHI can be dosed either intramuscularly or subcutaneously.Though the number of opioid prescriptions has decreased substantially, the number of overdoserelated deaths has risen, largely due to the potent synthetic opioid, fentanyl, promptingcontinued development in the opioid antagonist space as well as regulatory efforts to boostutilization. ZIMHI utilizes a high dose of naloxone (5mg/0.5mL) and injectable delivery which mayprovide an advantage given rapid toxicity of fentanyl.Though total prescription opioid Rx volumes have decreased significantly over the past six years,declining nearly 45%, the naloxone market has grown significantly driven largely by Narcan(intranasal naloxone) which is expected to generate between $300M-$325M in 2021 sales.Fentanyl Related Overdoses Requiring Multiple Naloxone DosesDespite the sharp decrease in overall prescription opioids, the number of fatalities attributableto opioids has gone in the opposite direction, more than doubling over the same period. Thelatest CDC data for March 2021 shows a nearly 30% y/y increase in prescription opioid fatalitiesreaching record levels of just under 97,000 total deaths. The vast majority of increases in fatalities,despite substantial curtailment in Rx opioid supply, is tied to growth in usage of synthetic opioids,including fentanyl, which are now implicated in 80% of opioid fatalities vs. 25% back in 2015. Theadvent of synthetic opioids has necessitated the use of two or more doses of Narcan (naloxone)to treat fentanyl overdose in over 80% of cases. ZIMHI injectable high-dose naloxone could offera dosing advantage given the rapid toxicity effects seen with fentanyl requiring higher doses ofnaloxone as early as possible to out-compete the opioid binding sites occupied by fentanyl.Regulatory Environment Increasingly Pro-NaloxoneOn April 5, 2018, the Surgeon General of the U. S Public Health Service took the unprecedentedstep of releasing a health advisory on urging the expansion of the use and access for naloxone, anopioid antagonist, to counter the ongoing opioid epidemic. In July 2020, FDA took another stepto address the U.S. opioid issue by announcing it is requiring labeling changes for opioid painrelated medicines to recommend that as a routine part of prescribing these medicines, healthcareprofessionals should discuss the availability of naloxone with patients as well as caregivers.While FDA hasn’t yet opted for any co-prescribing of naloxone, if the agency simply limits labeledrecommended co-prescribing of naloxone with opioids to just the most at-risk patients, it wouldstill likely trigger a substantial expansion of the current U.S. naloxone market.Over the past 12 months, there were approximately 165M opioid prescriptions dispensed in theU.S., down 40% from 2013 levels. Even if just 20% of those prescribed Rx opioids are considered tobe at-risk and thus recommended to receive co-prescription of naloxone, and only 25% of thoseactually filled the recommended co-prescription, the current size of the naloxone market would"

FDA Approval and 15% gain only. It is because profit takers are out for now. But they will be back and buy at higher prices!
"So far no talk about the so-called ""milestone payment"" for getting approval--hopefully their will be some news coming--my hunch however is that they may drag things out a bit. One reason is to get more mileage from the approval event--or just to avoid any financial statements regarding exact monies until the investigation has been flushed. Company is better off, have 1 less thing to worry about, relatively speaking this is the closest we've been to ""all good"" in quite some time. Happy."

"Stock is looking to hold $1.00 price and then you can bet it goes much lower. Tempol probably gets approval after the pandemic is over and will take Carlo several years to find someone to sell it. Really not much hope for the company now, especially when our great CEO decides to dilute us stockholders by issuing more stock. How low can it go?"
"Just want to set board expectations...To my own, that is... :-)Company hasn't presented quarterly reports since EOY 2020 and is in violation of Nasdaq rules; they have been notified and (initial) compliance dates have been set.Now, when those quarterly reports are made available (I am presuming they WILL before delisting), I am NOT expecting the shareprice to rise much (if at all). Reason being, submission of quarterly reports is a necessary exercise, mandated by Nasdaq and expected from all publicly companies. Satisfaction of this requirement is NOT a positive achievement---rather, it is a remedy of a previous (egregious) mess. If anything, supplying financials will hopefully STABILIZE the shareprice and allow OTHER achievements (i.e. Zimhi approval) to have the (positive) impact they are due. FYI, the CONTENT of the financials may certainly impact the shareprice (up or down), but simply supplying those reports won't likely move the shareprice, IN MY OPINION/EXPECTATION.If you get so drunk you pee on the rug...You shouldn't be rewarded for cleaning it up in the morning! (You still peed on the rug, after all). :-)"

I just wonder if every ambulance across America will carry a Symjepi naloxone cartridge needle for the crisis ?? That would be serious sales alone !! Shelf life is long too six months !
"The fact is, so many people have lost so much money betting on this stock mainly due to management incompetence for decades, it is hard to regain that trust.People are not willing to bid up. Tempol actually needs to be EUA or gets closer to EUA in order for the stock to move meaningfully higher.Tempol trial positive results will not alone move the stock much."
Warren Buffett always says “Buy when there is fear on the street”It’s a very famous statement!
"SAN DIEGO, Oct. 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Nasdaq: ADMP) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Adamis’ ZIMHI (naloxone HCL Injection, USP) 5 mg/0.5 mL product. ZIMHI is a high-dose naloxone injection product FDA-approved for use in the treatment of opioid overdose...........[ Market manipulation working overtime to keep this STOCK PRICE down unfortunately.......COULD the shorts trying to bring it in... and they are losing the battle & eventually the war........ ]"
Hows the Earning Call for today?
"My research, The website is very impressive for tempol trial:https://earlycovidstudy.com/"
"Global Covid cases and deaths rise for the first time in two months, WHO saysCovid-19 cases and deaths are climbing across the world for the first time in two months as the virus surges across Europe, World Health Organization officials said at a briefing Thursday.After weeks of decline, infections in Europe have risen over the last three consecutive weeks, even as cases fall in every other region across the world, according to WHO. There were nearly 3 million new Covid cases reported worldwide for the week ended Sunday, an increase of 4% from the previous seven days, according to WHO's most recent epidemiological update."
"On the SEC website you can find the old news from August 24th about regaining compliance. The 8-K states: ""On August 20, 2021, Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (the “Company”) received a notification letter (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”), which was expected by the Company, notifying the Company that because the Company has not filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2021, as well as its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2021 (the “Form 10-Qs”), the Company does not comply with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). In response to a previous notification letter from NASDAQ relating to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2021, the Company has previously submitted to NASDAQ a plan to regain compliance. In connection with its review of the plan, NASDAQ has requested that the Company submit an updated plan to regain compliance. The Notice indicated that if NASDAQ accepts the plan, NASDAQ may grant an exception of up to November 22, 2021, to regain compliance. If an exception is granted, the Company may regain compliance at any time during the permitted period upon filing the Form 10-Qs with the SEC, as well as any other required periodic reports that are due within that period. If NASDAQ does not accept the Company’s plan, the Company will have the opportunity to appeal that decision to a NASDAQ Hearings Panel.""In other words, ADMP has submitted their updated plan by now (or they would have been delisted already) and we should expect the company, now with Hopkins out and Benedicto now as CFO, that they will file a 10-Q prior to the Nov 22 deadline in order to regain compliance. If not, the board of directors would be sabotaging their own stock value and future prospects on other boards as the company gets delisted let alone investors. No board or corporate management in their right mind or with any sense of self-preservation would fail to take care of this compliance issue so I'm expecting ADMP to do what it takes to regain compliance in the next four weeks, likely by the anticipated ER date.If we get close to Nov 22 and no compliance yet, then it will be time to bail. Until then, I'm expecting a regain of compliance and the resulting stock value that comes with it."
Second day holding at 1.04. Looks like shorts couldn’t short anymore
"Lets have a vote --How many of you folks would rather have earnings issued blinded ,where they have to restate earnings and LAW SUITS ,hit and cost millions, or earnings issued with wisdom ,and it protects the long and smart investor ,anyway put ,I commend management in their decision. Vote thumbs up for wisdom ,thumbs down siding with Johnny and Lambrusky !!!! This is gonna be fun investors !!!!!!!"
128 million shares traded. I want to see 150 today and tomorrow.
Once this takes off I hope it attracts a higher quality of shills and bears. The ones in here now are just sub par at best.
$2 share price would be almost $300M market cap. Generic naxalone costs about $40 per shot but two packs of non-generics are $125 to $178 for a two pack. If ADMP were only selling Zimhi that would work out to selling 7.5M doses at $40. Larger market than that and ADMP has other drugs in the pipeline. IMHO the share price should be much higher on this news than where it is right this minute
"I am a retired old coot having fun buying low and selling high as everyone screams HOLD, SELL, BUY, SHORTS, and calls each other names. I like this company and I am accumulating shares as I do my thing here. I am now at an effective price of $0.51/share and a yield of 33% for this venture if I were to sell all my shares now. Next 30% sale at $1.77, and next buyback in at $1.23. It is strange to me that people will get mad at me for this post. What ever happened to ""Live and Let Live""? I have the Gift of the Pep talk, and it seems I might get greased for it!"
"I would love to see some order to buy Tempol pills like Hertz order buy 100,000 Tesla cars"
"Okay, weeded thru some of the press releases and SEC filings...For your INFORMATION and (for some) ""entertainment"". Apologies for the lengthiness. If you REALLY do care about your investment in this company you will take the time to read this (I did a lot of work for you).March 31, 2021, 10-K: Notice that form 10-K (2020 annual) would be filed late. For the record, the 10-K was filed on April 15th but ""...the reasons why Forms 10-K,...could not be filed within the prescribed time period... because it needs additional time to prepare and review certain information and complete its review of its financial statements and other disclosures in the Form 10-K, including without limitation regarding matters relating to warrant liability expense and change in fair value of warrants and the assessment of the impairment of its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and the audit procedures related to the foregoing, which could not be completed by the date required without incurring unreasonable effort and expense."" So, unable to file 10-K on time because of inability to cost warrant liability expense and good will intangible assets. These need to be addressed by virtually EVERY public company of similar size! Anyway, moving on...May 11, 2021 Adamis ""…received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York issued in connection with a criminal investigation, requesting a broad range of documents and materials relating to, among other matters, certain veterinary products sold by USC, certain practices, agreements and arrangements relating to products sold by USC…” Now pay close attention to the following: “…The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company has engaged outside counsel to conduct an independent internal investigation to review these and other matters. The internal investigation is ongoing and the Company cannot predict its duration or outcome. The independent investigation includes matters that could, depending on the outcome of the investigation, affect the Company’s financial statements to be included in the Form 10-Q and other disclosures in the Form 10-Q. As a result, the Company will not be able, without unreasonable effort or expense, to timely file the Form 10-Q by the deadline prescribed by applicable securities laws.”The AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS has engaged OUTSIDE COUNSEL … TO REVIEW THESE AND OTHER MATTERS. Following, on Aug 24, 2021 the CFO “leaves”.On Sep 7, 2021, Roshawn Blunt, an AUDIT COMMITTEE MEMBER OF THE BOD, RESIGNS! To summarize, 10-K late because of inability to cost warrants and goodwill…All subsequent 10-Q not filed with risk of delisting…Outside counsel to conduct an independent review…CFO leaves…A BOD Audit Committee member leaves. All of these are FACTS! (Look them up or yourselves). Now, I won’t post all my opinions or conclusions in this post, but ask yourself if this appears to be a company run by (ahem) “wisdom”? Or does it appear to be an absolute MESS? Go ahead, vote again."
Sesn got denied by the FDA and its trading at 1.18 with no product on the market. This stock has two useful products. Should be at $5.
"Tempol trial will be a long, painful wait for shareholders and the end will break hearts.Mark this post."
"The problem with Adamis' business model is - their products are ""me-too"" generic. There is no innovation, no sophistication and the products aren't meaningfully cheap compared to generics either. It appears that opportunity cost is just too much. The outstanding share count went from about 30 million in early 2017 to now 173 million (including warrants). During the same period, the revenue decelerated and with USC being sold and Symjepi is only product with revenue. Symjepi revenue last year was $2.3 M. I doubt it is more than $3 M this year.During the same period (2017- 2021), the management compensation has gone up considerably. To me, the business model is clearly favorable to management team's welfare and very bad for the long term shareholders."
A stock with FDA approval goes down to pre-approval levels ? Nah ... Something doesn't match. Keep an eye on this stock.
"The Tempol Covid-19 trial is a SHAM because the company knows too well that vaccines and competition for participants (in other covid trials) will make it harder for Adamis to complete the trial in timely manner in order to obtain EUA. Without EUA, Tempol will add $0 value to the stock price for the foreseeable future. IMO Tempol which acquired license for only $250,000 is just a side show created to distract shareholders from the real issues such as - Symjepi commercialization failure, USC losses. Carlo knows Symjepi and Zimhi is not enough to support even $100M market cap given all the headwinds they face in the commercial market.Tempol is such a lame attempt by the management team to try to inflate the value of this company. It's an illusion. Who gives away a potential blockbuster for only $250,000 upfront license fee? ITS A SHAM."

https://www.ott.nih.gov/news/collaboration-opportunity-for-covid-19-therapeuticPosted October 8th. What am I missing here? Why isn't NIH collaborating the only company that has been cleared by FDA for human clinical trials to evaluate Tempol as a treatment for COVID-19????
For facts set strait —I read about tempol the merits of the Antibodies for two days worth of investigating all property’s of the drug and anybody that reads it should not sell period !!! It is an amazing find !! I had infusion of antibodies for my covid and it seems to be the norm in fighting covid and all other viral infections ! In future Wished I had tempol it has got to be like tnt against what is out there !! Read and don’t sell ! The big boys know something or they would not own ! Raymond James brought in lots of em !!
"Well, that was a nice Monday morning surprise. (Anything positive is a surprise with this company.)For the bashers posting about pending dilution, you sound silly and desperate. OF COURSE, future dilution is necessary and (should be) expected! The GOOD news is that dilution will now take place at a higher price than if there was no approval. (Of course company needs to get their financial reports in order as Patrick, et al have noted). Regardless, dilution posts should now be considered POSITIVE posts; better to raise money for COMMERCIALIZATION than simply to keep the lights on."
"Been catching up on all of the posts and I think we can all agree that past mismanagement has been a problem. What makes me cautiously hopeful that they are finally addressing the issues through replacing the CFO and apparently making progress sorting through the mess. I will be surprised if the corporate management did all of this to put on a show that still results in delisting due to non-compliance. Also, they will be motivated to clean up their act should they want ADMP to get bought out. In summary, management has a poor track record and laid face down on the pavement for awhile before starting to pick themselves back up. If nothing substantial happens by the assumed Nov 22 compliance deadline, I'll sell then."
"Lambrusky there is your answer u own it at three bucks which is high ! Also u say u been in it longer than me ! I was in it before it became admp !! How long is that ?? celegy days that how long !! Sold lost my Fanny but had profits in other stocks ! Bought and sold this a long time my friend ! Richard Williams was CEO ! Talked to Richard several times !! He is a smart guy !! Has a lot of good back ground ! I own it now at around $1.10 !! I think u will be able to get out or make aLittle even at three bucks ! I can tell u things about this company that nobody can !! I have got to defend one thing #1 it has always given earnings ! I really can not ever remember them not giving earnings even when it was a shell company !! Their whole strategy from day one after Cellegy days was to do packaging also work with drugs not needing to go thru a fda process !! Actually use generic drugs or already approved drugs like naloxone !! What they have done along the way is find other uses for other drugs !! They did this with the old Celegy ! We got some items that could be sold and generate some cash , but who knows how much ? Tempol is a very interesting drug that is not hype , or bogus ! This company has spent money but nothing compared to most !! There is no guarantees but in my opinion it is a strong hold and could easily get to five plus bucks !! If I were u , don’t sell !! The company is about to get interesting !! Lots of big money is watching closely !! If we get some cash flow we also have a foam contraceptive I think can be a great cash flow ! That has been in our closet for over ten yrs !"

I simply cannot believe what I saw... A 7 cent increase for a live saving FDA approval...During a community drug crisis. Simply amazing.
