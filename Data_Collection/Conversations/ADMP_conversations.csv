"I am expecting some resolution to their legal problems and a filing of the Delayed ER any day now. Why ? Because they need to get a Stock Offering done ASAP to get their hands on some money to keep the company afloat. Oh yea, I think they are betting the house on a risky Tempol that nobody else could manage to get traction for a variety of possible breakthrough ailments."

"Global ownership of tempol, this means one of 2 things will happen. A buyout or an ungodly growth in earnings. We're likely to get an emergency use authorization is my guess that's why our enrollment is so much larger than others."
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
"Tempol may be promising but it does NOT have composition of material patent. And it will not get FDA exclusivity. Without NME/NCE exclusivity, Tempol is worth $0 to Adamis.Tempol trial is basically a SHAM to help extend Carlo ripoff regime."
"Wondering, if the minor move in the share price on what would be considered positive news, is a reflection investors believe in the of lack of confidence they have in admp management to get anything right."

"Guys, there is a cloud of uncertainty hanging over this stock due to 1. Grand Jury Subpoena related to criminal investigation of it's USC animal health division. IF found guilty, Adamis will have to pay fines, penalties and potential face civil lawsuits . IF that happens, ADMP stock will be down to $0.15 or lower. DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THIS RISK.2. Symjepi is a failed product. Next to $0 revenue 4 years after the FDA approval.3. Zimhi is pretty much like Symjepi. It will be a failure.4. Tempol is a wild card. Don't forget it is a GENERIC drug.

What’s making ADMP getting a bid? Maybe a announcement that the great CEO Carlo is going to retire! Would that be great news and possibly give the Company at last several more quarters to find a competent leader.
Possibly some PR today..... 
VOLUME speaks Volumes
"The way Merck's (MRK -0.8%) antiviral COVID-19 pill molnupiravir works to destroy the SARS-CoV-2 virus, may present risks that are being underestimated, Barron's reports.According to the financial newspaper, molnupiravir embeds itself into the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, leading to a large number of mutations during virus replications, which ends up the killing of the virus.However, some labs tests have shown the ability of the drug to find its way into the genetic material of mammalian cells. Because the drug causes mutations, it could, in theory, lead to birth defects or cancer.""Given the possibility that the drug could be incorporated into cellular DNA, it will be very important to demonstrate a lack of cancer in animal models and in humans,"" Nathaniel Landau, a professor of microbiology at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, told Barron's. Merck (NYSE:MRK) says animal tests it has conducted indicate that these concerns are unwarranted.Last week, Merck released data showing that molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death from COVID-19 by 50%.from Seeking Alpha - Tempol just to be effective"

"Vaccines do prevent hospitalizations in almost 100% cases.There will be multiple treatments approved for Covid-19 by the time Tempol could ever get to phase-3.By the time Tempol phase-3 trial is complete, the pandemic will be OVER and vaccination rate will be almost 80% to 90% and herd immunity will kick in.Sorry, Tempol. Party is over."
"Reminder - Adamis paid $250,000 upfront money to Matrix to license Tempol for use in variety of indications including Covid-19. All for only $250,000 upfront. Basically a magic pill for free. GO FIGURE."
The price positive after hour is telling some good news
Lol it's fun to come here and see the dumpster fore that is John freaking out about the naked calls he sold  $50+ on tempol buddy  hope you spent that premium well
Six days already
"Was Carlo punished for the USC acquisition? A glowing Carlo in 2016:""Dr. Dennis J. Carlo, President and CEO of Adamis, stated, “USC will be a compelling addition for Adamis. We believe the combination of revenues of $20 million or greater in each of the last two years, a large sales and marketing team and robust manufacturing capabilities, will be both synergistic with and accretive to Adamis’ overall value. We expect the new division will generate at least $5 million in operating income over the first 12 months and achieve an annualized run rate of $50 million per year within 24 months after closing.”"

It is really puzzling to me how ADMP has not been able to complete the NY AG's subpoena process. HOOD for example received a subpoena back in April 2021 and yet they had financials out in August. Not the case for ADMP--they received their subpoena in May 2021. So will this be the quarter that the company gets caught up?
Adamis may miss the chance because the Covid Counts Are dropping like crazy now
@tdc ADMP stock price is pulling away from your IQ. You need to raise your IQ. 0.27 IS WAY TOO LOW.

Hello? Is there anybody buying this stock besides David Einhorn?
Steve:How does Bank of America know what numbers ADMP will report when Carlo himself doesn’t even know!The new CFO hopefully will get the accounting problems resolved and the company will be in compliance with the stock exchange. There’s always a first for ADMP to show a profit.
"Adamis Highlights National Institutes of Health (NIH) Article Entitled, “Tempol: A Potential Home Treatment for COVID-19”"
New CFO sounds positive. Anything right now sounds positive
Sorry to say this but Tempol potential FDA approval is at least 2 years away if the trial is successful.Phase-3 trial won't be complete until Q3/2022. I know the stock will surge on positive phase-2 data but that trial will take at least 6 months to report the data.

Everyone is getting canned, Veterinary is completely shut down, employee severences need to be paid, financial advisors, etc. I bet the net cost of shutting it down will be more than the sale proceeds, but it is impossible to tell reading this.Carlo is getting bonuses after this unbelieveble blunder?https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/887247/000138713121008161/admp-8k_073021.htm"
Tomorrow is the last day of testing phase 3. No incident so far Otherwise we would know it already
Are you comfortable in waiting a year for results on Tempol trials ?
Game OVER Tempol. Straight into gutter goes Tempol.Dr. Scott Gottlieb says Merck’s Covid pill ‘can make a real difference’.https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/11/dr-scott-gottlieb-says-mercks-covid-pill-can-make-a-real-difference.html
Global gains plus governments stockpiling the stuff when we show positive results. I don't think people understand how massive the potential is for this company is.
"I cannot blame anyone for selling this worthless stock. We have been waiting years and months for a new drug approved by the FDA. I guess the new CFO cannot figure out the financial numbers for the first two (2) quarters of 2021. You can bet they mustn’t be good or our fearless leader (Carlo) would have announced them already. Maybe by year end we just might get some numbers, some us keep this stock laughs. Carlo should start a class teaching management 101!"
Labriausco. Click click. Muted. Had about enough of that.  
dont we all expect this to drop below $1.00 once earnings are announced???
Ok so definitely room for more than one drug. Especially one with greater efficacy. I have an especially good feeling about this. What are some price predictions if the trial went extremely well considering this is not a major pharmaceutical like the likes of Phizer and Merck....
"Looks like Carlo is trying to run the stock up with all these announcements. Yahoo shows earnings to be announced in five (5) days, this will be the third time they have posted a date and no numbers. Looks like the stock volume has picked up again and a lot of first time starters are taking a chance on ADMP coming through with a drug that the FDA will give approval to. I hope they are right but we long time stockholders have seen our hopes not get out of the starting gate! Just maybe a miracle will happen."

this has happened many time! let's hope it stays up!

IF Tempol was such a magic drug and studied for variety of indications for 50 years then why didn't any of the big pharma jump on it and did human trials on it ? They spend billions of dollars on research and development each year. They could have easily done human clinical trials using Tempol but they didn't.Why? Tempol does not have chemical composition of matter patent.

"Is it too much to ask Carlo and the newly legitimized BOD to mention something about filing earnings, or at least when they think they will? They have a new CFO. What do you suppose he is working on? It certainly makes the CFO's life easier if they don't have to worry about pesky SEC regulations. Since there is no SEC scrutiny, I hope the top execs are at least getting much better bonuses for a job well done. At Carlo's age, he needs that money right away, not a year down the road when he might not be unable to enjoy it. Also do you think the company has a succession plan, in case of the unexpected situation where Carlo may be not fit to continue, for example comatose in a hospital or memory care facility? It can be difficult to remove someone in these cases and hire a new CEO. That could be expensive as well and with Carlo's big bonuses, there may be no money left for a new hire. A couple other CEO candidates/consultants on the BOD are Carlo's age as well, so they might not be great candidates. It seems a substantial fraction of the BOD and management were born before or during WWII, which explains their expertise in high tech."
Any bets in days until ER? The line is 21.

(http://Thetraderguide.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
"The company has again not showed a date when numbers will be announced for the 1st and 2nd quarters. Their website is next to nothing and is a waste of stockholders money. Just think we are paying that great CEO Carlo a million dollars a year for what? The Vice President of finance cannot show accurate numbers and the other management team should a ashamed. I keep hoping for a miracle, it surely hasn’t happened yet. Time is running out and so is our money!"
"Lets put a what if into the conversation, say the newest tests that ADMP is involved with just how long after the data is acquired and proved out to be successful how long would it take for the FDA/NIH to approve ADMP vaccine to be used for the masses?.."
just got 7340 shares 
"All early lab results and studies have been positive pre human dosing. If this positivity continues as planned this could start to steamroll very soon. People who don’t know about the CEO, and lack of earning reports will flood this thing. At that point nothing will matter except the fact that Tempol actually works! Everything else will become irrelevant. $$$"
Something is going on. Could somebody tell me?
https://fintel.io/so/us/admpThe instituition is buying today.
8% move up AH based on what again? No report and another extension request? What is it with this company???
"Bears losing their minds because evergrande didn't crash the global market lmao. Wonder how many dirt cheap calls they sold covered or not. Even just as a therapeutic tempol takes the cake, treats all symptoms and prevents hospitalization with no need to change for specific variants unlike all other treatments being pushed. Those Penny credits are going to bankrupt people for being overbearish."
"I think that if the Adamis ""TEMPOL"" is shown to work then one of the Large Vaccine companies, such a Pfizer, Moderna ,Novavax etc will look to either buy or licence TEMPOL. Just a supposition on my part. Not sure what best route would be for Adamis."
"Looks like my calls got wrecked lol, riding them out until they die then. People saying 1-5 aren't grasping the magnitude of growth from tempol alone. Normally I'd be worried but it's effects on cytokine storms aside from antiviral effects will make it a standard for covid to prevent hospitalization which is what the trials are based on."

Nothing good will happen to Admp stock price until the legal matters are taken care of and an ER is filed.
"Molnupiravir would become a kind of Tamiflu for Covid-19, a medication that can be dispensed to patients when they first develop symptoms, slowing the spread of the virus in the body and potentially preventing people from becoming seriously ill."
"Anybody who watched Dr. Ron Moss (Adamis CMO) presentation on Tempol at a conference will know this - Tempol is easy to manufacture, has no composition of material patents and doubtful Adamis will get exclusivity.If Adamis does not get FDA exclusivity then generics can bring copies of Tempol to market within 6 months after Adamis gets approval."
"Amazing how the earning date keeps moving out. By the time the results are provided another Quarter will have passed. Does anyone see any hope for this company? I'm so far in the hole on this investment, I'll probably have to use it as a write off by year's end."
"Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (ADMP) has announced that their New Drug Application (NDA) for ZIMHI (a higher naloxone injection product candidate for the treatment of opioid overdose) has been accepted for review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The target action date provided by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA date) is November 12, 2021."
"This whole Tempol thing is just crazy.NIH did in-vitro studies and now they are talking about doing animal studies.On the other hand, Adamis is doing human clinical trials.That explains why the ADMP stock is not moving at all ON ANY news related to Tempol.Reminder - the company was valued at $235M in late January this year without NIH findings of Tempol, without trial progress. Now the company is worth $100 M less despite NIH endorsement, Trial start and closer to Zimhi approval ?It must be grand jury subpoena overhang. Markets don't like uncertainty. They want resolution either way quickly. Dennis Carlo has a shady past. He's done a bunch of questionable licensing deals in the past and he has nothing to show for it. Still diluting, still misleading, deceiving, lying to shareholders."
"Charlie:You are right on , timing is everything trying to bring a new drug to market. The FDA approved SYMJEPI while there was bad press in the cost and the production of EpiPen made by Mylan labs. For two years our product could have taken market share, but Carlo said we needed the right partner to handle the sales. And we all saw what happened. After two years Teva had a generic drug like ours and there went our opportunity!Now we are waiting almost 1-2 years to get Zimhi approved and don’t be surprised if a bigger company comes along and gets approval before we do. Then we are hanging out future on Tempol and if past experiences are a sign of things to come, we are in trouble. But let’s hope the FDA sees the need for these two Drugs. As shareholders we wish for the best but our money and time is running out!"
Can adamis beat 50% Effective?
"I think Adamis will get thru phase-2 Tempol Covid-19 trial. But.........it will be impossible to complete the phase-3 trial.The phase-3 trial will take much longer than phase-2 trial since they will need to find 250 Unvaccinated patients to enroll starting Q2/2022.I think Phase-3 trial will take approx. 8-9 months to complete. So, do not expect to see phase-3 results before end of 2022.It is a simple equation - if 50 patient phase-2 trial will take 6 months to complete and report data, it will take roughly a year to complete phase-3 data.Good luck Adamis finding those unvaccinated people next year when vaccine mandate kicks in.JohnFord has never been wrong on Adamis.Carlo is a con artist. He will suck shareholders dry.Watch."
Two Indian drugmakers to end trials of generic Merck pill for moderate COVID-19By Shivani Singh and Anuron
BULLISH
No incident with real Covid patients is a good news in my opinion
"Yahoo finance shows that earnings are to be announced today. This will be the second try to get a accurate date. What are the chances that anything will be reported ? We should be used to the same old promises from this terrible management team, but I’m sure our great CEO ( Carlo) will tell us we have a great future as long as we don’t run out of money! But don’t worry he will issue more stock to assure he keeps getting that $1 million pay. Let’s hope for a miracle and news that just might give us stockholders some promise!"
What's going on with ADMP?
"I have NO FAITH in CDC / NIH --- ""?"" in BIG PHARAMA'S BACK POCKET - LIKE CHINA and STOCKS - - - like recommending the 5 best strains of Covid to expose yourself to....... BUY ADMP ""American Drug Co."" with a PILL that WORKS especially for THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES --and NO RUSH BY CDC or NIH - - -really"
"Honestly, i believe Tempol gimmick was spun out by Carlo in order to distract shareholders away from the real issues which Carlo knows he is not capable of fixing.Issues like - no sales revenue for decades and Symjepi is no exception. Symjepi is a failed product even with a new partner. Manual injection is a hard sell in the world that prefers autoinjectors. Carlo duped investors.Add USC disaster to that. Remember, Carlo blatantly lied to shareholders in 2016 about ""$50 M revenue run rate after 24 months of closing the USC acquisition"". Rest is history.I believe 3rd CRL must be on the way for Zimhi.Carlo is a con artist at best."
Apparently @john is already feeling the squeeze based on his recent posts.
"Tempol is ... too little too late. Sorry, no upside. Downside is - 50 million share dilution that Carlo did in February this year. It's gonna bite shareholders next year FOR SURE."
"Looking forward to hopefully upcoming test results in November, another delay of any type wouldn't be good."
Can we all enjoy the fact some retail short kept trying to sell after hours 1 share at a time to make it look red and someone did the opposite  we closed up a penny lmao

"Must be US Compounding being sold & closing is causing these delayed earnings,whatever it is ,the SEC,is aware of the problem and are abiding the time frame, on delayed earnings ,it would not have if there was anything serious !"
Serious question:. How many consecutive quarters with no earnings report before they are delisted or whatever?
Someone that bought 20k for $1.00 must be a trader and not a long term investor. This company has lost credibility with the investment community by promising and never delivering. This management team has never came through with a profitable drug in years. Will that ever happen?
"Look at Atea pharma (AVIR), small biopharma is making great progress in developing Covid-19 therapeutic.They immediately partnered with Roche ahead of their clinical trials.I will believe in such a story rather than incompetent, deceptive Adamis management team who takes every advantage of opportunity to mislead investors.F ADMP."
"If Merck can do it, we can do it."
"Covid dropping ,this drug is wonderful for more than covid ,if test pass well. Bronchitis alone is a serious market."
I am new investor but decided to get my feet wet with a few shares. I have not had much luck in the past with these penny type stocks that find it hard to even hold $1 but the reason I am trying it here is that the NIH is behind them which leads me to believe it is more than just a pipe dream.
"CHINA and STOCKS - - - like recommending the 5 best strains of Covid to expose yourself to....... BUY ADMP ""American Drug Co."""
Zimhi CRL ~ 50% chance. Even IF it gets FDA approval this time around the sales ramp up will be same as Symjepi.I know most foolish bull-ishitter investors don't get this because they have blinders on.
I don’t think NIH will say anything without a clue. When they say some thing they meant it
Why have they not filed financial statements. This generally isn’t good and is a huge red flag. Hope it isn’t for shareholders.

"I wrote investor relations - here is the response - Weak at best - Lame to say the leastThanks you for your questions and comments about Adamis. Tempol, the product candidate that may be beneficial in patients with COVID, is set to begin a Phase2/3 clinical trial this quarter that will be funded by Adamis. So when you say it has not gotten any traction, I don’t know what you mean. The company is exploring additional clinical investigations that may be eligible for government support through grants or other means. Getting this financial support requires applications, reviews by various committees, and, if successful, funding that comes in the form of tranches over time. They don’t just hand you a check and say get to it. If and when a grant is awarded it would be standard practice to inform investors. Hope this information is helpful.Best regards,Robert"
"Guys,I know I am too bearish but would love to see some rational rebuttal of my arguments."

"Did you other stockholders ever take a good look at this management team and the millions of dollars we are paying them for nothing. They cannot even get financial numbers out for 6-9 months and we are expecting some drugs the company is working on to get FDA approval. This is a joke in progress and I’m afraid it’s just a matter of time before they hit bottom.!For YEARS we have been hoping for a miracle, but it just doesn’t happen. We should know by year end the results."
"Tempol is far from a forrest, the world is looking close at its anti-bodies, even drugs that were developed many years ago, arise often in future discoveries. Kinda been a sleeper,and the science facts are facts ,time will tell."
3$ After approval. I do not expect much from this.
"I think all of us on this board need to take matters into our own hands - We should right Senators / NIH / FDA - Why is a product ""Tempol"" that was praised not even mentioned anymore? - Lets take on this fight !!

"IF 'We the People are in a SO-CALLED Pandemic -- Why the FOOT DRAGGING on TESTING and PASSING SAN DIEGO, Sept. 02, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Nasdaq: ADMP) today announced the initiation of patient dosing in the Phase 2/3 clinical trial for Tempol, an oral antiviral product candidate, in adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. In preclinical studies, Tempol has been shown to have antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. The trial is designed to enroll 248 patients.Shyam Kottilil, MBBS, Ph.D., Professor of Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM), Chief of the Division of Clinical Care and Research at UMSOM’s Institute of Human Virology, and Principal Investigator for the trial, commented: “The timing for this trial could not be more important as the delta variant spreads and breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals occur in the U.S. and worldwide. Tempol as an oral antiviral and anti-inflammatory may be an important countermeasure if proven safe and effective in this trial.”Dr. Dennis J. Carlo, President and Chief Executive Officer of Adamis, commented: “We are pleased to begin patient dosing in this Phase 2/3 clinical trial for Tempol, which has demonstrated highly encouraging preclinical data in several disease models of infection and inflammation. Worldwide appearance of new variants with increased transmissibility and resistance necessitates the development of new therapeutic agents. The data from Israel should be a wake-up call to the U.S. and the rest of the world. Israel has among the highest levels of vaccination for COVID-19, yet the country is now showing one of the world’s highest infection rates (breakthrough). Currently, in Israel, the majority of the hospitalized patients are fully gene vaccinated. If approved, Tempol may not only prove to be a very important drug for the treatment of COVID-19, but it may also play a role in curbing the pandemic.”Recently, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) highlighted Tempol as a potential home treatment for COVID-19 (NIH Study) The NIH news stated that, “This treatment would likely prevent severe disease.” Recent studies conducted by NIH researchers suggested that Tempol had potent antiviral activity against the virus that causes COVID-19 in laboratory studies. The NIH news article further describes how Tempol could possibly reduce COVID-19 symptoms by calming inflammation, protecting organs from damage, and decreasing the clumping of platelets.The Company recently announced (Stanford Study) the results of a published study in collaboration with Stanford University researchers suggesting that Tempol has strong, broad in-vitro anti-cytokine activity. Suppression of inflammatory cytokines with an antioxidant may be a beneficial treatment strategy in early COVID-19 infection.About the Phase 2/3 Clinical TrialThis Phase 2/3 adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial is designed to enroll approximately 248 high risk unvaccinated subjects with early COVID-19 infection age 18 years of age and older. The primary endpoint is the rate of hospitalization for patients receiving Tempol, versus those receiving placebo. Eligible subjects with positive COVID-19 infection within five days of study entry plus at least one co-morbidity will be randomized 1:1 to receive either Tempol or placebo. Co-morbidities include hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cancer, chronic renal disease, and immunodeficiency, and in the opinion of the investigator, the co-morbidity is not acutely life threatening. Patients randomized to Tempol (n=124), will receive 800mg daily in two divided doses of 400mg for up to 21 days. Similarly, placebo capsules will be administered twice daily to subjects in the placebo group (n=124) for up to 21 days.As part of the initial Phase 2 portion of the study, 50 COVID positive subjects will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive either Tempol or placebo. An interim analysis by the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will examine safety and markers of systemic inflammation during a Stage 1 interim analysis. Based on the DSMB analysis, the Phase 3 portion of the trial designed to enroll 198 patients may begin, with a second interim analysis planned after enrollment of 124 patients. A thorough safety assessment will be conducted, and all treatment related adverse events will be recorded, evaluated and compared for the treated and placebo groups.Adults who are interested in joining this study can visit https://earlycovidstudy.com/.Adamis licensed exclusive worldwide rights under patents, patent applications and related know-how relating to Tempol for certain licensed fields including the treatment of respiratory diseases including asthma, respiratory syncytial virus infection, influenza and COVID-19.About Adamis PharmaceuticalsAdamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation is a specialty biopharmaceutical company primarily focused"
"Until Adamis shows wall street that they can generate meaningful & sustainable revenue with Tempol or Zimhi or Symjepi or whatever. the stock will not budge no matter what the Tempol trial results show.Carlo has betrayed investors far too long and that is the reason, the stock continues to be in penalty boxdespite Tempol endorsement by NIH.You can pump all you want, $100 or $150 or $200 or whatever your pump target is, it will NOT matter.The stock will move higher ONLY WHEN Adamis proves they can generate substantial revenue from any product.Until then, it will be hard to overcome $1."
Volume is so low what’s going on?
This could be huge. The mere possibility of Tempol being a major game changer in the Covid pandemic should alone be enough to move the SP 2x - 5x from current level IMO... Good luck to all the longs out there!!
Nov 12 - Fda decision on Zimhi.
https://www.ott.nih.gov/news/collaboration-opportunity-for-covid-19-therapeuticPosted October 8th. What am I missing here? Why isn't NIH collaborating the only company that has been cleared by FDA for human clinical trials to evaluate Tempol as a treatment for COVID-19????
Nice article on yahoo finance about the study. Phase 2/3 and FDA approval. No one seems concerned about the missing earnings if we keep the spotlight on Tempol.

"The video for the Tempol clinical trial is about as top drawer as you will find. Clearly there are high hopes for it with the government etc. Somehow ADMP managed to get this opportunity, but it is an important function if only as a liability proxy for the trial. I am concerned less in the trial an more with the compounding issues and am worried that it can be used to leverage a ""reversal of opportunity""."
Any ideas on how long it'll take to finish this phase.. If I'm reading correct it could be very quickly done say with in 60 days.. Any opinions?
"Hey shorties, can you say Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/emergency-use-authorization-medical-products-and-related-authoritiesOne of the most interesting requirements for EUA, is that a company/product must be sponsored (vouched for ) by a major govt agency. Such as the DOD, DHS, or......(drum roll please).... the NIH. Put your big boy pants on and get ready for a good old fashioned short squeeze."

"On June 12, 2020, ADMP entered into a license agreement with Matrix Biomed, Inc., to license rights under patents, patent applications and related know-how relating to Tempol. Does anyone on the board know what the patents and patent applications include?"
"Where did you get that date for earnings call? We haven’t got the 1st quarter numbers yet, same management and things will never change as long as Carlo is still there. Maybe he wants a statue of himself put in front of the corporate office so stockholders will never forget all the great things he has done for the company. What a joke this company has become!"
"Funny how Carlo buried the deficiency notice from nasdaq in a PR touting a new cfo. Bit there is a new cfo because the old one just quit and his underling was promoted. If we are lucky maybe the old cfo was refusing to file earnings, while the new one might have more nads to do so. I can dream."
"Where are those great numbers? This is the second time that yahoo has been fooled and no financial numbers show up! They really must be great if they cannot report the earnings!Come on Carlo tell us again how great the last two quarters were and make your promises how great the future will be, especially with those great directors and the management team you had everyone vote for!"
Generics won't be able to sell to the governments because of the new use indications being specific to brand name. They're going to stock pile Tempol globally.

"I stop in here every now and then to check what the masses post regarding $ADMP. I would love to see some of your ’s. I truly feel like most of the people posting in here are either newbies, or people under 9 years old. I’m going to write the shortest and most simple post regarding Adamis Pharma. Dennis Carlos shortcomings are irrelevant, company earnings are irrelevant, SEC filings, news releases are irrelevant. Here is what is relevant:TEMPOL, and ZIMHI. THAT …. IS ….ALL. Major catalyst in the near future for a 1.02 stock. THATS ALL THAT MATTERS. Buy it, be patient, and let’s see if the catalyst are positive or negative. The risk is worth the reward here. If Zimhi gets rejected AND Tempol falls apart you sell right away and take a 50% loss, if Zimhi gets the ok and Tempol gets to faze 4 there is literally no cap on what the stock can do. U gotta risk it for the biscuit."

Does anybody live in San Diego where the company is?
If the Tempol drug is more than 50% effective then they are beating Merc

I will sell my shares if the share price reaches $350.Not sure where that decimal point belongs.
Time for up!

Merck is seeking emergency approval and this should be a huge win for them. Stock was up 9% yesterday. A lot of money shifted from Moderna to Merck yesterday. Funny I didn’t see Adamis make a run. Party’s over folks. Nothing to see here.

Fauci just endorsed Mercks oral pill. Stating it dramatically reduces hospitalizations and death. Guess I’m late to the party again. Well at the wrong party all together would be a better analogy. Wonder if we’ll see a sell off next week.... I knew this company couldn’t get it done. It was a long shot. Oh well....
"Tempol is a lose-lose for ADMP shareholders.If the trial succeeds, generics will grab the market. Shareholders lose on the upside.If the trial fails, all this dilution Carlo did in February this year will be wasted and Adamis is going to need additional 100 million shares next year. Shareholders lose again!"
"Adamis Pharmaceuticals: TEMPOL's Near-Term And Long-Term Upside Improves As Variants Sidestep VaccinesSep. 03, 2021 2:51 PM ETAdamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (ADMP)Biologics profile picture.Biologics6.36K FollowersLong/Short Equity, Deep Value, Growth, BiotechContributor Since 2017After years of working in the medical field, I have developed a passion for biotech and lifesaving therapies. Now, I am a full-time biotech investor who is in search of the next breakthrough therapy, device, or pharmaceutical. My trade focus is around catalysts and potential acquisitions. SummaryDespite vaccines having some degree of efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, vaccinated patients around the world are still getting infected and capitulating to COVID-19. Antiviral drugs could be the answer.Adamis Pharmaceuticals has an antiviral candidate, TEMPOL, which has the prospects to be operative at several stages of the infection.TEMPOL is not the only antiviral drug in development, however, it has unique characteristics that could make it a leading product that may secure huge government contracts.I reveal my updated strategy for accumulating ADMP ahead of ZIMHI PDUFA date and TEMPOL catalysts.Coronavirus and DNA, virus mutation. New variant and strain of SARS CoV 2. Microscopic view.Gilnature/iStock via Getty ImagesDespite a number of vaccines having some degree of efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, vaccinated patients around the world are still getting infected and capitulating to COVID-19. It is apparent that governments and health agencies have picked their vaccine champions regardless of their shortcomings and inability to be as effective against emerging variants. As a result, the need for new therapeutics to treat COVID-19 is still a pressing need. We have seen plenty of other therapeutics that fail to have a significant impact on COVID-19 and the ones who have shown some promise, are typically useful in a particular stage of the disease. What is more, we are lacking an at-home treatment option, which can help lessen the burden on our healthcare system. What the world needs is a drug/therapeutic that can work in every stage of the disease and can be self-administered at home. Adamis Pharmaceuticals (ADMP) might have the answer with their TEMPOL candidate, which has already garnered support from the NIH to have antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 with antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Unfortunately, the market does not have the same confidence in TEMPOL… or perhaps the market doesn’t have confidence in the company’s management to get this product through the FDA and on the market. Regardless, ADMP’s share price is still hovering around $1.00 per share despite the nearly limitless upside potential from TEMPOL. I believe there is a possibility that the company won’t fumble TEMPOL and will post impressive results from their Phase II/III study in subjects with COVID-19 infection. For that reason, I am still accumulating ADMP on dips in anticipation TEMPOL becomes one of the mainstay treatments for COVID-19 for years to come.I intend to provide a background on TEMPOL and how it works against COVID-19. In addition, I take a look at two other oral antivirals that are being tested against COVID-19. Finally, I discuss how I plan on managing my position around TEMPOL’s prospects.Figure 1: Adamis Pipeline (Source: Adamis Presentation)Background on TEMPOLAdamis only acquired the worldwide license for TEMPOL back in June of 2020. The company now has the right to use Matrix Biomed’s TEMPOL for the treatment of respiratory diseases including asthma, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, and COVID-19. In addition, the license includes the use of TEMPOL in radiation dermatitis in cancer patients. Adamis paid Matrix $250K and issued Matrix 1M of convertible preferred stock. In addition, TEMPOL’s net profits will be split between Adamis and Matrix.TEMPOL has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, and antioxidant action, which make it a unique candidate for COVID-19 and the ARDS related to COVID-19. TEMPOL has already demonstrated its aptitude to moderate pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduce the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species. TEMPOL studies conducted at Stanford University investigated TEMPOL’s effects on immune cells in COVID-19 patients. The authors of the study determined TEMPOL was able to decrease several T cell and APC-derived cytokines. Additionally, TEMPOL has the prospective to decrease platelet aggregation and reduce the dangerous clotting we have seen in COVID-19 patients.https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/6/11/48523746-16234679391616151.jpgFigure 2: TEMPOL in COVID-19 (Source: ADMP)Moreover, TEMPOL has shown anti-viral properties that interfere with RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase that is critical for the replication of SARS-CoV-2. The NIH found that TEMPOL was able to exhibit these abilities in the salivary glands and the lungs, which are the main target of the v"

"The market is always there and it will continue to grow but I am not so sure Adamis' product (if ever approved) will ever sell in that market to generate meaningful revenue in a timely manner.Symjepi was approved more than 4 years ago and next to $0 sales revenue to speak of, still.Garbage products."
I think someone controlling this stock price
I do not see how Adamis will be able to complete their Tempol trial in Covid-19 or complete the trial within 6 months as stated on clinical trials site. I know it is an estimated date but investors will lose patience while Adamis tries to enroll patients.So many other companies are trying to get patients enrolled in their trial.Good luck Adamis completing the trial. Not going to happen.
Should be an interesting couple months-Zimhi pdufa Nov-SEC filing deadlines upcoming- May learn more on us attorney subpoena concerning possible illegal usc drugs or whatever it is they are investigating - could get an update of antiviral Tempol
