"As of year-end they had total debt of $7.3B and cash of $2.5B. The $5B they will get is equivalent to their net debt. I know they won’t pay off all their debt as they will need cash on the balance sheet, but it totally changes the dynamic of the risk. DXC was always cheap because of the high debt load but now that risk factor is reduced significantly. I’m sure their earnings guidance comes down from $5.25-5.75 due to the sale of the business they are unloading and a weak market. But if they are still targeting $3 in EPS and are essentially debt free, we should trade at a more normal 10 to 20 times earnings which gives them a valuation between 30 and 60. This assumes a signoreduced EPS forecast of $3 which is very conservative."
Sold at 37.30.
"This was back on March 28th but Brian Keane - Deutsche Bank (he's no slouch, 78% win rate, ranked #181 out of 7,490 Analysts on TipRanks) with a $44 price target. Let's get another analyst upgrade going into ER..."
"If this sees Breakout on strong volume thru $19.25 you'll see $23 pretty quick. Also, the 50-day($16.45) is climbing and narrowing the gap to the 200-day($23.91). The Golden Cross(50- up and thru the 200-) is so named because it's such a successful Indicator, in this case obviously Bullish. I might pyramid a little there and avg. up some"
The deal is expected to close by December..8 months away
No DIV cut !! That is a vote of confidence for the new CEO
Wow glad I quit this company and cashed out my shares in July
Lousy leadership ...
Any word on Dividend/Share buy backs? Balance sheet looks healthy and they're making good money??? This seems like a no brainer unless I'm missing something
"As predicted dxc missed yesterday after hours with the downside Limited. This morning we are seeing the real sell off with the stock down $2.70. that was my profit that I saved by selling yesterday. I have found with the covid-19. Market we are in most companies except Netflix and pizza joints will be missing on the earnings. the key is to lock in your gains, as I did with dxc.The obvious play was to hold the cash and buy dxc again once it's bottoms. however I still feel MGM is in an upward trend and as soon as the casinos start opening it should bounce at least to 20. another note every Thursday I'm noticing is a sell-off day because of the unemployment reports. well folks we saved thousands of dollars by selling yesterday and locked in our games when are original entry was $14.15."
"https://sightsinplus.com/news/jobs-news/dxc-technology-hires-500-women-in-a-single-day/ All fine and well and good about the women, who is going to train them? Do you think customers are still going to pay for the same level of service for new people who don't understand their businesses?"
"This stock is confusing.. DXC has somewhat of a clue as to what they're doing based on their EPS being accurate .. big drop off from its 52 high.. volume isn't terrible.. still flirting with its 52 low... considered Low volatility by the ""experts"" .. I'm not one my self but I'd say this should be sitting at a bottom of $43/per instead of this weird 34... Someone smarter than me please explain whats going on."
"For those of you who has DXC stocks before May 25th, has any of you guys received your share of PRSP at all?I bought shares before the 25th and still haven't received anything yet.I use this trading app called Rohinhood and their customer service is terrible. There is no contact number and no one replied to my email I sent almost a week ago. I know this app isn't the best for trading but I'm not a big time stock trader.Any help would be appreciated!"
dxc buyout offer could be $15B which gives it a share price of $50 to $70. If you include debt then $50 is on d cards.
"JP Morgan says ""market outperform"" and Overweight. Keeps price target in the $40's. Guess I will just keep collecting the DIVs until it gets there."
"Good news for today, the board decided to keep the dividend for the current year !"
Wow....something going on.... Very weird.... The March $30 and $35 call options traded huge today....someone is getting fooled and badly....
I think new CEO will turn things around. A lot of knowledge and drive. Great company with very low PE. Way oversold.
DXC is stating that debt will be reduced by AT LEAST $2.5B while at the same time giving back $4.25B to shareholders. All of this will be done within the next 10 quarters.Source: Page 17 of the Webcast (or minute 30)
$27 is d target price where this becomes a short term sell candidate.
"From DJ news: DXC Technology ( DXC ) shares are getting a boost from Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keene, who raised his rating on the information technology consulting firm to Buy from Hold, increasing his price target on the stock to $44 from $28."
Wow! They will get $5B for a business that makes $1.4B of revenue. Their market cap is $4B and their total sales are $20B. They are selling a small slice of their company and raised more than the market cap of the entire company. Hang on folks we are heading to 50 soon!

Why did the stock drop like a rock after hours with great numbers and out look?
All the employees got their salary raise last week..looks like a good quarter.
Tax loss selling through December into the new year as I mentioned previously. Try to catch a good level for a 2021 setup.
"earnings call: ""management expects $5B sale to occur earlier than expected - deal likely to close before end of 2nd quarter"""
$27 in 1997? Is Max. stock chart correct?
"Let's assume that Atos takeover bid for DXC was at $11.0B....would translate to $43 per share, vs. current $29.75 price in premarket."
A bit strange that DXC can receive $5B offloading a small part of the company and still be valued at just $4.X billion in market cap? What is the logic?
I think we will look back on today / this week as being one of those outstanding buying opportunities similar to buying at the low back in 2009. This company will be buying back shares hand over fist below 20. They are guiding for $5.25 - 5.75 earnings and are trading under 16? That’s not going to last.
Overall market sell off is coming. We will get to buy this at much lower price..

I guess they didn't dig those earnings good thing I wrote covered calls. So much for the upgrades before earnings poof
Not good today technically. Had a nice uptrend going but today's action has broken it. Unless it can close back up above $19.40. It's resting on the 50-day here at $18.70 which was rising the last 2 months. I was hoping for the Golden Cross in the next 2 weeks. Still might see it. But DXC needs to get a move on.
Golden cross about to happen.50 day moving average about to cross 200 day moving average.Generally bullish sign should happen in next week or so.
Cup and Handle formation last 5 days with a breakout from the handle indicating this move higher. Would not be surprised to see a $2 move by the end of the week including today's $1 so far
No. An OakMark fund manager was just on CNBC talking about his position in DXC which has brought a new set of eyeballs (and buying) to the stock.
"DXC last few days of year 2020 trading actions is quite promising... 1). looks Tax lose selling is over... 2). investors are building their positions for next year - that is very good sign. In this huge over-valued market, DXC is one of few very cheap stocks. If DXC can deliver the earning goal. Next year this time , DXC definitely will be in middle of 30S. And If we are luck. DXC is low 40s stock... Again, patience is key..."
Did I understand correctly that DXC is planning to buyback 50% of all outstanding shares in the next 3 years?? That alone would double the EPS!!
"DXC Technology Investor Day - 06/17..will be very interesting. More upgrades to follow,DXC Technology will host a virtual Investor Day on Thursday, June 17, 2021 at 9:00 a.m. EDT.

A gold mine for short term trading...
I thought there were always concerns about the management - why the panic now?
Forward PE under 4 DIV over 3% what am I missing?
what did they say in the call that the stock is down 5%
"Is Mike Lawrie doing the limbo, seeing how low he can take the share price?"
"Question for the board. If this is going to be bought out, why has the price not risen to close what is believed to be the buyout price?"
DXC is down some 80% from its $90 level two years ago. I am wondering if this is not reflecting the fact that the company gives twentieth century advice in a twenty-first environment.
I’m new to this company and just read last quarters transcript and looking forward to today’s info.I noticed some stories embargoed on The Fly which should be readable tomorrow. One story headlines three businesses to be restructured. Does anyone have any info on this?Plan to buy in am. Hope this doesn’t jump too quickly on me.
"Another big congrats to our Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) team, led by Gyan Chandra. The team built on our 20+ year relationship with CIBC and signed a large renewal until 2026 for our mid-range computing scope of work. The deal also includes new work, which will strategically strengthen our presence in the applications space. CIBC chose DXC because of our strong delivery performance, trusting us with their mission-critical systems."
To the new highs with new CEO!Waiting for that easy $45 mark
Moving strangely.
"""Bill Miller says DXC Technology (NYSE:DXC) takeover approach should be rejected as the offer from Atos is too low; says DXC price would have to be ``much much'' higher for Miller to be interested in a sale; believes name could trade back to $70/share"""
"people focused on the huge goodwill write down are focused on the wrong things. With a new CEO he obviously wants to expense as much as possible so the bar is set real low. This is a non recurring charge and has zero cash impact. You need to look at non-GAAP earnings. So with the debt they have, how can they afford such a big buyback? Because this company is a huge ATM! Net cash provided by operations was $1.65B and free cash flow was $739M in just one quarter!So annualized free cash flow on this terrible quarter is $2.96 billion! How could they not buy back shares at this level??"
who thinks this still has room to run? a couple of years ago it was much higher.
Bought back in yesterday below $16. other than technical don't see why it's moving but the chart said buy so I did
"Probably the deal fell through now that I'm looking at the ATOS rise in price. Big deal, didnt expect it to happen anyway on that low ball offer. I dont like that someone traded on inside information however, so I filed a complaint with the SEC."
"John Lawrie, DXC president and CEO. bought 10,000 shares on 8/6/2019 for average price of $49.56. DXC dropped 30 percent on 8/9/2019. Maybe John wanted to make you think he didn't know what the Qtr 1 report on 8/9/2019 was going to be."
We are crossing the offer from ATOS.....that was declined by the management in March...Good decisions from the new management.
Back on track
DXC will go up..ATOS or no ATOS...the news itself is enough to drive d stock up....10B market cap soon at d very least.
The $5B sale of its State Local and Health and Human services biz is not reflecting on its market capitalization of $3.7B.
This stock needs some volume to come in and drive it higher to the next level.
Manipulation today. It finally came to.
Anyone find any news?

"“Cannot turn a ship on a dime.” It is taking time for the executive management to make a significant change. But, the proof is in the pudding, stock price almost doubled since the new president took the helm. This means DXC is moving in the right direction. Hitting 50 in no time."

Dumped for tax loss harvesting and technicals as it rejected off the weekly MA. Still a good stock (the cash flow is absurd) but need to hold for a year or longer until the managers get back in.
next stop 22...this company is still mak money...health care projects...cloud services...Cheapest stock on d market.
Totally overblown.
Call buying is very interesting....
Payed down $500 million in debt and $280 million net income. DADAMN! Going to $75 by early next year.

great stock ...in since 20 usd
What a reversal...what is going on?
"With $5B in cash and 250M in outstanding shares, they just generated about $20/share. Plus a majority of their revenue is still protected even after the sale. This stock is worth at least $25 with yesterday's sale. Right now, Cash is king and that is what they got."
"At the time of this post, the stock is trading at $35.06. Even if they have earnings on the low end of the revised range, which would be $7.00 EPS for fiscal 2020, the stock is trading at 5x forward earnings. While I'm not saying the guidance was good news, this selloff feels a bit overdone."
"Morgan Stanley downgraded DXC a few days ago to ""Equal Weight"" from ""Overweight"", with a price target of $31. As I said in Warp Investor the fair value is around $64. Arguably a ""buy"" now, to hold with some patience, as this is a turnaround story."
pure manipulation at the best..same thing happened when in 25$
"Stock guru Bill Miller recommended this stock on Friday on CNBC, he is hoping the acquisition won't go through. he thinks it's worth much more."
At 30 percent of 52 week high and 5 to 7 times earnings it would seem like the time fora stock buy back plan is warranted and needed to support the stock and the best use of cash.
"The new appointee at DXC as Chief Operating Officer Chris Drumgoole has some chops that the board must like...He was the interim CIO at GE...

The big boys play the game.
"Veritas Capital has bought the business which is going to fetch DXC $5Billion. DXC is also looking for buyers and is in active talks as per the conf call to sell some other businesses.

Conference call was good. They are confident in outlook. Cloud growth 37% and strong. Business shift caused the fluctuation and cloud is where it’s at. Will be $40 by the end of the week.
I don’t know much about this company but a quick look made me think it’s way oversold so picked up 600 shares @ $34....thoughts?
I have been looking for a company the pays a decent dividend to replace some of the MLPs that are getting decimated because of the oil left affecting the parent companies and distribution of capital or dividends as they call them. if I'm going to pay taxes on the distribution of capital I want a company that can appreciate at least 100% in the next year and dxc fits that bill. We're in at $14.75 with a $30 Target short-term by that I mean by December
Management needs to streamline business.

So was the Monday pop on a DB upgrade??? I sold covered calls.
So many good things happening at the company which should boost the stock price.
Surprised this message board isn't getting more attention....over the next 12 months I think DXC is going to be one of the biggest tech turnaround stories on Wall Street.
Unfortunate timing for DXC as the market future drops significantly due to turmoils around the world. Hong Kong cancels all flights due to riots and it is the financial center of Asia. World-wide financial market will be negatively affected. We are already down close to 200 points pre-market! Get cover! DXC will hit new low today to low $30.
it's hard to believe a company with nearly 5b in profits is a 16$ stock
The company is worth about 80 bucks on a DCF basis before this sale. I have no idea how it got here in the first place.
"A couple of months back, I posted about DXC great potential. I am still confident in that they will get their act together and move towards stronger financial results. In this transition, some people might leave, many others will join. I hope the law of averages tilts to higher productivity, better synchronization, more competent workforce. Change is coming, and it is starting to be reflected in higher stock price."
Why the stock falling continuously ?

Overreaction. Shares were already pricing this in before today imo. Buying opportunity....
This stock seems like the bargain of the decade to me....at 3X return at minimum....what am I missing here?
Nice move yesterday but it was on less than average volume. DXC needs to see surging above-average volume to drive it to the next trading range.
Average target still $36.
JPM reiterated Outperform with lowering target from $43 to $42 but still goes down.
But oakmark was quoting stock price before spin outs and sells which is not comparable . That why it has a $22 target .
Why down again?
EXTREMLEY CHEAP. Bought a nice chunk and have another hefty order in at $24 a share. Paying $6.9 Billion for a company that can be liquidated for $5.9 Billion and that can ear easily $1Billion a year plus just payed off $3 Billion in long term debt seems like a no brainer to me. $75 stock this time next year.
It's the end for DXC... a huge selloff since a mounth and no one is saying what is the problem with that stock.
"I've seem JP Moron analysts be completely wrong on stocks, one being AMD which they were bearish on for years and finally admitted they were wrong after the stock ran up to multiples of their price target. It's amazing how people put so much weight on the opinions of these so-called analysts."
"Salvino, in response to a Citi analyst: Well, look, Ashwin, where we are is you see the trajectory that we're going. So when I reflect, let's just take FY '21 to FY '22. We just delivered a year where we were minus 9.6% organic revenue. And now I'm guiding toward minus 1% to minus 2%.And basically, we're showing that that new revenue is coming on board and we're closing the gap of that lost revenue we had in FY '21. We also just delivered 6.2% adjusted EBIT margin for FY '21, and I'm guiding now toward 8.2% to 8.7%. So then I sit there and I look at it and go, all right, EPS, same drill, $2.43. I'm guiding to $3.45 to $3.65.And then if that's not enough, then I sit there and go, all right, now we're delivering on the restructuring and TSI commitment we said, which we are going to go after reducing that $900 million to $550 million and also paying down debt. And then the other focus area for us, as you can tell, Ken's driving a higher level of clarity in these numbers have you seen. So I look at that progress going through '22 and then hitting '24 and saying I think that's the right trajectory."
This stock is completely driven by retail traders who have no idea whats its actually worth on a valuation basis. Wild swings will continue to be the norm.
"Prices below $50 are insanely low for DXC. Can't see how the market ended up at $29. One more proof that there is no such thing as ""efficient markets"". Markets are blind and emotional. Good for value investors. Even taking the lower end of their official guideline of $7 - $7.75 earnings per share, the stock would need to rise to $70 for a P/E ratio of 10. Still it would be a bargain. Also: Now that digital services makes up half of DXCs revenue, we should stabilize in terms of revenue and start heading upwards as digital is growing faster than traditional business is shrinking. If that happens and we continue to see moderate growth with digital (doesn't have to be the 30% we have right now), the stock price should reach $140 at a P/E of 20.I think the new CEO may use some of the available cash for regular stock buybacks as long as we are below $50."
DXC almost back to 1/3rd of previous high. Huge upside IMHOGLTA
"Rev miss as stock falls. What say! DXC Technology DXC delivered better-than-anticipated results for second-quarter fiscal 2021. The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 64 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 68.4%. The figure, however, declined from the prior-year quarter’s $1.38.Revenues of $4.55 billion surpassed the consensus mark of $4.49 billion. However, quarterly revenues fell 6.1% year over year. Termination of certain customer accounts and price concessions mainly affected the top line."
"A friend of mine used to work at CSC many years ago. Based on my conversations with him, I concluded the following: this company has a lot of expertise in its ranks, what it lacks is channeling all this talent in a streamlined, cohesive, and consistent workforce (all the wood behind the arrow). Over the years, things have changed for the better, but there is still more to be done to become a force to reckon with. I have all the confidence they will get there, particularly in the current stage of new norm and back to work approaches. Major corporations realized through the pandemic they don't have their act together on many ends, particularly in technology, and DXC can play a bigger role in helping these companies survive."
The Management of CSC is reckless in replacing HPE mgt and culture this might result in desperate measures in future due to lack of understanding of big business
Short at $17.65
Nice earnings. Will it go up a lot tomorrow? No idea and dont care. Its over 50% undervalued via a basic DCF with reasonable margin and rev growth inputs. Momentum looks good too. Just let time do its thing and dont fall for volatility tactics to get shaken out.
"My next Pure Earnings Short Sell play, after I Cover CPRI later today, is very likely to be...DXC. I found a bunch of very nice-looking potential Short plays for the Wednesday AH/Thursday PM earnings release time period, but DXC stands out to me, as one of the very best. With the only caveat being that the stock needs to have a decent day, not go down too much, before I can get in later in the afternoon.What makes this obscure technology company the single best Short Sell Play of the Day?? Consider:1: Stock hit a brand new 52 week high yesterday.2: Stock is significantly overvalued using all current metrics. 3: Company was not profitable for fiscal year 2020, and in fact showed declining Revenue from 2018 to 2019, as well as 2019 to 2020. 4: Analysts are mixed in their recommendations, and in fact show very little if any upside price potential for the company, even looking out 12 months.5: Overall financials are extremely poor as objectively determined via a comprehensive peer/sector based analysis: Company uses Debt more than other companies in the sector. Gross Margin is bad. Operating Margin is average. Return On Equity is poor. EPS Growth Rate is bad. 6: Company raised Guidance on 4/21/21, but the stock sold off on the news. Since then the stock price has completely recovered, which simply sets the stage for a new dip on today's AH earnings report. Stock price is unreasonably elevated when compared, in current real-time, to both EPS and Revenue growth. For all these reasons and more, I am expecting a significant sell-off from DXC in direct and immediate response to today's After Hours earnings release, andwill be happy to go Short with a lot of shares later this afternoon, UNLESS the stock tanks and goes down 3% or more earlier in the day. Good Luck Folks! :-)"
Why does DXC Technologies (DXC) keep buying other companies while the DXC stock has lost half of its value?
"The 200-day line is $22.81 and the 50-day is $17.86. The 50- has been drifting up the last month. If this volume maintains and DXC closes and stays to trade above the 200-, the 50- will be dragged up and thru the 200- giving you the Golden Cross. I've see a few GC's fail. But it's not known as a short- and intermediate-, and even long-term Bullish Indicator for nothing. It's a significant Technical development, especially for this chart which has been dragging azss since it collapsed in February. Many traders BUY the GC as a matter of course."

"Wow, great quarter. 57% increase in EPS YOY, and they expect around $8 EPS for the year. At just a 15 PE that gives us a $120 stock. This is headed to $100 soon, imo."

DD people! IPNFF big interview Thursday at 12:30 AUGMENTED REALITY is here!
"Someone called into Jim Cramer’s show tonight during the Lightning Round segment and asked about DXC. Cramer told the caller not to own the stock. He said “my grandmother said if you don’t have something nice to say, don’t say it at all.”Anyone else catch this? Anyone still long this stock?"

Nice move higher since our entry at $14.75 Up 30% since then and still another $10 to go higher till my target at $29. In the meantime 4.67% yield plus 30% equity gain nice rebound Higher. This is way undervalued. Time for the $20 magnet to break out
fcf big negative...even they said they will meet positive fcf full year. let see.
"In tomorrow's earning conference, if one of the following happened, DXC will jumps over 20... 1). No Dividend cut; 2). The sale of the health care unit is on schedule; 3). No earning negative surprise even if earning could be bad but nobody looks good now except FAANG... Let's see..."
I sold weekly 26 strike puts so when it went at around 24.5 I was a bit worried.......but wow...what a reversal
"Most of the profit seen in reports is due to one time accounting tricks, not improvements in sales or earnings. At some point, they will be like Enron, and implode."
Made a bad choice buying yesterday @ 16.6 worth 30K. I guess I have to squat around to break even. Every major company has taken a knock out punch on the chin during COVI-19. DXC will be fine in the long run as it is a tech company that is in demand right now. I will stay put and hope for the best.
Down 20% from recent 52 week highs. While mkt taps highs. I understand the growth prospects but with improvement in e.p.s. and debt reduction. I don't get this price action
I was searching about this stock all over web but I don’t see any big negative stuff. Looks like a steal at this price. Market cap should be around 10b very soon
"In a normal market this thing would launch tomorrow, but this is anything BUT a normal market. Also in a normal market the golden opportunity of the last 2 -3 trading days would never have happened. I took some losses to buy a lot of this sub $16. I plan to hold for min 2 years and maybe more if the bull market resumes strongly after corona. Short term pops are out of the question for this stock. When I worked at HP for 16 years I had 2 such opportunities when HP dropped below 14. Both times I had huge profits, and this one will be just the same. I am sad my last order for $10k did not get filled, but I got a boat load regardless all under $16 - fo DXC"
Why are these dxc dudes down 8%today
"From BYBW: DXC Technology Company (“DXC”) today announced the pricing of an offering of (i) $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 1.800% Senior Notes due 2026 [...] DXC intends to apply the net proceeds from this offering, after the payment of the underwriting discount and other expenses, to the repayment, in whole or in part, of its 4.125% Senior Notes due 2025, its 4.750% Senior Notes due 2027 and its 7.45% Senior Notes due 2029, with any remainder applied to its other existing indebtedness."
"There is no internal growth, just smoke and mirrors keeping the earnings afloat. While the trends make this seem like a good buy, the truth is the stock is going to dip lower. Probably right after the next earning call, so I would expect the stock to float around between 30-40 for the next couple months and then dip again in November. Might be a good Bear move. Investors are weary of the continued strategy where customers and revenues shrink and the only answer to combat it is to reduce labor costs which currently are not keeping up with the revenue loses. It is catching up where the more they lay-off, the more revenue they eventually lose with unsatisfied customers and poor reputation in the marketplace. Then they have to lay-off more to keep up and the cycle continues."
"will this go up, or did I make a mistake buying more at 93"
"Sold off hard now rebounding. Shoulda bought my covered calls back on the crash after earnings, thought dip would last at least a couple days."
"I have a large stake in DXC (~4,000 shares), some of which I bought at the high-end (over $75). Only because technology and consulting are my fields of expertise, not to mention that I have a strong finance background, I believe in the potential for this company to make it on its own (might take some time) or be acquired (shorter timeframe). Either way, I am confident I will sell my stake at a profit (sooner or later)."
"DXC Technology Company – Consensus Indicates Potential 16.6% UpsideArticle by: Amilia Stone 17th September 2020DXC Technology Company found using ticker (DXC) have now 13 analysts in total covering the stock. The consensus rating is ‘Buy’. The target price ranges between 33 and 19 calculating the mean target price we have 23.54. With the stocks previous close at 20.19 this indicates there is a potential upside of 16.6%. The day 50 moving average is 19.49 and the 200 day moving average is 16.76. The market cap for the company is $4,972m"
"As of 12/31, the company had $1.8B left in the share buyback program. That’s about 45% of the current market cap. If they are not buying the maximum amount right now, we need a new management."
"is DXC Technology going to start sharing some of their Federal Tax savings onto the employees? So many companies gave bonuses to their employees shortly after the reduction, but not DXC. Why not?"
"At kingoft, you say the company is not worth much after selling the business worth $5B.... Really??? they have $20B in revenue and sold one piece that made $1.4B. That leaves $18.6B. That’s a lot left. If the $1.4B in revenue is worth $5B imagine what the $18.6B is worth."
If you like DXC because it is an undervalued tech services company you should also check out UIS.
"Per my understanding, the prior buyout proposal would have bee about $38/share and they turned that down as insufficient. I have a target price of $45 based on conservative estimate of earnings of $4.50/share for 2021. Value line has projected 2021 earnings of $6.45. Plenty of room to run and now technicals are lining up. Stay long....for much higher price!"
I wish the company would make a press release as to whether they are in active talks with Atos or have no interest in a combined company. That should be the least that they should be conveying to shareholders.
"at market cap of 10B, DXC will cross 40."
"Can anybody shed light for me on why they still forecast restructuring expenditure in 2024 in the long term guidance , Also what does TSI stand for ? Many Thanks"
what's up Houston? results not or yet...
"From an employee standpoint, I think we're finally seeing that the new CEO is going to be good to his word and turn the morale in the company into a positive direction so that should be good for the stock which is why I bought some yesterday on my own, not just in my 401k"
"Not a good report, not a bad report....A little light on next quarter...but okay for the full year....but no upside...Sadly, I see this dropping around $3 tomorrow...I kind of expected this given someone bought 2,800 $42 PUT options today....they obviously had inside information...."
I see that many here are bullish post earning yet they disappointed on revs and shares heading lower. So we need to come clean and accept the fact that DXC going forward had head winds and I for 1 are turning even more bearish.
"Always tricky to provide a valuation soon before earnings. Anyway, our results suggest the following fair values – stock price: $70.21, and price-to-earnings ratio: 7.65. Check Warp Investor for the simulation-based analysis."
"I had just taken a loss, exited at 26.5. Could not find any news so gut feel says ""EXIT"". Just another example of a retail investor groping in the dark. Sigh. With today's high volume and sell-off, I don't know what's coming next. :("
Do they meet street expectations tonight on earnings.
"Within 12 months, DXC will reach middle of 30.. DXC is not supper star or Wall street darling. .. But it is dirty cheap with current price... Patience is key"
20% up very soon.
"Pretty lame takeover offer IMHO. DXC has a net debt of about $6B, and market cap @$29/share is about $7.4B. Atos' offer of $10Billion ""including debt"" doesn't make sense. The offer has to be at least $13.5B to break even today.However, if the offer is ""$10B + debt"", that would mean a share price of about $39, but the market is not reacting that way. Which only means that we small beings don't have enough details about the offer.Savvy"
good earnings after the bell??
Shouldn't the company say something about these firings?
"Guidance was fine. Wrote out of the money covered calls to make up for no dividend. Investor day on June 17th I think, suppose to outline future further. Will hold and see how stock does tommorow. Kinda wonder what they will add on investor day that they didn't on conference call."
"Its official, the DXC Titanic has struck the iceberg! Abandon ship!"
"What is DXC management not telling everyone? Was it just profit taking from 100+ to 57? If all the numbers are good, then why the selling? Just trying to understand this."

Why is the stock down? Is it profit taking? Thanks.
"I told you this will go up! I think there is still some potential in the near to middle term, but I sold with a great profit today. Waiting for some healthy retrievement. - Not investment advise"
large insider buying. 10k shares @ $38.49
