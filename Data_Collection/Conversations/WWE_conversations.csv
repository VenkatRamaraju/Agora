"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"With a controversial network special coming tomorrow, I thought you'd be interested in a particular financial factoid.When taking inflation into account, the five previous Crown Jewel specials have netted more money for the company than all the WrestleManias combined.According to our friends at WrestleTalk, ticket sales for 'The Granddaddy Of Them All' have brought in $228.1 miliion since 1985. Conversely, the Saudi shows have made WWE $250 million.Controversial? Yes. But unlike the hippies, I will play Sun City"
Buy Buy Buy going to sell to Disney
dying company. get out of this asap
Vince flew back to Saudi Arabia this week for business reasons. Hmmm...
"Looks like WWE could just as well shut down upper deck ticket sales, because there are so many seats available for events coming up soon. ticket sales are much cheaper then 3 months ago as well. every event has $20 tickets now, and there was no such thing as less then $50 prior. Charts show a Head and shoulders pattern has formed on this stock so I'm out. Good luck to the holders of this..."
"It appears someone is slowly accumulating shares of WWE day after day. Every small sell off is quickly met with an increase in share price. With Vince looking to sell within the next 20 months and rising inflation with increased interest rates, there is no better time then now to make a bid for this company. Still say 6 billion dollar deal at $78 before the Holidays."

I really don’t see Disney making a play for this. The only possible buyer I see is “ the rock”. Stock price I feel is inflated by as much as 75%. Fools gold. I just don’t see anyone wanting this. V. McMahon is a genius but he’s obviously stepping back here as he gets older. They had a great run.
Not sure it’s good long-term to bring back golden-oldies - might be okay as long as they don’t hold titles - need to have newer younger stars prevail and grow
Mattel just got extended on the license.
WWE is done...AEW just debuted Adam Cole and Daniel Bryan... sell off coming on Tuesday
"Disney will have no choice, but to purchase the WWE sooner rather than later due to increased earnings and higher interest rates.6 Billion deal that will bring the stock to just under $78 before the Holidays."
ROH just went under. Guessing their library will be up for sale.
"No video game this Christmas. If you're on the fence with investing, that's just one more reason you should avoid making the same mistake I did"
The potential of a sale has been rumoured for a while; only thing happening is the company president confirmed they want to within the next two years.A lot can happen in that time - particularly with no set buyer
Lifelong WWF/WWE fan here. What AEW is doing is impressive. WWE needs to really get their s*** together.
Great last month and a half for Vince Mcmahon. WWE to $80 .. ?
"These AEW articlesRampage draws 1/4 of the audience Smackdown does, and they’re on right after each other."
