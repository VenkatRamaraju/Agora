poor Max trying his hardest to persuade you that MMAT is not for real. hmm wonder what his motive is?
"Today I bought another 5k shares of MMTLP @ 2.01 each, total of 15k shares now, hoping for a good ROI, let's see in December. Good luck to you all."
"Rbh only allowed you to Sell and they took away the “Buy” button for a reason that you should know! Lol rbh is working for those Hfs for quite a while, just a little secret for you to discover!"
"going to be a little while before they are fully profitable, but with the deals in the pipes this is at the bottom of its trend. bought a 1k lot @4.75 strike. itll be 6.00 by next friday easy. i cant wait to see who all signed NDa's i know fb (meta) for sure i hear samsung is on board sony and nintendo also. sony wants to add ar to its legacy movies so it can reformat and resell for a premium. big things are happening and your eyebulbs will be screaming! (w.s. burroughs)"
"Short question: Since MMTLP will definitely disappear around Jan 1, is this not a shorter's dream?ie: Short at the current price and you'd never have to cover...right?Now you wouldn't get the spinoff, but at today's price, you'd have a sure-thing buck a share in two months or so....would you not?"
The word meta conjures the word bankrupt.https://qz.com/2081538/facebooks-meta-rebrand-echoes-a-failed-metaverse-company/
"5. What happens to my dividend if I sell the Series A shares? The right to receive a Series A dividend in the future is attached to the Series A shares. If you do not hold Series A shares when a record date for a dividend is declared you will not receive the dividend. At the moment, no such record date has been set, or dividend declared, by Meta.If you hold there could be a squeeze here."
Get ready for a spike. People are now realizing all of the collaborations going on. Facebook changing their name and a Tesla collab in the works. The current price is extremely undervalued which is why after hours is rolling. Get ready for the next few weeks.
"Sorry wrong symbol for Facebook,but its sure a blessing with MMAT."
"This MMTLP is not the dividend payment TRCH holders were expecting. The market makers created this to get you to sell your dividend shares so that shorts from TRCH times have a chance to cover. The land has not been sold yet, it will be much higher then this. There are irregularities in the amounts of shares that were shorted and the actual shares available to short. The shorts are actually trapped from the merger, if you hold through this until land is sold and actual dividend number is announced you will make out much better. It's easy, just hold, make money."
What’s the deal ? ??
Why it is dropping
Shorts are in trouble tomorrow. They never seen this coming! What a surprise!!! FB --> META!
Wow just wow
mmat has nothing to do with Facebook lol.
I have to think the meta on Facebook has no connection however it will still draw people towards MMAT and cause a spike which might be the catalyst for a short squeeze
MMTLP is not MMAT. There are no documents on file with the SEC that gives any truthful information whatsoever on MMTLP. Be concerned.
i want my meta glasses now. my occulus gives me headaches. even tho ar and vr are different....
Pull harder shorts! I will buy every $0.10 drop buy buy buy lol
"So what is the deal with this up and down class A preferred stock? I understand there is some assets that need to be sold. This I don't understand, I must be missing something."
"If this ticker symbol was created by hedge funds to trick people in to selling shares, thats genius. Then to start it a 10 cents and run it up too $3 so investors think they are getting 3000% profit, thats the icing on the cake. I will take some profit it it gets to $5, but holding majority until news of dividend price. My thought is the assets are worth more than initially thought and funds are desperate to buy back or gets preferred shares cheap."
Everyone on this board is all consumed with MMLTP and have lost focus on the real stock here which is MMAT...hence the shorts have been able to pound down the stock price due to very low volume.
Tomorrow is the big day
"Tomorrow good day for MMAT , top gainer stock after changing the name for fb to meta , this stock will go above 50$"
Correction 46.8million shares
Did you notice that different news outlet had the same identical news so their HF shorts friends can attack META at full power? We will end green today.
OK MMAT is good stock but Name change to META for FACEBOOK may be confused to MMAT lol. . Who knows but buyer beware!**!
FB will become Metaverse has not happened yet
"I think shorts just started covering. Regardless of name similarity, Meta Material is a solid company, and you can't lose investing!"
I sleep easy holding MMAT.
"Why are folks buying something,they don’t know what it is??"
Sweet Mary of Nazareth!
don't forget to load up on the divy stock mmltp.
Meta material is gonna merg with Facebook and become only meta Thats what i would do if i was Facebook
So many weak people in the stock market in general  Holding strong big believer in the company price going down one day doesn’t mean it’s gonna stay there wake up people the stock market is just a fancy roller coaster
FB is using meta products on social media that's why we green today smdh
"If you believe the dividend will be more than the current price of MMTLP, you should buy MMTLP.

"I checked george twit , it is true that MMAT is meta of FB"
smh. I'm glad I sold half at 5.52 even though it went to over 6 that day. glta. there is no squeeze coming
What do we think the TRCH special dividend will be?
Just a happy Mmat investor for a long time…..
"Buy, this stock is on sale now."
"Just quick question… I got 146 MMTLP shares, and price is 1.14$ each. Does it mean I will get dividend of 1.14$ per share or more when they sell whatever they need to sell?"
"I brought MMAT at $2.7 and dumped all at $3.8, then it went all the way to $6. I have been kicking myself ever since."

Green Day’s ahead
"I currently have 550 MMTLP. Ihave $1000 to invest, should I buy more?."
"I just saw a video from trading secrets that's alarming. We all know George just started an oil company called oilco. If George decides to keep the land for drilling then we get no asset dividend. It seems we could get a $3-$5 per share worth of his new company. I also heard that buried down deep in the deal is that if there is an agreement in place, a delay beyond Dec 28 would be probable. I dont like the news of this. I thought we would realistically get $13-$15 per share after a lucrative land deal sale. I'm not as confident as I once was."

"Matt / JG et al...I received a little clarity ( for me ) from IR over the weekend....stuff that you guys have pretty well covered.The company had no plans for MMTLP to ever trade as an independent unit, but some MM / broker figured out how to make it happen and did.The question that I still have concerns the shorts.While I consider anything under a buck-fifty to be a very juicy speculation...based upon the opinion of an oil guy who I trust's opinion as to the eventual value of the Orogrande lease....the short ""opportunity"" is kinda' tough for me to wrap my head around.Since MMTLP will definitely cease to exist, could the shorts not knock this down to a dime / quarter / half buck...knowing that they'll never have to cover?While it would ""only"" be a riskless $1.00+ profit for them as of this AM, would that not be a safe trade for a short?What am I missing here?Thanks for your thoughts!"
"Welcome back shorts, tell us how you’re feeling?"
"i wish someone in the know would discuss the mmat products ,,,Please"
Facebook changing name to META. Deal in the works! Could they be buying us out?
Meta from Facebook. Coincidence they are all conferring. Now Meta can charge for intellectual property. Amortization as it were.
"i have a question, i have a small amount of these shares, only 13 but i bought them before they were taken off the marktet. Now all my 13 shares at a cost of $0.00. Meaning its nothing but profit. Looking for good recommendation. Should i hold or sell?"
MMAT with so much amazing product & technology... Where is it? Why are you keeping it from the world?
why the jump after hours?
investors in MMAT will receive a new pair of glasses in the mail
$7 tomorrow?

Why it’s always down?
Oh shorties...I can hear you cry watching the afterhours action :/
Wow... This company sure does appoint a lot of people to not really sell anything. Where are your amazing products? Please stop hiding them from us.
168 million shares...9.8 billion estimated assets. . I like the math
Augmented reality glasses coming up with facebook and microaoft as clients? remember microsoft just got a contract to provide military with AR glasses
"why are we shorting this ??, can the days leave this for a week"
Hmmm seems like there’s a 50/50 opinion on MMTLP in this crowd. Red pill or blue pill people which one is it lol
"FB, welcome to THE Metamaterial world."
WHERE ARE YOU GEORGE?
Buckle up yall
AR eyewear is this the one that will be used for Facebook?
oil prices are going up we might see $20/div
Shorts want your dividend so they want you to sell. Dont fall for it.
META can easily open above $7 tomorrow.Thumbs up if you agree.GLTA
do your research guys. not only can they make the glasses they can also make chips. but smaller. Google unicorn stock. this is a unicorn. and a possible squeeze play short term. don't forget mmlpt for a divy as well. dd away from yahoo. you will find plenty of info on this unicorn opportunity
Can not buy or sell on TD.
"metamaterials appeal to most industries. healthcare, solar energy, automation, home car automotive, telecommunications…etc. can be further sorted."
lets get to $10 tomorrow
"It looks like a collaboration with Microsoft looking at the latest news release. Wow, that’s huge and just a fraction of their verticals in the works."
can't believe this goes up because FB changes name to Meta.
Facebook rebrands it's name to Meta
Iam 100% sure once I sell in less than 2 weeks this will be over $15 but I will not I will set of their breathing F them- I have the whole world patience. Take it to $0.50 cents I don’t give a dam sell the company I don’t give a Sh1t bankrupt I don’t care
"My thinking is the SP dipping because of the drilling costs. Which means this will be a massive upswing once they consume those assets. Not only for the dividend but for MMAT, too. Buy the dip IMO!"
Shorts are taking advantage of the dangerously low volume. We haven’t reached are average volume in weeks we are averaging 4-8 mil per day which is very low
meta $mmat is meta $fb
Where do people see MMAT stock price by end of the year 2021?
LETS GO 50$
"Like many here, I own MMAT and the new MMTLP. Wondering if anyone is adding to their position of MMTLP?"
Lol
"If I was holding original preferred shares awaiting the dividend.....I would NOT be attempting to trade these shares from the account where my shares were initially deposited.I have a funny feeling that any sell orders will be marked on the ledger as coming from your original batch and will negate your claim for the dividend.If I felt it necessary to trade these, I would do so ONLY from a secondary account. I just have a funny feeling about this."
That's a short attack

I was buying MMTLP shares yesterday and again this morning under the MMTLP symbol. It appears that Fidelity just changed all the MMTLP shares and replaced with the same number of shares of 59134N203 Meta Materials pfd A. Can no longer buy shares. Thoughts?
Fidelity does not show MMTLP anymore in my account. It' s back to the original #'s but with all the shares I recently bought.
This appears to be the last shaking of the tree before heading to 10+
A whale would be lovely at this point.
From the moment we all recieve our dividend share and using this money to buy more MMAT shares. We will surely see a spike on the price. Imagine there were 165millions preferred dividend shares. It will cause a pumping action on that day.
Do you expect to reinvest your divi in MMAT? I am not entitled to any but interested to know the general thinking.
Welcome mmat to Facebook This is will skyrocket on Friday
CEO just doubled his shares ownership to 32M+ shares now...that's huge!...
George said good things will happen during Fall season!
perhaps we need another stellar news break; something like the appointment of the mother of all VP'S of Talent and Culture.
"good grief, people. This company has NOTHING TO DO WITH FACEBOOKhttps://www.reuters.com/business/whats-name-meta-materials-soars-after-facebook-name-change-2021-10-29/"
"Why are people believing, there is a link between FB and MMAT???FB is a social media company. Not a technology company.I even can't believe that FB would really change their name into META!!PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I MISSED SOMETHING."
grab an ice cap and chill for a bit. then smoke a J and enjoy the ride
"Is MMAT legitimate? I saw one report that says they have fewer than 10 employees?!? And annual revenue - not profit - was around half a million dollars?!?TDAmeritrade shows their ""price-to-sales"" ratio at 1,059-to-1!!!! Average is around 12-to-1.What gives?I own a small position, and I wonder if I've being scammed?"
"I just bought 500 shares, not much but all I'll put in on this until we see that Monday conference. This is looking bullish"
Any help understanding I own my preferred shares. But is the dividend gonna be a additional payment and we still keep the preferred shares? Any help please
"This Stock is really going to break all records with good business ownership of Social media Lomotif, crypto and other common business deals....it has all the power to outshine and ourperform and i am not even talking about Short Squeeze....if $MMAT price can go high with rumourse of joint venture with facebook...why not an American company which can stand against a Tictok and capture miltibillion dollar business market share...Great days ahead for $BBIG"
Too much pain.
"I’m not one to really watch my stocks like a hawk, and dropped about 300$ into TRCH back in June - probably because a friend had researched it or something, it doesn’t matter. I just got around to actually checking out this MMAT that I got in the merger (that I assume I knew was coming back then), and it sure as heck looks like I dropped 300$ on TRCH just to get handed 35 shares of a consistently valued MMAT stock at 3-5$/share - aka 150$ worth. And then 35 shares of this MMATP, that’s only been worth 1.2-1.5$ a share, so less than 50$. Did I get shafted so badly by this merger that my 300$ was valued straight into a mere $200? Is that not the opposite of how mergers usually go for stock holders? (Assuming no bankruptcy)"
"It is not going to be bad if ppl think that MMAT is related to FB META, for a while, I remembered once people have bought twitter stock in a wrong tick during IPO and this small company skyrocket by mistake. It is a better change it can go up in the short term."
Market watch has sett recomandatio from hold to buy
"Huge environmental investment firm purchase 48+ million shares reported last evening via SEC submission. Usually 10 days to acquire all the shares. Often the SEC filing comes near the end of that level of share acquisition. This filing was done on the first day of that process. My understanding is that over the next 10 business days these will be taken out of the existing float of a 120million +. Wow....Appreciate anyone else's insights on these rules. This firm is a environmental clean/green products investment group. This is not a take over bid, even though they will be the largest single owner of MMAT Stock 16.7%. This could be a helluva run."
Facebook news will run this stock!
"Mr. Carlos Smits as Vice President, Talent and Culture. How about MMAT focuses on making money instead of getting woke?"
"Just heard the truth on these so called preferred shares. The hedge funds need to cancel out millions of shares or they are responsible for the dividend. They fund everyone's account with $0.10 per share thinking it's a real dividend. After running it up a few bucks their goal was to make people sell and take 1800% profit. If sold your shares would be gone and their would no longer be a placeholder for the real dividend coming later. Shorts stop at nothing to ttick and deceive people. The company should come out and expose this activity and say we are seeing assets in the range of $12 min per share which would squeeze this to $100. The money in your account is NOT from assets rather it's a loan from shorts to trick you into selling you're preferred shares. Now that you've been warned, sell and be done or watch the shorts take this back down to $0.25 since their ploy was unearthed. Your choice. I'm waiting for the real thing. This is how underhanded they really are."
METAVERSE
MMAT may have to change their name so as not to be confused with Facebook!! https://www.wsj.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-to-sketch-out-facebooks-metaverse-vision-11635413402?st=2v4qw7dhcwq40ak&reflink=article_imessage_share

Surely the AWE has some agenda to at the least swap ideas and set guidelines to the path forward. Rumors are our best friend at this time. We will hold for the actual PR that proves us wrong. GO META !"
What makes you guys so sure FB is merging or buying MMAT???
I think there is something beyond about the name change we don't see just right now.
Nice but can anyone explain this run?
"I have been in investor in TRCH since 2015. There is a lot of FUD on this channel. The drilling is not MMAT trying to commercialize the oil fields for themselves. Every year since TRCH leased the mineral rights on the land from the University, they have to meet minimum requirements around drilling set out in the contract. They have already proven the oil and gas assets enough to sell the land, but until they sell they have to keep drilling per their contract with the University. They got a brief reprieve during 2020-COVID, but that reprieve is over. If they failed to continue drilling they will be in violation of their lease agreement and we all know that is not good. All that drilling is to MMAT today is additional COST, but important cost to keep to maintain legal adherence to the contract. Comment #2 I see so many messages and YouTubers talk about how the price of oil today is going to drive up the value of the dividend. This is a false assumption. It takes 3-7 years for a company to drill enough wells to make the land produce at a commercial level. The price of oil today is almost meaningless, its all about what they predict the price of oil to be in 3-7 years that matters. The only correlation you can claim today's price of oil having on the sale of the land , is that companies are more flush with cash today due to high oil prices to afford expanding and buying new land/drilling new wells."
i love the stock  
"$1.18! Okay, I'll buy more shares. If George was right about the dividend being between 1 and 20, I would at most lose 18 cents a share but I could gain up to $18.80 a share. I figure I'll at least double my investment."
MMTLP price should also follow MMAT tomorrow!! LETS GO!
"hi guys, do you know how MMTLP works ? Per I know, this was given ex-dividend for who have shares of TRCH before the merge. So, the one who has TRCH shares were eligible to receive the dividends. Now, this OTC appears, the question I have is, this preferred share has the right for the dividend, if the person who owns it, sell it they will loose the opportunity to receive the dividend late this year. It is everything that hedge funds want. The question I have and I was not able to found an answer for it is, if I buy these preferred share from who is selling it, will i have right to receive the dividends as well ? Appreciate if anyone could clarify it. Thanks,"
Now that Fidelity stopped selling where can MMTLP even be bought?
"My MMTLP has a price assigned to it today and it's fluctuating like a traded stock. I thought this was just a straight dividend, not a traded stock. Does anyone have any info about this? I'm on TD. Thanks."

I want a big piece of assets sales from Trch oil and land! It is amazing !

I hate getting caught up in these pissant spec stocks they go down from the day you buy in and if you bail it goes up like a blue origin rocket! 
"For those that say that MMAT and FB have nothing to do with each other, do not believe them. George would not tweet out a welcoming FB to Meta . That would be fraud.

"So how does this share price correlate with the price of the dividend? I understand these mmtlp shares arent mmat...so what exactly are they, and if the dividend is being paid in dec as a 1 time payment, how is there value to these?"
When are they paying the dividend?
"Really low volume, up against resistance, 20% off recent high, should bounce at least 10% higher short term because it appears selling pressure has abated. Positive news could launch the stock from here."

What is really going on here?Very weird
Let it go to 50$ tomorrow
RE: MMTLP; 11 trading days since this all started and not a peep out of George. I think he's involved buying preferred on the cheap. If that's true he's not loyal to the preferred holders I don't care what that email we got says. Fact is the email states MMAT is not involved BUT OilCo sure could be. I wonder why my TD account shows the stock as Meta Materials Preferred Series A ? Can anyone answer that?

"The MMTLP shares in my Fidelity account have reverted back to numbers. And there is no buy or sell option. Just allows 'research' (which is entirely useless). There is a lot of controversy over the 'validity' of the legalities and ethics relating to these shares. I'm entirely confused as to what they've been up to but it states MM's and Hedgies created these shares as a way to buy those dividends from original TRCH owners who are willing to sell. Many (lots of info in YouTube) feel that those who shorted the stock are in too deep and want to buy these dividends (by 'whatever means') in an effort to cover their losses. Also, as they shorted the stock, they have to pay dividend proceeds, which could turn into a huge amount of payout on their part. So, if they can buy the dividends, they don't have to pay themselves. Again, I'm entirely lost on what's true and what's not. We'll see. Bottom line: don't sell. YouTube 'gurus' are claiming these dividends could exceed $20 - $30/sh.. The sale of TRCH assets are being valued as in the billions of $."
"For those who have been waiting for a PR, George got the biggest one for us yesterday. Mark did it himself for us. FB disclosing about Metaverse will be an eye opening for many other companies. Metamaterial has many technologies needed to reach there so get ready for more good news.Thumbs up if you agree.GLTA"
Anyone here anything more/current about Meta and Tesla collaboration ?
Excited that @Metamaterialtec have won two #innovation awards at the TechConnect World 2021. #GoBeyond  https://t.co/H1FDZj29Kg

Dear Miss Woods ................ Dear Mr. Buffet .......... We wish lol
"“The company, is should be noted, is completely separate from Facebook/Meta.” -Market Watch"
"I am a huge MMAT fan. I am happy to take the green that FB’s name change is creating. But I don’t think there is a direct link, although it’s not out of the realm of possibility they are setting one up. FB clearly knows META is taken by MMAT, they are not stupid and would not have done this change lightly and with their own DD. I don’t think they would have done that without knowing there would be some public conception of linking them to the already existing META (MMAT). I mean FB is massive, really think they would do something like this without a plan? Just my humble opinion of course. Good luck everyone"
max is the new fudster. time to change your name again boiler boy
"Meta Materials, a Canadian material science company confused for FB, just too funny"
That was a beautiful gap fill.
Catch us !!!!!
Shorties may have to use magnifying glass from now on when trying to see red. They r all colour blind from now on buy buy buy lol
Lets go to 50 $ waiting for months
"I have gone from checking this stock 10-20 times a day to just 2 or 3. Sometimes I forget about it until after lunch. I hope to reach a point where I can leave it for days or weeks at a time but due to its volatility and having a significant % of my net worth in this one (early MMAT employee options) I can't. We constantly come back to see if there is any news or movement on the share price, most days there isn't and we get frustrated. Here are a few things I tell myself so that I can cope with this crazy rollercoaster ride:1. They are not setting up a massive production facility for nothing2. The tech is unique, highly defensible and solves real problems - validated by the breadth of corporate partnerships that they have3. Whilst the Nanotech acquisition feels expensive at ~12x, we must not forget that the 'productization' of technology is not something to take for granted - NanoTech have done this and MMAT have bought the platform and know-how to do this4. Big corporates such as Covestro and Airbus move slowly, they will take their time in validating solutions before bringing them to market in force - this is frustrating for those of us that are used to fast moving early-stage companies5. The large positive and negative share price swings are driven due to the large proportion of retail investors in this stock. Retail investors are more fickle than institutions. There will come a point at which the company makes more revenue, is further de-risked making it attractive to institutional investors who over time will make up the majority. All that said, we wouldn't be here without the support of the retail investor community so THANK YOU!"
"With MMAT existing patents related to MetaVerse/Holograms techonology, META/FB would definitely need MMAT to succeed on this new platform no matter what..."
"My question is, if no body can buy or sell this mmtlp. How in the hell is the price moving. Who is trading it?"
"Ok, All in 20,000 shares of MMTPL. Lets gooooo!"
"I own a bunch of MMTLP but am a little confused about the price action. I realize these are just place holders for the dividend but why is the price dropping? If there is a limited float of 160 million I would think that these ""place holders"" would be more expensive as people keep buying up any available shares. I would certainly think that shorts would be scrambling to buy. What am I missing?"
"$MMAT if you came for Facebook, stick around this is going to be bigger. We are Meta "
Wow wow just wow
"How is it still possible to get dividend shares due to mmltp?! Back in june they stated, you can Only receive dividend if you hold Your trch shares from 22-24 june!"
"There is an AWE panel Nov 1st called - AR Eyewear Engineering Challenges and the Role Advanced Optical Materials Could Play. It includes people from MMAT (Meta), FB, Microsoft and some other players in the AR field. This paired with the timing of the name change to META and the CEOs tweet is very coincidental and leads to speculation. It is just speculation at this point but thats the time to buy in, if proven true it will start running and you'll be chasing it. Could the speculation be wrong? sure it could, but theres no sure things in the stock market. I was bagholding from the TRCH merger and had bought more to average down so I'm already here and hoping it runs. I don't know that I would buy in if I wasn't already in but a lot of times I pass on things and regret it later sooooo......"
Can someone post a link about this meeting.
I've been here since TRCH. I never left and added.
"Hopefully this can squeeze the stock. But since most of shareholders are retail ppl, they should starting selling soon ... unfortunately"
"There are a few on here who are spreading FUD but claim to be telling the truth. More like a convenient truth to serve their own interests and leave out what the restThey are making a killing you know:), so they boast. By spreading FUD, they hope to get you to sell your shares.Don't fall for it. This stock has a lot of potential!"
