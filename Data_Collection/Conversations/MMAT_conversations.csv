Get ready for a spike. People are now realizing all of the collaborations going on. Facebook changing their name and a Tesla collab in the works. The current price is extremely undervalued which is why after hours is rolling. Get ready for the next few weeks.
Shorts are in trouble tomorrow. They never seen this coming! What a surprise!!! FB --> META!
"For those that say that MMAT and FB have nothing to do with each other, do not believe them. George would not tweet out a welcoming FB to Meta . That would be fraud. We have all the technology FB is looking for to move forward. Have Patients and let this play out. George said in September that November would be epic. He also said he was in talks with Zucherberg Next week this will Boom!"
What’s the deal ? ??
META can easily open above $7 tomorrow.Thumbs up if you agree.GLTA
Facebook rebrands it's name to Meta
There are only 2 months left to collect our diamonds bags !!! Just bought another 100k today

I want a big piece of assets sales from Trch oil and land! It is amazing !
"There is an AWE panel Nov 1st called - AR Eyewear Engineering Challenges and the Role Advanced Optical Materials Could Play. It includes people from MMAT (Meta), FB, Microsoft and some other players in the AR field. This paired with the timing of the name change to META and the CEOs tweet is very coincidental and leads to speculation. It is just speculation at this point but thats the time to buy in, if proven true it will start running and you'll be chasing it. Could the speculation be wrong? sure it could, but theres no sure things in the stock market. I was bagholding from the TRCH merger and had bought more to average down so I'm already here and hoping it runs. I don't know that I would buy in if I wasn't already in but a lot of times I pass on things and regret it later sooooo......"
"Imagine in the early 1900s you were able to invest in plastic. Maybe you didn't really understand what it was but people talked about how we'd be able to use it to cut cost and boost performance over a range of products. Now fast forward 120 years and you have MetaMaterials. A new ""material"" that can be used to cut costs and enhance a huge range of products. ""Almost every great advancement in technology can be attributed to a breakthrough in material science."""
$7 tomorrow?
"For those who have been waiting for a PR, George got the biggest one for us yesterday. Mark did it himself for us. FB disclosing about Metaverse will be an eye opening for many other companies. Metamaterial has many technologies needed to reach there so get ready for more good news.Thumbs up if you agree.GLTA"
"Not to the moon, we are going beyond. Jupiter is the goal. The future is Bright for META."
it was the plan all along .
"$MMAT if you came for Facebook, stick around this is going to be bigger. We are Meta "
"metamaterials appeal to most industries. healthcare, solar energy, automation, home car automotive, telecommunications…etc. can be further sorted."
I think there is something beyond about the name change we don't see just right now.
"After sorting through posts and the news release, yea I think something could be in the works. Let's stay positive!"
