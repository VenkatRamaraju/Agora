Can someone explain how exactly the preferred affects common and how there will be different dividends?
"Was this a one time payment to shareholders, or is this trading like a stock with normal fluctuations ? Please dont attack, im just asking--"
"this is bargin, once they prove they can mass produce it is game changer"
Does anyone have an idea as to the size of the float of the preferred shares. My understanding is that what is being traded in the preferred is the value of the anticipated dividend.
Is this going to turn into a cash dividend or are we supposed to sell it?
Use TD to buy/sell this. Easy
The SEC needs to ask some hard questions to Fidelity....SEC must have people monitoring social media; probably an army of people.
"let your FUD overtakes you, you will lose divi and mmat eventually. buy buy buy lol"
"My question is, if no body can buy or sell this mmtlp. How in the hell is the price moving. Who is trading it?"
"$13 plus $13 from shorts to cover, $26?? IMHO $20-$40 divs, placeholders will run up $10-30"
Wonderful! Exciting!
They’re drilling that oil boys and girls. Get your divvies ready! Wooooo!!
The amount of people here who are completely clueless about what is going on scares me! Do some DD people! By DD I mean not just reading Yahoo message boards.
"Like many here, I own MMAT and the new MMTLP. Wondering if anyone is adding to their position of MMTLP?"
Free shares plus dividend? If that rumor is true .................
"This stock MMTLP is ""pink "" you need a broker that trades OTC , like Fidelity or TD"
"Don't sell , I added another 200 , you have to use a broker that trades pink , like Fidelity and TD"
Why would the MMTLP shares be cancelled in Robinhood ? After the dividend is paid ? Can somebody explain what Robinhood means or what it means to shareholders
Excitement over?
Nanotech deal is finalized big week ahead of us
Looks like Fidelity will let you buy MMTLP now I just bought 500 more shares
Oil companies their place and equipment if oil is moving towards $100 . Even dividend will be higher. Usa is in biggest oil crisses .
do not remember buying this stock
"If you believe the dividend will be more than the current price of MMTLP, you should buy MMTLP. MMTLP is the preferred shares and will get the dividend when it is released.PLANO, TX / ACCESSWIRE / June 14, 2021 / Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRCH), an oil and gas exploration company ('Torchlight'), today announced that it has declared a Special Dividend of Series A Preferred Stock to be issued on a one-for-one basis to Common Stockholders of Record as of the close of market trading on June 24, 2021 (subject to adjustment for any reverse split of Torchlight's common stock after the record date but before the dividend is paid). This Special Dividend is to be issued in connection with the previously announced business combination transaction with Metamaterial, Inc.Stockholders of record on June 24, 2021, will be entitled to receive the dividend which will consist of one share of Series A Preferred Stock for each one share of common stock owned on that date (subject to adjustment for any reverse split of Torchlight's common stock after the record date but before the dividend is paid).Holders of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled, on a pro rata basis, to any future net proceeds or other potential benefits derived from the disposition of the oil and gas assets of Torchlight, subject to certain holdbacks."
Should i hold or sell?
"Going through all the youtube and twitter thoughts on whats going on and no one knows for sure. Here are some highlights.1. this is not the dividend, If you sell your shares, you are giving up your dividend rights2. this is not meta's doing, so no PR on this symbol from them3. It went from 10 cents to 3 bucks in one day. Its ok to take a profit, but you dont lose anything if you dont sell, so why not hold and see where this is going.4. someone said some land sold in sept for billions, so we are entitled as dividend holders, but I am not sure of the land sale.5. This could have been created by short sellers to try and get back some of the shares they owe, so the longer you hold the more the squeeze6. The are trying to compare this to overstock which went from $8 to $80. 7. dividends will be coming in groups, not all at once as assets are sold. They will appear as money in your account just like any other dividend. so once again, nothing concrete, a lot of speculation. Take profit if you want, nothing wrong with that, hold for the really big money because this is not the dividend."
I was buying MMTLP shares yesterday and again this morning under the MMTLP symbol. It appears that Fidelity just changed all the MMTLP shares and replaced with the same number of shares of 59134N203 Meta Materials pfd A. Can no longer buy shares. Thoughts?
Will we be able to buy more of these shares?
"If this ticker symbol was created by hedge funds to trick people in to selling shares, thats genius. Then to start it a 10 cents and run it up too $3 so investors think they are getting 3000% profit, thats the icing on the cake. I will take some profit it it gets to $5, but holding majority until news of dividend price. My thought is the assets are worth more than initially thought and funds are desperate to buy back or gets preferred shares cheap."
Don’t sell your preferred shares that’s how the shorts cover!!! Hold until we get PR!!! You’ve held this long continue to keep holding
Is There a report of how many shares were hold from 22-24 june! That should be the amount of shares that will be entitled for the dividend! This amount can’t change due to mmtlp!!
Love this one short in the chat so scared for Monday 
Wait till real divends come in do not sell please
"volume is rising means more shorts are buying back your preferred stocks to avoid paying the dividend + the interestrate , do not sell unless it hits 20+$ .."
#1 TRENDING on STOCKTWITS.
I knew not to sell my Preferred shares and they just went up from $.70 to $.90 They are trying to get us to sell before all the assets are sold. I've held for this long so I'll hold just a bit longer...
All IN AND IM HOLDING TIL $15-25+ fundamentals are rock solid
"I'm thinking...MMTLP shorts will run it down to $1.00, maybe .70cents ... then it will make a strong run back UpBuy it while it's low"
Pretty sure TD ameritrade is the only platform allowing buying. Others like Robinhood are only allowing selling of the shares you already own
"Let's go green mmat, komo stock"
If this is a no brainer then why aren't people buying these shares?I will do more research and if the value really is going to be $12 and above then I will buy.One thing I have been wondering is about the liabilities. Are there any - Are there any environmental issues like a superfund expenditure i.e. cleanup from oil on the property etc. that could reduce the value or even make it negative?
Stay focus on MMAT.
Shorts are putting this on sale. Load the boat.
Here she got up and up and up...News on Monday
"Hi all. While the upcoming prospects of MMTLP are exciting, please remember that MMAT is the main play. We need more volume to drive a gamma Lambo to the moon. Buy buy buy if you can. My opinion."
"shorts needs to buy our series A stocks to avoid paying the dividend, this might squeeze to the moon .. just hold your shares folks"
Boom!! Shakalaka! BOOM!
"Take this with a grain of salt, as ive read from multiple sources on twitter that those TRCH shorts that didn't cover before the MMAT merger and CUSIP change are now trapped. and they would be forced to ""cover"" once the oil and gas assets from TRCH are sold which is going to happen sooner than later. comparing the squeeze similar to OSTK. That's not why I'm here but it sure would be cool if true! Have a great day!"
I would be careful buying this on otc if your new. Meta didn’t authorize this and it’s mm with millions of shares . If you buy this there’s a good chance it’s a synthetic preferred share your buying
Be wary of shorts trying to buy out your divvies! HOLD!!
"So the Institutions buy 85 million shares, a large percentage over $6- and they sell them to us for $5.10 sounds like a good business. For Us !!!"
if anyone wants my rights I have 8k of them for sale at 20 dollars
its tradeable on fidelity this morning
"So how does this share price correlate with the price of the dividend? I understand these mmtlp shares arent mmat...so what exactly are they, and if the dividend is being paid in dec as a 1 time payment, how is there value to these?"
How to buy in Canada? I'm holding on wealthsimple but cannot buy. TIA
You want my preferred shares????? $35 each and they are yours. All 1400
10 cents or 100$ I’m holding
168 million shares...9.8 billion estimated assets. . I like the math
"Why are folks buying something,they don’t know what it is??"
Can’t buy or sell on vanguard
To buy or sell you need to set limit. Period.
Bye shorts ahahahaha
Can't wait for the divi and watch the shorts have to cover. This stock will go boom to the sky.
i love the stock  
Everybody ia talking about MMAT/MMTLP now...so many YT'ers are covering. We gonna be famous and they will understand what MMAT is. Free marketing....This gonna be huge and many will await for the squeeze bcoz of dividend payout...
Does it go towards $10 or not
Dont sell
This sounds like an AMC thread. I
"Ok, I won't sell. Not until $20 ;)"
hold
MMTLP ......... Just now.
"Here's what I don't like. You should not be able to buy pre-ferred shares. Something does not smell right. Plus they are throwing around crazy numbers, like OSTK stock going from 8 to 80. Or gas going up so land is worth billions. Or squeeze is on so don't sell until 100. CEO even put idea dividend could be worth $20 in everyones head. Looking at it with common sense, if the dividend was huge, wouldnt someone figure out how to keep it? Do you think a company is just going to give away billions? How are there millions of shares available to pick up, did millions of people sell theirs at 10 cents? Are they just creating more shares to dilute the payout? I watched 10 youtube stock specialists yesterday and they had no idea what this was."
"If I was holding original preferred shares awaiting the dividend.....I would NOT be attempting to trade these shares from the account where my shares were initially deposited.I have a funny feeling that any sell orders will be marked on the ledger as coming from your original batch and will negate your claim for the dividend.If I felt it necessary to trade these, I would do so ONLY from a secondary account. I just have a funny feeling about this."
this is my new favorite ticker  when george/company finally give us some info this will fly fly. I bought 1500 more
"All preferred shares are linked to street name ? As long as you have $MMTLP, you will get the dividend ?"
someone explain to me why the price is going up I thought the dividend was just a set amount in dollars that they pay per share and you sell. so can you buy and sell preferred shares or what's the deal?
They must come forward and give us a clear message what’s going on regarding our dividend
CEO just doubled his shares ownership to 32M+ shares now...that's huge!...
"You can have all 10,579 of my preferred shares at 10 dollars!"
can anyone comment on MMAT1 options? according to chat boards they are available by calling your broker. I do not see them listed on the exchange however. I want both the stock and preferred options.
I just suddenly see wealth simple showing the mmmtl shares on my account is that the dividend . What is that
Sold just because I’m not watching this go back to 10 cents .
im confused on this divi i got....
"My MMTLP has a price assigned to it today and it's fluctuating like a traded stock. I thought this was just a straight dividend, not a traded stock. Does anyone have any info about this? I'm on TD. Thanks."
gonna be an interesting week. i want to hear georgie boy like yesterday.
supposed to be scare? tick tick tick buy buy buy lol
These Preferred A Shares our your rights to receive dividends when TRCH assets are liquidated. They show value because people are buying and believe the dividend to be higher than the trading price. Read this post: https://twitter.com/FocusedMcgregor/status/1447304313148223497?t=htvOtdYVsxYeJbN5S_cCEg&s=19
I just had an email from Meta IR explaining the MMTLP share. Having trouble posting it.This new MMTLP will not give you any part of the dividend when the TRCH assets are sold.
TD Ameritrade is about to make it's users wealthy other brokers are only selling the pref shares as I'm buying them up on td
Finally a great PR! Let's ducking go!
"I've bought 2,000 more for a total of 8,000 Why would anyone sell the preferred stock is beyond me but thanks"
"RBH will be sued for sure!!! They only let you sell your positions when it goes down but you can't buy more !!!They are repeating the same mistakes like they used to do on AMC, NAKD, GME,NOK.... This is such a crime and need to be punished !!!"
not selling a single share below 20 bucks
"So it’s free shares, and there will still be a one time dividend pay! If everyone holds then the shorts won’t be able to cover which means this free money will continue up!!"
This would be at $10 if ppl stop asking the same question ever day. Go on google and educate yourself.
Everyone on this board is all consumed with MMLTP and have lost focus on the real stock here which is MMAT...hence the shorts have been able to pound down the stock price due to very low volume.
Any help understanding I own my preferred shares. But is the dividend gonna be a additional payment and we still keep the preferred shares? Any help please
Can not buy or sell on TD.
It Will pop when we get rid of Torchlight. To much confusion now.
hold the bag until dec and u will see it go up. short increase 20% since last week. there will not be ss in short term.. buy buy buy lol
Someone please explain to me the difference between mmat and mmtlp. I own 100 shares of mmat.
Don't forget that THE future belongs to MMAT.
I smell like dividend + spin off sinxe they have 3 properties...The biggest one for dividend and the spinoff for the other two which cause a digital dividend squeeze...
Just bought a couple grand worth... since it is down 21%Good luck all!
I don’t no how I got 200 of this but I do but I seem not to be able to buy any more anyone can help me understand thx
Just how much worse can it get?
RE: MMTLP...I guess yahoo finance did not want anymore conversations. The page has been blank for 1 1/2 hours.
"So much misinformation about mmtlp. Go back and re-read the PR from June that discusses the preferred shares. EVERYTHING is explained in that PR. NO this was not created by hedge funds to #$%$ Stop worrying so much about shorts and hedgies and actually learn how this stuff works.For those who keep asking, these shares are placeholders for future dividends that will come from the proceeds when they liquidate. If you sell these shares, you will not receive any proceeds. Again, refer to the June PR."
"Today I bought another 5k shares of MMTLP @ 2.01 each, total of 15k shares now, hoping for a good ROI, let's see in December. Good luck to you all."
The dividend we will receive will be the icing on the cake.HOLD
"People, MMTLP and TRCH have nothing to do with MMAT!!!! Get a grip!"
Now that Fidelity stopped selling where can MMTLP even be bought?
"I can not understand how shareholders can sell their right to the dividend (almost free, had understood if it was $15+) when MMAT did not come out with any press release about any changes at all. Some shareholders seem to believe more in HF's than the company itself in terms of dividends etc, if you have questions or are unsure then go to the company's website and see if anything new has come up. If there has been no new information, then the latest information given last time regarding the dividend applies, how difficult can it be... you doesn't have to be Einstein to understand this simple thing."
can see my preferred shares got sold at the same price as mmat...
G
There are people here who do DD yet they don't all come to the same conclusion.If you have genuine knowledge and experience please give us your perspective. Many of us can't understand how some can buy preferred shares for .10 yet the original holders (TRCH) may have paid $4 or $5.TIA
I want to buy more but can't!!
Some news from Palikaras should be nice now.
So who is the market marker? What authority they have/why they create this ticker?
META Named 2021 Lux Innovator of the Year Award Winner
Stock options expiry oct 15 for MMAT they’re trying to drive this under 5.
"Investor Place : ""It may take time but META will Decline in Price"". SO SORRY!!"
"Who thinks MMPLT will jump to $3 again tomorrow morning? Upvote for yes, downvote for no."
"Hey y’all! So if I hold this through December, past the squeeze and liquidation of assets, do the shares simply turn into mmat? Or does it end in a cash dividend and the stock stops trading? Cheers"
"Hold, do not sell your placeholder shares ;)"
EVERYBODY HOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Let’s go boys
Fidelity does not show MMTLP anymore in my account. It' s back to the original #'s but with all the shares I recently bought.
If you buy these are you not getting access to the special dividend? How could that be legal?
"300k volume, who the heck would sell at this price?"
"Really low volume, up against resistance, 20% off recent high, should bounce at least 10% higher short term because it appears selling pressure has abated. Positive news could launch the stock from here."
If the dividend price is fluctuating due to shorts covering that would explain the jump in SP today. If this is true we should see a good uptrend… and that means the dividend price is still undetermined. Has any one actually tried to sell the divs? Does it let you?
I am trying to set limit $10 to sell MMTLP but rejected by TD. It’s says symbol not recognized. What does mean?
My Broker said it’s true. MMTLP is the dividend ticker. Can be sold at any time or buy more.
Talked to my brother inlaw at Goldman...Dont sell..yes this will likely worth 15.00 20.00 by January 2022...I just bought 10000 more shares with the rest of my money...
robinhood does not let me buy or sell this stock. Come on!
The Sale is pending and this will Pop soon as the Sale and Dividend is declared. This news was a requirement for the purchase to be compliant..
"Just heard the truth on these so called preferred shares. The hedge funds need to cancel out millions of shares or they are responsible for the dividend. They fund everyone's account with $0.10 per share thinking it's a real dividend. After running it up a few bucks their goal was to make people sell and take 1800% profit. If sold your shares would be gone and their would no longer be a placeholder for the real dividend coming later. Shorts stop at nothing to ttick and deceive people. The company should come out and expose this activity and say we are seeing assets in the range of $12 min per share which would squeeze this to $100. The money in your account is NOT from assets rather it's a loan from shorts to trick you into selling you're preferred shares. Now that you've been warned, sell and be done or watch the shorts take this back down to $0.25 since their ploy was unearthed. Your choice. I'm waiting for the real thing. This is how underhanded they really are."
Let them run it up to $50 and Ill consider selling my shares. until then MMTLP is a winning ticket with the prize to be determined.
"How is it still possible to get dividend shares due to mmltp?! Back in june they stated, you can Only receive dividend if you hold Your trch shares from 22-24 june!"
Let the fun begins in few minutes...buy buy buy lol
Buy And hold Trch shorts about to get lit
DO NOT SELL!
"How MMTLP is happening beats my imagination.Not showing on order list. Hey shorty, $30 per share and you can have my preferred units."
"As a mid 20’s investor who has only been in the market for about 2 years, I’m starting to feel confident that picking up 2,700 shares for this dividend back in the middle of summer might have been my smartest move yet. Feeling like I might of just set myself up very nicely to continue growing my portfolio once this dividend comes through. Only time will tell"
I’m expecting a $37-$50 dividend so I’m not selling a single share
It would be GREAT if MMAT could ride the contrails of MMTLP to the stars! I still don't understand how shorts can use MMTLP to cover MMAT but I'm happy to watch this soar today. Whatever it takes to make those preferred shares keep going up. Tripled value already today!
The price action reiterates the confusion.
hold? sell?
"i have a question, i have a small amount of these shares, only 13 but i bought them before they were taken off the marktet. Now all my 13 shares at a cost of $0.00. Meaning its nothing but profit. Looking for good recommendation. Should i hold or sell?"
No sell under 20
don't sell this is a spin off company the preferred shares will come later when they sell the land also shorts have to cover from TRCH so if no one sells its a short squeeze 100% this could go to 100 bucks a share
"Volume is dead, probably won’t hit $3 again unless some news gets leaked."
in an 1hour shorts and shills will pay millions to make this dip 10 percent. I ain't selling.
"The MMTLP shares in my Fidelity account have reverted back to numbers. And there is no buy or sell option. Just allows 'research' (which is entirely useless). There is a lot of controversy over the 'validity' of the legalities and ethics relating to these shares. I'm entirely confused as to what they've been up to but it states MM's and Hedgies created these shares as a way to buy those dividends from original TRCH owners who are willing to sell. Many (lots of info in YouTube) feel that those who shorted the stock are in too deep and want to buy these dividends (by 'whatever means') in an effort to cover their losses. Also, as they shorted the stock, they have to pay dividend proceeds, which could turn into a huge amount of payout on their part. So, if they can buy the dividends, they don't have to pay themselves. Again, I'm entirely lost on what's true and what's not. We'll see. Bottom line: don't sell. YouTube 'gurus' are claiming these dividends could exceed $20 - $30/sh.. The sale of TRCH assets are being valued as in the billions of $."
Jay is paid basher. mute him. 30k comments and no like/dislike activity. Comments of the same type and replies to almost all positive comments. Mute those who do not bring value and beware of Yahoo board!
any news from the conference?
BUY! BUY! if your trading firm allows OTC purchases. BUY before the price rockets!
Love the look of this...let's gooo!
I believe the dividends will be around 13$
I bought MMAT at 5.46 yesterday and don’t understand what people talking about other stuff here 
When are they going to clear up what is going on with the preferred shares?
Was bored so I bought some shares yesterday on fidelity. Today I'm lost on a path to nowhere. Can't buy or sell. I wonder where my money went to. Anyone have a clue?
Open a TD account to trade this gold
I'll hold mine till when and if it gets squeezed to 150 otherwise I can wait 3000 preferred shares you want them your gonna pay
Do NOT sell your MMTLP shares hedge funds are trying to buy them all up right now. This is NOT the dividend it is only the price the Placeholder is trading for.
"For those who held their Trch shares through June 24th, do not sell your mmtlp shares for f you want to qualify for your special dividend which was promised by end of year…….Yes we should all get a certificate and it’s illegal to trade our shares now, but remember it’s a wolf world in wall street….Cheers"
"I got 40k shares sold 5k. to cover my original. LOL. Holding the rest and see how it goes, whatever I get I don't regret. :) the pref A share is new to me and I want to see the end of it."
"This MMTLP is not the dividend payment TRCH holders were expecting. The market makers created this to get you to sell your dividend shares so that shorts from TRCH times have a chance to cover. The land has not been sold yet, it will be much higher then this. There are irregularities in the amounts of shares that were shorted and the actual shares available to short. The shorts are actually trapped from the merger, if you hold through this until land is sold and actual dividend number is announced you will make out much better. It's easy, just hold, make money."
"The fair market price for the dividends should be 16$/share, BUT premium is at 24$+. I would consider selling the preferred shares at 16+"
This is fun. Whatever is going on. Just watch and don’t sell for a couple thousand dollars of profit. This. Could. Be. Yuge!
What do we think the TRCH special dividend will be?
Acquisition of NTS complete
She will start to trend back up to close at 3.00 per share..
"Those awaiting the dividend have nothing to lose! If you sell before Torchlight sells, then that's on you!"
