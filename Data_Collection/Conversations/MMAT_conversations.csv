Shorts are in trouble tomorrow. They never seen this coming! What a surprise!!! FB --> META!
FB will become Metaverse has not happened yet
I sleep easy holding MMAT.
don't forget to load up on the divy stock mmltp.
"This Stock is really going to break all records with good business ownership of Social media Lomotif, crypto and other common business deals....it has all the power to outshine and ourperform and i am not even talking about Short Squeeze....if $MMAT price can go high with rumourse of joint venture with facebook...why not an American company which can stand against a Tictok and capture miltibillion dollar business market share...Great days ahead for $BBIG"
"I have gone from checking this stock 10-20 times a day to just 2 or 3. Sometimes I forget about it until after lunch. I hope to reach a point where I can leave it for days or weeks at a time but due to its volatility and having a significant % of my net worth in this one (early MMAT employee options) I can't. We constantly come back to see if there is any news or movement on the share price, most days there isn't and we get frustrated. Here are a few things I tell myself so that I can cope with this crazy rollercoaster ride:1. They are not setting up a massive production facility for nothing2. The tech is unique, highly defensible and solves real problems - validated by the breadth of corporate partnerships that they have3. Whilst the Nanotech acquisition feels expensive at ~12x, we must not forget that the 'productization' of technology is not something to take for granted - NanoTech have done this and MMAT have bought the platform and know-how to do this4. Big corporates such as Covestro and Airbus move slowly, they will take their time in validating solutions before bringing them to market in force - this is frustrating for those of us that are used to fast moving early-stage companies5. The large positive and negative share price swings are driven due to the large proportion of retail investors in this stock. Retail investors are more fickle than institutions. There will come a point at which the company makes more revenue, is further de-risked making it attractive to institutional investors who over time will make up the majority. All that said, we wouldn't be here without the support of the retail investor community so THANK YOU!"
"The below text from the CEO ( george palikaras) of META from twitter , congratulations for all holders, this is will skyrocket on Friday, On behalf of @Metamaterialtec I would like to cordially welcome @Facebook to the #metaverse. #GoBeyond $MMAT #AR #VR Meta, meet META :-)"
Meta Materials CEO thanking Zuckerberg
"LFG still holding 30,000 shares"
"Ok, All in 20,000 shares of MMTPL. Lets gooooo!"
Get ready for a spike. People are now realizing all of the collaborations going on. Facebook changing their name and a Tesla collab in the works. The current price is extremely undervalued which is why after hours is rolling. Get ready for the next few weeks.
can't believe this goes up because FB changes name to Meta.
"I have been in investor in TRCH since 2015. There is a lot of FUD on this channel. The drilling is not MMAT trying to commercialize the oil fields for themselves. Every year since TRCH leased the mineral rights on the land from the University, they have to meet minimum requirements around drilling set out in the contract. They have already proven the oil and gas assets enough to sell the land, but until they sell they have to keep drilling per their contract with the University. They got a brief reprieve during 2020-COVID, but that reprieve is over. If they failed to continue drilling they will be in violation of their lease agreement and we all know that is not good. All that drilling is to MMAT today is additional COST, but important cost to keep to maintain legal adherence to the contract. Comment #2 I see so many messages and YouTubers talk about how the price of oil today is going to drive up the value of the dividend. This is a false assumption. It takes 3-7 years for a company to drill enough wells to make the land produce at a commercial level. The price of oil today is almost meaningless, its all about what they predict the price of oil to be in 3-7 years that matters. The only correlation you can claim today's price of oil having on the sale of the land , is that companies are more flush with cash today due to high oil prices to afford expanding and buying new land/drilling new wells."
AR eyewear is this the one that will be used for Facebook?
"After sorting through posts and the news release, yea I think something could be in the works. Let's stay positive!"
Meta from Facebook. Coincidence they are all conferring. Now Meta can charge for intellectual property. Amortization as it were.
MMAT may have to change their name so as not to be confused with Facebook!! https://www.wsj.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-to-sketch-out-facebooks-metaverse-vision-11635413402?st=2v4qw7dhcwq40ak&reflink=article_imessage_share
Nice.....
do your research guys. not only can they make the glasses they can also make chips. but smaller. Google unicorn stock. this is a unicorn. and a possible squeeze play short term. don't forget mmlpt for a divy as well. dd away from yahoo. you will find plenty of info on this unicorn opportunity
"I own a bunch of MMTLP but am a little confused about the price action. I realize these are just place holders for the dividend but why is the price dropping? If there is a limited float of 160 million I would think that these ""place holders"" would be more expensive as people keep buying up any available shares. I would certainly think that shorts would be scrambling to buy. What am I missing?"
Beautiful
Just how much worse can it get?
"why are we shorting this ??, can the days leave this for a week"
"Matt / JG et al...I received a little clarity ( for me ) from IR over the weekend....stuff that you guys have pretty well covered.The company had no plans for MMTLP to ever trade as an independent unit, but some MM / broker figured out how to make it happen and did.The question that I still have concerns the shorts.While I consider anything under a buck-fifty to be a very juicy speculation...based upon the opinion of an oil guy who I trust's opinion as to the eventual value of the Orogrande lease....the short ""opportunity"" is kinda' tough for me to wrap my head around.Since MMTLP will definitely cease to exist, could the shorts not knock this down to a dime / quarter / half buck...knowing that they'll never have to cover?While it would ""only"" be a riskless $1.00+ profit for them as of this AM, would that not be a safe trade for a short?What am I missing here?Thanks for your thoughts!"
"I checked george twit , it is true that MMAT is meta of FB"
"With MMAT existing patents related to MetaVerse/Holograms techonology, META/FB would definitely need MMAT to succeed on this new platform no matter what..."
"i wish someone in the know would discuss the mmat products ,,,Please"
Nice but can anyone explain this run?
"hi guys, do you know how MMTLP works ? Per I know, this was given ex-dividend for who have shares of TRCH before the merge. So, the one who has TRCH shares were eligible to receive the dividends. Now, this OTC appears, the question I have is, this preferred share has the right for the dividend, if the person who owns it, sell it they will loose the opportunity to receive the dividend late this year. It is everything that hedge funds want. The question I have and I was not able to found an answer for it is, if I buy these preferred share from who is selling it, will i have right to receive the dividends as well ? Appreciate if anyone could clarify it. Thanks,"
"I think shorts just started covering. Regardless of name similarity, Meta Material is a solid company, and you can't lose investing!"
I have to think the meta on Facebook has no connection however it will still draw people towards MMAT and cause a spike which might be the catalyst for a short squeeze
"I just bought 500 shares, not much but all I'll put in on this until we see that Monday conference. This is looking bullish"
i want my meta glasses now. my occulus gives me headaches. even tho ar and vr are different....
"5. What happens to my dividend if I sell the Series A shares? The right to receive a Series A dividend in the future is attached to the Series A shares. If you do not hold Series A shares when a record date for a dividend is declared you will not receive the dividend. At the moment, no such record date has been set, or dividend declared, by Meta.If you hold there could be a squeeze here."
Catch us !!!!!
Let it go to 50$ tomorrow
"Short question: Since MMTLP will definitely disappear around Jan 1, is this not a shorter's dream?ie: Short at the current price and you'd never have to cover...right?Now you wouldn't get the spinoff, but at today's price, you'd have a sure-thing buck a share in two months or so....would you not?"
"For those that say that MMAT and FB have nothing to do with each other, do not believe them. George would not tweet out a welcoming FB to Meta . That would be fraud. We have all the technology FB is looking for to move forward. Have Patients and let this play out. George said in September that November would be epic. He also said he was in talks with Zucherberg Next week this will Boom!"
Metaverse!
"so I hold 2k $MMAT shares and non of the $MMATF so I won't receive any share of the sales as dividend, is this correct? but once $MMATF shareholders receive their payout they have no shares in the company, is that correct?"
I've been here since TRCH. I never left and added.
Facebook rebrands it's name to Meta
i love the stock  
What’s the deal ? ??
"Hopefully this can squeeze the stock. But since most of shareholders are retail ppl, they should starting selling soon ... unfortunately"
"Whoever believes that MMAT will be a success, give me a thumbs UP!"
"good grief, people. This company has NOTHING TO DO WITH FACEBOOKhttps://www.reuters.com/business/whats-name-meta-materials-soars-after-facebook-name-change-2021-10-29/"

Green Day’s ahead
Sweet Mary of Nazareth!
Buckle up yall
Correction 46.8million shares
"Most investors understand META is not Facebook. Nice try with the scare tactics. They do however understand based on news reports that META will be holding an AWE Panel that includes Facebook Labs and Microsoft, along with others, on Monday Nov 1st. It sure looks like there is a strong possibility of collaboration with META, Facebook and Microsoft in the AR realm."
Someone please explain to me the difference between mmat and mmtlp. I own 100 shares of mmat.
"I am a huge MMAT fan. I am happy to take the green that FB’s name change is creating. But I don’t think there is a direct link, although it’s not out of the realm of possibility they are setting one up. FB clearly knows META is taken by MMAT, they are not stupid and would not have done this change lightly and with their own DD. I don’t think they would have done that without knowing there would be some public conception of linking them to the already existing META (MMAT). I mean FB is massive, really think they would do something like this without a plan? Just my humble opinion of course. Good luck everyone"
"$1.18! Okay, I'll buy more shares. If George was right about the dividend being between 1 and 20, I would at most lose 18 cents a share but I could gain up to $18.80 a share. I figure I'll at least double my investment."
A whale would be lovely at this point.
"going to be a little while before they are fully profitable, but with the deals in the pipes this is at the bottom of its trend. bought a 1k lot @4.75 strike. itll be 6.00 by next friday easy. i cant wait to see who all signed NDa's i know fb (meta) for sure i hear samsung is on board sony and nintendo also. sony wants to add ar to its legacy movies so it can reformat and resell for a premium. big things are happening and your eyebulbs will be screaming! (w.s. burroughs)"
"There are a few on here who are spreading FUD but claim to be telling the truth. More like a convenient truth to serve their own interests and leave out what the restThey are making a killing you know:), so they boast. By spreading FUD, they hope to get you to sell your shares.Don't fall for it. This stock has a lot of potential!"
FB is using meta products on social media that's why we green today smdh

Our extensive technology platform enables leading global brands to deliver breakthrough products to their customers in consumer electronics, 5G communications, health and wellness, aerospace, automotive, and clean energy."
"My thinking is the SP dipping because of the drilling costs. Which means this will be a massive upswing once they consume those assets. Not only for the dividend but for MMAT, too. Buy the dip IMO!"
grab an ice cap and chill for a bit. then smoke a J and enjoy the ride
Why it is dropping
"This is going to explode soon. AWE panel on AR includes Stanford(who Meta already has a innovative program with, began earlier this year), Facebook, and Meta......WEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!"
Wow red everyday……
168 million shares...9.8 billion estimated assets. . I like the math
I think there is something beyond about the name change we don't see just right now.
"Huge environmental investment firm purchase 48+ million shares reported last evening via SEC submission. Usually 10 days to acquire all the shares. Often the SEC filing comes near the end of that level of share acquisition. This filing was done on the first day of that process. My understanding is that over the next 10 business days these will be taken out of the existing float of a 120million +. Wow....Appreciate anyone else's insights on these rules. This firm is a environmental clean/green products investment group. This is not a take over bid, even though they will be the largest single owner of MMAT Stock 16.7%. This could be a helluva run."
Anyone here anything more/current about Meta and Tesla collaboration ?
OK MMAT is good stock but Name change to META for FACEBOOK may be confused to MMAT lol. . Who knows but buyer beware!**!
$7 tomorrow?
Wow... This company sure does appoint a lot of people to not really sell anything. Where are your amazing products? Please stop hiding them from us.
"Mr. Carlos Smits as Vice President, Talent and Culture. How about MMAT focuses on making money instead of getting woke?"
I want a big piece of assets sales from Trch oil and land! It is amazing !
shorts be sweating.
More Meta failures.https://www.digitalbodies.net/augmented-reality/that-was-fast-three-ar-companies-fail-in-a-month/
"FB, welcome to THE Metamaterial world."
MMTLP is not MMAT. There are no documents on file with the SEC that gives any truthful information whatsoever on MMTLP. Be concerned.
Meta Materials thanking Mark for all the money
"Just quick question… I got 146 MMTLP shares, and price is 1.14$ each. Does it mean I will get dividend of 1.14$ per share or more when they sell whatever they need to sell?"
poor Max trying his hardest to persuade you that MMAT is not for real. hmm wonder what his motive is?
"1 hour agoThe below text from the CEO ( george palikaras) of META from twitter , congratulations for all holders, this is will skyrocket on Friday,On behalf of @Metamaterialtec I would like to cordially welcome @Facebook to the #metaverse. #GoBeyond $MMAT #AR #VR Meta, meet META :-)"

lets get to $10 tomorrow
"Today I bought another 5k shares of MMTLP @ 2.01 each, total of 15k shares now, hoping for a good ROI, let's see in December. Good luck to you all."

"Buy, this stock is on sale now."
Pull harder shorts! I will buy every $0.10 drop buy buy buy lol

This is why I love retail investors. Most of them makes the rest of us look like professionals…LMAO!
Wow just wow
"metamaterials appeal to most industries. healthcare, solar energy, automation, home car automotive, telecommunications…etc. can be further sorted."
Where do people see MMAT stock price by end of the year 2021?
why the jump after hours?
RE: MMTLP; 11 trading days since this all started and not a peep out of George. I think he's involved buying preferred on the cheap. If that's true he's not loyal to the preferred holders I don't care what that email we got says. Fact is the email states MMAT is not involved BUT OilCo sure could be. I wonder why my TD account shows the stock as Meta Materials Preferred Series A ? Can anyone answer that?
The materials in the hands of Mmat are the invention and the latest technology of the century we are in.
Market watch has sett recomandatio from hold to buy
"Why are people believing, there is a link between FB and MMAT???FB is a social media company. Not a technology company.I even can't believe that FB would really change their name into META!!PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I MISSED SOMETHING."
"Haha lets go bros, seriously. Worlds 6 biggest company changes to META. How many funds are holding fb that will look in to new acquisitions. Btw not that many stocks to choose from "
is this related with Facebook?
There are only 2 months left to collect our diamonds bags !!! Just bought another 100k today
"We might be insulted or offended that the ""average"" retail investor might confuse this anomaly. We do not believe we are that naïve. Surely the AWE has some agenda to at the least swap ideas and set guidelines to the path forward. Rumors are our best friend at this time. We will hold for the actual PR that proves us wrong. GO META !"
The Facebook cult going to send this orbital. FOMO about to kick in...lol Let's gooo
"Sorry wrong symbol for Facebook,but its sure a blessing with MMAT."
METAVERSE
Mistaken Facebook Identity Sees Meta Materials Shares Soar 32%
Don't forget that THE future belongs to MMAT.
LETS GO 50$
Facebook changing name to META. Deal in the works! Could they be buying us out?
What is really going on here?Very weird
"Oil & Gas Firm Signs Option Deal to Sell West Texas Property for $12.4 MillionNews UpdateSource: Streetwise Reports (8/17/20)Torchlight Energy entered into an option agreement to sell its 9,600 acre Hazel project to a private investor group for $1,300 per acre."
meta $mmat is meta $fb
Meta 
Bears spreading a lot of FUD today. We must be aboutto move up.Stay positive.
"There is an AWE panel Nov 1st called - AR Eyewear Engineering Challenges and the Role Advanced Optical Materials Could Play. It includes people from MMAT (Meta), FB, Microsoft and some other players in the AR field. This paired with the timing of the name change to META and the CEOs tweet is very coincidental and leads to speculation. It is just speculation at this point but thats the time to buy in, if proven true it will start running and you'll be chasing it. Could the speculation be wrong? sure it could, but theres no sure things in the stock market. I was bagholding from the TRCH merger and had bought more to average down so I'm already here and hoping it runs. I don't know that I would buy in if I wasn't already in but a lot of times I pass on things and regret it later sooooo......"
"Rbh only allowed you to Sell and they took away the “Buy” button for a reason that you should know! Lol rbh is working for those Hfs for quite a while, just a little secret for you to discover!"
bought 100k shares today !!! This is a solid deal !!!
Shorties may have to use magnifying glass from now on when trying to see red. They r all colour blind from now on buy buy buy lol
Too much pain.
"For those who have been waiting for a PR, George got the biggest one for us yesterday. Mark did it himself for us. FB disclosing about Metaverse will be an eye opening for many other companies. Metamaterial has many technologies needed to reach there so get ready for more good news.Thumbs up if you agree.GLTA"
Make meta green again !
Shorts want your dividend so they want you to sell. Dont fall for it.
Tomorrow is the big day
Oh shorties...I can hear you cry watching the afterhours action :/
$100 tomorrow
Meta material is gonna merg with Facebook and become only meta Thats what i would do if i was Facebook
Long you held well. We are not here for short trade. We are here to make history!
it was the plan all along .
MMAT with so much amazing product & technology... Where is it? Why are you keeping it from the world?
"How is it still possible to get dividend shares due to mmltp?! Back in june they stated, you can Only receive dividend if you hold Your trch shares from 22-24 june!"
The word meta conjures the word bankrupt.https://qz.com/2081538/facebooks-meta-rebrand-echoes-a-failed-metaverse-company/
"This MMTLP is not the dividend payment TRCH holders were expecting. The market makers created this to get you to sell your dividend shares so that shorts from TRCH times have a chance to cover. The land has not been sold yet, it will be much higher then this. There are irregularities in the amounts of shares that were shorted and the actual shares available to short. The shorts are actually trapped from the merger, if you hold through this until land is sold and actual dividend number is announced you will make out much better. It's easy, just hold, make money."
Did you notice that different news outlet had the same identical news so their HF shorts friends can attack META at full power? We will end green today.
oil prices are going up we might see $20/div
"Imagine in the early 1900s you were able to invest in plastic. Maybe you didn't really understand what it was but people talked about how we'd be able to use it to cut cost and boost performance over a range of products. Now fast forward 120 years and you have MetaMaterials. A new ""material"" that can be used to cut costs and enhance a huge range of products. ""Almost every great advancement in technology can be attributed to a breakthrough in material science."""

"Tomorrow good day for MMAT , top gainer stock after changing the name for fb to meta , this stock will go above 50$"
MMTLP price should also follow MMAT tomorrow!! LETS GO!
MMAT is not MMTLP. MMAT does not pay a dividend.
