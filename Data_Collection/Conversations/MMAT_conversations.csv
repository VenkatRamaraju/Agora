"The fair market price for the dividends should be 16$/share, BUT premium is at 24$+. I would consider selling the preferred shares at 16+"
I don't understand how a special dividend can be converted into a new company stock(MMTLP) without asking the stockholders how they want their dividend paid. So they sold the TRCH assets and started a new company with our special dividend? What happened to the promise of cash dividend by Dec 31? Is this legal?
"I got 40k shares sold 5k. to cover my original. LOL. Holding the rest and see how it goes, whatever I get I don't regret. :) the pref A share is new to me and I want to see the end of it."
"As a mid 20’s investor who has only been in the market for about 2 years, I’m starting to feel confident that picking up 2,700 shares for this dividend back in the middle of summer might have been my smartest move yet. Feeling like I might of just set myself up very nicely to continue growing my portfolio once this dividend comes through. Only time will tell"
can anyone comment on MMAT1 options? according to chat boards they are available by calling your broker. I do not see them listed on the exchange however. I want both the stock and preferred options.
Just added 1k. 
"How is it still possible to get dividend shares due to mmltp?! Back in june they stated, you can Only receive dividend if you hold Your trch shares from 22-24 june!"
George Palikaras bought more shares
hold the bag until dec and u will see it go up. short increase 20% since last week. there will not be ss in short term.. buy buy buy lol
someone explain to me why the price is going up I thought the dividend was just a set amount in dollars that they pay per share and you sell. so can you buy and sell preferred shares or what's the deal?
"this is bargin, once they prove they can mass produce it is game changer"
I just had an email from Meta IR explaining the MMTLP share. Having trouble posting it.This new MMTLP will not give you any part of the dividend when the TRCH assets are sold.
I was buying MMTLP shares yesterday and again this morning under the MMTLP symbol. It appears that Fidelity just changed all the MMTLP shares and replaced with the same number of shares of 59134N203 Meta Materials pfd A. Can no longer buy shares. Thoughts?
Can someone explain how exactly the preferred affects common and how there will be different dividends?
Do NOT sell your MMTLP shares hedge funds are trying to buy them all up right now. This is NOT the dividend it is only the price the Placeholder is trading for.
Don’t sell your preferred shares that’s how the shorts cover!!! Hold until we get PR!!! You’ve held this long continue to keep holding
"I bought 1500 more today, comfy"
I'm happy with 100% a day. good income.
RE: MMTLP...I guess yahoo finance did not want anymore conversations. The page has been blank for 1 1/2 hours.
"Meta Materials Contract Via US's Federal Procurement Data System Via Bureau Of Engraving And Printing, Date Shows Was Approved Sept. 30, 2021"
Does anyone have an idea as to the size of the float of the preferred shares. My understanding is that what is being traded in the preferred is the value of the anticipated dividend.
Was bored so I bought some shares yesterday on fidelity. Today I'm lost on a path to nowhere. Can't buy or sell. I wonder where my money went to. Anyone have a clue?
"Going through all the youtube and twitter thoughts on whats going on and no one knows for sure. Here are some highlights.1. this is not the dividend, If you sell your shares, you are giving up your dividend rights2. this is not meta's doing, so no PR on this symbol from them3. It went from 10 cents to 3 bucks in one day. Its ok to take a profit, but you dont lose anything if you dont sell, so why not hold and see where this is going.4. someone said some land sold in sept for billions, so we are entitled as dividend holders, but I am not sure of the land sale.5. This could have been created by short sellers to try and get back some of the shares they owe, so the longer you hold the more the squeeze6. The are trying to compare this to overstock which went from $8 to $80. 7. dividends will be coming in groups, not all at once as assets are sold. They will appear as money in your account just like any other dividend. so once again, nothing concrete, a lot of speculation. Take profit if you want, nothing wrong with that, hold for the really big money because this is not the dividend."
Talked to my brother inlaw at Goldman...Dont sell..yes this will likely worth 15.00 20.00 by January 2022...I just bought 10000 more shares with the rest of my money...
Can we get some guidance from the company???
"BUY BUY BUY! for those crying it's not sanctioned by MMAT, or George is tweeting about handbags, or other FUD; give them a finger and do your own risk/reward assessment. If the current price is less than you expect the dividend to be; you know what to do!Hope this helps answer some questions how this ticket got here. it's from adjusted options, not some conspiracy; unless you call the government a conspiracy; but that's fine too!GO GET IT! Looking for $7 end of week, $20 next week. As people pile into the dividend here, this will rocket up to the consensus dividend value! GET IN EARLY!!!!https://www.reddit.com/r/MMAT/comments/q52h02/mmtlp_dividend_is_for_adjusted_options_listed_by/"
I got 4700S of MMTLP today..The cost/share is not showing ...Hav never bought this stock. Anyone?
SAXO bank wont give me my stock
The dividend we will receive will be the icing on the cake.HOLD
Y’all better know what you hold . These will be worth a lot more in about a week. If you can get your hands on them … buy all you can . Lol . Just look up Overstock Squeeze . This all been calculated . CEO of MMAT is playing chess . Shorts are playing checkers . Epic squeeze coming
My Broker said it’s true. MMTLP is the dividend ticker. Can be sold at any time or buy more.
"Was this a one time payment to shareholders, or is this trading like a stock with normal fluctuations ? Please dont attack, im just asking--"
"I use Wealthsimple and MMTLP just showed up yesterday or today, I can only sell. Wish I could get more!"
do not remember buying this stock
"This MMTLP is not the dividend payment TRCH holders were expecting. The market makers created this to get you to sell your dividend shares so that shorts from TRCH times have a chance to cover. The land has not been sold yet, it will be much higher then this. There are irregularities in the amounts of shares that were shorted and the actual shares available to short. The shorts are actually trapped from the merger, if you hold through this until land is sold and actual dividend number is announced you will make out much better. It's easy, just hold, make money."
The amount of people here who are completely clueless about what is going on scares me! Do some DD people! By DD I mean not just reading Yahoo message boards.
"Don't sell , I added another 200 , you have to use a broker that trades pink , like Fidelity and TD"
i love the stock  
#1 TRENDING on STOCKTWITS.
2.5 at openguys your guess?
I just suddenly see wealth simple showing the mmmtl shares on my account is that the dividend . What is that
Just google spin off stock and you will find successful spin off shares skyrocket from $3 to $80 or $120. Tbh I still don't understand how that happened but it did. Let's cross our finger this happens with this one as well
MMAT finally reacting to the MMTLP sharp rise. Both to $10 and we double our money!
"So much misinformation about mmtlp. Go back and re-read the PR from June that discusses the preferred shares. EVERYTHING is explained in that PR. NO this was not created by hedge funds to #$%$ Stop worrying so much about shorts and hedgies and actually learn how this stuff works.For those who keep asking, these shares are placeholders for future dividends that will come from the proceeds when they liquidate. If you sell these shares, you will not receive any proceeds. Again, refer to the June PR."
I smell like dividend + spin off sinxe they have 3 properties...The biggest one for dividend and the spinoff for the other two which cause a digital dividend squeeze...
META Named 2021 Lux Innovator of the Year Award Winner
Love this one short in the chat so scared for Monday 
"People, MMTLP and TRCH have nothing to do with MMAT!!!! Get a grip!"
what is the difference between MMTLP and MMAT?
I would be careful buying this on otc if your new. Meta didn’t authorize this and it’s mm with millions of shares . If you buy this there’s a good chance it’s a synthetic preferred share your buying
"I can not understand how shareholders can sell their right to the dividend (almost free, had understood if it was $15+) when MMAT did not come out with any press release about any changes at all. Some shareholders seem to believe more in HF's than the company itself in terms of dividends etc, if you have questions or are unsure then go to the company's website and see if anything new has come up. If there has been no new information, then the latest information given last time regarding the dividend applies, how difficult can it be... you doesn't have to be Einstein to understand this simple thing."
UpBig news is coming
168 million shares...9.8 billion estimated assets. . I like the math
Can't wait for the divi and watch the shorts have to cover. This stock will go boom to the sky.
How could they buy your shares and not buy the special dividend in the process?
Shareholders approved of the aquisition. Said to officially close the deal on or around Oct. 5th with a Supreme Court approval.
Should i hold or sell?
"$13 plus $13 from shorts to cover, $26?? IMHO $20-$40 divs, placeholders will run up $10-30"
Wait till real divends come in do not sell please
I am trying to set limit $10 to sell MMTLP but rejected by TD. It’s says symbol not recognized. What does mean?
It would be GREAT if MMAT could ride the contrails of MMTLP to the stars! I still don't understand how shorts can use MMTLP to cover MMAT but I'm happy to watch this soar today. Whatever it takes to make those preferred shares keep going up. Tripled value already today!
You want my preferred shares????? $35 each and they are yours. All 1400
These Preferred A Shares our your rights to receive dividends when TRCH assets are liquidated. They show value because people are buying and believe the dividend to be higher than the trading price.

"Like many here, I own MMAT and the new MMTLP. Wondering if anyone is adding to their position of MMTLP?"
"I just bout more MMTLP this morning. 10,000 shares at $0.20 each."
Let them run it up to $50 and Ill consider selling my shares. until then MMTLP is a winning ticket with the prize to be determined.
Free shares plus dividend? If that rumor is true .................
"Ok, I won't sell. Not until $20 ;)"
BUY! BUY! if your trading firm allows OTC purchases. BUY before the price rockets!
When are they going to clear up what is going on with the preferred shares?
"Volume is dead, probably won’t hit $3 again unless some news gets leaked."
"If I was holding original preferred shares awaiting the dividend.....I would NOT be attempting to trade these shares from the account where my shares were initially deposited.I have a funny feeling that any sell orders will be marked on the ledger as coming from your original batch and will negate your claim for the dividend.If I felt it necessary to trade these, I would do so ONLY from a secondary account. I just have a funny feeling about this."

How to buy in Canada? I'm holding on wealthsimple but cannot buy. TIA
The price action reiterates the confusion.
What do we think the TRCH special dividend will be?
What’s the future after selling the stock
DO NOT SELL!
gonna be an interesting week. i want to hear georgie boy like yesterday.
"Hold, do not sell your placeholder shares ;)"
"Who thinks MMPLT will jump to $3 again tomorrow morning? Upvote for yes, downvote for no."
Can't sell it.
Seems to be a lot of confusion about what’s going to happen. But I personally believe in December - January this will pay out nicely. I only had 2500 preferred shares but in this last week I’ve bought another 5000 . Looking to continue to add . If the dividend is only $5 a share it’s still will payout since my average cost is 1.14 . Even if my cost goes to 2.00 and the payout is $5 that’s still easy profit and then you can still sell your shares at whatever it’s trading at . Seems like a no brainer ?
All IN AND IM HOLDING TIL $15-25+ fundamentals are rock solid
Hedge Funds & Shorters must have known something regarding dividend so they are pushing this higher to sell our Dividends... I am only selling for $100 per share... come abd take it!...
I I just tried buying more MMTLP and got rejected
"If you believe the dividend will be more than the current price of MMTLP, you should buy MMTLP.

Is this going to turn into a cash dividend or are we supposed to sell it?
Does it go towards $10 or not
any news from the conference?
Holding both mmat and mmtlp let’s goooooo!!! Who would sell ahahahahhah
Now that Fidelity stopped selling where can MMTLP even be bought?
Upwards we go baby ;)
"For those who held their Trch shares through June 24th, do not sell your mmtlp shares for f you want to qualify for your special dividend which was promised by end of year…….Yes we should all get a certificate and it’s illegal to trade our shares now, but remember it’s a wolf world in wall street….Cheers"
"I don’t think you can sell or buy MMTLP, at least not from my broker"
Can someone explain MMATLP? Have a good chunk of preferred shares and just trying to figure out what is happening with this new release
Im holding forever
in an 1hour shorts and shills will pay millions to make this dip 10 percent. I ain't selling.
Begging you please do not sell your MMTLP shares the dividend has not been assigned yet. If you sell them you will regret it. I am buying what you are selling but I really wish for your sake there were none to buy.

Just providing my thoughts. (@mods please lmk if I need to change my title before banning me :P, reddit is not letting me change it)I keep seeing this over and over again people saying ""why would hedgies pay more than $20 if the divi will be $20"", or ""MMTLP is a steal for $2-$19 if the divi is gonna be $20,"" or ""I don't see this squeezing past $20"".This squeeze has nothing to do with the divi price, the divis are like an NFT, and they are not replicable! They are not trying to buy MMTLP from us to save on paying you $20, they are doing so because they HAVE to or else get liquidated. I think the hedgies were waiting and waiting for the divi to be announced and finally be distributed so they could finally cover the divis by paying cash out of their pockets but George knew this so he kept waiting and didn't sell the oil fields. There will be a time where the banks and brokers are gonna tell these hedgies to pay up the preferred shares or get margin called, and I believe this time is now. They HAVE to get their hands on MMTLP or else get margin called. Based on how desperate they seem to get their hands on MMTLP, I don't think they're doing this so they can save on paying $20 per divi, they are doing this so they don't get liquidated out of existence.So please get out of the mindset of selling at $20, we have too many people who don't understand this and we will have a huge sell off at $20 if everyone keeps thinking this. This situation is basically the same as if GME issued an NFT dividend. The hedgies have to buy up all the naked divis so if we keep holding, we can name our price. I think we can get way way more than $20, and I want to hold for life changing money, but if everyone keeps saying they're selling at $20, or that we won't squeeze past $20, then we will never get there."
Love the look of this...let's gooo!
Oil companies their place and equipment if oil is moving towards $100 . Even dividend will be higher. Usa is in biggest oil crisses .
Excitement over?
They must come forward and give us a clear message what’s going on regarding our dividend
"I am using trading 212 platfrom for trading, and I bought TRCH shares in march this year and I should receive the dividend. But on trading 212 I didn’t receive any MMTLP shares or money in my account.Someone have same problem?"
Use TD to buy/sell this. Easy
"You can have all 10,579 of my preferred shares at 10 dollars!"
"Take this with a grain of salt, as ive read from multiple sources on twitter that those TRCH shorts that didn't cover before the MMAT merger and CUSIP change are now trapped. and they would be forced to ""cover"" once the oil and gas assets from TRCH are sold which is going to happen sooner than later. comparing the squeeze similar to OSTK. That's not why I'm here but it sure would be cool if true! Have a great day!"
Dont sell some people saying sell it sell it if they already sold shares why still in this chat 
Hold & do not sell
"I think this would be a lot higher if the dividend was expected to be more than $10, my guess is it’s gonna be in the 2-3$ range. Sad but logical."
CEO just doubled his shares ownership to 32M+ shares now...that's huge!...
I want to buy more but can't!!
If you buy these are you not getting access to the special dividend? How could that be legal?
"The MMTLP shares in my Fidelity account have reverted back to numbers. And there is no buy or sell option. Just allows 'research' (which is entirely useless). There is a lot of controversy over the 'validity' of the legalities and ethics relating to these shares. I'm entirely confused as to what they've been up to but it states MM's and Hedgies created these shares as a way to buy those dividends from original TRCH owners who are willing to sell. Many (lots of info in YouTube) feel that those who shorted the stock are in too deep and want to buy these dividends (by 'whatever means') in an effort to cover their losses. Also, as they shorted the stock, they have to pay dividend proceeds, which could turn into a huge amount of payout on their part. So, if they can buy the dividends, they don't have to pay themselves. Again, I'm entirely lost on what's true and what's not. We'll see. Bottom line: don't sell. YouTube 'gurus' are claiming these dividends could exceed $20 - $30/sh.. The sale of TRCH assets are being valued as in the billions of $."
Is this run going to continue
Texas Holdum
Fidelity does not show MMTLP anymore in my account. It' s back to the original #'s but with all the shares I recently bought.
I just looked at my account with Schwab. I have both MMAT 2 and MMTLP2. MMAT2 is listed at $5.31 a share and MMTLP2 is $1.80. Is the $1.80 the dividend?. I am confused. It was $2.00 or a little over earlier. The record says it hit the $3.00 mark once and was $0.5 cents at the low. Any body else have this.?
I’m expecting a $37-$50 dividend so I’m not selling a single share
Boom!! Shakalaka! BOOM!
not selling a single share below 20 bucks
Dont sell
"So the Institutions buy 85 million shares, a large percentage over $6- and they sell them to us for $5.10 sounds like a good business. For Us !!!"

MMTLP ......... Just now.
MMAT going to $20 this month.
There are people here who do DD yet they don't all come to the same conclusion.If you have genuine knowledge and experience please give us your perspective. Many of us can't understand how some can buy preferred shares for .10 yet the original holders (TRCH) may have paid $4 or $5.TIA
If this is a no brainer then why aren't people buying these shares?I will do more research and if the value really is going to be $12 and above then I will buy.One thing I have been wondering is about the liabilities. Are there any - Are there any environmental issues like a superfund expenditure i.e. cleanup from oil on the property etc. that could reduce the value or even make it negative?

"My best guess, assets/dividends are much larger than originally thought. Legally, preferred shareholders are only ones entitled to them. So someone created this company to obtain as much of the preferred stock as possible, pennies on the dollar. Remember if you sell your shares, you get no dividends. MMat has nothing to do with this, but didnt George just create a new oil company in texas? Or shorts and naked shorts are trying to get back preferred shares to cover. I'm holding until dividend numbers revealed. I am not and expert, it just makes most sense. I just wonder who created this company and is it limited to only the preferred shares or did they create new ones? If only the number of shares available are the preferred ones, then this could be a very good squeeze. JMO"
"Go google spin-off shares and understand what it is before invest. Especially the case with PayPal. PayPal was a spin off share company too. This could be your chance to financial freedom, chances don't come by often."

This is fun. Whatever is going on. Just watch and don’t sell for a couple thousand dollars of profit. This. Could. Be. Yuge!

"How MMTLP is happening beats my imagination.Not showing on order list. Hey shorty, $30 per share and you can have my preferred units."

This stock is being compared to the OSTK stock when shorts had to cover their special dividends and created a 1000% massive squeeze. I believe the TRCH shorts are still here and will need to cover soon! Buy more and hold! Fasten your seatbelts!
What happens after the merger is finalized? Anything special for us
I am a MMAT person only and wonder if MMAT ( the company) will receive any of the dividend. ??

im confused on this divi i got....

Let’s go !!!!!
"can't trade on RH, maybe that's a good thing lol"
"""They"" ,Whomever ""they"" are, are selling and buying our placeholder for our Torch dividend. It has everything to do with MMAT and our dividend. Rather it is ""OK"" r not is up for debate. If there were a separate divy we would have a place holder for that then as well. So WTAF is really going on?"
"This stock MMTLP is ""pink "" you need a broker that trades OTC , like Fidelity or TD"
I knew not to sell my Preferred shares and they just went up from $.70 to $.90 They are trying to get us to sell before all the assets are sold. I've held for this long so I'll hold just a bit longer...
Not even worried about it. This will give back its GAINS like it does Every day. 6 weeks straight now.
What will happen if I sell preferred stock? Still I will receive dividend? Or is this the dividend?
Everybody ia talking about MMAT/MMTLP now...so many YT'ers are covering. We gonna be famous and they will understand what MMAT is. Free marketing....This gonna be huge and many will await for the squeeze bcoz of dividend payout...
So who is the market marker? What authority they have/why they create this ticker?
Open a TD account to trade this gold
Why do people have to advertise some financial advisor on here? Stay out if the market if you don't know what you're doing!
Love how MMTLP isn’t traded on the nasdaq or NYSE so everyone in Canada that had to buy with Wealth Simple can’t even get their place holder shares I was honestly so excited when I bought TRCH months ago….. it’s kinda been a let down.
I believe the dividends will be around 13$
NO BUYERS !NO MOVEMENTS!
if anyone wants my rights I have 8k of them for sale at 20 dollars
You loved buying this stock at $6. You’ll love buying it at $2
RH IS DOING THE SHADY AGAIN THEY NOT ALLOW TO BUY OR SELL AT ALL.
If the dividend price is fluctuating due to shorts covering that would explain the jump in SP today. If this is true we should see a good uptrend… and that means the dividend price is still undetermined. Has any one actually tried to sell the divs? Does it let you?
Remember OSTK May of 2020...When they issue a Digital Dividend thru Spinoff...Stock Price Squeeze from $3 to $120 and Special Dividend from $8 to $80.Shorters/HF's sued the company as they are saying it is illegal to issue a Digital Dividend... But the court issued with Finality early this month that it is legal and binding.Check history of OSTK folk's. I could be wrong but History can repeats itself...
She will start to trend back up to close at 3.00 per share..
not selling below 20$ .. i will meet you there
Acquisition of NTS complete
No sell under 20
Wonderful! Exciting!
RH doesn't let me do anything to this stock...as it sinks
Let the fun begins in few minutes...buy buy buy lol
"300k volume, who the heck would sell at this price?"
don't sell this is a spin off company the preferred shares will come later when they sell the land also shorts have to cover from TRCH so if no one sells its a short squeeze 100% this could go to 100 bucks a share
These shares do not dilute the common stock . They are separate . Why am I explaining this . Preferred Shares get paid a dividend ahead of common stock and get paid in bankruptcy before common stock. Thats todays lesson .
Bye shorts ahahahaha

I will take some profit it it gets to $5, but holding majority until news of dividend price. My thought is the assets are worth more than initially thought and funds are desperate to buy back or gets preferred shares cheap."
dont sell it will pay off big time
Now what? Is there ever going to be a end to this madness? The more I buy the worst it gets.
"This is nice, first smile from this in months. Patience."

"I've bought 2,000 more for a total of 8,000 Why would anyone sell the preferred stock is beyond me but thanks"
"i have a question, i have a small amount of these shares, only 13 but i bought them before they were taken off the marktet. Now all my 13 shares at a cost of $0.00. Meaning its nothing but profit. Looking for good recommendation. Should i hold or sell?"
This sounds like an AMC thread. I
I bought MMAT at 5.46 yesterday and don’t understand what people talking about other stuff here 
Will we be able to buy more of these shares?
EVERYBODY HOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"volume is rising means more shorts are buying back your preferred stocks to avoid paying the dividend + the interestrate , do not sell unless it hits 20+$ .."
this is my new favorite ticker  when george/company finally give us some info this will fly fly. I bought 1500 more
"All preferred shares are linked to street name ? As long as you have $MMTLP, you will get the dividend ?"
This thing keeps rising- I’m so sad we can’t buy
"Here's what I don't like. You should not be able to buy pre-ferred shares. Something does not smell right. Plus they are throwing around crazy numbers, like OSTK stock going from 8 to 80. Or gas going up so land is worth billions. Or squeeze is on so don't sell until 100. CEO even put idea dividend could be worth $20 in everyones head. Looking at it with common sense, if the dividend was huge, wouldnt someone figure out how to keep it? Do you think a company is just going to give away billions? How are there millions of shares available to pick up, did millions of people sell theirs at 10 cents? Are they just creating more shares to dilute the payout? I watched 10 youtube stock specialists yesterday and they had no idea what this was."
The ROCK says… BUY BUY BUY!
"shorts needs to buy our series A stocks to avoid paying the dividend, this might squeeze to the moon .. just hold your shares folks"
Putting all ofMy paychecks in this company. About to soar to unbelievable heights.
"Just heard the truth on these so called preferred shares. The hedge funds need to cancel out millions of shares or they are responsible for the dividend. They fund everyone's account with $0.10 per share thinking it's a real dividend. After running it up a few bucks their goal was to make people sell and take 1800% profit. If sold your shares would be gone and their would no longer be a placeholder for the real dividend coming later. Shorts stop at nothing to ttick and deceive people. The company should come out and expose this activity and say we are seeing assets in the range of $12 min per share which would squeeze this to $100. The money in your account is NOT from assets rather it's a loan from shorts to trick you into selling you're preferred shares. Now that you've been warned, sell and be done or watch the shorts take this back down to $0.25 since their ploy was unearthed. Your choice. I'm waiting for the real thing. This is how underhanded they really are."
