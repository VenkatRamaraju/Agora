I am a buyer of USFD as it has been selling off since last week... US is almost fully vaccinated and life will go back to normal...

"I knew it was going to best estimates. while there are many small businesses 1permanently closing, the strong restaurants and small businesses are busy changing their business models and adapting to outdoor seating and takeout service.

"Expect a breakout over the next few days which will continue after earnings. Earnings will be better than expected. People are eating out, and getting lots of takeout. Coupled with the recent vaccine news, this is a winner."
"to the people that keep saying this stock was 40 or should be at 30, you need to understand that in order for that to happen the market would have to be back at the very top, stop being so delusional this stock will continue to drop and retest and even break the low, if you are a long term holder expect to be on it for minimum 2 years before it finds 30"
Personally feel that Chefs Warehouse & USfoods are great holds. Feeing great holding onto both shares.
