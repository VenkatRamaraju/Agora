"Headed for bk no doubt!! Employees fired and now insiders selling..,, facts written on the wall.,,"
Just to keep the company listed on Nasdaq is costing 200k/year. Delist to reduce costs and re-enter when viable pipeline is issued. While they keep their 50m to continue to survive. They will make a come back in 30 years and back to $5 range.
"$8k, down the drain"
$FBRX should buy back their shares..
They should have around 46m cash left by now and the stock should be at 3.30 if the company dissolves.
"Target price is now only 3.5, wth?"
"In for $8k @ $9, and that hurt. Got greedy. Looked at holders, 1 year price, and volume average...well never thought about timing. Wish you well ponzie. Good night."
They had some interesting insights about FBRX on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"God be with you and the campfire that you keep burning with your money ...If a biotech company only has ONE product in the pipeline, and they have a lot of bad luck on top of that and then they lose this product ... then EVERY price is too high to buy it !!If I don't get any consideration or value for my investment, then even 10 cents is too much ...Maybe (??) all those who throw tens of thousands of dollars into it here today should let their heads go.If your neighbor tells you that you can buy his old lawnmower, whose engine has burned out (!!) for $ 10,000, you would then also say: """" But of course I'll take it for the CHEAP price ... although I do now know exactly that I have to throw it away """"Nobody who thinks a little is going to buy this stock now. Not even if one speculates with the idea of a SPAC.Not everything that looks like a coat becomes one, or can even be used for it."
They have 50M cash in hand. They can start four Xbio type of companies. Which is ruling around 3$. That gives it 12 $ valuation.
It's green baby 
"no no need to hold anymore gameoverover warning warning a long long way down to go yesterday aftermarket trade hit alow of 3.70 beveryvery afraid it willhit that low at least in short term next 5 business trading days next week, then next 3 month it crashbelow 50 cent bevdrry veryafraid tolossalotlot more moneygetwhat you can now orget alotlotlessthen 3.70 soon then below50 centin 3 month"
Have 285 shares at 31.50 what shud I do
I will buy 20K below 3.8.
"FBRX has $50 M in cash minus legal cost as tons of lawsuit are coming, how much money will be left after the dust settle. Share price may drop to below $3."
There seems to be miss pricing?? $5 bucks from $30???
This stock is no longer shortable per shortsalestocks!
"love it covered at $5,06 on 1300 shares that I shorted and turned around and brought 10k shares at $4.87 for the bounce"
Looking at tute holders alot of big names had big positions here and were toasted. Amazing this ever got to the 50s. One product biotech companies are essentially a call option that could expire any day. Better to sell the stock and buy a call option to participate in upside. Hindsight is 20/20.
All shorters will run for cover today.
if you have money invested here cash out before it goes to zero
Dang i bought at $33
and now its going up. shorter soon start covering
10x bagger here
"All these biotech stocks seem to start off above 100 bucks per share, than go down to like 3 bucks per share, hover around there for like 5-10 years, than either go back up to 100+ per share, or bankrupt and vanish from the market"
"Anybody else want to share their thoughts on this company. I like companies with options and this company as of August 2021 has great options. The premiums for both calls and put are great. Thinking of doing a strangle at $15 Calls and and $55 Puts. Return is $7.1 or 89.87% in 3 weeks. Or else sell naked Calls at $55 and and Puts at $15. Also for some reason there is not much of a price or premium difference for the options 2, 3 and 5 months out. Any idea why? At time of writing current stock price is $28."
It was traded at 3.37 today.
10$ soon
Is this a joke?
It’s over!
"Personally I haven't invest in this stock yet. But if you are a believer, I suggest start small. Maybe 100 shares at $0.5 then for every $1 drop you add another 1 share. That way you don't lose a lot of money. No you heard me right, and it will drop to $-0.5 because this is going bankrupt"
Did someone post last week that there was a lot pf put buying before the news hit ?
Its the end. I think $2.50 fair value
On Tuesday in preopen it will jump to 12 $$$.
Who is buying and why?

sold it
Based on Yahoo numbers if float is only $10mm shares out 15mm shares and so is 16…% . Maybe this can have a second life as a meme stock with potential for short squeeze. Thoughts. Similar numbers to sprt
"I can at least deduct the lost when it goes to zero? Four kids, two marriages and never got to deduct any. Silver linings in collateral damage?"
"See you at 2.85 i will buy. Do notbuy right now, its going down more. GLTA"
Thoughts on the day?
"By the end of Sept, cash available will be about $27M or about 2.90/share. That said, better be safe than sorry..Cash is king on a Company that has nothing else going for. No drug,no pipeline,no nothing..."
$15 here we go
"Newbies see that $5.00 stock price and their eyes light up. Well, fact is this stock might be worth $4.60 with zero products to sell. Couple that with most likely lawsuits and she goes under $3.00. -----Never as easy as it looks!--"
rest in hell shorts
The human race never fails to amaze me. Why on earth are people buying shares in this company today. They just announced that they are not continuing trials with this drug and it's the only drug they have.
$50 mil in cash divided by 14.08 mil shares = $3.55 per share . Then add all the other assets . What is bottom line value /??????
I m in @ 5.45
It will surely bounce to 9 dollar to 12 dollar today itself.
I think back 15$ soon 
Almost all analyst had 80 to 100 $s target before friday. Though single product company they might have seen something in the company.
Short #$%$ are trying to control #$%$t's.

Oggi si sale bene
"this thing is oversold ,,,i see a positive 20%%rise today"
Ignore all the ambulance chasers.
I just bet everything I had at $28 a share. Any chance it will get back thr. ?
Keep shorting down to $0. Free money
"72% of float now short, the squeeze going to hurt."
the eagles landed!!
I would like to know if short interest has increase or decreased after today. Would alot of those that shorted buy back now to lock in gain or double down and sell at this price. I am thinking they would lock in the gains and buy back. I think that would explain who is buying these shares at this price. Currently 25 million in volume with only 14 million shares o/s.
"Wow, sorry for the longs here."
"looks like a lot of buying, green candles"
"Did the insiders sell out before making that dreaded announcement , I am sure they did"
Ah could drop more
Was just advertised as a value stock
$FBRX is doing a $BVXV; -80% AH. One drug pipeline. Wonder if $FBRX at least practiced some scientific inquiry here vs. zero hope shell of a worthless company.
"Brent is long FBRX trying like hell to pump it up with Josh, as a pumper tag team. Market will have no part of it, falling like a bag of rocks."
Anyone know why this isnt moving AT ALL?. Why is it so glued around 5.35
With CEO selling at 4.25 ish One Million Shares...certainly doesn't look promising..imhoI have no position in this
"As of 8/31, cash/share is somewhere at 2.30. Much of the balance was already consumed since 6/30.So, expect another pull down from here..."
once above 4.85 short covering will start.
Fair value 7
Is this like IDRA?
Ok I got in at $4.06. Little victory lap. This is no longer FBRX but a SPAC with 50 million in cash. Let's see what happens?
they have nothing in the pipeline.. only their skin trial which failed... they have 50m cash with a burn rate of 19m last month.. even with layoffs and shutdowns.. new legal fees and forced payouts to series A holders they have 3 maybe 4 months for a rescue line.. plus their grants will be removed since they failed their trials.. sorry this is heading to 2.50 in next two weeks or less.. get out while you can.. if you want to bet long.. buy the calls... or if you want to hold your shares.. sell the calls and at least lower your cost basis... but what ever you do do not say no one warned you this i a lost cause..
Today no chance of closing in RED. VERY SOON GREEN WOULD FOLLOW.
FBRX bouncing afterhours. I'm adding
"The fact is, that they will all be back at work tomorrow. They are scientists. They certainly have another step in mind. Be prepared to see this double quickly, and get back to where it was."
"Why am I here? That is not the question.Why are all you groupie minion longs here trying to pump this up since 4.50, causing unsuspecting victims to loose their hard earned money now, it is down to 3.40 ??? But I have been saying the opposite and I am being asked why I'm here ??? LMAO, unbelieveable."
Phase 2 clinical trials mean nothing! Money is when FDA approves the drug. You wanna hold this for 2 more years till it reaches that point? Makes no sense!
"80% down seems excessive. Regardless, something was definitely up with this considering the premiums were absurdly high for selling put options on a stock that was trending up. It’s like they knew it was gonna fail. Lawsuits coming."
Buy below $3.50 nothing there
Based on how this has been trading I just get the feeling this is about to drop to the 3.75 area. Just a feeling.
Any upcoming news pending. I see that the Sept option premiums are increasing not decreasing in the past few days.
"This is a good example of why not to invest in a company with only a single drug in their pipeline. Its better to invest in companies with a novel technology that can generate multiple drugs, like $DTIL gene editing technology. Big reveal Sep 9th..."

"Could anything good come out of this smelt down, The CEO was vice president of Lehman Brothers, any theories"
Bought in shorts should cover soon!
Buy buy buy!!! I just did!!
Any Ideas of what they are worth ?
"f FB-401 failed to the meet primary endpoint in atopic dermatitis. Consequently, Forte is discontinuing the development of FB-401. As FB-401 was the company's only asset, Nakae expects management to ""quickly take the necessary steps to reduce cash burn."" The analyst believes that options going forward include utilizing the remaining cash to acquire a new early stage asset to develop, or becoming a shell that another private company can reverse into.hat FB-401 failed to meet statistical significance for primary endpoint in an atopic dermatitis trial and will be discontinued. Raja sees ""little value left"" and expects the stock to trade close to cash, the analyst tells investorscash is under $3get out soon"
Trying to learn from all mistakes. So safest way to have played this stock would have been to sell Sept 15 puts and buy Feb 15 puts. Which I did. However my covered call got killed. I guess I did not do enough dd to think this could take 80% or more. Probably should have known given the 15 puts had a such big premium.

Easy money like I said
they will find a solution
Bought like 5k shares just now for the fun of it either spikes up like past history or crashes either ways worth the gamble
But why such a big fall ?
When the CFO and CEO sell over 1m shares this isn’t really a good sign is it?
"Here is your rally longs.... LOL, my target for you is 3.25, then back to script."
"Longs are funny to listen to here. They think all is good and everyone is due a big payday, just because that is what they are hoping for. Doesn't matter the company has no revenue or products, just because stock price has fallen alot, and the drop was unjust. Anybody that gives them a dose of reality they say to mute them. Meanwhile the stock just keeps falling."
I wonder where all the bashers who know it all were the day before this happened. LOL
could be a nice bounce play
On the move to 6-7 range!
Why was this manipulated between $30 and $44 for soooo many months?
I would like to know which institutionals sold yesterday......
"Insiders and funds knew yesterday, that's why 14M shares traded yesterday."
Asking againIs management and scientists here totally hopeless or there is something to be saved and done with current acquired (ok failed research but research there is and data was accumulated) knowledge and $ 50 M on hands ?
FBRX......... from pipeline to pipedream
"Insider leak:CEO and CFO shorted their own stock and covered by selling personal shares after the crash,look at their history!!!!"
"loaded 1000 share, I know it is a gamble but I have a feeling that it will bounce back"
"-81%... is that a glitch by yahoo? LOLOk boyz and girlz, I am newcomer, just for this -81%.... is there something left into this company, in order to buy ?"
Monday will be 12
who bought at 28?
Holy moly! Short squeeze?
"I have 1500, do you think I lose everything? but let's not joke!"
"QUESTION to the naive pushers: .....Why would it suddenly jump to $ 12 out of nowhere on Tuesday after dropping an incredible 82% yesterday like a rock! ??I have seldom seen such an absolutely brutal crash within one day.The market clearly says: You died for me, because you have nothing more to offer than what you lost today.Such a fall in price only occurs when a company is in fact on the verge of bankruptcy because it has lost its only product and has no more in the pipeline!So: WHY should everyone change their minds now who wanted to sell their shares on Friday, regardless of the price?Except for the usual gamblers who will play a little game together with the market makers, there is no more substance or value to get here.But I congratulate everyone who managed to leave the sinking ship on Thursday.On the other hand, of course, they bought just as many stocks ......And I'm really sorry for them. Even if I don't even begin to understand how some people here seem to have """" invested """" the value of a house out of sheer greed, naivety and absolute ignorance of the risks that biotech entails. Although of course that is not an investment for every normal person. Because apart from a few lucky sticks in the biotech companies, almost all of them have had their crashes.SAVA is an absolutely good example of this. It lost 55% of its value in 6 days, falling from $ 115 to just $ 50 on yesterday's closing price ...As you can see here at FBRX, the risk of a total loss is inevitable on every new day in science. Although, as I said, I really rarely saw a crash from 0 to minus 82% ...So maybe you shouldn't put $ 250,000 in stocks right away thinking you're better than the rest of the world and bigger than Wall Street ........One percent of the deposit lets you sleep much more peacefully, and it doesn't hurt if things go wrong.And since it will NOT increase by 1000% on Tuesday by 120% again, you should just keep your hands off the company.Even speculation that it might become a SPAC coat can be safely put aside."
Who are all these discord spammers?
"You keep referring to those 15 million shares of smart money buying in. LOLWell pal, there is no smarter money around here than the CFO himself whothought 4.24 was a bargain sale price and dumped 25K shares today. Go aheadlook it up for yourself if you don't believe me. So much for your smart money theories. LOL.https://www.secform4.com/filings/1419041/0000899243-21-035246.htm"
"Oversold. Took 5k postion at 5,34 and wait few months"
WILL EVENTUALLY SETTLE AROUND 1$ OR 2$
This is gonna rebound significantly today.. around 25%. Insider news.
Is there an earnings call today?
$1 next week. RS 20:1 soon
If the company will no longer be advancing its only drug candidate FB-401. What's left really? Who can answer?
"About 10 million float and $ 50 million in cash. plus assets and intellectual property, it's easily $ 10 stock. Just do the math."
"Biotechs are scary in general.If you're going to play them,you need to buy a dozen and trust that a couple of them will make good and cover your losses on the others."
Got in @3.97
sell all than buy back no value $5. See you at 3
Solid secondary results and 50 M cash. Is 80% down oversold?....
FBRX should be halted for trading until their conference call.
I just bought 10k shares easy money
Wow... just saw this. Sorry  for those who held this at $31. Is this a buy at this price 
"The good news here is most of the price movement has already happened. On a short term time line the downside is probably 3.00, but the upside is 4.50 which was established today. So tell me, would you buy an investment today at 4.14 that could possibly go to 4.50, but it could also go to 3.00? If that risk/reward incentive proposal you find attractive, then so be it. Go for it."
"Longs here have not only muted me, but they have muted the value of their stock, now they will mute themselves to try and forget about this disaster."
12 on Monday.
Only 1 drug was in the pipeline and now ZERO ??  Definitely going out of business
I averaged At 3.40 good luck to all.
Muting Bellamaxi. Clearly he's shorting this stock or just being a bully.
"I muted Bellamaxi and life is so much better. He has expiring put options. So he's trashing stocks. With low float, this stock could easily rocket up. Its up to us"
just bought a small amount under $5.37
This company has not abandon its FB 401 but will study on its disappointed result before advancing further. I very much think that is the reason management giving 4 to 5 months time to update on further plan.
ATOS is the winning horse. On sale.
"Had they said ""We intend to review and analyze the data before making our next move""the stock would still be above $10, but they killed their only product straightaway Reminds me a bit of ODT, that one never really recovered"
just to make it clear that no insider had sold any share as some claim. Actually it is the opposite. I have been digging and found The last insiders trades were 4 and we all buy of 100000 and was dated on may 28thhttps://www.insidertracking.com/node/7?menu_tickersearch=FBRX+%7C%7C+Forte+Biosciences

"Typically when drug fails, stock falls maximum 4 times so this is much more than that. Will close around $7.50"
Barchart has strong sell on FBRXhttps://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/FBRX/overview
"It's a company with no product and no pipeline, with 50m usd in cash, with legal suits to fight and settle and operating in a field (pharma) where product development takes a lot of time and a lot of money, even for the early stages. Most likely scenario is they try to settle whatever legal issue they have and give back whatever il left to creditors, and they will move on. Optimistic scenario, they convince some angel type of investor to put money in to finance research into another medical application of the one product candidate they have (FB-401). But extremely unlikely."
"This company now has nothing as the company will not advance its only drug candidate - FB-401. The book value of the company is $3.55, so the current price of $5.06 is still too high compared to the book value."
yo just came across this stock. Buy time baby.
"No insider buying, even at this fire sale price. Alot of fingers being lost trying to catch this falling knife."
This will be $SAVA soon.
YES!!!!!!
Big short squeeze is going to happen. The company has good amount of cash and i beleive this company will soon be taken over by big giant company.
closes green
$50M cash and super low float of 11M shares. Lot's of merging eyes looking at this one.
No reason for a bounce as the company has no other drugs in the pipeline. Cash will be burnt quickly and new investors will take heavy losses. No positives here at all.
Buying monday over sold hahaDweebs
$7.77 by noon
Not a single analyst has given sell. Almost all have given hold. Company has not discontinued but will study its result. Good scope of again back on trial happening. Hold on. Honest company wants to study more on current result.
Some people will cry today
HEAVY VOLUME SELLING IS ALMOST FINESHED. NOW TIME TO START UP MOVE.
Blessings.
I sold at $5.60 the first day of the drop for a nice % gain. Not even considering buying back into this mess....They will probly pull some sort of reverse merger(they have in the past) and give themselves bonuses Take the three bucks and run

"Stock down 84%, from $28.59 to $4.67 because Phase 2 clinical trial of FB-401 for the treatment of atopic dermatitis failed to meet statistical significance for the primary endpoint with at least a 50% improvement in atopic dermatitis disease severity. Was this publication in Science Translational Medicine fake then? They had published: In the pediatric cohort, 20 AD patients with mild, moderate and severe disease, ranging in age from 3 to 16 years of age, were treated topically with FB-401 for 16 weeks (twice weekly for 12 weeks and every other day for the final 4 weeks). 90% (18/20) of the pediatric patients reported at least a 50% improvement in the Eczema Activity and Severity Index (EASI-50) with 100% (9/9) of the moderate-to-severe patients achieving EASI-50. The mean improvement in the EASI score was 77% with improvements observed on all actively treated body sites. Pruritus (itch) also improved by an average 58%. The mechanism of action for FB-401 involves pathways that drive tissue repair and anti-inflammation.Took me for a ride for sure! Not sure who or what to believe anymore!"

Open under $1Tomorrow!! IMO
Its the end
Should I come or wait longer? I feel like coming now…

"I remember a stock plummeting like last year because of some law firm in New York. That stock went from $265 s share to below $100. After five days, it was back up. I regretted not buying. I was scared to get in. Scare money don't make money!"
Is losing investor’s capital this company’s “Forte”?
I like the price movement here. All ABOARD!
Please help me welcome the $4’s and all the new bag holders
The interesting fact is that not a single share is sold by management or insiders. They themselves confidence in the company. Keep holding. Big big interesting things will come out soon.
Nice volume
Seems to be way way way overdone.
Look at insider sales NONE
Some huge buys going through at 5.
data drop september 7
all of my life savings are gone how will recover from this please go up
Only one drug in the pipeline and it fails. With 50m cash on hand it will be worth 0 by the end of 2022.
What the h#ll gapoend here? Is there any bad report or something?

"Some knew this vicious break was coming . Open Interest in Sep 17 puts was 43,000 . That is why premium was so high . Not rocket science . Are there any good reasons why Forte will go back up ?"
buy in next few weeks it will easily be back up 50%
"Very interesting that we are not able to buy it at $5.00. Seems like there's too many buyers wanting it at this level. Stop listening to the bashers, and think about the fact that FBRX will develop again, and again. But now, make 10x"

This company is nothing now. They have no drug or potential
"The company has long research. Failure does not mean exit, but rather a halt to rise"

The CFO started selling his shares today. I think we drop to $3 and then pump a bit as shorts start to cover. With CFO selling I dont think shorts are that pressued to cover in the $4's.. If anyone has any other info please share.
"Oh oh, better cut my losses and just move on."
Oh my word. This has become the Bellamaxi board. You've spent all day posting on it. What do you do as a job again? I'm tempted to buy more. I'm getting a price below cash on balance sheet in a market where the capital raising is all of a sudden scarce... Unless you are a European airline. But that is another story.You're not tempted Bellamaxi. This company seems to have got under your skin. Are you in denial and you secretly are waiting to buy the dip?
The more I read about this Dr. Wagner that ran this company he was more interested in running financial assets than research. Beginning to believe this whole thing was a scam with zero chance of success. Go to this company's web page and read about Dr.Wagner!---

I recently watched as a company I had invested in for years received a CRL to spite the fact they were asked last year to expand the label to adolescents and were in negotiations in March for final label determination. The drug was already approved for another indication. The CRL stated the drug was safe and effective at reducing phosphates but after directing the company through 11 years of trials the FDA questioned weather or not the primary endpoint had any clinical significance…. A ridiculous determination that was rebuked by experts in the field. Given this and the fact that 50,000 die in the US annually from hyperphosphatemia you would have thought the approval was certain."
Just bought a bunch. Hit my price target. This stock used to be $40+ this year.
"I’m really wondering how FBRX has these kind of options, makes me want to find more stocks with options like this. But these prices seem really crazy and I’m not getting much from reading past posts except everyone seems to be gambling and waiting for Sept. 7th"
"In @ 4.38 out @ 5.60still seems cheap but had to lock in that % gain I could see this trading up to $8 or down to $3major issue is that if you write off the only drug in the pipeline, not much is leftthey may very well dissolve ...... probly $2 per when all is said and done"
"By Monday evening, Management will definitely come with further clarification."
"Wait til end of Q3, tutes will want this off the roster come end of day tomorrow."
Do you think it was the CEO who brought down the price because he knew the disappointing results in advance?
"They can go into the covid business, multiple drug combos available for testing...."
"OMG. Here to go another bio-tech paper company. Going to follow $FBRX, $ADVM, $ARDX. Stay away or short. Don't catch falling knife."
"Guys before putting any more money into this stock please read about Dr. Wagner’s background. He seems to be more interested in corporate finance than medical. I think you all got dupped. Somebody bought a lot of puts, I mean a lottttttt of puts forcing IV to 550-600, right before the news release."
"Meh I'm waiting for $2, already set in 100 shares at $2. Yeah even then it can still be dropping so it would be like a lotto"
"Recover your loss: *****buy IMPL****1- approved drug for acute migraine2- launch drug in october3- price rallied to 34$, now is at 13$ because after approval they issued shares 2 weeks ago at 15$... yes, 15$ and price is under 15$ now4- expect 500 Mil$ sales (peak)5- big holders: 80% sharesnumber 3# speaks of a MUST HAVE"

Boy am I lucky to hang on to buy in the day it dropped 82%. Whooo! So sorry for the people who are hurt. I had my bad times too that made me relax for awhile. Hopefully there could be a miracle to happen for the longs. God bless.
I will wait next week
Bull trap
Headed to $3-4 next week. This is not support level yet.
"Remember my words, its price will jump to $15"

"my heart goes out to all longs who are in pain, and unfortunate patients jin need for better meds."
10 dolla
Good news coming after market load up fast
"Picked up 10,000 shares on Friday. at about $5 or so. It’s going to bounce somehow IMO. Still has 50 million in the coffers and did have an at or about $80 price target at one time I recollect. They will come up with another study or initiative and more news should come. Who knows, perhaps something could arise from the secondary findings of the first study? Could be $10 or more by next week. Not financial advice And my opinion only. Definitely do not think this is a dead cat."
Times are rough I just saw a panhandler on a smoke break thought about giving him my stock since he already has nothing this would fit right into his portfolio
Down 83% oh myf kgod
I thought buying at 5.50 was good.I should of waited
OUCH !!!!
"$FBRX is a perfect example of what happens to a bio stock with only one drug in their pipeline. With all the scrutiny going on around simufilam and them taking 22 years for just 2 trials which is extremely unordinary, this thing will drop like a rock once phase 3 trials fail and will be delisted once the fraud is proven."
Load! Load! Load! Only 1m shares available to the public. 17% short. Man this is going to rocket.
