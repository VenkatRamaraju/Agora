"Bellamaxi's new job, as he is no longer getting paid to bash FBRX."
we can get to $10
What happen here? Is this bottom any hope for this company?
Oh my word. This has become the Bellamaxi board. You've spent all day posting on it. What do you do as a job again? I'm tempted to buy more. I'm getting a price below cash on balance sheet in a market where the capital raising is all of a sudden scarce... Unless you are a European airline. But that is another story.You're not tempted Bellamaxi. This company seems to have got under your skin. Are you in denial and you secretly are waiting to buy the dip?
10 dolla
Going to $0.0001
Thoughts on the day?
Boy am I lucky to hang on to buy in the day it dropped 82%. Whooo! So sorry for the people who are hurt. I had my bad times too that made me relax for awhile. Hopefully there could be a miracle to happen for the longs. God bless.
Good news coming after market load up fast
$50M cash and super low float of 11M shares. Lot's of merging eyes looking at this one.
Going to zero
I averaged At 3.40 good luck to all.
This is going 2.5 and keep going down until they post any positive announcement
What is the procedure of delisting? And what happens to stock owned by its holders?
"I muted Bellamaxi and life is so much better. He has expiring put options. So he's trashing stocks. With low float, this stock could easily rocket up. Its up to us"
$50 mil in cash divided by 14.08 mil shares = $3.55 per share . Then add all the other assets . What is bottom line value /??????
"Longs here have not only muted me, but they have muted the value of their stock, now they will mute themselves to try and forget about this disaster."
"Here is your rally longs.... LOL, my target for you is 3.25, then back to script."
"There is a HURT WHALE, if this HF dump everything it could go below $1, he is slowly dumping hoping anyone buys alone the way to minimize loss. Yeah he is eventually going to dump it all. GfG"
What's holding this down? Isn't cash value around $3.20?
