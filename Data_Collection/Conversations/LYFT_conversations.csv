Obviously LYFT's stock is being protected by the banks and other institutions that own shares and making it almost impossible to short with high charges. Appears they realize if LYFT was to turn into an immediate bust it would hurt confidence in the upcoming UBER IPO. Any thoughts?
"CRSR Beats earnings, dips... this misses expectations and rally upwards, what is wrong with the market?"
Why down down down everyday ?Any commentsThanks
People needs to realize couple things: LYFT and Uber are making money off the drivers. I did some research and Uber/LYFT are taking over 55% of Earnings from drivers. Let’s assume rider pay $100. Uber/LYFT are taking $55 and driver will take home $45. How can this sustain?
back to 40 she goes
A failed LYFT off.

Lyft is down 5.74% to 58.10
IPO should have been 12 to 16... TOPS
Bought some $35 puts on Friday.

"Stocks down big today are $lmnd, $etsy, $uber, $fsly, $gm, $roku, $lyft, $sklz. I own none of these. Feel better lcid is not down that much. Lcid will bleed slowly."
"Maneesh, and others. These rideshare/delivery companies have had more than 10 years to ""figure out"" efficiencies. What taxi company has huge headquarter buildings in San Francisco, and pays their CEOs 10s of million per year compensation? These companies are frauds. Never be profitable. They will tell that story until every last penny of investor money and ipo proceeds is gone. Hoping for growth and profits? Do you have a deadline? Better get one."
I will buy it at $15. See you there
$26 next
Where can I buy stocks without having a broker ? It’s my first time I’m learning as much as I can about the charts and what’s what . Idk it’s my birthday today figured I’d spend the day learning this . If you have a few minutes please email me at Cyndi.villafna@yahoo thank you and happy st Patrick’s Day y’all
"Still can't understand why $GM is down so much today. I get that $Uber, $Lyft and others aren't profitable and it's unclear if their business model works. But GM is a great and very profitable company. Well positioned in the markets of the future (EVs, self-driving cars). No reason why it should remain that low."
People who paid $86.00 with market buy last Friday
will be up tomorrow
Shorting this on open tomorrow!
I hope shares keep going down since they are supporting abortion and Planned Parenthood.
record accrued liabilities.... how is it possible that Lyft owes $1+ billion to suppliers/vendors?
Does anyone else feel that CNBC and Blomberg is building this up so the banks can get out and make their money and leave us all hanging?
Thank Republicans for taking away any chance of a profit for doing any business in Texas...
Lyft business plan.............
Please tell this insider seller that you can not just MAKE UP a new definition for profit ADJUSTED EBITDA is a joke. The only one making money is the CEO dumping this stock. YOU LOST MONEY AGAIN !!! Stop lying and saying you are profitable !!
Honestly I am pretty concerned that we didnt make new all time lows today
I bought and this started gong down! So far 20% down!

"When you price your IPO at $72 and it drops to below $48 in less than six weeks, something is massively wrong."
Should I buy now or wait until $15? Thanks in advance.
"People are buying $ALYI like a Mutual Fund. The company has its hands in Zoomcar, IQST, EV Motorcycles, Cryptocurrency etc.. 400k share chunks being bought right now. Soon $1.00+ and that's before June when they Launch their first EV Taxies in Africa, 2000 of the first pre-order. Specifically designed to work with Ride share companies like $UBER and $LYFT."
"Who still thinks Lyft had a good quarter?""For Lyft, money spent on incentives grew an eye-popping 92% quarter over quarter, while revenue rose just 26%. An incredible $375 million was used to attract drivers, which is quite substantial given sales were only $765 million. ""They spent half of their revenue on driver incentives."
Maybe Uber IPO will be postponed after all.
"It is weird that LYFT just reported a great quarter. the only thing ts bad that is lack of driver. Why it goes down just like this down , down and down ?I don’t understand this down trend. Lyft Inc (NASDAQ: LYFT) also topped top and bottom Wall Street estimates, but more importantly, it reported its first quarterly adjusted EBITDA profit amounting to $23.8 million, a quarter earlier than expected. Both ride-hailing companies made the increasingly popular decision demanding employees who want to return to the office to be vaccinated. Although they are strongly encouraging drivers to get the shot, they are not mandating vaccines for delivery drivers as they are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to keep them classified as independent contractors."
A profit?! Who woulda thunk it
been uber and lyft driver no justification for huge run in the share especially lyft that don't have the same exposure like uber and just try to get to the delivery business business so down .the airport practically are non existent ride share drop so much and the share more then double from the bottom? well today at the price of 34.80 I start short it .and even it might go higher tomorrow I will continue to short it .no correlation between the share price and the reality

"Lyft chooses Satanism over Christianity. ""Satanic Temple says Texas abortion law violates the religious freedom of its members"" Bible is clear if you DO EVIL or Support Evil you will go to hell despite any good things you do or did. Matthew 7:21-23 NIV“Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. [22] Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?' [23] Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'Stop doing evil!Repent and be clean, many will not enter the kingdom of heaven.Matthew 7:13-14 NIV“Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. [14] But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it."
"To me, Lyft stock, like many other stocks, is not trading on fundamentals. It’s remarkable how well the company is performing despite the current horrible environment. The demand for its services is growing rapidly. When offices open again, the demand will go off the charts. Also, if gas prices drop a little, it will be another catalyst to attract more drivers, and lower pay."
Newly IPO - DIDI is China's LYFT/UBER if you don't know!
"The only reason to own it, is if you believe in the buyout ?Lyft is growing market share at a loss, which only increases their losses because they don’t want to find out what happens when they raise Fares to become profitable ?They will sell it, making Billions without having proved that the market will bear the higher fares ?Knowing what their plan is, I still am not sure that this won’t get cut in half in price ?"
Y'all remember that one time Jim Cramer said to buy this at $89?
$20 coming soon
When Lyft is offering 50% off rides that probably isn’t a good sign.....
I'll wait until its $15
I just woke up from coma. What happened to Lyft? The last time I saw it was when I was awake and this company was listed on IPO
uber and lyft is best stocks to short...
"The very weird prop 22 which Uber an Lyft paid 210 million for is now heading to become legal toast. It was odd to think of any gig workers voting for it. Like chickens voting for Colonel Sanders. Then, the companies just ignored what was promised inside and did whatever they wanted, and still lost money. Pathetic. And kind of funny."
"Why LYFT is down, down and down ?Any commentsThanks"
Drivers can always go get another job. How long is this going to go on .. Go get another job you don't like it
$10.00 is a fair price
My first and probably will be my best short. 2500 @ $87.
Today is your big chance to buy shares in a taxi company that loses $1 billion a year
I'll never buy another IPO
Can I still buy in at 87 ?What an opportunity !
All the taxi companies laughing. Karma
rumor says they're gonna change the symbol to DROPT

"it is wonderful that we allow these overvalued companies to make up a new type of income that fits their accounting games so that companies losing money look like they make some sort of made up profit, when in reality the only profits they produce is for insiders selling their stock like hotcakes."
This stock is redefining volatility.
Lyft's rideshare service is crashing because of high rates and low pay. lyft's diversity program is causing discrimination lawsuits for exclusion. lyft's scooter department is selling off equipment because they can't afford to maintain it.
"Pretty soon these drivers that are pushing to be considered ""employees"" will not have even have a job if Uber and Lyft decides to leave California."
"I can understand that $LYFT is down 9%. They are barely profitable, can't find drivers, have a regulatory risk, Covid might come back... But $GM?? Completely overblown."
Im just here for the comments
This pleases me greatly to see the market actually reacting how it should to something that is severely overvalued. Hopefully it goes down to the 20s.

This is scary. Sell or hold?

Uber IPO at $44. This is gonna tank to about $30.
Can anyone explain to me why this is going up knowing well the negativity the California decision is going be after Friday?
"Don't worry, they'll turn profitable when they have a fleet of self driving cars to pay for... LOL"
LYFT is going back to the 20s

"Okay, so someone tell me why they needed funds via an IPO. It's not like they need a fleet of cars, or service stations or...???"
start now
Lost all of my money investing in Lyft. Should I start driving for Lyft to recover my loss?
So a loss of 23 million Y/Y 280 million loss is raging success LOL
"10% drop on excellent earnings, such manipulation. This market is out of control."
I wish I had the link but rumors are that Uber is planning to go public anywhere between $44-$50/share

This doesn’t work with Autonomous Driving plus Lyft & Uber now would have to Purchase the Cars and Maintenance beyond belief ?What about the Lawsuits?Who can testify in court that you weren’t injured ?Drivers have nothing to worry about !

Don’t know if I’d want to be holding Lyft at $72 a share seems a little scary to me

They were transporting the body's for the hospital's.

I have found a way to make a small fortune on IPOs!!!Start with a larger fortune
Below $69 in a few days at this rate.
Congrats to the shorts!!! A new 52 week low on Lyft stock today
so the concept behind lyft is they have lost 90-95% of their business now in the 5 th week but they'll be able to borrow their way out this to inflate their stock price again.....hmmmm
Sadly for bagholders lyft has run it's course on being anything other than a money losing business. It's a head scratcher trying to justify this current valuation with the amount of debt and cash burn. It was a nice run. Taking peeps to get their death pokes really didn't move the needle but nice hype regardless. Try Robin hood 2 to 3 years run before it get exposed
Way to overpriced
Friends don’t let friends buy LYFT
What a MESS! Fraudulent account charging my credit card and NO HUMAN CUSTOMER SUPPORT!! DELETED LYFT after one month and 4 fraudulent charges. Had to cancel my CC....another $20. Have a nice life i.e. highly unlikely i'll ever do business with this company again
If Lyft wanted to be profitable they should have just sold tickets to the train wreck of an IPOI would have paid.
"Well, the IPO was based upon the promise - by John Zimmer - that Lyft would get into self-driving cars. D'oh! Whoops they sold off the self-driving division, must have forgot!https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/lyft-sells-self-driving-unit-to-toyotas-woven-planet-for-550m/"

Tired of waiting for Uber and Lyft…when r they gonna start making money? Tired of excuses and regulations. Zzz
"Bought 5k Shares LYFT at 21, Should i Hold on ?"

wait for 3 months and buy in thr 20's
Closing at $64 today.

Their employees are suing for discrimination and gross negligence, their scooter department is selling off their equipment, their drivers and passengers are heading to uber and their diversity program is directing recruiters to hire according to their diversity report, leaving legal grenades by the wayside. good pick y'all"
"Flawed business model=failure long term!. The only reason Lyft and uber exist is they undercut taxi services by 50% and pay drivers minimum wage with no employee benefits. In order to be profitable, they would need to increase prices about 50-100% and they will lose 75% of customers who currently use these services to save money on buying a car or take the bus."
"LYFT was already struggling, then you know what happened.... go woke, go broke. It's over for these guys. It's not smart to alienate 50% of your customers with a pro abortion stance. Should of stayed out of it. These riders can just as easily jump to UBER. What is their benefit to use LYFT over UBER?"

"Yes!! This is a great loss! Because we created ADJUSTED EBITDA !!! Under their accounting methods, I qualify as a multi billionaire despite losing money every day !!!!"
"I believe that the reason Lyft and Uber are desperately trying to bring back drivers is not to meet demand, but rather to bring down the fares. The rides are so expensive that riders are simply not using them. The companies can only cope with this by having too many drivers. It has always been the case that if Lyft and Uber were to charge enough to cover the cost of the product, many fewer people would choose to use it. They will never make a profit."
LYFT options start trading tomorrow!!
Lyft will find strong support at around 10 bucks a share.
1.8b loss and its surging... Todays market is wild. lyft should be about $3.00 a share.
Why isn't it clear to everyone that the ridership revenue model is unsustainable.

There is no avenue for Lyft/Uber to ever become profitable.
When Lyft tries to sue Morgan for shorting their stocks it means they are not confident about their future.
