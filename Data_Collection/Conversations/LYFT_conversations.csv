They had some interesting insights about LYFT on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.

"From Barron's:Uber's average pricing is now 10% below Lyft's, according to his analysis. That's a flip from May, when Uber's rides were 1% more expensive.That means price war. Uber beats up Lyft in rides, and both lose more money. Doordash beats up Uber in delivery, and both lose more money. Net result: endless losses."
WTRH Let’s see shorts lose 500% or more. See them buy their borrowed shares at a $7 to $10 range…. $GRUB $DASH $WTRH $UBER $LYFTMORGAN STANLEY owns almost 13 million shares of WAITR. M&A buy what acquirer do you foresee???

Most people remain poor only because friends and relatives discouraged and advise them against investing and trading BTC while the wise ones kept investing and growing higher financially
"I love this stock. It's volatile so you can pick up some good trades, yet the fundamentals point to a rising price. Just picked up some more at $50 and thought it was a steal. yes it dropped a bit but I'm patient and soon will be back in the money. This has been my best earner for the year."
Analysts are reporting UBER ride is offering lower cost compared to LYFT … this may indicate rider shortage for UBER has been alleviated…

Heavy volume. Markets up 1.3%. What is going on here? Any insights?
"On pullbacks, I am buying aapl, amd, msft, etc. I would warn not to buy Lyft or Uber, two profit-free dumpster fires fueled with your cash, whatever is left from the ipos in 2019 and borrowing."
"According to Lyft employees, Lyft's hazardous work environment is chock full of safety hazards, health code violations, sexual misconduct and discrimination. Employees have faced retaliation for voiceing their concerns."
International travel ban will be lifted world wide in NOV so LYFT UBER BA RCL NCLH will do well from here.
$GRPN $LYFT $SNAP would be a great partnership together
i'd buy it at like 30 maybe
$45.28 I’m picking up 10000 shares just got a feeling

"If oil prices reach over $100, Uber and Lyft are finished. Don't expect the governors of Texas or Florida to release their national guard to alleviate the truck driver crisis. The military is also struggling to find recruits. The labor shortages will continue to get worse and Uber is playing games with their drivers, NONE of them are loyal after their bait and switch in California."
"Lyft could face billions in fines if the mislead drivers regarding their compensation, says the FTC. Would Lyft do that?"
