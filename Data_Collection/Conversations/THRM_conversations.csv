"Sometimes if life, you realize that impatience causes you to lose out on bigger money. For those that sold $THRM this week while it's been consolidating in the .50 zone, you messed up. This thing is gonna rocket to a $1+ no problem. And when it breaks through the 52 week high of $1.05, there's no stopping it. Hang on to your jockstraps friends"

"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"

I suspect we'll be seeing some #bullish strength in $THRM | #AcuVid as we inch into the week and we get closer to getting listed on a US exchange which only makes sense since we are going after FDA approval.#BottomFishingHengel en vis #CovidTesting #CovidTest #COVID19 #DeltaVariant
$THRM again is where it's at today
(http://Rightpicker.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!

Could someone who cares about Empower answer this question? I see $THRM (Therma Bright) doing COVID-19 Rapid Saliva-Based Antigen Test just like Empower and they are listed in TSX-V and Empower is only in Canadian Sector? I can buy $THRM from Wealthsimple but not Empower? Banks charge 9.99 if you want to buy $CBDT and that increases the Stock price. Isn't this one reason why $CBDT is down? Sparta $SAY is also a player in the same field. Both $THRM and $SAY are under 50 cts a share. DD shows $CBDT is a better company but does it really worth investing? No bashers please. Just trying to understand.
Do you all remember this post from Country Gal ?CountryGal_015 days ago$THRM.V conversationI bought a few thousand shares for Therma on Friday and now I'm second guessing my decision. Can anyone weigh in on whether I should sell or keep?From asking for advice to now dominating the board with his nonsense and giving you advice. Wow-what a transition in two weeks' time?We all know it's Steve.

Some smart Gentherm execs/investors also have investments in Ideal Power. Do your homework on IPWR...it's got multi-billion dollar potential.
