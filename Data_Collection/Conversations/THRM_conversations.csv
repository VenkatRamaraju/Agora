"Sometimes if life, you realize that impatience causes you to lose out on bigger money. For those that sold $THRM this week while it's been consolidating in the .50 zone, you messed up. This thing is gonna rocket to a $1+ no problem. And when it breaks through the 52 week high of $1.05, there's no stopping it. Hang on to your jockstraps friends"

Do you all remember this post from Country Gal ?CountryGal_015 days ago$THRM.V conversationI bought a few thousand shares for Therma on Friday and now I'm second guessing my decision. Can anyone weigh in on whether I should sell or keep?From asking for advice to now dominating the board with his nonsense and giving you advice. Wow-what a transition in two weeks' time?We all know it's Steve.

Could someone who cares about Empower answer this question? I see $THRM (Therma Bright) doing COVID-19 Rapid Saliva-Based Antigen Test just like Empower and they are listed in TSX-V and Empower is only in Canadian Sector? I can buy $THRM from Wealthsimple but not Empower? Banks charge 9.99 if you want to buy $CBDT and that increases the Stock price. Isn't this one reason why $CBDT is down? Sparta $SAY is also a player in the same field. Both $THRM and $SAY are under 50 cts a share. DD shows $CBDT is a better company but does it really worth investing? No bashers please. Just trying to understand.
THRM is up 6.23% to 31.20
