"Super high value stock. Loses $1 b a year in a highly capital intensive business, which is difficult to scale in a niche product with a signifcant amount of competition. Def poised for success as the economy tumbles."
"I reviewed Wayfair's first quarter earnings. Although their sales increased, so did their losses. The more they sell, the more they lose. Look for yourself."
$1 billion buys only about the shares traded today itself. Share buyback announcement is a classic Niraj Shah sleazzzzy tactic to manipulate his stock. I bet you will see insider sales dump from Niraj Shah in the next week or so. You will know it is ripe for shorting again. He always hits 52Week high with his Share sales.
"How many folk will want to sit on furniture in a busy store when stores reopen? Attitudes towards online shopping will be affected long term. Wayfair's long substantial investments in presenting detailed product information,setting competitive prices, and providing excellent customer service and home delivery will pay off in the long term."
Hands up! Riding down steep tomorrow! This company is toasted!
BBBY implodes -28 % .
Nothing goes straight up from $120 to $171 and stays...learn something if you are in stock market...See you at $153 and if that does not hold then $120 back....tick tock...
"W is an example of why I don't short stocks...lol. There's no reason for this stock to be as high as it is, but that doesn't mean people agree with me...lol."
Wayfair Inc. has made it to S&P Global Market Intelligence’s list of “Most Vulnerable Public American Retailers”
"Call it what you will, this stock is in a bubble. But it's a short dominated bubble wherein every uptick in price shakes a short off the tree to buy which further drives the price upwards. Algos are good at this. It will end one day when everyone notices the king has no clothes."
"BBBY , KSS , NIKE, imploded. W will has its day . Lol"
Big time short covering today....1.5 million shares traded in the first hour alone. @Dean-good hunch on the squeeze premarket this morning...didn’t expect that since Friday’s SS was pretty big..but you just can’t easily predict with a tiny float and huge short interest. I think margin calls kicked in once it hit 180 and it just accelerated for shorts to cover. Glad I sold my 177 puts late yesterday to lock in gains (because you never know with W) Got back in at 185 for 185 puts early today and didn’t expect it to hit 190. It’s traded flat since the first 1-2 hours and the slower trades shows there’s no real interest but short covering today along with FOMOs thinking this must be Cramer’s go to stay at home stock. Volume still ends much lower than average today and W is still destined to go down soon. It will be interesting to see what happens tomorrow.
Whats happening today is a complete flight to safety. Retail investors are joining institutions and piling money into money losing heavy debt companies that have absolute terrible fundamentals.Makes sense.
"Relax everyone. It's just a short squeeze. Wayfair was primarily a pandemic play, and the pandemic is basically over. Growth is clearly slowing going forward. If you're interested in investing in Wayfair, you may be able to buy it when it returns to the $230's in the coming weeks."
How will 25% increase in furniture Tariff affect Wayfair?
"My short basis is $141 for this evolving position (made a killing shorting this last year in November on earnings)This rise is typical of W manipulation due the small float. Seen it before. While though, I agree it is real, because the money is real. I've been catching up on Wayfair news coming into earnings. Saw a couple of interesting points I'll put out.-Some big insider sales recently (April)-1Q revenue for Wayfair is typically flat to down, rarely up.I'm not closing my short no matter what happens- as this is a $20/share company in a recession, and I have the time to wait. If it pops above $180, I will wait for a leveling off and then short much more.Not many retail traders here, as W is basically an institutional fund game. Currently, the funds are playing the ""growth game"". When the economy gets jittery, they will play the ""liquidation game""--like they did in Oct, Nov, and Dec.Good luck if you are long, I don't need luck being short, just patience."
Having keen insight to the furniture industry I will BE shorting this stock- reasons below.1- poor quality furniture ( big items / not referring to rugs lamps etc) 2- 15% + return rate and damaged deliveries resulting in discount to keep as-is . Not sustainable in this industry for profit.3- on bigger furniture items they sell cheaper/ low priced items making freight costs a higher % of cost of goods. ( costs to ship a $1000 bedroom is the same for a $3000 one )4- there plan is & as always been to buy market share with crazy advertising expenditures & believe that once lock in - They can go on autopilot with new continual purchases.5- plan is not achieve able because...A- customers are only loyal to good service & price . B- they will continue to chase the top line vs bottom line # creating further stress on cash.C - since February of 2020 the home related purchases have been “unprecedentedly at record highs” Any furniture operation with half a brain is going great with the exception of slow delivery of orders from factories.Once the orders start to soften & it’s just starting. That’s when opportunity on W short will be timely.
"Can someone explain to me why this stock is worth $123 per share when the company doesn't seem to actually be making any net income? I'm on the newer side of stock investing and from a fundamental standpoint, this appears to be a stock driven solely by speculation and emotion... is there something I'm missing? Thanks!"
it seems that the money has slowed down on the buyback. They had to be out by now doing even 45k shr/day. Volume has been well under 2.4 million recently.
"JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers lowered the firm's price target on Wayfair to $200 from $237 and keeps an Underweight rating on the shares ahead of the company's Q3 results. The analyst expects COVID-19 ""to last longer resulting in a hangover into 2022."" He sees see ""moderating trends ahead"" for Wayfair. Horvers thinks Q2 represented ""peak profitability"" for the company, with near term risk on freight/shipping costs and declining profitability in 2021."

We are not far away from big drop! Hoping to see it soon
"SummaryWayfair has suddenly shifted their strategy to focus on profitability after many years of growth at all costs.2019 continued to show huge cash burn and slowing growth, the opposite of what bulls want to see.Valuation is much lower now but insiders are selling and the company's fundamentals have deteriorated substantially.Cash will likely run out soon and we recommend investors avoid the stock at all costs.."
"be careful shorts, they might switch accounting practices again, provide no guidance while having declining revenue. the street seems to like that for their fed reserve buddies."
"Wayfair adopted a new accounting standards update for debt effective January 1, 2021.

"buy OSTK Wayfair, what are you waiting for, great strategic purchase"
At this rate they will announce a dividend lol still in a cash position
"Update on valuation...As I've shown, W is likely to enter residential market (just my opinion)...They will use Musk-designed solar powered drones to deliver small homes fully furnished with their products. Homes also will include full suite of IoT (internet of tihngs)….Given global residential real estate value at about $180 trillion, a mere 5% market share for W could garner an approximate valuation of around $10 trillion..Likely some hurdles along the way but doable within a couple of years"
Is it a crazy thought that W in the morning could open down $20???
"about time, would not be surprised if this is on life support by next summer."

UBS price target of $125 and neutral. How did they arrive at that?
Thank God I finally SOLD!!!! I bought 420 shares at 102 weeks ago and then watched it go to 23 dollars !!! Finally sold at 105 today !! UGHHH
"In my opinion, soon W will announce they issued shares to raise capital behind the scenes. Most likely at a price well below $200 which will dilute the current value. This company has a huge amount of debt and had NEVER made a profit in over a decade. It’s current run is nothing more than free Fed money (not really free btw, we will all pay severely for this with huge inflation in coming years) and hype."
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Stocks-tracker.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
"Forget the tariff news; that’s just the trigger that might send the market down, but not what will ultimately make it spiral. There’s a corporate debt crisis — $9t today, compared to just $4t in 08— that is looming in plain sight, only few people choose to see it. You have companies with hugely inflated valuations, and whose valuations are what they are because of all-time highs in stock buybacks (thus racking up more debt, just at a lower interest rate). The yield curve is inverted, one of the best signs of a recession — the bond market signals a recession before the stock market does — yet people keep buying.I parked my money in cash back in October of last year. Yes, I’ve missed the nice run at the start of the year, and will probably miss another towards the end of the year or early next year. But there are signs EVERYWHERE that this bull market, while probably not at its end, is going to see one soon, and it’s likely to be a big dive when it does.I’m short W and many others right now. These companies, specially in recessions and corrections, will do what the old saying says: “Take the stairs up, and the elevator down.” It will be a hard, fast fall. Good luck to the longs. I play that game as well, and know the patience needed for it, and wish no one any ill-will who is long in this stock. As a pointer, beware a fall and hold below $140. There’s not a ton of support below that, recession or not."
here are some facts: Doubtful accounts first 6 months increased to $60m. that's a direct loss to profits.Cash increased by $1B (same level as 3q2019 so who cares. it's after a massive debt undertaking). Accounts payable up $400m this quarter for all those new sales.Notes payable/ST debt payable increased by $300m in the quarter.Long term debt up $400m in quarterLiabilities exceed assets by $788m in Q2.Buy back $700m stock with cash from issued debt. that's totally normal for a healthy company right? ( Sarcasm)Negative Shareholder Equity of $800m. equal to 4q2019. Positive cash was $879m after issuing $528m in NEW debt. Made $200m cash from investments which is a one time event. lost $450m from investments 4q2019 (volatile).25% of shares are short waiting for this facade to crumble
"Financial strength AnalysisW is one of the most highly leveraged companies in the Internet & Direct Marketing Retail industry and has a Debt to Total Capital ratio of 284.42%. Additionally, the percentage of debt used in its capital structure grew this year. The company could face trouble servicing its debt as both its Interest Coverage and Quick ratios show that neither operating profits nor current assets alone are great enough to satisfy interest obligations."

"Still trading at 55x this year's projected earning, I still think there is much more to crash in this very low profit margin business. Once the pandemic is over and life is almost back to normal, this will tank even further. Any opposing views ???"
"I started shorting this last summer around $115. It kept rising and I kept shorting more. It did not make any sense. Yes, the small float and high institutional%, hence manipulation- but I knew it had to fall. My highest (and biggest) short was at $142. Then I believe it was nov, they announced earnings premarket. I covered at $92 and made a killing. I watched the action after i was out. Same action-- steady rise for no reason--pure manipulation. So now I have been shorting this new rise (many short trades below $130 and a big one in $160s) I am stuck. But I have the money to hold the short and add more to it. Wayfair will fall again. And when it does, it will fall quickly -- again. Any game has its end. And the only winner in the Wayfair trading is a short.--W has no chance in a recession when consumers cut their spending--recessions kill growth model stocks--high institutional held stocks are fun to watch in early recession trading--the funds try to kill eachother trying to get out before all of the othersI am primarily a currency trader, so I have to review global eceonomic activity. Global economic activity is slowing quickly. The US is in the best shape, but we ARE heading towards a recession. When the US/China trade deal breaks, I believe the markets will ""sell the news"" as equities have already risen 20% in the last 2 months. I will cover my current W position below $50 this time. My guess is the time frame for that will be early 2020."
Can someone explain to me way a furniture company is trading at 300 a share ? What am I missing and the price target just got raised Charles Schwab gave this thing A B rating and a buy ... educate me please
"If this is not a bubble, what is?"
Wayfair should close shop in Boston and relocate to a city where people go to work and leave their BS political opinions at home. Really smart people in Boston would rather let children sleep on the floor?
how could this go up??they had lost -0.91EPS vs Consensus -0.89 EPS VS last year -0.48.Anyone?
40 shares short at 285.50. Lets make profit matter again!
"My question is the huge elephant in the room.... disagreements with the Auditors and risk of a restatement. The issue appears to be failure to take reserves (writedowns in inventory value) from the huge returns..... they are not even close to the standard metrics for writedowns on historical cost for damages and obsolescence compared to others in the industry who deal with consumer-facing deliveries. The W return rate appears to be about 2.5X industry average for heavy furniture. At just 3% damage and obsolescence, the margin effectively deteriorates to the point where now material in the eyes of auditors. The margin deterioration by an effective 2% means an additional 10% revenue growth just to break even. Already reflected in the stock price or am I over thinking this?"

"Before the pandemic, Wayfair had never turned a profit for 17 years of operation, since the founding of the company in 2002. In 2019, Wayfair had about $9 billion of revenue, but lost about ($1 billion), or lost ($8)/ share. With the pandemic, the very optimistic projection is for Wayfair to make $2.4/ share next year, instead of losing ($8)/ share in 2019 pre pandemic. Assuming Wayfair can achieve the extremely optimistic projection going forward and maintain $2.4/ share earning year after year, it would take about 100 years to return current share price of $236. Why would people choose to pay $24 billion, and projected forward P/E of 100 for a hugely money losing company with 17-year track record of massive loss, with the hope of turning profitable going forward ???"
"With billions of converitble note, and stock options, Wayfair real market cap is almost $38B already.Don't get mislead by current EPS. First earning is sure not sustainable.Second PE is still very high even if they keep making same profit. PE would work out almost 35-40 still.Third bad reviews clearly show they working hard to avoid returns and that is way they boosting profit.Forth Overall market for entire furniture is only $114B and Online market already reach 40%+ rate."

Lowest it’s been in six months…gonna bounce…no volume…be back around $300 by Tuesday

Is this really worth $25 billion and at 55 P/E based on this year's projected earning ??? Why this very low profit margin online home furnishing is being valued as a high profit margin technology company? What is going to happen when the pandemic is over sooner or later???
This looks like more than just pre-earnings jitters. Someone knows something and is betting big.
"every time this drops the doomsdayers come out. Every pop, benjo and hornet appear. Look, this company will still do well Q4 with 100k new cases a day and people did adopt more online shopping. But, the Wayfair revenue, earnings, $ per customer are going back to earth as seen last quarter report, and long term trend is not promising for company. It has no way to pay for shipping when the volume normalizes. Huge debt. It has no alternate business like AWS to even offset the shipping losses. It can only push Chinese suppliers to lower prices. Bottom line this will return to stagnant company with low growth and flat to negative earnings."

"The funny part of W's ""buybacks"" is that they somehow still end up with 20% more fully diluted shares each year (cuz they're handing out stock comp by the yard). It's not really a buyback, it's a management enrichment scheme. The total share count is exploding despite the shares retrieved."
"Example of a Stock Bubble: eToysThe internet bubble around the turn of the 21st century was an especially dramatic one. Numerous internet-related companies made their public debut in spectacular fashion in the late1990s before disappearing into oblivion by 2002. The story of eToys illustrates how the stages of a stock bubble typically play out.A Rosy StartIn May 1999, with the internet revolution in full swing, eToys had a very successful initial public offering, where shares at $20 each escalated to $78 on their first trading day. The company was less than three years old at that point and had grown sales to $30 million for the year ended March 31, 1999, from $0.7 million in the preceding year. Investors were very enthusiastic about the stock's prospects, with the general thinking being that most toy buyers would buy toys online rather than at retail stores such as Toys ""R"" Us. This was the displacement phase of the bubble.As the 8.3 million shares soared in its first day of trading on the Nasdaq, giving it a market value of $6.5 billion, investors were eager to buy the stock. While eToys had posted a net loss of $28.6 million on revenues of $30 million in its most recent fiscal year, investors were expecting the financial situation of the firm to take a turn for the best. By the time markets closed on May 20, eToys sported a price/sales valuation that was largely exceeding that of rival Toys ""R"" Us, which had a stronger balance sheet. This marked the boom and euphoria stages of the bubble.Shortly afterward, eToys fell 9% on concern that potential sales by company insiders could drag down the stock price, following the expiry of lockup agreements that placed restrictions on insider sales. Trading volume was exceptionally heavy that day, at nine times the three-month daily average. The day's drop marked a 40% decline in the stock, from its record high of $86, identifying this as the profit-taking phase of the bubble.Decline and FallBy March 2000, the panic stage had arrrived: eToys had tumbled 81% from its October peak to about $16 on concerns about its spending. The company was spending an extraordinary $2.27 on advertising costs for every dollar of revenue generated. Although the investors were saying that this was the new economy, such a business model simply is not sustainable.In July 2000, eToys reported its fiscal first-quarter loss widened to $59.5 million from $20.8 million a year earlier, even as sales tripled over this period to $24.9 million. It added 219,000 new customers during the quarter, but the company was not able to show bottom-line profits. By this time, with the ongoing correction in technology shares, the stock was trading around $5.Towards the end of the year, with losses continuing to mount, eToys would not meet its fiscal third-quarter sales forecast and had just four months of cash left. The stock, which had already been caught up in the panic selling of internet-related stocks since March and was trading around at slightly over $1, fell 73% to 28 cents by February 2001. Since the company failed to retain a stable stock price of at least $1, it was delisted from the Nasdaq.A month after it had reduced its workforce by 70%, eToys fired its remaining 300 workers and was forced to declare bankruptcy. By this time, eToys had lost $493 million over the previous three years and had $274 million in outstanding debt.TL:DR THIS IS A BUBBLE. DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU."
Squeeze tight get all them one and two contacts out
It was down because of commentary out of OSTK that total number of orders declined over prior comparison.
"Help, can someone explain why as revenues increase, expenses increase, losses increase. Is shipping cost the issue. Is the build out of e-commerce the issue?Also where is the cash coming from, as the losses increase so is the cash position?"
"Today's chart looks like it's on its way to a shooting star candlestick, and the hourly trend looks very similar to 11/27. If the stock follows the same pattern, the next few days may be very bearish. The fundamentals of this company are not very good, IMO. also, on the last few major downturns, the stock bounced off the 50 dma (7/17, 9/17, and 10/25) We didn't quite get there this time (yet), but we got close. I feel another strong downturn is imminent. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon."
does anyone know the convertible conversion price that is due at the end of Q3. A lot of price manipulation can be due to that too.
"Here is a great tip. Go to wayfair. Save the image of the furniture you want.. Go to Google reverse image search.. Boooom.. Now you can buy the same thing on another site for 50 % off what Wayfair is charging. They sell overpriced , less than great quality furniture. You can find anything on their site for way less elsewhere."
Spruce house partnership is represented on board for way. They purchased 1.25 million shares between 2/21-3/9. They sold 1 million shares on 3/19 at wait for it....................$23.32 What do they know? Surely they did not just need cash and if they did why sell way. They are big holders of many companies. This pig is toast but bullfight said insiders are buying lol. Not they are dumping. Three other board members sold shares as soon as they were awarded to them

"How did this company and stock price develop an immunity to reality? How are retail investors buying at these hyper-inflated levels? Or is it exclusively insider trading at this point? Why are you not buying something with strong earnings, a healthy dividend, or future sales guidance.. my goodness! I gave up shorting this when it was in the high 100s. I feel like there is something sinister going on here but I know the SEC won't do anything about it."
"Guys...Quick, but accurate valuation here. 130 million households in U.S. alone. Conservatively they will spend $1,000 per year on Wayfair's amazing products (and customer experience)….That's $130 billion in sales in U.S. alone!...x 3 and this is easily $400 billion company and $4,000 / share! Might take some time, but easily doable in like 18 months.."
"Is W eligible for S&P 500 index inclusion now? I'm not predicting this will happen now, just wondering if they qualify. Following is text from S&P on their requirements:To be eligible for S&P 500 index inclusion, a company should be a U.S. company, have a market capitalization of at least USD 9.8 billion, be highly liquid, have a public float of at least 10% of its shares outstanding, and its most recent quarter’s earnings and the sum of its trailing four consecutive quarters’ earnings must be positive."

I took a chance not selling 170 puts expiring tomorrow !! but I made a huge mistake by selling the 180 puts yesterday. Holding my June monthly puts
Curious to hear some thoughts here. Thinking of open puts $150 strike for Friday. Is that crazy? Any big down day on the major indices and I think this falls back all the way $140-150.. No idea how this got such a heavy bump on zero earnings..
Runnnnnn it to 250!!!!!!!!
just wondering why wayfair pulled the items so quickly if there was no truth to it.... makes them look guilty even if it's a wild conspiracy theory
buying a call 2 weeks out because Niraj Shah gang will try to take it to 250 once or twice by then
"Question: I saw Wayfair issued 1 billion worth of convertible bonds at 148.50 in August 2019 when the stock was at 112 ...

"Multiple Target Price cuts, a few downgrades, and the price still gets propped up? Negative stockholder equity, negative earnings every quarter, $1.4bln in long term debt, SG&A of over 30% of sales, tons of poor customer reviews, sensitive to Chinese tariffs and supply chain...."
"Wayfair has had logistic problems in the past; but now far greater! The customer service phone lines must be ringing off the hook."" we are sorry, but all of our service representatives are busy with other callers"". Take the time to verify, by calling in yourself.W has a long series of share trading declines ahead....especially after the NEXT Quarter report."
November 2 will be below 250
Unemployment is horrible.Those that work at home already bought whatever they need last 12 months.W will be crush by their debt load … 18 months ago pre pandemic the Analysts had a sell rating with a Bk possibility.
"When insiders purchase shares, it indicates their confidence in the company's prospects or that they view the stock as a bargain. Either way, this signals an opportunity to go long on the stock. Insider purchases should not be taken as the only indicator for making an investment or trading decision. At best, it can lend conviction to a buying decision.Below is a look at a few recent notable insider purchases. For more, check out Benzinga's insider transactions platform.WayfairThe Trade: Wayfair Inc. (NYSE: W) Chief Operating Officer Thomas Netzer acquired a total of 8125 shares August 4, 2021What’s Happening: Wayfair is expected to release financial results for its second quarter on August 5, 2021. The company’s shares have gained over 5% since the start of the year."
"So what was the share price on the stock dilution? They'll stair stepper it down. Market cap. is deceiving because it's based on last transaction x shares. As you see when people want out and few buyers, company valuation takes a hit. It's a website."
Too many better companies to buy at bargain prices. Who wants to take a chance on a company that can not show a profit? This will get worse. I bought more puts earlier. Still have not made much even though it is down $4 more than when I bought because of the volatility. It will come.
Could close today at 234 but if it closes at 221 look out. That would bring in Sub 200 play
I am looking to take a position in this. Watching closely !!
"All you need to do is look at the ""Components of Our Results of Operations"" on the 10-K. Regardless of revenues growing, COGS, Cust Service/Merchant Fees, and Ops, G&A, etc are all going to stay at the same relative level as a % of sales. The only potential area for savings would be a lower % of advertising costs relative to sales. Advertising costs for 2018 were $774M, compared to a pre-tax loss of $502M. Maybe the dynamics or one of the underlying assumptions change at some point, but I don't even see where the company is planning (even on a LT basis) for becoming profitable."
"Expect below 200 post earnings. This is so far following AMZN. The big difference is that Wayfair will report negative growth for at least the next two quarters, but Amazn’s growth was positive"

how do they approve a 1 billion dollar share buyback when they don't even make half of thatin a year.
Run this stock up to 250 please! Buy buy buy lol
Here I hope your not talking about me. I have made enough in two months to buy three cars. I sold short so many times. At one point they tried to force me to buy back at a loss! Went up to 328 and I kept my short positions. Most don’t have enough not to get matron called. I am not one of those. As a matter of fact I took 86K out of E-Trade today
Lesson learned. When the market is inflated the manipulators 'sell-off' BEFORE earnings which panics who sell. The manipulators quickly buy-up KNOWING that positive news is coming out.
This is the easiest earnings play you’ll ever get. Calls all the way up to 300 will print big
Yahoo chat poor ppl bashing it…1100 hedge funds own this…trust me on where this will go
"When valuations settle back to rationale levels (Ebitda multiples rather than sales multiples), a lot of nasdaq stocks will drop another 30% to 50%. I think Wayfair produced pretty solid numbers but being objective I do think it is probably 40% to 50% overvalued. Over time it could justify its current value, but with supply chain issues, rising commodity and transportation prices, likely peak home improvement, increasing competition and a possible recession coming, etc all point to a correction in the stock price."
"When you see this kind of erratic trading, sometimes it's the mm stop hunting to move shares. Not a bullish sign."
I have never seen a stock with a negative book value have a triple digit valuation. I ran a business. Only Amazon and Tesla are or were allowed to operate at such a loss. Amazon was first mover so they got a pass. Tesla same thing. Don't understand this price. Apparently the insiders don't either. Look out below.
"yall, know this company is growing at 100% YoY...with 10 billion in revenue.... while also cancelling their largest sales promo of the year...that kind of growth at this size is unheard of.on top of that, they cleaned house at the leadership level to focus on profit. last quarter they stated at this point going forward all sales are margin accretive...this means the Net Operating Loss will shrink.i.e. Growth is through the roof and we are seeing positive direction for cash flow and operating income."
It’s a gift for the longs to sell into strength .I added to my short position here .
$W featured as one of the top shorted stockshttps://lussosnews.com/these-two-stock-have-a-high-short-interest-will-they-squeeze/
"As I wrote months ago (when W was at $145./share)... I was in the furniture business for over 20 years; with their biz model, Wayfair will never be profitable... the stock is going to $50.00."
"Wayfair has benefited tremendously from the pandemic and the sudden spike of demand. I still think going forward is challenging for Wayfair, mainly due the bad business economics. Wayfair is not Amazon, online retail by itself is barely profitable, unlike Amazon, Wayfair does not have much more profitable divisions, such as AWS, logistics services, advertising platform, and Prime membership to boost profit. Even if Wayfair could achieve $2.45/ share of earning this year as projected, it is trading at 110x forward P/E ratio. Why would anyone pay 110x P/E for a company that sell heavy and bulky items online with very bad business economics and thin profit margin even during best of times? I still think Wayfair has 80% to drop further, to $50/ share. Anyone has a much different or much more optimistic opinion?"
niraj shah gang back on the scene to rescue W stock
A fraudulent stock can make one a lot of $$$$ 1 billion buy back ha ha ha! I want to thank W for all the cars
"They shot their wad, come on over to the HUGE sale at OSTK, we could use a small catalysts before we take off back to $100. Not much downside left for OSTK versus upside potential, but do your own DD, just saying. Your call. GLTA"
"What has caused 28% plunge in the last few weeks, anyone?"
"They’ve never once made money, their losses continue to get worse and worse even though their revenue goes up....someone please tell me how this stock is $200 instead of $20!"
"Sales up 36% for a 5 day period. That means losses will be up 72% for that same 5 day period. It costs Wayfair A LOT to ship large and heavy items for free. All those BF week incentives also cost Wayfair a LOT of money.That said, I do expect the stock to trade modestly up on this ""news"". Analysts will pump the shyte out of it since it has been trading flat for too long. Expecting the inevitable upgrades any moment now."
it's over valued and the stock price will continue to decline.

Don’t be “that guy” that tries to dollar cost average this on its way down to $100.

I generally do not believe in conspiracy theories but there are many red flags here
Benjo I think wayfair is going to buy out Amazon lol
"So W Q1 2020 revenue is down significantly from Q4 2019 and down from the last 3 quarters. That is not growth. It is a shrinking of revenue, despite 28% growth in ""users"".This is NOT sustainable. The growth trend is horrible. Is any analyst looking at that? Growth is the only story Wayfair management have."
"I see Wayfair invented the cure for Coronavirus. That's great. Last time I ordered something from them, I literally got a broken shelving unit with half the parts in the box. I think pharmaceuticals was a good pivot.Right? That's what happened, right? Otherwise, they're still losing a dollar on every sale and making it up on volume."
There are No products to sell from China.Debt load will crush this stock .
I order a crib i loved it my friends orderd cribs they all loved it w is the future
"Beat every metric revenue, eps and margin to 30% vs 28% expected. They projected strong growth in Europe."
Way fair will beat q4 earning coz they got 31m dollar tax credit means each share 0.50c
They kept it high so the big boys can get out .Tomorrow it will get crush.
"this is incredible. W issued a convert, which will dilute shareholders and the stock is ripping. Also, nasdaq is down as reopening trade is apparent with airlines, cruise etc. up, which shows people are rotating out of winners during the shutdown, which should put pressure on W. bizarre."
Last chance to get out .
You guys can all thank me for the this. evertime I buy a stock it will go down. I could show you. close to 40 % on Wayfair. oh and when I sold FB and Apple they doubled. anyone need help on making a fortune. I'll buy opposite of you. you win
"Closed up on a downgrade day, strange even for W. Hopefully going below $200 soon."
A re-post from earlier that is really worth reading and its all based on fact. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4346747-wayfair-negative-equity-losses-cash-burn-high-leverage-headwinds-and-bankruptcy-possible-in
"A large percentage of Wayfair's sales and profits are of course from furniture and appliances, which are tightly tied to household moves. House sales have plummeted during the pandemic, and will only worsen during the next six months, as there is a long lag between getting one's house ready to sell and actual closing on a sale."
more proof of manipulation-Chipotle. company is a buffet fast food restaurant during a viral pandemic. Stock has gone up $400 in past month.be careful shorting W. price can go anyway the manipulators desire. they own all the shares and trade it up between themselves. it is collusion to manipulate prices. If the market was a true market there would be no shorting and no options. huge con game against retail investors
Have a feeling these earnings on Wednesday will fall short
"Massive debt increasing year over year? CheckExtremely thin margins? CheckReliance on China for production? CheckLabour force that cannot do their jobs from home? CheckPoor build quality, poor customer feedback, as per BBB? CheckNot considered an essential service? CheckRose 600% from 1 year low in 1 month? Check Risk of bankruptcy? Check"
"i wonder what even matters fundamentally at these levels? let's say sales are up 120% and they earn $2+ in EPS in Q2, how do you justify the current valuation at $230?"
"Insane valuation with no relationship to the reality of their business, which generates revenue but no profit. They have no cash, need additional funding from my perspective yet the stock has been climbing higher even on a big down day in the market like today. Remember this was a $27 dollar stock a few months ago. I expect it to revisit that price, the question is when?"
"Put aside the conspiracy theory for a minute.They haven't turned a profit for 19 years. Yet the analysts consensus is that they'll have a huge q2 profit, in the middle of an unprecedented economic crisis?Someone please explain to me how!"

This is sell ! Stay away !
"Wayfair ( W ) extended its recent gains, rising almost 7% in late Monday trading, after Wedbush earlier raised its price target for the online retailer by 20% to $120 a share. The brokerage also kept its neutral rating for Wayfair ( W ) stock, explaining the company Friday warned its Q1 net loss will nearly double Q4 levels despite an expected 34% to 37% year-over-year increase in revenue during the current quarter."

Wayfair disappointed almost each time and the stock tumbled. i hold my puts for mid may! at these prices, wayfair would need to be profitable to justify this run up"
The pumpers are still pumping this. What happened to all the retail believers?
Wayfair to issue $1.2 Billion in convertible notes. shares dropping in after market. Very smartmanagement since its a great way to take advantage of extremely overpriced shares.
"GUYS, I was in the retail furniture business for 30 years; I had 40 employees at one point. I'm telling you, W is worth VERY little; they will NEVER make money. WAY too many people damage the furniture, trying to assemble it, and then returning the furniture. Eventually the stock will be $50. or less."
I heard Niraz is buying analysts a Hot Dog if they recommend W
"I knew it, when I saw how W was up earlier that it was being pumped, there is alot of short interest , so glad I didnt jump in"
Ahem ahem. Where are the W haters?
"This stock is the greatest mouse trap I have ever seen and it took me for over 50k and it will take all of you long or short! Cover your shorts and sell your longs! There is very little float in this stock meaning shares available for daily trading it is largely held by institutions plus it has a large short % of around 25-30%. Additionally, the institutions are pumping this thing using zacks seeking Alpha and motley fool. Oppenheimer gave a a price target of 200 and that got hit the same day. Someone already mentioned the market cap on this company is close to Best Buy!!! Finally, they are going to have one anomalous profitable quarter in Q2 of this year and then they will never be profitable again. Please keep in mind they have been in business since 2002 they are not a new company. In fact they could go bankrupt in the next few years. Please watch carefully the CNBC video about this company from today it was in fact very good and balanced. This coupled with the fact that it is traded out of NYSE using a specialist that can sop up any liquidity to play games with all week as they see the full order book. They will run this higher on no volume like they are doing and then all it will take is just one or two of the large institutional holders combined with the NYSE Market maker to sell this and it will be at 120-140 in two days! You have been warned I am never touching this thing again it beat me good!"
"She’s been sleeping, awake the balrog"
Aren't the global shipping problems going to kill this stock's quarterly results?
Restructuring is the initiative to reduce cost and realign business needs for faster growth. The company reducing redundant cost headcount and in turn increasing more headcounts in areas that will produce higher revenues. This way over blown and will get a uptick and return quickly.
Looks like about 7 million shares crossed the tape today in 8 large blocks. Look at the chart. These must be prearranged as they aren't showing up on the running daily volume.Big boys are out at $195. Watch it plummet from here.
Overpriced hype just like Tesla that let everyone down on the big battery day that was all hype and now stock tanks
"Ah, W doing well as expected! Retail frenzy isn’t limited to in-store, folks. One would need a lot of real estate to show customers all of W’s selection in-store. Backing this pure play for the long term."
THIS STOCK IS IN THE TOP 10 MOST OVER PRICED STOCKS TRADING TODAY. THEY DON'T MAKE ANY MONEY. $50 IS OVER PRICED.

"Follow the short float...this is tilray last year. It's obviously nothing more than a squeeze. So tempting to short this but it may have juice to $200 still. once the tide turns on this...it's a 60-70 dollar stock. As usual, the fall will end up being just as dramatic as the rise."
my portfolio is 45% TESLA 45% WAYFAIR and 10% MUNI BONDS. i think this is a good balanced low risk portfolio with high growth potential what do you think
"Amazing how this stock now acts like a defensive staples company. They sell highly discretionary goods. Don't be fooled, they saw a benefit during the quarantine, when people were still feeling good about their economic situation and finally had time to take care of those household projects that have been on their to do list. That surge will die down as the employment picture stays bad for a long period of time, in line with what the Fed just said. W will be back below $100 by year end."
"They will force as many short term shorts out before the price goes down. It has been this way since 2016! If you can’t afford to lose $5,000 in one day you should not short the stock!"
"Will the shorts learn that this is a profitable business with good gross margins? Will they recognize that the company has growing return customer orders while they have dramatically reduced advertising spending? Will they recognize that revenue comparisons to 12 months ago tell a misleading story, W was running against no discernable B&M competition. What we have now is closer to normal competition and I expect W will grow quarter to quarter going forward while continuing to deliver positive cash flow and earnings."
"So far I've been right. 1) padded / fake Q1 results; 2) fake guidance and TBD capital raise. Usual suspects upgrading the stock to get fees from the convert (CS, et al). After the raise and pump, this becomes one of the best shorts of the last 20 years."
"if I'm using a global consumer interface platform like Amazon or Wayfair that sells millions of products between third parties, it is highly feasible to move cash in packaged products i.e cabinets at a high fixed cost. The third party could also hold accounts for customers moving money as well. All accounts could be identified and accessed by users for the specific product name and the sku etc. any investigations would look at these companies to see if they have had any purchases/transactions on these ""accurately priced items"". The concerning part to me is the defending statement that 20k plus pillow covers are reasonable and acceptable by Wayfair. From the Amazon standpoint, I don't understand with AI and preventative measures in place for price gauging on items, how it's acceptable to have comparable items be 10000% higher than the average price. It's a big lack of oversight and allows for these platforms to aid in laundering or trafficking."
"130 pull back big time, this is so over bought, buy puts or short this is a Give Me"
Why is this down? Looks like a good deal right now
i bet jeffrey epstein got all his furniture delivered from wayfair.
At this rate the entire public float will trade today.

"April pending home sales drop 4%. 3 months in a row of declines. Prices too high, direct impact to W"
Overstock down over 40% from recent all time Aug High - that would make W worth $195! Very over valued right now
"It is rare you get a short opportunity as good as this! Looking at the chart, the 50MA has been supported the whole way up on this run, but has broken since yesterday, hence I am pretty sure we have started on our downtrend. I imagine the majority of shorts were squeezed out with the recent highs - does anyone have data on open shorts?PS. If there are any holders left, I advise to sell ASAP!"
"I believe yesterday's temporary spike up is totally related to the setting of the conversion priceof the convert. the conversion was based on the weighted average share price of yesterday's trading.The company bought put insurance as part of the offering. As soon as stock started dropping at theopen, the insurance kicked in to uphold the stock."
"wow, almost time to short again. We know even more information now that sales dropped another quarter. Yet the price creeping back to Q2 on a covid scare without any stimulus. Only saving grace is that the eviction moratorium extended"
"I bought a nice kitchen table from Wayfair coming from a third party warehouse in Alabama. First I was told it would take 2-3 weeks. Then I was advised that the table was out of stock and it would take 2-3 months. Then the table finally arrived at their Chicago warehouse, at which point I was notified that the table was damaged and that it would take another 2-3 weeks for a table from Alabama to arrive. This table was delivered by a 3rd party freight company to my house a few days ago and it is damaged in 2 places. So now Wayfair has to pick up this table and replace again at a 20% discount, plus they already gave me a free smaller table to get me through Thanksgiving. I just don't see how furniture sales are going to succeed over the internet unless through the likes of Amazon that has their own shipping and can somewhat control how harshly the package is handled. I am guessing based on my experience that Wayfair's losses will continue."
sam must be out buying the dips again today. Analysts liked their story of keeping overhead down by all online. Now they want brick and mortars before ever showing a profit. This this will tank to 90 in three months.
"For anyone who thinks Wayfair is replacing brick and mortar furnture stores here is some more data proving otherwise, they still lag Ikea (during a pandemic)https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F02x44_z,%2Fm%2F03tb1,%2Fm%2F02kpnw"
No buy before 60 !
"I think it’s about time analysts were taken to court for making unreasonable predictions, if a company can be sued for doing so, so should analysts. They have the power to manipulate the market any way they choose, with no accountability or ramifications for their published statements!"
"premarket fake out. With guidance to drop rev lower again next quarter, what is the incentive to hold. $175- $200 fair value. Growth story is over now it's just barely holding onto accounting profit"
"My prediction for today- MMs Squeeze it upwards in the first hour to stop out some shorts and move price higher for the whales. Then whales start offloading again to the market and we see continued selling throughout the day until close, slowly pushing the price lower, to end the day negative."
This is brewing for a big down turn. They don’t have any fire power left to manipulate it. Big drop coming soon .
"Not sure how this one keeps going up, BUT it has looked like the best short opportunity on the market after it got past $185.....am going to accumulate a short position at these levels, big time hyped stock, way way way overvalued, expect some downgrades and ship jumping this week"
People have moved on from this momentum trade. Selling to late arriving retail.

Wayfair repeated its buy rating, noting that the impact of the coronavirus pandemic would force furniture shoppers online and potentially boost the e-commerce specialist's business.Yet after the stock's jump, Stifel came back and cut its rating on the stock from buy to hold. That might seem like a quick response, but given that the stock's $18 upward move took the price above $122 per share -- well above the $115 per share price target -- the downgrade based on valuation seemed justified.It's not every day that you see one analyst give two different views on a stock. Yet the calls were consistent with the way the stock behaved, and it shows that at least in some people's eyes, valuations still matter."
"LOL, p/e jumped to 80 with their declining sales and earnings. Next quarter even worse. This means to just get back to 55 p/e need to dump another $40 off the price. There is no incentive to hold for the next 2 years since it's over valued to begin with"

"Cash out while you can on this one. When the vaccine is 100% validated and a delivery date hits the market, this stock goes to $75 at best. No brick and mortar stores. Remember that!!! There is a massive pent up demand for people to go out and shop and NOT sit in front of their computer and buy furniture."
