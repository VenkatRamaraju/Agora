I was going to buy a small block yesterday but changed my mind...Figures
they destroyed lowered earnings....this should be up $5 tomorrow with the 737max coming back
MASSIVE BEAT !!! COngrats
Why are there so few posts on this board?
Just took a medium sized position. Have researched and could only find positive information. The possible sale of the company is a bonus. What am I missing?
Waiting to buy at $40
WWD is up 5.16% to 128.25
don't buy or sell anything for a Zacks ranking. i bought 5 of these all in the RED. I swear I think this company in business to generate income for Brokers
does anyone feel WWD is ready for a stock split?
WWD is up 7.46% to 79.50
expect 20% upward move
Tempted to take profit but will hang in there for an acquisition. This company is too good to last much longer.
im optimistic for earnings today. should pop to 60s at least
Does anyone know the offering price from Boing?
sold out of this sometime back but can't help notice recent run-up.....been down this road before...git ready for 10-15% drop......that's why I got out.......this company just can't sustain upward move....it will be back at $80/sh in after earnings
does anyone think there is stock split in the near future?
whats going on here ? it was a rock solid stock for 3 years and in 1 month its back to a 5 year low...
boeing buying KLXI.....WWD might be next
smart move to use overvalued stock to make an acquisition.
nice cup and handle
