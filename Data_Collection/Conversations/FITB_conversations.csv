"At current price especially after drop of past 3 days,I would be a buyer of this stock.Dividend is good & management has indicated a 24 cents dividend in next 2 quarters .Still time to get the 22 cents for this quarter!Can anybody explain the huge volume today?"
Great quarter results. Why is it not up?
A buyout would seem to be the best solution. They have made good equity investments but can't seem to perform in the regular business of banking.
This happens a lot with this company. They beat estimates and the stock goes down????
Fifth Third Bancorp is down 15.37% to 14.92
Why the beat down?

"Assuming no growth in cap, the buy back of 100 m shares gives a current equivalent price of $32.30."
I would hope an employee in the know would approach the SEC with the way you have been handled with 5/3rd 401k stock purchases (pulled from you) the past year. Allowing you to purchase stock with interest rates on the way down and terminating the program with rates and share price on the way up to settle shareholder suits. The decline today due to the merger 2 days after receiving your letters.

I expect fifth third bank will report a very good quarter. And I believe the next quarter will be even better.￼
Give KEY a look over since it's yielding above 4% and should post good numbers.

"Southern Michigan Bank (SOMC) is a $700 million bank located in Michigan, with 15 locations. The bank has been around since 1871, observes explains Doug Hughes, editor of Bank Newsletter. They have almost, no bad loans, strong management and a book value of $30.00 a share. Banks like this usually get almost 2 times book in a takeout. They also pay a solid 2.5% cash dividend, and should earn well over $3.00 a share in 2018, so the PE is also very low. In my opinion, this is about as safe a bank stock as you can nd in today’s stock market. I see almost no downside risk and 55% upside, which makes it a top holding. No other group than the small banks still has so many names that are still so cheap. I expect that there will be a wave of small bank mergers in 2018, with many bank stocks having moved up over 50% or more and many not moving at all, this creates miss- pricing so deals will happen fast. SOMC ts this merger pro le with strong earnings, almost no bad loans, and a stock that hasn’t moved up like the larger ones in the group. Fifth Third (ITB) would make a great t for them; I would view that as a win-win for shareholders on both sides of the deal. Oppenheimer Holdings (OPY) is an investment rm focused on nancial advisory services and asset management. The company remains under the radar, and I believe the stock is super cheap, explains Doug Hughes, editor of Bank Newsletter. It may soon be a di erent story; with the relative strength building the stock may eventually catch the attention of investors that follow the technical charts. And with a tangible book value of $26 or so, the stock may also catch the attention of fundamental investors. At Oppenheimer, the insiders always buy shares each and every year and never sell any shares. You have got to love that. The company even bought a bunch of its own stock back at low prices that were way under book value, adding to shareholder value. Fair value for the stock in this market is $30.00 to $33.00, well above current price levels. With a takeover deal, however, I would expect they could get $38 a share at the low end and a high-end upside target of $44. This investment bank is relatively small; as a result, I believe a deal is the thing that makes the most sense in this low interest rate world. So, while the stock is certainly trading like a deal could come at any time, it is still cheap. Oppenheimer Holdings also does have options, which is rare with a smaller cap stock. As a result, you can make even more money with less capital. Banknewsletter.comDoug Hughes203-942-5905dhughes33@charter.nethttps://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/2017-bank-m-a-statistics-11299/"

"My banking relationship with Fifth Third is possibly the worst commercial relationship I've had in the last 32yrs. Who needs a bank that cuts your line of credit without notice a week before you need it? (Twice) even as your debt has bee dramatically reduced since you took out the line? A joke. I can't express how excited I am to go to the bank today and sign papers to close all my accounts/loans/line of credit. I'm practically giddy about never doing business with them ever again. Sorry, I had to let out this excitement. Go Browns!"
There is just no hope for this company and for the stock. Someone needs to buy them out.

"This bank is a house of cards. Management’s style is to throw something at the wall to see if it sticks every few months, and it never does. Management speaks well about mission, principles, etc. but fails miserably at believing in or executing on those high and mighty values. This one is a snake in the grass. Management communication is all a big show of stand-up, nice guys...with a very thin veneer."
"So I've made a lot of money off of FITB... I bought low, really low, in 2008 when everyone said not to. I've seen the stock leap up, drop down, inch up, stay flat, but I was always glad I held onto it in the long run. This last drop of 15% or so hurts in the short run, but Fifth Third always bounces back. I'm staying long... just my opinion."
Who is running this company? Good news equals drop in price.

Like the stock but ready some of the stories on layoffs. Typical leadership garbage when they talk about the need to eliminate. There is no value in handing out $1k bonus to all employees on to layoff. The money would have been better banked and used to fund jobs. Also they talk about the weakness in the Louisville market but they layoff in other more sustainable markets. CEOs need to think about the shareholder and the employee. It will make for a stronger company in the long run IMO.

"Long term customers just don’t matter to FITB anymore. A customer for just over 50 years I hadn’t used my Mastercard in quite a while.

After waiting 13 minutes on the phone to talk to a “rep” I was told I could apply for another. As I thought about it, I really don’t need another one. BB&T is more than taking care of my needs. Next week I’ll begin to move my investments away from Fifth Third and over to BB&T. I wonder if FITB will call me while the $3.8M is in motion or after it is gone. So, all you did was cancel a simple credit card and it cost you $3.8M. Was it worth it?"

These bank stocks are undervalued. The 10-Yr Bond have taken off.
Read the new article on FITB in Crains Chicago Business. This thing is going a lot lower sooner or later. Smaller version of Wells Fargo. The bank is out of its league regarding the hyper competitive Chicago banking market. Chase and Harris are eating their lunch along with some of the smaller locally owned commercial banks.
Probably the goofiest name for a company’s ever.

"Douglas Hughes, BankNewsletterOppenheimer Holdings (OPY) is the cheapest investment bank around, based on a price to book, price to earnings, or any measure you want to use; in addition, it has a super-smart guy running the shop.The company recently announced what may be the best quarter they have ever had. They blew away earnings estimates by 25% to the upside, plus a huge tax gain of over $10 million from the new tax laws. Wow, what a quarter.They even bought back 450,000 shares at $15.75; these are impressive buys. The stock has had a huge run, but again it could double from here now with $4.00 to $5.00 in earnings power this year; if rates keep going up they will make a small fortune.I think with the earnings power peaking this year or next, they can now get $50 a share in a buyout, almost a double again from here. Not many shares are left with that latest buyback done and insider ownership so high.They didn't raise their cash dividend and didn't announce a new buyback plan. Granted the stock is way up, but that idea that they didn't put a new plan in place or pay a special cash dividend strikes me that they are going to now sell their firm."
