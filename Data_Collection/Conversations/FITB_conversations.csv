Fifth-third needs to increase dividend to break out of this current trading range.

hello to the board and god bless to all .. question for holders is fitb honoring their current yield? looking to park a nice coin with yearly yield ..thk u godspeed
This happens a lot with this company. They beat estimates and the stock goes down????
"FITB, along with RF, have strong balance sheets. With today's dip in FITB, I believe it to be a bargain. Consolidation will be the big story with banks in a few months. Big banks are making billions for giving away billions of your money, called stimulus money. Their take is rumored to be almost 3%. Their exact take is a big secret. I can't find it. Anyway, it's found money on the balance sheet to use for buyouts.Only in America!"
These bank stocks are undervalued. The 10-Yr Bond have taken off.
"Long term customers just don’t matter to FITB anymore. A customer for just over 50 years I hadn’t used my Mastercard in quite a while. Today I was notified that it was cancelled due to inactivity for my own “protection.” Some protection. No letter. No phone call. No nothing. After waiting 13 minutes on the phone to talk to a “rep” I was told I could apply for another. As I thought about it, I really don’t need another one. BB&T is more than taking care of my needs. Next week I’ll begin to move my investments away from Fifth Third and over to BB&T. I wonder if FITB will call me while the $3.8M is in motion or after it is gone. So, all you did was cancel a simple credit card and it cost you $3.8M. Was it worth it?"
"Well, looks like I am going to be stuck in this stock for a while unless I want to take a loss. Solid company with a $30 stock price now far off in the distance..."
PE ratio is so low! Why isn’t this stock valued higher?
I once had a Malibu Wakesetter financed with Fifth Third Bancorp and they were a pleasure to deal with. Glad that I found out about the company because it's looking like a good one to own stock in. Starting a long-term position. Not sure how long the dividend will hold up but I think the bank will prevail through this corona virus and come out strong on the other side. Cheers!
"This professional equity research analyst is BULLish on $FITB, also $KEY and $CFG:https://www.twst.com/news/wedbush-securities-best-street-banking-analyst-picks-best-regional-bank-stocks/"
Insider buy/sell ratio is very positive for FITB and other banks.
"interesting market. an electric car maker that's broke commands $280/s, and the stock of a well-managed bank-- that has a great quarter- doesn't budge. and hundreds of pot ipo's are going to make you rich. sure they are."
I expect fifth third bank will report a very good quarter. And I believe the next quarter will be even better.￼
Gets thru the 50 moving avg. and I will be happy with buy today !
I have a hard time with the CEO getting a 29% increase for 2018 while stockholders took about that much loss over the nine months since announcing the MBFI purchase.
I went into $FITB and opened some new accounts to invest all my market profits in. Got some incentives like a can couzee which is nice.
Will current dividend rate of 1.08 be affected by this stress test?
FITB reached a 52 Week high at 44.94
current ascending triangle (or pennant) chart formation indicates a highly probable retracement to $17.90. Let it ride!
