"This is well below the 200 day ma, I think this is getting to be a bit oversold. solid company, 3rd qtr. numbers should be good."
Guidance and tone seemed quite positive considering. 2Q not down nearly as much as I thought and still pushing through expansion and startups to gear up for 1Q backlogs heading into busiest period. Also mentioned less than 10% builds are done on debt/refinancing contrary to what Eisman mentioned?
Timber !
"big day tomorrow, need a lower close to validate the H&S break today on the daily, target 94, above 127 invalidates"
love to see this one split again
TREX reached a new All Time High at 119.86
TREX is down 9.67% to $52.49
"A PE of 48 with an uncertain economy and increasing competition. As people see that reopening the economy doesnt mean we are back to where we were 6 months ago, the market heads lower and TREX heads to retest lows."
What caused the huge bump up in share price here?
"Close below 119 this week would be a good start, takes out last weeks low, work to do still but can start looking at gaps that should be filled. New short interest data for the month be out tomorrow venture to say we saw a lot of capitulation. See how things play out GL"
Thanks for the cheap shares. Since 85% of their residential revenue comes from home remodel vs new home sales I'm glad to see new home sales hit a slower pace. More and more people staying in their homes and remodeling with outside living being high on the list.Last qtrs call was all about the initiatives in place to drive back rev performance and improved margins. Last but not least their corporate tax rate goes from 33% to 22%.
Loading up the Honda Civic with puts.
Trex is down 8.07% to 132.84
Trex reached an all time high at 80.85
Rebuilding after storms on East coast and in the gulf will be a big boost by December. Plastic raw material has never been cheaper or more plentiful. Go Trex.
"AZEK, the Thinking Investors choice!"
125 blink away...is we see capitulation in S&P to 3k area trex will rocket to 150...short term cannot fight liquidity of which there is plenty
What's up with the sudden increase in short sales. Only news I have seen seems good.
Here come the 80's.....
Nice comeback
TREX reached a new All Time High at 83.27
"It's getting knocked lower. On down market days, which are extremely rare these days, it goes lower. On big up days, they don't let it go higher and it basically closes flat or up 10 cents. It's positioning to head lower. Happy to be short the name. I think it's way overpriced. The multiple is laughable."
Decent earnings report this quarter. Last quarter's report was also decent. Both times the stock retreated after earnings.
Strong presentation this morning. Remember this executive team is at the age to sell this Co and enjoy the fruits of their labor.Up 8 points in 3 days !! Sometihng i going on !
Is it just me or does this seem to be climbing on super thin volume? Not sure if we are even going to hit 150K shares on a pre-split adjusted basis. Seemed like it was the same yesterday or the day before.
This stock clearly looks overvalued to me. What is this company's competitive advantage that investors are bidding up this stock this high?
why is it tanking ?
"$TREX testing that trading channel of $93 price point. It did the same thing late January, Early March, Late March, and August 2. It's done it every time and failed every time. Trading channel is $119 on December 31. Testing that is possible. That's a 20%+ return in 3 months."
$trex$mict
TREX reached a new All Time High at 80.81
very sloppy today
$azek trades at 7x sales and $trex 12x. Azek just announced a great q and has a tiny float. I thought we might see $55-60 given the company comparison. What am I missing???
Nice comeback!
selling out as fast as it comes in
"Trex is a beast, see if we get a lower high with neg divergence over next few days, if not, the post 9/11 psyche argument to gain steam, people staying in spending on their homes for foreseeable future, credit still flowing, for now. See how it plays out, ticking tops is not easy"
I guess the question is: will TREX announce a stock split this when they announce earnings next week?
50 PE . What a bubble market. I’ve never seen sticks go up this much in my life
Hopefully we get a nice rally tomorrow 
Should see TREX split 2 for 1 in next few weeks- set the stage for next big run-up. Last time they split the stock in May.
pt of 150 by years end...
Any news or updates on Trex?
great presentation.......new ticker = POS
Anybody selling this stock into earnings will be disappointed come Monday. They will rock this qtr with record revs and earnings.Just I said a couple weeks ago- 75 3rd qtr and 85 year end ! They are taking share - lumber going up- TREX is not.
TREX reached a new All Time High at 79.70
100.70 area would fill gap from may 4th
"I've done very well investing over the years. Good enough to be able to retire at 53, but I really blew it on this one. I'm guessing I owned it between 14 and 15 years ago. Gave up on it way too early. Hats off to those of you who held."
Will someone explain to me what is holding this stock up? It makes no logical sense!
After today I'm not that concerned about back order waits on this material.
Expect the Company will be stepping in with buybacks to slow the bleeding. They're showing what they think it is worth here today.
Trex has been going downward steadily for 3 weeks. I cannot find any news or opinions as to what the heck is going on. This is really worrisome when there is no explanation.
Thank you for the low volume sell off- added shares
"Been in and out of TREX for about 5 years. Love the management and product, which I have used often. I always make a profit and buy in 100 share lots. Also do LOW shares. I am patient and if my orders don’t fill it’s no big deal. Portfolio has amaz, Tesla, pvex, msft, appl, nio, plus others. TREX has far to go and often they cannot be found. Sold out!"
should we expect a stock split if it keeps this up? they split around 135 a few years ago.
Trex reached an all time high at 105.74
TREX reached a new All Time High at 122.19
Big time short squeeze pre earnings
I'm short again at $130.
"Trading above $110 which is at a level before the downturn due to coronavirus. Don’t see the value equal with the new uncertainty regarding people’s income, double digit unemployment, consumer confidence, not to mention the quality concerns now surfacing regarding the durability of this product- think great short opportunity as see 20-30 downside ultimately before end 1st Qrt 2021"
88 PT trading at 104 LMAO
I can smell 100. Maybe another split?
TREX reached a new All Time High at 127.20
"Last heads up for you all, 75 Q3 and 85 by year end !"
TREX reached a new 52 Week Low at 64.97
come to Papa.. Looking at that $94 target
Was a bit early and averaged in as such but this stock is primed for 20-30 drop
Apparently I missed something! Major hit - any ideas out there?
Procrastinating caused me missing the boat and cost me the trip.
Hopefully the presentation tomorrow tees up a great summer !
TREX is up 9.27% to 115.98
It's interesting (and depressing) that TREX is always categorized with home builders. TREX's business has almost nothing to do with home building. It's abut 5 % of their market.
3rd down day in a row for TREX while the market has been up huge all week. You have to love this price action if you're short; like me.
when is the split?
"Yahoo, please fix Trex numbers"
Extremely overvalued. Small float and very easily manipulated.
Supposed to split today ?
Not liking at all that this was the only stock in my portfolio besides UnH that finished down... maybe bc of the homebuilder issues?
"Could squeeze to 150, however, some significant neg divergent setups now have structure which is important, does not mean we cant go higher, but from a tactical setup the divergences are enough to deploy some more shorts out there. Keep it small when Vol picks up you don't need large positions, 1-2% max capital"
"Anyone believing that people will be spending $10-$25K on building a new deck, repairing an old one, fixing a fence, etc., is kidding themselves. Estimates of the unemployed are increasing by the week. Many of those lost jobs won't return in the next 12 months, if ever. This isn't the Lehman crisis where people lost their homes due to the subprime mortgage crisis. Those people should have never qualified for loans in the first place. This time, regular, hard working people that have never experienced unemployment will start scale back on purchases to only essentials and very small luxuries, if any. Those with secure jobs won't risk their cash and will keep money on the sidelines in case things get worse. Why this stock has gone up so much in just a matter of days shows just how little research investors do."
Great buy guys!
TREX is down -6.55% to 104.49
TREX reached a new All Time High at 88.37
Anyone here? Today is last day to buy . Split on Monday
The end is near if your short this one. If market stays in tact this will be 150 plus by Sept. Taking serious market share from treated wood products and acquisition last summer is going to add serious earnings as well.My brother has a huge home remodeling business that does a lot of decks and they wouldn't use anything else for a quality job- Prices on lumber rising makes the decision to use Trex that much easier. 1% of share is 50m and the wood still has 80% plus share
Steve Eisman just put a target on TREX
"Relative strength vers sector and market, this thing is acting extremely bullish. Does not make sense to me, but my feelings are irrelevant"

Love hometown TREX.
TREX reached a new All Time High at 70.25
"Follow up to CNBC spot - what is the best measure of valuation for this co/industry. Have had a little more time to sit around and watch CNBC and was curious to pursue the thesis asserted. This is straight/high end building products right? If so nearly 35 (per yahoo) seems a bit high. This feels like a tech stock multiple. I looked at growth thinking this might be the driver. Seems like rev grew 17% from 16 to 17 and 21% from 17 to 18. 18 to 19 seemed to be increase by only 9% in a booming economy/stock market? I get it that its growth on a bigger denominator, would expect more to support the high PE. Something doesn't seem to be adding up here. I thought maybe it was distributing dividends, but couldn't see any. Thought maybe stock buyback. O/S shares dropped from 17 to 18 slightly and yahoo didn't show that data or EPS for 19. I'll have to follow up a bit on this. Per Yahoo the NI grew by only 7.5% from 18 to 19. I discount the 17 to 18 growth as likely related significantly impacted by the tax rate reduction (that could be in jeopardy down the line to recoup stimulus). I have a bit more experience following PE companies sot thought maybe an EBITDA multiple may be a better measure. Here based on yahoo, on a $5B market cap and $202M of 2019 EBITDA that is a 24x multiple. That seems to be high. Per the attached, I could not see anything that high that would align here. https://www.equidam.com/ebitda-multiples-trbc-industries/ I did not that this does seem to have a good cash position, so can weather a bit of the financial storm that may be brewing. Just curious what the expected drivers will be going forward. Seems like there is a little short covering draft up this afternoon headed into the weekend."
125 coming soon...tape is strong and many stuck short still....do i agree with it? No. but the tape is the tape
"Wrong on trex I am, ridiculously bullish price action, timing wrong means I am wrong. Looks like levitation until at least next earnings call"
I started following 'Lion Stox' and lost a fortune. Go to website to lose the rest of ur $ or simply visit the  stock store.
Friday Sept 11 tomorrow is the last day to buy before we trade sept 14 split 
Time to sell Trex
For some commentary see: https://seekingalpha.com/news/3402780-trex-bounces-back-analysts-chime
"I’ve owned and followed Trex for quite a while. Their conference call was very reassuring. They are proud of their new railing and their new processing system. And, while the exact statistics are difficult to obtain, they feel constructed material continues to take share from wood for the applications they serve. I might mention that gross margins were above 45% and revenue growth exceeded their five year historic rate of 13%. The market is enormous and this is a small company but branding is an important part of their funds allocation. Also, raw material, recycled plastic, is much more plentiful. I can’t find a reason for the stock to be weak other than the volatility associated with small capitalization."
Way way overvalued. Now market rotating out of this sector
Did Hedge funds drop their  on TREX? SimplytardStreet
AZEK is Trex's main competitor and has yet to follow Trex's upwards trend. Lots of room to grow in AZEK
Most recent analyst targets for TREX are $88 to $100 yet this is above $125 with all the uncertainties ahead
"150 soon, high beta still in rip the face off rally mode, looking at valuation irrelevant in this environment. Narratives irrelevant market does not care about those either. Nasdaq'ish 2000 out there. It ends when it ends and not a day before"
Guidance not good Sell
"Trex stock price target raised to $93 from $72 at B.Riley FBR & $95 from $75 at Stifel Nicolaus today (Oct. 29, 2019). https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/trex"
Amazing company. Thank you for the 20% discount. All in!
tried to fall below 118.6 several times and finds some support there. Once that is gone it will hit <110
43 PER in current market conditions ahead of economical turmoil. Crazy valuation. Shows the disconnect between markets and the real economy.
"Pain Train higher still...125 in sight...If SnP cash gets to 2935 will put the short out on this, july 75 puts. looking to pick up for $1.00......a move back down to 95 area before mid june should allow for 250-300% return on that trade. Be disciplined, rr getting juicy shortly"
Overvalued. Insider sells. Market rotation. I’d say be short
TREX reached a new All Time High at 82.21
Bubble here and market starting to move away
The spread tonight is up to 170. What’s that all about?
Crazy that a stock can be up 7 points on 200K shares. That's irrational exuberance if I've ever seen. Shares are being bought ahead of tomorrow's conference.
"5/15 Gap filled. next gap 5/4 100-106.....SnP nazzy all extreme overbought, 5% pullback could get the sharp drop back to 95 area....let's see"
Would some e explain to me why this stock keeps going up. Isn’t logical
"125 next week likely as SnP continues its pain trade higher. Potentially 150 on a capitulation of shorts. This thing is not done that was NOT a blowoff top week. That is a bullish breakout week, one that has everyone shaking their head and baffled. Those are the most powerful moves as most gnash their teeth in amazement.. Pain ahead"
This move will be reversed and then some by Wednesday next week. no structure to it
"Had dinner with a friend who is a very experienced contractor and asked about Azek products. Didn't even know he'd know the company. Turns out, he swears by them. Said they were far superior to $trex and he always chooses azek (timbertech) over trex. He also likes their other building supplies and views them as excellent quality, which he always chooses if needed in the project. Had genuine enthusiam all around."
Next week Jim Cline is in New York for the Baird Global Conference- time to begin the next leg up.
"I’m not a shorting man, but this stock would be near the top of my short list"
When does this become a buy again?
I think it is coming back.
Anyone - Why does yahoo finance show EV 4B LESS than MC with very little debt?
"What a safe haven, TREX the new gold, quite amazing I am guessing similar to post 9/11, q2 is going to be a monster quarter as everyone has been home doing home projects, it will probably signal a peak in demand as we have likely pulled forward much of 2021/22 demand. Time will tell but it appears the 9/11 similarities are playing out"
TREX is down -49.70% to 64.97
we are at that level again (118.6). Close below this today and then downhill
Taking a starter position here $80.25 - good long term investment
RED in AH.........looks like a top is in.
"I almost tripled my shares today since it appears nobody read the recent excellent quarterly report. To those who foolishly sold, THANK YOU for your shares."
"The apparent reason for the share price drop today:Baird analyst Timothy Wojs downgraded Trex Company Inc (NYSE:TREX) to Neutral from Outperform and lowered the price target to $108 (implying an upside of 14.7%) from $116. Decking channel checks suggest sell-through demand will be slower in Q3 and Q4, driven by a combination of material and labor constraints, tougher compares, inflation and seasonality, Wojs notes. The analyst remains bullish on ""long-term industry secular drivers"" and expects sell-in to exceed sell-through in the second half of the year as channel inventories are replenished. However, he says that slower end-use sales could create a ""sentiment overhang, limiting near-term stock upside."""
Excellent earnings report and forward statements.
"CGC Canada just made it legal, let’s us build on that"
Buddy text back while on break there and said they can’t ship overseas.
Run is over (valued). Nothing but downside here.
"I built custom decks for about 20 years , this is the time of year when the phone rings off the hook . every body wants you to start early spring ."
"Everyone says that there is a lot of money going into home improvements. I spoke to some workers at Home Depot and they said that its true, however the money is going to DIY products mainly, such as paint and simple improvements (landscaping, etc). People are still saving their big bucks for fear of rainy days coming (figuratively not literally)."
"I believe today's decline is n ""false"" news. Housing is booming and Trex decking is almost always an added home improvement. I added today"
Good to see Trex is up after that baloney sell call on CNBC yesterday. Trex dropped yesterday while CNBC let the short seller said to sell Trex.
Retest in 50's coming.
"Zero debt. Small market cap. Increasing Revs. Even if this goes down, keep buying. If they continue growth look for it to bought out in the future."
I heard that you can grind up your decking or fence to make composite burgers. That explains why this stock is booming. Its competing against Beyond Meat.
Bought more at $135
"Bad news for holders of TREX. This week, AZEK goes public. They're going to seriously cut into TREX's marketshare. Look them up. They're a real deal company."
Headwind for Trex is home equity loan interest no longer deductible under GOP tax reform bill just signed into law.
"Now, these last few weeks make me very curious."
This is such a great company. I've been holding them for years. Will sell only if my kids will have no food on the table.
I am back in. Again retail investors placing TREX in with home builders. People how many times does Trex have to say it-- 85% of their business is home remodel. The home remodel business is through the roof- no pun intended ! I was at the largest TREX dealer in the SE in Atlanta today and they said TREX was seeing unbelievable sales out of their Home Building Co. TREX had built a 2 story display in front of their store- very impressive.All year long TREX has said the greatest manufacturing savings will come the back half of the year- go listen to their CCs.See you in the 80s by year end !
For those who use this product--what do you find to be so special about it? Is it just about durability? Trying to understand why people rave about this company...
Anybody reading the board knows I have been on this horse since around 104.00 pre-split. I sold half my shares today after a 50.00 plus share gain. Next win-- symbol MOV - earnings in a couple weeks will be awesome- love retail !
"Hard to believe you can buy this building materials company on the cheap, only 10X sales. Building industry on the cheap!!"

What’s everyone think? Up after earnings
Sold Trex bought Doge
Today was the last day of their dog and pony show. They spoke at two conferences the last two days.
Shorty back in control here. This stock price is going to get pummeled on the first big 500+ point down day. It's coming. The market doesn't go up forever. It's way overdue. I love when companies I'm short go down on big up days. Generally that means they're headed lower.
I'm a contractor. When lumber prices skyrocketed we looked for alternatives. Now Trex is sold out all over our local markets.
Trex reached an all time high at 116.89
TREX is up 6.19% to $65.10
after hours 15% drop. stocks are making crazy moves lately
TREX reached a new All Time High at 66.28
why crushed after good earnings?
Well I will be tha only one here. Let's get ston''d
If S&P break of 2900....trex to 125 quickly...pain trade higher
I bought puts when 122.60 and its already $5 more up. Do i buy more next week or just wait.??
"beats by $0.02, beats on revs."
Are earnings before or after on Monday
Is it enough to invest this company now?
Is that enough action for you Jodi !
Feels like a pretty narrow door to get out. My gut tells me it depends whether an institution or two breaks ranks.
TREX reached a 52 Week low at 56.95
beats on everything and drops 9%? how does that make any sense?
Banks are ceasing to make equity loans. How will this impact sales revenue for trex? What percentage of customers rely on a home equity loan for their product?
Good buy around 60 dollars IMO GL
was told at lowes yesterday that there is a 4 week wait to get trex products
"Help understand this split as a dividend. I didn't own it next-day, so I don't get the 2/1 split, so it goes split monday, and if I buy today, I loose 50%, because I didn't have any on ex- day???"
I can't wait to buy this for $75 a share. Can you imagine?? What a deal that will be.
where Eisman stopping out?
roger yiu said things are going to happen ... no after hour trades what is going on
"Just reading up the reviews and apparently this product is horrible. Go read the review by ""TREX Decking extremely disappointed"" and see all the negative reviews. Do not own this stock but may be you want to read before you invest."
