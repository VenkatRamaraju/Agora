Apparently I missed something! Major hit - any ideas out there?
Not liking at all that this was the only stock in my portfolio besides UnH that finished down... maybe bc of the homebuilder issues?
"Anyone believing that people will be spending $10-$25K on building a new deck, repairing an old one, fixing a fence, etc., is kidding themselves. Estimates of the unemployed are increasing by the week. Many of those lost jobs won't return in the next 12 months, if ever. This isn't the Lehman crisis where people lost their homes due to the subprime mortgage crisis. Those people should have never qualified for loans in the first place. This time, regular, hard working people that have never experienced unemployment will start scale back on purchases to only essentials and very small luxuries, if any. Those with secure jobs won't risk their cash and will keep money on the sidelines in case things get worse. Why this stock has gone up so much in just a matter of days shows just how little research investors do."
last chance to buy under 100...
43 PER in current market conditions ahead of economical turmoil. Crazy valuation. Shows the disconnect between markets and the real economy.
Other rival companies are always green... but this one always red haha...
Banks are ceasing to make equity loans. How will this impact sales revenue for trex? What percentage of customers rely on a home equity loan for their product?
Overvalued. Insider sells. Market rotation. I’d say be short
Is it enough to invest this company now?
"Close below 119 this week would be a good start, takes out last weeks low, work to do still but can start looking at gaps that should be filled. New short interest data for the month be out tomorrow venture to say we saw a lot of capitulation. See how things play out GL"
Well I will be tha only one here. Let's get ston''d
"The apparent reason for the share price drop today:Baird analyst Timothy Wojs downgraded Trex Company Inc (NYSE:TREX) to Neutral from Outperform and lowered the price target to $108 (implying an upside of 14.7%) from $116. Decking channel checks suggest sell-through demand will be slower in Q3 and Q4, driven by a combination of material and labor constraints, tougher compares, inflation and seasonality, Wojs notes. The analyst remains bullish on ""long-term industry secular drivers"" and expects sell-in to exceed sell-through in the second half of the year as channel inventories are replenished. However, he says that slower end-use sales could create a ""sentiment overhang, limiting near-term stock upside."""
Amazing company. Thank you for the 20% discount. All in!
What caused the huge bump up in share price here?

Buddy text back while on break there and said they can’t ship overseas.
"$trex gets upgrade and $azek goes down. $azek has a superior product! And, is a cheaper stock!!! It's clearly being manipulated."
Any news or updates on Trex?
Oh my god!!! Thanks TREX!!
"$TREX testing that trading channel of $93 price point. It did the same thing late January, Early March, Late March, and August 2. It's done it every time and failed every time. Trading channel is $119 on December 31. Testing that is possible. That's a 20%+ return in 3 months."
