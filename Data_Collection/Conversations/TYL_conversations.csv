"The local government uses this company for online bill pay. I've been in this locale for 11 months as of this post. I've never been able to enroll in paperless billing because the software never sends email confirmation. The locale has no idea why I do not get the email. Today I cannot log into the software. I get no error message. I reset password, still cannot log into online bill pay. This software is garbage. As an investor I would never buy shares of this company."

"@sidb - great call on the move up 15 days back. Just intuition, wishful thinking or technical?From the call, management expects elevated interest from their customer base due to stimulus funding. FWIW - I’m a LT hold and still see room for TYL to run."

this board is so quiet .. Tyler may be the most boring and successful Technology Investment I have. I have been buying these last two months and I know my return on this will be massive in the next year. Tyler has a client retention rate of around 95 % and the sales team that I have personally met have about a 90 % success rate. It's still a bargain price right now .. I see this rebounding to 250 plus by summer

"Delaware County PA council hired this Tyler Tech to perform reassessment of properties within the county. I registered on their website to attend ""informal"" grievance hearings. Their inflated tax values are absurd vs fair market value for three of my properties. I attended the hearing 4 weeks ago. I registered my personal information on their website 8 weeks including having to give up a personal cell number that is unlisted. 4 weeks later I am receiving 3 different phone solicitation if I want to sell my property now for cash. Thanks Tyler Tech you sold out private information. I am filling formal complaints with the Delaware County council and the PA attorney general. I am hoping to file class action lawsuit against Tyler for the breach of privacy. I will now use the cash now property solicitations to argue in court against the FMV assigned by Tyler. Should be easy win...."

"WARNING ABOUT THIS STOCK, I dont really care less what happens as dont have any spare cash to invest in it, but I was with a mate the other day who trades regularly, he went short on it, for the simple reason its pretty much already reached its median target price of $176, which is close enough to the $180 target from yahoo. The guy actually works for the firm and tells me all the staff there including the CEO last offloaded like millions of quids worth of stock from its last high of around $160 and expect it to go freefall in the ver near future. Definetely not a good idea to invest long on it just at the moment. But maybe when it gets to under say $100 might be worth a punt, but definetely not right now. Dont say you werent warned folks ! ! !! ! ! !"
