"@sidb - great call on the move up 15 days back. Just intuition, wishful thinking or technical?From the call, management expects elevated interest from their customer base due to stimulus funding. FWIW - Iâ€™m a LT hold and still see room for TYL to run."
"debt-to-equity ratio is zero, it has no debt. This means it has been running its business utilising funding from only its equity capital, which is rather impressive."
"Looking to initiate a position. Buy now, or wait for a pullback? thanks."
$TYL is up because of planned $NIC aquisition. I've got 6 shares @ $143. Wish I bought more back then. T g anks $TYL

Needham raises PT to $380.
this board is so quiet .. Tyler may be the most boring and successful Technology Investment I have. I have been buying these last two months and I know my return on this will be massive in the next year. Tyler has a client retention rate of around 95 % and the sales team that I have personally met have about a 90 % success rate. It's still a bargain price right now .. I see this rebounding to 250 plus by summer

"Delaware County PA council hired this Tyler Tech to perform reassessment of properties within the county. I registered on their website to attend ""informal"" grievance hearings. Their inflated tax values are absurd vs fair market value for three of my properties. I attended the hearing 4 weeks ago. I registered my personal information on their website 8 weeks including having to give up a personal cell number that is unlisted. 4 weeks later I am receiving 3 different phone solicitation if I want to sell my property now for cash. Thanks Tyler Tech you sold out private information. I am filling formal complaints with the Delaware County council and the PA attorney general. I am hoping to file class action lawsuit against Tyler for the breach of privacy. I will now use the cash now property solicitations to argue in court against the FMV assigned by Tyler. Should be easy win...."
