"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-bought-kaman-nyse-kamn-110539716.htmlWell, we will see how this goes"
This is a buy and hold investment . I bought this over 20 years ago while working as a toolmaker Kaman made the best bearings money could buy. It is 90% institutionally owned for many good reasons .
"Interesting that as of Monday, March 23, Kaman has not issued a statement or release on how it is affected by the virus. The stock is at a 10-year low."
Get Neal back..He did a great job @ Kaman.
Is now a good time to buy? Or is there any other cheap stocks I should buy?
