"Last visit to the local store, it was pretty busy for 3PM on a Tuesday. The place was busy and the food was good. It was clear like most where else they need workers. I got service pretty quick, but what happened to all the workers?"
"Anybody stock long here is doomed to fail. All inside dining is closed at ALL restaurants. At best... the stores who are doing takeout is 5-8% of their previous sales volumes . Majority of their prime location restaurants are on Interstates and is primarily vacation travel venues. Nobody on vacation now. Even if you are doing free delivery and free pickup they are doing less than 10% of your previous sales volumes. You are losing money everyday trying to stay open. What about their supply change? Who's paying the bills for the food stuck in warehouses? And for how long? Even when they open back up, vacations will be way down this year so interstate car travel and vacation venues will be down big time. Plus what will happen to the older age clientele? Will they want to come back to crowded seating areas? Owning the land and buildings is great when the business is good but when 90% of your sales in gone? You still have to make the payments Stock drops 50% from here"
"Biglari continues to SELL his shares,on Sept 8th he sold 258,650 shares...which came to $44.3 million dollars...He been selling when the stock price get around or over 171.00....Good riddance to him...hope he stays gone,but he still holds over 2 million shares...there are buyers waiting I hope..."
"Every Crackerbarrel restaurant I pass the parking lot is full of cars...It has always been a Wall Street Darling,I know they made some BAD investments leaving their reserve money short of what it could have been..."
"I bought this stock because I love the restaurant but have not been paying attention. Any insight as to why it is down 25% since April? Just Delta/re-opening issues or something more intrinsic. The ratios all look good, so seems like it should be a good investment based on metrics."
The stock has really suffered lately. I bought at $150.15 today looking for $152 quickly. I love the stock and place but not sure why the stock price has suffered this year. It pays good dividends.
So what happened on Tuesday??
"Find me more investments like Cracker Barrel. CBRL has everything I am looking for: Grows its business,increases its dividend, buys back shares, and most importantly, keeps tweaking its business model tokeep it profitable and competitive in the casual restaurant business."
missed earnings why?
"Did a little research. BH has 14.7% ownership, down from almost 20%. Special dividend usually get paid out in May or June. We'll see if that holds for this year. Someone mention buy backs. Did CBRL announce one?"
"Thank you for your reply... If you check out Nasdaq website, you will see that every July since 2015, the company paid special dividend and regular dividend... And if you add the amount of dividend for all quarters, you will see the total dividend per year will be $7-8... Is there any situations the company reduces the dividend to $1-2 per year or no dividend at all?"
"get in now, today market is lowering it , not the statistics, will be green tomorrow with good report"

"CBRL seems to be adjusting to the new normal for now with free delivery as well as quick pick up service. The local one is busy every night with pick up, line of 6-12 cars each time I pass the location. It seems the stock is being priced at 4-6 months out since it owns so much property and land as well as good business model. I prefer to eat in the restaurant but I did dine on dinner from there via door dash, came warm and taked great. If they were not adapting I would think twice, I am holding for life now."
"Just returned from 18 day 3800 mile driving vacation over 9 states from Florida to Wisconsin.Stopped at 3 Cracker Barrel locations. After finding the first ones packed, we checked all the parking lots as we went by on the interstates. All were full (at least 12) with people waiting outside. Our last visit was in Cleveland Tennessee in the evening - found several tables of six or more. These were not travelers who fill the place during the day, they were local people going out to eat. Wait time was 30 minutes for a table. I think they will blow away estimates based upon increased volume. Only problem will be finding enough help.Jmho"
"The stock was up $10.00 at one point,however you can bet BIGLARI will pull the sell trigger and hurt us ..However the day he sells his final shares to can celebrate,and the companynwill move along in the right direction.CBRL recently celebrated their 50th birthday..Help your stock and eat at one whenever possible..don't forget they have catering and online ordering.."
"May be a good time to buy,it's $128.62 today, the dividend is back,business looks good every time I drive by a unit,beer is being added to more stores,the menu looks great.what do you think?"
They are still staying busy and the help is slowly returning.
Maxim Group upgrades CBRL to Buy from Hold and raises their target to $187. This is a great buying opportunity at the current price of $145 to $160.
"Someone correct me I'm wrong but I read a story on CBRL and it said that 20% of CBRL strock was shorted. That sounds very high but if true the way I understand it ,if you short a stock and the dividend comes due, you have to pay the cost of the dividend , and that means most likely those shorting would try to cover before the dividend date and that should send the stock higher ,,"
I eat at Cracker Barrel about 3 times a week in Harrisburg Pennsylvania There is almost never a time when you don't have to wait. today Sunday I went over for soup at 2:15 p.m. there was a half an hour wait and about 50 people standing in the front of the store buying gifts. I've never seen a restaurant that is as busy as this one
CBRL valuation appears a bit stretched. I don't expect the earnings announcement tomorrow will contain too many surprises. sold some shares today just a bit north of $158 and will sell more if it rises past $160 tomorrow.

"This is the same thing that happened the previous three years,after the ""Special Dividend"" date July 12th,2018, the shorts move in and the stock sinks for who knows how long...The company is solid and I am holding."
"Crackerbarrel raises Regular Dividend,will pay a Special Div and announces BUYBACKCracker Barrel misses by $0.02, reports revs in-line; reaffirms FY19 revs guidance; declares a $3 per share special dividend, increases regular dividend by 4%; announces $50 mln share buyback authorization"
"This would be well over $225 per share if all the Biglari plans had been implemented. My team has never seen a large shareholder treated with such disdain. But hey, Barbara Cochran sleeps well at night, making $1.9 M per year. Where are the alcohol sales reports ? Or will that be downplayed in this family restaurant profile ?"
No dividend? Glad I never bought
"Dear CBRL Management, Wonderful results. Some areas for improvement 1. When you have a conference call, please speak with decisive confidence. You sounded like you were a middle school assistant principal giving us mixed results from the 7th grade bake sale. 2. Love some of the rebrand to attract a wider customer base, however, 90% of your business are the same people who zealously support Chik-Fil-A, and want a old-fashioned place to take their kids. If the rebrand tilts toward woke, put a fork in this company. Leave Sandar in the dust, expand the alcohol sales and drive growth as Americans begin to travel again. My largest holding."
Added at $130.10
"Just sharing a view from an old man, this one doesn’t like to stay below $90. Shorting this one is very risky. Their long term outlook has actually improved with so many of their local competitors going under. I know this sounds like contrarian thinking but, it is only contrarian thinking if you are looking at the short term only. Everything is risky in today’s arrest especially restaurants and oil companies. However, you can’t win big if you don’t take large risk. I bought 500 shares of this one, CLH “Clean Harbors, OXY “Occidental Petroleum and TSN “Tyson Foods” yesterday during the big dip. I think all of these do well long term. Hopefully 100% gains or better on all of them over the next 1-2 years. I also bought 5K of MediPharm Labs @ $1.03 as a wild card MJ play. They are already profitable and growing. As always, good luck and good health everyone "
"approved a share repurchase program of $100 million, and approved a quarterly dividend of $1.30 per share,"
"reading the transcript, it says expected operating margin in 1st qtr is only 5.5-6% (vs. 8.4% in 4th qtr fy 2021). Did they accurately write what was said?"
"This stock is such a day traders dream. Buy @$130, then sell @$145. Now coming back down. Almost time to buy again and make some more $"
"Every business has been affected in one way or another by the Coronavirus. CBRL is no exception. I still have faith in the stock and how the company is managed by the BOD. Few companies fed their employees and kept them on salary during the virus. How a company treats its people is very important to me because it shows they are “family” working together. I would never follow Biglari into destruction. I think serving limited beer and wine has helped everyone. It has attracted business, allowed the company to continue employing its people, and given customers who did not access to bars the opportunity to have a relaxing drink while eating a meal. I would never abandon CBRL when they needed shareholder support."
My gut feeling is the dividend returns sooner than later. The places are packed will people ever time I go to the local one or I drive by the locations.
As the market is in a correction as I watch CBRL percent of drop as compared to the Dow or other stocks it is holding up pretty well. It seems other see this as still a good stock to own even in tough times.
"Yesterday, a Tuesday, we ate lunch at CB. The dining room was about as full as allowed and it took about 10 minutes for the two of us to get seated. Before the lockdowns I never had to wait to be seated for lunch. I also asked the waitress how alcohol sales were going. She said great. They were also training a new server with her. All good signs. I hope the rest of the restaurants are doing as well."
"Longtime Long here. I travelled all over the country this summer and here is some boots on the ground information from my observation last week. My wife ordered a family pickup meal. We spent about 47 dollars and prices are clearly up. Drove to CBRL to pickup. Middle of nowhere Virginia. Parking lot was packed. Mostly Boomers in new Buicks. Went inside and people were milling around retail section. Kind old woman went up to ask if she could sit down as there seemed to be open tables. The hostess politely told her those tables were not open, but a section with service would be open in ten minutes. She said alright and then went about shopping until the seat was ready. There are butts in seats. People are paying the new prices. They are hurt by inflation and kids not working. The core business is still rocking and rolling. Collect the Divy while we wait to go to 200."
"I went for more, I’m totally into Cbrl. The dividend is great, so is the special dividend yearly. Cracker may run or not, but I’m committed for the long term. Now is the time to jump in."
Share buyback news will prop it for all of a minute. Sure management is hoping this will put a floor on it till hopefully virus news gets better. This is just getting started. Europe is shutting down and is the epicenter. U.S.A. will be the epicenter within the month with the most cases. Restaurants will be empty for months. It will take over a year for any kind of full recovery. This will be $75-$80 within a month unless a miracle happens and Corona goes away.
