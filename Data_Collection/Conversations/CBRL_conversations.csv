I'll repeat my post from 13 days ago and previous. You'd be out of your mind not to buy this in the 150's. Management: Sell us road weary dads a cold beer and keep the woke stuff away from your core consumer who positively despises it. Here's to 185 in July! Currently Long.
"Does anyone know if they pulled on their revolver yet? This was from the annual filing. For any of you that want to know why the FED is backstopping everything, this is why.

Cracker Barrel stock will be under $40 a share in 2 months. Wait till they report. They are not coming close to what other restaurant chains are doing in to-go. I recently took a trip down I-95 from South Carolina to Virginia. Stopped at multiple Cracker Barrels. It was a Friday. No business at any of them. A lot of money to be made shorting this stock.
"If dividend is $8 per share, can it drop to $2 or less per share annually? Thank you."
"Not sure why anybody is betting against Cracker Barrel, unless they just like to lose money. Every one I go by in the mornings on weekends are filled with people. Good company who are shareholder friendly."
"If you're going long here or TXRH, buy puts for insurance. There is no way the foot traffic is anywhere as close to where they were, until a cure comes along."
"It seems to me that Punchbowl is similar to ""Dave & Busters"". I'm gad to see they are diversifying into a restaurant chain rather into a chain of department stores."
"I just read the conference call. Earnings growth will not be there this fiscal year due to the purchase of Maple St. and PunchBowl. Same store sales are a bit soft. According to Sandy C., share buybacks may be more of a future component to returnvalue to shareholders."
They are still staying busy and the help is slowly returning.
bye bye dividend
Share buyback news will prop it for all of a minute. Sure management is hoping this will put a floor on it till hopefully virus news gets better. This is just getting started. Europe is shutting down and is the epicenter. U.S.A. will be the epicenter within the month with the most cases. Restaurants will be empty for months. It will take over a year for any kind of full recovery. This will be $75-$80 within a month unless a miracle happens and Corona goes away.
"approved a share repurchase program of $100 million, and approved a quarterly dividend of $1.30 per share,"
"Did a little research. BH has 14.7% ownership, down from almost 20%. Special dividend usually get paid out in May or June. We'll see if that holds for this year. Someone mention buy backs. Did CBRL announce one?"
Two weeks from dividend and price down today of $5.42 cents. Any idea on why such a drop today ?
The stock has really suffered lately. I bought at $150.15 today looking for $152 quickly. I love the stock and place but not sure why the stock price has suffered this year. It pays good dividends.
No dividend? Glad I never bought
"Cant go wrong here, I invest my profits they give me once a week for dinner there. double dipping some would say"
Seems like the shorts have read the restaurant report. 4% growth in seatings/foot traffic and price of each plate has gone up too. All good for CBRL.
When does CBRL usually announce the special dividend?
"It just doesn't take that many shares to move this stock in either direction.The weather all over hurt the revenue,especially in Florida with Hurricane Irma, flooding etc elsewhere..This is just a nice buying opportunity.I don't thrust most restaurants when it comes to serving FRESH QUALITY FOOD like I do Crackerbarrel.I'm sure many others feel the same way..The sellers have NO patience and are moving on to stocks that will hopefully appreciate quicker."
"Well I bought another 500 shares, but I read the conference call and saw where they upped earnings. Plus they say next year even better. Biglari gone would be This quarter is going to be fine. They are up in every category and catering is huge during holidays."
Cracker Barrel to start offering beer?
"Man, this stock is getting tasty. Two ifs. If it hits 52 week low and if I still have any cash left , I'm in. Solid company with good divy."
"May be a good time to buy,it's $128.62 today, the dividend is back,business looks good every time I drive by a unit,beer is being added to more stores,the menu looks great.what do you think?"
"Could not agree more with Biglari! How can such a good thing like Cracker Barrel be turned into something bad? Ask the BOD! Just like in politics - vote them all out! Support the Biglari candidate for the board! The fear shown in the decision to abandon punch bowl social, even worse than the decision to purchase, shows that the board and CEO need to be replaced."
"Next week Cracker Barrel, Ihop/Applebees, and Darden tank like the cruise lines. Look out below. They will be cut in half as virus cases explode. Just getting test kits now. Probably 100x the cases they are reporting currently."
Which restaurant chains are good to invest and not worry about the bankruptcy? Thank you.
"I think the company did a poor job of earnings release. They let other articles post for two hours saying that CBRL lost 7 cents a share and missed on everything. I sold and will not get back in until they do a better job protecting stock price. They have no one in investor relations evidently because I never get a call back. i loved this stock for the dividend but their are stocks that actually move upward instead of down that have dividends almost as good. I took my money over to MCD MCDONALDS that is beaten down but will rise in my honest opinion. I have owned this stock for a year and made close to 12,000 in dividends but lost %$18,000 on principal."
The storm is a big nothing. CBRL will rebound next week and be up nicely if earning are good. I bought 1030 at $149.50 and would like $5 next week. We shall see.
Will this drop BELOW 100 again? A second wave in thre Southern states may put this under
When can I buy cbrl at 30?
"Conference Call is just about to get underway. Best case scenario we stay around the $155 level during the call, then a big collapse in price as soon as the call ends, IMO."
"Might do some small increased business with the dining rooms open, but not enough to stop bleeding case. Would not be surprised if burning more. No updates from the company probably means bad news. Increased meat costs of 20% or more coming to add to the problem. Stock will retest lows in the $50's soon."

Cracker Barrel up more than 2% pre-market. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)"
I ask once again. Why is this stock up in this kind of market?
"Just sharing a view from an old man, this one doesn’t like to stay below $90. Shorting this one is very risky. Their long term outlook has actually improved with so many of their local competitors going under. I know this sounds like contrarian thinking but, it is only contrarian thinking if you are looking at the short term only. Everything is risky in today’s arrest especially restaurants and oil companies. However, you can’t win big if you don’t take large risk. I bought 500 shares of this one, CLH “Clean Harbors, OXY “Occidental Petroleum and TSN “Tyson Foods” yesterday during the big dip. I think all of these do well long term. Hopefully 100% gains or better on all of them over the next 1-2 years. I also bought 5K of MediPharm Labs @ $1.03 as a wild card MJ play. They are already profitable and growing. As always, good luck and good health everyone "
My gut feeling is the dividend returns sooner than later. The places are packed will people ever time I go to the local one or I drive by the locations.
"Thank you for your reply... If you check out Nasdaq website, you will see that every July since 2015, the company paid special dividend and regular dividend... And if you add the amount of dividend for all quarters, you will see the total dividend per year will be $7-8... Is there any situations the company reduces the dividend to $1-2 per year or no dividend at all?"
I do not see any place that CBRL has suspended dividend. Why are people saying it as a fact?
don't people need to stay in all day today to get the dividend? why is everyone jumping ship?
Nice week for CBRL. Up over $5. I think the $155 price is just too low. I think this stock will pop next year after slow growth this past year. Nice dividend.
"I shorted at $173. Wow, come on down. What a great stock"
Just ate at Holler and Dash in my neighborhood for the first time. Was so impressed that I wanted to find out who owns it. To my amazement I discovered that CBRL owns it Anyone know how many of these are now open and how many are planned?I think this is going to be a big player in the breakfast restaurant business.
"I ate at the local CB and it was busy with sit down well spaced out and a lot of carry out happening while I ate. The manager knows I own CB stock, I asked how is business. Dining in house is down, but the kitchen stays busy with carry out. It seems the servers are going to be the last to come back. I think they are going to make it, but I expect them to not do the pay out in delayed September."
Can the company go bankruptcy?
"I like to see what I can find about companies and this one has too much bad news. Too many lawsuits, too many disgruntled former employees, too many, well. companies that don't take risk management to heart never make it. this company will never learn. it also seems the customer base is primarily over 60? or so? so every year......"
Why is this going up? Nobody is eating out until there is a vaccine which is at least 9 months away as the fastest but likely 12 months from now.
"My next Pure Earnings Short Sell play is going to be CBRL. I will go Short with a lot of shares on Monday, in anticipation of a weak and disappointing quarterly earnings report pre-market on Tuesday. I expect a significant sell-off by the market on Tuesday, in direct response to the earnings release, of 4-12%. Why did I choose CBRL as my Pure Earnings Short Sell Play of the Day?? Consider:1: Stock is massively over-valued. 2: P/E Ratio is much too high.3: Analysts are generally lukewarm on the stock, pricing in very little upside potential for the shares even looking out 12 months forward.4: The business model here is unlikely to attract significant new/young consumers. They have a loyal customer base, but I see growth potential in the years ahead to be limited.There is just no reason for CBRL to move higher from the $160 level at this time, even if Tuesday's ER numbers are decent. At the same time, there is PLENTY of downside potential, all the way to under $150, on ANY type of weakness with either the EPS, Revenue, or Forward Guidance numbers. This makes CBRL one of my favorite types of Pure Earnings Short Sell plays: Excellent Risk/Reward ratio for success, with a LOT of room to the downside, making a 4-12% single day fully realized profit, quite likely. :-) Good Luck!"
"reading the transcript, it says expected operating margin in 1st qtr is only 5.5-6% (vs. 8.4% in 4th qtr fy 2021). Did they accurately write what was said?"
Battling to stay above $150. If it drops below I will look to get on board
time to buy again
"For Crackerbarrel to use 133 million of the companies money on the 58 % of "" Punch Bowl "" restaurants was insane.To write that off just do the math of how much business they wil have to make when all they net is 5 to 7%...which is fine but not good enough to throw away 133 million into the trash can...All the stock holders have been let down big time,can you imagine how BOGLARI feels owning over 2 million shares....In the past they tried Logan's Road House but SOLD that...forget the crazy idea of the Biscuits joints...all that money would have went far towards expanding a real winner.The CEO needs to be let go and QUICK....she has hurt the company and investors big time..."
"Wow, the company beats all metrics., raises dividend and gives special dividend. And it’s down. Hard to believe. Guess I will collect the huge dividend and wait it out"
Buying opportunity.
"Dear Mrs. Cochran,You will be pleased to know that I have received and voted the white proxy card, and have destroyed and not voted Biglari’s gold proxy card.I had the occasion to research BH about 18 months ago while investigating Steak n Shake, which had previously been publicly traded as SNS. I have always liked Steak n Shake, especially their now discontinued mocha shakes, but have never found them to be a viable investment. I frequently consider their restaurants to be poorly managed when I go there, which diminishes my enjoyment of their food.My research of BH, which included some good data revealed in several Forbes articles, confirmed that Sandar Biglari is a corrupt, self dealing criminal with whom I am not willing to do business. His various Lion Fund entities have the effect of directing the bulk of the financial performance of BH from BH shareholders to him personally. How he is able to do this and get away with it is beyond me, but that is a different issue.With that said about Biglari, his point about the PBS debacle is valid. It is incredible how much CBRL overpaid for this speculative asset (~$30m per store if I recall?, which would be about 10x too much). The fact that CBRL wrote off the investment to zero after such a short time is a disgrace, which should have resulted in your resignation as CEO. The Wuhan virus pandemic may have been the catalyst for the write off, but the root cause is your poor decision to a.) buy it, and b.) so grievously over pay for it.I have thus voted my shares against your retention on the BOD.On a related note, I have also voted against one of the two new BOD candidates. CBRL does not need a “diversity and inclusion” consultant on the board, or anywhere else. How about focusing on the actual business of CBRL, and leave the politically correct virtue signaling to others. If I recall, someone once said that people should be judged by the content of their character, and not the color of their skin or the contents of their pants. “Diversity and inclusion” advocates promote the opposite policies, and always demand quotas and other remedies that are nothing more than reverse discrimination.Thank you,(redacted)PS:If CBRL is starved for new expansion ideas as a means of deploying capital, how about asking Sandar to sell Steak n Shake to CBRL? My expectation is that CBRL management could improve Steak n Shake’s performance measurably by eliminating current mismanagement, and rationalizing & restoring their menu to traditional SNS items (like their mocha shakes)."
Good report yet down in the pre-market. Sell on the news?
"I went to my local Cracker Barrel on Sat. 2/29. about 10 AM. There was a waiting line and when we left, a longerwaiting line. The media hype has everyone believing the world is coming to an end due to the Corona virus.Virus or no virus, I'm still going to Cracker Barrel."
"Crackerbarrel's present looks gloomy,however if your not an antique like me don't buy,if your younger and have patience this is a tremendous buy at this price,and it will probably go lower..they do have a great business and loyal customers ,remember they are one of the very successful restaurants in the country...about 13 months ago they were at 181.00 a share...in a couple of years they will be back there..BUY and hold..."
"Wonder...is it high enough for split.? 1993 is long ago. I love the growth in earnings they are projecting for 2020. And the special dividend, what’s not to like?"
"During fiscal 2018, the Company declared regular quarterly dividends totaling $4.85 per share. Additionally, the Company declared a special dividend of $3.75 per share, bringing the total declared dividends in fiscal 2018 to $8.60 per share.Commenting on the fourth quarter and full fiscal year results, Cracker Barrel President and Chief Executive Officer Sandra B. Cochran said, ""The softer sales trend we saw in May persisted throughout the quarter, leading to fourth quarter results that fell below expectations. Our traffic was challenged, particularly with lighter users and during the dinner daypart, some of which was attributable to our menu and marketing promotion not delivering the anticipated topline traffic and sales. While our results did not meet our expectations, I am confident that our initiatives and plans for fiscal 2019 will drive improved performance."""
CBRL paying a dividend again. I got some.
CBRL not paying a dividend will of course reduce the time it would take to cover the 133 million lost dollars through the purchase of 58% of Punch Bowl....adding beer will definitely show up within the next year.Bottom line the stock will fully recover in the next 2 or 3 years...
5 DAYS AGO WE WERE AT $166.4 AND 5 DAYS FROM NOW WE WILL BE BACK THERE OR HIGHER!
"Now that enough people are frustrated with this stock and sold their shares, the market makers will move it back up to $160-$170. That's how the game works. I am not an owner, just an observer."
Yes sales will be down. However I have been in to pick up a couple of orders. The first time I was very concerned because most of the cars in the parking lot belonged to the employee's. The second time I was in still a lot of employee's cars but I realized that they were doing a very quick turnaround of customers. Back in normal times people were spending an hour+ on each visit. Now those that came in to the store were in and out much quicker than the competitors drivethru's. I have comparing the numbers of customers at CBRL's to the lines a the competitors. That comparison may not be telling me the story that I was expecting. The longer this goes on I think CBRL's quality will pull people away from the fast food that we are all getting tired of eating.
"Someone correct me I'm wrong but I read a story on CBRL and it said that 20% of CBRL strock was shorted. That sounds very high but if true the way I understand it ,if you short a stock and the dividend comes due, you have to pay the cost of the dividend , and that means most likely those shorting would try to cover before the dividend date and that should send the stock higher ,,"
The restaurant may just be about the most competitive business in the United States.New chains are opening constantly..CBRL has the brand (name) and that is why I say KEEP with it and don't change...I don't believe it will payoff in the long term to change..
Added at $130.10
So what happened on Tuesday??
CBRL valuation appears a bit stretched. I don't expect the earnings announcement tomorrow will contain too many surprises. sold some shares today just a bit north of $158 and will sell more if it rises past $160 tomorrow.
As the market is in a correction as I watch CBRL percent of drop as compared to the Dow or other stocks it is holding up pretty well. It seems other see this as still a good stock to own even in tough times.
"Biglari continues to SELL his shares,on Sept 8th he sold 258,650 shares...which came to $44.3 million dollars...He been selling when the stock price get around or over 171.00....Good riddance to him...hope he stays gone,but he still holds over 2 million shares...there are buyers waiting I hope..."
"I bought this stock because I love the restaurant but have not been paying attention. Any insight as to why it is down 25% since April? Just Delta/re-opening issues or something more intrinsic. The ratios all look good, so seems like it should be a good investment based on metrics."
"If you folks didn’t see the latest satisfaction index. If showed CBRL dropped. It didn’t surprise me. Slow service, over zealous servers and poor food taste"
Holding onto cash right now. I think some bargains are on the way.
CBRL customers are the most vulnerable to the virus. That's a real big problem that's not going away for a long time. These folks are not going to back to the Barrel soon. Add it skyrocketing meat and produce prices and you have a harmonic convergence of bad news. Throw in lots of debt and now you have a big distarction for management....This will see $60 before it sees $90.
I eat at Cracker Barrel about 3 times a week in Harrisburg Pennsylvania There is almost never a time when you don't have to wait. today Sunday I went over for soup at 2:15 p.m. there was a half an hour wait and about 50 people standing in the front of the store buying gifts. I've never seen a restaurant that is as busy as this one
"This stock and many others were inflated by stock buy backs, dividends, and special dividends. These are done for a long time."
"Earnings report is out for CBRL and the numbers look better than the market was expecting. Stock is reacting to the upside in early pre-market action. But the question is, are these good numbers already priced into the stock and will we see a sell-off later today on profit-taking and fears of the future?? I am perfectly willing to risk an upside pop and will stay with my Short Sell into the afternoon hours at least. I want to see how the full market reacts to the numbers. I think there is a good chance, despite the good numbers, CBRL can turn Red later in the day and leave me with a nice profit on my Cover. Good Luck Folks! :-)"
"without traffic growth, the company is treading water and so the stock price will not move"
I go to CB at least once a month. They better start attracting a younger client if they want to be in business in 10 yrs.
"Well I am new to this forum. I bought Cracker Barrel a couple of weeks ago and added to my position on Friday. With a dividend yield of 3.3% and the booming President Trump economy, I think the upside potential is great. I also own Texas roadhouse and their earnings report was a surprising solid beat. I’m thinking Cracker Barrel will do the same Tuesday morning.￼￼"
"CRBL is following the pattern it did for the last three years.The stock is falling after the dividend pay date.Even though Crackerbarrrel raised the reg and special dividend for the 4th straight year.This definitely helped my decision to HOLD,how many companies threat you this good.NONE that I can think of...Common sense says if they are willing to pay about 8%,I have to think there is no csh problem,and I would say Bilardi (not sure of the spelling) loves the raises..the largest stock holder.."
"Patience is your friend with this stock. Get in now, collect the dividend, hold on for about 45 days and you will see it rise to a profit. IMHO"
"Back before COVID there was a weird, below 150, above 165, below 150, series she fell into. Feels the same. Tough labor market out there, but it is hard not to pass one without seeing a parking lot of vans (families), Buicks (the elderly) et al filling it up."
Reason for traffic decline? Charging 2.49 for a simple drink is out of line with Cracker Barrel price structure. Maybe they could get away with 1.99.
"California and Oregon CB are so busy, they are on the nightly news. Growth in CA will explode this stock"
"Last visit to the local store, it was pretty busy for 3PM on a Tuesday. The place was busy and the food was good. It was clear like most where else they need workers. I got service pretty quick, but what happened to all the workers?"
Did anyone really expect CBRL not to show a loss in the last quarter? Still a lot of work to be done before returning profitability and establishing that good dividend.
"DividendsJan 17, 2019 1.25 DividendOct 18, 2018 1.25 DividendJul 12, 2018 5 DividendApr 12, 2018 1.2 DividendJan 11, 2018 1.2 DividendOct 12, 2017 1.2 DividendJul 12, 2017 1.2 DividendApr 11, 2017 1.15 DividendJan 11, 2017 1.15 DividendOct 12, 2016 1.15 DividendJul 13, 2016 1.15 DividendApr 13, 2016 1.1 Dividend"
"Massive miss by CBRL... .$-1.81 vs +.07 42% drop in sales 162 million loss for the quarter. With limited seating in all stores and even with every single one of them reopened, they can not make a profit even if they operated 24 hours a day. Stick a fork in this one, this story is over. Going lower."
If it goes to $135 time to buy and then sell when goes to $150.
"Crackerbarrel raises Regular Dividend,will pay a Special Div and announces BUYBACKCracker Barrel misses by $0.02, reports revs in-line; reaffirms FY19 revs guidance; declares a $3 per share special dividend, increases regular dividend by 4%; announces $50 mln share buyback authorization"
"iF i was a company that just announced a stock buy back, I would take my shares off the market. Standard op. for good company. I bought more today. Don't pay attention to talking heads, sometimes they are short. I am collecting another $8.20 this year on each share. While looking at a growing company. What company pays special dividend and grows regular dividends$ BTW, They beat both revenues and earnings. Reaffirmed for 2019! Watch for upgrade as soon as those analyst cover their shorts!"
Ex-Dividend Date 2019-07-18 They may be BUYING before the Ex-Dividend date to get the Special Dividend also
"I've been in the CBRL DRIP (now a DSPP -DRIP where you can buy your first shares- at astfinancial.com) since 1994 when I first bought it for $17 and had planned on making auto monthly adds (no fee) through 2019, but the price is so attractive right now (Sun. Aug. 5, 2018) that I decided to tighten my belt for a while and put the whole amount in right now!The DRIP is a great way to build equity with a lot of small buys because there's no setup fee, no purchase fee, no dividend reinvestment fee, you can make purchases for as little as $25. You can set up automatic purchases but AST is weird in that you need to fax or mail a letter to them to stop the auto purchases, though that's not a big deal. To sell the stock costs $15, so it's only worthwhile if you plan multiple purchases. The disadvantage of the DRIP is that you can't buy it immediately so the price will vary between the time you place your order and the time you get your shares (held by the DRIP), but with a company like CBRL the price doesn't usually vary tremendously and tends to even out over multiple purchases.This stock has been very good to me long-term and has been well run except for a glitch when the founder first stepped down and a bad CEO was put in place for a while around the end of the 1990's.I don't know if the special dividend will continue, but even without it there's a 3% dividend that you can expect to increase each year and I expect a good long-term return. The move toward semi-fast-food is exciting and there's still a lot of room in America to expand."
"This is the same thing that happened the previous three years,after the ""Special Dividend"" date July 12th,2018, the shorts move in and the stock sinks for who knows how long...The company is solid and I am holding."
"maybe it's just our local Cracker Barrel, but everyday around lunch time there is a half an hour wait to get seated the same thing is true at dinner time around 5 to 6 you have a half an hour wait to get seated. last week I had dinner which ended about quarter of 7 people are still lolling around in the front store waiting to be seated also noticed a high percentage of African-American diners probably around 30%. as"
Anheuser Busch pursuing Cracker Barrel in push to turnaround sagging U.S. sales? Would help both companies.

"Been long and will be for awhile. I agree it is expensive, but in terms of brand loyalty, higher margin success with alcohol, combined with these places being packed all over the South, it's easy to understand the cautious optimism. Leadership needs to sort itself out post Punch Bowl and continue the Chik-fil-A brandesque driving."
Steak n shake? They are done. So how do you think this guy can lead CB? Get off it!
"I think CBRL got whacked because the sector is under pressure due to competition. I have owned CBRL since mid 80s and it has always been a good one to own. I held when it dropped way down many years ago and it paid off, I wish I had bought more. As long as they keep current standard dividend even minus the yearly boost I will hold. They are still sitting on a huge amount of land that is not factored into the stock price from what I can tell. For me it is a solid hold."
"Punch Bowl Social was ill conceived from the get go, you can't think of a restaurant concept more alien to CBRL expertise. I hope people take this out on management at proxy time. At least the Maple Street Biscuit concept makes some sense even if it does not work out."
"This is one of those range bound companies - traded for around the same price at in June of 2016 as it closed yesterday - that is like owning a bond. The regular dividend is decent and better than decent with the annual special dividend. Is the special dividend a good idea though? I suppose it is if you do not care about capital appreciation, and with the current management guiding the ship you don't have to worry about much in the way of capital appreciation. They'd rather pay out and receive the special dividend than increase capex to grow the company. They lack vision and the ability to innovate and better market their products.With better management shareholders could really benefit. GLTA."
"Funny basement dwelling millineal s all in larger about CBRL...bought first 1000 at mid 5s in 83 when lived from LA to Nashville HCA...have added from time to time under 30....Then with all this ""fear"" picked up couple thousand at mid 70....adding up my appreciation along with dividends well over half million....all because of career in healrh care. HUM HCA and AMI...Life is good if you have few bucks live beneath your means....and all those 1,000s of stock options....peace"
Yes it’s still stuck in a 2 year trading range. Yep no growth in this stock
I bought this stock in 1992 for $25.53 a share and have not intention of selling.
"The Street is creating stir on how undervalued CBRL stock is and that Biglari Holdings (BH and BH.A) own nearly 20% of the common stock of Cracker Barrel. Shouldn't the Lebanon, Tennessee, management team be offering Biglari a massive premium for his shares, before it's too late, and dozen of hedge funds buy up CBRL shares on the open market, and then act as a unified voting block to replace Board and management ? Provincial Tennessee takeover laws do not prevent common stock from being purchased on the open market, but up to 20% per entity. The days of the Lebanon, TN, executives making Hollywood salaries are just about over. Has CBRL considered buying BH shares on the open market, thus reducing your own share count via an indirect buy back ? Fight fire with fire ?LOL"
Sad day when CB selling beer
"It seems investor still see Cracker Barrel as a safe haven for the solid dividend. Market drops, CBRL goes up. Biglari is divesting since other holding are not doing well. With all of it's assets CBRL is still a take over target. They should spin off the landing and buildings."
Punchbowl seems a way to diversify the food options with quality food and entertainment focused and younger population. Sandra and team seem to have a plan to spread out for a balanced food offering. Seems Steak and Shake is imploding in some parts of the country. Most likely why wonder boy is selling his shares to cover needed income for his poor management skills.
"I had a lunch at Maple Street in Tampa and it was busy the food was excellent. Not the same crowd demographic I often see at CB locations. I have owned this stock since the mid 80s and it has ""yet"" to disappointment me. Management seems sound on keeping share holder value as a priority."
Maxim Group upgrades CBRL to Buy from Hold and raises their target to $187. This is a great buying opportunity at the current price of $145 to $160.
With the stock market down the last two days and CBRL going up proves I think the stock offers good value to investors.Owning many of the properities out right is a huge plus with property risng in price..
cbrl - strong buy
Can Punchbowl become a Crackerbarrel? 111 stores restaurants with small investment for quality real estate? Or could they become Hollar & Dash?
"This must be a joke, right? Earning beat. Guidance was not bad at all. Shaking my head."
"This would be well over $225 per share if all the Biglari plans had been implemented. My team has never seen a large shareholder treated with such disdain. But hey, Barbara Cochran sleeps well at night, making $1.9 M per year. Where are the alcohol sales reports ? Or will that be downplayed in this family restaurant profile ?"
"Think this goes down. You have a large older population still a large percentage of their business and will not go out if virus continues to increase. On top of that their Christmas is at risk for retail which drives most of their year for retail sales the most profitable part of their sales. Think you can count on seeing this at $125 or below as investors realize this. Maybe cases do not increase, however their supply line for Christmas is at serious risk. Remember they normally start putting Christmas out in July."
keep the dividend in mind!
"I have yet to figure out how this stock trades, but dividend and special dividend keep you in money. The one in my town is always crowded."
"Nothing here makes sense to me,what do you think is happening ? MY guess someone is playing games..."
"Went to CBRL yesterday for lunch, located in the Houston area, 40 minute wait...the place was PACKED! Great food and service.........!!"
"Yesterday, a Tuesday, we ate lunch at CB. The dining room was about as full as allowed and it took about 10 minutes for the two of us to get seated. Before the lockdowns I never had to wait to be seated for lunch. I also asked the waitress how alcohol sales were going. She said great. They were also training a new server with her. All good signs. I hope the rest of the restaurants are doing as well."
"Just returned from 18 day 3800 mile driving vacation over 9 states from Florida to Wisconsin.Stopped at 3 Cracker Barrel locations. After finding the first ones packed, we checked all the parking lots as we went by on the interstates. All were full (at least 12) with people waiting outside. Our last visit was in Cleveland Tennessee in the evening - found several tables of six or more. These were not travelers who fill the place during the day, they were local people going out to eat. Wait time was 30 minutes for a table. I think they will blow away estimates based upon increased volume. Only problem will be finding enough help.Jmho"
Moved back to Nashville in 83 bought 1000 shares at 5.63.Still own no cost think of all those dividends. Stopped at Store St Charles Mo on way to Lake Ozarks...packed according to CDC guidelines. Some lady in front bought 2 dresses from store. Lots more auto driving this summer-good for CBRL. Wealth came from HUM and HCA stock options-healthcare career.Unaffected by 19 no pre existing conditions at 69.Wealth begets wealth. Peace
"Anybody stock long here is doomed to fail. All inside dining is closed at ALL restaurants. At best... the stores who are doing takeout is 5-8% of their previous sales volumes . Majority of their prime location restaurants are on Interstates and is primarily vacation travel venues. Nobody on vacation now. Even if you are doing free delivery and free pickup they are doing less than 10% of your previous sales volumes. You are losing money everyday trying to stay open. What about their supply change? Who's paying the bills for the food stuck in warehouses? And for how long? Even when they open back up, vacations will be way down this year so interstate car travel and vacation venues will be down big time. Plus what will happen to the older age clientele? Will they want to come back to crowded seating areas? Owning the land and buildings is great when the business is good but when 90% of your sales in gone? You still have to make the payments Stock drops 50% from here"
"It's looks like someone or I should say a few,CBRL will not meet expectations.I'm more on the positive side aand think they will.Being over $5.00 as of Thursday at close to 4pm is really a lot.I'm still holding and intend to do just that.Also we will continue to eat there every now and then.Especially on the ROAD they are the only restaurant I trust to serve FRESH and safe food at a fair price.Check it out,you will enjoy your meal,plus they have a nice gift shop to buy something for the person you are visiting.Also for the real bargain hunters they usually have a CLEARANCE RACK,,,"
I bought these stocks in the early 2000s as an employee and basically tripled my money. A stock split would be nice though
"I think the company is doing what they have to hoping that things get better quickly. They are going to quickly regret using all that cash for special dividends, dividends, and stock buy backs. This will be under $10 a share if this lasts more than a few months."
strong buy!!
"CBRL seems to be adjusting to the new normal for now with free delivery as well as quick pick up service. The local one is busy every night with pick up, line of 6-12 cars each time I pass the location. It seems the stock is being priced at 4-6 months out since it owns so much property and land as well as good business model. I prefer to eat in the restaurant but I did dine on dinner from there via door dash, came warm and taked great. If they were not adapting I would think twice, I am holding for life now."
"CBRL closed 4/23 around $159.45. Now on 4/25 its $167.58, a 5.1% increase.What's going on? I've uncovered no news.Is news about the potential special dividend leaking out? That would only account for $4 of the $8 increase but a piling-on effect could have occurred. Last year's news about the special dividend and regular Q3 dividend were officially made on 5/22/18 to owners as of 7/13 to be paid on 8.3. CBRL's $1.25 Q2 dividend will be paid on May 6 and it's Q3 (weird fiscal year Q3 ends in April) earnings report will occur on May 28, which is when we should official learn if there will be an annual dividend increase (usually occurs with the August dividend) plus a special dividend.Each year, for the past four years, the Q3 dividend, awarded in August, has been increased by a nickel each year to $1.25/quarter now, and a special dividend has been awarded which was raised 25 cents each year, the 8/18 spec. dividend was $3.75. The dividends were announced between 5/22 and 6/2 each of the past four years and, if it the trend continues this year, the regularly quarterly dividend would be $1.30 and the special dividend would be $4.00. $1.30x4 represents a 3.1% yield, but $1.30x4 + $4 represents a 5.5% dividend."
"This is what is called a stable stock, it provides income while staying profitable in a highly competitive businesses sector. It tends to move higher in increments if you look over it's history. I own it and do options as well. It pays a nice ROI and seems solid with balance sheet. I think the stock is worth owing and trading to make some added money."
"Price is a bit ahead of the market, but in a pandemic everyone is an expert/novice in trading equities. I invested in this company back in 1989, still holding."
"Longtime Long here. I travelled all over the country this summer and here is some boots on the ground information from my observation last week. My wife ordered a family pickup meal. We spent about 47 dollars and prices are clearly up. Drove to CBRL to pickup. Middle of nowhere Virginia. Parking lot was packed. Mostly Boomers in new Buicks. Went inside and people were milling around retail section. Kind old woman went up to ask if she could sit down as there seemed to be open tables. The hostess politely told her those tables were not open, but a section with service would be open in ten minutes. She said alright and then went about shopping until the seat was ready. There are butts in seats. People are paying the new prices. They are hurt by inflation and kids not working. The core business is still rocking and rolling. Collect the Divy while we wait to go to 200."
I wouldn’t buy this stock. Older people are not long to want to come out and that is who is always here all day long. Also there parking lots are completely dead. No one is ordering here where I live.
"The stock was up $10.00 at one point,however you can bet BIGLARI will pull the sell trigger and hurt us ..However the day he sells his final shares to can celebrate,and the companynwill move along in the right direction.CBRL recently celebrated their 50th birthday..Help your stock and eat at one whenever possible..don't forget they have catering and online ordering.."
luv cbrl.. good food.. good stock
"get in now, today market is lowering it , not the statistics, will be green tomorrow with good report"
I would imagine there is some year end tax selling on Cracker Barrel to offset gains in other stocks. I think the first quarter in 2020 will allow the stock to ramp up.
I will be adding to my position. Consumer spending is robust and will be reflected in earnings of the consumer discretionary stocks. A dividend yield over 3% will act as a buoy.￼ There is never a time when this restaurant is open that the parking lot is not packed.￼
"Dear CBRL Management, Wonderful results. Some areas for improvement 1. When you have a conference call, please speak with decisive confidence. You sounded like you were a middle school assistant principal giving us mixed results from the 7th grade bake sale. 2. Love some of the rebrand to attract a wider customer base, however, 90% of your business are the same people who zealously support Chik-Fil-A, and want a old-fashioned place to take their kids. If the rebrand tilts toward woke, put a fork in this company. Leave Sandar in the dust, expand the alcohol sales and drive growth as Americans begin to travel again. My largest holding."
"So, what do ya'll think? Will CBRL stock go down more after ex-div?"
Just tried their carryout service. Everything went very well. Even the environmental types should be happy. Not only is the container microwave safe it is top shelf dishwasher safe.
"Every Crackerbarrel restaurant I pass the parking lot is full of cars...It has always been a Wall Street Darling,I know they made some BAD investments leaving their reserve money short of what it could have been..."
should have sold yesterday dividends aren't worth it..
Does any one have any reasoning for why Yahoos performance outlook on this stock is bearish in the next nine months+. It doesn't bother me but I was curious if any one had any potential reasoning behind it.
"I've wanted to buy Cracker Barrel for so long, but after seeing their debt/income ratio it has caused me pause. Not sure when to pull the trigger on anything right now. There is no way Cracker Barrel doesn't make it though. Such a unique concept with their gift shop and just the overall feel as if it is a destination. They have the best real estate in the business. The restaurant industry is do for consolidation though. Who do you guys think won't survive? I like the Texas Roadhouse/Cheddars concept of lower price high quota, but Roadhouse was not in a financial position at this high growth stage in their history to weather this well. Lot of debt and less lines of credit. Maybe Warren will throw some of that airline money he dumped this way."
missed earnings why?
Money seems to be following tech companies right now. Would think there valuations are getting a little rich and money will seek other companies soon. CBRL will benefit
"Every business has been affected in one way or another by the Coronavirus. CBRL is no exception. I still have faith in the stock and how the company is managed by the BOD. Few companies fed their employees and kept them on salary during the virus. How a company treats its people is very important to me because it shows they are “family” working together. I would never follow Biglari into destruction. I think serving limited beer and wine has helped everyone. It has attracted business, allowed the company to continue employing its people, and given customers who did not access to bars the opportunity to have a relaxing drink while eating a meal. I would never abandon CBRL when they needed shareholder support."
Is this like investing in yellow pages buying this stock
Bought in at $146.80 - opening position (having previously sold at $164). So I'm back.
CBRL price target raised to $187.00 by Maxim Grp (7-28-18)
So the market is rewarding all these companies with no earnings. Thanks to the fed for pumping and buying on the open market to keep them a float lol. Looks like it’s headed back to $150. What recession lol
"CBRL is lower today than it was 5 years ago. Where are the numbers to prove that all the new stores, and new experimental chain, Ernest and Wilbur's biscuit house, are a profitable use of capital ?"
Bought another 100 shares today at 159.33. This is a good deal
"Find me more investments like Cracker Barrel. CBRL has everything I am looking for: Grows its business,increases its dividend, buys back shares, and most importantly, keeps tweaking its business model tokeep it profitable and competitive in the casual restaurant business."
"Do NOT vote for Biglari, he is trying to steal Cracker Barrel from the investors and no one will receive another penny if he gains control because he will take it all for himself. His business is already defaulting on it’s loans and he is hoping for a hostile take over of Cracker Barrel to save his business."
Thank you for the gift over $100 today to pick up more $90 puts for cheap. This company looks to be in shambles with the current situation. Have not seen any updates as to the current situation and what they are doing to stop cash burn. My guess is that current sales per unit are much less than anyone would anticipate.
$CBRL Target Lowered by MKM Partners Neutral USD 165 » USD 155 Target Lowered by Truist Securities Hold USD 178 » USD 159
A month ago or so MCD (MacDonalds) & CBRL were bot 165.00 ---which is the better buy... MCD today is 158.00 with a P/E of 24 and CBRL has a P/E of 16...
"Covered my PANW Pure Earnings Short Sell at $166.32 for a huge loss of around $15.4k. Time to move on, and CBRL is gonna be my next victim (Hopefully I won't be her victim.) Sold Short a lot of shares of CBRL at $161.44 average price. This is a Pure Earnings Short Sell, gonna hold my position through earnings release, in anticipation of a big and immediate drop in share price immediately after the quarterly ER numbers come out pre-market tomorrow. I can see CBRL dropping to under $150 if there is any miss on consensus estimates for either EPS or Revenue, or if they Guide lower on either parameter going forward. That is my well-researched gambling bet on this one, because as all Smarties know, every stock trade and investment is nothing more than a gambling bet that you can try to tilt in your favor via some research. :-) Good Luck Folks!"
"This is what happens every year since they started the Special Dividend (5 years) they buy before the x-div date and then sell....I think they should change the rules,I haven't thought much on what they should be,but I think they should have to HOLD the stock at least 1 year before they get the special dividend..what's your thoughts?"
This may go to the low 130's
"A shame that so many companies executive teams borrowed money to pay dividends and buy back stock to try and enrich themselves at the cost of the security of their employees and future existence. Instead of putting away money for a rainy day and improving benefits and pay for their employees. Most of these companies had plenty of cash to weather this sort of thing. Now they are asking for the government to bail them out. This after greedy CEO's and Executives have made sure they have seen their pay go up 100 fold. Hopefully they will put them out on their ears and if they have to be bailed, out tight rules that they have to maintain a balance between stake holders and not just give lip service."
"This stock is such a day traders dream. Buy @$130, then sell @$145. Now coming back down. Almost time to buy again and make some more $"
Surplus US farm products resulting from foreign tarriffs = decreased domestic prices = decreased input costs for CBRL (ingredients sourced 90% within US) = increased CBRL margins = increase to EPS. thank you
"I went for more, I’m totally into Cbrl. The dividend is great, so is the special dividend yearly. Cracker may run or not, but I’m committed for the long term. Now is the time to jump in."
"So if the guy who shorts the stock has to pay the dividend,, then what happens to the dividend that the company would usually pay to the shareholder who owned the stock to begin with ?"

yeah... ex-div day.... $5 per share.... going to dinner
"I understand they charge $5.99 for a glass of wine at the test stores. Seems too high, given price points of the food. I also think their non-alcoholic drinks are too costly."
"Will CBRL pay a ""SPECIAL DIVIDEND"" this year??"
"4/8. I am adding to my long position, today. Unlike the shares I bought on 4/3, I am not selling calls against today's purchase."
"Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. CBRL, which has witnessed its shares rise more than 670% in the last 10 years, is trading sideways in 2018. Even though the company looks promising on its efficient cost-saving initiatives, higher labor costs and expenses related to various sales-boosting initiatives are weighing on its margins."
"The CEO leaves a lot to be desired, how many more bad purchases before walking papers are handed out?"
This is a Black Friday sale on Cracker Barrel
