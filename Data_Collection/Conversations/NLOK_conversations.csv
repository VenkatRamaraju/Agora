"NortonLifeLock is an industry leading and worldwide recognized user-centric Consumer Cyber Safety business which provides Device Security, Identity Threat Protection and Privacy software that protects customers from threats posed by cyber criminals. With Covid-19 accelerating online activity and working from home, NortonLifeLock is in a great position to meet the growing consumer need for cyber safety. Management is meeting this opportunity with a step up in marketing spend, especially in international markets, and if we see good yields on this investment it will lead to an improved growth profile and higher average revenue per users (ARPU). With 90% of sales being direct to consumer through the company's e-commerce platform, operations are largely insulated from brick and mortar restrictions related to Covid-19. Additionally, one of management's goals following the sale of its the enterprise division to Broadcom is to eliminate stranded costs by August 2020 and sell underutilized assets. Management has made great progress with this goal, reducing about 70% of its stranded costs as of the May quarter and generating $750 million in cash from the sale of two smaller businesses. But there are still moves to be made, including the sale of real estate that is worth an additional $750 million. Longer term, management is committed to growing at a low to mid-single digit percent, achieving a 50% operating margin, and with share count reduction made possible by a clean balance sheet, delivering $1.50 earnings per share. Target Price: $27"
Does anyone still follow this board? Moving higher as we head into earnings?

"11/25/2020: Price target $27.NortonLifeLock, stock has been very disappointing lately, not participating in the reopening rotations because the company does not benefit from the recovery in the industrial/reopened economy, and it has sat out rallies in the stay-at-home stocks. Although NLOK does not exactly fit into the ""themes"" the market is currently trading on, being out of favor over the past few months is not a reason to give up on this special situation which is about a new management team turning around the business and investing for sustainable growth. Indeed, investors were hoping to see management provide stronger guidance that implied more sequential growth and the sequential deceleration in net new customer adds represented another blemish to the growth story. However, after years of subscriber losses it appears that this new management team has developed a customer addition formula that works as evidenced by their now two consecutive quarters of net adds on a year-over-year basis and five consecutive quarters of mid-single digit billings growth. We expect this trend will continue into the holiday season quarter. Plus, we like how the company is now running operating margins at +50%, an attractive level that was made possible through the rapid elimination of stranded costs related to the Symantec sale.As we wait for the turnaround to regain the appreciation of the market, we like how the now 2.77% dividend yield pays us for our patience. Thinking further about capital returns, it is always worth remembering that the balance sheet of this strong free cash flow generator has plenty of capacity to it and the more than $500 million remaining on the share repurchase program could provide support to the stock should management chose to deploy its capital opportunistically."
$280M of annual synergies and 10% eps accretion in year 1! We’re officially early in a new multi year compounder
"I recently saw that the 12 dollar per share special dividend will not be taxed and will be considered ""return of investors capital"". This is a bonus and once the base price is reduced to say 12-13 dollars per share this company will in no doubt draw interest from potential suitors. At the very least the company will have nice cash flow and a decent dividend."
"NLOK filed its 10-K (Annual Report for 2020). Lot of goodies and nuggets of information. NLOK is a clear buyout and private equity target. Covid-19 may spur a lot of M&A activity for reasons you may not think. NLOK would be a safe, recurring, and high-margin source of subscription revenue.""The M&A market is grim — why that may be great news for some companies""Both sides — buyer and seller — are in the same boat, providing additional motivation to get deals done https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-ma-market-is-grim-why-that-may-be-great-news-for-some-companies-2020-05-28?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo"
"@Crecy -- I think this roadshow will also help to be a catalyst:NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ: NLOK), a global leader in consumer Cyber Safety, today announced its management team will be presenting at the following investor conferences:Credit Suisse 23rd Annual Technology Conference Phoenix, AZ Presentation: Monday, December 2, 2019 at 2:55 PM PDT Barclays Global Media and Telecommunications Conference San Francisco, CA Presentation: Wednesday, December 11, 2019 at 3:30 PM PDT"
"Cybersecurity and identity/access management stocks are down today. I believe that NLOK signed a licensing agreement with Broadcom to share cybersecurity R&D for 200M. Between NLOK's 300M in yearly dividends, cybersecurity R&D, and 50M subscribers, cybersecurity companies like CRWD, FTNT, etc. have to be taking a hard look at NLOK for revenue and cost synergies. With school at home and online learning, there is a new generation of desktop users that will need cybersecurity for the long-haul."
"Latest excerpts taken from Action Alerts: PT $27In the company's press release that you can see here, the company outlined five strategic and financial benefits from the deal. They are:Advances NortonLifeLock's aspiration to bring cybersafety to everyone.Accelerates international growth in Europe and key emerging markets.Brings freemium business model and more than 30 million active devices to the Norton family.Adds approximately three points of growth to revenue with more than 1.5 million paying customers.Financially accretive in the first year, to achieve approximately 50% operating margin post-synergies.What we are seeing from NortonLifeLock now is some offense. The company is a little more than one year removed from completing the sale of its enterprise security business to Broadcom (AVGO) , and in this transformation period management successfully focused on the elimination of stranded costs to boost margins and strategic investments to grow the subscriber count in support of durable growth.With plenty of cash on hand, margins high, and free cash flow generation strong, this deal could mark the beginning of several more moves to consolidate a fragmented anti-virus industry that NortonLifeLock is already the global market leader in. And we find it hard not to like this deal, because it increases the company presence in underpenetrated international markets and brings more paying customers into the fold. Analysts at Barclays estimate this deal will add about 1% of market share in global consumer endpoint security to NLOK's already leading roughly 28%.NortonLifeLock will also gain an element of a freemium business model through this acquisition. Analysts at RBC Capital liked this aspect and said in a research note Monday that this business model ""could potentially be explored further by NortonLifeLock, optimized for better international scale, or undergo a monetization event at some point, likely a number of years from now.""Lastly, it sounds like management will be quick in generating synergies and in getting margins back up to the 50% level that we think help makes NLOK an underappreciated asset.We continue to find NLOK attractive with shares trading at low teens earnings multiple and offering a dividend yield of about 2.54%."

"Can we please ban these law firms from spamming the news section with their ""recommandations"""
"Symantec (SYMC) shares pair losses after FT reports Broadcom (AVGO +1.3%) still wants to make a deal.• Sources say the talks could resume if the sides iron out the differences on valuation. Banks who agreed to finance the transaction are on standby.• Earlier today, CNBC and Bloomberg broke the news that the deal talks had ended after Symantec wanted $28/share, and Broadcom allegedly lowered its offer after due diligence."
"With tough ceo, offer will be in the $31 $33 area , not great for holding a long time, but moving to the next idea is ok, probably announced Monday or over the weekend fair deal for us shareholders"
"There's a lot of focus on the dividend here, and rightly so. It's big. However, what gets lost is what NLOK will look like on the other side. When you look at its stats, you see a 1.9% dividend yield and a P/E of 20. But after the distribution (which shaves $12 off of the stock price), the P/E goes to 11.5 (and that's at $1.41 in earnings, not the $1.50 the company projected) while the yield goes over 3% (.5 / 16.3). Further, the company has announced $1.6B in buybacks, something that will serve to increase EPS. Others more knowledgeable than I can speak to more points which support buying this stock which, after recent divestitures, is leaner and more focused. All of this also ignores the very real chance that this leaner company is a takeover target ..."
"I don't know if anyone remembers that special dividend NLOK had over a year ago. Well back then I was 17 years old and decided to invest my entire savings into that dividend. All I needed to do was for the stock to break even to sell. I am proud to say that my investment paid off! I am 19 years old now with over $60,000 just from dividends from that day. NLOK reached the share price at which I bought it at for the dividend so I immediately sold all my shares. Sometimes risk does pay off!"
They are on a roll…
"Nice move, but why?"
"Has anyone confirmed the tax treatment of this dividend with the company? Is it a return of capital, or is it taxable? The press release doesn't say."
