"Where is that guy who had been predicting the big drop after ER for the last few weeks? And most importantly, anyone made any decisions based on his prediction?"
ISRG looks like it is about to drop. Be careful guys. I have been reading (http://the-alphatrader.com) and their stocks have been doing way better.
"ION is finally getting its due mentioning. It is a big factor in ISRG going to double today's share price,"

"I figure we could go to $370 by year-end. which is only a 20% bump, so we could go even higher."
I don't think the full potential of Intuitive Surgical's ION has been considered. I think it will be much bigger than most investors realize.
where doc Gyro ?
"Can't really help anyone about buying or selling ISRG. I bought it when an ""newspaper expert"" wrote that robotic surgery was the future, but at the time (July 2004), said to only invest money you could afford to lose. Purchased 200 shares for $4,563.80. Held it all this time, sold 100 shares in 2018 to pay off mortgage of new home in FL. Can't afford to pay the tax on anymore ""sales"", but I'm sure grandson will be happy to inherit. Really glad this was one of my ""buy and forget"" long term stocks."
"So we're sitting at the equivalent of 978 and change right now.. I'd like to get into this stock, but when... that is the question..."
$400 by year end is likely.

"It kind of feels like a coiled spring... After achieving a small earnings beat during the recent ""slow"" period, the make-up volume may result in a good bounce in earnings next call. Long for many years and not selling anytime soon!"
Excellent. $500 soon.
$500 soon.

"Anyone who is aware of this stock market's history and its share price metrics sees the PE ratio of the market is too high, putting it at a historically high, almost certainly unsustainable level. That goes for the amazing company we have here, too. Yes, this is an amazing company, and has been managed extremely well, for two decades now. The patent moat, the adoption rate by hospitals, the strategy of instrument lifespans and how they protect themselves against copycats making compatible replacement instruments, capitalizing on all aspects of the machine, including surgeon training, and then going into leasing of the da Vincis, they've been phenomenal. This company growth still has legs, too, since it is still not near market saturation. But the PE ratio in the 70s troubles me. This is high, even for ISRG. It is at this level for three main reasons, IMO: 1. They still do not have market competition, and won't have for the foreseeable future. Investors know this, and it gives them confidence and comfort;2. Their profitability and sales growth has been consistent and dependable. Who wouldn't expect thst to continue? I know I do, because I have followed, studied and invested in ISRG since spring 2005;3. Congress has been pumping/propping the economy by printing and distributing money like crazy, irresponsibly running up the nation's debt, and people have been spending it on goodies and assets, including stocks, while interest rates have been kept down by the Fed. ISRG looks very safe compared to many if not most other stocks, so up goes the price, faster than its earnings growth, taking the PE ratio up with it. I do own shares, but not as many as some relatives, and have dry powder in preparation for a sobering drop as this government spending comes to an end, which it inevitably will, the Fed begins interest rate hikes, and an ""event"" stampedes investors to the exits. When this happens, the current party of inflated PE ratios will come to an end, and after things pull back, the PE ratios will come back down to more historical norms. This is inevitable, but for now, it is like being at a party, where the liquor is still flowing, and the music hasn't yet stopped. But it will. This nation is so far in debt that it cannot sustain this ""irrational exhuberance"" (credit: Alan Greenspan) much longer. Tell me I'm wrong, but in your gut, I think you know we're all waiting for an economic gut-punch, one that is not momentary. And it will present huge opportunities for investors with cash. But now? Let PEG rates help you grasp the present state of stocks. I don't mean to bum anyone out, and if you disagree, fine, but myself, I'm not eager to own stocks that are priced so high. It is like the diving board of buying seems to have had several boards nailed to it to extend its reach."

"This is what stocks do. If you cant stomach a huge correction, long term holding is probably not for you."
"Split info:10/5/21 Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG) has announced a 3 for 1 stock split. The Ex-distribution Date is October 5, 2021. The Payable Date is October 4, 2021. I expect an uptick, perhaps 10 to 30%."
Someone leak out the numbers? stock has dropped $10....
likey the best way to appraise ISRG is to copy the Q2 conference call and read it word for word. You will see why a $400 share price is only the starting point.
Glad for the 3/1 split. Much more affordable to load up on this company with no real competitor.
"This is what am talking about, from the latest presentation:RE: ION procedures grew sixfold over Q2 2020 to nearly 1,500 procedures in the quarter, reflecting recovery from the pandemic, the growth in new sites, and growth in utilization at existing sites. Our total Ion clinical experience is approximately 4,000 cases to date."
"ISRG made its mark in Prostate Surgery, this will be coming to an end as Prostate removals will be coming to an end for 2/3â€™s of the Prostate market with the market moving to focal therapy, my brother just had it done at a academic facility in NC! Gleason 6. About time!"
This is an excellent stock but I believe it will fall to around 280 first. Earnings are going to be horrible this quarter due to hospitals shutting down elective surgeries. Most of the Davinci cases are elective if not all. My hospital did not do any robotic cases for 3 months. Same thing happened in many other hospitals in the West and south especially Florida.
