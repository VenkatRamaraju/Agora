"From ""Fresh Fruit Portal.com"": Avocado groves in California have been affected by the wildfires that have been raging through the southern part of the state in recent days, according to an industry representative.Mandatory evacuation orders remained in several areas, after strong winds helped to spread the flames. The Thomas Fire in Ventura County remains the largest of the current blazes.“[The situation] is not good and we don’t really know the full extent of it. Each day seems to bring more bad news,” California Avocado Commission president Tom Bellamore told Fresh Fruit Portal.“We’re certainly monitoring it closely and a day or so ago we sent out a message to all of our growers expressing our condolences to those who have suffered property losses and damage to their groves, and there’s been a fair bit of that from what we know at present.”He estimated hundreds of acres of groves may be impacted.“We’re hoping on Monday to get and actually do a first-hand look at some of the orchards, but that’s only if the fires have subsided, and it’s hard to tell at this point whether Monday is realistic,” he said.California Citrus Mutual president Joel Nelsen said there has also been interruption to the citrus industry.“Our guys are battling fires that are very close to property. In some cases barns, equipment, farmworker housing and grower homes have been destroyed,” he said.“It appears that citrus trees, for the most part, are escaping major damage. The fire caused loss of power which affected packing houses and their ability to process the fruit already picked, but that was a temporary interruption. “Because of the pressures in the area are phone calls have been limited.”"

Hopefully next earnings will boost the stock as restaurants are open and costumers are buying less preserved foods.

"Avocados may be good for the eyes, brainA study published in the journal Nutrients suggests that consuming one fresh avocado per day may lead to improved cognitive function in healthy older adults due to increased lutein levels in the brain and eye.The research tracked how 40 healthy adults aged 50+ who ate one fresh avocado a day for six months experienced a 25% increase in lutein levels in their eyes and significantly improved working memory and problem-solving skills. Lutein is a carotenoid, or pigment, commonly found in fruits and vegetables that accumulates in the blood, eye, and brain and may act as an anti-inflammatory agent and antioxidant.As study participants incorporated one medium avocado into their daily diet, researchers monitored gradual growth in the amount of lutein in their eyes and progressive improvement in cognition skills as measured by tests designed to evaluate memory, processing speed, and attention levels. In contrast, the control group—which did not eat avocados—experienced fewer improvements in cognitive health during the study period.These findings are based on the consumption of one whole avocado each day (369 mcg lutein). Additional research is needed to determine whether the results could be replicated with consumption of the recognized serving size of 1/3 of an avocado per day (136 mcg lutein). The control diet included either one medium potato or one cup of chickpeas in place of the avocado. Chickpeas and potatoes were used as the control diet because they provided a similar level of calories, but a negligible amount of lutein and monounsaturated fats.“The results of this study suggest that the monounsaturated fats, fiber, lutein, and other bioactives make avocados particularly effective at enriching neural lutein levels, which may provide benefits for not only eye health, but for brain health,” said Elizabeth Johnson, lead investigator of the study from the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University.The research, “Avocado Consumption Increases Macular Pigment Density in Older Adults: A Randomized, Controlled Trial,” was conducted at Tufts University and supported by the Hass Avocado Board."

"CVGW usually always goes up through Summer every year. This year will be no different as our avocado season is now and all the positive news about avocados being so good for your health as well as nutrition bars, drinks, ice creams using this commodity will only help increase the demand for these awesome fruits. We all know what happens when demand outstrips supplies. That’s what you’ll see. Avocado oil is another healthy byproduct of avocados. Not to mention they are making picnic wear out of the seeds (spoons, knives, forks... you name it). IMHO this has a lot of room to run."
