More all-time highs!
Just doubled down on my position. Very good earnings call with great forecast! Both a dividend and growth stock that still goes unnoticed by many..

Thank u Jesus .
Profit taking. Two weeks ago we’d be thrilled to be at this price. Good luck to all and go BX.
"What a great week for longs.. if you like BX also keep an eye on BAM, your northern neighbour, generating twice the revenue per share.. but the margins are better here. Expect it to cool off but I'll be happily exercising $140 calls 6 months from now.. this is a fortress"
Dividend $1.09 payable Nov. 8. Long $BX and $BXMT.
A whopper $1.09 dividend for the quarter!!! This stock should be in every dividend income investors' portfolio.
"Sls to treat 20 different types of cancer and 10-30x incoming. Blackstone owns this one. Sls to treat breast, ovarian, bone marrow more. 400% better results than current available treatments with no aderse side affects for drug gps. Read news releases the real one. We have short squeeze starting so much fudd on our boards. Sellas life sciences is exstending lives."
V and MA poor guidance caused a ripple effect on the whole financial sector. The growth prospects are much stronger here. I sold my November 120 calls when but will wait for the selling pressure to dry up and continue accumulating shares and buying March 140 calls
May the Schwarz be with you!
"The key players in this sector are all doing very well, BX, KKR , CG and APO. Plan on staying with them a while."
