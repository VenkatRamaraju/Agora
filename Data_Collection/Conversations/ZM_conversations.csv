Adding more shares under 285. $ZM is oversold and Zoom'ing is now a verb. Keep buying. Keep holding.
Keep in mind: virtual schooling will be back within weeks. Covid cases in 2 counties in my area are getting 5 student cases per day. Parents are actively petitioning school boards to reconsider virtual due to the number of kids already getting covid. Schools will have no choice but to go virtual. COVID delta is over 5x more contagious than last year's variant. Schools having thousands of kids and there is no way it won't spread the same way a cold does. It is inevitable. Workspaces will continue doing work from home for next 6 months. ZOOM will keep being utilized. Keep buying. Keep holding.
Are we still on track for $400?
Chance of getting to $400 which is 60 points away ???
I see a potentially recovery to $325 level tomorrow but sell off was intensified with high volume not the best sign....though there is a bullish convergence on the chart/oscillators so there is also bullish signs as well
Businesses Continue to Digitize Operations to Protect Employee Health
Zoom is going to go to the moon. We going to the moon baby just be patient
I went all in pre earnings at 347 !!!!
There will always be remote workers. Went to the office the other day. Saw people sitting across from each other on the same Zoom call. It’s not going away. Zoom works better than competitors and it’s here to stay. My opinion.
ZM will be the next Netflix. It has huge potential.
"This will be 1000 soon, buy buy buy"
Over 400 eoy
Price target $400! Buy now and sell at $400
"Simple: Beat top and bottom BUT, guidance fell below expectations AND, more competition."
Invest in companies with names that have become part of your vocabulary. Go.
Why am I feeling that my 305 puts will expire worthless?
I’m new here still looking for an opportunity to earn too
"hi ZM longs, what do you prefer, a cremation or a burial ?"
I believe the correct price is $350
"At what time will Wood announce ARKK is buying more, in hopes of propping it up"
The rocket  still waiting buyers to join
"Should be good investment. Flush with cash, no debt, expanding into government clients."
"I guess the market was fairly unimpressed with the ""Innovations"" released today..."
Scare out people then 400
$400 or $ 300 tomorrow?
"Not sure why this is down so much after hours. 54% YoY growth seems pretty good to me. Yes, it may not be at the level it was last year, but if the company can continue to grow by at least 35% a year (on average) for the next 5 years, that translates into nearly $18B in revenue annually. That's no good?"
always sell before earnings then buy back cheaper when they release earnings
you have to remember not to panic. downside when reporting quarterly results is more common than we would like
will close $60 $SAVA and $ANY will close over$830 good buy $ZM as well Good luck
What happen to 250?
ZM growth has slowed but it is still growing!!..be careful if you are shorting
What happens if there is a market correction? What happens when tapering starts later this year?
Started massive long position today. Let's see!
How about buying a vertical short credit spread on ZOOM (305/310) before earnings. What's your opinion?
"Marketwatch's report ""Zoom Video earnings: Expectations may be coming back to earth"" shows that there is potential up side. Monday evening will be one to watch!"
Can we trust Stanley Morgan ?
This goes out to everyone who is laughing at people losing money. Not exactly if these are kids on here but it’s not a joke when people lose money. Hope karma comes back to you.
25 x sales for a group chat app which is available with many other plateforms is unbelievably expensive. Still way to go down.
Amateur traders listen and react to FUDers. Buy lows and wait as high performing companies do respond quickly! Zoom could have hide slow growth news from public but they are more transparent to investors. If they keep $1B revenue on quarterly basis … we are good! They should either buy back or announce dividends!
will continue dipping today.
Out with my 1 share.
Couldn’t make it back to $300 today. I think most big sellers are out let’s see tomorrow!
"PE 100, this means 100 years with these gains to double the book value , right?"
Any guesses on how high the $300 puts open at this morning?I have 20 $290 puts expiring 9/3. Debating cashing out at the open. Thoughts?
Glad ARKS bought $56 millions dollars worth of Zoom stocks when it dipped!
Was trading halted? Chart for the day just flatlined.
bought the dip
If Zoom crosses $300 no turning back
Actually not expensive anymore imo since home office will stay part of the modern working life. PSR of ~ 20
Don’t forget September 25 zoom closing on buying fivn for 200 dollars a share with 5.5 shares of zoom that’s why all analyst set zoom price between 380 to 430 .. do your homework buy now because you’ll never get other chance at this price .. be smart and hold.
Will this end green (thumbs up) or red (thumbs down) today?
The  rocket started Hurry to buy
There is a new Covid-19 variant “mu” … seems like Corona is not going anywhere soon!
loaded calls and common at 290ish thank you
"don't worry, flu season is almost here"
"Gotta be patient! That's all it is, that's all there is.$WIMI $ZM"
"look like PTON couple days ago, boost before earnings... than .."
Adding!!!
WELCOME BAGS ToThePOOR HOUSE !
If your not buying the dip i don't know what your doing. The entire market is crashing due to covid concerns. This should be everyone's top play
buy more. need 2.5% upside cheers
Why such a huge drop two weeks ago !?!?I may have to buy now.
its a matter of time until all the unvaccinated kids at the public schools causes a massive spike and parents want to home school and ZM will be up 20% premarket one day
Major downgrades for $ZM tomorrow
I backed up the truck. Thanks for the cheap shares!
wait. we knocked earnings out the park. right?
ok I'm out. Will buy in again when it's 275. cheers
Bouncing above 300 today
You will NEVER see 300 again.
"Wow, congrats to those who bought Puts beforehand...."
Never buy stocks during earning days!
ZOOM boom was solely based on world wide shutdown. That's over.
What’s up with the market today?
Selling zoom to buy DIDI
"Won’t go any lower, we hit the bottom"
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
All those that said this would go down to 200-250. Where u hiding now
Google planning to buy Zoom
Funny how 2 days ago everyone saying zoom is dying and now they writing to buy it. These big companies don’t know anything. What a joke. Zoom is going back to 500. Give it 1 year
"Are things THAT BAD for Zoom? I'm going by the Google rule. When your company is now a verb, can things all bad?"
"I will be adding more. Pandemic has simply been a bonus. ZM was growing at a great clip before March 2020. It is a household and business name that is not going away. If nothing else, It has taught us how to hold meetings, talk to docs, and family members. It is driving efficiency for meetings. Days of flying into the airport and having a meeting are fast coming to an end. Business travel is really not necessary from the traditional standpoint.. ZM will Zoom Zoom for many, many years!!!"
"Take a look at ETSY. Dived after earnings August 4, today, higher than before earnings. Buy ZM tomorrow at $300, in a month will be at $350"
Thinking of picking up shares-Cathy Wood loves ZM
Next level $250… we will see if that holds
Next stop $300
Lets goo crossed $300
Value always returns. ZM has been overvalued for a long time now. That should be no secret.Problem is that it will likely over-correct before it finds a fair number...
Let me know when this hits $100 and I might think about it.
Gonna stay strong and hold until Tuesday !
it might bounce back tomorrow. don't panic.
"Outstanding report, huge international growth potential within the next months. This Stock can’t be weighed by next forecast, which is impossible to predicted, according to the CFO Kelly Steckelberg."
Covid is not going away this quickly as winter yet to arrive. Coronavirus variants to be more dangerous during winter than ever before … we see more close downs than ever! Home schooling and work from will be norm for at least 2-3 years!
SNOW and other balloons are next to burst. nothing deserves 100x valuation.
"Since 31 Aug, Cathie Woods bought approximately 506k units of Zoom."
This should start recovery soon. The day traders are taking gains at the end of the day.
Loving my $290 9/3 puts!! Bought $500 worth. Bought those today while the stockWas trading up. Can’t wait to see what they open at tomorrow.
To those that bought yesterday. lol you thought that is the dip ? how you feeling now
"When the whole world has gone negative on a stock, time to buy it!"
"power hour, could we see 2x average volume today?! let's gooo"
Sellers have sold. Time to buy in and hold
"ZM is the NFLX of video conferencing. Many more may attempt it, but ZOOM has the name now."
Creeping up
Will go up. Usual post result tantrum.
ZOOM is getting beat up!. It will recover but the recovery will be SLOW. Don't sell for a big loss. HOLD.
Zoom long term
"Zoom may be overpriced, but so are 999 other companies. It's a company providing solid service, making money and growing. Markets will have no choice but return to Zoom because bonds give nothing, and other high flyers are already high. I'm buying here."
going into $300 today
Analyst are mostly all still bullish on ZM. Just need to see where this pullback stops. It’s all about taking profits off.
Loads of pre-market buys! 2.8%
This is 100 times overpriced. 1B in revenue with growth that has pretty much came to a halt. If this was half the price it is now it would still be overpriced. Imagine going all in at this price. Someone has lost their mind.
Monday pre market +60 at least.
22% down eeek ! Might recover this year… not in a rush to sell!
don't sell instead be ready to buy at these levels
any idea why Cathie bought like 200k shares ?
buy the dips guys. you will never see this price again. Great sale today
52 week low ... got to buy some
My target is 350+ or basically a 25%+ upside on $ZM. Keep buying. Keep holding.
Buy more dips guys. this is definitely $400 stock
"If it makes you feel any better, ARKK and aRKW combined bought 200,000 shrs. today."
"Remember june 7, 50 point drop in ah and 15point gap ip on open. This will be the same"
I'm buying under 293. Will be above 300 within days but short term is going to back above 330. Keep buying. Keep holding.
"Zoom is no longer “The Pandemic Stock” - Zoom is the new way of saving money for large companies!! No more juggling schedules, meeting rooms, coffee, refreshments, lunch, etc!! For you not aware of what’s going on… everyone knows how to Zoom now!! My 94 year old mother-in-law Zooms!! It’s easy! It’s more secure every day! It’s saving companies MILLIONS! It’s no longer pandemic fueled!! The pandemic sped up its adoption, innovation, and BANK ACCOUNT BALANCE BEYOND YOUR IMAGINATION!! The quick adoption of Zoom by necessity made it abundantly clear that not only is productivity not hurt, ITS ENHANCED!! From churches to families to BIG BUSINESSES, it’s only GROWING!! It’s only GETTING BIGGER AND BETTER!! (Full disclosure, bought more at $292 and will buy on any dips further!!)"
What I'm noticing today is crazy high volume. We are talking 1000% more than the average of the last 30 days. Selling pressure is high but it's being completely absorbed by buyers and stock is holding very steady. This is a sign that sellers will be exhausted and it will likely squeeze and run up once it does a break out of this price range.
At least PE will look nicer
"Go ask your friends and family how much they use zoom. I did, and came up with zero. Do your DD."
ZM is ending the day at $305-$306. Nice move so far.
Lets go just break the $300 resistance and hold
Fall under $290 at the open?
I’m a buyer under $300
After first quarter ER ZM traded as low of $326 before it bounced back to $400+. Second quarter ER ZM traded as low of $$287 and might trade around $230 to $280 till next ER. IF THERE NO GROWTH OR MISS THE NUMBERS ZM WILL TRADE RIGHT AROUND BEFORE PANDEMIC LEVEL OF $120+
Stock is getting best up but it’s here to stay. Kathy is right on this one. Why spend $1000s every time there is a mtg and waste time flying and hotels when you can hop on zoom.
"A whole year of down, but I think we’re ready for a genuine leg up. Financials are great, and should have enough cash flows to bolster product offerings."
Results are amazing. First over a 1 billion sales. Seems like lot of fake news being spread.
So basically bet against everything Cathie says and you’ll win lol
Is this stock a hold still ???
Tomorrow it pops 10% and the day after-10%. Welcome to 21st century trading
They had some interesting insights about ZM on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
discounted price buying the dip.
$ZM is approaching super solid support around 273. It can't keep going down like this forever.
Back under $250 by end of September
"Worth $103bb, no thanks, way over valued!"
Anybody with puts? Lol.
"This Stock is just like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Tesla...it has changed humanity and their involvement in Artificial Intelligence is proof that they are upgrading humanity! If they go away, the entire world will be crushed with despair and gloom because we can't just pick up facetime and companies will refuse to use any of the several alternatives out there. you people just don't get it. Zoom to the moon!"
Earliest buy point is about 255 and think that is risky. This could easily fall below 200.
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Thetraderguide.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"""buy the dip, hold until it touches the moon."" Jerome powell just sent me this text message. sharing with all my friends "
How can they hold around $291 all day? Is it possible?
That's it I'm don placing zm calls.
The Covid-19 is not going anywhere this baby is going to Fly big guys are buying.
Buy now sell at $400
Get ready for the ride.
"I thought I got a good deal at $295, should have waited. I will say this though, if COVID does what it did last winter this will be a real winner. Unfortunately I don’t think this virus is close to over yet"
If the $293 seller would be done we can get a good bounce!
it's $400 eoy.
$330 by close tomorrow
Load up if it starts to move up here.
"If Cathie Wood buy $56m worth of stock, there is great future for this company. I am a strong buyer. All in."
Zm buy ratings intact!! Price targets over $400!! Stock will pop back this week!!
They are good. Gonna park it at 300.00. Most profit for the house.
bought 200 call 9/10 @300
Cathie & ARK invest bought loads of shares but that did not spike the share price... it's staying low for more large investors to pick up on the cheap! This will get to $350 in the next few months!
I have never use zoom
big boys buying the dips for the next virus wave
"Buying the dips on Zoom stock. Starting with 20 shares. If it keeps dropping I will add more. Last time Zoom dropped this much was back in november and it quickly recovered 25%. This should be a relatively safe short term trade, my anticipated selling price is 380 in 2-3 weeks. GLTA."
Bloomberg stock of the hour is Zoom..
Back to 500$
Undervalued
Tomorrow we will open at 310 400 by the end of the month.
Me: Is this bottom yet?ZM:
When they act like the stock is going out of business that is the time to buy
$ZOM
Another drop. HUGE mountain to climb... ARK didn't buy in since 30th of Aug... their average is a lot higher. You'd think they would average down.
"buy now, $300 eow"
Bank of America still saying $ZM is a buy with current target price of $385!
"Panic selling as I can see and people take profit on earning, I see this as a healthy correction. There are new variations identified that more powerful than Delta and many organisations have already adapted new way of working. It might slow down but the fundamentals of Zoom is there. This is indeed the best time to scoop the bottom as it reached the technical support level."
This may drop back 275

"Dayum, my prediction of around 273 as a bounce off point 3 days ago was spot on."
On Monday 300 
Cathie must be losing alot of money. I believe she was buying last week.
Omg 50k calls just reduced to 0.0$
I love the price !!
Zm will be up to 380 -400 by sept. 25 the date to buy fivn for 50.5 of zm shares which value for 200 dollars .. start buying and hold ..
Under $200 good entry?
"smart money loading up. bullish volume today, above average, on a day that Nasdaq is down. strong sign, moving up into next week"
ZM UP over $11.00 premarket
$348 then a nose dive! should have taken some profits LOL. Gonna stay strong and hold for tomorrow
"Holy, I’ve never seen a stock so flat before LOL"
I think the naysayers are all wrong on this one and I had been waiting for a long time to jump in and today I finally got my opportunity. Even if it dips further I am happy to buy shares at 290.
Bought 100 call contract for .92 each expiration tomorrow. Pray for me
This is a good report. What is wrong? Is this a buying opportunity?

does Cathy woods own this stock? she has tendency to stay in some overpriced stocks
Zoom will reverse to green at Regular trading tomorrow.
DOCU is next when they report earnings in a couple of days. The problem is that everyone has focused on year over year growth of these covid stocks and ignored the fact that quarterly growth has been slowing. Michael Burry called this one. ARKK holds both ZM and DOCU.
so whens the buy point
bought the dip. 300 shares. growth rate is still great and will be for years. PE ratio shows its actually cheap for a great stock.
bought some $300 calls for Oct 15th yesterday.
Morgan Stanley just upgraded ZM to overweight.This is a fantastic sign before earnings as analysts talk with companies before the earnings release.!
"Everyone knew the multiple before the print, that isnt why its down. Its down because guidance was probably 5% below what people wanted to see. Stock probably recovers to flat and winds up having less volatility than people think ..."
"Be careful, do not all-in. Might crash after the earnings - concerns about the slow growth."
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
"I was impressed by Zoomtopia and can't understand the sell-off afterwards. Those are live and business changing development. Especially for conferences and trade shows. Added 6 more, this is the future and I'm not worried by those high valuations, actually I think it's really undervalue"
"Town of Lawrence, Kansas, has 400 students quarantined Friday. Schools still using ZOOM a lot. Family working hybrid...using ZOOM twice each week. ZOOM is here to stay regardless of whether Delta or other mutations continue..."
$400’s a coming…. After earnings and GUIDANCE!!
Low volume is keeping at sustainment mode … going to fly upon increment of volume!
Glad I bought the dip.
"ZM heading much lower. Tailgate parties all weekend. No one is afraid of CV, latest Marvel movie was huge hit in theaters"
1y Target Est 428.02
I TOLD YOU TO BUY DOCN (Digital Ocean) in the $50s. It’s $80 now.GET IN BEFORE TRIPLE DIGITS IN MY OPINION 
I heard about ZM the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Morgan Stanley analyst nailed it!
Wood keeps snapping up shares ($14 million) she knows something good will happen here is plain out lost on ZM. Ha :)
What are they going to announce at zoomtopia next week?
$305 next stop
"Going to open at 300 , calls going to print, easy money."
350 today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now its gonna real journey start 290 to 500.. hold it for long term
