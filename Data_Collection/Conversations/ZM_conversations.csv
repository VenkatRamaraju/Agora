"Zoom is just starting. According to Zoom CEO:https://finance.yahoo.com/video/zoom-ceo-future-growth-plans-210619830.htmlZoom is a huge success hyper growth company that grew revenues by 1000% in the past 4 years. And yet the CEO is very down to earth. Very smart CEO. Instead of focusing on competitors, he focuses on customers. “What if the competitors are building something not right?” That pretty much sums up why Zoom had such a huge success. Zoom did not even care about competitors' products. Zoom simply built the best Video Conference product from the ground up and took over the market. And it is very interesting that when asked about competitions from Microsoft and Google, he actually talked about the cooperation with Microsoft and Google. Humm... that was super interesting! Do you smell merger and acquisition by Microsoft and Google?...."
Zm will go back up towards $300 level
"Ricardo, don't worry about employee stock option granting, exercise, and dilution. That is very normal for tech companies. Employee stock option aligns the management interest with the stock holders' interest, so that the management has incentive to do a good job to keep the stock price up. When they exercise the options, it is actually just the same as the company pays a pay check to an employee and then the employee cashed the check. It is actually the same. Just different instruments. And the dilution rate for ZM is actually very small. It was only 0.3% for the past quarter. Compare that to SNOW dilution rate was 2% for the past quarter. ZM dilution rate is really small among the tech companies. ZM grew revenues by 54% and grew profits by 70% in the past year. 0.3% dilution is nothing. And ZM is extremely profitable, so ZM can actually do stock buy backs in the future to easily counter the dilution just like FB. So don't worry about dilution at all."
"The trend is really good for Zoom:https://finance.yahoo.com/m/374f159a-5550-3b8a-beec-79c023008a6b/why-are-people-quitting-their.htmlMore and more people chose to work from home. Hybrid work and work from home are here to stay. And Zoom is the one that helps people to have the better work life balance. Buy ZM, the great hyper growth company that grew revenues by 1000% in the past 4 years!"
Motley did a lot of excellent presentations of this hyper growth company. Investors should go through them to understand how good Zoom is. This is my favorite:https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9d745c5a-e17e-37a4-afc9-fef71902beef/the-numbers-behind-zoom-s.htmlZoom revenues grew more than 1000% in 4 years. 13th consecutive quarter of net expansion.

Right now is the best time to bargain hunt and buy this super hyper growth stock super cheap!

Testing 300 roday
This high growth tech stock is so cheap that it has unlimited upside potential. Time to bargain hunt buying.
"We all bullish here, bears will get smoked very soon$WIMI $ZM"
This thing is heading back to 150……. Less then 50% of July 2020 users still utilize zoom. Terrible chart also……
"In my opinion, this will turn positive by end of today.. If it closes positive, it may touch 300 by next week Friday"
I see Go is still holding onto last year’s revenue numbers. 
"Some people like to act like they know the future. Let us look at what the future of this best of breed hyper growth company's great future can look like:https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/zoom-the-future-of-work/""Thanks to a technological edge that should grow as it bundles new services and scales, Zoom should be able to maintain pricing power and increase its profitability. Absent Five9, if Zoom were to increase its share from 8% of current total UC expenditures to 15% of the total available UC market by 2026, its revenue and gross profits would both compound at an annualized rate of 61% to $50 billion and $35 billion, respectively. If it were to optimize for profitability, then Zoom’s operating margins could approximate 35% and its cash conversion, 80%, delivering roughly $14 billion in free cash flow. Given a free cash flow yield of 5%, Zoom’s enterprise value would nearly quadruple from approximately $76 billion today to $280 billion by 2026.""That is a great future of 4 folds increase in stock value in 5 years! I will take this better prediction of Zoom's future over some other people's random guesses of the future of this best hyper growth company of our time!"
"Just comparing Snap vs Zoom, Zoom should have 110ish market cap, actually 120ish as they are profitable + keep beating revenue and profit estimates. Best is yet to come for ZM!!!"
"zoom seems like value stock now than growth .. LOL, buy more"
Give this stock a month or two. We be at 350 again
"Enrique, other than IBD recycling an old article again. Nothing is going on. So don't worry about it. If you missed the opportunity to buy last time, this dip actually gives you another chance to buy this excellent hyper growth company very cheap again. Yahoo just had an interview with the CEO two days ago. The CEO was very bullish. I believe we have a very good quarter going. So any dip is great buying opportunity to pick up this great hyper growth company stock. Don't miss it. Buy ZM."
"It's not just $TDOC, have people looked at other growth stocks? Almost all of them (the 20x+ sales types) have been crushed. $PINS, $ZM, $ROKU, $FVRR, . . .Down 30% or more. Has to do with:1.) massive overvaluations2.) stay-at-home trades getting re-rated3.) rising 10-year Treasury (which crushes high multiple stocks)4.) inflation rising and sticking5.) gridlock on infrastructure/stimulus (in which this possible tax hikes on the rich)With regard to possible persistent higher inflation, the argument is that growth stocks do worse, because their earnings are far into the future. If inflation is persistent and higher in the future, then the value of those earnings could be a lot less (unless they have pricing power to raise prices). Value stocks, by contrast, have their earnings more in the here and now. Take $BMY trading at a 9 P/E vs $ZM trading at an 80 P/E. $ZM's valuation takes the bigger hit, because it's earnings will be worth much less (it is argued) from future persistent inflation. You also had end-of-quarter ""window dressing"" and ""mark ups"" by fund managers, who want to hide their losses and pretend they held the winners this quarter all along, which led to some late-September selling. In short, LOTS of growth stocks took a hit this quarter. $TDOC is not alone (despite my not liking the company for other reasons - have you seen the scandals/criticisms on its Wikipedia page?)."
Really excellent technical actions again for this stock. Had a brief consolidation and then bounced right back up above 20-day trend line again. Very nice. Very good stock moves. Investors should continue to buy and cover.
"OK, let us look into why other tech giants may want to buy hyper growth great company Zoom. Let us start from Zoom fundamentals:Zoom is already making $1 billion dollars of revenues a quarter.Zoom is already making $317 million dollars of net profits a quarter.Zoom is debt free.Zoom has $5 billion dollars of cash in hand.For AMZN, Zoom will add great video communication capability to its Alexa and robots.For Apple and Google, this is probably the best fit for Apple and Google to add great Video Communication app to its native apps.For Microsoft and Google, acquiring Zoom will take out a prime competitor and make them almost monopoly in Video Conference market.For Salesforce, Zoom will add great video communication capability to its customer relationship software. It is a perfect match and great addition for its capability.In short, there is not many debt free cash rich profitable hyper growth company on the market that tech giants can acquire. I actually cannot think of any other company as good as Zoom as an acquisition target. Think about it this way. Buy out Zoom and get $5 billion cash infusion instantly. Gosh, Salesforce would be silly not to try to buy ZM. Slack was losing money when Salesforce bought Slack. Debt free cash rich profitable Zoom is way better. If we use Slack buyout valuation to calculate, ZM buyout would be worth at least $464. That is the minimum value Zoom is worth in acquisition situation."

People need to understand Zoom is a hyper growth company that grew revenues by 1000% in the past 4 years:https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9d745c5a-e17e-37a4-afc9-fef71902beef/the-numbers-behind-zoom-s.htmlZM reported 13 consecutive quarters of net expansion. Zoom is a super hyper growth company!
"Nathan, you just missed another opportunity to buy this stock cheap again."
JPMorgan upgrade. Good article on seeking alpha. PT $385
Zoom (ZM) is a hyper growth company that is extremely excellent and trading way too cheap!https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9d745c5a-e17e-37a4-afc9-fef71902beef/the-numbers-behind-zoom-s.htmlHyper growth great company Zoom grew revenues by more than 1000% in the past four years. And it has 13 consecutive quarters of excellent net expansion! Zoom is a super hyper growth great profitable company with no debt and more than $5 billion dollars of cash equivalent in hand! Zooming UP!
"Very unwise for $FIVN shareholders to reject the deal. It makes perfect sense for ZM stock price to go up while FIVN stock price to go down today. Although both companies have similar price-to-sales valuation ratios, but ZM is very profitable while FIVN is still losing money. Also ZM is a debt free company with $5 billion dollars of cash equivalent in hand, but FIVN is loaded with debts. So the deal would actually be quite a dilution for ZM if it were to go through. Saved ZM shareholders $15 billion dollars. I believe ZM can develop its own products a lot cheaper to compete. May take longer time, but it should be a lot cheaper for Zoom to develop similar products and the internal developed product should be better integrated with Zoom's existing products."
Really excellent technical actions. Yesterday it was bouncing back up from 10-day trend line. Today this stock gets even stronger by bouncing back up from 20-day trend line now. The 10-day and 20 day trend lines are getting a bullish golden cross. Very bullish technical moves. Investors should continue to buy and cover. This stock is moving up very nicely.

Broke out above both 10 day and 20 day trend lines in just two days with decent trading volumes. Looks good so far. Shorts should continue to buy and cover. This stock has bottomed.
"Don't mind the meaningless number from Anonymous. It is simply not smart to still be on the short side of this hyper growth company. Investors should buy the best hyper growth stock ZM while it is still super cheap. If best company Zoom were to trade at Snowflake (SNOW) level of valuation, ZM would be trading at more than $1200. If that happens, longs would be up 400%, but shorts would be down 400%. It is obviously better to be on the long side of this excellent hyper growth stock. Best hyper growth company Zoom is growing very fast and trading at very cheap valuation. And Zoom is already making great profits. ZM is making $3.5 million of good profits each day. Cathie Wood bargain hunted and bought more Zoom (ZM) stocks. You should do the same to bargain hunt and buy ZM stocks while ZM is still super cheap. There are a lot of companies like SNOW, PLTR, LMND, NET, AI, TEAM, CRWD, ZS, etc. that are not even able to turn profitable. It is not smart for anyone to be short selling very profitable hyper growth cheap stock ZM when there are many money losing companies like SNOW that are a lot more expensive on the market that are a lot better short targets. Investors should take the opportunity to buy ZM the best fast growing very profitable company while it is still super cheap right now. If anyone wants to short, one should short money losing companies like SNOW. Sell SNOW if you want to be on the short side. Zoom quarterly revenues are 3.75 times larger than SNOW. And even Zoom profits alone are larger than SNOW revenues. But SNOW market cap is $102 billion while ZM market cap is only $82 billion. ZM is a super cheap stock! If we use SNOW valuation to calculate for ZM, ZM would be trading at $380 billion market cap and that translates to a lot more than $1200 stock price for ZM. If shorts want to short stocks, shorting almost four times more expensive money losing company SNOW makes a lot better sense than shorting super cheap great profitable company ZM. Smart investors should take the opportunity to bargain hunt and buy ZM just like Cathie Wood. It is not smart to still be on the short side of this super cheap growth stock. Excellent company Zoom grew revenues by 1000% in the past four years. Zoom has been growing fast way before pandemic. And Zoom will continue to grow after pandemic. Zoom is only starting to get into the $1.4 trillion Enterprise Communication market. There are still many years of growth ahead for this great hyper growth company Zoom. Ark Invest research expects this great growth company to grow another 4 folds in the next 5 years. Buy ZM while it is still super cheap!"
"Trader Mr, growth stock Zoom (ZM) is a lot better than $DOCN stock. DOCN revenue growth rate is only 35% and DOCN is still losing money not able to turn profitable yet. But ZM revenue growth rate is 54% and ZM is already super profitable with $317 million dollars of profits in a quarter. And ZM is maintaining the high growth rate at $1 billion dollars of quarterly revenues. DOCN growth rate is already down to 35% when it is only at $100 million dollars quarterly revenues. ZM is clearly a lot better growth stock than DOCN. And DOCN price-to-sales ratio of 25 is also 25% more expensive than ZM's price-to-sales ratio of 20. So ZM is growing faster than DOCN while trading at cheaper valuation than DOCN. ZM is a lot better bargain than DOCN. You should bargain hunt and buy better and profitable growth stock ZM, not more expensive and money losing DOCN."

If we use SNOW valuation to calculate for ZM, ZM would be trading at $380 billion market cap and that translates to a lot more than $1200 stock price for ZM. If shorts want to short stocks, shorting almost four times more expensive money losing company SNOW makes a lot better sense than shorting super cheap great profitable company ZM. Smart investors should take the opportunity to bargain hunt and buy ZM just like Cathie Wood. It is not smart to still be on the short side of this super cheap growth stock. Excellent company Zoom grew revenues by 1000% in the past four years. Zoom has been growing fast way before pandemic. And Zoom will continue to grow after pandemic. Zoom is only starting to get into the $1.4 trillion Enterprise Communication market. There are still many years of growth ahead for this great hyper growth company Zoom. Ark Invest research expects this great growth company to grow another 4 folds in the next 5 years."
Tomorrow will testing the 275. Maybe a 280 break out
"Inflation will be a great gift for hyper growth company Zoom. Zoom is a very profitable company with no debt and more than $5 billion dollars of cash equivalent in hand. Inflation will inflate Zoom's revenues and profits even further and that should translate into higher ZM stock prices. And since Zoom has no debt and huge cash pile, Zoom will actually be able to earn even more interest income with its cash pile if interest rates go up due to inflation. Zoom is the best stock to own during inflation time."
"Nico, best hyper growth company ZM is already very cheap. If the quarterly report is somewhat decent, this stock will rocket up big time. You should buy the best hyper growth company ZM while it is still super cheap. If Zoom were to trade at Snowflake (SNOW) level of valuation, ZM would be trading at more than $1200. If that happens, longs would be up 400%, but shorts would be down 400%. It is obviously better to be on the long side of this excellent hyper growth stock. Best hyper growth company Zoom is growing very fast and trading at very cheap valuation. And Zoom is already profitable. Cathie Wood bargain hunted and bought more Zoom (ZM) stocks. You should do the same to bargain hunt and buy ZM stocks while ZM is still super cheap. There are a lot of companies like SNOW, PLTR, LMND, NET, AI, TEAM, CRWD, ZS, etc. that are not even able to turn profitable. It is not smart for anyone to be short selling very profitable hyper growth cheap stock ZM when there are many money losing companies like SNOW that are a lot more expensive on the market that are a lot better short targets. You should take the opportunity to buy the best fast growing very profitable Zoom while it is still super cheap right now. If anyone wants to short, one should short money losing companies like SNOW.

Two days ago I advised shorts to buy and cover. I hope some shorts did listen to me to buy and cover. The stock has been going up. Today is up with expanding trading volume. An indication the upward movement may be just starting. Shorts that have not bought and covered yet should buy and cover soon. The recovery may accelerate once this stock breaks out above more trend lines.
I missed out on NFLX. Not making that same mistake with ZM.
"Amazing things are happening! I knew it would go back up a lot more soon and even more very, very soon!!!"
"Right now is the best time of the year to bargain hunt and buy stocks. If you are an experienced stock trader, you would know that September and October market jitters are normal. They actually provide good opportunities for us to buy stocks cheap. It is also normal that once we pass through October, the market usually recovers. And frequently there is a good size rally into the end of the year. That is called Santa Clause rally by traders. Sometimes when a stock drops, it feels scary to buy, but that is actually the best time to buy. Buy low sell high is the way to make money in the stock market. For good growth stocks like ZM, buy and hold can work extremely well for long-term investors. ZM right now is a very cheap growth stock. Investors should buy some right now, and if for any reason it drops even deeper, you can buy even more. If you are empty handed, when it recovers and goes up, you will have nothing to make money with. Buy ZM cheap now and you will be glad you do so when Santa Clause rally comes. Don't be scared by meaningless random low ball numbers shorts post. They mean nothing. They did that to scare you out of this great growth company that is growing very fast with revenues growth rate at 54% and profits growth rate at 70% annually. Zoom is a debt free company with more than $5 billion dollars' worth of cash equivalent in hand. Zoom is a super safe company to own for long term. Just buy ZM and be confident that you are an owner of this great company that brought the world the magic of Zoom Video."

"Investors, this best company Zoom grew revenues by more than 1000% in the past 4 years and Ark Invest still expect best company Zoom to grow another 4 folds in the next 5 years. If I cannot call this a hyper growth company, low life Nathan, show me another hyper growth company that grew more than 1000% in the past 4 years and still expects to grow another 4 folds in the next 5 years. Hyper growth best company Zoom investors, Nathan is just a low life basher that keeps trying to trick you into believing Zoom is a slow growth company when the fact is, Zoom is a hyper growth company. The fact is, zoom is growing at very good and healthy 7% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth rates in 3 months. If you do your own math calculations, with 7% growth rate every 3 months, in 5 years, you will almost quadruple your money. That is totally in sync with Ark Invest's research conclusion that showed hyper growth Zoom will quadruple value in 5 years. 7% growth every 3 months is actually very high growth. And it is even more astonishing that excellent company Zoom had hyper accelerated astonishing 39% quarter-to-quarter hyper profit growth rate in 3 months. That is extremely explosive huge hyper growth rate that can double profits every 8 months in that kind of super hyper growth rate. Of course low life Nathan did not want you to notice that kind of excellent explosive hyper growth rate. And year-over-year, ZM still has hyper 54% annual revenue growth rate and hyper 70% annual profit growth rate. That fits the hyper growth definition of 40% annual growth rate perfectly. Zoom is an excellent company with hyper growth without any doubt.

"Brett, you don't want to short a profitable growth stock like ZM because there are a lot of money losing companies like SNOW, LMND, AI, TEAM, CRWD, ZS, etc. that you can short. They are better short targets than profitable ZM. Profitable ZM is adding value to the company each day because it is adding cash profits to the company coffer each day. Day by day, the company is worth more and more due to the profits. So no matter what the short term stock price is, eventually it will grow out of it and hit new highs. That was exactly what happens to Facebook. Each time Facebook stock got beaten down very low due to a scary bad news, but eventually it always grew out of it and hit new highs. That is the power of profits. Same thing will happen here. No matter what happens to the short-term stock price, this cash cow is making money each day and adding value to the company. Sooner or later the stock will recover and hit new highs. That is the power of profits."
The Southwest Airlines story gives even more reason for the success of ZM. Business travel is horrendous and I think teleconferencing will only benefit from this.

"Roger, $SRNE is an extremely risky stock. It is losing way too much money too fast. And the payables are ballooning. SRNE may not be paying all bills already.

It is better for you to invest in debt free cash rich very profitable company like Zoom (ZM). Zoom has no debt and has $5 billion dollars of cash in hand. And ZM is so profitable that ZM is making $3.5 million dollars of net profits each day. ZM is a super safe company to invest your money.

If Zoom were to be acquired, ZM can be worth as much as $464 if we apply Slack acquisition valuation to ZM.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zoom-founder-ceo-eric-yuan-160500781.html""The Silicon Valley Leadership Group (SVLG) today announced that Eric S. Yuan, Founder and CEO of Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZM), and regional healthcare workers will be recognized with Spirit of Silicon Valley Lifetime Achievement Awards during SVLG's Annual Forum event, presented by Amazon, on October, 29, 2021.""Be on the long side of this hyper growth company with the best CEO will make you a lot more money than on the short side. The market and the stock have both obviously bottomed already. It is time to buy. Don't waste your chance to buy hyper growth stock cheap now. If you miss this opportunity to buy, you will have to buy it even higher as the stock has very obviously bottomed."
"Covid19 is here to stay, new variant after new variant. ZM will thrive stronger.Record covid19 deaths reported in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Baltics, UK, and likely more northernhemisphere nations, as winter has arrived."
"Bob, imagine...people paid $60 after IPO for this hyper growth company. They are up more than 400%. Shorts will never be able to have 400% gains. You have to be on the long side of this hyper growth company to get that kind of gains."
Reading the stories from some payaso estúpido I would think Zoom should be $1000 by now but the truth has been very different. Holding Zoom has been nail-biting
I totally understand why people wants to take profit. $ZM $VENA
I can see FB and Apple duking it out over Zoom.
"Investors, do not be scared by completely meaningless random low ball numbers shorts post. They mean nothing. They did that to scare you out of this great growth company that is growing very fast with revenues growth rate of 54% and profits growth rate of 70% annually. Zoom is a debt free company with more than $5 billion dollars’ worth of cash equivalent in hand. Zoom is a super safe company to own for long term. Just buy ZM and be confident that you are an owner of this great company that brought the world the magic of Zoom Video. You will be rewarded very handsomely with this great company."
"Catherine Wood-ARK Investment Management:We Believe Zoom Is the Fabric Connecting Global Enterprise Communications and the Future of Work.In our view, Zoom is well-positioned to define the future of communications. The way in which companies compete is changing now that video is enabling faster innovation and execution cycles, leading to accelerating sales and business development timelines. Zoom is building the communications fabric supporting this transition, a unique and high-value add position."
"When I saw testimonies all over the place I thought it was all made-up stories till I was convinced and gave it a try and honestly I don't regret the move I made because I invested in a big way. Thanks to Mr Grey Wayne for helping me and my family, you are undoubtedly the best trader we have with sincerity and humbleness, @contact him via Wh**atsApp +1 (863) 345‑7518 with the trading strategy given to me by Mr Greywayne His methods are top notch and profitable and He can be contacted easily on te~le-gram~~greywayne2"
"People listen, full time work 5 days a week at the office is done, over, NOT coming back ever."
"Shorts keep talking about $585 or $588, but those numbers were actually meaningless now. This stock is now $259. It is super cheap now. And that is what matters. Those old numbers have nothing to do with the current bargain stock price. Right now is the best time to bargain hunt and buy super cheap high growth stock ZM."
I am glad that I bought at 52 week low ...
"Nathan, Zoom still has 54% annual revenue growth rate and 70% annual profit growth rate. Per the Hyper Growth definition you provided, it is only for ""Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is greater than 40%"", so Zoom fully qualifies as a hyper growth company! That is the fact, not lie, not misrepresentation! ZOOM IS A HYPER GROWH COMPANY!"
"Investors, let us look at quarterly numbers. Hyper growth company Zoom reported huge 39% earnings growth rate in the most recent quarter. That was astonishing huge growth of 39% in just 3 months. With super hyper growth rate like that, Zoom could double earnings in just 8 months. It shows the super hyper growth trend really well. LOL. It is not a rocket science. LOL."
"New short guy None, it is not smart to be on the short side of this best hyper growth company at the current super cheap price. This is not one year ago stock price anymore. Investors should buy the best hyper growth stock ZM while it is still super cheap. If Zoom were to trade at Snowflake (SNOW) level of valuation, ZM would be trading at more than $1200. If that happens, longs would be up 400%, but shorts would be down 400%. It is obviously better to be on the long side of this excellent hyper growth stock. Best hyper growth company Zoom is growing very fast and trading at very cheap valuation. And Zoom is already profitable. Cathie Wood bargain hunted and bought more Zoom (ZM) stocks. You should do the same to bargain hunt and buy ZM stocks while ZM is still super cheap. There are a lot of companies like SNOW, PLTR, LMND, NET, AI, TEAM, CRWD, ZS, etc. that are not even able to turn profitable. It is not smart for anyone to be short selling very profitable hyper growth cheap stock ZM when there are many money losing companies like SNOW that are a lot more expensive on the market that are a lot better short targets. Investors should take the opportunity to buy the best fast growing very profitable Zoom while it is still super cheap right now. If anyone wants to short, one should short money losing extremely expensive companies like SNOW. Zoom quarterly revenues are 3.75 times larger than SNOW. And even Zoom profits alone are larger than SNOW revenues. But SNOW market cap is $102 billion while ZM market cap is only $82 billion. ZM is a super cheap stock! If we use SNOW valuation to calculate for ZM, ZM would be trading at $380 billion market cap and that translates to a lot more than $1200 stock price for ZM. If shorts want to short stocks, shorting almost four times more expensive money losing company SNOW makes a lot better sense than shorting super cheap great profitable company ZM. Smart investors should take the opportunity to bargain hunt and buy ZM just like Cathie Wood. It is not smart to still be on the short side of this super cheap growth stock. Excellent company Zoom grew revenues by 1000% in the past four years. Zoom has been growing fast way before pandemic. And Zoom will continue to grow after pandemic. Zoom is only starting to get into the $1.4 trillion Enterprise Communication market. There are still many years of growth ahead for this great hyper growth company Zoom. Ark Invest research expects this great growth company to grow another 4 folds in the next 5 years. Right now is the best time to bargain hunt and buy hyper growth ZM."
ZM bottom!
Up trend is good! maybe we can get back to 350+ . $350 seemed low a few months ago... how quickly things change :)
After several days of consolidation at the bottom. ZM is breaking out of the bottom with very strong trading volume. Shorts need to buy and cover NOW! This stock is going back up!
I can’t wait to see 300 again
Massive buying coming Monday. $ZM $WIMI $QS

"When a store has a discount sale, people would rush to buy. But when the stock market has a discount sale, fear causes people to be selling when the correct action should be bargain hunt buying. Buy low sell high is the way to make money. ZM is very cheap now. Investors should bargain hunt and buy ZM. If you are still scared, you can buy a few shares first and if for whatever reason ZM still goes down further, you can then buy some more. If you are completely empty handed, when the market does its usual year end rally, you will have nothing to make money with."
"Jennifer, SNAP was up a lot going into the earnings reports, so it was priced for perfection, so when it was not perfect, stock tanked. Zoom is the opposite. Zoom stock was down a lot for the quarter, so it is priced for disaster, so if the quarterly report is not a disaster, then the stock will jump up big time. Just think of this set up as the opposite of SNAP. That is why I like the ZM set up right now. Buy low sell high. Buy now while it is still cheap. And you will have a merry Christmas."

"Hi! Does anyone know what the long term equity and debt for Zoom Video Communications is? I am a student interested in using this business as a project, and I need a bit of help figuring this out."
"Bargain hunt buying time! If you don't buy during this seasonal market jittery time now, you will have no gift when Santa Clause rally comes in December."
"Sam, I see that you could not even make up your mind. You posted, ""Buy BUY Buy 300.00 by Friday"" just four days ago."" Be patient. Buy and hold ZM. Don't be scared by the jitters. ZM and the entire stock market are in the bottoming process. It is normal for this time of the year. You want to position on the long side, not the short side. Just buy and hold ZM. We will get over the October jitter very soon and get into year end rally. Be patient. Just bargain hunt and buy Zoom while it is still super cheap."

"ZM was up earlier today when the market was up, but the market did not stay up and ZM also followed the market down. September and October jittery is normal. It is best time of the year to bargain hunt and buy stocks. ZM grew revenues by 54% and grew profits by 70% according to the latest quarterly reports, but the stock is at 52 week low, so that tells you when ZM bounces back up eventually, it will have at least 50% to 70% upside to catch up to just simply to match the stock price with its high growth rates. Do not be scared by shorts. This is the best season to bargain hunt and buy good growth stock Zoom."

"Low life Nathan is still more interested in misleading people trying to scare people out of this best hyper growth stock. Hyper growth ZM investors, Nathan is just a low life basher that keeps trying time and time again to trick you into believing Zoom is a slow growth company when the fact is, Zoom is a hyper growth company. The fact is, zoom is growing at very good and healthy 7% quarter-to-quarter revenue growth rates in 3 months. If you do your own calculations, at 7% growth rate every 3 months, in 5 years, you will almost quadruple your money. That is totally in line with Ark Invest's research conclusion that showed Zoom will quadruple value in 5 years. 7% growth every 3 months is actually super high growth. And it is even more astonishing that Zoom had hyper accelerated astonishing 39% quarter-to-quarter hyper profit growth rate in 3 months. That is extremely explosive huge hyper growth rate that can double profits every 8 months in that kind of hyper growth rate. Of course low life Nathan did not want you to notice that kind of excellent explosive growth rate. And year-over-year, ZM still has hyper 54% annual revenue growth rate and hyper 70% annual profit growth rate. That is the full facts for the current condition of hyper growth company Zoom.As for the long term condition, Zoom grew revenues by gigantic 1000% in the past 4 years:https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9d745c5a-e17e-37a4-afc9-fef71902beef/the-numbers-behind-zoom-s.htmlAnd for the future.

"John, you better learn to read financial reports. $PLTR is the one that is dead, not ZM. Zoom (ZM) is still growing revenues at 54% rate and growing profits at hyper 70% rate annually. Zoom is so profitable that Zoom is making $3.5 million dollars of profit each day. Zoom is the real deal. PLTR revenues declined by 22% and PLTR reported huge $138 million dollars of losses last quarter. PLTR is probably not going to make it. PLTR will be dead. You need to sell PLTR to preserve your capital while you still can and buy profitable hyper growth company Zoom (ZM). ZM grew revenues by 1000% in the past 4 years. ZM is the best hyper growth company to own."
