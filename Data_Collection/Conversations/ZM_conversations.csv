Let me know when this hits $100 and I might think about it.
300s tomorrow
"Did Zoom split ? I bought it at $580, oh no !"
"Months ago I thought about investing in zoom, so I asked around who uses it, and was surprised a lot of people use alternatives. Glad I didn't invest."
$300 after hours
Wall Street firms cut their estimate for ZM from $400+ to low of $315. It’s a good buy at $292 now!
Everybody CALM DOWN......Just Give the BAGHOLDERS
always sell before earnings then buy back cheaper when they release earnings
Just impossible to believe that they can keep this down at 291 for this long!! Pure bs manipulation!! It’s impossible!! It has to fill some of the 300-330 gap!!
"I will be adding more. Pandemic has simply been a bonus. ZM was growing at a great clip before March 2020. It is a household and business name that is not going away. If nothing else, It has taught us how to hold meetings, talk to docs, and family members. It is driving efficiency for meetings. Days of flying into the airport and having a meeting are fast coming to an end. Business travel is really not necessary from the traditional standpoint.. ZM will Zoom Zoom for many, many years!!!"
"It will recover half of losses tomorrow, the earnings wasn’t good, but it wasn’t so bad to be crashed 17%, Wall Street market makers manipulation, just hold your horses, and keep buying to average down!"
"Worth $103bb, no thanks, way over valued!"
Record breaking earnings and growth yet down 10%…..makes sense
Just Think BAGS...... It's Not SO BAD.....You Could Be In the ZOOM$400 or $500 BAGHOLDER Club !
Is zoom going to do well on the warnings ?
"Down 42.00 points! And to think, that does not happen to businesses that have a bk. There isn’t any common sense behind the after market drop. Some analysts come out to rationalize in order to protect the market makers so the SEC doesn’t investigate. This was very transparent and I was waiting ;-) .The puts or putz move once again. Hehe"
What many here are forgetting is that Zoom has become a household name. This means that the company has incredible optionality and that their total addressable market may continue to expand drastically as they get into new areas and develop new products/services. Assuming that this company's expansion efforts begins and ends with teleconferencing may be a mistake.
"At what time will Wood announce ARKK is buying more, in hopes of propping it up"
A company with 4-5Billion revenue and 100+Billion market cap is overvalued.
$400 or $ 300 tomorrow?
Beat but still selling off viciously
Looks like 300 strong resistance as not going below 300.
Complete manipulation
They face more and more competition.
I’m new here still looking for an opportunity to earn too
So where were the dip buyers??
"HAHHAHA I SHORTED 345,335,330 HAHHHAA"
call is eating
The reddit guys are now starting to talk-up Zoom in the forums….
No support before $150. No growth at all. Valuations too high.
How can they hold around $291 all day? Is it possible?
"So your 15 months of fame are over. Ever heard of Teams ? It's a Microsoft product, and my team invested heavily into Mister Softie, years ago."
Never buy stocks during earning days!
@TomYou thought the wait for the 280-290 range would take awhile. It took minutes. How low will this go?
At least PE will look nicer
Can we trust Stanley Morgan ?
Is Zoom going back under $80?
"Growth stocks have been getting punished hard for softer guidance/expectations (let alone misses on estimates). $ZM and $PINS = latest examples Given $PCT has no revenue, negative income and won't have output at its first plant until late-2022, what drives the stock price from now until 2023?"
"Earnings were too good, have to dump hard to fix it lolol"
Call sellers cashed in big time today
"Zoom is no longer “The Pandemic Stock” - Zoom is the new way of saving money for large companies!! No more juggling schedules, meeting rooms, coffee, refreshments, lunch, etc!! For you not aware of what’s going on… everyone knows how to Zoom now!! My 94 year old mother-in-law Zooms!! It’s easy! It’s more secure every day! It’s saving companies MILLIONS! It’s no longer pandemic fueled!! The pandemic sped up its adoption, innovation, and BANK ACCOUNT BALANCE BEYOND YOUR IMAGINATION!! The quick adoption of Zoom by necessity made it abundantly clear that not only is productivity not hurt, ITS ENHANCED!! From churches to families to BIG BUSINESSES, it’s only GROWING!! It’s only GETTING BIGGER AND BETTER!! (Full disclosure, bought more at $292 and will buy on any dips further!!)"
300 puts
I think the naysayers are all wrong on this one and I had been waiting for a long time to jump in and today I finally got my opportunity. Even if it dips further I am happy to buy shares at 290.
The guidance was a little mixed. They guided down slightly the adjusted eps but actually guided slightly above the sales estimate. Overdone selling here. The technology is here to stay especially considering the exuberant cost of business travel now.
FAST Money Says........3 SIMPLE WORDS !
Why is this stock called Zoom? Because ---Zoom--- Down 40 bucks a share.
I see a potentially recovery to $325 level tomorrow but sell off was intensified with high volume not the best sign....though there is a bullish convergence on the chart/oscillators so there is also bullish signs as well
buy the dip!!!!!
"Zoom back to $400 in no time. Time to consolidate and wait for earnings, which I’m sure will be amazing, per usual."
Morgan Stanley just upgraded ZM to overweight.This is a fantastic sign before earnings as analysts talk with companies before the earnings release.!
"Counting both free and paying users, Zoom has 300 million daily meeting participants. That's an increase of 2900% since December 31, 2019, when 10 million daily meeting participants logged on. Source: Business 300 soon"
Anyone tell me what is happening?
Will it test $272 once robinhood after market trading is over at 6:00 PM ET? It will I guess!
"Gutten Morgen! How is that 90's repackaged lazy vaporware treating you? This exact tech and implementation has been available for decades. I'm glad everyone has positions, but a moderately talented group of 4 techs can have a competitor up and running in 6 months."
I am thinking  above 300 soon
Zoom still makes a profit and is a household name with 5 billion in cash. A good move by ZM would be to buy back shares at this reduced valuation.
this is the time to buy and shut the computer down. Check in a week and we back up around 360-400
"Outstanding report, huge international growth potential within the next months. This Stock can’t be weighed by next forecast, which is impossible to predicted, according to the CFO Kelly Steckelberg."
Get out. 280
"ZOOM needs a new CFO! She was so uninspiring on CNBC. Great earnings numbers, guidance isn’t whole picture."
Cisco
Back under $250 by end of September
Reminder. Work from home is not for everyone. A small percentage of workforce can do and allow todo but the competitors are plenty. Video conferencing eventually become a commodity. Many videos conferencing are free right now. ZM is trading at very lofty valuations and on the way becomes a no growth company in next couple quarters. With ZM estimate next year earning of $4.50 with no growth would bring down the valuation to any metrics that you want to use ZM would trade around $130. I am giving a pe of 30. Be careful of growth stock when it doesn’t have room to grow
"""buy the dip, hold until it touches the moon."" Jerome powell just sent me this text message. sharing with all my friends "
$400’s a coming…. After earnings and GUIDANCE!!
BAGS NowReducedTo
Anybody with puts? Lol.
Looking at analyst targets and most are above $350 even after adjusting down. This is a no brainer
"Get those homeless meals and blankets ready,this thing will fall down to its IPO price in a year or two."
No support until 250
"Great company, Great product, Great earnings."
"Book value 3.8 Billion USD and market valuation 86 Billion USD or is it in YEN or other currency, perhaps Mexican Pesos?. If it is in USD ...WOW"
I see the drop as a huge buying opportunity. Somebody panicked and went all out. This is a zoom world. Zoooooom.
Get ready for a slight rebound today
Buy it under $300
if it tanks -20% tomorrow I'll buy calls for the bounce.
I’m loving it. Easy short. Easy Peasy money. Big return happening for me.
One trick ponies like zoom and Spotify will be punished heavily in this market after earnings
"Bought some today at $291. Let the rebound climb begin. Remember Stop losses, llet it drop then buy back in later."
Wow ! From Almost $600 Last Year.....To $500.To......$400......To....$300......To......$250 !What A BAGHOLDER Club This Stock Has !
"margin calls need to be answered by this afternoon, maybe it goes to 200 after the forced selling???"
I lost everything had 35k in calls that’s it now I’m poor I also used margin and credit card cash withdrawal can’t believe it.
290 is the first level of support.
"If you can find the post from last sept and oct when this was 500, see how they all thought the party would go on forever."
Do you still think zoom will have as much users during the pandemic and can it still make money after the pandemic?
"bought 1 share of zoom. 2 share at 280, 4 share at 260, 8 shares at 240, you get it..."
$ZOM
"Covid is not going anywhere, the reality is that the delta variant is way more contagious and deadly. People will end up returning to ZM."
WELCOME BAGS ToThePOOR HOUSE !
wonder what tomorrow brings? 30% down or 5% up after earnings
Loaded up. This is a long term bet on productivity.
Major downgrades for $ZM tomorrow
Bought a few at $292…. Hope it will go up before close today
$330 by close tomorrow
"With as many people I know that is struggling for life in ICU with Covid, Zoom is invaluable for attorneys and many businesses. Covid doesn’t appear to be leaving anytime soon. This price is low enough now. I am in!"
Zoom is sort of sputtering!
$ZM is now going to rebound! I knew this will happen! Glad I bought it at $289!!!
does Cathy woods own this stock? she has tendency to stay in some overpriced stocks
SNOW and other balloons are next to burst. nothing deserves 100x valuation.
you can rebalance zoom position. there are many options here that can turn positive.
Was trading halted? Chart for the day just flatlined.
"Remember june 7, 50 point drop in ah and 15point gap ip on open. This will be the same"
This will bounce about 5% from the lows before close today.
Who is making money beside the shorts in this market lately!! 90 percent of these stocks near 52 weeks low.
DATS zooming to a all time highs!!!
The reason this stock fell today had nothing to do with earnings report. Listen to the conference call and management expects earnings growth to dwindle. This company was selling at an unsustainable 100 times earnings. This firm is basically a one trick pony with barrier to entry for competition as not impossible. When Covid19 had many basically staged at home this and exercise machines were really hot. imho--
400 is coming....
No position for the record but not sure why people are eager to pay 75 pe for slowing growth.
Come to $clov heavily shorted 140% yoy growth and just got two patents
"Rishi Jaluria, RBC Capital Markets Software Equity Analyst, predicts a 'long runway for growth' for Zoom after earnings beat."
The M/M accumulating a position. Just buy the dip and hold for a few days. Back up when they choose to ride it up
Because of “the guidance for the third quarter that fell just below expectations”. It will drop to 280-290 ranges.
"Zoom has cash 4.69 billions and will buy shares back, tomorrow. Wait to see."
I see a $310 close as the forecast is conservative and funds that wanted out are done. Value investors starting to come in.
1y Target Est 428.02
when the pandemic ends this will be below $100.
"Cash and Marketable Securities: Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, as of July 31, 2021 was $5.1 billion.Zoom has cash as of July 5.1 billions and will buy back stocks, tomorrow. Zoom Will reverse to green at Regular trading tomorrow. Wait to see."
This is a double bottom and retreated to mid May lows and will bounce back big time.
%90 of you didn't know what zoom is 2 years ago. this fad will go away next year
Ship engines are on. Fasten up your seatbelts boys !
Just wondering how much Cathy Wood lose today.
"Yup....Just averaged up. Remember, this is a global company. It will hover between 425 & 500. Stay long and be proud of your research!!"
Are we still on track for $400?
To buy calls hmm
Had its pandemic pop. Now back down to earth for the long term.
295-300 tommorrow dead cat bounce
IM SURE THIS BE $330 BY THIS EVENING OR END OF WEEK U GOT FIVE9 DONT FORGET
Out with my 1 share.
bank of america just rated as a buy
Loving my $290 9/3 puts!! Bought $500 worth. Bought those today while the stockWas trading up. Can’t wait to see what they open at tomorrow.
One of those stocks which really did well during Covid. Now time to file chapter 11!
Got in for the first time @291
"36% operating margins .. phat!Revenue continues to grow, school year and work remains hybrid into 2022 Zoom is THE app into 22 …. Hot"
Back to around $230 this will go. Just an FYI.
"zoom, zoom, zoom how fast it goes"
$340 by Friday
The 5-Star RBC analyst maintains his Buy on ZM with a $450.00 target price...
Look at how its hovering at 291.3 . Insane fight between BEARS AND BULLS at 291.3 !!!! WOW never seen this before.
All in @290
"Yahoo FinanceZoom beats on top and bottom line, as revenue soars 54%Daniel HowleyDaniel Howley·Technology EditorMon, August 30, 2021, 1:10 PMIn this article:Explore the topics mentioned in this articleView my watchlistsView my watchlistsView my watchlistsView my watchlistsVideo communications giant Zoom (ZM) reported its fiscal Q2 2022 earnings after the bell on Monday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom line.

See the pattern? ARK is adding in increments.
Lesson number 10 NEVER buy into earnings
ARK is buying more in PM
Time to scoop the bottom!!! 
decided to buy a little here.
"people deserve to lose money on this, who in their right mind would pay over 500 a share for this deserves to lose their money"
"Simple: Beat top and bottom BUT, guidance fell below expectations AND, more competition."
I can understand 5-7% drop but 16% cmon!!!!
Buy before the earning report comes out?
ARK INVESTMENT in known to buy high performing stocks at dip and will do so … I see a huge rebound!
Anyone know the numbers ?
"Every time this quarter. If a company doesn’t give very bullish forward guidance, the stock gets hammered."
Monday pre market +60 at least.
Stay strong folks. Zoom is making money and it will continue to. Will be back to 350 in no time!
Support at $270-275 better hold tomorrow. I’m a buyer at this level
"Michael Burry is making lots of money shorting Cathie Wood stocks, one at a time."
shorts will be squeezed.....

New 52-week low later.
it might bounce back tomorrow. don't panic.
Fall under $290 at the open?
why oversold for a game changer stock
"beware of brokerages/analysts trying to bolster zm, they will now try to find ""falling knife"" buyers so their clients can sell as high as possible... time to buy stocks that still haven't recovered since the pandemic started, stocks like ba and travel stocks, these stocks will probably be 100% higher within 12 months"
"ZM is the NFLX of video conferencing. Many more may attempt it, but ZOOM has the name now."
Another meme stock is falling..
"zoom has good numbers , break record 1B... keep thinking covid out of the woodworks, buying the dip at open.. back to 350 by friday, same ol song"
"Yeah compared to revenue and profits and growth curve - the stock price is overpriced, but so is stock price of 999 other companies. Straight up ""Buying Opportunity"" in this crazy market if you ask me."
I heard about ZM the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
WOW !From $588 To $288
"I never liked this stock but ppl are obviously making $$$ swing trading it. As per usual I expect to see it swing back up after this latest dip is finished. The stock has nine lives it seems,lol."
40 shares at $295.
wait. we knocked earnings out the park. right?
ZM UP over $11.00 premarket
Analyst are mostly all still bullish on ZM. Just need to see where this pullback stops. It’s all about taking profits off.
you have to remember not to panic. downside when reporting quarterly results is more common than we would like
The earnings report was great; Covid NOT going away!! LOADING THE BOAT!!!
Hello 290
So the selling pressure seems to be slowing down and appears it has found a new support level around $290
"Now down roughly 13% YTD, shorts and na sayers so far could not bring it down below $300, interesting! If this much commotion is just because they missed guidance by few cents on eps and revenue by few millions and still expect 31% growth rest of the year, and $4B company not to mention recent acquisition to compete against MS team and establish customer center to help 1/2 million customersOut in a $60 B market, hell yes I am a buyer at this low price!"
"Unholy game! Pandemic is not over yet, vaccinated people are also getting ill, delta variants are uprising, more lock downs to follow. Who can predict tomorrow, no one except the God!!"
$400+ tomorrow!!!
Why am I feeling that my 305 puts will expire worthless?
I will try to jump in around $100.
Morgan Stanley analyst nailed it!
"Wait to see reverse to green during Regular trading, watch out !"
WOW !$588 to $288.....That's A LOT Of
50-day moving average 369. Will we hit by Tuesday?
Zoom will reverse to green at Regular trading tomorrow.
"first time I bought zoom on $305;15k. what is the expectations on the next few days, can someone knowledgable on Zoom tell me please?"
I went all in pre earnings at 347 !!!!
This is 100 times overpriced. 1B in revenue with growth that has pretty much came to a halt. If this was half the price it is now it would still be overpriced. Imagine going all in at this price. Someone has lost their mind.
I wonder what Cathie Woods and Tiger Global will do with their position
"The cloud acquisition of Five9 will be accretive to earnings! And Zoom admits they're being conservative with their outlook....However, the Delta variant is more serious than previously thought. Companies are not in a hurry to bring employees back to the office, in fact the paradigm shift of working from home is still very much alive and well. Bottom line, if shorts don't cover now with this gain in AH, then they're even more greedy than those bidding up meme stocks."
"hi ZM longs, what do you prefer, a cremation or a burial ?"
It was fun while the pandemic lasted I guess.
Oky oky dont think it’s going to recover today
delta is fading..
"Thé next following two quarters growth down to 24%, fair valuation is 15xs=60B, which means it’s still overvalued, fair price is 180-200"
I see it dropping to $250 in the not far distance due to valuation and no catalyst any time soon. The next earnings report can’t be better than this
Tomorrow it pops 10% and the day after-10%. Welcome to 21st century trading
ZM growth has slowed but it is still growing!!..be careful if you are shorting
Also we have a huge GAP fill area to fill now and statically about 92% of the time gaps in charts get filled. So this along with the high selling pressure being completely absorbed right now shows very bullish signs for a squeeze up
Wuhan virus gone... it's done.
Omg 50k calls just reduced to 0.0$
Started massive long position today. Let's see!
A 10% drop will leave this stock at 20 rsi. Way lower than anything it has seen in two years.I suggest you to buy.
I will hold this bag
Morgan Stanley is deceitful at best.
"Take a look at ETSY. Dived after earnings August 4, today, higher than before earnings. Buy ZM tomorrow at $300, in a month will be at $350"
RUN 4 the EXIT
loaded calls and common at 290ish thank you
Won’t be surprised to see a reversed pre-market tomorrow
Woods Sheep on the run.
This goes out to everyone who is laughing at people losing money. Not exactly if these are kids on here but it’s not a joke when people lose money. Hope karma comes back to you.
"ZM (this is wayyyyyy over SOLD here, BUYING all I can afford...) & ACRX my top 2 buys. Yahoo Finance PT on ACRX = 600% upside! ACRX 2022 a huge year, read some of the posts out today..."
Hahaha
in at 319
Easy $295 tomorrow. #deadcatbounce
BAGHOLDERS !I See This is ZOOMING......STRAIGHT DOWN !
"Everyone knew the multiple before the print, that isnt why its down. Its down because guidance was probably 5% below what people wanted to see. Stock probably recovers to flat and winds up having less volatility than people think ..."
"When the whole world has gone negative on a stock, time to buy it!"
"Be careful, do not all-in. Might crash after the earnings - concerns about the slow growth."
Results are amazing. First over a 1 billion sales. Seems like lot of fake news being spread.
stock market is the best videogame i've played. more fun than sports gambling these days. you get free trades and can make thousands of dollars in a few minutes. and government throws endless money at it to keep it propped up.

Unbelievable buy opportunity here. Zoom is here to stay. Short term - we are back to lock down mode with travel restrictions between countries. This should go up after the bell.
This stock is so overvalued. The growth story is over and it’s trading at an insane price to earnings.
Buy the dip!!!
I backed up the truck. Thanks for the cheap shares!
How about buying a vertical short credit spread on ZOOM (305/310) before earnings. What's your opinion?
What happens if there is a market correction? What happens when tapering starts later this year?
so whens the buy point
Loads of pre-market buys! 2.8%
Good time to add now. Got a nice $42 discount :))
Who is still holding at 588?
Zoom’s ticker changed to Doom.
That's it I'm don placing zm calls.
I bought at $425 based on Cramer's recommendations. When can I expect my money back.
Sold @355 and bought back @348. Will hold until earnings
Now its gonna real journey start 290 to 500.. hold it for long term
25 x sales for a group chat app which is available with many other plateforms is unbelievably expensive. Still way to go down.
BAGS.......For The Next ZOOM MeetingBe Sure AndDRESS Properly !
Looks like we will be able to have some fun going in to earnings 
Highly speculative guess for tomorrow trading range: 283 - 292.....
"Are Zoom customers switching to SFOR, the tiny company claims to have the best video conferencing security?"
What I'm noticing today is crazy high volume. We are talking 1000% more than the average of the last 30 days. Selling pressure is high but it's being completely absorbed by buyers and stock is holding very steady. This is a sign that sellers will be exhausted and it will likely squeeze and run up once it does a break out of this price range.
Chance of getting to $400 which is 60 points away ???
"Not sure why this is down so much after hours. 54% YoY growth seems pretty good to me. Yes, it may not be at the level it was last year, but if the company can continue to grow by at least 35% a year (on average) for the next 5 years, that translates into nearly $18B in revenue annually. That's no good?"
Delta cases will increase in Q4 and this will skyrocket again. buy the dip.
Consolidating at 314 and it's on sale now!!! Tomorrow will gap up by 320
Zoom Has Gotten InTheTIMMMMMMMMBER Business !
im in at 292
"Never, ever buy communist stocks. Hope y’all learned."
I think ZM will be pumped tomorrow and go up and then dive after hours
Let's wait and see
"Video communications provider with no customer lock-in, no technology advantage and competitors that offer the same service for free (MS Teams) no longer growing after once-in-a-lifetime pandemic comes to an end. I'm shocked."
"I think this is hysterical. Do you guys know what ZOOM does? LOL....some of you guys make it sound like the future is everyone doing business while touching noses...yeah, thats what every business wants...they want to send people out on the road with expense accounts, in cars, on planes, in hotels, as if all that comes for free......and sitting in an office and accomplishing all that while never getting out of the chair is bad....spending money...good......saving time and money...bad. A lot of you guys are so smart that you're gonna have a lot to discuss in your AA meetings...omg you cant make this spit up."
I initiated a Sept call spread today. My gamble is that we see a little pop before close or possibly tomorrow.
OMG I pointed out yesterday to get out while you could.Now you have a bigger loss.
Any guesses on how high the $300 puts open at this morning?I have 20 $290 puts expiring 9/3. Debating cashing out at the open. Thoughts?
It will go below $300 in the morning
$348 then a nose dive! should have taken some profits LOL. Gonna stay strong and hold for tomorrow
"Zoom may be overpriced, but so are 999 other companies. It's a company providing solid service, making money and growing. Markets will have no choice but return to Zoom because bonds give nothing, and other high flyers are already high. I'm buying here."
"Thank GS for the drop they are the ones shorting ZM, GS told everyone to buy ZM before earnings because they wanted to pump the stock to make money when they shorted"
"Since a few of you asked how I could be up total portfolio today of over 1% while taking a beating in ZM (and buying more ZM this morning!!) - my 4 losers today were #ZM #AAPL #COIN and #ME - my winners were #SDC #LL #HOTH #CNK #BABA #F #PRVB #VAL #GE #DAL #DD #MRNA and #DEN Ironically, I like, most of the time, to keep the PEG around 1… last week I was almost all in and needed to free up some cash, so I sold all the stocks outside of near 1 PEG or below… EXCEPT ZOOM! Oh well, I’m still a believer at these levels!!"
"Go ask your friends and family how much they use zoom. I did, and came up with zero. Do your DD."
Hard to maintain an excessive price/earnings multiple when your growth is slowing to zero.
IS THERE ANY CHANCE ZM WILL GO BACK ABOE 296 EVER AGAIN !??!?
Great earnings. Tomorrow will be +5%. Mark my words.
"instead of buying high go buy $ZM while it's low. Could it sell off more? yes but I'm seeing a lot of bullish signs. We have a big GAP fill, statsically 92% of gaps on charts get filled but more importantly volume is very high selling pressure is intense yet it is getting completely absorbed by buyers and price is very steady still yet. Once sellers are exhausted price is likely to squeeze up"
I love the price !!
I was hoping for this reaction to what I felt would be great numbers!! I’m so glad I waited!! I will be doubling up tomorrow and on any other big dips!! Hopefully the shorts will come out in full force for great buying in morning!! Keeping cash for the many over reactions during this volatile time!!
"PE 100, this means 100 years with these gains to double the book value , right?"
I've never used zoom.
Kids and colleges will be back doing virtual school just wait you’ll see
Time to jump back in long.
I'm not gonna be able to walk tomorrow...
Zoom is here for good. Remote will never go away as companies fixed costs and lease expenses will decline. Pandemic showed much to company exec’s …. Cost containment!!!
"Panic selling as I can see and people take profit on earning, I see this as a healthy correction. There are new variations identified that more powerful than Delta and many organisations have already adapted new way of working. It might slow down but the fundamentals of Zoom is there. This is indeed the best time to scoop the bottom as it reached the technical support level."
I'm guessing that ZM will pop a little from these levels before close. ETFs like ARKK will probably pick up shares.
ARKK going to feel this one. Just wait until TSLA tanks again
ZOOM has a market cap of over 103 Billion. 10 years of growth already priced into the stock.
"Marketwatch's report ""Zoom Video earnings: Expectations may be coming back to earth"" shows that there is potential up side. Monday evening will be one to watch!"
This is a good report. What is wrong? Is this a buying opportunity?
"Holy, I’ve never seen a stock so flat before LOL"
Upgrade Morgan Stanley: Equal-Weight to Overweight 8/26/2021
"Zoom was down to 272 during the last mini market correction earlier this year when the company's growth trend was still intact, the bull market widely expected to continue, inflation still low, Covid cases trending downward and Fed tapering just a remote possibility. What's going to happen in the next market correction?"
"Wow, congrats to those who bought Puts beforehand...."
"Globe x data is coming out with a zoom 2.0 more private and sekur, will be interesting to see what happens."
I have a buy order in for 4500 shares at $135 a share. I think it will fill within the next 3 weeks.
Gonna stay strong and hold until Tuesday !
I don't understand?? The guy on CNBC (Josh) said that at $380 this stock was a strong BUY! LOL... you guys will believe anything.
"look like PTON couple days ago, boost before earnings... than .."
Buy the deep dip! Could hit $310 tomorrow.
zoom on sale. buy zoom zoom baby.
The thing that went up so quick has to come down quick
That escalated quickly. Hopefully recovers quickly
"How does Zoom's pricing compare with Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and WebEx? Do all four have a free model and then a subscription tier? Which video conferencing program has the most users right now? Can Zoom possible make money on ads in the future?"
longs…what price you buying more? 
"So the company is losing 16% of its market cap today because: For the current quarter ending in October, Zoom forecast revenue in a range of $1.015 billion to $1.02 billion vs. analyst estimates of $1.02 billion. Zoom said it expects adjusted per-share earnings of about $1.07 at the midpoint of its guidance vs. estimates of $1.10.$5M spread in revenue of over a $billion and 3 cents a share spread in $1+ EPS. Market is irrational and crazy but not this much. This stock will be back in mid 300s by the end of next week."
DOCU is next when they report earnings in a couple of days. The problem is that everyone has focused on year over year growth of these covid stocks and ignored the fact that quarterly growth has been slowing. Michael Burry called this one. ARKK holds both ZM and DOCU.
"""Slowing growth"". The death phrase for growth stocks"
"Weird Day! ZM original holdings down 16%, yet only 4 of my 17 stocks down today??!! Total portfolio up 1.1%! I’ll never figure this thing out but it sure is fun trying! Would have been up 1.6% if I didn’t own ZM!! I did double up though on ZM long while the rest of you ran for cover… see you on Zoom!!"
Shorties covering up… it’s oversold!!! 
"If TMVWY has been having trouble for the last three quarters, it was bound to happen to ZM....they just cooked the books a little longer.....going back to $80 pre-COVID price. Back to 2019 stock market prices everyone...that is what NORMAL looks like!! The longer you deny that the more $$$$$ you will lose."
$ZM Zoom meetings fall after Pfizer gets Covid19 FDA approval $PFE
Amateur traders listen and react to FUDers. Buy lows and wait as high performing companies do respond quickly! Zoom could have hide slow growth news from public but they are more transparent to investors. If they keep $1B revenue on quarterly basis … we are good! They should either buy back or announce dividends!
Value always returns. ZM has been overvalued for a long time now. That should be no secret.Problem is that it will likely over-correct before it finds a fair number...
"a tangible design or code set that moves into the next phase of a products lifecycle. using zoom in the application development and delivery. using zoom for engineers to design their vehicles, smartphones... zoom is not just for business meetings !!!"
I’m a buyer under $300
"zoom will bounce back from this after market sell off. they still had good numbers. I think the focus on UCaas and put a little more focus promoting their platform value for engineering and software A/V collaboration. meetings are great, but using zoom to produce a product makes money"
Market loves to over react
Will this end green (thumbs up) or red (thumbs down) today?
Wall Street firms cut their estimate for ZM from $400+ to low of $315. Will trade somewhere $250 to $300 till next ER.
