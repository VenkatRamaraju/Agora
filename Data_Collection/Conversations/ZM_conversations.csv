"""buy the dip, hold until it touches the moon."" Jerome powell just sent me this text message. sharing with all my friends "
$348 then a nose dive! should have taken some profits LOL. Gonna stay strong and hold for tomorrow
This is 100 times overpriced. 1B in revenue with growth that has pretty much came to a halt. If this was half the price it is now it would still be overpriced. Imagine going all in at this price. Someone has lost their mind.
you have to remember not to panic. downside when reporting quarterly results is more common than we would like
ZM growth has slowed but it is still growing!!..be careful if you are shorting
DOCU is next when they report earnings in a couple of days. The problem is that everyone has focused on year over year growth of these covid stocks and ignored the fact that quarterly growth has been slowing. Michael Burry called this one. ARKK holds both ZM and DOCU.

"Not sure why this is down so much after hours. 54% YoY growth seems pretty good to me. Yes, it may not be at the level it was last year, but if the company can continue to grow by at least 35% a year (on average) for the next 5 years, that translates into nearly $18B in revenue annually. That's no good?"
Will this end green (thumbs up) or red (thumbs down) today?
Omg 50k calls just reduced to 0.0$
"At what time will Wood announce ARKK is buying more, in hopes of propping it up"
I’m a buyer under $300
At least PE will look nicer
Chance of getting to $400 which is 60 points away ???
"Remember june 7, 50 point drop in ah and 15point gap ip on open. This will be the same"
wait. we knocked earnings out the park. right?
SNOW and other balloons are next to burst. nothing deserves 100x valuation.
"Everyone knew the multiple before the print, that isnt why its down. Its down because guidance was probably 5% below what people wanted to see. Stock probably recovers to flat and winds up having less volatility than people think ..."
This goes out to everyone who is laughing at people losing money. Not exactly if these are kids on here but it’s not a joke when people lose money. Hope karma comes back to you.
$330 by close tomorrow
I went all in pre earnings at 347 !!!!
"Be careful, do not all-in. Might crash after the earnings - concerns about the slow growth."
always sell before earnings then buy back cheaper when they release earnings

Why is this stock called Zoom? Because ---Zoom--- Down 40 bucks a share.
I see a potentially recovery to $325 level tomorrow but sell off was intensified with high volume not the best sign....though there is a bullish convergence on the chart/oscillators so there is also bullish signs as well
ARKK going to feel this one. Just wait until TSLA tanks again
Support at $270-275 better hold tomorrow. I’m a buyer at this level
I have a buy order in for 4500 shares at $135 a share. I think it will fill within the next 3 weeks.
Who is making money beside the shorts in this market lately!! 90 percent of these stocks near 52 weeks low.
"Wow, congrats to those who bought Puts beforehand...."
"Outstanding report, huge international growth potential within the next months. This Stock can’t be weighed by next forecast, which is impossible to predicted, according to the CFO Kelly Steckelberg."
This is a good report. What is wrong? Is this a buying opportunity?
"Zoom has cash 4.69 billions and will buy shares back, tomorrow. Wait to see."
They face more and more competition.
Record breaking earnings and growth yet down 10%…..makes sense
Results are amazing. First over a 1 billion sales. Seems like lot of fake news being spread.
"look like PTON couple days ago, boost before earnings... than .."
Loving my $290 9/3 puts!! Bought $500 worth. Bought those today while the stockWas trading up. Can’t wait to see what they open at tomorrow.
I see the drop as a huge buying opportunity. Somebody panicked and went all out. This is a zoom world. Zoooooom.
That's it I'm don placing zm calls.
Never buy stocks during earning days!
Morgan Stanley analyst nailed it!
I was hoping for this reaction to what I felt would be great numbers!! I’m so glad I waited!! I will be doubling up tomorrow and on any other big dips!! Hopefully the shorts will come out in full force for great buying in morning!! Keeping cash for the many over reactions during this volatile time!!
it might bounce back tomorrow. don't panic.
"Simple: Beat top and bottom BUT, guidance fell below expectations AND, more competition."
What happens if there is a market correction? What happens when tapering starts later this year?
Major downgrades for $ZM tomorrow
I love the price !!
Value always returns. ZM has been overvalued for a long time now. That should be no secret.Problem is that it will likely over-correct before it finds a fair number...
"Globe x data is coming out with a zoom 2.0 more private and sekur, will be interesting to see what happens."
