"Don't waste great opportunity to buy hyper growth excellent company Zoom. According to the best CEO, Zoom just started:https://finance.yahoo.com/video/zoom-ceo-eric-yuan-joins-211053585.htmlZoom (ZM) is actually the most amazing hyper growth great company of our time. ZM grew revenues by 1000% in the past 4 years. We got so used to using Zoom during pandemic, so we actually did not even realize Zoom was actually designed for Enterprise work purpose. Zoom's huge successful is really all due to the customer focus philosophy. Zoom did not even care about competitors. ""What if the competitors are building something not right?"" That pretty much sums up the reason Zoom had such a huge success. Zoom simply looked into the needs of customers and built the best Video Conference software from the ground up and took over the Video Conference market. And the best company Zoom is not done with its hyper growth yet. The great CEO actually said Zoom just started. There are still a lot of growths ahead for Zoom. DocuSign with Zoom. Playing games with Zoom. Augmented reality, virtual reality, metaverse, etc. There are still a lot of future growths at work ahead for this excellent hyper growth company. And what is super interesting is that when asked about competitions from Microsoft and Google, Zoom CEO actually talked about partnerships with Microsoft and Google instead. Humm... That is super interesting. Do you smell merger and acquisition by Microsoft and Google? Buy ZM while it is still super cheap now."

"Investors, this best company Zoom grew revenues by more than 1000% in the past 4 years and Ark Invest still expect best company Zoom to grow another 4 folds in the next 5 years. If I cannot call this a hyper growth company, low life Nathan, show me another hyper growth company that grew more than 1000% in the past 4 years and still expects to grow another 4 folds in the next 5 years. Hyper growth best company Zoom investors, Nathan is just a low life basher that keeps trying to trick you into believing Zoom is a slow growth company when the fact is, Zoom is a hyper growth company.

If you do your own math calculations, with 7% growth rate every 3 months, in 5 years, you will almost quadruple your money. That is totally in sync with Ark Invest's research conclusion that showed hyper growth Zoom will quadruple value in 5 years. 7% growth every 3 months is actually very high growth. And it is even more astonishing that excellent company Zoom had hyper accelerated astonishing 39% quarter-to-quarter hyper profit growth rate in 3 months. That is extremely explosive huge hyper growth rate that can double profits every 8 months in that kind of super hyper growth rate. Of course low life Nathan did not want you to notice that kind of excellent explosive hyper growth rate. And year-over-year, ZM still has hyper 54% annual revenue growth rate and hyper 70% annual profit growth rate. That fits the hyper growth definition of 40% annual growth rate perfectly. Zoom is an excellent company with hyper growth without any doubt. That is the full facts for the current condition of hyper growth company Zoom.As for the long term condition, Zoom grew revenues by gigantic 1000% in the past 4 years:https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9d745c5a-e17e-37a4-afc9-fef71902beef/the-numbers-behind-zoom-s.htmlAnd for the future. Zoom is still expected to have huge growth:https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/zoom-the-future-of-work/""Zoom's enterprise value would nearly quadruple from approximately $76 billion dollars today to $280 billion by 2026""That is another 4 folds of great growth expected for the next 5 years by Ark Invest.

"Excellent hyper growth company Zoom CEO is the best! He will be awarded today by SVLG. But what is most interesting is that will be presented by Amazon. That makes me wonder is Amazon trying to cozy up to Zoom and has its acquisition target on Zoom? Zoom would actually be a real good acquisition for Amazon. Many Amazon products can be greatly enhanced by Zoom. If Zoom were to be acquired, ZM can be worth as much as $464 if we apply Slack acquisition valuation to ZM.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zoom-founder-ceo-eric-yuan-160500781.html""The Silicon Valley Leadership Group (SVLG) today announced that Eric S. Yuan, Founder and CEO of Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZM), and regional healthcare workers will be recognized with Spirit of Silicon Valley Lifetime Achievement Awards during SVLG's Annual Forum event, presented by Amazon, on October, 29, 2021."""
"Investors, don't mind shorts. Buy the best hyper growth stock ZM while it is still super cheap. If Zoom were to trade at Snowflake (SNOW) level of valuation, ZM would be trading at more than $1200. If that happens, longs would be up 400%, but shorts would be down 400%. It is obviously better to be on the long side of this excellent hyper growth stock. Best hyper growth company Zoom is growing very fast and trading at very cheap valuation. And Zoom is already profitable. Cathie Wood bargain hunted and bought more Zoom (ZM) stocks. You should do the same to bargain hunt and buy ZM stocks while ZM is still super cheap. There are a lot of companies like SNOW, PLTR, LMND, NET, AI, TEAM, CRWD, ZS, etc. that are not even able to turn profitable. It is not smart for anyone to be short selling very profitable hyper growth cheap stock ZM when there are many money losing companies like SNOW that are a lot more expensive on the market that are a lot better short targets. Investors should take the opportunity to buy the best fast growing very profitable Zoom while it is still super cheap right now. If anyone wants to short, one should short money losing companies like SNOW. Zoom quarterly revenues are 3.75 times larger than SNOW. And even Zoom profits alone are larger than SNOW revenues. But SNOW market cap is $102 billion while ZM market cap is only $82 billion. ZM is a super cheap stock! If we use SNOW valuation to calculate for ZM, ZM would be trading at $380 billion market cap and that translates to a lot more than $1200 stock price for ZM. If shorts want to short stocks, shorting almost four times more expensive money losing company SNOW makes a lot better sense than shorting super cheap great profitable company ZM. Smart investors should take the opportunity to bargain hunt and buy ZM just like Cathie Wood. It is not smart to still be on the short side of this super cheap growth stock. Excellent company Zoom grew revenues by 1000% in the past four years. Zoom has been growing fast way before pandemic. And Zoom will continue to grow after pandemic. Zoom is only starting to get into the $1.4 trillion Enterprise Communication market. There are still many years of growth ahead for this great hyper growth company Zoom. Ark Invest research expects this great growth company to grow another 4 folds in the next 5 years. Buy ZM while it is still super cheap. Anyone still shorting this very profitable hyper growth stock ZM when there are obviously many other money losing companies like SNOW that are better short targets is just not very smart. Buy ZM. Sell SNOW if you want."
"Nico, best hyper growth company ZM is already very cheap. If the quarterly report is somewhat decent, this stock will rocket up big time.

"Nathan, Zoom still has 54% annual revenue growth rate and 70% annual profit growth rate. Per the Hyper Growth definition you provided, it is only for ""Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is greater than 40%"", so Zoom fully qualifies as a hyper growth company! That is the fact, not lie, not misrepresentation! ZOOM IS A HYPER GROWH COMPANY!"
Reading the stories from some payaso estúpido I would think Zoom should be $1000 by now but the truth has been very different. Holding Zoom has been nail-biting
"OK, let us look into why other tech giants may want to buy hyper growth great company Zoom. Let us start from Zoom fundamentals:Zoom is already making $1 billion dollars of revenues a quarter.Zoom is already making $317 million dollars of net profits a quarter.Zoom is debt free.Zoom has $5 billion dollars of cash in hand.For AMZN, Zoom will add great video communication capability to its Alexa and robots.For Apple and Google, this is probably the best fit for Apple and Google to add great Video Communication app to its native apps.For Microsoft and Google, acquiring Zoom will take out a prime competitor and make them almost monopoly in Video Conference market.For Salesforce, Zoom will add great video communication capability to its customer relationship software. It is a perfect match and great addition for its capability.In short, there is not many debt free cash rich profitable hyper growth company on the market that tech giants can acquire. I actually cannot think of any other company as good as Zoom as an acquisition target. Think about it this way. Buy out Zoom and get $5 billion cash infusion instantly. Gosh, Salesforce would be silly not to try to buy ZM. Slack was losing money when Salesforce bought Slack. Debt free cash rich profitable Zoom is way better. If we use Slack buyout valuation to calculate, ZM buyout would be worth at least $464. That is the minimum value Zoom is worth in acquisition situation."
I can see FB and Apple duking it out over Zoom.

"Just comparing Snap vs Zoom, Zoom should have 110ish market cap, actually 120ish as they are profitable + keep beating revenue and profit estimates. Best is yet to come for ZM!!!"
"LOL. Anonymous, don't tell me you are still on the short side of this best hyper growth company stock. You need to buy and cover your short, dude. J.P.

"The spammers are spamming dooms and glooms daily, but the economy and the market are actually both still very healthy. So don't mind the spammers' daily junk messages. Just focus on what is ahead for this hyper growth company. This hyper growth company stock came down 20% since the last earnings report already. But I don't believe the business of this hyper growth company has declined 20% this quarter at all. If you listen to the Yahoo interview of the CEO:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zoom-ceo-on-pandemic-era-use-cases-that-surprised-us-most-132301770.htmlI simply did not hear any caution at all. The quarter is almost ending. If the quarter is really as bad as the stock indicated, he would have given out a more cautious tone. But this is what I heard from the CEO:""There are so many great opportunities ahead of us.""""We just started.""""I think a huge opportunity is ahead of us.""Do they sound anything like this company is in trouble at all? Absolutely not. Just like Facebook, I believe we are only at the very beginning of this hyper growth company. We still have many years of growth left for this great company! Buy ZM and make money. Pick up hyper growth stock ZM while it is still cheap. Thank me when Santa Claus rally comes."
Snap is worth more than Zoom? snap is not even profitable. what gives?

I hope some of you did listened to me to bargain hunt and buy this hyper growth stock. The potential for this hyper growth company is huge! We are only at the very beginning of the growth of this great hyper growth tech company! There are still many many years of growth for this hyper growth company.
"Zoom is just starting. According to Zoom CEO:https://finance.yahoo.com/video/zoom-ceo-future-growth-plans-210619830.htmlZoom is a huge success hyper growth company that grew revenues by 1000% in the past 4 years. And yet the CEO is very down to earth. Very smart CEO. Instead of focusing on competitors, he focuses on customers. “What if the competitors are building something not right?” That pretty much sums up why Zoom had such a huge success. Zoom did not even care about competitors' products. Zoom simply built the best Video Conference product from the ground up and took over the market. And it is very interesting that when asked about competitions from Microsoft and Google, he actually talked about the cooperation with Microsoft and Google. Humm... that was super interesting! Do you smell merger and acquisition by Microsoft and Google?...."
"The trend is really good for Zoom:https://finance.yahoo.com/m/374f159a-5550-3b8a-beec-79c023008a6b/why-are-people-quitting-their.htmlMore and more people chose to work from home. Hybrid work and work from home are here to stay. And Zoom is the one that helps people to have the better work life balance. Buy ZM, the great hyper growth company that grew revenues by 1000% in the past 4 years!"
"Jennifer, SNAP was up a lot going into the earnings reports, so it was priced for perfection, so when it was not perfect, stock tanked. Zoom is the opposite. Zoom stock was down a lot for the quarter, so it is priced for disaster, so if the quarterly report is not a disaster, then the stock will jump up big time. Just think of this set up as the opposite of SNAP. That is why I like the ZM set up right now. Buy low sell high. Buy now while it is still cheap. And you will have a merry Christmas."

"Investors, let us look at quarterly numbers. Hyper growth company Zoom reported huge 39% earnings growth rate in the most recent quarter. That was astonishing huge growth of 39% in just 3 months. With super hyper growth rate like that, Zoom could double earnings in just 8 months. It shows the super hyper growth trend really well. LOL. It is not a rocket science. LOL."
"Roger, $SRNE is an extremely risky stock. It is losing way too much money too fast. And the payables are ballooning. SRNE may not be paying all bills already. SRNE may have financial difficulty already. And the net tangible assets are already negative! You actually own NOTHING in SRNE. SRNE has huge risk of going out of business. It is better for you to invest in debt free cash rich very profitable company like Zoom (ZM). Zoom has no debt and has $5 billion dollars of cash in hand. And ZM is so profitable that ZM is making $3.5 million dollars of net profits each day. ZM is a super safe company to invest your money.

It is better to sell SRNE while you still can and buy ZM to invest in the debt free cash rich profitable hyper growth company Zoom safely."
