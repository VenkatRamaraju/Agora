Short interest continues to rise driving the stock price down. As of 3/15 short rose by 320K shares to 2.67M shares short. I am sure more has happened in the last few days. Should be nice pop when all those playing the game cover.
What does this news mean? Appian taking on more debt?
"Either APPN is being acquired and someone with a lot of money has the inside track, or APPN is now the biggest bubble on Wall street besides EV stocks."
How can this be down when the market is UP???
Wow! Up today more than I originally paid for it. Congrats to longs!
Slack was up +37% after article in WSJ Wednesday about possible buyout by Salesforce. This could explain move in APPN as near-term buyout scenario by MSFT or other cloud leader? Only plausible (not realistic) reason for hyperbolic spike in share price. Sell the rumor IMHO. $150 will trade next week. Holiday fake news / rumors.
"$300 Million revenues - $12 Billion market cap. Not logical, what am I overlooking here, even if 100% annual revenue growth?"
"I'm out! Maybe it'll go higher but I can't justify the valuation plus the faster it goes up, the faster it goes down."
i just took a look at the estimates. it is selling for 47 times next years sales est and the company is still losing money. probably not a candidate for a takeover. saw the name getting touted on Wallstreetbets. surprised they are not raising money at these prices.......
"APPN is way, way over valued. It was due for a dose of reality. Needham has been 'pumping' APPN and other tech stocks with little realistic basis to do so."
"Drop! Drop! Drop!Ok I give you the most honest research.The APPN is stronger than TSLA, but the rapid rally is too tired.The high volume means this is very dangerous.And you will be the Dim Sum of big brother.The peak has seen in short term already.The APPN will go lower and lower.It may drop like flash to $96.And then we could buy again.Sell Sell Sell immediately."
"Wow! just listened to CC, and it was amazing! Been waiting for a while for APPN to pay off, and she just did. Going to be adding to position, even at all time highs, the short and long term future looks spectacular!"
"APPN has made really good growth in the past couple years. Great financial statement. They’re killing their EPS. I think APPN has very great potential to be a 200+ stock. We use it in our office and people love it, that’s how I actually found out about it. Software is the future. They also do many great stuff. Company growth is a important because it leads to expansion specially when a company has a great business & financial statement like APPN. Buy & HOLD. Thank me later."
Anyone buying today?
This is buy APPN
Glad that I held onto my shares. It is going to go much higher!
too far too fast had to sell as I doubled
I’m in the this stock as well but #cydy will be amazing and has the greatest drug around. Watch for a huge boom on Monday. Do your research And decide for yourself.
"Have been following APPN for a while, finally bought in on the dip tdy. IMO APPN has the potential to be a multi bagger. I really like THEIR business model and their management are very experienced and strong.. I'm bullish, buy and hold and forgot about them this could turn out to be the best investment you'll ever make. DYOR."
This was a screaming buy @ $20. Long term holders will reap long term benefits. Great company.
I’m excited that I finally got into something early enough to see some serious future potential. How do you calculate value on the future of something like appn?
"I'm thinking maybe traders are thinking that since APPN competes with WORK to some degree, and WORK is being acquired by CRM, therefore this is a me too trade? Or the short interest was so high, the shorts are getting totally destroyed. I guess we'll find out soon."
Appian reporting after the close on the second......consensus is -$.21 and rev at $59.6 mil....
Im planning on buying in when we dip back down again. 23-25 area. This correction is not over yet. Just being cautious.
Borrowing rate on securities lended went from 49% to 68%. This is uncharted territory for me as I've never seen a rate this high
"It turns out APPN stock, is exactly who I thought it was! Congrats longs!"
every time you sell your share I will buy them remember that.
"I’ve checked the chart carefully, noticed every initial spike of the day had volume, then low volume throughout, big sell volume on the recent previous high. To me it feels like some institution has been taking advantage of this stock. I think major correction is not far"
"Well, loaned securities rate just went to 99% :-)"
Don't you love it when you find that easy $100k stock and you have to wait until your funds clear cause you just deposited them in your brokerage cause you want to buy options. ARGHHHHHHH!
Guidance of $298M of rev for year. That is 14% yoy and loss of $39M. There is no way this justifies a $4B valuation. I would be shocked if this doesn’t take a serious hit. GLTA
Boom! About time APPN delivered happy for all the longs that have stuck with APPN. Next 6months are going to be very interesting.
WOW...$3.5B market cap on a little over $250m in revenue. We need to turn to profit within 2 quarters.
Quarterly Price Performance Plummeted by 225.78%: Appian Corporation (NASDAQ:APPN)Goldman rated the Appian Corporation (NASDAQ: APPN) stock “a Neutral” and gave the company’s common stock a price target of $84. Goldman’s estimates were contained in a research note.
"9 Wall Street analysts have issued ratings and price targets for Appian in the last 12 months. Their average twelve-month price target is $65.22, predicting that the stock has a possible downside of 52.13%. The high price target for APPN is $95.00 and the low price target for APPN is $40.00. There are currently 2 sell ratings, 5 hold ratings and 2 buy ratings for the stock, resulting in a consensus rating of ""Hold."""
"One year target after the recent earnings is under $80. Now it is $140, people continue to flock in simply because it had a big drop today? Think again!"
"This is fun to watch, do you guys think it will hold above $50? I know their revenues were great but didn't they still report a loss on the quarter?"
"APPN, by all rights should fetch about $45-70 a share. Way over valued. However it's followers are huge buy on the dip folks, so I expect it will live to rise again."
Is this good buy??
This stock will fall 50 points come tuesday or a few days after. It has to if this is a real healthy rise.
"Valuation is similar to SHOP (a little better maybe) but at 1/10th the size - likely some pullbacks along the way but now being priced like a real growth story.Subscription revenues had surprising growth in Q3 despite COVID - these now make up 2/3 of revenue, are recurring, and come with significantly higher margins (look how much margins jumped just this quarter). It’s like being a different company than selling services as previous. Also on the cusp of profitability..."
This is going down because Abdiel is trimming the position likely to balance the portfolio. This will pop up again in few more days.
"Like I said, APPN will never go under $100. Screaming buy now and $200 by this summer"
Loving this big move on high volume ! Anyone know why ?
.30 swings on 7K shares show trading is thin and Winter Is Coming (haha) IE. Earnings on May 2. Only 8 trading sessions left to cover and expect the usual run up before earnings as shorts have continued to grow holding the price down.
Finally almost back to even with this stock... hope it keeps going
my only tech stock in the green
I feel like Appian will be the software solution for millions of users from many branches of business and education. This growth will be exponential. I'm very excited for what's to come!
I think the rise is attributed to the anticipation that APPN is a takeover target.
buying opportunity
Congrats to anyone who stuck it out long on $APPN. Been in since $34.
"We probably hit all year highs next week of $43+ the way APPN is performing, upward trend is very positive. Next earnings will be very interesting. Matt Culkins is the brains and one of the co founders behind APPN.. He has plenty skin in the game as long as he's at the helm APPN is in safe hands and it's only just getting started. Gl all."
BAILLIE GIFFORD firm owns about 6 million shares . let's keep an eye on them as well. is this something your investors can stomach at this price? what ?game are you playing?
Had to wait so long for Appian and stock was really acting weird. Sold at 60 :(Congrats to all the longs
BidaskClub upgraded shares of Appian (NASDAQ:APPN) from a buy rating to a strong-buy rating in a report published on Saturday morning.
If aftermarket fall holds I'm in tmrw
This will never fail. Stock Advisor is always pushing this company.
What’s going on today
Shorting here. RSI is too high.
9 billion market cap will hit 100 billion in 5 years. 11x 130 = 1430
going over $40
"i have a tiny short position in this stock. i follow the company closely and cannot believe the valuation given the company's fundamentals. i saw it get hyped on cnbc and saw some hypsters on robinhood jamming it as well. i don't believe the company has anything special and they certainly have not been good at making money. the quality of the holders in this stock is questionable and one certainly has to ask if there has been some manipulation of the short side? in any event, this stock will peak and has a long way to come down. I would estimate that fair value is maybe $30 on a good day. i respect the market and that's why my position is tiny and i am willing to lose 100% however I am short at higher prices and not too concerned TODAY. take it up and see what's around if you like, but eventually clearer heads will prevail. As for any real firms that own this and got lucky, take some profits before the bottom falls out!"
All time highs coming soon! Stay long and strong
1000+ dollar stock in 5years.
Beginning of recessions these type stocks suffer bigtime. I wouldn't touch this and volume shows it to be heading down further and this is just the beginning.
the weirdest stock ever.
"Looks like the analysts see through the SaaS and growth story which are both not here with this tech. SaaS companies don't see service revenues grow like Appian has.downgraded at SunTrust Banks, Inc. from a ""buy"" rating to a ""hold"" rating. They now have a $28.00 price target.downgraded by analysts at Barclays PLC from an ""equal weight"" rating to an ""underweight"" rating. They now have a $20.00 PT."
Screaming buy at this level
"Revenue: Subscription revenue was $23.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 42% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Total subscriptions, software and support revenue was $25.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 31% year over year. Professional services revenue was $25.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 75% year over year. Total revenue was $50.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 50% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Appian's subscription revenue retention rate was 122% as of December 31, 2017."
"If no big players spreading baits here on, then this should begin to see pullbacks as faith would dwindle if price is lacking support"
Good earnings..will go Up
"Increased revenue for 2020, lower loss per share, etc. Isn't this good news? Why does this stock dropped after hours? Is it due to the company pulling its guidance for this year?"
APPN is a leader in their sector. Stock will quickly head to $200 once the market finds support. This is a growth stock and the growth is insane. I’ll keep buying on any big dip. Expect APPN to be $300 sometime in 2021.
Investors should be very wary of the lack of positive anyalist coverage.
Seems like heading down to 100Chart experts what is good price entry price?
"stock price is up over 10%, but put price is up too. people are nervous."
"Innovation and quality of products, expanding global footprint, partnerships with major companies including Google, and brains with integrity running the company. What's not to like? Market cap is under 4 billion today on secondary offering and pullback. Feeling very good about growth in company and stock price from here. Happy shareholder!"
"Fred, like i said last week pump and dump. i told you this is the game of wall street"
Market Makers playing games. Down 90 cents on 55K shares. They are looking for weak hands because they have a huge short of 2.4 million shares that need to be covered. Problem is there are 2 million less shares available as Abiel added that amount in the last 2 months. Less shares in the float to cover will equal upward movement.
My basis is $35 but I sold so much at $50
Good premium in covered calls.Buy $APPN
"If you think it’s high now, wait 5-10 years."
"Tempted to sell at $32. I don't understand what is driving the price. A friend of mine believes the price will reach $100 by the end of 2018. I don't believe it. Frankly, I expect a big pull back at next earnings."
What did i tell you just couple days ago? this goes to $150!!
Heading past $86 today after earnings...will be a record day.
"Im out, 50% up in less than a month, happy with that until it gets to a more suitable re-entry point."
"With the Dow's see saw over the trade war news, I'm impressed that Appian stock hasn't been affected very much."
"I’m not a pumper, but this stock is still at “ground floor” status. I hope to hold my shares till I’m 59 1/2."
"As an investor in this company, I'm very unhappy with the recent activity. The second dilution had a massive affect on the float, flooding the market with an additional 2 million shares. There's no telling when they'll suddenly choose to do that again. Then, no guidance for future earnings. What are we to believe in?? Quality tech companies are hitting all time highs and weathering the storm of COVID-19. Meanwhile, Appian goes backwards with no news or sign of a substantial business deal that will elevate future earnings. The highlights of the quarter were dull and non eventful at best."
My work used Appian but dropped it. Enough people just weren't interested in learning how to program to make the license worthwhile.
"I’ve done some research on this company, do feel the business has great potential and would like to get in at some point. But I don’t feel this is a good entry point near term after such a continued sharp rally. It has to come down for a major correction at some point, as all stocks would do. I’ll build my position then"
"I'll be surprised if this doesn't recover next week from tdy's drop, earnings were a beat but just shows you the mkt wanted more. its very fickle tough love. I listened into the CC this morning and this company is a slow steady mover, happy with future guidance nothing concerning, its a grower slow and steady, totally doesn't warrant the 8% plus drop tdy. Hate saying it but it's a buying opportunity!"
$300 by year end. Great company and requires patience. This is not a short term play.
"Listened to the CC, impressive, super bullish on future customer growth, wouldn't give any colour around nos but have a strong pipeline with high conversion rates, working with partners KPMG and will be adding more partners.. . All in all was pretty good. Should see a good bounce tomorrow. Quietly confident which after last few very frustrating months says a lot.. Let's just say I'm a lot more comfortable in t h e direction they are taking APPN. Lastly I'd recommend everyone to listen to the recording CC if you get a moment. Only 25 mins. Gl"
Such huge runup. Is it time to sell or can this go even higher. I don't want to get greedy and lose. Thanks!
"Abdiel Capital of new york city is the largest holder with over 8,000,000 shares no one else is close to owning that much. if you are an investor in this fund/firm, you may want to ask them how they are fulfilling their fiduciary responsibility to you by owning a company that is selling at 47 times sales and not making money. ABDIEL Capital is likely to get their buts sued off when this stock crashes."
Great buying opportunity
"Below $20, time to buy then sell at $22. Easy money!"
No way this is gonna my back to $24 unless we have a complete market sell off or company substantially disappoints with earnings. Do not bet against this CEO.
"Taking my profits here, I wish all you bulls the best of luck!For me, after analyzing hundreds of shares in growth, small/mid cap, and tech ETFs, APPN is the most immensely overvalued share there is. Unfortunately, I cannot justify this valuation based on its relatively slow revenue growth compared to a lot of tech opportunities out there. It’s hard to justify this even in relation to similar “overvalued” growth or tech when it’s 2-3 times overvalued.However, I am no expert and I truly wish all you longs the best of luck, it’s been a great ride!"
This stock could be like buying TTD back in 2018. Another 10 bagger upside is likely given it's a founder lead company that tends to generate high returns on it's S&M costs. They also seem to have a mission critical product in place. Who are their competitors currently?
This stock movement doesn’t make much sense. Only going up no down side
"APPN valuation does not make sense. $14B market cap for a company that is not yet profitable goes against all practical business logic. Remember, Appian's CFO just sold 5813 shares on 11/13@ $98. And now the stock reached $216....something doesn't add up. Please be careful everyone."

Surprisingly quiet in this chat room....
earnings
this offering was done so poorly with no specified price other than market price or a secretly negotiated price with the underwriter.
"This stock wears me out. Bought in the 30's so great gains, but the psycho price action gets old. Its either going to 400 or 50 after earnings."
Wow! If you bought at the lows you got a spiffy pop!
No complaints
WOW!!!!!! biggest one-day gain I've ever seen in my life
Appn is breaking all time highs on a daily basis.. With momentum behind it this could hit the eighties in the next month and touching the late nineties by year end... Time will tell!
Investor conference starts today.
"It all makes sense now... APPN added $1 billion in market cap for every $1 million in revenue beat last earnings, logical"
This needs to come back down to its normal channel and a valuation that makes sense at around $80-$100 before day traders blew this thing up.
Oversold by a mile. Loving the cheap shares.
"From someone who has seen enterprise software development from scratch be in incredibly pain for execs, this company’s potential is massive"
Down afterhours. 7% on 11K shares. Either someone is trying to pick off stop loss trades or someone is trying to create panic sellers tomorrow.
"KPGM partnership, lots of buzz happen. Watch to see what happens to the stock at 12:30, just like BOX yesterday?"
"Listened to a podcast with the CEO of Appian. So impressed, he's got a lot of stake in the game because he owns about 50% of the shares. I'm holding but I'm thinking about strengthening that position."
Bought at $55 and sold at $182...
Bought more this AM at $52+It's now a decent part of my trading portfolio and my 401kIt wasn't that long ago when it had been $60+
wait its not down 24% like all other tech post earnings? what is this sorcery
"Been on my watch list for 14 months, every time it’s been at 32ish, it’s bounced consistently back to 36+, finally went in for 65 shares at 31.33, it either will or won’t be a good play, Target price is 38 for me"
They are 200 plus million cash positive. Earnings growing. More companies creating apps...
Close at 35 so nobody makes any money on those options. Options control where the price will be after yesterdays pop. There aren't many contracts out for next month. I wouldn't be surprised to see a nice pop in the stock next week as covering begins with the outperform rating and buy rating 2 weeks ago.
Timber once again
"First Quarter 2021 Guidance: Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $81.7 million and $82.7 million, representing a year-over-year increase of between 4% and 5%.Adjusted EBITDA loss is expected to be in the range of $(9.0) million and $(8.0) million.Non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be in the range of $(0.15) and $(0.13). This assumes 70.8 million weighted average common shares outstanding."
Shorts increased to 5.61M shares almost 20% on 7/15. This doesn't take into account that on 6/28 there was a trade of 4.3M after the close. Since the 15th the OBV was still stuck at the same level and a whole lot of shorting since the 15th trying to accumulate shares. Today it gained 800K shares. So the squeeze with the Wave 3 should be huge! Less shares available with large buy and squeeze looks good. Expect a move to 44.20 or 47.13 at the least.
It beat. whats the problem?
162 is big celling in short.May go back to $130in the range of $130-$162
Patient investors will be able to buy at $100 within the next 2-3 weeks.
Just discovered this stock. A lot of hesitation here. Any convincing input?
Did they announce all the numbers ? Revenue ?
incredible buying opportunity
Market Makers are keeping the stock price down. Keep dropping the bid and ask each time it starts to head up. Accumulation taking place.
incredible buying opportunity right now. amazing company.
at what price would you buy more to average down? I'm in high around 130
I just sold my shares at $175.24. Bought it at $36 something this past spring. We'll see if I made the right decision on Monday. I suspect a drop on Monday. IMO.
OH NOOOO.........Appian Price Target Cut to $190.00/Share From $235.00 by Needham.Completely overdone today
What is driving this stock today?
"Don’t let shortie bob misguide you. He wants you to sell so that stock price will fall more and he can buy your share at a lower price. I am summarizing results below:Appian came out with a quarterly loss of $0.03 per share versus Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.11. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 82.35%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this business process management software provider would post a loss of $0.11 per share when it actually produced break-even earnings, delivering a surprise of 100%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Appian posted revenues of $81.63 million for the quarter ended December 2020, surpassing Consensus Estimate by 10.98%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $68.62 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters."
I agree with those saying this feels like TTD years ago... which I thought would stop at 200...300...etc.This is the future of enterprise software. There is no reason to build software from scratch when the use cases are so similar. Now into cloud and robotics... see you in a couple years at $500.
Buy 200 @ $134.00 FILLED :)
About time! Starting to think this investment was never going to pay off. Anyone know why the big move up?
Someone buys 125K at the close yesterday driving up to 34.74. 19K afterhours at same price with 100 shares bought at the close for 33.92 and as usual they hold the price down there all morning. Like I said easy to manipulate this stock.
Great earnings report. The future looks bright.
This will recover quickly.
"Today, more than 2,500 Pirelli employees use Appian across 12 countries to support more than 65 core business processes. Appian applications handle from approval of invoices not related to a purchase order up to tire molds management.Wow!!"
This stock going back under $100 in next 3 months. Good company but stock should not have gone up 400 percent in last 10 months when sales were up 35 percent
this beauty is going to fly to $120 very soon. this is a STRONG BUY. Next year it will be $200!!! Do NOT sell
Well just as I promised I’m back in at 34. I plan to scale in if it goes down further.
"And Volume >1mil shares in 3 hrs. (double avg) with rise of 8%. Keep in mind last report shows 21% of float is short, this will take >10d. to cover. This move could be in part due to short squeeze but there's clearly buyers out there lined up. Great job APPN"
What time does earnings come out?
let's get all these downgrades out of the way as they are all based on valuation. These have shook me out of stocks before only to watch them Skyrocket. You have to pay for growth
Looks like another manipulated stock. I expected to be down but not much. It’ll be a long road back for the 100 shares I own.
Motley coin!) just short all Motley and you can make money in 2021
"September 19, 2018. 12:00 Central Time: Down $1.98 on 240,000 shares. Nothing but selling all morning. No buyers. No news. I wonder what's up. 5 straight days of selling."
"Someone said crm in low code business. I’m a Salesforce admin and know their business quite well. Crm is not low code, ok?"
doesn't matter happens..almost everything is selling off after good results ATM...I'll keep holding and adding
Great company.....Should go much higher than the current price...
$200 by year end again
they're downgrading it just so they can buy more shares LOL I have a new strategy on this stock Buy on the downgrade
Why is going up on solid volume. Any news pending?.....
this stock is interesting there is always downgrades deep declines and buyers lined up what do they know?
Head and shoulders pattern on 3 month chart. Stock is going to move higher. Do not bet against this CEO. It’s just the beginning for this company.
I'm bullish 200 dollar they only one code from start to finish
"Upcoming earnings on the 22nd will be key to justifying this price/valuation. I have been long since the IPO. I sold half my position in the 30's. I like the company and think it has a great future. However, they must show SAAS/License growth that far exceeds services growth. The must come close to profitability. This is not a startup. But, a 15 year old company that is re-positioning itself from a pure BPM company to Low-Code. As stated I really like the company and long-term outlook. But, the current $2B valuation is hard to justify with $150M of annual revenue and very slow license growth in the past. These are just some of my thoughts and I look forward to listening to the investor call. GLTA."
'Full year cloud subscription revenue increased 36% year-over-year to $129.2 million'. And the market cap of APPN is worth more than 12 billions. Same thing for Tesla. Things are really changing in the people way of investing...
"Insider selling. Matthew W Calkins, CEO and President 10% Owner sold over $38M of shares. Filling after close on 12/10."
Amazing action and volumes... Time to buy before you goes to $300! been holding this since $50.
A great stock to be in. Huge runway in front of it 
Any news for the rally?
It is all shortsqueeze .. APPN has short Interest of 31.91% .. and lot of them are hedging from $90s.. no news.. it just short bubble exploded...
Just like the company
"APPN is providing workforce safety solutions!Manage the safety of your workforce during COVID-19Our Workforce Safety solution helps deliver a safe, smooth, and compliant transition from COVID quarantine back to on-site work."
Wow! After 2 years of holding a Spiffy Pop! Lol!
shorts at play. don't panic. add more if you can and keep holding. $200 soon
"Congratulations to Appian retail shareholders! I once owned and sold my 500 shares at $50/share for a $5,000 short-term gain, thought that was a good trade at the time. I now see that I left over $60,000 on the table, maybe growing lots more. Definitely biggest mistake of my past trading year. Thankfully I still hold TSLA FAANG and other winners, or I would be even sicker to my stomach. Win some, lose some, hopefully the wins exceed our losses each year. Oh well, congratulations again to Appian shareholders, you were wiser than me. Happy Thanksgiving."
Not the worst company out there - the market cap is the problem.
What’s the low so I can buy?
Anyone see that the short actually rose by 100K to 2.55 Million shares by Jan. 30th. even as the stock continued to climb. Shorts will avoid APPN in the future and it really looks good now. The covering will continue for several more days before earnings IMO. Those who hold this stock are holding long term. The price has been held down for over a year due to shorts and they may have learned their lesson as Investment companies purchase up the float leaving little room to manipulate the price lower. This thing will rocket up as the company grows and nobody sells.
Anyone have a prediction on how low this will go in the next few days - will it test 50?
Does anyone out there discuss fundamentals and business issues. I am concerned about the university business Appian does. Many of these institutions are under pressure in regard to opening back up and strapped for cash. I.e. cutting budgets. What does this mean for Appian?
Upgrade and price target increase released today!
Up almost 5% this morning. Nice
Diluted shareholder value of $53.61 based on overvalued share price of $56? Don't see why buyers get into this at inflated price. Fair value was $45 with dilution should be trading about 42.61.
Some must have taken profit at $60 today.
"Bought APPN share on June 10th at $52.75, by then the stock was making highs of $54 - $55s and lows of $52 - $51. Since then we had 2 spikes at $54. I got out on one of those. Making lower highs and lower lows, seems to me that it's posed to go back to $30's in this month."
Wow! 2X since November 12 and 3X for the month. Congratulations anyone who is long this stock.
SERIOUS QEUSTION HERE.... If I bought at 95 and sold now and lets say it drops only to 130 then I buy back would it of been better to have kept the 95 position? or to have used the extra cash to buy in? plz no joke.
Adding big time . Great stock
"On a fundamental basis this stock is clearly overvalued, yet we must remember that investors are sometimes willing to pay a steep premium for steep growth. I stopped being a strict fundamentalist after Amazon proved me wrong time after time during its ""no profit high growth"" stage. I am not implying that Appian is the new Amazon, but rather that sometimes the growth story is so compelling as to drive share price beyond the fundamentals.For investors, tomorrow is nothing to worry about as the growth will continue to amaze, however there is also a real possibility of a temporary drop as numbers are analyzed and upgrades/downgrades are announced. If a dip does happen I plan to add more as long term this is a stock to own!"
"Should I pull a trigger? I have been holding since $16, and wondering if this is the right time to pull a trigger for sell... does anyone know the reason for spike???"
APPN is heading to $200 as it approaches earnings in May. Up to you if you decide you want to hold after earnings but I will be holding until next earnings and watch the stock go up before they release earnings.
William Blair upgrades Appian to outperform....
"I work as an Appian developer , we use Appian suite to build enterprise business management systems at an accelerated timeline. Recently, due to the covid situation most organizations we work for have seen a need to change their business process with minimum cost which could only be possible with appian as it helps in accelerating application development process by negating the boiler plate code . Coming to the stock , not sure why such abnormal growth but the usage of product in both cloud and on premise has seen growth this year ."
"Since Salesforce has a competing product, would it make sense that APPN becomes an acquisition target? SalesForce's product is way behind. I would think APPN would get scoped up by Microsoft, Google or Amazon. I thought this would happen well over a year ago. Thoughts on this, are they an acquisition target?"
Just a guess but with a low market cap APPN will be bought out. They could get a very large premium right now.
Barclays pinning the stock price at 56 for secondary pricing. Only reason this overpriced stock is holding up. Once secondary is filled they will sell all the share they are buying to hold this up.
"Interest rate on those loaned APPN shares falling like a stone. Started at 85% (some saw 100%), it dropped 3x in the last week from 46% to 33% and now 17% - the last communication I received from my broker yesterday. Take note. The short sellers patience may be wearing a bit thin."
APPN heading to $150+ later this year. LOAD UP and GLTA!!!
"APPN getting into the DOF thru USAF is hugeee, massive, take a look at their budgets. This is only the start, public sector have the monies Won't be long now we'll pull back the 20% drop from recent highs and onwards. So glad I bought more and will be adding.. Can't underestimate this is massive. Delighted go APPN, only fear this will be acquired further down the road hoping by that stage we'll be high triple figures. Great news. GLA."
MF just recommended this stock as a best pick. Time to take a serious potential. Looks like this stock has a lot of upside.
"More selling by insider traders...what does this indicate?Appian Co. (NASDAQ:APPN) Director Bobbie G. Kilberg Sells 6,800 SharesAppian Co. (NASDAQ:APPN) Director Bobbie G. Kilberg sold 6,800 shares of Appian stock in a transaction on Thursday, December 3rd. The shares were sold at an average price of $138.50, for a total transaction of $941,800.00. Following the transaction, the director now owns 6,800 shares in the company, valued at approximately $941,800."
I’m very happy to see this spike in APPN shares given my indirect employment benefit but this has become absolutely insane. I had originally thought a takeout was coming in short order but the valuation is so ridiculously high there is no acquirer in their right mind out there to buy at this P/S ratio. 40x sales is nosebleed territory. Appian is a great company with potential but they are limited in scope within many of their larger accounts. They do not do well with complexity and the low code be has been sniffed out by many companies. They would be growing much faster than they are. This is fun to watch but take those profits. Lol
"Venting thread, this has been one of the most frustrating stocks to own. To add insult to injury it's the one I chose to be most weighted in my portfolio. My only consolation is the low volume. Hoping sellers dry up and we find support here and for the chart to not suffer further breakdown."
Good time to buy?
APPN is a great stock to own long term. You will see some occasional pullbacks like this one which are great buying opportunity. Insider selling is common for such stocks coz insiders have huge amount of shares and they diversify on gains. That is what we are seeing now. It will be give 30% returns ($200+) at current price within a year from now.
Investing new money in this market right now feels just like gambling. Feels just like 1999. We shall see.
"The last few days has to be a massive short squeeze. If you don’t know what that is look it up. It’s fun to ride but same people getting squeezed are now taking massive new short positions and will drive this down hard next week.Those of us long since the sub 50s stay long. Anyone just taking a long position in this mid to high 100s, watch out. And per usual, I could be wrong!"
Down from 36.96 to 35.96 on 70K shares. Same movement by market makers and shorts trying to shake out some shares. Earnings on 21st so the covering should continue unless the shorts double down and try to push it down. Don't think it will happen as there isn't any action on Put Option buying.
Why is Appian up 7.5% since GS put the sell on?
I bought this stock about 2 years ago as suggested by Motley Fool-long
Valuation makes 0 sense. They plan to report negative earnings and an analyst rise price target by ovewr 100% LOOOOOL... revenue expected at 70million like LOOOOOOL for 15B market cap XD
Up 30% in 4 days with no news... Curious to see how this responds on a down day.
Full Breakout and a stock you want to own if you are a growth Investor.
I actually like that this stock is not getting the attention it deserves. Those days are numbered though as volume was 10x avg yesterday and 5x today. APPN is a waking giant with great upside potential.
Beat earnings and it goes down?
Frustration again with no news breaching $40 and relatively decent volume. Could be someone who bought at much higher level when we ran to 60+ for tax write off before year's end. ANy other thoughts?
What's the news for the big move today?
"What do you all think about earnings tomorrow? I don't see a whisper number yet, anyone have any insight on it."
"Wow. If you believe in 30% growth, this is a good day to buy."
SOLD!! at 172$ will buy back in on tuesday when its around 130 or maybe lower. I love this stock but if its real and healthy then it will go down then rise again.
Look at it go! Patience pays off.
Looking forward to an exciting week. APPN is trending up and is set to soar after releasing its latest earnings after market close on Thursday.
i am buying more!!!
"We may be back at 35 in 2 weeks. The options were heavily sold on the puts. The break even for options between puts and calls is 35. Look at the open interest of calls and puts. They sold a lot of puts and MM won't want to pay them in 2 weeks. After they expire they may sell off the stock to get out. I once traded options in Boyd Gaming for over 6 months. 3 day before they expired, I had 40K in calls at 7 strike they sold off a property on Vegas Blvd. Stock popped to 8 and they shorted it down below 7 for the next 3 days until my options expired worthless. The following Monday to Wednesday the stock doubled to 14.50. They had held the price down for 6 months keeping my options below 7 each month I bought more calls. Manipulation. Ever notice how you see stocks open and close at the same price on expiration day for small and mid cap stocks. MM already have their break even price between calls and puts. They won't let themselves lose. This stock is easy to manipulate share price. Just have a feeling as I have been screwed by MM before and options can tell you a lot about the price action. There was no reason for over reaction to open 5 bucks down yesterday."
Congrats to this CEO for donating to charity. More should follow suit.
"Should be going up, not down. great ER, and improved guidance. this is a buying opportunity"
"Dang,, 7% drop. What the heck is going on ? I see no news."
So basically the stock price is right where the MM wanted it to be when they dropped the price 8% yesterday on 21K shares. Nobody is selling today except weak hands who no nothing. There is a lot of selling back and forth between the MM trying to find more shares. They are still losing from all the share they sold trying to keep the price down. Earnings were good and even the analysts were commending them on a great quarter during CC.
5.61 Million shares short and 15.9 days to cover. Shorts doubled in one month while stock rose under accumulation and less shares available due to 4.3M MOC order Friday 6/28. Margin calls will begin soon. Good Luck!
"Expensive product they make but extremely good. Still, the price is putting off many medium-sized potential and existing clients. That is my dilemma with this stock/company."
"motley buy recommendations are for 3-5 year holds, not quick flip profits."
Getting a few more shares and holding through earnings! This is a rocket about to lift off to $350!
Back to $125 shortly here!!
"Good company with HUGE upside and legitimate CEO and ownership team. Their low code products are catching big time favor and future is bright. If Goose wants to wait, it will be too late to buy cheap shares like it is now."
I've bought and sold. Made a fortune! Thank u long term folks....
There are now options being traded on Appian
Short squeeze coming! Buy in before it pops up over $50 again IMHO.
Decent earnings but light on enthusiasm - this company has a very bright future and would be an instant takeover candidate (at a significant premium) if they ever took this route. Highly unlikely in the next 1.5 years. I believe they make an acquisition to broaden the product suite ;) The lower this goes the more compelling the opportunity. Good luck longs.
$250M in Sales and losing $50M a year. Market Cap over $3B. Hmmm.
On fire.
"Market being down today doesn’t help, it should bounce back up hopefully! Stay long"
Since May 26 APPN has been making lower highs and lower lows seems like a bearish trend.
any news?
"How could slack and appn be competitors? They are in totally different world. Also Salesforce is in another world as well. Have seen people connecting them, nonsense if you know all of their business models. Why I keep on saying people often buying stocks they have no clue about"
bought starter position just under $50. kicking myself for watching for so long but it would seem this was a turning point. will add on dips and enjoy the ride.
"Cup and Handle forming (Started on May 26th, Handle completion on 09/18(?). 2-Month- Positive Accumulation/Distribution, and Positive Stochastic & RSI Divergences on 2-Month chart. Looking for a breakout starting by early next week (?), short-term target is $70.00+Good luck to all longs!"
Yahoo and one other source says APPN is up $9.52. !!! Ameritrade still says around the closing price. Does anyone see any news to possibly account for this price seen at Yahoo and at another source i have?
"APPN not participating again on another green day in the mkt place, this is becoming a regular occurance, Strange.. , market movers obviously playing around I guess. low volume too doesn't help . Let's see how it does tomorrow. Gl."
"again the devious ""analysts"" are at it again. scare everyone to sell their shares to push down the price so they can buy it cheaper and people will jump back in. it is amazing that these guys don't get arrested"
Abdiel filing with SEC. Don't know why? Maybe just a statement of ownership.
"Appian Co. (NASDAQ:APPN) major shareholder Abdiel Capital Management, Llc sold 172,366 shares of Appian stock in a transaction that occurred on Tuesday, December 1st. The shares were sold at an average price of $140.85, for a total transaction of $24,277,751.10. The sale was disclosed in a filing with the SEC."
"Could someone please explain why AAPN stock price has doubled in 2 weeks? And do you believe this stock is going to continue increasing $100/month to $1,000 like SHOP did?"
Now typical pattern for a short attack - last hour they try to scare you. Just hold. They have to cover at some point and it will turn in a massive up move
"Josh Brown picked APPN at random, as an example of a company working on low code. His comments were not company specific to APPN, and it sets off a buying frenzy. Investors, these days, are nothing more than uniformed gamblers."
"Just got back in. Other than Zacks sell recommendation based on earnings trends, nothing has changed in the stock that was not in the e.r. Apparently people didn’t read the e.r. or had to have someone else tell them to sell. This has to be a long term hold as fundamentally the company is investing for the future hence earnings will not necessarily be stellar but as long as growth continues, APPN should be fine."
CFRA initiated with a Hold Rating. That is what is happenning.
This just keeps blasting past support levels.. wth is going on...
APPN was a $40's stock last year. Every analysts says current stock price is overvalued and cut their price targets based on lowered future guidance. APPN will be go back to $40~50 level this summer.
"I apologize for continuing to post about the rate on loaned securities for APPN, but it's because I honestly can't believe it. Just went from 85% to 95% today. I don't even know what to say........"
"Motley fool likes to tease you with their five best stock picks garnering %1000s and %10000 of gains, and yet if you had bought all of their other stock picks over the last 16 years, you would have only gained %354... which isn't bad, but not eye-popping spectacular. Choose well for they have many more picks that lose money than those that gain."
why down big today?
This is definitely the short squeeze I was predicting. The shorts bought all those out of the money options before they bought back in and drove the price up.
From what I can tell there exists a bunch of talented people and innovation coming forward at Appian World this week. Not sure why the stock drops 5% today. On sale?
Beats estimates then drops 7% after hours. Crazy market right now for tech.
Hey shortie Bob. I’m sure you’re panicking since the stock hasn’t dropped yet. Don’t panic when it does another jump. It’s just money.
Up $8.00 today on 700k shares traded. Volume too low to be real. It will collapse in the near future.
Look out Below
APPN is a long term keeper for me. I’m in big since 56.
"Lockup expiration is November 21 according to EDGAR. All things considered, I don't expect the price to drop below the IPO price, although we may take a hard hit. I will be watching to buy more shares at a very favorable price. We shall see.https://pro.edgar-online.com/ipo.aspx?colleft=3c2bcac1-dbf5-4776-9d3b-89001baee8d5&colright=b7d3b48b-3bc7-40dd-bba6-2e58e1a4fc92"
shorts get roasted again
Appian connected claims launches on AWS today though
Shorts definitely clamoring for shares. Income rate on my loaned shares has gone from 6% to 17% in 6 days. Here's hoping they choke on them :-)
Long hold. These prices will seem cheap in 10 years. Like I said Long Hold.
"What's going on with APPN, why the drop, are they doing a stock issue? Not happy."
Doubled my position!
