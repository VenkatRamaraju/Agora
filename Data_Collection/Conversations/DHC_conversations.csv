Just a few days to EX.DIV. BUY???
"Why worry about fve shares. The company had no real value before snh bailed them out. In my opinion the Portnoys could not run a car wash, let alone the combined snh & fve."
Since Richard and Jennifer received healthy slugs of low cost options each hopefully it will impel them to discuss plans of repaying the 9.75% billion dollar loan. This will release funds to pay a halfway decent dividend.
"Distribution of 5 shares of FVE per share of SNH = 3.30After today's haircut, we will be earning a 6% return approximately.Add in the FVE distribution and you've got about the same equity you had previously, IF both issues hold at their current levels...?"
Excellent results. More to come. DHC is ready to move up from here.
The market value of DHC reflects less than half the value of the underlying assets. It is even less than the tangible book value! Could this be due to external management or just the ineptness of RMR management? Compare the book value to market capitalization of WELL and VTR with DHC.Management panicked at the outset of the pandemic and raised a billion dollars at 10% with all kinds of covenants including cutting dividends to $0.01.When you look at the long term chart of this company it is a steady decline over the years. I am not sure what the motivations of the RMR group are but they have lost a lot of money for investors over the last many years.I hope one of them will respond to this post.
Last divvy announcement was January 18. April 18 just 12 trading days away.
wish I done some homework on SNH I would not have increased my shares by a third today !
Listen to the call. SNH recieves 260 million shares of Five Star. Per this web site SNH has 237 million shares outstanding or slightly over one share per one share This will return aprox sixty cents per share against today’s loss in value of 2.00 and a future annual dividend loss of approx $1.00;per share per annum. While SNH had little choice in doing something to rescue Five Star the future outlook does not sound good. President open the call citing all of the reasons that Five Star is in trouble..then going forward in the call none of these issues are addressed as relaxing. A lot of “ hope” for the future which is kinda what you would expect. I under water about 18k and can’t see it getting a lot better. 
"I don't care what happens to Me. I just want the Portnoy family to be ridiculously wealthy. I could die broke in the street for all I care, as long as the Portnoys are feasting at the City's best steak-houses every night of the week. I am serious Boys. I am talking about total devotion. That's why I invested in GOV / OPI and SNH, and I don't mind getting hosed one bit!"
Just listened to the conference call. No doubt in my mind that the div will be cut. They say that restructuring fve could negatively affect cash flow and pointed that out when asked if the div would need to be cut. They say they will have an announcement about fve within 60 days so we don't have too long to wait. I am counting on the div remaining above 1.00 which still gives a better div yield way above comparable cos.
rising from ashes.. just matter of time.. thinking about when they will reinstate dividend
will this reach 12 dollars ?
Check out their SIR & GOV listings....!
"""Senior Housing shareholders will receive rights to shares equal to 51% ownership of Five Star.""So, how many FVE shares per SNH will investors get?"
"When the interest rate environment turns (and we may be at the apex right now), so will the share price..."
"Some thoughts on the rate of money they raised- Although DHC paid a high rate for the money they raised, they achieved a important thing: flexibility-With the flexibility, they can now do a few things without having to constantly answer the question of liquidity, including divesture, streamlining business and refinancing at much better rate in a few months-They now have the incentive to move quickly forward with divesture which stalled in part due to the pandemic, and not to make any ill-timed purchases like they did just before the pandemic hit. -PEAK paid a much lower rate for the money they raised a couple of days ago. But the potential gain for the stock is limited, maybe 20% +-. While DHC can potentially gain 100%+ from the current price of $4.5. Another way to look at it, PEAK has the price/ffo of 15 vs DHC 3.7. -DHC’s price/book value currently is at 0.4 vs PEAK’s 2. By this measure, DHC is overwhelmingly undervalued. The book value is real and matters in REIT. The properties DHC sold so far have sizable capital gains (quarterly reports)-Which stock to buy? It is really dependent on what you are aiming for. DHC for potentially huge gain, or PEAK for modest gain and relative stability. The same principle apply to all stocks, risk-reward."
my math issayingthis dont make sense.....fve only has 50 millon shares outstanding....for fve to give us 5 shares for everyone of our snh shares they need tocome up withovera billion shares
Good report. Stable. High yield. Safe dividend.
How could anyone question the sincerity or motives of the PORTNOY gang?
rmr management is the ONLY group making money that should belong to the shareholders of OPI

You would think this would relatively be pretty stable earnings every quarter but somehow management looks to screw things up every now and then
"This seems like a very good result, all things considered, now they need immunity from negligence lawsuits!."
"Health Care REITS are getting slammed again today, so the whole sector is a tough space to be in right now. Good time to buy more SNH, et al."
"You know, I just have to complain a bit. I labored over the decision over what reit to purchase and went back and forth between SNH, OHI, and O. Decided to go with SNH earlier this year. Yes, I know, diversify. Still, I just wanted to complain. Thanks for listening."
Earnings tomorrow morning CC to follow let's hope for some positive news on the FVE situation.
"SNH shareholders will receive, by way of a distribution of the right to receive Five Star common shares from SNH and subject to certain conditions, Five Star common shares equal to approximately 51% ownership of Five Star post issuance, effective as of January 1, 2020. SNH will also increase its current 8.3% ownership of Five Star to approximately 34% post issuance. SNH currently plans to retain this ownership of Five Star for the foreseeable future."
"To secure liquidity is a great news. DHC had $1b revolving credit facility and had an option to extend one more year. The outstanding was $537.5m according to its IR (p16. note 9). Now, DHC announced its contingent plan to secure around $33m*4m per year dividend and $150m capex reduction. This approx. $876m (462+150+33*4*2years) is much more than 2020 and coming 2021 debts $754m ($454m and $304m, respectively. p14~15 of the IRSupp.). Even financing costs will be reduced. Thus, weathering COVID19 seasons will not go longer than 2 years. SOHP, FVE already is paying one third compared to the previous rent. So what? This means no default and will reward stock holders by huge market values. Don't you agree? This must be a painful time but a kind of compulsory cost reduction restructuing which I wished for. A wonderful price but too pitty that I do not have enough money."
"The good vaccine news is particularly good for Senior housing/nursing home business as seniors are especially susceptible to the novel virus. Although the commercial vaccine may still be a few months away, the chances of success are very high for the Moderna vaccine according to the scientific experts.For Senior housing industry in general, this means that the current stock price, factored in with disaster scenarios, is way too cheap. This is true for most senior housing REITs. DHC in particular has 2.5 of price/FFO ratio vs 10 of normal range. Another way to look at it is the $0.6 of dividend for DHC, although suspended for liquidity. It is whopping 20% under the current price. Unlike travel industry/ airlines/hotels, senior housing operating revenue is only marginally affected. DHC’s properties are even stringer positioned because of its 50% portfolio in medical office/biotech segments and less than 50% in senior housing.So the bottomline is that DHC will like triple or quadruple when the vaccine becomes available, which, according to Moderna, possibly is 6 months away.Triple or quadruple in 6 months? We shall see."
Hopefully Mr. Portnoy goes to Church now and has seen the light. My hopes are that he will no longer use his genius to rob us blind but rather to deliver to us hefty dividends.
"I expect a drop in the dividend to $.27 a quarter and look at this year as a transition year. That said if the PPS drops to $8 I will add more since I do think 2020 and on, can deliver better results. I have no plans to sell any shares now as I do think the future is bright and at this stage they just have a glitch to get through. But longer term even at $.27 per quarter it is worth it and gives current shareholders the opportunity to average down (as when the do announce a reduction to the dividend, we should see some sort of short term sell off IMHO) for future improvements. That's the way I see it."
SNH is up 4.95% to 8.06
sold all my shares - been to this dance before - this stock is going way down - shorts will rule the day
DHC owns a lot of good medical and science related properties. I am hoping in time we'll see a return of the dividend and an increase in share price.
The history of this company goes back 20 years and have never cut the dividend I’m assuming they have had challenges in the past so I’m staying positive and confident they will be able to bridge any conflicts
Guys Get out of this stock now .. its worth 6 to 7 bucks at max... Five Star was on the verge of bankruptcy and we at SNH rescued it. Dividend going forward is 55c to 65c annually .. thats a sixty percent dividend cut.. debt to equity ration is not great and lots of cleaning to do .. we should get a 9 percent yield on this clean up .. this stock is worth 6.2 to 7.11 dollars. there is still lots of cleaning ..
The Seeking Alpha article on 3-1 by Trapping Value is a good analysis of snh. You do not have to like or agree with his assumptions but they are based on actual financial analysis. He is more pessimistic than I about the div cut but it pays to evaluate all well thought out opinions. I will continue buying below 12 in spite of his opinion that it will go to 10.
"This restructuring had to be done; it bolsters FVE's ability to be an ongoing concern (reduces debt load), moves SNH's dividend to much lower, but also easily covered. This should allow for much more positive growth down the road. Also, SNH is moving to reduce debt load too. Based on the overhang of bad news, the final result will be much more positive than I thought would happen. The restructuring benefits both shareholder bases and puts both companies in a much better financial situation. Yes, the dividend cut is the worst part..."
"Buy, hold, DRIP. Easy as one, two, three. 2nd Q looked good and the clean up continues. + FVE shares are coming in January."
"We were portnoyed in 2018 but in order for them to get big incentive distribution in 2019 they have to get the stock up. They may not like it but we shareholders will be along for the ride. My guess is they will announce that they expect to maintain the div or announce a small div cut, both of which will probably make the stock go up. Happy New Year to all that have been portnoyed."
will go down like a rock before the year is out; just my opinion. I sold out my position a month ago when it became clear the dividend will be substantially cut this year. It will be paying around 60 cents a year after the cut. imo
"From the CC transcriptBryan MaherRight. And seeing that we have a little bit of time, let me just ask you maybe a big picture question. The Vertex Pharmaceutical headquarters and let's just say, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Towers in L.A. I mean they're a big part of your NOI at this point, and those are just whale of assets.And what do you think the Street is missing when they look at the portfolio? It seems like there's so much noise related to the SHOP component of the business that it seems like the Street and investors are maybe not giving you credit for kind of the supertankers in their portfolio. How do you think about that when talking to investors and trying to convey the story?Jennifer FrancisIt's a really good point, Bryan. I spend a lot of time trying to talk about our MOB and life sciences portfolio. And while you talk about those 2 assets which, obviously, are premier assets, really well located, great tenant base in those. The rest of our portfolio is also very strong. We've been consistently over 92% occupied in our same-store portfolio. We've got Torrey Pines. We've got assets in - life sciences assets in Boston and San Francisco and San Diego. It's a strong portfolio.I don't know what people are missing. And it's why I try to spend a lot of time talking about that portfolio. Senior living is the topic of choice, certainly, but we'll continue to get out and try to convey the strength of that portfolio.Francis has her work cut out for her convincing investors of the value of this portfolio. So far she has not succeeded."
Regardless how bad things look I still believe this is worth consideration if it goes under $2.00 per share.
Fve pps recovered after earnings but snh plunged and hasn’t recovered. Why the discrepancy? Thoughts?
.52 dividend looks about right. That's a 66% cut. It would still be a 5% yield if the price stopped at 10.40.
Does FVE really have a market cap of just ~$34 million? That's chump change compared to a company the size of SNH.
Current yield is 7.1%. Not enough Portnoy discount for me. Lots of safer 8% yields around run by folks that take care of shareholders and not just themselves!!
So what's the payout in stock recieved to shareholders in this transaction
This was just as true a week ago as it is today! I strongly suggest you research management and the companies past. Reputation matters even at this price.
iam out enough
"I looked at this company for the dividend But then when I saw RMR is managing , I decided to stay away RMR which was managing GOV , now since one month has become OPI , had terrible performance with RMR cutting dividend by over 60% making stock drop by same amount I would stay away if RMR is managing, as they appear to be incompetent They collect high fees but make shareholders lose money"
"Jennifer, you really needs to do a whole lot more... for this is looking more like, as reflected by the declining share price, a dog with fleas, than a valuable, well situated healthcare REIT."
"I would venture to guess the 2Q20 results which will be reported next week. FFO $0.24, a decrease from $0.29 of 1Q , due to the full quarter effect of COVID-19. DHC need to move quickly in property sale in the coming months to pay down their debt just issued in May, or facing mounting pressure of paying high interest rate and diminishing ROE."
"Say Dudes. DHC has a wonderful portfolio of health care properties, athletic facilities, and bio science buildings. We have a capitalization of one and a half billion $$$ strong. our properties are spread out all across this great nation. i strongly encourage U to make a cash investment in the DHC Real Estate Trust. This recommendation is coming down from ""on high."""
"slow done SNH ,don't go up to fast I want to buy some more stock in a couple months !"
I don't think I want to even get near this one.
"Yan, it will be enough to buy a cup of coffee !"
Drop is related to FVE?????
chainsaw Al the Godfather what are your thoughts?
How does Warren Buffett’s saying ‘Be greedy when others are fearful’ work here?
"portnoyed; a new verb; works for scrabble; if you get portnoyed, well, you will know it; jr makes millions a year mismanaging the company; he comes first second and third; shareholder, well you arent even on the list; the purchase of 1.2 billion of properties by gov should have been a BIG warning sign; shareholders beware; management gets paid based upon the amount of property under management; shareholders get the trash left on the parking lots."
"On March 11, 2019, we entered into a letter agreement with SNH, pursuant to which, with respect to those certain Amended and Restated Master Lease Agreements, Nos. 1-5, or the Master Leases, among certain of our subsidiaries and certain of SNH’s subsidiaries, SNH agreed to defer, until March 31, 2019, payment of the aggregate Minimum Rent (as defined in the Master Leases) due and payable by us to SNH under the Master Leases for February 2019. This is on an 8k just filed by Five Star."
Portney did wonders for GOV.
Bad news for you guys. I just had my gtc filled. And if past performance of my buys is an indicator SNH will be bk in about 9 months. I hope I am wrong. But I have destroyed numerous companies by buying just 100 of their shares
When r we getting FVE shares and how many shares per each 100 snh shares
"I was thinking that if you factor in inflation, the January 2009 low of $11.39 translates into a price of $13.60 in today's dollars. So we are currently below that price today by a wide margin."
Welltower reported on earnings call they are relatively bullish on senior housing for 2020. Bodes well for DHC?
What they did Iam not sure they will recover from they took 1/2 the stock value and destroyed the dividend. management really you shouldn't get one dime. zero
"beware of the portnoy touch; hang onto your wallet; he needs money for his yacht, private jet, expensive life style"
"Book value is $13.60, dividend is 12%, why so panic?"
"The biggest drag on this company has been the Long Term Care segment. When Covid hit, nobody wanted to put their loved ones in any facility, especially since they were working from home and could take care of them and save a lot of money. I know because I own an Assisted Living Center. We went from a continuous waiting list to several open rooms very quickly. We are now back to a waiting list. People going back to work, and they are getting more comfortable with LTC facilities. The LTC portion of this company is probably making a big turnaround!"
"FVE was on life support because the rent was too high. By 2025, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates there will be 10.2 million people who are 83 years old or older. With a penetration rate of about 10%, the senior housing industry will need to add roughly 164,000 additional senior housing units by 2025 to meet demand by that time. However, if the current national run-rate of 45,000 units per month continues, the U.S. would reach that total in 3.7 years and potentially leave the industry with excess inventory if the rate of new openings continues apace through 2025, according to NIC.To take another view, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that there will be 15.6 million people age 80 or older by 2025. With a similar penetration rate of about 10%, the senior housing industry will need to add 316,000 additional units of supply to meet demand by that time."
"A positive case for DHC: The dividend cut is temporary for 3-6 months. FFO stays at $1.20/yr (30cents last quarter) and dividend at $0.60/yr. Its business should not be affected much by the current pandemic (medical and biotech buildings -50%; senior living -50%). Stock price in the coming months, $8 - $10 (price/FFO ratio of 7). If the divesture goes through and leverage cut down, and its 80% owned FVE contributes to its FFO growth to $1.50, and dividend raised to $1.20 (80% of FFO, industry common practice), then the stock price will go to $12-15 ( P/ffo ratio of 8). That will right its book value dislocation."
"Let's face it Boys. Portnoy cleaned us out. I am a long time investor of Gov and SNH, so I'm basically penniless on those investments. The Portnoy family used sleight of hand to turn my investment in to pennies and crumbs. I'm a Boob for believing in the Portnoy dynasty."
"I’m in this for a while, at a price in the low $20s. Any chance it ever gets back up into double digits from these lows in the $4s?"
"I've owned this beauty since day one. It doesn't usually stay this low very long but we're in a different world today. No dividend increase for the last 25 quarters is not exactly a positive, plus you've always got the Portnoy situation. It's not great but it's not catastrophic. Collect the dividend and pray you don't get Portnoyed."
"Here’s my conspiracy theory:RMR is using FVE as a sacrificial lamb to move their properties into SNH for cheap prices. FVE is losing money so fast that they could be out of business in six quarters. So that puts us at mid 2020 when the industry could be in the midst of a strong rebound. Then SNH would just need new operators to fill the FVE void or self manage. That’s a challenge, but you have purchased a lot FVE assets below value. FVE only has $8M in debt so it’s not as if there are creditors that are going to get the 20 properties. Maybe they just hand them over to SNH in lieu of rental contracts in chapter 11 and get absorbed by SNH. I just think RMR holds the cards here and will serve their own interests which they have a history of doing. That interest is to make sure SNH thrives so they can collect big management fees. It may be a short term pain for long term gain scenario."
In this very low interest rate environment they had to pay 9.75% on the $1 bil of new bonds they just issued... yikes. Gonna be a heavy burden going forward.
I bought over a year ago and my investment got chopped into tiny pieces. Should I hang on to take the hit?
"Finally, it’s announced. No change. Good for us"
Down nearly 4% for no publicly known reason. Do I smell a Portnoy Special?
The company may want to skip the reduced dividend. It just reminds share holders that the company is not yet normal and act to sell the stock.
"Checking something on dates, replies appreciated.(1) I understand div will be cut, but what should we expect to happen on 4/25? Last div was 1/25 so 90 days back. I would expect whatever the new div is will be ex-div on or about 4/25.(2) When should SNH shareholders expect to get their FVE shares? I'm close to selling the rest of my shares, trying to calculate how to minimize the loss. Today's drop probably makes that moot, but..."
"It will settle in $6 to $7 range as dividends is only 60 cents per yearFor 10 % yield , it will go to around $6 per shareSame thing happened to GOVIt went down by 60% and now renamed OPIIt is hard to trust Mgmt of REIT companies"
"Way over sold Blackrock just added 718,000 shares on their uLt filing good luck shorts"
Shares Held by Institutions increased from 70% last season to 80% now. Good sign.
"Based on BKD's current market value, DHC should be at least $12."
Results look pretty good considering what happened 1st Q. They are already moving out extinguishing debt and selling assets. I expect this to be all cleaned up by the end of the year.
"Bottom line is that SNH, Welltower, VTR, HCP and other senior living REIT will need to make sure they do not overbuild. That is difficult. Part of inoculating the overbuilding for SNH is diversification in real estate, which is the direction they are now taking. IMO, buying now is the ground floor for future growth in both the company and the dividend"
Absolutely no news except that they announced the dividend payment. This should be good or neutral news depending on what your expectation for the dividend would be.No bad global news that would affect SNHno crazy tweets that would negatively impact the market as a whole.The price was driven up last week on no news and now it it is dropping on no news.Since this REIT had some bad news prior to the last dividend payment maybe investors still feel a little uneasy about it and someone is trying to take advantage of that nervousness to manipulate the price lower prior to the EX-date.Just seems odd that the price swung so much on no news.
"Glad I doubled up at 8 and didn't throw in the towel.....but still in the red by quite a bit. Thanks to DRIPing the dividend the pain is far less though.....just hope the price is legitimized by earnings and that it can continue its recovery. GL all, B"
"My guess on their 3rd quarter FFO was far off. I erred on the assumption that DHC would use its high rate debt to pay down their other debts that come due. They did only small portion, judging by the $15 million increase of their interest expenses during the 3rd quarter. Without consideration of increased operation expenses, this increased interest expense will cut the FFO by 30%. With added pandemic related cost, they soon will have trouble to cover their interest payment. Luckily, Pfizer’s vaccine news yesterday spells saving grace for DHC and other senior housing companies, not fully but partially. I do not see DHC will be able to re-instate their dividend any time soon until they pay off this ridiculous high rate debt."
"A significant day for DHC,- it is tremendous, they raised $1 billion. This completely dispel uncertainty about liquidity and stabilizes their business for the next few years. Although the rate is a bit high, but under the current extreme environment, it is only reasonable. Recall, Bank of America paid Warren 10% during the financial crisis.- remember that the bond can be paid down when additional divesture is done, and can be refinanced when overall economy improves. One important factor for depressed stock price is debt refinance uncertainty, now it is done for the next few years.-the end of day drop of stock price is mostly due to Mid cap400 fund rebalance. 23 million shares in the last 5 minutes! A good chance to buy, but was not fast enough.-with the $1 billion raised, the dividend will likely be re-installed soon, so will the stock price, which will right the price/book value (currently 0.3)"
"I expected the price of DHC to go down but not to the 1s. This is really starting to get interesting. Reputation matters, even at this price."
"A thought re DHC's cost overruns;According to DHC's 2019 annual report, target distribution rate was 80% of forward FFO and the major reason of the previous FVE's cost overruns was labor costs. Now, due to COVID-19, the additional costs overruns are derived from PPE and precautious preventive further actions. However, massive lay-offs are or will be happening and this mood of labor market, unfortunately, will prolong so long and the labor cost pressure will be diminished. REITS might not be a good asset to hold at this moment but I believe that REITS will be diffentiated and which one will be a winner among REITs?Seniors require senior living facilities at a certain stage of life and the demand is still sustainable after COVID-19. This means future move-ins and utilisation ratios will not be dramatically affected. If you were a family meber of seniors who need assistence, you knew the requirements very well.There are environments that cannot be done Work From Home. Labs and bio-tech offices are one of those, too. Costs pressure might be weakened, thus DHC can be ranked higher among other REITs, imho."
Who gets the impression that this restructuring announcement is only benefiting RMR outside managers who get to sign new long term management agreements in which they continue to make boatloads of money.
Diversified Healthcare reached a 52 Week low at 5.09
I still believe this is worth consideration if it goes under $2.00 per share.
"Post from Seeking Alpha - https://seekingalpha.com/article/4251200-senior-housing-properties-five-star-problemsAs a 15 year holder of SNH, it has paid back my original investment in dividends. I agree with Seeking Alpha that SNH will need to cut dividend - that is already priced in, so if they even do a 50% cut, the stock might actually go up. . .SNH need to find a new operator for these facilities, or sell them off for the property value."
Nice upward trend over the last six months with increasing revenues and earnings. It appears that the recovery is on track. Glad I took a spec on this at just under 8 bucks.
An SEC POSASR (Pose Effective Amendment) was filed today. I have no idea what it means.
I seem to be an expert at finding dogs.
1st quarter dividend is reduced to $0.01. https://www.dhcreit.com/news/press-release-details/2020/Diversified-Healthcare-Trust-Announces-Liquidity-Measures-to-Address-COVID-19-Impact/default.aspx
time to buy????
"The ffo they report should not be confused with fad. FFO does not include a deduction for maintenance capital which is about 50MM (.21 ps) annually. Since I do read the footnotes and I know that maintenance capital is not available for distribution, I always deduct it from ffo to get a good comparison of fad and div. Normalized fad for the last two yrs has been 1.38 and 1.37. I have always considered fad as their sustainable div not considering any other adverse factors."
Buy and hold way undervalued Imo
"One thing I noticied about the stocks, if the stock price goes down the day before reporting that is not good !"
"Some people here may be confusing the words ""SNH shareholders will receive Five Star shares"" with ""will receive FIVE Five Star shares"". I don't see where it's been said exactly how many shares we'll get."
"I know you guys are saying 6’s, but this thing IMO is bullish the next few days"
"Unrealized loss (could be unrealized gain by now), and impairment cost, shouldn't be a huge deal."
"So Me and My Mother were having a nice dinner in her country mansion in upstate New York. After dinner we were talking face to face and my mother ""cold-cocked"" me. She hit me in the face and broke my nose. Her grievance with me was that I was her financial advisor, and I put her all in to Portnoy stocks: GOV, SNH, then OPI and DHC. My mother is ruined and she will have to sell her country mansion. I am not filing charges for the broken nose, because I know darn well I'm a shnook and I had it coming."
sell at your peril; this stock will be at 25 before the end of 2017
Senior Housing just finished a $500 million bond offering(4.75% coupon Due in 2028). Their bond rating is Baa3/BBB- and their rating outlook hasn't changed since before 2014. I don't think Bankruptcy is in the near future.
Portnoy will always win; shareholders will always lose
"So it looks like we're all going to receive 5 shares of Five Star for every share of SNH you hold and the dividend going forward will be 6% at current levels. For everything to remain even, one would have to assume that the 5 shares are worth more than 1.00 over the next year.""SNH currently expects to pay an annual distribution of $0.55 to $0.65 per common share going forward, which is based on a target distribution payout ratio of approximately 80% of projected cash available for distribution in the future. This new distribution rate is expected to begin with SNH’s next regularly scheduled quarterly distribution announcement later this month."""
"this stock is still way down since covid, worst investment in my portfolio"
"I talked to investor services today. He said the drop today was due to a downgrade from one analysts. He gave me the impression that it’s very unlikely FVE will go under. He said FVE has options to shore up liquidity including selling properties to SNH in exchange for cash and rent concessions. This could hamper earnings in the short run, but add value in the long run. He said investors tirs with a year or more time frame could be rewarded. He said the industry is expected to turn much more positive in 12 months as the slowdown in construction results in less new inventory. He did say there was a possibility that rent concessions could result in a dividend cut because they are close to a 100% payout now."
"How can this company give out a 39 cent dividend , then the stock price goes up to $14.20 and then come out with a report like this? Give management bonuses and now the price could drop to $11 or less.. They have continued to give a 39 cent dividend for a long time. Is that going to change now because at $11.90 that 39 cent dividend is now 13.11%."
Financials seem positive. No insider buys at these levels feels off.
Today there is a good analysis of snh on Seeking Alpha that gives a lot of detail about why a div cut is probable.
"Brad Thomas has posted yet another negative article on seeking alpha about snh. I agree with most of his analysis except that he says no div cut is priced in. He also shows an anticipated div of about 1.25 but does not say where the number comes from. In any case, it is worthwhile to read the article and comments."
"Clears the Air - I posted earlier that I thought up to 50% div cut - and SNH could ""evict"" FVE - in essence they did! SNH now has a 75% state in FVE (we the stockholders) and FVE has gone from an ""owner operator"" to a management company. FVE would be allowed to manage other companies - similar to RMR. This may be a very good time to pick up more SNH at this price - still a 6.5% dividend or better if they don' cut a full 50%."
This is insane. Also agree with bling - 10% down pre- release BS that wasn't insider trading.
buy at your own risk ; dividend cut is a certainty but the Portnoy will still make tons of money while the shareholders get the shaft. Study up on RMR before you buy any stock it is involved in. imo My last posting. I have done all I can do
I have been following SNH for a while waiting for a buying opportunity finally pulled the trigger yesterday couldn't pass up the 10% dividend.
"Less than 1 hour ago I stated a clear FACT; that the Keystone pipeline was cancelled by executive order, it was erased from the message board. What kind of board representation; do we have as posters of true information, do we have going forward.

Glad that RBC gives us this heads up today. LOL ..."
Need our dividend back
"If Five Star Properties was failing before, why does anyone think it will do better now that SNH has took it over?"
"I bought SNH nearly 7 years ago. In the time I've owned it, through DRIPs, the number of shares I own have nearly doubled yet the value of my position is worth half what I paid for it. This during a time when the economy has been strong with both the stock market and property market going up.I'm reading so many comments below saying what a steal SNH is at this price, my question to those of you with this take is why? What's changed? Why now it's suddenly a good buy? Everything else I own or watch in the segment has done great over these past 7 years. NHI, OHI, UHT, VTR are all progressively up while paying a nice dividend. Why hasn't SNH done the same? My conclusion is the company is a dog, it can't do the same because it's mismanaged (at least for investors) and not worth investing in. Do we have new management? A new strategy? What's changed? What's the reason anyone should buy it?"
The CEO of Brookdale Senior Living (BKD) was on Power Lunch talking about it being a post pandemic play. Stock is up 16%. I hope some of it rubs off on DHC
"Disappointing is understatement in this case. Incompetent management is obvious. Dereliction of their fiduciary duty and cronyism are infuriating. This company is probably on its way to bankruptcy if no drastic actions taken soon. Their debt burden is crushing any hope of remaining value. I guess, there is an internal reason why they borrowed so much money at rate of 9.9% while their peers paying about 3%."
"This is a volatile stock, more so than Ventas, and Sabra. But its tremendous value proposition is undeniable. Assuming RMR and Portnoy do their jobs just ok, this stock is worthy a bet. Price/Book value of 0.2, P/FFO of just 2, it is flat fact. Debt refinancing under the current FED money supply policy should not be a concern. Their dividend cut was merely an insurance policy for liquidity."
"After reading the news I expect SNH dividend to be cut from current 1.56 to 1.04. So per Q .26. for the rest of this year. Then when the transaction is done in 2020 we will receive a share distribution. but the new norm will be $1.04 dividend IMHO. As we see in pre market some short term traders don't like it..., but longer term shareholders know that it needed to get done. So for now it is a hold on my current holdings and if it sells off to just below $10 I would add more."
Cramer 10% dividend red flag run.
"Well i hope this doesn't endanger RMR's ""business management incentive fee""."
Finally moving up.
Last dividend announcement was Oct. 18. Jan. 18 is just twelve trading days away.
"This is from the 8k comments please still hard to understandSimultaneous with the conversion of SNH’s existing agreements with Five Star into new management agreements with Five Star, SNH and SNH shareholders will receive Five Star common shares equal to approximately 85% ownership of Five Star in aggregate after taking into account SNH’s current ownership. As part of the transaction announced today, SNH shareholders will receive, by way of a distribution of the right to receive Five Star common shares from SNH and subject to certain conditions, Five Star common shares equal to approximately 51% ownership of Five Star post issuance, effective as of January 1, 2020. SNH will also increase its current 8.3% ownership of Five Star to approximately 34% post issuance. SNH currently plans to retain this ownership of Five Star for the foreseeable future."
"Less PPS, less div. Portnoy want income from management fee instead of div."
"Have been watching SNH from the sidelines, and waiting for an entry point."
I caught the falling knife @ 13.95 and again @ 13.90. It has not been this low since 2009 and seems to be a great div stock even if they cut the div as I assumed in my previous post. I guess the usual Portnoy discount accounts for what seems to be a bargain price.
"Is there something I am overlooking in this stock? It looks like a good buy with nearly a 10% dividend. It seems to be fairly sound financially but a declining stock price is a caution flag. I was talking to someone who said anything that pays 10% dividend something is wrong. However, if you bought at the right time within the last 365 days it would be considerably less. I am just looking for some opinions."

be careful with management here
Turned off dividend reinvest.
Nice up tick in 5 days up 5% almost to my average of $14.22 but with a 10% dividend I can't complain
"This is the definition of a value trap. How can a real estate company with allegedly $8b in assets and $4b in debt have a market value of $700m. Is this a scam? If so, it is a bold one.They cannot reinstate the dividend until they pay off the billion they borrowed at 10%. In this market if they sell, it will be at a loss. At this stage it would be better to be holding that debt than the stock. I wonder who the lucky guys are who hold it.Bad management. These guys should be taken to task."
"I have my new FVE shares, they must have changed the ex date, in press release on Dec 04th it said ex date was 1700 eastern 13 Dec 2019 now only paid in shares held as of 12-31-19"
DHC is up 5.28% to 3.79
Yeah I’m about to capitulate on this one after years of patience.
It's interesting how a stock can drop 20-30% on a overnight trading making it too late for the average investor to react on any negative announcement. Once the dividend cut will be officially announced this stock will sink like the titanic
What is this compensation they are talking are we getting FVE shares? This is the only thing that is keeping me from jumping off a bridge right now.
Something leak about the divvy?
"Bravo Jonathan from Raymond James for asking the obvious questions at the conference call this morning. His questions need to be raised again at the Annual meeting. Several of the board members have been presiding over this long slide in shareholder value for over a decade. Who's looking out for the shareholders? Who's comparing the performance of management with peers?This is case of colossal mismanagement and changes need to be made if we are to see a portion of our initial investments. As Jason suggested, sell the whole enchilada to someone who can manage it."
Biggest mistake of this year - the purchase of SNH stock
Please be clear people do we know how what exactly is the compensation to share holders of Snh in the special dividend. when will it be payed out is it 2020 Jan? will we recieve shares ? how many ? I dont see it in the conference call anyone ?
"The board and senior management have topped up on cheap options and promoted Francis for securing a 9.75% note when everyone else refinanced at 3-4%. The pillaging continues.Yes, they are milking DHC in fees."
Just stay away that would be my advice .
"Some key points from the 1Q20 report: - FFO of $0.29, vs $0.30 4Q19, a good operating result in light of the pandemic - its medical office biotech building segment performed really well, and that more than half of their business-senior housing segment held up reasonably well in face of impacts from the pandemic -debt payment is done for 2020, which is great news for removing liquidity concerns-with forward price/ffo of just 2.5, it could easily triple when the cloud clears."
"From the Business Wire article -SNH anticipates that it will need to lower its common share distribution rate in the future. SNH currently expects to pay an annual distribution of $0.55 to $0.65 per common share going forward, which is based on a target distribution payout ratio of approximately 80% of projected cash available for distribution in the future."
My first 10% dividend landed in my account today happy man.
"that fee of 40.7 million was JUST for senior housing; they got over 100 million in fees for snh , sir and hpt. And the purchase of 1.2 billion in properties by gov that they knew it could not afford but increased their management fees significantly since they are based on the value of property under management. And they had to know by using GOV to buy these properties would necessitate gov merging with .........well, what else, another of the reits RMR manages.....SIR. If anyone does the math you will see how screwed the shareholders of gov and sir were . Just assume you own one share of SIR and one of GOV. Snh dividend is 1.52 and that of sir was just a little over two dollars a year. Now it took 4 shares of sir to get one oip and also 4 shares of gov to get one oip. Opi dividend is 2.10 a year. So multiply 1.52x 4 and 2.00 by 4 and add them up: its approx 14 dollars; you gave that up for 2.10 a year. What a deal. The whole thing from the purchase of another big reit company's properties for 1.2 billion was the beginning of the game that ended with the numbers you see when you do the math. Great company that RMR. But dont believe me, do the math yourselves. RMR is run solely for management and that boils down to one person: Adam Portnoy ."
Results not as bad as headline number. Normalized ffo about same as 2017. Just bought more @ 11.86.
portnoy strikes again; I sold all my portnoy stocks after he screwed the shareholders of snh and its companion stock and pocket a ton of money. Just a complete sleazeball
"We are probably 3/4 of the way through this repositioning and clean up. I am just a bit baffled at this overreaction. Taking the long view, this is a great buying opportunity. By mid 2020, SNH will have debt levels down to a managable level and allow them to postion this REIT for growth. The pairing down of assets has been a plus long term. DRIP this for the next 10+ years and you will be rewarded."
Diversified Healthcare is up 18.17% to 4.59
they WILL cut the dividend....just my opinion; you should research RMR more closely
This stock is a dog with bad management - there are a lot of way better REITs out there paying monthly and stable with good mangement. Bail while there is still some value left.
"Have been in and out of this stock many times and followed this company for decades....It seems as long as the FFO (funds from operations) exceeds the dividend there was never a problem with maintaining the Divy,,, The part that I never quit understood was the incestuous relationship between the management co. and SNH...And how they get paid on total assets and not performance. It always looked like a whole bunch of cronyism going on ...or smoke and mirrors. But they always pay the Divy. The only thing that keeps me from getting back into this heavily is Managements silence with regards to their commitment to maintaining the Divy.. Per someone else's post...perhaps FVE assets will be bought on the cheep$$ by SHN and all's well that ends well..Management gets their fees and investors get their Divys...Those who have bought at these low prices will be well rewarded..But for now I think I'll sit back (probably regrettably) and watch the Sh-t show."
"Doug.....If you like I'll let you know when the next dividend is announced. If as I suspect you're a newbie, I would suggest you follow Mr. Buffett's advice, buy SPY or a comparable ETF. If you want a better dividend than the SPY there's VNQ. If exposure in healthcare properties is what you want there is always the niche ETF, OLD. In the mean time I would suggest you keep an eye on the Portnoy's, the long term returns speak for themselves. Disclosure, long SNH since 2002 spinoff."
"I was right with my post yesterday, nice 5 percent jump ! Did you notice Five star jump ,getting interesting !"
I do not see any potential upside here -- not as long as the current management is in place.
Back to FEB. 2009 LOW !!! That's 9 years LOW !!!
Was the fve spin-off another magic trick where we end up with nothing and portnoy gets everything?
"Well, did not expect DHC can go this far in a single day, but still significantly under valued even at this price. The billion dollar raised will give them so much flexibility, albeit at a bit high rate. $9 is probably the fair price for DHC given the low fed rate of 0%. However, if the management can move the divesture forward and pay down the debt, this is a $12 stock in a few months, that translate to a price/ ffo of 10 , and price/book of 0.8. Conservative numbers by many measures."
"Market is happy with results, price up while market down.. Next near target 8.5"
"100M in debt repayment; nice return on the sale. Little by little, this will get cleaned up."
"Was the stock price really as high as$40,000? Yahoo finance seems to be the only site that reports anywhere near that as a 52week high"
"With the quarterly results coming out in 3 days, Allow me to venture again to guess their FFO of $0.22, down from last quarter of $0.24. The decrease is due mainly to :(1)the high interest rate debt had a full impact on this quarterly results, but not by 10% rate because it was used to replace their pre-existing 7% debts. (2)continued pressure on occupancies, but not by much, and slight increase of operation cost because of the pandemic."
Will SNH survive as a REIT? Should I hold my shares? I was thinking of adding. Do you think this will be a good investment at this price? Any comments appreciated.
"Senior Housing Properties Trust declares $0.39/share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. Payable Feb. 21; for shareholders of record Jan. 28; ex-div Jan. 25."
"Good luck longs, closed out my hedge position on 5,000 shares today for a quick $2k. I knew FVE wasn't worth $1.70 more than DHC but I don't think this is going anywhere, anytime soon. I'm out!"
“will receive approximately 0.07 of a Five Star common share for each SNH common share held” What does this mean? Is it .35 per SNH based on 5-to-1 stock ownership? Is it .07 money or percentage of each outstanding FVE to SHN?
"Well, with the dividend no longer a factor, giving DHC some serious consideration may make sense if it goes under $2.00."
CC sounded positive but still have to be patient with this one.
Just a couple of years ago SNH was around $14.00. Keep an eye on the Portnoy's.
$8B REIT and paying just 1c divided.. whatever they did was a fiasco!
"It is noticeable during the last few days that the share price of DHC is relatively stable against the significant slide of SP500. Last Friday, more than 2.5 million shares trade with >5% gain in the last 5 minutes with similar pattern in the preceding days. It is likely that some institutional investors have noticed the value proposition in DHC. Here are the numbers that support this trend and thinking: ⁃ DHC has 50% business in medical office properties and biotech properties which are resilient in the current business environment and the impact of pandemic. The other 50% business in senior housing probably is affected marginally ( might be impacted by -3% in revenues this quarter ) ⁃ Comparatively, price/cash flow of DHC is only 3.5, vs PEAK’s 16, NHI’s 11. ⁃ The price/book value is even greater gap between them. DHC’s 0.38 vs PEAK’s 1.97, NHI’s 1.76. If everything else being equal, this means DHC’s asset is at >75% discount. In other words, DHC will rise 4 times to reach the fair valuation. ⁃ With the above numbers, the institutional investors probably is seeing the value of DHC including the existing institutional investors who have greater influence and control over Portnoy and his executives."
Good entry price in my opinion. Will add between $2.48-$3-50 for a long position.Glta
ever wonder why some postings are allowed to stay and others get buried quickly on this site??? some sort of guidelines?? dont ever criticize a company ???? I am thru with this site. Have nothing more to say anyway adios
"My question is related to the RMR incentive payment going forward. All RMR managed REITs are down >50% and far below any index. That should save SNH $70 million in cash going forward. But, RMR is crafty and will figure a way to recalculate their deal."
"just checking back .... yep, the share price still in the tanker"
Here’s my theory:RMR doesn’t care nearly as much about FVE with a market cap of $20M as they do SNH at $3B. They are transferring FVE’s strong balance to SNH over time by selling FVEs properties at a discount to SNH and keeping FVE afloat so they can continue to collect rents. SNH stated on the CC they want FVE to sell 10 more properties. Eventually they just buy out FVE at a bargain price and erase the problem of the troubled tenant while collecting a boat load of properties on the cheap. This propels SNH stock higher and therefore gets RMR’s performance based management fees back on track. This all happens right before the industry starts to take off with improving demographics.
Divdenend set at $.15 per share ($.60 per year)
The GOV/OPI debacle should have opened everyone's eyes here. It was just a matter of time.
"Heard that SNH shareholders will be receiving shares from Five Star 1/1/2020,How do they plan on distributing them based on our SNH shares?"
How is it that FVE was bailed out in essence by DHC and is now outperforming?
"A negative case: the Portnoy does not get the divesture done right, DHC’s business fluctuate at the current level ( a benefit of the doubt, after all, he is still a major shareholder of DHC, and industry veteran), Stock price will bounce around $7-$9 in the coming months"
there are many other Reits in the market with less debt to equity. Also wait till they sell all those properties that are not doing well you will get a few losses here and there. yield on a clean up like that cannot be 5 to 6 percent . should be 9 percent to make it worth it.
"Joseph France from Cantor Fitzgerald maintained a Buy rating on Senior Housing Properties Trust (NYSE: SNH), with a price target of $21."
"This is a bad situation, but the changes had to be made. The big question moving forward is will they contain management costs? If you think RMR or the Portnoys are just going to raid the company, sell now and move on. All the bad news is out at this point, so it should at least allow you to make your decision knowing all the facts."
SNH and FVE share the same management. It appears that FVE is failing as a viable company. Let's hope that SNH management is solely trying to benefit SNH shareholders with this restructuring and not trying to rescue their own position in FVE.
Well this is just great .01 cent. Why not just go to 0?
I am a Certified Financial Advisor. I advise Old Ladies to invest their life savings in Portnoy Companies. I tell them these companies pay lots of income. I charge these Old Ladies very high fees for that advice.
Down 1-2 % a day until they cut the dividend. Then a 10-20% plunge will be the bottom.
Next week tells all
Why should snh hold 10? They have said the div for the rest of this yr will be .55-.65 ps. They will sell almost $1 billion of loosing properties and probably incur losses in the process. They will have their plate full just handling the fve transactions so I don't see much else happening. Where will upside surprise come from. We know the market prices in a Portnoy discount so the yield will be above comparable companies. I just can not see how it will trade above 10 so I sold today. I took a huge loss on a lot of shares but can only blame myself for not thinking snh could go the way of gov.
Dividend announcement should be coming this week. Last one was Oct. 18.
Is there any more room for it to fall further to ?
"The Dividend cut was expected. Management is doing a pretty good job but would could do much better. They need to sell off non performing assets and consolidate their massive debt by paying it down with sales of the non performing assets and renegotiate the the debt to lower interest rates or issue Bonds to get the bank to more reasonable terms. where they can, expand their performing assets and increase the revenue. I am in agreement that if they break the two level I would consider adding. I say consider only because there are a lot better companies with much better balance sheets for a great price right now. Many being in the oil industry. JMHO."
"correction 85 percent of Five Star is approximately 25.5 million dollars .25.5 million divided by 200 million SNH shares , which means you will receive 12.5 cents VALUE of shares of five star or less. that does not ease the pain at all ..."
"There are still several ways the Portnoys can completely bone the shareholders of FVE while profiting for themselves without doing irreparable harm to SNH or the Portnoy interest in RMR. The Portnoys are wizards, no stone left unturned."
Market cap should be higher based on assets and debt bit apparently you have to subtract billions more (like debt) because Portnoy has his fingers in the pie. All who have taken a piece of Portnoy pie historically have got food poisoning instead of a good dividend!
