"From the CC transcriptBryan MaherRight. And seeing that we have a little bit of time, let me just ask you maybe a big picture question. The Vertex Pharmaceutical headquarters and let's just say, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Towers in L.A. I mean they're a big part of your NOI at this point, and those are just whale of assets.And what do you think the Street is missing when they look at the portfolio? It seems like there's so much noise related to the SHOP component of the business that it seems like the Street and investors are maybe not giving you credit for kind of the supertankers in their portfolio. How do you think about that when talking to investors and trying to convey the story?Jennifer FrancisIt's a really good point, Bryan. I spend a lot of time trying to talk about our MOB and life sciences portfolio. And while you talk about those 2 assets which, obviously, are premier assets, really well located, great tenant base in those. The rest of our portfolio is also very strong. We've been consistently over 92% occupied in our same-store portfolio. We've got Torrey Pines. We've got assets in - life sciences assets in Boston and San Francisco and San Diego. It's a strong portfolio.I don't know what people are missing. And it's why I try to spend a lot of time talking about that portfolio. Senior living is the topic of choice, certainly, but we'll continue to get out and try to convey the strength of that portfolio.Francis has her work cut out for her convincing investors of the value of this portfolio. So far she has not succeeded."
"With the quarterly results coming out in 3 days, Allow me to venture again to guess their FFO of $0.22, down from last quarter of $0.24. The decrease is due mainly to :(1)the high interest rate debt had a full impact on this quarterly results, but not by 10% rate because it was used to replace their pre-existing 7% debts. (2)continued pressure on occupancies, but not by much, and slight increase of operation cost because of the pandemic."
Who gets the impression that this restructuring announcement is only benefiting RMR outside managers who get to sign new long term management agreements in which they continue to make boatloads of money.
"On March 11, 2019, we entered into a letter agreement with SNH, pursuant to which, with respect to those certain Amended and Restated Master Lease Agreements, Nos. 1-5, or the Master Leases, among certain of our subsidiaries and certain of SNH’s subsidiaries, SNH agreed to defer, until March 31, 2019, payment of the aggregate Minimum Rent (as defined in the Master Leases) due and payable by us to SNH under the Master Leases for February 2019. This is on an 8k just filed by Five Star."
"This restructuring had to be done; it bolsters FVE's ability to be an ongoing concern (reduces debt load), moves SNH's dividend to much lower, but also easily covered. This should allow for much more positive growth down the road. Also, SNH is moving to reduce debt load too. Based on the overhang of bad news, the final result will be much more positive than I thought would happen. The restructuring benefits both shareholder bases and puts both companies in a much better financial situation. Yes, the dividend cut is the worst part..."
"News of so many Covid vaccine coming in couple of months, Should not that help DHC? Their operation cost due to Covid should reduce greatly next year. Hope they reinstate dividend soon"
"You know, I just have to complain a bit. I labored over the decision over what reit to purchase and went back and forth between SNH, OHI, and O. Decided to go with SNH earlier this year. Yes, I know, diversify. Still, I just wanted to complain. Thanks for listening."
"It is noticeable during the last few days that the share price of DHC is relatively stable against the significant slide of SP500. Last Friday, more than 2.5 million shares trade with >5% gain in the last 5 minutes with similar pattern in the preceding days. It is likely that some institutional investors have noticed the value proposition in DHC. Here are the numbers that support this trend and thinking: ⁃ DHC has 50% business in medical office properties and biotech properties which are resilient in the current business environment and the impact of pandemic. The other 50% business in senior housing probably is affected marginally ( might be impacted by -3% in revenues this quarter ) ⁃ Comparatively, price/cash flow of DHC is only 3.5, vs PEAK’s 16, NHI’s 11. ⁃ The price/book value is even greater gap between them. DHC’s 0.38 vs PEAK’s 1.97, NHI’s 1.76. If everything else being equal, this means DHC’s asset is at >75% discount. In other words, DHC will rise 4 times to reach the fair valuation. ⁃ With the above numbers, the institutional investors probably is seeing the value of DHC including the existing institutional investors who have greater influence and control over Portnoy and his executives."
Why should snh hold 10? They have said the div for the rest of this yr will be .55-.65 ps. They will sell almost $1 billion of loosing properties and probably incur losses in the process. They will have their plate full just handling the fve transactions so I don't see much else happening. Where will upside surprise come from. We know the market prices in a Portnoy discount so the yield will be above comparable companies. I just can not see how it will trade above 10 so I sold today. I took a huge loss on a lot of shares but can only blame myself for not thinking snh could go the way of gov.
“will receive approximately 0.07 of a Five Star common share for each SNH common share held” What does this mean? Is it .35 per SNH based on 5-to-1 stock ownership? Is it .07 money or percentage of each outstanding FVE to SHN?
$8B REIT and paying just 1c divided.. whatever they did was a fiasco!
"Post from Seeking Alpha - https://seekingalpha.com/article/4251200-senior-housing-properties-five-star-problemsAs a 15 year holder of SNH, it has paid back my original investment in dividends. I agree with Seeking Alpha that SNH will need to cut dividend - that is already priced in, so if they even do a 50% cut, the stock might actually go up. . .SNH need to find a new operator for these facilities, or sell them off for the property value."
Current yield is 7.1%. Not enough Portnoy discount for me. Lots of safer 8% yields around run by folks that take care of shareholders and not just themselves!!
"The biggest drag on this company has been the Long Term Care segment. When Covid hit, nobody wanted to put their loved ones in any facility, especially since they were working from home and could take care of them and save a lot of money. I know because I own an Assisted Living Center. We went from a continuous waiting list to several open rooms very quickly. We are now back to a waiting list. People going back to work, and they are getting more comfortable with LTC facilities. The LTC portion of this company is probably making a big turnaround!"
"Jennifer, you really needs to do a whole lot more... for this is looking more like, as reflected by the declining share price, a dog with fleas, than a valuable, well situated healthcare REIT."
"This is from the 8k comments please still hard to understandSimultaneous with the conversion of SNH’s existing agreements with Five Star into new management agreements with Five Star, SNH and SNH shareholders will receive Five Star common shares equal to approximately 85% ownership of Five Star in aggregate after taking into account SNH’s current ownership. As part of the transaction announced today, SNH shareholders will receive, by way of a distribution of the right to receive Five Star common shares from SNH and subject to certain conditions, Five Star common shares equal to approximately 51% ownership of Five Star post issuance, effective as of January 1, 2020. SNH will also increase its current 8.3% ownership of Five Star to approximately 34% post issuance. SNH currently plans to retain this ownership of Five Star for the foreseeable future."
The history of this company goes back 20 years and have never cut the dividend I’m assuming they have had challenges in the past so I’m staying positive and confident they will be able to bridge any conflicts
Listen to the call. SNH recieves 260 million shares of Five Star. Per this web site SNH has 237 million shares outstanding or slightly over one share per one share This will return aprox sixty cents per share against today’s loss in value of 2.00 and a future annual dividend loss of approx $1.00;per share per annum. While SNH had little choice in doing something to rescue Five Star the future outlook does not sound good. President open the call citing all of the reasons that Five Star is in trouble..then going forward in the call none of these issues are addressed as relaxing. A lot of “ hope” for the future which is kinda what you would expect. I under water about 18k and can’t see it getting a lot better. 
"Some people here may be confusing the words ""SNH shareholders will receive Five Star shares"" with ""will receive FIVE Five Star shares"". I don't see where it's been said exactly how many shares we'll get."
Since Richard and Jennifer received healthy slugs of low cost options each hopefully it will impel them to discuss plans of repaying the 9.75% billion dollar loan. This will release funds to pay a halfway decent dividend.
"The ffo they report should not be confused with fad. FFO does not include a deduction for maintenance capital which is about 50MM (.21 ps) annually. Since I do read the footnotes and I know that maintenance capital is not available for distribution, I always deduct it from ffo to get a good comparison of fad and div. Normalized fad for the last two yrs has been 1.38 and 1.37. I have always considered fad as their sustainable div not considering any other adverse factors."
"My question is related to the RMR incentive payment going forward. All RMR managed REITs are down >50% and far below any index. That should save SNH $70 million in cash going forward. But, RMR is crafty and will figure a way to recalculate their deal."
"Well, it seems the insiders are holding, so that is a positive. I would love to know if they are refinancing that 9.75% loan, Anyone? I am down 26% on my stake, so I added a little more."
What they did Iam not sure they will recover from they took 1/2 the stock value and destroyed the dividend. management really you shouldn't get one dime. zero
8.2 billion in real-estate- 1 billion market cap almost all losses are depreciation of real-estateboomers moving into facilities soon creating a growth market cheapest stock cheapest REIT best value I know ofi vote ten per share this time next year....
"Some key points from the 1Q20 report: - FFO of $0.29, vs $0.30 4Q19, a good operating result in light of the pandemic - its medical office biotech building segment performed really well, and that more than half of their business-senior housing segment held up reasonably well in face of impacts from the pandemic -debt payment is done for 2020, which is great news for removing liquidity concerns-with forward price/ffo of just 2.5, it could easily triple when the cloud clears."
"This is the definition of a value trap. How can a real estate company with allegedly $8b in assets and $4b in debt have a market value of $700m. Is this a scam? If so, it is a bold one.They cannot reinstate the dividend until they pay off the billion they borrowed at 10%. In this market if they sell, it will be at a loss. At this stage it would be better to be holding that debt than the stock. I wonder who the lucky guys are who hold it.Bad management. These guys should be taken to task."
"Here’s my conspiracy theory:RMR is using FVE as a sacrificial lamb to move their properties into SNH for cheap prices. FVE is losing money so fast that they could be out of business in six quarters. So that puts us at mid 2020 when the industry could be in the midst of a strong rebound. Then SNH would just need new operators to fill the FVE void or self manage. That’s a challenge, but you have purchased a lot FVE assets below value. FVE only has $8M in debt so it’s not as if there are creditors that are going to get the 20 properties. Maybe they just hand them over to SNH in lieu of rental contracts in chapter 11 and get absorbed by SNH. I just think RMR holds the cards here and will serve their own interests which they have a history of doing. That interest is to make sure SNH thrives so they can collect big management fees. It may be a short term pain for long term gain scenario."
"A positive case for DHC: The dividend cut is temporary for 3-6 months. FFO stays at $1.20/yr (30cents last quarter) and dividend at $0.60/yr. Its business should not be affected much by the current pandemic (medical and biotech buildings -50%; senior living -50%). Stock price in the coming months, $8 - $10 (price/FFO ratio of 7). If the divesture goes through and leverage cut down, and its 80% owned FVE contributes to its FFO growth to $1.50, and dividend raised to $1.20 (80% of FFO, industry common practice), then the stock price will go to $12-15 ( P/ffo ratio of 8). That will right its book value dislocation."
"Had to sell. 2300 shares that I had for many years, like saying goodbye to an old friend."
Senior Housing just finished a $500 million bond offering(4.75% coupon Due in 2028). Their bond rating is Baa3/BBB- and their rating outlook hasn't changed since before 2014. I don't think Bankruptcy is in the near future.
"Closing the door after the horse has left the barn ... ""RBC Capital markets downgrades Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH -1.7%) to Underperform from Sector Perform and slash its stock PT to $8 from $13 saying he is ""incrementally more cautious"" after the company entered into restructuring arrangement with Five Star Senior Living and announced a dividend cut."" Glad that RBC gives us this heads up today. LOL ..."
Portney did wonders for GOV.
DHC is up 5.28% to 3.79
"How can this company give out a 39 cent dividend , then the stock price goes up to $14.20 and then come out with a report like this? Give management bonuses and now the price could drop to $11 or less.. They have continued to give a 39 cent dividend for a long time. Is that going to change now because at $11.90 that 39 cent dividend is now 13.11%."
DHC is down 5.24% to 3.62
"just checking back .... yep, the share price still in the tanker"
"Senior Housing Properties Trust declares $0.39/share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. Payable Feb. 21; for shareholders of record Jan. 28; ex-div Jan. 25."
will this reach 12 dollars ?
The company may want to skip the reduced dividend. It just reminds share holders that the company is not yet normal and act to sell the stock.
