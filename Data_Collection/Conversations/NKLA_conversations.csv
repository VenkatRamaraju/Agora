CNHI has Iveco up for disposal/sale. Not a sign of a bright future.
Have there been any published comparisons between the Iveco Tre and the Mercedes eActros that are already being delivered to customers? Nikola must be bringing a lot of competitive advantages to Iveco being so late to market.

Has CNHI disposed of Iveco yet? Does anyone know or care as NKLA's only future hope is with Iveco- a company nobody seems to want because it has no intellectual property and too much real competition.
"Juicy, juicy, juicy play here.."
"If Iveco was so good why would CNH keep trying to get rid if it. Maybe because it has no potential against real competition with superior intellectual property. Nothing has changed since the Reuters' news release below. Maybe NKLA should have bid for Iveco once the Chinese lost interest.MILAN, April 19 (Reuters) - Shares in CNH Industrial were down more than 4% after the vehicle and equipment maker said on Saturday it had ended talks to sell truck maker Iveco to China’s FAW Jiefang .CNH Industrial said it was continuing to pursue a spinoff of the group in early 2022.Iveco is part of CNH Industrial, which in turn is controlled by Exor, the holding company of Italy’s Agnelli family. CNH said in January it was in talks with China’s FAW over the future of the truck maker.Italian Industry Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti on Saturday welcomed the end of talks.CNH shares are down 4.4% at 12.64 euros around 0745 GMT."

"398 million shares, 31% short= 120 million shares / 12 million adv= short interest ration of 10. Very dangerous for shorts."
"This is from the most recent article on NKLA from IBD:Nikola Stock: Is A Short Covering Rally Under Way?Short interest in Nikola is still elevated and rising.According to MarketSmith data on NKLA's weekly chart, it would take 5 times the stock's average daily volume of 12.3 million shares to cover all open short-sale positions.Put another way, short interest of 61 million shares comprises almost 22% of the entire float. So, if a powerful rebound arises on a change in perception regarding the company's future, more short sellers may feel pressure to buy back shares and cover their positions.Think of short interest as nitro fuel for a strong stock. This could give NKLA stock a further boost."

Is there a way to turn a phony truck into something real? The brand damage is probably the most problematic. They will have to raise more capital and Trevor still has 70 million shares to dump. I don't see how this can possibly stay over $2 before completely folding.
how long can they last selling trucks at a loss?

It?s refreshing seeing who I?m betting against lmfao. Reddit sub even funnier. Holding and accumulating 5$ nov and 2.5 Jan puts. Million ways for this #$%$ company to go sub 1B by then. Imo any surprise taper or rate jumps and this takes a 50% cut overnight. Ev semis aren?t feasible until battery tech gets stronger?this company won?t win. May start buyin the 2023 puts soon too
the question keeps coming who is buying the stock. the answer evidently is large mutual funds are holding on the stock. Maybe they know something you don't know.
