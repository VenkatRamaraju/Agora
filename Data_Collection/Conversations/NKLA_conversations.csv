"If Iveco was so good why would CNH keep trying to get rid if it. Maybe because it has no potential against real competition with superior intellectual property. Nothing has changed since the Reuters' news release below. Maybe NKLA should have bid for Iveco once the Chinese lost interest.MILAN, April 19 (Reuters) - Shares in CNH Industrial were down more than 4% after the vehicle and equipment maker said on Saturday it had ended talks to sell truck maker Iveco to China’s FAW Jiefang .CNH Industrial said it was continuing to pursue a spinoff of the group in early 2022.Iveco is part of CNH Industrial, which in turn is controlled by Exor, the holding company of Italy’s Agnelli family. CNH said in January it was in talks with China’s FAW over the future of the truck maker.Italian Industry Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti on Saturday welcomed the end of talks.CNH shares are down 4.4% at 12.64 euros around 0745 GMT."
"Their job posts for the Arizona Factory indicates they won't only sell IVECO trucks, some serious developments are coming!"
"MM will keep it here until a little later, and then.....another dam short squeeze!!!!"
CNHI has Iveco up for disposal/sale. Not a sign of a bright future.
When CNHI gets rid of Iveco will the new company sell NKLA parts or will the new owner have the acumen to see no benefit in the relationship?
Guarantee there is a report about Milton selling more stock coming out by Monday.

Has CNHI disposed of Iveco yet? Does anyone know or care as NKLA's only future hope is with Iveco- a company nobody seems to want because it has no intellectual property and too much real competition.
