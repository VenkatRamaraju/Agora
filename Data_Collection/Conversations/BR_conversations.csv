"Everyone likes to talk about what Berkshire Hathaway might acquire next... TBuffett loves moaty financial services with strong free cash flow. So to that I say, why not Broadridge? Not necessarily saying I want this to happen, but as an owner of both Berkshire and Broadridge, I think it's a good fit."
"Thge change in accounting procedure really was the big reason for the negative numbers; however, thoses revenues will be booked in the second half of 2019 so those numbers will be in line or better. Still, this is quite a hit to the stock. Hopefully, investors will see a bargain and start buying in a few days."
"Hearing some great things about this stock... however I don't know a good time to buy, waiting on dip.. any advice ?"
Almost Quadruple volume on an UP day....breakout coming??
Why up? I'll take it but ...

"I think we're on the next leg up to 140...hopefully a lot slower this time and at a more relaxed pace. Don't want to attract momentum players or shorts, right? Good luck to all."
More good news today with BR leading the way toward totally paperless voting and mutual fund reporting requirements; everyone will have to adopt this within two years so load up now while you can.
"Volume on BR continues to be pathetic; investors wary, but on the other hand, no one is really selling large amounts at these levels...."

Broadridge: A Dominant FinTech Firm Hiding In Plain Sighthttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4246279-broadridge-dominant-fintech-firm-hiding-plain-sight
Broadridge IMO is the best Fintech play in the market. The general retail investor is not yet aware of Broadrige but I believe they soon will be. Huge upside potential with their progressive growth rate!
"I love the new “ESG” Advisory Services offered by BROADRIDGE FINANCIAL SERVICES, $BR. About 75% of Institutional Investors are “ESG” types... so this is a major investment trend worldwide! ... $BR is about as solid as it gets! BUY & HOLD $BR (Do not sell). Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: BR), a $4.5 billion global Fintech leader, is a leading provider of investor communications and technology-driven solutions to banks, broker-dealers, asset and wealth managers and corporate issuers. Broadridge's infrastructure underpins proxy voting services for over 50 percent of public companies and mutual funds globally, and processes on average more than U.S. $10 trillion in fixed income and equity securities trades per day. Broadridge is part of the S&P 500 Index and employs over 12,000 associates in 17 countries."
Broadridge Financial reached an all time high at 179.98
"Looks like the market has reevaluated and digested the news on the CC; moving up and should continue to do so, although there will be ups and downs along the way."
"Disappointing quarter, but doesn't change my view of the company/stock long term. Going to let this settle a bit before deciding next step, hold existing position or add more. Recurring revenue increased nicely, so see no reason to exit my position. My current cost basis is right around $97. Good luck BR longs!"
Excellent investment and there ain't no interest on this board. That's a good thing!
"We just keep grinding higher and higher, no matter the headlines - gotta love it!"
The numbers look good - no surprises and raised guidance goijng forward....I like it!
Big article in yesterdays NY Newday about BR....the company nobody has ever heard of but which dominates proxy voting for the entire financial world....very positive.
Good ol' Broadridge... like clockwork. Thank you.
Good ol' Broadridge.
We're getting added to the S&P500....huge fund buying on the way.
I'm here... and I'm a big BR fan.
"sold after last earnings, and watched the stock go up well over my sell price. I consider this a gift, got back in. I hope i'm not missing something...but volume really isn't extreme so ....... Anyone have any insight or spec on the stk price drop? or is it just that the fintechs are under a little pressure lately?"
Is this an example of Broadridge's advancements with Blockchain Ledger?https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200210005230/en/
Great earnings numbers - gonna be a good day!
"The products Broadridge provides to asset managers are essential in times of market volatility like we're seeing today. Fantastic company whose products are essential for their customers, especially in highly volatile markets like we're seeing today. Good luck BR longs!"
"Over 44% of BR is held by INSIDERS; there is a vested interest in the company's continued success. I'm very bullsih - no real competition, blockchain technology and a virtual lock on proxy voting...."
"OK, gang, why the hell are we down so much? NOT a tech (yeah, fintech, OK), not FANG, and not a bank....I guess an ebbing tide really does lower all ships after all; I'm not a chartist but I'm going to look for a good entry point - maybe the mid to high teens."
Read the whole CC and there's really a LOT to be optimistic about going forward. They have a solid command of their area with almost no competition and they are utilizing blockchain and digital platforms to help companies cut costs....buy on the dips.
BR reached a new All Time High at 93.62
"Today's performance makes no sense. Its numbers beat expectations. Of course, this is Wall Street, so you have to deal with fickle investors.Still, I like this company's core financials and approach. Maybe it's a good time to jump back in on the dip."
It takes a little time but it has gone up steadily both times after disappointing....be patient.
"Rare news out of Broadridge yesterday, acquiring Itiviti for $2.5B all cash. While the deal looks somewhat pricey at 10x revenue, I like the fact the majority of that revenue is outside the U.S. which will help diversify BR's revenue base outside the U.S.. I like, but don't love the deal."
"If this market wasn't so negative because of the trade war - this stock would be over 125 right now on fantastic numbers and growth going forward. They have NO competition and are aquiring companies and technologies which will give them a LOCK in their niche for a long, long time. This stock is my biggest position and I am very comfortable riding the ups and downs because I know when I look at this chart 5 years from now it will look like a 45 degree angle, pointing NNE....good luck to all."
Broadridge Financial reached an all time high at 182.75
Tableau software and Raymond James news just more pieces of the puzzle being assembled to make this a $200+ stock in a few years....buy now on the dips!!
