"Yeah ! as I told you, new schedule out...raising Divi to .075 or 7% and a merry Xmas ..09 cent special payout in Dec !!"
Does anyone have an idea why the sell off the last few days. Appears earnings report was okay.
"trying hard to take out $12 but a resistance level. Maybe next week for X dividend. Once thru 12 projects back to old highs ! In the meantime, just collect the appreciated monthly !"
"Soooooooooooooooooooooo, Stock goes up without news. Hmmmmmmmmmm"
Closed my position today after 3 mos 22.6% Cap Gain & 2.7% DIV for total ~25.3% 3mo..(100% annually)Thank you David Gladstone....I will be back.
"Please don't vote to allow the company to issue shares below net assets value. That benefits only management, not you."
no buyers today...just drifting lower and lower..ugh
maybe a little overpriced now.
Capital is now being returned to the shareholder. This is a sell.
"Not sure why would they “Sold 168,824 shares of common stock under our at-the-market program at a weighted-average net price of $10.87 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $1.8 million.” $10.87 is even lower than the book value!!!"
Let’s go GAIN! Climb another $1 and I will jump out so fast it will make your head spin!
X div tommorow...
Special dividend recieved today !
"It is worth $13.50 right here, right now."
sigh
"Why is this up over 2% on no news? Don’t mind it just curious, did I miss an upgrade?"
beautiful down adjustment
she wants 10 !!
How much is the dividend per share each month? I have over a thousand shares and I only received about 10$ I was expecting 70$ total dividend for the month! Why so little???
"In last CC...David Gladstone litteraly cut of an analyst saying...""We won't cut the dividend , it's the very last thing we would do ""..I trust David Gladstone. I think this quarter will be better than last.."
nice solid beat all around ! onward and a solid new entry point for income investors
"pretty good volume today, don't see any bad news here but obviously some selling. looking for a run to 11 for earnings. Which I think will be a beat with their lower interest refinancing moves and a profitable sale. Meanwhile we get paid a solid 8% or so to be patient."
"All aboard ! GAIN declares April,May and June divi Plus a Special June divi !!..so two in June !!"
Year end market action giving me a reason to buy.
No activity on this board. Gain has been on fire and the dividends are much appreciated.
3 dividends coming in the next 45 days or so !!
GAIN is down 8.40% to 7.63
got a div. today was that the second?
GAIN is up 5.80% to 9.43
they had the meeting on the 20th? I assume all went well?
"If their financial statements are honest and accurate, this company is a cash machine."
I trimmed a little of my position because this has been quite the run without a lot of information or results to back it up. Still my #3 position behind a market blend ETF and a preferred stock. The dividend coverage is better than management had let on for the past few quarters and now looks like the semi-annual dividend is covered as well. This should settle in around $12.50 - 13.25 and then volatility should drop out of the stock at which point it’s a 7.5% dividend stock to hold forever.
Almost 20 percent discount to NAV
payday tommorow for Gain shareholders
"I understand that a stocks price normally drops on the ex date by the dividend amount, all other things being equal. My question is, when a stock offers a special dividend, like GAIN does in December, can we expect to see the same for the special ex date?"
certainly is volatile. I guess the $35 million in new stock has finished selling. All sold above net asset value.
Gonna make money if it passes $10.75...question is how long to hold???
From now on i will collect this stock.
GAIN is up 4.93% to 12.02
GAIN is up 7.50% to 7.60
based on value of assets in GAINs portfolio fair value is actually $15. that's all most a 100% increase from current prices. I'm amazed share price has sunk this low. however low interest rates until 2023 is not a good sign for lenders like GAIN. if next earnings report shows EPS can cover the dividend then imo this is a huge buying opportunity at 10% yield!
"Share price of sale on December 16th 2019 were $ 14.84. The NAV is $ 12. 39. Sale was way above NAV. 35,000,000 shares to be sold."
Gladstone is down 9.51% to 9.90
Large move up today for no apparent reason.
Biggest position I hold. Reinvest dividends - set it and forget it.
double up my position or take the money and run . That is the question
Nice area to pick up some shares. I bought some today.
GAIN is down -5.06% to 10.70
"Sweet, another pay raise."
"Log term investment,, buy on dips, reinvest dividends, been in since 2008, have been doing the same with GLAD."
wants $10 ....getting there...
Is it normally always .07 a share?
Next new money buy orders are at $5. I think too it’s time to start bouncing of the lows and highs to compound the amount of shares I own. Selling rips and buying dips.
"see the notice of the deemed distribution of capital gains that came out this afternoon. I did not know that was an option for a BDC, I would rather have the cash but it is what it is. A $1.52 cap gain per share is nothing to sneeze at."

Small sell off today before earnings on above average volume. Boy people are fearful. Tomorrow should be interesting.
Has anyone been holding their preferred shares?
Anyone have some insight into the surge in price?

"nothing, and I mean nothing drives a stocks price down like an earnings report, good or bad."
"I am expecting a little weakness here, not because of anything related to performance but because of market rotation as investors redeploy to Asia and Europe. We might see as low as $11.30 next week. Buyers be ready. Holders stay in the game."
does anybody know why gain is down?
Have you seen the amount of insider buying? It’s insanely high and nobody sold this year

Does anyone know why GAIN is down so much today? No News?
I wanna start building into dividend stocks this one looks like a pick might wait for it to go down a pit before picking up shares what you guys think?
I was expecting a supplemental distribution. They have a large realized capital gain. Maybe anticipating some realized losses.

Monthly dividend recieved
GAIN is up 5.05% to 9.87
Don't no much about tis company I bought my shares 3 months ago and already accumulated 16.5 extra shares by reinvesting my dividend...pretty cool.!!!
Gain updated next 3 dividends plus special #$%$�e payout !! Can't ask for much more in these times
Maybe @ $12.5 i will get in. I am not touching this until things settle down or at least the company makes a positive announcement.
Is GAIN still paying $0.07 a share? I sold my 400 shares awhile back. Thinking of coming back in......
dividend  received...
"JB needs to split this before it’s too late. Amazon seldom gains more than 4%. Investors look at $gain as opposed to %gain. Amazon deserves minimum 4K value based on the market gains.

GAIN is down 5.11% to 11.32
This thing is a juggernaut for dividend income...
The single best monthly dividend paying stock available. And it’s trading at a discount to what I assume to be fair value at $13.50
Thank you Mr. Gladstone
yeah as I told y'all...! nice solid .4 cent beat on earnings and 5.13 mill on revenue !!

I guest nobody check this board
Anyone know a reason for the daily decline in share price. I cannot find any bad news.
Thanks
did we have earning yet??
Finally some action on the board but it’s mostly Bots. This thing is turning around and recovering most of its recent losses. Hold for the long term growth and dividend reinvestment.

Filed 8K and 497 on 12/19. Possible offering in the works?
x dividend tommorow the 19 I believe
Zack's finally decided to being fools and raised their views on GAIN and raised the outdated opinion from a sell with a $9 target to a buy and a $12 target. They also got Valuengine's wrong with a buy when they just put a news article out yesterday giving them a strong buy. What is wrong with Zack's?
What ? plus +.73 cents in pre market... that's crazy...
New 52 week highs...congrats to longs...new highs and a nice Divi !! Thank you Mr Gladstone

unloaded a chunk today and will wait for spo pricing
Divi pay day...thanks a GAIN !
"I don't know why we had a big drop this morning, but I bought a bunch of shares @ $11.01. I'll take a pay raise."
This thing headed to $14
GAIN could be back to $13 by the end of April.
What is the difference between the ticker symptoms GAIN and GAINM? GAINM doesn't have any volatility. It's stuck at ~26 in perpetuity.
GAIN is down 5.01% to 10.04
The conference call was very positive. I wouldn't be surprised to see a special dividend announcement on top of the monthly dividend mid to later year. Long GAIN
"I own about 600 shares of Gain @ a cost basis around 10/ShareThis thing has just been slow bleeding for the past 3-4 months. However, the dividend is remaining consistent. Any thoughts on what is driving the stock down? Just anticipation they won't meet forecasts coming up on the 3rd?"
Insiders are buying this quarter.
Gladstone exits Head Country with a significant profit....love this well run company.
new divi schedule as I said would happen today and another special payout in Sept...love GAIN
"I’m sure most of you are feeling much better.Buying at low 8’s would have been nice, but there was quite a lot of skepticism."
"Exited my entire position......BDC's and REITS are overpriced now, and it's time to get out. One of my strict criteria for selling a stock is that when my capital gain meets or exceeds an entire years worth of dividends, I lock that gain in. That way, I've locked in a years worth of dividends and can sit back and wait to buy for at least a year at a higher yield, which happens 99.9% of the time. I'm going to wait for GAIN to come back down to earth now, and my entry point to start buying back in under $7.85, which is the current midpoint of the 52 week price range. My advice right now is take your profit, but alas I know there are those who will hang on just a wee bit too long, and miss out on the capital gains they could have had. To each his own though, and I can't fault anyone for wanting to hang on to such a steady dividend payer...I just prefer to work both sides of the fence and take the capital gains when they come, knowing the price will come down sooner or later."
3 times the daily volume....new leg up
Hmmm gain seems to be driving lower? What’s happening ?
Shares are off because of the interest rate increases seen over the past couple months. People are not taking revenue growth and reduced tax benefits into consideration. Sure there will be pressure from interest rates but I think they are more than offset by more distributable earnings power. Ultimately they will be loaning money at higher interest rates to companies better able to repay those loans because of their own tax reductions and increased business activity in the economy in general.

I bought in7 years ago at $9 per share. Dividends and honest bet and gross figures reap the reward
earnings to be reported this month.
200 shares @ $9.99 average. I know it is not much but its what I can afford right now.
Rough week… the silver lining is more shares from the special dividend reinvestment. In for the long haul.
"Look for a new Divi schedule / out sometime tomorrow, Tues...."
i wonder if company will be able to keep same dividends going with all the effect from virus affecting businesses? Im holding on for the ride but curious.
"What the hell? Almost 7% drop in a week. I love this stock for the great divys, but what happened?"
Was wondering about a special dividend with the exit from Frontier and refinance of Xmas? Greedy of course.
Next stop 11 just before eom ...
received our dividend today...2 more now for June !!
Added another 15% to my position today. Have to continue buying the dip below $11.50. The street will realize the company is stronger with higher interest rates and lower taxes. That more than offsets any competition for income based investors that may jump ship for bonds over the dividend here.
So NIO share price was +$gain more than all the other EV's. How come Longs not complaining as they do when the price drops or another EV has more $gain for the day? I also see shorts have disappeared. I just love how NIO gets it done all the time. Li mute the noise and continue the great work you are doing in building a great company. NIO to the moon. Longs you are holding on to a solid company vision plan. Li has a very good company strategy and he is getting the job done. All the dilution of shares is just the BIG boys wanting in and yeah he should not let them in cheap but why turn down 1.5billion cash or millions cash. I would take it too. Long or short do your own DD but EV's market is hot at the moment and all countries and governments are buying into the GREEN energy.. I for one is invested and will see what the future holds.
"just listened to the CC ...A typical Gladstone kinda boring , get a solid job done CC...One thing reiterated was how reliable they consider and hold the dividend. Gladstone spoke on how even during Covid how they kept the dividend. He said I love dividends and my investors do also. Not many questions on CC....Long GAIN"
What a beautiful stock!
thanks for the deal
An increase in the distributions and supplemental distribution(s) from now on? Sounds good to me!
just upgraded to Strong buy on Zacks...!!
"Listening to the conference call now...…. Mixed results but sounds like mostly timing between quarters. Looks like the drop in NII is as a result of several exits and one account (SOG) placed on non-accrual.Underlying the decrease in NII is a significant increase in unrealized appreciation and in net assets. NAV increased 6.3% or $0.73 from $11.57 to $12.30. At current share price of $10.61 that make for a discount to NAV of %13.74%Management,(David G,. etal.) demonstrated a conviction in the business and support for the current dividend plus supplemental.It looks like to me that their will be a negative response this morning in share price and it might be a good opportunity to increase position."
To all the shareholders who sold today. The 0.03 was supplemental bonus dividend. The end of month div still coming on Sep 30.
"Solid stock, I wish I had more. Iĺl hold for a couple more years."

"I'm new to GAIN. Unfortunately just found it and missed the special div by 3 days. But am excited to be on board.Anyone who is not aware, there is another great monthly div company (MAIN) also with 2 special payouts - although they did suspend the mid year special div due to COVID. I've been in it for 5 years. They have never lowered or missed a regular dividend and have consistently raised it. They are also in the 7+% camp. I am not sure which company is better, but for now there is room for both in my portfolio."
"juicy 10 % dividend...don't give them your shares. This earnings will be much better than last. There was very little closed down for their businesses last quarter, not like the previous quarter. We might see a small beat ....anyway enjoy the Divi while we wait. We have the best managers , CEOs and they won't cut the Divi"
"I’m new to this board but my Schwab platform show a drop in aftermarket of 39% of gain price, more than five dollars can someone with another broker confirm this."
Getting low enough for me to buy them back. 
I cant believe there is no action on this board. The company has a great monthly dividend and has returned a great gain to boot in 2017. This is the main holding in my portfolio with reinvested dividends. The company could move another 30% in 2018 while covering the dividend with no issues. Their mid-tier companies that they invest in will benefit greatly from the tax cuts in 2018. This has not been worked into estimates fully or dividend coverage calculations. The dividend could be boosted another 15% monthly and also increase the semi-annual special dividend.

Buying the dip.
GAIN is down -5.01% to 10.43
Every time I think the share price has hit the ceiling it has another leg higher. I want to buy more for the well-covered dividend but there is no share appreciation left and potentially 15-20% near-term downside. But the market continues to prove me wrong on the share price side of the equation. Still my 3rd largest portfolio position but just can’t get it ahead of AOR or AAPL.

Buying every share I can below 10.
Next X Divi is Dec 22....stock showing strength lately...
Wow rewarding us long shareholders again!! GAIN might be my favorite dividend stock the way things are going!
"thinking about getting in, is this a good long term?.stable dividend.?"
I will never sell GAIN. Nice returns since I bought years ago plus the dividends are a kicker. Momentum is slowing after this run and dividend coverage is questionable. But they have some of the smartest management in the industry.
"Has anyone receive tax information about the ""deemed distribution' yet, from your brokerage company? The press release said we should receive it in May."

Long on gain after 8 years of reaping great dividends and continued smart acquisitions
Good selloff today. If it goes low enough it would be a time to add.
"Decent Quarter, Increasing NII though down from 43% of GII to 40%, which hopefully will not be a trend. Did not fully cover the dividend again, but had a decent realized gain to help offset that. $8M increase in net assets is huge but need to convert better to keep the divvy up."
Capitala Finance realized $32 million profit on sale of nth degree along with partner GAIN. Capitala appears to be keeping all the profit.

solid company with nearly 8% yield and still such low volume!? I'm surprised no ones snapping up these bargains! one of the few monthly dividend companies also.

Thinking of putting $800in this as a start. I also am looking into some ETFs. I just can't keep up with all the investment news and DD it takes to keep up with investing. Looking for some safe places that I don't have to pay attention to my investments everyday.

This is a near risk-free high yielder at these levels.

This could be the stock that makes you into a superstar… Check THESTOCKDORK
What are everyone's thoughts about potentially adding to positions here? Been a longer term holder and normally add on dips. I think my last purchase was when it dropped below 10 many months ago. I think I'm looking to add but haven't determined my price point.
next stop 10.50 ! crawling back
interesting...they always post the three month dividend schedule...it's the 7 th with no press release....they are crickets...
GAIN is down 4.97% to 13.39
Might be nice for Gladstone to give some update to it's shareholders. Can't imagine Covid being kind to them. Maybe update dividend plans etc...Just say something to us...
"Don't understand why stock down , beat expectations. Bought in the low 8's for the dividend since I am retired."
