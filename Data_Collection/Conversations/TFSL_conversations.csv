TFS Financial is boring but safe with a nice fat dividend.
"Special meeting was held Tuesday, & Dividend will be increased to $1.1 per year. Should be effective with the Sept dividend. That takes dividend yield back over 6%. Next earnings release the end of July could be upside surprise!"

"ANOTHER earnings miss!!! Lots of loan applications being taken, but they aren't closing as many loans as they did a year ago. Interest rate spread decreasing quickly, which is scary. They currently generate enough $ to pay dividends, but may have difficulty in the future. Stock buyback has slowed with decreasing earnings, so little hope for additional dividend increase."
