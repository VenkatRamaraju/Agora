"ANOTHER earnings miss!!! Lots of loan applications being taken, but they aren't closing as many loans as they did a year ago. Interest rate spread decreasing quickly, which is scary. They currently generate enough $ to pay dividends, but may have difficulty in the future. Stock buyback has slowed with decreasing earnings, so little hope for additional dividend increase."
