Seems like all banks not in favor right now with flattening yield curve. Any idea how low realistically BRKL stock price will go. Nice earnings and reasonable dividend but every day down...down...down. There must be a support level somewhere. Long term holder who just can't seem to pull the trigger and sell. Hopefully management will / is buying back stock at this level.

Presto chango...one minute you have money... the next minute Sandler O'Neil has it. Weren't these the same people that helped BRKL with a debt offering a few years ago paying 6% at a time corporates were paying 3%? Shrewd timing as always for the crew at Brookline to batter this stock. Need to look into getting my proxy votes changed.

Not sure if anyone is still using this board for actual BRKL topics. I do not like the new format. Anyways.....does anyone know if any loans written to Curt Schilling by BRKL / Rhode Island Bank were actually paid back in full? Or at least is the bank still going after him for anything owed? Thanks \.

"Check out the Boston Business Journal 5/12/17 a nice summary of the recent stock offering. One analyst described this as an ""odd move"" and another was ""perplexed"" by it because BRKL has plenty of capital for growth or acquisitions. Good luck to all."

"BRKL seems oversold to me. We are now selling at half a buck below the recent offering price. A June rate increase seems like a definite, so BRKL should benefit as will all of the banks. I took the recent dip to buy more shares."
