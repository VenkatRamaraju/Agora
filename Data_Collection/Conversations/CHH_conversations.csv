"I have just learned that I have been scammed by Choice Hotels prepaid reservation policies. If one cancels a prepaid reservation, it is your responsibility to contact the hotel directly in order to receive your refund. This policy is not explained anywhere on their website nor is there any notification when you cancel through their website. I discovered this scam because I noticed an interest charge on my credit card. Can you imagine how many millions have canceled reservations and did not check their credit card statement closely to verify that the refund was posted. I am sure Choice Hotels is very much aware of this scam and have no intentions of changing it sense it is 100% profit. I spent over an hour trying to get my refund. The hotel operators are not very eager to let go of this cash cow."

Lawsuit will be filed by property owners for fraudulent practices by choice. Choice will loose thousands of property and this stock is going down.
"Does Woodspring Suites owe you a sales tax refund? Choice owns Woodspring Suites, multiple locations. When people stay longer than 30 days, they are then considered a leasing permanent resident and are not to be charged sales taxes. Instead of paying me back - they paid a lawyer to not pay me back all the over charges and taxes. I filed a Small claims and the judge ruled against me. I had to battle the judge to give me a trial de novo. My guess is that the lawyers were born, raised and went to the same colleges as the judges; why they allowed Woodspring to cheat, violate the laws and not be held accountable. I then filed a State Attorney General complaint and they are not interested. Interesting how our system fails the victims! The victims have put together a petition trying to gather up enough victims to file a class action!If you have ever stayed at a Woodspring Suites (formerly known as Value Place) some are franchise owners, yet still managed and represented by Choice, Hotel National Management Company, LLC, headquartered in Kansas.If you stayed longer than 30 days, and were never refunded back the sales taxes, please consider signing this petition and share it with others: http://chng.it/RtH5SLWsYbThere is not enough volume on Choice stock! Please consider selling if you own this stock."

Recently stayed at one of their motels and it was an extremely disappointing experience. Lots of what appeared to be unsavory characters hanging around in the parking lot. F250 trunk running right outside the room door with what seemed to a person sleeping in it. The property was unkept and needed lots of attention.
