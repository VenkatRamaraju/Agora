"I do remember Lisa Su saying at the ER and in CNBC that many joint products with $xlnx are in the pipe to launch next year. Does anyone else remember this? She was explaining how important Xilinx is to complement AMD's technology for a future of heterogeneous computing and integration of the teams working together has progressed well. Do I remember this right?If so, question - in what legal arrangement is this going on given the companies are separate legal entities till the closing? Thanks for the help."
"Don't be fooled. Scammin' Tom is still trying to con people to his failed Reddit site. He's always wrong so who would listen to that liar?TOM2 days ago$AMD conversation@Mike exactly, $35B is ok but the banks advising the deal didn't place limits not expecting a high AMD's growth. You can see 4 years growth projection filed by Xilinx and AMD as part of the merger due diligence. AMD had nothing like 45% growth last year or 60% growth this year probably the same next year.Paying $70B to $100B if the actual closing is on April 2022, by then AMD's PPS could be $200-$300 time 400M+ shares is crazy. No tech buying was at this valuation. Partnership as with Samsung will be fair. That's what I believe we'll hear at the ER.TOM2 days ago$AMD conversation@Mike Lisa Su won't pay $70B or $100B waiting for April closing. The Chinese regulators asking for refilling application as they have done for most semi deals, will help get out of this 400M+ payment for Xilinx, replaced with a partnership.TOM2 days ago$AMD conversationNow you all see what I meant by kris having new theories all the time lol manipulation paid posting at its best so easy to tell!Don't be fooled! $xlnx will be hurt after the ER and Kris is preparing his new theory. ..TOM3 days agoAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.@roger that's what may be announced at the ER, devastating Xilinx's PPS. .. big drop.TOM3 days ago$AMD conversationRemember the WSJ rumors ahead of AMD's buying Xilinx leaks? Oct 7 2020 story search for it. Only on Oct 27 2020 AMD's posted the news in the morning.No way hedge funds won't know about an approval from China and the volume and PPS for $xlnx will go up accordingly. Was red yesterday on lower than average daily volume.No Chinese approval announced at the ER let alone CLOSING the merger then!Hedge funds trying to spread such news through kris and other paid posters to exit their Xilinx positions before it's too late!Think about it, don't be fooled!TOM3 days agoAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.Stay away from Xilinx very low volume and high risk merger won't happen. .. after the ER dropping Xilinx price could be evaluated again unless no chance of the merger.TOM3 days ago$AMD conversationHedge funds holding the arbitrage of Xilinx will sell ahead of the ER because even if AMD announces a postponed closing date to January, the Xilinx's PPS will dive. Hence Xilinx closed red. Risk holding Xilinx's shares is too big, there's no net additional 1.72X gains, it's already at about 1.5X price, don't be fooled to gamble for (1.72-1.5)/1.72 gains while risking losing ($174-$100)/$174 percentage because Xilinx will drop to $100 on no merger announcement at the ER, even if it recovers latter a bit, nothing close to its current PPS.Don't listen to hedge funds paid posters and paid attacking trolls. Think for yourself , no need take risk, winning with holding AMD is substantial.TOM4 days ago$AMD conversationXilinx is red as Lisa Su has last said she just HOPE merger closes by EOY. No longer EXPECTS ...Big change it's telling!Prep for walking back the merger under Chinese regulators asking for a new filling which creates an impossible delay - we'll hear at the ER. Risk is huge in my view!TOM3 hours agoAfter listening to the call, especially the Q&As with the analysts, I got a very strong feeling including about 2022 as analysts kept asking for hints and raising concerns but Lisa Su and Devinder completely answered in the strongest positive way, and in SHARP CONTRADICTION to Intel's, including explicit question on China datacenters slowness per Intel's ER - completely rebuttal as no issues seen by AMD'S in China, and... aextremely positive answers on multiple $xlnx related questions - super positive and not only sounding like it closes but saying multiple products launching and waiting to show the roadmap with Xilinx's value. Very impressive to me! Transcript will be available tomorrow.Congratulations Xilinx shareholders, looks like you'll get a gain on the arbitrage and looks like out of many new products coming with Xilinx, this is no dilution at all!"
"At 11:00AM ET, XLNX's volume is 1.8M--soon it will be the avg daily volume. This is absolutely phenomenal volume for this stock. I wonder if AMD management might be buying some XLNX shares now besides us AMD investors."
"From today's conference call with AMD, looks like the XLNX acquisition is a done deal, i.e., ""the addition of Xilinx coming into our portfolio"". The deal is still on track to close by the end of the year. So I expect the arbitrage gap will start to close going forward."
"November 9 is the ex-dividend date. You have to own XLNX by the end of the day on Friday, 11/8 to get the dividend."
"It doesn't matter when the merger will be closed. Just when we know SAMR approves matters. It should be before Xilinx pays out a part of its capital, at Nov. 8."
"seriously guys.. $AMD is opening itself to lawsuits from long shareholders if this deal does not close quickly.As long AMD shareholders the merger terms has been hard on us.1. the deal has set up a merger arbitrage in a volatile stock $AMD where we know manipulation abounds, that should have been reasonably foreseeable.2. the AMD share buybacks will effectively hand over more valuable $AMD shares that have benefited from share buybacks to XLNX. .3. with $XLNX poised to pay $100 mil dividend, without a reduction in the exchange ratio we are getting less than we paid for Xylinx. the agreement was poorly constructed to allow Xylinx to pay a dividend before the expected ""closing before the end of the year"" without an adjustment to the exchange ratio.I see a class action matter here mark my words.still bullish on AMD but this merger arbitrage is killing us."
"@Demannequin just go read the XLNX board for the proof @TOM said to sell XLNX. He said it multiple times and lied about the merger being cancel and replaced with a partnership. He spread lots of FUD on that board as well as here. If you really aren’t him why are you defending him so much. Here is a copy:“Buy AMD sell $xlnx, no news on approval so it wasn't! Why risk? AMD wins in any case. Even a delay will sink Xilinx. Don't be fooled!”"
I think the arb gap is closing due to Lisa Su confidence in closing merger EOY.
"Reply to DeMannequin below...I have to disagree. I have read writing by Kris over 5 years. I learned things I did not know, I was supported by Kris when I wanted to dump AMD and hold on through some tough times. I am currently 8x because I held with ""a little help from my friends""."
"at current earnings numbers and growth, AMD + $XLNX combined revevue 2022 will be over $22B surpassing $NVDA."
"SO XLNX/AMD ratio dropped back to 1.46 today. I'm wondering if this is a sign that the market believes AMD is going to take a dip after the $XLNX merger, and AMD is still running up on earnings expectations? Annualized EPS for the combined companies based on Q2 results is $2.48. The real question is how they both do in Q3 ERs. Regardless, I think the merger is going to close by EOY as planned."
$XLNX is on track to close by year end.
"As of today's close, XLNX is worth $211.86 based on AMD's closing price. It's still a bargain at $174.36 for a 21.5% gain. Let's see what happens to AMD Wednesday."
"The old adage is, ""Volume precedes price."" Funny thing: Xilinx is getting both at the same time today. I hope it sticks after ER today."
"Xilinx Reports Record Revenue in Fiscal Second Quarter 2022 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX), the leader in adaptive computing, today announced record revenues of $936 million for the fiscal second quarter, up 7% over the previous quarter. GAAP net income for the fiscal second quarter was $235 million, or $0.94 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $266 million, or $1.06 per diluted share. As permitted as of October 27, 2021 under the terms of the Merger Agreement between Xilinx and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), the Xilinx Board of Directors voted unanimously to declare a cash dividend of $0.37 per outstanding share of common stock payable on November 15, 2021 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on November 8,"

"In 10Q powerpoint for 3Q earnings call at 5 EST, AMD on track to close acquisition by year end."
"We've now had 11 consecutive days of new ATH. Can we make it an even dozen on the strength of earnings? Seems possible. Certainly the arbitrage play is looking ever-more attractive, with the affirmations from both AMD and XLNX that the merger will close by the end of the year. On top of that, the down side in the event of no merger is now significantly lower with quarterly EPS of $1.06 and 30% YoY earnings growth. Should be a good day today to be a holder of XLNX."
"Reposting for @DeMannequin $xlnx :""Everyone! Don't be fooled by this imposter Kris! He faked his background and credential to establish his credibility so that he can manipulate the traders here. Pay attention to his posts! All he does is cut and paste what others say without any technical depth. Occasionally, he will add what he claimed his own wisdom on top. He has a crew working with him around the clock, praising him to boost his credibility. He is only good at referencing and reciting others' work. When you start challenging him with technical inquiry, you will see that he will get stuck, and find a way to divert the subject of discussion.This is the same shill that said as of last Friday, Oct 22 that “A bundled EC” could still happen on Tuesday, Oct 26. He said that AMD could still release the earning and then announce the closure of the AMD/Xilinx M/A”, knowing that there was no regulatory approval from China SAMR yet. He said that China SAMR could have given the M/A approval already but AMD was holding back this material information until the ER to announce it. Clearly, he was trying to bully some of us into believing that the M/A could close by ER date of Oct 26 with an intent to manipulate the trading. When I confronted him, he accused that Demannequin = TOM = Limonta = Tiger. Clearly, he has been bullying people around thinking that no one would challenge him.I have had my suspicion about this shill for a long time but I couldn’t prove it. It was 2-3 years ago when Google was about to launch Stadia video game streaming service. Some of us on this YMB were discussing about the video game streaming latency concern, including TOM at the time. This shill jumped in and said that latency will get much better when we moved to 5G network. That’s when I was alerted and realized that this shill doesn’t know much. He could just be a cut and paste guy. The video game streaming latency was introduced because of the frame re-ordering during the MPEG encoding before it is streamed down. At the STB side, you have to receive a minimal number of frames within the GOP (Group-of-picture), decode them, re-order them into display order before you can present them. That’s the bulk of the streaming latency. It’s NOT because of the bandwidth. The only way to improve the latency is to increase the frame rate, reduce the frame period, therefore, reduce the streaming latency. But by increasing the frame rate, you are also increasing the bandwidth requirement.But it was this weekend when things started to unfold. After he failed to bully me over the “A bundled EC” discussion, I’ve decided to go further into his background verification. This shill has claimed repeatedly post after post that he has 40 years of SW/HW engineering development experience in embedded system working for a defense contractor under his belt. This happen to be my area of expertise as well with 28 years of experience under my belt, specializing in digital video system. I was a core member of the development team of Dolby Vision, a TV technology that some of you are enjoying at home right now, before I went into early retirement more than a year ago. Yet when I repeatedly asked him a simple design question related to embedded system design “How to implement a deadlock detection in a real-time operating environment?”, he can’t answer it. He has been faking and lying about his credential all these years just to establish his credibility so that no one will challenge and question his knowledge.This is the same shill that said he’s not a trader but a long investor. But every time AMD PPS is about to dip, he would say that he has a lot of dry powder ready. He never sells but always has the fund ready to acquire more shares. Do you believe that he has unlimited fund?This is the same shill that made suggestions to long investors on the board to sell covered calls and buy other derivatives.Be careful taking his advices other than going LONG! He’s a wolf under sheep skin.For those that have been on this YMB for years, you should know that I am a true long long investor and that I am DeMannequin, not TOM. Clearly, this shill is here with a motive to manipulate the board. Pretend to be a good guy and then stab us in the back."""
"So $XLNX thinks the merger may NOT done by Nov 8, 2021?

"Those were some freaking incredible Xilinx earnings ~ way beyond my expectations. What a nice stock to own going into the merger with AMD. With that kind of growth, it is ok if the merger does not proceed. Lisa Su is one of the sharpest CEO's on Wall Strret."
Several analysts have raised their price targets for AMD.
"Where's the risk buying $XLNX??Victor Peng, president and chief executive, said in a statement that ""Xilinx delivered another record quarter despite the continuing industry-wide supply chain constraints.""Several investment firms raised their share-price targets for the company after the earnings beat.These include analysts at Wells Fargo, who boosted their share price target to $190 from $140, and Deutsche Bank, who lifted their target to $195 from $155."
"$XLNX $AMD merger arbitrage is killing AMD long shareholders.the arbitrage gets immediate cash from the arbitrage profit when you sell 1.7234 AMD shares and buy 1 XLNX share.long-term amd shareholders need not worry, this is temporary and has a finite life which ends the earlier of deal ok from China or arbitrage profits gone"
"I sure hope nobody here listened to Scammin' Tom and missed out on the $XLNX flip. There's still time since the ratio is still under 1.5 today. It has dipped a little just before the ER as AMD soared, but today XLNX flew. I sold a bunch of AMD and bought XLNX all the while Scammin' Tom warning that XLNX would fall on 10/8, then 10/15, then at the ER. He claimed the merger would be canceled since it wasn't approved by the ER. It didn't happen. Lisa Su reiterated that they expect the merger to close by EOY. All my XLNX shares I bought at 1.47X AMD will be converted back to AMD at 1.7234X and I'll make an instand 17.2% for doing nothing, on TOP of the gain in AMD. I did it all in my IRAs so no tax issues. Tom isn't smart enough to understand that. Don't be fooled!!"

What volume! Anybody here besides me holding onto your XLNX shares?
"August 23, 2021, was the most recent day that XLNX enjoyed unusually large trading volume as we've seen today. The share price closed @ $153.52 on that day and has pretty much continued upwards ever since that day with only an occasional dip but resuming back uphill shortly afterwards.Since Dr. Lisa Su has only said that AMD's merger with XLNX will be ""by the EOY, we could see this continuing increase in XLNX's volume for another couple of months because we don't know when the announcement of the closing will be. So be wise and hold onto your valuable XLNX shares in order to reap the additional 1.7234 exchange for AMD shares upon the closing of the merger."

Did AMD say anything about buybacks. How much did they spend so far out of $4B buybacks announced?
"The more i read about the merger with $XLNX, the more i realize that the merger is going to create the single largest pool of high quality Semi design, validation, testing and manufacturing talent in a single place since forever. The market is super sparse for talent and even Apple has trouble retaining their best. This is a no brainer long term behemoth simply from the point of view that, except for one, all other companies that are presently valued over $1 Trillion are directly monetizing the derivations of the products spun out by these two companies for the foreseeable future."
"I posted 8 days ago from actual agreement I've read multiple times. The deal lives until April 26, 2022 provided CCP doesn't deny merger with no offer of acceptable remedy. Clearly denial is highly unlikely. The agreement reads in Sec. 6.1(b) ""...the End Date will be automatically extended, without any action on the part of any party hereto, to January 26, 2022 and, if so extended, such date shall be the “End Date and ...April 26, 2022..."" April uses the same terminology. There are many other requirements (due diligence) to complete but both parties work diligently to complete and the tough appear to be completed. The big show stopper is China. We'll know very soon. Many shorts spinning tales to mislead and cover their underwater margin account. Doubtful they wrote leaps, or using puts and this goes to April and dies, they're toast. Good news for longs in XLNX, should merger fail, you own an industry FPGA leader. This is not some risky SPAC start up. Hold for 3-5 years and you'll make money while diversifying across massive Telco sector, etc."
