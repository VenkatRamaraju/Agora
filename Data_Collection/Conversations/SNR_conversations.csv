Have we seen the bottom??
"The math is simple here: Take the annualized Q3 '17 NOI of $217m and cap it at 7% (SNR recently sold $280m assets at approx the same cap rate, therefore I'm using that as a proxy). This gives you roughly $3.1b valuation. Now back out net debt of approx $2.05b and you're left with equity worth $1.05b, or approx $12.90/share."
"Raised guidance, FFO increasing, selling some assets and use proceeds to reduce debt. I like what is happening. GLTA"
What is the better measure as far as ability to cover dividend ?AFFO or FFO ?Thanks !!
"Very nice.. funds from operations of $22.9 million, or 28 cents per share, in the period.The company said it had net income of $33.5 million, or 41 cents per share revenue of $106.9 million in the period.

"New Senior Investment Group Inc. (“New Senior” or the “Company”) (NYSE: SNR) announced today that it has completed the sale of its entire Assisted Living/Memory Care (“AL/MC”) portfolio for a gross sale price of $385 million (the “Transaction”). Proceeds from the Transaction were used to reduce debt by approximately $360 million. The Company’s portfolio now consists of 102 Independent Living (“IL”) properties and one continuing care retirement community.In conjunction with the Transaction, the Company also repaid existing loan agreements and entered into a new financing for $270 million (the “Loan”) with Freddie Mac arranged through KeyBank Real Estate Capital, which is secured by 14 IL assets.

The Company has no significant near-term debt maturities until 2025."
I added more shares this morning. The dividend may be cut in the future but the value of the holdings are worth much more than the current stock price. I also think management may decide to buy back some shares because of the low stock price. All of this is just my opinion. GLTA

Looking at strategic alternatives. I believe Softbank might be restructuring Fortress. FIG sold the external management contract back to DS so they are now fully independent. Softbank seem more high tech and venture capital focused. SNR's geezer business probably doesn't fit their shot/long term objectives on where the direction they want. I'm still holding. GL Bob S.

"I have owned shares for years from Newcastle spin-off. I understand that with all the uncertainty that the value is no longer $8-$10/share today but with all the liquidity that the Fed has put out there I think someone (hedge fund or competitor) could pay around $5/share, leave public, or take private and have a great investment over the longer term (3 years out). I think this is a possibility. JMO GLTA"

"I bought more shares this morning of SNR as it fell over 3.5% this morning. This company is profitable, covid expenses were less than anticipated, and I expect a big buyer to come into the stock once the value is recognized. Whether you are a long term investor or a trader the risk/reward seem strong here. All just my opinion. GLTA"
If you are long SNR the coming week could be a set up for a large announcement. Earnings release is this coming week and hopefully we hear news on the strategic review. I have loaded up in anticipation and will be happy with a buy-out or disappointed if nothing occurs. Time will tell. GLTA.
"They updated their COVID-19 presentation today. Now up to 8 properties with confirmed virus cases (around 20 people infected). Move-in rates dropping, but move out rates dropping too. Occupany only dipped 0.2% for March, but more decrease expected for April. Higher operating expenses, but continued low interest rates offset this a bit. Overall, the picture gets worse, as expected, but it doesn't sound horrible (yet), all things considered. I'm bleeding red from this holding over the past week. Should have dumped when it bounced back to $3 and then re-bought here. I'll just continue to hold and hope things get better. They'll definitely take a near-term hit on FFO, but I still hope things will get back to 'normal' after a few months.Summer is only a couple months away!"
"SNR will be trending down imho till it becomes attractive again at around $5 (~10% yield, well covered). Still the main reason to hold this stock is the dividend. Sold my position at $6.6 (missed a better price) due to the div cut. Other than the cut Q2 results look ok, plan to internalize mgmt is good. Some time down the road this puppy may be a very good buy, just not yet."
"Take a look at SNR's sister company Drive Shack (DS), senior management of Drive Shack purchased 2,024,000+ shares of Drive Shack stock. When management buys, good things are coming. Add to your portfolio with Drive Shack while it is at a low price of $2.65 per share."

I bought today at 2.54..... does anyone have any idea if the dividend is continuing?
So what are they planning now that they don’t appear to be selling ? The bv is almost 2x sp show what’s plan to unlock it? Where’s the “increase shareholder value”??? Maybe they should sell a package of under performer properties lower debt and increase div instead of lowering all the time THATS increasing sh value

Earnings out and company says they are looking at strategic alternatives and will not comment any further on the subject. I am wondering if they have someone knocking on the door with a offer? Dividend will remain the same according to the company so maybe the stock price can rise with a buyout or a change in how the company utilizes cash and assets? JMO GLTA
Just wanted to let everyone know that I sold several shares of SNR on the news today that I had bought at much lower prices. I still own some shares but I am disciplined with buying and selling and sold some today and locked in some gains. I think over the longer term SNR will go higher. JMO GLTA
SNR reported covid update and it was much better news than previously reported. NOI was down about 5% rather than 10-15% lower that was previously announced (estimated). 76% of properties have had no covid 19. The report is worth the read and this should drive the stock price higher in the short and intermeditate term. This should be a good day for the stock. JMO GLTA
"I have been reveiwing institutional ownership of SNR and like that Vanguard, Blackrock, Renaissance Technologies, Cooperman, and Goldman S. are largest owners. I have been a huge fan of Renaissance for many years and their returns. If you are long we have great company and I think this bodes well for the long term. JMO, GLTA"
part of me feels mgmt waited until Jan 1st to activate the $100m buyback program they announced last fall in combination with the completion of the internalization
"News out that SNR added a new shelf offering. I am interested in comments as to why SNR is doing this. My initial thoughts are: 1) SNR is keeping the company and plans to expand their business, 2) Expand the business for a large buy-out from a third party, 3) Spin off part of business and expand another part of business. JMO GLTA"
"Up 56% year to date as of June 1 .Looks like the reorganization is gonna pay off and also, this may be a safe place to hide if stock market remains volatile ."
"My educated guess is they are preparing to sell. Listen again to the call. The assets are fine, so why else would they take such dramatic steps? Classic balance sheet prep and advice from buy side advisors to clean up the place. What do you do when you want to sell your house? On the debt, that’s a good move if your selling. A buyer will want to bring in their own financing, maybe use a corporate line or just pay cash. I bought more this morning!"
"New Senior Investment Group Inc (NYSE:SNR) Director David H. Milner purchased 50,000 shares of the companys stock in a transaction dated Wednesday, March 11th. The stock was bought at an average cost of $4.83 per share, for a total transaction of $241,500.00."
I look for SNR to raise the dividend some when they announce earnings. This should drive the stock higher. Covid expenses were lower than expexted (see last announcement) and if that continues we should stair step up. JMO GLTA
"Noise from the div cut aside, the quarter was actually pretty solid. RevPOR, occ, and same store NOI all up and showing signs of recovery."
