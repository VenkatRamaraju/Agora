Barclays has a short position. BofA is Long. Disney will shock 2022 with content and dividend. Bank it
Disney world and Disneyland sold out every weekend
"So you want to hear from a real analyst of $DIS...I am a passholder, shareholder, have a Disney License plate and I drive Uber and Lyft around Orlando on weekends. First off, note that Stacy brought up Disney Genie+, which will bring in more money for the company. There were so many people at Disney and the airport this weekend, I had to shut off my Uber/Lyft app. The requests were too many. I met families from everywhere. This is suppose to be Disney's down season until the first week of December, but the parks and resorts are jam-packed. The parks have been slammed since the beginning of the year and has not stopped. They took away early hours from passholders. Early hours are only for Disney resorts guests (smart way to fill up their resorts). As for Disney+ (remember Disney owns Hulu), which is growing in leaps and bounds. Who cares about Disney+, as it comes as a packaged deals most times with Hulu? Verizon & Spirit give it away free to its users and we get a discount through T-Mobile for the Hulu package. AT&T, who only gives HBO free, shouldn't be far behind. As for the movies, that was a deal made to make actors and AMC happy. It is trying to keep everybody happy. Either way, releasing it on Disney+ or selling it through AMC first, Disney will make money. I want that analyst to put up their paycheck against Disney not only beating expectations, but blowing through expectations. When I went to Disney just two weeks ago, as a visitor, I ask to charge my car and the employee said that two of the chargers were down. He then stated ""Don't worry, it will be fixed soon. They don't want to lose a dollar."""
" WHY DISNEY SHARE PRICES WILL CONSTANTLY INCREASE Disney Parks are still not fully recovered from Covid meaning that the share price you see if a fraction of the price Disney will be once 100% recovered. Disney is generating record profits from its Disney+, Hulu and ESPN streaming services as well as all the very popular channels they own. Disney also generated a ton of money from AD & Merchandise sales. I see the price hitting $200+ before 2022."
"Disney's online petition to fire the CEO has gotten over 26,000 votes in less than 24 hours."
"Now that Netflix earnings hype is done, investors/traders will rotate their capital into Disney for it's earnings run-up on November 10th. We'll be over $180 by then, mark it."

"Tomorrow Disney launches their new digital line-booking service called Disney Genie at Walt Disney World. Another new revenue stream that will monetize each customer even more. This is a complete digital revamp of their old line-reservation tools for Disneyâ€™s parks, allowing guests to plan and update their itineraries, book time slots for the most popular attractions, and optionally purchase paid access to the fast lanes through a new service called Genie+ all through one app.https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/disneys-new-genie-line-booking-service-launches-at-walt-disney-world-on-october-19/"
"People have forgotten that the Parks side of Disney's business was generating about $4 to $5 Billion pre-pandemic. Now that this is back on track--and generating higher margins with premium pricing--we find DIS poised for an easy beat in the next ER. DIS is expected to report .46 per share in this upcoming Qtrly ER, but their actual EPS last quarter was .69. This is a great opportunity to get in at a bargain price before the next ER, which is Nov 10th!"
"This irrational sell-off is the result of one low ranking Barclay's analyst? JP Morgan who has more credibility than Barclay's gave a $230 PT to Disney just last week. Buy the fear, we'll be over $180 by before earnings.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/walt-disney-stock-price-target-raised-to-230-from-220-at-j-p-morgan-01633607126"
Disney has shown that it's close to breaking out and heading towards $180 as we inch closer to earnings:- Buyers have consistently defended the $170 zone the past few days accumulating their positions - Proportion of daily call flow has significantly increased - Showed relative strength while the DOW was weak - Highest close since drop and hit intraday weekly high
"Disney upcoming catalysts, plenty in the weeks ahead - ESPN+ demand high with NBA, MLB, NFL, and NHL all season active- General bookings for Disney's highly anticipated Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser resort opens on October 28th - Earnings Report on November 10th - Disney+ Streaming Day on November 12th"
"toomuch focus on disneys streaming. disney continued to expand its parks thru the pandemic. Last time I checked people were going out again. disney will be fine, the parks are full again and the movies are rolling. the whole business will be doing well again. hang tight and enjoy the ride."
"Ah, DL raising $ entry admission! Sahweet!"
Someone step up and explain a PE of 277. Lol. And how it justifies a $200 price.
didney held support. back to 180 and beyond. Mickey is a cash machine
Most theme parks have been sold out this year folks......DIS will move to $200 after earnings.
"Disney has one big problem, the Big Guy is in charge and we're looking at runaway inflation and when energy costs go up along with the everyday cost of food, housing and insurance the last thing people do is plan an expensive vacation.Since the price increases for season passes have increased along with the black out dates it will be interesting to see how many don't renew.On a good note it was the corporations like Disney/ABC and good old GMA that got the Big Guy elected."
Disney management tries to use the shotgun approach to marketing. A tried and failed many times by numerous companies to be everything to everybody via their product lines. No way to maximize profits on the sectors that are working as you're constantly being held hostage by weaker segments.
Disney world of itself is a huge money maker for Disney. If you believe its earnings will fall go online and see if you can get a room anywhere on property for either Thanksgiving week or Christmas week. Sold out!! You don't need an upgrade or downgrade to tell you what is going on. Do it yourself
