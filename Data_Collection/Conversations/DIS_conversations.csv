This dip is temporary! Buy when everyone is selling.
"Based upon how this Company is executing, it should be priced back at $91 per share"
bought $10K worth of calls
less disney subscribers
'Shang-Chi' Tops $400 Million At Global Box Office
CNBC says subscriber growth slowing
"First the CEO says: We don’t have subs, tells friends, stock crashes, friends buy, stock soars again. This is such insider trading."
"I love Disney, but with a PE ratio of 300 or more I just can't buy into it."
Earnings over $185
"Can someone explain why Dis. cant hold over 180 even with all teh ""good"" results...?"
Halloween celebrations and the parks are full to capacity! This stock will always recover!
"Predictability and sustainability are the greatest drivers of valuation. The parks are a permanent requirement for anyone with kids, the mouse never dies and they grew a Netflix in their belly. Disney is the ultimate forever stock. You won’t get rich overnight with it but we all need some rocks in the portfolio."
Buying cheap thanks shorts
anyone ???
Waiting for $155 then will add
"We would like to see these stocks drop; Disney, Facebook, Twitter, Nike and see people and institutions put their money in honest decent companies helping them grow and our country pull out of this death spiral. Thanks"
"Buy it , ! Ba Boeing buy the stock"
so what if dis plus does not meet the expectation this Q.....present from God
as expected
"DIS was one of only two stocks up in the DJIA this week as the market lost 761 points. Big money showing DIS some love, but of course we won't know who that is until it reaches $200. Congratulations to all who's following the money trail. LOL."
"Disney +...So much potential, such poor execution....Nothing material to watch, so no reason to be paying for it!"
CEO is talking at a conference but he said do not expect a great Q for DIS plus and the news sent the stock crashing...wow. really? buy buy buy more!!!!! If you paid $199 why not $170?????
Criminal company
So glad I never sold. I bought in on May 8 2020 at $107.
"Great time to buy, stocks only go up"
Why didn't he shut his trap???
I’m not renewing my annual pass or key pass extremely expensive
Just added to position. Great company. Time for this stock to break out from its consolidation.Re-opening trade and will hold very long term.
one of the executive is leaving after 33 years
"Didn't have to wait for long, the Mouse was roaring today. Of course, Donald will wait until $200 to jump in and Goofy will just continue to sit on the sidelines and watch the train leave the station without him."
"Did they also mention that the boring parks with rides older then dirt are empty? It is great if you lie to ride It's A Small World over and over, but no one is paying for the outrageous food or buying plastic China made ears for $29.99 either. I was just there, it is boring and empty in Disney World. This stock is way over proiced after being run up $100,00 a share while the parks, and studios were empty and they made outrageous predictions for Disney Plus. Eat it."
"Parks, merchandise and Disney+ will see a great report next"
Long term options are the way to play this. Disney will easily double in a year.theNolaDawg
Will we ever see another dividend. Thumbs up yes. Down no..
Oh na
"I kind of like to follow the money trail. DIS is the only DJIA stock under accumulation today in a down market. When people in the know start throwing money at something I like, I want to go along for the ride."
Now forming Disney bag holder support group. Apply care of the message board.
The price is too good to pass up right now. I picked up some DIS today. Good luck all!
Bought today some
"I must admit, DIS has the strangest bull investors."
wher is mickey
Disney world is packed for the 50th anniversary an also Merchandise is selling as a Black Friday
Disney is open and will go up from now until next year!
"Disney pe,280.viac pe 7.Really?"
Disney will be at 200 in a couple weeks as the people visit the parks and remember the magic!
You’re trying to tell me that Disney is only worth $20 more than it was in November of 2019. Lol. What fantasy la d are you living in. Buy dip and park it.
Does this move have to do with the executive retiring or did the CEO actually say the current quarter was weak for Disney+? Seems like an aggressive move down given the move yesterday!
"Dis overvalued, big gap at 150 ish…..economic activity is very weak. Oil, gas, inflation has eroded consumers disposable income…..travel, dis, all will suffer…….my take"
"PE too high. Past PE and forward PE......too high. Next buy level around 150. All the wishing upon a star isn't going to change the reality of pandemic run-up. (It happened to a lot of stocks and now the real accounting is beginning to take place.) In the long run......current phase, i.e. 20% correction, is healthy, albeit, painful."
DIA hit a homerun on Friday and it up again big in AH trading. $200 seems like the price to watch.
Buying more
"Rough ride for those that bought after Oct 1 2020, though I predict strong growth post Covid/Delta. We're almost out of the woods. DIS is ready to roar when we open up."
Lol I remember those guys saying Disney was eating Netflix' lunch
Revenue handily beat estimates ($17.02B actual vs. $16.76B estimate).EPS crushes estimate ($0.80 actual vs. $0.55 estimate).Disney+ subscribers also above estimates (116M actual vs. 114.5M estimate).Stock up $8 initially to $186.
Buy the dips. Great stock to give your kids custodian accounts.
Little choppy but should return to $180
Undervalued
"Even looking at some slower growth, the numbers indicate DIS should be about $203 in the near future. Last weeks $7 lost in the knee-jerk debacle just made it that much more attractive."
"DIS has moved up quite nicely from $173 just a month ago, so still plenty of time to capture the next 17 points."
"How is DIS up this morning with Hospitality and Leisure sectors being hurt with this August US Unemployment report? Now, of course it is this morning before the Market opens and realize DIS is more diverse than the Parks, but it still has to affect it, right?"
"hotstar content in US is moving to Hulu and ESPN+US hotstar will be discontinued soon and people in US watching Indian movies and game of cricket are forced to subscribe to Hulu and ESPN+In long term, Disney gets two customer accounts (Hulu and ESPN+) for every hotstar customer they lose."
"The Scarjo news is not positive for disney, imo... the mkt is wrong. it will just open the door to more of this behavior.. they should not have settled... Mickey is now a SNOWFLAKE... congratz"
people are so concerned about the price of the stock. just hold it for a long time.
Apple and Disney are among the companies who back groups working against AGAINST climate legislation.
The price action on the pitiful stock will not change until they fire the entire upper management team. They are the ones who have caused the stock to falter. Over-promising and under-delivering.
Long term I can see Disney being a $500B company
Management can’t control the leaks. Sad company
Been saying for months Disney was overvalued. All I got was a lot of flack from this naive board.Will buy in the 160's and it still isn't cheap.
I am buying
PE is still at 284...needs to come back down to <50....long ways to go
"Disney should have a social media app like Twitter, FB or IG"
DIS inched their way a little higher this week. $200 still looks like a good target.
Watch AH close $172.24
JP Morgan just upgraded Disney shares from $220 to $230
"The truth Disney stock price is closer to $100 than $200 ,and that's exactly the direction it's moving right now!"
Fundamentals still show this to be a $200 stock before too long. As soon as they announce the reinstated of the dividend we should see a nice bounce.
More people watching Football! ESPN! And with boarders opening back up Disneyland and theme parks will be bringing in big bank!
Owned since 1982. No bag here. Always buy

That was a fast recovery. Bullish!
Slowdown in Disney + subscribers and headwinds will take this back to $120. Sorry longs but slowing growth is not good for stocks
Who in their right mind would visit Disney World in Orlando with covid running wild in Florida and a governor who seems bent on making it worse.?
Wth happened
Bring back the dividend!
People say it’s a liberal country yet suggest we buy communist China stocks. Lmao. Disney all the way.
I advise investors in Disney not to be RE-TODD -Ed! Stay The Course!
Another day and another step closer to $200 for DIS. I guess investors can see the bigger picture. :-)
"Everything is packed in Walt Disney world , Parks , restaurants and stores selling merchandise from the 50th anniversary"
Buy the dip
Disney should talk to Nasa and combine thier talents to build a longrange lightyear traveling spaceship able to carry 25 passengers or more.
Disney pe ratio 280? Viac 7
This stock has done nothing all year. I'm not sure why everyone is so positive on this company.
$RSI is gong to be bought out by $DIS. Only matter of what the share value will be. Will it be 5 or 6 shares of $RSI for every $DIS share?
It is ok....will be $200 soon by NOV
$177.31 going to $180.00
This needs to fall another 10-20% ($150 would be best price to buy). It’s market cap would be around $280B!
Great finish. $172 even lol I was up 60% in my calls in the am and closed 60% in loss.
bought 20 shares more!!!!!!!!
Remember that everyone loves Disney and this was an over reaction today! It will go back to over 180 by the end of the week!
"I didn't buy this one to get the volatility of a tech stock. Adios , Mickey."
Half time report on CNBC. Expect Disney shares to trade sideways for the rest of the year. $175-$185. You might see $200 sometime late Next year.
ha ha ha you all miss the dip yesterday....I am so happy to have bought it $171
$2T company in my lifetime. Simply too many assets and diverse revenue stream.
Finally a company who’s stock price is positive after earnings
"Wages up, cost up, disposable income down = not good for DIS"
"Let me figure this out, should I pay $171 for DIS who will earn $5 a share next year or go over to Robinhood and spend $190 for the dinosaur GME who will never turn another profit. Decisions, decisions. "
"Disney+is a type of fraud and forgery because the number of subscriptions of millions is on a membership fee of less than $ 1 ,so don't be surprised when the shares price will fall to half, remember you have been warned!!!"
any news? otherwise what an opportunity
Oversold
Why not $200 by now???Why
Finally I have 100 shares. Just added 20 shared when it went down 4.60%. I am long on this. Disney plus service will launch in S. Korea in a couple of months. Delta in CA has been peaked out.

Is there a confirmation on what caused the drop in price ive read like 4 different things in 5 mins
Can Disney be far behind Facebook?
"Once again it was the usual suspects and future of Disney causing a ruckus on the Disney Ferryboat with an innocent person getting hit for no reason ,last time was at Hollywood Studios when the usual suspects were at it.Good to see assimulation moving forward at WDW."
You will not see Disney at $200 this year. Maybe end of 22 or beginning of 23.
Restaurant space 2020 open in Epcot Disney world
DIS needs to start paying dividends again.
When’s this thing going to start paying a dividend again????
Eternals coming up Nov. 5th! Disney/Marvel's on a roll! $$$ to the bottom line...
All I see here is people complaining about disneys rules… i just saw someone say there are more fun things in your own state than disney.. just say you’re poor and keep it moving
DIS has been up $10 in the past 7 trading days while we've been debating growth prospects. Maybe we can brooch the subject again once DIS reaches $200.
Well well fake news ABC lying about the Arizona audit. Is there any level of depravity and misinformation that Disney and ABC will not sink to? How can anyone who believes in the principles of democracy and western civilization support this company?
good company with good assets just stuck in a big China vs US mess. I don't own this but I like to see how it can come back.:)
Same price it was in December 2020. Nice.
Disney and Ms. Johanson reach an agreement.
I wouldn’t buy any until $150-160
All those people last week saying this would be at 150 but it is almost at 175! I told you that Disney always recovers!
Dis has lots of pricing power but the stock ain't cheap
Wow.......Disney announces that they lied about 5.99 Dismay Plus subscriptions and the parks are empty because they took the magic out to save money. And the stock is up 6.00. Sell here. This stock should be at $100 a share. Going from 80 to 200 while parks are closed just because they made up a subscriber number they will never meet is a joke.
Disney world 50th anniversary merchandise sold out
"Buy the Rumors, Sell the News."
LOL. Looks like the dividend is out until 2024.
I am in. Hold. Ride out few years.

"What say you who did not bought the dips??? $msft, $Roblx, and Dis...I just bought more $FB too!"
DIS might buy the WWE? Am I reading that right?
Finally this #$%$ of a business model goes to realistic valuation?
What is happening with the sudden drop today?
"Yeah, PE of 300 . . . the phrase of the day is 'bag holder' - from investopedia What Is a Bag Holder?A bag holder is an informal term used to describe an investor who holds a position in a security that decreases in value until it descends into worthlessness. In most cases, the bag holder stubbornly retains their holding for an extended period, during which time the value of the investment goes to zero."
Thank God. futures are green. Maybe tmrw will be an inside or slightly.up day across the market?
"If you think Deep State far left propaganda is a growth industry, Disney is your stock."
"Is it just me, or is DIS really another buck closer to $200? :-)"
So it is about 104/share. I want to buy in but not at this level. Will take them next few successful calls to actually to get to their evaluations.
banks want this at $200 for their call options.
"I went to Disney World last week in Orlando, Florida. The parks were empty. While that is great if you want to get on their old, out of date, boring, aged, terrible rides, that is not good if you are a shareholder wondering how this stock doubled in a year when the parks were closed. No one was buying silly mouse ears for 29.99. You are kidding me for ears......Good thing you are counting on the 5.99 Disney Plus subscribers to justify Disney's outrageous valuation."
Nice getting in now
Nancy Pelosis husband bought the $200 calls really cheap. so you know it's going to $200.
I jumped in finally @$167 this year but do wish they paid dividends more than twice annually (before they stopped last year).
"Inflation's here, guess Disney will have to raise ticket prices."
A few more days like this easy 200 a share
Still haven’t recovered from CEOs comments
Im at downtown Disney in Anaheim right now. Lines are long for both theme parks and hotels are packed.
Long until 2022
Mickey and Minnie just bought a new mansion.
Wow... Wells Fargo really dinged DIS. Anyone want ask about dividends again?
Disney world 50th anniversary October 1st
"After it dipped below $170 yesterday I decided it had dropped enough to buy a bit more. So I'd buy a bit more on Friday.But people keep telling me ""Wait til the end of the day to buy!"" so I didn't check until after noon. Up over $7. Ah, nuts.Congrats to the bargain hunters who bought in time. Maybe there will be another drop in Oct for me to pick up some more."
"Why is DIS pe/300, but fwd pe/36?"
Going over $200 in next 3 months. Time to buy more if you Larry haven’t.
Can we have the old CEO back...?
I added 50 more shares today under 172......gift!
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
finally found a good time to buy in after the drop.
Someone wanna explain
overreaction
Disney world celebrates 50th birthday!
Just got back from Disneyland Paris. Ride times over 70 minutes despite all of the Covid health pass/requirements. $DIS to the moon
$DIS Needs to settle below $150 before the next run. This is way overpriced!
"reason for price drop: CEO Bob Chapek said the company sees Disney+ global subs up 'low single-digit millions' in Q4, lower than consensus."
This belongs back at 150
"DIS has been up two and a half points over the past two weeks. By the time they report earnings again on November 11, they should be around $190. After they report stellar earnings, a few will see the future with more clarify, something most of us have see all along, and they will jump in then and drive the price to $225."
Under $155 will be a good time to start a position
Having read a great deal of posts I can be sure that Disney will either go up or down in the future. Is that correct?
This was a great buying opportunity because the market was down but this will be back in the 180s again in no time!
This is a potential $500B stock. Who knows maybe $1 trillion market cap?
I’m going to wait until $160-165 before loading up. Then I’m going to hold until $250-300. This could easily be a $500B company imo
Parks will be the interest point here
"The news was used to start a short position, in hopes that the sell-off would accelerate and the stop-limit orders and margin call orders would kick in. In some respects, the shorts were able to get it as low as $169. The bigger news is that the USA is allowing international vaccination travel, and this is huge for the USA parks. Tourism will be strong. And when you go to the disney+ web site, they have a TON of new content coming out this fall and winter. The story of Aniken (Obi-wan) will be huge."
$DIS [Walt Disney]: Arete Research Initiates Coverage On Buy Announces Price Target $263
FAST money traders say its tanking to $150's and no buying will occur until it bottoms. GET OUT
"I think we drop to $150 before we get over $200.......I will add if this happens. DIS is a long term play and will fly ONLY when this COVID nonsense ends, you cannot deny DIS is the best re-open play out there but it will be painful until we get there."
Well it is up from 117 a year ago. Doing pretty awesome as far as a stock goes even if it goes to 150 or below you are way up from 117.
$185 next week
They fired the HULU girl because they are trying to cover up the failure of top management. Typical response when the heat is on the CEO to be fired. They have destroyed this company.
What’s the breaking news?
"IATSE strike authorization voting has begun and it’s extremely likely that we will see all film and television come to a halt in October, including live events cancellation. Short-term, I expect a big dip in DIS, NFLX, CMCSA and T when the larger financial media opens their eyes to what’s about to happen."
People are chasing short term gains in other assets. They will come back and this will break $200. They are positioned for exponential growth on all fronts but esp digital which when monetized will fix the PE problem below.
Both Eisner and Iger were great CEOs. Eisner left with some controversy but not Iger. Let’s see if Chapek will follow in their footsteps. Hoping that he does.
"Rumor has it, avengers to join DC, hence the price movement."
"This company is a total mess. Technically, they have missed the boat. Then their culture has been very misguided. CEO and all upper management needs to be fired. A new broom sweeps clean."
yup by December $220
"No need to rush into the dip we still have over 3 years left with this president, plenty of dips to come lol"
Advertising revenue is high margin! Here we go! There’s a big reason Comcast $CMCSA and Disney $DIS owns shares in $FUBO
when is Disney bringing back the Div?
"LOL. Marvel Files Lawsuit To Keep Iron Man, Spider-Man & Avengers Rights. Lawyering... it's what Disney does best."
Delta declining and Dis Parks will soar. They will open up more park attendance in numbers. That will send the stock soaring to $190 sooon. just my thought
Get Disney in OctoberGreat Movies.
Upgraded
Price targets now being slashed by MM's !!! Prepare for downside risk here in the near future to $135
Will finish negative on the year. Should have bought NFLX instead of the mouse..
Deep state propaganda will be the next big thing. Disney is cheap considering it is a leader in propaganda and promoting wokeness in general. Plus it is only 280 times earnings and five times sales. What can possibly go wrong?
"Sitreaming was a matter of survival. The market continues to become more crowded with each passing day. Your analysis is pure fantasy, there is no reasonable basis for you to conclude the market will remain static. Plus they have a content problem. Nobody wants to pay for far left propaganda."
way overvalued here with very high P/E . also people focus on streaming only they have massive debt
$175 tomorrow??????
"There’s something that I want to share guys , I live close to Disney world and everything is packed , reservations , parks , restaurants , shows and of course the theme parks so imaging the next report soon and remember the 50th anniversary of Disney world on October 1st"
Terrible 50th years opening with no mention of Walt who started it all.Maybe a couple clips of the original Mickey cartoons on the castle while people waited to get in.ABC was even more disgusting having Whoopi host the tv special.
Well at least my $DIS is doing well
Holding this stock like…
180 by the end of day
"Disney has some serious competition. I went to The Texas State fair two nights ago. Parked 200 feet from the gate and just walked right in. VASTLY superior to Disneyland. No security searches, NO masks, just nonstop fun with super friendly people. Rides were fantastic and the shows were out of this world. Lots of terrific entertainment for free. The kids could go from one attraction to another with 0 to 3 minute wait times."
"Happy 50th Anniversary to Disney World, now, if you could just jump 50 points."
DIS announcing contemplating spinning off ESPN....stock reacting strongly to upside.

Disney 225 by March. Hold.
I bought my first share. The Disney streaming channel is solid growth alone. Disney has been and will be around forever.
Dis has doubled in the last 5 years. It's really roaring ahead.
"It's been so many months that Disney was at $200. Black Widow didn't raise the price, Disney parks reopening didn't raise the price, just trying to ride this stock longer to see at $200+."
"Where is the dividends, we need to start paying dividends again"
one od the exc is leaving
The best months of year for Disney coming next
"The chart shows the RSI has bumped above the breakthrough neutral level and is at 56.53 in a Bull Cross Pattern, maybe this will try to retest the minor resistance at $185.20? From the WSJ August 27th, “Walt Disney Co. ’s ESPN is seeking to license its brand to major sports-betting companies for at least $3 billion over several years, according to people familiar with the matter, aiming to capitalize on the fast-growing online gambling industry.” Great news but ESPN has been cautious about entering the sports-betting arena, hopefully they won’t be late to the party. Good luck & great investing!“Sometimes we stare so long at a door that is closing that we see too late the one that is open.” - Alexander Graham Bell"
"I agree with those who believe that DIS is posed for a breakout. This stock has been on a plateau for the past year after is had a great 2020 run after the pandemic hit. The fundamentals have now catch up to its valuation, so going forward we should see new ATH's soon."
Disney characters are actually real not fake. They just live in a different reality is all.
PE way too high for Disney. The days where every trader thinks he or she is a genius are over and your portfolio won't be the happiest place in the world.
"Once you realize that the market is not based on the current state of the company, the easier it will be to understands a earnings beat and lack of run after. Stocks are priced basically a year into the future on how they will do. The stock market has become a futures bet and it's fake as fake can be."
'Shang-Chi' tops box office for 3rd straight weekend
"Before Covid started , stock price was below $100 . How did it double this year when it had no business for a last one year . Can some one explain please ?"
so Hulu president just left the company and is reportedly in negotiations with NBCUniversal to be a senior executive probably overseeing Peacock with this move i think sometime soon enough we will see $DIS buy $CMCSA stake in HULU.
There’s too many Disney haters which means when this goes up 2 dollars they make it go up 4 dollars since they have to cover their short positioning! Haha
The number one rule of investing. Never buy stock in a company that supports election fraud. Sell Disney.
Nice 5 month break-out!
Marvel: Creates a $175M film to attract the Chinese audience. Film gets banned in China.
"My opinion is that as Sports betting continues to be legalized in the states, ESPN will become more valuable to Disney. I think Disney will come back bigger and better than ever after Covid calms down. Children are born everyday in this world and what parent doesn't want to give their child the Disney experience be it on TV or at the parks and on a cruise ship."
