"THE DOW WILL HIT 36,000.00 LATER THIS YEAR."
"Hypothetically, even if Disney loses the Scarlett Johansson lawsuit, the move to stream the movie may have helped big earnings beat and nice bonuses for execs?"
Never a good report when Earning is released after the close on a Thursday!!! It will tank unless the movie and streaming with ESPN for the Olympic can hold it up.
Everybody loves Disney.Everybody.The optimism is at its top.
Love to see that streaming growth!
Reopen get disrupted with delta and expect $160 by this month.
Simple question: What justifies DIS 293 P/E ratio vs AMZN at 57?
"Sold Short a lot of shares of DIS at an average price of $179.28. This is a Pure Earnings trade, I established my Short position specifically to hold through earnings release in anticipation of a weak and disappointing release resulting in a significant share price drop occurring in immediate response to today's pending earnings release. Looking for a 5-12% drop in share price tomorrow. Good Luck Folks! :-)"
"My bet (I have no clue) : 1.10 EPS ,shareprice today 182, next week 170.No Disneyplus growth in Europe"
Can you fall any faster Disney? Geez! 
This stock will be right up there with Netflix end of 2022. Great time to get in. Buy and hold!
Shorts mafia ready to drop the stock even with the best results
WOW why can't VIAC move like this ?they earned .97 a share and trade at 40 ????Most Recent ReportQ2 2021 on 08/05/21I/B/E/S Estimates vs Adjusted ActualConsensus Estimates EPS $0.96Adjusted Actual EPS $0.97EPS Difference +0.01
"If the longs truly believe content is king, why are they burning their money chasing a propaganda stock?"
what is amazing is the parks revenue. wow
well i know people have high expectations for Disney+ subs but after every company with services reported a slowdown Disney today is going to report that.
Glad I added shares a couple of times the past couple weeks. May have to add some more.
DIS EARNINGS TOMORROW. $200.00 EXPECTED IN EARLY JANUARY
1st quarter was ok this one will be greater than expected
see you at 225 really soon !!!!
"What a great earnings report, and so much more to come for Disney"
"the truth will be on earnings day. Then no blabla stories count but really how much money they make on what valuation, how much growth they show on what valuation. Looking forward to it."
Sell off has started. May be $157 be good entry.
"What's with all the day traders since Covid? Zoom out, stock has doubled in 5 years, will probably double again in another 5."
Will it continue tomorrow? Or draw back? I feel like it will continue to the upside.
"Entertaining: Scarlett Johansson's lawsuitNot Entertaining: ""Black Widow"""
the price is strong with this one...
"Covered my DIS Pure Earnings Short Sell at $180.99 for a modest loss. Immediately threw all my money into a new Pure Earnings Short Sell of YOU. Short a lot of shares at an average price of $52.18. Quite disappointed at the fill price, but it is what it is and I still think YOU should drop quite a lot on Monday, right after her pre-market earnings release. I'm outta here. Good luck folks, maybe I see you again in 3 months, if DIS gets perky and becomes highly over-valued once again. :-)"
Buyer under $170
 so much for blowing away earnings. Right back where ya started.
From $97 to $200

"recent trips to WDW and Disneyland. Parks are at 75% easily, everyone is paying full price in California with no APs and they have a reduced staff. Will have big park profits"
BLUE HORSE SHOE LOVES .... VIAC.... check out the 2pm price spike yesterday and look at todays pre market... looks like the buyout rumors are picking up.... don't miss that train....
They will 200$ tomorrow!
Disney is like the rest of this Country. A total mess.
Disney. I sold. Disney used to be about profits and a great dividend. Now it has doubled in value because I have to believe how many paying steaming customers they have? I tried Disney Plus. Rerun after rerun after rerun. No one cares about earnings and dividends anymore. They just look at metrics that analyst make up so you buy into their BMW payment.
"This stock has plenty of reasons to support the bear thesis such as covid resurgence, slowing Disney + growth, and getting too political.However, consider all the avenues that support the bill thesis:1. Pricing power. This is HUGE. Disney is THE place to go for quality entertainment. They can increase prices (hello inflation!) and still sell out their parks.2. The Great Reopening. Roaring 20’s era could be back! I have 3 kids and guess where they want to go?! In a booming economy and stock market, people will spend. Disney will be a great benefactor.3. Covid Resurgence. Wait. Wasn’t this in my bear thesis? This will obviously kill profits in the short term but the stock market is forward looking. Disney + will start growing faster again which is what really has the market excited in the first place.4. Inflation. Disney generates plenty of revenue off material items, but what it really makes money off is experiences. While no one is immune to some pain from inflation, since Disney makes most of its money on experiences this stock is a great play on inflation.5. Continuing Multiple Expansion. Disney is a premium brand that deserves a premium multiple. It’s already being given a great multiple, but if Disney was able to hit $120 per share pre streaming then imagine it’s multiple in 2023 after it’s had a long time to show big profits after movies, theme parks, cruises, etc are back. If they can make 50% more EPS then the stock should be near $200 not even counting streaming. Throw in a multiple that is 75% of Netflix’s multiple and you should have a $300 stock. This of course assumes streaming continues to grow, albeit it clearly has its best growth days behind it in streaming.Forget timing the stock at the bottom. It could hit $140 if the economy closes down again (which it won’t). I bought in 3 batches. Every sell off is a long-term opportunity. Wall Street rewards those that are patient and eats up the impatient. Start nibbling now before earnings and buy some more after. Sell some covered calls to lower your average price and be patient. Good luck to all!Summary - Buy Disney."
Wait until the street figures out that VIAC also has sports content and a PE of 7 vs DIS PE of 50. They will likely also license their content to the sports betting companies.
I hear all kinds of comments that are outrageous such as how it is going to drop or go to 200 by tomorrow. Realistically I do think this stock will go above 190.00 tomorrow.
imho this stock is worth more than 250usd
"I wish I could believe in this valuation ,then I could buy the next months for an average around 150. But I do not. This company is never worth 370 Billion. Maybe 100 Billion Max."
Disney continues to lose $2 per share a day. What is wrong with you Disney?
Will add more shares of this great stock Monday.
Disney+ will cover the parks loss for now… then i think we will see $250 in a few months!
"yesterday Scarlett,today Emma Stone and Emily Blunt are studying their options which means more lawsuit are coming.Bob Iger should've never left Disney the new Bob is going to destroy Disney reputation."
BANG!!!! Nice!
We expect to see great earning ?
Disney is a long term winner. will be here in a hundred years. enjoy!
I still have $191 shares at 60 shares..I will dump as soom as $192
Rachel Nichols is done at ESPN. Wow... that will hurt the viewership of the NBA.
Shorts are done here
Good Earnings Today Coming let’s close Up !
"Disney expected to report a strong quarter because of super easy year over year comparisons however disney expected to WARN or LOWER Guidance for NEXT quarter which will TANK the stock also I expect very weak Disney plus subscriber growth because all the Disney lovers already subscribed and not much new content available plus fiercer competitiveness from many others.. expect to see about 8% to 10% stock drop tonight Imo..,"
Best earnings ever and growth
Breakout to $200
and we are finally here at ER. I am looking at a solid report BUT fear guidance may be the story of the day. Fear of COVID Delta may take center stage if they do not set the fear of shutdowns again DIS can take off over $200. Thoughts?
Let’s do this Disney!You got this. 
DIS shareholders are happy to do without any dividend for a long time. So why not invest heavily in expensive streaming content and the parks? Maybe shut the parks overseas down for a year and invest there heavily? Pile up more debts?Shareholders seem to like it and are ready to wait.
"Why is Disney different? How many stocks sunk on very positive earnings this quarter?Forward guidance was blamed, well school's are starting up again. Co vid is ravaging Fla.and the new south American variant is a serious threat as it may be vaccine resistant!Stocks like Trivago and others have floundered.Why is Disney different?"
did they mention the dividend on the call at all?
"DIS Finally broke down to another LOD. Slo-Mo collapse. 90 minutes left for this to go down all the way to $179.27 and turn me Green. Don't think we'll quite make it, but....gonna stay Short. The Trend is my Friend. Meanwhile me next Pure Earnings Short Sell play, YOU, has sold off quite a bit in recent hours, from her HOD. Oh well, impossible to find an exact top or bottom, we just do the best we can. Still planning to throw all my money into a YOU Short Sell after 3:30 ET. Overvalued, recent IPO, looks like a company with some long-term potential, but it's gonna sell off on Monday in direct response to her pre-market earnings release, IMO."
This is my worst performing stock ! And I bought in Dec 2020 at $170
To all shorts
"I am planning to Sell Short DIS later today with all of my available hard capital, as a Pure Earnings play. DIS reports earnings after market close today, and I am expecting weak and disappointing numbers, coupled with significant uncertainty going forward, to result in a serious dip of 5-12% in the stock price tomorrow, Friday. Let's look at this Bloated Baby in detail. First, she is over-valued by any fair and balanced analysis. Price/Cash Flow ratio is very high. Second, despite being a media giant, this company was NOT PROFITABLE in its last fiscal year. No profit, folks! Now, compare the financials of DIS to other media companies and you find VERY poor numbers. Look at Gross Margin, Operating Margin, Return On Equity, Growth Rate, etc... Everything is WORSE than average, in direct comparison to other media companies. Growth Rate, what I consider the most important measure, is particularly bad. But wait, pundits will rise up and say DIS is so much MORE than a media company. It is a theme park and resort ""powerhouse"". Well, as I see it, short term, this business segment is much more a liability than an asset. Yes, all Disney theme parks are ""open"". With tremendous uncertainty going forward. The Delta variant affects children MUCH more than the original Covid virus. Most viruses affect children more than adults. Who is to say how severe and virulent the NEXT variant will be, towards children?? Fact: Theme Park = Germ Factory. DIS theme parks can be expected to be filled with thousands of children from all over the world, and if you read the Disney web site, they do not even do a TEMPERATURE CHECK on their guests. Nope. EVERYONE is welcome! Just wear a mask. And how strictly do you think that is enforced on children, who generally have poor hygiene skills anyway? What responsible parent would voluntarily and unnecessarily choose to take their child(ren) to a Germ Factory masqueraded as a theme park, in the midst of a pandemic?? Nope, I see DIS as being an extremely risky play going forward, and as a Pure Earnings Short Sell for today, it offers excellent odds of a 5-12% share price collapse in direct response to today's earnings release."
Revenue handily beat estimates ($17.02B actual vs. $16.76B estimate).EPS crushes estimate ($0.80 actual vs. $0.55 estimate).Disney+ subscribers also above estimates (116M actual vs. 114.5M estimate).Stock up $8 initially to $186.
"So much value in Tech. Disney, Apple, Amazon, Paypal, Micron are all sitting at great prices"
"Going red shortly. This is just the way Wall Street tricks the little investors. Everyone should have sold at the opening. Every, so called, expert is ripping Disney apart. I would like to see what they are paid to spread rumors. I do believe this stock will go up this year but down to $175 we go for now. I hope everyone sold earlier."
"Disney is still one of the best streaming + recovery trades, if it goes up after earning, will sell calls; If it drops, will sell more puts. Either way I'll be OK with the outcome, long DIS since it's $26 and add and trade around the short term positions."
Price target cut to $200.
Can’t hold any gains. All news already priced in. $178-$179. Maybe after earnings.
"Straddle was priced too low. Going to exercise my in The money calls tomorrow morning, let it run up sell some covered calls with a long put."
You all need to snag some babyf. No negative comments until you check it out. If it's not compelling fire away. One of the most undervalued stocks in the market.
"Here it is, another new LOD as we break down towards the $182.00 mark. Come on DIS, you know you want to go Red before the day is over. I need a few pennies of profit, clawing my way back from an $8k paper loss in today's early pre-market."
"The execs that run Disney just looking out for themselves. Dividend was not reinstated dissing the small investor,"
Wow!!! Excellent
let me know when the 250 price targets start rolling in . anytime now . Never go against the MOUSE HOUSE>
$200 Target
Bring back the dividend already
Let me tell you! about Disney stock and my trouble.This Disney is very frustrating stock. It never moves up in other days but only during Earnings and then it goes right back down to horrible price. I held Disney for last 5 years and I am done holding.I will sell my last batch 65 shares if hits anywhere around $191
These after hour surges suggest we are going to have a nice ER! Go Disney!
Has anyone heard if Disney will hire Cuomo in their HR department?
"The chart shows the RSI has bumped above the breakthrough neutral level and is at 56.53 in a Bull Cross Pattern, maybe this will try to retest the minor resistance at $185.20? From the WSJ August 27th, “Walt Disney Co. ’s ESPN is seeking to license its brand to major sports-betting companies for at least $3 billion over several years, according to people familiar with the matter, aiming to capitalize on the fast-growing online gambling industry.” Great news but ESPN has been cautious about entering the sports-betting arena, hopefully they won’t be late to the party. Good luck & great investing!“Sometimes we stare so long at a door that is closing that we see too late the one that is open.” - Alexander Graham Bell"
if $dis gives bac DIV ...to the moon
"Can someone explain why Dis. cant hold over 180 even with all teh ""good"" results...?"
"Hahaha, this is why DIS is awesome!"
"This is the one company that can hold up no matter what…inflation, COVID-19, etc. We could have a depression and people would still find enough money to go to Disney and have Disney+. This stock should easily be over $200."
i wonder what the stock would be at if it did not post great earnings......sheesh
"I bet Drew is downplaying this huge quarter claiming his bear case is still very much intact. This quarter is only a taste of things to come. Only a moron bets against DIS expecting to get any meaningful return. I never short companies that make life better for people provided they are doing it honestly and transparently. The only way shorts can get a meaningful return from DIS is if the Delta Variant manages to cause us to go into economic lockdown again, and that is very unlikely."
"I think people outside India do not know that Disney also own Hotstar in India, the largest streaming service and it’s subscriptions are increasing every month… the potential it has to grow there is immense…."
Hopefully it breaks 195
14 days to earnings call!!
Going to break 203 tomorrow
PE of 302 / Market Cap 331bn with annual revenue 65bn - something tells me this will get slaughtered when the market next adjusts.
All that nice gain post earnings gone........and so it goes in the market. Many sucked in at highs Friday morning.

nice bounce off the 200ma. Were still headed higher probably 180 -185 short term unless earnings report is positive or neg
Germany's largest newspaper the BILD has just apologized to its readers for the harm it caused society by promoting and sensationalizing the fake pandemic. We can't even get ABC News to apologize for 2 years of Non-Stop Russian collusion hoax misinformation.
Finally a company who’s stock price is positive after earnings
"Family of four= $60 in tickets, $24 in Popcorn. $30 for Black Widow and Spacejam this week! no brainer $325 stock all day. Merica..."
Cruella is finally offered for free on Disney+ and it's much more enjoyable than I anticipated. I highly recommend watching the movie. It should help bring new subscribers to the platform also.
The cruise ship line and Chinese Theme park is destroying the stock.
Don’t look like it’ll go beyond 185 the way it’s pulling back!!
That sinking feeling again today…
Going over $200 within a month.
Disney eats netflix lunch will show in earnings..
"Disney can do anything! They are not locked in to one thing, the revenue streams are everywhere for them. They could make a car or even start there own football team if they wanted and people will buy it."
"I see $186, now make some magic and turn it to $206!"
Yet more reason to avoid DIS!! Mr. Disney is rolling in his grave as DIS continues to push the PC agenda!!
"Disney should replace anyone in the Marvel Franchise that thinks they are irreplaceable. No one is irreplaceable, even Kevin Fiege......enough already ! Disney owns the Marvel Franchise, not Fiege or Johansson or anyone else, and is about time that Disney drop the hammer on these folks!"
"Cruise line has me cautiously optimistic, but very bullish about the other divisions. Long and strong!"
Lower interest rates should put higher value on DIS and other tech growth companies.
Predictable money machine. Super stock.
"Since Yahoo like to remove by links to trip adviser, here a current review of 1 star recent review of the Disney World experience:Unsafe! A COVID hot spot!Jul 2021Please disregard any claims that they have any precautions in place to prevent COVID spread:1. Crowds beyond space capacity.2. Disinfection and cleaning claims untrue and impossible due to understaffing and overcrowding.3. Masking guidelines not enforced indoors and outdoors. Again understaffed and overpopulated; How could they enforce anything?4. Lines are least an hour long.Make an educated decision: before accepting their fine-printed disclaimer on COVID risk when you reserve, be informed that the claims that they have COVID safety precautions are FALSE.My vaccinated daughter came back with COVID-19 Delta variant despite being masked."
Nice move DIS this was up AH yesterday by $10. Only closed up today $1.
Disney will never fail !!!!You know why ?It’s Disney !!!! 250 by end of year !!!
"Disney should buy the Jimmy Buffet brand, music library, and Margaritaville trademark."
Buy opportunities is coming.Dis could defeat COVID.
"DEAR DIS MANAGEMENT............That's it! I am finished with you! I have eliminated Disney World from any future vacations and purchasing anything Disney. I have always stayed at on property hotels but the nightly parking fee and this Genie #$%$ is the last straw. After some 2 dozen trips to Disney parks it is time to say Adios, Au Revoir, Say?nara, Ha det bra, Good Bye, etc. etc. etc. For the price of a one week Disney World vacation including meals I can stay on a ocean front property in my home state for almost three weeks including meals. And, I don't have to spend 5 - 6 hours a day standing in line and that was using 3 fast passes a day!"
$190 by Labor Day! Just watch.
Disney parks are now 80% full capacity
This is one of the shorts
DIS reported strong third-quarter fiscal 2021 results on Aug 12. Earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate
"this should be good!Disney purchased the distribution rights to the docuseries The Beatles: Get Back which is expected to air on Disney+ November 25-27, 2021."
It's funny to think that a message board and retail investors will affect the market price to any great degree. We are just blips in the stock charts. We are all being played by the market makers who really decide what the market will be. To think anything else is delusional. We are all being played.
Going to sell a some shares to ensure earnings are good and Disney skyrockets. You’re welcome 
"If I still held Disney, I would sell with the Genie+ and Lightning Lane news. Both are being spun as more convenience and flexibility, but they’re literal money grabs to replace the free FastPass. Here’s the beef though: it forces you to spend the day on your phone while walking around the park. You can’t disconnect. You can’t even plan ahead. How should you know when to reserve meals when you don’t know when you will be on a ride on the opposite side of the park? It also doesn’t appear to incentivize staying at Disney resorts. It’s just bad news. They are whittling away what little magic the parks have left.I would have given my last hundred bucks to Walt to help finish his park. Today I’m sure he is rolling over in his grave with what this company is doing."
"I have 9,534 shares have never sold any since 1984. Say what you want but I will keep."
pfe 3 vaccines revenue and diviy cant bet that. Disney will go up news next earnings.
Raise your hand if you purchase my $3000 short at $189.49 in the pre market.Thanks Sports Fans!
"Great ER, great overall numbers, positive outlook! Yet DIS could not hold onto their AH price close to $190 after their call. I do not understand how with such great results we get a measly 1% gain. Also there have been some raised price target to around $225. Simply stated, this is an illogical price with no real fundamental basis but looks like some emotional reaction to COVID fears vs results."
"Well! It appears I ""DREW"" the Right Conclusion.....Where is Drew???? Covering his deluded short bets against BEST OF BREED Disney!"
just remember disney is eating netflixs lunch. disney has the content. net- flix is horrible
Sleeping giant…holding 50 shares and I am long but we may not have an earning surprise tom. Let’s wait for the Q4.
"My opinion is that as Sports betting continues to be legalized in the states, ESPN will become more valuable to Disney. I think Disney will come back bigger and better than ever after Covid calms down. Children are born everyday in this world and what parent doesn't want to give their child the Disney experience be it on TV or at the parks and on a cruise ship."
They should reinstate dividend.
Nice come back from this morning. 
Scarlett Johansson sueing Disney? Really? Disney makes someone who wouldn't get noticed in a Cleveland dive bar into a almost attractive superstar who is almost attractive. She should pay Disney.
FDA full approval of Pfizer/Biotech vaccine will encourage more people to get vaccinated so we can stem the tide for virus spreading. This will favor the reopening trade and DIS is part of it. Selling more puts at $175 to accumulate shares. Good luck.
Small tip: check videos from Jeremy Grantham. Especially his bubble theory and what he says about level of optimism.Then ask yourself: how optimistic is the level on DIS ?
AMC is planning to buy Disney after the AMC mother of all squeezes.
Should see $190.00 soon.
"$263 stock, and any less is undervalued."
Aaaaaaaaand here is the dip!!!! Everyone hold on 
Duck duck go James Gunn Disney rehires.
Buy dips. Delta and market pull backs effect it. Valuation rich if market corrects. Keeps price here. I was pumped at $144. Chapek no factor. Iger and Eisner were. CONTENT wins
Pitiful Disney. Just pitiful.
awesome results!!! Disney you rock
"Parks full , reservations for the rest of the year sold out , cruises working good with the new regulations and Disney + growing and growing"
Told you all they were making money.
"To those who argue it's in her contract. How many pandemics have you guys lived through? Scarlett will have made at least $30.0M on Black Widow. Disney's decision to delay its theatrical release helped her a little bit at the Box Office. The contract was negotiated without a pandemic in mind. PLUS, most haven't even seen the contract. Disney believes they're in the right. I'd suspend judgment until you learn more. Frankly, I think Scarlett's decision is disgraceful given how much she's probably made across 9 movies."

"Indicators are showing this stock is heading to 181-182 tomorrow, and will wait for the earning report to determine the direction. Good Luck!"
I for one love the Disney experience in Florida. First time there was 1983. It’s always clean and the Hotels and landscape are kept beautiful.I agree it’s getting pricey but that’s business just like any other resort.
Record earnings and things have only begun to open up! COVID will pass--

"The key to a successful sports betting platform is having an already established user base (approx. 700k streamers subscribed!) and 900k expected by year end. This user base can be parlayed into sports betting and even sports NFTs down the road if they company so chooses to explore this area. DraftKings $DKNG is doing sports NFTs currently and it's a massive success for them. FUBO is also backed by Comcast $CMCSA and Disney $DIS, think this is huge? YES."
"Went to Covid World this weekend,any chance you people with your millions of shares can persuade the Disney leaders to fill they sanitizers.99% of them were empty."
Too funny.
"I agree with those who believe that DIS is posed for a breakout. This stock has been on a plateau for the past year after is had a great 2020 run after the pandemic hit. The fundamentals have now catch up to its valuation, so going forward we should see new ATH's soon."
"The good earnings report, means economy is opening."
Disappointing past 6 months. This is the perfect recovery play and it’s selling off consistently.
"When will we see dividends start up again, any thoughts?"
"It should be crystal clear now, that the Board needs to make some major changes, quickly before the company goes completely down the tubes."
Not even close to its ATH. Still a lot of upside in the next few weeks.
"We got bingo!! Toot, toot!!"
The company is so good and it frustrating because the stock price doesn’t reflect it Should be 200
Just one word folks ... BLOWOUT!!!Starting tomorrow Disney may start trading at $200+Go DIS!!!
We need a dividend again this stock has been bearish for to long
back to back blowout earnings and we're again at the same place! amazing
"Do people really think this few million dollar thing with Scarlett moves the stock? This is ridicolous. It is the structural problem with masks they have.Their products, movie theaters, cruise line trips, park offerings have a structural problem here."
Anyone know what the mask situation is at Disney theme parks?
mickey kicked netflix in the snarkles
"I suspect we’re going to see a wave of Disney Plus cancellations from the ugly drama between Johansson and $DIS. The content available is too small, many people only needed a small reason to shut it off until Mando S3.I canceled my subscription. I don’t even like her that much. Plus, “underpaying” female actors relative to male peers makes an entertaining narrative in the weeks ahead. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, et al got paid very well for their solo projects."
"Mickey go to the moon. Under $200 SP are extremed bargain, considering Disney will surpass Neflix in streaming subscribers in the near future."
Ed. Disney execs out for themselves. No dividend or stock split mentioned.
I am long DIS! Go DIS! It’s still a great company
"Here we are, 20 minutes into the regular session, and the Bulls are holding....on, for now. But the move is small, 4% or so. This was way over $189 in both the AH session yesterday, and the early PM today. So, the trend is down and I see close to a 50% chance that DIS will still turn Red on the day before market close. Staying Short and feeling much more comfortable that this has already hit her HOD and won't be able to even come close to breaking above $187.50 for the rest of the day."
"Amazon performed in the pandemic, so did Alphabet, so did many stock, Apple. But Disney they did not perform and brought ridicolous numbers. They even had to lock down their parks and shut down the cruise lines. They did not perform."
Stronger US dollar and upward movement = happy foreign investors
https://www.marvel.com/movies/black-widowLet's see if this movie brings up the stock price on Monday or Tuesday.
Breakout to $190s soon
Slowly they realize that it was an obscenely overvalued legacy Media company turned propaganda fertilizer spreader yesterday. And it still is today and that hasn't changed.
"Revenue in Europa is over 11 percent only 80 percent is in Canada and the US, Asia also a lot. So governments in Europe and Asia put the Health first over business. Health is everything. So the test and mask mandates will stay forever. It is not enough to get vaccinated in my opinion.Health is so important that capacity of parks needs to be reduced a lot, and certain things like meeting of characters should be totally stopped.Also strict fines should put on people harming the rules in the parks forever. The parks need to be like the most controlled areas as they are always possible areas for viruses spreading around.If the americans will pay more and wait in overcrowded parks so that Disney can use the gains to operate the loss making parks in overseas, it is ok though."
DIS popped a bit right now.
Disney turned into a Dem/Leftyrag
"The masks are back and the anti vaxxers won.On a happy note,all those masks on clearance for $1.99 in the Disney stores can all go back to $9.99.Mo money ."
"I hate to say this ,but I think the price will end up in the red today. You cannot beat Wall Street"
300 after earnings
People are chasing short term gains in other assets. They will come back and this will break $200. They are positioned for exponential growth on all fronts but esp digital which when monetized will fix the PE problem below.
I will be selling all day long north of 190. In 2018 the company earned 12.6 billion or roughly 8.36/share. The high share price was 120. People are crazy paying 190.
"Nice report today, but it would be nice to get that Dividend back too! Remember Disney that was supposed to be a short term thing !?"
When others see panic I see opportunity. World not ending but will go forward…
Holding 170 Nov calls will wait for 200.
Really Disney?
Today would be a good day to sell your Disney and let everyone know that you stand with America
Disney spectacular earnings report didn’t last even 12 hrs
"no matter how good DIS is ,It is always not good to release any good earning or news towards a weekend. It can never stay up!! Looks more like closing below $180.!!"
"Disney+ is currently available in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Netherlands, the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, France, Belgium, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Denmark, Monaco, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Paraguay, Bolivia, Venezuela, Panama, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Uruguay, Ecuador, Dominican Republic, Antigua & Barbuda, Bahamas, Trinidad & Tobago, Belize, Haiti, Jamaica, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, St. Lucia, St. Kitts & Nevis, St. Vincent & the Grenadines and Suriname.Disney+ plans to launch in all major markets and more will be announced soon."
"I think disney will go down after earnings. Although eps will be beaten, they will miss the analist disney plus subscriber goal. Look at netflix why should disney plus be better, many new movies disappointed. I think at least one third of disney's market cap is based on disney plus so it has to go down afterwards."
Lovely stuff. Now let’s hope they say something about reintroducing the dividend. What time is the call?
Puts ready!!!!
After such a report Disney should be skyrocketing People are crazyThis should be up ALOT MORE
"Greed. I can appreciate that Scarlett wanted more, but she's made $20.0 million to date on Black Widow, she earned some form of royalty on Disney+ sales, and let's face it, the movie was never going to make a billion dollars at the box office right now. Lastly, she wasn't very good in it! Florence deserves $20.0 million."
Johansson's suit may be a problem for Disney's dual platform roll out strategy unless this is just a matter of structuring star's contracts in a different way.
"What institution , bank or hedge fund is shorting Disney ??"
July 2022
You guys are welcome. I sold 10% at close ensuring this would be a beat. 
"If you like far left deep state propaganda, you found the right stock."
"More tidbits from earnings release:* 174 million total subscribers across Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+. Netflix has 221M.* Parks division returned to profitability this quarter as well despite the ongoing Covid concerns/restrictions.CNBC had Disney analyst on who said Disney could still be an acquirer or intellectual property and/or content providers with their large cash position.Stock is now up about $11 per share to $189. Fingers crossed that earnings call and CEO Bob Chapek's call on CNBC (Mad Money @ 6pm EST) continues the good news."
"Estimating Disney+ subscription revenues by the numbers broken down...100 million subscribers = $700 million monthly and $8.4 billion year revenues.300 million subscribers = $2.1 billion monthly and $25.2 billion year revenues.Hypothetical if Disney raises the price to $12 per month by 2024...(You know they will just like what they do at the parks)350 million subscribers = $4.2 billion monthly and $50.4 billion year revenues.In summary, by 2024 Disney will be making $50 billion in Disney+ which excludes figures for ESPN+ Hulu and HotStar, and this is a business that NEVER EXISTED BEFORE! They will continue raising prices at the parks in the meantime and in just a few short years, the company will be making well over $120 billion in revenues. That just about doubles the amount of money they earned pre-pandemic in 2019. So if you don't see this as something remarkable and a great investment, you might need to get a doctor and get your head checked. Disney is a gold mine just waiting to happen over the next few years!"
Real value right now $190
"Is Dis better than Netflix? One weekend, one awesome new movie, $215 million ticket sales… yes, I like my Disney choice. They haven’t even begun all the action figures and merch sales with the Black Widow."
Shorts love COVID cases again right??
"even if you need vaccines to get into the park it will be fine due to DIS building their Ecommerce up. I will not be getting a vaccine nor will my children, but we do support Disney+."
I like 180. It gives me a chance to but more undervalued shares. Who wants this at 300 when you really need 6 months to build the position that you really want to sell at? Sorry everyone but you’ll need to wait until I have a full allotment of shares.
Watch this close over 180$ next week. Trust Technicals when theres no news.
Jump on AMC before its too late. Disney has peaked.
"During an earnings call, Moderna admitted the so-called vaccine only lasts 6 months and people will need a ""booster"" shot.Looks like today's horrible Disney Park experience IS the new normal.""We believe a dose three of a booster will likely be necessary to keep us as safe as possible through the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere,” said Moderna President Dr. Stephen Hoge during the call. The piece also pointed out the Pfizer and BioNTech report of their own mRNA vaccine durability, which showed that the estimated effectiveness of the vaccines decline more than 12% after 6 months. One notable revelation from the New York Times report was that the strength of the antibodies against variants “waned substantially by six months after the second dose,” for those who have received the Moderna coronavirus vaccine."""
What’s causing today’s dump?
Having read a great deal of posts I can be sure that Disney will either go up or down in the future. Is that correct?
Just added to position. Great company. Time for this stock to break out from its consolidation.Re-opening trade and will hold very long term.
Shorts want the end of the world just for money
glad I dumped post market yesterday
"Morning Disney Investors! Here's today's LATEST 2 star review for the ""Walt Disney World Resort"" that can be found on TripAdvisor. Looks like Universal Orlando is now a better vacation experience than Disney.""My family went to Disney’s Magic Kingdom on August 1, 2021. All of us wish we had gone somewhere else. We only saw a few characters, not even Mickey Mouse. We went in 2011 and it was great. They had a section called Toon Town, or something like that, where they had Mickey and Minnie and some other characters. It’s not there anymore. What’s Disney without Mickey? There’s not anything for little ones to do at the park. Of course the lines were long and the park was crowded. What happened to limited capacity? As a child, I went to Disney every year. Sometimes, we would go more than once a year. I’ve taken my own kids 4 or 5 times. But, our last trip will be the last. We also went to Universal and everyone had a great time."""
5% up on over 3 million shares after hours…my guess is we hit 192 tomorrow…Anyone else?
"Here's My Thought for DISNEY to expand Streaming Entertainment by Taking a $500M Stake in fuboTV (FUBO). DISNEY Owns ESPN and with that They Could Invest into A Shelf Offering to expand on FUBO who has made The Sports First Their Calling Card. It goes deeper then that; Recent M&A by FUBO has FANTASY & GAMBLING Launching in Q3 & Q4 for Sports and Other Games of Skill. The Streaming Entertainment has been able to hone in and TARGET MARKET Specific Demographics to Where The Media Advertising is Shifting Ad Spend which can be seen by ALL Streaming Entertainment Companies. DISNEY could get a Seat At The Table with an Investment such as The $500 Million FUBO is seeking and BOTH Platforms Compliment Each Other. I won't get into Details because as a DIS LONG and for Those Of You Whom Know Me Know I have The Same Birthdate as Mickey Mouse (No ember 18th) and MANY Believe I have a Crystal Ball because of My Uncanny Ability to See The Future. (A Little Humor w/Seriousness Attached). I will end with STREAMING ENTERTAINMENT has a VALUATION MEASURE OF ROUGHLY 20x PRICE TO SALES and FUBO has a A PRICE TO SALES A FRACTION OF THAT. Also, DIS, FUBO, & DKNG are The TOP 3 STOCKS TO OWN GOING INTO THE 2nd HALF OF 2021 BY INDUSTRY EXPERTS and FUBO can be SQUEEZED which Could Take that $500M and Turn it into BILLION'S easily Getting The Investment Back and Still have a HUGE STAKE in The Company AND a SEAT AT THE TABLE!! Before Valuations GO UP & The M&A kicks up as a DIS LONG & a FUBO LONG I see WIN-WIN-WIN For Everyone. Take a Look and Pass this on to The Magic Kingdom and ""if"" I'm needed I will PERSONALLY MAKE THE DEAL HAPPEN. It's not to hard to find me..... just call My last Corporations Number. I see BIG THING'S IN THE FUTURE AND I WANT THIS ONE!!Robbie L. Berger, CEOBERGER NETWORK'S INC.(608)***-0000"
I heard about DIS the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Come on $dis..lets make real money!!!!!!!!!!
"Earnings after hours, managing my expectations with this one. It's been months seeing this over $200 and the Black Widow movie barely moved it."
Disney parks are full every single day and special events sold out every single night
$DIS welcome to the world of blowout ER's.
Just wait until this forth wave is done in 3 weeks. Disney is ready to blast off
I am certain we will see $200 in August. Travel keeps increasing no matter how much some would love to see it go away. 2 million travelers every day!!
I hope hedge funds don’t touch Disney this time
"Excellent quarter so thanks for vaccines from NVAX, MRNA, BNTX...."
Bargain for now
congrats to Walt Disney must say! Great results!
Cheers to my Disney longs
People are not headed to the park. With mask in 100 degree weather.
200 after earnings.
Too high for earnings
"Cheers to DIS shareholders - what an encouraging day! I'm expecting more good news with parks, cruises, and on-demand in the coming months."
"Those Disney ""pop"" stories were good reads. I know all retail investors got out. Congrats."
Why is Disney so high when AT&T who owns HBO Max which is awesome not climbing. HBO Max is better. My opinion but of course.
Forced to vaccinations? How can anyone do business with a company that does not respect individual freedom and the Constitution? I urge all citizens to just say no to Disney.
From Disney dream cruise I wish $190 today
disney eats netflix lunch
"young people buy what Disney sells. when everything will be automated, all the work... what else to do than have fun? for me its growth stock with a lot of value."
"bleeding back all of last night's profit, no $189 at the close today."
$180 $190 after earnings
"Let's hope the selling is finally over. If not, I will buy more next week for sure."
"Market still up at 8:58, DIS still up but at $186 now instead of $189. GLTA."
Boom
oil sector is going to be this years goldmine with Sleepy Joe begging for more OPEC oil! learn quick folks!
Easily a $200 a share stock prior to next quarter.
I noticed several sections of the Disney cruise lines have sold out already. Happy income ahead.
I wonder why juergen is sooo silent today 
Most of the new DIS+ subscriptions came from India. This stock will slide back to the $170's when the plateauing US streaming is realized.
hedge funds are manipulating most stocks many good ones like Disney down where is the SEC ? read article they put out negative false news on even good stocks to drive prices down or vise versa so they can benefit from puts and call options a disgrace.
such a crooked market
Europe and Asia will show the US and the US business what it means to have governments who do not care about business when there is percentage of health risk.Yes in the US streaming and parks run fine.Business is incredible. But that is not enough for that valuation.
"Wow, I was told on the MB that DIS was going to $300 +, I mortgaged the home and Invested in DIS, what did I do wrong, oh yeh I listened to all the pros on this MB"
"Cramer said BUY, BUY, BUY DIS today!!!"
"I was at Disney World this week. Absolutely packed. Lines to all rides…some over 100 min wait. Park revenue is recovering with steam! If anything, Disney has come back stronger by innovating new ways to make the parks operate more efficient (virtual queues, food service, online merch checkout, etc). Just go take a look at the app and you’ll see what I mean. Gross margin will look nice for park operations. Get some before it goes up. Oh yeah, almost forgot…summer movie releases and Disney+ boom!"
"DIS just hit another brand spanking new LOD. The downside trend continues. If Scooby were a stock trader Long on DIS, his reaction right about now just might be:"
At some point you think it will come out that DIS has been spreading its misinformation and propaganda in behalf of the dark elements presently trying to subvert the country. Wonder what effect this will have on the stock price.
"Why do investors fade these moves? Disney+ is massively undervalued. Revenues are incremental, high margin, and oh yea, recurring. Parks are packed right now and if shut down, will come back. There’s so much pent up demand."
It pays to be patient. Well done longs!!
Everything is sold out for Disney world in October for the 50th anniversary
The good news just keeps coming. Double news today. Comcast and $DIS = shareholders in FUBO
"priced as a growth stock, so high like never before. over 300 billion market cap, lousy growth additional 50 B or so debt and their business is parks ,cruise lines and theater movies in a pandemic mainly. Really?Also ,they have investors who never calculate numbers instead sth like : All like the mouse, it is worth 400.Ridicolous. But also funny."
That’s it ??
Last day shopping
"Disneyland ad $86/day admission 3 day pass; today just $86/day 1 day pass. Next stop $65/day 1 day pass. Desparation setting in, no attendence. at this rate, Park will shutdown very soon. Summer ending in 3 weeks. Pre-pandemic. $150/day without a blink of an eye."
ha ha aha ah aah ajust make over 9K with 120 shares of $dis!!!!
I love HULU sand Disney+
"$DIS up, ( great numbers) so will $ROKU tomorrow…"
Again - DIS is a stock you buy and HOLD forever. Your descendants will thank you.
"Has went nowhere for the year, go woke, go broke."
"How can anyone be bearish on Disney!?!? Disney sells happiness!! Lifetime hold, don’t care about earnings tomorrow, or even next quarter. Only concern is covid being eradicated world wide. When that happens Disney to $400 a share paying 3 percent dividend"
"But wait, juergen and Drew have been on this board for months saying that the parks would never be profitable again. But the parks and products division is already raking in money again. How can this be? It's almost like they have no idea what they're talking about."
Pros hyped now selling off. Retail buyers ah last night lost big..
Disney retailers snookered  by wall st pros..They hyped it with one hand as they sold with the other..It was 188 ah on earnings day.. look where it is now...
"The best move this company ever made was to buy Pixar. Kids' love everything thats been produced. Writers should be constantly creating new characters and pumping out films that make money on the back end of releases. Stuffed animals, shirts and mugs can have huge profit margins."
Thoughts on $NFLX acquiring $VIAC or do you think $DIS buying $NFLX more likely? Or neither - just Stay the Course!? Any guesses?
Poor Disney shorted
The same people bashing on this board for political reason also likely believe Covid is a farce.. Covid is the only thing holding this down.. you should be buying not selling unless your investments are tied to politics in which case there’s no help for you
Who else getting those dips $OEG $AVPT let’s go baby!! $TSLA $CTRM
where are all the geniuses that believe Disney price would be 300$ in a few months???Corona is back and today it's going down 4% and yesterday another 3% and that's only the beginning dear friend!!!
Disney is not going anywhere for sometimes.. i didn't expect it will go more down after earning!
"How will $ROKU compete with $NFLX, $DIS, $AMZN, $HBO, ETC. in new content creation? The whole point of cutting the cord is not to increase 10X smaller cords!"
I’m here from $100 and long
The sell off was over done .I'm expecting ATH and $200+ after earnings.
"I’m loading up $OEG before earnings. Oversold too huge potential, watching $AVPT aswell. Let’s see what $COIN does and $HOOD"
Disney longs snookered by wall st pros today..They hyped with one hand and sold with the other..Disney park cancellations very high..
Beat on top and bottom line DIS is cheaper today than yesterday. Buy
We are going to have a repeat of Boeing. Everyone thinks this will have bad earnings and then pull back. This is oversold and has been trading flat. Anyone thinking this pulls back more is in for a rude awakening. The Zacks $201.79 PT is too conservative.
"Worth $326B, sure, buy the PEAK! Sellers thank you today"
I know I’m going to the parks to give my family COViD it’s free at DIS that’s why the stock is up!
I should have learned my lesson and sold on the earnings announcement bounce. It always sells off from those big bumps up.
Disney channel has no sports. 
Time to bring back the dividend Mickey￼
This will close in the red today. Maybe as low as $171.00. Look for low $160's next week. The Delta Variation will close the parks again. You will not be able to buy a $8.99 churro for awhile
200 target... hold forever!!!
investors realized that they practically gave their subscriptions away for 50 cents a month overseas....no one likes games when it comes to numbers
I have 60 more shares to sell at $195 to come out even
"I don’t know why I waste my time speaking to these bots anymore, this is literally the definition of a purchase and forget stock"
"as one of my long terms, you love to see it"
Disney needs to bring back the dividend.
New lineup on Disney+ looks good. We should at least be at Netflix levels even with pandemic effects.
Why Disneyland is much better than Magic kingdom in Florida ??
i have the bundle and i’m still going to the parks every year!!! i love disney. the parks would have to get destroyed for me to not to go. people all over the world love disney and will always continue to go as it always continues to revolutionize the theme park and streaming business. our government and news are corrupt. cancel your cable and start living your lives.
it's all green from here - cheers longs and holding strong.
"What happened, I thought Disney knocked it out of the water last week."
dreams of breaking even finally comes true
Don't bet against the Mouse; the Mouse always wins.
"What's more entertaining than ""Black Widow"" and ""Cruella?"" Disney getting sued by Johansson and Stone."
Beat
I think operating cruise ships in a pandemic is not very profitable. Parks overseas too.Streaming will be profitable in 2024 as they say? I doubt it with that content.
It went up on Disney+ subscriber growth and could come all the way back down on slowing subscriber growth.
Sold in pre market before the gangsters
$200 before end of 2025!
A year will have passed and this thing will have went nowhere. Bum company.
"As usual, the first 20 minutes of the regular session will be very interesting and exciting. Do profit-takers, short sellers, and just plain logical traders and investors who don't like to sit on risky and over-valued stocks like DIS, come into the scene and drive the stock price down all the way to Red?? I think there is a decent chance that will happen today, and the first 20 minutes will set the tone for the rest of the day, IMO."
I think my very wise advice to get the vaccine is for all human beings—not just my patients. I think my very wise advice to buy Disney stock on any sign of weakness is for wise long term investors.
Fed will pump to smooth Biden mistakes! Shorts will lose!
"Still Short a lot of shares of DIS at $179.28 average price. If anyone cares, the exact number of shares is 845. Gonna run this one with a 10% Stop Cover, so if she hits $197.20 during the regular session, I will immediately be out of the trade and moving on to the next one. Otherwise my plan is to stay Short until 3:30 PM ET or a little later. Never trust pre-market or AH action on Pure Earnings trades. There is still a very good chance this will open Red, and if not, end up going Red at some point during the regular session. So, for anyone using the Pure Earnings trading strategy, the keys to success are: Discipline, patience, picking the right stock, having a system and sticking to it, and never using Margin. The lack of margin is what gives me the control and freedom to decide exactly when to stay in, when to get out, and how much money I am willing to lose. Although of course, in theory, DIS could open the regular session above $197.20, forcing a greater loss than I ""want"" to take. Not gonna happen here though, the earnings were just not good enough, and there is too much uncertainty going forward for DIS. Good Luck Folks!"
Cathie Wood Buys $26M Disney Shares And Sells $13M In Netflix: What You Need To Know
So much debt now….
