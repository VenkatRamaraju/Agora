"Can someone explain why Dis. cant hold over 180 even with all teh ""good"" results...?"
"Disney expected to report a strong quarter because of super easy year over year comparisons however disney expected to WARN or LOWER Guidance for NEXT quarter which will TANK the stock also I expect very weak Disney plus subscriber growth because all the Disney lovers already subscribed and not much new content available plus fiercer competitiveness from many others.. expect to see about 8% to 10% stock drop tonight Imo..,"
People are chasing short term gains in other assets. They will come back and this will break $200. They are positioned for exponential growth on all fronts but esp digital which when monetized will fix the PE problem below.
"this should be good!Disney purchased the distribution rights to the docuseries The Beatles: Get Back which is expected to air on Disney+ November 25-27, 2021."
"If I still held Disney, I would sell with the Genie+ and Lightning Lane news. Both are being spun as more convenience and flexibility, but they’re literal money grabs to replace the free FastPass. Here’s the beef though: it forces you to spend the day on your phone while walking around the park. You can’t disconnect. You can’t even plan ahead. How should you know when to reserve meals when you don’t know when you will be on a ride on the opposite side of the park? It also doesn’t appear to incentivize staying at Disney resorts. It’s just bad news. They are whittling away what little magic the parks have left.I would have given my last hundred bucks to Walt to help finish his park. Today I’m sure he is rolling over in his grave with what this company is doing."
"Let's hope the selling is finally over. If not, I will buy more next week for sure."
Disney parks are full every single day and special events sold out every single night
Finally a company who’s stock price is positive after earnings
Everybody loves Disney.Everybody.The optimism is at its top.
"Going red shortly. This is just the way Wall Street tricks the little investors. Everyone should have sold at the opening. Every, so called, expert is ripping Disney apart. I would like to see what they are paid to spread rumors. I do believe this stock will go up this year but down to $175 we go for now. I hope everyone sold earlier."
"My opinion is that as Sports betting continues to be legalized in the states, ESPN will become more valuable to Disney. I think Disney will come back bigger and better than ever after Covid calms down. Children are born everyday in this world and what parent doesn't want to give their child the Disney experience be it on TV or at the parks and on a cruise ship."
"What happened, I thought Disney knocked it out of the water last week."
"The chart shows the RSI has bumped above the breakthrough neutral level and is at 56.53 in a Bull Cross Pattern, maybe this will try to retest the minor resistance at $185.20? From the WSJ August 27th, “Walt Disney Co. ’s ESPN is seeking to license its brand to major sports-betting companies for at least $3 billion over several years, according to people familiar with the matter, aiming to capitalize on the fast-growing online gambling industry.” Great news but ESPN has been cautious about entering the sports-betting arena, hopefully they won’t be late to the party. Good luck & great investing!“Sometimes we stare so long at a door that is closing that we see too late the one that is open.” - Alexander Graham Bell"
Revenue handily beat estimates ($17.02B actual vs. $16.76B estimate).EPS crushes estimate ($0.80 actual vs. $0.55 estimate).Disney+ subscribers also above estimates (116M actual vs. 114.5M estimate).Stock up $8 initially to $186.
Disney channel has no sports. 
back to back blowout earnings and we're again at the same place! amazing
Just added to position. Great company. Time for this stock to break out from its consolidation.Re-opening trade and will hold very long term.
and we are finally here at ER. I am looking at a solid report BUT fear guidance may be the story of the day. Fear of COVID Delta may take center stage if they do not set the fear of shutdowns again DIS can take off over $200. Thoughts?
"I see $186, now make some magic and turn it to $206!"
It's funny to think that a message board and retail investors will affect the market price to any great degree. We are just blips in the stock charts. We are all being played by the market makers who really decide what the market will be. To think anything else is delusional. We are all being played.
"Great ER, great overall numbers, positive outlook! Yet DIS could not hold onto their AH price close to $190 after their call. I do not understand how with such great results we get a measly 1% gain. Also there have been some raised price target to around $225. Simply stated, this is an illogical price with no real fundamental basis but looks like some emotional reaction to COVID fears vs results."
what is amazing is the parks revenue. wow
Rachel Nichols is done at ESPN. Wow... that will hurt the viewership of the NBA.
FDA full approval of Pfizer/Biotech vaccine will encourage more people to get vaccinated so we can stem the tide for virus spreading. This will favor the reopening trade and DIS is part of it. Selling more puts at $175 to accumulate shares. Good luck.
"The key to a successful sports betting platform is having an already established user base (approx. 700k streamers subscribed!) and 900k expected by year end. This user base can be parlayed into sports betting and even sports NFTs down the road if they company so chooses to explore this area. DraftKings $DKNG is doing sports NFTs currently and it's a massive success for them. FUBO is also backed by Comcast $CMCSA and Disney $DIS, think this is huge? YES."
"Disney can do anything! They are not locked in to one thing, the revenue streams are everywhere for them. They could make a car or even start there own football team if they wanted and people will buy it."
Going to sell a some shares to ensure earnings are good and Disney skyrockets. You’re welcome 
"I am planning to Sell Short DIS later today with all of my available hard capital, as a Pure Earnings play. DIS reports earnings after market close today, and I am expecting weak and disappointing numbers, coupled with significant uncertainty going forward, to result in a serious dip of 5-12% in the stock price tomorrow, Friday. Let's look at this Bloated Baby in detail. First, she is over-valued by any fair and balanced analysis. Price/Cash Flow ratio is very high. Second, despite being a media giant, this company was NOT PROFITABLE in its last fiscal year. No profit, folks! Now, compare the financials of DIS to other media companies and you find VERY poor numbers. Look at Gross Margin, Operating Margin, Return On Equity, Growth Rate, etc... Everything is WORSE than average, in direct comparison to other media companies. Growth Rate, what I consider the most important measure, is particularly bad. But wait, pundits will rise up and say DIS is so much MORE than a media company. It is a theme park and resort ""powerhouse"". Well, as I see it, short term, this business segment is much more a liability than an asset. Yes, all Disney theme parks are ""open"". With tremendous uncertainty going forward. The Delta variant affects children MUCH more than the original Covid virus. Most viruses affect children more than adults. Who is to say how severe and virulent the NEXT variant will be, towards children?? Fact: Theme Park = Germ Factory. DIS theme parks can be expected to be filled with thousands of children from all over the world, and if you read the Disney web site, they do not even do a TEMPERATURE CHECK on their guests. Nope. EVERYONE is welcome! Just wear a mask. And how strictly do you think that is enforced on children, who generally have poor hygiene skills anyway? What responsible parent would voluntarily and unnecessarily choose to take their child(ren) to a Germ Factory masqueraded as a theme park, in the midst of a pandemic?? Nope, I see DIS as being an extremely risky play going forward, and as a Pure Earnings Short Sell for today, it offers excellent odds of a 5-12% share price collapse in direct response to today's earnings release."
"Why is Disney different? How many stocks sunk on very positive earnings this quarter?Forward guidance was blamed, well school's are starting up again. Co vid is ravaging Fla.and the new south American variant is a serious threat as it may be vaccine resistant!Stocks like Trivago and others have floundered.Why is Disney different?"
Cruella is finally offered for free on Disney+ and it's much more enjoyable than I anticipated. I highly recommend watching the movie. It should help bring new subscribers to the platform also.
congrats to Walt Disney must say! Great results!
Will it continue tomorrow? Or draw back? I feel like it will continue to the upside.
"Mickey go to the moon. Under $200 SP are extremed bargain, considering Disney will surpass Neflix in streaming subscribers in the near future."
I hear all kinds of comments that are outrageous such as how it is going to drop or go to 200 by tomorrow. Realistically I do think this stock will go above 190.00 tomorrow.
"But wait, juergen and Drew have been on this board for months saying that the parks would never be profitable again. But the parks and products division is already raking in money again. How can this be? It's almost like they have no idea what they're talking about."
I am long DIS! Go DIS! It’s still a great company
"What institution , bank or hedge fund is shorting Disney ??"
Disney retailers snookered  by wall st pros..They hyped it with one hand as they sold with the other..It was 188 ah on earnings day.. look where it is now...
"This is the one company that can hold up no matter what…inflation, COVID-19, etc. We could have a depression and people would still find enough money to go to Disney and have Disney+. This stock should easily be over $200."
"How can anyone be bearish on Disney!?!? Disney sells happiness!! Lifetime hold, don’t care about earnings tomorrow, or even next quarter. Only concern is covid being eradicated world wide. When that happens Disney to $400 a share paying 3 percent dividend"
