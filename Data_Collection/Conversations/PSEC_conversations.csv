"Got my DRIP in at Schwab. $7.6873ish. It came in fast this month, and it looks like the DRIP posting on the ex date in July still counted. Good start to the weekend."
"Okay. I was rather expecting the ex-div drop tomorrow.In the words of the immortal M. Ugarte, “What right do I have to think?”Happy Ex-Div Day.Arrives 9/23."
"I bought in years ago at a high price point but have been sitting and reinvesting my dividends which has slowly brought my cost basis down and built up my position. Finally some good news! Stock price is climbing, about at the break even point now. After the good earnings report I may just continue to hold this one."
Will dividend increase this year? What y’all think
Dividend payment tomorrow. I’ll post my Merrill DRIP price when I have it.
"Bought more @ $7.90, $7.80, $7.70, & $7.60.The meant what I said a couple of months ago. I’m happy enough just collecting the dividend. Share price comes & goes. Don’t sweat it."
Earnings on Tuesday 11-6. Dividend announcement should be on same day.
This one is on sale today. I wish I knew why the large drop today post earnings. It was not a bad report for a BDC. Is it the large amount of individual investors who have jumped in here looking for a dividend payday? ...... Getting close to my entry point but not there yet.
A dividend increase back to .08 sure would be appreciated!
Is this a good company? Safe for large sums of money to collect a dividend as well as go up in value? Who's been here awhile...
anyone else not get their dividend for November? I usually get it two days after the pay date. not this month ameritrade here
Borrowing money at 4.95% and loaning it at 12% is what they do all day long!
Made a new 12 months high todayEarnings are strong May be in 3 months they will raise distribution We may see $8 to $9 price in six months
"I'm happy to see the dividend declarations for the next 3 months at $0.06 per month. Yes, I was one of the people concerned a dividend cut may be on its' way after the revenue drop and $0.15 earnings the previous quarter. Let's have another good quarter and hope for a future increase in the divi."
My 2800 shares have been loaned out (with my permission) to short sellers. They pay me about 50 cents a day interest. I paid $9.02 ($6.83-11.16) since 2013. I am feeling a bit shaky here at $9 but almost even + years of dividends. I am still holding and would not be surprised if the dividend goes back to $.08 like it was a few years ago. Looking at historical short interest we are at less than 50% (11m) where we were this time last year (23m).
If the premarket is any judge; the earnings shorts are going to be disappointed.Although it may just be the “dividend capture” guys at work.I’m inclined to sit on the sidelines the next few days.
Up We Go! So glad I bought more at $5. Let's see Robinhood/Reddit get a hold of PSEC!
"For you long term investors, I was curious so I used excel to see how an investor would have come out if they bought PSEC at the IPO. If my research is correct, the IPO was in August 2004 at $15 per share. So 1,000 shares would have cost you $15,000. With dividend reinvestment you would have approximately 4,827 shares today with a value of $32,389. So in a little over 14 years you would have about a 115% return. Not all that great for 14 years. Looking at it another way, you would have collected $16,843 in dividends had you taken the dividend in cash . Not much difference in the net. As you can see from the numbers, not a horrible investment but certainly not a barn burner either. The numbers don’t lie."
"not a dog for sure. I have 14k shares and Yes my value is down around $11k but have received about 45k in divy, so easy math tells me it is better than other investment I have made. just sitting tight for years until retirement. it's a solid investment for long term people."
Report out PSEC beats by .02 and beats income by 11.67 million
"I have seen a couple of posts here about a ""vote"" issue. I own many thousands of shares of PSEC for many years and I have seen nothing or received anything from company or broker concerning a vote. Can anyone elaborate?"
Business environment and interest income have improved or PSEC. We don’t have to worry about dividend payments anymore.
"Looks like a beat to me...For the September 2018 quarter, we earned net investment income (“NII”) of $85.2 million, or $0.23 per weighted average share, up $0.01 from the June 2018 quarter, exceeding our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.18 per share by $0.05 per share. The increase in NII per share resulted primarily from an increase in dividend income compared to the June 2018 quarter.In the September 2018 quarter, our net of cash debt to equity ratio was 75.1%, up 3.5% from September 2017.For the September 2018 quarter, our net income (“NI”) was $83.8 million, or $0.23 per weighted average share, a decrease of $0.08 from the June 2018 quarter.Our net asset value (“NAV”) per share increased by $0.04 to $9.39 during the September 2018 quarter.DISTRIBUTION DECLARATIONProspect is declaring distributions as follows:$0.06 per share for November 2018 to November 30, 2018 record holders with December 20, 2018 payment date;$0.06 per share for December 2018 to January 2, 2019 record holders with January 24, 2019 payment date; and$0.06 per share for January 2019 to January 31, 2019 record holders with February 21, 2019 payment date."
Been buying since Oct 2020. Up over 20% on my cumulative purchases. Won't complain or play dividend harvest.
Reinvested my Preferred dividends @ $8.18.
to da moon and beyond
I got an Interesting phone call tonight:Caller: did you receive PSEC voting prospectus?Me: noCaller: that’s ok. I can record your vote. There is only one question. Board including independent board members recommend a vote in favor of sale of additional sharesMe: I am voting againstCaller: ok. You can vote when your material arrivesMe: how about you record my vote right nowCaller: ok. I can do that but...( sales pitch trying to convince me to change vote)Me: thanks. I am voting against
"I would like to ask a question to you of psec, who of you has this stock I would like to know if it is worth buying this company, I have a money in the bank that is not doing anything there and at least this company pays divident monthly"
Dividend payment coming tomorrow unless you're in the DRIP through DTC program when shares will be distributed next week at a share price of around $7.685.
"How can insiders continue to purchase, month after month and be so wrong, I am amazed that someone is so wrong on this PSEC play so far think the shorts have had upper hand, but insiders continue to buy and buy! Any thoughts how this will eventually play out, I am fine getting a monthly check while I wait."
Why so quiet here lately?
"CEO John Barry Buys 33,004 shares today at $4.98"
has anyone else not received the dividend for this month?
why does psec stock price continue to lag even when we have the longest bull run in history and New market highs? I though stock price would have reached 12 by now
Received my proxy statement on the additional shares yesterday. Voting yes.I see there are a number of businesses beaten down by the pandemic & raising additional funds through selling equity beats taking on debt.
Anyone know if fidelity offers the 5% discount
"We are climbing steady.Upgrades streaming in as we approach $7 . Check out Fidelity rating ""Very Bullish"" And just received my dividend...again! 50k shares held and holding! Long and strong for PSEC!"
Rightly I have been admonished not to pay attention to the premarket.But as of 9:15 everything is red. The Indicies are tanking.And Prospect Capital is up 2 cents.
Average $/NAV is .93x 2005-2018. Now it is .62x and their NAV has gone up the last three quarters. Also EPS rose 13 cents YOY 2017-2018. The management fee is a little high at 2.5% but I am a buyer at these prices and have been for years. I was originally attracted to the stock because of the high level of insider ownership. I believe management has never sold a single share as well. I won’t either so long as the dividend stays at .72+. Happy Investing. :)
it appears that in the last 2 months Prospect Capital has reduced its interest payments by just under a million dollars a month
Is anyone holding this just for the dividends?
"Prospect Capital Co. (NASDAQ:PSEC) CEO John F. Barry purchased 1,000,000 shares of Prospect Capital stock in a transaction dated Friday, December 21st. The shares were bought at an average price of $5.87 per share, with a total value of $5,870,000.00. Following the completion of the acquisition, the chief executive officer now directly owns 37,288,278 shares of the company's stock, valued at $218,882,191.86. The"
"Just received my proxy materials. CEO Barry now owns 106,543,039 shares of common stock, or 27.4% of the totals. COO Eliasek owns 1,529,525 himself."
I only own 107 shares but I'm going holding for the long term and have my dividends reinstated also
"Had a little extra $ from shuffling portfolio around and added a small amount to my position, good luck all"
"I finally sold my 2000 shares that I have had since 2008. I've waited for 8.70 for a long time. Dividends have been great for 13 years, but moving on. Good luck to all!!"
"################################################################################A dividend increase (7c/month) is a statutory must in near future to upheld the BDC status################################################################################Yes, the increase is not just very very likely, it is forced by BDC legislation: PSEC HAS TO distribute at least 90% of net income in order to upheld the legal status of a BDC. So the dividend increase is not just likely, it is a must, the question is when to start with the increase - if the next quarter has a similar net earnings quality as the just released 4Q then November is for sure the date....."
"I am ready to see what they bought with the 3.1 Billion they just freed up! next quarter Net interest income, NAV and the dividend will probably rise, and that's just the start! Good Luck Longs! and thank you to everyone that sold me shares under $4!!"
It’s up. NII has a small increase & the .06 dividend is announced for the next two months.
"Since 1988, when Prospect Capital Management launched our first public fund, we have weathered stock market crashes, credit market dislocations, liquidity crunches, SARS, MERS, H1N1, and now the Wuhan virus. Learning something from each challenge has made us better stewards of your savings.Starting two years ago, we began reducing debt at Prospect Capital Corporation (“Prospect”). We were the only large traded BDC not to quickly elect a lower minimum asset coverage, which would have enabled us to add leverage and grow assets, but only by taking on more risk.When the virus hit, we carried less leverage than almost any other large seasoned BDC. Because of our decision to de-risk, the virus caused our NAV per share to decline 7.9% versus a 13.7% median traded BDC NAV per share decline.Prospect continues to hold investment grade ratings from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, Kroll, and Egan Jones. Only one other BDC has four investment grade ratings.De-risking Prospect protected our NII and distribution. For the 3/31/20 quarter, we earned $68.5 million of NII and paid $66.2 million in distributions. Today, we are declaring distributions for the next four months at the same rate as the past 32 months.While I believe asset values and our NAV should reflate from the 3/23/20 low in the S&P 500, which as of May 8, 2020 is up 31% (and the VIX down 51%), we are staying true to the strategy that has served us well since 1988, managing portfolio risk to protect capital entrusted to us and generate shareholder earnings.As in 2009 when we purchased Patriot Capital, market dislocations are presenting investment opportunities. To provide more financial flexibility, we elected 150% minimum regulatory asset coverage and, as in the past, are seeking approval from shareholders for a one-year option to issue shares below NAV, which enabled us to acquire Patriot.As Prospect’s largest shareholder, I want to increase our NAV, NII, and share price. I believe we now have tools in place to achieve that goal. Should investors see a steadily increasing NAV and NII, we may see our stock price respond.Warm regards,John F. Barry IIIChairman and Chief Executive Officer"
"@ PatrickS ... you stated: "" I would not be surprised if the company declares a dividend INCREASE before the end of 2020."" I respectfully disagree with that: 1) they just spent $101 Million in cash on Floating Rate Notes (that's money leaving the Co) ... they can't afford a div increase 2) since 2013 (every 2 yrs) the div has been cut ... 2013 to ~ $0.11, 2015 to ~ $0.08333, 2017 to ~ $0.06 ... I'll be content if they leave it at $0.06 for 2020 ... but a div increase is hardly on PSEC's agenda. Let's be happy with what we get ... :)"
"Paying off higher interest notes and taking out notes further out at lower interest, plus it beat last two qtr estimates. Looks like they have the cash/credit to maneuver for a quarter or two. Anybody see any negatives to counter this?"
Some profit taking today. That and market fear. Still going to holding and Dripping
Bluestar likes Prospect Capital...
"if the book value is %9.81, why did Wells-Fargo downgrade this stock to %6.50?"
If you’re into a long term play this a fun way to DRIP  your way into nice gains.
The rush to buy PSEC to lock in the 9% yieldcan this stock hit $8?
Div is more than covered and NAV is finally moving up. No way this stock doesn't move up closer to NAV.
Just surprised our Wall Street expert didn’t jump on to say to he bought Amc n game pre robinhood run up and shorted at top.....
I think shorts are covering. Looks like a squeeze going on. I'm holding and put my 22K shares for sale at $25.00 so they can't be borrowed. PSEC is harder than ever to borrow. Shorts must pay borrow fee and Dividends monthly. I feel sorry for them. NOT! On to $8.50 and beyond
does Fidelity offer the drip discount for this stock anyone know?
"Have held 15000 shares for about 15 years. Have reinvested all dividends from the beginning. Have them in 4 separate accounts and honestly have no idea how many shares I now have--going to have to add them up one of these days. Bought them mostly higher than todays price if memory serves me, but obviously bought tons via reinvesting the dividends much cheaper. Overall been a great dividend stock."
"PSEC is primarily invested in a wide variety of industries, including, but not limited to:Business servicesConsumer productsConsumer servicesFinancial servicesFoodHealthcareIndustrialsManufacturingMediaThe only question mark is in regards their real-estate investments. On the surface these investments look like they have been well thought out before funding with much of the investment money coming directly from the property management firms themselves.Considering the cash on hand which has been reported at over $1 billion, they should be in good shape to come through this in fine shape. If there are any new posters here, consider the fact that Dave has never said one thing positive about Prospect Capital...ever. Even well before this corona virus scare."
My $20K potential loss a little over a month ago is now a $2600 gain. Some of your comments back then made me hold on to my 12 year investment for a few more weeks. Thank you longs.
Lets see it!
"up .16 today , must be getting close to the dividend payout day."
"Okay guys, I’m confused. Yesterday Zach’s called it an earnings miss. Today they talk about YTY increases & holding down costs.So, what’s their point unless we say that earnings statements always will have good news & bad?"
"CEO buying back shares. 2 dividends posted after April. As long as they come through, this and a few other divie stocks are, IMO, the best place to be. Hopefully the virus will be under control by July. Fingers crossed."
The all important dividend schedule will be released today with earnings. I believe divy will remain the same. Anyone think differently?
"Acquired 8900 shares @ $5.61 ($49,898.74) on 01/05/2021. Currently up +$5,370.26 (+10.76%) to $55,269.00. Need opinions on the best sell price before earning. My intuition tells me this rise is not sustainable. Thanks"
DRIP through DTC price posted on Prospect's website. May price is $7.8565. Look for the share distribution over the next few days.
Merrill Edge DRIP $7.8755.
Major indices down a half percent or more. Prospect Capital even-ish.Boring is good.
PSEC is currently trading at a discount (.91) of the NAV. Hope someday to see it trade at a premium to the NAV.
"PSEC shares this past year has been near $6.50 most of the time providing a dividend of 11-12%. Now we see share price at $4.40, 50% of NAV / book value. Paying a 16.4% dividend. ( 1.4% monthly! ) We just saw the CEO John Barry buy an additional $100 Million in shares to his personal holdings. He bought under $5/share. Seems like a no brainer at these levels. Even if they need to write off a few bad loans due to the Covid-19 situation and lower the dividend to .5 cents......... you would still be getting a 13.6% dividend. Up side on the stock seems to be $2.00 and temporary down side is maybe .40 cents. I'm in again!"
many BDCs run in the interests of the shareholders are up today..
To think we were $9.25 in mid June. 12% loss in 2 months. Not pretty.

"I have invested in PSEC for 2 years now. I own 20,000 shares. Love the dividend, I will never sell my stock. I love my monthly dividends. Keep buying and hold forever. It pays it's self after awhile."
"Looks like good news ----- : ""NEW YORK, Sept. 23, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Prospect Capital Corporation (NASDAQ: PSEC) announced today the pricing of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.437% notes due 2028 (the “Notes”)."""
"I was thinking of selling my PSEC to buy Capitala Finance Corp. (CPTA). It has higher dividends, higher price, but much lower capitalization (136M). Any serious comments would be appreciated. Thanks. I've been with PSEC for many years and seen the price and dividend drop year after year."
There is no bad news for PSEC at present. No worse than any company during this pandemic. They are still paying the same dividend only in shares of stock .....unless you request cash. They are changing the borrowing leverage allowed on their loans in order to protect the company during the Covid-19 pandemic. Nothing wrong with any of these moves. Perfectly understandable considering the financial pressures this year. Remember the CEO just bought $ 100 million plus of additional PSEC stock for himself. Current dividend 18.25% based on today's stock price.
"When does the earnings and PE ratio get updated on yahoo summary (and other websites)? TTM PE ratio of 18...not any more, right?"
CEO John Barry owns 10% of PSEC. He continues to buy. He would not be adding shares if the eps was declining excessively. The next 2 dividends are locked in .06 per month. 15% dividend rate.
"What are the price projections on psec with the current yield and earnings? Im guessing with the current volume, good reports, and close to 10% yield we should see 8 pretty soon, I dont read and follow psec enough to get a good sense of the real valuation."
"Got to love this stock. Market down and still made money today. own over 29K in shares and PSEC is going to be making my house payment when I stop DRIPing on retirement day the first of the year. Long term is the key, been hanging on to the shares for years. Compounding is the key to all those sellers. Stock price almost doesn't matter. up a penny a day or even is excellent."
"Decent Q for PSEC. You have positive dividend coverage of 17%. An earnings meet, an increase in NAV, and Q over Q improvement earnings improvement. Not much to dislike. Hopefully this will keep Dave the Doofus at bay for awhile. …. On 2nd thought that's unlikely."
Another comment that may not age well.It’s 12:43. The markets are tanking. Prospect Capital is up one cent.I like low beta stocks.
When’s the best time to buy thi share? Considering it was below 8 for a while
"Not many stocks out there with a BUY rating from The Street, Ford Equity Research and Market Edge. This is one of them"
what happens with dividend in excess of a full share? I just enrolled my schwab with drip through DTC. are the new shares issued as fractional shares? thanks in advance.
"Can someone tell me which stock is better than PSEC, because I cannot find any better than this.This stock is paying monthly, very high Dividend & Yield it's amazing!"
"Once again I have to question Yahoo’s volume figures.Right now, at 10:00, it’s showing a volume of 3.06m on an average daily of 1.86m.Has the first half hour truly been so busy?"
"Maybe Barry should buy another, let's say a million more shares to get it over 7 again. It seems like he's the only lift force in town. Not selling, guess I'm stubborn but as the Fed keeps raising rates through 2018 I want to see where this baby goes based on many of their outstanding customer variable loans. You would think it will be a boost to their bottom line and increase the pps. GLTA and Happy New Year Folks. Be Healthy and that my friends is being Wealthy. You would give it all away if terminally ill and in severe pain. My heart goes out to those folks and their families. All else is meaningless without one's health."
Even considering the dividend with the chart price always falling has anyone stayed ahead? It looks like the dividend only helps the overall losses be less harsh. ???
"30% beat estimates, dividend safe for another quarter, lots of insider buying..... should be a good day tomorrow"
"don't understand, insiders buying big time and share prices going down."
What’s everyone’s take on the earnings ? Positive or negative. Earnings call will be august 25
"I keep receiving letters from management asking that I contact them. They asked if I would like to vote “with” management on the proxies in December which leads me to believe that one or more of the institutional holders is getting fed up this management.Given that Mgt’s salaries are not posted (on Yahoo) and the share price has been stuck in the toilet for some time, I’m inclined to believe that there is a move to make a few changes that mgt is NOT COMFORTABLE with. Despite my relatively small holding, I DID (during my call) EXPRESS MY DISCOUNT WITH MANAGEMENT. Yahoo claims that for every poster on these message boards, there are sixty lurkers. FWIW: I intend to vote AGAINST KEEPING THESE BOARD MEMBERS. This company has been stagnant and secretive for too long. Please let me know if anyone out there agrees......even if only by a thumbs up.Thanks."

Each share of Preferred Stock will have an offering price of $25.00 per share, before the application of any commissions and discounts.How will this impact the common stock?.....I'm kinda looking at this and thinking Ponzi scheme......no?"
"now were making higher highs and lower lows, should be on our way to lucky 7"
How much do they pay in dividends a month? .72 or .6
Question for longs here. I am retired and looking for yield. I have had this one on my watch list for some time. I hold OMF KNOP and HMLP. All of those have double digit yields. What makes this one so appetizing to tolerate BDC risk and accept less than 10% yield?
"Feelings are not always valid indicators of reality, that being said, I suspect Trump doesn't care if he wins the election or not. So IF the market falters I feel there will be a flight to income producing stocks. If the market does OK to good, the rising tide will float all ships. If memory serves me correctly the leveraging capacity is lower for BDC's than REIT's. So for traders who want a less rocky ride stocks like T or PSEC maybe a decent choice. PSEC isn't a institutional owned stock and the insiders have a lot of skin in the game, which may bode very well to move to the up side. The dividend has been declared for June,July and August, something to think about."
Im not 100% comprehending this proxy vote situation. why would I want the company to be able to sell shares at a price lower than its value? seems like a no brainer to vote against unless I'm not seeing another side of it
Could this be the “dividend drop”? The stock is supposed to drop ex-div.
Has anyone received the discounted (5%) DRIP from PSEC as of yet? If I am understanding other posts correctly the only shareholders that have received the dividend are those who kept the standard non-discounted DRIP with their broker. Hope this post makes sense.
I think there is a small possibility of a dividend increase of between a half a Cent and a cent They have exceeded earnings in all but one of the last eight reporting periods time will tell
so from June 1 to Aug 2 the preferred offering rose from 100M to 300M issued. I wonder what we'll see next month 500M? 5.5% in perpetuity is a great rate versus commercial loan terms. Another nice strategic move by PSEC management.
Book vale of $9.35 will rise se to $9.50 in one month Stock may rise to $10 by December
"Zero news to cause this pullback, we should have dropped .06 for dividend today."
A great earnings releaseNII $0.21 +$0.06 Q/Q +$0.03 Y/Y NAV $8.96 +$0.56 Q/Q +$0.30 Y/YClearly asset management at it's best.......I will be looking forward to the CC tomorrow. Look for these guys to be strutting their stuff and flapping their wings! Shorts get humbled at least for now.
"I've been holding PSEC for a little over a year and like my other BDC's I'm down around 25% - 30%. So far my strategy has been collect dividends in cash to afford holding stocks until control of the virus is established - pick up a lot or two on the big drops sell as they pop up to make coffee money. Seems a wavy bottom has been established and a treatment for the virus is expected (hoped for) around August/September. Only overhanging concern is reduced or eliminated dividends. One company has changed from monthly to quarterly. Another has posted dividends through September. Another cut .005 off its dividend. PSEC is offering shares at 5% discount. More businesses opening if only in limited capacities. Over all, I see a light at the end of this tunnel. Just hope it's not a train coming our way."
"Can anyone say what your DRIP price was this last month. I am with TDA, and they are swearing the $7.32/share I paid includes the discount. By my calculations, the highest I should have paid was $7.10 based on the daily range"
Down big today. Tax loss selling?
"Wayne, Although I think management needs to address some issues raised by shareholders about fees two factors are improving - LIBOR is definitely moving up in a big way and the FED is reducing the money supply at the same time/raising rates as one can see banks improving across the board."
do the dividends pay out well and are they reliable in this company?
PSEC fills a void in our capital markets which large money center banks tend to avoid. Insider purchases and institutional ownership are bullish indicators. Current income anda reasonable expectation for capital appreciation seem worth the risk at the present time.
Well that wasn’t much fun.My $7.70 & $7.65 buys triggered.The good news is that our DRIP price on Thursday ought to be fun.
"the incoming preferred revenue, plus the dry powder and refinancing notes at lower rate is going to increase NII. When rates start rising NII will increase as well. I am looking forward to a dividend increase! hope to see that in a quarter or 2!"
"Can anyone give me a TLDR on PSEC? I am looking to move into this from REML and USOI as the Credit Suisse products are getting a bit too risky for my taste. This appears to be an investment firm for lack of a better description. It pays .06 cents a share on a monthly basis. However, over the life of the stock there has been a downward trend on its dividends and it also looks like this is a fairly high price. Any flavor you can add is appreciated."
"I sold around 9, had paid around 14. Dropped in to see what was going on. I see a continued decline with people still saying it great. I guess I do not understand it."
"This is simply a D & R stock. You have a choice to take the dividend or reinvest it in discounted shares giving you a larger dividend the following month(s). If you’re good with slowly jacking up a monthly income stream, you are in the right place. If you’re more into guessing buy low sell high and thinking of making a fortune there are hundreds of other stocks to consider."
Does schwab offer the 5% discount?Just got off the phone and they said they don’t. How to fix?
"more insider buying from CEO , great sign of higher valuation coming in next 6 months. any comments on this thought?"
This stock is trading below its NAV of $9.81. That is a steep discount to its current SP. if this isn’t a serious buy I don’t know what is.
$8.66 BOOK VALUE for $5.00 and a 14.5% dividend. A good level to buy at for sure.
Major trading in the last 10 minutes Friday. Options expiration? Gain of about 1%.Ideas?
DRIP price should be about $7.8755. We'll know the exact number on Monday or Tuesday when the shares post.
Any ideas why we’re taking it on the chin today?

Bearish pattern detected
I have very close to 1/2 of my investment back in dividends. Bought in at $8.00 in 2009 and I'm very happy with my return in investment. Long PSEC and continue to purchase
"I got confused guys, just hit me with the answer. Buy?"
I currently have 100 shares at $7.35 and it's nice to get $6 bucks a month (DIV) but I still fantasize about owning a 1000 shares. $60 a month would be very sweet. Shoulda got more when it was down.
"Some point soon we will jump to $5.80. we will stay there briefly and float to $6 ish until there is confirmation that assets have been put to work and both NII and NAV are growing (which will happen). then as covid subsides and economy recovers, we will go higher. As rates rise we will go even higher! As I said for months, buy this stock. reinvest the dividends and you'll be happy in 5 years!"
"PSEC filed that they are redeeming all outstanding 5.000% Senior Notes due 2019, with aggregate principal amount of $153,536,000, on Sep 26, 2018. Debt reduction should help, right?"
you can also get a 5% discount on their drip via dtc gets you close to 10%
I really liked PSEC before this new dividend program is just really diluting everyone. Very glad I saw this in the mid 8s before it was too late. Now they’re in a trap of paying their dividend with a bonus percentage and fully paying out with new issued shares. It was fun getting that monster monthly dividend but it’s not worth when you’re gonna lose big long term.
Today had a swing of five cents day high to low. $7.95 buy triggered.I’m happy.Boring is good.
"usually announce div for 3 mts, only two this q, maybe increase in works."
United Firearms was a situation well known by management far before the announcement of continuing dividends. Last year they advised they were going into a more conservative stance due to the lengthy time of economic growth. I think we have been well served
Hi Dave! 
Another month in the books. Those of us in the DRIP through DTC program should expect our dividends to buy stock at a price of approximately $7.505 when they're issued over the next few days.
New to this but where do dividends go to? Back to the brokerage account? I assume you cannot get it reinvested automatically.
I bought some yesterday @ $7.69. I'm building a divvy cash cow and this one looks solid.
"Prospect Capital amends dividend reinvestment planApr. 17, 2020 4:53 PM ET|About: Prospect Capital Corporation (PSEC)|By: Liz Kiesche, SA News Editor Under the amended plan, Prospect Capital (NASDAQ:PSEC) will reinvest all dividends or distributions declared on common stock in the form of stock for shareholders who haven't elected to receive their dividends in cash.The company will provide newly issued shares at a 5% discount from the market value of the common stock on the valuation date for the dividend or distribution.The change takes effect on May 21, 2020 and applies to the dividend declared on Feb. 10, 2020 with a record date of April 30, 2020 and a payment date of May 21, 2020 and all subsequent dividends and distributions."
"My initial. reaction to seeing this abnormal increase is that somebody's offering to buy this company, or they are dealing to make a purchase of a troubled company that would fit their business at a distressed price. It will be ineresting to see how this plays out."
Merrill Edge DRIP arrived yesterday at $7.505.
July dividend due on Thursday. I’ll post my DRIP price from Merrill when I have it.
Where else can you get over 10% with mostly first lien protected loans and upside if LIBOR rises as expected?
"How safe do you think the dividend is? The last 2 quarters earnings coming in at $0.16 and $0.15 and analysts estimates for $0.15 for each of the next two quarters. It seems the $0.18 dividend is at risk of yet another cut. I know new originations were strong last quarter, so hopefully they can beat estimates and get back close to the $0.18 level to support the dividend."
please explain how zacks got 17 and loss
will be below 7 by EOM...
"initial investment in march 2009, reinvested dividends, and continued to add to position when dividend was above 10%. cost basis is $6.32 so pps 20%, but have 90% more shares. so up about 70% in 11yrs, or about 6% annual return. no great, but not bad."
"The volume today is huge relative to a normal trading day for Prospect Capital. ""The Street"" has had a BUY on this stock for the last 4-5 months or so. We are seeing the company move in ways to decrease its debt while increasing overall earnings. It is obvious that larger trading entities are now buying up shares at these low prices. Whether it is simply an anticipation of increasing profitability and book value and/or a small dividend increase, something of importance has leaked out to the overall investing community.I had predicted this stock to be in the high $6 range once the vaccine started to roll out. We are now seeing how this stock is responding. I am holding for $7+ after next earnings release FWIW."
"so they way I see it, psec proxy will give psec 3.1 billion more in cash. this cash can be used to fund any of the business which they see fit. over 80% of their planned assets are secured. so if those companies are in a cash crunch and need a bridge, PSaeC can bail them out and own more of the company and or possibly take it over and sell it for a profit when this event passes. there are going to be opportunities to put fresh money to work at great entry points as a result of this event. this is why psec wants liquidity. in addition the management fee charged by Barry and Grier is a set fee of basically 20%. so yes their revenue will increase, bit so will the workload required to run the business as it will grow. My thought is Barry will prudently navigate the landscape and bring financial gain. if you didnt think this when you invested, you should have never invested I. this stock. Now is the time for Barry to excel! the other BDCs that provided book value updates like main street capital, only saw about 20% decline in book value. they owned 9% oil and energy equipment and 3% retail in their portfolio. their book value fell by about 20% through end of march and no missedpayment. PSEC has. different book, I get it, but I doubt its alot different result. keep in mind many of the portfolio companies in PSECs portfolio will recieve government funding for payroll through June. PSEC will recieve approval for funding and Barry will lead the company through this event. $3.80 entry is a gift, my opinion."
the Seeking Alpha article on Jan 22 puts PSEC at a hold up from sell with a 6.75 min and 7.65 max price range. not great but not negative. Any thoughts on this article and analysis?
We’re making 9% on dividends. We were up 2 cents while the indices dropped. We had a spread of 10 cents all day.Prospect Capital is a boring stock.Boring is good.
"PSEC just called in senior notes paying 4.95% while at the same time issuing new preferred stock paying 5.5%. I am not an accountant and know very little about this subject. However, it certainly does not appear to make sense on the surface. This move appears to be kicking the can down the road at a higher interest rate. No wonder the stock keeps falling."
Thoughts on this stock for long term hold in retirement
Bought more @ $8.07.
"I would like to share one more thing. Throughout my life I have found that the people who brag the most about their successes are many times the ones who have had the least success in their lives. In addition, success and good fortune become self evident therefore they do not need to be broadcast by those who are filled with hot air and in need of a self generated ego boost."
Buying down the 4.95% notes is a good use of money.
"Strong company, congrats longs ^^"
"Prospect Capital Releases December 2020 Quarterly Results, Announces Net Investment Income of $0.21 per Common Share, Reports 7% Increase in Net Asset Value per Common Share, and Declares Stable Monthly Cash Common and Preferred Share Distributions"
"PSEC conference callWednesday, August 25, 2021 11:00 AM ET"
"Well, management certainly doesn't like the two shareholder proposals to be voted on during the next proxy vote."
anyone not receiving a monthly dividend from this? had since June. nothing.I'm on Trading212
Does anyone have a legitimate explanation why this has been sinking for the past 3 months?
Should see more upgrades coming PSEC is way undervalued with book value at 9.28
"Prospect Capital Announces June 2021 Net Investment Income of $0.19 and 5% Increase in Net Asset Value per Common Share, and Declares Stable Monthly Cash Common and Preferred Share Distributions"
I dont mind if they pay down the higher debt- especially as we move into a higher rate environment.I also don't mind the stock hovering here below $8 and paying the same dividend- especially as I add shares every time I take a profit in a different day/ swing trade....
this is a good looking price. Is there any reason why the SP has consistently been dropping?
Does anyone have the current NAV? All I can find is as/at March
"What you see are sellers who panic and short selling taking advantage of the market. Look at the NAV, the profits, the earnings, the history, and the financial position of the company. The selling will soon stop and the stock will go back over $7 a share. I still plan to buy more shares in a few days when the panic is over. The dividend is not changing down as they take in more earnings than they pay out in dividends, while building up a reserve."
What I like about BDC's is that they distribute a large percentage their net income to you. It's like owning a private investment as opposed to a stock that has price moves based on expectations. Also the net effect of the drip plan is to increase investable assets wIth equity rather than debt and to do so without a big dilution from a secondary offering.
Gotta say I like be idea of a five cent spread on the day.Boring is good.
Stayed in CC that almost 50% of writedown had been recouped since Dec. 31
With book value up now to $9.81 and steady dividend even through the pandemic this seems like an under valued stock.
What's it gonna be boys... yes or no...
amazing posts...
The recent news should move the stock price easily back over $7/share. The consistency of the dividend coupled with the company's new assets (purchase of first lien notes of Payliance) should give all long investors encouragement. I would not be surprised if the company declares a dividend INCREASE before the end of 2020.
Tax plan helps companies PSEC holds debt in which reduces risk. PSEC should rise as result. IMHO
Earnings out. NAV increases 5% to $9.38 per share. Dividends remain at $0.06 through August. What's not to like?
"Are the volume figures correct? Barely 200,000 with the average 1.8m?"
NAV $9.81 a lot of room to run
why isn't the company buying back its own stock at this low price it would drive the price per share up
This stock is being manipulated by some or several institutionsGradual downward spiral from 9.20...........................................like clockwork.........
New PR out this morning..Moody Investment Grade...nice. Might want to read it Davie...
No press release yet at 5:13pm.my guess is a negative release because in the past they released before 4:30 if it was good but I can be wrong..
if PSEC meets the $.21 share earnings and holds dividend for 3 more months what is to be expected on share price? Any intelligent insight to share anyone?
"PSEC at 7.70, looking attractive again!"
"I don’t know if it is $ .50 annually, but it does seem to be in a long term down trend. I have owned it 8 years and although it does have its’ upward movements, the long term pattern seems to be lower highs when it does make an upward movement. I originally bought at arond $11 in 2013 and haven’t seen it close to that since. it seems to continually mak"
"PSEC will continue to rise past $8/share....why? NAV increased far more than anyone expected,they are refinancing debt at much more favorable rates/terms, and we could easily see increase in monthly dividend...as a BDC, they will have to increase dividend if earnings continue to rise. My new limit sell strike is $9.25.In the meantime, I'll continue to enjoy the FAT dividend.Its all good for the PSEC longs....not so good for Dave the Wall Street Guru living in his parents basement!HAHAHAHA!"
Its all fun and games till they cut the dividend... again ;-)
"A little worried, if interest rates go up loan demand down and that slows REIT growth so stock price goes south."
"Let’s not make fun of the new Reddit/Robinhood players. Let’s face it: their addition as PSEC stockholders on helps the longd. I’ve been in since ‘13 and made a lot of 1099 dough. My average cost is $7.50, so I had a substantial unrealized loss for a long time. I didn’t panic. Stayed the course , and now it has paid off. Welcome ALL new PSEC investors! Longs, try not to bash those that do not understand mechanics of BDCs. Good luck, and enjoy the weekend! H9"
"I see a few people really slamming this stock like they expect it to take off like a growth stock. It isn't, it's a dividend stock at a 13.82% return. Even at half that it would be considered good. Over the past few years prior to Covid it averaged about $6- $7 roughly. I would anticipate it being able to maintain $6-$7 price as we stabilize from the pandemic. If your looking for a good dividend stock with growth potential get stocks like OKE and XOM. They are at about half their normal value and pay a good dividend. Crude oil prices aren't great but the stock keeps going up with every positive report on Covid. They will jump big when the vaccine starts circulating in the next few months. Could be a tough decision. Selling short for a good profit or keep a stock that has a history of giving dividends a priority. Even if a dividend is cut in half with a company like that. It's not a deal breaker for me."
"April DRIP PriceBased on today's close, everyone enrolled in the DRIP through DTC should expect to see a DRIP price of $7.67 when shares are distributed over the next few days."
