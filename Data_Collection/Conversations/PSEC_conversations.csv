What the H is drip?????
Merrill Edge DRIP arrived yesterday at $7.505.
Another comment that may not age well.It’s 12:43. The markets are tanking. Prospect Capital is up one cent.I like low beta stocks.
Doesn’t DRIP mean “dilution”?
"Yes, the tender was a huge failure. They purchased only 0.2% of the $81.4 million notes outstanding."
"Got to love this stock. Market down and still made money today. own over 29K in shares and PSEC is going to be making my house payment when I stop DRIPing on retirement day the first of the year. Long term is the key, been hanging on to the shares for years. Compounding is the key to all those sellers. Stock price almost doesn't matter. up a penny a day or even is excellent."
"Looks like good news ----- : ""NEW YORK, Sept. 23, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Prospect Capital Corporation (NASDAQ: PSEC) announced today the pricing of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.437% notes due 2028 (the “Notes”)."""
Another month in the books. Those of us enrolled in the DRIP through DTC program can expect our shares to be distributed at a price of about $7.9135 in the next few days.
A few random thoughts.The tender for the 6.35% notes flopped bigly. Tell me again about “raging inflation”.Indices down premarket. We’re up two cents.Dividend arrives Thursday.
so from June 1 to Aug 2 the preferred offering rose from 100M to 300M issued. I wonder what we'll see next month 500M? 5.5% in perpetuity is a great rate versus commercial loan terms. Another nice strategic move by PSEC management.
what happens with dividend in excess of a full share? I just enrolled my schwab with drip through DTC. are the new shares issued as fractional shares? thanks in advance.
"So, if I sell my DRIP shares soon after the purchase, is that considered a wash sale for tax purposes?"
"Paying off higher interest notes and taking out notes further out at lower interest, plus it beat last two qtr estimates. Looks like they have the cash/credit to maneuver for a quarter or two. Anybody see any negatives to counter this?"
Are they always do DRIP?
I bought some yesterday @ $7.69. I'm building a divvy cash cow and this one looks solid.
We’re making 9% on dividends. We were up 2 cents while the indices dropped. We had a spread of 10 cents all day.Prospect Capital is a boring stock.Boring is good.
Another month in the books. Those of us in the DRIP through DTC program should expect our dividends to buy stock at a price of approximately $7.505 when they're issued over the next few days.
PSEC div didn't hit my TDA account... trouble in paradise ???
has anyone else not received the dividend for this month?
Has anyone checked on dave
