DRIP price should be about $7.8755. We'll know the exact number on Monday or Tuesday when the shares post.
I think shorts are covering. Looks like a squeeze going on. I'm holding and put my 22K shares for sale at $25.00 so they can't be borrowed. PSEC is harder than ever to borrow. Shorts must pay borrow fee and Dividends monthly. I feel sorry for them. NOT! On to $8.50 and beyond
To all forum members !! What is happening today ?? I have not seen that strong of a move since following PSEC
the Seeking Alpha article on Jan 22 puts PSEC at a hold up from sell with a 6.75 min and 7.65 max price range. not great but not negative. Any thoughts on this article and analysis?
"We are climbing steady.Upgrades streaming in as we approach $7 . Check out Fidelity rating ""Very Bullish"" And just received my dividend...again! 50k shares held and holding! Long and strong for PSEC!"
Where else can you get over 10% with mostly first lien protected loans and upside if LIBOR rises as expected?
"PSEC filed that they are redeeming all outstanding 5.000% Senior Notes due 2019, with aggregate principal amount of $153,536,000, on Sep 26, 2018. Debt reduction should help, right?"
United Firearms was a situation well known by management far before the announcement of continuing dividends. Last year they advised they were going into a more conservative stance due to the lengthy time of economic growth. I think we have been well served
Borrowing money at 4.95% and loaning it at 12% is what they do all day long!
"PSEC will continue to rise past $8/share....why? NAV increased far more than anyone expected,they are refinancing debt at much more favorable rates/terms, and we could easily see increase in monthly dividend...as a BDC, they will have to increase dividend if earnings continue to rise. My new limit sell strike is $9.25.In the meantime, I'll continue to enjoy the FAT dividend.Its all good for the PSEC longs....not so good for Dave the Wall Street Guru living in his parents basement!HAHAHAHA!"
"I was thinking of selling my PSEC to buy Capitala Finance Corp. (CPTA). It has higher dividends, higher price, but much lower capitalization (136M). Any serious comments would be appreciated. Thanks. I've been with PSEC for many years and seen the price and dividend drop year after year."
"So this is my first post ever here, but I have held PSEC in my Roth since 2012, lost a bit of share price, but I have always added on dips, but I haven’t seen it this low ever, good and stable dividends, I think I’m backing the truck up and loading up at this price."
"Seems this is undervalued.....if they keep the div at $0.06/month.....anything under $6/share is a steal.... Shorts seem to letting up a bit too.Shares Short (Feb 14, 2020) 10.66MShort Ratio (Feb 14, 2020) 7.73Short % of Float (Feb 14, 2020) 3.27%Short % of Shares Outstanding (Feb 14, 2020) 2.90%Shares Short (prior month Jan 15, 2020) 12.91MBook Value Per Share (mrq) 8.66"
Could this be the “dividend drop”? The stock is supposed to drop ex-div.
Average $/NAV is .93x 2005-2018. Now it is .62x and their NAV has gone up the last three quarters. Also EPS rose 13 cents YOY 2017-2018. The management fee is a little high at 2.5% but I am a buyer at these prices and have been for years. I was originally attracted to the stock because of the high level of insider ownership. I believe management has never sold a single share as well. I won’t either so long as the dividend stays at .72+. Happy Investing. :)
"How safe do you think the dividend is? The last 2 quarters earnings coming in at $0.16 and $0.15 and analysts estimates for $0.15 for each of the next two quarters. It seems the $0.18 dividend is at risk of yet another cut. I know new originations were strong last quarter, so hopefully they can beat estimates and get back close to the $0.18 level to support the dividend."
Does anyone know when shares are added to your account after last ex dividend. New to the DRIP process. I know the actual monetary dividend is added weeks after but thought shares were bought and in your account sooner.
This stock is trading below its NAV of $9.81. That is a steep discount to its current SP. if this isn’t a serious buy I don’t know what is.
Bluestar likes Prospect Capital...
This stock is being manipulated by some or several institutionsGradual downward spiral from 9.20...........................................like clockwork.........
"The volume today is huge relative to a normal trading day for Prospect Capital. ""The Street"" has had a BUY on this stock for the last 4-5 months or so. We are seeing the company move in ways to decrease its debt while increasing overall earnings. It is obvious that larger trading entities are now buying up shares at these low prices. Whether it is simply an anticipation of increasing profitability and book value and/or a small dividend increase, something of importance has leaked out to the overall investing community.I had predicted this stock to be in the high $6 range once the vaccine started to roll out. We are now seeing how this stock is responding. I am holding for $7+ after next earnings release FWIW."
Why the big move?
"I have invested in PSEC for 2 years now. I own 20,000 shares. Love the dividend, I will never sell my stock. I love my monthly dividends. Keep buying and hold forever. It pays it's self after awhile."
buy buy buy...
"Well, management certainly doesn't like the two shareholder proposals to be voted on during the next proxy vote."
"Have held 15000 shares for about 15 years. Have reinvested all dividends from the beginning. Have them in 4 separate accounts and honestly have no idea how many shares I now have--going to have to add them up one of these days. Bought them mostly higher than todays price if memory serves me, but obviously bought tons via reinvesting the dividends much cheaper. Overall been a great dividend stock."
What’s everyone’s take on the earnings ? Positive or negative. Earnings call will be august 25
anyone else not get their dividend for November? I usually get it two days after the pay date. not this month ameritrade here
"I sold around 9, had paid around 14. Dropped in to see what was going on. I see a continued decline with people still saying it great. I guess I do not understand it."
"Prospect Capital Releases December 2020 Quarterly Results, Announces Net Investment Income of $0.21 per Common Share, Reports 7% Increase in Net Asset Value per Common Share, and Declares Stable Monthly Cash Common and Preferred Share Distributions"
Has anyone received the discounted (5%) DRIP from PSEC as of yet? If I am understanding other posts correctly the only shareholders that have received the dividend are those who kept the standard non-discounted DRIP with their broker. Hope this post makes sense.
"Feelings are not always valid indicators of reality, that being said, I suspect Trump doesn't care if he wins the election or not. So IF the market falters I feel there will be a flight to income producing stocks. If the market does OK to good, the rising tide will float all ships. If memory serves me correctly the leveraging capacity is lower for BDC's than REIT's. So for traders who want a less rocky ride stocks like T or PSEC maybe a decent choice. PSEC isn't a institutional owned stock and the insiders have a lot of skin in the game, which may bode very well to move to the up side. The dividend has been declared for June,July and August, something to think about."
If you’re into a long term play this a fun way to DRIP  your way into nice gains.
"@ PatrickS ... you stated: "" I would not be surprised if the company declares a dividend INCREASE before the end of 2020."" I respectfully disagree with that: 1) they just spent $101 Million in cash on Floating Rate Notes (that's money leaving the Co) ... they can't afford a div increase 2) since 2013 (every 2 yrs) the div has been cut ... 2013 to ~ $0.11, 2015 to ~ $0.08333, 2017 to ~ $0.06 ... I'll be content if they leave it at $0.06 for 2020 ... but a div increase is hardly on PSEC's agenda. Let's be happy with what we get ... :)"
"I've been holding PSEC for a little over a year and like my other BDC's I'm down around 25% - 30%. So far my strategy has been collect dividends in cash to afford holding stocks until control of the virus is established - pick up a lot or two on the big drops sell as they pop up to make coffee money. Seems a wavy bottom has been established and a treatment for the virus is expected (hoped for) around August/September. Only overhanging concern is reduced or eliminated dividends. One company has changed from monthly to quarterly. Another has posted dividends through September. Another cut .005 off its dividend. PSEC is offering shares at 5% discount. More businesses opening if only in limited capacities. Over all, I see a light at the end of this tunnel. Just hope it's not a train coming our way."
Book vale of $9.35 will rise se to $9.50 in one month Stock may rise to $10 by December
"more insider buying from CEO , great sign of higher valuation coming in next 6 months. any comments on this thought?"
"PSEC just called in senior notes paying 4.95% while at the same time issuing new preferred stock paying 5.5%. I am not an accountant and know very little about this subject. However, it certainly does not appear to make sense on the surface. This move appears to be kicking the can down the road at a higher interest rate. No wonder the stock keeps falling."
Dividend payment coming tomorrow unless you're in the DRIP through DTC program when shares will be distributed next week at a share price of around $7.685.
The very fact that Barry has been buying shares should have told us that he is confident and comfortable about the dividend. I am happy. Bot 1000 more at 4.02 after hours. Other orders waiting in the queue and won't mind loading up some more for $4.10 or less and collect 0.06 every month ..
DRIP through DTC price posted on Prospect's website. May price is $7.8565. Look for the share distribution over the next few days.
Been buying since Oct 2020. Up over 20% on my cumulative purchases. Won't complain or play dividend harvest.
to da moon and beyond
"Prospect Capital (PSEC) Tops Q1 EPS by 2c, Revenues BeatProspect Capital (NASDAQ: PSEC) reported Q1 EPS of $0.23, $0.02 better than the analyst estimate of $0.21. Revenue for the quarter came in at $180.42 million versus the consensus estimate of $166.09 million."
Prospect Capital Corp. (Nasdaq: PSEC) – Potential 528% Gain
For those who might have missed it.Ex-div 11/30 payable 12/24Ex-div 12/31 payable 1/21/21.Same 6 cents per share.
"Let’s not make fun of the new Reddit/Robinhood players. Let’s face it: their addition as PSEC stockholders on helps the longd. I’ve been in since ‘13 and made a lot of 1099 dough. My average cost is $7.50, so I had a substantial unrealized loss for a long time. I didn’t panic. Stayed the course , and now it has paid off. Welcome ALL new PSEC investors! Longs, try not to bash those that do not understand mechanics of BDCs. Good luck, and enjoy the weekend! H9"
I bought some yesterday @ $7.69. I'm building a divvy cash cow and this one looks solid.
The rush to buy PSEC to lock in the 9% yieldcan this stock hit $8?
New to this but where do dividends go to? Back to the brokerage account? I assume you cannot get it reinvested automatically.
June dividend coming tomorrow. Closing price today of $8.89 means those of us enrolled in the DRIP through DTC will receive shares priced at approx $8.445.
so from June 1 to Aug 2 the preferred offering rose from 100M to 300M issued. I wonder what we'll see next month 500M? 5.5% in perpetuity is a great rate versus commercial loan terms. Another nice strategic move by PSEC management.
"don't understand, insiders buying big time and share prices going down."
"Okay. I was rather expecting the ex-div drop tomorrow.In the words of the immortal M. Ugarte, “What right do I have to think?”Happy Ex-Div Day.Arrives 9/23."
"so they way I see it, psec proxy will give psec 3.1 billion more in cash. this cash can be used to fund any of the business which they see fit. over 80% of their planned assets are secured. so if those companies are in a cash crunch and need a bridge, PSaeC can bail them out and own more of the company and or possibly take it over and sell it for a profit when this event passes. there are going to be opportunities to put fresh money to work at great entry points as a result of this event. this is why psec wants liquidity. in addition the management fee charged by Barry and Grier is a set fee of basically 20%. so yes their revenue will increase, bit so will the workload required to run the business as it will grow. My thought is Barry will prudently navigate the landscape and bring financial gain. if you didnt think this when you invested, you should have never invested I. this stock. Now is the time for Barry to excel! the other BDCs that provided book value updates like main street capital, only saw about 20% decline in book value. they owned 9% oil and energy equipment and 3% retail in their portfolio. their book value fell by about 20% through end of march and no missedpayment. PSEC has. different book, I get it, but I doubt its alot different result. keep in mind many of the portfolio companies in PSECs portfolio will recieve government funding for payroll through June. PSEC will recieve approval for funding and Barry will lead the company through this event. $3.80 entry is a gift, my opinion."
Thoughts on this stock for long term hold in retirement
$8.66 BOOK VALUE for $5.00 and a 14.5% dividend. A good level to buy at for sure.
"usually announce div for 3 mts, only two this q, maybe increase in works."
We’re making 9% on dividends. We were up 2 cents while the indices dropped. We had a spread of 10 cents all day.Prospect Capital is a boring stock.Boring is good.
Does anyone have the current NAV? All I can find is as/at March
The upcoming special proxy vote is primarily about granting the company authority to issue additional shares below NAV (potentially 10s of millions of new shares) multiple times over the next 12 months. Yes this will result in further dilution (potentially very significant dilution) unless you buy more shares equal to the percent of dilution. The real fun fact is that Prospect Capital Management (PCM) (the external investment advisor to PSEC) will be receiving addition management investment fees based on the issuance of these new shares. And of course the principals at PCM are J. Barry and G. Eliasek. Grier Eliasek is the guy making those phone calls to share holders encouraging share holders to vote their proxies (so he and J.B. can receive additional fees). I love it....that’s a wonderful example of a management team fully aligned with the interests of share holders.
What I like about BDC's is that they distribute a large percentage their net income to you. It's like owning a private investment as opposed to a stock that has price moves based on expectations. Also the net effect of the drip plan is to increase investable assets wIth equity rather than debt and to do so without a big dilution from a secondary offering.
What's it gonna be boys... yes or no...
NAV $9.81 a lot of room to run
"PSEC is primarily invested in a wide variety of industries, including, but not limited to:Business servicesConsumer productsConsumer servicesFinancial servicesFoodHealthcareIndustrialsManufacturingMediaThe only question mark is in regards their real-estate investments. On the surface these investments look like they have been well thought out before funding with much of the investment money coming directly from the property management firms themselves.Considering the cash on hand which has been reported at over $1 billion, they should be in good shape to come through this in fine shape. If there are any new posters here, consider the fact that Dave has never said one thing positive about Prospect Capital...ever. Even well before this corona virus scare."
Well that wasn’t much fun.My $7.70 & $7.65 buys triggered.The good news is that our DRIP price on Thursday ought to be fun.
I dont mind if they pay down the higher debt- especially as we move into a higher rate environment.I also don't mind the stock hovering here below $8 and paying the same dividend- especially as I add shares every time I take a profit in a different day/ swing trade....
own a lot of psec - negative basis - love the drip - will never sell
Earnings out. NAV increases 5% to $9.38 per share. Dividends remain at $0.06 through August. What's not to like?
A great earnings releaseNII $0.21 +$0.06 Q/Q +$0.03 Y/Y NAV $8.96 +$0.56 Q/Q +$0.30 Y/YClearly asset management at it's best.......I will be looking forward to the CC tomorrow. Look for these guys to be strutting their stuff and flapping their wings! Shorts get humbled at least for now.
"Maybe Barry should buy another, let's say a million more shares to get it over 7 again. It seems like he's the only lift force in town. Not selling, guess I'm stubborn but as the Fed keeps raising rates through 2018 I want to see where this baby goes based on many of their outstanding customer variable loans. You would think it will be a boost to their bottom line and increase the pps. GLTA and Happy New Year Folks. Be Healthy and that my friends is being Wealthy. You would give it all away if terminally ill and in severe pain. My heart goes out to those folks and their families. All else is meaningless without one's health."
"not a dog for sure. I have 14k shares and Yes my value is down around $11k but have received about 45k in divy, so easy math tells me it is better than other investment I have made. just sitting tight for years until retirement. it's a solid investment for long term people."
"This is simply a D & R stock. You have a choice to take the dividend or reinvest it in discounted shares giving you a larger dividend the following month(s). If you’re good with slowly jacking up a monthly income stream, you are in the right place. If you’re more into guessing buy low sell high and thinking of making a fortune there are hundreds of other stocks to consider."
"the incoming preferred revenue, plus the dry powder and refinancing notes at lower rate is going to increase NII. When rates start rising NII will increase as well. I am looking forward to a dividend increase! hope to see that in a quarter or 2!"
Great results! This should end the slide and move the stock closer to NAV.
Does anyone have a legitimate explanation why this has been sinking for the past 3 months?
I got an Interesting phone call tonight:Caller: did you receive PSEC voting prospectus?Me: noCaller: that’s ok. I can record your vote. There is only one question. Board including independent board members recommend a vote in favor of sale of additional sharesMe: I am voting againstCaller: ok. You can vote when your material arrivesMe: how about you record my vote right nowCaller: ok. I can do that but...( sales pitch trying to convince me to change vote)Me: thanks. I am voting against
PSEC is currently trading at a discount (.91) of the NAV. Hope someday to see it trade at a premium to the NAV.
I have very close to 1/2 of my investment back in dividends. Bought in at $8.00 in 2009 and I'm very happy with my return in investment. Long PSEC and continue to purchase
you can also get a 5% discount on their drip via dtc gets you close to 10%
"Last quarter's dividend announcement, covering Mar, Apr, and May, came after the earnings report. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that .06 will be maintained for Jun, Jul, and Aug."
"Just received my proxy materials. CEO Barry now owns 106,543,039 shares of common stock, or 27.4% of the totals. COO Eliasek owns 1,529,525 himself."
it appears that in the last 2 months Prospect Capital has reduced its interest payments by just under a million dollars a month
"Got to love this stock. Market down and still made money today. own over 29K in shares and PSEC is going to be making my house payment when I stop DRIPing on retirement day the first of the year. Long term is the key, been hanging on to the shares for years. Compounding is the key to all those sellers. Stock price almost doesn't matter. up a penny a day or even is excellent."
"Got my DRIP in at Schwab. $7.6873ish. It came in fast this month, and it looks like the DRIP posting on the ex date in July still counted. Good start to the weekend."
"PSEC conference callWednesday, August 25, 2021 11:00 AM ET"
Today had a swing of five cents day high to low. $7.95 buy triggered.I’m happy.Boring is good.
"Some point soon we will jump to $5.80. we will stay there briefly and float to $6 ish until there is confirmation that assets have been put to work and both NII and NAV are growing (which will happen). then as covid subsides and economy recovers, we will go higher. As rates rise we will go even higher! As I said for months, buy this stock. reinvest the dividends and you'll be happy in 5 years!"
Key takeaways from the CC.... Excess NII =$0.21 since Oct17. (sustainability of distribution and regulatory special distribution pressure)Non-accruals stable to decreasing. Improvements to NAV broad-based across the board but significant improvements to Interdent investment.Interdent has been a long term laggard.
"How can insiders continue to purchase, month after month and be so wrong, I am amazed that someone is so wrong on this PSEC play so far think the shorts have had upper hand, but insiders continue to buy and buy! Any thoughts how this will eventually play out, I am fine getting a monthly check while I wait."
"Acquired 8900 shares @ $5.61 ($49,898.74) on 01/05/2021. Currently up +$5,370.26 (+10.76%) to $55,269.00. Need opinions on the best sell price before earning. My intuition tells me this rise is not sustainable. Thanks"
has anyone else not received the dividend for this month?
Up We Go! So glad I bought more at $5. Let's see Robinhood/Reddit get a hold of PSEC!
please explain how zacks got 17 and loss
It’s days like today when I really appreciate PSEC’s narrow trading range.
Its all fun and games till they cut the dividend... again ;-)
Some profit taking today. That and market fear. Still going to holding and Dripping
Does schwab offer the 5% discount?Just got off the phone and they said they don’t. How to fix?
"up .16 today , must be getting close to the dividend payout day."
Earnings on Tuesday 11-6. Dividend announcement should be on same day.
"For you long term investors, I was curious so I used excel to see how an investor would have come out if they bought PSEC at the IPO. If my research is correct, the IPO was in August 2004 at $15 per share. So 1,000 shares would have cost you $15,000. With dividend reinvestment you would have approximately 4,827 shares today with a value of $32,389. So in a little over 14 years you would have about a 115% return. Not all that great for 14 years. Looking at it another way, you would have collected $16,843 in dividends had you taken the dividend in cash . Not much difference in the net. As you can see from the numbers, not a horrible investment but certainly not a barn burner either. The numbers don’t lie."
"CEO buying back shares. 2 dividends posted after April. As long as they come through, this and a few other divie stocks are, IMO, the best place to be. Hopefully the virus will be under control by July. Fingers crossed."
Earnings do look pretty good...dividend looks safe and we are moving a bit closer to a raise in the dividend...NAV 9.28 we should see a nice bump in the morning
Major indices down a half percent or more. Prospect Capital even-ish.Boring is good.
"now were making higher highs and lower lows, should be on our way to lucky 7"
"I owned this stock before. it paid a high div, but never went anywhere. if u think about it, it's better to just buy the index. 20 percent gain for snp vs 10 percent div they pay?"
With book value up now to $9.81 and steady dividend even through the pandemic this seems like an under valued stock.
July dividend due on Thursday. I’ll post my DRIP price from Merrill when I have it.
Gotta say I like be idea of a five cent spread on the day.Boring is good.
Insiders buying (good sign):https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1287032/000117184317006998/xslF345X03/formfour.xmlhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1219862/000117184317007000/xslF345X03/formfour.xmlhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1287032/000117184317006999/xslF345X03/formfour.xml
"Wayne, Although I think management needs to address some issues raised by shareholders about fees two factors are improving - LIBOR is definitely moving up in a big way and the FED is reducing the money supply at the same time/raising rates as one can see banks improving across the board."
The recent news should move the stock price easily back over $7/share. The consistency of the dividend coupled with the company's new assets (purchase of first lien notes of Payliance) should give all long investors encouragement. I would not be surprised if the company declares a dividend INCREASE before the end of 2020.
"In late 2012 the NAV was at $10.88, the monthly div was $ .11 and the stock price was around $12. The stock was in favor then selling at a slight premium to NAV. Since then the NAV, dividend and stock price has continually dropped. Investors have lost confidence in PSEC management’s ability to create value for investors. In fact, confidence has dropped to the point where the stock price is now selling at a deep discount to NAV. I am not a stock basher, these are just the facts. I have been invested since 2012 and would love to see the stock price head back up to the NAV level, just not expecting it to happen until we get a management change."
"I finally sold my 2000 shares that I have had since 2008. I've waited for 8.70 for a long time. Dividends have been great for 13 years, but moving on. Good luck to all!!"
Lets see it!
why does psec stock price continue to lag even when we have the longest bull run in history and New market highs? I though stock price would have reached 12 by now
Im not 100% comprehending this proxy vote situation. why would I want the company to be able to sell shares at a price lower than its value? seems like a no brainer to vote against unless I'm not seeing another side of it
Anyone know if fidelity offers the 5% discount
"I would like to share one more thing. Throughout my life I have found that the people who brag the most about their successes are many times the ones who have had the least success in their lives. In addition, success and good fortune become self evident therefore they do not need to be broadcast by those who are filled with hot air and in need of a self generated ego boost."
"Zero news to cause this pullback, we should have dropped .06 for dividend today."
do the dividends pay out well and are they reliable in this company?
why isn't the company buying back its own stock at this low price it would drive the price per share up
I currently have 100 shares at $7.35 and it's nice to get $6 bucks a month (DIV) but I still fantasize about owning a 1000 shares. $60 a month would be very sweet. Shoulda got more when it was down.
CEO John Barry owns 10% of PSEC. He continues to buy. He would not be adding shares if the eps was declining excessively. The next 2 dividends are locked in .06 per month. 15% dividend rate.
Even considering the dividend with the chart price always falling has anyone stayed ahead? It looks like the dividend only helps the overall losses be less harsh. ???
Another month in the books. Those of us in the DRIP through DTC program should expect our dividends to buy stock at a price of approximately $7.505 when they're issued over the next few days.
"Not many stocks out there with a BUY rating from The Street, Ford Equity Research and Market Edge. This is one of them"
"PSEC shares this past year has been near $6.50 most of the time providing a dividend of 11-12%. Now we see share price at $4.40, 50% of NAV / book value. Paying a 16.4% dividend. ( 1.4% monthly! ) We just saw the CEO John Barry buy an additional $100 Million in shares to his personal holdings. He bought under $5/share. Seems like a no brainer at these levels. Even if they need to write off a few bad loans due to the Covid-19 situation and lower the dividend to .5 cents......... you would still be getting a 13.6% dividend. Up side on the stock seems to be $2.00 and temporary down side is maybe .40 cents. I'm in again!"
This one is on sale today. I wish I knew why the large drop today post earnings. It was not a bad report for a BDC. Is it the large amount of individual investors who have jumped in here looking for a dividend payday? ...... Getting close to my entry point but not there yet.
"if the book value is %9.81, why did Wells-Fargo downgrade this stock to %6.50?"
amazing posts...
if PSEC meets the $.21 share earnings and holds dividend for 3 more months what is to be expected on share price? Any intelligent insight to share anyone?
I only own 107 shares but I'm going holding for the long term and have my dividends reinstated also
will PSEC be eligible for the CARE Act? they are less than 500 employees so I'd guess they can get 250% of one months payroll and if hey keep people employed through June its forgiven. I'd imagine many if their portfolio companies will get the same. this will equate to a good amount of support for them and the portfolio.
"Okay guys, I’m confused. Yesterday Zach’s called it an earnings miss. Today they talk about YTY increases & holding down costs.So, what’s their point unless we say that earnings statements always will have good news & bad?"
Div is more than covered and NAV is finally moving up. No way this stock doesn't move up closer to NAV.
"Can anyone say what your DRIP price was this last month. I am with TDA, and they are swearing the $7.32/share I paid includes the discount. By my calculations, the highest I should have paid was $7.10 based on the daily range"
"Are the volume figures correct? Barely 200,000 with the average 1.8m?"
Is this a good company? Safe for large sums of money to collect a dividend as well as go up in value? Who's been here awhile...
How much do they pay in dividends a month? .72 or .6
Should see more upgrades coming PSEC is way undervalued with book value at 9.28
"Last year they declared the Oct. & Nov dividends a day before their earnings. If that holds the same, announcement could come TODAY. As long as they maintain .06 we'll be FINE!"
WHOA NELLIE!!!!!! NAV from $8.40 to $8.96??????? Forward dividend secure! Time for the Robinhood/Reddit gang to pile on the shorts!!!! UP WE GO!!!!
"NEW YORK, Aug. 03, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Prospect Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:PSEC) (“Prospect”) announced today a continuous preferred stock offering of up to 40,000,000 shares, with a $1,000,000,000 aggregate liquidation preference (the “Preferred Stock”) (the “Offering”). Each share of Preferred Stock will have an offering price of $25.00 per share, before the application of any commissions and discounts.How will this impact the common stock?.....I'm kinda looking at this and thinking Ponzi scheme......no?"
No press release yet at 5:13pm.my guess is a negative release because in the past they released before 4:30 if it was good but I can be wrong..
"################################################################################A dividend increase (7c/month) is a statutory must in near future to upheld the BDC status################################################################################Yes, the increase is not just very very likely, it is forced by BDC legislation: PSEC HAS TO distribute at least 90% of net income in order to upheld the legal status of a BDC. So the dividend increase is not just likely, it is a must, the question is when to start with the increase - if the next quarter has a similar net earnings quality as the just released 4Q then November is for sure the date....."
How content Dave said he sold before the plunge! Nice fairytale! 
"Paying off higher interest notes and taking out notes further out at lower interest, plus it beat last two qtr estimates. Looks like they have the cash/credit to maneuver for a quarter or two. Anybody see any negatives to counter this?"
"I keep receiving letters from management asking that I contact them. They asked if I would like to vote “with” management on the proxies in December which leads me to believe that one or more of the institutional holders is getting fed up this management.Given that Mgt’s salaries are not posted (on Yahoo) and the share price has been stuck in the toilet for some time, I’m inclined to believe that there is a move to make a few changes that mgt is NOT COMFORTABLE with. Despite my relatively small holding, I DID (during my call) EXPRESS MY DISCOUNT WITH MANAGEMENT. Yahoo claims that for every poster on these message boards, there are sixty lurkers. FWIW: I intend to vote AGAINST KEEPING THESE BOARD MEMBERS. This company has been stagnant and secretive for too long. Please let me know if anyone out there agrees......even if only by a thumbs up.Thanks."
"Had a little extra $ from shuffling portfolio around and added a small amount to my position, good luck all"
"I would like to ask a question to you of psec, who of you has this stock I would like to know if it is worth buying this company, I have a money in the bank that is not doing anything there and at least this company pays divident monthly"
Why so quiet here lately?
Made a new 12 months high todayEarnings are strong May be in 3 months they will raise distribution We may see $8 to $9 price in six months
Hi Dave! 
"Can someone tell me which stock is better than PSEC, because I cannot find any better than this.This stock is paying monthly, very high Dividend & Yield it's amazing!"
"What you see are sellers who panic and short selling taking advantage of the market. Look at the NAV, the profits, the earnings, the history, and the financial position of the company. The selling will soon stop and the stock will go back over $7 a share. I still plan to buy more shares in a few days when the panic is over. The dividend is not changing down as they take in more earnings than they pay out in dividends, while building up a reserve."
"I am ready to see what they bought with the 3.1 Billion they just freed up! next quarter Net interest income, NAV and the dividend will probably rise, and that's just the start! Good Luck Longs! and thank you to everyone that sold me shares under $4!!"
"initial investment in march 2009, reinvested dividends, and continued to add to position when dividend was above 10%. cost basis is $6.32 so pps 20%, but have 90% more shares. so up about 70% in 11yrs, or about 6% annual return. no great, but not bad."
"I'm happy to see the dividend declarations for the next 3 months at $0.06 per month. Yes, I was one of the people concerned a dividend cut may be on its' way after the revenue drop and $0.15 earnings the previous quarter. Let's have another good quarter and hope for a future increase in the divi."
Dividend payment tomorrow. I’ll post my Merrill DRIP price when I have it.

Question for longs here. I am retired and looking for yield. I have had this one on my watch list for some time. I hold OMF KNOP and HMLP. All of those have double digit yields. What makes this one so appetizing to tolerate BDC risk and accept less than 10% yield?
When’s the best time to buy thi share? Considering it was below 8 for a while
Buying down the 4.95% notes is a good use of money.
Tax plan helps companies PSEC holds debt in which reduces risk. PSEC should rise as result. IMHO
There is no bad news for PSEC at present. No worse than any company during this pandemic. They are still paying the same dividend only in shares of stock .....unless you request cash. They are changing the borrowing leverage allowed on their loans in order to protect the company during the Covid-19 pandemic. Nothing wrong with any of these moves. Perfectly understandable considering the financial pressures this year. Remember the CEO just bought $ 100 million plus of additional PSEC stock for himself. Current dividend 18.25% based on today's stock price.
"Bought more @ $7.90, $7.80, $7.70, & $7.60.The meant what I said a couple of months ago. I’m happy enough just collecting the dividend. Share price comes & goes. Don’t sweat it."
To think we were $9.25 in mid June. 12% loss in 2 months. Not pretty.

Will dividend increase this year? What y’all think
"Since 1988, when Prospect Capital Management launched our first public fund, we have weathered stock market crashes, credit market dislocations, liquidity crunches, SARS, MERS, H1N1, and now the Wuhan virus. Learning something from each challenge has made us better stewards of your savings.Starting two years ago, we began reducing debt at Prospect Capital Corporation (“Prospect”). We were the only large traded BDC not to quickly elect a lower minimum asset coverage, which would have enabled us to add leverage and grow assets, but only by taking on more risk.When the virus hit, we carried less leverage than almost any other large seasoned BDC. Because of our decision to de-risk, the virus caused our NAV per share to decline 7.9% versus a 13.7% median traded BDC NAV per share decline.Prospect continues to hold investment grade ratings from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, Kroll, and Egan Jones. Only one other BDC has four investment grade ratings.De-risking Prospect protected our NII and distribution. For the 3/31/20 quarter, we earned $68.5 million of NII and paid $66.2 million in distributions. Today, we are declaring distributions for the next four months at the same rate as the past 32 months.While I believe asset values and our NAV should reflate from the 3/23/20 low in the S&P 500, which as of May 8, 2020 is up 31% (and the VIX down 51%), we are staying true to the strategy that has served us well since 1988, managing portfolio risk to protect capital entrusted to us and generate shareholder earnings.As in 2009 when we purchased Patriot Capital, market dislocations are presenting investment opportunities. To provide more financial flexibility, we elected 150% minimum regulatory asset coverage and, as in the past, are seeking approval from shareholders for a one-year option to issue shares below NAV, which enabled us to acquire Patriot.As Prospect’s largest shareholder, I want to increase our NAV, NII, and share price. I believe we now have tools in place to achieve that goal. Should investors see a steadily increasing NAV and NII, we may see our stock price respond.Warm regards,John F. Barry IIIChairman and Chief Executive Officer"
"A snapshot is not a trend. You need to focus on the long term trend. You need to look at a long term pattern. Climate change can not be evaluated on a short term cold wave. It snows and people shout climate change is not real. This is a short time chance for the short investors to slam the long term investors who want good dividends, scare them out of the stock with loses, and make big time profits. This will present a good buy opportunity. I will be adding to my stock and the stock will recover."
"Decent Q for PSEC. You have positive dividend coverage of 17%. An earnings meet, an increase in NAV, and Q over Q improvement earnings improvement. Not much to dislike. Hopefully this will keep Dave the Doofus at bay for awhile. …. On 2nd thought that's unlikely."
"We’re up 10% over the pre-Covid price. We’re up 40% for the year. “dave” and “Joe the Bartender” are MIA. The beta has risen significantly, albeit in a positive direction.

Down big today. Tax loss selling?
Report out PSEC beats by .02 and beats income by 11.67 million
Business environment and interest income have improved or PSEC. We don’t have to worry about dividend payments anymore.
many BDCs run in the interests of the shareholders are up today..
"Strong company, congrats longs ^^"
PSEC fills a void in our capital markets which large money center banks tend to avoid. Insider purchases and institutional ownership are bullish indicators. Current income anda reasonable expectation for capital appreciation seem worth the risk at the present time.
If the premarket is any judge; the earnings shorts are going to be disappointed.Although it may just be the “dividend capture” guys at work.I’m inclined to sit on the sidelines the next few days.
It’s up. NII has a small increase & the .06 dividend is announced for the next two months.
"I am a buyer at these levels. Probably dip after the ex dividend date and maybe not, but seems very reasonable to rise to 5.15 to 5.30, 3 to 6%,what's wrong with that I ask?"
I really liked PSEC before this new dividend program is just really diluting everyone. Very glad I saw this in the mid 8s before it was too late. Now they’re in a trap of paying their dividend with a bonus percentage and fully paying out with new issued shares. It was fun getting that monster monthly dividend but it’s not worth when you’re gonna lose big long term.
Reinvested my Preferred dividends @ $8.18.
"Barry just bought another 972,140 shares between him, his foundation and IRA between May and June."

"Prospect Capital amends dividend reinvestment planApr. 17, 2020 4:53 PM ET|About: Prospect Capital Corporation (PSEC)|By: Liz Kiesche, SA News Editor Under the amended plan, Prospect Capital (NASDAQ:PSEC) will reinvest all dividends or distributions declared on common stock in the form of stock for shareholders who haven't elected to receive their dividends in cash.The company will provide newly issued shares at a 5% discount from the market value of the common stock on the valuation date for the dividend or distribution.The change takes effect on May 21, 2020 and applies to the dividend declared on Feb. 10, 2020 with a record date of April 30, 2020 and a payment date of May 21, 2020 and all subsequent dividends and distributions."
Another comment that may not age well.It’s 12:43. The markets are tanking. Prospect Capital is up one cent.I like low beta stocks.

My 2800 shares have been loaned out (with my permission) to short sellers. They pay me about 50 cents a day interest. I paid $9.02 ($6.83-11.16) since 2013. I am feeling a bit shaky here at $9 but almost even + years of dividends. I am still holding and would not be surprised if the dividend goes back to $.08 like it was a few years ago. Looking at historical short interest we are at less than 50% (11m) where we were this time last year (23m).

"BTW Form 4 filed with SEC shows CEO bought 63,000 or so more shares a few days ago. I have a very strong feeling there is no risk to current dividend and perhaps LIBOR rising and money supply dropping is being finally recognized meaning shorts are covering and new buyers might be arriving. IMHO"

Received my proxy statement on the additional shares yesterday. Voting yes.I see there are a number of businesses beaten down by the pandemic & raising additional funds through selling equity beats taking on debt.
Hi Dave... NAV up big! 
"Looks like a beat to me...For the September 2018 quarter, we earned net investment income (“NII”) of $85.2 million, or $0.23 per weighted average share, up $0.01 from the June 2018 quarter, exceeding our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.18 per share by $0.05 per share. The increase in NII per share resulted primarily from an increase in dividend income compared to the June 2018 quarter.In the September 2018 quarter, our net of cash debt to equity ratio was 75.1%, up 3.5% from September 2017.For the September 2018 quarter, our net income (“NI”) was $83.8 million, or $0.23 per weighted average share, a decrease of $0.08 from the June 2018 quarter.Our net asset value (“NAV”) per share increased by $0.04 to $9.39 during the September 2018 quarter.DISTRIBUTION DECLARATIONProspect is declaring distributions as follows:$0.06 per share for November 2018 to November 30, 2018 record holders with December 20, 2018 payment date;$0.06 per share for December 2018 to January 2, 2019 record holders with January 24, 2019 payment date; and$0.06 per share for January 2019 to January 31, 2019 record holders with February 21, 2019 payment date."
My $20K potential loss a little over a month ago is now a $2600 gain. Some of your comments back then made me hold on to my 12 year investment for a few more weeks. Thank you longs.
Rightly I have been admonished not to pay attention to the premarket.But as of 9:15 everything is red. The Indicies are tanking.And Prospect Capital is up 2 cents.
"I see a few people really slamming this stock like they expect it to take off like a growth stock. It isn't, it's a dividend stock at a 13.82% return. Even at half that it would be considered good. Over the past few years prior to Covid it averaged about $6- $7 roughly. I would anticipate it being able to maintain $6-$7 price as we stabilize from the pandemic. If your looking for a good dividend stock with growth potential get stocks like OKE and XOM. They are at about half their normal value and pay a good dividend. Crude oil prices aren't great but the stock keeps going up with every positive report on Covid. They will jump big when the vaccine starts circulating in the next few months. Could be a tough decision. Selling short for a good profit or keep a stock that has a history of giving dividends a priority. Even if a dividend is cut in half with a company like that. It's not a deal breaker for me."
Is anyone holding this just for the dividends?

However, over the life of the stock there has been a downward trend on its dividends and it also looks like this is a fairly high price. Any flavor you can add is appreciated."
