"Florida cuts ties with QUEST after not receiving 75,000 Covid tests dating back to April."
Quest made me feel old and unwanted in Lufkin Texas telling me to check in and closing the glass as I look down I see a screen that says check in with your phone number but there is no screen with numbers so I called my Doctor and ask him to send me to another lab.
I have not been following this stock. What's a good entry price?
"April 2, 2020The Honorable Alex AzarSecretaryU.S. Department of Health and Human Services200 Independence Ave SWWashington, DC 20201DELIVERED ELECTRONICALLYRE: $100 Billion CARES Act Fund for Eligible Health Care ProvidersDear Secretary Azar:The American Clinical Laboratory Association (ACLA) is the voice of clinical laboratories onthe front lines of the COVID-19 response, including Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, BioReferenceLaboratories, Sonic Healthcare USA, ARUP, Mayo Clinic Laboratories, and others that haverisen to the challenge of providing the COVID-19 tests that are so critical to combatting thepandemic in this country. Despite representing a very small share of health care spending,laboratory services are an essential tool for identifying and responding to infectious diseaseoutbreaks and protecting the public.ACLA and its members have coordinated closely with the White House, federal agencies such asHHS, the CDC and FDA, and state and local public health labs, hospitals and academic medicalcenters to rapidly expand testing capacity for COVID-19. To date, ACLA members alone havereported out almost one million COVID-19 tests since they began testing at the beginning ofMarch.ACLA urges the Administration to begin accepting applications from clinical laboratoriesimmediately so they may access funds that Congress appropriated to the Public Health andSocial Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) under Public Law 116-136, the Coronavirus Aid,Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, for “eligible health care providers”, includingclinical laboratories for “health care related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable tocoronavirus.” Laboratories need this funding to build the capacity our nation needs to ensureaccess to testing for every patient that needs one.Following the FDA’s February 29, 2020 guidance allowing commercial clinical laboratories tobegin offering laboratory developed tests (LDTs) for COVID-19, ACLA members and otherlaboratories acted immediately and, within a week, began accepting patient specimens to test forCOVID-19. ACLA members and others in the laboratory community are creating even moretesting capacity and developing new types of tests to help combat the pandemic and saveAmerican lives.ACLA fully supports the Administration’s commitment to ensure patients can access COVID-19tests and treatments without out-of-pocket costs. But, today, hundreds of thousands ofAmericans are still in need of a COVID-19 test, and commercial labs are using every availableresource to scale capacity as quickly as possible. The increasing costs of testing components,such as specimen collection swabs, reagents, and personal protective equipment, combined witha decrease in revenues for routine lab services, have made it increasingly difficult to achieve thecritical public health goal of developing and performing tens of thousands of COVID-19 testseach day. Financial support for laboratories is critical now so that every American that needs atest can get a test.ACLA urges the Administration to make funding available to clinical laboratories for thefollowing purposes, among others: Costs related to uncompensated COVID-19 testing services Support for laboratory personnel, including child and dependent care, training, temporarystaff, and overtime pay Capital and supplies acquisition, including testing platforms, reagents, components, andspecimen collection swabs; personal protective equipment; laboratory equipment;cybersecurity; and IT software and hardware Lost revenues due to lower test volume as a result of social distancing and a decrease inroutine physician visits and surgeries Support for research and development COVID-19 testingACLA and its member laboratories are committed to working with the White House, HHS,CDC, FDA, Congress, and public health partners across the country to ensure that Americansreceive the testing they need. Maintaining the full force of the commercial laboratory industry isessential to combat this pandemic. We greatly appreciate the Administration’s support ofclinical laboratories, particularly through distribution of these funds through the PHSSEF.Sincerely,Julie Khani, PresidentAmerican Clinical Laboratory Association"
"Here's what Wall Street doesn't see... yet...If you look at hospital labs and small labs, Covid was a death sentence for many of them. hospitals were on the losing end with less patients in beds for issues which are profitable, and Covid testing was concentrated, and still is, with the major commercial labs, DGX and LH. The effect Covid had on hospitals and smaller labs is devastating. Many hospitals are looking for external management and also to practically give away their outreach business. And who do you think is about to come in with all the capital it's amassed from Covid testing when it's the perfect time to pick up more hospital business which Quest has turned around and profitized? Now add Biden's push for reopening Obamacare and the economy on the mend, and the prospect for growth here is quite evident. Realize, many of the major hospitals in the area are cutting bonuses or even not giving their employees bonuses this year due to losses. They've been hit hard by Covid. But Quest is handing out the largest bonuses to its people ever. Add that to the recent 10.7% increase in DGX's dividend and you see how Quest has also rewarded share holders. The recent up and down action in the stock is expected. But once DGX gains its momentum back and the company continues to execute its strategy on an even larger scale, deploying it's capital and growing even more, it will be a good deal for those who recognized the value of this company at these levels, today."
"Some info for you DGX shareholders. DGX cut the 401(k) match to all their employees due to covid earlier this year, yet here we are looking at sky high earnings next quarter. DGX has already had legal issues with their employees regarding overtime pay - multiple times! Go read for yourself:https://www.bamlawca.com/california-labor-laws/quest-diagnostics-faces-allegations-of-failure-to-pay-overtimehttps://www.cynthiastamer.com/documents/alerts/20080429%20Quest%20FLSA%20Settlement%20v1_0.pdfGood luck with this stock long term..."
They said they are over whelming with testing.Quest is too busy. Big surprise in earnings
"With only about 133 million shares outstanding,it won't take much to get this really flying!"
"Get ready for a dividend increase. DGX preannounced last quarter. and it gave a positive upside preannouncement for this 3rd quarter. So I'd expect another dividend increase as they have over the past years. And at a time when most are cutting their dividend, expect DGX to show its strength to shareholders in a way that may reinforce its strong performance quite nicely, during a time when other companies are either cutting or not adding to their dividends. Id expect to hear something either at the end of Q4 or Q1 2021."
I think bigger powers manipulated this lower to gain shares ahead of work
COVID-19 test service opens for business MondayThere will be lines out the doors in all locations - mark my words...
"Bought my first shares today, let's go Quest. Will be buying more later on."
DGX added to GERM etf
"Breaking News!Quest Diagnostics Performed and Reported Results of More Than 400,000 COVID-19 Tests Since Introducing COVID-19 Testing on March 9, Reports Progress on Reduced BacklogsFrom March 9 to April 1, Quest Diagnostics has performed and reported results of more than 400,000 COVID-19 tests to providers and patients across the United States.Testing will only increase from here until a vaccine is released, which is 12-18 months away."
Codx the best in testing
Ohhh Eliazbeth Holm got the Stockhom Syndrohm! That what it is!
"Between now and early 2022, expect DGX to raise their dividend nicely. Last was an 11.5% increase."
"Someone with more Vision and Advanced thinking who would adjust and surpass new world requirements, will buy this firm, for their established infrastructure. Then Futurize !!!"
"Funny DGX is down. When stimulus is approved it will provide for exponential covid testing. A big part of that will go to DGX. Also, realize, the rapid tests are inaccurate. That is why you see so many infective at the White House. The result they get first as negative gives false security so they go on to spread the virus until they are symptomatic and then found positive."
Last dividend increase for DGX was 11.5%. Expect a similar if not higher bump up for 2022 which you will probably see at the end of Q3 2021 or Q1 2022. DGX is a growth and yield story for us owners. And the story will only be getting better. Stay tuned!
well... I sold this too soon. Good luck longs!
"So I'm hearing that examiners are not being reimbursed for mileage by DGX. Also hear they're requiring new examiners joining DGX to travel up to 30 miles (without being paid for mileage) to do exams. Finally, they pay a small extra amount and require examiners to go out of their way to drop off blood draws at their nearest satellite location. They haven't messed around with examiners in the past, have they? Oh, yeah, they have: https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/339101-quest-diagnostics-unpaid-overtime-class-action-lawsuit-deal-initially-approved/I would think shareholders should be concerned about this. They have done this more than once. They also stopped letting paramedical examiners be 1099 contractors, and instead require them to be W2 ""PRN"" employees."
"New Constructs has a new buy rating on Quest and CFRA has a 5 star rating with a $140 price target.Another low priced bargain is Nokia (NOK) rumors of a takeover and also has a new CEO coming soon.Opportunity to make a lot of money for a small price,will be a big player in the new 5G."

absolutely BLOWOUT earnings report and also raised full year guidance

I came across this stock recently. I use Quest for all my lab tests. I like their service.I was looking at the chart. This stock has been going sideways from the year 2006 until 2014. And after that till now not a great increase in stock price. what are investors in this stock holding this one when it doesn't show any great growth. 10K invested in 2008 would have grown to 24 K which is less than S&P growth. Just wanted to know from the folks what is the reason you invested in this .
"Nice beat, better than the last report."
Did you watch Pence and team live just a few minutes ago??? He mentioned by name DGX and LH. At least twice he said those names and also reiterated the Trump changed rules and CLIA labs are able to operate more efficiently now at the state level in every state.
"A great time to buy. This is an approved, physician tied, top lab on the east coast. You can get tested without going into a big facility. NYC is a hub of this disease."
"Retirement portfolio! Long! DGX, NVAX, OPK(multiple contracts)Stay safe folks!"
"I am long QUEST and like it but it's still overvalued. Rapid growth? Quarter to quarter growth of 1.96%, yoy growth of 2.95%. Meanwhile it carries a PEG over 3 and P/E over 20. You are basically overpaying for little earnings growth. Maybe the moves they've made will come to fruition over the next year or two but that remains to be seen."
"US Food and Drug AdministrationCoronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Authorizes First COVID-19 and Flu Combination Test for Use with Home-Collected SamplesToday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the first diagnostic test for at home collection of patient samples to detect both COVID-19 and influenza A and B (flu). The FDA authorized Quest Diagnostics RC COVID-19 +Flu RT-PCR Test for prescription use with the Quest Diagnostics Self-Collection Kit for COVID-19 +Flu by individuals who are suspected of respiratory viral infection consistent with COVID-19 when home collection is determined to be appropriate by an individual’s healthcare provider. Under a health care provider’s order, patients can collect a sample at home and ship it to a Quest Diagnostics laboratory for analysis following the instructions included with the self-collection kit.“Today’s authorization for a COVID-19 plus flu test using samples collected at home is a significant step toward FDA’s nationwide response to COVID-19. With the authorization of this test, the FDA is helping to address the ongoing fight against COVID-19 while in the middle of the flu season, which is important for many, including the most vulnerable of Americans. This is another example of the FDA working with test developers to bring important diagnostics to..."""
"So Amazon is being reported as a major threat to $DGX since they might enter the self-testing med space. Oh yea, okay, I'm sure AMZN will just spin up their own reg compliant labs to process millions of various tests....Reality is that IF Amazon actually enters this space, they will need $DGX as a partner."
This thing takes market volatility like a champ...
"1000 shares long and strong since$80 bucks, wish I had funds to buy more but I'm maxed out."
"Good performance, wow."
"As I expected in a previous post, Quest is steadily increasing their dividend each year which is a very nice way to add to gains with a holding. See excerpt below regarding DGX latest dividend hike: ""Quest Diagnostics (DGX) declared a quarterly dividend of 56 cents a share, up 3 cents, for a boost of nearly 6%. The medical testing company’s stock, which has a one-year return of nearly 30%, yields 1.9%""."
Added today ! All testing stocks added!
Technicals are flashing bullish signals. Hold on!
Still trading sideways. I think this is a good hedge this year but not seeing the earnings growth we should. Looking forward to the next report.
Sold my entire $DGX position to buy $OPK. Looks like that was the right move
"I will buy more but not at these levels, I think it will eventually drop when the momentum wears off and I will load up. Great future here."
It should be good for the company and the stock. https://www.questdiagnostics.com/home/Covid-19/
I bought this on the follow through at 160 and this tanked. No news. Anyone have a clue why?

Mizuho upped target to 144...
This is the number one lab in the world. Very well run company. Many sites all over the Northeast. They are taking appointments. But the lines will be around the block Monday. You will be sorry if you miss this one.
Momentum is up and up and up
The target is 140. I do not think it reaches that anytime soon
Abbott has a new rapid antigen test approved so the test related stocks went down. They will be back up. Flu season is upon us soon. Abbott will jump up then get shorted down ... I am holding all my test stocks and will add more to some positions today.
"Buy now or regret it very soon! Quest will still have all the business that they always had plus a lot of new business from this health crisis, add in a low share count compared to most company's and a already beat down share price and I can see big gains coming soon."
I work for Quest and Ill say this. Our incoming work has skyrocketed. They are opening a bunch of positions because it was so many samples that we couldnt keep up with it.
Quest beat expectations. Raised dividend 10%. Authorized 1 billion share buyback. Buy any dip here!
"what happened with $DGX ? Last night during the press conference, Pence mentioned again LabCorp and Quest a couple of times, as they're supporting the efforts. Pre-Market those 2 stocks went up 6.5% last night. Now, the market opens, and despite everybody else being up 3%, Quest is negative -0.4% ? why"
"Hi, just bought a few more shares and wonder... If and when there is an FDA approved vaccine, how will they be administered, or, how will the consumer be vaccinated? Is it possible that they will need to go to, say, Quest labs to get vaccinated? If not, how, where? If Quest was giving vaccines, would that not be a boost, although maybe I heard that the vaccine will be free of charge to customer? Just dreaming of a way that the stock rises someday"
If coronavirus continues to spread does anyone have any insight if Quest might get emergency approval for disease testing like they did for Zika or H1H1? Either way I think this is a great stock not likely to be affected negatively by the coronavirus
Quest will be making money hand over fist in the next several months. Now is your chance to buy. If there’s one thing people want it to live.
A new high
How many private jets does Quest Diagnostics have? Why are they flying at 9:00 at night?
"According to an article from Zacks published on Dec. 18, 2018, AMAZON is going to enter the Home Health Testing Market. Zachs thinks that AMAZON's entrance into the healthcare diagnostic market will hurt Quest. I do not think that AMAZON will hurt Quest's business model. AMAZON cannot duplicate what Quest does. If people are selling Quest because they are afraid of the ""AMAZON EFFECT"", I think they are making a mistake. If I had available cash, I would be buying more shares of Quest at these levels, low 80s."
DGX Dividend increase is coming. Id bet between now and Q1 2021.
"Seems everyone is getting on board Bidens 1.9 Trillion Covid relief bill. Testing is a part of the plan. DGX abs LH stand to get some massive business aside from the current flow. And let's take into account the need for variant research of the virus mutation as the slow distribution of the vaccine had caused, and you have a recipe for a real form of laboratory block chain in with shrinking competition for these 2 sector leaders."
this company will definitely be big beneficiary ...significant upside ahead of us ..
"I like how people are actually talking about Quest on here. its a great stock, great opportunity.."
"Another upgrade today by B of A and they moved their target price up to $120. DGX have their Covid-19 anti body test for sale online priced at $119. Also Centene is distributing DGX Covid-19 test to their clients 25,000 per week. Multiple upgrades and recent move on Covid-19 testing kits priced at $119 should move DGX shares price up big. It should go beyond $120 in a week."
Quest will remain the preferred national clinical reference laboratory and testing provider for EmblemHealth and ConnectiCare members for all products
"WHY IS THIS GOING DOWN????? Oh wait, I know why....because they've lost 60% of their sample volume and don't expect to be profitable in the next few months!"
"Seniors 65 and up are DGX biggest customer for Covid19. There will be millions of Americans that will need to get tested. Plenty of people to get tested. Also, Quest doesn't only test for viruses. Virus testing has just quadrupled their revenues."
"Rwcent Article on Media, about the recent re-opening of the Affordable Healthcare Act This is HUGE for the clinical laboratory business such as DGX.:Nearly 31 million people have received coverage in 2021 as a result of the law, a HHS report says, much higher than the usual 20 million estimate"
Quest CEO said business is stronger than ever with the ability to test 300k per week. They are working with new testing kits to have results within 30 min. Quest will benefit huge from the CoronaVirus.
Quest antibody test widely available in oregon. I posted a very positive post here a few hrs ago. They took it off. Maybe they thought it was an advertisement.
"Have you noticed the ""Fully Valued"" barometer on DGX was moved from the far right of the scale to the middle? Wonder why?"
"All athletes proff and college will be tested a ton. Large employers , military , etc etc Various labs and diagnostics will be used among many populations. Testing is here to stay like it or not for at least 2020 and my bet is 2021 as well even with a 2021 vaccine or treatments. LH, DGX , TMO, QDEL, CRL , etc etc Can’t go wrong IMHO..."
"I’m here and waiting for my 1500% stock price jump, like CODX."
Notice how the mood has shifted to dividend stocks. DGX pays a respectable 2.10% and has increased on a yearly basis with the latest being 10.7% .
Ready to break new highs!
Quest is a screaming buy. Buying more here.
"Quest is a classic example of a company whose management is out of focus and short sighted.First off they are to top heavy. They hire a multitude of VP's and buy companies left and right.secondly they under pay one of their most crucial jobs, the lab assistant. People that have worked there for 8 yrs. make less than someone hired at Amazon today. Therefore they have high turnover.Good workers are replaced by unskilled and poor workers. This leads to constant training. Which results in rushed training. Chance of errors therefore goes up.Third. The IT in the labs is poor and inefficient. instead of paying to modernize they limp along with an outdated error prone system. This results in confusing specimen management leading to higher turn around times, overtesting, lost samples, and the need for more people to Chase around looking for samples."
I just don't get how this stock keeps falling with all their mentions by the government task force.
"So are these upgrades assuming that the Covid-19 Antibody (serology) testing will be enough to make up for the 50-60% loss in daily sample volume that the company is seeing in Q2, especially considering almost all of their tests are ""fixed cost tests""?If so, why did they stop 401K contributions, furlough 5500 workers, and take executive pay cuts?Who the hell is giving these upgrades? DGX is in big trouble, they're looking at a loss of -$0.25 EPS for Q2 FY20 vs $1.70 EPS in Q2 FY19. And their sample volume expectations are that even after Covid-19 subsides, it'll take 1-2 years to get back to their nomal sample volume. I'm never Bearish, but this one is a bearish no-brainer IMO."
"DGX needs to give out green bracelets to those that get a ""negative"" test result for CV. There has to be some way that we can get people back to work without being a danger to others and more importantly be consumers again.I'm sure Elon wants his TSLA factory back up and running now."
"some one bot 140K plus shares @ 110.55, not a bad recovery after hours"
Quest will do just fine. Testing here to stay and grow
Stock is FLAT vs pre-covid. Hilarious. Most blatantly undervalued stock in the market and the safest double up play (options). This will probably be $150 min by end of year....most likely sooner rather than later.
DGX is close to breaking out big...
"Every American will be tested, probably more than once: 93% of these tests will go through 2 commercial labs, qwest and lab Corp. how many test results is that?"
What happened? Down 1%
"Inflation cost and increase pay demands will hurt DGX in 2021. People jumping for more $, nobody will work for under $20 an hour any longer when unemployment pays them to sit at home"
Quest Diagnostics raised price target from $139 to $146.
I am putting my fingers crossed now. The logic in these markets are not workingI was thinking by this time it will reach 140s.I am not sure millions are going through covid testing and all also speciality other testing as usual.Not sure why people will not buy this stock and hold it.I really getting frustrated
LOOK AT CODX. 100% ASSURANCE. GOING HIGHER AND RELEASE EARNINGS TOMORROW
I buy this stock every time it dips
"Dropped below 50 and 200 day averages. Also went under the psychology important price of 100. Going exdividend in about a week. Looking for support levels. Also, market is up big today, and Quest is one of the few down stocks. I still see Quest as an excellent long term investment."
Institutions have been dumping DGX since before the outbreak. Look at the charts. Cyclical. Goes from low 80s to 110 roughly over the last 3 years. These news came out at the peak of the cycle around 110. It dumped due to market crash and should feel relief now. We are seeing a nice bounce here at 74 to now 83. GLTA
DGX price target 145 EASY started automated lab in CLIFTON March 2021.also covid testing. very much bullish
"I'm watching for a pop on DGX next week. All I heard the past week-end on TV and newspapers is TESTING, TESTING, TESTING and the gov't will use every resource available to test every American. Very good news for DGX. I'm buying and holding."
Is Quest Diagnostics still planning to release a serology test for COVD19 antibodies soon? The CEO said in the CNBC interview they developing it now.
This will reach 200s sooner or later. Look at some of them W TSLA BYND NFLX ZOOMOnce they get Momo they keep rolling.We may hear some hedge funds buying soon.GL
earnings will make it fly
"Neither Quest or LabCorp offer fast testing results. We need results in 10 minutes or less on the spot, Simply not interested in putting money into either of these 2."
Guys we gonna boomToday news finally hit public about newApproval. Yes ??? pauls picks2020 put strong buy of all #$%$ pls see on YTube very interesting and pls read description for all tickers. Enjoy my fellow longs ?
A great read. One needs to understand the correlation between information like this and the way it affects and will affect the medical lab testing business now and in the future. Who knew Millenials were not as healthy as we assumed?https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/04/older-millennials-chronic-health-conditions.html?__source=androidappshare
"Give DGX some time. no rationality right now. They will be doing 20K tests per day for COVID-19 by this week. $50-100 per test. Lets say $100 test, x 20K x 30 days/month= $60 Million a month. They probably would ramp up 5x that amount in further months. Most likely at least 100 million people will be infected at some point in next year or suspect of infection. This will make a big impact in their typical bottom line. just sit back and relax, and come around next year you will be happy"
"I am probably not the best technical analyst but I like the recent Double Bottom formation along with positive MACD & SLow Stochastics. Once it clears 50 day moving average, should see continued upside. Hopefully, earnings tomorrow are enough to clear this hurdle. I love DGX's chart!"
Quest Diagnostics reached an all time high at 133.47
I heard Quest mentioned almost every time the task force displayed their charts this week-end. I'm hoping DGX drops again so I can buy. Testing Testing Testing is all I heard this week-end.
Quest Diagnostics Inc (NYSE:DGX) stock is dropping by 9.32 percent to $87.87 a share. The stock is breaking down from a bearish daily chart base and this indicates lower prices ahead. The next key support level that should be watched closely will be the $80.00 area. This is where the stock broke out of a monthly chart bullish base in 2017.
"DGX isnt simply a Covid testing stock as tunnel visioned commentary make it seem to be . Sure, it's nice we were noticed because of it, but they have been buying, merging, managing and providing diagnostic information services as many other players couldn't figure out how to make medical diagnostic testing profitable. So when you factor in the future for Quest, you realize there are many good things ahead for the company, so this it just the tip of the needle. Just recently Quest acquired the outreach business of Community Health Network and Ascension St. Vinci in which it will manage 30 hospital labs. This is not just a recent trend with Quest, do your own research and see how they have been growing and partnering and acquiring over the past 5 years. It's up and up from here. I will add to the note that the dividend is the icing on this cake."
FDA approval for pooling specimens is huge news. Fantastic for DGX and patients !
Oh ye of little faith ...
Covid cases spiking. Stay long.
This will run towards the close my feeling 120++
"The problem with Quest is similar to the problems in many US companies. The upper management is not connected to the actually work being done. They sit around playing monopoly( buying to many companies, buying back stock, over hiring VP's, spending money on unnecessary parties or conferences). Meanwhile the baseline bead and butter of the company gets worse. They have 12 or 13 large labs covering a large part of the population. each lab is connected to upper management by a regional director. Bottom line the labs are basically on their own. The technological quality and innovation varies greatly. An esoteric lab may do expression analysis for breast cancer or sequence covid while another lab may be using tests from 30 years ago.The lowest paid workers have a revolving door. They are paid poorly but have some of the most important jobs, dealing with the specimen that come in the door via pipetting, plating, storage etc.So it is typical. the upper management is buried in the never ending push for higher profit every quarter, the workers get Nothing and the patientsget lower quality of tests.There is WAY to much emphasis on wall street and not enough ignoring wall street and building quality via spending"
Quest has steadily increased dividend payout every year over the past 6 years since it began paying dividends from .30 a share in 2013 to .53 a share in 2019 . We are at the end of another year. Stay Tuned. ;)
Will fly past the target IMHO
Camacord Maintains Buy on DGX:Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro maintained a Buy rating on Quest Diagnostics Inc (DGX) and set a price target of $113.00
IMO the media does a great disservice in this country due to their lack of due diligence in reporting. They do not get the facts.I do not believe the variants so far are breakthrough. There are many getting covid after receiving the vaccine. This is simply a numbers game. China did a study showing the delta var. had 1000x amount of virus in nasal cavity vs the primary covid strain. Some elderly and immunocomprimisedhave a lower antibody count compared to healthier people. and even some healthy people may have a lower Ab count. Therefore it is not a matter of the vaccine working. They are just overwhelmed. You also see this with DNA repair.The cell can repair mutated DNA using repair enzymes. However if there is too much toxin or mutagen the repair system gets overwhelmed and the cell dies. The body can fight back up to a certain point.
"DGX ex-dividend date is this Monday,April 6 so if you buy the stock today in the after market, you'll get the .56 dividend"
This happened last year as well with the hurricanes. These hurricanes affected all labs revenue. But its temporary. I know all the quests in my area are booked every morning. You cant get in till the afternoons. I'm a buyer under $88. And they just raised the dividend to .53 from .50.
Quest has been a reliable dividend since it was declared years ago. Quest has also shared the wealth by raising their dividend yearly. If you bought way back you're beating the 2.5% pay day and probably seeing somewhere between a 6 or 7% dividend considering your purchase price. Expect further increases to come in that payout. It's only going to get better from here.
Some people don't get it that stocks don't always respond to headlines. Look at Boeing...
i received an at home test for prostate cancer last week. i own 5000 shares that i bought last week. this is a long term investment that was initiated due to the breadth of their products and the surge coming from mandated covid testing. The market is shortsighted in this at present.
this thing is a tank.. I have a good feeling about next earnings report.. Getting access to United's patient base is incredible.. I think quest is in for a good couple of years.
"look at it fold, 136 very soon."
Along with Antibody tests they are seeing other regular tests. I hear from doctors in GA the patients are back.Economy is recovering faster than anticipated Gl
Upgraded today by CFRA with a 5 star rating and a $140.00 price target.
Quest’s capacity to do Covid testing will be enormous.
"Own this and Lab Corp, you can’t go wrong!"
I'm buying. I expect to hear a partnership with another company with a blood test for Covid19 to see if you had it already. Govt contracts should add to the bump too.
Quest should be ordering 2 minus 70 degree fridges for every pcs. But because they have no foresight( as proven in Florida covid testing fiasco). they will miss another opportunity.the PSC would provide a good geographical location for people to go get the vaccine. and since these RNA vaccines are the future it is not wastedspending. Quest is terribly managed. They care too much about wall street and not enough about improving the business. But it still manages a small profit despite itself.
Quest Diagnostics reached an all time high at 131.13
Buying signal loud and clear in these ranges
Walmart testing drone delivery of Quest home testing kits. Huge am adding shares today !
The Dems don't want wide distribution of test kits that are reliable they want this to continue to the election so that they can rig the election because when it comes to going into the voting booth they don't want people actually coming out and going to the photo booth they want to control it electronically so they are trying to keep it going until the election and the election time start this charade that people can't go to the voting booths and they should do everything electronically and and now I don't manipulate the outcome of the election

New constructs upgraded DGX today to (attractive) we should really rock and roll when the Gov.starts paying for these test and there will be multiple test for anyone with a (positive)
"Launched more covid tests , distinguish from flu etc. can’t go wrong with testing stocks."
Throwing out the baby with the bathwater here. Great company and will see its growth in the coming months. QD is buying up all the outreach on the cheap from hospitals. Also on an buying spree in all other areas. Along with United HC in network in 2019. Expect recovery in share price along with buy backs and sweet dividend increases. QD is nicely positioned in biotech and healthcare.
Upgrades coming next week !
I don't understand why this is down ?
Wait until you see this and LH next week ...
This is a very good deal. Research on mutations of the virus and DGX wins the contract. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-wins-covid-19-184659428.html
Who thinks earnings will be great ?
they just got the FDA. I'm in Canada and heard about this on Sirius radio. sounds good to me!
How much money is to be made? How much does it cost per test? Realize that a lot of tests will show some other respiratory illness. During President Trumps speech on Friday the lady doctor took the mike and I think said in Italy (or was it generally everywhere) only 4% of the tests indicated the new Corona virus infection.with 96% being positive for other respiratory illnesses. If that pattern is here and other places around the globe that represents a tremendous amount of tests and a huge amount of money.

"I'm buying testing companies up. DGX is ready to explode, again! Media's topic and most use word on the internet is, Testing. GO DGX!"
Be careful. DGX has a history of running higher weeks before earnings announcement then the drop. Not saying this will happen but they have a history
"If you want to get accurate results to decide on negative or positive status for Covid, you need to ditch the point of care tests that give result in 15 minutes to 2 hours. These tests do more to spread Covid than to control it. I do not understand how it is not obvious from easily acquired information that immediate resulting testing is damaging to the recovery. The only reliable testing is what major labs like DGX provide. I'd rather have one false negative than multiple false negatives that will threaten our ability to finally put this virus on the shelf and manage it on a better level. But if I was making money off the invalid point of care testing I'd probably have a defense against the obvious. So until the FDA removes these tests we are probably missing a great deal of positives and we will be in the same position as Germany, Italy and UK with the third wave around the corner. Everyone is vilifying governors for not making good decisions. In retrospect the approval of point of care covid testing will be one of the most ill thought out decisions. If we ever get over the virus because of it."
"The drug testing article on the previous page was interesting in that you really never know who you hired until they are on the ground running. A drug test will not securely tell you who will be a good or bad employee for certain. It is however one way of drawing a line against possible poor performance or criminal behavior. A local restaurant chain who we are friendly with management of had described an employee who was hired.amd was a good friend to all, very professional and somewhat religious in her demeanor. She made it on their team and had passed their drug testing requirement and ended up cleaning them.out of over $150,000 over a period of 10 years. Needless to say, management was blindsided by this ""revelation"". My point is if you can screen and hire a bad apple even with a drug screening process in place, then why drug screen at all?.Because, statistically, using this tool will likely improve your quality of employees on the whole. And not requiring it will simply open the door to much more of a probability that you will get more employees like the embezzler I described and less quality employees who will be more apt to be a problem rather than a solution to your employment needs and then you will need to add the costs of higher turnover, hiring and other costs associated with finding an employee to back fill the position you hired for just a month ago. So when in doubt of which way to go, drug testing is one tool that will give some insight into who you are putting on the books. But by no means is it the definitive screening tool in your hiring toolbox. As for the liquor store and its owner in the article on the previous page about drug testing who feels they can take a step out of their business now that a candidate will be hired to cover the shift they were working? I'd pay close attention to the business you are about to have less visibility in. It's usually a certain opportunity for a costly problem you may be blind to for a very long time."
It’s sounds like Midwest will have next spikes again. I wish the virus would have burned out this summer but it’s not. I am going to hold all test/diagnostics /lab stocks and add more. DGX has more news for increased capacity...
"Zach's upgrades, downgrades, upgrades yet again."
"Really looking good as testing moves forward as states want to reopen. On a recent call, the head of Quest said that their widespread mail to your home testing kits are moving into high gear."

Quest is doing Furloughs starting on Monday employees will be told whether they will continue to be working or have to go on furlough for 2 weeks to 3 months until normal workflow resumes.
Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX) said Thursday it will buy back $900 million of its own shares in the first half of 2021
"U have owned this since the lab I worked for got bought out by Corning Clinical in the 1990s. Then they created and spun Off Quest Diagnostics and Covance from GLW. So I bought in at its creation and accumulated quite a bit. with a really low pps. I left there, but what I had accumulated bought me my jeep and loaded limited edition Town and Country in 2000, for cash. I still got enough left, that when it goes over 100 to 110 I sell some to diversify. I know this company, and it's goals ,acquisitions and hunger. It has been called the Amazon of Lab testing and determination of normal ranges and disease statistics for health care. It is a monster for acquisitions and health related statistics and information for so many companies in both diagnostic test development, but those in disease treatment and health maintenance. I regret selling so much, but on a dip, this and LH are the monsters in their field. If you do auto Dividends reinvestment, DGX is the best long term in its sector for an IRA, etc. My basis for many early shares was like 4$...."
"The company raised its dividend and announced a Billion Dollar buy back of shares. Quest knows Bidens reopening of Obamacare will be accretive to earnings. Also Covid isn't going away, it will need to continue tracking, tracing and genotyping for all mutations. Realize after such a pandemic, there will be the need for testing on many concerns but more manageable testing. Add to this the people who will not get the vaccine and you will continue to see a steady Covid testing pipeline in addition to routine lab tests."
"Great run indeed...a lot of things will happen on weekend n by Monday, Pre-Market easy 100 bucks. WH press conference today mentioned Quest Diag n Lab Corp only 2 cos. conducting tests in So. Korea perhaps China too but maybe they just mentioned SK just to be discreet. Can't wait till Monday pre-market....have a great weekend folks...oh btw only PGA Tour wasn't canceled among sports....goodah!"
"To say DGX is all about Covid is not a good interpretation of the company. Quest is buying outreach and gaining market share by taking management of hospital laboratories. And if you think covid is going away, think again. It will become more manageable in a testing and treatment sense, but in the ishott term we will see need for more testing due to new mutation variants of it, most concerning is that which is being seen in Africa. This mutation worries me a bit more than the mutation in UK. Add to this those who will not take the vaccine, abs this seems to be a surprising number, who stand to continue to need testing due to infection, and those who, although vaccinated, may get mild symptoms and require testing to rule out what infection they have and how it should be treated, is it flu or covid? Covid is another treat that will continue to be monitored along with its variant stains. Next, get ready for a hike in dividend for DGX. They will return more to their investors and reward them for believing in this behemoth of Healthcare that is taking market share with each opportunity that presents. And most importantly, in a winning way that is beneficial for all."

More testing results daily! 5 million a week!
I picked up a few more shares today. This report seemed very positive.
And this will keep climbing like all top labs with approved testing - pooling specimens to increase capacity will be huge moving forward in 2020.
People bought assuming Coronavirus equals better price appreciation....how did that work out for you?
Buy all you can under $122
"One of Quest's main competitors, Lab Corp, is getting slammed today for lowering their revenue numbers and forward guidance. Yesterday it was Quest lowering forward guidance, and today Lab Corp. basically did the same thing. Lab Corp. is Quest's biggest competitor."
Upgrade target to 144 by one. Mine is 175. All valid labs/testing stocks will fare well at the end of the day in this wild market and situation in the USA.
So many smaller players are filing bankruptcy. Quest is benefiting from the inability of the smaller players and hospital labs not making the it due to PAMA. This is evident in their earnings call. There is only more growth ahead for Quest as the small guys head for the exits. And at the point when there are few to.compete with Quest and LH will own the lab testing sector. The company is also working diligently on getting paid more efficiently and quicker for their services. Stay tuned.
"DGX just one-upped CODX - hahaThe new test service will be provided as a laboratory developed test, pending review by the FDA under emergency use authorization (EUA) which the company will submit per FDA guidance within 15 days of clinical testing. The test is a molecular based assay which detects viral RNA in respiratory specimens.Load up..."
"Nice move. Earnings was ok, not incredible though."
"Looks good, dividends mean a lot to me. I only have about $1000, of cash currently, it is worth a call to my advisor banker, she loves talking about money with me."
At home covid19 tests. I like it a lot ..
Guess the earnings weren't good enough. Were down over $2 pre-market
