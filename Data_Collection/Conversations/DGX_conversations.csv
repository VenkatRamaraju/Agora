"Another upgrade today by B of A and they moved their target price up to $120. DGX have their Covid-19 anti body test for sale online priced at $119. Also Centene is distributing DGX Covid-19 test to their clients 25,000 per week. Multiple upgrades and recent move on Covid-19 testing kits priced at $119 should move DGX shares price up big. It should go beyond $120 in a week."
I just don't get how this stock keeps falling with all their mentions by the government task force.
"April 2, 2020The Honorable Alex AzarSecretaryU.S. Department of Health and Human Services200 Independence Ave SWWashington, DC 20201DELIVERED ELECTRONICALLYRE: $100 Billion CARES Act Fund for Eligible Health Care ProvidersDear Secretary Azar:The American Clinical Laboratory Association (ACLA) is the voice of clinical laboratories onthe front lines of the COVID-19 response, including Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, BioReferenceLaboratories, Sonic Healthcare USA, ARUP, Mayo Clinic Laboratories, and others that haverisen to the challenge of providing the COVID-19 tests that are so critical to combatting thepandemic in this country. Despite representing a very small share of health care spending,laboratory services are an essential tool for identifying and responding to infectious diseaseoutbreaks and protecting the public.ACLA and its members have coordinated closely with the White House, federal agencies such asHHS, the CDC and FDA, and state and local public health labs, hospitals and academic medicalcenters to rapidly expand testing capacity for COVID-19. To date, ACLA members alone havereported out almost one million COVID-19 tests since they began testing at the beginning ofMarch.ACLA urges the Administration to begin accepting applications from clinical laboratoriesimmediately so they may access funds that Congress appropriated to the Public Health andSocial Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) under Public Law 116-136, the Coronavirus Aid,Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, for “eligible health care providers”, includingclinical laboratories for “health care related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable tocoronavirus.” Laboratories need this funding to build the capacity our nation needs to ensureaccess to testing for every patient that needs one.Following the FDA’s February 29, 2020 guidance allowing commercial clinical laboratories tobegin offering laboratory developed tests (LDTs) for COVID-19, ACLA members and otherlaboratories acted immediately and, within a week, began accepting patient specimens to test forCOVID-19. ACLA members and others in the laboratory community are creating even moretesting capacity and developing new types of tests to help combat the pandemic and saveAmerican lives.ACLA fully supports the Administration’s commitment to ensure patients can access COVID-19tests and treatments without out-of-pocket costs. But, today, hundreds of thousands ofAmericans are still in need of a COVID-19 test, and commercial labs are using every availableresource to scale capacity as quickly as possible. The increasing costs of testing components,such as specimen collection swabs, reagents, and personal protective equipment, combined witha decrease in revenues for routine lab services, have made it increasingly difficult to achieve thecritical public health goal of developing and performing tens of thousands of COVID-19 testseach day. Financial support for laboratories is critical now so that every American that needs atest can get a test.ACLA urges the Administration to make funding available to clinical laboratories for thefollowing purposes, among others: Costs related to uncompensated COVID-19 testing services Support for laboratory personnel, including child and dependent care, training, temporarystaff, and overtime pay Capital and supplies acquisition, including testing platforms, reagents, components, andspecimen collection swabs; personal protective equipment; laboratory equipment;cybersecurity; and IT software and hardware Lost revenues due to lower test volume as a result of social distancing and a decrease inroutine physician visits and surgeries Support for research and development COVID-19 testingACLA and its member laboratories are committed to working with the White House, HHS,CDC, FDA, Congress, and public health partners across the country to ensure that Americansreceive the testing they need. Maintaining the full force of the commercial laboratory industry isessential to combat this pandemic. We greatly appreciate the Administration’s support ofclinical laboratories, particularly through distribution of these funds through the PHSSEF.Sincerely,Julie Khani, PresidentAmerican Clinical Laboratory Association"
Last dividend increase for DGX was 11.5%. Expect a similar if not higher bump up for 2022 which you will probably see at the end of Q3 2021 or Q1 2022. DGX is a growth and yield story for us owners. And the story will only be getting better. Stay tuned!
"So I'm hearing that examiners are not being reimbursed for mileage by DGX. Also hear they're requiring new examiners joining DGX to travel up to 30 miles (without being paid for mileage) to do exams. Finally, they pay a small extra amount and require examiners to go out of their way to drop off blood draws at their nearest satellite location. They haven't messed around with examiners in the past, have they? Oh, yeah, they have: https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/339101-quest-diagnostics-unpaid-overtime-class-action-lawsuit-deal-initially-approved/I would think shareholders should be concerned about this. They have done this more than once. They also stopped letting paramedical examiners be 1099 contractors, and instead require them to be W2 ""PRN"" employees."
"look at it fold, 136 very soon."
i received an at home test for prostate cancer last week. i own 5000 shares that i bought last week. this is a long term investment that was initiated due to the breadth of their products and the surge coming from mandated covid testing. The market is shortsighted in this at present.
Added today ! All testing stocks added!
"Get ready for a dividend increase. DGX preannounced last quarter. and it gave a positive upside preannouncement for this 3rd quarter. So I'd expect another dividend increase as they have over the past years. And at a time when most are cutting their dividend, expect DGX to show its strength to shareholders in a way that may reinforce its strong performance quite nicely, during a time when other companies are either cutting or not adding to their dividends. Id expect to hear something either at the end of Q4 or Q1 2021."
I bought this on the follow through at 160 and this tanked. No news. Anyone have a clue why?
"what happened with $DGX ? Last night during the press conference, Pence mentioned again LabCorp and Quest a couple of times, as they're supporting the efforts. Pre-Market those 2 stocks went up 6.5% last night. Now, the market opens, and despite everybody else being up 3%, Quest is negative -0.4% ? why"
"DGX just one-upped CODX - hahaThe new test service will be provided as a laboratory developed test, pending review by the FDA under emergency use authorization (EUA) which the company will submit per FDA guidance within 15 days of clinical testing. The test is a molecular based assay which detects viral RNA in respiratory specimens.Load up..."
"Hi, just bought a few more shares and wonder... If and when there is an FDA approved vaccine, how will they be administered, or, how will the consumer be vaccinated? Is it possible that they will need to go to, say, Quest labs to get vaccinated? If not, how, where? If Quest was giving vaccines, would that not be a boost, although maybe I heard that the vaccine will be free of charge to customer? Just dreaming of a way that the stock rises someday"
Quest Diagnostics raised price target from $139 to $146.
"The problem with Quest is similar to the problems in many US companies. The upper management is not connected to the actually work being done. They sit around playing monopoly( buying to many companies, buying back stock, over hiring VP's, spending money on unnecessary parties or conferences). Meanwhile the baseline bead and butter of the company gets worse. They have 12 or 13 large labs covering a large part of the population. each lab is connected to upper management by a regional director. Bottom line the labs are basically on their own. The technological quality and innovation varies greatly. An esoteric lab may do expression analysis for breast cancer or sequence covid while another lab may be using tests from 30 years ago.The lowest paid workers have a revolving door. They are paid poorly but have some of the most important jobs, dealing with the specimen that come in the door via pipetting, plating, storage etc.So it is typical. the upper management is buried in the never ending push for higher profit every quarter, the workers get Nothing and the patientsget lower quality of tests.There is WAY to much emphasis on wall street and not enough ignoring wall street and building quality via spending"
"Breaking News!Quest Diagnostics Performed and Reported Results of More Than 400,000 COVID-19 Tests Since Introducing COVID-19 Testing on March 9, Reports Progress on Reduced BacklogsFrom March 9 to April 1, Quest Diagnostics has performed and reported results of more than 400,000 COVID-19 tests to providers and patients across the United States.Testing will only increase from here until a vaccine is released, which is 12-18 months away."
"Have you noticed the ""Fully Valued"" barometer on DGX was moved from the far right of the scale to the middle? Wonder why?"
"Really looking good as testing moves forward as states want to reopen. On a recent call, the head of Quest said that their widespread mail to your home testing kits are moving into high gear."
"Between now and early 2022, expect DGX to raise their dividend nicely. Last was an 11.5% increase."
"DGX isnt simply a Covid testing stock as tunnel visioned commentary make it seem to be . Sure, it's nice we were noticed because of it, but they have been buying, merging, managing and providing diagnostic information services as many other players couldn't figure out how to make medical diagnostic testing profitable. So when you factor in the future for Quest, you realize there are many good things ahead for the company, so this it just the tip of the needle. Just recently Quest acquired the outreach business of Community Health Network and Ascension St. Vinci in which it will manage 30 hospital labs. This is not just a recent trend with Quest, do your own research and see how they have been growing and partnering and acquiring over the past 5 years. It's up and up from here. I will add to the note that the dividend is the icing on this cake."
