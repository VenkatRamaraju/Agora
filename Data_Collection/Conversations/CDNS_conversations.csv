Blue Sky Baby
Do they report before or after market hours?
Why isn’t it popping today like most of the tech stocks? Any thoughts?
very expensive
I have feeling that $MSFT will buy $CDNS since Microsoft decided to enter the chip design business. Or $SNPS will buy $CDNS to create a giant software IC design tools company.
This should pop tomorrow with Cadence’s collaboration with Broadcom and Broadcom’s deals with Apple. I picked up the 2/21 $80 calls for .75 today. Small risk for a big gain!

$120 shouldn't be to difficult in the next couple days. Long term looks even better
Do you ever wonder why someone doesn't buy this company? Maybe LAM Research?
"Earnings were good, next quarter guidance was ok, however full year was good. Hopefully we’ll get some upgrades tomorrow"
"Also $AAPL, or $INTC might buy $CDNS. Since all these software companies now want to design their own ICs"
Just a relentless steady climber. We’re up about 12% in the last month. No thrills just a grinder.

Too many non-GAAP numbers in there accounting documentation. Not sure you can trust them but we know they pay no dividend but they can pay their CEO a million plus. Not very share holder friendly!!

"Mentioned qtr miss this morning? Stock dropped immediately, shaking out weak hands. I never think Zacks puts out news without their profits in mind. Wanting in cheaper can’t be ruled out, especially when they say its beaten guidance 4 of 4 qtrly reports!"
Not bad but PE a little high.
