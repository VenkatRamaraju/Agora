Big haircut coming up for this stock.
Looks as if cadence will increase revenues because of their ability to clean up software bugs found in several cpu manufacturers
I see that CDNS market cap is now larger than SNPS. Does this mean CDNS is no 1 in EDA now?
Why are there Form 4's on the SEC's web page for 4 different insiders who have sold shares in January?

Cadence is an absolute leader in this space. The demand for their design and simulation technology will continue. This is one of the rare stocks that I have utmost confidence in.

This should pop tomorrow with Cadence’s collaboration with Broadcom and Broadcom’s deals with Apple. I picked up the 2/21 $80 calls for .75 today. Small risk for a big gain!
Most undervalued stock in the space right now.

what's guidance?
If these results take over 9% off from the stock price then some companies will shut them down
Do you ever wonder why someone doesn't buy this company? Maybe LAM Research?
IBD on Sunday says CDNS near a buy point of 80.45. A solid report after the close on Monday and we could see a $90+ stock
I have feeling that $MSFT will buy $CDNS since Microsoft decided to enter the chip design business. Or $SNPS will buy $CDNS to create a giant software IC design tools company.
"SRPT Sarepta goes bonkers after it reports after the bell! BYND and ZM (the #1 and #2 most shorted stocks) blast off together soon, Beyond will start it one day earlier than ZM after a massive beat next Monday. Mcdonalds missed today so look for beyond meat deal to come sooner than most thought. BYND can only make so many burgers. They are already selling out with shortages! Get ready for a bynd squeeze to 350 started by a pump after earnings by underwriter Goldman."
