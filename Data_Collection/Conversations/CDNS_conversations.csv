"Fantastic ER, great numbers!"

Great ER. Upgrades should follow.
"Hmm earnings not good enough or what? Bought the dip, great stock"
I think we might see a true breakout here soon.
"I wish all stocks are behaving like this one. Not best by performance by numbers, but extremely safe and steady growth. I feel I own treasuries with this one. Rock solid!!"
Most undervalued stock in the space right now.

"Also $AAPL, or $INTC might buy $CDNS. Since all these software companies now want to design their own ICs"
Cadence Design Systems reached an all time high at 125.93
This should pop tomorrow with Cadence’s collaboration with Broadcom and Broadcom’s deals with Apple. I picked up the 2/21 $80 calls for .75 today. Small risk for a big gain!
I have feeling that $MSFT will buy $CDNS since Microsoft decided to enter the chip design business. Or $SNPS will buy $CDNS to create a giant software IC design tools company.

Cadence is an absolute leader in this space. The demand for their design and simulation technology will continue. This is one of the rare stocks that I have utmost confidence in.
