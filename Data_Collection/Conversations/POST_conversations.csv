"""Grape-Nuts shortage is over: Cereal brand to reimburse consumers who paid inflated prices during COVID shortage""How politically correct...will they also help to pay off student debt, promote more illegal immigration, defend gun control and BLM, and perpetuate mythological Covid?"
"! WILL POST + ALPP Alpine 4 Holdings UP 7,700 % / AABB UP 2,700 % So Far in 2021 = HUGE GAINS 2021."
why is it up if the earnings missed estimates
POST was forced into this separation. POST had $9.8 billion in debt and only $2 billion in current assets. The illiquid debt they owned from BRBR was not doing them any good.
"Not knocking First Majestic in this post, Hoping to open PM investors eyes to Eric Sprott. He's nothing more than another youtube, mining conference stock promoter who pumps micro and junior miners he's already done bought deals with. One bought deal that cones to mind is Garibaldi. Stock was trading at 35 cents, his bought deal was at 15 cents. The Toronto Stock Exchange shot it down. Sprott then admits in #Financial #Post interview that he went to ""online chat boards"" where smart people convinced him to invest. Stock then jumped continuously to $2.00 share, where Sprott this time got approval to buy in around 90 cents along with warrants. Meanwhile he was pumping B.C. ""Golden Triangle"" Garibaldi mine as another Voisey Bay at conferences and youtube....big nickel deposits he said, though no nickel had ever been discovered in the Golden Triangle. Long story short, after Youtube pumps and conferences stock shot to $5. Of course, no nickel find did happen even though Sprott on camera claimed big nickel find would happen. Stock trades today around 40 cents. Sprott of course took his profits and added to his $1.3 billion pile. Small retail investors who believed Sprott that bought in at $2, $3, $4 and $5 had a different experience. I use to drink the Sprott koolaid for ten years, before getting informed. Just a heads up for other junior miners he pumps.....buyer beware. He didn't make his billion dollars in the mountains, but on the Toronto and Vancouver stock exchanges. gl"

"Well, how about a post that is not SPAM? lolI have been doing really well with POST and have owned it several weeks. I am not selling but holding. good luck"
"I took a position in this company 5 months ago. I am still long and looking forward to the earnings coming out this week. I am not expecting much upside if any if they post good numbers. I have had earnings on other stocks that beat the street and they had a decline in the stock price. With the way the Government is operating, I don't really see much ahead for the overall market, except for a decline in the economy. I don't like to be negative, to much pumping going on making market unstable."
new 52 week high today.... looking good!
Post factory in Battle Creek Mi. has 6 positive Covid cases and a couple dozen employees in quarantine!
Good stock
Any ideas why the big drop today? - I cant see any news commentary
POST is up 4.91% to 80.53
"I invested in POST when the share price was $98.00. I was doing dd on another stock I was looking to buy, it was a company in similar business as POST. When I noticed the many products that were under POST, the age of the company, the price per share and location of company plants. These were all major pluses as far as I am concerned. With the COVID-19 starting to decline and the demand for POST products increase, now is the time for management to look at supply and pricing on their products, it would change their share price from the flat line to a steady increase in profit for the company and investors. Do your dd and on this one and see what you think."
