Smooth sailing to retirement
Great gains on this one yesterday. Been watching a new one for similar gains in the coming months https://high-potential-stocks.market/SwingTradeOption
"As I posted 2 days ago, I'm in at $39.45 and am long until it's over triple digits...does anyone know what happened today?J"
Picked up the July 17th $70 calls at a great price today. Will continue trend higher from here.
"I am invested in this company (FA recommendation). It has done very little since picking it up back at the start of June. I am up about $800 in 6-months. On the other hand, with the same amount invested, my other stocks are up $9,000 - ALOT more (thanks BLNK). Just not sure if this is a good one to hold on to for now. I think moving all of this to BFT short-term and then back here longer term may be a better deal."
something is wrong with tw
TW is my LT investment!! Profitablegrowingdividend payingeverlasting business.trends in electronification
This is my Safe Haven....super LT...while getting paid quarterly for it to go up and up (but short term not stable).
it's going down because lockup period is expiring on October 1st. so all the insiders would sell most of the shares hence short term decline.
"I still don't understand what this company does, what they sell and who are clients? Can somebody explain and also who are their competitors?"
"Insiders bought shares at IPO, good sign!"
Back to 65! Let’s go
A lot of shorting the last couple days. Any idea what the low will be before it starts heading back? $38?
"it's something wrong, looks like all insiders got money and run away"
"I didn't think this was going to be a dividend paying stock. That is fantastic! .08 cents, great!"
Up Up and Away!!
Why is this stock overlooked?
The 1yr target of $149 sounds too good to be true.
3 days above the 50 day moving average. Excellent
"This stock is the exchange for trading bonds and debt, it has nothing to do with stock markets. It is the safest place to be, all summer long, and even in a bear market(even more so)!!!"
"because insiders control the price, they only want to get the money and run away"
Tradeweb Markets is up 5.04% to 60.85
reversal was inevitable. back to 60+ near term and road to 200 Long term
What’s going to drive this to the moon is the small share float available and the the huge oversubscribed underwriting
my only stock that is down today--TW.
First buy recommendation out on TW today
"Electronic trading here to stay. Bought in at the IPO, trippled since purchase. It's a winner stock, told you all to buy last year."
"Bought 250 shares Monday. Already a win, no publicity; hidden gem."
I like the 80's but love the 90's!
"It is a trading platform. IPO research and advisory firm IPOboutique.com says the offering is ""many multiple times oversubscribed,""meaning the request for shares is above what's being offered. It has a buy rating on Tradeweb, at the IPO price.Company is already profitable and going IPO provides additional investments to add major partners."
"Tip toeing in , skinny float , low P/E and already having earnings is a good combo ... See you at 50 ..."
this has been quiet for a while now.... let's see what earnings bring us for the holiday season....
Buying and buying and buying. Don't bother me when I am buying!
"Trade web is a great stock... while I have a decent position, wish I had more of it."
Earnings will be great
Next target is $90
A $200 stock!
Anyone know why it pulled back again today?
Move to 50.00 Great buy of important trading platform. Buyout will ultimately happen by bigger player
