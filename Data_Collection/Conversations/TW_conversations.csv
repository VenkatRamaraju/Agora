"Tip toeing in , skinny float , low P/E and already having earnings is a good combo ... See you at 50 ..."
Tradeweb Markets is up 5.04% to 60.85
"Tradeweb: Revenue and EPS growth was stellar in Q1, with strong margin expansion impressing me the most. The volatile quarter resulted in volumes & revenue growth of ~26%, but expense growth of only 8%, resulting in most of the incremental volume dropping directly to the bottom line. I'm now focused on Tradeweb's investment execution; margin expansion is a good story for investors - which explains why the stock is outperforming the S&P over the last few weeks - but for TW to continue to grow, we need to see sustained growth in investments and R&D spending. Management continues to tout the opportunity in the swaps and government bond markets, but competition is ratcheting up (MarketAxess's LiquidityEdge and CME's BrokerTec purchase) and new technology will determine winners in the coming quarters. Despite these competitive challenges, I'm impressed with Tradeweb's quarter and wouldn't be surprised to see the stock hit new all-time highs in the near future.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4344694-exchange-earnings-are-in-winners-and-losers"

TW ipo not healthy is going to under $19.00 in one month
IPO so far moving positive. Positive numbers being reported = growth.
"Funny how quiet this one is, but slowly and steadily gaining in value. Seemingly immune to the market retraction which has severely hit most of the tech side."

"I am invested in this company (FA recommendation). It has done very little since picking it up back at the start of June. I am up about $800 in 6-months. On the other hand, with the same amount invested, my other stocks are up $9,000 - ALOT more (thanks BLNK). Just not sure if this is a good one to hold on to for now. I think moving all of this to BFT short-term and then back here longer term may be a better deal."

Tradeweb Markets is up 4.92% to 63.78
TW is down 11.43% to 38.44
time to load up
it's going down because lockup period is expiring on October 1st. so all the insiders would sell most of the shares hence short term decline.
the giant is slowly waking up. this is gonna make you a lot of money while you don't do anything but hold :)
"I still don't understand what this company does, what they sell and who are clients? Can somebody explain and also who are their competitors?"
looks like institutional buyers are driving up the price..
"This should be a huge portfolio pillar for anybody in the know-how , smart money @ it best"

"Electronic trading here to stay. Bought in at the IPO, trippled since purchase. It's a winner stock, told you all to buy last year."
A lot of shorting the last couple days. Any idea what the low will be before it starts heading back? $38?

"Very nice interview of TW’s CEO this afternoon on CNBC. I learned a lot. Apparently, with ever-growing bond & securities trading & volatility, and also more stay-at-home trading, this firm is in a sweetspot."
Big up days this week

Wait until we get analyst following TW!
"Dividend raise? Wouldn't be expected after an IPO and the first issuance of a dividend, but I wouldn't be surprised if they do up the dividend payout. We will see soon..."
Tradeweb Markets is down 5.19% to 56.65

"Insiders bought shares at IPO, good sign!"
TW reached an all time high at 53.28
Earnings will be great
"A secondary so soon after the lockup period expired and a lot of employees sold their shares for profit taking? What's up with that? That's why it pulled back recently near the IPO price. I'm glad it's going up today, but surprised since secondary offerings typically dilute the number of shares outstanding and the stock price drops initially."
reversal was inevitable. back to 60+ near term and road to 200 Long term
TW just like MKTX TW valuation is much cheaper and better balance sheet!
The 1yr target of $149 sounds too good to be true.

Our clients want to do more electronically, and the diversity of our business across products and geographies was built to serve this demand.”Tradeweb ADV in H1 2020 was $837.5bn, beating the prior six month record of $752.3bn set in H2 2019.https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200706005252/en/"
Crossed the all important 50 day moving average. Let’s see if it holds.
3 days above the 50 day moving average. Excellent
"It is a trading platform. IPO research and advisory firm IPOboutique.com says the offering is ""many multiple times oversubscribed,""meaning the request for shares is above what's being offered. It has a buy rating on Tradeweb, at the IPO price.Company is already profitable and going IPO provides additional investments to add major partners."
