"Tradeweb: Revenue and EPS growth was stellar in Q1, with strong margin expansion impressing me the most. The volatile quarter resulted in volumes & revenue growth of ~26%, but expense growth of only 8%, resulting in most of the incremental volume dropping directly to the bottom line. I'm now focused on Tradeweb's investment execution; margin expansion is a good story for investors - which explains why the stock is outperforming the S&P over the last few weeks - but for TW to continue to grow, we need to see sustained growth in investments and R&D spending. Management continues to tout the opportunity in the swaps and government bond markets, but competition is ratcheting up (MarketAxess's LiquidityEdge and CME's BrokerTec purchase) and new technology will determine winners in the coming quarters. Despite these competitive challenges, I'm impressed with Tradeweb's quarter and wouldn't be surprised to see the stock hit new all-time highs in the near future.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4344694-exchange-earnings-are-in-winners-and-losers"

Earnings will be great
"A secondary so soon after the lockup period expired and a lot of employees sold their shares for profit taking? What's up with that? That's why it pulled back recently near the IPO price. I'm glad it's going up today, but surprised since secondary offerings typically dilute the number of shares outstanding and the stock price drops initially."
"after earning, it will be $70"
going to shoot up to 40 right before close

the giant is slowly waking up. this is gonna make you a lot of money while you don't do anything but hold :)
"This is going to make lot of money for all of us , buy as many as you can!"
it's going down because lockup period is expiring on October 1st. so all the insiders would sell most of the shares hence short term decline.

"Dividend raise? Wouldn't be expected after an IPO and the first issuance of a dividend, but I wouldn't be surprised if they do up the dividend payout. We will see soon..."
something is wrong with tw
TW just like MKTX TW valuation is much cheaper and better balance sheet!
"I am invested in this company (FA recommendation). It has done very little since picking it up back at the start of June. I am up about $800 in 6-months. On the other hand, with the same amount invested, my other stocks are up $9,000 - ALOT more (thanks BLNK). Just not sure if this is a good one to hold on to for now. I think moving all of this to BFT short-term and then back here longer term may be a better deal."
"Well more and more people are starting to pile in on this one. Meanwhile I will just sit back, hold and watch."
Look at MKTX.... if you aren’t loading this....
What’s going to drive this to the moon is the small share float available and the the huge oversubscribed underwriting
next week market and TW rally to new highs
"Low volume, $.69 cent trading range. It wants us to wait and see. Fine. Weekend is here."
IPO so far moving positive. Positive numbers being reported = growth.
"July 6,2020, TW released this statement.Lee Olesky, Tradeweb CEO, said: “While historic interventions of central banks globally certainly calmed volatility across rates trading, activity remained high on Tradeweb platforms and June capped our best half of a year ever for volumes. Our clients want to do more electronically, and the diversity of our business across products and geographies was built to serve this demand.”Tradeweb ADV in H1 2020 was $837.5bn, beating the prior six month record of $752.3bn set in H2 2019.https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200706005252/en/"
It's not scam. You will see next week!!
Nice to be above the 50 day moving average. Let’s see how the week ends.
nice price action before earnings...hoping for a pop like ttd
insiders are selling time to go
"What are the chances they issue a ton more shares and dilute the #$%$ out of the share price? TW's PE is around 12 now. The float could double and P/E would still only be 24. Look at Yahoo financials - 2018 earnings was 159Million. Float is 46 million. So EPS last 12 months is $3.45. Question is what P/E multiple does TW deserve? At a 15 P/E multiple, that puts #$%$ $50/shr."
"it's something wrong, looks like all insiders got money and run away"
