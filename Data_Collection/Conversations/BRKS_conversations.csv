i say their will be major profit taking the 1st week of january----stock will definitely trade below 70.00
"Looks like a very, very nice quarter reported and guidance seems to imply the growth accelerates."
Yes Rafi was smart to buy the dip at 89. Keep it up $BRKS!!
"With news of the sell off of the microchip division for $3 billion, any thoughts on how this cash will flow to shareholders? Market cap of $6.9 billion pre sale and only life sciences division will remain. Debt is only $120 million pre sale. How do you guys look to play this going forward. I think conf call at 8:30 am will shed some light on distribution of sale proceeds. I have done well with this swing trading this past year. Donâ€™t know how to play this latest news. I hold in an IRA."
BRKS selling Cryogenic division. Apparently investors really like the transaction. Stock popping up AH.
How does it drop so drastically after beating everything ?
Brooks Automation reached an all time high at 112.86
"Anybody have thoughts on the runup? I'm a looong time holder, but this stock is oddly up in just the last 5 days. Even with the most agressive earnings estimate the PE is sky high..."
I added to BRKS on the drop at 89 today. Down for no reason and no news. BRKS is an awesome stock. Buy on any red days. Cheers.
Somebody exiting a position today that's it. No news. BRKS might actually finish green today lol.
"Sometime ago BRKS and ACLS ON MY Buy list I chose ACLS, not until recently has ACLS moved. BRKS a far better investment"
Brooks Automation is up 4.94% to 89.88
BRKS stated maybe a few years ago circa 2018 they had a partnership with GRAIL. Now that ILMN bought back Grail and will ramp production. Any insight on the massive growth we might see in the next few years? This seems very under the radar.
Analyst's average price target concensus = $97.50. Let's get this up to triple digits.
"Key metrics like Profit Margin, Operating Margin, and ROE are nice healthy numbers. Withthe correct refocusing of strategy coming and with Boston Dynamics being owned privately by Softbank and Hyundai, BRKS' opportunities should be very bright!"
Brooks Automation reached an all time high at 115.38
"All reports of the industry are bullish - the charts look awfull - I guess ""the market"" sees peak earnings - could be a a serious dip. I am long but do not know for how long ...."
"As of the market close yesterday I moved Brooks Automation to a solid buy. Almost every tech hardware, software and services company has been involved in a correction for weeks. It could be argued that to a degree some names were pressing upper valuation limits and in a few cases exceeding such limits. Brooks is now in the lower region of fair valued and I would suggest that it should be acquired at or below ~ $24.50 per share, which is essentially the level at which it begins to enter an oversold condition relative to existing global economic prospects and profitability."
Genewiz is drastically undervalued in this company. Most comps are getting 40-70 price to sales valuation for similar profiles. Is it because investors don't realize Genewiz is baked in here? if so this is a lay up for us savvy investors to price the sum of all parts here.
"Brooks Life Sciences Services, and Brooks Life Sciences Products would be a good partner fit with CRISPR Therapeutics or Moderna."
