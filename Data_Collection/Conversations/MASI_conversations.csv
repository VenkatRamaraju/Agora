I sold 1/3 of my position at $270. Waiting to see but ready to sell if the fall starts
Zero long term debt! This is the type of company to own anytime but especially now!
"“Proofpoint invests heavily in R&D to provide innovative and highly effective products to its customers. At the heart of this case was our strong belief that intellectual property rights must be respected,” said Gary Steele, CEO & Chairman, Proofpoint. “While we welcome fair competition and collaboration within the cybersecurity community, the misappropriation, copying, and theft of our intellectual property required us to vigorously enforce our rights. We appreciate the jury sending a strong message that the theft of source code and misappropriation of trade secrets is unacceptable.”"
"It still is at a very high PE of 55. The company makes pulse oximeters like 150 other companies around the world. It packages a new SpO2 monitor each year in different colors.The stock took off under the weight of S&P 500 which ETFs buy even the crappiest because it has to. At a reasonable PE of 25, which too is high for a Me TOO Device, the stock should be less than half at $215 or less. Now that would mean many would lose their panties!Need ALLAH to the rescue!"
So much for Stock Advisor recommending this as a buy. 
What happened MASI just tanked 13% in after hours.
No debt and 52 week high...what more would you want?
Masi & Appl court date in April.Appl might pay Masi hundreds to billion dollars.Masi has won couple lawsuits in the past as Philips.Masi could go up $350-450/share.
"MASI dropped $9.28 today. Never had such a drop since over 5 years.I could not find any bad news on MASI in the last two days. What caused the drop? Insiders running? I always believed that MASI was over-rated in a market that is no longer high tech. Over 200 players in the pulse oximeter market. The PE is way too high. Based on a forward PE of 18, the stock should be around $65; even that is way high when companies like Apple with billions in cash and profits are at a PE of 12.I say; here come the sky divers hitting the ground. Look at the brighter side; a broken hip from the fall will need a pulse oximeter."
Masi: Rumors Apple will pays hundred millions to billion Masimo due to violation of Masimo patents SPO2. Masi should be $450 to $550/share soon! Masimo won many lawsuits in the past as: Philips Apple will decide either pay Masimo or buyout!
"once flu season and covid19 come in winter, this stock may fly high, time to load some for long term"
Great company with a good buy on dips. How big is their addressable market? Can they become as big as ISRG in the future?
"Hi there. I randomly buy stocks and this one has been ok, what is the price target in the future? I bought at 150.16 but never know how long to keep them  Any help is appreciated"
MASI is flying too high!It could crash to reality anytime. 50 plus in PE is amazingly too high. Too many people have pulse oximeters. Expect countries to start restricting product to that manufactured locally. Large markets will disappear in a few years. EU has already started a discussion on local production. MASI better heed the talk.As for stock sales; management keeps selling their options and investors keep rewarding them with high prices. The management seems to have an unending amount of stock options.
MASI is down -4.91% to 83.23
It going today.
I suspect with hospitalizations up... the earnings should be way up like April/ May. Any thoughts?
