CONE to open new datacenter in Amsterdam. https://cyrusone.com/press-release/ddca/
Is the dilution fully priced in at this point?

I like this acquisition. They run on XONE SandMax printers already. So ExOne management obviously knows the company well. I also like the statement about scaling up for a aerospace manufacturer. These partnerships are very valuable and best fruit in many other opportunities. This company XONE isn’t even at 1% of its potential market.
It will soon reach 70

"Question, Are there any Data Center ETF's ? or anything close to one. Can't find any when I serach."
CONE is up 4.93% to 51.49
"When the market realizes this is not a REIT like others, they will know that they are a major host for servers throughout the world, now that they have purchased properties in Europe. With a nice Divi told hold with, ride this one to $60 no problem. They have a steady stream of money. See what happens"
OK- just listened to this conference call- now I know why the stock was SO STRONG today- everyone should spend a little time and listen to it. I was going to sell since it had performed lousy but now I’m going to stay.
"The management team has tremendous growth opportunities, and they want to continue receiving investment grade ratings from the remaining rating agencies. My experiences with MLPs shows that raising the dividend at the expense of a strong balance sheet will come back to bite investors. They need to work towards cash flow covering capex and distribution (dividend). At the present time, a meaningful world footprint is needed for scale. I think dilutions will continue for the near future."
Any ideas on why the plunge today?
I HAVE NEVER MET SOMEONE SO TRUSTWORTHY AND ALWAYS TRUE TO HIS WORDS UNTIL I MET THIS COMPANY THEY ARE GOD SENT
"Big day for REITs - price and volume. CONE is up over 5%, with FRI - a REIT ETF - having five times normal volume. My other pick, AMT, is very close to a new all-time high."
Does anyone know why the price to dropped notably? Did I miss any news?
Here is an article referring to the possible reason for today’s drophttps://www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/ransomware-attack-hits-major-us-data-center-provider/
"No REIT Is Pandemic Proof, But These 3 Are Close https://seekingalpha.com/article/4335941?source=ansh $CONE, $HASI, $OFC"
"Buy buy buy, it will reach 70 today"
Bought 100 shares!
Data Centers to grow. Man I knew it. Back up to highs.
BEAUTIFUL CUP AND HANDLE FORMATION (mid last Dec to now) breakout --> target would be around 68.Lucky I didn't sell the other day.
CONFIRM BREAKOUT OVER 63.64. Look for volume confirmation today.TARGET $67.07
"Switching to Swich, they have a huge potential."
I don’t think the sale price would be less than 30% premium. Anyone want to make a prediction?
"What was that, lol. What a move."

"Was going to enter a 1/2 position in this but decided not to, To many other areas for both Growth and good dividends. Maybe down the road but not now."
"You may be interestingPAYO, PSFE, FINV, GGPI, STAF and MVST and NIO.Lots of money!"
"If CONE is able to fund the equity portion of projects with cash flow as the CFO stated in last conference call, the stock is off to the races. Without stock dilution, appreciation of stock and dividend are a given all things being equal. The rise of interest rates is over for a while, and they didn’t reach the 4% level all income investor’s were expecting. Where are they going to get the income without losing equity value. CONE is a great place to park money for decades."
"If QTS jumped to almost $80, then CONE should be worth $100 due to its market cap."
What a POS stock this is - thanks CRAMER.
"Wojtaszek Gary J President and CEO just bought 4,000 shares yesterday at $49.86"
"I bought 5000 SWCH . Can't do with CONE, cuz of $$$."
80-85 on the way as the suitors discuss.
Up in sympathy with the QTS/Blackstone deal......
Oh boy- this GARBAGE COMPANY reports today- for ONE time please report a good surprise- I WANT OUT at 60.
