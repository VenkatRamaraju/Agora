Is there any hazard to CONE data centers in Texas? Do they have any bases further south of Dallas?

WHY OH WHY DID I KEEP ANY SHARES IN THIS LOSER( another downgrade)
what is going on with this pig in a poke?
Great quarter and another new all-time high! Do NOT sell a share!
"The management team has tremendous growth opportunities, and they want to continue receiving investment grade ratings from the remaining rating agencies. My experiences with MLPs shows that raising the dividend at the expense of a strong balance sheet will come back to bite investors. They need to work towards cash flow covering capex and distribution (dividend). At the present time, a meaningful world footprint is needed for scale. I think dilutions will continue for the near future."
Is Q4 earnings declared?
CyrusOne is down 4.94% to 76.20
The reason CONE is getting blasted is that they didn't raise the dividend. This was the fifth straight quarter at the same level. That was not expected and is not acceptable. An annual increase - at the minimum - is expected or investors are sniffing out problems. I blew out my position on the news.
"What was that, lol. What a move."
CyrusOne reached an all time high at 85.70
Is the dilution fully priced in at this point?
I like this acquisition. They run on XONE SandMax printers already. So ExOne management obviously knows the company well. I also like the statement about scaling up for a aerospace manufacturer. These partnerships are very valuable and best fruit in many other opportunities. This company XONE isn’t even at 1% of its potential market.
"Was going to enter a 1/2 position in this but decided not to, To many other areas for both Growth and good dividends. Maybe down the road but not now."
CONE is down 5.05% to 63.61
Once again - PIECE OF #$%$ STOCK - LOOOOOOSERRR management.
OK- just listened to this conference call- now I know why the stock was SO STRONG today- everyone should spend a little time and listen to it. I was going to sell since it had performed lousy but now I’m going to stay.

Here is an article referring to the possible reason for today’s drophttps://www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/ransomware-attack-hits-major-us-data-center-provider/
TERRIBLE LEADERSHIP- congrats- it will take over 2 years of dividends to make up for your great earnings- hope you all pay yourselves a great bonus.
OK - as I'm listening to the conference call - I am once again impressed by the CEO - excellent presentation. I will maintain my investment and probably add to it.

"DLR has moved nicely since they were on Cramer. For all the criticism of Cramer, he has had a pretty good track record of late, so if you were in Square or Kratos, or NVDIA, you are doing pretty damn good. So I listened to CONE on his show and I was impressed with the growth potential of this REIT in a space where a lot of REITs are hurting, especially those involved in malls. Im thinking many more people will work from home even in some big companies. That will increase the need for more cloud computing just in that sphere. There will be more need for space for these storage facilities and they are very specialized, not like a Storage unit. So the growth potential here seems to move with the expansion of tech. And if tech is moving, so shall CONE. DLR has proven that and so has CONE with its nice moves in the last year. How muchmore, I ask this board to give opinions. Let's hear it."

WHY THE HECK DID I BUY THIS piece of #$%$ stock???????
This is another Brad Thomas loser stock
CONE is down 7.83% to 44.38
Are we looking at a earnings miss? There is a lot of investment in new properties for data centers. Is the market so down on them increasing debt? My broker at Wells Fargo has CONE as a strong buy. The downward movement is puzzling.
Made first attempt at breaking through the 2nd pivot resistance- let’s see over the next day if it tries again.

"When the market realizes this is not a REIT like others, they will know that they are a major host for servers throughout the world, now that they have purchased properties in Europe. With a nice Divi told hold with, ride this one to $60 no problem. They have a steady stream of money. See what happens"
What a POS stock this is - thanks CRAMER.

BEAUTIFUL CUP AND HANDLE FORMATION (mid last Dec to now) breakout --> target would be around 68.Lucky I didn't sell the other day.
It will soon reach 70
Got to remember- don’t buy 3rd class company- buy the leader- this company and its execs are will always be losers compared to leaders like digital realty.
CONFIRM BREAKOUT OVER 63.64. Look for volume confirmation today.TARGET $67.07
Oh I got a down thumb on my message- must be the loser CEO- since we all know he certainly doesn’t perform in his job.
how bout that pop?!
NOW 3years of dividend loss- THANKS LOSER EXECS- treat yourselves to another bonus!
Strong stock just keeps going up!
Headed back to 69?
CyrusOne is up 4.91% to 74.31
Buy out target
"If CONE is able to fund the equity portion of projects with cash flow as the CFO stated in last conference call, the stock is off to the races. Without stock dilution, appreciation of stock and dividend are a given all things being equal. The rise of interest rates is over for a while, and they didn’t reach the 4% level all income investor’s were expecting. Where are they going to get the income without losing equity value. CONE is a great place to park money for decades."
BEAUTIFUL- another DOWNGRADE- GARBAGE COMPANY- wish I would never have bought.
why is CEO Gary Wojtaszek stepping down when everything is going so well

"Do they have the means to build out their big bets? Seems like debt grows as fast as their appetite for new new builds, new markets? Buyout coming?"
"is this just profit taking? What's goinmg on here? Big drops in price. With everything looking rosy, what's up?"
3% jump today>? Buyers coming on board.
"If QTS jumped to almost $80, then CONE should be worth $100 due to its market cap."
Seems someone took some profits off the table. Cant blame them. Way further to go though
Data Centers to grow. Man I knew it. Back up to highs.
