"Next August, right? Do I store my GI Joe camo get-up in naphthalene laced with hydroxychloraquine?"
Relax. Democrats will win Midterm election 2022.
White House will not hold a press briefing today.Wonder why not........no news today??
"Why are republicans so disassociated with their reality? They’ll spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours on guns and practicing at the range to defend themselves and their families. And then fail to provide vaccine critical health care to that same family during a nationwide crisis and worldwide pandemic. They’ll say they don’t want the government telling them what to do. But then they file their taxes on time to get their child tax credits, get their drivers licenses renewed, and pay their property tax assessments and wear their seatbelts and helmets. They even get their tetanus shots on command. These people can’t be reasoned with or suddenly taught science. Not now. Not radicalized and believing corn-face will be back in office at the Resolute Desk with his old cabinet this month. How to reason with that? You don’t. You block them from your lives. You remove them from your sphere. You kick them out of your being. You divorce them from your soul. You rid yourself of them. And yes you tell that to their faces so they hear it over and over: the reason you are being left behind again, and again and again and again, is because of your demand for a timeout. You got it."
"Looks like Voting machines can be hacked in less than 5 minutes using a cell phone as Mike Lindells team showed us :LIVE . Why would SQL SERVER EVER be on a voting machine ? SQL sever can update , delete , add , edit millions records in seconds"

The vaccine with a 39% success rate is the first to receive FDA approval......as it should be!!
"The only good thing about TWTR continuing to allow the Tali to use their platforms is that the entire world will see how bad things can actually be once there isn't a US or coalition presence. Their economy is going collapse swiftly without some true form of government. Things will get very ugly, and it will.all be available on Twitter 24/7."
"NBC previously reported around 15,000 Americans were in Afghanistan. How many got out so far?"
"Said it before (deleted), I'll say it again. The Taliban should have trained the Afghan Army because obviously our having equipped and trained them didn't give them the testicular fortitude to stand. They just dropped and ran. SAD.Now, I'm sure the Taliban have the technical know-how to get those aircraft up and running and will run vigorous maintenance routines with qualified mechanics.That new Air Force of theirs is going to be a force to reckon with.Now, back to your regular scheduled programming. I give you.......The John Show!!!!(insert golf claps)"
"Look........when those dead Marines are returned to Andrews AFB Dementia joe and Dr Jill will be there with their ""thoughts and prayers""That really should fix everything!!"
I think the blackberry hack is significantly more important and more detrimental to our lives. QNX is susceptible to buffer overflows hacks meaning automated systems in millions of vehicles and iot devices made by the company can be compromised. Not just your DVD player. There are a few people I’d like to fasten permanently in their seat belts until they starve.
#Maricopa has to give up everything subpeonaed in #AZ or they lose around $70 Million. Now we will find out the Truth about the machines.
"Funny how everyone is in an uproar over a couple of service members who died on duty. It’s their job. They volunteered to sign up. What Tuck and friends don’t talk about: at least 159 Fort Hood soldiers died out of combat between 2016 and last year, including seven homicides and 71 suicidesOne veteran per hour, 22 per day, commits suicide from ptsd."
"Whats happening to the World right now, with the illegitimate Demcom Usurper in chief in the WH, is what happened to America when the Demcom Governors, Mayors, D.A.'s, House Speaker etc gave the Green light to Riot and loot to the #BlmAntifaTerrorists"
"TWTR -10% in the past 30 days. Surprising, as I thought lots of money would be pouring in from the Middle East for their communications support."
"Pennsylvania already destroyed Dominion’s defamation cases—read the investigative report. The conclusions? Somebody installed unapproved SQL software on Dominion’s machines that made modification of results possible. I too am awaiting discovery in those cases, and I strongly suspect the lawsuits will either be settled quietly or will be dropped by Dominion, JMHO."

"Massive Vaccine Freedom protests erupt in London, Paris, Geneva, Berlin, and Rome… USA lame stream media little to zero coverage ."
"Antifa buses. That’s right. Roving Antifa buses. Loaded with people ready to protest on a dime. Cops are SO GASLIT, they believed a couple social media posts about Antifa buses. And then acted on those posts and put resources behind them and committed money and taxpayer funds to funding Antifa buses. ACAB. Because they wanted to find those Antifa buses and break some skulls and crack some jaws. Because you know, Antifa buses."
"The comrades are doing everything in their power to take down anything that reads, the russian backed qanon misinformation machine is hard at it this morning, also I really wish Yahoo finance could come up with a way of requiring any member of Yahoo to be identified by a badge showing what country the poster is from, this could be coordinated with the isp, this would represent legitimacy of any poster."
"Don’t forget, the fbi concluded there was no planned conspiracy to do anything to the capital building. How could that be a surprise? James Comey had to investigate a lot of stories for his investigation. He testified many, many of them were dead wrong. He referred that this happened along a lot of topics but a bunch of them were made up about Russia.….."
Relax. Not a single pair of work boots or work gloves have been looted in New Orleans!!!Big flat screen TV's seem to be in high demand however!!
"its OK Mcvickers--- your president has done a great job. he has secured a republican sweep in 2022 and 2024. In just 7 months, our USA is set back 50 years. We thank you for your service"
"Oh how we miss him, cheap gas, low food prices, awesome foreign polices, awesome trade policies, low taxes, a very secure border, making NATO countries pay their fair share, gazillions of jobs helping the blacks, Spanish and Asian people, operation warp speed saving millions of lives, got rid of NAFTA, companies coming back to the U.S, pulled away from WHO saving millions of dollars from an organization that was covering for China, brokering peace deals in the middle east, awesome trade policies and made America great again just for starters."
The biggest death toll for American servicemen since February 2020.
I challenge any news media outlets to have a LIVE DEBATE with MIT PHD biological engineering expert DR SHIVA vs FAUCI . Come one man lets get this show on the road then we will find the truth

"TWTR up a couple points today. Sorry, freedom-loving patriots, but mr. market is feeling bullish about communism."
Why does my post about a 1000 year storm happening sooner than 16 years keep going down?Sounds like russian backed qanon not happy about this.
I dont see any point in obeying rules since my comments get taken down even though theyre 100%Truthful and I didnt break any rules
"TWTR green again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Holding for $70!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! READ the ACRX news out today! Under the radar, game changer to all having SURGERY in the coming weeks, months, years..."
I do and say everything the media and government tells me. I question nothing. I give away all my power and decision making because thinking hurts my brain. I believe if I give away all my freedom the government will keep me safe. I trust the big pharmaceutical companies with my health and believe everything they sell me is for my health and not for profits. Who am I ?
TWTR +2%. Sleepy man -10% since taking office. A few more months and he will be below Ornge man. Unfortunately for the country it will get worse. Speak to your elected officials. It's time to invoke 25th on the oldest guy to ever hold office.

This comment section is a disaster
"Tomorrow we will FINALLY see what ""world peace"" looks like.Owebamma dinna think it could happen without gun confiscation.I guess we'll see now...........eh??"
"My niece and nephew, a teacher, a federal with three kids who must be earning just under $150, get $750 a month deposit courtesy of the family plan act or w/e it’s called. Didn’t even have to ask for it. It was all automatic. Something is deeply wrong with our country."
Its funny how EVERYTHING WuhanJoe does benefits the Chicoms
"Make no mistake, your local network news outlet chooses as one example, not to run a single story on our border. Longer to fix if people don’t know. If their flagship like abc chooses to be in contempt of the people doesn’t mean your local out has to be. They can grab AP stories or from wherever, and AIR it. They choose not to. That’s just one topic."
Twitter needs a CEO that isn’t hated by most of its audience—JMHO.
Way overpriced.
America's oldest president provided jumbled responses to questions and mixed up details about his son in an interview with ABC.The stumbles did not make the broadcasted version but were revealed when a full transcript of the interview was published overnight.
and in closing I would to say once again that #TRUMPWON!!
"BREAKING:: Al-Qaeda Leader(Dr. Amin Al Haq, the personal security chief of Osama Bin Laden)reemerges in Afghanistan surrounded by Taliban Security"
Funny how they never talk about the Rona test that don't work and count the FLU cases as CovidScamdemic .
"Yesterday, I facetiously asked trumpies here if Hurricane Ida was fake news, since the mainstream media was reporting it as fact. Today I learn a crazed trumpy type jumped out of his pickup to confront an MSNBC reporter in Gulfport MS as he was giving a live hurricane update. ""Report accurately!"" he shrieked insanely. Guess I got my answer."
"As promised, first “thumbs down” is always my own."
Our journalism has turned into propaganda. Our big tech silences stuff that’s actually TRUE. Good path to be on?
C'MON MAN! The white house needs to push that narrative that Dementia joe's withdrawal from Afghanistan is a success. What other option is there??
Go Twitter!!!
"The most gaslit amongst us, said:They take our homes and give them to illegalsThe illegals get everything for free I make $5 an hour too much to get all the free stuff (said it proudly!)The problem is everything is legal now (ref to rec mj)Then they steal our girls and abuse themBut remember. They believe, and furiously munched their food more, that the illegals come here and are given peoples homes. So when a guy like M spouts anti vax nonsense in one sentence, and in another shakes his fist at everyone he disagrees with blaring his “valor” as truthbone, you know you’re dealing with hydroxy OD, ptsd psychotic break, Alzheimer’s— or the denials Of the modern cognitively slowed trumpestian"
"Mike Lindell is in a lot of trouble as are all of those sued for billions by dominion. Btw this is what Emmet Sullivan was saying about Flynn as well. A sweeping pardon from theDon stopped justice. ""This lawsuit represents a historic and profound abuse of the judicial process,"" Parker wrote in her ruling Wednesday. ""It is one thing to take on the charge of vindicating rights associated with an allegedly fraudulent election. It is another to take on the charge of deceiving a federal court and the American people into believing that rights were infringed, without regard to whether any laws or rights were in fact violated. This is what happened here."""
$30! Here we bigly come!
C’mon Boys. Bring on them thar scathing “thumbs down”. That’ll Lurn Me Gooder!
We need to focus on the positive point about this Afghanistan disaster. It took the focus off of the disaster at the southern border! When was the last time you saw any news about those covid infected super spreaders being welcomed in without being vaccinated?
Very nice runup today for twtr!
"Lindell, Giuliani & Associates will quash the phoney fake hoax election!"
