"NBC previously reported around 15,000 Americans were in Afghanistan. How many got out so far?"
Taliban has so many pallets of cash right now(Thanks to the illegitimateFraud) that they dont know what to do with it all. Thats all thats keeping TWTR from dropping like a former U.S. ally in Afghanistan from a Blackhawk helicopter.
"Sure we had a chance to get those Afghanis out over the last 12 months but we didn’t. Consistency is important. Why caring now? We don’t even care about the homeless on Venice beach, and they are Americans with mental problems. Our solution for them is no less similar to bagram. Is it."
Our journalism has turned into propaganda. Our big tech silences stuff that’s actually TRUE. Good path to be on?
LOL
"Why are republicans so disassociated with their reality? They’ll spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours on guns and practicing at the range to defend themselves and their families. And then fail to provide vaccine critical health care to that same family during a nationwide crisis and worldwide pandemic. They’ll say they don’t want the government telling them what to do. But then they file their taxes on time to get their child tax credits, get their drivers licenses renewed, and pay their property tax assessments and wear their seatbelts and helmets. They even get their tetanus shots on command. These people can’t be reasoned with or suddenly taught science. Not now. Not radicalized and believing corn-face will be back in office at the Resolute Desk with his old cabinet this month. How to reason with that? You don’t. You block them from your lives. You remove them from your sphere. You kick them out of your being. You divorce them from your soul. You rid yourself of them. And yes you tell that to their faces so they hear it over and over: the reason you are being left behind again, and again and again and again, is because of your demand for a timeout. You got it."

Ashraf Ghani finally found with his family in the UAE. He reportedly landed by helicopter with bags of US dollars in tow. Joe probably paid him to leave so he could add one more thing to his bucket list.

Don't listen to what the creator of this testing method Kary Mullis had to say about it and you Definitely shouldn't listen to what Dr. Roger Hodikinson, the CEO of one of the covid test manufacturers had to say. Those two individuals would know nothing about this test or how to use it properly. Trust THE science !"

"You know, Farm Aid has raised close to $50M in charity for “farms”, and even with 45s false market social welfare for them they still need help. Why not Homeless Aid?

Remember when the current occupier of the white house gave the Taliban billions in U.S. miltary equipment ranging anywhere from small arms all the way up to top of the line aircraft. Seems like just yesterday. What was the reason to do that again ? Why would you pull your troops out before your civilians ? Why would your leave your equipment behind ? Why would you leave a stack of 85 billion lying around for terrorists to #$%$ up ? Who does any of this make sense to ?

Because they wanted to find those Antifa buses and break some skulls and crack some jaws. Because you know, Antifa buses."
I am still wondering when Donnie is going to be reinstated. Those census numbers don't look too good for Donnie. It seems as though his followers are dying off too quickly. It's best he starts promoting the vaccine like he and his family got 2 seconds after the FDA authorized emergency use. His followers should demand a helicopter ride to the best infectious hospital in their state with several floors dedicated to treating them if they acquire covid. It's what Donnie got.

""It is one thing to take on the charge of vindicating rights associated with an allegedly fraudulent election.

Anybody seeing a lot of Americans inside the airport to get out or is it just regular Afghan citizens? How about Americans outside the airport simply waiting to get processed in?
Go Twitter!!!
the only thing keeping Dementia Joey in office is the fact Harris is next in line.

"If they target inside the airport, the outside of the airport will become mush."
"It’s sweet how this M has sanguine conversations with herself. Oh, hi, Internet personality that thinks exactly like me on a thread here on the Twitter forum. Why let’s converse nilly-willy and talk of halcyon times as if we are old friends. A little squeeze of facts and that M juices."
"The comrades are doing everything in their power to take down anything that reads, the russian backed qanon misinformation machine is hard at it this morning, also I really wish Yahoo finance could come up with a way of requiring any member of Yahoo to be identified by a badge showing what country the poster is from, this could be coordinated with the isp, this would represent legitimacy of any poster."
Even after yesterday this company continues to support those bad actors abroad. This shows you the contempt for our people in uniform. Jackie should see a cell for giving comfort and aid.

Very nice runup today for twtr!
"Said it before (deleted), I'll say it again. The Taliban should have trained the Afghan Army because obviously our having equipped and trained them didn't give them the testicular fortitude to stand. They just dropped and ran. SAD.Now, I'm sure the Taliban have the technical know-how to get those aircraft up and running and will run vigorous maintenance routines with qualified mechanics.That new Air Force of theirs is going to be a force to reckon with.Now, back to your regular scheduled programming. I give you.......The John Show!!!!(insert golf claps)"

"Desantis continues his spree. Neither vaccine nor regeneron are ""free"". The vaccine wholesale cost is around $25 per dose, while the Monoclonal antibodies run over $1000 per dose. The government is subsidizing both to make them ""free"" to customers.I now await the arrival of our fierce fiscal conservatives who will insist on NOT wasting taxpayer money. Or increase debt. Or inflation."
"don't be shy. If you saw that press conference where he says he hasn't heard a negative word from our allies. I'm sure he hasn't listened to anything besides TV Land in years. ""To see their commander in chief call into question the courage of men I fought with, to claim that they ran. It's shameful,"" member of Parliament Tom Tugendhat said during the session of the House of Commons. Tugendhat is a conservative member of Parliament who chairs the Foreign Affairs Select Committee and served in Afghanistan.Former U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May also expressed concern over the unilateral decision made by the U.S. to remove NATO troops. ""What does it say about NATO if we are entirely dependent on a unilateral decision taken by the United States?"" she asked British lawmakers Wednesday."""
Dementia joe's supporters do have one thing to celebrate. Tara Reade hasn't made the headlines in two weeks now!!

Why does my post about a 1000 year storm happening sooner than 16 years keep going down?Sounds like russian backed qanon not happy about this.
"Whats happening to the World right now, with the illegitimate Demcom Usurper in chief in the WH, is what happened to America when the Demcom Governors, Mayors, D.A.'s, House Speaker etc gave the Green light to Riot and loot to the #BlmAntifaTerrorists"
I bet Junior is upset about Afghanistan. Not because of whats happening but because the poppy prices will be going up. Then again he has a lot of Yuan from cutting deals for 'pop so he can afford it.
We’re not having success with the evacuation. Guess 4% is better than nothing.
TWTR +2%. Sleepy man -10% since taking office. A few more months and he will be below Ornge man. Unfortunately for the country it will get worse. Speak to your elected officials. It's time to invoke 25th on the oldest guy to ever hold office.

click on summary and go down to Fair ValueIt says Overvalued -46% Est. Return
"Studies show (as do millions of autopsy reports) that the human brain reaches adulthood development at the age of 25. At that age, adult reasoning usually begins to reach peak functioning, cause-effect is fully developed, right-wrong is established, and good-evil traits are embedded by the environment and are part of the psyche. So when Maddy Cawthorne, who “just” turned 25 opens his squirrelhole, a bunch of young, immature nuts keep falling out. It’s no surprise. The kid is illiterate and acts like High School. His latest quip about 1984, right after Barr’s Justice was found rifling reports phones abs emails, is particularly hamstrung. The guy doesn’t have a leg to stand on."
We all know where this Taliban stock is going. It says so on the Yahoo Finance summary page for TWTR ( Overvalued -46% Est. Return )
