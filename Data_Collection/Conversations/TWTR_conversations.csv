"The biggest secret out there is billionaires and their millionaire managers kept all the money. They took the CARES and HEROES money and didn’t pay their rank and file, and now they are “demanding” those workers return. People are saying, You live in a nice house in a nice part of town. I want a middle class life too. And we have a situation where people can’t remain billionaire and millionaires if they want labor. Maybe they just have to step it down and not have their own space ships for a while."

"Just can’t get enough of Texas. The Kerrville Convention and Visitors Bureau's website promoted the event as an “action packed, family-friendly day” in which fans could watch the “fastest drag cars compete for over $8000 in total prizes.” A 6-year-old boy and an 8-year-old boy were killed in the crash Saturday afternoon at an event called “Airport Race Wars 2” at the Kerrville-Kerr County Airport, police said in a news release.

"""Never believe that anti-vaxxers are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-vaxxers have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert.

"Help me understand. Tuck goes on tv every night and preaches white replacement. The US gov pays whites to have kids in the form of tax credits and in some cases direct deposits. The US gov needs taxpayers, and the net gain from internal sources remains negative since the Reagan tyranny. The solution is and has been immigration. Immigrants who have children in the US become legitimate taxpayers. So what’s a solution if even paying whites to broodmare doesn’t yield the appropriate herdstock?"

"Imagine winning the presidency of the USA, and rather than doing everything for everybody - you sordid years attempting to undo everything your predecessor did because he cracked a funny joke about you after you attempted to derail his presidency with a false cult movement. That’s right, trunpy was an original birther. And tan suit made EVERYONE laugh at him at a press dinner. He spent 4 years hurting Americans because of that. Taking it out on you and me. Because the prior guy made a good funny joke about his hair weave. One thing I’ll always thank Obama for is giving the kids of alternate families, the same legal footing for their inheritance as other children. No longer will they be taxed at 35% just because the constitution couldn’t be bothered to deal with them. Taxation without representation was a founding core principle of this country."

Twitter sales are advertising based and saw U.S, total sales up 45% to $742 million and ad sales up 51%. The quarterly loss was due to a ONE-TIME litigation charge (so earnings should be fine next quarter).The market is just schizo right now…this is a WAY over- reaction to really good growth and overall results - revenue up 41% YoY!!Bullish."

"Two predictive comments. The judge in the rittenhouse drama will step down during or immediately after the proceeding. He is a circuit court judge. This is way out of his wheelhouse. Most of his proceedings are meth smurfs stealing too much decongestant. Second, he has purposefully paved the way for a mistrial. The reason is yet unknown. Binger is a high class prosecutor who has made a thoughtful argument. He points out that in thousands of cases before the judge he’s not allowed to call them victims, but the judge is allowing polarizing terms like looter, arsonist, and rioter, to pollute the proceeding. This will cause an immediate mistrial."

Twitter is one of those companies where the founder is a liability. I reckon there is a bright spark out there who can make this company a real cash cow. It's a very addictive platform and most public figures use it.
“Truth” website will reverse all those bigly lawsuit losses. Bigly. Believe me. It’s a donation portal just like for any other second-rate televangelist.
"I’m old enough to remember when a bunch of the GRUcrew here went apoplectic when the truth is told that an average stay in ICU for covid ranges around $235,000.

Even regeneron-chicken soup only costs $2,700 if you want to get the disease and then attempt to suggest that getting cancer is the best way to prevent cancer."
