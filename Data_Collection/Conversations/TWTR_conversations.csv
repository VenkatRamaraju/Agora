Each new justice appointed to fill a vacancy has a 10 year maximum term. Then done. We don’t need to expand the court but we do need term limits now. NOW. This sharia court needs to go.

Their most expensive managers who earn hundreds of millions also. But in my town, those people would pay reallocation dollars. It means that they would subsidize the costs of restaurants, who would turn their waste food over to the poor and homeless. They would finance hospitals, who care for the sick and needy who can’t afford it. The reality is, society benefits from non generational wealth, in generational land ownership, and pouring the excess of the economy back into those sectors which lag. This was common education in senior high schools and colleges up until the 60s."

"When Bronco Bama voted AGAINST that debt ceiling increase.........he was just a mere senatorThe fact that we are here today to debate raising America’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government can’t pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government’s reckless fiscal policies. Over the past 5 years, our federal debt has increased by $3.5 trillion to $8.6 trillion. That is ‘‘trillion’’ with a ‘‘T.’’ That is money that we have borrowed from the Social Security trust fund, borrowed from China and Japan, borrowed from American taxpayers. And over the next 5 years, between now and 2011, the President’s budget will increase the debt by almost another $3.5 trillion."

"I hate the stock market. In 2020 I sold Tesla at about 160 right before takeoff. I sold the airlines ($UAL $DAL $AAL) in January, after which they gained 50% or so. Later this spring I sold $TWTR right before it popped. Then I sold $Uber at 52 right before it went to over 60. Now I sold $GM below 50 at a 15% loss...and today this. What a mess."

"Hey Jim, talk it out with me top line convo. Do I have my checkbook out? I sure have since 45. I never got a dime of stimulus either. I’ve been paying for every check that he approved. Trillions to his buddies on top of an 8.9 trillion deficit in 4 years. But now you say stop? America, Jim, RUNS ON DUNKIN AND DEBT. The stock market is. Debt spin device. It’s spinning off monetized debt right now. The day DonJ started his wild spending spree I predicted dow 41000. We are right about there. Why? Because every dollar of debt is monetized by the fed into the stock market. So I question your motives NOW Jim. I really do. You’ve shown your religio-ethno instabilities in the past. I’m never fooled by your ilk. Now debate it."

"Jose Manriquez is a 7 year veteran of the Denver Police Department and a 12 year veteran of the Army National Guard but his most important job is taking care of his 4 children and being a loving husband, son, brother, and uncle. Manriquez was given the mandatory COVID vaccine required by the City of Denver. The mandatory mandate stated either get the vaccine or face termination from the job he loves so much!Manriquez received the mandatory vaccine on August 22, 2021, and immediately started having a bad reaction. Since receiving the vaccine he has not been able to return to work and his future is uncertain. After receiving his vaccine he developed severe tremors and has trouble sleeping due to the amount of pain in his legs. He has fallen a number of times and basically can’t walk."

"The following is just an example why Twitter, FB, and media can not be trusted by anyone.""The Associated Press on Monday reported that Noem hauled multiple state officials into a meeting with herself and daughter Kassidy Peters, then 26, when it seemed she was going to be denied the license. AP said it’s not clear what happened at the meeting, but several months later Peters was given the license""The AP admits ""it is not clear what happened"" yet they did state a conclusion based on how they wanted the story to be twisted to maybe shape an inappropriate opinion by whoever reads their stories. It shows how people working in media do not care about other human beings but want to manipulate the world to think only as they do. It is a page from the most sinister playbook of rulers and dictators. Germany had one a while ago and it seems like media wants to be a second coming of what he did to the world then."
"Hey James, similar to the low cost of Build Back Better, I once tried to explain the maths of the green new deal to a trunpsyite. Imagine trying to get them to understand the gdp of the USA over 100 years (let alone 1000 years) being protected and saved, for a minor investment. The numbers worked out to investing $40,000 now, to preserve 4,000,000,000,000,000 worth of future dollars. Pretty cheap"
