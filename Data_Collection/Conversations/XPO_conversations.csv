What a recovery just at the end!Might signal that big money knows that 120 is the bottom?
Good quarter
15% from top higher volume towards the end... bleeding may stop
GXO could have a monster first few days with S&P re balancing.
"Seems to always tank before earnings, but they have beaten every time but once, which came inline. Whole trans industry tanked past two weeks. Xpo outgrows them all, $2 billion new bus first half, 770 new trucks, more workers this year than last year."
I was stopped at a rail road crossing yesterday watching the interminable train crawl by slowly........and all those containers stacked by twos.........XPO........XPO........XPO.........XPO.......XPO
"What a great buying opportunity, some analysts give XPO a $185 price target!"
Buying opportunity
Took a position today at 73.68.....really cant time the market....so i will just hold long term...seems like a reasonable level to start
"Logistics is the new sexy. XPO is a long way from its old ATH of $115/sh, but still, I'm feeling really good about them. In @45/sh since Jan2017, trimmed some profits last October and brought my average down to $31/share. How can trading possibly be more fun than than this?"
"I didn't see this trading during that dip in the mid$80's but I was glad to get in under 90 at $87. Long term hold for me, I'll check back next year. Unless there is another big dip from here than I'll most likely acquire some more. Good luck!"
It says the record date is July 23 but I bought on July 30. I’m now seeing a huge drop. What happens in this case?
"Cowen found several misleading statements in spruce report, double counting debt, ignoring items in fed, showed decline in profit instead if gain, typical short seller ploy"
"It was just announced that effective Monday 30Aug21, xpo will be rejecting Amzn's LTLs into Albany. The link wouldn't stick, but the headline is "" FreightWaves XPO to stop hauling inbound LTL traffic in Albany, NY -- As of Monday, XPO Logistics Inc. will no longer accept inbound LTL shipments on one of its lanes in Albany, N.Y. and destined for Ama""""Arming the Rebels"". If you put enough rebels together, suddenly there's an army. And once you build an army, other armies will start to appear. Today's thought is that Xpo is just as interested in carving into the Amazon pie as Shopify. The financial media has not been kind to xpo either. They are both industry distuptors, and the stock has been volatile. Amazon spanked them by cancelling some contracts in 2019 and share price tumbled, they got knocked by House of Fraser's bankruptcy etc.So now, XPO is cancelling amzn's business at a time when everybody is seriously short of staff. What does it mean? What's the grand plan...What if the companies that wanted to take jabs at mighty Amazon ganged up together, and strategized synergistically? I think that maybe (and it's a big maybe), this is Xpo putting pressure back on Amazon, which they couldn't do without the nimble (and hungry) SFN backing them up."
Can anyone point me to any info on the breakup re: pricing for each..how XPO stock will be resolved?
"So investors are still wllling to loan money, the analysts are still on board, no proof of allegations (unless you think that all the warehouses and trucks are fake), buyback suggests the board mgmt believe that stock is underpriced."
"Two things for sure. HD not taking this company over. No one gets this company for less than 110 bucks a share, too much growth in the pipeline, worked too hard to put themselves in this position."
"CFO leaving no problem. Jacobs not going anywhere. They continue to grow organically at faster than any other co in industry, as said today on conf call...we are outgrowing the market in all areas. Only acquisition if immensely creates shareholder value. Doesn’t get any better than that."
Should fly tomorrow
"The upwards move will continue and we will move past previous highs. The short attic was a joke, but for me personally and many others, it provided an unbelievable buying opportunity. Now for disclosure, I took my initial position the day before the attack because I thought it was an absolute steal at $61. Then orchestrated fake facts report hit which gave the opportunity to buy up huge. Normally I start with a 30% initial position which I did, but the day of the attack, I took 75% more throughout the day.This company will be bought out next year by Amazon, HomeDepot, FedEx, UPS maybe Walmart. That will be over 100 sp or it mo get acquired fairly Quickly At $75 plus. Amazon wants to be much stronger at logistics and they are talking about it as I type on CNBC. They shocked folks with the Whole Foods Aquisition and they will do the same here. The technology at XPO is cutting edge. The are miles ahead for the last mile and the market will be growing huge as e commerce continues its explosive growth.The warehousing edge will also continue to grow. We are in a great space right now and blue skies ahead. Even with dropping guidance, this will lead to a beat. This is the best online shopping season ever and XPO is booking huge revenue. The buyback will help keep this going for the next two weeks and everyone jumping in now will be rewarded handsomely for Xmas. Keeping adding while you can because up is the only direction from here. There has been some heavy short covering, but watch for a massive spike as the foolish ones will have no choice but to cover. I would actually love to have them wake up to a buyout announcement and get destroyed in a big way. Analysts are fighting hard and totally discredited the novice fools at spruce. Look at the upswing while the market sells off. Wait till that reverses, boom!!!Buy now and GLTA!"
It looks like another down day for freight/logistic companies looking at 50 - 51 today.

I pray that XPO is handling the bulk of the reverse logistics for Peloton's treadmill recall. XPO already delivers Peloton products TO peoples homes - I can't think of another company equipped to now take the products OUT of peoples homes and then BACK to their homes once more. Am I dreaming or what?
"Based on yesterdays data... We had a market cap of 5,5 Billion, PE of 16,92 which is close to Industry average. Shareprice was 50,35 USDIf we buy back 1,5 billion, the market cap would be around 4 billion. If we should remain the Industry average PE , the Stock price should go to 69,24 USD...Any comments?"
Its 8/19+Did I hear something about an XPO strike for more pay?
Great company and 5 million share dilution is nothing; take advantage of this discount
"A buyout would be great, but very unlikely unless big premium. Virtually all co#$%$ with bear attack don?t sell, especially when nothing is actually wrong. Why sell when nothing is wrong, your stock was almost twice I in value 3 months ago, same price today as 18 months ago when making half the money, added $3 billion in new bus first 9 months, growing ebidta 12-15% this year, dominating the freight mkt, xpo connect ramping up huge, service the 97% amzn does not sell online with xpo direct, 700 new trucks last year, etc., ?"
"If you want own stock to capture the growth in e-commerce, but can't stomach the extremely high PE multiples for companies like Amazon or Shopify, then XPO is an excellent choice. Very reasonable multiples, they are largest last mile delivery company for heavy goods, and have an excellent CEO. This stock is currently cheap, and could easily be at $80 - $85 by fall."
"Before 7/31/19 comes, XPO headed to over 70+ with no news;only hint is transportation index leading the charge.watch if 75 to 80 can happen if eps also better than expected."
"There's always a period of adjustment after an event like this. Portfolio rebalancing etc. The two equities have to find their own price. It can sometimes take a while. For example, aapl didn't recover their pre-split price for about 9 month. Some people will move into xpo, others into gxo, others simply want to grab their winnings. Maybe institutions will take some profits now.Their could be some volatility with with both companies, since they are both unknowns now. Two companies means twice the risk, so there's trimming going on.You have to shrug it off, shift focus. do something else or you can drive yourself mad. Check in every week, or month. If you look at xpo's 5 year chart, you will see why I've spent a lot of the past five years ignoring the price movement. It's exciting, but you also have to be able to sleep and night. Investing should NOT cause distress. It's important to handle the emotional side of things. I love my businesses, and give them the time they need to get things done.Fortunately for us all, Shopify's foray into Europe should send profits trickling in fairly quickly. This is LTP, long term play, and these are brand new days! Love your companies. Give them time to shine. Look at xpo's 5yr chart! I trimmed some profits when it began crasing Sept2018, and it didn't hit $85 again until Jan2021. Aapl traded sideways for 9 months after the split. Great time be building a position, or simply leaving your investment to mature.Yes, a little bit down down today. Volumes were also down 30% over yesterday. The dust needs to settle. The administrative end is still being looked after. Red green red green.. Investors are far less excited by normal daily price movement, than the traders and scouts since we think in terms of quarters, years and decades.. Eventually we move so far away from our entry price that we don't even think about it. Its a function of Time, and not becoming impatient, just like Warren Buffet says.@Abdul. I'm not against trading (although I don't), but I always suggest that people should avoid shorting and trading Shopify. It's been tragic seeing so much money thrown away. Shopify, xpo and gxo are nimble and creative in a way that few companies are, and now that they are partnered AND are both disruptors, Shopify will teach them some of their...tricks...to discourage traders and short selling. Nobody build a brand quite like Shopify, and they're very generous. XPO, pre-split, needed to grow revenues 50% to catch up with their nearest competition, I can't escape the sense that they and Shopify and gxo of course fit heavily into each other's plans. At the 6RS website, ""In no particular order"" they have listed the top 20 logistics company they are doing business with, and xpo is one of them. I'm trying not to read too much into it, but XPO is number one on the list, and Europe is where they plan to make serious coin with SHOP. I just know that I'm right.$SHOP now has more than 3 million merchants. That's 715,000 more than they had on 10June.21. More than half are US merchants, which bodes well for $XPO, and the balance are from everywhere else, like Europe..It's gonna be great!"
"Freight has been strong...earnings expected to be up 18% overall, rev up 8% overall, retail strong...all beneficial"
"Has anyone else having an issue with XPO cost basis after the Monday 8/2 spin off distribution? My XPO cost basis has not been updated. This has wiped out my profits!! Ex. 4/9/2020, I bought XPO at $66. Last Friday 7/30/21 it closed at about $140, thus having profit of 112%. On Monday, after the distribution, XPO was $84 but my cost basis remained the same causing my profit to drop to 27%. I have other lots of XPO at higher cost basis now showing negative loss instead of positive gains because the cost basis hasn't been adjusted to the new distribution. I have read the shareholder pdf and there was no mention of adjusting cost basis. Usually after the first day of trading the new cost basis is determined."
3rd quarter is always the best quarter of the year for ltl companies. Xpo positioned to perform well by lowering ltl o/r and ecommerce covid will give the logistics side an extra boost throughout the rest of the year. This stock will jump $3 when the stimulus passes Friday. Those $1200 checks might as well be cut to xpo logistics and amazon.
"Louis Navellier has this stock as a ""Strong Buy"" in his monthly news letter."
Heard a small rumor Boeing might be offering a buy out near term. Just purchased 500 shares.
This is so undervalued ..Company knows it very well and that’s why they are buying their own stocks. Who knows better than company itself???Moreover it could be an easy acquisition target at this price ...
Why is XPO a good investment in relation to its peers?
Price movement during regular trading today and after hours tells me that investors expecting good earning tomorrow.
"Bought back 18 million at avg price of 56, next 18 million at 52,90 avg price,,,think it was done to prevent “buy under” so if bear hug it would have to be soft hug or reasonable premium"
I don't think of any competition of XPO... such a unique business...let the bidding war begin between HD and AMZN..I am not expert but i don't see anything less than 140 in picture.
What is up with the PE ratio?? Eps is only at 1.66 while the consensus is 6.08. PE should be around 24... not 87
"Set aside for a second whether or not you believe all the allegations in the short seller’s (Spruce Point Capital) report .... there is a MATH error in how they have calculated their Enterprise Value (EV) — basically they have added in the Secured Debt Outstanding of $2.1B TWICE, thereby overstating the EV"

"Wow! Unbelievable revenue and earnings report out, but stock doesn’t react at all. Why? Mentioned particularly the strength in last miles delivery during holiday season. This is the very reason both HD and AMZN are interested in taking over XPO."
"I posted this 2 months ago. Re posting now that I see this idea is gaining interest. ""So Motley Fool put out an article on the new industries Amazon is looking to disrupt. One of those is shipping / logistics. Further, it is understood that Amazon is the large customer that XPO lost in Europe, forcing them to miss consensus and lower guidance. Would it be conceivable that Amazon would bid for XPO given the lower market cap now and their sights on moving into this space to serve external customers?"
"The difference between ODFL vs XPO, is that XPO NOT only does LTL trucking. But also trucking brokerage. Yes? XPO revenues sky rocketted from less than 100 million in 2011 to 17.2 billion in 2020. How come the price is only at 140$ while ODFL is at 260$?Odfl revenue is 7 billion approximately."

"Is that why xpo adding 770 trucks, 5009 new employees?"
I think the decision to split is a big brain move by the CEO.. logistically speaking LTL trucks (less than truckload) don’t add enough revenues to make the expenses worth it and could probably sandbag the financial outlook of this company on a company wide level. I think it makes sense entirely let’s hope it works out for them!
This stock is a bit strange. I had this stock for at least 4-5 years. Last down turn brought the price much lower but it came back roaring. It is down again and my feeling is that this is going to be all time high soon gradually. I am not sure about its earning outlook today!

"This silly little investment thesis I've got going involving ... SHOP $XPO $GXOLas year, I began regularly visiting the other exchanges on which Shopify trades, and reporting back to the chat what the foreign volumes looked like (growing). Tonight I did the same for xpo and gxo. Guess what? It doesn't appear that XPO start trading OTC on foreign exchanges until Spring2016. Their second busiest exchange Frankurt, got busier after Tobi said he wanted to ""play"" in logistics. There isn't a lot of foreign activity, and like Shopify's did, I think it will grow over time. In XPO Munich Mar2021, there was a single block buy of 640 shares. It's easy to keep track of numbers like that, but not if you're trying to make quick trades.XPO has about 3% short of float, gxo none, but now the bet has changed, and it will become much riskier for traders and short sellers going forward. IMO.GXO hasn't traded on as many exchanges yet, but on Monday, there was a block purchase of 6.94k shares, in Berlin, only 100. As these numbers grow, they will become a great foil to traders and market players, sometimes causing inexplicable price movements in North America. i.e. Dusseldor has a bad day, shares of shopify are sold off. Meanwhile, back on the NYSE, SHOP is having a pretty good day on average volume, and SHOP.TO sellers are in heaven because the US dollar is so strong, and the price moves violently on the small float, sometimes with, but often independently of the market. It makes it difficult to traders to get purchase on the stock as its spheres of influence become larger and more diffuse. I think that because of exchange rate fees, plus the exchange itself, these purchasers are less likely to be traders, Inherently stronger hands. Shopify is very good at shaking off traders, although they perhaps have an edge because of their dual uplisting on they NYSE and TSX. XPO created a similar duality by spinning out GXO I predict that BFCM will be phenomenally again, and maybe they will even work the SFN and logistics into the youtube show.. Last year they initiated the carbon offset program (which I am now registered into as a ShopPay consumer), so maybe we can look forward to somehow linking the twoMaybe something like call and answer challenges, or linking their distribution into a part of the show.Meanwhile"

"UPS and FedEx exploded, but XPO is lagging despite being the largest last mile heavy goods provider and explosion in B2C. Unemployment rate is currently 7.9% and Covid-19 cases may explode again heading into normal flu season. In addition, if Biden wins and Dems take the Senate, there will be about 9% reduction in EPS due to corp tax rate increasing from 21% to at least 28%, and also a lot of selling to lock in 20% capital gains tax as Biden will double that rate. Might be a good time to sell some covered Calls or buy some Nov 20 PUTS near end of Oct before the election results fiasco associated with mail in ballots. Wonder how many Democratic counties will have more votes than registered voters, or counties were nearly 100% of the votes are Democrat.

"I am still challenged to decided what to do with these post split shares, so I'm still sitting on the fence. Here's the situation. I'm long since Jan2017, avg'd down to $31 with early trim.XPO Gains = 182.83% @31/sh. ~18%/yr, avg'd over 4 very turbulent years (which is how we got to this place)Since spinout Gains = 3.73% calculated on $85 value. It doesn't seem like a lot, except, for XPO, isn't it just ""business as usual""? We don't know what ""unlocking value"" is going to look like...yet. What Jacobs has cooking.Wouldn't it be funny if XPO bought GXO back?GXO is the new kid on the block, and groomed to zoom. Very sexy, very tech, and no matter how I look at it:Gains = 8,404,900.31% $0.001 from entry/ipo. (free shares at xpo's expense, whose gains dropped dramatically with the split)or Gains = 29.51% based share price at $65 from IPO. How did they assign value, at the time of the split? How and what are the ""unequal potentials""Do I keep looking at the businesses in tandem (and in triune with Shopify) for the next few yearsHow much growth is already baked in to GXO's ipo price?I'm trying to decide whether I should just continue my lazy ways, and hold on to both, or whether I should trim one into the other. It seems to make sense to let the whole lot of them continue appreciating, but I'm not sure whether I'm looking at it the right way.

"xpo went red with -1.95% 30% elevated volumes, about 3.2mln shares , gxo up 6.25% 3.5mln shares traded, one million fewer than yesterday.I wonder if there's a relationship between share movement (not necessarily price) between the two businesses, as the brokerages sort out the administrative end of things? That the numbers we are seeing are shares being transferred to GXO, with some light retail buying into either company, and some selling of xpo. That leaves a difference of about 400k shares of trading activity to drive down xpo AND drive gxo upward.I'm just theorizing, not stating a fact.

"UPS had a fantastic quarter, I expect similar results for XPO and FDX. Have big gains in all 3 and those will only continue to grow well into the future. Load up on all 3 folks. This ride ain’t over yet."
best stock to own as there is no slowdown if the economy goes either way. Recession proof and is shipping is in the highest demand right now. Everyone needs things to be shipped since the world has become internal with online buying and selling. The only company to set up the quick shipping is to have logistics where the product is centrally located and moved quickly. That is why this stock is strong today and will continue to be strong. Bullish

"Unlikely bought by HD, AMZN given if one of them bought xpo, they would be transporting others sales.

using drones to do inventory. now that’s crazy. i like it.
XPO is back! 
"TipRanks (15 analysts) rate XPO ""Strong Buy"" and average target price at $73.50."
How will the 24/7 policy at LA and Long Beach ports effect XPO?
"According to news reports, Jacobs took 100 million as bonus in late 2017, while paying workers $12 an hour. Also, this company has over 4 billion in debt and depends on asset sales to keep it a float. It claims over 500 million net profit but has only 285 million free cash flow? I would not be a shareholder of this company in any way shape or form."
"--JPMorgan Adjusts Price Target for XPO Logistics to $190 From $160, Maintains Overweight Rating 06/29/2021 10:23 a.m. I am bullish on this."
"I'm happy I grabbed an extra 200 shares of GXO earlier this morning. GXO now showing on Yahoo, add the price of XPO and GXO together and you'll be much happier until the GXO shares show up in your account. This is what we've been waiting for!"
"Untill after ( earning report release after market close, Wednesday, August 01) earning report, XPO may trade in this range. It means investors are looking forward for the earning report and future projection by the management. Let us weight see what is in earning report and management statement and Q & A .Good luck to all."
"Announced today: Each XPO stockholder will receive one (1) share of GXO common stock for every one (1) share of XPO common stock held on the record date.Yet the stock is DOWN today, THIS doesn't make sense. The stock should be jumping on this news....."
This transport company is extremely well-run. I expect that they will continue to gain market share over the next 5 years.
It's getting time to put the squeeze on the 12% shorts! This company is growing fast and furious and is a giant in it's industry. Long and strong is the way to go!
Sell XPO. Or buy 10000 shares of XPO and short 10000 shares of XPO. juggle and make money every second.
This stock has stayed green nearly every day during this weeks strong market sell-off. This can only be a positive for investors of XPO and feels it is now at a stabilized floor. So much external pressure and it held 52. I look forward to when the market bounces back from the sell off.
Good stock it will raise next week . Way too much reaction after earnings because expectations where high seeing FedEx and UPS ... I would calmly add shares here nothing to panic .... this one not going anywhere
"I was watching for the point where Schwab had $GXO listed for trade, got 200 shares at $60.0352 early Monday the 2nd. Picked up 200 additional $XPO Tuesday the 3rd at $83.80 and am very happy with 400 shares of each. It was also really interesting to watch how the spinoff worked."
"$20 stock? Yeah, I guess it should only be worth it’s ebitda. They have $9 billion in assets after debt, so it should only be worth $2 billion? This board is rockin with investment geniuses"
Happy new year to all longs
"Only thing which is keeping me motivated while price is going down that the company is also buying back its own stock so they would be able to buy back more shares with such a low price ...I estimated that at $51 , the company should be able to buy back 25% of the outstanding shares with $1.5 bn buyback program but this is getting ridiculously cheap for the company to get even more shares ...Next EPS should be way higher even with 3-5% growth in business. Close to next earning , the stock would be trading close to $60 as the market would factor in all buybacks...this is a good entry point. Might go $1-3 down further bcoz of market sell off but as soon as the market recovers, this will be the first one to take off.."
"Think he’s leaving out fuel prices at a 40 yr low, These are prices when I pumped fuel in highsckool in 1979"
"Jacobs owns 23 million shares, Orbis 20.5, leaving the other half to public. Mgmt is going nowhere, it’s jacobs baby. 18 million fewer shares from buyback, which they still did knowing softness in earnings."
Strong day for both stocks vs. last Friday close @ $138.69. With XPO now @ $83.95 and GXO now at $63.07 — total of $147.02 — we saw an aggregate 6% up day. Congrats longs!
Merrill/bank America downgrade to neutral....does anybody really care what bac says....they were very late to game
"Could be option writers, slam stock, buy buyback covered calls, probably market makers got caught, slam stock and people sell"
"Boeing just had a historical quarter, balance sheet looks good, get ready for the XPO buyout announcement!"
Whats wrong with GXO? I thought logistics was a great place to be....
Love this stock
"Hello New GXO Shareholders! I've been long on XPO since Jan2017, only 4 months longer than one of my other darling stocks, Shopify where I do most of my research and hanging out. SHOP & XPO have been connected to XPO through Shopify's wholly owned subsidiary 6 River Systems, a robotics company that Shop acquired for about $500mln in late 2019, and which has been developing business independently of Shopify as well. I think of them as Shopify's secret weapon.I was checking out an article about some of GXO's blue-chip customers, and noted that Nestle was near the top of the list. Nestle is also one of Shopify's earliest ShopPlus merchants! So then I searched GXO + Shopify, and found 6RS's shout out to GXO on ipo: "" 6 River Systems 8,271 followers 1d ""Our team would like to congratulate GXO Logistics, Inc. on their launch and going public on the NYSE. Thank you for being our partner and including us in your big day. "" I like that last sentence, a lot.So XPO was one of the earliest testers/adopters of the Chuck System. The relationship won't be touted on Shopify finance pages, because 6RS moves in the background. But I have stated that I believe the power hub of Shopify is shifting to the Shopify Fulfillment Network (SFN), which is 6RS. Shopify likes to do things away from spotlights. I wasn't concerned about the recent release of various executives, because of the real action is happening at 6RS.Mr Jacobs and Mr. Lutke are two very smart men. I'm sure Mr. Wilson is too. Talk about unlocking value!GXO is partnered with Shopify, right out of the gate. This is the first time I've seen it in print, no more speculation, and I'm pretty excited! Go $SHOP Go $XPO Go$GXO !!(Sorry for the global posting, I don't do it very often, but this is pretty big, and is not new territory. I think that when Tobi announced that he wanted to ""play"" with logistics, I posted that he should buy xpo)"
XPO will pop to 110 tomorrow before open. Time to buy!
"In case you missed it, this appeared in the Wall Street Journal on Oct 4th. The strong demand for trucking and movement of goods is reflected here:""ACT Research and FTR say orders remain strong, exceeding 42,000 Class 8 trucks last month, and ACT’s Kenny Vieth says he expects orders to stay near the 40,000 mark through the rest of the year.""In reference to how hot the pace is to supply trucks for this industry:""Truck makers have plenty to keep them busy: ACT says the manufacturing backlog is now nearly 11 months, even as the factories churn out 1,300 new rigs a day. ""An example that was given about trucking shortages in the story:"" One analysis showed online grocery out-of-stock rates hover at 15%, nearly double in-store averages. Kroger Co. has fined suppliers who don’t deliver on time and in full, and Walmart Inc. has given more business to those consistently delivering on time. ""Companies with existing large fleets and a strong logistics record stand to profit in this tight shipping market.Delivering on time, in full, will remain in demand. XPO Logistics is well positioned to benefit from this demand.IMHO"
"Morgan Stanley raised their 12 month price target for XPO today, from $50 to $55. That means to me they're expecting the stock to fall by quite a bit, and that it's currently overvalued. Who knows if their call is correct or not."
"Has anyone looked at the price earnings ratio . It’s a ridiculous 155!!! With that high of ratio , it’s way way overpriced ... I like stocks priced at a more reasonable 30 P/E .. Amen"
"Will be very interesting to see who the SEC will punish - Short Sellers vs XPO. With this kind of move today, someone is going to the woodshed."
"XPO Logistics stock has been a darling of Wall Street banking firms. A shortseller’s report out this morning argues that the Amazon.com rival uses aggressive accounting to hide the poor returns on XPO’s growth-by-acquisition strategy. One company director hired a convicted felon who’d been a longtime colleague of XPO CEO Brad Jacobs—claims the report by shortseller Ben Axler—while another director previously solicited investors for Ponzi schemer Marc Dreier. XPO’s $60 a share stock could fall by 50%, says Axler"
Party is over here
"Feeling very positive about XPO Earnings next week. I expect EPS and revenue to come in higher than the consensus estimates. Considering that the stock is currently undervalued, I rate this baby a screaming Buy for Monday, pre-earnings, and intend to go long 200-300 shares before market close."
has anyone received there GXO stocks it still shows im down big
Wasn't Jim Cramer pumping this over FDX and UPS over $100 share a couple of months ago?
Does anyone have a hint when GXO goes public.
XPO has better growth and has gotten past the Amazon loss. FedEx is a different case. buy on any weakness

"Awesome, bought 150 shares under $48. Spruce Point has short position of course, this stock is going back up to $65 - $75 in 3 to 6 months!"
I own a few Buy Calls - will definitely be exercising one of them and riding 100 shares of each for the rest of the year. Both are criminally underpriced!EZPZ
So what's the secret news that's causing this to divebomb?
....and XPO was Stephen Weiss's final trade yesterday lol. Odds of him following his own advice??? Any guesses?
what's going on today with the split? I'm down BIG but no change in number of shares....???
CitiGroup today raised their per share price target by 50% up to $120.00
It’s “How can HD afford to buy XPO?” -Vs- “How can HD NOT afford to buy XPO?”. Enjoy the ride my fellow longs!
I’ve lived thru 20yrs of reading about how much debt URI had. Bradley Jacobs the founder of URI and XPO and uses debt to build these companies from nothing. He’s a master of refinancing debt and raising cash. Before he’ll pay off debt he generally find another company to acquire. Difference is he’s a great business man and he learns every aspect of the businesses he gets in. Check out his history.
I don’t need Bank of America to tell me that xpo Is a good buy at this point.
Does anyone know if current shareholders get any GXO stock?
"Competition from Amazon resulted in XPO lower stock price;Should Amazon hit the wall and find it not as easy to beat the competition, it will make an offer for XPO; give it time to work out the kinks;You should know who wins and loses in 2020 for desired outcome.The pressure is on Amazon more so than XPO."
"Truck transportation is the most lucrative business now, not to throw in the low fuel prices to boost end results! Watch!!! this May double quickly !Just sayin, on radar for long time"
"Here we go ... GXO-WI, $54.50https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GXO-WITJ"
"Earnings in February along with guidance ,will give you a clearer picture if you want to own or not."
"On December 13, 2018, Spruce Point Capital Management released a report titled ''Trucking Ridiculous; End Of The Road"". This report alleges that XPO is plagued by ''financial irregularities that conveniently cover its growing financial strain and inability to complete additional acquisitions despite repeated promises.'' The report also characterizes XPO's financials as ''unreliable and dubious'' stating that Spruce Point has uncovered ''concrete evidence to suggest dubious tax accounting, under-reporting of bad debts, phantom income through unaccountable M&A earn-out labilities, and aggressive amortization assumptions: all designed to portray glowing 'Non-GAAP' results.''"
"Not sure want them bought at $100-125 cause business plan could get to that easily in next 6 months, we’ll beyond after that"
"I saw that XPO has just releases a sustainability report. They said, ""In 2020, we developed an ESG scorecard to provide a progressive means of evaluating the management of ESG initiatives and incentivizing long-term, successive achievements."" I can't help but feel this has been directly inspired by Shopify's attempts to tackle issues surrounding sustainability. I don't think it's a giant leap to make, as XPO has a working relationship with 6River Systems, and their Chuck robotics system. Last year, my brokerage discontinued coverage of XPO, said to sell @$67. Glad I ignored their advice. They ignored mine, about Shopify (in May2017), and again, when I mentioned the xpo/shopify connection last. Long XPO since Jan2017, Long SHOP since May2017. Go! Go! Go!"
Going to $100 easily
is anyone buying at these levels? Sr?
Stephanie on CNBC just said she trimmed XPO and added to GXO worried about the truck driver shortage.
"Louis DeJoy, Postmaster General and former board member XPO, still dismantling USPO and funneling contracts XPO. Further corruption from former 45 appointees."
"Apple stock dropped almost 9 % before earning report that was yesterday . Once report is out, Apple is more or less comeback. I have similar feeling for the XPO Logistics. Let us see what is in the earning report and guidelines for the next quarter and the rest of the year.. Let us observe the earning report statement this afternood after closing bell and tomorrow morning conference with the analysts."
Assuming sellers based on the lack of clarity around acquisition. Only sheep buy on rumor. I’m LONG!
"company can not keep any warehouse employees. They quit all the time because XPO doesn't pay their employees well. $13.75/hr for a warehouse manager. Haven't looked at their Financials or anything, but on the ground it's not looking great."
impressive run.
Been doing some work on this company for a few months now. What company do you fellow investors consider the most closest competitor to XPO and why?
here we go the road to $85.
"with 2.5 billion share buyback, this stock has a 37 percent yield. nice for new shareholders"
Going to need massive cold storage to ship massive amounts of the vaccine is xpo a player i think so
I didn't sell one of my 1000 shares.Got in initially when it was 9 dollars. Im in for the long haul.
"Bradley Jacobs, chairman of XPO and GXO at the Opening Bell, was pointing fingers at the poster of a man. I did not understand why he was pointing to him. In about a minute, the poster was rotated 180 degrees. I am sure there was a good meaning behind it. Anyone can explain what was happening besides the opening bell ceremonies. Thanks."
"If GXO opens at it's current price of $60, what will the price of XPO be on August 2nd?"
"News mentioned XPO biggest customer doing less business; most likely it is Amazon;Therefore, not likely AMZN will be buying XPO; as they are building its own transportation fleet;XPO growth has reverse/paused resulting in it stock going south;Wish there better news to make XPO stock go higher"
"It would be cheaper for Amazon to acquire XPO than to completely build out the logistics piece that XPO already has. Plus, it allows them to stop using FedEx and UPS altogether. For Amazon, it comes down to control. And with XPO they would have the missing piece that would allow them to not only control their own logistics and supply chain than they already do but it would save them money and become as large of a player in transportation as FedEX and UPS. Amazon already spends 4-5B each year on freight so why not own the rest of the pieces to the puzzle that to continue to outsource? The move by Amazon to pull it’s business was both necessary (XPO’s poor service) and advantageous because they kill the stock price of one of their very own vendors (and improve the service). If it happens then you expect a big drop in FedEx and UPS share prices as they lose Amazon’s business too. The only thing you can count on in life is change. XPO’s biggest mistake was relying on Amazon’s business too much. They should have continued to build off of the fact that that had Amazon as a customer and continues to acquire more customers. This way, when they lose a big customer like Amazon, they have others to take its place. It boils down to mismanagement on the part of XPO. They simply rested on their laurels and ignored the writing that has been on the wall for the last several years. Shame on them for not have a contingent plan for when the day came that they would lose Amazon. Don’t you think FedEx and UPS haven’t seen what Amazon has been doing for years now? It’s no secret that Amazon wants to control how their logistics and supply chain are run. XPO’s ignored the facts and was too late in reacting. And now they’re paying the price."
"Lots of takeover chatter, market not buying it based on vol, option activity. Buying back stock prevents too cheap of deal if it were to happen, gives Jacobs greater ownership and he is biggest investor before buy back, even bigger after. Cramer says too many delivery companies, might be ups or fdx, which means it probably won’t given Cramer’s track record. By end of year the company will have replaced lost amzn rev and then some, last year picked up 3.9 bill in new business which is starting show up"
"Beat top, bottom, rallied on 59,000 shares in after market above close, dropped on 14000 after that"
This stock continues to quietly amaze me.
Help~I tried to buy GXO this AM on Ameritrade. It was rejected-why? Thanks
Do you think we (as investors) need to worry about the future of the company with the class action that occured? Is XPO really guilty or not? I feel like going on on my buy-and-hold strategy..
Walmart turning 60 sams into ecommerce hubs...good for xpo
"Here’s one reason Amazon probably left XPO. XPO poached Amazon’s top Transportaion exec. Bad for Amazon but good for XPO. Let the analysts noodle on that! Of course it still hurts XPO that Amazon took their business and let but that was going to happen eventually any way. In my opinion, this move improves XPO’s executive team and thus makes them a stronger company. XPO will fund new customers to replace Amazon’s business and their stock will rise once again. It just may take a little bit of time. And we will have to keep a close eye on anything resembling a recession as it will hit the Transportation industry hard. Let’s hope this news changes some analysts to upgrade the stock to a BUY!"
July 31 is the release of 2nd qtr figures.Should we be Positive~Flat~Negative about the results??
I am a little naive about this. When the company spins off the GXO unit will XPO owners get stock in a new company??
"Nice $3 drop from the highs on a triple digit DOW up day. Great fundamentals, right?"
think this'll SPLIT?
"On Jan 29, 2018 received a letter from Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check LLP - Notice is hereby given that two lawsuits have been filed on those who purchased or acquired XPO between 2/26/2014 to 12/13/2018. They are fishing for clients for a class action suit. Not sure of the validity but it is going to end up costing XPO time and money to defend themselves. What are the odds if this is a bogus claim that XPO can sue the law firm, or that the SEC gets involved?"
"All trans have beat and raised guidance. Xpo hiring 5000 more workers does not sound like any slowdown her, unique co"
Blow out earnings coming just like UPS today. Buy now. 75 on earnings.
What’s going on?
In at $36.49. XPO has been a steady growth stock with decent financials and innovative new ways to deliver their service. Hold!
"Wayyy over sold. Buying more even if it dips more. Logistics is here to stay in, during, and after pandemic.I can’t imagine how the industry will grow exponentially after pandemic! $100 price range by end of year."
Nice to see both stocks out of the gate nicely today post spin. Both are leaders in fast growing supply chain segments.
Putrid volume today. Will be an interesting week...
What will happen to $XPO once the split is complete? Will it go down by the $GXO price? Help here!
"If it's helpful to people here, I've calculated the 3Aug split date with the following values.XPO $84.68, say $85GXO $64.90, say $65The ratio 1716:1000 can be worked out precisely, but I just took Yahoo's opening numbers and created two new lots, one at each price, so that we have a way to measure values as they unfold. It's easier to do with GXO because it's new, but the continuity of GXO meant that I needed a starting value by which to examine the both companies.Happily, xpo is up about 9.55%, and gxo is a very attractive 18.55% since 3Aug Of course, this can all fluctuate from day to day, but it's a very nice start! Once the share-shuffling is done, I think it will be fun watching them in tandem. Will XPO become less volatile, or more? It's sort of a given, with GXO. Go GXO! Go $XPO!"
"Good news:XPO Logistics Renews Partnership with Asda to Provide Reverse Logistics ServicesGREENWICH, Conn., Aug. 13, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XPO Logistics, Inc. (NYSE: XPO), a leading global provider of transport and logistics solutions, has renewed its partnership with Asda Stores Ltd. to provide reverse logistics and other asset management services. The three-year contract extends XPO’s relationship with the British supermarket chain to more than two decades.XPO will continue to manage the logistics for Asda’s product trays through a network of nine sites. The returned assets are washed, inspected and reused for product distribution, or may be sold or recycled. XPO is an integral partner in Asda’s zero-waste strategy, ensuring eco-friendly recycling of cardboard, plastic and food waste.Proprietary XPO technology, developed in conjunction with Asda, will be used to manage a pool of over eight million assets and oversee 250 supplier accounts. Since 2002, XPO and Asda have collaborated to create tailored reverse logistics and asset management solutions.Chris Hall, senior director, central logistics – Asda Stores Ltd., said, “We’re delighted to be continuing our successful partnership with XPO. Together, we’ve worked hard to implement far-reaching waste reduction initiatives and achieve significant savings and other efficiencies. We look forward to nurturing further improvements across our reverse network.”Gavin Williams, managing director, supply chain – UK and Ireland, XPO Logistics, said, “The teams at Asda and XPO have worked tirelessly to drive tangible cost reductions and process improvements for Asda. We’re excited to use our expertise with asset management to realize even greater productivity, delivered through customized technology.”"
"Tomorrow 2/7 after market close, earnings presented. Earnings should top estimates, and forward-looking more on the positive side; but market pullback may still result in sell-off; hope this is not the case, as XPO has peaked at about 98 down to 89.No comments by HD or AMZN if XPO is rumored purchase per news article back in November/December 2017. One wonders if Jacobs wants to sell XPO at a certain price, which is all too high, and all parties back out. Maybe some news presented before February 2018 ends."
Nobody is buying less stuff online and not having it shipped.Just play the trend and don't kick yourself later
Does XPO announce earnings before the opening bell or after the closing bell?
Let’s go !
"51 vs .39 expected, revs 2.6% below estimates, solid earnings beat. Confirmed guidance for rest of 19, added $1.1 billion that will come in through of rest year."
"Bigger Bigger Picture......Amazon WILL outbid Home Depot for $XPO and XPO will go HYDROGEN in late 2018 as Amazon will ALSO buy into NIKOLA MOTORS at a 10 billion VALUATION........WABCO also has a 1% interest........I'm betting Amazon uses that 10 billion from Amazon to BUY some REFUELING STATIONS in their already PROVEN 30 Hydrogen Station Supplier..........When Amazon Hydrogen is announced in 2018, you will CURSE the day you EVER followed 36 million over the cliff"
Still a great company i'm holding. Revenue vs last year for the quarter was up over 11% still more growth to come. Buying more now at this price.
I think that the lack of clarity on the acquisition means that something is going on. Otherwise they'll just come out and tell you flat out that it's all FALSE (although they know it'll affect the stock price). I'm looking for a opportunity to buy more.
"The stock price has dropped from $ 115 to $ 60 area in about 60 days. It is beyond small investor's understanding. price's movement.The company is growing and expanding and considered No. 1 growing company among transportation trucking industry. It is known this stock has high institution support. It is disturbing to see this stock is being crushed at this juncture. In my opinion, it is time that the management should come out and explain what is happening in the company to calm the investor.. That's my opinion."
"Everything since the “rumor” started a few days ago seems to indicate this news is far from being a rumor, but with significant substance. CEO Jacob had multiple experiences in developing companies and sold them at premium prices from different industries! Such a genius and seems to do it again this time. Those who bet against him are being incinerated!"
Read this article about Spruce Capital. Sounds like they have a shady business.
"New business is twice what they lost, said will be on by end of year..."
Due for pullback to 70 I think
"There are no accounting issues, the loan was unsecured which supports it. We go back up from here, try doing some research prior to posting."
"Lots of potential suitors. Walmart, jd.com, baba, hd, amzn, brk'a to name a few"
"Interesting dichotomy here, we have Amazon pulling their account, meanwhile they announce that they are going to one day delivery. We have all seen the weak attempts at doing a lot of the local distribution with their look alike UPS trucks with the big mushroom stamp on the side of them. Could they have announced that move initially to drop the price to a reasonable take over point? Then again, if that was the case you would think they would have made a tender offer for the company after it tanked. Though I am not sure how the SEC would consider that type of move, you pull the largest account from a trucking firm and then you announce a take over of the same company. Not sure how Amazon really thinks it will gear up for one day delivery in a very short time unless they go on an acquisition spree."
"This video shows exactly what to know about XPO Logistics, it shows you the reasons for the big drop in price since last months, the expected future growth, and it gives a realistic perspective at today's metrics of the company. Interesting to watch and worth it if you are considering buying the stock!https://youtu.be/vpb-39kgkSQ"
Let’s hope this can stay above 70 for a while
You've got to love the updated 20.48 PE. This should be able to get a new valuation of at least 30 up up up.
