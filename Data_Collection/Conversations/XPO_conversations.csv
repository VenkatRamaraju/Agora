"TipRanks (15 analysts) rate XPO ""Strong Buy"" and average target price at $73.50."
"On the shipping container backup: There needs to be just as many women loading and unloading just as many shipping containers as men (and on the night shift too). Diversity is key for any successful business, otherwise they should not be allowed to operate."
"This silly little investment thesis I've got going involving ... SHOP $XPO $GXOLas year, I began regularly visiting the other exchanges on which Shopify trades, and reporting back to the chat what the foreign volumes looked like (growing). Tonight I did the same for xpo and gxo. Guess what? It doesn't appear that XPO start trading OTC on foreign exchanges until Spring2016. Their second busiest exchange Frankurt, got busier after Tobi said he wanted to ""play"" in logistics. There isn't a lot of foreign activity, and like Shopify's did, I think it will grow over time. In XPO Munich Mar2021, there was a single block buy of 640 shares. It's easy to keep track of numbers like that, but not if you're trying to make quick trades.XPO has about 3% short of float, gxo none, but now the bet has changed, and it will become much riskier for traders and short sellers going forward. IMO.GXO hasn't traded on as many exchanges yet, but on Monday, there was a block purchase of 6.94k shares, in Berlin, only 100. As these numbers grow, they will become a great foil to traders and market players, sometimes causing inexplicable price movements in North America. i.e. Dusseldor has a bad day, shares of shopify are sold off. Meanwhile, back on the NYSE, SHOP is having a pretty good day on average volume, and SHOP.TO sellers are in heaven because the US dollar is so strong, and the price moves violently on the small float, sometimes with, but often independently of the market. It makes it difficult to traders to get purchase on the stock as its spheres of influence become larger and more diffuse. I think that because of exchange rate fees, plus the exchange itself, these purchasers are less likely to be traders, Inherently stronger hands. Shopify is very good at shaking off traders, although they perhaps have an edge because of their dual uplisting on they NYSE and TSX. XPO created a similar duality by spinning out GXO I predict that BFCM will be phenomenally again, and maybe they will even work the SFN and logistics into the youtube show.. Last year they initiated the carbon offset program (which I am now registered into as a ShopPay consumer), so maybe we can look forward to somehow linking the twoMaybe something like call and answer challenges, or linking their distribution into a part of the show.Meanwhile"
"It was just announced that effective Monday 30Aug21, xpo will be rejecting Amzn's LTLs into Albany. The link wouldn't stick, but the headline is "" FreightWaves XPO to stop hauling inbound LTL traffic in Albany, NY -- As of Monday, XPO Logistics Inc. will no longer accept inbound LTL shipments on one of its lanes in Albany, N.Y. and destined for Ama""""Arming the Rebels"". If you put enough rebels together, suddenly there's an army. And once you build an army, other armies will start to appear. Today's thought is that Xpo is just as interested in carving into the Amazon pie as Shopify. The financial media has not been kind to xpo either. They are both industry distuptors, and the stock has been volatile. Amazon spanked them by cancelling some contracts in 2019 and share price tumbled, they got knocked by House of Fraser's bankruptcy etc.So now, XPO is cancelling amzn's business at a time when everybody is seriously short of staff. What does it mean? What's the grand plan...What if the companies that wanted to take jabs at mighty Amazon ganged up together, and strategized synergistically? I think that maybe (and it's a big maybe), this is Xpo putting pressure back on Amazon, which they couldn't do without the nimble (and hungry) SFN backing them up."

"There's always a period of adjustment after an event like this. Portfolio rebalancing etc. The two equities have to find their own price. It can sometimes take a while. For example, aapl didn't recover their pre-split price for about 9 month. Some people will move into xpo, others into gxo, others simply want to grab their winnings. Maybe institutions will take some profits now.Their could be some volatility with with both companies, since they are both unknowns now. Two companies means twice the risk, so there's trimming going on.You have to shrug it off, shift focus. do something else or you can drive yourself mad. Check in every week, or month. If you look at xpo's 5 year chart, you will see why I've spent a lot of the past five years ignoring the price movement. It's exciting, but you also have to be able to sleep and night. Investing should NOT cause distress. It's important to handle the emotional side of things. I love my businesses, and give them the time they need to get things done.Fortunately for us all, Shopify's foray into Europe should send profits trickling in fairly quickly. This is LTP, long term play, and these are brand new days! Love your companies. Give them time to shine. Look at xpo's 5yr chart! I trimmed some profits when it began crasing Sept2018, and it didn't hit $85 again until Jan2021. Aapl traded sideways for 9 months after the split. Great time be building a position, or simply leaving your investment to mature.Yes, a little bit down down today. Volumes were also down 30% over yesterday. The dust needs to settle. The administrative end is still being looked after. Red green red green.. Investors are far less excited by normal daily price movement, than the traders and scouts since we think in terms of quarters, years and decades.. Eventually we move so far away from our entry price that we don't even think about it. Its a function of Time, and not becoming impatient, just like Warren Buffet says.@Abdul. I'm not against trading (although I don't), but I always suggest that people should avoid shorting and trading Shopify. It's been tragic seeing so much money thrown away. Shopify, xpo and gxo are nimble and creative in a way that few companies are, and now that they are partnered AND are both disruptors, Shopify will teach them some of their...tricks...to discourage traders and short selling. Nobody build a brand quite like Shopify, and they're very generous. XPO, pre-split, needed to grow revenues 50% to catch up with their nearest competition, I can't escape the sense that they and Shopify and gxo of course fit heavily into each other's plans. At the 6RS website, ""In no particular order"" they have listed the top 20 logistics company they are doing business with, and xpo is one of them. I'm trying not to read too much into it, but XPO is number one on the list, and Europe is where they plan to make serious coin with SHOP. I just know that I'm right.$SHOP now has more than 3 million merchants. That's 715,000 more than they had on 10June.21. More than half are US merchants, which bodes well for $XPO, and the balance are from everywhere else, like Europe..It's gonna be great!"
Stephanie on CNBC just said she trimmed XPO and added to GXO worried about the truck driver shortage.
Any Views on Zacks strong sell rating of XPO? The date on this is 9/14.
"I was watching for the point where Schwab had $GXO listed for trade, got 200 shares at $60.0352 early Monday the 2nd. Picked up 200 additional $XPO Tuesday the 3rd at $83.80 and am very happy with 400 shares of each. It was also really interesting to watch how the spinoff worked."
"If you want own stock to capture the growth in e-commerce, but can't stomach the extremely high PE multiples for companies like Amazon or Shopify, then XPO is an excellent choice. Very reasonable multiples, they are largest last mile delivery company for heavy goods, and have an excellent CEO. This stock is currently cheap, and could easily be at $80 - $85 by fall."
"If it's helpful to people here, I've calculated the 3Aug split date with the following values.XPO $84.68, say $85GXO $64.90, say $65The ratio 1716:1000 can be worked out precisely, but I just took Yahoo's opening numbers and created two new lots, one at each price, so that we have a way to measure values as they unfold. It's easier to do with GXO because it's new, but the continuity of GXO meant that I needed a starting value by which to examine the both companies.Happily, xpo is up about 9.55%, and gxo is a very attractive 18.55% since 3Aug Of course, this can all fluctuate from day to day, but it's a very nice start! Once the share-shuffling is done, I think it will be fun watching them in tandem. Will XPO become less volatile, or more? It's sort of a given, with GXO. Go GXO! Go $XPO!"
"I am still challenged to decided what to do with these post split shares, so I'm still sitting on the fence. Here's the situation. I'm long since Jan2017, avg'd down to $31 with early trim.XPO Gains = 182.83% @31/sh. ~18%/yr, avg'd over 4 very turbulent years (which is how we got to this place)Since spinout Gains = 3.73% calculated on $85 value. It doesn't seem like a lot, except, for XPO, isn't it just ""business as usual""? We don't know what ""unlocking value"" is going to look like...yet. What Jacobs has cooking.Wouldn't it be funny if XPO bought GXO back?GXO is the new kid on the block, and groomed to zoom. Very sexy, very tech, and no matter how I look at it:Gains = 8,404,900.31% $0.001 from entry/ipo. (free shares at xpo's expense, whose gains dropped dramatically with the split)or Gains = 29.51% based share price at $65 from IPO. How did they assign value, at the time of the split? How and what are the ""unequal potentials""Do I keep looking at the businesses in tandem (and in triune with Shopify) for the next few yearsHow much growth is already baked in to GXO's ipo price?I'm trying to decide whether I should just continue my lazy ways, and hold on to both, or whether I should trim one into the other. It seems to make sense to let the whole lot of them continue appreciating, but I'm not sure whether I'm looking at it the right way. I'm posting the same thing on the XPO board, but not as a global post. Would love to hear people's thoughts."

Why is XPO a good investment in relation to its peers?
"Louis DeJoy, Postmaster General and former board member XPO, still dismantling USPO and funneling contracts XPO. Further corruption from former 45 appointees."
How will the 24/7 policy at LA and Long Beach ports effect XPO?
Its 8/19+Did I hear something about an XPO strike for more pay?
"Has anyone else having an issue with XPO cost basis after the Monday 8/2 spin off distribution? My XPO cost basis has not been updated. This has wiped out my profits!! Ex. 4/9/2020, I bought XPO at $66. Last Friday 7/30/21 it closed at about $140, thus having profit of 112%. On Monday, after the distribution, XPO was $84 but my cost basis remained the same causing my profit to drop to 27%. I have other lots of XPO at higher cost basis now showing negative loss instead of positive gains because the cost basis hasn't been adjusted to the new distribution. I have read the shareholder pdf and there was no mention of adjusting cost basis. Usually after the first day of trading the new cost basis is determined."
"company can not keep any warehouse employees. They quit all the time because XPO doesn't pay their employees well. $13.75/hr for a warehouse manager. Haven't looked at their Financials or anything, but on the ground it's not looking great."
