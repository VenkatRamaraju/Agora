"Got out. They have stopped and in some places lowered their rent due to COVID, so growth there has been priced in may be over valued. Still great stock though."
"I'm not really looking to get into the storage industry, but I was doing my due diligence and checking them out just because I was curious. All I have to say is WOW...PSA has an incredible balance sheet. It's very expensive relatively to it's competitors but it's going on my watchlist anyway."
PSA reached a new 52 Week Low at 181.31
"Cost of goods going up, demand for goods increasing, time to liquidate your junk demand for storage in past couple decades us because goods were under priced, that's going away, so will storage growth long term"
Is this a good dividend stock
Advanced smart security devices from AiTX should be employed by PSA providing increased security at a much lower cost.
"Strong Buy, higher ups in the company are expecting a boom this year Q2-Q3. Price increases on all units and deal with Remax. BUY BUY BUY"
"This is Grandma’s stock, you buy it and put it away and collect the dividend and enjoy the good life."
They bought 6 new facilities. Why did their property manager costs go up 20%? With so many people out of work they could improve that number.

"Got in $PSA today. There seems to be good support here around 195, and as I said before on this board, this balance sheet is prestine...one of the best i've found to be honest. I'm concerned about the double top pattern it has formed on the 5 year chart, but it's down considerably from the highs."

the eviction Moratorium bares it fangs..... value will drive higher
Unless you consider the stay on evictions is lifted... and in the next 6-18 months all those subject need a place to store their stuff...then PSA can charge whatever they want for units that will be in high demand.
work for public storage in canada and we raise our prices every year because the demand is there. Great company.
what I didn't know I sewed the whole market up
Getting into that buy range soon.
Elliot Mgmt has built a stake in PSA and nominated six directors to the board

Check out my post below from 11 months ago. “Going to 250.” I was too modest.
What are the common reasons for people making use of storage space and how long does that typically translate into for contracts/renewals? Do small businesses make use of the space for inventory/order fulfillment? Trying to better understand the company from a customer perspective. I have never used a storage space and am looking for information from those who have. Thank you!
wow. why this down so much today
Valued at 12 times sales. Partying like its 1999. The valuation on this is absolutely obscene considering it's growing sales at 3% a year. Even if this was growing at 6% (which it is nowhere close to) a year I am getting a around $100 fair value.
Love how the momo algos don’t distinguish between a stock falling for fundamental reasons vs a stock opening lower becuz it went ex- dividend.
"Capital appreciation on this stock will increase after we enter a global economic depression (see the 10 year yield?- Oh and we have another one of those predicable Republican presidents that always give us recessions!) More impoverishment as the rich continue to extract wealth from the rapidly dwindling middle class (trickle-up economics) and thus we are forced to store our stuff in storage, including ourselves as we go broke, Currently and the top 1 per center's own more wealth than the 99 percent of the rest of us. That can't stand for too long before we all collapse."
UMM....... Great short right now
what is going on why the big drop today?
"Yes, this was a super short, and now it's at 210..."
This thing is ripe and a cash flow beast. I’ve been watching this for months and it’s now a nice pick up and hold on stock.
I don’t understand why we are not using the smart AR security devices from AiTX to protect our locations.
#PSA Looking good for higher prices. Buy rating: 5 at 9trading. Long over 234.61 for a run up to 292.13.
Wii the stock ever split?
See if $200 holds...
