"Very strange stock indeed. This is supposed to treat an orphan indication, and, a pediatric indication, and, it is thus far without a treatment. How can the FDA reject this drug if it has some efficacy? I am willing to put down some money I can afford to lose, accumulate some shares when the price is still low, and wait for a year."
"For the two Phase III trials, according to the filings at clinicaltrials.gov for HSCT-TMA they currently have one site open at Duke Medical Center and are targeting a completion date of November 2023. For BP, they do not have any sites open, and for part A are targeting a completion date of March 2023. So may not be much news in this stock for the next 18 months or so, unless they can find a partner for their eye programs."
"AKTX has been a roller coaster over the past week. Congrats to all of those who made money on this one. Friday didn’t look great but it is looking primed for a bounce in the Premarket. I am going to keep watching this one and in the meantime I have been watching small cap stocks in hopes that I can find another runner before the run. One I have been watching lately is like Amazon Prime but they will get you anything you want even if it is not on the site. http://billion.finance/OnDemand"""

"ha ha ha.. there is a Mr. Big V and a Mr. Small v.. who do we trust... it is like a good cop and bad cop. One says the company will burn its cash and other says it will go upto 8-10 and then $20. Here is what they said in their earnings call: Treatment with Nomacopan (Coversin) in three patients with mild-to-moderate bullous pemphigoid (BP) resulted in no drug-related adverse events and rapid reduction in BP Disease Area Index (BPDAI) score and blistering in ongoing Phase II clinical trialPivotal clinical trial for pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant-related thrombotic microangiopathy (HSCT-TMA) expected to start Q4 2019Initial data on atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) and pre-clinical back of the eye program to be presented at Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) 2019Long-term clinical study with Nomacopan (Coversin) continues to yield encouraging safety dataWith all that if you think they will burn cash with no investors then you are just ANOTHER FEARMONGER here who talks with no facts. How do you know they will burn cash in 2 quarters? Do you know their Burn rate? Have you seen their cash holdings? Revenue? do you know how much is their spend in terms of SG&A, expenses (salaries etc)?So, please share details based on facts and not just say someting.. your words matter and they affect people and opinions. Please be responsible. If I mentioned something which isnt write, I am sorry.. correct me!"

"Not Only Is This a Low Floater , only 9 Million Float But The Drug Is Orphan Condition , Unmet Medical Need Drug."
"for those who missed selling at $3.00 , keep onto your holdings. 30million buyers are still there(maybe just one buyer?) and this little company is making progress towards its FDA approval. At $1.80 the risk of continued losing is minimal. Don't sell now!"

"Not that I'm looking for deep rooted financial advise here, but how can a company release positive news, positive outcome from a meeting, head on to Phase 3, be up 40% in the premarket...and just now go red on the day. I get that it'll take more work but seriously...negative on the day???"
I didn't think I would get shares this cheap again lol - fundamentals haven't changed so its a pretty easy decision but would like to see the namocopan P3 interims to be sure which I thought would be out per the data disclosure blackout deadline for the EHA conference which was over at 830 CEST today (around midnight this morning in NA).
