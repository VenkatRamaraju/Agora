I'm smelling MM. $100 sell orders down the line. Knocking off stop losses and then rising back up. This happened with nvax 3 times each time before great news and a massive jump.
Volume speaks for itself. Strong buy on the dip.
"Great closing, hopefully will see 10 tomorrow."
This will be double digit in a few months
This is a good sign for the whole week with a positive start.
I bought on the way up today--4k shares at $5.20......I am happy--this will test $12-15 tomorrow for sure
I had bought today at 8:30 and now down to 6:40 .....huge loss versus celebrating great run on this
"With a strong close and up on a red day, tomorrow will be awesome."
Who has premium service to access this report by Argus for PT $128?
she's got a lot more in her
Now it's time for this baby to go up to 6 bucks
This will keep going up 3 days till it reach $7 all gaps filled
I read through the history of the M&A activity and how Akari came to be. Still going through the SEC filings and I need to do more DD ( safety and efficacy..) but I am interested in Nomacopan as it relates to the dual inhibitory capabilities and the progress of the trials plus the other FDA status the company has.
"Finally, the company is doing something right for COVID19. It should work. The company is too shy to make an accouncement."
"AKTX has been a roller coaster over the past week. Congrats to all of those who made money on this one. Friday didn’t look great but it is looking primed for a bounce in the Premarket. I am going to keep watching this one and in the meantime I have been watching small cap stocks in hopes that I can find another runner before the run. One I have been watching lately is like Amazon Prime but they will get you anything you want even if it is not on the site. http://billion.finance/OnDemand"""
she's gonna heat up here this afternoon I think
I think this will get back up to 3.5-4 range soon (may be a month). Be patient!

"Significant amount of trading this AM, over One Millions shares the first hour, way, way above average. Take Notice"
"Only 9 Million Float, FDA Fast Track Announced This Morning, and Already Over 20 Million Traded, Let's Go Longs, This Can Go to $6.00 Fast and EASY."
There will be an eye program update too
Akari has an ongoing clinical trial in the UK to treat COVID-19 using Nomacopan (rVA576).https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2020-001860-27/GB
I’ve seen this chart too many times to know it’s going back up.
Most interesting and important platform that cures devastating deceases.
This little Sleeper stock is about to be woken up
"Market Cap $70 million /Cash balance $18,3 Million / 2 attractive Phase 3 Programs / Results from Covid 19 trial coming anyday now = Dirt cheap Biotech with SIGNIFICANT upside ...GLhttps://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/8763/board/20210106124138-screenshot-2021-01-06-ac4c08a2-cda9-4331-8033-c0b.png"
It seems like the only reason is not over $4 or $5 by now is because SEC pauses the stocks to avoid going to $70 like BPTH. Let’s hope for $5 for now?!
"""We are pleased that our company is now in the process of planning or undertaking pivotal trials in both BP and HSCT-TMA as well as progressing next clinical steps for studies in atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) and COVID-19 pneumonia,” Finally, the management made it public on their effort to fight COVID19"
Was hoping to see the data this morning. It looks like the market agrees--flat to down.
"Dear Millionaires,Short squeeze set up "
"Hmm, somebody is buying up share dumpers on this dips..ht Stock..Any news coming o what?"
I can't find any news but I doubled my position over the weekend just to be safe.
I know its not a lot but I made 120$ in 3 minutes time. Bought 400 shares at 7.30 and sold at 7.70
With the pr after the bell. Imo tommarow $5 close going into the presentation
I need a stock that can make or lose me 100%+ ASAP
Best day I’ve had in a while. Got a chance to shake off some old losses. Good luck everyone!
It's really wrong what you say after hours it goes down is a good sign it happens to be and those who can trade after hours try to lower a gate of something good that has the potential for upsets Don't get too excited after hours it doesn't mean anything
April 28- May 3rd is the Eye program updates and presentation.One of the more important ones !!!!
High volume though . Is either pump or dump or something is happening . I will wait
I was right when I get out premarket. Still was good run
Up to 10?
interim phase 3 data will be out thursday or at the latest premarket on Friday - book it
"ALXN Soliris is first generation complement inhibitor.Coversin is second generation, and also dual action with Stem cellYet AKTX has two catalysts in Q1: Coversin in Atopic keratoconjunctivitis Phase 1/2 Bullous Pemphigoid Phase 2.Can someone provide a price target for this?"
The people who bought in today may want to stay for a short while. This thing is going to pop on Monday
"pumpers, why do you think this is going anywhere today. lower lows and volume drying up. just day traders now."
Looks like we are going up until they give us some news. if you buy now you could double your money. I am playing it safe and only got 100 shares but seems good so
Just gonna hold this one overnight
Getting ready for a huge jump. 
"Dual action. Opened door for other fatal deseases/Can't ask for more "" two children treated with Coversin as part of a U.K. named-patient program. Both saw a rapid reduction in markers of complement activation and normalization of platelet count, red blood cell fragments, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and hypertension."""
Good call today!! We did!! Bravo for those who held till After Hour!! 
They did this with BTRH and the stock went up higher and higher through out the day. Do not sell your stock.
"if you own several thousands shares, you would be considered a major stockholder I suppose"
be patient and hope it will soon be 10 $ or higher
based on what i read this will be above 6 tomorrow ......huge potential and can lead lot of areas
In my opinion if the news is good the response by institutions will have a few days lag just due to the stage this company is in right now. I think its going to take a few days for the institutional market to respond and start taking positions. Retail might take this up on its own but when the institutions start taking notice it should provide us with a nice base of support to hold the gains.
"For the two Phase III trials, according to the filings at clinicaltrials.gov for HSCT-TMA they currently have one site open at Duke Medical Center and are targeting a completion date of November 2023. For BP, they do not have any sites open, and for part A are targeting a completion date of March 2023. So may not be much news in this stock for the next 18 months or so, unless they can find a partner for their eye programs."
I'm out @ $5.60 made good money :) good luck!
If 1.56 falls please put a stop loss at 1.34. If that support falls who knows where this will go
Nice pre-market
"This is what I think. AKTX is a high risk investment. But, it is so much better than a lottery ticket. It definitely has a chance for success. It may eventually develop a successful drug, or, another pharma company may buy its technology. At a market cap of merely $35M, for any kind of success, the reward will be huge."
longs what do u think how stock will react to financial results and all the potential stuff they have outlined
Nothing crazy here on the earnings release after the bell. Minimized losses from prior year. Looking for positive momentum into the next week with eye presentation ahead.
Where can I find the upcoming report on phase 3 data due today??? Please send link or something. Highly appriciated.
34+ million traded yesterday = 4x the float and it goes up $1.3+million traded today and it’s down 0.75. Strange.
%100 up tomorrow? 
I didn't think I would get shares this cheap again lol - fundamentals haven't changed so its a pretty easy decision but would like to see the namocopan P3 interims to be sure which I thought would be out per the data disclosure blackout deadline for the EHA conference which was over at 830 CEST today (around midnight this morning in NA).
Who needs to go to Spain to run with the bulls when I can run with them right hereBull Run begins
Sold my position with a loss now it will rise !!!
Buy more so they can hire more board members
New high is coming this week?
Tomorrow will be over 10?......
"I have 18,000 shares at 7.60"
"Just sole wild guess but tomorrow is going to drop hard. Take a look at the past with this company. They ran from 10 to 45 in a single day in 2015 August 19th. The next day keep running to 60, and droped to 20. Next week 10. Just saying. Save your profits"
Ok then what's up for tomorrow?
I've followed this stock for the last few days the trend is tomorrow should be is biggest day this should reach close to 5 or over
Very risky to go in now with a potential sell off when the market opens. It also could just open a lot higher than it is now..
How can anyone expect this to go up much furthers it’s already gone I’m up 220%??!!
No too many folks here.. Perhaps this recent news will draw folks back...
"I wish I knew then what I know now ...I used to have one of these original games when I was a kid...wish now I would have kept my Atari set in the box...breakout what my favorite game back thenOh...this isn’t Atari? My bad..well, I still play breakout today , with stocks"
Multi day RUN! Let's see 9++
This ticker has a high potential to explode on Monday — I don’t own this ticker ~~
We have a bunch of catalysts in June and still no official covid announcement. This is just the beginning.
I told you guys whenever it reaches 27M this one was foing to spike really fast!!
"As I warned yesterday morning when this was breaking out, though receiving FDA Fast Track Designation is good news, its impact typically wears off quickly."
Going back up. All aboard the money train. Broke people wait on the tracks.
"Akari Therapeutics PLC shares AKTX, +11.92% soared 13% in premarket trade Friday, after the company said it has won U.S. Food and Drug Administration Orphan Drug Designation for nomacopan for the treatment of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (HSCT-TMA), a rare disorder. The designation comes after the FDA granted nomacopan Fast Track Designation, which means the regulator will accelerate the approval process. ""The granting of orphan drug designation and Fast Track designation by the FDA for nomacopan underscores the significant unmet medical need in this disease,"" said Clive Richardson, Akari chief executive, in a statement. Shares have gained 22.9% in 2019, while the S&P 500 SPX, +1.27% has gained 16.6%."
"I got so much problems of knowing when too sell and buy! I bought this when it was on 2.98 earlier today and didn't want to get gready so i sold it on 4.5 and was happy then i saw it keep going up so i decided to buy it on 5 and then it went down so i panicked and sold it on 4,65 and now i saw that it went up to 5.3 again -.- !! imagine if i didn't touch it from 2.98 the first time i bought it Anybody else who also buy and sell because they want to be ""careful"" but end up missing out ?"
I bought at 340 at 7 . omg

Will this drive up with the approvals this week?
the short squeeze is coming at around 18 million volume. it will be epic
"Prediction: If it ends near $6 today, tomorrow gap up to $10. Please vote."
long
this is the best way for a stock to increase.....SLOWLY.....that way it stays under the radar and off the day-traders screens.....patience fellas....
"looks interesting, price/valuation seems low assuming the Yahoo numbers are accurate. They are going to need to raise cash very soon. Obviously they could sell, partner, or issue stock. The company only has about 2 quarters of cash and their current liabilities are greater than cash."
"AKTX Coversin can be as good as Soliris, multibillion dollar revenue potential.Only a matter of time before proper valuation is given to AKTX.How high can it go? becomes a question and also a problem"
"Luis, it is very interesting, 2 days this stock started moving up a little bit because the insiders had the information and started quietly buying,,,but the rest of us have to wait untill the news hits....but so is life......"
"a BEAST on a bloody red day, continue higher tomorrow"
Congrats to those who got in early on AKTX. Looking great. I had been watching this one for a little while. Trying to find a new high potential and found this On-Demand start up that seems to have a lot of potential http://billion.finance/OnDemand
"""Akari is actively pursuing several clinical study opportunities in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in the UK and U.S. The Company intends to provide additional detail when these programs are finalized and approved."""
"ha ha ha.. there is a Mr. Big V and a Mr. Small v.. who do we trust... it is like a good cop and bad cop. One says the company will burn its cash and other says it will go upto 8-10 and then $20. Here is what they said in their earnings call: Treatment with Nomacopan (Coversin) in three patients with mild-to-moderate bullous pemphigoid (BP) resulted in no drug-related adverse events and rapid reduction in BP Disease Area Index (BPDAI) score and blistering in ongoing Phase II clinical trialPivotal clinical trial for pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant-related thrombotic microangiopathy (HSCT-TMA) expected to start Q4 2019Initial data on atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) and pre-clinical back of the eye program to be presented at Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) 2019Long-term clinical study with Nomacopan (Coversin) continues to yield encouraging safety dataWith all that if you think they will burn cash with no investors then you are just ANOTHER FEARMONGER here who talks with no facts. How do you know they will burn cash in 2 quarters? Do you know their Burn rate? Have you seen their cash holdings? Revenue? do you know how much is their spend in terms of SG&A, expenses (salaries etc)?So, please share details based on facts and not just say someting.. your words matter and they affect people and opinions. Please be responsible. If I mentioned something which isnt write, I am sorry.. correct me!"
I was the only poster at this board before today. Now i feel like my home was occupied by strangers. Lol
it will naturally rise today with profit takers getting out and new buyers getting in
GAME OVER FOR THE SHORTS YOU LOSE
"shorts tried to walk it down not going to happen, next two days will explode upwards"
"Bought some at $4.30 pps, good luck to everyone!!!"
"Thinly Traded , FDA Fast Track , Huge Volume , This Can Go to $ 5.00 or $6.00 Fast."
Will come up no worries
This stock is a multiple day runner.
"Akari’s clinical trial sites are based in areas currently affected by the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the Phase I/II clinical trial in patients with AKC study has been halted and recruitment in the Phase III clinical trial in pediatric patients with HSCT-TMA has been and may continue to be delayed. Coronavirus is expected to affect Akari’s ability to complete recruitment in the original timeframes. The continued spread of COVID-19 globally, could adversely impact the Company’s operations and workforce, including research and clinical trials and the ability to raise capital, could affect the operations of key governmental agencies, such as the FDA, which may delay the development of the Company’s product candidates and could result in the inability of suppliers to deliver components or raw materials on a timely basis or at all, each of which in turn could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operation."
I got taken to the cleaners a few years ago on a arena pharmaceuticals stock that actually had their drug approved.. stock spiked up hard I was up over $100k in one day .. the next day it opened and started another hard run .. up another $30k then huge blocks of sell orders came in the stock crashed like $4 and gave back almost all my gains .. I skimmed 5 trades of Akari in the last hour today pulled $1400 profit and got out .. this thing will make a huge pull back tomorrow ..I’ve been trading pharma a long time .. it spiked to hard to fast
Why all this selling
Next week is the real presentation on Eye program. Expect super results too.Too much happening with this
"Very strange stock indeed. This is supposed to treat an orphan indication, and, a pediatric indication, and, it is thus far without a treatment. How can the FDA reject this drug if it has some efficacy? I am willing to put down some money I can afford to lose, accumulate some shares when the price is still low, and wait for a year."
Dr.Vincent Ho of the DFCI has a video discussing different compound options available for patients. He is on the onclive.com outlet and also has it streamed through a YouTube video dated Dec.23/19. GLTAhttps://www.onclive.com/
The norm is with this kind of volume second day double.That is what is I am seeing lately
Is it good to buy now? When do we get new results?
"""Purchase Agreement, the Company issued 30,000,000 ordinary shares to Aspire Capital and sold to Aspire Capital 25,000,000 ordinary shares for $0.02 per share (equivalent to $2.00 per ADS and $500,000"" who buys 3o million shares for 600,000 now its 6$ x 30 million"
Sleeper stocks move under the radar on low volume until a major catalyst brings attention to itThis is one such stock in my opinion
Anybody else buying under $2?
"Honestly have no idea if they can recruit enough people for phase III trials but there are some interesting reasons to take a flyer on this stock. They just did a private placement that included insiders, the valuation is about 10x lower than similarly situated stocks and some really smart money has bought in big (Aspire). Would be great if they can get a phase III trial fully recruited and have results by early next year."
"I'm with you @ Terry ----With Only a 9 Million Float , This Could Easily Go Up $1.00 to $2.00 After Hours with Continuation Tomorrow."
Time to fold em?
I like this stock. They are working on treatments for eye diseases that could end up being lucrative and helpful.
"These early positive results are why it's up? ""and are enthusiastic about the potential of Coversin to offer an improved standard of care for patients with these RARE and usually fatal conditions,"" CEO Richardson. I hope it works but from $1.50 to $9. This now has a $100mm mkt cap"
$5+ coming
"for those who missed selling at $3.00 , keep onto your holdings. 30million buyers are still there(maybe just one buyer?) and this little company is making progress towards its FDA approval. At $1.80 the risk of continued losing is minimal. Don't sell now!"
called it yesterday--check my posts....easily 12-15 today easy money!
My patience is wearing thin!!! This stock goes down everday! Looks like it is going to test 52 week low very soon......
Update today or nextweek?a couple more days and watch!!!
hold for $90 dollar jump :P
Dropping!!
BREAKOUT!!!!!Let’s go
"FDA Fast Track Designation is certainly good news, and the stock is obviously reacting positive to it, however, from my experience, it not any news where the stock will maintain its gains for a long period of time. So do with it what you will, but I would be taking profits early before the news wears off."
If this one holds the 2.70-80ish mark.. We can have a big day tomorrow as more ppl would want to buy and no shares available which increases the value tremendously... Supply & demand guys. If ppl start freaking out then it can be bad. I’m really hoping it holds today as we have a solid base on the 2.40ish mark.
Held up well in a tough market today. I thought for a few minutes there we might close in the green. Seems to want to move up. I am loaded and ready....
Guys fyi check out SINT... Only 2M shares outstanding and 400k float and just released great earnings... Huge if there is enought demand.
I guess we are waiting on secondary news?
Big updates coming up with significant unmet medical needs
looks like I'll be holding the bag for a while.
its been doing this all day it'll b up again
"August 13, 2020, 10:05 AM EDT In a report released today, Mayank Mamtani from B.Riley FBR reiterated a Buy rating on Akari Therapeutics (AKTX), with a price target of $5.00. Should be valued at $5 today."
Akari's trials are affected by covid so the increase in cases due to media race sensationalism fueled anarcho communist riots are going to depress sp temporarily.

"ok you can stop dropping now, I've seen enough."
Only 8 M float? Shorts will have hard time to find shares to cover?..........

Do not sell thinking it has reached its highest. If You were in with AMRN you know there is still a lot to run! 6$ it's just there! Just wait
"Not Only Is This a Low Floater , only 9 Million Float But The Drug Is Orphan Condition , Unmet Medical Need Drug."
"Been holding this since 2018, bought at 5.5, sold yesterday at 8.I wouldn't be surprised by current price action, a 50% retrace is common after a huge spike. This is ultimately still a downtrend, what's really important is the action over the next few months."
with the stock market crashing today see ascarycarymassive massive profit sellingdumpingback below $2 today beveryvery afraidtolossalotlot more moneyget what youcan now orget alotlot less then $2 sooon
"If you guys go to one year chart, this is a common pattern. Buy now because I don’t think it will go below 1.90 before solid uptrend. Akari is not a bad company going out of business bc they never had much bad news. I think now would be a great price and this stock could be up 40% in a week or two based on previous patterns"
This is a little sleeper stock hereand it’s fixing to wake up IMO
Like watching paint peel all day!
"Not that I'm looking for deep rooted financial advise here, but how can a company release positive news, positive outcome from a meeting, head on to Phase 3, be up 40% in the premarket...and just now go red on the day. I get that it'll take more work but seriously...negative on the day???"
Headed for brand new highs
