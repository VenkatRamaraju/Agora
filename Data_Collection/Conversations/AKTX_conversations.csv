If this one holds the 2.70-80ish mark.. We can have a big day tomorrow as more ppl would want to buy and no shares available which increases the value tremendously... Supply & demand guys. If ppl start freaking out then it can be bad. I’m really hoping it holds today as we have a solid base on the 2.40ish mark.
I didn't think I would get shares this cheap again lol - fundamentals haven't changed so its a pretty easy decision but would like to see the namocopan P3 interims to be sure which I thought would be out per the data disclosure blackout deadline for the EHA conference which was over at 830 CEST today (around midnight this morning in NA).
"Significant amount of trading this AM, over One Millions shares the first hour, way, way above average. Take Notice"
Here we go. Nomacopan being studied as a treatment for coronavirus. Let's get that PR. https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2020-001860-27/GB
"Dear Millionaires,Short squeeze set up "
I’ve seen this chart too many times to know it’s going back up.
I'm smelling MM. $100 sell orders down the line. Knocking off stop losses and then rising back up. This happened with nvax 3 times each time before great news and a massive jump.
"Luis, it is very interesting, 2 days this stock started moving up a little bit because the insiders had the information and started quietly buying,,,but the rest of us have to wait untill the news hits....but so is life......"
HUGE POTENTIAL GAINS TODAY IN SMALL CAP CANNABIS STOCK https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GTEH/2tjRQD6z-Put-GTEH-back-on-your-radar-Over-200pct-In-Upside-Potential/
It is very slow
Good call today!! We did!! Bravo for those who held till After Hour!! 
sell or hold??
34+ million traded yesterday = 4x the float and it goes up $1.3+million traded today and it’s down 0.75. Strange.
"open at 10 premarket tomorrow, and rally from there.Worth double digit giving market cap of 250-300M"
Dr.Vincent Ho of the DFCI has a video discussing different compound options available for patients. He is on the onclive.com outlet and also has it streamed through a YouTube video dated Dec.23/19. GLTAhttps://www.onclive.com/
The norm is with this kind of volume second day double.That is what is I am seeing lately
Will it break $8.00? 
"Very strange stock indeed. This is supposed to treat an orphan indication, and, a pediatric indication, and, it is thus far without a treatment. How can the FDA reject this drug if it has some efficacy? I am willing to put down some money I can afford to lose, accumulate some shares when the price is still low, and wait for a year."
"ALXN Soliris is first generation complement inhibitor.Coversin is second generation, and also dual action with Stem cellYet AKTX has two catalysts in Q1: Coversin in Atopic keratoconjunctivitis Phase 1/2 Bullous Pemphigoid Phase 2.Can someone provide a price target for this?"
I guess we are waiting on secondary news?
In my opinion if the news is good the response by institutions will have a few days lag just due to the stage this company is in right now. I think its going to take a few days for the institutional market to respond and start taking positions. Retail might take this up on its own but when the institutions start taking notice it should provide us with a nice base of support to hold the gains.
"sorry tot whoever lost on this, i missed the train and didnt want to jump in in fear of a fall, its only 1% shorted though so it could bounce back"
"""We are pleased that our company is now in the process of planning or undertaking pivotal trials in both BP and HSCT-TMA as well as progressing next clinical steps for studies in atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) and COVID-19 pneumonia,” Finally, the management made it public on their effort to fight COVID19"
There will be an eye program update too
For such news and for what will be the price now very low I will not be surprised if it reaches $ 10 today
I bought at 340 at 7 . omg
Nanocaps keep producing great day trading opportunities $ATOS $AKTX $VVPRDetailed video recap check here: https://youtu.be/JizTEESAhk4

"Not that I'm looking for deep rooted financial advise here, but how can a company release positive news, positive outcome from a meeting, head on to Phase 3, be up 40% in the premarket...and just now go red on the day. I get that it'll take more work but seriously...negative on the day???"
Now it's time for this baby to go up to 6 bucks
"I got so much problems of knowing when too sell and buy! I bought this when it was on 2.98 earlier today and didn't want to get gready so i sold it on 4.5 and was happy then i saw it keep going up so i decided to buy it on 5 and then it went down so i panicked and sold it on 4,65 and now i saw that it went up to 5.3 again -.- !! imagine if i didn't touch it from 2.98 the first time i bought it Anybody else who also buy and sell because they want to be ""careful"" but end up missing out ?"

Next Tuesday will be spectacular. That will be the day all margin calls need closed out.

Guys fyi check out SINT... Only 2M shares outstanding and 400k float and just released great earnings... Huge if there is enought demand.
volume is high. It will reach 5$ today again. Buy and sell and make .50 cents. Easy money.
Will this drive up with the approvals this week?
Finally get fast tracked and it’s down? Look for the spike up any day now.
Im content with 20-30% jump today. Not greedy. just a day trader
Why all this selling
Volume speaks for itself. Strong buy on the dip.
"pumpers, why do you think this is going anywhere today. lower lows and volume drying up. just day traders now."
Up tomorrow! Buy low!!!
I got taken to the cleaners a few years ago on a arena pharmaceuticals stock that actually had their drug approved.. stock spiked up hard I was up over $100k in one day .. the next day it opened and started another hard run .. up another $30k then huge blocks of sell orders came in the stock crashed like $4 and gave back almost all my gains .. I skimmed 5 trades of Akari in the last hour today pulled $1400 profit and got out .. this thing will make a huge pull back tomorrow ..I’ve been trading pharma a long time .. it spiked to hard to fast
It seems like the only reason is not over $4 or $5 by now is because SEC pauses the stocks to avoid going to $70 like BPTH. Let’s hope for $5 for now?!
"For the two Phase III trials, according to the filings at clinicaltrials.gov for HSCT-TMA they currently have one site open at Duke Medical Center and are targeting a completion date of November 2023. For BP, they do not have any sites open, and for part A are targeting a completion date of March 2023. So may not be much news in this stock for the next 18 months or so, unless they can find a partner for their eye programs."
"Dilution coming. Pivotal trial just starting on Q4, plus NDA, then PDUFA... see you in mid 2020."
The people who bought in today may want to stay for a short while. This thing is going to pop on Monday
No too many folks here.. Perhaps this recent news will draw folks back...
Headed to 8.50 in the next hour
Why did it go down???
This little Sleeper stock is about to be woken up
%100 up tomorrow? 
This is a good sign for the whole week with a positive start.
"I wish I knew then what I know now ...I used to have one of these original games when I was a kid...wish now I would have kept my Atari set in the box...breakout what my favorite game back thenOh...this isn’t Atari? My bad..well, I still play breakout today , with stocks"
Finish scaring all the cowards now up ahead There is no reason for the decline
"Soliris, eculizumab, anti C5, is effective in COVID19 treatmenthttps://www.whio.com/news/troy-respiratory-therapist-credits-clinical-trial-after-surviving-coronavirus/4DW5G3ZNT5FCJDU26DHFJZLPKA/?outputType=amp"
Is it good to buy now? When do we get new results?
Who needs to go to Spain to run with the bulls when I can run with them right hereBull Run begins
"ok you can stop dropping now, I've seen enough."
"Honestly have no idea if they can recruit enough people for phase III trials but there are some interesting reasons to take a flyer on this stock. They just did a private placement that included insiders, the valuation is about 10x lower than similarly situated stocks and some really smart money has bought in big (Aspire). Would be great if they can get a phase III trial fully recruited and have results by early next year."
"Just sole wild guess but tomorrow is going to drop hard. Take a look at the past with this company. They ran from 10 to 45 in a single day in 2015 August 19th. The next day keep running to 60, and droped to 20. Next week 10. Just saying. Save your profits"
Ok then what's up for tomorrow?
"More hedge funds and big guys will know about this during CC,A"
With the pr after the bell. Imo tommarow $5 close going into the presentation
"Hmm, somebody is buying up share dumpers on this dips..ht Stock..Any news coming o what?"
What’s going on new here!! Bought 2000 shares at 3.90 looks like this will be down for a short term but looking to ride it out
"Prediction: If it ends near $6 today, tomorrow gap up to $10. Please vote."
"I have 18,000 shares at 7.60"
Buy or not? Is it too late right now?
Up to 10?
"It appears that big jump at around 11:30am was from the news of orphan designation of nomacopan. It was probably a result of compute news driven trade. The real news we are all waiting for is nomacopan for COVID19 treatment, which should come out anytime soon."
Who has premium service to access this report by Argus for PT $128?
"Akari Therapeutics PLC shares AKTX, +11.92% soared 13% in premarket trade Friday, after the company said it has won U.S. Food and Drug Administration Orphan Drug Designation for nomacopan for the treatment of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (HSCT-TMA), a rare disorder. The designation comes after the FDA granted nomacopan Fast Track Designation, which means the regulator will accelerate the approval process. ""The granting of orphan drug designation and Fast Track designation by the FDA for nomacopan underscores the significant unmet medical need in this disease,"" said Clive Richardson, Akari chief executive, in a statement. Shares have gained 22.9% in 2019, while the S&P 500 SPX, +1.27% has gained 16.6%."
I was right when I get out premarket. Still was good run
"I'm with you @ Terry ----With Only a 9 Million Float , This Could Easily Go Up $1.00 to $2.00 After Hours with Continuation Tomorrow."
"This is what I think. AKTX is a high risk investment. But, it is so much better than a lottery ticket. It definitely has a chance for success. It may eventually develop a successful drug, or, another pharma company may buy its technology. At a market cap of merely $35M, for any kind of success, the reward will be huge."
Very risky to go in now with a potential sell off when the market opens. It also could just open a lot higher than it is now..
Update today or nextweek?a couple more days and watch!!!
This will be double digit in a few months
she's gonna heat up here this afternoon I think
Here is an article for the HSCT market size published two years ago. Tremendous opportunity for growth.https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hematopoietic-stem-cell-transplantation-hsct-market-to-reach-us3761-billion-by-2025-allogenic-transplants-to-emerge-as-most-valued-product-621594483.html
We have a bunch of catalysts in June and still no official covid announcement. This is just the beginning.
"AKTX Coversin can be as good as Soliris, multibillion dollar revenue potential.Only a matter of time before proper valuation is given to AKTX.How high can it go? becomes a question and also a problem"
she's got a lot more in her
"Finally, the company is doing something right for COVID19. It should work. The company is too shy to make an accouncement."
"August 13, 2020, 10:05 AM EDT In a report released today, Mayank Mamtani from B.Riley FBR reiterated a Buy rating on Akari Therapeutics (AKTX), with a price target of $5.00. Should be valued at $5 today."
GAME OVER FOR THE SHORTS YOU LOSE
$10 easy tomorrow
Sold $ATOS and $TNXP and got back in $AKTX. I couldn't resist the price drop. In #$%$75 average
They did this with BTRH and the stock went up higher and higher through out the day. Do not sell your stock.
Next week is the real presentation on Eye program. Expect super results too.Too much happening with this
I know its not a lot but I made 120$ in 3 minutes time. Bought 400 shares at 7.30 and sold at 7.70
"if you own several thousands shares, you would be considered a major stockholder I suppose"
"As I warned yesterday morning when this was breaking out, though receiving FDA Fast Track Designation is good news, its impact typically wears off quickly."
"Not Only Is This a Low Floater , only 9 Million Float But The Drug Is Orphan Condition , Unmet Medical Need Drug."
Going back up. All aboard the money train. Broke people wait on the tracks.
"Not like most of other nanocap pharms/med device stocks, $AKTX and $AVGR have real potential to go much higher. Larger, less upside but more solid are $AKBA and $GH."
Why is it up so much just with pre-IND meeting?
Best day I’ve had in a while. Got a chance to shake off some old losses. Good luck everyone!
Held up well in a tough market today. I thought for a few minutes there we might close in the green. Seems to want to move up. I am loaded and ready....
Man all day long cycling between +23.00 up to +33.00 on average. ALL DAY. Then in the last 7 or 8 minutes it's just PANIC. Clicking refresh repeatedly like 1 time per second and and every second seems to drop it 1 more percent. Watched it go from 23% to negative. I was like WOW. I lost a little but nothing huge. I'm sure others did not make it out alive though.
Where can I find the upcoming report on phase 3 data due today??? Please send link or something. Highly appriciated.
"Key date approaching, Still Time to Look at $AKTX - Here is the link http://crweworld.com/article/news-provided-by-globenewswire/253533/akari-therapeutics-to-report-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-financial-and-operational-results-and-host-conference-call-on-march-21-2018"
If 1.56 falls please put a stop loss at 1.34. If that support falls who knows where this will go
I can't find any news but I doubled my position over the weekend just to be safe.
Most interesting and important platform that cures devastating deceases.
Be careful. I've been here for 18 months. Last days Volume was 2000 - 3000 shares a day. It was not so easy to buy @1.70-1.80. Now I See that it could be one day pumping. Be careful. Take a look at the Volume now. More than 20 000 Times as the average. Be careful. I finished @$4.23. Enough for me for this moment.
No one was in this MB few days ago . Lmao
Whoa now! $AKTX is on a wild rollercoaster in PM! I’m staying out of it no matter what the cost until the market opens.
Nice pre-market
Was hoping to see the data this morning. It looks like the market agrees--flat to down.
"a BEAST on a bloody red day, continue higher tomorrow"
If market were not down so much AKTX should have easily up 200% today for this kind of information;Upgrade with target price $12!
I like this stock. They are working on treatments for eye diseases that could end up being lucrative and helpful.
"Akari’s clinical trial sites are based in areas currently affected by the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the Phase I/II clinical trial in patients with AKC study has been halted and recruitment in the Phase III clinical trial in pediatric patients with HSCT-TMA has been and may continue to be delayed. Coronavirus is expected to affect Akari’s ability to complete recruitment in the original timeframes. The continued spread of COVID-19 globally, could adversely impact the Company’s operations and workforce, including research and clinical trials and the ability to raise capital, could affect the operations of key governmental agencies, such as the FDA, which may delay the development of the Company’s product candidates and could result in the inability of suppliers to deliver components or raw materials on a timely basis or at all, each of which in turn could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operation."
And it is up 5% for no particular reason!
Multi day RUN! Let's see 9++
"With a strong close and up on a red day, tomorrow will be awesome."
I think this will get back up to 3.5-4 range soon (may be a month). Be patient!
"$AKTX I am so scared, I bought 2500 shares @ $7.50 .. not sure if this will go up or dip down !!"
this will run to $3 on Tuesday.
"I'm out, up $12,000 in 3 trades :)"
Anybody else buying under $2?
High volume though . Is either pump or dump or something is happening . I will wait
Dropping!!
How can anyone expect this to go up much furthers it’s already gone I’m up 220%??!!
Like watching paint peel all day!
Congrats to those who got in early on AKTX. Looking great. I had been watching this one for a little while. Trying to find a new high potential and found this On-Demand start up that seems to have a lot of potential http://billion.finance/OnDemand
Sold my position with a loss now it will rise !!! What a bad luck
I bought on the way up today--4k shares at $5.20......I am happy--this will test $12-15 tomorrow for sure
"Been holding this since 2018, bought at 5.5, sold yesterday at 8.I wouldn't be surprised by current price action, a 50% retrace is common after a huge spike. This is ultimately still a downtrend, what's really important is the action over the next few months."
it will naturally rise today with profit takers getting out and new buyers getting in
looks like I'll be holding the bag for a while.
Do not sell thinking it has reached its highest. If You were in with AMRN you know there is still a lot to run! 6$ it's just there! Just wait
the short squeeze is coming at around 18 million volume. it will be epic
I was the only poster at this board before today. Now i feel like my home was occupied by strangers. Lol
DRY POWDER FOR PHASE 3 RESULTS - miso hrny

"""Akari is actively pursuing several clinical study opportunities in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in the UK and U.S. The Company intends to provide additional detail when these programs are finalized and approved."""
I told you guys whenever it reaches 27M this one was foing to spike really fast!!
Big updates coming up with significant unmet medical needs
This is a little sleeper stock hereand it’s fixing to wake up IMO
"These early positive results are why it's up? ""and are enthusiastic about the potential of Coversin to offer an improved standard of care for patients with these RARE and usually fatal conditions,"" CEO Richardson. I hope it works but from $1.50 to $9. This now has a $100mm mkt cap"

interim phase 3 data will be out thursday or at the latest premarket on Friday - book it
Huge move in the premarket...it has been quite a while
This stock could be volatile like yestedsy due to 55% insider share holding. do pullbacks expectex but eventually it will reach higher than yesterday. last evening before close it hit 6 from 4.50.
Tomorrow will be over 10?......
up from now! lowest of the LOW!!!https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Akari-Therapeutics-AKTX-fall-into-the-bearish-side-of-the-market
Akari's trials are affected by covid so the increase in cases due to media race sensationalism fueled anarcho communist riots are going to depress sp temporarily.
Nothing crazy here on the earnings release after the bell. Minimized losses from prior year. Looking for positive momentum into the next week with eye presentation ahead.
"If you guys go to one year chart, this is a common pattern. Buy now because I don’t think it will go below 1.90 before solid uptrend. Akari is not a bad company going out of business bc they never had much bad news. I think now would be a great price and this stock could be up 40% in a week or two based on previous patterns"
longs what do u think how stock will react to financial results and all the potential stuff they have outlined
Guys fo check RSTV 467k OS and about to approved a drug worth 250M stock estimated to be at 35$ by next week

Just gonna hold this one overnight
"Thinly Traded , FDA Fast Track , Huge Volume , This Can Go to $ 5.00 or $6.00 Fast."
"There'd be absolutely No Harm if Akari was to Offer additional shares to institutional Investors, small company like Akari needs additional capital to continue their research until such time down the line as they become profitable."
Volume will pick up before lunch. Always does.
+15% after hours trading. Don’t see any news. Was something announced after market close?
Jump on NOW
I’m out
hold for $90 dollar jump :P
This ticker has a high potential to explode on Monday — I don’t own this ticker ~~
"6-K filed.Framework of trial agreed with FDA,Previous treatment of patience continues.New trials begin. Massive news"
Looks like we are going up until they give us some news. if you buy now you could double your money. I am playing it safe and only got 100 shares but seems good so
I read through the history of the M&A activity and how Akari came to be. Still going through the SEC filings and I need to do more DD ( safety and efficacy..) but I am interested in Nomacopan as it relates to the dual inhibitory capabilities and the progress of the trials plus the other FDA status the company has.
15$ easy to day
Should be an interesting week considering they announce Phase Three data on June 11th.
"ha ha ha.. there is a Mr. Big V and a Mr. Small v.. who do we trust... it is like a good cop and bad cop. One says the company will burn its cash and other says it will go upto 8-10 and then $20. Here is what they said in their earnings call: Treatment with Nomacopan (Coversin) in three patients with mild-to-moderate bullous pemphigoid (BP) resulted in no drug-related adverse events and rapid reduction in BP Disease Area Index (BPDAI) score and blistering in ongoing Phase II clinical trialPivotal clinical trial for pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant-related thrombotic microangiopathy (HSCT-TMA) expected to start Q4 2019Initial data on atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) and pre-clinical back of the eye program to be presented at Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) 2019Long-term clinical study with Nomacopan (Coversin) continues to yield encouraging safety dataWith all that if you think they will burn cash with no investors then you are just ANOTHER FEARMONGER here who talks with no facts. How do you know they will burn cash in 2 quarters? Do you know their Burn rate? Have you seen their cash holdings? Revenue? do you know how much is their spend in terms of SG&A, expenses (salaries etc)?So, please share details based on facts and not just say someting.. your words matter and they affect people and opinions. Please be responsible. If I mentioned something which isnt write, I am sorry.. correct me!"
Getting ready for a huge jump.

"for those who missed selling at $3.00 , keep onto your holdings. 30million buyers are still there(maybe just one buyer?) and this little company is making progress towards its FDA approval. At $1.80 the risk of continued losing is minimal. Don't sell now!"
$5+ coming
April 28- May 3rd is the Eye program updates and presentation.One of the more important ones !!!!
long
I don't know why people downvote sell posts or posts warning people about buying. Yes a stock can go to 20 when its at 9 but it can also fall to where it was before. If u are already up 50% or 100% its always after to sell at the peak and get back in when its starts moving up again.
"Great closing, hopefully will see 10 tomorrow."
Sold my position with a loss now it will rise !!!
based on what i read this will be above 6 tomorrow ......huge potential and can lead lot of areas
its been doing this all day it'll b up again
Headed for brand new highs
"It is an orphan phase 3 meeting all endpoints!!!!250M cap should be around the corner, representing a 5X potential here.If total pipes are included, will not be surprised to see 500M, or 10X.Of course there is always that possibility of dilution, 3X reasonable short term considering every thing.If a BO offer, can avoid dilution, and get more gains."
it give time over 3 soon
I need a stock that can make or lose me 100%+ ASAP
It's really wrong what you say after hours it goes down is a good sign it happens to be and those who can trade after hours try to lower a gate of something good that has the potential for upsets Don't get too excited after hours it doesn't mean anything
Sleeper stocks move under the radar on low volume until a major catalyst brings attention to itThis is one such stock in my opinion
I had bought today at 8:30 and now down to 6:40 .....huge loss versus celebrating great run on this
"AKTX has been a roller coaster over the past week. Congrats to all of those who made money on this one. Friday didn’t look great but it is looking primed for a bounce in the Premarket. I am going to keep watching this one and in the meantime I have been watching small cap stocks in hopes that I can find another runner before the run. One I have been watching lately is like Amazon Prime but they will get you anything you want even if it is not on the site. http://billion.finance/OnDemand"""
Just for proof. It is 11:13 PST and AKTX is at 7.62
"Will be a big runner today , FDA Fast Track Announced This Morning with Low Float, Many Shares Over 50 % Are Owned By Insiders."
"Bought some at $4.30 pps, good luck to everyone!!!"
called it yesterday--check my posts....easily 12-15 today easy money!
this is the best way for a stock to increase.....SLOWLY.....that way it stays under the radar and off the day-traders screens.....patience fellas....
Buy more so they can hire more board members
"shorts tried to walk it down not going to happen, next two days will explode upwards"
Only 8 M float? Shorts will have hard time to find shares to cover?..........

BREAKOUT!!!!!Let’s go
"FDA Fast Track Designation is certainly good news, and the stock is obviously reacting positive to it, however, from my experience, it not any news where the stock will maintain its gains for a long period of time. So do with it what you will, but I would be taking profits early before the news wears off."
Akari has an ongoing clinical trial in the UK to treat COVID-19 using Nomacopan (rVA576).https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2020-001860-27/GB
People saw value at 200/share back in 2013/Now people see value too. Not hard to understand
My patience is wearing thin!!! This stock goes down everday! Looks like it is going to test 52 week low very soon......
be patient and hope it will soon be 10 $ or higher
I'm out @ $5.60 made good money :) good luck!
This stock is a multiple day runner.
Held pretty strong at close
halting of stock scared all day traders and now it is not moving
New high is coming this week?
Time to fold em?
