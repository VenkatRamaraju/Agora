"Safe to say 95%+ of those owning CLB shares are down on their investment. CLB hasn't seen the share price @ $28 since 2008 and before that 2006. The sell off still seems fairly controlled, but capitulation might not be too far off at this point. Everyone has a pain threshold."

weather the Media likes it or not the world is starti g to open back up and oil is starting to be consumed at an ever climbing rate. So the Media will only be able to hold the world back in it's recovery a minimal amount of time. warmer weather is reaching more areas and the transfer of the condition does not fair well in heat because it can no longer sense a body by it's heat.

Strange that this is trending down and Motley Fool releases an article promoting the dividend? This happens a lot. I wonder what the payoff was to Motley Fool for them to release this article.

"As more and more people get on the road and the price of oil inches ever upward I wonder when the stocks will follow. Could it be that the Media is the true cause of the snails pace of the recovery. There gloom and doom on the economy has taken it,s TOLL on the economy and on the mind set of tje people. Yet the truth be known the Corona virus has taken a fraction of the lives of any flue virus in a season. I am not trying to down play the danger of the virus or the loss of life. The numbers do not support the blaring reality of the meaia. It seems they just want to sell their venue and to hell with the rest of the world because as long as they can scare people their money stays on the high end of the economy."

where is the break out it has only covered a forth of the drop so far.
well from reading the report the company has stream lined the company to make the most profit they can in adverse conditions and should come out of the pandemic a much stronger company.

"I bought this at $11ish so, this is a triple for me, but, I think it will double from here if the Democrats can start a new ME war, which looks likely by their corrupt and immoral political policies."
the high for the day is only20.78 and considering the losses of late that is pitiful.
