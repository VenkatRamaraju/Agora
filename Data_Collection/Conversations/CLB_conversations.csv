all the ups and downs and it ends up .06 for the day. Wow doesn't that excite you.
Bouncing all over the place with small trades...............
Overreacting. Buy it now!!!
there is no way this stock will hold a dollar gain today.
Should I sell this stock?Volume is low
Core Laboratories is up 13.09% to 14.69
is this drop justified??
keep your .04 cents and pay down debt!
Core Laboratories is up 14.00% to 19.30
Is there anyone out there? Stock is half of its price in one year. CNBC recently. Cramer is a joke and usually picks dogs. Down today. Where is this going?
why the big move in the past month?
Zacks equals SCAM
Core Laboratories is up 6.41% to 27.73
will be lucky to reach two hundred thousand in volume today.
"If we buy at low today, we can receive dividend. Not bad at this price, it will go back to $100 level in the future."
Core Laboratories is up 6.58% to 28.76
Why is this going up?
"seems to me the market has just made up its mind, and CLB is begining to come back... hehehe this is my personal opinion only"
Core Laboratories is up 5.78% to 26.52
Why does this continue to drop? Last Quarter wasn't bad. Big disconnect from the rest of the OFS sector who are moving upwards. Hoping it will turnaround just like it did April - June.
Still 17x LTM EV / EBITDA in a cyclical oilfield services industry. Record high multiple and still in bubble territory
Core Laboratories is up 15.93% to 26.63
weather the Media likes it or not the world is starti g to open back up and oil is starting to be consumed at an ever climbing rate. So the Media will only be able to hold the world back in it's recovery a minimal amount of time. warmer weather is reaching more areas and the transfer of the condition does not fair well in heat because it can no longer sense a body by it's heat.
Great stock
Core Laboratories is up 14.67% to 18.68
Core Laboratories is down 16.45% to 22.34
This will go too zero in some time. I used to work there. Management is disconnected from reality no matching 401k furloughed employees still and no foreseeable raises. This is a zombie company with bad fundamentals.
Looks like a great buy at these levels. Were at a 5 year low. Anyone buying?
Core Laboratories is up 13.99% to 17.68
Core Laboratories is up 15.00% to 20.78
Still trending down
well from reading the report the company has stream lined the company to make the most profit they can in adverse conditions and should come out of the pandemic a much stronger company.
this stock is butt sauce in a down trend before covid and soon to be in another downtrend
"Safe to say 95%+ of those owning CLB shares are down on their investment. CLB hasn't seen the share price @ $28 since 2008 and before that 2006. The sell off still seems fairly controlled, but capitulation might not be too far off at this point. Everyone has a pain threshold."
Worst stock the last few years!
Recon Africa was mentioned in the quarterly report. Go get some.
Well.........we had a healthy volume today.......... This should bounce nicely over the next weeks........... Oil will be king in 2020.
Core Laboratories reached a 52 Week low at 16.25
Down 17% YTD and still above 14x EBITDA with every other OFS company that has EBITDA trading in low single digits - can you say falling knife?
"Rise,"
