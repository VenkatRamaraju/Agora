why the big move in the past month?
Still trending down
Core Laboratories is up 5.78% to 26.52
Well.........we had a healthy volume today.......... This should bounce nicely over the next weeks........... Oil will be king in 2020.
Bouncing all over the place with small trades...............
Why does this continue to drop? Last Quarter wasn't bad. Big disconnect from the rest of the OFS sector who are moving upwards. Hoping it will turnaround just like it did April - June.
all the ups and downs and it ends up .06 for the day. Wow doesn't that excite you.
This will go too zero in some time. I used to work there. Management is disconnected from reality no matching 401k furloughed employees still and no foreseeable raises. This is a zombie company with bad fundamentals.
Core Laboratories is down 16.45% to 22.34
Looks like a great buy at these levels. Were at a 5 year low. Anyone buying?
well from reading the report the company has stream lined the company to make the most profit they can in adverse conditions and should come out of the pandemic a much stronger company.
Still 17x LTM EV / EBITDA in a cyclical oilfield services industry. Record high multiple and still in bubble territory
Is there anyone out there? Stock is half of its price in one year. CNBC recently. Cramer is a joke and usually picks dogs. Down today. Where is this going?
Down 17% YTD and still above 14x EBITDA with every other OFS company that has EBITDA trading in low single digits - can you say falling knife?
Zacks equals SCAM
"If we buy at low today, we can receive dividend. Not bad at this price, it will go back to $100 level in the future."
Should I sell this stock?Volume is low
"Safe to say 95%+ of those owning CLB shares are down on their investment. CLB hasn't seen the share price @ $28 since 2008 and before that 2006. The sell off still seems fairly controlled, but capitulation might not be too far off at this point. Everyone has a pain threshold."
"seems to me the market has just made up its mind, and CLB is begining to come back... hehehe this is my personal opinion only"
weather the Media likes it or not the world is starti g to open back up and oil is starting to be consumed at an ever climbing rate. So the Media will only be able to hold the world back in it's recovery a minimal amount of time. warmer weather is reaching more areas and the transfer of the condition does not fair well in heat because it can no longer sense a body by it's heat.
