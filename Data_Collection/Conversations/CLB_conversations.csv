It appears that it is trying to do s repeat of Friday.
"seems to me the market has just made up its mind, and CLB is begining to come back... hehehe this is my personal opinion only"
Bought back at 16.7
CLB is up 5.34% to 43.96
get your boots on because we are going mud diving again.
"Safe to say 95%+ of those owning CLB shares are down on their investment. CLB hasn't seen the share price @ $28 since 2008 and before that 2006. The sell off still seems fairly controlled, but capitulation might not be too far off at this point. Everyone has a pain threshold."
what is with the crash at the bell every day.
where is the bottom for core
keep your .04 cents and pay down debt!
CLB is down 12.37% to 11.44

"I bought this at $11ish so, this is a triple for me, but, I think it will double from here if the Democrats can start a new ME war, which looks likely by their corrupt and immoral political policies."
"how much is the dividend next quarter, per share?"
one would think that with this stock hitting 20.90 in the Friday session that 20.30 would not be a problem but this is a crazy market as it stands.
this is not a surge this is just trying to see daylight from the gutter.

Strange that this is trending down and Motley Fool releases an article promoting the dividend? This happens a lot. I wonder what the payoff was to Motley Fool for them to release this article.

"As more and more people get on the road and the price of oil inches ever upward I wonder when the stocks will follow. Could it be that the Media is the true cause of the snails pace of the recovery. There gloom and doom on the economy has taken it,s TOLL on the economy and on the mind set of tje people. Yet the truth be known the Corona virus has taken a fraction of the lives of any flue virus in a season. I am not trying to down play the danger of the virus or the loss of life. The numbers do not support the blaring reality of the meaia. It seems they just want to sell their venue and to hell with the rest of the world because as long as they can scare people their money stays on the high end of the economy."
Core Laboratories is up 8.49% to 19.94
weather the Media likes it or not the world is starti g to open back up and oil is starting to be consumed at an ever climbing rate. So the Media will only be able to hold the world back in it's recovery a minimal amount of time. warmer weather is reaching more areas and the transfer of the condition does not fair well in heat because it can no longer sense a body by it's heat.
Overreacting. Buy it now!!!
