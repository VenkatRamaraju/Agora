"As more and more people get on the road and the price of oil inches ever upward I wonder when the stocks will follow. Could it be that the Media is the true cause of the snails pace of the recovery. There gloom and doom on the economy has taken it,s TOLL on the economy and on the mind set of tje people. Yet the truth be known the Corona virus has taken a fraction of the lives of any flue virus in a season. I am not trying to down play the danger of the virus or the loss of life. The numbers do not support the blaring reality of the meaia. It seems they just want to sell their venue and to hell with the rest of the world because as long as they can scare people their money stays on the high end of the economy."

This stock is pitiful dropping before it even goes up to any thing respectable.
Why does this continue to drop? Last Quarter wasn't bad. Big disconnect from the rest of the OFS sector who are moving upwards. Hoping it will turnaround just like it did April - June.

"Safe to say 95%+ of those owning CLB shares are down on their investment. CLB hasn't seen the share price @ $28 since 2008 and before that 2006. The sell off still seems fairly controlled, but capitulation might not be too far off at this point. Everyone has a pain threshold."

Still trending down
weather the Media likes it or not the world is starti g to open back up and oil is starting to be consumed at an ever climbing rate. So the Media will only be able to hold the world back in it's recovery a minimal amount of time. warmer weather is reaching more areas and the transfer of the condition does not fair well in heat because it can no longer sense a body by it's heat.

This will go too zero in some time. I used to work there. Management is disconnected from reality no matching 401k furloughed employees still and no foreseeable raises. This is a zombie company with bad fundamentals.
