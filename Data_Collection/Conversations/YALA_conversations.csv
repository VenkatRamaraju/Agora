"Yalla has built and developed the best platform for social chatting, game streaming and paid subscriptions and services in the Gulf and MENA. It's the most popular application with millions of users. I live in the region and use it myself. This is not PR. Indeed, Yalla is a fast growing company with solid financial position and high income. It's an undervalued stock and will rebound soon."
Ohh! Today it has a high volume. Something unbelievable.
Yalla is up 6.93% to 6.94

going to 30 Got citron's blessings Citron Research@CitronResearch·16mChina’s leading audio-live streaming company is valued at just $400 mil. On 2021 EV/Sales $LIZI trades at 1.4x sales vs 17.2X Yala. $LIZI should benefit from de-platforming of big tech in China. In other words LIZI is valued at $7 per MAU vs $YALA at $221.

There is a fabulous amount of wealth in Dubai.
The one and only reason I should NOT have bought this is is b/c there is hardly any reliable source that provides good info. Which gives away my lack of DD. When I break even I'm out.
So woriied about this stock. Why they don't use their buy back.I am stuck here 18.90@ 1000
