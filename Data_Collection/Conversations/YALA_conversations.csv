"The numbers look great, but trying to wrap my head around the 'generous' share based comp expenses offsetting the great sales & earnings numbers. Thoughts???-$61M share based comp awarded in 2020 under the ""2018 plan"" --For context, sales were $134M in 2020-$76.8M worth of unrecognized share options still remain under the 2018 plan -The ""2020 plan"" allows for a max of 2.5M shares awarded (~$50M at todays prices)"
"YALA is a market leader. The stock should do fine.加入微信讨论群：To join the Chinese Investor Group, please add WeChat ID: ChinaInvestorGroup"
$22 incoming
25$ coming people
I think it’s going up
YALA is up 14.69% to 8.90
"This stock has wild moves, especially into the close"
"The amazing growth in revenue and average number of users is great news for YALA. External to the company, Mastercard's investment in Airtel Africa's mobile payment platform is proof that smart money sees value in Africa's emerging digital economy. Near term, it is hard to find anything to criticize here. Long term, it will be interesting to see what Yalla does with the mountain of cash they are sitting on."
Deal with Facebook is coming.

going to 30 Got citron's blessings Citron Research@CitronResearch·16mChina’s leading audio-live streaming company is valued at just $400 mil. On 2021 EV/Sales $LIZI trades at 1.4x sales vs 17.2X Yala. $LIZI should benefit from de-platforming of big tech in China. In other words LIZI is valued at $7 per MAU vs $YALA at $221.
Yalla is down 10.83% to 13.91
YALA reached an all time high at 30.20
Did anyone else see the short report Swan Street Research just published? It looks really bad.
This pullback opened up another great buying oppotunity
"drop more, so I can jump in"
humdalla habeebee lol what a joke
#sleeper 
"the volume today is massive, bad sign?"
"Give a rough guess, how many shares are going to be bought back using $150 million?The IPO was to raise $149 million at $7.5 a share. If $150 million was used to buy back, at twice of the price of IPO price, about half of the floating shares will be bought. What will be the stock price after buy back is done + the short squeeze?"
any news about the short article?
"I'm in, for some speculating. Enjoy everyone. : )"
YALA reached an all time high at 31.33
Buy this stock for long!!!
YALA could be ready to move. I also just got a tip about them from (http://webstock.today)
Predictions for open tomorrow?
I heard about YALA the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
I have used Yalla before . It is obviously a fraud based on my experience with using this app . Most of users are robots . Most of the chat group are ran by its staff . Yalla staffs begged user to buy present by playing some cute girls . Totally fraud
I think I will buy a few and see where it goes
Be on the lookout for a NH this is not on any radars but A+ accumulation by IBD Goodluck

"strong moves the last two days...MACD converging, CCI drifting up, good days ahead!"
Result will be published today after hours. Hoping to see gap up tomorrow morning.
"$ 9 seems to be the resistance level right now, if can break above that and hold it at close, stock should run up. But with eps due Monday after close, that's what will drive it. Good luck to longs.Steve E"
I'm buying at the $22.50 dips today my Habibis! 
This stock is so overlooked!!! $55 by the end of 2021!
lost 800 on this. #$%$ stock
Be careful lots of paid bashers in the room. Don’t sell your hand this is going up!!
"""Yalla Group Limited Responds to Short Attack Reports""Is the short Attack serious? Is there YALLA software user here?"
Dont buy this stock!!!
Popular middle eastern social media app. Should have bought more.
Nothing but selling selling selling and more selling !!!!
let’s get this to 21
Bullish Engulfing! I'm buying more
"Yalla Arabic language rooms are crowded, English rooms not much ppl. Come on this is the app for Middle East, why keep using English rooms as reference! It’s called localisation. Shorts are manipulating this stock! Hold tide it will back to its previous high"
In just before closing. Good luck guys!
it's going up!!!!!
Fake company
good luck longs on tomorrow mornings eps report!
We closed Friday below the previous days close. I hope we don’t see a drop at open
This Stock was 40 in February what happened???
"I bot a starter position at these levels, any thoughts on the next few weeks."
keep on falling.....
Look for upgrades soon
"Too pricy now, domestic stocks better"
Quite board. Keep it this way. I am in since IPO. Enjoy ride without pumper.
Feeling good
Still doing a lot better than BQ....
The problem with oversees on line sale platforms. You could never realy verify falsely sales figures / revenue as it is not mandatory locally.
"Yala charting very good now, based on indicators and volume action, looks like stock gonna break above 50 day moving average and make a run to 27 to 30 this move. Based on expected sales and eps growth, stock will have chance to start really good move now. Go longs!"
"What is up with the $10m loan that disappeared from the balance sheets according to that short report. If that happened, management really is nasty here. I'm out. This can go to $2."
How are those short positions working out for you? LOL!! Looks like buyers are coming in on the dips.
Bullish trend still intact
"I think it got a bit ahead of itself, I like this company and will buy @ $15-$15.50"
Out from Tech stocks to value stocks
"#6 stock in IBD50 this week, that is a good sign!"
"and more, so far grows almost 100% year over year"
"Yala share price goes up because of low float 16 mil. When its lockup expires, its 143 mil outstanding shares will be available to trade, causing the overbought shares to drop in price."
Yalla is up 10.30% to 13.60
Can i understand what is happening with this stock?
Hello there. The markets are shaky right now and a crash could be imminent. Do you know where to put your cash? go to (http://Pick-stocks.com).
Thanks yala
this one actually makes money and goes for about 10 times 2020 sales. not bad.
30-40 PT
I can see easily this stick over 30$ at the middle of 2021
Doing awesome!
Don't touch it
"Ok consolidation over and overhead pressure gone - lets run into 2021, put any and all into this for 2021 will be strong investment. Ibd gets things right just need to have time horizon and little patience to see big results A+ if you are an investor and not day trading for the short term"
YALA reached an all time high at 27.75
Earnings on March 15th before the open
"is this going to go up this week,, what do you guys reckon"
YALA reached an all time high at 20.16
leg up..
YALA is up 15.45% to 12.48
looking good. I think we have a winner here!
"management fraud, this goes to to $1"
My favourite stock
Back to 25 maybe???
Another broken IPO.
YALA is up 19.32% to 18.12
In 20S OUT 39S to volatile-will buy back on pullback.
"too fast , don't buy unless there is a pullback. It has doubled in a very short time"
Now that I’m watching and waiting for my buy point it will most likely double before I buy
Until the report came out I had high hopes for this company. Now it's crash and burn in flames. I agree with someone who said it's going to $1 and I'm not waiting around so I dumped it all yesterday. I should've dumped it Friday at $19 but oh well. Live and learn.
Oppenheimer upgrade YALA to outperform :)
Agora also powers a new audio social media app started in the Middle East called $YALA.
Read about the company
Buy afternoon sell around 10:00am. Is this a pattern?
You have no idea what goes inside this company
YALA is up 17.14% to 18.69
Yala’s action speaks louder. Hope I could get my money back at $23 in the next week.
Still patiently waiting to buy back at $14.50
Way over bought
why... why the never ending drop
YALA is up 5.30% to 6.95
"Anyone here? Seems a good revenue increases but negative EPS. In growing companies like this, EPS is not as important as revenue and increasing constumers. The fact is the market does not like the numbers... But in mid-long term I think are good numbers"
wow! what a move on this stock! kicking myself for selling under $30.
what is going on?
What happen to their buy back programe? Doesn't it work now?
"$WIMI $YALA Don't give up hope ,WIMI coming to rescure y'all."
"This is a good company, just buy and hold. I download their YALA app and there are many people in mid-east and north Africa also India and Pakistan. They are growing 9 times to pay customers about 5 million people, last year was 0.5 million pay customers."
"5 DAYS AGO, WHAT DID I SAID"
11$ looks imminent
Thus is a classic short scare. Same as Enphase a while back. Watch it rally to $30 once this is over. Already up 12% pre market on the $150m buy back share programme. Couldn’t be more bullish.
End of this month it’s gonna be 40$ watch
Would pick a little more on a dip under 34
Time to buy good pullback this am
YALA is up 19.24% to 22.18
Sold 31.50 small loss
W
It’s going down with 16mil shares a float there’s been a little over 5mil shares shorted since dec 2020 to date and 143mil market cap still to be released the set up is in play
New high.
"Long please be careful. Full disclosure, I have puts on YALA and am net short. So please take what I say how you like. I don't want you to lose money, but I can't seem to quantify any way that this company is not fraudulent. The numbers they've put out are too good for this industry. If they are doing so well, why are they not investing the 150m in growing this business and proving the shorts wrong? Buying shares and reducing the float is only going to pump the price short term. It does nothing to negate the short thesis. I am 100% happy to hear counter arguments. Since I have puts, losing money on this isn't a big deal. My exposure is tiny. So please feel free to provide your thoughts on why this should go up. But IMO, combining market weakness possibility, higher interest rates and their seemingly fraudulent business structure, the long term directionality seems down."
Why is this dropping so much. I bought in at 9 dollars n it keeps on dropping.
Over bought near term... Will wait for lower price at Sold 11.45
"Happy owner. The current situation is interesting, the hedge funds wanted to drive the FOMO, but people constantly sell due to the previous experience then they have to pump it twice. But still, slowly sell off..Faith, baby, have some faith"
Ohh! Today it has a high volume. Something unbelievable.
A little little more 30.40
So what's going on with Yala in after-hours today???
"This was not so smart thing to do for management. If they are serious and do spend $150 Million in stock buy back, they will be left with not enough cash to fund growth. The cash is the money they raised from investors while paying investment banks fees to raise it, to give it back to shareholders indicates to me management has panicked."
Nice move but what scares me is Wall St says it's overvalued and has a fair value of $4.50
wow
Great open today!!!SteveE
YALA reached an all time high at 32.31
Bought it @ $18.15 I think I screwed up
Anyone heard any news causing this uptrend.....I can't find anything......thx!
Decent liquidity.

I short sold this. Big mistake
If you’re still in $YALA use the bear flag happening right now to GET OUT!!
How high will it be?

Bought some back 36.90
"revenue and fourth quarter guidance miss expectations, their second largest revenue generating service (games) did better than expectation. Main reason why the fourth quarter guidance did not meet expectation was due to conservatism, and revenue growth of 90.4% was the median of its forecasts. Right now it is trading at about 7.3 * 2021 EV/Sales and only 0.47 * 2022 EV/Sales. Downside risk is limited for the current stock price and I like that risk/reward!"
Gapping up. Holding through $10
YALA will have a 1.2 trillion dollar market cap by Febuary 2022 give or take 100 billion. Period. JK. What is YALA anyway? I had to buy some YALA last week becuase my bot says that I have to and my bot has been training for years and is smarter than all of us.
Yala seems to poise for rebounding and starts rising from the major support level. Add a bit.
what's going on with yala?
I am buyer
Ipo today ? What time ?
any chance of 20 today????
we taking this uppppp
HOLD HOLD HOLD DO NOT SELL THIS WILL END IN THE 20s END OF DAY
Yala $14+ today
So woriied about this stock. Why they don't use their buy back.I am stuck here 18.90@ 1000
took a gamble an bought a few
Definitely buying!
I heard about YALA the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Does anyone know how many restricted shares will be float on Mar 29?
no not yet tomorrow one more time at its lowest 33. after that stay until 60s
First time is closed above the 50 DMA since April.
End of 2021 it’s gonna be 48$

Why is it down so much? Numbers on the earnings report are pretty impressive.

"My order is in between $6-$10 for 50,000 shares hopefully it doesn’t drop below $5"
Support at 17.70 !
buy the dip tomorrow
"wow, and to think, I was tempted to buy in when it was a little over $40."
YALA reached an all time high at 28.70
"I remember $SE before the hype. This stock reminds me of them, and I buy what they listed in their prospectus that entertainment options are limited in a lot of those OPEC Middle East countries where these guys have the majority of their users. Combine that with a population where the average age is under 30, and surprisingly resilient economies, and this one is a winner, and as it is already profitable, I am happy to jump onboard today."
$18 to $20 is a really good price to start a position for long term.
Fraud stock .. don’t buy
this is a buy!
"in fact, as a follow-up from my post three days ago, I think I may have to now buy some puts.....this stock is sick and broken. please don't base your trading on my opinions here - do your own DD.... it's your money and you worked hard for it - don't trust a stranger on a Yahoo Message board.good luck to all...rainking"
"* YALLA GROUP LIMITED ANNOUNCES UNAUDITED THIRD QUARTER 2020 FINANCIAL RESULTS* Q3 NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE $0.20 EXCLUDING ITEMS* Q3 LOSS PER SHARE $0.43* FOR Q4 OF 2020, CURRENTLY EXPECTS REVENUES TO BE BETWEEN US$35.0 MILLION AND US$36.0Positive results. Net loss due to IPO related one off spending. Stock price should go up. Don't understand why it is going down."
Green by end of day
YALA reached an all time high at 12.00
The one and only reason I should NOT have bought this is is b/c there is hardly any reliable source that provides good info. Which gives away my lack of DD. When I break even I'm out.
"Got a few shred of this back in December, definitely a happy camper now"
Be interesting to see if we can hold on to this support line or we could be seeing $18
How to prepare for leap jump.
"***MTVX ELECTRIC ATV's ELECTRIC SCOOTERS, & ELECTRIC GO KARTS, ELCR location is also in missouriAPPZ is next CLWD and FWDG to penny land, sooner than most can fathom."
Woohoo!
might fall to 9.75 range for re-entry
"Volume and price up, but no news..anyone know?"
This company has no debt and huge upswing potential!
Holding three hundred shares ..Yes down 20% ...I'm a long player and not worried. If it drops below 11.80 I'll add 30%...If you can afford to hold I find it usually works out.
this is unheard of amazing. I think this will explode 4b market cap underpriced at 29 a share. Dubai is a rich country. we are looking at the new Facebook of Dubai get ready
I see no news
"be careful out there, guys and gals...I've been doing this a long time. have made some money on YALA, but it's always a warning sign whenever a new (and growing, hopefully) company (didn't they just IPO late in 2020?) doesn't have anything better to spend their money on than share repurchases...""something smells rotten in Denmark"", peeps....rainking"
Any comment on the 3rd quarter results that were just announced?
Yalla is up 17.98% to 18.37
v good eps report and guidance. Hope upgrades next.
Smoke
This looks like a buying opportunity at 7.5..buying  today
Give us options & it might fly someday.trxc zi
The best stock. Just be patient at least for 7 months
Good News Yalla is projected to go up 42% this week!
"I just bought YALA today , hold it to double your money ! Short tries to manipulate the price for profits , some smart money will buy at this level ."
Couldn't resist picked up a little more 35S
YALA means LETS GO! In Arabic
Bought
wow... somebody knows something?rainking
There is a fabulous amount of wealth in Dubai.
"Worth $30, at least. YALA's sales are growing 99% year over year, and they are super profitable. Over the past year they netted $43million on $90million in sales, which translates to a net profit margin of 48%! YALA's profit margins are better than literally 99% of all other publicly traded companies. With 143million shares outstanding, at $7/share, this translates to a market cap of $1billion....translating to a price to earnings (PE) of 23 and a price to sales (P/S) of 11. That's dirt cheap. Won't stay down here for long. Check the financials for yourself by reading their F-1 statement filed with the SEC -- google ""yalla f1 amended"""
"read the Swan report, they done more research than I had. sold and will stay out for now."
Calling 15.35 as start of new run 12/29/20 11:20 am.
