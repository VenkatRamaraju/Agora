The problem with oversees on line sale platforms. You could never realy verify falsely sales figures / revenue as it is not mandatory locally.
Why is it down so much? Numbers on the earnings report are pretty impressive.
Looking forward to a strong first day of trading
"* YALLA GROUP LIMITED ANNOUNCES UNAUDITED THIRD QUARTER 2020 FINANCIAL RESULTS* Q3 NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE $0.20 EXCLUDING ITEMS* Q3 LOSS PER SHARE $0.43* FOR Q4 OF 2020, CURRENTLY EXPECTS REVENUES TO BE BETWEEN US$35.0 MILLION AND US$36.0Positive results. Net loss due to IPO related one off spending. Stock price should go up. Don't understand why it is going down."
Dont buy this stock!!!
will go to 40 by end of week
"My order is in between $6-$10 for 50,000 shares hopefully it doesn’t drop below $5"
How to prepare for leap jump.
lost 800 on this. #$%$ stock
The one and only reason I should NOT have bought this is is b/c there is hardly any reliable source that provides good info. Which gives away my lack of DD. When I break even I'm out.
what's going on with yala?
"The numbers look great, but trying to wrap my head around the 'generous' share based comp expenses offsetting the great sales & earnings numbers. Thoughts???-$61M share based comp awarded in 2020 under the ""2018 plan"" --For context, sales were $134M in 2020-$76.8M worth of unrecognized share options still remain under the 2018 plan -The ""2020 plan"" allows for a max of 2.5M shares awarded (~$50M at todays prices)"
Yalla is down 11.34% to 14.93
Buy buy buy when people scared I loaded 10000 shares
Just an app 
Anyone heard any news causing this uptrend.....I can't find anything......thx!
Bullish trend still intact
Did anyone else see the short report Swan Street Research just published? It looks really bad.
Yalla is down 10.83% to 13.91
What happen to their buy back programe? Doesn't it work now?
"This is a good company, just buy and hold. I download their YALA app and there are many people in mid-east and north Africa also India and Pakistan. They are growing 9 times to pay customers about 5 million people, last year was 0.5 million pay customers."
If you’re still in $YALA use the bear flag happening right now to GET OUT!!
took a gamble an bought a few
yala habibi
Coming to my $14.50 soon.
Yalla is up 10.30% to 13.60
it's going up!!!!!
going to 30 Got citron's blessings Citron Research@CitronResearch·16mChina’s leading audio-live streaming company is valued at just $400 mil. On 2021 EV/Sales $LIZI trades at 1.4x sales vs 17.2X Yala. $LIZI should benefit from de-platforming of big tech in China. In other words LIZI is valued at $7 per MAU vs $YALA at $221.
"revenue and fourth quarter guidance miss expectations, their second largest revenue generating service (games) did better than expectation. Main reason why the fourth quarter guidance did not meet expectation was due to conservatism, and revenue growth of 90.4% was the median of its forecasts. Right now it is trading at about 7.3 * 2021 EV/Sales and only 0.47 * 2022 EV/Sales. Downside risk is limited for the current stock price and I like that risk/reward!"
wow... somebody knows something?rainking
Thus is a classic short scare. Same as Enphase a while back. Watch it rally to $30 once this is over. Already up 12% pre market on the $150m buy back share programme. Couldn’t be more bullish.
Deal with Facebook is coming.
Yala $14+ today
"Worth $30, at least. YALA's sales are growing 99% year over year, and they are super profitable. Over the past year they netted $43million on $90million in sales, which translates to a net profit margin of 48%! YALA's profit margins are better than literally 99% of all other publicly traded companies. With 143million shares outstanding, at $7/share, this translates to a market cap of $1billion....translating to a price to earnings (PE) of 23 and a price to sales (P/S) of 11. That's dirt cheap. Won't stay down here for long. Check the financials for yourself by reading their F-1 statement filed with the SEC -- google ""yalla f1 amended"""
"is this going to go up this week,, what do you guys reckon"
"#6 stock in IBD50 this week, that is a good sign!"
Give us options & it might fly someday.trxc zi
"strong moves the last two days...MACD converging, CCI drifting up, good days ahead!"
"I think it got a bit ahead of itself, I like this company and will buy @ $15-$15.50"
This stock is so overlooked!!! $55 by the end of 2021!
nice!!!! volume is high!!!!
Holding three hundred shares ..Yes down 20% ...I'm a long player and not worried. If it drops below 11.80 I'll add 30%...If you can afford to hold I find it usually works out.
Quite board. Keep it this way. I am in since IPO. Enjoy ride without pumper.
$27 in no time. If passes we go $32 next
How many people we got here?
is earning bad?
30-40 PT
30 by Friday
Oppenheimer upgrade YALA to outperform :)
"I remember $SE before the hype. This stock reminds me of them, and I buy what they listed in their prospectus that entertainment options are limited in a lot of those OPEC Middle East countries where these guys have the majority of their users. Combine that with a population where the average age is under 30, and surprisingly resilient economies, and this one is a winner, and as it is already profitable, I am happy to jump onboard today."
Good News Yalla is projected to go up 42% this week!
"This stock has wild moves, especially into the close"
How high you think this will go?
"read the Swan report, they done more research than I had. sold and will stay out for now."
"This was not so smart thing to do for management. If they are serious and do spend $150 Million in stock buy back, they will be left with not enough cash to fund growth. The cash is the money they raised from investors while paying investment banks fees to raise it, to give it back to shareholders indicates to me management has panicked."
I am buyer
Until the report came out I had high hopes for this company. Now it's crash and burn in flames. I agree with someone who said it's going to $1 and I'm not waiting around so I dumped it all yesterday. I should've dumped it Friday at $19 but oh well. Live and learn.
Nice move but what scares me is Wall St says it's overvalued and has a fair value of $4.50
There is a fabulous amount of wealth in Dubai.
