let’s get this to 21
Time to buy good pullback this am
going to 30 Got citron's blessings Citron Research@CitronResearch·16mChina’s leading audio-live streaming company is valued at just $400 mil. On 2021 EV/Sales $LIZI trades at 1.4x sales vs 17.2X Yala. $LIZI should benefit from de-platforming of big tech in China. In other words LIZI is valued at $7 per MAU vs $YALA at $221.
YALA reached an all time high at 31.33
Yalla reached a 52 Week low at 6.26
Up we go
"My order is in between $6-$10 for 50,000 shares hopefully it doesn’t drop below $5"
Looking forward to a strong first day of trading
Couldn't resist picked up a little more 35S
will go to 40 by end of week
Coming to my $14.50 soon.
"strong moves the last two days...MACD converging, CCI drifting up, good days ahead!"
why... why the never ending drop
Out from Tech stocks to value stocks
Bought
In just before closing. Good luck guys!
So woriied about this stock. Why they don't use their buy back.I am stuck here 18.90@ 1000
we taking this uppppp
30-40 PT
The problem with oversees on line sale platforms. You could never realy verify falsely sales figures / revenue as it is not mandatory locally.
Anyone heard any news causing this uptrend.....I can't find anything......thx!
Why is it down so much? Numbers on the earnings report are pretty impressive.
This stock is so overlooked!!! $55 by the end of 2021!
"* YALLA GROUP LIMITED ANNOUNCES UNAUDITED THIRD QUARTER 2020 FINANCIAL RESULTS* Q3 NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE $0.20 EXCLUDING ITEMS* Q3 LOSS PER SHARE $0.43* FOR Q4 OF 2020, CURRENTLY EXPECTS REVENUES TO BE BETWEEN US$35.0 MILLION AND US$36.0Positive results. Net loss due to IPO related one off spending. Stock price should go up. Don't understand why it is going down."
Quite board. Keep it this way. I am in since IPO. Enjoy ride without pumper.
"be careful out there, guys and gals...I've been doing this a long time. have made some money on YALA, but it's always a warning sign whenever a new (and growing, hopefully) company (didn't they just IPO late in 2020?) doesn't have anything better to spend their money on than share repurchases...""something smells rotten in Denmark"", peeps....rainking"
Wow
"Anyone here? Seems a good revenue increases but negative EPS. In growing companies like this, EPS is not as important as revenue and increasing constumers. The fact is the market does not like the numbers... But in mid-long term I think are good numbers"
"Happy owner. The current situation is interesting, the hedge funds wanted to drive the FOMO, but people constantly sell due to the previous experience then they have to pump it twice. But still, slowly sell off..Faith, baby, have some faith"
"Ok consolidation over and overhead pressure gone - lets run into 2021, put any and all into this for 2021 will be strong investment. Ibd gets things right just need to have time horizon and little patience to see big results A+ if you are an investor and not day trading for the short term"
wow
good luck longs on tomorrow mornings eps report!
I heard about YALA the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
How high will it be?
Just an app 
wow... somebody knows something?rainking
"Long please be careful. Full disclosure, I have puts on YALA and am net short. So please take what I say how you like. I don't want you to lose money, but I can't seem to quantify any way that this company is not fraudulent. The numbers they've put out are too good for this industry. If they are doing so well, why are they not investing the 150m in growing this business and proving the shorts wrong? Buying shares and reducing the float is only going to pump the price short term. It does nothing to negate the short thesis. I am 100% happy to hear counter arguments. Since I have puts, losing money on this isn't a big deal. My exposure is tiny. So please feel free to provide your thoughts on why this should go up. But IMO, combining market weakness possibility, higher interest rates and their seemingly fraudulent business structure, the long term directionality seems down."
yala habibi
Predictions for open tomorrow?
It’s going down with 16mil shares a float there’s been a little over 5mil shares shorted since dec 2020 to date and 143mil market cap still to be released the set up is in play
took a gamble an bought a few
The one and only reason I should NOT have bought this is is b/c there is hardly any reliable source that provides good info. Which gives away my lack of DD. When I break even I'm out.
"What is up with the $10m loan that disappeared from the balance sheets according to that short report. If that happened, management really is nasty here. I'm out. This can go to $2."
Woohoo!
"$WIMI $YALA Don't give up hope ,WIMI coming to rescure y'all."
"in fact, as a follow-up from my post three days ago, I think I may have to now buy some puts.....this stock is sick and broken. please don't base your trading on my opinions here - do your own DD.... it's your money and you worked hard for it - don't trust a stranger on a Yahoo Message board.good luck to all...rainking"
Great open today!!!SteveE
"revenue and fourth quarter guidance miss expectations, their second largest revenue generating service (games) did better than expectation. Main reason why the fourth quarter guidance did not meet expectation was due to conservatism, and revenue growth of 90.4% was the median of its forecasts. Right now it is trading at about 7.3 * 2021 EV/Sales and only 0.47 * 2022 EV/Sales. Downside risk is limited for the current stock price and I like that risk/reward!"
This looks like a buying opportunity at 7.5..buying  today
"I remember $SE before the hype. This stock reminds me of them, and I buy what they listed in their prospectus that entertainment options are limited in a lot of those OPEC Middle East countries where these guys have the majority of their users. Combine that with a population where the average age is under 30, and surprisingly resilient economies, and this one is a winner, and as it is already profitable, I am happy to jump onboard today."
"Yalla Arabic language rooms are crowded, English rooms not much ppl. Come on this is the app for Middle East, why keep using English rooms as reference! It’s called localisation. Shorts are manipulating this stock! Hold tide it will back to its previous high"
Back to 25 maybe???
YALA is up 19.24% to 22.18
Agora also powers a new audio social media app started in the Middle East called $YALA.
"wow, and to think, I was tempted to buy in when it was a little over $40."
Yala’s action speaks louder. Hope I could get my money back at $23 in the next week.
Bullish trend still intact
End of this month it’s gonna be 40$ watch
"and more, so far grows almost 100% year over year"
looking good. I think we have a winner here!
Yalla is down 10.83% to 13.91
Yalla is up 6.93% to 6.94
Can we bellieve this high volume.They never had it before.
nice!!!! volume is high!!!!
Good News Yalla is projected to go up 42% this week!
$27 in no time. If passes we go $32 next
this is a buy!
Keep going!
it's going up!!!!!
"This is a good company, just buy and hold. I download their YALA app and there are many people in mid-east and north Africa also India and Pakistan. They are growing 9 times to pay customers about 5 million people, last year was 0.5 million pay customers."
Looks like it will be a great day !!!
30 by Friday
bought more today target 11.50
lost 800 on this. #$%$ stock
There is a fabulous amount of wealth in Dubai.
Ohh! Today it has a high volume. Something unbelievable.
"Yala charting very good now, based on indicators and volume action, looks like stock gonna break above 50 day moving average and make a run to 27 to 30 this move. Based on expected sales and eps growth, stock will have chance to start really good move now. Go longs!"
New high.
All their directors are Chinese!!
Does anyone know how many restricted shares will be float on Mar 29?
"The numbers look great, but trying to wrap my head around the 'generous' share based comp expenses offsetting the great sales & earnings numbers. Thoughts???-$61M share based comp awarded in 2020 under the ""2018 plan"" --For context, sales were $134M in 2020-$76.8M worth of unrecognized share options still remain under the 2018 plan -The ""2020 plan"" allows for a max of 2.5M shares awarded (~$50M at todays prices)"
"I think it got a bit ahead of itself, I like this company and will buy @ $15-$15.50"
You have no idea what goes inside this company
11$ looks imminent
How many people we got here?
"Got a few shred of this back in December, definitely a happy camper now"
Support at 17.70 !
"I just bought YALA today , hold it to double your money ! Short tries to manipulate the price for profits , some smart money will buy at this level ."
any news about the short article?
v good eps report and guidance. Hope upgrades next.
Buy this dip!!!
YALA could be ready to move. I also just got a tip about them from (http://webstock.today)
End of 2021 it’s gonna be 48$
Thus is a classic short scare. Same as Enphase a while back. Watch it rally to $30 once this is over. Already up 12% pre market on the $150m buy back share programme. Couldn’t be more bullish.
Definitely buying!
Dont buy this stock!!!
Ipo today ? What time ?
Would pick a little more on a dip under 34
25$ coming people
"This stock has wild moves, especially into the close"
"#6 stock in IBD50 this week, that is a good sign!"
Buy afternoon sell around 10:00am. Is this a pattern?
Nice move but what scares me is Wall St says it's overvalued and has a fair value of $4.50
YALA reached an all time high at 28.70
"Give a rough guess, how many shares are going to be bought back using $150 million?The IPO was to raise $149 million at $7.5 a share. If $150 million was used to buy back, at twice of the price of IPO price, about half of the floating shares will be bought. What will be the stock price after buy back is done + the short squeeze?"
am I the only one buying the dips here?
Yalla reached a 52 Week low at 6.75
"read the Swan report, they done more research than I had. sold and will stay out for now."
"$ 9 seems to be the resistance level right now, if can break above that and hold it at close, stock should run up. But with eps due Monday after close, that's what will drive it. Good luck to longs.Steve E"
Give us options & it might fly someday.trxc zi
Until the report came out I had high hopes for this company. Now it's crash and burn in flames. I agree with someone who said it's going to $1 and I'm not waiting around so I dumped it all yesterday. I should've dumped it Friday at $19 but oh well. Live and learn.
YALA reached an all time high at 18.77
"This was not so smart thing to do for management. If they are serious and do spend $150 Million in stock buy back, they will be left with not enough cash to fund growth. The cash is the money they raised from investors while paying investment banks fees to raise it, to give it back to shareholders indicates to me management has panicked."
Earnings on March 15th before the open
Deal with Facebook is coming.
Huge stock and options volume today! Something brewing...
Buy buy buy when people scared I loaded 10000 shares
Did anyone else see the short report Swan Street Research just published? It looks really bad.
What happen to their buy back programe? Doesn't it work now?
buy the dip tomorrow
Feeling good
This company has no debt and huge upswing potential!
I'm buying at the $22.50 dips today my Habibis! 
this is unheard of amazing. I think this will explode 4b market cap underpriced at 29 a share. Dubai is a rich country. we are looking at the new Facebook of Dubai get ready
Popular middle eastern social media app. Should have bought more.
Result will be published today after hours. Hoping to see gap up tomorrow morning.
"is this going to go up this week,, what do you guys reckon"
Now that I’m watching and waiting for my buy point it will most likely double before I buy
"Worth $30, at least. YALA's sales are growing 99% year over year, and they are super profitable. Over the past year they netted $43million on $90million in sales, which translates to a net profit margin of 48%! YALA's profit margins are better than literally 99% of all other publicly traded companies. With 143million shares outstanding, at $7/share, this translates to a market cap of $1billion....translating to a price to earnings (PE) of 23 and a price to sales (P/S) of 11. That's dirt cheap. Won't stay down here for long. Check the financials for yourself by reading their F-1 statement filed with the SEC -- google ""yalla f1 amended"""
YALA reached an all time high at 30.20
How high you think this will go?
I am buyer
If you’re still in $YALA use the bear flag happening right now to GET OUT!!
what's going on with yala?
YALA means LETS GO! In Arabic
LONG BABY
"Yalla has built and developed the best platform for social chatting, game streaming and paid subscriptions and services in the Gulf and MENA. It's the most popular application with millions of users. I live in the region and use it myself. This is not PR. Indeed, Yalla is a fast growing company with solid financial position and high income. It's an undervalued stock and will rebound soon."
Oppenheimer upgrade YALA to outperform :)
What Happened it was 40 not to long ago
