buy kroger beat earnings
BC CEO was on Cramer's Mad Money Friday night. Boat business continues strong and people are being hired to replenish falling inventories. Stock repurchase plan recently initiated. Stock looks cheap--paticularly if Thor (another outdoor leisure company) has a strong earnings report on Monday.
"Can anyone give some serious rationale why this stock is down 12.5 % for the past month after having earnings.In the meantime over the same timeframe the S&P up 8%, the Russell 2K up 5.5%, Polaris up 7.4%, LCI industries down 0.3%, Yeti up 9%, I think this is oversold and overlooked."
I am a partner @ the hometown Mercury dealer in fond-du-lac Wisconsin Mr. Marine Inc.. Ths factory is working around-the-clock to deliver product not magicians can't work with what you don't have..Go Mercury . I liked the product so much I bought a dealership..
"It's summertime. Everybody is out at the lake, not trading equities. Dramatic price changes on trades of 100 shares are not news. Go outside, maybe take the boat out. Nothing to see here until Q2 earnings at the end of July."
This will be one of the best stocks ever soon Big growth potential 
"Earnings summary: $1.0B in rev, 40% growth YOY, EPS of $2.57, 77.2% growth YOY. These are absolutely staggering numbers. I guess one could consider this growth temporary as the RV boom wanes, but I highly doubt that is the case for a couple reasons: A) there is a cohort of boomers who are retiring, some retiring early, to enjoy life and travel, but don't want to fly or cruise with Covid-19 still around, so are buying RVs to see the country (like my parents). B) young families (like mine) are camping and RVing as the new normal trip, vacation or long weekend C) people who live on lakes or on the coast are never going to stop buying boats, whether Chris Craft or Barletta. You could say the same about $BC as a cheap, wise investment right now.Furthermore, as I said earlier, Winnebago is eating Thor's lunch. Literally taking market share with better quality products, better business decisions and better finances. While $THO was issuing new notes to raise capital, $WGO was boosting dividend by 50% and approving $200M buyback. I mean, if that's not financial strength, I'm not sure what is.This takes our current PE to 8.46 and our future PE to 7.27 assuming 25% growth next quarter. Every quarter we set new records while the stock treads water because people are too busy chasing unprofitable technology to the moon.I've said this before. We've suffered various downgrades on the great outdoors and related products. I think these are way overdue for a huge rally when people realize these activities and sports are here to stay. $ASO $DKS $PII $HMC $VSTO $BC $WGO $THO $CWH $LCII"
"I rage-deleted all my YF posts during one of the recent market selloffs, but I'm coming here second to start over. $WGO is my favorite holding, but it has underperformed this year. I'm not sure why. I suspect people think the RV boon is over and everyone is going back to cruising tomorrow, or the next day, or the next day, which still hasn't happened. 30% of the US isn't vaccinated. A grand total of ZERO American kids under 12 are vaccinated.But none of that really matters, because families have picked up new hobbies and vacations over the last year. They rented and purchased RVs, boats, ATVs, golf clubs and other outdoor sports. I've RVed with my kids for almost 10 years. I have neighbors and friends coming up to ask how we like it, how to tow, where we go, etc. This isn't a dying fad. It's the new norm. $THO just blew out estimates and cited increasing demand, but then offered stock which shows why Winnie is a significantly better investment IMO. Plus WInne has diversification with Chris Craft and Barletta Pontoons. Plus Winnie makes a better product than Jayco. And on the back of most boats is a Mercury thanks to $BC. $PII $CWH $HZOSupply chain issues for all of these companies may exist, but will abate. People aren't going to stop buying toys for their lake properties or camping trips. In fact, every time we've bought an RV, we've wanted the next size/step up. We went from pop up to hybrid to travel trailer. So people are basically lifelong customers."
"You can't sell what you don't have. I am in the process of buying a motor for my boat. I ordered a Suzuki last October, and it has still not been delivered. I have called all over the country, and the only motors I can find are Mercury with the command thrust that few want to pay extra for. Boats are sitting at US factories because they can't get resins to finish the hulls. From what I am. hearing from dealers, and Suzuki, it's a supply issue. My guess is that the manufacturers don't want to pay the increased shipping fees the cargo companies are charging, so they are holding back inventory. It's going to be a bummer Summer for a lot of boaters."
Brunswick reached an all time high at 90.70
"WeedMD@WeedMD·Feb 26To our buds packing our buds – tx! Kudos to our teams that capped off a landmark week, filling our largest retail orders to-date w, shipments to #ON, #QC, #BC, #AB. That’s 11 transport trucks w, freshly packed @ColorCannabis_ @saturdaycanna headed to your fave retailers."
Been invested in Brunswick for a few short months and already have a 32 percent gain. I owned this company several years earlier too before selling out of it for a loss. Having better luck this time around. Big short squeeze taking place today. I love the smell of freshly squeezed shorts in the morning. Delicious.
"I'll post one more summary for anyone surfing around or considering these names. Investors have written off recreational products as dead. Most of these trade in the low teens or single digits, which is a serious discount to the market. Comps may be tough, but business is still booming. Consumers have records amount of savings to spend in the next year. Supply chain problems are working themselves out. Backlogs will take two to three years just to restock to historical levels. With some of these stocks, simple PE expansion to the normal ratios mean they would almost double.I would even lump outdoor products like $JOUT and $VSTO and autos like $F and $GM in here too. Totally unloved and poised for huge upside in the next 12 months.$WGO $THO $BC $PII $HOG $LCII $PATK $MBUU $MCFT $HMC"
earnings before or after bell?
this is buying opportunity with prices targets of 115-125 . Take advantage of this short sell off. Their earnings were excellent and end of year results will be outstanding.
Blow out earnings beat. Strong guidance. This stock is going higher.

This is one of the best stocks in the world to short if you think a slowdown or recession is a possibility.
"You can't sell what you don't have. Outboards are in short supply with no dates for arrival being given by the outboard companies. This is a mess, again, this year."
Went to bass pro in New Hampshire yesterday to buy a boat. They had 6 boats left normally they have over 50 all have Mercury engines on them.
