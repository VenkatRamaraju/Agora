"Has anyone else noticed that under the new Tax Bill, the tax deduction for interest is limited to 30% of EBITDA?This means that for RYI at EBITDA of say $180 million in 2018 the tax rate on profits will rise to nearly 50% or higher at lower levels of EBITDA!!Also the new Tax Bill will give rise to a tax charge of $16 million in Q4 2017 on overseas earnings thus wiping out 2017 meager profits!!"

This baby might be in play. Last week the only analyst following the stock bumped his 2021 EPS estimate to 5.60 and revenue estimate for 2021 to $5.8 billion. Current market cap at 25 a share is still under 1 billion. Stock could easily fetch high 30s bid from a suitor in a takeover. JMO.
