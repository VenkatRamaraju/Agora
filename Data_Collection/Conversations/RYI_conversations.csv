I Think were going back up earnings are getting better and hope by Thanksgiving were at new Highs $ 20.00
RYI is down 5.36% to 8.12
"if we assume they will match q1 earnings for the rest of the year, then a 48 millions of net profit for the year will translate to a eps of 1.30. And with PE multiple of 15, the stock is valued at 19.50..this is an amazing investing opportunity.."
Anyone know of any news causing this to drop like this the past few days?? Another round of tariff talks?? I have been watching this for awhile and can never seem to pull the trigger.

"Unlikely to be a takeoff here, way too much debt and underfunded pension. RS would never touch them. Only hope would be another silly hedge fund or a Chinese company that wanted to move money in US."

Many Mergers going on before Interest Rates start going up RYI should look to be part of a bigger picture If someone in Steel industry offer you $15.00 to $ 20.00 Take it Cash or take Stock deal. Stock deal is good you get other companies stock and dividends. Look into it.

This baby might be in play. Last week the only analyst following the stock bumped his 2021 EPS estimate to 5.60 and revenue estimate for 2021 to $5.8 billion. Current market cap at 25 a share is still under 1 billion. Stock could easily fetch high 30s bid from a suitor in a takeover. JMO.

"Has anyone else noticed that under the new Tax Bill, the tax deduction for interest is limited to 30% of EBITDA?This means that for RYI at EBITDA of say $180 million in 2018 the tax rate on profits will rise to nearly 50% or higher at lower levels of EBITDA!!Also the new Tax Bill will give rise to a tax charge of $16 million in Q4 2017 on overseas earnings thus wiping out 2017 meager profits!!"

If we are to go off the RSI then you could argue that a pull back next day or so could occur on RYI before rallying up. Do you guys find it difficult to know when to buy or sell something? I prefer to get my stocks from https://newawesomestocks.blogspot.com/.
