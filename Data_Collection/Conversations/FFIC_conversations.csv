"amazon is now talking TWO additional HQ sites! Queens/Flushing Meadows and Crystal City, VA. Go baby go!"
"Way to go NY politicos. Amazon is going to build TWO massive home base facilities at Cristal City, VA. They were looking at a site near Flushing but couldn't come to terms with near-sighted pompous NY politicians. YOU REALLY BLEW IT."
