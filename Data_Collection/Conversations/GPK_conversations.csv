wondering why it's down
Great Q. Will be recognized eventually.
"International Paper connection....I must be thick but I don't really understand the IP/GPK realtionship. Check out p.51 of the Annual Report which has a nice graphic showing the organization of the company. IP owns a % of ""Graphic Packaging International Partners"" which it has been selling off. When they've finally divested all of it to GPK, how will this affect the bottom line? IP can convert this to cash or GPK common stock. I can't locate any current news about the supposed latest transaction except for misleading headlines. Any ideas? thanks."
Looks like the old bait and fake to steal sum cheap shares for the shorts game. I have a buy order in at 18.80 and it's not been filled. Brokerage House's are helping the shorts cover. Just my humble opinion of course!

Stock being controlled and accumulated in low 16s by a master. Should be $18-22 after a great Q.
Sleeping Beauty appears to be waking up....
"Aha! Now even I can understand the ""deal."" IP gets 22.8 Million GPK shares for its interest in Graphic Packaging International. This is 8% dilutive. The analysis that still eludes me is whether the dollar amount which GPK now earns on the entire ""Graphic Packaging International"" segment rather than sharing it with IP makes up for this dilution. The company didn't mention this."
"GPK a great buying opportunity.SKIN, another great buy.TSLA at 800 times earnings is frightening!Where is the SEC, in allowing Elon, to behave worse thana nine year old child."

"Average down to $14.30 per share. Not sure if people are aware or not, but this is a crucial business. As a previous process engineer at the battle creek site, I saw how many name brands use their corrugated board, it is unbelievable just how many companies rely on GPK for their packaging. This is a very strong position to hold and average down when it dips. Think about the long term.....that and the fact that they are building a state-of-the-art paper machine in Kalamazoo that will be able to produce 2000 tons of corrugated board!"
"GPI just dumped all pension obligations to Life Insurance companies during the biggest financial crisis in history. On top of that they chose and AIG company AGL. Jog your memory. AIG was the pin in the grenade that caused the 2008 crisis as they had a boatload of credit default swaps that went belly up and could not pay off Goldman Sachs. What a completely tone deaf move at this time. What assets support the Annunity that they bought to fund these pensions? Stocks, commercial real estate, auto loans, all sorts of ultra complex derivatives?? How do you think those assets are doing right now? I can tell you. They are all tanking and most are currently being supported by the Fed. On behalf of thousands or retired Gpi employees -----What are you guys thinking? Obviously not much."

"I’m impressed with their paper based product that could replace much of current styrofome meat packaging coupled with current environmental movement to reduce use of plastic packaging. See https://www.graphicpkg.com/products/paperseal-slice-tray/I’m impressed with their investment in people, technology and customer collaboration. I did not realize GPI provides machinery to automate the customers packing processes. So not only are they selling the packaging but also the machinery for the customer to improve customers’ packaging process and reduce customers cost. https://www.graphicpkg.com/product-category/machinery-systems/These news releases provide more insight on GPI’s initiatives to help industry transition from plastic to paper https://www.graphicpkg.com/news/"

Sales improved 4% year over year driven by acquisitions and net organic sales growth of 1.5%, which was partially offset by a decline in open market paperboard sales. The recession resistant nature of our business was quite apparent during the quarter ..."" - CEO Michael Doss."
