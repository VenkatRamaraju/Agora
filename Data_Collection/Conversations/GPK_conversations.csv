"Down -10% AH, but no news. Odd."
Could we have worse news than this:Graphic Packaging Holding (NYSE:GPK) reported quarterly earnings of $0.26 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $0.22 by 18.18 percent. This is a 30 percent increase over earnings of $0.20 per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $1.70 billion which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $1.64 billion by 3.54 percent. This is a 7.33 percent increase over sales of $1.58 billion the same period last year.
"""We delivered excellent performance in the second quarter as the Company adapted to changing demand patterns resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic. Sales improved 4% year over year driven by acquisitions and net organic sales growth of 1.5%, which was partially offset by a decline in open market paperboard sales. The recession resistant nature of our business was quite apparent during the quarter ..."" - CEO Michael Doss."
"Aha! Now even I can understand the ""deal."" IP gets 22.8 Million GPK shares for its interest in Graphic Packaging International. This is 8% dilutive. The analysis that still eludes me is whether the dollar amount which GPK now earns on the entire ""Graphic Packaging International"" segment rather than sharing it with IP makes up for this dilution. The company didn't mention this."

"International Paper connection....I must be thick but I don't really understand the IP/GPK realtionship. Check out p.51 of the Annual Report which has a nice graphic showing the organization of the company. IP owns a % of ""Graphic Packaging International Partners"" which it has been selling off. When they've finally divested all of it to GPK, how will this affect the bottom line? IP can convert this to cash or GPK common stock. I can't locate any current news about the supposed latest transaction except for misleading headlines. Any ideas? thanks."

"Peter Goss Family Trust, adding to their GPK,position significantly as per CJ Goss."
"Average down to $14.30 per share. Not sure if people are aware or not, but this is a crucial business. As a previous process engineer at the battle creek site, I saw how many name brands use their corrugated board, it is unbelievable just how many companies rely on GPK for their packaging. This is a very strong position to hold and average down when it dips. Think about the long term.....that and the fact that they are building a state-of-the-art paper machine in Kalamazoo that will be able to produce 2000 tons of corrugated board!"
International Paper finally getting out. Great thing. Just will be rocky this week.
three upgrades and this stock barely moves. If it was a tech stock it would be up 10.00
"This is a great buy, Most stores are sold out of cereal boxes and GPK makes most of these for Kellogg Corp. Production is at full capacity at most GPK plants"
"I’m impressed with their paper based product that could replace much of current styrofome meat packaging coupled with current environmental movement to reduce use of plastic packaging. See https://www.graphicpkg.com/products/paperseal-slice-tray/I’m impressed with their investment in people, technology and customer collaboration. I did not realize GPI provides machinery to automate the customers packing processes. So not only are they selling the packaging but also the machinery for the customer to improve customers’ packaging process and reduce customers cost. https://www.graphicpkg.com/product-category/machinery-systems/These news releases provide more insight on GPI’s initiatives to help industry transition from plastic to paper https://www.graphicpkg.com/news/"

"Crazy day. Very smart strategic deal announced, which should have catapulted the share price. Massive footprint for growing sector. And, it's like someone holds it back, seeking to pounce later I presume."
Looks like the old bait and fake to steal sum cheap shares for the shorts game. I have a buy order in at 18.80 and it's not been filled. Brokerage House's are helping the shorts cover. Just my humble opinion of course!
"The Stock Trader Journal, has GPK, as a topGrowth Stock as per Ron Porterfield."
"A big player must have dumped, earnings were what most of us expected. that was a totally unexpected sell off for me. I doubled down"
