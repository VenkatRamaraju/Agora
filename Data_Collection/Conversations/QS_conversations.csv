QS is already at cell phone battery production level but JS said focus is bigger market of EVs.
Adding to my 100k shares today
They had some interesting insights about QS on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Sam Jaffe with Cairn Energy Resources is very influential EV analyst Save the Date: Join our CTO and co-founder Tim Holme, alongside Venkat Viswanathan and @samjaffe, for their upcoming webinar ""Lithium Iron Phosphate + Lithium-Metal Anode"" on Thursday, Sept. 9th at 10 a.m. PT. Agenda and streaming details coming soon.https://twitter.com/QuantumScapeCo/status/1430244075920310273My opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape"
"QuantumScape’s CEO Jagdeep Singh has said no other competitor has released as much data on their progress as they have, while trying to protect their parents.I agree as when was the last time you heard and news from Toyota , CATL , Samsung or Solid Power on their solid state battery progress. It’s been crickets!"
I Think 10 layers should be enough for QS to offer this to samsung and apple!
"Huge money to go into QS,waiting for confirmation that it has taken the lead -Oct Nov."
"New to this stock and board. Just in at 20.50 after reading about VW's investment re EV in WSJ. Consider this a speculative position, about 2% of my total invested in equities. Don't plan to trade, just hold long term until bust or big payday. Prepared to lose all, but it it hits figure at least X10 payback with 5 year horizon. Any opinions...?"
This reminds me of Tesla when it was in the 30s. Patience will be rewarded on this gem.
https://www.quantumscape.com/blog/temperature-in-battery-development/
"QuantumScape (NYSE:QS) CEO Jagdeep Singh posts a positive update on Twitter.""Encouraging early 10-layer cell cycling results – now at 200 cycles with >96% capacity retention at 1C/1C and 25 degC, generally in line with what we’ve seen for our single- and four-layer cells,"" read the new tweet.The company also filed an SEC Form 8-K to memorialize the update."
Good to see buying volume coming in I just added more
Quantum will have last laugh against Scorpion hedge fund. Wait till next news release.
I heard about QS the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Only QS provided test results for their SSB technology to the public. None from Solid Power, Samsung or Toyota. They kept everything secret. Only QS offer test results coming to the public."

Buying more now
QS is making great progress and is ahead of schedule. It does NOT make sense that the stock is keep going down.
Positive Third-party results will be out soon.
Thought the shorts would have been done with qs by now..they definitely accomplished their mission...looks like they are greedy and relentless S..O..B's
Hopefully closed above $22 today
"QuantumScape has created a positive and creative workplace with state of the art resources for their highly talented and growing workforce .

50-60% more downside is coming. I don't see any reason to buy this at all.
"Great interview with a Caltech Professor on New Battery Technology. You get to understand why young people like Ms See entered this field. ""I saw the climate crisis and the issues that we have with our energy infrastructure. That’s why I ended up going to grad school: I saw chemistry as a way to help solve these problems"" https://www.pasadenanow.com/main/ask-a-caltech-expert-assistant-professor-of-chemistry-kimberly-see-on-new-battery-technology/"
"Nice to see QS trying to hold on to the $22 level. I feel like it's been building up towards a re-testing of the $23 to $24 level. Last week's flirtation with mid $22 ($22.54 was the week's high) triggered a massive selloff, driving the share price down to upper $20. But after all that bloodletting, investors have started loading up again, and I expect there to be a fairly good chance that it will test $23 by Thursday or Friday of this week, if not tomorrow (Weds)."
DO NOT SELL
QS Looks like running today!!
"GM may need a new E-battery. Here is GM's thought regarding LG, [GM} ""will keep its Orion Assembly plant idled and not start repairs on the nearly 141,000 recalled Chevrolet Bolts EVs and EUVs until it is confident its supplier can make a defect-free EV battery that does not pose a potential fire risk.And right now, GM does not believe its battery-maker, LG Chem, can do that.GM and LG Chem have ""hundreds of people"" working around the clock, seven days a week, to find the cause of the defective battery modules connected to some Bolts catching fire without impact, said GM spokesman Dan Flores."
"QS all the way up, let's GO!"
there is some rumor on the social media about Apple and QS. is there is any truth to that?

"I Trust the expertsThe hardest part about making a working solid-state battery is the need to simultaneously meet the requirements of high energy density (1,000 Wh/L), fast charge (i.e., high current density), long cycle life (greater than 800 cycles), and wide temperature-range operation. This data shows QuantumScape’s cells meet all of these requirements, something that has never before been reported. If QuantumScape can get this technology into mass production, it holds the potential to transform the industry.—Dr. Stan Whittingham, co-inventor of the lithium-ion battery and winner of the 2019 Nobel prize in chemistryThese results blow away what was previously thought to be possible in a solid-state battery. Supporting high enough current density to enable fast charge without forming dendrites has long been a holy grail of the industry. This data shows the capability to charge to 80% capacity in 15 minutes, corresponding to an astonishingly high rate of lithium deposition of up to a micron per minute.—Venkat Viswanathan, battery expert and professor of materials science at Carnegie-Mellon Universityhttps://www.greencarcongress.com/2020/12/20201209-qs.html"
Anyone can tell me next step after 10 layers succeed QS would try 20 layers ? End of year or 30 layers
"The Hindenburg disaster caused the abrupt end of airship travel making way for passenger airplanes as a safer form of flight.Passenger flight was in its infancy during the 1930’s and we are now at the dawn of the EV era. As the Hindenburg caused the move to passenger flight the recent Lit-Ion battery recalls due to potential fires will be the catalyst to move to SSB. Public anxiety will pressure OEM’s to move to solid state battery that offer a safer alternative. Indeed the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued a statement earlier this year “ that electric vehicle fires pose a threat to first responders and that vehicle manufacturers have distributed inadequate guidance to mitigate safety risks”Investors need to carefully look at who the believe is the leader in bring a revolutionary solid state battery to the market. There are numerous reasons why I believe QuantumScape is that company.They have world class founders in Tim Holme and Jagdeep Singh who has a history of success in other fields. Nobel prize winner Stanley Whittingham and co- inventor of the Lithium Ion Battery commented on their data last year” Holds the power to transform the industry”Tesla Co- founder JB Straubel described the results “a major breakthrough”Venkat Vidwannathan, a battery expert and professor of material science at Carnegie -Mellon University commented “ These results blow away what was previously thought to be possible in solid-state battery.They have a production dream team in Celina Mikolajczak who was also at Tesla and Clayton Patch.Investors should do their own research and due diligence but these are my reasons for investing in QuantumScape.My opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape."
QS is a solid company whether you like it or not. Whether you a shorter or a longer. Whether you believe in SSD or not. If you don't like QS you can just go away and post somewhere else. We the longer will be here and we are willing to ride the share up or down!
"Ups and downs don't really mean much at the moment. Just traders pushing the price around. We are waiting for latest testing news, possible 3d party review, OEM interest, VW action. So many possible catalysts. Makes you feel sorry for poor old bears who are holding weak cards."
"Bought a few more shares today at the nice price of $19.61. I think there is a good chance we'll see a rally on Monday, maybe to just shy of $21."

Samsung's lab SSB is not useful with such high Temp and Pressure.SolidPower's 0.3 mAh/cm2 seems too small to be used, and its Pressure is not exposed;The pressure used in QS test is little bit higher than the required 1 atm. However Tim Holme did say ""we have even shown promising results from prototype cells operating with no externally applied pressure at all""."

Too many shorts thumb down on long's posts. Shorts must be nervous.
"Just like in the western movies;Quantumscape is out with its guns drawn and challenging ssb players to come out in The open and show what u got Just like in the Wester movies other players are hiding in the salons behind the table with heads down in fearLast week qs fired few shots at sold power. And sold power went quite , now it looks like their merger might not go through Today qs challenged them to show their battery test under real world temperature conditions,again heads are down behind the tables hiding hoping qs will go awayEven Big Gangster Toyota not coming out with any infoSeems like they all got nothing in ssb technology Looks like there is new cowboy in town and he’s asking for transparency I’m guessing these ssb players will come out slowly with their arms dangling heads down and with no weapons and Will accept defeatThat’s when the fireworks will startQs will pass 2000 fairly quickly hold your share as long as u canAny thoughts?"
If a multi-billion $ company like Volkswagen have piled into this company I don't think it's a dodgy company. Be patient. Don't buy shares in this unless you're holding for at least 5 years

"Our 4-layer cells have now surpassed 800 cycles with >90% energy retention under uncompromised test conditions: 1C-1C, 25°C, 100% DoD, 3.4 atm — exceeding the energy retention spec of 800 cycles to >80% & achieving a major 2021 milestone Tim Holme (CTO) said “The four layer demonstrates everything working together because you’ll have cathodes in on some layers and anodes in on other layers. So all of the elements of the repeat units are here and to scale up to more multi layers you just stack these four layer cells on top of each other.”This may actually be the most important achievement yet. 800 cycle data was not completed before.

"QuantumScape's revolutionary SSB technology will become front and center to OEM's with the potential to power the move to mass adoption of EV'sReducing expensive recalls and having to advise customers not to park their EV in the garage because of battery fires, priceless!Oh! not to mention energy density, mileage range, better battery life, faster charging times, and a safer exprience.My opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape."
Has anyone ever seen solid state battery test results from other battery makers except only fromQS? Looks like only QS is publishing testing results to the public.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1277460The EV Lit-Ion fire issue is getting too much attention in the press to be ignored. OEM management teams must be heavily focused on a longer term battery solution.In my opinion all roads points towards solid state battery technology for that long term solution.And the leader in that field is QuantumScape.Onwards to 3rd party and commercial 10 layer testing releases.. QS-0 production and QS-1My opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape.
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Multistockalerts.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!

"It is easy to create an EV and go ipo or through spac but it is very hard to come up with battery technology especially solid state battery technology. All these EV companies cannot all have very high valuations. The battery is the center of an EV. If QS is successful, stock will surely rise to very high market cap. Can't understand all these new car EV companies are in such high valuations. It just doesn't make any logic. If you add up all these EV makers, the valuations is out of reality even for entire auto industry. Tesla will crash back down to $50 billion market cap. Mark this post."
"Those claiming production will never happen, is this because Apple and VW have terrible production lines and can’t do it? If this product is a success obv. Apple or VW will make a play ASAP. Maybe even Tesla in a last ditch effort. Why is production even being considered? If this battery works they will have all the options in the world."

"https://electrek.co/2021/02/12/cause-of-lg-battery-fires-rumored-to-be-found/As the article states if dendrites are the problem – ""it’s a major one"" Through 100' of thousands of tests QuantumScape has publicly stated their proprietary separator has solved the dendrite issue!https://www.quantumscape.com/technology/faqs/Q: What exactly is different about QuantumScape's separator material?A: The QuantumScape separator material is a ceramic capable of meeting the key requirements of high conductivity, stability to lithium metal, resistance to dendrite formation, and low interfacial impedance. These are the key requirements to make a lithium-metal anode, which in turn enables high energy density, fast charge, and long life. The ceramic itself is non-combustible, making it safer than conventional polymer separators, which are hydrocarbons and so can burn. The formulation of QuantumScape’s material is proprietary, but it uses earth abundant materials with a continuous-flow manufacturing process, which we believe will make it cost-effective at commercial volumes."

Click here to find out more »Batteryalengo/E+ via Getty ImagesGround-breaking solution to a new problemQuantumScape was founded in 2010 by Jagdeep Singh and a legion of scientists from Berkeley and Stanford. The team set out to make a stronger, safer, and more reusable, solid-state battery than the ones that are used today. Since the early 90's manufacturers have been relying on the Lithium-Ion battery. The processes of the battery can be explained very simply. Here's a quote from the Department of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to explain.Source: (How Does a Lithium-Ion Battery Look?)A lithium-Ion battery is made up of an anode, cathode, separator, electrolyte, and two current collectors (positive and negative). The anode and cathode store the lithium. The electrolyte carries positively charged lithium ions from the anode to the cathode and vice versa through the separator. The movement of the lithium ions creates free electrons in the anode which creates a charge at the positive current collector. The electrical current then flows from the current collector through a device being powered (cell phone, computer, etc.) to the negative current collector. The separator blocks the flow of electrons inside the battery.Source: (Energy.Gov: How do Lithium-Ion Batteries Work?)This battery has been used to fuel technological advances like smartphones, laptops, TV remotes, high resolution cameras, and the electric vehicle. The lithium-ion battery has propelled society to new heights as technology is always advancing. It can be argued that this battery has quite a few downsides to it. The battery is highly sensitive to high temperatures which is why batteries can tend to overheat, if the battery 'dies' after 2 or 3 years the battery can no longer be recharged, if the separator becomes damaged the battery becomes unfixable, not to mention the massive climate footprint involved in manufacturing and installing this battery. This is where QuantumScape comes in. The team there has created the next generation of solid-state battery technology.Introducing the Lithium-Metal BatteryThe lithium-metal battery aims to fix problems with the previous generation of batteries and more. QuantumScape's flagship QS-0 takes inspiration from the Lithium-Ion battery and switches 2 out of the 4 keystone pieces within the battery.Source: (QuantumScape October 2020 Analyst Presentation)By switching out the silicon anode for lithium metal and the liquid electrolyte for catholyte QuantumScape believes that this will improve power and charging times. The team has created a cell packed, durable battery, resistant against high temperatures, that can cycle the lithium metal throughout the battery safely and efficiently. This model of battery if proven to work can create billions of dollars in savings for corporations and the consumer. This is because they will not have to waste money on replacing and recharging older less efficient batteries. The potential the company has to advance the proliferation of electric vehicles is unmatched. The fact of the matter is if the battery model holds true every major car manufacturer, major technology company, and industrial conglomerate will be crowding QuantumScape for potential licenses to their patents. In fact, the company alone has over 200+ patents for their state-of-the-art battery technology that can be used by major car manufacturers. QuantumScape will be creating 200,000 cells in a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for electric test vehicles in 2022. if that test is successful and shows meaningful results the stock could realistically double from today's 10 billion market cap due to the sheer amount of institutional investment interest the company would receive.QuantumScape's growing technological advantageThis battery is powerful. When I say powerful I mean POWERFUL. This chart from QuantumScape's own earnings presentation shows numerically how far ahead of the curve they are.Source: (Quan"
"Even QS co-founder Tim Holme is not very confident about its ceramic separator.

"Did QuantumScape Just Solve a 40-Year-Old Battery Problem?Posting this great article from last year. It’s amazing how much progress QuantumScape has made in testing of 4 layer and now 10 layer since that was published on single cel below.“QuantumScape’s performance data is impressive, but it comes with an important caveat. All of the test data was generated in individual cells that, technically speaking, aren’t complete batteries. The thin cell unveiled by QuantumScape is destined to be stacked together with about 100 others to form a full cell that is about the size of a deck of cards.

"Still crickets from QuantumScape's major competitors. In this interview with Solid Power's CEO he admits QS has achieved something beyond what they have in solid state battery technology. I wish them luck but besides the SPAC announcement in June nothing? https://seekingalpha.com/article/4442109-exclusive-interview-with-solid-power-ceo-doug-campbell#commentsQuantumScape’s CEO Jagdeep Singh has said no other competitor has released as much data on their progress as they have, while trying to protect their patents.I agree as when was the last time you heard and news from Toyota , CATL , Samsung or Solid Power on their solid state battery progress. It’s been crickets!My opnion and why I invested in QuantumScape."
"The futur of EV will depend on safety of the battery. SSB is safety first!Fire safety is a must and enhanced safety is one of the two most-often-touted advantages of solid state battery SSB. Fire safety of indoor car parks, where electric vehicles are not only parked, but also charged need answers from a fire prevention and repression point of view. In the futur car parks may differentiate between electrical vehicles with fire safe batteries. Building regulations will need to be adjusted to increase fire safety in indoor car parks and reduce residual risks. SSB will reduce the risk and reduce the cost to adjust the fire safety costs for car parks.I believe QS is on track ;-)"

In my opinion there may be 3 super negative poster types on this forum.1. Have a stake in competing companies /technologies2. Paid shorts with multiple id’s3. Believe in QuantumScape’s technology but pushing to get the price lowerMy opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape.
Longs are going to reap a rich harvest. Shorts are going to burn in fiscal hell. Or something like that. :-)
Qs is heavily manipulated. Price has gone down too much in a short span of time. It will rock anytime. Either via a short-squeeze or any positive development of its battery. I'm long until I see its battery out in the market.
"80% is goal and 4 layer 90%+ and ceramic characteristic mean we may have 1000’s cycle before degrade. Most important part is reliability and who want to save 10-20 bucks and deliver inferior product.All those silicon based batteries might run big problem with reliability and inconsistencies due to its characteristic.We know density growth in current batteries reaching limit, silicon is problematic, sulfide is problematic. Only holy grail exist is here. It will bring lot better future to us. Short can control and think we long retail will eventually give up but if they try cover it will take it back to 50’s easily."
"The lithium Ion battery was a great invention allowing for a mobile workforce and electric vehicles . However most experts believe it has reached it potential and solid state batteries are the future of EV’s. Companies like GM cannot risk their EV their brand and credibility on a lithium Ion battery platform.As more EV’s worldwide are put on the road the risk of fires will increase and recalls eat in profit.The recent recalls are hitting their bottom line and god forbid their is loss of life and law suits.This is not an acceptable option for well established brands like GM, VW, Ford, Toyota etc . They are going to invest in a battery platform that is much safer and that is SSB.Based on QuantumScape’s and the Korea Herald article sulfide based solid state battery technology will probably not be the one they choose for the reasons QuantumScape and the Korea Article outlined below. Specifically any fire risk .Sulfides don’t prevent dendrite formation and require external systems to maintain high temperatures and pressures, adding weight, bulk, and, most importantly, cost to the battery pack.Sulfides break down chemically when used in high-performance batteries.Sulfides produce hazardous gas when they come into contact with moisture.https://www.quantumscape.com/blog/the-problem-with-sulfides/https://www.google.com/amp/m.koreaherald.com/amp/view.php%3fud=20210803000641My opinion and why I’m invested in QuantumScape."

"I think the first catalyst will be the release of 3rd-party test results. I would expect that for some time between end of September and October.Next then is Q3 report in November with update on 10-layer cell testing and progress on QS-0.Then towards the end of the year announcement of site where QS-1 will be built together with VW.Other catalysts could happen at any time in-between, e.g.:- large institutional investor announcing investment in QS- new OEM (other than VW) announcing partnership with QS- new analyst coverage and higher price target- US government grants- QS hiring some famous personnel/manager/board member- random push from apes- ..."
I'm not selling no matter how low it goes. If quantumscape was a scam then why did Fisher have to pay a fine to qs for patent infringement and destroy all their data and prototypes. Before the suit Fisher claimed to have a revolutionary ssb that would make evs better than ice vehicles. So qs has the tech just needs time for implementation
Hope all the battery maker work together with QS .They all will make huge profit
Time to buy
Good News is coming out soon Great Opportunity
"Glad I bought on the dip (low $19) last week. I also went out farther in time with some call options (Nov 19 expiry). Last week, I bought the Nov $30 calls just as a kind of placeholder. Today, I cashed those out at a profit and applied the proceeds to purchasing same-date $25 calls. The $25s were a much better value, and the odds are better that QS will reach or exceed $25 than the odds of it reaching or exceeding $30 in the next 12 weeks. Even so, I think there is a very good chance that QS will re-test the low $30s again before the next earnings release."
Shorts are in frenzy. They have at most a couple of months before their shrill rants will ne left behind. Mute them and look for valid discussions.

"18% short interest down from 20%. 17 to 18 % is still pretty high. But shorts are starting to cover. September is tomorrow. October is only 30 days away. Interim 10 layer results will be released. If good or similar to 4 layer tests then stock should double easily. Perhaps as high as $60 to $75 again. Just hold on tight and don't let shorts take your shares away from you. Hold tight. And also some analysts are starting to pitch to investors to buy added products for the EV market and not the auto makers. This way it's easier to make your profits and be able to measure future revenues. Battery stocks are better places to invest besides the automakers. Tesla is really way too expensive. Once other makers catches up, Tesla will fall back down to earth. This is why Tesla is trying to branch out into selling energy back to the grid using their storage batteries."
"To beat Tesla, Mr. Schmall says, it isn’t enough to catch up. VW needs a silver bullet that will allow it to leapfrog the Silicon Valley company and take the lead in technology.The company hopes it has one in QuantumScape Corp. , a startup that VW first invested in about 10 years ago.!Love it QS the silver bullet . Volkswagen must be be very impressed with QuantumScape’s results to start their first foray into EV battery manufacturing."
"Who's Making Those EV Batteries That Are Catching on Fire?https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-08-24/who-s-making-those-ev-batteries-catching-fire""Too few analysts and investors are asking basic questions about battery technology, manufacturing quality, or the rationale behind the choice of partners. Even after its expensive recall, Hyundai announced in July it again was partnering with LG Energy Solutions to build a $1.1 billion plant in Indonesia — one of the largest producers of nickel, a raw material — to “secure a stable supply of battery cells.” These are important signals to assess battery capacity as EV demand continues to grow. In reality, though, it’s worth wondering how “secure” these products really are"""

Looks like Gm would be a customer of QS
rumor flying QS has the best tech after the Fisker news. release that 3rd party data and this baby will have CNBC screaming buy lmao
Qs will move to 27 in 5 days
High level of secrecy of proprietary information has an impact on the share price. That said I believe that QS shares lots of their battery data. If I remember well Stanford StorageX initiative directors prof. William Chueh and prof. Yi Cui also were very pleased with the symposium (30 July 2021) of Tim Holme and the great extend of details he shared.QS SSB is moving forward at Warp Speed. In only af few months they moved on from 30x30 cell to a 10 layer 70mm x 85mm. This progress is amazing. I'm exited to ride this out till I become a happy owner of a VW EV with an amazing fireproof QS SSB.Science is a great! For this gamechanger strong hands are a must.

Anyone can tell me the difference between lucid battery and QS battery?
"It is almost September. You can smell the stink of fear on shorts more and more manic posting frenzy. 4th quarter is when I expect testing to show validity of the process. At which time funds wade in, OEMs begin to negotiate before they are left out, VW provides more financing and oh yes, stock begins a rise to at least double by end of year. If at any time, the shorts panic, as they should, and begin to sell en masse to avoid being crushed, the price spikes to previous highs. But that will only be the start as a meteoric rise in 2022 will begin. Again, this only starts if they prove out their concept, but so far so good!"
"Q: What exactly is different about QuantumScape's separator material?A: The QuantumScape separator material is a ceramic capable of meeting the key requirements of high conductivity, stability to lithium metal, resistance to dendrite formation, and low interfacial impedance. These are the key requirements to make a lithium-metal anode, which in turn enables high energy density, fast charge, and long life. The ceramic itself is non-combustible, making it safer than conventional polymer separators, which are hydrocarbons and so can burn. The formulation of QuantumScape’s material is proprietary, but it uses earth abundant materials with a continuous-flow manufacturing process, which we believe will make it cost-effective at commercial volumes.https://www.quantumscape.com/technology/faqs/"

Investor behavior can be strange. QS has exceeded all the promises and there has been no proven negative facts published. Yet the price is going down. Bought 1000 shares at 22. Will be happy to increase of it goes further down.

"Rivian has been evaluated 80B USD for the ipo without one product sold. Tesla, one of the most shorted companies in the past, has a market value of over 730B USD. For years, it was claimed that Tesla is overvalued and it will drop, yet it went 10x and stayed at those levels. Boomers are not only able to evaluate the companies of the future, but also today’s companies. QS is far beyond the comprehension of outdated hedge funds and shorts. The company owns a technology which can revolutionize the battery technology in a world which every product is batterized from cars to vacuum cleaners and some Einsteins here say QS is overvalued because it has no revenue. It’s a joke. You can either be one of the persons saying “I wish I had invested 1000 $ in Tesla five years ago” or you don’t miss that opportunity today. I personally took this risk and invested heavily in QS with the dream of an early retirement. In my opinion, QS is one of those companies that everyone will wish to have invested in the future while it is ~20 bucks."
I am going to be a multi-millionaire by 2027 thanks to QS! So thank you in advance. This will be $200+ by then.

Only QS solved the battery problem . SSB!!!!
"￼Still Here, Despite the CriticismYou’ve got to hand it to QuantumScape. Even in the face of stinging criticism from Scorpion Capital, the company is still here and as bold as ever.The company’s latest investor presentation offers a handful of statistics to remind the naysayers that QuantumScape is here to stay: • Founded in 2010 (the company’s not a flash in the pan) • Around $2 billion of capital investment • More than 400 employees (this isn’t some back-office operation) • Over 200 patents and patent applications (intellectual property can be highly profitable) • QuantumScape’s batteries enable a fast charge in less than 15 minute fast charge (0% to 80%)Furthermore, here’s a tidbit from QuantumScape’s second-quarter 2021 shareholder letter: this company is far from broke/insolvent.In fact, the company ended the second quarter with over $1.5 billion in liquidity. Moreover, QuantumScape expects to start 2022 with more than $1.3 billion in liquidity.Batteries to Power the FutureThere will also be some folks who assume that QuantumScape isn’t earning any income at all. That’s actually not the case. For the three months ending on June 30, 2021, QuantumScape generated net income of nearly $81 million.So, while the company did struggle with a net loss a year ago, that’s certainly not what’s happening today.Yet, that wasn’t necessarily the most intriguing aspect of QuantumScape’s shareholder letter. There’s a possible breakthrough afoot, it seems, as QuantumScape had made, and is currently testing, the company’s first 10-layer cells.Apparently, QuantumScape had previously set a goal of showing results from 10-layer battery cells by the end of 2021.Hence, it’s encouraging to see that the company is already announcing its first 10-layer cells, perhaps ahead of schedule. Obviously, the introduction of 10-layer cells would represent a quantum leap over the four-layer cells for which QuantumScape produced test results in February.Patience is advised, as it appears that this will be an ongoing, multi-year process:“We will seek to continue to improve the performance of the 10-layer cells through the rest of 2021 … [and] demonstrate several dozen layers in 2022 and produce test cells for vehicles on our QS-0 pre-pilot production line in 2023.”14 STOCK PICKS FOR THE $12 TRILLION 5G REVOLUTION￼The TakeawayAs always, patience and forward-thinking vision will be key to success as a QS stock investor. Don’t expect to see immediate results from QuantumScape’s battery technology. Innovation is a process, and it takes time to develop.Granted, there are people who will continue to criticize QuantumScape, and they’ll point out the risks of owning shares in the company. The risks are duly noted. However, if you’re willing to hold on to a moderately sized position in QS stock long enough, the returns could be considerable"
GM and Hyundai having to recall several thousand EV cars for batteries that are catching fire. Buy or accumulate QS.
Today it will hit 24
The best gains are made by buying early in a company with huge ambitions and no products or sales. But you need to buy when everyone has given up and the price hits it's lows. Seems like $130 down to $22 we may be at that point.

Kicking it off will be CTO Tim Holme's call next month with Sam Jaffe and battery expert and professor Venkat Viswanathan Save the Date: Join our CTO and co-founder Tim Holme, alongside Venkat Viswanathan and @samjaffe, for their upcoming webinar ""Lithium Iron Phosphate + Lithium-Metal Anode"" on Thursday, Sept. 9th at 10 a.m. PT. Agenda and streaming details coming soon.https://twitter.com/QuantumScapeCo/status/1430244075920310273My opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape"
LONG QS. Buying more shares on the cheap everyday. Talk to me in 2023-2024 
"pops7 minutes agoReplied to a reaction$QS conversation@trollsJust 1 hour. After work, I checked the market. I’m holding Panasonic and have considered opening a position in QS but the investors here seem angry and emotional.They can’t answer basic questions about this company and when I aske they thumb me down and call me a troll.To me that’s a bad sign."
"“Investing should be more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow. If you want excitement, take $800 and go to Las Vegas.”-Paul SamuelsonSo true, and why BIll Gates, JB Straubel and Volkswagen believe in QuantumScape technology.My opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape."
"Why can’t they test multiple cells (10, 50, 100) simultaneously?? And accelerate progress??"
Did you hear it? Booom!
If this company is so great why is the stock tanking?

QS is the best
QS will pop to $30 real quick
"Most important words I have heard,1.We are competing with internal combustion engine2. If the battery is good then there is no need for government incentive for ev cars3. Fire hazard must be addressed Completely 4 we believe our technology got enough of a win that we can start toward mass production 4 in order for ev to go mainstream electric car needs fast charging 15 min or less5. I will not sell any of my stock, minus tax obligations , until we deliver working batteries to VW6. If third party test will calms some nerves then we will consider 3rd party Verification. 7. Range anxiety need to be addressed All these words came directly from the mouth of Jagdeep And yes fisker got caught stealing qs technology and they Quietly settle the case by paying $750,000 in fines to qsQs is the only player that got dendrites proof Ceramic separator consider the holy Grail of SSB. It took millions of test and over 10 years of research Any thoughts?"
"Nothings changed with QS except being closer than ever to the end goal. Currently 200 cycles on the 10 layer. When at 800 cycles this will show all the units working together, really no different than the battery itself. At that point other OEM’s will be tripping over themselves to make a joint venture partnership. Funny to see all these short sellers on here trying influence peoples investment. Don’t let yourself be conned. Do you do diligence and have conviction."
"Posting the Sandy Munro and Jagdeep interview from May 21 for new new investors https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKFiQIMyF-AIn addition, Sandy's recent tear down of the Ford Mach-E with a Ford engineer is interesting https://www.autoevolution.com/news/ford-mustang-mach-e-chief-engineer-explains-the-good-and-the-bad-in-the-ev-167970.html#agal_0The Ford engineer mentions Ford is willing to change and use the best technology out there. It would not surprise me if they hedge their bets on Solid Power (Sulfides) and are one of the OEM's lining up to test QuantumScape cells.US OEM's will need all the efficiencies to beat the International OEM's , young buyers do not care about brand and want to move to EV's for carbon reduction."
October mid interim data coming out. Do not sell.
Nothing has fundamentally changed in QuantumScape’s effort to be the first to deliver a revolutionary solid solid battery for EV’s. Carpe Diem!My opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape
