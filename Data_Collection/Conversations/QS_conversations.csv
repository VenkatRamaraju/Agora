"""The solid-state pilot plants are on their way, and we will all get what we've been waiting for - Pre-production data of larger cells"" Avicenne Energy U.S.And the leader in the space is QuantumScape as no other company has quite a revolutionary SSB as theirs.My opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape."
Anyone else find it strange that the mercedes EV is called the EQS?
"Another low volume day and shorts taking the advantage like the last 3 trading sessions. When qs rallied from 20’s to almost 29$ in a week, the volume was up to 44M. Today it is just over 6M 40 minutes before the close. Friday was 5.75M and the day before around 8M volume, all declining days are significantly lower than the other days.As a long, I have experienced many similar days before. Specially now QS is rising after good news and updates, and while sinking for no reason, I have zero concerns. I consider this as a borrowed money by shorts, and if I wait enough it will be paid back to me with the highest interest in my opinion.Just waiting for some good updates in October and rest of the quarter. Then I will still be holding QS of course, but my account value will put a big smile in my face every time I look."
"372, financial institutions cant be wrong"
$93.42 by this time next year
This can easily push past 30.

They need to build their future EV platform on a safe revolutionary new generation battery. It makes sense to me their CEO/CTO would choose the leader in the solid state battery space and that QuantumScape of course.Please reply on which you think the second OEM may be?My opinion and why i invested in QuantumScape

"Learn from my mistake if you are younger than 20 years old. My investment account in 1999 was higher than my current account today. This was because I invested most of my money on one stock. Do not follow me. Never do that. My mistake hurt me to this day. Still regret I sold Costco stock of 6,000 shares before ever stock split 3 times. Imagine if I still holding today. 2000 shares of Amgen in 1999. Or 2000 shares of Priceline sold low for $24. Well, that's life. Hope QS can redeem all my past mistakes."
QS is quitely making huge impact!!
"Upcoming expected and potential updates:-10 layer 800 cycles results. 200 cycle results were already shared by CEO, so I don’t expect any bad results - Name of the second oem- 3rd party testing results- New interest in QS, potential new customers -Q0 production kick off-Update on Q1 plant with VW, location selection All of these updates can trigger rallies similar to last week, and even more in my opinion. Shorts will eventually be forced to cover. Last quarter and Q1 of new year will be the times of QS! Longs will be rewarded."

The article however only addresses Volkswagen’s investment. It does not mention QuantumScape’s huge advances this year independent of the VW investment. For instance establishing their pre-pilot QS-0, 4 and 10 layer testing , hiring a super talented production leadership team and now reaching out to colleges. As QS does things with less fanfare i suspect they are much closer on delivering A production model to VW than we may know.As their CEO said “ We have done the science now it’s only a matter of scaling up”My opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape This"
MikeT no one here wants to buy your other stocks that would be insanity. Why because we already have to live through hell everyday with you and your id's spamming and spamming good posts away So why on earth would anyone here put them selfs through that on a different stock you own that would be insanity.
"$WIMI $QS $TLRY Limited downside, huge upside !!!!"
FOMO triggered.
"So I think about how many times in the history of technology the best solution was not used, because cheaper was enough. A solution like the Tesla 4680 may suffice and then who will need a QS? We will definitely look below 20 and it is not certain if the price will ever rise above 50 in the future."
Expect 300% return in the next 10 months!
"It is a reasonable value here, as opposed to the $ 120 pie in the sky price last year. Got me some"
"One more up day like today and my most expensive shares are above water. All gravy from there. Let's go QS, finish strong today!"

"Just a thought about the identity of our undisclosed OEM. First, what company would gain the most by not disclosing their participation with QS? Second, what company would be hurt the most by disclosing? Third, what company could be significantly hurt without this undisclosed relationship? And fourth, what company could be significantly strengthened by this undisclosed relationship? Tesla"
Confirmation of 10-layers expected soon.Top-10 OEM PR soonShort squeeze soon
How many layers are needed in order to produce a car battery?
"Shorts are standing on the train track say 'I am feeling good"". They ignore the fact that not one but 2 top 10 car manufacturers are interested in QS technology."
Breakout is just one news away.
Great day! This is fun.
"800 cycles seems to be the benchmark for testing, but I’d rather see how many cycles does it take to degrade to 80% of the beginning point. If the battery degrades on a linear basis then you can easily extrapolate a lot of data points. For example, if it takes 1100 cycles to degrade to 80%, then a 300 mile battery would have traveled approximately 297k miles and still have a range of 240 miles per charge."
"Picked up more at the open. Have overweighted and nktr is now part of my overweighted potential high achievers club: $NKTR, $QS, $TSE, $VTNR and a basket of fuel cell stocks ($BE, $BLDP, $FCEL, $PLUG).Good luck longs everywhere!"
"Cramer actually changed his position on QS. I believe he used to say he would steer clear of QS, now he saying ""be careful"". That's actually a more positive position than he once held."

QS = Quite Spectacular
"The new company that came to qs (my guess is Ford) looked at all the battery options and Out of all the options ,they picked qs.I’m sure they tested the hell out of qs cellsThis is major Validation and vote of confidence. The fear is overGood luck to all the long players I just can not understand why this will not go over 2000 ps This is just the beginning ,more refined improvements will be coming along as we move forward Any thoughts?"
Shorts can't afford to let QS close in the green. There is selling pressure in the last 30 minutes of trading nearly every day. Any positive PR will push the price much higher.
What’s going on? Maybe 10 layer results are in?
Morgan Stanley also likes battery company QuantumScape (QS) and wind-blade maker TPI Composites (TPIC) .

Ford recently made a deal with JB Straubel’s company Redwood materials teaming up on closed loop battery recycling. JB Straubel is on the board of QuantumScape…so could it be Ford is the 2nd OEM. It would make sense for them to remain anonymous as they have publicly announced a deal with Solid Power.This is speculation on my part as I have no knowledge of who the 2nd OEM is but kinda makes sense.
Does VW could buyout QS and prevent other car companies using QS tech?WV already owns 30% of QS???

"Short interest down around a million for the first two weeks of September to 35,800,000. The short interest rate is still close to 19% from the previous report (it is now 18.5%). Maybe Scorpion ran out of money to continue shorting. Not sure if they started covering the past week. It’s hard to say but I hope they have not and end up giving back all of their gains.I hope we get one or two more announcements prior to the earnings call in late October, however, progress on additional layers and results may not come out until then."
"https://www.autoevolution.com/news/solid-power-puts-solid-state-cells-to-independent-tests-with-promising-results-171673.html#The article does not seem 100% sure Solid Power recent news is a break through.Solid Power also said that its solid-state batteries would have a high-silicon content. This silicon is used for the anodes, which allows the battery to have rapid charging. Solid Power also works with lithium metal anodes, like QuantumScape. The problem is that the silicon anodes do not provide as much energy density as lithium metal. The main benefit must be related to cost.Solid Power did not disclose when these new solid-state cells will be available for automotive use. It just said that they could retain 82% of their capacity after 1,000 cycles. If a battery pack offers 300 miles of range, that means you can use it for around 300,000 miles and still have a range of 240 mi after that time. That’s something that also happens to current cells. The advantage is taking fire and thermal runaways out of the equation. Let’s hope the production version of Solid Power’s cells can keep that prom"

"Yesterday's announcement from Ford that it will spend a massive $11.4 Billion on EV Battery Plants is great news for the EV industry, including QuantumScape. It means OEM's are serious about the push from ICE to electric vehicles. QS is also very serious it recently hired Andrew Ng one of the top AI experts in the world to advise on using deep visual AI to identify any flaws in its solid state cell production process at QS-0. Add Andrew Ng, Celina Mikolajczak and Clayton together and you have super talented production team that will bring QuantumScape's solid state battery to production. ""Mikolajczak has a strong background leading highly sophisticated cell engineering and battery manufacturing functions for prominent organizations, including Tesla Motors and Uber. She joins QuantumScape from Panasonic Energy of North America, where she played an integral role in scaling some of the leading battery technologies fueling today’s electric vehicle revolution as VP of Engineering & Battery Technology""""Clayton Patch Vice President of Manufacturing has extensive experience with high-volume process-oriented manufacturing, having run fab operations and advanced development at Micron Technology, Inc. and IM Flash – a joint venture between Micron Technology and Intel Corporation""My opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape."
Can always tell a MikeT id they have to post at least 2 posts in a row. They don't call him the yahoo spammer for nothing.
Nice late rally coming!
"A lot of noise and volatility for this venture stock and rightly so for the nature of the company today. For me, the company has the potential to be a cash machine if they reach the breakthroughs and amass the IP portfolio to license the patents. Company reminds me of the potential of Qualcomm during the 1990s when the world was still wireless analog moving to digital and GSM was the transmission standard around the world and TDMA was the standard for the US. I believe initially only Sprint deployed CDMA nationally. The world needs battery breakthroughs at this point to make EVs really work long term."
Short position is still very high. Same as GME. We could see a major short squeeze in the next two weeks.
Down today? You cannot be serious!
We bet QS shares on the future of their solid state technologies. BUT Tesla 4680 shows that it will also work differently. Another and simpler technology.It's a question. I'm thinking of selling QS. Some ideas?
this is top notch tech company. we enter EV era and solid state battery cells are here to stay.

"The latest short meme is to suggest the 10 layer results are baked into the price. A couple of points: success in this area is by no means assured although we hope so. The only big moves have been ad a result of an OEM partnering announcement. Otherwise the stock has been basically quiet. So to my eyes, this suggestion is not accurate. If I am correct, a successful 10 layer test will be significant but not the catalyst for the rocket ride we hope to see eventually. Fully successful battery production testing, more OEMs, and opening of pilot plant will ne the proofs in the pudding that together create the ingredients for the initial rocket ride to 100+."
"It is going, we can see $45 soon"
Up 5% low volume. Does that mean less people are selling?
sky is the limit!
10 layer cell research news will be catalyst to $45 if even not more.
Great volume for just 1 hour trading on a UP day.

"many of the commenters on this QS site are bringing up questions and concerns that have already been addressed. For example, the VW/QS joint venture plant Q1 in Salzgitter Germany has already been announced and the engine manufacturing plant there is being converted into the first production line of QS SS batteries alongside the start up of the EV electric motor and controls production lines. The Wall Street Journal actually sent a team there to photograph the actual start of the electric motor production line, to talk with the VW SSbattery VP Bloom who is also on QS Board of Directors about what concerns he has about their plan. The biggest concern is finding enough qualified people to hire, ESPECIALLY Electrochemical Engineers. Also shown in the article was the Ground preparation for another plant about the same size as the converted engine plant that is immediately alongside that plant. I will bet that this site will be the location for Q3 plant that has not been announced; however, it could also be for the Q2 plant Joint venture with the Norwegian Lithium Ion Poly sulfide battery currently being used by VW and other German OEM's that was tentatively being considered to be built in Spain. This would be especially likely if the continued great results from the QS battery convinced VW to cease using the Lithium Ion polymer sulfide separator battery in current vehicles and make the battery retrofit with QS technology which would also increase the range of those vehicles, improve their safety, and have fast charging capability. Technologically,, the only reason for delaying that is the need to be certain that no QS technology failures occur such as a sudden loss of meeting specifications or safety. Secondly, the massive joint venture of Ford and SK investments Korean battery manufacturer for the 4.8 billion dollar West Memphis complex to build the Ford F150 EV and the battieries for it does not preclude that joint venture buying the license to use QS technology and QS patented ss separators. I do not think this would make VW happy, but could still happen due to VW's large investment in QS. Also almost lost in the West Memphis press release was an even larger investment in KY by Ford and SKI were TWO battery manufacturing plants for the Lincoln EV and for other EV vehicles. The total Ford investment in EV technology was said to be over 11 billion dollars. I do not think Ford and SKI think they can copy the QS technology without paying a license fee and royalties along with purchase of the patented solid state polyceram QS separator. I personally believe that the second top ten OEM for which QS contracted to supply a large number of QS batteries prior to the planned opening of Q0 is GM. GM can not continue to produce flaming Bolts. This has already cost them 1.8 billion dollars in recall costs. Even GM can not continue to have this axe over their heads. The resumed battery production for the replacement batteries for the Bolt still require that the car not be charged inside and also not to be charged above 90 % full charge and not be discharged below 20%. This is still a marketing disaster. GM's LG designed lithium Ion battery plant in MI can be switched over to the QS separator used design which would end the fire problem but would not provide the more energy dense battery that the full QS design makes. Further, GM has announced that their Cadillac EV has a range exceeding 400 miles which might mean that they are already contemplating use of QS batteries when they become available.l In fact that contract for the QS supplied EV batteries before Q0 is open could be that the Cadillac EV could be the planned test bed for the QS batteries that would further enforce a joint venture operation like the VW/QS joint venture at that GM MI battery plant. It has been reported that GM is suing LG for over a billion dollars for the recall damages. I think this is going to kill the GM /LG joint venture."
"QuantumScape recently announced that the company has built and begun testing their first 10-layer full-sized cells – ahead of their targeted date of year-end and only 8 months after publicly unveiling the first data set on their single-layer cells. Initial results revealed performance data that is substantially similar to past successful trials on single- and 4-layer cells.CEO Jagdeep Singh describes the test data as “encouraging early 10-layer cell cycling results – now at 200 cycles with >96% capacity retention at 1C/1C and 25 degC, generally in line with what we’ve seen for our single- and four-layer cells.”"

Picking up now guys 
"Now it is appears that Apple could be the first mega buyer of the QuantumScape Solid-State Battery Technology. Instead of a conventional liquid electrolyte—the stuff that ferries lithium ions between electrodes—it uses a solid electrolyte. Also, the battery’s negative terminal, called its anode, is made from pure lithium metal. This combination would send its energy density through the roof, enable ultra-fast charging, and would eliminate the risk of battery fires. But for the past 40 years, no one has been able to make a solid-state battery that delivers on this promise—until earlier this year. QuantumScape technology may be exactly what Apple is looking for. Reuters warns that pandemic-related delays could push back production into 2025 or later, and that there’s a chance Apple decides to reduce the scope of the project."
Tesla + QS = EV market ownership

After last Friday shorting to keep the price below 27 they need to buy back those shares. The volume will be higher and they will compete to buy shares with people who are long. Get the popcorn and watch the pop!
"Shorts are planting the idea of trading, and using options. Don't do it. It is likely you will gain pennies and lose out on a potential giant. Assuming all goes well, this stock will go up strongly for a year and you will never get back in at anything approaching current prices."
"The 2nd top 10 OEM's deal is a huge endorsement of QS. It's more convincing than 3rd party tests as they put actually money to buy 10MWh of the QS0 capacity. The short reports from Scorpion is destroyed. This is a highly confidential industry where QS can only share very limited information public to protect against competitions and copycats. QS is also progressing well on 10 layer testing. From 1 to 4 to 10 layers, they proved they can maintain the performance level making multilayers. From 10 to 20 or 40 is less challenging from making 1 to 4 or 10 layers. QS is very close to real product and once its starts the commercial production, it'll be easily a company of $200B market cap as it will disrupt the whole EV industry and consumer electronics. Imagine batter is never a constraint with cars, with iPhones, with any other things in your daily lives. Before that, I would put $50B as a more realistic 12 month target and that translates to $120 per share. Good luck longs."
whats up?
"Ouch. That's gotta hurt out of the gate. Fortunately for me, I'm long and heavy."
23.71 stock price at the tome MikeT starts his daily spam a thon.
"The timing of the 2nd OEM's deal is very critical. On Aug 16th, Jagdeep tweeted that they have completed 200 cycles at 1C/1C. The deal should have happened around Sep 20th, which is 35 days after. That's about additional 420 cycles and it brings the total test cycles to around 620, if not more than 800 already. It's quite certain that the test results are very encouraging and leads the 2nd OEM to have strong confidence and interests in QS. QS will definitely update the 10 layers test result in coming Q3 shareholders' letter. They will probably also announce other plans to scale up the layers ready for QS0 pilot production.Solid State Battery is the battery of the future and no car OEMs can ignore the technology trend. I am sure other OEMs are also evaluating whether they should get a foot in QS's technology, similar to VW is also closely monitoring other developments in the battery market. I won't be surprised if QS make other agreements with 3rd, 4th or 5th top 10 OEMs in coming months or years."
"Ev companies will need newer technology,just like in smartphones. Better tech means better product,better product means higher position compared to rivals."

Scorpion attacking a company symbol DNA with another fraud report. But Cathy Wood is adding this week. The market cap is double that of Quantumscape. $21 billion or more market cap. Scorpion capital probable will be able to get DNA down to $2 bucks if Scorpion was able to kick QS down from $133 to $19. Shorts are too powerful with their fraud reports. But I'm keeping Quantumscape for at least one to two more years.

They are leading the market in solid state battery technology, have protected their technology with a deep economic moat through patents and trade secrets, and have built a strong balance sheet that has the resources to support R&D and product commercialization.”https://seekingalpha.com/article/4457791-quantumscape-ev-battery-of-future"
Think we rally with the market tomorrow?
QuantumScape has the only lithium- metal solid-state battery with automotive OEM validation.
nice start to the day
"Reading up on Solid Power it looks like their advantage is they’re further along in manufacturability but with current sulfide based electrolyte they’re at lower performance still than current gen batteries. QS with a small team is working to get to a commercial manufacturing of a much higher more energy dense, high performance, and longer lasting battery. So a key question is do you value high performance or low cost. Totally different pathways for their businesses. With technology this cutting edge any investment is in part an act of faith, but as for me I’d rather have true solid state of QS than a less cutting edge tech that’s closer to manufacturing. License vs OEM model is another big factor. Lots of uncertainty, ain’t for the timid investing in EV battery tech! Glta"
Just bought in lightly will add to position if it stays positive.
QS is about to touch 72.
"GM all over the news boasting the doubling in sales to come and commitment to EV...Think that might have something to do with the company strongly believing they will have a ""differentiating technology""? Maybe something along the lines of having a battery they know will be so far superior consumers will have no choice but to give their entire electric fleet a very good look."
This company has 10 years of successful research and development behind it! This is the reason you have Volkswagen and another unknown OEM investing money and time in this new technology! As we move forward and get closer to production for this new battery investors will be greatly rewarded!!! Trust me Fridays close at 27 is nothing compared to what this stock will be worth in the future!
I averaged about 35$. Holding till 2027-2028 year. Hopefully it will be 1000$
All Nissan and Toyota’s will have dual battery starting 2025 and QS is one of the providers
who bought won the life
"Shorts and hedgies have a lot of power on no-news, low-volume days. No surprise to drift lower then. Won't be surprised by future short attacks but they have, I think, both exhausted their techniques and time. If QS is successful, they will fight continuing battles, but at higher levels."
hurts to be short....
Ford just announced 11 billion campus site to build electric cars. Could an announcement now come that Ford is the oem?
"Wow, thought for sure today would be a give back day, but green again. Man, would NOT want to be short this stock."
"I'm sticking with $QS as the big disrupter in the EV industry down the road until I see something better with more promise, and I haven't seen it yet, so I'm still buying & holding .."
QS should be $30+ by the end of next week.
QS is poised to reach $75
picked up another 10 shares at $27. not much but trying to get as much as possible without going into debt
"10/15 open interest call options at 11,143 at a strike price $30"
"I cannot analyze, test, or understand the workability of these batteries but I will trust in the two big manufacturers who do and who have tested them and felt confident enough to jump on board. That’s enough for me so I am in for the long term.￼"
Today is another green day
The actual big news is that this oem has inspected and tested the technology and deemed it legitimate
"Short interest increased during the last 2 weeks in September from 35,800,000 to 36,020,000 (18.6% of free float). Which means Scorpion is still holding on. The main reason why the stock dropped from $40 to $20’s is only because of them and once they exit, it will go back to that price and more. They have to realize that downside is much more limited compared to the upside at this point. All they’re doing now is losing money paying interest on the shares that they borrowed. With recent confirmation that successful progress is being made with additional layers and other parties taking notice, I would not be surprised that shorts start to cover. The next couple of weeks will be very telling."
QS is up most sessions nowadays. up strongly in some sessions even. not bad at all
This climbing is going to continue to ~27.5 where its going to wait for the 10layer report that could take it up to 40
$35 by the end of week
I will drive to the company and talk to employees how the business doing ? Do they work over time etc ?
"So I think one more bit of significant positive news is the catalyst that launches us to a year of nearly constant stock price appreciation. Another top 10 OEM buyer (identified), start of initial production lines, successful latest tests that is usable in an EV would probably do it. So I think the shorts have a very small window to slander QS with all their might, trying to break free some cheap shares to cover their bets.I for one, will not sell a single share. Hope you will join me in flipping the single digit salute to the shorts who sowed the seeds of their own destruction by letting us get many more shares on the cheap than we should have been able to!"
MikeT you say shorts are nervous? Why? Serious question from a real long They know any good information you and your id's will spam away as fast as you can So why on earth in your insane mind do you of all people think there scarred.
Thank you all for the opportunity to buy this low.Just sold 1000 shares of TESLA and all in QS at 22.85
Bought another 56 shares today. :)
"If my math is correct. You better buy now!!!!!Be warned! This is going to explode to the upside!Aug 16, 2021 ==================>> They reported it already completed a 200 cycles successfullyJul 27, 2021 ==================>> announcing the beginning of 10 layers testing= 18 daystesting: One cycle(charge plus discharge) takes 2 hours= 12 cycles in 24 hoursgive and take there are 20 days between July 27 and Aug 16th. Mr Jagdeep reported that the 10 layers performs 200 cycle successfully on Aug 16thToday is Sept 28.That means from Aug 16 to Sept 28th we have = 15+28= 43 days43 X 12 cycles= 516then add the 200 cycles already announced on Aug 16, 2021.Therefore, we can fairly say that= 200 +516= 716 cycles already performed in the 10 layers testing.I think next week they will announce that they completed successfully above 800 cycles on their 10 layer testing and that is going a big news.The above is my analysis and I am confident from what I see the stock is going to be above 40 next week!do your own analysis please"
"No production till 2024, ouch"
My take their 10 layer is a success and their 24 layer is probably in production waiting to be announced in 2022 also already a success. I can feel it in my bones.

cathy woody bought a tonwhy not u?
"Well that was fun. Bit shorts are going to redouble their efforts and there will be many who begin to be afraid when no new updates come out for awhile. It may drift for a bit. However, the news of a new OEM should be plenty to realize this company is headed in the right direction. Hold and Mute."
Are the securities awarded to Celina Mikolajczak VP of Manufacturing and Engineering linked to goals achieved in establishing QS-0?
Is QS trending on Reddit?
Battery fires haunt the electric car and clean power revolution https://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/battery-fires-haunt-the-electric-car-and-clean-power-revolution/The move to safer solid state battery technology cant happen quick enough for the industry.
"Does anyone know when the next test report date is—10 layer? If good, stock price will be at $50Within days"
"My thoughts about the conversation here. If any of the day traders (long or short) or short sellers actually believe that the posts they put on here are going to change the conviction of those that have the balls to buy at 60-45-30-20 while the was price dropping, then you are sadly mistaken.Those of us who have that conviction have/are buying do not concern themselves with the daily movements now.This is a long term multi bagger investment of the decade in my opinion. Day to day movements now mean nothing to me. Anybody still here in three years time will be in a position to declare whether QS was good investment or not.If you don’t tolerate risk then this is not the investment for you. If you want to trade volitility the could I suggest crypto trading. The long term holders will hold regardless.Thumbs up or down at will!"
All the way up 
"Remember QS had a job posting for someone that spoke Japanese? Do think that could have been related to the second OEM announcement? If so, the three top ten Japanese car companies are Toyota, Honda and Nissan. I think it could also be SAIC, the largest automaker in China — given that they were an early investor in QS.Also, do you remember the huge spike in trading volume at the close on Friday? They knew the news was big and coming soon. I don’t think Scorpion has exited yet as I think they were at it again at the close to bring down the price to reduce their pain. So, I think a short squeeze has not started yet. QS has been a trending ticker for multiple days this week and hopefully will catch the attention of the retail crowd. Once the snowball starts rolling down the hill, it will be hard to stop. I sure hope it smashes a Scorpion on the way."

"QuantumScape is in the drivers seat of all OEM EV's, once they present their agnostic revolutionary solid state battery to the world! My opinion and why i invested in QuantumScape"
"BERLIN -- Volkswagen Group CEO Herbert Diess told a supervisory board meeting in September that the company could lose 30,000 jobs if it transitioned too slowly to full-electric vehicles, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.. https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/vw-ceo-diess-warns-shift-evs-could-cost-30000-jobs-report-saysVW is closely watching QS's progress on 10 Layer and QS-0 with heightened anticipation in my opinion."
"LCID and QS , diamond hands."
10 more at 25.23$ just now. In for long haul.
Can someone explain to me the difference between the battery QS is developing as opposed to the batteries available today…thanks

Shorts are gonna lose money
"""Farley on Tuesday took a subtle shot at GM, which has set a goal to become all electric by the middle of the next decade.'We’re not talking about aspirations, we’re doing it,' Farley said on Bloomberg Television. 'We’re a show company, not a tell company. We have iconic vehicles, we’re betting on the good stuff, electrified Mustangs, electrified F-Series.' ""------That statements sounds like GM might be looking forward to next-gen battery makers in contrast to Ford to working with traditional battery makers and that *could* mean GM working with QS.
