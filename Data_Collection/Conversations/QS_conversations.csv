"QuantumScape today announced it will release 2021 third quarter financial results after market close on Tuesday, October 26, 2021. This will be followed by a conference call at 2:00 p.m."
MikeT no one here wants to buy your other stocks that would be insanity. Why because we already have to live through hell everyday with you and your id's spamming and spamming good posts away So why on earth would anyone here put them selfs through that on a different stock you own that would be insanity.
My take their 10 layer is a success and their 24 layer is probably in production waiting to be announced in 2022 also already a success. I can feel it in my bones.
"Ouch. That's gotta hurt out of the gate. Fortunately for me, I'm long and heavy."
Can always tell a MikeT id they have to post at least 2 posts in a row. They don't call him the yahoo spammer for nothing.
"Just a thought about the identity of our undisclosed OEM. First, what company would gain the most by not disclosing their participation with QS? Second, what company would be hurt the most by disclosing? Third, what company could be significantly hurt without this undisclosed relationship? And fourth, what company could be significantly strengthened by this undisclosed relationship? Tesla"
So what does “mentioned” mean in the Cathie Woods/ARK Funds news item even mean?
Does VW could buyout QS and prevent other car companies using QS tech?WV already owns 30% of QS???
Any idea when we are expecting result for 10 layer battery tests
Great article on seeking Alpha today
It’s highly likely that QS will have good news regarding 10 layer testing.
"Remember QS had a job posting for someone that spoke Japanese? Do think that could have been related to the second OEM announcement? If so, the three top ten Japanese car companies are Toyota, Honda and Nissan. I think it could also be SAIC, the largest automaker in China — given that they were an early investor in QS.Also, do you remember the huge spike in trading volume at the close on Friday? They knew the news was big and coming soon. I don’t think Scorpion has exited yet as I think they were at it again at the close to bring down the price to reduce their pain. So, I think a short squeeze has not started yet. QS has been a trending ticker for multiple days this week and hopefully will catch the attention of the retail crowd. Once the snowball starts rolling down the hill, it will be hard to stop. I sure hope it smashes a Scorpion on the way."
"Yesterday's announcement from Ford that it will spend a massive $11.4 Billion on EV Battery Plants is great news for the EV industry, including QuantumScape. It means OEM's are serious about the push from ICE to electric vehicles. QS is also very serious it recently hired Andrew Ng one of the top AI experts in the world to advise on using deep visual AI to identify any flaws in its solid state cell production process at QS-0. Add Andrew Ng, Celina Mikolajczak and Clayton together and you have super talented production team that will bring QuantumScape's solid state battery to production. ""Mikolajczak has a strong background leading highly sophisticated cell engineering and battery manufacturing functions for prominent organizations, including Tesla Motors and Uber. She joins QuantumScape from Panasonic Energy of North America, where she played an integral role in scaling some of the leading battery technologies fueling today’s electric vehicle revolution as VP of Engineering & Battery Technology""""Clayton Patch Vice President of Manufacturing has extensive experience with high-volume process-oriented manufacturing, having run fab operations and advanced development at Micron Technology, Inc. and IM Flash – a joint venture between Micron Technology and Intel Corporation""My opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape."
Down today? You cannot be serious!
I like CTO Tim Holme 's twitter from September 26th and its my opinion QS will have a piece of the EV battery pie in the coming years! Onward to QS-0 Cool graphic. Let’s try to change it over the coming years.https://twitter.com/ironmantimholme/status/1442242008853016576
"I cannot analyze, test, or understand the workability of these batteries but I will trust in the two big manufacturers who do and who have tested them and felt confident enough to jump on board. That’s enough for me so I am in for the long term.￼"

"Now it is appears that Apple could be the first mega buyer of the QuantumScape Solid-State Battery Technology. Instead of a conventional liquid electrolyte—the stuff that ferries lithium ions between electrodes—it uses a solid electrolyte. Also, the battery’s negative terminal, called its anode, is made from pure lithium metal. This combination would send its energy density through the roof, enable ultra-fast charging, and would eliminate the risk of battery fires. But for the past 40 years, no one has been able to make a solid-state battery that delivers on this promise—until earlier this year. QuantumScape technology may be exactly what Apple is looking for. Reuters warns that pandemic-related delays could push back production into 2025 or later, and that there’s a chance Apple decides to reduce the scope of the project."
Stay strong

"i expect a nice run into earnings in light of another major auto company investing in Quantum-Scape with Volkswagen at the front of Quantum-Scapes financial structure......dont expect the stock price to remain this cheap given the huge opportunity within the EV complex........go qs,,"
"Daily volume has been under 10M in the last trading sessions with SP declining from around 26 $ to 22’s, and back to 24$. I think this is great just before the big updates. SP could be defended in such low volume days, some days being even under 5M!Another good thing, last time the rally begin from 20’s and went up to 29$, this time I can’t imagine where the upper limit be this time if the rally begins with the sp over 25$. Expected possible updates with the earnings report on 26 October; the 10 layer 800 cycle results, 3rd party testing results, Q0 plant manufacturing readiness status, Q1 plant updates with VW. Surprise updates could also come like more layers testing, name of the second oem. I think all could make the impact of second oem and even more."
SP is almost back to same levels it stabilized at before the second OEM signed up. Added more at the bargain level now 
"If you compare Tesla with its five-for-one split in mid-August 2020 than Tesla is over 4000$ worth, so you can easily double this because of EVs are basically batteries on wheels! And not only EVs need QS batteries, every electronic device!"
"800 cycles seems to be the benchmark for testing, but I’d rather see how many cycles does it take to degrade to 80% of the beginning point. If the battery degrades on a linear basis then you can easily extrapolate a lot of data points. For example, if it takes 1100 cycles to degrade to 80%, then a 300 mile battery would have traveled approximately 297k miles and still have a range of 240 miles per charge."
"CEO Jagdeep Singh describes the test data as “encouraging early 10-layer cell cycling results – now at 200 cycles with >96% capacity retention at 1C/1C and 25 degC, generally in line with what we’ve seen for our single- and four-layer cells.”Reply"
Confirmation of 10-layers expected soon.Top-10 OEM PR soonShort squeeze soon
I googled SAIC Motors and Quantumscape. SAIC Motors like Volkswagen is the leading car company in China. It is also an early investor of QS. SAIC is committed towards the manufacture of EV. So this company would have privy to the technological advantages of QS SSB.In my view this is the unknown second car company.It is also interesting to note that SAIC EV is also scheduled 2025 as their production rollout which coincide with QS commercial production.So what do you think. I apologize if this observation has already been posted. https://www.google.com/search?q=saic+motors+quantumscape&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS837US837&oq=SAIC+Motors+Quantumscape&aqs=chrome.0.69i59.13759j0j15&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
This company has 10 years of successful research and development behind it! This is the reason you have Volkswagen and another unknown OEM investing money and time in this new technology! As we move forward and get closer to production for this new battery investors will be greatly rewarded!!! Trust me Fridays close at 27 is nothing compared to what this stock will be worth in the future!
sky is the limit!
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Rightpicker.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
QuantumScape has the only lithium- metal solid-state battery with automotive OEM validation.
"The latest short meme is to suggest the 10 layer results are baked into the price. A couple of points: success in this area is by no means assured although we hope so. The only big moves have been ad a result of an OEM partnering announcement. Otherwise the stock has been basically quiet. So to my eyes, this suggestion is not accurate. If I am correct, a successful 10 layer test will be significant but not the catalyst for the rocket ride we hope to see eventually. Fully successful battery production testing, more OEMs, and opening of pilot plant will ne the proofs in the pudding that together create the ingredients for the initial rocket ride to 100+."
"Upcoming expected and potential updates:-10 layer 800 cycles results. 200 cycle results were already shared by CEO, so I don’t expect any bad results - Name of the second oem- 3rd party testing results- New interest in QS, potential new customers -Q0 production kick off-Update on Q1 plant with VW, location selection All of these updates can trigger rallies similar to last week, and even more in my opinion. Shorts will eventually be forced to cover. Last quarter and Q1 of new year will be the times of QS! Longs will be rewarded."
Ford just announced 11 billion campus site to build electric cars. Could an announcement now come that Ford is the oem?

Buying calls betting on good news before end of October
"The timing of the 2nd OEM's deal is very critical. On Aug 16th, Jagdeep tweeted that they have completed 200 cycles at 1C/1C. The deal should have happened around Sep 20th, which is 35 days after. That's about additional 420 cycles and it brings the total test cycles to around 620, if not more than 800 already. It's quite certain that the test results are very encouraging and leads the 2nd OEM to have strong confidence and interests in QS. QS will definitely update the 10 layers test result in coming Q3 shareholders' letter. They will probably also announce other plans to scale up the layers ready for QS0 pilot production.Solid State Battery is the battery of the future and no car OEMs can ignore the technology trend. I am sure other OEMs are also evaluating whether they should get a foot in QS's technology, similar to VW is also closely monitoring other developments in the battery market. I won't be surprised if QS make other agreements with 3rd, 4th or 5th top 10 OEMs in coming months or years."
"Well that was fun. Bit shorts are going to redouble their efforts and there will be many who begin to be afraid when no new updates come out for awhile. It may drift for a bit. However, the news of a new OEM should be plenty to realize this company is headed in the right direction. Hold and Mute."
"So I think one more bit of significant positive news is the catalyst that launches us to a year of nearly constant stock price appreciation. Another top 10 OEM buyer (identified), start of initial production lines, successful latest tests that is usable in an EV would probably do it. So I think the shorts have a very small window to slander QS with all their might, trying to break free some cheap shares to cover their bets.I for one, will not sell a single share. Hope you will join me in flipping the single digit salute to the shorts who sowed the seeds of their own destruction by letting us get many more shares on the cheap than we should have been able to!"
Just received a email - Oct 26th 3rd Qtr. Financial results will be announced.
Don’t know if it’s just me but I am smelling some great announcement coming from QS very soon. VERY SOON.

10 layer cell research news will be catalyst to $45 if even not more.
All Nissan and Toyota’s will have dual battery starting 2025 and QS is one of the providers
The actual big news is that this oem has inspected and tested the technology and deemed it legitimate

"Learn from my mistake if you are younger than 20 years old. My investment account in 1999 was higher than my current account today. This was because I invested most of my money on one stock.

"Quantumscape has been an exciting stock for early-in investors to own, but it’s built on a foundation that makes every bit of sense in today’s EV battery market.Li-ion batteries come with a suite of clear disadvantages, including capacity, peak charge deterioration over time, overheating, and the necessity for serious cooling systems. That’s not to mention their penchant for exploding or catching on fire if damaged or compromised.Because of that, the holy grail for EV makers is now the solid-state battery, which uses a solid electrolyte instead of a liquid or polymer, and can deliver two to 10 times the energy density of lithium-ion. They’re more powerful, without consuming the extra space. And they should be able to charge faster"

"GM all over the news boasting the doubling in sales to come and commitment to EV...Think that might have something to do with the company strongly believing they will have a ""differentiating technology""?

"many of the commenters on this QS site are bringing up questions and concerns that have already been addressed. For example, the VW/QS joint venture plant Q1 in Salzgitter Germany has already been announced and the engine manufacturing plant there is being converted into the first production line of QS SS batteries alongside the start up of the EV electric motor and controls production lines. The Wall Street Journal actually sent a team there to photograph the actual start of the electric motor production line, to talk with the VW SSbattery VP Bloom who is also on QS Board of Directors about what concerns he has about their plan. The biggest concern is finding enough qualified people to hire, ESPECIALLY Electrochemical Engineers. Also shown in the article was the Ground preparation for another plant about the same size as the converted engine plant that is immediately alongside that plant. I will bet that this site will be the location for Q3 plant that has not been announced; however, it could also be for the Q2 plant Joint venture with the Norwegian Lithium Ion Poly sulfide battery currently being used by VW and other German OEM's that was tentatively being considered to be built in Spain. This would be especially likely if the continued great results from the QS battery convinced VW to cease using the Lithium Ion polymer sulfide separator battery in current vehicles and make the battery retrofit with QS technology which would also increase the range of those vehicles, improve their safety, and have fast charging capability. Technologically,, the only reason for delaying that is the need to be certain that no QS technology failures occur such as a sudden loss of meeting specifications or safety. Secondly, the massive joint venture of Ford and SK investments Korean battery manufacturer for the 4.8 billion dollar West Memphis complex to build the Ford F150 EV and the battieries for it does not preclude that joint venture buying the license to use QS technology and QS patented ss separators. I do not think this would make VW happy, but could still happen due to VW's large investment in QS. Also almost lost in the West Memphis press release was an even larger investment in KY by Ford and SKI were TWO battery manufacturing plants for the Lincoln EV and for other EV vehicles. The total Ford investment in EV technology was said to be over 11 billion dollars. I do not think Ford and SKI think they can copy the QS technology without paying a license fee and royalties along with purchase of the patented solid state polyceram QS separator. I personally believe that the second top ten OEM for which QS contracted to supply a large number of QS batteries prior to the planned opening of Q0 is GM. GM can not continue to produce flaming Bolts. This has already cost them 1.8 billion dollars in recall costs. Even GM can not continue to have this axe over their heads. The resumed battery production for the replacement batteries for the Bolt still require that the car not be charged inside and also not to be charged above 90 % full charge and not be discharged below 20%. This is still a marketing disaster. GM's LG designed lithium Ion battery plant in MI can be switched over to the QS separator used design which would end the fire problem but would not provide the more energy dense battery that the full QS design makes. Further, GM has announced that their Cadillac EV has a range exceeding 400 miles which might mean that they are already contemplating use of QS batteries when they become available.l In fact that contract for the QS supplied EV batteries before Q0 is open could be that the Cadillac EV could be the planned test bed for the QS batteries that would further enforce a joint venture operation like the VW/QS joint venture at that GM MI battery plant. It has been reported that GM is suing LG for over a billion dollars for the recall damages. I think this is going to kill the GM /LG joint venture."

Lithium&Battery index is booming.. everyone knows that the future is electric.. which helps qs in the short-term especially with upcoming good news from qs agead.. so expect the sentiment in qs ssb will only rise from here. The tested and proven cells are already perfectly applicable in laptops and other tech (Maybe they will keep using QS-0 for these applications. The SSB is proven to be ideal because it has no downsidesWith VW and a strong board they will be able to produce it for vw cars. The third big factory will be for themselves to sell privately.. when the production is limited in the beginning these batteries will go for high-end cars so for a high price.. from the bit of production expertise and available profits they can quickly ramp up.. meanwhile the second OEM will want to be having their own factory and this is how QS can become the next BIGGER tesla since they can sell a product with a bigger profit to cost of production ratio.. AND they have a HUGE market to sell to.. even more applications than the car industry. Thumbs up if you agree that this is what we can expect to happen!

"My thoughts about the conversation here. If any of the day traders (long or short) or short sellers actually believe that the posts they put on here are going to change the conviction of those that have the balls to buy at 60-45-30-20 while the was price dropping, then you are sadly mistaken.Those of us who have that conviction have/are buying do not concern themselves with the daily movements now.This is a long term multi bagger investment of the decade in my opinion. Day to day movements now mean nothing to me. Anybody still here in three years time will be in a position to declare whether QS was good investment or not.If you don’t tolerate risk then this is not the investment for you. If you want to trade volitility the could I suggest crypto trading. The long term holders will hold regardless.Thumbs up or down at will!"

The problem is that the silicon anodes do not provide as much energy density as lithium metal. The main benefit must be related to cost.Solid Power did not disclose when these new solid-state cells will be available for automotive use. It just said that they could retain 82% of their capacity after 1,000 cycles. If a battery pack offers 300 miles of range, that means you can use it for around 300,000 miles and still have a range of 240 mi after that time. That’s something that also happens to current cells. The advantage is taking fire and thermal runaways out of the equation. Let’s hope the production version of Solid Power’s cells can keep that prom"
"In the last 4 days Shortsellers had an Entrypoint of 26 in average and sold around 30.000.000 shares short, so they Must have 780.000.000 $ as assurance on their margin accounts to buy the shares back, if they want or have to cover their shortposition. So you can see how heavily they fight to push the share price under 30$. So imagine where the price would be already without this Shortseller Parasit ! A couple of good news and they can’t hold their position anymore, because all their money will be in danger! This news will come and the Shortsellers will experience a millennium Shortsqueeze. Hold your shares and they can’t make money with your money, they make only money if you sell your shares! Hold your investment in QS and you will be rich and the Shortselllers poor!"
Ford recently made a deal with JB Straubel’s company Redwood materials teaming up on closed loop battery recycling. JB Straubel is on the board of QuantumScape…so could it be Ford is the 2nd OEM. It would make sense for them to remain anonymous as they have publicly announced a deal with Solid Power.This is speculation on my part as I have no knowledge of who the 2nd OEM is but kinda makes sense.
$35 by the end of week
"Ups and downs don't mean too much. Just traders fighting over pennies. If you believe QS will be successful, all you have to do is hold."
Great! I told you that this will be green by closing!
10 layer results any week now
"Well, I got more on the dip. Already had way more than normal weighting, but couldn't resist the dip."
"Qs will be the big winner.Qs is a 150 usd Stock, if it becomes true and it looks good."
QuantumScape Is about to explode Great things are about to happen
Battery fires haunt the electric car and clean power revolution https://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/battery-fires-haunt-the-electric-car-and-clean-power-revolution/The move to safer solid state battery technology cant happen quick enough for the industry.
We are on the move again!
we are in the wrong sector at the moment.all markets are screaming higher with out us.any advise would be grateful.

Buy & Hold we should go to $27+ easy next week..
This can easily push past 30.
Breakout is just one news away.
Anyone else find it strange that the mercedes EV is called the EQS?
QS should be $30+ by the end of next week.
$30 by the end of the month
"So I think about how many times in the history of technology the best solution was not used, because cheaper was enough. A solution like the Tesla 4680 may suffice and then who will need a QS? We will definitely look below 20 and it is not certain if the price will ever rise above 50 in the future."
"It is going, we can see $45 soon"
hurts to be short....
cathy woody bought a tonwhy not u?
"Qs is a 100 usd , maybe a 1000 usd Stock, if the batteries will work and produced in big scale.For me the best bet in battery technology.Also a good bet and cheap…. Varta in Germany."
"There are several posts about who the 2nd car manufacturer is. I am curious about the answer too but it doesn't matter at all. No matter who it is, this is a top 10 manufacturer and the significance of this partnership is obvious."
"If my math is correct. You better buy now!!!!!Be warned! This is going to explode to the upside!Aug 16, 2021 ==================>> They reported it already completed a 200 cycles successfullyJul 27, 2021 ==================>> announcing the beginning of 10 layers testing= 18 daystesting: One cycle(charge plus discharge) takes 2 hours= 12 cycles in 24 hoursgive and take there are 20 days between July 27 and Aug 16th. Mr Jagdeep reported that the 10 layers performs 200 cycle successfully on Aug 16thToday is Sept 28.That means from Aug 16 to Sept 28th we have = 15+28= 43 days43 X 12 cycles= 516then add the 200 cycles already announced on Aug 16, 2021.Therefore, we can fairly say that= 200 +516= 716 cycles already performed in the 10 layers testing.I think next week they will announce that they completed successfully above 800 cycles on their 10 layer testing and that is going a big news.The above is my analysis and I am confident from what I see the stock is going to be above 40 next week!do your own analysis please"
$0.15 jump last 5 minutes???
Today is another green day
"""Farley on Tuesday took a subtle shot at GM, which has set a goal to become all electric by the middle of the next decade.'We’re not talking about aspirations, we’re doing it,' Farley said on Bloomberg Television. 'We’re a show company, not a tell company. We have iconic vehicles, we’re betting on the good stuff, electrified Mustangs, electrified F-Series.' ""------That statements sounds like GM might be looking forward to next-gen battery makers in contrast to Ford to working with traditional battery makers and that *could* mean GM working with QS. Just speculation, but as the list of battery partnered OEMs grows it leaves fewer options for who QS's second Top 10 automaker could be. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-27/ford-sk-building-11-4-billion-electric-truck-battery-plants?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=211002&utm_campaign=sharetheview&sref=gSHcFQOt"
"Seeking alpha article “I believe that QS has the chance to change the landscape of the EV world.

QS = Quite Spectacular
Great volume for just 1 hour trading on a UP day.
Great day! This is fun.
"The future news coming out of SQ will be like nuclear fusion, it would blast trillions mega tons of energy fueling the stock price. One day appreciation would be more than ten times of the initial purchase price. You need to be patient and not yield to the whims of daily market fluctuations."
"My target for Quantumscape is $100 by early 2022. But end of 2022 to early 2023 will be $200. Solid Power target is $50. By 2023, Solid Power will be $100."

Could they have contract with tesla?
Thank you all for the opportunity to buy this low.Just sold 1000 shares of TESLA and all in QS at 22.85
Make sure to tune in for latest updates from the Virtual Conference on EV Engineering. October 18-21. https://chargedevs.com/newswire/with-backing-from-vw-and-jb-straubel-quantumscape-stands-out-from-the-crowd-of-new-ev-stocks/
Breaking News : Coming out Soon About QuantumScape The leader in battery technology
"The 2nd top 10 OEM's deal is a huge endorsement of QS. It's more convincing than 3rd party tests as they put actually money to buy 10MWh of the QS0 capacity. The short reports from Scorpion is destroyed. This is a highly confidential industry where QS can only share very limited information public to protect against competitions and copycats. QS is also progressing well on 10 layer testing. From 1 to 4 to 10 layers, they proved they can maintain the performance level making multilayers. From 10 to 20 or 40 is less challenging from making 1 to 4 or 10 layers. QS is very close to real product and once its starts the commercial production, it'll be easily a company of $200B market cap as it will disrupt the whole EV industry and consumer electronics. Imagine batter is never a constraint with cars, with iPhones, with any other things in your daily lives. Before that, I would put $50B as a more realistic 12 month target and that translates to $120 per share. Good luck longs."
Qatar took a 4.69% stake in QS post IPO - reported Aug 21st.
Any prediction on the stock price after the Oct 26th announcement?
picked up another 10 shares at $27. not much but trying to get as much as possible without going into debt
"""The solid-state pilot plants are on their way, and we will all get what we've been waiting for - Pre-production data of larger cells"" Avicenne Energy U.S.And the leader in the space is QuantumScape as no other company has quite a revolutionary SSB as theirs.My opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape."
Shorts can't afford to let QS close in the green. There is selling pressure in the last 30 minutes of trading nearly every day. Any positive PR will push the price much higher.
Accumulate under $30.00 …in four years I expect triple digits if (IF) QS can demonstrate successful 10 layer execution ..
https://youtu.be/NtyaLO_BrFQ
How many layers are needed in order to produce a car battery?
Can’t stand this board now nothing but bots￼￼
"Their batteries will evolve for other applications like home power walls, industrial/commercial, public transportation, power grid, military and so on. This will explode up soon. PR will showcase progress."
this is top notch tech company. we enter EV era and solid state battery cells are here to stay.
BEV have a weight problem maybe QS can help them go on diet
9-21-2021 QuantumScape has signed an agreement with another top-10 global auto manufacturer.9-22-2021 Redwood Materials and Ford Motor Company Announce Strategic RelationshipJ.B. Straubel is founder of Redwood Materials and is on QS Board of Directors
Does anyone know when we should expect 10 layers results?
Mikolajczak Celina awarded Class A Common Stock of 85251
Good Buying Chance!QS $300!!!
"$WIMI $QS $TLRY Limited downside, huge upside !!!!"
"Why would they sign a 10 year lease for 200,000 square feet at 1710 Automation Way in San Jose? That's on top of the 87,000 sq ft they already have on Technology Drive. That's a committed move. Also, by 2024 the company plans to build a large-scale factory at an undecided location as a joint venture with Volkswagen. Sorry, but batteries are comming."

All the way up 
"QuantumScape recently announced that the company has built and begun testing their first 10-layer full-sized cells – ahead of their targeted date of year-end and only 8 months after publicly unveiling the first data set on their single-layer cells. Initial results revealed performance data that is substantially similar to past successful trials on single- and 4-layer cells.CEO Jagdeep Singh describes the test data as “encouraging early 10-layer cell cycling results – now at 200 cycles with >96% capacity retention at 1C/1C and 25 degC, generally in line with what we’ve seen for our single- and four-layer cells.”"
Just bought in lightly will add to position if it stays positive.
"Another low volume day and shorts taking the advantage like the last 3 trading sessions. When qs rallied from 20’s to almost 29$ in a week, the volume was up to 44M. Today it is just over 6M 40 minutes before the close. Friday was 5.75M and the day before around 8M volume, all declining days are significantly lower than the other days.As a long, I have experienced many similar days before. Specially now QS is rising after good news and updates, and while sinking for no reason, I have zero concerns. I consider this as a borrowed money by shorts, and if I wait enough it will be paid back to me with the highest interest in my opinion.Just waiting for some good updates in October and rest of the quarter. Then I will still be holding QS of course, but my account value will put a big smile in my face every time I look."
"Wow, thought for sure today would be a give back day, but green again. Man, would NOT want to be short this stock."
QS is up most sessions nowadays. up strongly in some sessions even. not bad at all
"Short interest increased during the last 2 weeks in September from 35,800,000 to 36,020,000 (18.6% of free float). Which means Scorpion is still holding on. The main reason why the stock dropped from $40 to $20’s is only because of them and once they exit, it will go back to that price and more. They have to realize that downside is much more limited compared to the upside at this point. All they’re doing now is losing money paying interest on the shares that they borrowed. With recent confirmation that successful progress is being made with additional layers and other parties taking notice, I would not be surprised that shorts start to cover. The next couple of weeks will be very telling."
10 xNuff said
QS the disruptor
Like all MikeT id's yahoo no one cares about thumbs
Is today the big green day?
Are the securities awarded to Celina Mikolajczak VP of Manufacturing and Engineering linked to goals achieved in establishing QS-0?
Apple maybe a player here. Apple took a $1 billion investment in DIDI. Google it.
Normally analysts should step in now to update their pricing target based on the material development with 2nd top ten car manufacturer. It's interesting to see why there are still no actions from the analysts.
Is QS trending on Reddit?
Jeff the cartoon clown who is MikeT you ever delete one of my posts again I will get you the yahoo spammer banned forever. Verizion now owns yahoo and I know someone that works there I will and I promise to takeaway the only thing you have in life being a yahoo troll.

"Once it reaches 30, expect 60 in a few days.."
We bet QS shares on the future of their solid state technologies. BUT Tesla 4680 shows that it will also work differently. Another and simpler technology.It's a question. I'm thinking of selling QS. Some ideas?
"WE Need to get MikeT banned from yahoo He has stolen the Qs board and now made it the MikeT clown show board Enough is enough people Rpeort all his posts even on other boards,"
I am seriously considering increasing my position tomorrow. Maybe the last opportunity at these prices.
Picking up now guys 
"Longs very good news, I am from Germany and VW is speaking about scaling up battery production and about that the batteries from QS definitely working."

"Hope Quantumscape up big will help Solid Power Dcrc go to $50. Let's get solid state battery sector going up together,"
So much for momentum
"Ev companies will need newer technology,just like in smartphones. Better tech means better product,better product means higher position compared to rivals."
