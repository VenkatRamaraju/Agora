These batteries will make all other batteries currently on the market obsolete including Tesla￼
Time for a class action suit against Scorpion capital for defamation and spreading lies on QS
Got in at $29.05. Hopefully gaining profit soon.
don't you see sb bought 3.3m just after hour?
after hour will be huge. People will read the news wk and come back Monday with 10% higher.
"If someone had told be to put 25k into Tesla 10 years back, I'd prolly told them to take a long walk off a short cliff. Now at 180 times that price, 25k would be 4.5M, Geez! Maybe QS can, one day, do something similar, that would be about 65 times its current price of $28."
"Minimum criteria for SSB development reached easily by QS. 800 cycles x 300 miles = 240,000 miles. 80% of charge retained after degradation. SSB is Safe from fire. It can retain up to 80% of its charge under minus 30 degrees. Charged much faster. Who can overtake QS technology and its patents accumulated over a decade? When testing is independently done on QS SSB cells under minus 30 degrees, there will be no competition for another decade."
30 today is possible
The only way for other auto manufacturers to beat Tesla is to use Quantumscape batteries.
"Suddenly, major battery makers are scrambling to find SSB developers to help them. I do NOT think TESLA will just look the other way."
QS is ready to breakout!
next week $50
"Qs is a 150 usd Stock, we will see a faster up than Tesla did."
"Wow, 34M shares changed hands. Big money taking a position. Finally some appreciation for what’s been accomplished. Once the 10 layer package has been fully tested out to 1000 cycles it will be off to the races."
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
Fair warning! Last day to buy QS under $29-30
Everyone wants this company to be successful.
Easily $100 plus stock in quick time
"To all bears: I dont think you understand how this works. If the company did not show demonstrable progress, I, biggest skeptic of all, would've exited my position.Cautious skepticism of science & experimentation, not time slicing current results without understanding where the company is heading.We don't look at our feet when we walk, do we? We gaze at what lies ahead."
Monday will be interesting...Great to see some decoupling with general market.
"I have followed QA very closely over the past few months and was amazed at so many contradictions. Monosyllabic interviews, mysterious imprecise statements, sometimes an almost arrogant information policy, almost to the point that only a “fake product” comes into question. What if we're all completely wrong? About the facts that have allowed me to mature a theory that sounds so crazy and yet is the most logical. 1. QS is not taking legal action against ScorpionCapital's allegations 2. Celina Mikolajczak is moving from Toshiba to QS in 05/21. This is Musk's confidante, who is “parked” at the cell supplier for Tesla in order to strengthen the strategic influence ... and without a ban (competition clause). 3. A second automobile manufacturer in the top 10 blocks 70% of the samples from the QS0 production line 4. The Board of Directors announced in October that 1 TW will be produced by 2030, which corresponds to the annual output of 10 GW production facilities 5. Musk and Diess “cuddle” together so intensely that Musk even leaves a greeting at a VW management seminar. And suddenly everything fits together: My hypothesis: The cell was finished a long time ago, in the final version. There is too much scrap and, when it comes to scaling, it is still in the process of finding QS deliberately avoids legal disputes, as the technology would inevitably have to be disclosed in court proceedings The top 10 manufacturer can only be Ford (5%), GM (10%) or Tesla (85%), excluding the competition information; all others are eliminated. After consultation between Diess and Musk, Mikolajczak switched to QS in order to advance the scaling. VW and Tesla have reached an agreement on equal participation. This will be disclosed before the next capital increase (capital requirement> 8 billion euros) is due ... This capital increase is only possible when the market value is well over 20 billion USD, which would correspond to a share price> 100 USD. My assessment: In the next few weeks, QS shares, driven by “unusual purchase options”, will run up to 80 USD, in order to then announce the disclosure."
Is Barron's writing for short sellers? I just read their latest article about QS and just found it really strange. Anyone feel the same way?
think to triple within a year
I think it is GM. With the mess they are in right now they realize current batteries are a huge liability

Look at the volume. Some serious buyers coming in to QS.

"if we are so sure QS will moon by the end of the year, and I have 5K to throw at it, what would be the best more to profit from it?"
Congrats to all fellow longs who also held through yesterday's drop.
36 million shares short - LMAO! BIG volume today and short covering. More news coming....be patient!!!
Thoughts on Solid Power and it's potential to bring a solid state battery to market first?
"GreatTesting News • 800 cycles — roughly equivalent to 240,000 miles driven for a 300-mile range vehicle and demonstrates the battery technology’s ability to perform over a vehicle’s expected lifetime • 25 °C — operating at room temperature, as opposed to elevated temperatures (e.g., 60-80 °C), shows the robustness of a battery’s power capability • 1C charge/discharge rates — indicate that the battery can operate at continuously high charge and discharge rates with minimal degradation (with energy retention maintained at more than 80%) over a long period (800 cycles in this case) • 100% depth of discharge — the battery was fully charged and discharged every cycle of testing, which is typically more strenuous on the battery than shallower charge and discharge cycles • 3.4 atmospheres of pressure — this amount of pressure is sufficiently low for automotive applicationsMobile Power Solutions is an independent battery laboratory, ANAB accredited to ISO/IEC 17025:2017, based in Beaverton, Oregon."
Could the second top 10 Oem by revenue be Tesla?
I think Ford it's the second OEM!
I’m surprised it’s only up 10% so far. 500% more to go
"I highly recommend reading QuantumScap's Form 424B3 QuantumScape Corp . Totally transparent company in my opinion as it lays out everything including risks. But has QS state ""Our team of over 475 scientists, engineers, technicians, and other staff is highly motivated and committed to solving these challenges ahead """
"Wow, but just a beginning. Every where I look they have much higher median target price, except few who may be short."
"Their 10 cell 1c chart very interesting.1 Cell Chart have wider band (Clearly testing with many more cells to test consistency.4 cell within 1 cell blue lines10 cell, 1 line within 4 cell green line, 1 line above green and blue line.They mentions improvement just before so is second 10 cell test doing way better. I think either better quality or improved cell. Either way it show how they are ahead by years."
Think about it. The battery in an EV is the most important part of the system.If QS does succeed the sky is the limit as this is just the infancy of the technology.This will eventually be worth more than microsoft or apple or amazon.Good luck
"What are your guys' price targets for the end of the year. Personally, I predict $40."
