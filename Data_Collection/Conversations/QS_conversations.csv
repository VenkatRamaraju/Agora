"There is only one game in the solid state battery world. And it is unquestionably Quantum Scape. The so call leader, Toyota, now admits the need to develop new electrolyte materials because of a gap in the anode! This tells me that QS was right all this time about unrealistic pressure on these sulfide systems. They are basically back to square 1! All the stars have lined up for QS to take over."
Really like that QS is setting higher lows. Shorts can still push it down but they apparently cannot break below those new lows. Institutions and retail investors are buying in to the possibilities of The. Next. Big. Thing.
"QuantumScape Production Superstar Celina plan to dominate EV’s!“I think about making cells and manufacturing at full scale like playing a symphony,” Mikolajczak told Insider. “Everyone has to have their parts while getting everything in sync, so that everything comes together properly. It’s difficult. It’s something that a lot of people underestimate. To support the kind of volume of a vehicle, you have to make millions of cells a day.”Mikolajczak emphasizes the importance of artificial intelligence and automation in producing at such a high volume, and plans to marry that with a robust quality-checking system to minimize the margin of error – even down to having a sharpening schedule for the blades that cut the cell materials.“I think about making cells and manufacturing at full scale like playing a symphony,” Mikolajczak told Insider. “Everyone has to have their parts while getting everything in sync, so that everything comes together properly.

"Glad I bought on the dip (low $19) last week. I also went out farther in time with some call options (Nov 19 expiry). Last week, I bought the Nov $30 calls just as a kind of placeholder. Today, I cashed those out at a profit and applied the proceeds to purchasing same-date $25 calls. The $25s were a much better value, and the odds are better that QS will reach or exceed $25 than the odds of it reaching or exceeding $30 in the next 12 weeks. Even so, I think there is a very good chance that QS will re-test the low $30s again before the next earnings release."

Remember ENPH did not receive mass adoption till 2019...same thing is gonna happen with QS. I do agree that the rise to 130 was not rational...but now is a defn good speculative bet that they will be maker leader."

These are Stanford scientists. “Company’s stock price increases to $60, which would be approximately a 171% increase from the closing price on September 7, 2021 of $22.18. “. It should be 271% instead of 171%. I hope the got an intern to write this up since they’re too busy."

"￼Still Here, Despite the CriticismYou’ve got to hand it to QuantumScape. Even in the face of stinging criticism from Scorpion Capital, the company is still here and as bold as ever.The company’s latest investor presentation offers a handful of statistics to remind the naysayers that QuantumScape is here to stay: • Founded in 2010 (the company’s not a flash in the pan) • Around $2 billion of capital investment • More than 400 employees (this isn’t some back-office operation) • Over 200 patents and patent applications (intellectual property can be highly profitable) • QuantumScape’s batteries enable a fast charge in less than 15 minute fast charge (0% to 80%)Furthermore, here’s a tidbit from QuantumScape’s second-quarter 2021 shareholder letter: this company is far from broke/insolvent.In fact, the company ended the second quarter with over $1.5 billion in liquidity. Moreover, QuantumScape expects to start 2022 with more than $1.3 billion in liquidity.Batteries to Power the FutureThere will also be some folks who assume that QuantumScape isn’t earning any income at all. That’s actually not the case. For the three months ending on June 30, 2021, QuantumScape generated net income of nearly $81 million.So, while the company did struggle with a net loss a year ago, that’s certainly not what’s happening today.Yet, that wasn’t necessarily the most intriguing aspect of QuantumScape’s shareholder letter. There’s a possible breakthrough afoot, it seems, as QuantumScape had made, and is currently testing, the company’s first 10-layer cells.Apparently, QuantumScape had previously set a goal of showing results from 10-layer battery cells by the end of 2021.Hence, it’s encouraging to see that the company is already announcing its first 10-layer cells, perhaps ahead of schedule. Obviously, the introduction of 10-layer cells would represent a quantum leap over the four-layer cells for which QuantumScape produced test results in February.Patience is advised, as it appears that this will be an ongoing, multi-year process:“We will seek to continue to improve the performance of the 10-layer cells through the rest of 2021 … [and] demonstrate several dozen layers in 2022 and produce test cells for vehicles on our QS-0 pre-pilot production line in 2023.”14 STOCK PICKS FOR THE $12 TRILLION 5G REVOLUTION￼The TakeawayAs always, patience and forward-thinking vision will be key to success as a QS stock investor. Don’t expect to see immediate results from QuantumScape’s battery technology. Innovation is a process, and it takes time to develop.Granted, there are people who will continue to criticize QuantumScape, and they’ll point out the risks of owning shares in the company. The risks are duly noted. However, if you’re willing to hold on to a moderately sized position in QS stock long enough, the returns could be considerable"
"QS will be the only SSB maker in a couple years. With that, it's interesting to watch the games that are being played with the share price. Supposed longs with stops. They aren't really investors but traders and they will one day be sorry with the upcoming news."
I'm realistically thinking to buy 5000 shares and look at my account in 2025. Just trying to figure out the timing and quantity to buy. Any experts can tell me how to average in. I owned this when it was KCAC and sold at 37.00. I like the company and the future of EV's and believe this company will play a huge role.

"QS wants to issue a ton of new ""executive incentive"" stock options. This is after Jagmeet is already a billionaire with his previously issued stocks (he alone gets about 50% of the new stock). This is American Greed writ large. Shareholders should vote against the proposal at the general meeting. Other executives are individually worth $100s of millions of dollars based on already issued stock and options. And don't be swayed by the numbers they are posting now as to their stock holdings - they have already distributed millions of their options/warrants to family members and controlled trusts. I love the company but this is just too much."

the science behind solid state battery is in play with Quantum-Scape getting closer to a debut......the 4 layer cell is having a strong positive feed-back while the 10 layer cell is advancing at a faster pace than anticipated......this while the stock is hovering at a 52 wk low = buying opportunity....
anyone else think QS now on its way back to 30?
Rumor is Apple is looking to work with QuantumScape Time to make a lot of money
trend reversal?
Just my hunch and opinion I think they already Tested many layers of cells probably over 100 of layers just to get a rough idea on how they perform but aren’t reporting the results because they were not done under the Full scrutiny of the sec . But their calculation in a rough way shows it’s working That’s way they filed the latest sec document That’s why qs-0 makes sense. I think qs is not Hyping their results because maybe they don’t need toI think they got their hands on the holy grail Any thoughts?
"QuantumScape’s CEO Jagdeep Singh has said no other competitor has released as much data on their progress as they have, while trying to protect their parents.I agree as when was the last time you heard and news from Toyota , CATL , Samsung or Solid Power on their solid state battery progress. It’s been crickets!"
only game in town for battery is QS and rivian is going to need a lot!
"QS does not earn money, nor do they have a product at this point so it's the shorts vs the longs at this point. major investors are on the side lines waiting for QS to deliver the first prototype to VW. when they do and VW throws their holy water on it. the stock will take off, because no one and I mean no one had a solution that will rival IC automobiles. solid power doesn't harvsrd doesn't mit doesn't. Toyota doesn't. do your homework and have patience, in 6 to 12 months those who stayed long will be rewarded."
"Toyota Investors briefing on batteries and carbon neutrality . Toyota is a great company but it appears in this presentation their SBB may have failed as they tested it in a car.

QuntumScape now has 400 very talented full time employees and bringing on more.
"Was reading an article on how is current battery makers adopt QS, it cuts out many layers of production and thus you can essentially double capacity without increasing capital costs. Amazing science they have going on here. I suspect Elon is looking here which is why he has been very quiet. Also remember Elon is a Frenemy of VW...also remember Elon's key man is on QS. Also remember lots of VW employees going to QS. Read between the lines, be the shark at the poker table not the fish. Stack our bets because once the news starts to break it will be one of the most wild rides in the market."
"Selling about 60% of his holdings. That is good news, right?Insider Sell: Quantumscape54 minutes agoPublished 54 minutes agoMT Newswires09:23 AM EDT, 09/17/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Timothy Holme, Chief Technology Officer, on September 14, 2021, sold 739,106 shares in Quantumscape (QS) for $15,559,445. Following the Form 4 filing with the SEC, Holme has control over a total of 595,070 shares of the company, with 595,070 shares held directly. The market value of the direct and indirect holding, based on the transaction price, is approximately $12,443,449."
"I think QS management knows what the company can do.This is in yesterday sec filingPerformance-based Stock OptionsThe EPA Program provides stock option grants to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Jagdeep Singh, and other members of the Company’s management team that are earned over five tranches if the Company meets pre-defined stock price targets and business milestones. Each of the five tranches requires that the Company achieve both the next stock price target and one of the business milestones listed below within nine years of the initial grants. Participants generally have to remain with the Company for one year after the date a tranche is met in order to vest in the stock options earned with that tranche.For example, the first tranche of the EPA Program cannot be met unless the Company achieves at least one of the business milestones and the Company’s stock price increases to $60, which would be approximately a 171% increase from the closing price on September 7, 2021 of $22.18. Similarly, the fifth tranche cannot be met unless the Company has met at least five of the business milestones (including the business milestones used to satisfy each of the four earlier tranches) and the Company’s stock price increases to $480, which would be approximately a 2,064% increase from the closing price on September 7, 2021.The stock price targets are $60, $120, $240, $360 and $480. Assuming a beginning stock price of $26 (based on a 30-day average for July 2021) and approximately 415 million shares outstanding as of June 30, 2021, these stock price targets correspond approximately to market capitalizations of $25 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion, $150 billion, and $200 billion, respectively.Each tranche requires completion of a business milestone that was not used to satisfy a prior tranche. The business milestones are: (i) Automotive original equipment manufacturer validation of a completed B sample battery cell (a B sample is a functional, complete battery cell prototype that may be built with pilot tools). (ii) Delivery of at least 1 GWh of battery cells to a single customer. (iii) Delivery of at least 1 GWh of battery cells to each of three or more customers. (iv) $5 billion in revenue over a period of trailing four quarters. (v) $10 billion in revenue over a period of trailing four quarters. (vi) Total cumulative production of 500 GWh. (vii) Total cumulative production of 1,000 GWh. (viii) Adjusted EBITDA margin of 25% over four consecutive quarters. (ix) 10% of worldwide market share in automotive battery cells, excluding China. (x) 20% of worldwide market share in automotive battery cells, excluding China."

The clearinghouse had produced around 800k shares extra to clear this fails to deliver. The sec will watch this brokers who are cooperating with this imposters and they will be punished with lawsuits ."
The huge technical milestone is getting closer at Warp Speed. To move from 10 to more layers should be a small step.

"What's the next big annoucement can we expect from QS?A team from Harvard recently reported that their lithium-metal SSB can be charged and discharged at least 10,000 times. A similar way could be easily applied to QS SSB since lithium-metal is used as anode in both Hardvard lab and QS designs. Note that Solid Power uses carbon/silicon as anode, and sulfide as separator. I believe testing result of 2000 cycles for single layer will be announced before the end of 2022. then 10K cycles in 2024 with Q-3 for energy storage.Other OEM partners will be reported later in 2024 during Q-0 testing."

Chevy Bolt Fires Has Battery Industry Scrambling To Ensure EV Safety https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2021/09/17/chevy-bolt-fires-has-battery-industry-scrambling-to-ensure-ev-safety/amp/All roads point to solid state batteries and the leader in that space QuantumScape. OEM’s cannot develop a long term EV roadmap with unsafe battery technology.My opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape
Expect good news.
From the horse’s mouth : “The delay suggests that the 4680 battery cells that power the Cybertruck are still far off from mass production.”
"From what I understand QuantumScape is a blind bet.They might be up to something, or not and never will.Are there any recent developments?"
"From Reuters:Explainer: How will solid-state batteries make electric vehicles better?BY Reuters— 6:17 AM ET 09/07/2021By Tim Kelly and Sayantani GhoshTOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Solid-state batteries could be game changer for electric vehicles (EVs) by storing more energy, charging faster and offering greater safety than liquid lithium-ion batteries, helping accelerate the shift away from fossil fuel-powered cars.HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT FROM LIQUID LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES?Solid-state batteries use thin layers of solid electrolytes, which carry lithium ions between electrodes.Lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries use liquid electrolytes and have separators that keep the positive electrode from coming in contact with the negative electrode.Currently, solid-state batteries are used in devices such as pacemakers and smart watches.Mass market production of these batteries for EVs is three to five years away, experts say.WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF SOLID STATE BATTERIES?They are likely to be safer and more stable than liquid li-ion batteries in which the electrolyte is volatile and flammable at high temperatures. This makes electric vehicles that use li-ion batteries more vulnerable to fires and chemical leaks.Increased stability means faster charging and reduces the need for bulky safety equipment.They can hold more energy than liquid li-ion batteries, helping speed up a switch from gasoline vehicles to EVs because drivers would not need to stop as often to charge their cars.WHY IS IT DIFFICULT TO MASS PRODUCE SOLID STATE BATTERIES?Carmakers and technology companies have produced solid-state li-ion battery cells one at a time in a lab, but have been unable so far to scale that up to a mass production.It is hard to design a solid electrolyte that is stable, chemically inert and still a good conductor of ions between the electrodes. They are expensive to fabricate and are prone to cracking because of the brittleness of the electrolytes when they expand and contract during use.Currently, a solid-state cell costs about eight times more to make than a liquid li-ion battery, experts say.WHO'S TRYING TO MAKE THEM?Japan's Toyota Motor Corp ( TM Loading... Loading... ) is one of the front runners to mass produce solid-state batteries. It has said it is struggling with their short service life but still intends to start making them by mid 2020s.In addition to Toyota's ( TM ) in-house research, it has teamed up with Japan's Panasonic Corp ( PCRFF ) to develop these powerpacks with their Prime Planet Energy & Solutions Inc venture.Close on their heels, Germany's Volkswagen has invested in Bill Gates-backed U.S. battery firm QuantumScape Corp ( QS ), which aims to introduce its battery in 2024 for VW's EVs and eventually for other carmakers.VW says the battery will offer about 30% more range than a liquid one and charge to 80% capacity in 12 minutes, which is less than half the time of the fastest charging li-ion cells now available.Stellantis ( STLA Loading... Loading... ), formed in January by the merger of Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, has a venture called Automotive Cells Co with TotalEnergies and a partnership with China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL). Stellantis ( STLA Loading... Loading... ) intends to introduce solid-state batteries by 2026.Ford Motor Co ( F Loading... Loading... ) and BMW AG have invested in startup Solid Power, which says its solid-state technology can deliver 50% more energy density than current lithium-ion batteries. Ford expects to cut battery costs by 40% by mid-decade.South Korea's Hyundai Motor ( HYMLF Loading...

"when QS jumps, it will the jump of the century"
"This one sentence from Toyota’s Chief Technology Officer Masahiko Maeda explains why they are behind ""We are still searching for the best materials to use,"" he said”"
"Short interest went up an additional $1 million plus to 36,920,000. The number of days to cover increased to 4.1. Both numbers are all time highs. I’ve been noticing selling activity at the closing in most days lately, which in my opinion has been the short sellers strategy to bring the price down at the close. All we need is a big announcement. The 4.1 number of days to cover is a big number; we’re getting close to being noticed as a short squeeze candidate."

GM having mega problems with LG Chem. Sure would be nice if they talked to QS.
"QuantumScape's revolutionary SSB technology will become front and center to OEM's with the potential to power the move to mass adoption of EV'sReducing expensive recalls and having to advise customers not to park their EV in the garage because of battery fires, priceless!Oh! not to mention energy density, mileage range, better battery life, faster charging times, and a safer exprience.My opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape."
"Understandings VW is first in line to use a QuantumScape SSB but polling forum for opinions as to other OEM's you think may be second in line to reach out to make a deal with QS. GM , Rivian?"

"Check out Quantumscape latest SEC filing for Extraordinary Performance Award Performance program. The stock price targets are $60, $120, $240, $360 and $480 !I like its confidence."
"What I understand from today’s presentation in a nutshell; QS platform will not only be feasible for high-end expensive batteries, but also it will enhance the LFP for the low cost batteries and make it feasible to use. LFP advance is there is no suppy problem, no rare metals and it is the ultimate way when EV’s become mainstream and also be popular among cheap cars and commercial cars. I am sure there will be no demand issue in the opposite supply of QS will determine their revenue, but this platform can make QS also a sole supplier to other battery producers leading a much bigger market. Future seems even brighter."
"Realistically what is the upside of TSLA over the next 5 years? 50%? There will be so much competition in the EV space that TSLA has little room, especially outside the US. QS on the other hand is the TSLA in its infancy, the only difference is that once they are ready EVs have already taken off and solid state batteries have a gap to fill. Think of SSDs replacing the hard disks. So yeah, its still very early but QS for sure as 2-3000% potential and still would only make it a 200-300B company.I like my odds on retiring on a 50K investment."

No such thing as a #$%$ battery' unless Prof. Johnny B. Goodenough invents it. Despite all the 'breakthrough' announcements and promises Zip and Nada are all QS offers.
"if QS really is the holy grail of battery tech, we might be looking at a massive takeover coming very soon. I've never seen a chart this coiled in my life"
Just reported you new made today id Rise of the SpaceShips That file has to be getting pretty big'SEC.gov | HOMEwww.sec.gov
Looks to me Iike QS is under steady accumulation. Pretty soon those who use technical analysis to identify entry points will be jumping in.
"Classic Toyota move, they failed at SSB testing and then the CEO is like ohh yea we never meant to go this route, we're actually all in on the alternate fuel like hydrogen cell technology. Great pivot, not just like their Olympics debacle. https://cleantechnica.com/2021/07/25/the-great-toyota-zero-emissions-summer-olympics-debacle/ QS is the real deal and all these big guns are dusty and clearly see they will become Kodak or Polaroid of their industry and know they cannot invent fast."

"Solid Power, QuantumScape, and the Battle for Next-Generation BatteriesThought I would repost this Wall Street Journal article for new investors that opinions why QuantumScape is the more advanced solid state battery.“Essentially, QuantumScape is focusing on a harder-to-solve problem than Solid Power, with the potential for a more revolutionary solution. If the Californian company really has found a wonder material that enables lithium-metal batteries, it could become one of the next giants in an industry”“Lithium-metal anodes are the endgame in battery technology, but both companies have significant challenges ahead and are years away from mass production,” says Mark Newman, a battery investor and former Bernstein analyst”“QuantumScape has positioned its business model to capture more of the gains of any breakthrough, at greater capital cost. It plans to manufacture cells itself, whereas Solid Power’s approach is “asset light”“Solid Power is pursuing another electrolyte material called a sulfide, and may be further down the testing route than QuantumScape. But the results it published with lithium-metal anodes were disappointing, so it is working with a more conventional silicon anode as a first step” https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/solid-power-quantumscape-and-the-battle-for-next-generation-batteries-11623847059My opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape."

from the youtube video. it appears QS has the only tech out there and will dominate the market. Given the tam we are about 20-30x undervalued
"Why the big dip this morning , but buying more ."
"160% short on this stock, is that correct? is that possible?"
"Only 14 more days to October where it is very likely mid interim 10 layers data be out. Also, might even announce 30 layers just got started being tested. Or QS might wait to release such 30 layer testing during the earnings call since QS has no earnings but only with progress reports similar to a biotech. This time if there is good news on progress, stock should explode. Reason is we are approaching 2022 where prototypes are going to ramp up for car makers to sample and start driving them to test for commercial viability and safety."

"The lithium Ion battery was a great invention allowing for a mobile workforce and electric vehicles . However most experts believe it has reached it potential and solid state batteries are the future of EV’s. Companies like GM cannot risk their EV their brand and credibility on a lithium Ion battery platform.As more EV’s worldwide are put on the road the risk of fires will increase and recalls eat in profit.The recent recalls are hitting their bottom line and god forbid their is loss of life and law suits.This is not an acceptable option for well established brands like GM, VW, Ford, Toyota etc . They are going to invest in a battery platform that is much safer and that is SSB.Based on QuantumScape’s and the Korea Herald article sulfide based solid state battery technology will probably not be the one they choose for the reasons QuantumScape and the Korea Article outlined below. Specifically any fire risk .Sulfides don’t prevent dendrite formation and require external systems to maintain high temperatures and pressures, adding weight, bulk, and, most importantly, cost to the battery pack.Sulfides break down chemically when used in high-performance batteries.Sulfides produce hazardous gas when they come into contact with moisture.https://www.quantumscape.com/blog/the-problem-with-sulfides/https://www.google.com/amp/m.koreaherald.com/amp/view.php%3fud=20210803000641My opinion and why I’m invested in QuantumScape."

With QS you must place the bet, if it pans out we are going well over 1k a share...if not downside is only 20 dollars. The risk is to the upside!"
"As previously remarked upon, shorts have a lot of power to attack the share price, but as also previously noted, these ups and downs are essentially irrelevant and just trader gamesmanship. Only on real news one way or the other will significant action occur. So far QS has .et ot exceeded benchmarks and timeliness so my Position. Remains. Solid."
Perhaps I've just missed it but I've never seen any discussion of QS technology and why it may be a game changer. Anyone who is interested QS technology might want to read this review from the December edition of Motortrend magazine. Interesting! https://www.motortrend.com/features/technologue-solid-state-battery-frank-markus/

Based on recent interviews and presentations it seems like QS is pivoting from a complete battery manufacturer to a solid state separator supplier and manufacturer. I would not be surprised if full production and sales start earlier then anticipated and they let the other guys deal with deciding undecided chemistry needs of producing the rest of the battery.
10 layer cell is like foundation block. More layers can be made by mechanical ly stacked. Quietly loading 25 to 50 shares on dips.
JB building a huge battery facility. the QS ramp is beginning. I say 300-400 a share by end of 2022.
"Still crickets from QuantumScape's major competitors. In this interview with Solid Power's CEO he admits QS has achieved something beyond what they have in solid state battery technology.

"A potential disruptor of the battery businessWhereas the engine is the critical component of the gas-powered vehicle, the battery is the heart of the EV. QuantumScape (NYSE:QS) is a battery technology company working to bring a new type of EV battery to market.QuantumScape's battery is a solid-state lithium-metal battery, which is more energy-dense than traditional lithium-ion batteries, and the company claims it can be charged faster and last longer. The company also has more than 200 patents and applications pending, giving QuantumScape legal protection if the battery is as effective as it hopes it is.However, the battery is still in development, meaning the company is essentially ""pre-revenue"" and a riskier investment than both Tesla and ChargePoint. Furthermore, the commercialization of the battery is still several years away, with management expecting testing to begin in 2023 and a full launch in 2025. Investors should be aware that QuantumScape doesn't yet have a product and that buying the stock is a bet that promises turn into real results in the future."
QS is out performing the market!
