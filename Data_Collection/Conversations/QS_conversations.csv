I heard about QS the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Q: What exactly is different about QuantumScape's separator material?A: The QuantumScape separator material is a ceramic capable of meeting the key requirements of high conductivity, stability to lithium metal, resistance to dendrite formation, and low interfacial impedance. These are the key requirements to make a lithium-metal anode, which in turn enables high energy density, fast charge, and long life. The ceramic itself is non-combustible, making it safer than conventional polymer separators, which are hydrocarbons and so can burn. The formulation of QuantumScape’s material is proprietary, but it uses earth abundant materials with a continuous-flow manufacturing process, which we believe will make it cost-effective at commercial volumes.https://www.quantumscape.com/technology/faqs/"
"Why can’t they test multiple cells (10, 50, 100) simultaneously?? And accelerate progress??"
"QuantumScape’s CEO Jagdeep Singh has said no other competitor has released as much data on their progress as they have, while trying to protect their parents.I agree as when was the last time you heard and news from Toyota , CATL , Samsung or Solid Power on their solid state battery progress. It’s been crickets!"
I Think 10 layers should be enough for QS to offer this to samsung and apple!
"Most important words I have heard,1.We are competing with internal combustion engine2. If the battery is good then there is no need for government incentive for ev cars3. Fire hazard must be addressed Completely 4 we believe our technology got enough of a win that we can start toward mass production 4 in order for ev to go mainstream electric car needs fast charging 15 min or less5. I will not sell any of my stock, minus tax obligations , until we deliver working batteries to VW6. If third party test will calms some nerves then we will consider 3rd party Verification. 7. Range anxiety need to be addressed All these words came directly from the mouth of Jagdeep And yes fisker got caught stealing qs technology and they Quietly settle the case by paying $750,000 in fines to qsQs is the only player that got dendrites proof Ceramic separator consider the holy Grail of SSB. It took millions of test and over 10 years of research Any thoughts?"
GM just said there are multiple battery options out there while saying will continue with LG. once they get reimbursed from LG I bet they explore the alternatives. This has to be good for QS
QuantumScape has 400 employees and and amazing amount of highly technical jobs posted by https://jobs.lever.co/quantumscapeSolid Power lists 36 Employees as of June 2021 presentation and has 11 open positions https://boards.greenhouse.io/solidpower
"80% is goal and 4 layer 90%+ and ceramic characteristic mean we may have 1000’s cycle before degrade. Most important part is reliability and who want to save 10-20 bucks and deliver inferior product.All those silicon based batteries might run big problem with reliability and inconsistencies due to its characteristic.We know density growth in current batteries reaching limit, silicon is problematic, sulfide is problematic. Only holy grail exist is here. It will bring lot better future to us. Short can control and think we long retail will eventually give up but if they try cover it will take it back to 50’s easily."
This reminds me of Tesla when it was in the 30s. Patience will be rewarded on this gem.

"The lithium Ion battery was a great invention allowing for a mobile workforce and electric vehicles . However most experts believe it has reached it potential and solid state batteries are the future of EV’s. Companies like GM cannot risk their EV their brand and credibility on a lithium Ion battery platform.As more EV’s worldwide are put on the road the risk of fires will increase and recalls eat in profit.The recent recalls are hitting their bottom line and god forbid their is loss of life and law suits.This is not an acceptable option for well established brands like GM, VW, Ford, Toyota etc . They are going to invest in a battery platform that is much safer and that is SSB.Based on QuantumScape’s and the Korea Herald article sulfide based solid state battery technology will probably not be the one they choose for the reasons QuantumScape and the Korea Article outlined below. Specifically any fire risk .Sulfides don’t prevent dendrite formation and require external systems to maintain high temperatures and pressures, adding weight, bulk, and, most importantly, cost to the battery pack.Sulfides break down chemically when used in high-performance batteries.Sulfides produce hazardous gas when they come into contact with moisture.https://www.quantumscape.com/blog/the-problem-with-sulfides/https://www.google.com/amp/m.koreaherald.com/amp/view.php%3fud=20210803000641My opinion and why I’m invested in QuantumScape."
"Our 4-layer cells have now surpassed 800 cycles with >90% energy retention under uncompromised test conditions: 1C-1C, 25°C, 100% DoD, 3.4 atm — exceeding the energy retention spec of 800 cycles to >80% & achieving a major 2021 milestone Tim Holme (CTO) said “The four layer demonstrates everything working together because you’ll have cathodes in on some layers and anodes in on other layers. So all of the elements of the repeat units are here and to scale up to more multi layers you just stack these four layer cells on top of each other.”This may actually be the most important achievement yet. 800 cycle data was not completed before. This shows everything working together as a battery would. https://mobile.twitter.com/QuantumScapeCo/status/1430515394297614337"
"Great interview with a Caltech Professor on New Battery Technology. You get to understand why young people like Ms See entered this field. ""I saw the climate crisis and the issues that we have with our energy infrastructure. That’s why I ended up going to grad school: I saw chemistry as a way to help solve these problems"" https://www.pasadenanow.com/main/ask-a-caltech-expert-assistant-professor-of-chemistry-kimberly-see-on-new-battery-technology/"
"Glad I bought on the dip (low $19) last week. I also went out farther in time with some call options (Nov 19 expiry). Last week, I bought the Nov $30 calls just as a kind of placeholder. Today, I cashed those out at a profit and applied the proceeds to purchasing same-date $25 calls. The $25s were a much better value, and the odds are better that QS will reach or exceed $25 than the odds of it reaching or exceeding $30 in the next 12 weeks. Even so, I think there is a very good chance that QS will re-test the low $30s again before the next earnings release."
"QuantumScape's revolutionary SSB technology will become front and center to OEM's with the potential to power the move to mass adoption of EV'sReducing expensive recalls and having to advise customers not to park their EV in the garage because of battery fires, priceless!Oh! not to mention energy density, mileage range, better battery life, faster charging times, and a safer exprience.My opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape."
"Apple Car - 10 Years In, Tim Cook's Apple Still Has One More Thing https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/10-years-in-tim-cooks-apple-still-has-one-more-thing/ar-AANGkfm?ocid=uxbndlbing1st Question. Do you believe Apple would use a Lithium Ion based on GM's recent recall or a solid state battery in their EV? 2nd Question. Do you you believe they would use a sulfide based SSB solution or QuantumScape's revolutionary solid state battery that overcomes the sulfide issues? https://www.quantumscape.com/blog/the-problem-with-sulfides/QuantumScape’s Advantages""In contrast to sulfide-based approaches, QuantumScape’s sulfide-free ceramic separator has been shown to prevent the formation of dendrites under practical conditions; this previous blog post covers the conditions under which we test our batteries. Our separator is stable against the high-performance lithium-metal anode and does not produce dangerous byproducts if it touches water.These advantages improve performance, safety, and manufacturability, and are ultimately why QuantumScape is not using a sulfide separator. Though sulfides looked promising when we started our work a decade ago, and we investigated them thoroughly, we believe the obstacles faced by sulfide separators are incredibly challenging, and perhaps even insurmountable"" My opinion and why I invested in Quantumscape"
In my opinion there may be 3 super negative poster types on this forum.1. Have a stake in competing companies /technologies2. Paid shorts with multiple id’s3. Believe in QuantumScape’s technology but pushing to get the price lowerMy opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape.
"Ups and downs don't really mean much at the moment. Just traders pushing the price around. We are waiting for latest testing news, possible 3d party review, OEM interest, VW action. So many possible catalysts. Makes you feel sorry for poor old bears who are holding weak cards."

"Just like in the western movies;Quantumscape is out with its guns drawn and challenging ssb players to come out in The open and show what u got Just like in the Wester movies other players are hiding in the salons behind the table with heads down in fearLast week qs fired few shots at sold power. And sold power went quite , now it looks like their merger might not go through Today qs challenged them to show their battery test under real world temperature conditions,again heads are down behind the tables hiding hoping qs will go awayEven Big Gangster Toyota not coming out with any infoSeems like they all got nothing in ssb technology Looks like there is new cowboy in town and he’s asking for transparency I’m guessing these ssb players will come out slowly with their arms dangling heads down and with no weapons and Will accept defeatThat’s when the fireworks will startQs will pass 2000 fairly quickly hold your share as long as u canAny thoughts?"
"I Trust the expertsThe hardest part about making a working solid-state battery is the need to simultaneously meet the requirements of high energy density (1,000 Wh/L), fast charge (i.e., high current density), long cycle life (greater than 800 cycles), and wide temperature-range operation. This data shows QuantumScape’s cells meet all of these requirements, something that has never before been reported. If QuantumScape can get this technology into mass production, it holds the potential to transform the industry.—Dr. Stan Whittingham, co-inventor of the lithium-ion battery and winner of the 2019 Nobel prize in chemistryThese results blow away what was previously thought to be possible in a solid-state battery. Supporting high enough current density to enable fast charge without forming dendrites has long been a holy grail of the industry. This data shows the capability to charge to 80% capacity in 15 minutes, corresponding to an astonishingly high rate of lithium deposition of up to a micron per minute.—Venkat Viswanathan, battery expert and professor of materials science at Carnegie-Mellon Universityhttps://www.greencarcongress.com/2020/12/20201209-qs.html"
October mid interim data coming out. Do not sell.
"Don't need to wait much longer for need. October 10 layer interim test results coming out. September is almost here. Or better yet 300 cycle might be send out from Twitter. If looks good, stock should pop $2 buck. 400 cycle should pop stock up $5 bucks. 600 cycle could pop stock back up to $60 levels again. 800 cycle should see $100 levels."
"GM’s Chevy Bolt Recall Casts Shadow Over EV PushThe $1.8 billion recall, among GM’s costliest ever, underscores the difficulty, expense of fixing defective electric-vehicle batteries.https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/gms-chevy-bolt-recall-casts-shadow-over-ev-push-11630246736QuantumScape’s revolutionary new solid state battery technology is going to come into focus as they release further test information in the coming months. Big brands line GM are terrified in what these battery fires may do to their brands, never mind the cost to replace them $5000- $30, https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/gms-chevy-bolt-recall-casts-shadow-over-ev-push-11630246736 000.In my opinion there may be 3 super negative poster types on this forum 1. Have a stake in competing companies /technologies 2. Paid shorts 3. Investors hoping the stock price moves lower so they can jump in.As QS has publicly stated they have already completed the science and overcome the dendrites issue (below)with their patented separator . Their single cell passed all tests , charging time , density and mileage and now they are just scaling up towards production.HOW DO EV BATTERIES START A FIRE?Inside the batteries, lithium ions pass back and forth in a chemical solvent between the battery’s cathode and anode. The cathode and anode are divided by a separator, a porous layer that allows the ions to pass through it while preventing contact between the electrodes.In defective batteries, microscopic deposits of metallic lithium can build up in tendril-like structures called dendrites. The buildup can breach the separator, bring the cathode and anode in contact and create a short circuit that can lead to a fire”My opinion and why I invested in QuantumScape."
QS will pop to $30 real quick
I have 20k in this and will probably retire a millionaire or not from this stock.

"￼Still Here, Despite the CriticismYou’ve got to hand it to QuantumScape. Even in the face of stinging criticism from Scorpion Capital, the company is still here and as bold as ever.The company’s latest investor presentation offers a handful of statistics to remind the naysayers that QuantumScape is here to stay: • Founded in 2010 (the company’s not a flash in the pan) • Around $2 billion of capital investment • More than 400 employees (this isn’t some back-office operation) • Over 200 patents and patent applications (intellectual property can be highly profitable) • QuantumScape’s batteries enable a fast charge in less than 15 minute fast charge (0% to 80%)Furthermore, here’s a tidbit from QuantumScape’s second-quarter 2021 shareholder letter: this company is far from broke/insolvent.In fact, the company ended the second quarter with over $1.5 billion in liquidity. Moreover, QuantumScape expects to start 2022 with more than $1.3 billion in liquidity.Batteries to Power the FutureThere will also be some folks who assume that QuantumScape isn’t earning any income at all. That’s actually not the case. For the three months ending on June 30, 2021, QuantumScape generated net income of nearly $81 million.So, while the company did struggle with a net loss a year ago, that’s certainly not what’s happening today.Yet, that wasn’t necessarily the most intriguing aspect of QuantumScape’s shareholder letter. There’s a possible breakthrough afoot, it seems, as QuantumScape had made, and is currently testing, the company’s first 10-layer cells.Apparently, QuantumScape had previously set a goal of showing results from 10-layer battery cells by the end of 2021.Hence, it’s encouraging to see that the company is already announcing its first 10-layer cells, perhaps ahead of schedule. Obviously, the introduction of 10-layer cells would represent a quantum leap over the four-layer cells for which QuantumScape produced test results in February.Patience is advised, as it appears that this will be an ongoing, multi-year process:“We will seek to continue to improve the performance of the 10-layer cells through the rest of 2021 … [and] demonstrate several dozen layers in 2022 and produce test cells for vehicles on our QS-0 pre-pilot production line in 2023.”14 STOCK PICKS FOR THE $12 TRILLION 5G REVOLUTION￼The TakeawayAs always, patience and forward-thinking vision will be key to success as a QS stock investor. Don’t expect to see immediate results from QuantumScape’s battery technology. Innovation is a process, and it takes time to develop.Granted, there are people who will continue to criticize QuantumScape, and they’ll point out the risks of owning shares in the company. The risks are duly noted. However, if you’re willing to hold on to a moderately sized position in QS stock long enough, the returns could be considerable"

"Did QuantumScape Just Solve a 40-Year-Old Battery Problem?Posting this great article from last year. It’s amazing how much progress QuantumScape has made in testing of 4 layer and now 10 layer since that was published on single cel below.“QuantumScape’s performance data is impressive, but it comes with an important caveat. All of the test data was generated in individual cells that, technically speaking, aren’t complete batteries. The thin cell unveiled by QuantumScape is destined to be stacked together with about 100 others to form a full cell that is about the size of a deck of cards. Powering an EV will require hundreds of those stacked batteries, but so far the company hasn’t tested a fully stacked cell”https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wired.com/story/quantumscape-solid-state-battery/amp"
