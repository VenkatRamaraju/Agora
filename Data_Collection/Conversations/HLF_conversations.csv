"Fluteman, I was reading through some of the posts on this board over the last half hour.Did you write that you have a Short Position in HLF now?"
"AH's settlement of 1,028,300 shares, the entire day only had 400,000 volume. Stock was down, so I would assume there was a big seller that advertised."

Value Engine UPgrades HLF to strong buy from buy. No price target given.
with Icahn selling now and not buying and herbalie itself getting low on borrowed buy back funds what will hold herbalie up anymore?
Tasly and Herbalife are “pharmaceutical” companies.Ha! HaHaHa! HAHAHAHA!
How is the pyramid scheme still in business?

"will herbalie find some new accounting tricks for the 2nd quarter like they had in t 1st quarter?Herbalife’s (HLF) Accounting Trick To Beat Earnings GuidanceFrom accounting professor at Yale UniversityI take this opportunity to share with you what we discussed in class.Herbalife Nutrition’s (NYSE:HLF) headline news on the first quarter earnings of 2018 is that “Herbalife Exceeds High End of Reported and Adjusted1 Diluted EPS Guidance by $0.18 and $0.30, Respectively”. On the paper, this is a huge beat, but this beat is mainly driven by an accounting trick that Herbalife includes a huge tax benefit from employee stock program. Herbalife includes a tax benefit of $19.4 million in its first quarter earnings. This tax benefit arises because Herbalife can take a tax deduction when stock awarded to employees vests or when employees exercise their stock options. Employees are more likely to exercise their stock options when stock price goes up and when employees perceive stock price to be peaked. Such stocks and stock options were awarded to employees many years ago. The bottom line of this discussion is that tax benefit from employee stock and stock option program is not a result of a company’s business operation in the first quarter and thus should be excluded from its adjusted EPS. Conceputally, adjusted EPS (non-GAAP EPS) is meant to provide investors a measure of recurring earnings from a company’s operations by excluding one-time items or items that are not directly related to a company’s operation. Clearly, Herbalife should (but it does not) exclude tax benefit from employee stock program from its calculation of recurring earnings. Firms like Herbalife often exclude negative one-time items from its non-GAAP earnings but include positive one-time items there. As a scholar, I am very much concerned about such bad firm behavior.Another income included in the first quarter earnings that deserves investor attention is China government grant income of $16.2 million. China government grant is not an income that could be distributed to shareholders. Rather, it’s an investment that has to be made in China, often together with matched funds from the company. In that regard, it is a liability (grant received this quarter but to be invested later on). This China government grant increases Herbalife’s reported EPS by about $0.15 (=16.2*(1-31%)/76.3), where 31% is the effective tax rate. We can calculate the effective tax rate on China grant income as (reported tax expense of $9.2 + tax benefit of $19.2 discussed above)/pre-tax income of $91.5.If we stripe out tax benefits from employee stock program and China government grant, two one-time items, Herbalife would report an EPS of $0.676, missing its guidance by $0.224."
Lol after the documentary if the business model is true than come now it’s a pyramid scheme. I’m not picking sides everyone has their own agenda but come now.
"From the Tasly News Release...."" We are honored to form a joint venture with Tasly, a leading developer of health products and services in China. Our philosophies of improving the wellness of our communities are completely aligned and we expect this new joint venture will significantly expand the distribution of important nutrition products around the globe,"" said Rich Goudis. "" OF NOTE: "" Significantly expand the distribution of nutrition products around the globe "" I don't think the street has digested the meaning of this new venture that HLF has entered into with this large Chinese company."

"2 Big settlements after the Bell, 169,100 & 150,000 shares at near highs of the day. That was a buyer that the house needed to fill so they had to walk the SP up to fill the order. Was not a seller that came in with an order as I'm sure some short will claim, wouldn't have closed near the highs if that was the case. Tomorrow will be interesting."

"HLF cashed out their convertible bond issue on 8/15, so their balance sheet should look different next quarter. I think that it will be interesting to see what the outstanding share count will be and if they also decided to buy back some shares. The big boys likely know what will happen, but I doubt most retail investors understand the transaction as written in their disclosures. Carl commented last year that HLF had a lot of financial geniuses at the helm, and I wonder if he has changed his opinion lately..."

"What did Ackman say his maximum loss would be on HLF puts? $350 million? Make his losses somewhere near $1,350 million dollars now. FYI, his Chipotle is down 10% today. WOW"
It will be interesting to see if HLF pulled the trigger and bought back shares during this selloff. Perhaps they reacquired 5M at $40 instead of 4M at $50.
"Tex predicted $50 after earnings when he shorted those 30,000 imaginary shares @ $70.75, now its $98"

It will be even higher in 2018.Has HLF management really added shareholder value in 2017 or have they just manipulated the price?Anyone that thinks that Icahn would spend billions of additional dollars on an HLF buyout at nosebleed prices has not considered the fundamentals.

"Short thesis is pretty much the same as it's always been:-That it's a company that makes money by exploiting the poor and uneducated;- and that this is an unsustainable business model -that the FTC regulations has and will continue to limit it's ability to sell their product -that the market growth rate has diminished-that revenues are lower now then it's been in several years-that their balance sheets is showing a concerning rise in liabilities (and buy backs are not a long term solution that adds value to shareholders is my opnion)-that risk of China slowing them down is real-as well as continued legal challenges more significant than normal.so if anyone can share the long thesis as to why you think it's a good bet, would be appreciated. Thanks."
"Under the FTC order it requires Herbalife to drop its current system of rewarding distributors primarily for recruiting a “downline” of people who will buy the product at wholesale, without regard to whether there are customers out there who really want the merchandise. Under the new compensation structure, success in the Herbalife marketing program must depend on whether participants sell products, not on whether they can recruit additional distributors to buy products.Has this change happen yet?"
Alexander Amerezquita today joins Herbalife as a senior Vice President. He was recently with Moelis & company a leading global Investment Bank. He advised mergers and acquisitions. Anyone make the connection here?

"Here's what you need to know, HLF bet on Earnings, $1.29 vs .96, they also beat on Revenues $1.1 vs Expectations of $1.08B. They reiterated 2018 guidance of $4.60 - $5.00. Ignore the GAAP loss as that is a tax law accounting provision."

Ackman was right
"So why did Des Walsh not sell all 30000 option shares in the market and keep the cash, Why did he only sell enough to cover the tax liability and keep the rest? Go look at the history of top executives, they have been only selling enough to pay the expense and keeping the remainder, they have been right.

No word from Lilian today, now worries, Lillian shorted 700 shares at 99.90 or $69,930 invested, this investor claims to be willing to lose $50,000 before throwing in the towel. How many of you seasoned investors are willing to lose almost 100% of your investment before realizing you made a mistake? I mean come on, I almost fell out of my char LMMFAO when I read that........that sounded like an oldie but goodie that tex would post? interesting"
.......I have two cents that says the stock goes down from year end as funds try to reduce their exposure to HLF for year end reporting. They have to do it slowly with the thin volume. It will look good on year end statements to bank some profits.....
"Icahn sold at the 12/31 price of $48.05, and the current share price has indeed fallen since then. That means some institutions are concerned that his oversight is no longer in place. I guess that the new BOD crop are not up to the Icahn standard of controlling any rogue actions by HLF management. Disappointing."
"Herbalife Admits To Ongoing SEC & DOJ Investigation Regarding Its Largest Market: ChinaThe company is acknowledging ongoing “anti-corruption compliance” investigations from both the SEC and the Department of Justice.

"HLF says $1.5 billion made available on Oct. 2018 for share buybacks has largely not been used. Now they might use half of it prior to Aug. 11 to buy shares at not less than $45.xx and not greater than $50.00. And as recently as March, shares were in the 30s. No buyback then but now buybacks between 45-50? And this is good use of company cash? Why buy back shares at 30 when you can buy them back at 50. LOL"
"This stock proves to me how corrupt the market can be. Trading at a 46.74 PE ratio, shady news about the ceo, decreasing net income, multiple SEC investigations, and the stock doesn't move. All it takes is a billionaire or two to easily manipulate most stocks."

"""Carl Icahn Tendered Its Herbalife Shares Into The Co.'s Self-Tender Offer""Translated:HLF sacrificed the health of its balance sheet to artificially push up its share price, so shareholders and insiders can cash out their positions at high prices, leaving a company with no assets left to be seized in future lawsuits. This looks to be the stage of the party when the sober guests start leaving."
Notice how HLF again is staging (lowering the bar) for a dissapointing 4Q17.HLF now doing what they know how to do best...1)promise a return to growth for 20182) Put the focus on EPS (lol even though they took on a extra $1B in liability to raise that EPS figure) Watch the HLF loyalists try to ignore an awful qtr with the wishful thinking of a strong 2018 (just like hlf promised for 2017).
"someone will eventually make money shorting HLF, mind as well be me. I bought May 18th puts, let's see."
The fact that Icahn holds such a large steak in hlf is a negative. We all know that he will eventually cash out on these shares - this is historically what he's always done. just a matter of time (and that time seems to be coming close)So what will happen to all others who are left holding hlf when he exits? He is of course the most important factor keeping hlf shares up (certainly not up on hlf sales)really hlf is not what it once was. nothing exciting about this company anymore that indicates growth is coming. get out of this guys is my advice.

"oh good you're buying HLF here?What on hopes:- of an LBO (insiders have been selling their shares in DROVES)Why would they take on debt to buy it in an LBO. please explain.-Icahn will pay a premium on current price in a buyout?From my article on Icahn and $IEPhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4204828-herbalife-valuation-it-aint-till-overRead his precise statement when he sold 20 million shares (post-split, or 10 million pre-split) in the recent (May ’18) Dutch auction or tender offer by HLF. Note that Icahn’s intention to exit HLF is supported by the fact that he tendered his entire holding of 46 million shares in the tender offer, although only a quarter was accepted.Icahn's recent sale (May 25, ’18) points unequivocally to his stance on Herbalife:For almost six years, we have been one of Herbalife’s strongest, most loyal supporters; we stood by the Company through a half-decade long short-selling campaign; and we never sold a share, even after our investment doubled. But, given that our Herbalife investment has become an outsized position, representing approximately 24% exposure to total NAV, it is only prudent for IEP to reduce its exposure.IEP’s investment in Herbalife is a quintessential example of our activist investment strategy. In late 2012 and early 2013, when Herbalife was under attack and the stock was out of favour, we studied the business and assessed the risks. At that time, we concluded the risk/reward ratio was very favourable.The last sentence, is key: “At that time, we concluded the risk/reward ratio was very favourable”. By virtue of his $600 million sale in May '18, it is logical that Icahn now believes - after the dramatic appreciation since 2013 - that the risk/reward ratio now points to a reduction of, if not an outright exit from, Herbalife. In addition, in order to retain the tax status of IEP, he is forced to reduce his ""investments"" and increase his operated and controlled assets - this by April '19.""@player 21 you think Icahn will pay a premium on current price of $57?Icahn didn't become a global corporate titan from absurd decisions.He KNOWS HLF is cornered. If he makes an offer, it will be for about half the price of $30 per share.Watch this space. If he does that, he WINS in 4 ways:-he solves IEP's tax problem by controlling HLF-he exploits the trap on existing shareholders-he knows NOONE will buy his 35m shares, so he CANT sell them.-he gets a bargain, knowing it's POSSIBLY worth more about $40, if HLF can carry on duping the FTC.Watch this space."
"From Zerohedge: Prosecutors unsealed an indictment Friday in federal court in Manhattan, according to which Herbalife was charged with a China bribery conspiracy.Curiously, it was just a few weeks ago that Ichan also dumped a substantial chunk of his Herbalife stake, perhaps sensing that a storm was coming. The list of top HLF holders is shown below."
"Tex is right, I believe. There may be something else going on that happens to be coincidental with this news."
"HLF is facing competitions from other supplement manufacturers/re-sellers, including Nu Skin, Usana, GNC, etc... Furthermore, Icahn's unloading of his major stake holding indicated valuation of HLF has gotten rich, and much better investment alternative exist in the market. HLF like will see major DROP in second half of 2018, sell while you can..."
go long only if it holds $44...I would wait at least to $40 ~ $42 though.

About a week ago I shorted this with 700 shares at 99.90. I had my chance to take a profit when it drop below 99. Now it's back up and like I predicted it will go above 100. HOWEVER I believe this stock will go down from here. It's run its course and it's time for it to plummet.
"The volume point data released today is (by managements' statement) subject to revision. There will be a revision downward in the YOY final calculations. Management knows how to blunt the effect of lowered volume points by segmenting the negative news into smaller parcels. Also, when the North America figures get low enough, they will be folded into and concealed in another category or a new category. This is Herbalife's demonstrated way to obscure unsavory data. Fact Jack."
". Among other things, the business guidance explains how the FTC distinguishes between MLMs with lawful and unlawful compensation structures, how MLMs with unfair or deceptive compensation structures harm consumers, and how the FTC treats personal or internal consumption by participants in determining if an MLM’s compensation structure is unfair or deceptive. The guidance also addresses how an MLM should approach representations to current and prospective participants."
"Michael Johnson ADDS 114,673 shares to his personal HLF holdings, now at 2,172,314 shares which makes him the 12th largest HLF shareholder. I call that commitment to the company. Why would he keep adding to his holdings and not just sell out all his options? What does he see in the future?"

"I'll listen to the CC, but I'm not particularly impressed. These are about the numbers I expected, but with still 2MM extra shares outstanding and $75MM less net equity than I expected. Net profit margin is dropping like a rock, inventory down, PP&E down is disinvestment and milking the company to pay off Carl.How much is left in the stock buyback fund? What are the particulars for the S/T debt? Are these guys really the financial jeanusus that Carl said they were?"
Is anyone paying for overpriced supplements right now? Ouchie. Feel sorry for the down lines.
plus all my 2.01 thru .31 SNES SHARES ALL GREEN THIS MORNING
"Ahahahhah.""It will never hold 40"".lol"
Carl Icahn made sure the short seller Bill Ackman pays up. I never thought Icahn will hold this long after Ackman covered his short position.Now he too realized this is Pinzi Ackman was right.Gl!
I'm thinking 2018 could turn out to be another good year for HLF longs. 1) YOY comps should be easy to beat2) Management said they expect growth to return in 20183) New top end tax rate of 21% is significantly lower than the 32% they paid in Q3174) If the dollar weakens that could also provide some tailwinds.
So what's plan here? Buy at 106.30 and hope you can tender at $108?

"It seems like this is no longer the Herbalife Message Board. After putting most of Texhole's aliases on Mute, almost everything on my screen is the childish mudslinging between Fluteman and TexHole's alias, Or. They need to either grow up or get sober!"

"Icahn tendered 11.4M shares yesterday, at the last minute. He got 10.5M shares accepted for 550M dollars, out of total of 600M. The majority of other 38M tendered shares (49.7M - 11.4M) were not accepted. Either Icahn was super genius. Or, he had inside information so he knew what the exact tender price should be. I think this run of modified Dutch auction was an agreement between HLF and Icahn, designed specifically to allow Icahn to unload his shares with company borrowed money, and as an appreciation to his long time support."
"I claimed, and still do, Tasly products cure cancer."
Steady as she goes - UP!
"Failure to Prevent “Stacking” of Phony AccountsThe former Herbalife compliance employee also explained that it was the rule ratherthan the exception for top distributors to create phony stacked accounts in order toearn more commissions than is officially permitted under company rules.“Based on all of the qualification and requalification reviews that I conducted as aSenior Associate in the Compliance Department as well as the numerous investigationsI conducted, I discovered that every Chairman’s Club and President’s Team-leveldistributor that I investigated was engaged in some form of volume stacking.”When a group has been constructed out of phony accounts or is made up of individualsworking together as a financial unit, all the commissions effectively go to a singleentity. These extra commissions total approximately 47% of the retail price, or about63% of the amount the distributor has spent after receiving a 25% discount."
"Why this pre-cast of (expectedly bad) declining volume point (sales) news? So management can get out the message: ""IF YOU DON'T FAKE IT NOW, WE AREN'T GOING TO MAKE IT."""
I am still puzzled. How did HLF go from about $60 to $110 with flat revenue and flat net income?
All time intraday high. $83.64

"Apparently Icahn made some comments about Herbalife in CNBC interview yesterday. I can't get access, anyone see this? Is this why we got increased volume and buying late in the day?"
"* Company is repeatedly buying its own shares with this arcane modified Dutch auction, which seems designed to encourage the PPS into a range that is higher than its current price. Effectively they're buying a higher share price with their remaining cash (and borrowing)* A very large percentage of the company is held by insiders. .The float is very low, and will get lower as the company buys back shares.* From what I understand we're on the cusp of seeing the financial results under the new business model that came about as a result of the FTC settlementWhen you add this all up, it looks a lot like 11th hour financial alchemy to me. This could be a last push to get that share price up, before it begins reflecting the company's performance under the new model. HLF seems to be creating the conditions necessary for a short squeeze (low float, high PPS). Talk of going private, or actually going private, is going to add to this."
"the only thing growing at herbalie is its DEBT, and now looks like interest rates are headed back up, so they will have a hard time refinancing that 1.15 billion dollar bond coming due next year, they may have to reissue most of those shares they been buying back"
"I hardly think that with temporary mild single digit decline in guidance vs still decent continued growth that it deserves to be down 17% and lowest in over a year. 5-10% maybe for awhile, but not 17%. Yes, I’m now buying."
"CASH FLOW falling and debt going higher, and shuffling money adding more to borrowing cost, I smell BANKRUPTCY looming"
"I remember a Herbalife store in my hometown when I was younger, lasted like 5 months. After watching “betting on zero” it all makes sense lol"
Tomorrow will be down 8-9% as the sellers come out in full force...cheers!

"Judge Sides Against Ackman and Valeant in Preliminary Allergan Ruling Looks like Ackman going down in stock manipulation scheme regarding Allergan, next he goes down manipulating HLF stock with FAKE NEWS. Someone betting against the stock made a ton of money last Friday, option expiration day with the tape bomb fake news plant about Italy. Not a word or anything since then. Wake up SEC, Ackman is a manipulator in everything he does."
Congratulations to all longs. HLF will be the end of Pershing Square or Perishing Squirrel. This is the reason I do not short stocks.
$100 is looking really good!
"Looks like a high reward/risk short play. Take a look at the weekly chart, this thing is about to roll over."
"But, but, but six corrupted Italian senators want the government to scrutinize HLF.This willprobably send it to single digits.LOL"

"As an Herbalife independent distributor I can see great potential in Herbalife growth, my daily activity in the nutrition club gives me the sense of doing a more advance way to serve our customers than simply serving coffee as starbucks."
January 2017 saw a 15% increase in share price. Incase anyone was interested.
"This company has a $9,000,000,000 market cap, it's only an MLM for crying out loud! There's nothing special about their products, the supplement business has a lot of competition. This company should be trading at least half this market cap; but I do hope shorts get squeezed and push it higher so I can short it higher at some point."

"ZACKSBear of the Day: Herbalife (HLF)November 15 2017Herbalife (HLF - Free Report) has fallen into the cellar of the Zacks Rank recently as Wall Street investment banks continue to shy away from the network marketer of health and nutrition products.After the company reported Q3 results on November 2, and provided guidance for the coming year, SunTrust analysts lowered their 2018 full-year EPS estimate by 8%."
Herbalife approves 2 for 1 stock split. That was a given.
"If Icahn is selling, why should anyone be buying at this level?"
Sold my 1500 shares from $103.80 to $104.00. I have been mostly trading the stock daily and keeping some for a run to the split. This T/O at all time highs worries me a bit. Locked in all my profits and will wait. I could be wrong and miss some upside but you can't take my profits away from me now. I will be on the sidelines for a bit. I wonder if this is a way for Icahn to lighten his stake by a couple million shares. I would.
"“Some Nutrition Club owners continue to operate their clubs for little or no profit —or at a loss—for years, in the hope that things will turn around and their investment will eventually pay off. However, the promised retail-based business opportunity is simply not there.” FTC vs. Herbalife, Complaint, par 68."
"Longs have been using the Ackman short squeeze theory as a major reason to bet on hlf shares...it rightfully powered their position.Really you guys were right!..it was a great bet. Well deserved profit if you were long....but now with Ackman out, combined with hlf's dismal sales (stagnant at best), it's just not the same story anymore. I don't see the attraction to hlf anymore.Sell at the high 68 range, and then reassess and possibly buy back before 1Q18 earnings."
"Fluteman_Greg - You called me out and that was fine. You were long in this stock or basically you said you bought at 103 and sold at 105. Something like that. Regardless from the beginning I said I shorted this stock at 99.90,that it will go above 100 and maybe even hit 105. My impatience got the best of me because it even went up to 110 but still HELD ON! I told you my pain level would be 170 with 700 shares. That would have been 50K loss. I knew the stock split made it run up very high which was a sign that it would drop when it split. My position covered at 48.50 a few days ago. I'm NO LONGER SHORTING HLF. I am out."

The answer to the $3.5 billion in liabilities is that they bought more of their own stock at close to $70/share. LOL What a bargain.
"Hey all, I contacted Affiliated Monitors and here is the scoop. Their report is due 6 months after the order went into effect. Section 1, which is the part that applies, went into effect on May 15th, 2017. (exactly 10 months after the Settlement date). So the report from Affiliated Monitors is due with the FTC tomorrow, Nov 15th.Here is a snippet from their response. ""The Order does not provide the ICA with authority to release any report to the public. The decision on whether any part of the report will be released rests entirely with the FTC.""So it's wait and see what the FTC decides to do with the findings. I doubt we will see anything for a week or two."
Fluteman - How many lunch shakes do you get out of the $39 can of protein powder F1 shake mix you claim to drink every day? Make a case that anyone should pay that much for a shake --besides trying to help out a relative who has no legitimate job -- but thinks they'll get rich selling HLF...
time to start shorting ... calling Bill A. to let him know
Sold my 1000 shares of $68.60 at $70.60. Have 1000 at $70 and 1000 at $70.75 left.You keeping track tex or are you busy loading up on SNES that is now .69.

"Word of caution here folks......before jumping back into the long side fray, I went back to read the earnings transcript to look for any tidbits I may have missed when listening to the call. Earnings were good, guidance was good, growth coming back....All good stuff. The thing I picked up on was increased guidance, they said this increased guidance INCLUDED taking out additional stock with the $600 million Tender offer. Don't forget folks, this tender was for between $98 - $108, we are at $113. Who in their right mind will tender their stock between $99 - $108 when the stock is currently $113? If they can't buy back all that stock then their guidance is in jeopardy. If the stock drops back and they can get shareholders to tender their shares, then sky is the limit. Until that happens, I would caution on buying at these lofty levels. I'm just the news messenger, do your own DD."
HLF longs. Hold on to your shares! Don't throw away your shares by selling cheap. This was a great quarter!The .83 EPS was up 25.76% YOY and it clobbered analyst's estimates of.61revs were up 7.7% YOYand best of all a sales beat of $13M over what analysts predicted- Great Qtr
"The FTC’s allegations filed in Los Angeles federal court left no doubt that it concluded that Herbalife had been ripping people off: “Consumers have suffered and will continue to suffer substantial monetary loss as a result of [Herbalife’s] violations of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act.” (That's the section that bars ""unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.”)FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said after the settlement that ""Herbalife is going to have to start operating legitimately."" That would mark a real change, she suggested.To some extent, perhaps it did. Herbalife's come-on to distributors today says that they can earn money ""selling Herbalife products that you buy at a discount"" or ""sponsoring someone who either sells Herbalife products or purchases them at a discount for their own or household use."" It specifically says that distributors ""cannot earn money simply for recruiting or sponsoring someone."""
"Pershing Square Q3 update: PS lost 3.7% in Q3, S & P returned Positive 4.5%. Not sure why any investor would want to be involved with Ackman.Of note, PS's entire exposure to HLF is now in the form of PUTS, that is about 5% of PS's consolidated Capital. That seems like new info. that is more than previously said."
"Distributors can’t actually “sell” the product at the club; instead they sell a daily membership that entitles the customer to a shake (Herbalife’s Formula 1), a cup of aloe water, and a tea (served hot or cold, sometimes you can choose from 3 or 4 flavors) in styrofoam cups. A daily member typically pays somewhere between $5 and $7 in cash for the membership. Herbalife rules dictate that patrons can’t leave the club with these products; they must be consumed in the club."
"Can't wait till the real squeeze (short of course) takes hold, what a ride it will be!"
