"""Carl Icahn Tendered Its Herbalife Shares Into The Co.'s Self-Tender Offer""Translated:HLF sacrificed the health of its balance sheet to artificially push up its share price, so shareholders and insiders can cash out their positions at high prices, leaving a company with no assets left to be seized in future lawsuits. This looks to be the stage of the party when the sober guests start leaving."
"The FTC’s allegations filed in Los Angeles federal court left no doubt that it concluded that Herbalife had been ripping people off: “Consumers have suffered and will continue to suffer substantial monetary loss as a result of [Herbalife’s] violations of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act.” (That's the section that bars ""unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.”)FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said after the settlement that ""Herbalife is going to have to start operating legitimately."" That would mark a real change, she suggested.To some extent, perhaps it did. Herbalife's come-on to distributors today says that they can earn money ""selling Herbalife products that you buy at a discount"" or ""sponsoring someone who either sells Herbalife products or purchases them at a discount for their own or household use."" It specifically says that distributors ""cannot earn money simply for recruiting or sponsoring someone."""
"Icahn tendered 11.4M shares yesterday, at the last minute. He got 10.5M shares accepted for 550M dollars, out of total of 600M. The majority of other 38M tendered shares (49.7M - 11.4M) were not accepted. Either Icahn was super genius. Or, he had inside information so he knew what the exact tender price should be. I think this run of modified Dutch auction was an agreement between HLF and Icahn, designed specifically to allow Icahn to unload his shares with company borrowed money, and as an appreciation to his long time support."
"I hardly think that with temporary mild single digit decline in guidance vs still decent continued growth that it deserves to be down 17% and lowest in over a year. 5-10% maybe for awhile, but not 17%. Yes, I’m now buying."
Please stop Tex...
"Nice haircut, and well earned with $3 BILLION in debt load, and Negative $12 book value per share."
It will be interesting to see if HLF pulled the trigger and bought back shares during this selloff. Perhaps they reacquired 5M at $40 instead of 4M at $50.
"Michael Johnson ADDS 114,673 shares to his personal HLF holdings, now at 2,172,314 shares which makes him the 12th largest HLF shareholder. I call that commitment to the company. Why would he keep adding to his holdings and not just sell out all his options? What does he see in the future?"

Is this in fact worth less than a year ago?
"Herbalife Admits To Ongoing SEC & DOJ Investigation Regarding Its Largest Market: ChinaThe company is acknowledging ongoing “anti-corruption compliance” investigations from both the SEC and the Department of Justice. For years, it has been alleged that Herbalife is running an illegal business model in China, a country that accounted for about 20% of total Herbalife sales."

Ackman was right
Stock should open tomorrow at $55.585
go long only if it holds $44...I would wait at least to $40 ~ $42 though.
"2 Big settlements after the Bell, 169,100 & 150,000 shares at near highs of the day. That was a buyer that the house needed to fill so they had to walk the SP up to fill the order. Was not a seller that came in with an order as I'm sure some short will claim, wouldn't have closed near the highs if that was the case. Tomorrow will be interesting."
My thinking is back in the 47+ range by end of week.
(http://Fairstox.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
"Of course, hlf is affected when people are staying home since it makes money to meet more people to allure into its ponze scheme ladder. I bet they've been borrowing cheap money and cheating on income and revenue so far into pandemic and now they ran out of options. I'd sell ALL shares if I were a hlf holder. This stock is going down to teens."
"Wow. Carl Icahn not doing so hot. He owned 55 million shares of Hertz at end of 1st quarter. Hertz traded at average of $13.70 during the quarter. Now, Hertz just filed for bankruptcy. Is something similar in store for his HLF holdings?"
"HLF management thinks that an ""Investor Day"" video is the same as a company rah rah sales conference."
"As an Herbalife independent distributor I can see great potential in Herbalife growth, my daily activity in the nutrition club gives me the sense of doing a more advance way to serve our customers than simply serving coffee as starbucks."
"Distributors can’t actually “sell” the product at the club; instead they sell a daily membership that entitles the customer to a shake (Herbalife’s Formula 1), a cup of aloe water, and a tea (served hot or cold, sometimes you can choose from 3 or 4 flavors) in styrofoam cups. A daily member typically pays somewhere between $5 and $7 in cash for the membership. Herbalife rules dictate that patrons can’t leave the club with these products; they must be consumed in the club."
"If Icahn is selling, why should anyone be buying at this level?"

Herbal Life: ￼High attrition with bad nutrition￼.
Volume Point for China is -22.5%. Did I read it right?
"Looks like a high reward/risk short play. Take a look at the weekly chart, this thing is about to roll over."
"Now that Advocare was formaly called Pyramide Scheme, will Herbalife be next? Because it all seems the same scheme.https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2019/10/ftc-advocare-business-model-was-pyramid-scheme"
Will be up around 10 perc
Now you know why Icahn sold this stock.
YOU'RE WELCOME
"I'll listen to the CC, but I'm not particularly impressed. These are about the numbers I expected, but with still 2MM extra shares outstanding and $75MM less net equity than I expected. Net profit margin is dropping like a rock, inventory down, PP&E down is disinvestment and milking the company to pay off Carl.How much is left in the stock buyback fund? What are the particulars for the S/T debt? Are these guys really the financial jeanusus that Carl said they were?"
"Is this the Amway of our time, peddling vitamins ?"
"HLF cashed out their convertible bond issue on 8/15, so their balance sheet should look different next quarter. I think that it will be interesting to see what the outstanding share count will be and if they also decided to buy back some shares. The big boys likely know what will happen, but I doubt most retail investors understand the transaction as written in their disclosures. Carl commented last year that HLF had a lot of financial geniuses at the helm, and I wonder if he has changed his opinion lately..."
I am still puzzled. How did HLF go from about $60 to $110 with flat revenue and flat net income?
"ZACKSBear of the Day: Herbalife (HLF)November 15 2017Herbalife (HLF - Free Report) has fallen into the cellar of the Zacks Rank recently as Wall Street investment banks continue to shy away from the network marketer of health and nutrition products.After the company reported Q3 results on November 2, and provided guidance for the coming year, SunTrust analysts lowered their 2018 full-year EPS estimate by 8%."
"Herbalife Nutrition and Tasly Holdings Group to form HT Innovations LP in the US as a joint Venture.LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--To further advance healthier living through good nutrition, premier global nutrition company Herbalife (HLF) today announced it has entered into a framework agreement with Tasly Holding Group, a leading Chinese healthcare corporation.

Congratulations to all longs. HLF will be the end of Pershing Square or Perishing Squirrel. This is the reason I do not short stocks.
