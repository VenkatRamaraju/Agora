"I have to agree with most guys who like to watch sports, that NFLX has no sports. Which means, I have to pay for another stream anyways, which likely has just as good IF not better content. And would likely have News too. Thus, I decided to cancel my NFLX. Just my 2 cents."

The disruption caused by Netflix low pricing is in the early stages. Industry revenue and profits are headed lower before they turn higher again after a major shakeout. Most media companies will not make it.

"Wow SEC Network, Big Ten, PAC 12 all in the Elite plan with all the classic non-sports stations can you say college football? This is an unreal deal through $FUBO this isn’t something $NFLX offers. Comcast offers it at a much much higher price $CMCSA"
Targets raised .
"Netflix increase its price in Europe, France. No one is aware in the main news.Follow me for the best investment. :)"
"$4B is cheap cheap cheap for a growth company with ~700k subscribers! So much can be done to monetize those subscribers its unreal. $FUBO is a true cord cutter from cable, unlike $ROKU $NFLX"
i would sell this and take a profit. they are the blockbuster video and myspace of today

"FUBO is getting noticed as the sports streamer, they have shareholders that include Comcast and DIS, big recent Q and under $4B market cap"
No news. No sports. Just chick movies. LoL.
Netflix is always the best king of the jungle
"Needs to retake 540 and hold that level, then the next stop will be 700. Very cheap based on future earnings down here."
"I don’t see $NFLX as much of a cord cutting solution as it doesn’t offer what cable does, but $FUBO does and more and for less monthly than the cable providers, this is what will get the moms and pops to switch to FuboTV."
25% of today's volume traded in the last 30 minutes of trading. 90% of that volume was on the sell side. NFLX will be red tomorrow!!
