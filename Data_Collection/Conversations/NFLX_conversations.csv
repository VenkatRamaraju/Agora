"I am at a total loss why this company is around at these prices. Their content is dated, its just a tired old platform that is going to slowly get lost in the new upcoming trends. Shocking people consider this price in line lol, scary."
I always wondered if wallstreettrendsetter was Mark Cuban.
"Keep those Korean dramas coming. I first ""fell"" in love with Son Ye Jin, then cheated on her with Jun Ji-hyun, Kim Tae Hee and Song Hye Kyo. Now I am torn between the SQUID actress Jung Ho-yeon and Shin Min Ah. It's too bad I don't have a Peter Thiele $5 Billion ROTH IRA. If I did I would pay off my wife and kids and start dating these actresses. With $5 billion even a guy like me who looks like a fire hydrant would be very attractive to these ladies. So, thank you Netflix for bringing hope into my life ..."

"Netflix price target raised to $740 from $643 at Credit SuisseNetflix price target raised to $740 from $643 at Credit Suisse Credit Suisse analyst Douglas Mitchelson raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $740 from $643 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst notes that Squid Game's success has raised investor Q3/Q4 subscriber expectations accordingly, with his recent discussions with investors suggesting an expectation of 4M/8M net adds for Q3/Q4 guide, but only because it is universally anticipated that management will be overly conservative. While Mitchelson acknowledges the set-up into earnings is heady, a Q3 miss seems off the table, the Q4 slate is terrific, and management commentary is likely to be quite optimistic with Squid Game the latest evidence proving out its international content strategy."

"I don't own netflix, but this whole idea of ""competition"" is overblown. If you like watching a show that is exlusive to netflix, you will pay for it. If you like a show on Disney +, you will pay for both at the same time."

"Another guesser/promoter on CNBC is using the old ""still room to run"" BS analysis for NFLX. SELL it on further rallies. It will implode - NOT the only streaming game in town.."
"I hold both NFLX and DIS shares however DIS has proven to be a major disappointment so far. I will hold both for a few more months but if DIS doesn’t start performing the way NFLX has I am selling DIS to buy more NFLX. Some like to say competition is intensify for NFLX, however that has failed to impact their earnings as well as erode management effectiveness, aka return on assets, return on equity, and return on invested capital. Those have continued to increase despite the competition, which tells me NFLX still has a competitive advantage. As long as they continue to churn out blockbusters like The Queen’s Gambit and Squid Game the competition will be playing catch up. In addition to that, NFLX and DIS have different target markets with their shows so it’s not exactly an apples to apples comparison. I know there are people out there that use Peacock, I have yet to meet them though. Lifting the hood one can tell NFLX is really not in any serious trouble. Fundamentally the stock is growth at a reasonable price and cash flow is increasing by the quarter. When the engine begins to sputter I’ll concede the bear case, but right now it is firing on all cylinders."
"Squid Games....goes to show you it only takes one very successful show to make a huge impact! With the amount of new content Netflix is and will be delivering, chances are good there's even more coming."
Out of it at 631$....been unloading since 580s....Got in at 200$s...hope to get back under 550s...lets see.. This run up just does not make sense. NFLX always goes down 10% after the earnings...

"When Facebook was threatened by competition, FB did something smart: they outright bought them. It seems that NFLX is currently facing even bigger threats from competition. What makes things particularly difficult for NFLX is that its main suppliers are the ones turning into its competitors. NFLX should consider taking a similar approach as FB and start picking off some of that competition while NFLX’s valuation is still high."

Now SQUID merchandise in conjunction with Walmart just in time for the Holidays. Good idea. Better idea Netflix is to arrange dates with the Korean actresses currently starring in your KDramas and charge what Jeff Bezos is charging for a trip into space.

VIAC's portfolio includes streaming service Paramount+, which is not so well-known as Netflix, but it's number of subscribers is rapidly growing, while IMO NFLX growth is somewhat limited (almost everyone interested probably already got it).There are 2 main differences between NFLX and VIAC :1) VIAC is not only about series and films, but their portfolio includes also sports, CBS, PlutoTV, MTV etc, which means a revenue from adds2) VIAC owns huge content library - Paramount Pictures, which means a revenue from licensing.The revenues of both are almost the same : NFLX 27.59B, VIAC 26.69B, the debt of both also almost equal.And now the most interesting numbers - market cap : NFLX 283B, VIAC 26B.That means NFLX is valued more than 10times vs. VIAC.I'd really like to know your opinion."

"Netflix is throwing $ BILLIONS into building up its content. They're literally throwing spaghetti strands at the wall to see what sticks . . . . they will positively come up with more great series. And don't forget their signing & financing of films & series (made by or starring) Steven Spielberg / Amblin Partners, David Fincher, Guillermo del Toro, Sony Pictures (Netflix just signed a deal to get a bunch of their films), Nickelodeon, David Benioff and Dan Weiss (the GoT producer-writers), Ryan Murphy, Shonda Rhimes, Matt Reeves, Will Smith, Adam Sandler, Jennifer Garner, Zack Snyder, Studio Powerhouse Animation, Jennifer Lopez, Kevin Hart, Ricky Gervais, Beyonce Knowles, director Peter Berg, director Gareth Evans, Nancy #$%$er (a talent steal who was with Disney Channel), and so many other A-List creators-producers-show runners with ""first look"" options that it's not even funny. 2022 will be bursting with great attention getting shows & movies at Netflix. Plus they produce specialized content for different countries around the world. Netflix will be front running in the streaming wars for years to go."
