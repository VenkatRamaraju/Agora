"You can tell Netflix is crushing the competition. The market is up big this year 23%, Netflix is up more 28%. Amazon, Disney and ViacomCBS are flat. AT&T is down 13%. Even Apple who has upped its content spending is underperforming up 14%."
The PE dropped even with the big price gains. That’s what happens when earnings more than double every 2 years.
"Talk about the streaming wars. There are none. The battle was between Netflix and big media’s cable networks. They owned the content and weren’t going anywhere. They were going to put little Netflix in its place. We know what happened. Netflix became a major media company themselves, just in streaming. They will never recover from the big mistake they made of underestimating Netflix under the leadership of Reed Hastings."
They keep erasing my post. Omg squid game is the worst show i ever saw. 2 min i had to shut it off. What a nightmare...i am borring money to buy puts. Have a nice weekend. This will be 550 2nd week of november. Bankkkkkkkkk
"Media companies’ stocks fall while Netflix stock soars. Squid game could be the final straw that broke the camels back. It attracted millions of new viewers at precisely the right time, when Netflix was releasing its biggest slate of new content so far."
$700 plssssss
I am so tired of NFLX doing nothing all day. Can you move??? I have been reading http://alert-sounds.com/ for a month now and the stocks there actually go!
"From NFLX letter to shareholders: We are still quite small, with a lot of opportunity for growth; in our largest and most penetrated market, according to Nielsen, we are still less than 10% of US television screen time. Our approach as always is to improve our service as quickly as we can so that we can earn a greater share of people’s time."
Comcast reports they lost 1.3 million cable video subscribers over the past year and up goes Netflix.
Joke at this point. Time to thro in the towel

Keep thinking this stock can't go up further. Sold a couple of shares. Every time I do this I regret it.There is NO end to this dynamic company. ALL TIME HIGHS nearly daily!
Let's hold the line and we can all drink tears of short sellers past $700 
"Analysts continue to revise earnings estimates higher. It’s a very, very good sign that Netflix will continue making new highs."
"Earnings are always a mess. Risk to reward just isn’t there to hold thru it. Might as well sell and buy back after the numbers. Reward is $10…risk is $75. Just not worth it. Let’s see if it bucks it today, but holding just about any tech stock thru earnings is just not a risk to reward justification."
All bots trading. Same 1 share back and forth ......dont look at this for another 2 weeks. I am out
The chart today is straight up staircase. Like it was planned before the day started. How is this investing ?
Always the king ...........soon this will be past 700 then split i hope.Lets gooooooooooooooooooo
Is it time for a Stock split yet? Thoughts.
"NFLX is about to unleash a ton of new content bound up from the pandemic, add a gaming platform, expand on existing hits, have merchandise sales take off, and is still at the beginning of global expansion. I wouldn't bet against them now."
TSLA is now worth more than $FB and $NFLX. Marking the end of the FANG acronym era.
Is it inside trading if someone told me the stock will go up 5-6$ in an hr??
The market will try its best to make you sell your shares. Thumbs up to the ones who didn’t.
"Analyst Laura Martin of Needham said NFLX was stuck in the 500s as long as they didn't do advertising revenue. Would be interesting to know if she still stands by that statement. So far, that theory has prove to hold as much water as her FUBO buy recommendation when the stock price was $60 a share (now half that much). I haven't sold any NFLX since 2014. Somebody who wants to claim DIS and CMCSA and Viacom are eating NFLX's lunch will have to explain why the stock price has risen nearly $200 in the last few months. See you on the other side. At the moment DIS is stuck in neutral and CMCSA is climbing the hill at the pace of a sloth. Viacom CBS is a mammoth but personally I have no desire to see most of their movies or shows. NFLX has incredible good content, and while perhaps advertising would be an additional catalyst for growth, thus far NFLX is doing just fine without it and I feel the average user likes the lack of advertising, I know I do."
This definitely is driven by MMs. Trading is at a very low volume. Even selling 100 shares is taking a long time.
its going to $700.00 soon
The gamma unclench on this is going to be epic. And will happen in seconds.
this is going to boom any minute. I think news coming out very soon.
This will go down in history as the greatest short ever. Redbox cometh
"If you had invested $1,000 in Netflix on Oct. 19, 2011 at a share price of $15.63, the market value of your shares would be $40,430 today, reflecting a return of more than 3,900%, according to CNBC calculations. In contrast, a $1,000 investment in the S&P 500 index would have seen a 356.8% return over the same time period and would be worth about $4,568.Over the same time period, Netflix’s market cap increased from $5.7 billion to $279 billion as of Wednesday morning."
616 to 683 in 6 days joke aint the word. On lower guidence
"Netflix beat the EPS estimate of 2.56 with the Actual 3.19. That is a WHOPPING +24.61%... If you don't plan on holding Netflix for a long or medium term, do yourself a favor and sell it accordingly!! :-)"
"I let go of my bitter predisposition about shib. This isn’t two sides of a war, there’s only one crypto army and we are all in it together, fighting against the old guard at large."
"LGF-A (LionGate)2.7B Cap, 4B Revenue Starz Streaming 17,000 Premium Titles 30M Subscribers Globally Netflix 293B Cap, 26B Revenue Netflix Streaming 15,000 Titles 209M Subscribers Globally"
the only competition Netflix has in the streaming sector is Youtube. The other players are just eating each other
This week nearly 95% of volume in NFLX MMs hedging gamma. Unclench will be brutal.
Chart is unstoppable
Definitely splitting. even institutions wouldn't buy if they didn't know.
Whoever they caught in after hours will cry tomorrow. Just wait.
"Netflix and ViacomCBS produces roughly the same level of revenue and earnings, yet is Netflix valued x12 ViacomCBS valuation.. $NFLX $VIAC"
