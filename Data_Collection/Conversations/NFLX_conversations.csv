I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
The disruption caused by Netflix low pricing is in the early stages. Industry revenue and profits are headed lower before they turn higher again after a major shakeout. Most media companies will not make it.

CNBC trying really hard to pump NFLX stock today and keep it from cratering.
"Yay so much money as a short, about time I win!!! Big miss!"
"$NFLX posts huge miss for earnings, despite fabricated revenues! The company employees continue to open bogus bot Netflix account to inflate the subscriber numbers!"
Distinguishing a professional broker is one of the criteria that's required in an online investment that's why i would recommend only one legit platform that's trustworthy and reliable.
"Once again, we were all deceived with a fake growth of 566$ .. There again, big money was sold to gullible private traders. 80% on statistics reports Netflix is on sale .. July 20th will cost 520-500$. This is a very good company, but shares in the hands of manipulators and large speculators will not allow us to earn money. For the year + 5% growth .. it's laughter."
Sell the news...Couldn't hold gains.
Lost 430k subs in the US/Canada. Not Good. How is this stock above $500? horrible quarter and guidance.
Problemwith Netflix is thier top movie has only had revenue of $99 Million Dollars.Nowhere near a cinema Blockbuster.
Take a look across the market. Good news isnt effecting any stock right now $VENA $NFLX
Ive got a billion dollar idea…Netflix starts a Porn subscription They call it NetfliXXXBoom thats a 20% push right thereAnd im not even a shareholderYou’re welcome Netflixxx

"Welldone! Although I changed Netflix to Amazon, I'm glad. For over a year this company has not made a profit, now it goes to 600! Netflix my compliments."
Always the king
Netflix is up 4.91% to 547.50
"I'm already wondering how long the Netflix circus will last, 13 months the company won't grow. And the All indicators have improved over the year. This is the first time I've seen this. This is some kind of scam. Even bankrupt junk papers are on the rise .. apparently corruption on wallstreet is at its highest right now."
It deserved to be a 100 billion stock. It was such a trailblazer and ground breaking .Now it has the greatest streaming app. But the actual programing is bad. That is important. I had to quit. They have no SF after all major studios took of their movies. 95% of the NFLX stuff is so bad. I likes snow piercer and Fargo. But even fargo season 4 did not come back. It needs to buy Viacom.I changed to HBO at least until they stop the same day movie watching . NFLX has no clear advantage that I can see without a major purchase.
(http://Stocks-tracker.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
probably go green by about 15-20$. Bull Market action
Netflix going into streaming games.Netflix reports after the bell Tuesday.
Bought 600 shares today.
Apple can still afford to buy over Netflix￼!
My 2 cents worth . $550 for awhile now. Announcement today  management knows the chart better then any of us
I remember when this thing would be up or down something like $60 after earnings not too long ago. I like this mooted reaction much better.
Going to 700 but needs to retake 540 first.
"Still not clear, but $535 today is coming back in sight."
Can't get sports or news on NotFlix. Bunch of chick flicks is all. Not a fan. Paramount+ seems better.
"Relative to Nasdaq 100, NFLX has been getting worse for weeks.This does not preclude occasional sharp rises, though."
Netflix has guided subscribers adds lower for 2 quarters in a row. Analysts have lowered their estimates accordingly. The bar is set real low a la AJR.
When the bears are in control the best they can do is keep the stock in a sideways channel. When the bulls are in control the stock moves higher.

"are you kidding me video games, they need to focus on better content never mind video games, netfilx gets real boring after about 6 months."
Netflix will experience super high growth in video games over the next few years which will boost overall growth and because of that needs to be re-rated and given a higher PE.
I'm new in the system and I've always had interest to invest but the high rate of lost is what's discouraging..

"Ok, the numbers weren't spectacular, but the business model is scalable and so even small increases help to generate disproportionately more profit. The price / earnings ratio is already moderate and Netflix has many other options for generating additional income in the future, for example gaming, merchandising or advertising. The trend towards digital entertainment is still in its infancy, so Netflix certainly has many years of great growth ahead of it. A share that I can carelessly left lying around for ten years, I remain bullish!"

Golden cross.
I think it's a good sign that it's up after hours after being down so much after earnings were reported. In the past when I have seen stocks do this they have continued to go up over the coming days. The next few days will be interesting to see what happens but I predict we continue to climb. How bout the rest of you predict by replying with your predictions?

"I don't know what to think about that earnings, but I can say Netflix was on a role for awhile with really great new content, lately I can't find anything to watch and they don't seem to continue with the really good series.

"Volume appeared, now the growth is harmonious! But we are still waiting for fundamental confirmation on the report. The increase in subscribers is higher than the forecast.

"Netflix entering the games industry could change the face of gaming and entertainment as we know it, or it could be a massive flop - it's impossible to say without knowing more about what they mean by video games. Since Netflix is not a hardware company, coming out with a console or Roku/smart stick type device to play games is likely out of the question, and the average smart TV cannot do much more than run basic apps, the games would have to be limited to mobile devices, which would make sense that they brought on a Zynga exec. Did anyone watch that Black Mirror movie on Netflix, Bandersnatch, which was interactive? You could watch the movie as is, or every so often it would give you a choice which you selected on your phone or TV remote, and the movie would change course. There were all kinds of endings and routes you could take in the movie, so rewatching it and making other decisions added a lot to an otherwise OK movie. This could be the direction that they are going: making movies and TV more interactive. I am not really sold on that idea though - interactive video is not that appealing to me, but I don't know about kids and everyone else. I'm sur people have said the same things about every other innovation. The other way I see it could play out, is that Netflix would develop some 'party games' like the Jackbox or Trivia, and people could submit answers from their phone. Ultimately, it comes down to: can Netflix develop games that people want to play? It's easy to just say ""No"", but great innovations rarely seem like no-brainers, so time will tell."

Survey - thumbs up - earnings beat / thumbs down earnings miss.
Netflix has been staggering for a year now. Look at the 52-week moving price. Seems like with more and more options and competition trying to chew off the same pie. Netflix is fighting a losing battle over others with more than just streaming to offer. I want to see anyone has any counter idea besides thumb down
Shorts covering.
This stock is only 50 dollars away from 52 week low. I'd say its time to buy.
After market is very thinly traded. We'll see what the bigger money does when the market opens tomorrow.
It dropped 30 after hours to 500 when Netflix guided for only 3.5 million adds in Q3. Then rebounded to 530 during the earnings call after Hastings predicted 800 million subscribers when streaming becomes saturated. Most of these new subscribers will be added after content spending plateaus. All that increased subscription revenue along with revenue from many price increases will fall to the bottom line as profit. Profit growth will remain enormous for many years. In my book Netflix still remains the #1 stock to hold for the long term.

"Does anyone realize that the disruption that Netflix brought to the TV/Movie market, was just announced for the gaming market? Why would you play freemium games that are built to be hard so you have to buy stuff vs games that are just meant to be fun with no ads/pay walls.

"Low volume. Institutions holding on. Media companies are beefing up their streaming services with titles from their vast libraries, but to achieve sustained subscriber growth and pricing power they will need to add new titles. Can they do it competing against Netflix? We will know soon enough."
"Can someone explain to me how this is hasn’t dropped 5% yet? I bought in at $533 right before earnings and was lucky to cover at the same price AH. The video game streaming market is already saturated at without additional add-ons like ad revenue from certain premium streaming movies / option to buy or rent like Amazon prime, combined with increased competition from Disney+ I don’t know how they justify this valuation. This is no longer a growth stock but more like a utility stock - only incremental increases in price can lead to substantial gains in EPS or revenue. The days of the the 10M+ new subscriber quarters are long gone. Can anyone with some real knowledge share their opinion on this? Am I missing something?"

Looks like 482 was the bottom last month. Investors have already started bidding up the stock on faster growth they see coming starting in Q4.
Netflix will smash threw anything now. Especially with games on their platform. Go netflix
"I never thought twice about NFLX, mainly because it's chart didn't look like NVDA and I tend to stream stuff on Prime more, but when I saw it dive when every other stock did great today and saw some headlines about video games, I looked into it a little bit. Despite the skewed headlines you see about NFLX today and the very bearish comments on read on here, Netflix is actually performing great. Yes, earnings did not meet 'expectations', but they nonetheless have year over year revenue and profit growth. NFLX has had 500% share price growth over the last 5 years, that's 100% year over year... Yes, 2021 was not the most beautiful chart year for Netflix, but the quarterly earnings spikes aside, NFLX has had nice positive share price growth. Netflix reigned king of streaming for many years and Apple, Amazon, et al. are catching up now, but that's the thing that is driving innovation. Netflix getting into video games? I think the media calling it 'video games' paints the wrong picture for what's probably in store, and we don't really know anything at all yet. Realistically, Netflix is not a dumb company, so we can surmise what they may do. They're not a hardware company, so I think the ideas of trying to be a Stadia is not it. No one wants to receive video game DVDs via mail anymore, so they're not doing that. Smart TVs cant really handle much more than apps right now, and yeah, they could just do straight up mobile games, but that wouldnt make any sense. What we are likely going to see is more interactive TV shows and movies, like the Black Mirror: Bandersnatch movie. The movie was ok, but the interactive story concept is neat and I think that could develop more in the future. Ultimately, innovations that change the world rarely seem like no brainers at first - usually it takes time. So, while interactive movies or sort of collaborative movie experiences you could have with family and friends may seem like an odd idea or unappealing, it could be the thing that changes at home entertainment. Netflix has been public for 20 years, and half of that it traded under $20. We all knew of Netflix when you could get DVDs by mail, rip them, and then send them back - at no point, did I ever think that they would change the face of TV and Movies forever with streaming. But they did. And I think they're just getting started with their next phase which is more content and different streaming experiences. Also, besides, you all are very bearish in here, and I've found that the market typically does the opposite of what the masses want. I only own one share, and its the one I bought at the bottom today, but I'm thinking this could be my next NVDA."
"NFLX revolutionized video contents by bringing those into internet. The tech was innovative 10 yrs ago, but not today. Today everyone with content can do it: Disney, Warner, Paramount, NBC, etc. There's no new innovation here in TV streaming today. And Gaming already on the internet for years, and a lot of them are free as well. there's no much room for for NFLX to disrupt. Also, ppl that watch NFLX may not be gamers, not much synergies.It's all about Contents now, and I don't see NFLX has advantage on it. A slow subs growth will turn into subs loss, then it's downfall from here."
"Y'all got learned good today didn't ya? Yes you did hehe. It was a bad down day when you thought earnings would lift the stock, you were wrong. I'm happy to say that I clipped a few bucks from shorting it hehe, thanks for that. Take care, and a big thank you to all my fans! Love you guys, keep it real, peace out! Thanks."

""Army of the Dead"" is just wretchedness .., ""Street of Fear"" is exactly the same bottom, ""Shadow and Bone"" is an average series .. so where could subscribers with such weak content come from?

"NFLX: subscriber growth is anemic. Revenue is flat.Wall Street: What's next...?NFLX: ummmm....video games!!Wall Street: Sounds great. ($30 recovery in an afterhours heartbeat)This market is an absolute joke. If you believe NFLX is going to capture any meaningful gaming community on their mobile device, you have a head injury. I don't own this security, so nothing to lose/gain, but this reeks of desperation..."
"Two positive technical signs:1. $523 is being tested.2. The ratio Nasdaq 100 / NFLX has dipped below 29. (Got stronger, relative to Nasdaq 100.)$537.01 (the AH high on the last earnings' day) is realistically back in sight."
I think NFLX is turning around.$525 ~ $535 today or tomorrow is within the realm of possibility.
Why up AH??
No news. No sports. Just chick movies. LoL.
Apparently investors don’t like that Netflix is getting into video games.

Doing gaming which may help going forward.
Good ER for Netflix. Nice surprise on new Subs. Conservative guidance. I like it.
Dpz is performing better Sava making all time high. Keep losing money on nflx . The media wants your to lose your money
"I do not understand the logic of the people who still hold these shares. I held 200 shares for more than a year, everyone waited for 600+, and each time the stock fell and fell .. I missed the 2020 bull market, which happens once every 10 years .. The last straw was the last report on which Netflix sold out again. Selling for $ 530 I earned a measly + 4.5% per year! And now, in just 2 weeks, I have multiplied the deposit + 25%, in AMD and some other stocks. Netflix left a few papers, and what I see after 2 weeks they could not even win back 3.5% after the report, this is not a stock, but just laughter. My advice is to sell you this swamp and buy normal rising stocks there are a lot of them on the market."
I’m thinking we hit 530 tomorrow what do you guys think?
"It's official, the N in FAANG will be NVDA going forward."
That pump was real
$zm $docu $snap $NFLX all proved re-opening is not negatively affecting their growth. $Nvda proved gaming industry is soaring. Why T F is everyone so afraid of this company not exceeding expectations?? Forward p/e under 15. This is a joke and an outright buy!
Market crash incoming. this week is probably a good time to get out $NFLX $GME #MOASS
Wednesday we touch $566 in AH. Now we down to $530’s? Why such a drastic drop?
550 close tomorrow
Great news about video game entry and doing it right by hiring good Managment. Earnings Tuesday! Wow what a great combination. Nice
Sold after a decent run recently and banked my 10% gain - it’s not much but seems a little risky from here on in - GL to everyone still holding
I bought this when it was 90 share and holding. You have to take into account the pandemic when looking back a year. Netflix is ramping up big time now and within 12 months should be going gangbusters.
"500-560 is the range NFLX being traded for a year. Right now, 535 means price could go up 30 or down 30. Roughly 5% bounce range."
"Prepping up for the crash tomorrow with thin volume! With any down market,,,NFLX will be in great peril."
Hi there I bought only 10 shares years ago at 332 US so I think j I’m good going to sell 5 at 660 where I double cuz it will go there. Leave the rest for my boy. Not rich but having fun. Cheers Netflix.
"Fwiw : I have a Netflix account but rarely go there anymore, just cannot get excited about the content. I have recently gotten a Paramount + subscription .... And really like the content. Again, just my 2 cents."
this will not be held down for much longer folks $NIO $WIMI $NFLX
"Many ""streamers"" are up today: $AMC, $VIAC, $DISCA, $LGF-A, $CHTR, $NFLX, $CMCSA and don't forget good ol' $ROKU"
"I've never seen someone as perfect as Mrs Stephanie A. William. she knows how to analyze trade and with her strategies she earned me so much profits, made £16,800 in 7day."
what will happen is that more ppl will realize its enough having Netflix 2 months a year when 95 percent of their content is fluff
"Still a buy!Research Alert: CFRA Keeps Buy Opinion On Shares Of Netflix Corp.BY MT Newswires— 6:00 PM ET 07/20/202106:00 PM EDT, 07/20/2021 (MT Newswires) -- CFRA, an independent research provider, has provided MT Newswires with the following research alert. Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:We keep our 12-month target price of $650, on '21 price-to-sales of 8.4x, well above peers. With higher content spending, we cut '21 EPS estimate by $0.18 to $10.55 and keep '22's at $13.23. Q2 global paid subscriber additions of 1.54M was above a very subdued target of 1.0M, predominantly on the APAC region (vs. U.S/Canada, LatAm and EMEA). Q3 guidance of 3.5M seemed quite underwhelming against prior outlook for H2 acceleration on stronger content slate, stoking concerns with intensifying competition and the impact of easing lockdown restrictions (with more entertainment options). Still, pricing power remains strong while consumer engagement and retention seem to be very healthy. Also, we see a bullish indicator on the changing free cash flow profile ('21 breakeven target) as a bullish indicator (NFLX initiated its $5B share repurchase program). Q2 EPS of $2.97 vs. $1.59 was $0.18 below consensus. Revenue rose 19% on 8% higher average revenue per user (ARPU) while operating margin widened 310 basis points."

Buy the shares while it's still cheap. Breaking through ATH before the Earning.
This stock has gone under 500 and passed 550 6 times in the last 12 months.Nobody has perfect timing but lets say you buy under 505 and sell at +545. Thats a 50% gain if you have some very good timing and do things very well.You could get more by just buying Apple or Paypal 12 months ago and do nothing. And easily double or more if you time Apple or Paypal a couple of times.Netflix has been horrible the last 12 months. They need better shows. Oh and someone tell them that 90% of the population isnt gay.
Congrats if you bought at 505 after the bell.
Earnings MISS! Massive sellaff tomarrow in my esteemed yet humble opinion.Thanks.
This was UP 30 last quarter but by the end of next day it was red !REMEMBER ?Imagine what this will close at tomorrow !
Gotta push through
"I only own 2 shares of this company (so only about 1k worth) and it's been dead money for a year now. However, I think their content is fabulous especially for those who like history. Their docuseries are amazing. I believe my original plan will work; own two shares, hope the price goes to 700+ and then does a 5 to 1 split, repeat! I'll make alot of money off this one, but it will take time"
What a Day What a day Trying to find somewhere to Harbor my money I think Netflix is a good choice as Well as QuantumScape (QS)￼
"If NFLX is thinking about original video game content, that will be a disaster. Their original content now is 95% unwatchable with occasional home runs and video game development is significantly more expensive. This just smells like desperation from stalling subscriber growth. I think they should focus on quality of their current content. its mostly unwatchable"

"Only on the news overbought and in debt Disney, which increases ESPN's subscription for +1$, shares grow by + 4%)). Netflix, as always, falls on any positive news and with a green Nasdaq))). And yes, Disney cost 100$ a year ago)). And now 185$. Netflix cost 530$ in the summer of 2020 and now costs the same)) LOL."
"Back in January the stock jumped from 500 to 593 on very heavy volume after they reported good news on FCF. We could see a similar move Tuesday as subscriber growth is still in focus but enormous profit growth, as they continue to scale up, is the catalyst."

No boxing on Nutflix ? 
Netflix reiterated Outperform with $650 price targetCowen analyst John Blackledge said his survey suggests Netflix has the best content as it continues to lead living room TV and is well ahead of other streaming and linear services. The analyst previewed the company's Q2 and expects 1.2M slightly above the 1M guidance. Blackledge reiterated his Outperform rating and $650 price target on Netflix shares.
They will have to ramp spending on new content and competition is fierce. Before they didn’t have to spend on content because covid and limited competition.
"Bitcoin is the future!Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks. Steve can be reached onT E LEG RAM ( steveewilson )"
Aftermarket +2% what happened?)
"You've gotta be nuts to believe their financials. 4 billion in cost of content and 2.8 billion in content depreciation? When I turn on Netflix, there's NOTHING to watch. And they have 27bn in content? hahahaha... Oh, and BTW, can somebody explain the 15% tax rate? I'm lost on that also. Looks to me like they're telling the IRS one story and investors another."
$600 coming on or after July 20th earnings. No mercy on shorties.
"I have to agree with most guys who like to watch sports, that NFLX has no sports. Which means, I have to pay for another stream anyways, which likely has just as good IF not better content. And would likely have News too. Thus, I decided to cancel my NFLX. Just my 2 cents."
Good night great tomorrow

Hold only 10 shares from 2017. At 332 Not rich but planing to sell half at 660 leaving the last 5 for my 12 year old for future. Let’s go
Netflix starts testing in-app games for users in Polandhttps://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642946/netflix-mobile-games-in-app-android-users-poland-stranger-things-1984-3
"Netflix price target raised to $643 from $586 at Credit SuisseCredit Suisse analyst Douglas Mitchelson raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $643 from $586 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares following quarterly results. The analyst notes Netflix reported Q2 net adds 541k ahead at 1.541M and guided to 3.500M for Q3, below his 5.0M but in the range of buy-side expectations. Revenue and EBIT were slightly ahead, while management reaffirmed 2021 guides for 200bp of margin expansion and positive free cash flow, and added a 12% content amortization guide, Mitchelson adds."
Maybe 660 like George said
"Needs to retake 540 and hold that level, then the next stop will be 700. Very cheap based on future earnings down here."
25% of today's volume traded in the last 30 minutes of trading. 90% of that volume was on the sell side. NFLX will be red tomorrow!!
"Revenue was 22.4 billion a year when production was shut down due to covid last year. Now it’s 27.6 billion a year with production just starting back up! Only in the TV subscription industry is this possible. When we get new episodes of all the big hits Stranger Things, The Witcher, Ozark, etc. revenue growth will be through the roof and the stock will be closing in on 1000."
We are in a bull market. This will go green. Watch...
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
The fact that this is green in AF after a quick 30 dollar drop is encouraging. This will go up 20 to 35 bucks tomorrow
"With Netflix basic plan costing only $9/month most competing services don’t offer the same value at $5/month, but $5/month is not enough to pay for content and several services will go out of business. Netflix will pick up this lost business and this along with cord cutting which is still in the early stage should keep growth well over 20% a year for a long time."
Sell or hold?? Anyone?
