Conversation
"Seriously, there's just one post in the last 9 days? This stock is breaking out today and there's no conjecture or conversation about it?"
I have a question. How often are dividends payed? My broker said every month but I doubt that.
"I guess investors aren't too happy about the 5.8 % dividend and the reaffirmed outlook. After all, the 10 year t note is paying a wopping 0.81 %."
Their sale of the UK business suddenly looks really smart at the moment.
"Ok people. I agree that PPL is viewed as a divided stock for conservative investors, I get that....BUT, we need to try to have a little fun. So, let me try to get things going. I think the UK sale terms will be announced sometime in the next couple months. We got through Brexit (huge), and now we need to tame the covid threat. My simple and arguably flawed math thinks that the pps will jump close to $2 on that news. Then, the price will continue on a solid trajectory upward due to the favorable way the company is going to handle the proceeds. Now, I realize that was non technical but often, that sort of forecast is more accurate than crunching valid numbers. Ok, thanks for your support! :-)"
"Sold all my shares @30 , had enough"
"I doubled down on PPL. All the factors are aligned for a healthy run into the $40. Improving balance sheet, well run, inflation-proof, buyback, shedding of unprofitable/low-profit subsideries, and an excellent dividend."
I firmly believe PPL and DUK are similar as PPL has cleaned up its sloppy balance sheet and is finally on the right track financially. Here's my calculation of PPL's value in terms of DUK's dividend:.....................PPL............DUKDividend....1.66...........3.94Price.........29.19......106.88ForwardDiv Yield....5.69%........3.69%Parity..........3.69%.......5.69%Dividend....1.66...........3.94ImpliedPrice.........44.99.........69.24Conclusion: Either DUK is severely overvalued or PPL is extremely undervalued. I believe PPL has serious room to run.
Added to my PPL holdings today...it was on sale
PPL dividends safe? I say so. New has UK division up for sale which was purchased for $5+billion and will likely fetch 12billion plus according to reports. Debt on UK division about $6billion resulting in huge cash infusion to expand/development US markets. PPL has new CEO and last thing he wants to do is cut dividends.
"Power Power Light(PPL) joins Electric Highway Coalition to made up of 17 electric companies to establish charging stations up and down the Atlantic coast, to Midwest , and southern states to begin with. This will be crushing competition for the likes of Blink, Chargepoint. It was a matter of time."
"Began selling my position on each rally. 24,000 shares down, 6000 yet to go. Buying oil& gas companies much better chance for increasing dividends and share price growth. Have owned PPL for 11 years, but I’m not risking the dividend cut which is sure to happen. The market has already priced in the cut."
Anyone who purchased stock in PPL 5 years ago had a total return of 15% (includes price + dividend). Anyone who purchased a S&P 500 index Fund 5 years ago would have had a 98.6% increase in the share price. That doesn’t include dividends which were around 2% each year (so tack on another 10% to that total).
What an absolutely beautiful stock
30!!!!! Mama told me there'd be days like this.
Anyone out there who thinks the current quaterly dividend is sustainable? Chances are that future earnings over the next couple years will be lower than the current payout. I think we may be looking at a cut.
This is the best-run utility in the country. This $50 stock is inflation-proof and ready to run!
"Dividend = 5.91%""The company also maintained its commitment to dividends as a key component of total shareowner return, announcing a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.4150 per share, payable April 1, 2021, to shareowners of record as of March 10, 2021. The dividend will mark the company's 301st consecutive quarterly dividend paid since 1946."""
got in with a thou.shares looks like a solid stock with potential to go up and a nice dividend
Thats it ! not buying anymore am sure it will be up Monday when offering is done
Will she finally break 30?
Lot of talk here about a divvie cut but price keeps creeping up. Has to be a reason(s) why.
Wonder if Wall Street will pick up on electric utilities becoming a growth story or if they will stick with overcapitalized exercise bike companies.
"“On November 4, PPL is projected to report (3rd quarter) earnings of $0.35 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 39.66%.”“Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. PPL is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell).”“Looking at its valuation, PPL is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 24.58. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 18.61, which means PPL is trading at a premium to the group.”"
A company doesn't buy back its own stock if it has any intention of cutting the dividend. The company is also paying down debt. They also just jettisoned the business in the UK and thank God they're focusing on the business in the US. Stay focused.
The real money is going to be made in natural gas and uranium those are the two commodities that spin the turbines required to make all the electricity to recharge these millions of cars that are seem to be coming on the market my biggest holdings has just merged it was Cabot oil and gas the symbol is still the same they’re going to be a powerhouse 50% oil 50% natural gas in they are on hedged come January 1 the symbol is COG .
I like this deal. They shed $14B in debt and bring in $10B in cash. Net debt after deal will $10B. Pay some of that down and refinance duration. Divvy isn’t being cut and they will probably do a buyback. They currently pay $0.33/share in interest per quarter.
I will raise my number of shares in the next few days. People will panic and sell off great stocks like this. Not looking to get rich quick. Just looking for solid dividend stocks for my portfolio. Who stops using electric?
Wow - UK regulator CMA green lights the deal. Wasn’t expecting early approval.
"$ES $NEE $DUK $POR $ED $EIX $AGR $PPL all have the current ROE below of 8,7%. Does it mean what all these companies are SELL too?"
"Over the last few years this has been very frustrating to watch. I read the reports and I listen to every call and u hear alot of things being communicated but the share price has not improved or even got to where I bought it years and years ago. Even with all the dividends I am still at a loss. My confidence has really dropped and I am worried about the future of the dividend. Not the company itself, as I am not questioning that but many people rely on that dividend. Since the share price has been consistently in this range if a cut were to happen it wouldn't be pretty unless it's just a small amount. I am believing that they know that their shareholders have been frustrated and that they work to keep the dividend the same. Buy backs are nice but people favor the dividend over buyback. Especially when you have no capital gains year after year. If you did get in at $26 good for you then you are actually ahead. Good luck!"
so when are they going to tell us what the dividend is.
Ain’t nobody cutting no dividend here.
"The current 5. 9% dividend looks safe. In the midst of a pandemic, the earnings were quite decent:---Adjusting for special items, third-quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations (non-GAAP) were $450 million, or $0.58 per share, compared to $445 million, or $0.61 per share, a year ago.---PPL narrowed its 2020 earnings from ongoing operations forecast range to $2.40 to $2.50 per share from $2.40 to $2.60 per share. ---The future looks good."
"I came on this board to see if I could get a feel for what PPL might be able to get for their British assets. Will it be enough to justify the fact that they are giving up roughly half of their revenue base? All I have seen so far on this board is politics. Politics is important of course, but does anyone on here know anything about PPL? Is their plan to get out of England viable?"
Beautiful entry
PPL looking for U.S. Electric or NG play to replace UK Revenue stream. NJR is one of the several firms being looked at. They only want to spend $5 billion no more..
Almost at yearly high to date.
Making moves!
