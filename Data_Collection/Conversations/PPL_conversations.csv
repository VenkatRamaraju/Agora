"Seriously, there's just one post in the last 9 days? This stock is breaking out today and there's no conjecture or conversation about it?"
"I bought this stock about a year ago at 29.55 a share. I bought 1250 shares. I took advantage of the dividend and cashed out a little above 30 dollars a share. of course after I sold my shares it went to the high, about 36 dollars a share. l made out great with the dividend, but I wish I would have stayed. Gosh why I sold is something I can't answer. But I came back in today. I think I will stay here for a while. I feel safe, and my Money Market account is paying a whopping .75%"
"The 5 percent rule of investing is a general investment philosophy that an individual investor should allocate no more than 5 percent of their portfolio to one investment security. My PPL shares are currently just 1.7% of my portfolio. It used be more than double that amount. I guess the overall stock market has outperformed PPL (since I last checked some time ago). Of course, dividends are not taken into account of the overall return (PPL has been paying out significantly more than the average total stock market). My PPL dividend percentage is 19%."
"The current 5. 9% dividend looks safe. In the midst of a pandemic, the earnings were quite decent:---Adjusting for special items, third-quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations (non-GAAP) were $450 million, or $0.58 per share, compared to $445 million, or $0.61 per share, a year ago.---PPL narrowed its 2020 earnings from ongoing operations forecast range to $2.40 to $2.50 per share from $2.40 to $2.60 per share. ---The future looks good."
I've been noticing more and more volume coming in. does anyone think we could be on the verge of a breakout? 32$??????
"Power Power Light(PPL) joins Electric Highway Coalition to made up of 17 electric companies to establish charging stations up and down the Atlantic coast, to Midwest , and southern states to begin with. This will be crushing competition for the likes of Blink, Chargepoint. It was a matter of time."
The SALE of UK has happened! stock price can go back to at least mid 30's now!
PPL reducing LT debt by 4.6B. Looks like roughly $175mm in annual interest expense reduction. Looks like the dividend on the common is safe.
30!!!!! Mama told me there'd be days like this.
I will raise my number of shares in the next few days. People will panic and sell off great stocks like this. Not looking to get rich quick. Just looking for solid dividend stocks for my portfolio. Who stops using electric?
"On selling UK operations:Andrew Bischof, a senior analyst for Morningstar who covers PPL, said the move makes sense, given the challenging U.K. regulatory environment that presented uncertainty for future earnings. Selling the U.K. business will allow PPL to simplify its business and provide a “clearer story for investors,” continuing a trend in the utility industry over the last five to 10 years, Bischof said."
It is estimated that an average full charge of ev's will cost about $10 A Household with two vehicles need to charge twice a week that's about $40/ household going to PPL.Sweet.
"I use this stock as emergency savings, I like to think safe and much better than bank interest."
A company doesn't buy back its own stock if it has any intention of cutting the dividend. The company is also paying down debt. They also just jettisoned the business in the UK and thank God they're focusing on the business in the US. Stay focused.
Been watching this stock for long time - regretted not getting in around $27 as I watched it move to $40. Looks like I'll get another chance.
"Sold all my shares @30 , had enough"
"Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here! Alberta got its wish for the inclusion of support for large-scale, industrial carbon capture in the federal budget.The federal budget documents released Monday include plans for an investment tax credit for carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) projects. The technology – which forces carbon-dioxide emissions deep into the ground, keeping them out of the atmosphere – could play a major role in lowering outputs at refineries, cement and fertilizer production plants and power stations across the country. Significantly, it could also help to reduce emissions at Alberta oil sands operations.Details of the investment tax credit have yet to be fleshed out. Ottawa says it will move quickly to a 90-day consultation period on the design of the credit, after which it will announce more details, including the rate of the incentive.$SU $ENB $IMO $CNQ $TRP $PKI $PPL $"
"Just eased into some more shares @$30.25, just a whisker from a 5.5% yield. I'm tired of waiting for my hero price of $30 and below. If it goes that low, I buy some 'mo..."
Don't know who is selling today on positive earnings and guidance. Maybe its currency between US and Europe......Bottom line the stock should be going up...…..
"I came on this board to see if I could get a feel for what PPL might be able to get for their British assets. Will it be enough to justify the fact that they are giving up roughly half of their revenue base? All I have seen so far on this board is politics. Politics is important of course, but does anyone on here know anything about PPL? Is their plan to get out of England viable?"
We all learned that utilities are supposed to be stable securities in times of market stress and usually suffer the least damage in market downturns. Two days before the 1800 point plunge this group started selling off hard. The same situation occurred just before the investing community woke up and realized our country was in deep trouble with the pandemic in late February. Here we are again with many of these stocks having taken a 10 to 15 percent haircut. One day the pandemic will be more under control and the majority of people infected won't die. If you can afford to buy more of your favorite utilities do it. And while your at the airlines might be worth a look. Their future month bookings are starting to improve. The analysts pay less attention too and just use common sense....
A 6.5% annual dividend with solid earnings while money markets funds are paying almost 0 and 30 year T bonds are paying 1.4%.
PPL Corp maintained its guidance for 2020 EPS from ongoing operations in the range of $2.40-$2.60 with a midpoint of $2.50. It's not a cruise line.
Reading the story about the Kentucky rate review. Is KGE and KU both part of PPL ?? I'm not sure but the story shows up in yahoo under PPL.It doesn't look like a good deal just off the surface of the article.
so when are they going to tell us what the dividend is.
Lot of talk here about a divvie cut but price keeps creeping up. Has to be a reason(s) why.
"I guess investors aren't too happy about the 5.8 % dividend and the reaffirmed outlook. After all, the 10 year t note is paying a wopping 0.81 %."
PPL gets pushed around via the XLU etf index. But the the yield on XLU isn’t that good.PPL still should be closer to $30.
Market is down big again. Market is not stable and most utilities are down not just PPL.
sooner or later this will rise.
"One would think that the extremely low interest rates and the consistent need for electricity and gas would be considered a positive for many of these utilities. Even if certain facilities closed for a time due to the virus, people would still be paying for energy for their homes. Utilities are not in the cruise business. PPL now pays a dividend of 6.2%. Even if they cut their dividend, they would still probably be paying over 4% in an environment where interest rates are headed to zero."
Anyone who purchased stock in PPL 5 years ago had a total return of 15% (includes price + dividend). Anyone who purchased a S&P 500 index Fund 5 years ago would have had a 98.6% increase in the share price. That doesn’t include dividends which were around 2% each year (so tack on another 10% to that total).
"will I get the divi if I buy today? Never understand these dates, 6/7 ex divi date?"
"Yep, Morgan Stanley upgrades stocks that will not have earnings for years. And now they downgrad this 6.5 % yielding stock after PPL says earnings will face a minimal hit and the company will earn$ 2.40 to 2.60 a share. Brilliant. And the analyst get paid hundreds of thousands a year for this BS."
"This is the perfect utility stock IMO. Safe dividend, solid financial strength, good stock price stability, etc. Very rare to find a utility yielding at or more than 4% in this day and age. A few years ago that wasn't the case but now stocks like this are exceptionally rare. Capital gains are a bonus for me I own this primarily for the yield."
I have a question. How often are dividends payed? My broker said every month but I doubt that.
Thats it ! not buying anymore am sure it will be up Monday when offering is done
What an absolutely beautiful stock
This is the best-run utility in the country. This $50 stock is inflation-proof and ready to run!
"So, with the explosion of the Electric Vehicle market , electric charging stocks like BLNK have just begun to take off. BUT, what about those company's that sell electricity. PPL stock price will benefit by this giant shift. You heard it first here. Don't fight the laws of supply and demand!! $38.00 6-9mos!!"
Bought a few more shares a Few more shares at $25.60 PPL I feel is in a trading range things might change in September October time frame but as of now the dividend holds a floor under the stock price.
Earnings are out. Missed by 3 cents. Everything looks good and still sticking with year guidance. With all that is going on things look good with earnings
"Can someone explain to me the long term strategy for this company? They are selling their UK assets which includes approximately 8 million ratepayers and acquiring a RI company that has 780,000 ratepayers. The net from this transaction is in the neighborhood of 10 billion but they currently have near 25 billion in debt. This is a substantial cut in ratepayers which = less cash flow. How is this a good deal in the long term? Their KY operations currently rely on coal for generation and they’ve got to be taking a lot of heat from environmentalists for that. Interest rates look to benefit utilities in the next couple years but I need a more compelling reason to consider buying this company. Can someone outline their strategy?"
Anyone out there who thinks the current quaterly dividend is sustainable? Chances are that future earnings over the next couple years will be lower than the current payout. I think we may be looking at a cut.
for some reason a lot of stocks go down even after posting good to great earnings. Its happened to my MSFT many times but have kept it. After PPL dropped $1.25 yesterday I bought half of what I want. If it drops I will buy more. I can't see this staying down especially as we near dividend date. I got in at the 6.7% dividend rate. wish i bought when it was under $20 a little while ago.
Something is not right here. The stock is down 2.9% the day before it goes ex-div. At the current rate we will see over 4x the normal volume.
"Consider that short-term rates are zero or almost zero, I understand why no one wants a 6% + yield that the company maintains will be paid. Yep, much better to buy companies with low revenues, no profit, and a PE of 291 that are being traded like baseball cards by 20 year olds."
"PPL, Kroger and a few others will meet the EPS numbers......they are sustainable and deserve to trade at a premium"
Will she finally break 30?
"Utilities have been bond proxies ever since the Fed slashed rates. Obviously as rates tick up to historical norms utilities will drift downward....but only to a point. Earnings still matter, growth still matters, and the Fed won't lift rates to the moon over night. That being said PPL pays a heft dividend, and is will be considered defensive when the market eventually pulls back. Do I see it at $40 near term, no but I don't see it drifting too much below $25. A buy here secures the dividend and PPL should bounce back to $27.50...and over time back up to $40. It's a slow growth, defensive, dividend paying stock for retirees."
"Buy the dips on this stock and you rarely lose. Under $30, good price. Under $28, even better. If it gets into the $25 / $26 range it's a screaming buy. One of the best run utilities in the country. LONG AND STRONG"
"Does anyone have a guess as to why PPL has not fully recovered from the COVID crash last year? It seems to have recovered about 1/3 of the way up that cliff, but no further. The market has recovered and then some. I just added to my holdings expecting that we can make up the rest of that gap, but I'd like to hear why people think we haven't done so already."
Added to my PPL holdings today...it was on sale
"May 08, 202005:38 pm ET... CFRA Maintains Strong Buy Opinion on Shares of PPL Corporation(24.29*****): We lower our 12-month target price to $32 from $40 on lower peervaluations, reflecting 13.3x our 2020 EPS estimate, a discount to peers givenour view of a below-peer growth rate. We narrow our ’20 EPS estimate to$2.41 from $2.55 and our ’21 estimate to $2.49 from $2.50. PPL reportsQ1 EPS of $0.67 vs. $0.70, $0.05 below the S&P Capital IQ consensusestimate driven by $0.04 of share dilution and lower sales volumes primarilydue to mild weather in the U.S., partially offset by additional returns oncapital investments. We expect lower commercial and industrial (C&I) loadand higher residential loads in all of PPL’s jurisdictions due toCovid-19 and work-from-home protocols. However, we see minimal impact toPPL’s capital and rate-based growth plans, which should lead tolonger-term growth, and investment grade credit ratings (A-, Baa2). Sharesyield 6.8%, providing additional return. /Paige Meyer"
I firmly believe PPL and DUK are similar as PPL has cleaned up its sloppy balance sheet and is finally on the right track financially. Here's my calculation of PPL's value in terms of DUK's dividend:.....................PPL............DUKDividend....1.66...........3.94Price.........29.19......106.88ForwardDiv Yield....5.69%........3.69%Parity..........3.69%.......5.69%Dividend....1.66...........3.94ImpliedPrice.........44.99.........69.24Conclusion: Either DUK is severely overvalued or PPL is extremely undervalued. I believe PPL has serious room to run.
got in with a thou.shares looks like a solid stock with potential to go up and a nice dividend
"Can't turn away from this great price and dividend.. I already owned about 3000 shrs. I just bought 3500 more at this price.People are selling defensive stocks because the market is going into hyperdrive. It's crazy. Like Dave said earlier: ""(mostly young) people are buying stocks that are in serious trouble because they don't know what they're doing."" (not an exact quote but he's right. Look at what happened to Hertz !! )I'll take my safe retirement dividend thank you very much."
Brexit deal makes this one good to go.......along with a great dividend !
Merger coming. PPL is a target. The dividend payout is 1.5x the cost of borrowing money. 7 million UK customers is the queen's crown jewel.
Beautiful entry
"If PPL pays down some of their debt, this should add to their earnings."
"Pandemic performance is better than I expected. FFO covers div adequately divesting the UK business will lower overhead and streamline management and report consolidation. This will pick up after next stimulus, again after covid vacc. And again when the divestment proves beneficial"
"I doubled down on PPL. All the factors are aligned for a healthy run into the $40. Improving balance sheet, well run, inflation-proof, buyback, shedding of unprofitable/low-profit subsideries, and an excellent dividend."
Just sold some things that I was up a very little bit on to add to PPL the dividend right now at this price is 6.29 you can’t do much better than that With a relatively safe company I think the Dividend will be paid going forward if that is the case this is a tremendous opportunity to Get a great yield
"I bought some shares yesterday, I think it is time for a positive change in utility companies. If we can start manufacturing some products here in the USA, that should be a boost for utility companies. I sold most of my gold and silver funds and mining stocks a couple of weeks ago. I had held them for 7 years and lost half of my investment, have replaced them with dividend paying stocks. Might of been a mistake or maybe I should have made the change a long time ago, will just have to wait and see."
"Morgan Stanley adjusts PPL's Price Target to $31 From $30, Maintains Equal-Weight Rating."
PPL under $20?PPL under $25?What a deal.... I only got a little bit in the teens... not working with a “lot” of money But will have a nice solid dividend payment for the long term.
"$ES $NEE $DUK $POR $ED $EIX $AGR $PPL all have the current ROE below of 8,7%. Does it mean what all these companies are SELL too?"
when I was a kid growing up in Bethlehem my parents own to PP&l and they looked forward to their quarterly dividend checks. That was a very different kind of company than it is today. It is not easy to take a coal generated utility and transition it to a more greener source but they are doing it and they're doing a great job while keeping dividend increases in play. Congratulations! for all you other gamblers go buy some Tesla stock.
"Dividend = 5.91%""The company also maintained its commitment to dividends as a key component of total shareowner return, announcing a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.4150 per share, payable April 1, 2021, to shareowners of record as of March 10, 2021. The dividend will mark the company's 301st consecutive quarterly dividend paid since 1946."""
"""ubs adjust ppl price target from 31$ to 32$ reiterate a buy rating"""
The real money is going to be made in natural gas and uranium those are the two commodities that spin the turbines required to make all the electricity to recharge these millions of cars that are seem to be coming on the market my biggest holdings has just merged it was Cabot oil and gas the symbol is still the same they’re going to be a powerhouse 50% oil 50% natural gas in they are on hedged come January 1 the symbol is COG .
Wonder if Wall Street will pick up on electric utilities becoming a growth story or if they will stick with overcapitalized exercise bike companies.
"Began selling my position on each rally. 24,000 shares down, 6000 yet to go. Buying oil& gas companies much better chance for increasing dividends and share price growth. Have owned PPL for 11 years, but I’m not risking the dividend cut which is sure to happen. The market has already priced in the cut."
"Ok people. I agree that PPL is viewed as a divided stock for conservative investors, I get that....BUT, we need to try to have a little fun. So, let me try to get things going. I think the UK sale terms will be announced sometime in the next couple months. We got through Brexit (huge), and now we need to tame the covid threat. My simple and arguably flawed math thinks that the pps will jump close to $2 on that news. Then, the price will continue on a solid trajectory upward due to the favorable way the company is going to handle the proceeds. Now, I realize that was non technical but often, that sort of forecast is more accurate than crunching valid numbers. Ok, thanks for your support! :-)"
Analyst asked about the dividend and they said they won't have the information on what the dividend will be until after the Rhode Island deal closes. Also not looking at any Merger or Acquisitions but looking at buybacks.
PPL looking for U.S. Electric or NG play to replace UK Revenue stream. NJR is one of the several firms being looked at. They only want to spend $5 billion no more..
Ain’t nobody cutting no dividend here.
I like this deal. They shed $14B in debt and bring in $10B in cash. Net debt after deal will $10B. Pay some of that down and refinance duration. Divvy isn’t being cut and they will probably do a buyback. They currently pay $0.33/share in interest per quarter.
Mizuho upgrade from neutral to buy. Price target 30.
What I don't understand is that when PPL had the UK portion this company was beaten down and treated like garbage and we need to unload it ASAP. All the Brexit negative news and uncertainty hurt the share price. So PPL sells the UK portion. Good news right?! It's what was holding us down. In comes National Grid and buys the UK portion. So what happens? National Grid goes up almost at a 52 week high. PPL? Stuck in the same level of share price hovering at the $28 dollar mark. Stock seems stuck in the mud. Now more uncertainty of the Rhode Island purchase holding it down? Seems like this stock always has some type of uncertainty and doesn't want to move. Yes I am holding for the dividend and hopefully it stands but I would love to see some upward stock momentum. Boring stock or not.
A nice recovery from the stock's 52-week low of $25.30. And even at the current price the stock still yields a tad over 5% for new purchases. My split adjusted cost basis of around $8.70 (includes Talen spinoff) gives me a 19% dividend yield. Purchase date is just 2 days shy of 19 years ago.
"I hope the write down of european operations only depresses the stock price. The dividend should be maintained. I am not sure,but Dominion had a huge write off with nuclear power plant construction and did not cut dividend. PPL may not raise the dividend as fast as other utilities,but I am not selling my stock. I bought some more when it dipped below $29. A hot summer with lots of Air conditioners running and economy oepning up should give the company a welcome boost."
"PPL has a remarkable dividend. After the Brexit hype settles, the share price will move to $35."
Would think analysts could upgrade to a $35 price target to start.
Utilities are going to be a big player in the electric car process and the grids will be important to keep them on the road.
"Sold @ 38 a while back, bought back 1200 shares today @ 29.99. Dividend yield of 5.5% is fine with me.Will hold and only sell if it goes back up near 38."
Making moves!
"I like the price here. However, I do not understand why this stock sold this hard to begin with.Sure Fed's raising rate, but this violent reaction typically would be better justified by something that's going on with the company.Questions:(1) I evaluated the cash flow statement, capEx has always been this high, so why the sell off now?(2) Dividend pay-out is small percentage of the overall ""FFO"" if you will, FFO ~ $2.5 Billion, dividend payout ~ $1B. So that seems ok to me.(3) I can see that borrowing was excessive last year. Could this have triggered this major sell-off?I'm trying to become an investor here and would appreciate some analysis on the fundamentals.Thanks much!"
PPL dividends safe? I say so. New has UK division up for sale which was purchased for $5+billion and will likely fetch 12billion plus according to reports. Debt on UK division about $6billion resulting in huge cash infusion to expand/development US markets. PPL has new CEO and last thing he wants to do is cut dividends.
Their sale of the UK business suddenly looks really smart at the moment.
Almost at yearly high to date.
"Monthly hit to earnings during lockdown of between 3 to 4 cents (per month). Much lower than most of us thought. PPL should be worth closer to $30, which would translate into a 5.5% dividend yield."

"Section 7- Regulation FD Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure On December 18, 2018, U.K. utility regulator Ofgem issued a consultation related to its RIIO-2 price controls that will run from 2021 to 2026 for gas distribution, gas transmission and electricity transmission operators, seeking input from a wide variety of stakeholders. The document released today is a proposal for consideration and comment.The consultation document does not apply to electricity distribution network operators (""DNOs""), including PPL Corporation's (""PPL"") Western Power Distribution (""WPD"") networks in the U.K., and does not have any impact on PPL's current business plans or WPD operations.A full consultation related to DNOs will begin in 2020, with new rates for DNOs not taking effect until April 2023. PPL and WPD will continue to provide input and engage with Ofgem throughout the consultation process to arrive at the best outcomes for all stakeholders."
"Over the last few years this has been very frustrating to watch. I read the reports and I listen to every call and u hear alot of things being communicated but the share price has not improved or even got to where I bought it years and years ago. Even with all the dividends I am still at a loss. My confidence has really dropped and I am worried about the future of the dividend. Not the company itself, as I am not questioning that but many people rely on that dividend. Since the share price has been consistently in this range if a cut were to happen it wouldn't be pretty unless it's just a small amount. I am believing that they know that their shareholders have been frustrated and that they work to keep the dividend the same. Buy backs are nice but people favor the dividend over buyback. Especially when you have no capital gains year after year. If you did get in at $26 good for you then you are actually ahead. Good luck!"
"After reading all the comments here, negative sentiment, ALL the utilities should be ripe for a nice bounce. Too much attention is paid to the 10 yr treasury The way utilities are being priced you would think we are already at about 3.75%. That's nine months away and a lot can happen between now and then. One day this 'pos' will be back in the mid-thirties.....the trick is you need to know when to hold them and when to fold them. It's too late to fold....."
If Berkshire Hathaway Is Buying Dominion Energy's Gas Transmission Business for $9.7 Billion PPL Corporation is hugely undervalued.
Wow - UK regulator CMA green lights the deal. Wasn’t expecting early approval.
