"The state of dining in Canada. Grocerants are rising to take marketshare from traditional dining places. Fortunately, MIDD is immune to that shift. As long as demand for prepared foods - be it dining out or take-home - continues to grow, MIDD is set to capture sales and grow along with that trend. And their residential product lines will cater to demands the high-end at-home cuisiners.I just hope that in 2018 the Viking saga ends and finally stops being a drag.>>>In the meantime, grocery stores have been nibbling away at restaurants’ market share, said food expert Sylvain Charlebois, dean of management at Dalhousie University in Halifax, particularly pointing to “grocerants” — larger grocery stores that allow customers to take home a broadening variety of fresh-prepared meals or sit down at a table to eat the food on site. Indeed, the fastest-growing meal segment in 2016 was ready-prepared meals at grocers, meal kit companies and other retailers, NPD confirmed, with an eight-per-cent market share and growth of 20 per cent a year. “The worlds of food retailing and foodservice are colliding, and that is going to continue for a while,” Charlebois said. “Grocery stores don’t want to lose traffic in their stores.” http://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/new-menus-might-not-be-enough-to-help-family-restaurants-jump-start-sales-amid-ever-growing-competition"

"Got a great report from http://earthsciencetech.com/?symbol=MIDD about $MIDD. I did have to subscribe but it was worth the time. Thank you guys for the tip! Investing day trading. ""rht"""
"With a decent earnings report (which I expect) I can see us at $145-150 by tomorrow,"
"CEO and CFO speak about the strong sales growth and martket potential of emerging markets at the recent earnings call@@@@Timothy FitzGerald CFO--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It has been strong all year. Each quarter has exceeded 20% this year for the international sales market. That has been a focus area for us, particularly in the emerging markets, and we have invested heavily in that area. Historically we have grown around that 20% region. That being said, we are pleasantly surprised because last year was more challenging in the markets, and although market conditions have improved, they are not back to where they were I would say a few years ago. But there is a lot of good activity with local chains in the markets, so we are continuing to, I would say expand the business beyond just the kind of the global major US chains.Selim Bassoul CEO--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jason, I would like to step in and give you some specific where we are going with our global market, not only in food service, but also through our food processing. If you look at global middle class, by 2030 it will double all over the emerging markets. I'm not talking Europe, I'm talking emerging markets. If you look at that alone, and you look at 64% of the world middle class population is in Asia, and I'm not talking China only, but I am talking Asia, which means including that I put part of the Middle East it in it and southeast Asia, and I think worldwide 40% percent of all of the consumption will come from this group.So as you look at our global platform, where we have literally done a very large scalable global footprint, and look at investment there not only in service and sales but in manufacturing, and where we have our location for our personnel to be close to our customers, I'm not only talking US customer, but local as Tim mentioned, our local emerging chains are doing very well with us. And I look at this and I say, we are poised for growth. Again, as I said in my previous answer to the question, if it is quarter to quarter we will know? No. When you look year over year, we will continue growing double digit in that segment. We continue to invest. Literally we have a competitive advantage, than any of other competitor in our global platform. It is unique. It is the way it serves our customer. The way we have created that, and now we have been doing that since 1996-1997, and we have literally the most scalable, and the largest global footprint, for both the food processing and the food service."
MIDD reached a new 52 Week Low at 106.39
Heading to $115. Nothing to support MIDD but hot air. Company must be very concerned about Tariffs. Will need to reevaluate their numbers soon due to low overseas sales.
Outstanding quarterly results and outlook. Superior management team.
buying opportunity
MIDD is down -13.39% to 114.01
"Organic sales figures, though, were downright ugly for Middleby during the quarter. Both acquisitions and foreign exchange impacts helped to boost Middleby's revenue figures, with purchased businesses helping to boost sales by 10%. That left organic sales down 5.7% for the quarter, pulling down the full-year figure to a 3.6% loss."
Interesting video on Taylor made https://youtu.be/SrDEtSlqJC4
Here's an Idea why not LOW or HD buy out this company. Another avenue of income selling their products already. JCP getting into the appliance and hospitality business. Any opinions??
MIDD is up 8.12% to 114.29
Still 1/2 of 52 week high of $141.
MIDD is down -8.12% to 117.40
"$WBT will run to $50, this is 95.5% held by institution and $MIDD is $177 right now, they are heavily invested in this company"
Taking profit and buy back on dip.
Another great quarter. Stock has tripled since last year.
PE of 24...down it goes after the Feds raise rates. Invest in TBT much safer.
"FYI- - Just another article knocking this stock They have a short position in it. Volume is on the high side. No recovery in site even after a recovery from the lows of the day. Making Lower lows is not good for us longs. Prescience Point Capital Management (""Prescience Point""), a private investment manager that focuses on deep investigations of public companies, today published a critical research report supporting its short position in shares of The Middleby Corporation(MIDD) , one of the largest providers of industrial kitchen equipment to quick-and full-service restaurants, retail outlets, and hotels.After a months-long investigation that included a deep forensic analysis of the company's financial statements and interviews with key distributors and restaurant industry experts, Prescience Point believes Wall Street is overly optimistic about the company's ability to recover from the devastating impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the restaurant industry. Middleby (MIDD) had already been struggling before COVID-19 as many of its large restaurant chain customers pushed out capex and delayed projects. For years, Middleby(MIDD) was able to hide deteriorating organic growth with progressively larger but lower quality acquisitions. As demand starts to disappear and leverage nears all-time high, Middleby's(MIDD) debt-fueled roll-up strategy is set to implode. Restaurants are permanently closing their doors at a record pace, over-levered chains are cutting unit growth & capex, large franchisee groups teeter on the edge of bankruptcy, and a flood of lightly used equipment is about to hit the market. Yet, Wall Street expects Middleby(MIDD) to have a ""V"" shaped recovery and post record profit and margins in fiscal year 2021. We believe this is nearly impossible. According to interviews with key players, foodservice equipment purchases are down as much as 85% and many large foodservice equipment distributors are gearing up for a wave of used equipment about to hit the market. In addition, we were told some distributors were working with suppliers to return inventory as the new equipment market could all but dry up. We value Middleby's(MIDD) shares at $26.91, implying 50% downside.""Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic has devastated the restaurant industry and Middleby(MIDD), with its giant debt load and declining organic growth, will be severely impacted,"" said Eiad Asbahi, Founder and Portfolio Manager of Prescience Point. ""Even though shares have already fallen 50% this year, we believe investors are still too optimistic in their projections for Middleby's(MIDD) sales and profits and the stock could be cut in half again."""
I believe MIDD sell a lit of product overseas? Look out below...Tariffs coming.
Listened to earnings call today. Superior management team that skillfully navigated through pandemic
"What gives with this one??? Mkt up 600 points and it could not even hold its gains how pathetic (should of been up near 60 today). Very sad this might be a very short term trade rather than a buy and hold, Good luck to us longs."
Started a position
"I've had this stock for many years. It preformed well for most of that time. But, the last couple of years are flat, and they refuse to pay dividends. So, why am I keeping this stock when other are growing or at least, paying good dividends? I struggle for an answer to that question..."
MIDD is down -100.00% to 0.00
Great entry point being provided at $110.
MIDD downgraded today to SELL.
Don't bet against Selim Bassoul. He is one of those rare CEO's that manages to successfully acquire and integrate companies. Look at the 5-10 year chart. Great company!
"Great returns over the long term, but flat for past 5 years. This may not be the thing anymore....."
Buy on this dip?
"So explain to me how this is even a 78 stock, when no one will even try to venture out not because of BS covid restrictions but because of the riots. I guess everybody got alot money to spend on SubZ and Viking ranges at home. This stock sb at best $10stock, nevermind most of its Equity is made up of Intangible Assets that need a very real impairment check. The book on this sb below $5."
I do not understand why the miss.I have had this stock for over 10 years with excellent returns
This company practically owns every Foodservice equipment Mfg. They have been buying up big brands for years and gaining market share. The tariffs are being passed on through the channel with price increases. I am a buyer!
"My guess is that Selim, being a very good person stayed on as President through the most recent ""misses"" or ""rocky times"" and only handed the company off to Fitz when he knew the next several comps would be better.I think we'll see $140+ in 12-15 months,..or about a 20% gain."
MIDD conundrum... to buy or not to buy as the stock nears 100. If it fails support here the next floor down is ~82.
"I just listened to the earnings call. Viking is officially growing again (boy that was a painful few years), and Mr. Bassoul stated that 2018 will mark a business-wide return to growth for the company following a 2017 that saw efforts to reassure dealers and distributors spooked by fears of competition from the QualServ acquisition and a consolidation of their sales organization that greatly lowered headcount and brought in newly trained recruits. Mr. Bassoul needs badly to score a home run this year to keep shareholders onside."
"Mr. Bassoul is relatively young, at 61. But he has enriched himself, Yahoo reports he owns 660K shares.You can read his ""retirement"" both ways. Maybe he does want to do philanthropy, or maybe he got tired of struggling to make the numbers every quarter. In any case, this is a turning point for Middleby, he will be missed."
New purchase today after a long absence but no recovery now the mkt has cut its loss in half very disappointing and ugly day all around.
