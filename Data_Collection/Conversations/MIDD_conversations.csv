"Viking new product lines expected to lead legacy by end of this year. Long overdue but the end looks finally in sight.@@@The 7-Series product line on the cooking side continues to be growing extremely fast, and this is a line that we have introduced under Middleby which has all the Middleby technology, the burners that are non-clog burners, the no pre-heat ovens. We are also, we were missing basically a contemporary or what I call an urban product line. So, New York City, Chicago, Miami, LA, high-rises, so we did not have this line. It's not only in looks but it's size. So it fits in a different type of kitchen and we are launching that later this year, a complete line called Virtuoso. So, from that perspective, what we have been waiting for is the flow of the product line we needed, and we are starting to see. So we go back to 7-Series ranges doing extremely well, our French-Door Oven is doing well, and then our 7-Series refrigeration and we are getting Virtuoso launched at the end of this year. And now we'll most probably start, once we introduce 7-Series refrigeration and it obsoletes the 5-Series, and we start obsoleting the legacy products, I think we're going to start seeing a significant improvement in top line at Viking. Now the timing is most probably, I would say again, like everything else, we launch a product, by the time we put it in the dealer displays, I'm looking at most probably towards starting to see that happening towards the end of this year.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4073000-middlebys-midd-ceo-selim-bassoul-q1-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single"

"With a decent earnings report (which I expect) I can see us at $145-150 by tomorrow,"
"Best in class or exit@So, between us and our competitors there is a big fundamental difference. We are very focused on what we do. We are very focused on being the best in class in what we do. And the day the product is not best in class, we'll cut it off. Even though the customer would want it, we will say go buy it from somebody else because we're not best in class in that product. That's why when we look at speed-cooking -- we look at our pizza oven, we look at our fryers, we look at our beverage, we are best in class in what we do."
MIDD missed their own projected estimates the last three Qtrs. Now they lowered projections for the next Qrt. So it seems to me business and revenues are going down not growing. No way can MIDD hold this kind of EPS. No dividends and I believe they don't even give raises to their employees. They squeeze the employees so they can show profits. And....the CEO keeps selling stock. Poor business model.

"The state of dining in Canada. Grocerants are rising to take marketshare from traditional dining places. Fortunately, MIDD is immune to that shift. As long as demand for prepared foods - be it dining out or take-home - continues to grow, MIDD is set to capture sales and grow along with that trend. And their residential product lines will cater to demands the high-end at-home cuisiners.I just hope that in 2018 the Viking saga ends and finally stops being a drag.>>>In the meantime, grocery stores have been nibbling away at restaurants’ market share, said food expert Sylvain Charlebois, dean of management at Dalhousie University in Halifax, particularly pointing to “grocerants” — larger grocery stores that allow customers to take home a broadening variety of fresh-prepared meals or sit down at a table to eat the food on site. Indeed, the fastest-growing meal segment in 2016 was ready-prepared meals at grocers, meal kit companies and other retailers, NPD confirmed, with an eight-per-cent market share and growth of 20 per cent a year. “The worlds of food retailing and foodservice are colliding, and that is going to continue for a while,” Charlebois said. “Grocery stores don’t want to lose traffic in their stores.” http://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/new-menus-might-not-be-enough-to-help-family-restaurants-jump-start-sales-amid-ever-growing-competition"

"Organic sales figures, though, were downright ugly for Middleby during the quarter. Both acquisitions and foreign exchange impacts helped to boost Middleby's revenue figures, with purchased businesses helping to boost sales by 10%. That left organic sales down 5.7% for the quarter, pulling down the full-year figure to a 3.6% loss."

"I just listened to the earnings call. Viking is officially growing again (boy that was a painful few years), and Mr. Bassoul stated that 2018 will mark a business-wide return to growth for the company following a 2017 that saw efforts to reassure dealers and distributors spooked by fears of competition from the QualServ acquisition and a consolidation of their sales organization that greatly lowered headcount and brought in newly trained recruits. Mr. Bassoul needs badly to score a home run this year to keep shareholders onside."

"Mr. Bassoul is relatively young, at 61. But he has enriched himself, Yahoo reports he owns 660K shares.You can read his ""retirement"" both ways. Maybe he does want to do philanthropy, or maybe he got tired of struggling to make the numbers every quarter. In any case, this is a turning point for Middleby, he will be missed."

"CEO and CFO speak about the strong sales growth and martket potential of emerging markets at the recent earnings call@@@@Timothy FitzGerald CFO--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It has been strong all year. Each quarter has exceeded 20% this year for the international sales market. That has been a focus area for us, particularly in the emerging markets, and we have invested heavily in that area. Historically we have grown around that 20% region. That being said, we are pleasantly surprised because last year was more challenging in the markets, and although market conditions have improved, they are not back to where they were I would say a few years ago. But there is a lot of good activity with local chains in the markets, so we are continuing to, I would say expand the business beyond just the kind of the global major US chains.Selim Bassoul CEO--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jason, I would like to step in and give you some specific where we are going with our global market, not only in food service, but also through our food processing. If you look at global middle class, by 2030 it will double all over the emerging markets. I'm not talking Europe, I'm talking emerging markets. If you look at that alone, and you look at 64% of the world middle class population is in Asia, and I'm not talking China only, but I am talking Asia, which means including that I put part of the Middle East it in it and southeast Asia, and I think worldwide 40% percent of all of the consumption will come from this group.So as you look at our global platform, where we have literally done a very large scalable global footprint, and look at investment there not only in service and sales but in manufacturing, and where we have our location for our personnel to be close to our customers, I'm not only talking US customer, but local as Tim mentioned, our local emerging chains are doing very well with us. And I look at this and I say, we are poised for growth. Again, as I said in my previous answer to the question, if it is quarter to quarter we will know? No. When you look year over year, we will continue growing double digit in that segment. We continue to invest. Literally we have a competitive advantage, than any of other competitor in our global platform. It is unique. It is the way it serves our customer. The way we have created that, and now we have been doing that since 1996-1997, and we have literally the most scalable, and the largest global footprint, for both the food processing and the food service."
Outstanding quarterly results and outlook. Superior management team.

"FYI- - Just another article knocking this stock They have a short position in it. Volume is on the high side. No recovery in site even after a recovery from the lows of the day. Making Lower lows is not good for us longs. Prescience Point Capital Management (""Prescience Point""), a private investment manager that focuses on deep investigations of public companies, today published a critical research report supporting its short position in shares of The Middleby Corporation(MIDD) , one of the largest providers of industrial kitchen equipment to quick-and full-service restaurants, retail outlets, and hotels.After a months-long investigation that included a deep forensic analysis of the company's financial statements and interviews with key distributors and restaurant industry experts, Prescience Point believes Wall Street is overly optimistic about the company's ability to recover from the devastating impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the restaurant industry. Middleby (MIDD) had already been struggling before COVID-19 as many of its large restaurant chain customers pushed out capex and delayed projects. For years, Middleby(MIDD) was able to hide deteriorating organic growth with progressively larger but lower quality acquisitions. As demand starts to disappear and leverage nears all-time high, Middleby's(MIDD) debt-fueled roll-up strategy is set to implode. Restaurants are permanently closing their doors at a record pace, over-levered chains are cutting unit growth & capex, large franchisee groups teeter on the edge of bankruptcy, and a flood of lightly used equipment is about to hit the market. Yet, Wall Street expects Middleby(MIDD) to have a ""V"" shaped recovery and post record profit and margins in fiscal year 2021. We believe this is nearly impossible. According to interviews with key players, foodservice equipment purchases are down as much as 85% and many large foodservice equipment distributors are gearing up for a wave of used equipment about to hit the market. In addition, we were told some distributors were working with suppliers to return inventory as the new equipment market could all but dry up. We value Middleby's(MIDD) shares at $26.91, implying 50% downside.""Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic has devastated the restaurant industry and Middleby(MIDD), with its giant debt load and declining organic growth, will be severely impacted,"" said Eiad Asbahi, Founder and Portfolio Manager of Prescience Point. ""Even though shares have already fallen 50% this year, we believe investors are still too optimistic in their projections for Middleby's(MIDD) sales and profits and the stock could be cut in half again."""
I do not understand why the miss.I have had this stock for over 10 years with excellent returns
what's going on with the price action in midd? a drop from 130 to 120 in a couple of days? will the bounce off of 120 be higher than 122?
MIDD is up 8.12% to 114.29
A nice day today to start the month all the trolls left at the end of last month now lets start the real uptrend. Best of luck to us longs.
"My guess is that Selim, being a very good person stayed on as President through the most recent ""misses"" or ""rocky times"" and only handed the company off to Fitz when he knew the next several comps would be better.I think we'll see $140+ in 12-15 months,..or about a 20% gain."

"From the earnings call Q&A, the CEO says this about commercial business... equipment testing activity by potential customers is the HIGHEST HE's EVER SEEN.@@@@I think that the restaurant business today, after the major recession have done a superb job in running their business. I admire all the leaders of all the restaurant chain. And when you’re not good or you don't have a product either they resign or move to somewhere and they take their intellect somewhere else to start another chain. So my issue has always been is what is the backlog of people booking a solution. If I look at that and I say wow there's nobody coming flying into our divisions to look at solution is where most probably would become my worrying state of mind. So I see people coming and they might be testing with our competitors too. But as long as they testing, solution and innovation I feel confident that the market is going to grow pretty well. And I can tell you the number of customers seeking solutions and coming to us to test, it has been the highest I’ve ever seen. So we came from show, we are busy in terms of testing, people are testing, chains are testing."

"More acquisitions will happen@And I'm just wondering about the credit facility that was recently doubled to $2.5 billion. And if I look at the gross debt of $916 million, this is a substantially large number. So I'm wondering if we can interpret that as a continuation of enthusiasm you just spoke about.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Selim Bassoul, The Middleby Corporation - Chairman and CEO [46]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, George, I think it's a continuation of the enthusiasm. I think also the fact that the acquisition pipeline continues to be out there strong -- I think what is the best thing that I've seen in the past three to five years is the number of people that have come to us to say, I want to be part of Middleby. Now, of course, some of them fit, some of them don't. Some of them -- maybe the evaluation -- we don't get to evaluation that we agree upon. But there has been a concerted effort by many players wanting to be part of Middleby."

"The three year plan@And I think that what we've done, especially at Middleby, I look at the next three years -- I'm not going to look -- I've never looked at one quarter to second. And Joel, you've been with me researching this Company for years. I've never been sucked into a guidance or into a quarterly or even a yearly corporate guidance. What we've always looked back is is the trend good over the next three years. Not the next 10 years or next five years; I'm talking the next three years. If you are investing into Middleby, what is the trend over the next three years? And I will tell you that basically I see our opportunities to be among the best. I think Middleby has never been stronger. And I think that the markets are going to be forcing many of our customers to reengineer their kitchen to drive innovation to remain competitive. So I think I'm very bullish on the next three years at Middleby and on our customers, and I will give some specific examples."
