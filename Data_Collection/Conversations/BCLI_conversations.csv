"In the process of challenging my positive assumptions regarding the expected phase III results, I came across the following (which was published by the company soon after phase II results were released):“This was a high quality Phase 2 study that identified dosing, safety, and an important efficacy signal. These data are exactly what is needed to move forward with the current Phase 3 testing,” added Dr. Merit Cudkowicz the Julieanne Dorn Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School and the Director of the Healey Center for ALS and Chair of Neurology at Mass General Hospital. “These promising results encourage us to complete the pivotal Phase 3 trial as rapidly as possible,” said Dr. Anthony Windebank, Judith and Jean Pape Adams Foundation Professor of Neuroscience at the Mayo Clinic."""
"I am long on this stock and a big fan of nurown but have to be honest and say that I think today's announcement tells us nothing new. It is no surprise that the FDA is going to consider the ""totality of the evidence"" when they review the Phase 3 results - what else would they do? With respect to identifying ""a regulatory pathway forward, including opportunities to expedite statistical review of data from the Phase 3 trial"", it seems that is the least they could do given that there is no know treatment for this fatal disease and that Nurown has already demonstrated efficacy in Phase 2 IMO. Figuring out regulatory pathways to approval is what the FDA does."
Nurown will get approved. The fda and medical community will also consider potential MS and Alzheimer future stem cell treatments and Biomarkers will provide the science behind it. They know if brainstorm does not get approved this research advance is done. They would never do this with a 35% positive response to ALS with no negative side effects. The medical community would never allow this. Neither would the ALS community.

"Dr. Merit Cudkowicz, one of the Principal Investigators of this trial and the Julianne Dorn Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School and the Director of the Healey Center for ALS and Chair of Neurology at Mass General Hospital said, ""We found a clinically meaningful response to NurOwn in a pre-specified group of patients (greater than or equal to 35 ALSFRS-R at baseline). A change in pre- to post- treatment slope of 1.25 or more is substantial and clinically important. Given the heterogeneity of ALS, it is not surprising that measurement of treatment effect may be influenced by disease severity including the behavior of disease progression rates at the lower end of the scale. It is important to fully explore this finding. In addition, NurOwn was observed to have its clear intended biological effects with important changes in the pre-specified disease and drug related biomarkers.""""This clinical trial included a more severely affected ALS population compared to other recent ALS clinical trials. We identified a superior treatment response in a pre-specified subgroup of patients with less advanced disease.”"
"It is the end of the shorters. tomrrow ,a week, two weeks it does not matter. it will be at one boom and you will loose all your savings. come on bcli.come on Israel . come on als community. the success very close. just read the FB posts of als patients that were in the trial. see the facts on yourself...we can write here until tommorow but the facts in the field are the important thing ."
Don’t forget COO Setboun has a huge incentive he helps the company land a deal with big pharma before phase 3 results are unblinded....250k shares on the line per his hiring agreement you can find when he was brought on board. Notice he will be on the Oct. 15 call to help answer investor questions...I saw something somewhere earlier today that next week is “Stem Cell Week”...maybe deal announcement prior to the call?
"Encouraging Results! ""One month post treatment, 78% (14/18) of NurOwn treated patients showed either stabilization or improvement compared to only 20% (1/5) of placebo-treated patients. Even out to 16 weeks, 33% (6/18) of NurOwn treated patients continued to be stable compared to 0% of the placebo-treated patients. As a reminder, the Phase 2 trial was only one injection of NurOwn, thus we believe these results could at least be replicated, if not improved upon, in the Phase 3 trial in which multiple doses of NurOwn are being administered."""
"BrainStorm Issues 2020 Letter to ShareholdersMon, December 28, 2020, 2:00 PM GMT+2NEW YORK, Dec. 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: BCLI), a leading developer of cellular therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, today announced the following letter from its Chief Executive Officer, Chaim Lebovits, to its shareholders and the investment community.Dear Valued Shareholders,I am incredibly proud of the tremendous progress BrainStorm made as a company in 2020. The many scientific and corporate milestones we have achieved this year are a testament to the talent and unwavering commitment of our employees, partners and investigators. I deeply appreciate the work they've done, and their ability to execute in this challenging COVID environment. I want to thank especially the patients and caregivers, who showed a steadfast dedication to our clinical trials despite the pandemic. We remain committed to bringing NurOwn to patients with neurodegenerative diseases as a much-needed treatment option. In addition, we are expanding our pipeline with the application of our exosome platform technology to include new indications that have significant unmet medical need.BrainStorm's most significant clinical milestone of 2020 was the timely completion of the NurOwn Phase 3 ALS clinical trial, despite the challenges of COVID-19. We believe the totality of evidence that we have generated are supportive of NurOwn's clinical benefit. We are diligently pursuing next steps, including active discussions with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to identify regulatory pathways that may support NurOwn's approval in ALS.While we did not demonstrate statistical significance in the primary efficacy endpoint in the full study population, pre-specified analyses suggest that NurOwn has a clinically meaningful treatment effect. For example, in a pre-specified participant subgroup with early disease and preserved function based on the ALSFRS-R baseline score, NurOwn showed the expected numerically superior treatment response compared to placebo. Furthermore, phase 3 cerebrospinal fluid neurodegenerative and inflammatory biomarkers were consistently modified by NurOwn treatment, supporting NurOwn's proposed mechanism of action in ALS. We are thankful to the FDA for prioritizing our IND, as we and the Agency clearly understand the urgency needed for ALS patients.Following the completion of our Phase 3 ALS clinical trial, we recently initiated an Expanded Access Program (EAP) to provide NurOwn treatment for patients who completed the Phase 3 trial and meet specific eligibility requirements. This EAP was developed in partnership with the FDA and will take place at the six clinical centers of excellence that participated in the trial. Initiating the EAP immediately after the Phase 3 trial's completion speaks to the promise of NurOwn's phase 3 clinical data, the urgent unmet medical need for ALS patients and our commitment to patients. The ALS physician, advocacy and patient community feedback on the EAP has been extremely positive.In parallel with the clinical programs to advance NurOwn, Brainstorm is also working to establish the manufacturing capability necessary for a commercial ramp up. To this effect, we engaged in strategic partnerships to expand our Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) capabilities. Our tech transfer to Catalent has already been initiated and will allow for continuous supply of NurOwn for future clinical trials and initial commercialization. Our work with Rapid Reshore & Development, to help BrainStorm establish in-house manufacturing capabilities, will accelerate once a regulatory pathway is clear. These agreements will help to ensure an ongoing cGMP clinical supply of NurOwn and will be integral to ensuring rapid access for patients following a potential regulatory approval. We also signed a lease agreement with the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital) in Tel Aviv, Israel, to produce NurOwn in three state-of-the-art cleanrooms. The new facility will significantly increase our manufacturing capacity, positioning us to strategically enter the European and Israeli markets. In addition to our clinical data review, we are also in active dialog with the FDA around this component of NurOwn's regulatory review. I am happy to share with you that we have recently had a successful meeting with the FDA regarding Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC). We will provide an update when the minutes are finalized."
"Avrehem Shim Mispacha:Yesterday, you responded to Felicia’s post below and stated: “The only question is whether or not the pressure will be so great that they'll stop the trial early and give it approval based on interim results -- like they should!”I think everyone agrees that NurOwn should have been approved long ago, based upon P2 data alone + a great safety profile, and the FDA has a tremendous amount of blood on their hands because of this failure. However, at this stage in the trial, there is NO WAY Brainstorm will “stop the trial early” as the trial will successfully conclude in about 9 weeks. That would just be a bad business move on Brainstorm’s part. The only possible pathway(s) forward at this point of getting NurOwn into bodies of pALS before the NDA is officially approved by the FDA next year are:1) An Executive Order from the President like he did for kidney disease. 2) HR 7071 is passed and Brainstorm applies for funding, which according to No More Excuse, Brainstorm has said they would apply so they could start providing NurOwn while the NDA is pending approval. 3) The FDA grows a heart and approves NurOwn conditionally based upon a great safety profile, P2, HEP and Matt Bellina’s data. This option is unlikely because it makes too much logical sense and the FDA is a cruel, heartless, inefficient entity. In either of these three above options, Brainstorm would still finish out the P3 trial, crunch the data, and submit an NDA."
"Trillium Therapeutics Inc. (TRIL) bought by Pfizer this morning for a 200% premium, wow. Lots of bio stocks up this morning on this news...."
cant believe I waited all day and i missed brian!! My battery died !! Can someone please upload a link when he spoke and the questions and answers after!!! Please and thankyou!! Cant Believe my battery died
I wonder what's taking them so long to resume the hearing?
"On October 21st, the stock dropped down to $9.51 and it's been slowly working it's way back up the closer we get to the FDA announcement. My educated guess is that the stock will fight its way back to the $15-$20 range by the end of the month. Three weeks to go before we finally find which way the FDA announcement goes...the stock will either plunge or shoot up like a rocket.I'm leaning hard towards the latter."
This week we skyrocket...its OUR TIME..and the patients
It's so blatantly obvious how the price of the stock and the volume is completely and totally manipulated...and has been for a long long time...at some point this will turn north...we need a catalyst.
"What I think could happen if that ALS legislation passes:The stock will get a really nice bump.ALS patients will have access to Nurown but they will have to pay out of pocket. Because of this access though, Brainstorm can acquire a lot more data that can definitively prove that Nurown works for a percentage of ALS sufferers.Brainstorm can submit this additional data to get FDA approval which would then get insurance companies to cover Nurown.Then the stock price will really explode. ;)"
"Lower, lower and lower and Chaim stays and stays. When will the board wake up and realize they work for the shareholders. The market does not like what is happening to the company and how it’s being run."
This has been dead money for the most part since March and almost a year ago or more...Cant be alot longer something has to be brewing Gltal Park
This is brutal. Every day red?
"Here is bullet points from call:1) Raised cash at right time anticipating risk of COVID-192) Working in lockstep with FDA and FSR test can be done via phone. Injections will be done onsite.3) When asked about number of patients through trial CEO replied with ""can't give specific numbers, but math tells you the vast majority.""4) First 13 Israel patients are done and information should be announced in 1 to 2 months. Also, 13 more patients were approved for treatment, but CEO stated they are evaluating internally if achievable. Sounded optimistic.5) Exploring possible treatment for COVID-19 as they point to similar treatment advances in China using cell therapy.6) My main takeaway was the FDA is guiding study modifications, and approved FSR being done via phone. CEO stated ""The FDA understands the importance of this treatment for ALS and we are working very closely with them to make sure the study is conducted appropriately and we still intend to complete by October, as scheduled."" Overall, the CEO sounded optimistic, and one caller said ""I can almost see the twinkle in your eyes!"" I am convinced this is on track and the only thing in the way of FDA approval is time. Cheers my fellow pALS and investors!!!"
"Anecdotal reports are not especially useful in experimental medicine. Unless of course you are the subject. That is why it is very important to me that I apply some kind of objective measurement to my own physical state. It would be basically useless to say ""I have more energy since receiving nurown"". And while regulatory bodies seem to be in love with the ALS FRS r, I have always been very critical of the measurement so I have to take my five point gain with a grain of salt. A full liter increase in fvc is a very strong data point, but as I have pointed out I did have pneumonia at the low point so I accept that there could be some noise in the analysis. All of this being said, I am choosing to quantify my progress like a fitness enthusiast. In November of 2018, prior to my bone marrow aspiration, I was able to do 1.81 miles in 40 minutes resistance level 3 on the nustep recumbent elliptical trainer At the Newtown Athletic Club. In January of 2019 on the same machine under identical parameters I was able to go 2.4 miles. At my March 12th neurology appointment I was able to report that I had increased that number to 2.8 miles. Yesterday I hit 3.05 miles. Now this wouldn't mean a lot to someone doing an analysis of a patient population, nor should it. We have to respect the integrity of the scientific process. I guess the point is that it all means a hell of a lot to me. I want to see other people make their own Anecdotal evidence."
So bashers are here also now lol on a 3.27 stock..Some #$%$ on stocktwits filling the boards on a lifesaving treatment and now they think that doing here will change my position. This will go through the roof after and if the good peer review on nurown is known and Any positive feedback thereafter from the fda
Total control today .Let's see another bump at 330 to 4.50 or higher that for sure is an sign were going much much higher
no one is buying at 60 cents off of all time low....70k volume ...in control is not the words i would use to describe this stock..
"My final injection occurred yesterday, July 1st at 2 pm PT. All went fine. Press release out today saying all injections are complete. Meet Patient 200. I am officially done on September 1st, so we can expect a press release on September 2nd announcing phase III trial complete. Mark those calendars. Cheers!!"
"Pressure is being applied. Good for the patients....I’m Dying of a Disease That’s Not COVID. It Needs Urgency, Too.Brian WallachThe Daily BeastMay 5, 2020, 4:52 AM EDTGettyGettyIn the fight against COVID-19, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the biopharmaceutical industry have joined together to speed experimental drugs through the regulatory pathway. This collaboration and approval process on steroids is not normal. It is instead the result of the huge political and social pressure that this pandemic unleashed. While it may not have been normal before, it is exactly what we should be doing to prevent the next pandemic—and to save the lives of millions of Americans living with terminal illnesses.The normal regulatory process today is what I have lived as a patient with a 100 percent terminal disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), who has been waiting more than two years to get access to a single experimental drug. Normal is bureaucratic rules, regulations and red tape that tie us in knots while grinding progress to a frustrating halt. Scientists Hope Ebola Drug Can Be a COVID-19 KillerToday, there are over 430 clinical trials for COVID-19—all launched within four months—and more than 75 are already in Phase III, which is considered by FDA to be the final trial needed before a treatment can be approved. A number of these trials plan to be completed this year, meaning they will have gone from start to finish in less than eight months. One of the most well-known of these trials is Remdesivir. That trial, which began on Feb. 21, has already resulted in a grant of emergency use authorization based upon its showing, in the words of Dr. Anthony Fauci, a “significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery” for some COVID-19 patients. In other words, in just over two months we pushed through a potential treatment for COVID-19. This is amazing.For ALS, on the other hand, the shortest path from trial initiation to treatment is multiple years. One potential treatment, a stem cell therapy called NurOwn, has been stuck in trials for nearly a decade. During that time approximately 60,000 people died from ALS in the United States alone. Patients publicly beg the drug company, FDA and our elected officials for access to NurOwn daily and yet it remains unavailable, unlikely to come to market until mid-next year at best (if at all).This anemic process for developing therapies is not unique to ALS. As we move forward from this pandemic, hundreds of thousands will continue to die from glioblastoma, Alzheimer’s disease, rare genetic disorders—terminal illnesses that are not being addressed with a scintilla of the urgency we see in the fight against COVID-19. Now there is a reason for these rules and regulations that prevent us from coming up with an ALS drug on Monday and then prescribing it on Tuesday. By law, NIH is supposed to fund good, rigorous science and the FDA is mandated to only approve treatments that are safe and effective. The rush to combat COVID-19 has made clear the importance of these rules and regulations to protect the public. Without them, we risk tests that are inaccurate and unproven “cures” could become widely adopted.The fight to combat COVID-19, however, exposed the myth that the drug development, testing and approval process must be done in a slow and plodding manner over the course of multiple years while people die. COVID-19 showed us that when both the need is urgent enough and the pressure great enough, there is a different speed at which the biopharmaceutical industry and these agencies can act.NIH and FDA are filled with dedicated public servants who give their lives and careers to saving ours. Even before COVID-19, both had taken incremental steps to try to speed up drug approvals and access to experimental therapies. COVID-19 made clear, however, that tinkering with the existing system won’t solve what ails us. Instead, we need to overhaul the system by applying the lessons of COVID-19. We all deserve a system where the speed and urgency that have been seen in the fight against COVID-19 is the norm, not the exception. We all deserve the level of creativity, cooperation and urgency shown by NIH, FDA and industry in this fight. In particular, we all deserve a system that fills trials in weeks rather than years so that they move forward as rapidly as is possible. We deserve trials that have been thoughtfully designed to tell whether a drug works in the shortest amount of time possible and with the smallest possible number of trial participants. And we deserve real pathways to try safe, promising therapies now when the other option is certain death.For a window of time, the entire world has had a glimpse of what it feels like to be a patient with a terminal diagnosis like ALS—to be told there are no good tests, no good treatments and no good answers. Today the science seeking to cure ALS—and other terminal"
"Dr. Appel, at Houston Methodist, is one of the most widely respected Neuromuscular Neurologists in the United States. He also serves on the Brainstorm Science Advisory Board for NurOwn. Dr. Appel conducted a P1 clinical trial a couple of years ago, with only 3 participants, using his patented T-Regulatory Cells procedure for ALS. One of those trial participants is a member of this board and shared his experience in the trial a while back. Anyways, P1 data was outstanding and showed T-REGS was able to actually stop the progression of ALS, dead in its tracks, completely, in 3/3 patients, who received treatment. Stopping disease progression was actually seen in all three patients at two separate points in time as well. One of the three patients actually made some slight gains. There were no safety issues in P1 either. However, once the trial ended, all three participants unfortunately resumed disease progression again. The results were however unprecedented. Dr. Appel then made a couple of tweaks in his T-REG protocol and started a P2, I believe at the end of last year. That trial is currently ongoing. Tonight, I watched a 90 minute interview Dr. Appel did with Everything ALS a few weeks back.Unfortunately, for the T-REG trial, as reported by Dr Appel—due to COVID, several of their participants were not able to stay enrolled. It also appears that the tweaking of the protocol from P1 to P2, may have caused an adverse reaction in one participant, which forced the trial to be put on hold temporarily, by the FDA. The trial has since resumed. Due to the adverse reaction as well issues with the low number of trial participants, it appears, once this P2 concludes in the Spring of 2021, Dr. Appel is going to need to conduct a P2b next. So, why am I posting about the T-REGS trial(s) on the Brainstorm message board? Well, there are several reasons. I’ve been curious about this P2 trial, as the way I see it, T-REGS is/was really the only immediate competition for NurOwn, at the present time. Given the safety profile and beyond amazing efficacy in the P1, there were a lot of people in the ALS community hoping the stellar P1 efficacy and safety data would be replicated in the larger P2 and the FDA would then green light approval without any further trials. I think this could have been a real possibility had P2 replicated P1. While this would have been amazing for pALS, it likely could have been negative for Brainstorm. Why do I say this? Well, we don’t know what the NurOwn P3 data will reveal, but it’s sure likely not going to show that it stops progression for 100% of trial participants who actually got NurOwn. The NurOwn P2 only showed about a 50% responded rate. Secondly, although T-REGS is also a cell based therapy, it’s FAR FAR FAR less invasive. With T-REGS, blood is withdrawn from the patient and the T-REG cells are isolated and expanded and then later re-administered to the patient via IV. On the other hand. We know NurOwn requires a bone marrow aspiration fromthe hip and then the neuro stem cells are isolated, expanded, NGF added, and then re-administered back to the patient, via lumbar puncture. The NurOwn procedure is FAR more invasive, with more risk to the patient than the T-REG IV. Neither a bone marrow aspiration or a lumbar puncture are on many people’s bucket list because they aren’t fun and there is risk involved with both. Had Brainstorm presented their P3 data on NurOwn to the FDA at or around the same time of the T-REGS P2, I think there may have been greater risk of NurOwn not getting approved, if the NurOwn data was less efficacious than T-REGS, especially given the invasiveness of NurOwn and the simplicity of T-REGS. It would have raised the bar no doubt for NurOwn’s approval. However, sadly for pALS, it’s looking like T-REGS approval, may be a couple more years down the road, if it does end up getting approved at all. This does likely bode well for Brainstorm and NurOwn however, as they’re really now the only show in town, showing good results. If Brainstorm can show their efficacy is superior to that of both Radicava and Rilutek, for which the bar won’t be very high, we should hopefully have an FDA approval. Dr. Appel sadly joked that for most clinical trials ever conducted in the history of ALS, the placebo group often shows better results than the treated group. That’s how difficult ALS is to treat. I don’t think we’ll have this problem with NurOwn or at least I hope not. Six weeks (or less) and counting, fellow longs. Six weeks. Enjoy the rest of your weekend."
"God bless them. ""This expanded access program is an appropriate and welcome next step in following up the exciting results of the Phase 3 study; it is widely anticipated and deeply appreciated by our ALS patients,"" said Robert Brown, MD DPhil, Leo P. and Theresa M. LaChance Chair in Medical Research, and chair, department of neurology, University of Massachusetts Medical School and UMass Memorial Medical Center, and one of the Principal Investigators in the NurOwn Phase 3 study."
I noticed on Stocktwits someone posted mention of an article claiming Brainstorm issued notice regarding being a “going concern” if certain things did or didn’t happen. IMO this classic attempt at share manipulation on option expiration day trying to scare longs. If you look at the 10Q you will find some standard risk language under the heading “going concern” but you will also find the same language in the Aug 10Q in others words nothing new here....of course if things don’t go well with the trials there is increased risk...and no guarantees they can raise capital....But this is NOT NEW INFO....but imo its being used to scare longs....my guess is we will continue to see high volatility but likely grind higher to recover what was lost after the earnings call....but I’m certainly not going to get shaken out of my shares by highlighting standard risk language in a 10Q....This is standard fro “pre revenue “ biotech.....I’ll continue to add on any weakness
"Personally, in terms of Brainstorm, today was a successful day. I think we can take from today’s results that the week leading up to the new year was a sell off primarily for tax purposes. We saw a slight uptick on a down day. That would not have happened last week. Obviously BCLI has to generate more interest by getting FDA approval. That is a no brainer. Still I expect some investors, including the residents of this thread, to gather up the shards of the recent decline. Many have followed this company for years and see that there is a real product out there. Nothing is guaranteed but we have to believe that the FDA has a heart and will approve NurOwn even if it has some limits in its treatment. My goal is to invest in companies that help humanity and can make a profit. I think Brainstorm fits that niche. Enjoy the year. Hopefully we can see friends and loved ones without masks soon."

To all the day traders pump and dumpers who found this stock please leave the playing field before you lose your shirt. This is going over 20 bucks a share in a blink of an eye we don’t know when but you are trying to “time the market” when u should be buying as much as you can below 7 bucks and never looking at your holdings until FDA approval. They are going after hundreds or couple thousand bucks and not realizing this is a poor man’s millionaire maker. Buy and hold. Goodluck to the patients and great people who need this amazing technology I say a prayer for you multiple times a day. It’s not about money it’s about getting this medicine to the people.
Simply no news for a month. Time. Time
"A great article in the ALS News Today. It looks like Dr Brown, the Leo P. and Theresa M. LaChance chair in medical research, and chair of the neurology department at University of Massachusetts Medical School and UMass Memorial Medical Center is a believer and doing all he can to prove the results in the the newly diagnosted ALS patients receiving Nurown get the most benefit. It doen't sound at all like he is throwing in the towel based upon the data, in fact just the opposite. He must see something more than promising to keep pushing this forward and working to get meaningful data to get the FDA approval. https://alsnewstoday.com/news-posts/2020/12/16/nurown-may-be-given-to-early-als-patients-in-us-who-finished-phase-3-trial/"
Did BCLI ever do a statistucal break down of which sub set had better/worse reaction to Nurown? All I heard was that those that had severe progression did not do well
Clean house! Can Chaim ASAP!!
I believe this company has the goods. Wait until it gets closer to releasing data. This stock will soar. With approval it will go off the charts. We have seen this treatment allow a man that was wheelchair bound to be able to stand. A man to be able to ride his motorcycle again. A man that was having trouble walking and talking before treatment able to run around the table at an FDA meeting and able to talk with out excess saliva. Many more stories. Placebo not able to produce those kind of results. Unfortunately without nurown these patients are losing ground. I agree the prestigious hospitals that allowed the trials would not put their reputations on the line if they did not believe in this new treatment. Phase 2 produced excellent results taking this into phase 3 trials. Top notch team to take this all the way to the finish line. ALS community is begging for access to this drug as a treatment. Not a cure yet but something to treat this fatal disease. These strong and powerful PALS have done their homework. Diving into any possible treatment for this disease and they are demanding access to Nurown. They have seen the progress so many have made and they want it for themselves.They continue to push for it's approval.This will be a win win and many more people with other debilitating diseases will be included.Just a few months ago an invester pluncked down 10 million dollars at $8. Europe is on board offering low cost program to bring Nurown to market there. It just took a huge run up but still showing strentgh after profit taking.My money is still on BCLI.
"Now that they finished phase 2 of their MS trials, I hope they use their phase 3 ALS trials as a guide on the type of patients to choose from in order to get rock solid results.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brainstorm-announces-completion-dosing-nurown-120000389.html"
NurOwn is not a cure for ALS. It has slowed progression in some patients.
#nurown This is OUR TIME. LETS DO THIS.NOW
"All signs point to NurOwn being fantastically successful and applicable to not just ALS, but many other applications. Volume on the stock is extremely low, so either the addressable market, revenue, and income are already priced in, or no one really knows about the company. They either get approval and the stock sputters, or it catches people by surprise and goes to the moon?Thoughts anyone?"
"Brainstorm has hired a rare disease drug distribution expert who, they note, will be charged with getting insurance approvals of NurOwn should it be approved for ALS in 2021 along with other responsibilities. Lots of movement there these last two weeks, including putting some of their stock on the market to raise capital to get NurOwn to market. Doing that is a pretty strong indicator they don’t plan to sell NurOwn or their company to a bigger, established drug company that has the infrastructure already to bring a drug to market. They’re clearly going it on their own to maximize their founder’s and early investor’s profit because these moves do dilute future sales value of the company itself. This is a business, after all. Good to see them hire some experienced people in these roles. I mention all this because these moves do impact time to market. Best for us would be they sell out. 2nd best is that they’re staffing up and that appears to be what’s happening now. So that’s good news. I am particularly glad they have already hired to get the insurances to approve it as fast as they can."
"Insiders still hold about 18% of the company shares and Blackrock/Vanguard/JP Morgan another 11%. I understand it's easy to get demoralized by the recent performance, but the moment this turnaround will shot double digit in few days."
"Let’s look at what we know about Brainstorm and NurOwn today, that IMO, makes this an appealing stock to own:1. They now have enough money to complete P2 MS and P3 ALS trials. 2. They have only issued around 30 million common shares. 3. Insiders own about 20% of the company. 4. P2 MS and P3 ALS top-line data released this year. 5. P2 published data, 15+ P3 participants, Matt Bellini and Israel Hospital Exemption Program tells us NurOwn is more efficacious than the only two drugs currently approved for ALS. 6. The FDA INVITED BRAINSTORM to the table twice to discuss pathways to approval. The FDA invited us! IMO, that’s huge. 7. The ALS Caucus was formed and they will hopefully help to advocate to get the introduced bills passed to allow pALS access to drugs still in clinical trials. 8. pALS are knocking on all the right doors to make things happen in Washington. 9. Management is firing on all cylinders with the recent smart capital raises and are doing a great job overall. 10. NurOwn is safe."
"@Halevay—I know your a longtime shareholder. Seven days ago, @D.J. Posted his thoughts on the value of BCLI going forward and stated: “ BCLI future market cap $3B, conservatively. Assuming share offerings after good P3 results, at 30M shares outstanding the shares are $100 for a $3B market cap. More realistic is $5B to $6B future market cap ($166 to $200 share, respectively)”I appreciated his thoughts and posting his perspective on potential future valuation. Halevay, you responded by saying, “if you and others believe this, I have a bridge to sell you.” I don’t think D.J. Is too far off, especially if we get good M.S. phase 2 data later this year. You staunchly disagreed with D.J. with your “bridge” comment, but failed to provide a good counterpoint as to why. So, if your so inclined, I’d like to hear how you value the worth of BCLI in the next two years, to support your bridge comment. I think, too often, we have pumpers and pessimists on some of these board, but what makes some of these stock boards great is the sharing of ideas, thoughts, information, news, patient reports etc., remembering everyone is entitled to their own opinion, good or bad, and it’s up to each of us to do our own due diligence."
"Exactly Fmello Just because they pass that bill don't think for a second that insurance companies are going to green light 350,00 procedures. Not likely. Really just ultra rich and crowd funded patients are going to be able to afford. While it may be a good step I have yet to see language that would spark some revolution at the FDACertainly won't spark some type of normal communications with investors. At least I haven't seen this yet. Still holding my profits on sideline last 5 months. Maybe at 2.50 I'll buy a few shares"
the only reason BCLI went after MS and ALZH is to cover for ALS failure at which time Haim sold 1M shares at the very top before the crash....do yourselves a favor and dont expect much......

"The ALS Association, I AM ALS Award BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics $500,000 for ALS Biomarker StudyPR Newswire PR Newswire•June 9, 2020Research Study to Use Data and Samples from NurOwn Phase 3 Clinical TrialGreat news!"
"Bio markers can be used as “surrogate endpoints” when FDA evaluates a treatment for approval....What is biomarker qualification?Many biomarkers used today have been developed for use with a specific disease or as part of the development program for a specific drug. The Biomarker Qualification Program was established to support FDA's work with external stakeholders to develop biomarkers that aid in the drug development process. Through this program biomarker developers may request regulatory qualification of a biomarker for a particular context of use in drug development. What is the difference between biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments?Biomarkers should not be confused with clinical outcome assessments (COAs), a parameter that describes or reflects how an individual feels or functions, or how long the person lives. Although COAs are often used to determine whether or not a drug used in a clinical trial provides a treatment benefit, unlike biomarkers, COAs are measured using a report generated by a clinician, patient, non-clinician observer, or a performance-based assessment. For further information on COAs, FDA has created a COA Compendium that summarizes COA information for many different diseases and conditions.How can biomarkers be used as surrogate endpoints?A surrogate endpoint is a clinical trial endpoint used as a substitute for a direct measure of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. A surrogate endpoint does not measure the clinical benefit of primary interest in and of itself, but rather is expected to predict that clinical benefit. In general, the predictive nature of a surrogate endpoint is determined through the evaluation of epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other scientific evidence.1,3 Surrogate endpoints can be characterized by the level of clinical validation:Candidate surrogate endpointReasonably likely surrogate endpointValidated surrogate endpointCandidate surrogate endpoints are still under evaluation for their ability to predict clinical benefit, while validated surrogate endpoints are supported by a clear mechanistic rationale and clinical data providing strong evidence that an effect on the surrogate endpoint predicts a specific clinical benefit. Regarding reasonably likely surrogate endpoints, see the next section.What is the challenge of using novel biomarkers as reasonably likely surrogate endpoints in medical product development?Reasonably likely surrogate endpoints are supported by strong mechanistic and/or epidemiologic rationale, but the amount of clinical data available is not sufficient to show that they are a validated surrogate endpoint . Reasonably likely surrogate endpoints can be used to support FDA’s Accelerated Approval program, which is intended to provide patients with serious diseases more rapid access to promising therapies. In the post-marketing setting, additional data has been collected to determine if the reasonably likely surrogate endpoint, in fact, predicts the clinical benefit1,1,2This approach underscores the importance of continued evaluation in the post-market phase when products are approved based upon reasonably likely surrogate endpoints that have not been validated. It also underscores the need to rigorously evaluate and sometimes re-evaluate surrogate endpoints clinically, based on current scientific understanding.List of surrogate endpoints used for traditional and accelerated approvalSurrogate endpoints are used in clinical trials submitted to support either traditional or accelerated approval of drugs and biologics. Under Section 507 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the 21st Century Cures Act, FDA must make public a list of “surrogate endpoints which were the basis of approval or licensure (as applicable) of a drug or biological product.” FDA’s Surrogate Endpoint Table:Includes surrogate endpoints that sponsors have used as primary efficacy clinical trial endpoints for approval of new drug applications (NDAs) or biologics license applications (BLAs).Includes surrogate endpoints that the Agency anticipates could be appropriate for use as a primary efficacy clinical trial endpoint for drug or biologic approval, although they have not yet been used to support an approved NDA or licensed BLA.Is intended to provide greater clarity for drug developers, and will help facilitate discussions of potential surrogate endpoints with FDA review divisions, potentially speeding up drug and biologic development.Table of Surrogate Endpoints That Were the Basis of Drug Approval or Licensure"
"IMO, Technically speaking, 10 price point could be taken out quickly on good news and much higher highs would quickly prevail. New products= New higher highs"
Long time holders have likely been conditioned to the stock remaining in a go nowhere trading range and thus will be surprised when the breakout to the upside comes over 5 +. Listen to CEO on last call discuss liquidity needs and how he’s managed to get non dilutive funding for trials. I like that he and other insiders own lots of stock. He mentions on the call that the stock price is too low to bring in a partner but has signed nda indicating there is interest from bigger players. Look for data point and partnering as catalysts to take this name to double digits and beyond in 2020
This is our chance...Do it Brian tell the whole worlds about #nurown Brian Wallach@bsw5020·Jul 9A thread on #NurOwn:I have seen first hand a number of friends receive NurOwn in the EAP and through RTT. Seen it slow or stop their progression. As an ALS patient this makes me scream for access for all of us who are dying due to rampant systemic paternalism. /1
"Conference ending just now. Most important point to come out that wasn't in the earlier press releases is that the successful subgroup that started with a score of 35 or more is that they made up fully 30% of all the trial patients. That means there's an excellent chance that Nurown can get approved as is for what is already a large group, but more importantly, it would be the first line of defense when patients first get diagnosed, as they pretty much all have a score of over 35 at that point. I would actually buy more had I kept part on the sidelines (toyed with the idea; a shame), but I'm standing pat. Based on the data, I believe Nurown will get approved. I don't even think the FDA will limit who can get it, but I do absolutely think that insurers will only cover those with scores of 35+, and partial coverage for those over, say 25. But even if the FDA limits the approval to the higher-scoring subgroup, BCLI is worth billions."

"This new partnership follows our recently announced agreement with Catalent Pharma Solutions to manufacture NurOwn at a scale large enough to meet potential commercial needs at the time of launch. The dedicated, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility developed by RR&D will provide us with important long-term autonomy and strategic flexibility, including the capacity to supply NurOwn for additional disease indications beyond ALS. Together these two partnerships will help ensure that BrainStorm has the manufacturing capacity to meet the needs of patients today and well into the future.""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rapid-reshore-development-brainstorm-cell-100000723.html"
"When are the Chaim-Sycophants going to look at the lack of leadership out of the C-Suite, the lack of ANY direction out of the same, the lack of ANY price appreciation and the keen ennui around this company going to wake up and realize the changes must be made, starting with the CEO???"
"https://youtu.be/XgAK6mtLjN0?t=319If somebody has a terminal disease and there is a 35% chance of a cure, with no side effects, why would you vote against it? Plus, once treatment starts, you could find out why only 35% have positive reactions. But you won't make progress without trying."
There is a￼ saying about (Low to High) we choose the word are someone will choose for you. Put your “best” foot forward.
"Coronavirus has created abuying opportunity! My 1stinjection is done and zeroside effects. NurOwn has tobe approved! Placebo or not,I can speak to the procedure.If you can handle a blooddraw then the pain is not aproblem. Lumbar puncturewas easy, and candidly, theblood draw hurt worse whenshe missed the vein. On theother hand, I take Riluzole and my mouth goes numb if it begins to dissolve before swallowing. I share this comparison because nobody really knows the longterm side effects of Riluzole, yet we know it does very little to slow progression. NurOwn, if FDA approved, could be a bone marrow aspiration followed by a simple outpatient procedure to perform the lumbar puncture. Today, the cost is high to prove it works. Just yesterday, I had five viles of blood drawn, a urine sample, then an EKG. I was then admitted for a mandatory 24 hour hospital stay. They performed the lumbar puncture, took spinal fluid to test, then injected NurOwn or Placebo. I had to lie flat for 6 hours and they checked vitals every few hours. Sleep, wakeup, then urinalysis at 10 am along with another blood draw with five viles of blood. Finally, I am released nearly 36 hours after arrival. I share all this to make two points. First, the Brainstorm study is very extensive and they are performing a very detailed analysis. Second, upon FDA approval, the time and cost to treat a patient will be significantly reduced! I could envision this becoming an outpatient procedure w/o a hospital admission. As a point of reference, Brainstorm briefly offered treatment under Right to Try for $300k. Given the extensive efficiency gains, I see treatment costs being reduced below $100k annually. Comparatively, Radicava is estimated to cost $150k annually. Radicava claims to extend life 15%. NurOwn is halting progress, or in some cases reversing symptoms. Now, ask yourself, why would the FDA not approve NurOwn? Simple answer is they have to approve it! I will keep doing my part by serving fellow pALS by volunteering my time and my body. I would ask all of you to take action and join the movement to get NurOwn approved! Join Brian Wallach with IamALS, or Mike Henson with No More Excuses, aka ALS News on YouTube. Both gentlemen are aggressively advocating for NurOwn, so let's turn up the volume, together, to a deafening pitch! Cheers to all of you! I will keep sharing my thoughts and experience in the coming months."

"Interesting buying worth thinking about as the mkt prepares to open on Monday.On Friday July 30th BCLI Volume rose dramatically in the last 30 minutesand closed at 4.03 on 550,000 shares mostly in the last 30 minutes.I excitedly awaited Monday's opening but instead my dreams went to naughtand the stock went nowhere most of the week. Then...................early on Friday the 6th, BCLI traded about 450,000 shares in about an hour.rising to 4.21 and fell back to mediocrity from 4.21 to a closing price of 3.96on 664,500 shares.So what this means is (or is not) significant. But it would seem that there was vigorous interest at the end of the week.Sleep well.................one never knows!"
Total control. I'll keep buying
"We had a 66% increase in call option during Q2. The put/call ratio moved from 1.08 in Q1 to 0.63 in Q2. Total call option from 669k to 1.1M, Put from 724k to 698k. I'm no expert in option trade but this looks promising or at least show an improved sentiment around this company."
I think we are all just worn out waiting. So many things to wait for. Ph3 als next steps. Ph2 mls final results. Israel hospital exemption. Exosomes and ards next steps. Partnerships in ms. No partner needed in als.
Just reading the testimonials on #nurown on Twitter. I sincerely hope these people who took it are heard and how this has helped them and can be benefit millions of more sufferers with als. Park
Who believes the #nurown patients will be heard in Congress tomorrow and it will be actually shown or covered live?
2 more days.Its boom or bust.Gl everyone
"To be a bit more clear, the FDA specifically asked for biomarkers as a prerequisite for approval. Now that the biomarkers are peer reviewed by the most respected and authoritative professional journal in the neuralgic community, when phase 3 biomarkers on multi-dose show improved efficacy beyond what was already peer reviewed by phase 2 - barring any catastrophic negative side effects (which are extremely unlikely since you're using your own stem cells) FDA approval is almost certain. If those biomarkers are also functionally determinant in other diseases like MS, Parkinsons, etc. then the NurOwn platform will change the healthcare landscape drastically. Add to this, mass production via closed loop bioreactors rather than cleanrooms and this is no longer a small startup, it is on its way to being a healthcare giant."
"I think we are due for MS phase2 final results soon, the trial completion date was yesterday, although we received good news on the trial in march, still looking forward to the end results."
When is the peer revue being published guys...we need something major here
"You should have made time to stream in. Several posted links to livestream on other sites.It was informative. Stock price is probably dropping due to no new earthshattering news and upward momentum going into the presentation. But there's a limit to the downside because the data has several upside possibilities. With such a small phase 3 group, the statistically significant requirement was not difficult to skew to the downside. They kept saying ""more to come"" and that they're still evaluating data; but the biomarkers were very encouraging by any measure. Seems like they chose a poor metric to be evaluated by, based the Q & A afterwards. They're also seemingly stuck coming up with a new way to weight the imbalance of patients on NurOwn who'd progressed with ALS (sicker) well beyond those in the placebo group. Data seems to indicate the earlier it's administered, the greater the impact treatment has - not reversing the neurological degermation, but slowing it well beyond what's currently available. But still, nothing new at the symposum from Brainstorm. Maybe there is nothing new and they're just trying to pretend there could be by avoiding the topic. Maybe there is and they cannot divulge for an unknown reason. I sort of think it's the first; but not to any great degree. Yes, there's clearly a pathway to approval. NurOwn just isn't reversing the disease as much as some had hoped. But something happened at the cellular level - that's unquestionable."
"A million dlls question. After the collapses we have had and the recent collapses of SAVA and ANVS, If you break even Would you sell or hold? Do you see any future on BCLI? I still think BCLI has no leadership and Chaim is a problem rather than a solution. I want to here your comments, and not from the new stockholders, but the one's that were here before the stock collapsed. Advise would be appreciated."
Stock is being bought up at even the smallest dip. With this volume the trend continues to be up. Way more exposure now and people and institutions are seeing the value here both short and long term. We will see $20 way before the end of the year. PALS needing this treatment so I hope they figure out a way to speed up the process.
"Nurown isn't just a drug for ALS it's a process. Using a patients bone marrow. It's a patented process in multiple countries. For this tool that claims Nurown is dead is simply uneducated. Look what Dr. Kern said in Feb""I have to say that our ALS phase III data demonstrates a clinically meaningful slowing of ALS disease progression and our biomarker analyses suggest that targeting multiple ALS pathways is essentially required to achieve this important clinical outcome. As an ALS neurologist, I truly believe we're at a point where NurOwn can benefit ALS patients, and will continue to learn from our trial to advance the science of ALS.""Dump your stock. Don't blame you. I will pick it up for you. My position is at 4.25 I can dollar cost that if you can drive it to 2 dollars. Look all speculation is speculation. Just we disagree because you see a swing and a miss and I see a company that just took ball 2. FDA wants more data. But independent doctors agree there is results that matter. So if you bought at 5 or bought at six. Close your browser. Give it a year. That's how investing worksI have had 10 50% gainers in a row. 4 100% gainers in a row. Really only lost 2k on silver. But good investments take time to realize. Maybe this chat place is the worst place to make an informed decisionI only think it's worth supporting at this price because these people need help and I believe personally they are on to the right concept to extend and possible improve lives. No thanks to the FDA. But ultimately BCLI will prevail. And good MS data will only strengthen Nurown traction"
"The recent wonderful responses to people like Matt Bellina and Thurman Maynardare exceptional and congratulations to them.Much has been said about the FDA and all the work of the BCLI team like Chaim, RalphKern and others.In short time all of these trials will have been completed and it would be helpful if others like Matt andThurman came forward and told their stories.It might help move the football down the field and accelerate the process of changing ALSlives for the better."

"I am wondering just what is going on with catalent? If you look at requirements within a bla about 50% deal with manufacturing the biologic .And as of right now we don’t know the status of catalent ‘s ability to manufacture or if they will , Chaim throwing a bone about Israeli manufacturing is nothing more than a pump piece, similar to the catalent announcement prior to bad news."
Didn’t listen. What did I miss?
"Here's my assessment on the situation, please correct and improve as required:1. BCLI has enough cash to get through phase 3 without dilution. 2. NurOwn is not a cure, but it improves the quality of life drastically for at least 33% of patients, and significantly for most pALS. I don't know of any pALS that have reported no gains. 3. It helps with the symptoms, but does not cure the underlying disease. 4. It will be lifetime, continuous treatment, because the effects wear off over time if treatment stops. 5. For most patients, especially early in the disease, it is in the insurance company's financial interest to pay for treatment. 6. We have no idea how it works in the last stage of the disease. 7. We have no idea how much life expectancy it adds and quality of life expectancy. 8. There doesn't appear to be another treatment close to approval that works better for ALS. 9. As for the stock, effectiveness against MS is far more important, since the number of patients is so much greater. 10. My guess is the stock will spike 3x on FDA approval and then short sellers will begin to mess with us. 11. If the MS P2 results are extremely positive 5x to 10x and the short sellers will really begin to mess with us."
"I found the speech by Dr. Sharpless very hopeful. He didn't have to mention ALS, stem cells, regenerative medicine, or ALS advocates at all. Obviously, those issues are on his mind. He's leaving the position soon and he gave attention to ALS because progress is being made and he wants it to continue. The biomarkers in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases aren't as clear as in cancer (like tumor size). But BCLI introduced a new biomarker last week from the phase 2 trial. The data from NurOwn's phase 2 trial (single dose) were better than anything ever produced by Radicava. He mentioned 5 expedited pathways to access and said that once a drug gets accelerated approval, if it proves ineffective it gets taken off the market. I interpreted Dr. Sharpless' remarks as very constructive and now I consider him and Dr. Woodcock allies in the approval process of NurOwn."
"Until details of an FDA regulatory pathway in ALS emerge, the stock will remain range-bound. Buying from those making tax loss sales could prove smart, in time. An approval would clearly lead to a huge rally."
"Part 1 From Mike Henson on FB 45 minutes ago: UPDATE (WEDS):Yes, MUCH is happening behind the scenes. Today, the CEO of BCLI called to give us an update and to say ""thank you"" for being in the trial, and to inform me that the company will be meeting with patients in the trial soon AND that it will be meeting with the FDA after that. He also thanked patients for their support and wants everybody to know they are seeking a WAY FORWARD. Cool. That conversation DID NOT INCLUDE any of the following, which are OUR thoughts and feelings only. I do not speak for the company in any manner: Over the next few weeks, we will be analyzing the data from the trial as more arrives and we plan to thoroughly contrast the NurOwn trial to other well known ALS drug trials for you, as we announce our ""NurOwn advocacy and education"" strategy to assist in any manner with moving forward with NurOwn at the FDA. Note*: To those in ALS who were even a tiny bit ""happy"" about yesterday's results, and thought this was ""over"" for NurOwn.....wrong. In fact, having some REAL data that shows as good of an efficacy signal for ALS as basically anything in trials thus far (and showed HOW Nurown works) is the beginning of pALS' fight to get the FDA to approve a 10 year old, perfectly SAFE drug that is roughly 36% EFFECTIVE for our terrible disease, and one which clearly appears to have a ""knockout"" effect in some who are early in the disease. We say to HELL with the ALS defeatists and naysayers who are happy to sit back and applaud (and fund) marginal new drugs that either barely show a treatment effect, let alone some that offer ALS patients a chance to HALT their disease's progression! We cannot allow those types of negative people to dominate our future health at this time. ALS is not ""theirs"" anymore, stuck in a repeating cycle of failure in which dying patients are asked to sit quietly, hand over their wallets, and just wait on them to do as they please; while we die waiting to TRY.WE ARE THE CUSTOMERS IN ALS! WE DEMAND BETTER, OR FUNDING AND PERSONNEL CHANGES MUST HAPPEN!Fact: NurOwn worked for about 35% of those in the trial, and the biomarker data appears to be solid and could finally prove WHY and HOW it works, as it confirms much about neuroinflammation and neurofilament, etc., which is brand new ""mojo"" for ALS. And we don't even know what else may be in there yet.Fact: NurOwn is NOT a ""failure"" (except for significance over a ""rogue"" placebo group). But remember, P-VALUE and ALSFRS-R has been the usual FDA measure for ALS, as we've never had biomarkers and/or so much anecdotal evidence of efficacy before. NOW WE DO. ***BTW, Radicava essentially produced the SAME RESULT as Nurown, with vastly different placebo data (and NO biomarker). Nobody seems concerned about that, and it's FDA APPROVED. And thanks to iamALS and so much advocacy, last year the FDA agreed to consider ""totality of the evidence"" for NurOwn- a fact now being totally ""missed"" by the ""experts"" in ALS.YES, there are ways to go forward with good biomarker data for the FDA. It happens in cancer (and other dieaseas) with biomarker data via ""Accererated Approval"". And, NurOwn showed a good effect for those earlier in the disease as well (FRS-R of 35), so there IS a significant subgroup to build approval on, too. GAME ON! Last, as many of you might have heard, there was an oddly ""robust"" nature with the placebo group. We need an answer for this, and I think we'll get it. I've compared them myself and it's strange. After all this, pALS should all say it loud and proud: NUROWN WORKS, AND WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO LOSE EVERY SINGLE EFFECTIVE NEW ALS DRUG THAT ""ONLY"" WORKS IN 35% of pALS because it's ""not perfect"", or whatever. NONE of the drugs for ALS that are already approved (or being suggested) are perfect. There is no such thing for ALS, which is itself likely one of several complex diseases.The NurOwn results implied that all future ALS PATIENTS could perhaps have a 1 in 3 chance of a result, including potentially a ""home run"" result that may HALT PROGRESSION for those early in the disease. HOW CAN THAT NOT BE ""GOOD ENOUGH?"" Answer: IT IS! As soon as we can, we plan to issue a detailed analysis of NurOwn's Phase 3 trial, INCLUDING discussing options for a path forward, and formally calling for the resignation of at least one key player in OUR ALS world for severe DEFEATISM and failing to provide ALS with a workable direction forward and failure to support the most obvious and promising new ALS therapies over ""company"" and personal peliefs. But for now, we need some patience and TIME to do so. At NME, we will remain convinced (until we see otherwise) that BCLI can find a way forward with NurOwn to get FDA APPROVAL- at least on a limited basis, and it intends to talk to patients from the trial soon to discuss their concerns."
Until Congress passes the ALS law brainstorm will be quite. Once they pass it we are on business. Being quiet with a big stick is frustrating for stockholders but their strategy has a good chance of working. Once Congress changes the FDA law regarding not ignoring phase 3 trial subset successes Brainstorm will file its application and more than likely get approved.
"guys, it's working, just wait and see"
"BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:BCLI) has completed a Phase 3 clinical trial for NurOwn as a treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in November 2020 announced topline results showing that the trial did not reach statistical significance for the primary endpoint, a responder analysis examining the percentage of participants that experienced a 1.25 point per month improvement in the post-treatment Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale – Revised (ALSFRS-R) slope. However, an analysis of a pre-specified subgroup of patients with ALSFRS-R scores ≥ 35, of which approximately 30% of trial participants were included, showed a clinically meaningful treatment response with NurOwn with 34.6% of responders compared to 15.6% of responders in placebo-treated participants (P=0.288)."

Chaim’s leadership is all smoke and mirrors. One can only hope the board wakes up before it’s too late.
"Peer review will come, and hopefully it will be a home run. The proof will be in the pudding and FDA will have no choice to approve Nurown for BLA or AA. It works on 35% of pALS does not make sense not to approve."
How is Matt? Does someone know?
"Maxim analyst Jason McCarthy raised the firm's price target on BrainStorm to $20 from $9 after factoring in indications in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, while keeping a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst notes that BrainStorm held a Key Opinion Leader Webinar to discuss expansion of NurOwn cell therapy to Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the company has an ongoing phase 2 trial of NurOwn in and the pivotal phase 3 trial of NurOwn in ALS has completed dosing, he highlights. McCarthy believes the potential of NurOwn cell therapy continues to grow given its unique approach to driving increased neuronal growth factors in the CNS.Read more at:https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3122345"

"Merit Cudkowicz, M.D. (Nurown Ph3 trial PI) and Brian Wallach (I am ALS) to participate in the Congressional hearing. Below is an excerpt. He argues for approval of subset results being approved. He mentions Brainstorm as an example of approving the subset. Congress will direct the FDA to approve ALS treatment with good subset results and provisional treatments. When the legislation passes Brainstorm will be approved. With close to 300 congressional leaders sponsoring the legislation it will pass easy.We have heard reports from people in the NurOWN trial and expanded access program of improvements in function. This is not something we typically see or hear in ALS. There were important changes in important biomarkers in the phase 3 trial and better responses in people who started treatment in an earlier stage of the disease. The manuscript with full results is currently under review. Continued dialogue with the FDA on how to identify subsets of responders is critical as it is very likely that this treatment and many future treatments will work better in one group of people than another."

"HR 7071 has been introduced.

GRANTS FOR RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF THERAPIES FOR ALS AND OTHER RAPIDLY PROGRESSING NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES.(a) In General.—The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall award grants to eligible entities for the provision of investigational drugs through an expanded access program pursuant to section 561 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360bbb) for individuals for the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, or cure of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or another rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease."
"BCLI will be at $100/share next year. Phase III trial finishes in Oct 2020. The procedure is relatively simple and far more effective than Radicava, the only recently approved ALS treatment. Radicava runs $150k annually and is mildly effective. Down side is you get Radicava every two weeks, whereas NurOwn injection is done every 8 weeks. Do the math. BCLI likely earns $100k annually per patient. With 30k PALS that creates $3 Billion in sales. How do I know all this you ask? I just finished the bone marrow aspiration this week and am part of the phase III trial. I live with ALS and uprooted my family to move to SoCal and take part in the trial. If FDA approved in 2021 this stock is easily $100/share. I am proud to invest and hopeful it gives me more great years ahead! Matt Bellina is the best example and he is now walking because of NurOwn. I plan to do the same! Cheers!!"
"I am dissapointed that the CEO , Mr. Chaim Lebowitz did not bother himself to face his shareholders todayin the news release , the company gave the impression that they were gearing up signing on companies to increase the manufacture of Nurown and the hiring of many ececutives and Board members salaries with stock options before the clinical trial dumped this devastating news causing myself and countless othersfantastic losses and dashing the hope for patients suffering from ALS ."

"An article posted yesterday in my local paper - San Jose Mercury News - ""Bay Area woman lobbying for passage of ALS bill Jamie Berry of San Jose was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease in July; bill would accelerate development and approval of treatments. One of the most promising is NurOwn, a treatment developed by New York-based BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics. The treatment relies on stem cells — cells that haven’t yet become specialized in function. The cells are collected from an ALS patient’s bone marrow and cultured in a lab to produce high levels of chemicals that help nerve cells stay healthy. The cells are then injected into the patient’s spinal canal."""
Anyone want to guess where were trading at 6 months out?This has been basically flatlined since March. We need something major here...quickly
Good news from the bird! He said to watch for number 26 could mean peer review on 26th of this month! Also said don’t pay attention to MM bringing this down into the low 3s one more time

"it is really simple. imagine you are one of the 5000 people that are diagnosed each year with ALS.you hear about a drug that is effective for 35% vs 15% placebo (subgroup results of newly diagnosed in the bcli trail ) and your only other alternative is radicava with 8% improvement...would you fight the get that drug? well FDA will have two choices: 1.understand that it works and approve immediately 2.send BCLI to do an additional phase 3 trial comprised only from the subgroup can take another year... in any case, it will be approved but the difference is how many people will die waiting.to buy in at 4$ is a gift which will be recognized very soon...see smart money will start accumulating soon when all the panicked private investor are out. GL"
what you will if it gaps up to 20$?
Very frustrating to watch the treading water for over 6 months..but the payback will be worth it.
BCLI files for $200mm shelf offering. Need to have the funds available to pay Chaim’s 2022 (and beyond) massively bloated salary.
What is going on ? Somebody has a clue
"Another Israeli based company (Kadimastem) just released interim data today for their P1/P2 study using AstroRx (stem cells) for ALS. Six month post-treatment follow-up data will be released in Q4. Note there were no safety issues and their data was very similar to the NurOwn P2 data, further supporting the safety and efficacy of stem cells as an effective ALS treatment. Fortunately, Brainstorm is years ahead of Kadimastem in the development of stem cell therapy for ALS. See below for parts of the actual release: NESS ZIONA, Israel, August 03, 2020 --- Kadimastem Ltd. (TASE: KDST), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing cell therapies for the treatment of severe debilitating diseases, announced today that its lead product, AstroRx, showed a positive efficacy signal and a good safety profile in Cohort B of the Company’s Phase 1/2a clinical trial in ALS. Secondary Objective: Efficacy To identify decline in disease progression following treatment, ALSFRS-R slope analysis was performed and compared between the pre- and post-treatment periods. The starting point for the slope of the post-treatment period was referred to in the slope analysis in two ways: at first visit after treatment (Day 30, as previously published for Cohort A) and before treatment administration (Day -1). Both analyses were conducted. The rate of ALS disease progression in Cohort B patients, as assessed by the ALSFRS-R slope difference between pre-treatment and post-treatment (from Day -1) periods, was significantly reduced from -1.43/month during the 3-4 month run-in period before treatment to -0.78/month during 3-month follow-up after treatment, reflecting a clinically meaningful signal and statistically significant (p=0.0023) decline of 45% in disease progression rate. The rate of ALS disease progression in Cohort B patients, as assessed by the ALSFRS-R slope difference between pre-treatment and post-treatment (from Day 30) periods, was significantly reduced from -1.42/month in the pre-treatment period to -0.41/month in the post-treatment period (p=0.0006), reflecting a decline of 71% in disease progression rate. Pooling the data of the two Cohorts treated with AstroRx (n=10, from Day -1) exhibited an even more robust and clinically meaningful effect:The ALSFRS-R slope was significantly reduced from -1.15/month in the pre-treatment period to a rate of -0.54/month post-treatment (p=0.0004). These results reflect a decline of 53% in disease progression rate.Responder analysis, as assessed by the improvement of at least 25% in the ALSFRS-R rate of decline between pre-treatment and post-treatment periods, demonstrated that 70% of Cohort A & B patients treated with AstroRx were identified as responders."
WAKE UP PEOPLE cfo gone ...no news for a year ...no peer review yet ...nothing from chaim...its a loss ..
"from FBand the final patient for the phase 3 trial, #200, received their final dose of BrainStorm’s NurOwn today. 12 more weeks and it will be a wrap. Many of us anxiously await the results of this promising therapy. I’ve been waiting on these since December 2015, before Mike’s official diagnosis and admittance into the phase 2 trial at the Mayo. Mike was #7 of 16 at this location out of 48 total in the US. Thank to all who have given so much to participate in the phase 2 & phase 3 trials "

Post from Matt Bellina: Got my 7th Nurown infusion yesterday! I have been in so many hospitals and clinics that I have lost count. I can say with absolute confidence that no other location has made me feel as safe and well cared for as my VA in Philadelphia. Thank you to Chaim and Brainstorm for providing the treatment. Thanks to my parents and Maria for watching the boys. Thank God for Caitlin for making it all possible and being my reason to keep showing up!
"BrainStorm Expands Clinical Pipeline to Evaluate NurOwn for the Treatment of Alzheimer's DiseaseNEW YORK, June 24, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: BCLI), a leading developer of adult stem cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, today announced a new clinical program focused on the development of NurOwn as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. As part of the newly announced program, the Company is planning a multi-national Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NurOwn treatment in patients with prodromal to mild Alzheimer's disease.Every day is a great News Day:-)"
"I’ve been a long-term shareholder of BCLI for over 8 long years. My original purchase was after my father passed away from complications of ALS. I wanted to believe in the science and the company then and feel even more positive now that an effective treatment will be forthcoming and approved by the FDA (despite their incompetency and willful negligence). I have been as patient as possible knowing that I have the luxury of not having a terminal disease with no viable treatment options. That being said, I am mad as hell that pals have not had the opportunity to participate in this ground breaking treatment. At this point, it is unconscionable that participants in the study are still receiving the placebo when we have heard from several dozen participants that this treatment is working for them. I stopped reading bcli message boards years ago as many posters are ignorant and have their own agenda related to their short-term profits. I made the mistake of looking at them again. I am ignoring the meaningless short-term ebbs and flows of stock price. Instead, I am focused on the long-term success of Nurown for pals. Financial success for bcli and shareholders will follow. While it is reasonable to play “Monday morning quarterback” with company moves, several posters need reminders that we are much closer to the finish line now than we’ve ever been. Additionally, there will be more indications moving forward that will continue to drive this company and the stock price and most importantly help people. With all of the positive progress and potential of bcli, I am confused to the negativity and contentiousness of several posters. Everyone needs to do what works best for them (there is no wrong or right), but the constant back and forth is unhealthy, counterproductive, and, at times, immature. Perhaps all of us need a reminder that pals are dying daily. Approval of Nurown will be too late more many, including my father, but I’m pretty sure they would all want us to treat each other with respect and not lose sight of what pals and bcli are fighting for."

I just read that actress Christina Applegate (Age 49) was recently diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. I wonder where Brainstorm is at with their phase 3 MS clinical trials? Maybe Applegate could get into the trial since she lives in California.
"As of December 31st 50% of the shares where hold by Institutions or Insiders. As of yesterday insiders still hold the same amount of shares (~20%) they had at the end of December as well at the end of September. This tells you that they believe in their product and in the company potential. ALS trial was partially disappointing and FDA feedbacks probably even more. But again, that was not the end, we have the MS trial results coming out soon and more in the background. It has been a painful journey, and what I'm more sad about is the ALS patients which are desperately waiting for this drug. But I'm sure patience will be rewarded. Stay strong."

where is park !!! i miss his daily posts on why whatever happening is good news and how this will be 30$ any day
Why does it feel like BCLI has folded their tent and rode into the sunset.I can't recall the last time the company had anything to say of anysubstantive nature.Seems strange and with daily volume low enough to indicate the investing crowdis on a hiatus little wonder that we are drifting to a price at $3 and perhaps less.Come on BCLI! Surely there has to be something worth sharing.Sad! Too good a company with so much potential. HELP!!!
This should be over 25 per share.Soon will be. BCLI will be approved bc it’s the right thing to do.
when news will be out we will see it 90% down.
"The more I look into this company and what they are trying to accomplish, the more I'm proud to be an investor and to support them. ALS is a terrible disease and their product NurOwn probably is not the cure but it definitely prolongs and give a better life to ALS patients. I spent last evening watching videos on this channel (https://www.youtube.com/c/ALSNewsNow/videos), and checking news on (https://twitter.com/als_now). They deserve more attention and I really hope they and we can have this product approved by FDA soon. This is really not all about stock price, there are PEOPLE that see in this product the only alternative to the END of their LIFE. We are getting closer, let's hope for the best for everyone. Thanks Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Inc.!"
"From ALS News Now on Twitter:""Radicava works in just EIGHT percent of all pALS. All Japanese, and it failed p-value EVERY time except one; but it got FDA APPROVAL. NurOwn however, works for 36% of those with an FVC>35, which ALL pALS do at some point. Is some form of FDA approval imminent? It BETTER BE""I think we are concentrating too much on the stock price and not enough on the context. 1. NurOwn has by far (400+%) better results than the previously approved treatment. 2. We have multiple people who had near miraculous results from taking NurOwn. 3. It works best for people with the least damage (as expected). 4. The placebo effect, given the amount of hope invested in NurOwn, is not completely unexpected - nor unwarranted. 5. We learned a lot about which biomarkers to target. 6. NurOwn is a bridge of hope and opportunity until an even better treatment is developed, perhaps a gene therapy or synthetic DNA treatment."
"Must read: Summary of FDA Guidance On ALS....fda.gov/media/130964/download “Given the typically rapid progression of disease in ALS patients (recognizing considerable heterogeneity in the course of individual patients), it is feasible and most efficient to establish a clinical benefit based on clinical endpoints capable of supporting full approval, even if the benefit is modest. In general, that benefit can be established in trials of practicable size and duration (i.e., 6 to 12 months)”"

"ALS is a train speeding towards a cliff.If some people can slow that train down, even slightly, then they may be around to see a cure someday.If you can *stop* the train... it should be murder to deprive anyone of that chance.Today I saw video evidence of that train *backing up*!!Fingers that haven't moved in a year moving again!(The pALS will share that video if they choose to, it's not my call). This must be made available to everyone!"

BrainStorm Announces Completion of All Dosing in NurOwn Phase 3 Clinical Trial in ALS.
"As of this evening, HR7071 has 57 Congressmen/Women co-sponsoring the bill, which is amazing. The goal is to get to about 125 co-sponsors, but the movement is really picking up steam. The bill has bipartisan support. I really encourage all investors here to call, email, tweet the representative for your congressional district and encourage them to co-sponsor HR7071. Emphasizing that our military combat veterans are three times more likely to get ALS and it is a service related disease, can be helpful as well. Let our voices be heard. If HR 7071 passed, NurOwn could be in the bodies of pALS as soon as January 1st, regardless of whether or not the FDA has approved Brainstorm’s NDA. It will also fully fund NurOwn and other promising therapies before they are FDA approved. PALS deserve a break, let’s all help them and give them a fighting chance. PALS deserve access to NurOwn and other promising therapies NOW!"
This has literally traded 3 I shares for the past 3 hrs?
"I only read the text of the announcement from yesterday just now. It's actually really huge, for 2 reasons. 1st, the FDA is, to a fault, very concerned about clinical trials proving mechanism of action. So this is going to document that. But there's also issue number 2, which is that the announcement basically comes right out and says they are clearly seeing good results in terms of clinical outcomes and improvement in mobility. So, despite the recent drop in stock price, I am very hopeful for not only a quick recovery, but new highs possibly around the time of the presentation in that 2nd week of September."
Look at the volume?Pitiful...something major is brewing
"ConclusionThe initiation of the Phase 2 trial in MS is an important milestone for BrainStorm as it signifies NurOwn as a platform technology that is applicable to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, we continue to be baffled by the company’s sub-$100 million valuation, which we do not believe accurately reflects the potential for NurOwn. Not only is BrainStorm undervalued based on the fact it is in Phase 3 testing with a product with a solid safety and efficacy record targeting a potential billion-dollar market, but on a comparative basis as well. We feel that an interesting valuation comparison can be made with Marker Therapeutics (MRKR), which uses autologous, non-engineered T cells to treat cancer. We believe this is similar to NurOwn in that it uses the patient’s own cells with no genetic modification. Marker is currently in Phase 2 testing for its cell therapy product and has a valuation of $250 million, or approximately 3x BrainStorm’s current valuation. BrainStorm has all the pieces in place to be successful, including a world-class management team, sufficient capital to complete the Phase 3 ALS study, and a data readout next year for an additional indication for NurOwn. We estimate that if successful NurOwn could attain peak sales of $500 million in MS alone, while in ALS we believe sales of $1 billion are possible. Our valuation for BrainStorm is currently $17."
Early Access Program (EAP) is still pending selection. Each site is given 2 slots with 12 in total. I'm told every participant is eligible regardless of FRS score. Unfortunately they are not unblinding the data until completion of EAP so I cannot confirm I got NurOwn. I'm nearly certain I did. That's the latest based on my conversation yesterday with Dr. Burford at Cedars-Sinai.
Total control...we need major news...and soon to burn this manipulation
good results.we go up
This will soon get the recognition it deserves. Let's do this. Park
PEER REVIEW COMING TO A TOWN NEAR YOU SOON.......LIKE 2 YEARS ..OR 5 YEARS...OR NEXT DECADE
"I reviewed the last CC again and added some shares afterward. All the points in my last post hold with the addition that BCLI is expecting more grant $$ and that BCLI has signed NDAs with potential partners. A drawback continues to be a lack of clear expectations as to expenses, revenues and potential cash raise. We are now perhaps within 9 mos of Q4/2020 of ALS phase 3 readout. Nurown Phase 2 results and patient efficacy feedback from their Israeli Hospital Exemption program both provide positive evidence of efficacy so I think it's at least a better than even shot at succeeding phase 3. Their phase 2 showed stat sig improvement for rapid progressors which is the target population for their larger phase 3. I tend now to think of BCLI in terms of Dendreon's Provenge. Both use analogous personalized autologous tissue processes. And given Provenge's very restrictive FDA label for prostate cancer(advanced stage, failed multiple therapies etc), I think the potential markets for each are comparable. Dendreon was bought in bankruptcy for about $500 million in 2015, and again for $868 milling in 2017. Last year Provenge had sales of $330 million. At about $100,000/treatment, this would be 3,300 patients which is I think is easily doable if Nurown succeeds. With this superficial comparison I am looking at $84 million downside and $800 million upside or a share price of $40 NOT including future dilution with a better than 50/50 chance of success. As for a cash raise which is inevitable, BCLI has the ATM/dilution, partnerships that they have already signed NDAs for, and of course grant $$ which they seem to keep finding. Maybe other options too."
That ALS bill is nearly at its goal of 300 co-sponsors. They just need eight more.
"For those of us eagerly awaiting the results of the ALS trial by late NovemberI believe we can rest more easily given the confirmation provided today.Think about it: Why else would BCLI be utilizing the prestigious hire of a pharmaceuticalVeteran, Anthony Waclawski as Executive VP Global head of Regulatory Affairs?Seems obvious that NuRown is going to be a home run!was"
Look at the volume and the pps...u can see the control by mms.this is manipulation at its finest...this should be at least 8$ by now.When the peer review comes and then the fda this will be 30$+

"IMO, Chaim, Kern, and company were understandably disappointed on the conference call that they did not get the homerun they had hoped for. 2 points: first, as has been discussed here, the results were actually quite good for a subset of patients and we should not let the perfect become the enemy of the good. Second. while management could have provided a more optimistic message, that is not the role for scientists... that is something for investors to suss out. The unstated thought here is that trial participants who received the placebo were ""abnormally"" inclined to report perceived benefits versus the theoretical benchmark. While this is an understandably human response, the truth is nobody wants to blame a desperate cadre for having too much hope. It illustrates the tragedy of what is at stake and why scientists need to incorporate these findings in pursuit of this and other breakthrough therapies."
"NEW YORK, Oct. 11, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: BCLI), a leading developer of adult stem cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, announced today that it has fully enrolled the 200-patient Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating repeat intrathecal administration of NurOwn Cellular Therapeutic (autologous MSC-NTF cells) in ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). BrainStorm’s Phase 3 clinical trial is being conducted at the University of California, Irvine; Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; California Pacific Medical Center; Massachusetts General Hospital; University of Massachusetts Medical School; and the Mayo Clinic.“The BrainStorm team is very excited to reach this important milestone in the development and potential commercialization of NurOwn in ALS. We have been fully dedicated to this journey since we began clinical trial enrollment in October 2017. To date, a significant percentage of the 200 enrolled patients have received three treatments and we expect that all trial participants will complete planned study visits and assessments by October 2020.” commented Chaim Lebovits, President and CEO of BrainStorm.“Having reached this turning point in our Company’s history, I would like to publicly acknowledge the professionalism and commitment of the clinical investigators, but, most of all, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the many patients and their families, who by participating in this trial have confirmed their belief in the potential of NurOwn. The entire BrainStorm team is grateful for your contribution in advancing the development of NurOwn and our understanding of ALS.”Maria Millan, MD, President and CEO of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) said, “CIRM’s mission is to accelerate stem cell treatments to patients with unmet medical needs. ALS is a debilitating and fatal neurodegenerative condition for which there is no effective treatment. Based on BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics’ scientific and early phase clinical trial data, CIRM awarded them $15.9 million to advance their investigational therapy NurOwn into a Phase 3 trial. Our support helped bring this program to three leading California medical centers. We congratulate Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics in completing enrollment, an important milestone toward developing a much-needed treatment for ALS.”Ralph Kern, MD, MHSc, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Medical Officer of BrainStorm stated, “We are very pleased to have fully enrolled our Phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in ALS and look forward to reporting top-line results before the end of next year. This clinical milestone is a key inflection point in the development of NurOwn. We are deeply thankful to many who have made an important contribution to this effort and look forward to quickly completing all clinical and biomarker analyses in support of the filing of a biological license application with the goal of bringing an innovative and much needed treatment option to ALS patients.”"
"A very nice end to the week! As the ph3 ALS trial ends, anticipation of results will drive the stock higher. The results will be unprecedented, which will further fuel the rise. Then come the ph2 MS data, FDA approval and commercialization for ALS. PALS will finally get their effective treatment and shareholders will be greatly rewarded!"
I wonder what caused the stock to spike up 11%? I've done some internet searches but didn't find any news that justified the spike.
Thanks Dennis for sharing that link! Exciting to see legislation to include proposed “Center of Excellence for neurological disorders” at the FDA Oncology already has that....plus funding of 75mm and granting early access to treatment using provisional approval
What a job the ALS patients and advocates did in front of Congress!!! The FDA was so dead (no pun intended). Could the PALS tip the balance in favor of approval?

BCLI needs up to $200 million. Maybe they have a big product launch ahead.
"Anyone want to make some guesses what the stock will do this week? My guess is that there will be an uptrend due to that DC hearing. Hopfully, it will be more double-digit gains like Friday's explosive 14.49% pop."
Mr. Market is not a believer of the glass is half-full and is about to overflow. Look at the price action over the last month.
The placebo lives on in drug testing in the USA while the patient dies. Kill the placebo.
this company has many problems and can't seem to get it right
"BCLI History Lesson: I encourage all investors to study the period from 2/14 to 3/14 and give thought to the news, or lack of news, that drove the share price swing during that period. Essentially the price doubled in that period, then dropped back down to the $5 range. People panicked and took profits. What stands out is the rise from March to late July where we reached $15. The reality is the actual news from July to today is all positive so the massive selloff today is made up of investors that are simply taking gains and not here for the longterm, aka weak hands. In my opinion this past movement parallels today. I expect a steady climb to $20 over 30 days. Again, no news is driving the drop, but the news coming soon will catapult BCLI over $20!Personally speaking I invested in BCLI the moment I got injected with NurOwn. I know it worked for me and that is why I don't get caught up in speculation. My FRS score dropped 9 points leading up to my 1st injection. My FRS score was stable while on NurOwn. I literally got 6 months longer to enjoy life. You can't put a price on that and my belief is the data will definitely support FDA approval. Do your own research before selling on speculation. I certainly did mine!"
Time to let this fly.Let's get that peer review and ....fda blessing...help the als patients now...to live a little bit better lives. GltaPark
What does the CFO know that the CEO won’t share? Yet another example of Chaim being the wrong guy to lead BCLI. BCLI Board of Directors: WAKE UP!!
"The CEO just presented at large investor conference in NY. Based on past experiences this exposure along with FDA press release creates the perfect investment opportunity. When a large investor is looking to infuse capital the buying volume jumps. It is insiders catching wind of a big announcement coming soon. Some people call them ""smart money"" and it borders on insider trading. For retail investors all we can do is follow the pattern, and this fits perfectly. I bet the ER is coupled with capital infusion and share price jumps to $8+. There were some big purchases at $6.50, by ""smart money"" investors. They didn't buy 400k shares at $6.50 on the hope of a nice return. My theory will be validated next week."
"I just watched a presentation from last month by the lead investigator from UC Irvine. Wow, what a promising treatment. It tackles ALS from every direction: preventing apoptosis of neurons, promoting growth of neurons, reducing inflammation etc. She used the words “compelling evidence” more times than I could count. The patients in phase 3 had to endure 7 spinal taps to collect CSF for analysis. It was the largest collection of CSF ever in an ALS trial (expect incredibly rich biomarker data). ALS is probably the most frightening diagnosis I can think of. Not for long IMO. Best wishes to all patients and investors."
I'd say if they have nothing by the end of this month we are toast. The low was 3$ its very disappointing when u know nurown actually works. All we need is 1 piece of solid info .and we skyrocket..keep the faith guys!!
31st International Symposium on ALS/MND on December 9th at 11 AM EST: Dr. Kern and Dr. Cudkowicz give an update on the Phase 3 ALS trial. Does anyone seriously believe BCLI would willingly participate in a conference sponsored by potential bidders such as Biogen and present data if they knew it wasn’t good and end up completely embarrassing themselves?
Another Matt post:Fascinating! Lung function is also where I saw the most improvement. I am still bipap free a year and a half after my first treatment! He was on the bipap machine to help him breath before his Nurown treatment and to be off of it after Nurown is yet another miracle.
"@Kimberly I wanted to respond to your reply on @David’s post below and bump it up, as I think what you said is so very important. If the HEP data is efficacious, coupled with the data they’ve collected on Matt Bellina, who’s now had at least six injections of NurOwn, Brainstorm should push the FDA for conditional approval and give access to pALS NOW. BCLI can finish the P3 as planned, as the trial should conclude in October or November. Making pALS wait even one more day will cost lives and even for those whose life it doesn’t cost, pALS will unnecessarily lose muscle function while waiting for approval that they may never get back. Matt Bellina has stopped progressing and has even regained function. While in the trial, Mark Bedwell, Thurman Maynard, Robert Muggli, amongst many others, stopped progressing. Everyday pALS are forced to wait is cruel and unusual punishment when a drug is available NOW which could potentially stop progression. Our drug approval system is broken. BCLI and the FDA need to step up and work together now to end the suffering by granting conditional approval while allowing the P3 trial to finish as planned. It’s the only humane thing to do."
It sounds like some European countries including Israel will approve Nurown. Otherwise why would they increase capacity. If so this stock will pop very quickly. This will put pressure on FDA to approve if other countries have approved.
What's with the constant shorting?
"Investors forget that BCLI doubled from this level back in May 2020 to June 30 days later to 10 +...I believe this will happen again between now and early next year....Catalysts include more details regarding the p3 data and peer reviewed article publication to include breakthrough bio marker data and better explanation of the placebo group outperformance; BLA filing with the FDA, update on the p2 MS open label trial. Accumulate here is you can....when this moves it will cause a major short squeeze...now highs coming in 2021 and some kind of FDA approval in ALS likely...."

"As a long-time investor with a substantial stake, I will allow myself to summarize where we are at from my own point of view:1.Mid OCT we had a short sell attack that brought the stock from all time highs of 16-17$ after rocketing 400% from the beginning of year which led me to think that maybe a leak of negative data from the phase 3 trails +profit taking+ investors panic set the PPS in the 10-12$ range. Today I am sure after checking management/institutional current ownership that the results were no leaked and it was only panic and profit takings. It was written the ACCBT the CEO held company sold 1m$ at 13$ PPS but in comparison to his private holdings worth then thousands of millions it was a non-issue and did not have any effect. Notably the company used ATM tool to reach a staggering 40m$ cash that can finance further activities and while it set back some of the gains it is the right thing to do."

The fda spokesperson was awful. According to her everything is fine. Brian’s wife called it as it is stating the fda has done nothing but stand in the way.
"The Brainstorm website has a much more complete announcement regarding the details of the new Alzheimer's study. It has a lot more info and sounds even more promising than the abbreviated announcement. Just wish it would discuss funding as well, but still well worth the read. Here's the heart of the full item:The lead investigators of the trial are two world renowned clinical experts in Alzheimer's disease, Philip Scheltens, M.D., Ph.D., and Bruno Dubois, M.D., Ph.D. Prof. Scheltens, the principal investigator (PI) of the study, is Professor of Cognitive Neurology and Director of the Alzheimer Centre at Amsterdam University Medical Centers. He has extensive experience as PI of many international clinical trials in this field. Prof. Dubois, the French national coordinator of the study, is Professor of Neurology at the Neurological Institute of the Salpétrière University Hospital. He is President of the Scientific Committee of France-Alzheimer and of IFRAD (International Fund Raising for Alzheimer's Disease) as well as a member of the European Alzheimer Disease Consortium (EADC). Profs. Scheltens and Dubois will discuss the proposed clinical trial during an upcoming Key Opinion Leader (KOL) webinar and call hosted by BrainStorm on July 8, 2020 at 8:15 AM ET.Speaking on the trial Prof. Scheltens stated, ""We are very eager to evaluate the efficacy of NurOwn in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, because of its unique mechanism of action. While many previous Alzheimer's therapies have focused on a single target such as tau or beta-amyloid, NurOwn has the capability to simultaneously target multiple relevant biological pathways and bring a comprehensive approach to this multifactorial disease. Importantly, NurOwn's mechanism of action may also allow the therapy to enable synergistic combinations with anti-tau or anti-beta-amyloid treatments, further underscoring its potential to address critical unmet needs in Alzheimer's disease.""Prof. Dubois added, ""In such a complex disease, addressing inflammation and neuro-protection is an innovative and very interesting approach. It is a first in the world for this technology and Brainstorm is leveraging encouraging results from the Phase 2 study in ALS.""Ralph Kern, M.D., MHSc., President and Chief Medical Officer of BrainStorm, noted, ""In the proposed Phase 2 clinical trial, our goal is to confirm that the potential shown by NurOwn in our lead ALS program may be extended to patients with Alzheimer's disease. We now have a compelling set of biomarker data supporting NurOwn's mechanism of action, including important pharmacodynamic changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory mediators. Additionally, our innovative biomarker-driven precision medicine approach, which will focus on patients with early-stage disease and pre-defined levels of CSF tau and beta-amyloid proteins, may greatly facilitate Phase 2 clinical trial success.""Stacy Lindborg, Ph.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Research at BrainStorm, said, ""We are excited to introduce a novel approach to Alzheimer's disease that targets both inflammation as well as neurotrophic factors. Given the acute need for vastly different treatment methodologies, we believe our broad targeting approach, combined with robust effects on CSF measures and a favorable safety profile, allows us to go forward with confidence. Additionally, compiling NurOwn safety data across diseases will allow us to enhance patient safety for each trial."" Phase 2 Trial to be Conducted at Leading Alzheimer's disease Centers in EuropeBrainStorm plans to conduct a 52-week, Phase 2 open-label, proof-of-concept clinical trial to evaluate NurOwn in 40 participants with prodromal to mild Alzheimer's disease. Study participants will receive three intrathecal NurOwn doses 8 weeks apart. In addition to meeting well-defined clinical criteria for prodromal to mild Alzheimer's disease, participants must also meet biomarker defined criteria for Alzheimer's disease. The clinical trial will evaluate safety and pharmacodynamics of NurOwn, including effects on inflammatory, Alzheimer's-specific, neurodegenerative, and synaptic biomarkers, as well as a range of key clinical measures of cognition and function. The clinical trial will be conducted at the Brain research Center affiliated with the Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital (Paris), and several other clinical trial sites in the Netherlands and France.http://ir.brainstorm-cell.com/news-releases/news-release-details/brainstorm-expands-clinical-pipeline-evaluate-nurownr-treatment"
"@Halevay, you asked me the following: “JTPlease answer me this, if you don’t mind. The markets are as efficient today as they’ve ever been. People all have the same access to readily available information. If you agree with me on that, then why aren’t more analysts or investors taking an interest in this company? Why is it still a paltry sub $100mm market cap? What do the ppl on this message board know that nobody else seems to know?”My reply:Most people know very little about ALS, as it’s a rare disease, effectIng 1-2/100,000 people. It’s a complicated disease that even most physicians who’ve gone to medical school don’t even understand. The cause of ALS is still unknown, although, in the past few years, there are more plausible theories and some bio/genetic markers that have been identified. Most investors know nothing about ALS. Furthermore, most investors know nothing about stem cell treatments. Small/micro cap biotech companies are a dime a dozen and most legit institutional investors won’t touch a small biotech stock like Brainstorm, especially being under $5/share. The fact is, most ALS P3 trials fail, which doesn’t bode well for investor confidence, if you haven’t done your research and a ton of due diligence. The other fact is, NurOwn’s P2 data shows that NurOwn is more efficacious than anything currently on the market for ALS and that was with one, just one, intrathecal injection. Just on P2 data, it deserved to be approved by the FDA b/c it was better than anything currently approved. Secondly, NurOwn is only getting better in P3 with three intrathecal injections, instead of one—the data will only get better. Thirdly, there a no safety concerns. Zero. Nada. We know this for a fact as well. Fourthly, we have patient testimonials from both the P2 and P3 trials, just in the P3 alone, around 16 patients speaking out about the positive effects of NurOwn. Fifthly, Matt Bellina, under right to try, has received, I believe six injections, and has reversed some of his symptoms. This is simply unprecedented. No drug currently on the market can even slow symptoms to extend life more than three months. Nurown is actually slowing, stopping, and reversing symptoms in some. Furthermore, this is the first time investors have been privied to a live play-by-play under right to try in ALS. Sixthly, pALS are knocking down the doors in Washington to ensure this gets approved. IMHO, one has to be blind to see think this won’t be approved, no later than next year.Trevor provided a valuation on NurOwn, which, in reality, may even be on the low side, but that I agree with. None of that even factors in the possibility that NurOwn might just be efficacious for MS as well, in which the sky is the limit. You can be asleep at the wheel and buy in when this is “more de-risked” at $80 on its way to $100. The way I see it, the probability of success is VERY high, based upon #1-6 stated above. I like my chances and am will to roll the dice at $4 a share that the 53k I’ve invested thus far in NurOwn will be worth $1,3333,300 next year and likely a lot more several years down the road. This is of course my opinion and I’m willing to wager the value of a fairly nice, new car on such, with the goal that instead, I’ll be able to buy a fairly nice, new, beach front home in Cambria in a coupe of years instead. Due your own due diligence and see you at $100-200/share in 1-2 years."
"recovery soon as a blink of God,"
They resumed the meeting.
"Mr. Lebovits continued, ""Beyond our lead ALS program, we continue to make progress and are poised for a catalyst rich 2021 for our NurOwn technology platform. In progressive MS, our Phase 2 top-line data are expected by the end of the first quarter, which we believe will highlight the broad applicability of NurOwn's mechanism of action (MOA). We plan to further advance our pipeline through our clinical development program in Alzheimer's disease, a highly prevalent disease with enormous societal impact and limited treatment options. These clinical programs will be complemented by the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and advancement of our exosome-based platform technology, which has demonstrated the potential to treat COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome in a recently published preclinical study. We believe that execution of these milestones will help move us toward our ultimate goal of addressing the critical unmet needs of patients with neurodegenerative diseases while simultaneously positioning the company to generate shareholder value."""
Haven’t posted in a while so thought I would add my 2 cents to what is happening....Obviously as a serious long I was disappointed in the phase 3 data to say the least....its clear someone leaked what was happening back in Oct which really bugs me....but bottom line we can’t that and the data is what it is....Clearly the short thesis played out as planned near term BUT in my view that high short interest is getting very crowded and will prove wrong intermediate and long term....The short thesis seems to predict no path for ultimate FDA approval....I think as the data gets out there first next week with trial participants then at the Dec conference we will see a clearer path for approval....my view is its likely to be “limited” to the sub group of newer stage patients...but with another trial needed to learn more about what happened with the high placebo group...the part the shorts are missing is the strength of the bio marker data which is a first with ALS! BCLI is on the front lines of adult stem cell therapies...check out MESO today on their agreement with Novartis...IMO its highly likely BCLI gets bought out at some point in the not too distant future...ALS is the Mount Everest of diseases to crack and they are showing clinically meaningful progress with efficacy and statistically meaningful with bio markets ....I could be dead wrong buy I’m betting a short squeeze between now and year end that could catch most by surprise and we are back to 8...then MS data reveal plus limited FDA approval takes us back to new highs in 2021 sooner than most can now fathom....
There was emphasis on patients with ALSFRS-R of greater than 35 and how they demonstrated meaningful response. Their statisticians and external statisticians agreed. It was stated that they submitted approval for all ALS patients. FDA has been responsive which is usually a good sign. Should have phase 2 results for MS in Q1. Alzheimer study not yet started in Europe. My own personal opinion is we are very close to approval for ALS…possibly limited approval.
"Brainstorm Announces Grant of a New Japanese Patent for NurOwnSeptember 16 2020 - 07:30AMNEW YORK, Sept. 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: BCLI), a leading developer of adult stem cell therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases, today announced that the Japanese Patent Office (JPO) has granted Brainstorm's Japanese Patent, number: 6,753,887, titled: 'Methods of Generating Mesenchymal Stem Cells which Secrete Neurotrophic Factors'.The allowed claims cover a method of generating cells which secrete neurotrophic factors from human undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from the bone marrow of a single donor. The said neurotrophic factors includes: brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF); hepatocyte growth factor (HGF); and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).Patent families protecting NurOwn manufacturing have been issued in the United States, Japan, Europe, Hong-Kong and Israel.""We are extremely pleased with the continued development of our patent portfolio protecting our technology through strategic intellectual property achievements. This new patent grant from the Japanese Patent Office is an important addition to our IP portfolio for the NurOwn technology and is an important element of our business strategy"" commented Brainstorm's CEO Chaim Lebovits.David Setboun, PharmD MBA, EVP and Chief Operating Officer, added: ""Having our cell therapy product patented in Japan will increase our ability to enter into new commercial partnerships for NurOwn in Japan."""
"Another thing we have to remember here is Brainstorm discovered a new surrogate biomarker (Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1) for ALS during the P2 trial. MCP-1 was elevated in the CSF of pALS. After a single intrathecal injection of NurOwn, the expression of MCP-1 was reduced by 40%. They held this information about discovering the MCP-1 biomarker data very tight to the vest until the end of last year. In addition to slowing or stopping ALS progression as measured by ALSFRS, it will be VERY interesting to see what the total reduced expression of MCP-1 is after three intrathecal injections of NurOwn, since MCP-1 is released by microglia, astrocytes and damaged motor neurons. The great news here is, BCLI already knows this info for the 11 patients in the Hospital Exemption Program as well as for Matt Bellina who’s already received six injections of NurOwn (I really wonder what his MCP-1 number are) since he’s had twice the number of injection as those in P3 and Hospital Exemption Program. In addition to expanding, ex-vivo, the neurons from the bone marrow aspiration and adding neurotrophic growth factor before readministering, I’m wondering if there isn’t something else that can be added to their secret sauce in the future to make it more potent to further reduce MCP-1 expression or better yet, prevent it from happening altogether. I feel there is a reason BCLI held onto this MCP-1 info for so long, before making it public."
"So many PALS sending letters, tweets, emails to the FDA making the final push to get NUROWN approved. Mike Henson of No More Excuses on youtube had 3 people read their letters that they will be sending to the FDA. One is a spouse of a PAL, one recently lost her husband to ALS and the third has ALS. I don't know how the FDA can not hear these plea's from PALS who were in the trials and saw improvement and not approve NUROWN. They need to keep getting NUROWN to keep the progression at bay. ALS starts the march as soon as NUROWN starts to wain in the PALS system. That varies with each person. Their argument for approval is that 35% is the best results of any treatment for ALS. It is the first time any treatment has slowed, stopped or reversed ALS progression. Brainstorm having 11 years of science that should not be tossed by the wayside instead PALS are asking the FDA for approval now of NUROWN while also doing a phase 4 marketing surveillace program trial allowing the FDA and Brainstorm to gather more information on NUROWNS performance in real world clinical practice across a large spectrum of the ALS population. The FDA is listening and responed to each of these people who sent their letters. The best thing about NUROWN is now all of these people have hope and they don't want it dashed. Please everyone pray that NUROWN is approved so all PALS have access to NUROWN. A WIN-WIN for everyone!!!"
At least one is on bcli side. Park keep going no matter what.
"I've been invested in BCLI since 2012, getting in at around $2 per share and it has been my largest holding, as I have been accumulating shares. The concept behind NurOwn makes total sense and, unlike drug trials that run the risk of failure and major losses for investors, the process here has already been demonstrated to work. Applications beyond ALS and MS (also currently under study) include other neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. I see the sky as the limit."
Game over. FDA new language for ALS takes into consideration patients input. We have all seen the videos and nightline tv special on Newown of several patient results in the trial.
One time say it.And our day is coming #NUROWN
Good news this morning manufacturing deal.
"This was from a poster taking nurown i dont have st account so anyone that wants to ask a question go there...hes making good progress but we need the fda approval on this asap ..here's the post from stocktwits. Klingema12:09 PM$BCLI I received my second infusion of Nurown yesterday at Mayo clinic through the expanded access protocol. After the first infusion on June 10 my balance and stamina improved drastically. I noticed significant improvement in my walking, so did my entire family. This treatment works! Fire away with questions."
"Matt Bellina blog update: ""...I received my first treatment of Nurown in December of 2018. Before my first injection, if you had told me that in twenty months I would be sleeping without a bipap, walking around in the pool, scarfing down ribeyes and riding for hours on the elliptical, I would have been too cautious to let myself dream it."" The results are incredible!! FDA, please approve this asap!!!"
"I just received 2nd injection on Thursday. First injection created body aches and some discomfort for about 24 hours. I assumed it was the hospital bed. This time around I didn't experience any body aches. A little lidocaine poke, LP, and lie flat for 6 hours. My muscles feel calmed down and I am anxious to see what this injection does. I have heard the 2nd and 3rd injection is where the magic happens so I am planning to step up my physical therapy, keeping in mind my body has to be the guide. Last injection July 1st. I suspect phase III is done for everyone by early September. I was accepted into trial September 30th and Brainstorm announced trial full on October 11th. I have to be close to last participant. Getting close to phase III completion!"
"There have been enough cases on the news to prove NurOwn improves functionality for some ALS patients, at least in the short term:- Matt Bellina getting up out of his wheelchair and walking. - The person who can ride a motorcycle again. - The reporter who couldn't move his arm, who regained motion and strength. - The Rabbi who got up and walked from his wheelchair.I think a couple more over the years. So, we don't know yet if it's a long-term solution, but I believe we know it will work dramatically for some people. Questions:1. Assuming it gets approved, will the current treatment centers ramp up delivery?2. Will most ALS-treating doctors be willing to do the relatively simple procedure (injection)?3. Will Brainstorm go it alone and build a fully-functional pharma company or partner with a larger pharma company and concentrate on the pipeline R&D and clinical trials?4. Is the MS trial fully-funded?5. Do we predict a huge spike on FDA approval followed by a share offering at a much higher price followed by short sellers beginning to mess with us?6. Is Brainstorm management fully prepared to fend of the shenanigans that Mannkind went through with Sanofi (assuming Brainstorm partners with big pharma)?7. Is there any news from the compassionate care patients in Israel?"
"Hi Michael, Chaim forwarded your email and asked me to respond to you as we at LifeSci represent them for investor relationsThanks for reaching out, and for your interest in Brainstorm. The Phase 3 trial remains blinded until after data base lock and our intention remains to communicate the results by the end of November. No one – including management, the company’s board of directors, investigators, or participants – knows the results of the study.The move in the stock price over the last few days is unfortunate and, as best we can tell, is the result of a skittish market in front of an anticipated Phase 3 event. We remain very enthusiastic about the ultimate prospects for NurOwn, what it could mean for patients, and the outcome from the Phase 3 trial – but like all clinical trials there is always a degree of uncertainty and the risk of negative results. We appreciate all of your continued support and very much look forward to publicly releasing the communicating the results as soon as they are available.

SENATE LIST (updated Sept 10)We have 24 Total sponsors of Senate Bill #S1813.
"Investors need to have realistic expectations going into the conference presentations of the Phase 3 data on Wed. This will be a scientific presentation NOT an investor presentation. The goal will.be to win over the ALS scientific, advocacy and patient communities regarding the efficacy of Nurown. It’s not as simple as “does it work? “ It’s more complex....we already know the data based on the ALSFRS didn’t reach scientific significance vs placebo BUT the bigger story imo will be the very compelling bio marker data showing clear biological response. This will be a PR battle between “P values” vs. the bio markets which I believe can be used as “surrogate endpoints “ for approval at least in the predesignated sub group newer in the disease progression. But I could also see a scenario where the various stakeholders form a groundswell consensus based on the “totality” of the evidence to get an accelerated FDA approval. Whatever you do, don’t use “:stop loss” orders going into WED as I suspect things to be volatile as pressure to approve Nurown for ALL may be bigger than many think....and imo the FDA could absolutely grant FULL approval not just for a subgroup. But we will need to hear from the company after the presentations...but keep in mind they will gauge their FDA approval strategy based on the feedback they get from the conference....MY view is that there will be a huge short squeeze before year end as a path for approval gets revealed...big time pressure for a Nurown approval at least within the sub group but the bio market data may be the “home run” the ALSFRS could not provide.The does “work” and shorts don’t see the pathway using the bio markets as the surrogate endpoint to get there..."
"Because I’ve been asked, I will again share my thoughts about the stock and those on the investment message board. To disclose, I am long the stock. I have never shorted the stock nor purchased puts on it. I’ve been invested for many years, but do not own enough shares to really care that much. I view this as a lottery ticket. I question those on the board that incessantly pump the stock more than I question what goes on at brainstorm central behind the scenes.Too many here think Phase 3 is a done deal and it’s only a matter of time before the stock “takes off”, but that could not be further from the truth. Not a day goes by when some bio pharma stock doesn’t get decimated after a phase 3 failed trial. When you look at what is reported out from this company, it’s almost laughable. From one quarter to the next you’ll read about which hospital is going to house the next trial, or an announcement of the 10th patient that has signed up for phase 2, or that Chaim was just voted the “best beard by a CEO “award. We’ve heard for 6 quarters now about why they haven’t announced a partnership yet even though they will need funding in the very near future. In the meantime, Chaim makes a ridiculous salary for a company whose market cap is micro micro micro.And while the pALS community still rallies behind this company, the truth is that there are still only a handful of patients who have responded very positively to the treatment.So in summary, this is not about being a stock that just hasn’t been noticed yet or it only being a matter of time. There is still a lot that needs to be done and needs to be proven. And I for one, I’m not yet sold on it. I think history has given me the right to be skeptical"
"*Extremely long post warning. BCLI math class is back in-session!! I’ll eventually get to the math portion, but work with me first for a minute. I’m not saying BCLI can or will go at it alone without a partnership or licensing deal with BP for the US market, but I think it would be in our best interest as shareholders I’d they did. BCLI has already spent the big money on R&D, taking NurOwn all the way to P3 completion. I don’t think BCLI would need a very big salesforce in order to take the US market alone either. If you really think about it, the reality is, we would just need 30-60 ALS clinics/hospital sites to administer NurOwn to accomplish its US sales goals and meet the need. Remember, pALS are traveling internationally right now to get stem cells, and paying big money to do so, with very little effect. You don’t hear any anecdotal reports from pALS of overseas stem cell centers reporting a halting of disease or reversal of symptoms and thousands and thousands of pALS have gone overseas in the last decade. However, with only 240 people getting NurOwn in P2 and P3, a lot of people have come forward to give their testimony in those trials about slowing, halting and reversal of disease. My point is, PALS will find a way to get there, even if they have to travel domestically and most pALS are already traveling to attend certified ALS clinics quarterly anyways. IMO, your average private practice neurologist isn’t ever going to be performing this procedure or offering NurOwn, as it’s too time consuming and their offices/practices aren’t designed for such. This will likely only be a procedure done by Neuromuscular Neurologists at a certified ALS Centers of Excellence, of which there are only 63 currently in the US. Six of those centers have been a part of the P3 trial and are already very familiar with the process/procedure. These six sites should already be ready to hit the ground running upon FDA approval or HR7071 passing, whichever comes first. BCLI’s salesforce wouldn’t need to be very big at all to keep the US in-house, as they would only need to visit one site to give their pitch to all the neurologists in the area who would be doing or prescribing the procedure. This isn’t a “going doctors office to doctors office” sort of sales approach where there are thousands and thousands of doctors offices to visit. We’re likely looking at a maximum of 63 sites. PALs are also going to be their own best salesforce, IMO, as they’re already banging down the doors to get NurOwn now. I’m hopeful that BCLI’s most recent hire, whose charged with insurance approval and negotiations as well as the reported exercise of the ATM, are both signs that BCLI plans to keep NurOwn wholly owned, at least in the US anyway. Finally, BCLI is already using City of Hope and Dana Farber Cancer Center for their manufacturing sites. I’m not sure what the capacity is at these two sites and whether they would need to be expanded in order to meet demand, but I’m sure our top-notch management already has a good pulse on that and has a plan in place. Ok, now to the math and these are ultraconservative estimates, so, keep that in mind. The following of course is based upon BCLI keeping NurOwn as a wholly owned drug (if you can actually even really call NurOwn a drug, which it’s really not). According to Bloomberg, BCLI currently has 31.53 million shares outstanding (not factoring in any recent use of the ATM). If BCLI were to only penetrate 3% of the ALS market worldwide with NurOwn, we’d be looking at treating 13,500 pALS a year. I’d suspect, out of the 30,000 pALS in the US, BCLI will easily treat 13,500 a year in the US alone, as there aren’t going to be many pALS who don’t want NurOwn in their body ASAP if the P3 data replicates or is even better than the P2 data, but we’ll stick with 13,500 worldwide for now. An extremely conservative sales price per patient for six treatments a year 75k/yr. An extremely conservative earning per patient is 20k/yr. That’s $8.70/share in earnings. Slap a conservative 15 p/e on there and BCLI is at . a share! That’s a lot of dough Ladies and Gents! I already know I’m getting wayyyy ahead of myself, as we don’t even know for certain if NurOwn will be approved, but it sure is fun to run the numbers and fantasize now that the trial is complete and top line data is imminent. Does anyone else think BCLI will keep NurOwn wholly owned and go at it alone, at least for the the US market? I welcome any thoughts, opinion or feedback."
This thing should be 23$ right now not 3$ and pocket change...come on fda put your seal of approval on this...and help these als patients to live a few more years and a little bit better...do it
"It took 1.2million shares to go from 3.50 to 4.15, now with 132k shares the MM brought it down .40, he is good."
"Fmello: I see you're anxious for news but can anyone tell me the lasttime this company had anything to excite us with,What a drought w/o anything substantial to give us hope and a breath of relief.Does anyone care enough? Is anything even appearing on the horizon.MS news? Something? Strange!!"
I think they will seek a limited approval. And do more testing in the subset. It's safe and it is working. And they will do data for that group. Could be a good time to accumulate more shares. Ms trial will show them all that the science here is stronger than the emotion floating around.
"This name is way under the radar still for institutional buying but that will change quickly as we make a new high and move to 5 +. Do yourself a favor and listen to the last cc. I can’t recall a more honest and transparent leadership team. Lots of catalysts, strong insider ownership and buying; big things in the works"

"Everyone here knows I’m bullish. I haven’t sold a single share. In full disclosure, I had planned to sell about 19% of my shares at $20, to recoup my initial investment, and then let the remaining shares ride to a $100+ (or bust). I’m going to for the first time make an “other side of coin” post, even though I know it may get many thumbs down. What makes a board good is for its members to be able to look at and analyze both sides of coin and I encourage others here to counter my wonderings or even add to them! So, here goes: I find it odd, unless I missed it somewhere, BCLI didn’t issue a press release saying the P3 trial has concluded, data was locked, and/or analysis is underway. I find it odd Brainstorm seems focused (or hyperfocused) lately on releasing info on Exosomes for ARDS, and Alzheimer’s, yet avoiding releases on ALS (trial being over, data analysis in progress). Another poster referenced this earlier today as well and I think it’s a good point. It seems a little suspect that they’re painting the picture for investors that they aren’t a one trick pony, and are they doing this in trying to salvage investors if NurOwn for ALS fails? Is it odd they stopped the HEP program despite having approval for another 13 patients AND they also are staying tight lipped about HEP data from the first cohort being released/published/presented, despite Chaim saying earlier this year that data would “likely be published in the spring”. There was never any update on or explanation as to why this never happened. Was the HEP data not good enough to be published? Is the share price crashing because the data analysis is indeed underway and something negative has been leaked already (data always gets leaked and retail investors are always the last to know)? Is it odd we are still “under the radar” (low institutional ownership) despite now having a double digit share price and P3 data release being so imminent? Is it odd we used the ATM pre-P3 data release when they could have waited a couple months and raised cash post-P3 data, if they were confident the share price would be higher? We have to remember, BCLI is in a VERY unique situation because they’ve had appetizer P3 data for a while via both Matt Bellina and HEP, so they already know on a smaller scale what three injections of NurOwn can do. Bob has already provided a counterpoint to this curiosity in a prior post. Is it odd that they still haven’t announced a partnership even though Setboun has been highly incentivized to secure one before the P3 data analysis began? Surely with top line data release now being 42 days (or less) away, they must be analyzing data already. We’re partners not all that impressed with HEP and Matt Bellina data? Feel free to add to this list or counter anything I’ve said. Again, I haven’t sold a single share and am still very bullish the stock and think our odds of success outweigh our odds of failure. I just think for the last year or more, we’ve painted out all the pros and many many many reasons why we think NurOwn will be approved, but looking at the full picture and not missing any clues, for good or bad, makes us all better investors."

"Chaim Lebovits, CEO of BrainStorm, commented, ""We are pleased to have the opportunity to treat additional patients with NurOwn through this Expanded Access Program, which was strongly advocated for by members of the ALS advocacy community. We recognize the urgency with which people with ALS want and need access to new potential treatments. This EAP is an important next step to providing an immediate option for some patients. We remain committed to rapidly advancing NurOwn through clinical development and regulatory review in the hope that the greatest number of people living with ALS may benefit.""regulatory review in the hope that the greatest number of people living with ALS may benefit.""seems like there is negotions with the fda on what groups will be included in the approval."
"from fb I have been given a gift. Many of you read last June that Brainstorm would be treating me with the experimental treatment of Nurown under the new federal Right to Try law. Today I want to thank the company and CEO Chaim Lebovitz for following through and keeping their word. Only one month after my first round of treatment I have improvement in the clinical strength of my right deltoid and my left bicep. My forced vital lung capacity is 23% higher and I am seeing subjective improvement in my speech and swallowing. I no longer need a bi pap at night. Due to increased core strength and coordination I am now able to pull myself up to standing. Because this is an investigational therapy we don't know what tomorrow will bring but for now we are feeling incredibly blessed. In addition to Chaim and the people at Brainstorm there are a few others I need to thank. To Jim Worthington and the NAC and all my friends and family who got this law passed, you are heroes. The bipartisan group of political leaders who never gave up on the bill; especially Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and Senators Ron Johnson and Joe Donnelly. I also need to thank President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for making this law a reality. To the medical team that administered this treatment, thank you for blazing this path.For all of my brothers and sisters in the ALS community, I know I didn't deserve this opportunity any more than you did. This is a group of people facing extraordinary hardship that has banded together to make the world a better place. I only hope I can earn the blessing of your friendship by fighting every day until you all have the same opportunity."
"I have held this stock for many years.Brainstorm has done the trials perfectly. Blue chip hospitals, good strong protocols, long duration.We will know the results by end of the year.If results are decent, the stock is going to skyrocket."
"Matt Bellina, who just had his seventh NurOwn injection this month posted the following on his FB page commenting on the pre-clinical study (Smart sciencey talk) I posted early today about NurOwn:“I am thinking all of this smart sciencey talk has something to do with why I was able to walk 15 laps in the pool yesterday without fatigue.”A man who couldn’t stand on his own two years ago walked 15 laps in a pool yesterday because of NurOwn. I’m pretty sure it doesn’t work. ;)"
"We know Brainstorm entered into a Commercialization Agreement with Catalent on 10/22 which calls for Brainstorm to pay Catalent up to $4.2 Million for initial technology transfer, raw storage, etc. As part of that agreement, according to the 8-K, Brainstorm ALREADY made a $1 million up front payment to Catalent, which is NON-REFUNDABLE. Brainstorm made that payment at a time when the P3 data was likely still blinded, but, they of course already had the HEP and Matt Bellina data in-hand. That agreement was inked with Catalent probably a week or two, at most, before the P3 data was to be unblinded. This of course assumes Brainstorm is going to follow through and still provide TLD by the end of November, as they have previously stated. If there was any doubt whatsoever in Chaim’s mind that the P3 data was going to be less than stellar, based upon the other 3+ injection of NurOwn data he already had in-hand, would he have agreed to make a NON-REFUNDABLE $1 million dollar payment to Catalent OR would he have instead held out mere days, to a couple weeks longer to see the P3 TLD before inking that deal and kissing a million bucks goodbye forever?!?"
"This is from Debbie Garland Bellina, mother of Matt Bellina who is a good friend and fellow pALS. We pray for NurOwn success This is NurOwn, the experimental therapy Matt has been receiving under the Right To Try Law. NurOwn changed the trajectory of Matt’s disease. It can do the same for people living with ALS today. It isn’t a cure, but we accept therapies that slow other diseases like cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease. People living with ALS deserve the same consideration by the medical community and the FDA. The news here is the published study in a highly respected peer reviewed journal. The phase 2 data supports the reports from phase 3 participants and my son Matt who is receiving this therapy under the Right To Try law and being administered by the VA. We are on the cusp of getting a therapy to people living with ALS today.."
"Well since we are near the first finish line I find myself reflecting on the road with BCLI and would like to share the highlights ...1.It started in 2005 I think when a young but skilled mainly in the mining (diamonds I think) African area decided to assist and take over an Israeli company that came out of the academic vaitsman institute with a patent that adult stem cells can cure neurologic diseases. these 2 professors a mr.ofan and a Mr melamed were quite brilliant. but the company was bankrupt and Mr. Haim Labovitch invested 5m$ for about 40% of the company stocks and options it was pre 1:15 split days so the stock went up from 40 cents to 1$ I think and were about 300m outstanding shares so they reached today's MC.Then he took over as the CEO and although the product worked great with MS and Parkinsons on mice tests he decided to go for ALS because I think it was the simplest track (orphan drug, fast track, no cure...and low cash in the company bank account).The road was long and hard the stock even reach 0.06 cents pre-split and Haim decided to bring in a professional CEO from the field that pushed for uplisting from the OTC to nasdaq what was requiring a minimum of 5 $ PPS so they split 1:15 stock went from 30 cents to 4.5$ and the outstanding stock to about 20m shares. Haim brought in from his other business of GAS&OIL SHEMEN FIELD private investors that added millions of $$$ and they also got yearly grants from the Israeli government-head scientist office.They started testing on humans and did some of the trails treatments under the Israeli amendment to treat people that don't have any cure for their condition and the results were amazing the most famous case is of a rebbai who had ALS and also other conditions and he actually started to speak got up of his wheelchair and started walking ... a miracle!It's hard to sum up 15 years but eventually, Haim got back to the CEO sit built an expensive professional team (beat pick was ralph), and got hundreds of millions from all kinds of investors to keep the tests going.I personally believe the Nurown platform works (I read descents of testimonials) and ALS is just the start but to continue it must be approved to get the required verification to move forward.I must say the stock price was many years undervalued but long investors like me stood tool and road the waves and since the beginning of the year 4$ to 17$ high got paid for their belive.BCLI could be a unicorn and pass 1B$ MC by the end of this year and I hope they don't sell out cheap because if they succeed in the ALS it is only the beginning of what could be a multi-billion company with great professional people running it so thank Haim Ralph and team for doing a great job curing people from these terrible diseases and making us investors rich on the way :)"
"Got this response from investor relations. The response I expected, but just thought I'd share.1. WILL YOU PUT OUT A PRESS RELEASE STATING THE DATE YOU WILL RELEASE THE UNMASKED PHASE THREE DATA OR WILL YOU SIMPLY RELEASE THE DATA THE DAY IT IS AVAILABLE? We have stated multiple times that the data will be released by the end of November and that remains the only guidance that we will have on the timing. 2. CAN YOU GIVE A DATE YOU WILL RELEASE THE DATA, OR CAN YOU AT LEAST SAY IF IT WILL BE RELEASED IN THE FIRST HALF OR SECOND HALF OF NOVEMBER? What we have publicly stated is that it will be released by the end of November and we are not providing any more specificity than that. 3. DO YOU RECEIVE RAW DATA FROM THE STUDY SITES, I.E. DO YOU KNOW IF ANY PATIENTS HAVE SHOWN IMPROVEMENT EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T KNOW WHO RECEIVED NUROWN AND WHO RECEIVED A PLACEBO? We can not comment on the specifics of the study but emphasize that the overall trial is still completely blinded to everyone as dictated by the protocol. 4. DOES THE COMPANY HAVE A STATEMENT CONCERNING THE RECENT DECLINE IN THE STOCK PRICE? We cannot comment on daily fluctuations in the company’s stock price, other than to emphasize we remain very confident in the fundamentals and that the P3 trial remains completely blinded. THANK YOU FOR ANY ASSISTANCE YOU CAN PROVIDE. Thanks for reaching out and for your interest in Brainstorm. It is a very exciting time for the company and we look forward to publicly communicating all of our future news in a timely and appropriate fashion once we are in a position to do so."

Brian and his wife gave a very powerful and moving speech it pretty much brought me to tears but also anger that these buffoons are holding this up..approve #nurown asap...give these patients and many more around the world some hope at least for a little better life..Just do the right thing. Now.
"I AM ALS becomes the first ALS patient advocacy group to bring together senior FDA leadership and a biotechnology company for an in-person meeting WASHINGTON, D.C. – In a first-of-its-kind meeting, I AM ALS brought together senior leadership from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics, a U.S. biotechnology company that is developing a potential breakthrough ALS treatment, NurOwn. NurOwn has been studied in 4 clinical trials to date, and is currently the only ALS treatment nearing the end of its phase 3 clinical trial. The groundbreaking meeting was the first in-person meeting ever convened by an ALS patient advocacy group between senior FDA leadership and a biotechnology company. I AM ALS arranged the meeting to discuss Brainstorm’s ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of NurOwn as well as efforts to speed treatment access to the ALS patient community. The meeting enabled an open dialogue between the FDA and Brainstorm that sets the stage for future meetings to explore bringing this treatment to those living with ALS as expeditiously as possible. I AM ALS presented the FDA with two petitions signed by more than 20,000 individuals calling on the FDA to release its updated Clinical Trial Guidance for ALS Treatments and to approve pending ALS treatments as expeditiously as possible.“We see everyday the stories of ALS patients who have received NurOwn or participated in Brainstorm’s clinical trials. These stories, in which patients describe the slowing or reversal of their disease, if confirmed, are a potentially game changing development in the fight against ALS for which there is currently no cure and which on average kills those suffering from it within 2 to 5 years,” said I AM ALS Co-Founder Brian Wallach. Wallach added: “At I AM ALS, we are committed to helping any company searching for ALS cures do so as quickly as possible to help those suffering today. We commend Brainstorm for taking this meeting and for its commitment to finding a much needed treatment option. We appreciate that FDA leadership made this meeting a priority, and thank them for their willingness to explore every way possible to accelerate potentially life saving treatments. We will continue to push for approval of these treatments and look forward to working with FDA leadership to expedite making breakthrough treatments available to every ALS patient as soon as possible.”"
"I watched the entire clip (90 minutes) and as a chem and bio teacher I understand the science and analysis of the presentation.. and I was very impressed. There are no guarantees until the final data is released (end of November/ early December) but the reporting and explanation and analysis of the phase 2 data was compelling. Her explanation of how phase three was larger and better designed was very good. The question and answer period at the end also gave me confidence in a positive response when the FDA gets an application, assuming the data continues to be good. Owning this for as long as I have with a decent sized position I’m excited to think what could happen to the share price. I won’t estimate some pie in sky numbers like I see with other Biotech stocks but I suspect it will make all of us very happy if it all comes to fruition."

Peer review will double this...be patient..then watch the covering and shorty panic...hold strong guys!
"What is the realistic hope for this stock prior to any sort of a makeshift forced FDA approval? I've been a shareholder for 4.5 years now (4k total), still hopeful for the home run, but like many I've been watching the daily regression prior to last week. Is it likely that we will have subtle uplift based on reputation/hope/congressional hearing aftermath (fluctuating between $3.50-5.00 for the foreseeable future) and then shoot to the $25-50 range upon any approval?"
Monday seems like continued downtrend people on twits probably right 2$ coming ...no news for a few months still = plenty of time to run down price ...keep shorting this
"Experts support advancing Nurown as a treatment for ALS, Chaim said it's not a question of if but how and when. Their top priority is defining Nurown path forward but they must let additional developments play out first. I'm thinking the BIIB approval was one of them. Another development is the published data for the ALS trial and the results from outside experts (peer review), once those results are in, if favorable they should move forward with the BLA submission. Not to mention Phase 2b trial for MS and phase 2 for Alzheimer. Just my 2 cents but I think we are in a good position."
"Well, after sitting on the sidelines for a while, I am back in at $3.50. This is for a few reasons, but with fewer shares for now compared to the first time I invested here. I figure $15k is worth a little risk in this company because: 1) the COngressional hearings went well and the FDA is under MAJOR pressure right now to do something about ALS and get drugs into bodies. 2) the post trial EAP, for select trial participants (who were likelycherry picked) appears to be over, or nearly over, with many pALS reporting having just received their third injections. The videos and reports of several of the participants (3 I’ve seen), who report no or slowed progression in EAP, are indeed impressive. 3) If the EAP data is decent, coupled with the FDA being on the hot seat right now, timing couldn’t be more perfect for NurOwn, and I believe NurOwn will likely be approved in the US, for at least a sub population of patients, with a post marketing analysis. 4) I believe NurOwn will likely be approved overseas. I haven’t been on this board much in the last few months, but I check in and read posts from time to time. I just have to say that Park is a complete and utter idiot. He’s like a cricket constantly chirping, yet offers ZERO posts of any substance. The definition of a cheerleader on steroids, with his head totally in the clouds. Park, you are muppet. I will end with this, time is of the essence for NurOwn though. Coya has now taken on Dr Appel’s T-REG treatment and P2 data is due out anytime. Because of COVID and funding issues, Dr Appel had issues with his P2 trial, and is therefore planning a P2b with Coya at the helm to eliminate funding issues. However, if his P2 data is anywhere as good as his P1 data, in that he stopped the progressive of ALS completely in all trial participants, NurOwn could very soon take a back seat to T-REGS, as T-REGs appears far superior thus far. So, BCLI, IMO, is going to be a stock to get in and out of, and likely not a long term hold. The only thing NurOwn has going for it right now is that it has ZERO competition. If the T-REG P2 data is good and Coya ever does an IPO, I will be a buyer there for sure."
Hopefully we see a pop today! can't listen live hope it's great news!
NOT sure what's going on here...obviously the pps is under control and completely being manipulated...if these guys have anything its going to surface soon...I'm not going to sell anything here for a 20 or 30% gain..this is potentially lifesaving and its proven it...in front of the fda a Congressional leaders...nurown works...its worth is billions so what your seeing now Is all smoke and mirrors
Just odd how this keeps going lower .The si is only 5%.Is this naked shorts doing this or just not enough interest and games from the mms.It seems incessant
"Do you guys think that the 8 % drop we had, was because this shelf offering? Because I can' t find a good reason. Now, why would they want more shares if they have plenty. They have no debt and they have 40 m in the bank to pay Chaim."
If this drops below 3.30 I'll buy a bunch more...1 excellent peer review and Any positive feedback for once from the fda and we'll be back in business...big time!Hold for the gold guys!
"ConclusionWe’re excited about the potential for NurOwn in AD and we look forward to the initiation of the Phase 2a trial later in 2020. We have recently made a few changes to our model, including the inclusion of NurOwn in AD and lowering of the discount rate from 20% to 15% for all indications. We model for the company to file for approval of NurOwn in AD in 2026 and to be granted approval in 2027. We currently estimate peak sales of over $2 billion for NurOwn in AD in both the U.S. and E.U. Using a 25% probability of approval leads to an NPV of $113 million. Combined with the NPV for NurOwn in ALS ($700 million) and MS ($41 million) along with the company’s current cash position and potential cash from warrants leads to a valuation for the company of a bit less than $900 million. Dividing by the company’s current fully diluted share count of 35.7 million leads to a valuation of $25 per share.https://scr.zacks.com/News/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2020/BCLI-KOL-Event-Gives-Overview-of-the-use-of-NurOwn-in-Alzheimers-Disease-Raising-Valuation-to-25-Share-article/default.aspx"
No new news on conference call. However it sounds like peer review is going well for ALS and very positive. The big news is the Congressional hearings and a change in law with the FDA that would address subgroup positive results treatment approval. This would allow ALS nurown approval with ease. I believe the company is waiting on Congress to approve. Approximately 300 Congressman cosponsor legislation ALS so it will pass. After hearings comes a vote. Then Brainstorm can submit with the experts opinions on results for very positive subgroup. Remember the most important testimony was that a few als patients on nurown saw a reversal which was commented during the hearings as remarkable.
