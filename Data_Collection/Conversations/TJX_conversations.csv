TJX is an incredible company. Blows other discount apparel and home goods retailers away with inventory and selection. Stores are always packed but well staffed and clean. Tremendous opportunity here for investment and growth plus decent dividend.
Hope supply chain issue solved by next year but this year is ok. Lots of merchandise to sell.
TJX is setting up big moves such as $150 by 2022. It's not crazy but for real. All metrics point to higher highs in stock prices. Not all retailers can do that except TJX.
Retail sales up in September. TJX sales even better.
I work for TJX in the U.K. and we are crushing comp and forecasted sales. I canâ€™t see a miss.
Just keep buying any dips in October and you'll have plenty of money for gifts come Christmas.
TJX and Marshals very busy even on rainy day.
Began a position
I went to TJX and Marshals and lines are packed. This morning I bought back in. I think earnings good at TJX while other retailers are not doing as well. I believe TJX is going to go back up to $90 again.
$150 price target in 2022.
Also TJX and Marshals are very busy at other stores I visited. Perhaps the supply chain issue is not affecting TJX as much as other retailers. Stock should go back up. I bet $120 by early 2022 as pandemic winding down.
"Went to the Fremont California TJX. Pretty busy with long lines at the register. I spend another $150. today. Looks like every time I go inside, my average bill is $150 bucks. Seems ok to me that business is pretty decent. Hope true for the rest of the world."
"As expected, looks like even analysts are believing earnings will be great for TJX."
"TJX and Marshals very busy with large number of customers lining up long lines paying for Friday afternoon. So, let's hope across the world is the same what I saw. I think so due to fact people are watching their wallet more than ever and going to find bargains at the best retailers discounter TJX."
ebay indicated internet sales boom is over. This means store fronts will be big benefits from people going back to the stores for shopping. Great for TJX especially people will be looking for bargains.
400 shares and holding did see 3 cashiers a 10 person line so some buying might add upon earnings
"TJX and Marshals very busy with lots of shoppers from my areas in SF bay area. I think people are still looking for good value when shopping. Inflation really driving people to watch their cash. I sold TJX at $76 before due to supply chain issues but checking around, looks like TJX might be ok."
I'm more worry about a large market correction coming.
Worry about the market dropping back down tomorrow as selling season is here and a rotation to buy China's stock while they are low compared to US stocks.
"Even if miss this quarter, how low you think TJX will fall to? I think $57 is lowest price."
Must be great earnings
"Rain has ended in the SF bay area. Some areas of flooding but overall ok for shoppers. TJX should be very busy going into Christmas season. Also, lots of stuffs to buy at TJX and Marshals and Home Goods I visited. Don't see any supply chain issues."
"Went to Marshals today and bought $160 of clothing. Register line was all the way out to other areas. Pretty busy for sure. Probably by Christmas shopping, the store will run out of things to sell. I think earnings should be very good."
Also everyone should buy QS and DCRC before they go much higher by December. Also should buy some NNOX and MIRO before they go to the moon. All these are probably close as you can have for being the next Tesla stocks. $100 billion market caps easily achieved in the next few years. I owned all of them including TJX.
Earnings might be in line but analysts want to send price down due to in-line earnings. Valuations are high but Winter sales should be great due to shoppers looking for bargains in November.
"My quantumscape going up big time. I told you to buy QS, DCRC, NNOX, Bidu before."
Short sellers always like to manipulate after market trades for whatever reasons. That's what they do on almost every stock everyday.
$90 is finally coming back. Might make to $140 by 2022.
Supply chain is easing in the port of Oakland. Ships were piling up but now Mayor wants 24/7 and working ok but not the best yet but moving goods to port. A Good sign.
Online sales from Amazon is slowing down. Even Baba is down today. This means shoppers are going back to the stores to shop. TJX should have a great Christmas. $100 coming back but $150 to $170 is not unreasonable.
Lowest price could be at $62. I will be buying. Weak quarter but strong Christmas this year especially if Biden sends out one lady stimulus check. He also will forgive another $4.5 billion student loans so these people can spend more money during Christmas instead of having to pay student loan debts. Americans will be paying for all student loans in the future as Americans want free loans for colleges.
I rather buy a stock with more shoppers than a retailer with less traffic. TJX and Marshals are full of shoppers. Must buy more if dips. That's all you can do since no one knows the bottom and why anyone would sell below current prices. $50 would be excellent price for everyone. I would just average down.
Shorts will be roasted by TJX's great earnings and earnings power. No one should short TJX. You can short Macy's or J.c. penney but not TJX.
"Some companies with a larger market cap than Affirm's $38B: Coca Cola $KO, Starbucks $SBUX, TJMaxx $TJX, Docusign $DOCU, Ross Stores $ROST. Affirm is scaling their volume by about 2 X per year without purchasing inventory or real estate or fulfillment centers. Own Quality."
Will go to TJX and Marshals at different locations to check for shoppers this whole week to see good traffic or less shoppers. If many shoppers lining up to pay and full of shoppers then TJX should have good earnings going forward. Hope other investors here do the same. I'm in the San Francisco Bay Area.
My Quantumscape and DCRC are moving up. Got a good feeling infrastructure bill coming soon so my BLGO should start moving up as well. TJX should do very well moving toward Christmas. Every TJX I visited were full of lines paying. Many retailer's registers don't have any lines at all. Even Ross store only had short lines as I do shop there also. Ross and TJX and Marshals are the only stores I go to except for high end goods. I go to San Francisco Premium outlets in Livermore California to shop for high end goods.
Been going to Marshals and TJX almost every other day and seeing the same long lines at the register almost nonstop all day long. Should be great earnings coming this Christmas and into next year.
Imagine nonstop accepting money from the cash register will make great profits for TJX. I see many retailers like Macy's basically empty with a few shoppers long distance away from each other. I know TJX margin might be lower than regular retailers but the volume will make up for better profits.
Hedge funds forecast earnings miss?
Business is great. Buy with both hands and feet. $150 by 2022.
