"I had 400 shares, added another 100 today. It's a long play as Norm said. I expect to see a bounce, Black Friday and Christmas will be good for Foot Locker. Next QE after this one promises to be very good, even Zacks says so."
What's up today?
Be prepared for shorting In the morning.big missed expectation
I’m here for the dividend
Omg 25$ a share if only I had some money left to buy more shares ://
"The way I am figuring things, FL is trading at about 30% less than what they would get if they sold all assets and paid all liab... I think Benjamin Graham called this the 'breakup value"" of a company. Total Assets- Total liab= about 2.4 billion dollars...today the mkt cap of FL is 1.905 Billion... I am seeing this as incredibly undervalued by almost any measure. Time to buy... Thoughts?"
"made my first short on a small position at 40.26. thinking this is to much for one day without some pull back. GL to all longs though, must've been an exciting day! Cheers"
retailers strongest season is coming up everything should go up
"Worth $6B, no thanks"
Not saying it gonna be green but this will reverse at some point in the afternoon.
Come on 50.
Foot Locker is gonna beat earnings huge and will raise guidance!! I've done my homework. Look for a 5 cent beat!! Gonna fly tomorrow!!
"I expect FL to move back towards its 20 day exponential moving average of $46.46 over the next two weeks. FL was up about 4% in November after its competitor DKS had a positive ER. DKS reports next week on March 13. Another competitor, HIBB, reports on March 16. I plan to add shares if we see the shares move above $42 this week and write March 16 call options at $44 or $45."
"Here's a scenario, it pops when market opens, and all the shorts rush to cover, so it rises more... Add that to the large amount of people jumping on it. We could see $40 today if things go well."
WOW 8.9Billion Annual revenue making company is available at 6billion market caps. Best place to park your money in this market
Buying FL here. If they just suspend the dividend for the remainder of 2020 they should be just fine! Cash on the balance sheet will weather this
%20 surge
Must be a seller holding this down today. Push up to 30’s next couple weeks wouldn’t surprise me
In with 1000 Shares @ 48.56
"This is the point where the Financial Media does a full 180, in tune with their Wall Street backers/paymasters. Expect a flood of positive media from this point. If you are on it when the ride starts turns to the good side, then well done because you read it well."

Maintained as Outperform at Cowen. Price target $61.
5 NEW UPGRADES. One would think people would be all over this. A screaming buy right now!!
Buy more to average down. I think this jumps later
Big Earnings Beat coming. Hold for at least a week
Back to 55 by early next week
seriously? who needs more shoes?
"On Saturday, Market Watch published an article,""Opinion: 10 Value Stocks to Buy for 2020."" FL holders might enjoy it."
"Don't listen to the Debbie Downers, appears to be the same manipulative loser in several id's. This is a long play. Going into the holiday season, it is the last chance at these prices. I expect a surprise tomorrow. Consider also how the same people told us Walmart (and retail generally) was finished. Well look at Walmart today closed at 99.62. Trust the fundamentals and your common sense, don't trust anyone on a message board, not even me."
Buy when its down. Its easy. Just begin with a small amount and accumulate when its going lower. Stock price rise potential and crazy safe high dividend yield.
Lots of good points here ... just wish $FL beat those comps!!! https://stockmarkettoday.blog/2018/08/24/earnings-season-continues-to-surprise-new-market-trend-starting
Is it time to double down ?
I just bought a butt load of this on yesterday's dip. I'm already being re-warded. Looking for at least 40% additional upside on this. Lets go!!
"Strong quarterly results. Beat on both sales and profits. Balance sheet is very strong, enormous net cash position. Dividend restored.Will ws like it?"
Only retailer making a comeback after the report that described how 13% of our population which represents the second largest minority group in America is spending their stimulus check. Though it is better than looting the Foot Locker which they did all of last year at BLM protests.
Maintained as Outperform at Raymond James. Price target $50.
Action is looking good. Just maybe something positive is said in the conference call tomorrow. Everyone hated this stock and that's usually a sign to buy. Anyone buying ahead of earnings tomorrow?
"FL didn't sell about covid 19 disaster things,so it's earnings real good,but amzn tgt and wmt sell too many about covid 19 disaster things,so their earnings not real good, because about covid 19 disaster things was temporary things, so FL sales strong growth was real growth,it can keep continue growth,FL worth$56 per share now,"
"for all the people asking why this is down, check SE asian covid and supply chain situation, they should manage this Q but if this lock down continues, next Q will be in trouble, yes that's holiday season...but this sp level is getting very attractive now, watch close for a entry point if this forms a bottom"
Can someone explain how a stock like FL is being treated like this? It is super cheap right now but no one is willing to buy and I don't get it.
Upgraded to Outperform at Cowen. Price target $55.
Foot Locker is down 4.93% to 54.36
now is the time to get in
bought 1k shares at the close

"Read this ""Foot Locker Slips Despite a Thorough Earnings Beat — Buy the Dip""In June of this year, Smart Investing editor Charles Payne declared that FL stock is a traditional-retailing investment on a genuine comeback trail. Specifically, Payne cited management’s efforts in revitalizing the brand. He stated that “keys going forward will be continued shedding of non-performing stores, selling premium products and managing inventories effectively.”"
"FL had a $1.8 billion in cash at 6/30/21 no? Isn’t that more than enough for the two acquisitions ? Plus they have long term investments of say $700-800 million which is largely the GOAT investment. So we are looking at say $2.6 billion between the cash and investments and no debt at 6/30/21. Plus the company probably earned a boat load in the quarter ending today no? School season, people exercising in the summer? I’d think the CEO saw the 20 point drop in the stock as a buying opportunity. I would hope he sees it this way. Hopefully GPS sees it that way too. Does BAC analyst think he or she is the first person to figure out the NKE issues affect FL? Genius! To think this analyst get paid nearly $1 million a year plus restricted stock. Pathetic. Happy to see them hit the stock today on old news. Bought more and hopefully it gets hit more so I can keep buying. The BBBY news should affect FL at all. Shouldn’t affect GPS either. Totally different businesses. FL should probably take on debt at a few percent interest before taxes to buy back stock. Why not?"
Retail is not dead. People still like to try on shoes before buying them. I also found more reliability and better prices than mail order.
"OMG, i’m about to break even after almost 3 months "
"Just another opportunity to buy, i don’t see it going below $40 & definitely see it at $50+ in the next coming month! #earnings Q2"
Nike reduced full year guidance due to supply chains.FL and DKS will deflate next 12 months.
Stock pushed down hard without any solid reason. Share price recovery is overdue.
why are they not showing the upgrade today to buy?
"Her is my rational for buying at 46.19...may go lower because of mc's but I don't think by much...As of August 4, 2018, the Company's merchandise inventories were $1,254 million, 2.8 percent lower than at the end of the second quarter last year. Using constant currencies, inventory decreased 2.4 percent. The Company's cash totaled $950 million, while the debt on its balance sheet was $124 million. The Company repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for $93 million during the quarter and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.345 per share, spending $40 millionGood luck"
Goldman Sachs initiated Nike as Buy this morning. It should be good for FL too.
"Same thing that happened to $DBX earnings was echoed by $FL today. It boggles my mind how well a company can do and just because street expectations are exorbitantly high, the market sells off https://yourstockmarkettoday.tumblr.com/post/177341035292/earnings-season-continues-to-surprise-new-market"
https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=2644040&headline=FL-Deutsche-sees-sustained-momentum-for-Foot-Locker-upgrades-to-Buy
Gotta wait the 3 day rule hopefully some buyers tomorrow
We should steadily gain back and see close to $50.00 in the coming weeks.
they delivered top line results
It will go up $60 by end of the day as in 30 min transaction 4.6 M more than daily avg. 3.2M
See if they can get a close above $50
My sixth sense kicked in a week ago when I doubled my position. This stock is going up at the end of this week.
Let's close above $50.00!
$38 - $40 tommorow
why still going down?
"If you really think about it *rationally*, $TGT at 54 and even at 57 is a buy. Perhaps not a 'screaming buy' but definitely a buy. The risk is fairly low and yet somehow the sentiment brought it down 10% on earnings that were above expectations and guidance that was close to neutral. If you want to short retail, why not short $FL? It is amazing that $FL is up some 25% yet guidance is down. They see Q4 EPS down 15-25% y/y implying $1.03-1.16 vs $1.18 consensus."
60 in print by Friday
"Is this a good entry point? Figured they would do great after Nike, but didn’t get in. This drop seems overdone. Haven’t looked at this board sorry if this has already been asked a dozen times."
Make that FIVE new BUY upgrades today. Add in another from Mitch Kummetz from Pivotal Research and price Target $64.00. Hold and add at this level. Going higher.
"I seriously doubt that Foot Locker is the primarily beneficiary of an increase in sales for NKE in North America. FL's earnings and guidance did not lend itself to that belief, so I think the analyst who came out with this info is mistaken. I'm not short the stock, I just think this is nothing more than short covering today."
earnings estimates at 1.75 billion to 1.82 billion eps 75cents to 80 cents.... if they xan report 1.85 billion and beat by 2 cents going into the holidays and the strongest of all quarters with back to school buying also i will take tge chance long on this
"Enough is enough, who ever is selling now is just looking at stock and is panicky. Oversold, looking to get out then wait til next week as it bounced off these oversold earnings. Should go to 50 by end of next week. No reason for anymore panic selling as your too late for that."
12k profit ...I'm out to see $45 again. Is it true the dividend was cut?
looks good - increased revenue and net incomehttps://www.footlocker-inc.com/ns/pdfs/2018/Q2-2018-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL.pdf
$NIO $FL $HMHC $AAPL Why sell today when you could sell higher tomorrow? I would buy more instead .
This plunge reflects as if they missed Revenue and Earnings! It was a huge beat .20. BS on comp sales
This stock will reach 45 bucks a share after earnings. HUGE BEAT!!!
Do we see 60 in the morning?
32.60 already
"unemployment continue improving,that's good news for FL,so FL can continue raise to history high."
NAFTA Good for trade
looks like a 20% to 30%
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/riata-capital-group-announces-closing-143000158.html this is clearly what the bond issuance is for.
"Based on past trade patterns during Q1 and Q2, FL will likely to gap down or trade down 1.60 to 3 points lower. Most likely 3 points lower since this was only a 3 cents beat on EPS, not a 5 cents nor 20 cents beat in Q2 and Q1. Plus, Q4 and 2018 full year guidance were unimpressive. See ya back in the 50 and below."
"As predicted, FL stock up after quarter result!"
"I trust the price action. I've traded long enough to know, that if the earnings weren't good we'd have saw a lot of stock being offloaded today. Insider knowledge is a reality which goes on. It didn't happen here. The stock went up in price. Think about it. ;-)"
I have been enjoying learning to trade stocks like the live. I really feel like it is the best way to learn. They share screens and announce entry and exit points real time. Pretty cool https://livetradingcourse.training/t9957
Stock will take off after raised guidance announced.
"excluding about covid 19 disaster things, FL sales growth better than anyone,"
"Analyst Robert Ohmes lifted his rating on Foot Locker (ticker: FL) to Buy from Underperform and more than doubled his price target, to $50 from $20, writing that “momentum has improved significantly” for the footwear retailer."
Low price to earnings.Low debt.buying shares.
good deal for FL. BTS looks better than ever. Stock is cheap and will rise into the 80's

"I'm sorry but I just had to do it. Up over $8.00 today....I just had to sell at 40.161. I'm trying to limit my short term capital gains but --- I couldn't resist on taking that profit.""Nov 17 (Reuters) - Shares of sports retailers soared on better-than-expected earnings from Foot Locker Inc, Shoe Carnival Inc and Hibbett Sports Inc as the companies sold more premium shoes and cut stocks of low-margin ones.Shares of the retailers jumped 19-22 percent in premarket trading. Foot Locker was the most actively traded among stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange.Brokerages Jefferies raised price target on Shoe Carnival's shares by $2 to $22 and Wedbush to $27 on expectations of better performance in 2018."""

Lorraine Hutchinson of BOFA has no idea what she is talking about. I have had 10+ years of dealing with FL and have more respect for them than ANY OTHER retailer I know. Makes me wonder about her motives.
How big of an earnings beat do we need to beat a sell off? Thoughts?
"FL just might win the title of most unfairly punished stock of the year, smh....Good grief"
Are we starting to turn around? : )

$53 breakout 6.5% move higher expected
35 low 45 high before new year
I'm re buying the shares I sold at 30.95 under 28
"for the last two weeks, analysis at CNBC has been saying buy Foot Locker...buy buy buy let Jim Crammer say it, like he did last week also. Now, they're not saying nothing. they have been wrong a lot lately."
Looks like they want to take it lower. Anyone buying before earnings on Friday?
look for $62 $65 tommorow
Pretty solid profitable results. It is just hilarious that folks sell this stock down.
"Not a solid report, but that is to be expected. With the rally this week, today's decline is still around Monday's level. Disappointed to see a dividend suspension. BUT, if you look at the typical stock performance after a dividend cut it is superior to the market, so a mixed bag."
Hopefully it will get rewarded a little bit on Mondays for decent earnings it wasn’t altogether bad but that didn’t reflect in the stock price
"Never had a position in FL, long or short, but this was the easiest buy I've had in a while. Bought shares at $38.19 and then scooped up some February $45 Call options for 80 cents each. I'd like to thank the shorts for trying to make a solid earnings report look like some apocalyptic event. Awesome price on this!"
"This is a great trade in my opinion. The stock was the number one stock down in the S & P 500 today on earnings that really were not that bad, you know a lot of people were looking at this and looking at a swing trade opportunity."
with funds adding to long term positions and new buyers it just gives it more support
It really amazes me how cheap this company is trading for... I just bought some more shares... They have almost 1 b in cash onli 100m debt and its market cap is 2.5b now... In normal condition the make 500m per year so is like a 20% yild. Some is there some bear arround? I need some cons. so I don't buy to many shares
September $50 BUCKS calls
Anyone on the CC?
Inventory is way up in preparation to crush Holiday Sales
I guess this FL bond issuance is to buy back stock at some point? Single digit P/E buybacks using after tax interest expense debt for funding certainly makes cents
Any reason for this drop ?
Between the Tarrifs and the earnings miss we could drop a bit. I will scoop some up when the time is right. Until then I am beating the market with small caps https://smallcapmarket.watch/7bpg7
Massive beat and dividend is back eps of 71 cents
"nice try Jeff... the dividends were not cut, but raised! $0.345 per sharehttp://www.footlocker-inc.com/ns/pdfs/2018/3Q18-Dividend-Release-FINAL.pdf"

tomorrow we surge this company online sales should have sustained even the store closures
"Great earnings, congrats to fellow longs. It is still trading around 8.5 P/E with new earnings factored in, crazy low for a company with international reach, no net debt, plenty of cash and good connection to younger audience"
anyone care to guess where the price goes from here next week?
$55 Call Strikes heavy action
Strong over reaction... Wait for it.
Let's get a nice recovery this last hour of trading!!
"Bought more of this last week and today. Not a bad earnings report yet almost all of Friday's rally is offset today. I'm not a technician, but this is probably not a great stock from a technical perspective. Still, the management seems to be more than competent and working hard to make sure that this isn't another Gamestop, so it might be one of the better values even in a market that now has quite a few values"
Raymond James just gave FL a $70 target price. Thats great news ahead of a great earnings report!
Its the holiday season with peak selling of products. How is it the share price is going down? Based on what?
One of the only retail stocks fairly valued. Most are now overvalued/overbought.
What happen today?
In it to win it. Just made my calls!
"In a recent update on second-quarter fiscal 2020, management highlighted the huge response to the company’s assortment as stores started reopening. This could be attributed to pent-up demand and the effect of the fiscal stimulus that aided in-store sales and drove continued momentum across the digital channel. Notably, comparable-store sales jumped nearly 18% for second-quarter fiscal 2020.Management further cited that significant sales coupled with disciplined cost control aided the company to revert to positive earnings per share despite gross margin being stressed by a channel mix shift and elevated promotional backdrop. Apparently, management envisions adjusted earnings per share in the range of 66-70 cents for the quarter ended Aug 1.Including pre-tax charges of about $19 million associated with winding down of the Runners Point banner and the restructuring of Eastbay, as well as costs of $18 million incurred for the social unrest, earnings per share are likely to fall in the band of 38-42 cents per share compared with 55 cents recorded in the year-ago period."
Something is going on. Maybe bad news. Soon we will know why FL is in the past 2 days crashing down like crazy

I doubled down @ 46.
Dividend is reinstated. Nice.
I have been watching $FL.V for quite some time. This recent downtrend presents an excellent buying opportunity. I also suggest having a look at Azincourt Energy. Uranium/lithium play currently awaiting drill results from one of the top uranium locations in the world.
Still pricy!
Wow look at the volume This could turn around
this has very high potential to double in 2 quarters
Nice move up on Friday!
Only people buying this morning are shorts. Earnings great but revenue flat. Gap up will get filled but after it is filled.
Buy and hold for Christmas.
Cant wait to add more cheap shares in about a week or so before this goes back to normal
Does anyone know what percentage of GOAT foot locker owns? Obviously a great decision by FL management to invest $100 million in the company back in early 2019
"This is in my opinion well overdone, my entry was around 48 (sell them when you can not when you have to..) but I am holding still, it matters how it closes and what happens on Monday...though vol is huge to the down side and it violated many technical supports....let's wait and see"
Strong buy
Just bought on the upgrade news. It’s been upgraded for another 20% with new target being 56. Am going to hold.
Guys Check $60 Call Strikes heavy action
I checked in to see what the deal was on FL having such a big down day on what is otherwise a strong rally? But have to cycle through a ton of spambot junk. Mods really need to watch these boards better
Bug big day for all my brothers and sisters! Cant wait for the EPS and Revenue beats tomorrow! Hope it doesnt go the way of $FL for me after those big beats. I think the difference will be FOOTLOCKER was at 52 week high already so sold off. Hopefully my theory will be correct and this will continue up to reclaim the 52 week high and finish those shorts off!
"2000@48, this is a steal, supply chain disrupt is temporary"
75 cents beats .70 concensus earnings beat
DID FOOT LOCKER COOK THE BOOKS. Were the earnings too good to be true. Read the article and judge for yourself. https://berryrecorder.com/can-foot-locker-inc-nysefl-return-what-investors-are-looking-for/328169
"The smartest man in stocks (aka Warren Buffett) said, a dip in a stock you believe should make you buy more not sell what you own! Thats why i just bought another 100k !!!"
Tomorrow can easily touch 50...
"Same-store sales increased about 18% for the three months ended Aug. 1, the New York-based company said Monday in a statement discussing preliminary results for the quarter. Diluted earnings will likely be 38 cents to 42 cents a share. Analysts had expected an adjusted loss of 61 cents a share, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg, along with a decline in total revenue."
Is anyone buying calls on footlocker before earnings?
Very strong earnings results. Analysts underestimate this stock by a mile or more.
Well that sold off quick. We already lost $3 from the pre-market highs
Would'nt the Dividend raise show investors that this company is real and gonna have a killer Q4? I mean .40 cents for a dividend under $40 is pretty solid right? A year ago today this stock was at $60 and the sneaker game has only boomed even more IMO.
"So here is my investment thesis: we need new shoes and it is one of the few things that I don’t like to buy online. And the PE and PEG ratios are amazingly low. Good luck longs,"

"Are they gonna account stolen looted shoes in sales? If so, to the MOON "

"Going to be a great one to watch today, when the market opens. Looking at Zack's predictions for the next earnings things are going to get even better. They will of course review their estimate now and it will be higher still. I believe strongly that this stock will be around $60 again in 2018."
An outstanding buy at this level. No brainer.
"Short Squeeze is coming, they are beginning to panic to the point of lying."
when market red recovers it will push us higher as the stock is positive on report
The clue is in the stock price. This is going to be $40+ tomorrow. Some good news and back up she goes. Bear in mind that this stock fell a long way in August. It's all up from here. BUY!
Upgraded to Buy at BofA. Price target $50.
"covid19 new cases STRONG down, people go out more need buy more clothes and shoes, so buy FL will make huge money, because it's stock price too low, FL reasonable price is $56 now, and it's more room to growth, FL reach $125 in winter, because shoes demand very strong."
