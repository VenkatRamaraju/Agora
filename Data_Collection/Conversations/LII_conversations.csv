"in my opinion, the management is not focused, they lost control of inventory which has led to the inability to complete upflow resedential furnaces. They are out of stock on residential furnaces for over 30 days. That is poor management."
"Why is Todd Teske on the BOD of Lennox? In his last position at Briggs & Stratton he held 3 titles at the same time. President, CEO and Chairman of the Board. NOT good corporate governance and it showed. Under Teske's watch the 100 plus yr old company, once a leader in its industry was thrust into bankruptcy. Just prior to filing for bankruptcy The Board under Tekse's watch defaulted on $6.7 million interest payment and opted instead to award himself and a few friends $5 million in bonuses. They failed to adequately fund the pension plan for years. The DAY before filing for bankruptcy the board voted to terminate the health insurance of it's retirees. They left creditors with pennies on the dollar, stiffed their vendors and shareholders were left with nothing. I fail to see what he has offer other than showing the board how to enrichen themselves at the expense of shareholders, employees, lenders and vendors. IMO he should be sitting in a jail cell not on the BOD of Lennox."

"I work in Hvac and I can tell you, we get more work now and in the future, because of the virus. We will have to make adjustments to our instalations and hvac will be more important than ever before. I dont have shares yet because they are too expensive right now. but I think it will be a good buy"

"This is just plain and simply a very well run company with great results in a great market sector, whether it is new home builds or replacement after market sales, they are definitely a best in class. I have owned UTX, IR and JCI in the past and in my opinion this seemingly low flying company beats them all every quarter, surprised there isn't more commenting on this board."
