Not going to lie this has moved up quite nicely from the split. It almost wonder if they will consider another split late this year or early next year. I only see revenues and earnings going up

Nice dividend increase. I said it below but will say it again they are becoming the leader in Florida of storage. Every where I go and I travel a lot around the state they are popping up like 7-11'sThis is a core holding for me

"Is this thing a turd or what?? I feel like dumping and not look back, however, most times I do that, in hind sight, I should have doubled down. Yet every day that goes by, I keep saying to myself ""should have sold yesterday"". Always seems once I've had enough and sell, the following day it rebounds. Almost as if the stock knows."
What gives with LSI today? Market opens up 200 plus points and LSI down 2+%. No earnings release or other news I see.

Can someone explain the long term chart? Looks like these super dips and then super surges -- from high down to next to nothing. What causes those plunges and volitility?

So the dividend stayed the same despite the 3/2 split increasing the share count. That bodes well. I am in Florida and they are expanding here. Seeing new ones popping up

"Cheap pric,e that why the split"
"First let me say that I am a long-term dividend investor and that I bought this stock back when they owned under 100 Uncle Bob's SS outlets. At current prices this a screaming buy with a dividend yield of 5.3%. I just love being paid while I wait. Remember they have been paying a generous dividend for well over 20 years. And nobody in top management draws a salary in excess of $700,000 plus they all own substantial shares. They seem to me to know what they are doing. They may have over-extended themselves somewhat with purchase of Life Storage, but I think this move will pay off big time down the road. The key to successful investing is discipline and patience."
