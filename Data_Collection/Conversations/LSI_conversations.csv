"First let me say that I am a long-term dividend investor and that I bought this stock back when they owned under 100 Uncle Bob's SS outlets. At current prices this a screaming buy with a dividend yield of 5.3%. I just love being paid while I wait. Remember they have been paying a generous dividend for well over 20 years. And nobody in top management draws a salary in excess of $700,000 plus they all own substantial shares. They seem to me to know what they are doing. They may have over-extended themselves somewhat with purchase of Life Storage, but I think this move will pay off big time down the road. The key to successful investing is discipline and patience."

So the dividend stayed the same despite the 3/2 split increasing the share count. That bodes well. I am in Florida and they are expanding here. Seeing new ones popping up

Not going to lie this has moved up quite nicely from the split. It almost wonder if they will consider another split late this year or early next year. I only see revenues and earnings going up
