I have been adding to my position on every drop.
anyone have any insight insight into why the reits are falling these days? divi is solid?
great divi as usual!!!
I bought the dip on Friday. Good opportunity to get in at this price.
"Barry = Oh Yeaaaaaahhhhh Brother!, for your portfolio"
Thanks for the fat divy Barry.
dividend payout today
Sternlicht told the media he was buying certain cheap REITs in March 2020 apart from a few million in STWD. Wasn't able to figure out what these were via 13f filings. Anyone?
Any thoughts as to why a 1.5% pullback?
"Barry makes your portfolio go…Uhhhh double up, uhhh uhhh"
It's dividend run-up time for STWD! Starwood is up 1.83% to $25.86 (9/27/21 @ 10.10 am EST).
"Shhhh, Don’t tell anybody they collected 99% of interest paid in April. Let’s also keep it quiet that 95% of rents were paid in April— while we continue to scoop up shares at fire sale prices. We probably should not mention that only 2% of their portfolio is exposed to retail and that although they have 12% exposure to hotels, very little of that is in big box convention properties. A substantial percentage of the hotel exposure is in the low end market which is reporting 80% occupancy, but let’s keep between us for now."
green today would be fun....
Barry is the single greatest RE operator of all time. If you aren't buying this into a rising interest rate environment then you can Sternlicht maballs brohams!
I have yuge beef and this stock is going to $30 when Barry flops his juicy dogan on the table during the earnings call
Im assuming dividend announcement coming soon? Ex dividend end of this month paid mid September? Anyone read anything on this?
Barry’s big beef blasts bodacious bucks
Why the drop? Can't find any news.
seems like the charts keep revisiting this price area. back to pre-covid levels basically. love the dividend and mgmt.
5 years running of rock solid dividends. Should be in everyone's dividend portfolio. Thank you.
