"They are developing a precision testing for Covid-19 based on saliva samples. If successful, it will jump 20-30%."
March to $180 about to start
Will investors start to sell again like two months ago
Look like day traders play GH again and again
Best in class stocks in exploding fields are good picks. I like GH long.
Guardant Health is up 5.39% to 114.39
"The way chemotherapy is evolving based on new DNA markers, and the ""tailored approach"" is truly stunning. I have seen dramatic, profound changes in my over 20 years of practicing medicine. Esp in the last 5 years. Companies like GH, and EXAS are at the forefront of this new way of treating or diagnosing cancers. Glad to be here!"
"the next up swing will take this to $130/share; just around the corner. Institutions buying these notes are not looking into ""interest"" pay in so many years; they want cheap shares going into $150's. They will back these notes up in the public markets by pushing GH up in share price and they have the confidence in the GH technology and its served market to provide a viable path."
"Guardant Health, Inc. (Nasdaq: GH) announces that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Guardant360 CDx for tumor mutation profiling, also known as comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP), in patients with any solid malignant neoplasm (cancerous tumor). The Guardant360 CDx is also approved as a companion diagnostic to identify non-small cell lung cancer patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) alterations who may benefit from treatment with Tagrisso (osimertinib). Guardant360 CDx offers patients and clinicians a simple, faster blood test to help inform personalized treatment options.The Guardant360 CDx FDA approval was based on clinical and analytical validation data from over 5,000 samples. In a retrospective analysis of data from pivotal phase III clinical trials, FLAURA and AURA3, non-small cell lung cancer patients identified for treatment with Tagrisso (osimertinib) using the Guardant360 CDx demonstrated progression-free survival rates consistent with those identified using traditional biomarker testing. Since being introduced as a laboratory developed test (LDT), the Guardant360 liquid biopsy LDT has become widely accepted for blood-based CGP with more than 150 peer-reviewed publications.1 It has been used by more than 7,000 oncologists nationwide, and more than 150,000 Guardant360 tests have been performed to date.1 The test is broadly covered by Medicare and many private payers, representing over 170 million lives.1"
GH still leads in genetic approvals for cancer accuracy tests using a simple blood test.
"Congrats all longs. W made it over $130/share by year end and then more. We almost hit $140.We will be hovering around $120-$140 in the next few months. The next run up starts in second quarter as we get closer to FDA approvals, more data, and M&A activity picking up again. Next target is $140+30%x$140=$182/share. Sit tight! Selling or day trading GH is a mistake until we hit a market cap of $20B."
"Small volume, but in two very red days; I see upside buyers. With the learning that SB already sold and insider selling tapering down; it is time to start buying GH again. It’s heading back to $130-$140."
press release on a sunday night is rare but sounds like great news plus the JPM conference is a big deal so boost is in store tomorrow buy before 2 pm est since I expect a great presentation (presenting on monday of a big 3 day conference shows some real legitimacy about Guardent
Still holding.
held my nose and bought some at 74.85.
"This provider of oncology testing services is expected to post quarterly LOSS of $0.30 per share in its upcoming report,"
Analysts tafget is $160 to $185 as Guardant has approval for simple cancer blood tests with over 90% accuracy.
I’m happy... got in at $32.In for the long haul!
"The data gather by GH to build their bio informatics database will be just like building self driving cars. the more data GH gathers from usages daily/monthly/yearly the more accurate GH's product will be. The Machine Learning used to train with this data will cement GH as one of the leading products in the industry. For companies coming in now and claim they have better product is full of it. I don't care what any competitors do or say. I have confidence in the upper management to make the right decisions on how they enhance and build out and refine their products over time. I believe this industry is very similar to software development and that the more data you gather, the better and more accurate this product is. I don't think any company out there has GH's upper managment's track record in this industry at this point."
"Down 6 of 7 days, Down 15.72% year to date. And down 39.35% since Feb. 12, 2021….. Awful!!!!"
"$78-$80 is a golden opportunity to buy more. Depending on your patience level, this year $40 /share gain from here; if you hold through mid 2021 when Lunar-2 gets approvals, $70 /share gain; almost doubling. This is a millionaire maker stock! I am betting on it big and plan to hold through Lunar-2 approvals."
"Well, they say stocks cannot just go up. We had like 7 or 8 ups in a row, so I suppose an off day was due. Minimal damage at $0.20. Time for more green."
Artilce in cancer journal take how liquid biopsy is not even used in 50 percent of patients who could use it. Cancer docs aren’t following ASCO guidelines.
"$130 once, $130 twice, $130 trice...Bought!!Do I hear $135-$140 soon?"
"I'm in for the long haul, but ouch this week hurts!"
Hope 2 qr ER may be close to analysts estimates/targets
down on low volume.. looks like its going to test 20 SMA at $80.. some people call it stock manipulation.
"the move has started to $130, first stop"
"All that matters in this report is Q-Q, Y-o-Y revenue (not profits) growth and projections of it for the next quarter. The growth must be >20% in all those categories to move positively. Obviously any FDA news would be a catalyst for upside - which is unlikely. Otherwise, I think the bottom is reached and we will be stuck in this price range for the short term. Long term perspective has not changed a bit and management is executing to those plans."
"Wow, down into double digits, glad I sold when I did at $160."
I believe that Softbank knew what they were doing when they sold
"GH is not GME, but no one is selling here. March to $180 underway. Then, $200, then $250, then $300."
Why down so badly?
"We got spoiled yesterday as it went up past $117. Not expecting much of a reversal of fortune today. Would like to be wrong, but....."
"In a collapsing market GH went up 12.7% today. It’s sometimes hard to know what’s going on.It is likely that a good news is in the horizon, like FDA approval of the Guardant360."
Whats everyones longer term views here? I believe this could easily be $130 stock. It seems like management really knows what they are doing. Of course we will have times of selloffs which is healthy and normal but seems to be a good place to let run.
"Interesting chatter with ILMN/GRAIL. I suspect the ""potential"" anticompetitive nature of a top tier sequencing/instrumentation could have with GH and others will be taken into advisement at the FTC. On the other hand the net result of this acquisition could add fuel to the ctDNA market under the right settlement. I believe GH will come out fine in this $6B market."
Wonder when quarterly numbers are coming?
Down almost $80 in 6 months. Time for a change in direction. This daily drop siht is getting old.
something is broken here. A few weeks ago 87 felt like a bargain.
"Was able to buy 820 shares at 109 on Friday - sold just shy of $117 this morning. Still have my core long-term position from the $60s, but love trading when the opportunity arises. GLTA"
"Awesome action today. With FDA approvals coming in early 2022 and expected price jump, not a lot of opportunity left to accumulate. After a very brief pause, we will be in $120’s-$130’s. The price target at end of 2022 is over $250/share."
"Congrats again to all the longs. $158! GH is not a day trading stock. FDA approvals are coming, M&A activity will pick up. You day trade, you will be left out of a major price movement. It bounced from low $120's just a few days ago to what it is today. Imagine if you had sold your positions. Keep your shares and enjoy the ride."
this stock is a hidden gem! just keep buying before everyone finds out..
They had some interesting insights about GH on (http://Fairstox.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
glad i bought $77+ today
Give up on GH?
Great news CMS will pay for 360 test service.
"Kevin is an active member on this board and kudos to him as he somehow saw this stock trading higher when it was in the dumps earlier last month. I have sellers regret as I sold a portion of my holdings. I have held my position since the stock went public. I loved the long term potential and like Kevin this was a buying opportunity not a selling opportunity. Fortunately, I sold only a small portion BUT I still regret my move."
This company is a game changer very solid mgt as well
It's amazing but I think this is the only stock that I don't worry about. I know one day I am going to wake up and something big is going to happen.
Truly time the CEO departed and the sooner the better !!!!!
Crashing!!!!!!!
Does anyone know when the lock up expiration is? I’d love an opportunity to get in at a slightly lower price.
Looking through some data I saw that around 3.3 million shares are shorts right now. Anybody have any insight into this? Maybe the reason for the uptick yesterday? I would probably be getting nervous right now if I had sold short at current prices levels since GH has pretty much been flat the last few days and if anything it’s went up a little.
"The earning report, whenever it comes out, will only accelerate the price movement higher. They will report their adoption rate as the most important metric for the company's progress. You can bet the adoption rate will only accelerate. The price movement all depends on progress of the technology and its adoption rate."
"Got it with 3000 shares at $112, got out on 07 Sept at $132.50. Looking at the $6 slide in after hours, that deal is looking more and more like a good move."
GH is the leading genomics company with accuracies as high or higher than surgical biopsies because it uses AI. This will save the healthcare system a lot of money.
"I have been here since the IPO. It will be at $115-$120 in no time and then on its way to $150. You cannot go wrong with GH. They have revised all metrics upward every quarter. Their tools are and will become invaluable for cancer treatment, diagnosis, and eventually prevention. Overall economy, trade wars, currency wars, politics, etc. have no impact on GH. It's a sure thing. This is a buying opportunity, no doubt about it."
Revenues are growing profits will follow. GH leads the pack in cancer liquid biopsy tests and actual approvals.
Guardant Health is up 5.22% to 107.61
"GH is dead. Management doing nothing to stop the slide, insiders are selling, retail is scared. It's done."
Anyone know what happened to the COVID saliva test they were working on?
This leading edge stock with approved simple blood tests is a double from here.
SoftBank is selling their shares in GH . Guardant health is not adding any dilution to be very clear It’s good that softie is exiting so we are better for longer term
Company going bankrupt….
"As I said, $105 is a very firm bottom due to Friday and Monday actions"
Not to rain on the parade because I’m long too but does anybody know just exactly how much of the 30 percent ownership of GH by Softbank was liquidated in the past couple of months? Great numbers and no doubt an up and comer but if Softbank continues to sell what remains of their stake isn’t the stock probably going to remain in the lower end of the trading range we’ve seen the last couple months? Remember last quarter? Great numbers and huge bounce but was short lived. Comments? Insight?
It’s funny I wrote earlier in the day for Medicare expansion news and it came in afternoon . Now let’s see strong hands come in next week.
big sell off by ceo on aug 13 hasn't affected anything
"New to this thread.I don't have any money in this company but have been following for almost two years. I see nobody noticed the biggest change in this company.CEO Nall did what good CEOs do, found where the company was week and fixed it.Last Sept he hired Edwin Hedrick as CCO.That was start of the turn around for this company.Edwin brought in a new VP sales and VP marketing; his old team. Bye the way his last two companys got bought out.1q 19 was there first full quaters.Here's the revenue numbers:1q/4q 2018. ^ 19%2q/1q. ^16%3q/2q ^28% amazingYear to date revenues are up 50%At this rate they could be cash positive by 4q 20or if they keep up 28%+ q/q3q 20Along with the expansion of products this company can be as $GH. I may have to buy in soon to this young company.Day to day trading doesn't matter it's the quarter on quarter revenue numbers that will turn this stock around. They might have to raise money one more time this next year but should be a non dilutive loan, hopefully for you guys..Just my opinion, the numbers don't lie HAPPY THANKSGIVING"
"Markets have rallied back, NEO's pop has fizzled out and GH still falling. Guess it'll take a while for the dust to settle."
What’s today’s excuse for hovering near $100 on the way down to????
"The sell off with such a large volume and the subsequent day, yesterday, however, were important events as it established a very firm bottom at $105 for GH. Barring any extraordinary event, it is up from here."
I love ten percent up days!
"was a nice run , now we have to see how many sell after the lockup date"
So how much do you guys think it may pull back to. Have 500 stocks averaged to $90 which I want to keep for long run. Looking to buy more
"Don't expect miracle for GH, like I told you guys before it will back and and forth for GH at least through October. The best thing that can happen with GH is for a big pharma to offer them the magic $170 per share that the two boys are looking for at this time. Eight months ago, things were different but now you can tell the level of competence at all the areas of this organization is just not there.You can still keep this stock but don't expect miracle...The SWAV on the other hand, has a great team and I can tell you that my estimate for this company now is $250 in six months. I am sure those insiders will give me the thumbs down but I know them better!!"
a few 13g filings by morgan stanley and venture capitalists - these folks are investing big
"2021 GuidanceGuardant Health expects full year 2021 revenue to be in the range of $360 million to $370 million, representing 26% to 29% growth over full year 2020. Clinical volumes for 2021 are expected to be greater than 90,000 tests, growing at least 42% over 2020."
"Wow, green AND over $100. How can you stand it?"
$EXAS and $GH both trading at 87 ... today marks the beginning of the 1 year challenge between the two. My bet is on $GH to see gains of at least 50% ... $EXAS will lag
Why has this stock crashed???
"The management donot know how to grow business.. just watch how many times shares offered, very high expending and expenses and management payments and bonuses! Not good!"
"Let's see if this break over $80 can stick. A bit worried about the valuation of the overall markets, but if things hang in there, and earnings are as good as I think they will be, we could see new highs in the next few months."
"There are already several liquid biopsy companies, so I am not sure the current high price tag is justified here and if there is a room to grow. Current revenue less than 300M and market cap above 11B!! What's the thesis for long here?"
60% off the highs despite good progress on revenues in each segment. It has been painful to watch last 6 months but as long term long thinking about buying more……I have been putting everything available into Pfizer and still see more upside there but this is tempting. Don’t like the co-CEO structure never works unless someone buys and integrates them. Pfizer with all their vaccine cash?
lift off?! monthly chart very constructive
"$130 before year end. All stars are lined up. 2021 is the year that FDA approvals will trickle in. We go into one after hour, about 4:30pm when an announcement shows up with an approval or an acquisition and the next morning GH will be trading in $160's. You will miss it. Buy and hold. Don't day trade this stock."
"""Guardant Health to Develop Liquid Biopsy CDx for Amgen."" It's happening! GH soon to be acquired."
"$130’s, as I mentioned a while ago, is coming. Buying on the green side continues regardless of overall market direction. Accumulate now in preparation for FDA approvals. Further, Grail and Illumina situation has increased chances of acquisition now."
"100k volume at closing. This is none of you and me! In three very red sessions, GH had good upside buying despite slight decline in price. Buying on the upside has started. Tighten seat belts, GH is taking off!"
GH has taken the lead in approvals for cancer detection using liquid biopsies and it is not stuck with obsolete expensive stool tests like Cologuard.
Expecting another very strong quarter
* Guardant Health Inc : JP Morgan raises target price to $185 from $180
in Uday and Qusay we Trust. LOL
ready to bounce back to $170 and this time it will go to $200. Classic chart and technical formation.
"Guardant is more advanced in genetic testing for cancer with more approvals and accuracy now using artificial intelligence. Natera, NTRA, is up over $3.00 today in a similar business but not as advanced as GH. Guardant is focussed on profits and accuracy and even exited a emergency use Covid test, Guardant 19, when it could not be profitable. Others, like EXAS, are carrying uncompetitive obsolete products."
"Another after hours try for manipulation by a rather poor retailer. Someone sold two shares at $110. Check it out at Nasdaq after hours site.After Hours Time (ET) After Hours Price After Hours Share Volume19:43:14 $110 217:29:32 $121.1 2,73516:24:03 $121.1 15016:15:17 $121.5 20816:12:32 $121.1 48"
"Both $EXAS and $NTRA came up on upside buying; especially EXAS, on decent volume too."
Very disappointed
What’s happy pre down $7.00
This stock is being manipulated….
While analysts recommend a buy Why big drop ?
"Complete knee jerk reaction to the news since it is not confirmed, assuming it is true, no one knows how much premium they would pay for Neo. Thus a 16% drop makes no sense other than just an initial reaction. Assume they pay no premium, then it's net net neutral since they add valuation to the company while assuming debt. Neo has positive EPS, so, in fact it would be accretive to their business - then share price of the combined company should rise not go down - if no premium paid.Long term it is a good play against Grail /Illumina. But they must show the ability to execute the assumed synergies if they do acquire them. That is the risk."
Guardant already has the approvals for multi cancer diagnoses using a simple blood test and AI. The obly thing it could add would be something like NVTR which is also cutting edge.
What is going on????
"04:14 PM EDT, 08/23/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Connect Biopharma (CNTB) said Monday that it appointed Jiang Bian general counsel and chief compliance officer, effective Aug. 20.Bian was most recently senior counsel of Guardant Health (GH)."
"I thought SoftBank was done with GH, but apparently not. Still selling shares. When do we get rid of SB completely? This is the third time that SB has screwed GH."
Insider selling.
I thought GH reported today but on my Fidelity account it says March 11. Another month of waiting! Maybe I’ll buy a few more shares in the meantime.
Management is not aware of their impact. A piece of news; an article will move this by $10 right now
Also this entire sector is out of favor right now. NTRA and EXAS are suffering the same faith.
"Despite pretty severe market movements, GH is holding very well."
"It’s political. As the politicians are jawboning for Medicare for all. Thus, General weakness on healthcare stocks vs SP500 index. Not something GH needs to be concerned with. As I stated previously, GH will range between 50-100 bucks for the next 2-3 years. GH’s sales needs to catch the stock price."
"As a long-term holder, just after the IPO, frankly I'm displeased with management. Obviously the growth trajectory has lowered which is concerning. Of course I understand that too fast of growth could be a near-disaster for lab operations, but that's why we have competent managers to streamline the work flow.Another recent development is the dual-CEO's. I just don't get why and how this works/The fact that SoftBank and ACK Genomics have dumped most or completely adds to my concern.I'm considering to lessening my investment and wait on the sidelines for now."
Movin and shakin'
"A lot of people are afraid because the lock up period expires tomorrow. That expiration will allow insiders to sell some of their stocks, if they choose to, causing the stock to drop. Also, today an analyst downgraded the stock to “ sell.” These fluctuations are normal for companies with these characteristics. Otherwise, no news, no change in the fundamentals. For a guerrilla company with rule breaking attributes these wild swings are normal: the same way it was going 10% up in several days, it can also do the reverse. The key is NOT TO GET CAUGHT UP in these oscillation and have strong steady hands, if you believe in the approach, product, and the management."
"Soft Bank sale of their equity is completed. It was priced at $102. So, now that it is over, we are heading back up."
up 2% after ER.

What a difference a day makes!!
"This company has revenue, but not profit. What's the story on that? Where does the revenue go and how is the current valuation justified? Thanks."
"In April, Guardant360 was added as a covered benefit for the members of the health plans associated with eviCore. This test will be considered medically necessary to assist in selecting therapy for patients with advanced lung cancer. As a result, Guardant360 will have added coverage for more than 38 million lives. The company is thus seeing significant increases in Guardant360 coverage in advanced non-small cell lung cancer and also making progress in expanding coverage to other tumor types. We expect the company to provide an update on it during the second-quarter 2019 earnings call."
"For those of you who want to invest in this company long term, this is a good entry point at $110."
Good news Golden Sachs recommended GH
"check for at least a few of days of ""upside"" buying; then this may become an opportunity for a $20 upside movement; otherwise, no reason to engage on GH at this point."
close in green today
"Hard to believe it’s dropped below 87. But I bought with a 3-5 year horizon, and fully aware of some legal issues and FDA pending approvals coming this Fall. I’m anticipating significant growth over next few years, and am positioned long, accordingly! I believe they will pass through these relatively overinflated hurdles, and come out this winter with the stellar growth they have already demonstrated. Patience rewards the long investor!"
"Uncanny strength since lock-up expiration and secondary, especially considering the overall trouncing most stocks have suffered lately."
Talk about a management juicing its shareholders to the bone - they do an equity offering every month. Best way to lose the trust of investors.
now under 150 you can buy again is safe ..but next time listen when i tell you to short
Sell at $131 or hold?
continues the climb despite sea of red everywhere else. There are certainly buyers.
Great action today. Two large volume sales on downside; the stock price continued upward trend regardless. $130 coming.
sub $104 seems like a decent place to initiate another trading position.
It is extremely important to have a strong balance sheet in this environment. 3% dilution is nothing. Getting rid of the Softbank overhang is a plus. Having cash to fund development is even better.
I am long the stock since the IPO but please please be aware that the pending lockup expiration occurs in April which allows insiders to sell. I normally buy stocks and hold them for years so I don’t really care but those buying on the hype today needs to be careful. Just saying
"Congrats to longs here. I sold all my GH in order to create a better retirement portfolio, and that is doing well, but GH and EXAS have been making waves. A little sorry I sold when I did few months ago! But this sector is truly important to the future of healthcare! I will jump back in someday, when the timing is right! And good luck Lipstick, you seem to be winning the GH/EXAS bet! But in the long run, I think both companies are leaders!"
"Get ready for $97 a share in a couple of weeks. If Covid testing shows signs of accuracy and they report preliminary results, expect $110 a share. I cannot imagine why their Covid testing wouldn't work. Much easier than a swab test (GH is saliva based) and their algorithms have shown incredible signal-to-noise ratio for cancer, piece of cake to detect Covid virus which is in plenty in saliva."
Manipulation
$128. Getting close to $130
"The CEO only sold 90,000 shares : CEO of Guardant Health Inc (GH) Helmy Eltoukhy sold 90,000 shares of GH on 04/22/2019 at an average price of $65.28 a share. The total sale was $5.9 million. Let's get our facts straight William"
"Great technology; insurances will start covering the tests; Guardant360 is very accurate that making it great products for cancer treatment and clinical trials. Enormous potential, I am long and very optimistic."
Nice to see my recent purchase no longer under water! At least not much!
Charts indicate GH will be back at $119.00 very soon. No other company has as many cancer tests that are actually approved using only a blood test.
"They must show revenue growth. I don't care about losses as long as there is revenue growth. But, it's been anemic from one quarter to the next - it must be >25% and it is not. There is no catalyst in the short term to move the price higher. Longs will have to stay long until next FDA approval and large adoption rate of current products. No, it will not disappear; the long term promise is as intact as ever."
"Some of the posts remind me when I was in Wayfair. Stock was in the 80s after coming down hard from $114 range. I was in around $93. So much doom and gloom, within 3 months stock was over $160. Good companies most of the time will come back strong and then takeoff from my long time experience. This is a volatile stock but has Huge potential. I would guess 2 months from now the mood here could be quite different. Ive seen this happen endless times in my trading career."
"AGLC open for business. Alberta open for business. I think Gamehost earnings will surprise to the upside over next 24 months. Then bake in their share buybacks and cost reductions, even lower corporate tax; you get recipe for strong upside after velocity of gross revenues and their EBITDA take hold. $12 may be the new baseline for these shares on the TSX. $GH"
"Good luck to all longs on earnings report,"
"SWAV. is making me retire quickly....I love it and I hope those of you that listened to me are enjoying the fruits of your labor!!...As for GH, they need to hire right people to do the job and enough with friends and family."
"When I said it $15/share is left in this stock to gain, it was down $22/share. Now, $16/share...already gained $6/share! Mark my word, it will be in $120's in no time."
are we going to see $120 before this session ends?
Last chance to buy under $100
steady everyone; $120's will be captured again. Then earnings report. They need to show growth in top line revenue; no need for profits to go crazy. Just decent top line revenue growth. IF they show anything over 15% QoQ growth on top line revenue; we will see $150's by year end.
I hear $140’s.
Going under…..
Down 35% in 6 months
Looking strong going in to earnings!
"What were they thinking? Now everyone knows that the management team are great at technicals but obviously lame for building a business. Additionally, the Co-CEO roles are over the top in this fiasco."
Anyone know what is Guardant-19 ? Company asked FDA to pull off emergency usage on Monday . Hence stock is dropping
How about a class action lawsuit!!!!!!
"Under the radar, great company with a very long runway. Quietly heading to $200."
"This drop maybe, only maybe, related to a drop in a number of cancer therapy companies related to Allogen failing FDA approval for its cancer drug. Whether GH works with Allogen to develop cancer drugs; I have no idea."
"A unique growth company, specializing in the toxic cancerous environment of helping people lose money."
GH is leading the pack for simple genetic blood tests rather than obsolete expensive stool tests like Cologuard.
Good action today despite small price movement. But no big chunk upside buys yet. Keep monitoring.
GH is officially dead in the short term. Relentless downside selling for the past three months.
Wow $124.7
It moves such high % up and down on small volume; GH can be manipulated by anyone. It does not help that insiders are still selling; which shows lack of trust in management.
GH is Tesla of LB All others are trying to play catch up to compete with them Value will be seen in couple years
Market cap is still pretty low compared to others in the sector. Let’s not lose our cool here. ILMN market cap is much larger over 40 billion - GH still has lots of room to run IMO.
Really surprised that there have been no downgrades. Not sure how low this is going but will be buying at the right price.
executives and board members are out of their black out period; they are selling. I see large chunks being traded.
GH is overvalued by about 23%. Why? Do the math to calculate PSG = p/s divided by revenue growth rate.As of today august 5 the market cap is 11.6 billion. 2021 revenue expected to be $360m. The forward p/s is therefore about 32. Divide the p/s=32 by revenue growth rate of 26% and you end up with PSG = 1.23 which indicates GH at $115 is overvalued by at the minimum 23% hence making it a good stock to buy under $89/shr in order for PSG to be at 1 or ideally below 1.
Congratulations to patient Longs!! GH came out triumphant with the quarterly results. The sky is the limit now. Good news on all cylinders!
"And still it continues down? Anyone with any thoughts on WHY ? ThxTotal revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $54.0 million, a 178% increase over the second quarter of 2018"
"Today was a good day for me. Added another 1000 shares at 92.25, and GH is 92.45 as if this posting. $2,200 profit in an hour is not bad. Although I am a long term investor, I couldn’t resist buying at 92.25 since I’ve noticed over days that GH goes down temporarily, but doesn’t stay down for long, so I let’s take advantage of this trend."

"According to Bloomberg, deal NOT happening."
"my GH partners....I am sharing this as it looks to be a good sign. My background is in technicals and charting....the MACD is just starting to turn positive....I would expect in the coming days, assuming headline Trade news, doesn't impede normal progress...which is a thorn in the side everyday.....we should start the accumulation phase as we have been basing for the past 9 days.Stay tuned"
$120-$130 coming. Lots of upside buying in the past few days.FDA approvals in March 2022. That is only 2.5 quarters away!Price target in 2022; north of $250/share.
We were accepted by Medicare for a coverage expansion. Big news! We should run up on this.
GH is up 9%. Anyone knows if there is any news ?
Patience has paid off. I think another few years of patience is worth it!
up 5 -1/2% and no buddy is saying anything?
What triggered this sell off?
"Trying to manipulate this stock, you need to buy and sell over 5,000 shares. 2 shares won't do!! Haha."
What’s happening? Inside / investors bigger sell off?
"@Kevin...the reason Insiders are selling is that they Junta (top echelons and friends & Family) has boat load of options and everyone and their Unqualified mother is getting stock option. This place is run like Afghanistan and needs a Big Pharma to move in. Sadly before that happens, they need at least 15% to 20% cut in staff to clear out the dead woods....but again that means you will #$%$ of the family members."
Whats with the rise today?
Another horrendous day on small volume. No major buyer; all retail and insiders selling on the downside. There seems no bottom and GH’s management is hopeless.
2021 guidance 360 to 370 million 30 percent increase over 2020. 90000 test expected to be completed. GROWING !!!!
Support at $85 area...probably going there soon
Terrible action
"Buy, 125-130 near term target"
Could be the best stock of all time. Covid 19 will make shareholders wealthier than Oprah
"Stellar earnings call. This is a growth company, not a revenue company at this stage of their development as a company. It's like expecting Amazon to show robust bottom line profits when they were growing so fast. Never happened, no one expected. Awesome report. Their technology is growing in complexity, applications, and demand. Cannot ask for more."
Nice to see us walking away from the 60s!
"Someone tried unsuccessfully to manipulate the stock price premarket by selling few shares at very low price. Since this stock has been volatile on small shares before, they tried to bring down the price perhaps in an attempt to buy very low. Did not work! Will not work; there are no sellers at $120’s anymore. Everyone stay steady. There will be other attempts."
Seems if this is such a good company then at some point institutional buyers will step in to get a bargain. Below 75 and that’s not happening which leads you to believe it’s going down more. My average purchase price is 92.00. A big drop already!
why is this dropping hard?
"Their presentation at JPM was eye opening. They have so many good things that are going to happen in 2021. They also talked about int'l expansion, which had not been discussed extensively in prior CC. ""2021 will be a transformative year"". Good luck to you if you're long."
It seems the market has finally absolved SoftBank big selling GH shares.
Some upgrades would be great right about now.
SoftBank sold 4.9 million shares on 9-11 at $77 according to SEC form 4 filing
Great news today from GH with the liquid biopsy test for colorectal cancer detection. Does this need to go through FDA approval process?
added 750 shares At 97
"Just crushed it!* Revenue of $67.5 million for the first quarter of 2020, representing an 84% increase over the corresponding period of 2019* Gross margin was 69.6% as compared to 63.1% for the corresponding prior year period."
"Instead of that acquisition move, while the stock had momentum in $130's, they should've announced ORACLE. By now, we would be looking into $140's. Somewhat disappointing; amateur management when it comes to managing the stock price and publicity."
easy $15/share from here as this will go back up to $120/share
I have been a long term holder shortly after the companies IPO. With the recent insider selling I have turned bearish on stock.
"This could be very bad for GH shareholders, here's 2 tidbits to consider. First, in MBA class for M&A, the first rule is you never buy a company with a lower valuation that yours. NEO's P/S is 1/3 of GHs. Buying less valuable companies reduces your value. Second, remember EXAS buying a genomic company about 1.5-2 yrs ago? Same story, and EXAS has never recovered. So, on the basis of good M&A, and the basis of past acquisitions, this is a bad deal for GH and GH shareholders."
Now what??
when is the earnings date? anyone?
Guardant Health is down 5.63% to 107.96
"GH is one security that can swing hard both ways, still long term outlook is for strong growth, just have to ride the occasional downdrafts"
Interesting the co-ceo's. Unusual...
"GH for long term investment Have faith, it will reach$200 within couple of years"
"Last Q, after earnings blow out, GH went from 87 to 110. Growth was spectacular. No reason to assume otherwise this quarter."
"Published on December 8, 2020 at 12:32 pm by ALEX SMITH in Hedge Fund Investor LettersHere is what Baron Asset Fund said : Last quarter, the Fund initiated a position in Guardant Health, Inc., which we added to this quarter. The company offers a liquid biopsy test to detect advanced stage cancer, and it is developing liquid biopsy tests for recurrence detection in cancer survivors and early detection of cancer in higher-risk individuals. We believe Guardant’s liquid biopsy tests are superior to tissue biopsy because they are less invasive, do not require physical access to the tumor, are more representative of the tumor’s molecular profile, enable repeat sampling, have faster turnaround times, and support real-time monitoring.We believe that Guardant has important competitive advantages, including unique technology incorporating proprietary biochemistries and machine learning, demonstrated clinical utility, regulatory barriers, payer coverage, and commercial adoption. We believe the market opportunity for Guardant’s tests could be greater than $35 billion in the U.S. alone. This includes large markets for therapy selection in advanced cancers, recurrence detection in cancer survivors, and early-stage cancer detection among highrisk individuals"
What is going on today?
I guess disappointing earnings once again
Guardant Health decided not to buy NeoGenomics
MY prediction came thru. I am out for now. Will come back when it goes down. I am so excited I thought we would have to wait until spring to see 156. Congrats long. God bless.
"Superb buying opportunity! GH does not get impacted by trade deals or the macro economy factors. Cancer diagnostics is needed no matter what. GH will see $120/share sooner than later on its way to $150/share. Tremendous growth reported during earnings call, they raised the guidance significantly, and they will surpass it. Buy at this opportunity!!"
Has this had a up day in 2 weeks?
GH releasing quarter as expected on Nov 7AH. They announced on their site Hope they r Ok and announce FDA filing and some more color on Medicare expansion . First qtr release that I am uncertain of the outlook :(
"If Illumina is allowed to acquire Grail, this will present a huge challenge to GH."
"From the recent JP Morgan Conference:The administrative contractor for the Medicare Molecular Diagnostics program, Palmetto, recently expanded its LCD for Guardant360 across a dozen solid tumor types, effective Feb. 3. The move makes the test the first and only liquid biopsy assay to be covered for use across most solid tumors, according to Guardant. The majority of the 700,000 patients that could benefit from using the Guardant360 test don't yet receive genomic testing, so the test has only begun to penetrate its total addressable market. The test, the firm's first product, presents a $6 billion opportunity, Eltoukhy said, adding that the total number of lives covered by the test has increased from 115 million a year ago to 170 million."
GH is the first to use artificial intelligence with their latest purchase. It allows GH to have the most accurate genetic analysis anywhere.
They filed FDA . Thank god:) Toothy plz stick arnd
I remember when this way over 100
"so much green buying. GH is flying back to $130's on its way to $150, $180 and beyond. Accumulate every opportunity."
One of the worst looking charts I’ve seen in many months... awful!
"Estimated loss: $0.36; actual $0.78 Jump in revenue, but that was expected. Will be interesting what the reaction will be tomorrow..."
"Helmy has sold stocks at 40, 70,80,90,110 etc He has 4 M shares and gets 200K each year . You don’t expect him to trim periodically ?"
"I know that I'm repeating myself, but imo GH is following the pattern of Foundation Medicine which was subsequently bought by Roche for $137/ Look for A mega pharma to throw a bid. IMO it would be >$150."
insiders from admin to execs are selling on the downside. This is terrible.
