"And, I don’t think anyone doubts that they will the FDA approvals for Lunar. The data look extremely positive."
added 750 shares At 97
They had some interesting insights about GH on (http://Fairstox.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"And still it continues down? Anyone with any thoughts on WHY ? ThxTotal revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $54.0 million, a 178% increase over the second quarter of 2018"
* Guardant Health Inc : JP Morgan raises target price to $185 from $180
press release on a sunday night is rare but sounds like great news plus the JPM conference is a big deal so boost is in store tomorrow buy before 2 pm est since I expect a great presentation (presenting on monday of a big 3 day conference shows some real legitimacy about Guardent
It seems the market has finally absolved SoftBank big selling GH shares.
big sell off by ceo on aug 13 hasn't affected anything
Also this entire sector is out of favor right now. NTRA and EXAS are suffering the same faith.
"According to Bloomberg, deal NOT happening."
Anyone know what is Guardant-19 ? Company asked FDA to pull off emergency usage on Monday . Hence stock is dropping
"For those of you who want to invest in this company long term, this is a good entry point at $110."
steady everyone; $120's will be captured again. Then earnings report. They need to show growth in top line revenue; no need for profits to go crazy. Just decent top line revenue growth. IF they show anything over 15% QoQ growth on top line revenue; we will see $150's by year end.
"As I said, $105 is a very firm bottom due to Friday and Monday actions"
Guardant Health is up 5.39% to 114.39
"Great technology; insurances will start covering the tests; Guardant360 is very accurate that making it great products for cancer treatment and clinical trials. Enormous potential, I am long and very optimistic."
GH is up 9%. Anyone knows if there is any news ?
Very disappointed
Revenues are growing profits will follow. GH leads the pack in cancer liquid biopsy tests and actual approvals.
"A lot of people are afraid because the lock up period expires tomorrow. That expiration will allow insiders to sell some of their stocks, if they choose to, causing the stock to drop. Also, today an analyst downgraded the stock to “ sell.” These fluctuations are normal for companies with these characteristics. Otherwise, no news, no change in the fundamentals. For a guerrilla company with rule breaking attributes these wild swings are normal: the same way it was going 10% up in several days, it can also do the reverse. The key is NOT TO GET CAUGHT UP in these oscillation and have strong steady hands, if you believe in the approach, product, and the management."
Analysts tafget is $160 to $185 as Guardant has approval for simple cancer blood tests with over 90% accuracy.
Not to rain on the parade because I’m long too but does anybody know just exactly how much of the 30 percent ownership of GH by Softbank was liquidated in the past couple of months? Great numbers and no doubt an up and comer but if Softbank continues to sell what remains of their stake isn’t the stock probably going to remain in the lower end of the trading range we’ve seen the last couple months? Remember last quarter? Great numbers and huge bounce but was short lived. Comments? Insight?
Guardant Health decided not to buy NeoGenomics
"They must show revenue growth. I don't care about losses as long as there is revenue growth. But, it's been anemic from one quarter to the next - it must be >25% and it is not. There is no catalyst in the short term to move the price higher. Longs will have to stay long until next FDA approval and large adoption rate of current products. No, it will not disappear; the long term promise is as intact as ever."
"Awesome action today. With FDA approvals coming in early 2022 and expected price jump, not a lot of opportunity left to accumulate. After a very brief pause, we will be in $120’s-$130’s. The price target at end of 2022 is over $250/share."
easy $15/share from here as this will go back up to $120/share
Really surprised that there have been no downgrades. Not sure how low this is going but will be buying at the right price.
"Published on December 8, 2020 at 12:32 pm by ALEX SMITH in Hedge Fund Investor LettersHere is what Baron Asset Fund said : Last quarter, the Fund initiated a position in Guardant Health, Inc., which we added to this quarter. The company offers a liquid biopsy test to detect advanced stage cancer, and it is developing liquid biopsy tests for recurrence detection in cancer survivors and early detection of cancer in higher-risk individuals. We believe Guardant’s liquid biopsy tests are superior to tissue biopsy because they are less invasive, do not require physical access to the tumor, are more representative of the tumor’s molecular profile, enable repeat sampling, have faster turnaround times, and support real-time monitoring.We believe that Guardant has important competitive advantages, including unique technology incorporating proprietary biochemistries and machine learning, demonstrated clinical utility, regulatory barriers, payer coverage, and commercial adoption. We believe the market opportunity for Guardant’s tests could be greater than $35 billion in the U.S. alone. This includes large markets for therapy selection in advanced cancers, recurrence detection in cancer survivors, and early-stage cancer detection among highrisk individuals"
"Buy, 125-130 near term target"
"Superb buying opportunity! GH does not get impacted by trade deals or the macro economy factors. Cancer diagnostics is needed no matter what. GH will see $120/share sooner than later on its way to $150/share. Tremendous growth reported during earnings call, they raised the guidance significantly, and they will surpass it. Buy at this opportunity!!"
"As I said, $120’s will be captured before earnings call. From then on it all depends on growth rate. Anything over 15% is positive for GH and will push it into $130’s. FDA preliminary approvals should come in 2022"
Has this had a up day in 2 weeks?
Does anyone know when the lock up expiration is? I’d love an opportunity to get in at a slightly lower price.
"Trying to manipulate this stock, you need to buy and sell over 5,000 shares. 2 shares won't do!! Haha."
"100k volume at closing. This is none of you and me! In three very red sessions, GH had good upside buying despite slight decline in price. Buying on the upside has started. Tighten seat belts, GH is taking off!"
Guardant Health is up 5.22% to 107.61
"If Illumina is allowed to acquire Grail, this will present a huge challenge to GH."
"Today was a good day for me. Added another 1000 shares at 92.25, and GH is 92.45 as if this posting. $2,200 profit in an hour is not bad. Although I am a long term investor, I couldn’t resist buying at 92.25 since I’ve noticed over days that GH goes down temporarily, but doesn’t stay down for long, so I let’s take advantage of this trend."
"Uncanny strength since lock-up expiration and secondary, especially considering the overall trouncing most stocks have suffered lately."
"When I said it $15/share is left in this stock to gain, it was down $22/share. Now, $16/share...already gained $6/share! Mark my word, it will be in $120's in no time."
Could be the best stock of all time. Covid 19 will make shareholders wealthier than Oprah
This stock was trading consistently between $160 to $180 just 6 to 8 months ago. They had so much promise with Luna -1 and Luna -2 with a TAM of $45B+. It is now hard to see this stock reaching these levels unless we hear about possible FDA approvals. I have been holder of this stock since shortly after IPO. So much promise then and still does. Need to do more DD as to what is happening as I have been to complacent.
"check for at least a few of days of ""upside"" buying; then this may become an opportunity for a $20 upside movement; otherwise, no reason to engage on GH at this point."
I’m happy... got in at $32.In for the long haul!
It is extremely important to have a strong balance sheet in this environment. 3% dilution is nothing. Getting rid of the Softbank overhang is a plus. Having cash to fund development is even better.
"Interesting chatter with ILMN/GRAIL. I suspect the ""potential"" anticompetitive nature of a top tier sequencing/instrumentation could have with GH and others will be taken into advisement at the FTC. On the other hand the net result of this acquisition could add fuel to the ctDNA market under the right settlement. I believe GH will come out fine in this $6B market."
2021 guidance 360 to 370 million 30 percent increase over 2020. 90000 test expected to be completed. GROWING !!!!
"04:14 PM EDT, 08/23/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Connect Biopharma (CNTB) said Monday that it appointed Jiang Bian general counsel and chief compliance officer, effective Aug. 20.Bian was most recently senior counsel of Guardant Health (GH)."
$128. Getting close to $130
What’s happening? Inside / investors bigger sell off?
What’s happy pre down $7.00
"Based on my assessment, they really need to lay off 200 people and either save that money or hire people who know what they are doing. You got two fat cats on the top who just don't care and they have hired family and friends at Director and VP jobs and those guys brought in more of their buddies on board.Enough said...you guys get the point."
"Small volume, but in two very red days; I see upside buyers. With the learning that SB already sold and insider selling tapering down; it is time to start buying GH again. It’s heading back to $130-$140."
Now what??
Look like day traders play GH again and again
While analysts recommend a buy Why big drop ?
Guardant Health is up 5.88% to 105.29
$120-$130 coming. Lots of upside buying in the past few days.FDA approvals in March 2022. That is only 2.5 quarters away!Price target in 2022; north of $250/share.
Good outcome $115 going up
"GH is one security that can swing hard both ways, still long term outlook is for strong growth, just have to ride the occasional downdrafts"
It moves such high % up and down on small volume; GH can be manipulated by anyone. It does not help that insiders are still selling; which shows lack of trust in management.
"In a collapsing market GH went up 12.7% today. It’s sometimes hard to know what’s going on.It is likely that a good news is in the horizon, like FDA approval of the Guardant360."
"SWAV. is making me retire quickly....I love it and I hope those of you that listened to me are enjoying the fruits of your labor!!...As for GH, they need to hire right people to do the job and enough with friends and family."
"This could be very bad for GH shareholders, here's 2 tidbits to consider. First, in MBA class for M&A, the first rule is you never buy a company with a lower valuation that yours. NEO's P/S is 1/3 of GHs. Buying less valuable companies reduces your value. Second, remember EXAS buying a genomic company about 1.5-2 yrs ago? Same story, and EXAS has never recovered. So, on the basis of good M&A, and the basis of past acquisitions, this is a bad deal for GH and GH shareholders."
I thought GH reported today but on my Fidelity account it says March 11. Another month of waiting! Maybe I’ll buy a few more shares in the meantime.
Will investors start to sell again like two months ago
"New to this thread.I don't have any money in this company but have been following for almost two years. I see nobody noticed the biggest change in this company.CEO Nall did what good CEOs do, found where the company was week and fixed it.Last Sept he hired Edwin Hedrick as CCO.That was start of the turn around for this company.Edwin brought in a new VP sales and VP marketing; his old team. Bye the way his last two companys got bought out.1q 19 was there first full quaters.Here's the revenue numbers:1q/4q 2018. ^ 19%2q/1q. ^16%3q/2q ^28% amazingYear to date revenues are up 50%At this rate they could be cash positive by 4q 20or if they keep up 28%+ q/q3q 20Along with the expansion of products this company can be as $GH. I may have to buy in soon to this young company.Day to day trading doesn't matter it's the quarter on quarter revenue numbers that will turn this stock around. They might have to raise money one more time this next year but should be a non dilutive loan, hopefully for you guys..Just my opinion, the numbers don't lie HAPPY THANKSGIVING"
I have been a long term holder shortly after the companies IPO. With the recent insider selling I have turned bearish on stock.
"This company has revenue, but not profit. What's the story on that? Where does the revenue go and how is the current valuation justified? Thanks."
"Stellar earnings call. This is a growth company, not a revenue company at this stage of their development as a company. It's like expecting Amazon to show robust bottom line profits when they were growing so fast. Never happened, no one expected. Awesome report. Their technology is growing in complexity, applications, and demand. Cannot ask for more."
"Kevin is an active member on this board and kudos to him as he somehow saw this stock trading higher when it was in the dumps earlier last month. I have sellers regret as I sold a portion of my holdings. I have held my position since the stock went public. I loved the long term potential and like Kevin this was a buying opportunity not a selling opportunity. Fortunately, I sold only a small portion BUT I still regret my move."
"The data gather by GH to build their bio informatics database will be just like building self driving cars. the more data GH gathers from usages daily/monthly/yearly the more accurate GH's product will be. The Machine Learning used to train with this data will cement GH as one of the leading products in the industry. For companies coming in now and claim they have better product is full of it. I don't care what any competitors do or say. I have confidence in the upper management to make the right decisions on how they enhance and build out and refine their products over time. I believe this industry is very similar to software development and that the more data you gather, the better and more accurate this product is. I don't think any company out there has GH's upper managment's track record in this industry at this point."
"$130’s, as I mentioned a while ago, is coming. Buying on the green side continues regardless of overall market direction. Accumulate now in preparation for FDA approvals. Further, Grail and Illumina situation has increased chances of acquisition now."
Great news today from GH with the liquid biopsy test for colorectal cancer detection. Does this need to go through FDA approval process?
What is going on????
"Someone tried unsuccessfully to manipulate the stock price premarket by selling few shares at very low price. Since this stock has been volatile on small shares before, they tried to bring down the price perhaps in an attempt to buy very low. Did not work! Will not work; there are no sellers at $120’s anymore. Everyone stay steady. There will be other attempts."
"I have had them since shortly after the IPO. I bought more when they went up to $100's and came back down to low $60's. The basic premise of the company has not changed. Lunar approvals are coming. the management is checking all the boxes per their plan. Nothing has changed except COVID created delays in revenue growth based on existing products due to cancer patients, with compromised immune systems due to drug therapies, have not been going to hospitals or doctors as often as before. Everything else is noise. Short term holders of this stock are doomed due to low volume. Stock price has been affected by insider selling (don't blame them, most of their compensation is through stocks) and pre IPO holders. It will sift through. We will be back on track towards $200/share."
"was a nice run , now we have to see how many sell after the lockup date"
why is this dropping hard?
"This drop maybe, only maybe, related to a drop in a number of cancer therapy companies related to Allogen failing FDA approval for its cancer drug. Whether GH works with Allogen to develop cancer drugs; I have no idea."
GH is the first to use artificial intelligence with their latest purchase. It allows GH to have the most accurate genetic analysis anywhere.
"Some of the posts remind me when I was in Wayfair. Stock was in the 80s after coming down hard from $114 range. I was in around $93. So much doom and gloom, within 3 months stock was over $160. Good companies most of the time will come back strong and then takeoff from my long time experience. This is a volatile stock but has Huge potential. I would guess 2 months from now the mood here could be quite different. Ive seen this happen endless times in my trading career."
"Last Q, after earnings blow out, GH went from 87 to 110. Growth was spectacular. No reason to assume otherwise this quarter."
Looking through some data I saw that around 3.3 million shares are shorts right now. Anybody have any insight into this? Maybe the reason for the uptick yesterday? I would probably be getting nervous right now if I had sold short at current prices levels since GH has pretty much been flat the last few days and if anything it’s went up a little.
Charts indicate GH will be back at $119.00 very soon. No other company has as many cancer tests that are actually approved using only a blood test.
"We got spoiled yesterday as it went up past $117. Not expecting much of a reversal of fortune today. Would like to be wrong, but....."
"Despite pretty severe market movements, GH is holding very well."
"Guardant is more advanced in genetic testing for cancer with more approvals and accuracy now using artificial intelligence. Natera, NTRA, is up over $3.00 today in a similar business but not as advanced as GH. Guardant is focussed on profits and accuracy and even exited a emergency use Covid test, Guardant 19, when it could not be profitable. Others, like EXAS, are carrying uncompetitive obsolete products."
"The way chemotherapy is evolving based on new DNA markers, and the ""tailored approach"" is truly stunning. I have seen dramatic, profound changes in my over 20 years of practicing medicine. Esp in the last 5 years. Companies like GH, and EXAS are at the forefront of this new way of treating or diagnosing cancers. Glad to be here!"
We were accepted by Medicare for a coverage expansion. Big news! We should run up on this.
SoftBank sold 4.9 million shares on 9-11 at $77 according to SEC form 4 filing
Patience has paid off. I think another few years of patience is worth it!
GH is Tesla of LB All others are trying to play catch up to compete with them Value will be seen in couple years
SoftBank is selling their shares in GH . Guardant health is not adding any dilution to be very clear It’s good that softie is exiting so we are better for longer term
Wow $124.7
$EXAS and $GH both trading at 87 ... today marks the beginning of the 1 year challenge between the two. My bet is on $GH to see gains of at least 50% ... $EXAS will lag
Another horrendous day on small volume. No major buyer; all retail and insiders selling on the downside. There seems no bottom and GH’s management is hopeless.
"A unique growth company, specializing in the toxic cancerous environment of helping people lose money."
"Their presentation at JPM was eye opening. They have so many good things that are going to happen in 2021. They also talked about int'l expansion, which had not been discussed extensively in prior CC. ""2021 will be a transformative year"". Good luck to you if you're long."
How about a class action lawsuit!!!!!!
Movin and shakin'
continues the climb despite sea of red everywhere else. There are certainly buyers.
So how much do you guys think it may pull back to. Have 500 stocks averaged to $90 which I want to keep for long run. Looking to buy more
This stock is being manipulated….
I am long the stock since the IPO but please please be aware that the pending lockup expiration occurs in April which allows insiders to sell. I normally buy stocks and hold them for years so I don’t really care but those buying on the hype today needs to be careful. Just saying
"It’s political. As the politicians are jawboning for Medicare for all. Thus, General weakness on healthcare stocks vs SP500 index. Not something GH needs to be concerned with. As I stated previously, GH will range between 50-100 bucks for the next 2-3 years. GH’s sales needs to catch the stock price."
"Was anyone surprised by the news? There should not be any surprises here. Preliminary FDA approvals for Lunar is coming in Q1. As I said, $105 was a solid base; it bounced off of it very strongly to $114 now. Now, it all depends what they report in the earning call; good growth in revenues (not profits) and good guidance for further revenue growth. Both numbers need to be over 15% at the least."
"Both $EXAS and $NTRA came up on upside buying; especially EXAS, on decent volume too."
are we going to see $120 before this session ends?
"The CEO only sold 90,000 shares : CEO of Guardant Health Inc (GH) Helmy Eltoukhy sold 90,000 shares of GH on 04/22/2019 at an average price of $65.28 a share. The total sale was $5.9 million. Let's get our facts straight William"
Whats with the rise today?
Best in class stocks in exploding fields are good picks. I like GH long.
"$130 once, $130 twice, $130 trice...Bought!!Do I hear $135-$140 soon?"
something is broken here. A few weeks ago 87 felt like a bargain.
"I have been here since the IPO. It will be at $115-$120 in no time and then on its way to $150. You cannot go wrong with GH. They have revised all metrics upward every quarter. Their tools are and will become invaluable for cancer treatment, diagnosis, and eventually prevention. Overall economy, trade wars, currency wars, politics, etc. have no impact on GH. It's a sure thing. This is a buying opportunity, no doubt about it."
"Hard to believe it’s dropped below 87. But I bought with a 3-5 year horizon, and fully aware of some legal issues and FDA pending approvals coming this Fall. I’m anticipating significant growth over next few years, and am positioned long, accordingly! I believe they will pass through these relatively overinflated hurdles, and come out this winter with the stellar growth they have already demonstrated. Patience rewards the long investor!"
"The management donot know how to grow business.. just watch how many times shares offered, very high expending and expenses and management payments and bonuses! Not good!"
Sell at $131 or hold?
Truly time the CEO departed and the sooner the better !!!!!
"What were they thinking? Now everyone knows that the management team are great at technicals but obviously lame for building a business. Additionally, the Co-CEO roles are over the top in this fiasco."
GH still leads in genetic approvals for cancer accuracy tests using a simple blood test.
"Guardant Health, Inc. (Nasdaq: GH) announces that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Guardant360 CDx for tumor mutation profiling, also known as comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP), in patients with any solid malignant neoplasm (cancerous tumor). The Guardant360 CDx is also approved as a companion diagnostic to identify non-small cell lung cancer patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) alterations who may benefit from treatment with Tagrisso (osimertinib). Guardant360 CDx offers patients and clinicians a simple, faster blood test to help inform personalized treatment options.The Guardant360 CDx FDA approval was based on clinical and analytical validation data from over 5,000 samples. In a retrospective analysis of data from pivotal phase III clinical trials, FLAURA and AURA3, non-small cell lung cancer patients identified for treatment with Tagrisso (osimertinib) using the Guardant360 CDx demonstrated progression-free survival rates consistent with those identified using traditional biomarker testing. Since being introduced as a laboratory developed test (LDT), the Guardant360 liquid biopsy LDT has become widely accepted for blood-based CGP with more than 150 peer-reviewed publications.1 It has been used by more than 7,000 oncologists nationwide, and more than 150,000 Guardant360 tests have been performed to date.1 The test is broadly covered by Medicare and many private payers, representing over 170 million lives.1"
GH releasing quarter as expected on Nov 7AH. They announced on their site Hope they r Ok and announce FDA filing and some more color on Medicare expansion . First qtr release that I am uncertain of the outlook :(
Great action today. Two large volume sales on downside; the stock price continued upward trend regardless. $130 coming.
ready to bounce back to $170 and this time it will go to $200. Classic chart and technical formation.
"Congrats again to all the longs. $158! GH is not a day trading stock. FDA approvals are coming, M&A activity will pick up. You day trade, you will be left out of a major price movement. It bounced from low $120's just a few days ago to what it is today. Imagine if you had sold your positions. Keep your shares and enjoy the ride."
"Well, they say stocks cannot just go up. We had like 7 or 8 ups in a row, so I suppose an off day was due. Minimal damage at $0.20. Time for more green."
Why is top management still here ????????
Too late to sell?
Give up on GH?
"Markets have rallied back, NEO's pop has fizzled out and GH still falling. Guess it'll take a while for the dust to settle."
There's a problem with management! Revenue growth is slowing while profitability is a distant dream.
"Wow, down into double digits, glad I sold when I did at $160."
held my nose and bought some at 74.85.
"Instead of that acquisition move, while the stock had momentum in $130's, they should've announced ORACLE. By now, we would be looking into $140's. Somewhat disappointing; amateur management when it comes to managing the stock price and publicity."
"I thought SoftBank was done with GH, but apparently not. Still selling shares. When do we get rid of SB completely? This is the third time that SB has screwed GH."
Looking strong going in to earnings!
"GH is not GME, but no one is selling here. March to $180 underway. Then, $200, then $250, then $300."
Down almost $80 in 6 months. Time for a change in direction. This daily drop siht is getting old.
"Down 6 of 7 days, Down 15.72% year to date. And down 39.35% since Feb. 12, 2021….. Awful!!!!"
"$78-$80 is a golden opportunity to buy more. Depending on your patience level, this year $40 /share gain from here; if you hold through mid 2021 when Lunar-2 gets approvals, $70 /share gain; almost doubling. This is a millionaire maker stock! I am betting on it big and plan to hold through Lunar-2 approvals."
Time to go back up
"Complete knee jerk reaction to the news since it is not confirmed, assuming it is true, no one knows how much premium they would pay for Neo. Thus a 16% drop makes no sense other than just an initial reaction. Assume they pay no premium, then it's net net neutral since they add valuation to the company while assuming debt. Neo has positive EPS, so, in fact it would be accretive to their business - then share price of the combined company should rise not go down - if no premium paid.Long term it is a good play against Grail /Illumina. But they must show the ability to execute the assumed synergies if they do acquire them. That is the risk."
"Got it with 3000 shares at $112, got out on 07 Sept at $132.50. Looking at the $6 slide in after hours, that deal is looking more and more like a good move."
I love ten percent up days!
Company going bankrupt….
"The sell off with such a large volume and the subsequent day, yesterday, however, were important events as it established a very firm bottom at $105 for GH. Barring any extraordinary event, it is up from here."
"Under the radar, great company with a very long runway. Quietly heading to $200."
"Target price of over $167? The 52 week low is like $96.66, or some $6 away. Which comes first, a new target, or a new low. I think the down side wins. ."
What triggered this sell off?
"GH for long term investment Have faith, it will reach$200 within couple of years"
I hear $140’s.
"Another after hours try for manipulation by a rather poor retailer. Someone sold two shares at $110. Check it out at Nasdaq after hours site.After Hours Time (ET) After Hours Price After Hours Share Volume19:43:14 $110 217:29:32 $121.1 2,73516:24:03 $121.1 15016:15:17 $121.5 20816:12:32 $121.1 48"
Management is not aware of their impact. A piece of news; an article will move this by $10 right now
It’s funny I wrote earlier in the day for Medicare expansion news and it came in afternoon . Now let’s see strong hands come in next week.
"Took a small gain on the 27th on the sale 2500 shares at $115.10. Used the money to get 2000 shares of NVAX at $142.00. Looks like it was the better move. This gets to between today’s close and $120, then decides to go back and start all over."
60% off the highs despite good progress on revenues in each segment. It has been painful to watch last 6 months but as long term long thinking about buying more……I have been putting everything available into Pfizer and still see more upside there but this is tempting. Don’t like the co-CEO structure never works unless someone buys and integrates them. Pfizer with all their vaccine cash?
"so much green buying. GH is flying back to $130's on its way to $150, $180 and beyond. Accumulate every opportunity."
Congratulations to patient Longs!! GH came out triumphant with the quarterly results. The sky is the limit now. Good news on all cylinders!
close in green today
