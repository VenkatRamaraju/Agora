Truly time the CEO departed and the sooner the better !!!!!
What triggered this sell off?
"I have had them since shortly after the IPO. I bought more when they went up to $100's and came back down to low $60's. The basic premise of the company has not changed. Lunar approvals are coming. the management is checking all the boxes per their plan. Nothing has changed except COVID created delays in revenue growth based on existing products due to cancer patients, with compromised immune systems due to drug therapies, have not been going to hospitals or doctors as often as before. Everything else is noise. Short term holders of this stock are doomed due to low volume. Stock price has been affected by insider selling (don't blame them, most of their compensation is through stocks) and pre IPO holders. It will sift through. We will be back on track towards $200/share."
"Trying to manipulate this stock, you need to buy and sell over 5,000 shares. 2 shares won't do!! Haha."
"Took a small gain on the 27th on the sale 2500 shares at $115.10. Used the money to get 2000 shares of NVAX at $142.00. Looks like it was the better move. This gets to between today’s close and $120, then decides to go back and start all over."
Why is top management still here ????????
How about a class action lawsuit!!!!!!
They had some interesting insights about GH on (http://Fairstox.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Sell at $131 or hold?
Too late to sell?
"Based on my assessment, they really need to lay off 200 people and either save that money or hire people who know what they are doing. You got two fat cats on the top who just don't care and they have hired family and friends at Director and VP jobs and those guys brought in more of their buddies on board.Enough said...you guys get the point."
steady everyone; $120's will be captured again. Then earnings report. They need to show growth in top line revenue; no need for profits to go crazy. Just decent top line revenue growth. IF they show anything over 15% QoQ growth on top line revenue; we will see $150's by year end.
"so much green buying. GH is flying back to $130's on its way to $150, $180 and beyond. Accumulate every opportunity."
"Target price of over $167? The 52 week low is like $96.66, or some $6 away. Which comes first, a new target, or a new low. I think the down side wins. ."
"Was anyone surprised by the news? There should not be any surprises here. Preliminary FDA approvals for Lunar is coming in Q1. As I said, $105 was a solid base; it bounced off of it very strongly to $114 now. Now, it all depends what they report in the earning call; good growth in revenues (not profits) and good guidance for further revenue growth. Both numbers need to be over 15% at the least."
"Despite pretty severe market movements, GH is holding very well."
"As I said, $105 is a very firm bottom due to Friday and Monday actions"
There's a problem with management! Revenue growth is slowing while profitability is a distant dream.
Time to go back up
"The sell off with such a large volume and the subsequent day, yesterday, however, were important events as it established a very firm bottom at $105 for GH. Barring any extraordinary event, it is up from here."
"Instead of that acquisition move, while the stock had momentum in $130's, they should've announced ORACLE. By now, we would be looking into $140's. Somewhat disappointing; amateur management when it comes to managing the stock price and publicity."
"Kevin is an active member on this board and kudos to him as he somehow saw this stock trading higher when it was in the dumps earlier last month. I have sellers regret as I sold a portion of my holdings. I have held my position since the stock went public. I loved the long term potential and like Kevin this was a buying opportunity not a selling opportunity. Fortunately, I sold only a small portion BUT I still regret my move."
Guardant Health is up 5.88% to 105.29
"Complete knee jerk reaction to the news since it is not confirmed, assuming it is true, no one knows how much premium they would pay for Neo. Thus a 16% drop makes no sense other than just an initial reaction. Assume they pay no premium, then it's net net neutral since they add valuation to the company while assuming debt. Neo has positive EPS, so, in fact it would be accretive to their business - then share price of the combined company should rise not go down - if no premium paid.Long term it is a good play against Grail /Illumina. But they must show the ability to execute the assumed synergies if they do acquire them. That is the risk."
What’s happening? Inside / investors bigger sell off?
Company going bankrupt….
Very disappointed
"As I said, $120’s will be captured before earnings call. From then on it all depends on growth rate. Anything over 15% is positive for GH and will push it into $130’s. FDA preliminary approvals should come in 2022"
"This could be very bad for GH shareholders, here's 2 tidbits to consider. First, in MBA class for M&A, the first rule is you never buy a company with a lower valuation that yours. NEO's P/S is 1/3 of GHs. Buying less valuable companies reduces your value. Second, remember EXAS buying a genomic company about 1.5-2 yrs ago? Same story, and EXAS has never recovered. So, on the basis of good M&A, and the basis of past acquisitions, this is a bad deal for GH and GH shareholders."
Give up on GH?
easy $15/share from here as this will go back up to $120/share
"We got spoiled yesterday as it went up past $117. Not expecting much of a reversal of fortune today. Would like to be wrong, but....."
"Markets have rallied back, NEO's pop has fizzled out and GH still falling. Guess it'll take a while for the dust to settle."
"Someone tried unsuccessfully to manipulate the stock price premarket by selling few shares at very low price. Since this stock has been volatile on small shares before, they tried to bring down the price perhaps in an attempt to buy very low. Did not work! Will not work; there are no sellers at $120’s anymore. Everyone stay steady. There will be other attempts."
"This drop maybe, only maybe, related to a drop in a number of cancer therapy companies related to Allogen failing FDA approval for its cancer drug. Whether GH works with Allogen to develop cancer drugs; I have no idea."
"According to Bloomberg, deal NOT happening."
This stock was trading consistently between $160 to $180 just 6 to 8 months ago. They had so much promise with Luna -1 and Luna -2 with a TAM of $45B+. It is now hard to see this stock reaching these levels unless we hear about possible FDA approvals. I have been holder of this stock since shortly after IPO. So much promise then and still does. Need to do more DD as to what is happening as I have been to complacent.
Good outcome $115 going up
"When I said it $15/share is left in this stock to gain, it was down $22/share. Now, $16/share...already gained $6/share! Mark my word, it will be in $120's in no time."
"And, I don’t think anyone doubts that they will the FDA approvals for Lunar. The data look extremely positive."
