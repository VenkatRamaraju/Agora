I see a ton of ads for wild salmon and Alaskan salmon on Facebook. All ocean farmed. What AQB needs more than anything is increased production so they can expand distribution. Salmon is a hot commodity in the U.S. and really a hot commodity in South America. Hoping for an additional farm/production facility soon.
AquaBounty CEO confident that GM farmed salmon ready for consumers this month
"The recent ER left a lot to be desired, but this is a long play stock. It is extremely undervalued currently. New plant announcement in Ohio is bullish, a partnership with another nation would send the stock into the 20's easily. Only a matter of time until more people recognize the value of this company."
Today earnings call?
Their Indiana farm will turn this company into a 1 Billion dollar company alone.
"Guys look at the 6M chart, not one week. This price action is quite normal for AQB in this environment. I just added some shares."
"@Yochanan During 2020 is US alone 600,000 metri tons, mostly imported. For 5$/kilo that's $3B annualy. If AQB can produce 10% of that consumption that's an annual revenue of $300M annually which would justify at least a $1.5B MCAP. This is 8X current MCAP. That's US alone mind you. Sounds good enough for me..."
"The S-3 SEC filing on 08.06.21, offering 18.2M shares at no more than $4.93/share = almost $90M; AQB will not receive any proceeds from the sale. My question: is this big money used to lure a big investor or multiple investors? And, those investors could be individuals or institutional investors like ARK. And, is it likely those big investors will hold for a longer period; more than months. Even though this will be a dilution, could this give the stock an upward momentum, especially if the investor(s) have a good track record with other stock purchases?"
Stock price is cheaper than buying a quarter pound of nova.
Crazy food prices on the horizon! We need companies like AQB! https://youtube.com/watch?v=I0nCuqc2_wc&feature=share
10$ by July
"The excitement over the opening of the foodservice industry has increased demand for America's second most consumed seafood…Salmon. Global Salmon supply leaders in Chile are reporting at least a 20% decrease in Salmon production. One year ago, farmers were forced to lower the amount of fish they put in the water due to pandemic uncertainty. Fast forward to today, those same suppliers have a much lower number of fully grown Salmon available to harvest.Couple this lack of supply with the quickest spike in demand in recent history, prices have been on the rise. In addition, Navy Day, a Chilean national holiday, fell on May 21st. This holiday called for celebration and a break from production. Norwegian Salmon suppliers have also reported much higher numbers in the earlier quarters of the year compared to late 2020."
This would be a good stock for the WSB crew to buy. With market cap of under 500 million they could pump AQB up to 20 in couple days. Clearly targeted by some short sellers.
This is pathetic. Inconsistent volume. Absolutely no PR. AQB needs to start building a brand name. It needs to start educating the public and retail sector on its benefits and start really differentiating itself from competition. They need speak up on the significance of their new production facility and what it means in terms of sales and the expansion of its geographic footprint. Executive management needs to get out there.
Why can't we eat the salmon yet!?? I am ready for my fish
"Worth repeating: ""the MCS’s Good Fish Guide recommends seeking out salmon that has been organically farmed."" The seas are polluted, farmed salmon is plagued with chemicals and world will continue to require sources of protein. AQB is the right product with the right organic process at the right time. As retail distribution and consumer trial grows, so will our share price. This is going to be big."
"Randal J. Kirk, & Third Security, LLC.... For those not familiar, he owns over 25% of AQB. Worth understanding who he is and what he has accomplished in his life, if you are not familiar with him. Lots of muscle behind this little (for now) company."
AquaBounty Technologies to Present at Upcoming Investor Conferences in September. This is on the company's website under press releases. I think this is great. It should result in new investors.
Does anyone know any public companies in this industry that are comparable to AQB in what they do? Im looking for market cap and addressable market info. Im new to this industry and very interested but find very limited info unfortunately.
To the moon
Excellent article in the Washington post today about “California’s disappearing salmon”. This technology is important.
"Congress has to pass a debt ceiling increase, before the end of September? Hopefully as the two parties fight it out, the market and stocks will go down, creating more of a buying opportunity for AQB. A 15% reduction from the current $4.36 price, would put it at $3.70! Historically, September is a down month."
AQB'S GREATEST LONG TERM DRIVER IS CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE DEVASTATING IMPACT THAT IS EXPECTED TO HAVE ON THE WORLD'S FISHERIES.
"Why o why OHIO? Ok, seriously, probably a good location. Easy access to lot of population/customers"
welcome new traders and investors ... it does not matter how AQB stock performs until it reports its next earnings. we will have an idea of the potential of its commercial harvest. this is like waiting for the results of the first batch of Tesla's out of the factory.
Load as much as possible you won’t regret !
"They need to do a better job of getting their story out. Just seems to be a news blackout for whatever reason. They have $200 mil in cash. Not an outlandish market cap considering the size of the salmon market and their growth potential. I like AppHarvest, but market cap at $1.6 B, which is outlandish, but they do great job of getting their story out. They also just joined the Russell….and issued press release about it and their CEO all over financial news media. There are some similarities in their business models….high tech indoor food production (they grow vegetables). I think AQB has much better barriers, and cost advantages over potential rivals than APPH does. Need better investor and media relations from AQB."
389 million market cap and over 200 million in cash. AQB is way undervalued at these prices. IMO
I like the stock
"I bought 2k shares 15 days ago at $2.99, so I'm up 56%. I've been tempted to sell now and take the gains, but looking back over the numbers I can't bring myself to sell. AQB still has enormous upside potential imo and I'm committing to at least a 5 year hold. Expecting at least 40% annual returns, why would I sell?"
Not looking good for you so far today doc! Kiss that 18% goodbye 
Are there any bad news we don't know about?
"8,619,409 shares guys 8,619,409 shares. Ark almost bought the whole company. I am glad we got in early. I can see this company trading at 5B valuation in near future, easily."
This stock is going nowhere until it can produce revenue 3 to 4 times a year. Currently it's just once a year.
Aqb is a very poorly run Company from Wulf on down.
wondering why this price shot up today
Way under value stock who agree ?
"The way I see it is Risk vs Reward always. Right now, I doubled down at 9.36 before, and again today at 9.45. we have maybe risk of going down to 8.50 where the offering is, but that is extremely unlikely already because new offerings are given to the big institutional investors. so I think the lowest this can go is 9$, but the reward, definitly can go back to all time highs of $12. Though I have my target in the $11s. thats pretty much a 4:1 reward for the risk tradeoff. And when the deals are all said and done, it'll be in prime position to start heading higher. Let's get this going friends! Best of luck"
"The seas are only getting more and more polluted. The seas are over fished to the point of disturbing the ecosystem. Salmon catches are smaller in numbers and in fish mass. The need for protein is growing larger than can be supplied. The only thing holding this company back is its ability to increase production. It will sell out everything it harvests. Once production is ramped up (and I have no idea when this happens), the public needs to be educated on the health and flavor benefits of AQB salmon. Actually, this marketing should be happening now and in a big way before competition is invited to the table. What management is doing is questionable as we don't seem to get any updated shareholder communications. They need to understand that no one makes money making stuff, only selling stuff."
"Strange to see this kind of price action with no news. Here is what I know:1) Volume was 2x the float which is not sustainable.2) Prior to today, shorts had borrowed all my shares although the 11% interest seems inadequate given this volume."
"AquaBounty will be donating an estimated 50,000 pounds of its conventional Atlantic salmon to Philabundance, a Philadelphia based hunger relief organization committed to ending hunger for good.COVID-19 has reduced the demand for salmon in restaurants and institutional feeding programs, and AquaBounty decided to use its excess supply of conventional salmon to help feed families affected by the economic downturn."

"Samuels & Sons, one of the largest seafood wholesalers in the United States, will be one of the first companies to buy and sell AquaBounty’s genetically engineered AquAdvantage salmon."
It seems from SEC filings that Catherine Wood of ARK had more than 8.6M shares back on 12.31.20. On 07.31.21 the number of shares came down to more than 6.6M shares.
I feel really sorry for the people who bought over $10
"I think that there's a big future for $AQB. The competition is very minimal, the company has a lot of room to grow, and it aligns with the narrative of having a smaller digital footprint to operate in comparison to other livestock field. Harper had only approved GM salmons in 2013. They had just established a location in the recent years in Canada. With the financial momentum $ABQ gained, they have the ability to expand even more in North America to which can expose them to Canadian retailers. This news article shows that Canadians have been consuming GM salmon from AquaBounty Tech with no concerns - https://thenarwhal.ca/gmo-salmon-canada/ . But do you DD before hoping in...."
Would be nice if they could get China to buy
"Great article just released, underscoring the benefits of the AquaBounty solution vs ocean farmed salmon.https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/farmed-atlantic-salmon-likely-passed-virus-to-wild-pacific-salmon-68822?utm_campaign=TS_Infectious%20Disease%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=137545450&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8dWFYBBURlUWO_Gq6KtYXWwE2xOzKCbX0YAejfKtL4ioT9BMsrv3ib811b4wjZYrtlBFfQw7UuFmdEzReOG-xNKaY0SBubUyrRVSXHMhd6OpDciiY&utm_content=137545450&utm_source=hs_email"
"CEO Sylvia Wulf should be disclosing the location of the New 10,000 metric ton facility to be built in the United States within the coming weeks, supposedly operational by 2023. Should give the stock a nice hike and attract more investors as they continue to prove commercialization by ramping up their month over month harvesting numbers from the Albany, Indiana location."
"1)This stock is going to $5 very soon. The insider purchasing says it all. Randall Kirk is buying bigtime. Let's not forget he successful launched Vyvanse, Viibryd, and worked at Scios who developed Xarelto. 2 major blockbuster FDA approved drugs in Vyvanse and Xarelto, and a solid product in Viibryd. One of the most successful people in American business history.2)Is it possible AQB will be supplying to the pharmaceutical industry on top of competing for the dinner plate? Dont be surprised given Randall Kirk's background. The FDA has recently given much broader approval for Vascepa, a drug derived from a particular Omega-fatty acid called EPA, and this approval will over time create massive global demand for EPA and naturally fish as a feedstock to create the drug. The results of the Reduce-It studies from the maker of Vascepa were astonishing for reducing cardiovascular risks and could well become as routinely dosed as statins over time. And can be dosed with statins. It's my hunch AQB will be ensuring a steady supply of EPA to Amarin, the maker of Vascepa. This is only a guess. Regardless, AQB and their salmon, along with future trout and tilapia offerings, will be a big, big winner from these prices. $5 in 1-2 years, $10 in 4 years or less. 2)"
"Baffled Oskar? The brain trust running this operation is a joke. They have lost money since inception in an otherwise very profitable industry. Their products are not selling well enough... Apparently the work environment is disagreeable, so they can't maintain employees. For some reason, wall street gave them 200 million more dollars to waste."
"Technical analysis suggested AQB was headed for $7. This drop has nothing to do with secondary offering. If anything, the secondary strengthens the stock as AQB needs the money for expansion and was bound to run out without it."
Nov 19 is not for share dilution. They are getting ready to increase production capacity which means they need capital. One way is to access the equity market and to do it they need more authorized shares that can be issued later on as the company grows. They can do this via project financing or equity issuance. They are just getting ready with more financing options.
"With Kirk out of the picture this is going to $1. Don't get me wrong, it's a great company that will make a good investment down the road, but with Kirk done funding and ARKG selling, future capital raises will be brutal."
Easy buy after having watched Seaspiracy on Netflix
Aqua! Wooo
"Way to Go AQB!Good News on Twitter today, “Samuels & Son Seafood to start selling AquaBounty GE Salmon starting in August!” The five tons Sold out in May must have made a good impression on the Restaurant Business! Time to ramp commercialization and show those growing revenues!!!This article can be found on Undercurrent News."
S-3 Filed.
Does Catherine Wood still own any of this stock??
5 star Oppenheimer analyst from Tipranks has given a outperform rating to Aquabounty and a 7$ price target saying they are leaders in their sector and sees a growing market.
"If this gets any lower, RJ is going to buy the ~40% of this company he doesn't already own and we are going to miss out on the reward that will come."
"At this low PPS, Cat Wood shud buy the entire company....current market bears fishing for value heading upstream"
"My investment decision towards start-ups is based on three facts: 1. Would the technology disrupt the market?2. Has the business got a strong leadership team?3. Is there regulatory show stops on the horizon? Based on what AQB has accomplished in the past 20+ years, I think this company has a very bright future and Ark invest agrees with my view. If you look at how much the founders of the business and institutional investors have invested in the past 48 months, you know its share price will pop very soon! However, having said that, investing start-up carries a high level of residual risks that a mature business doesn't have, but equally, the potential reward is also unparalleled. So people should do your own research and stop arguing something that only time can tell, investing in a business is a very personal decision. Good Luck all!"
Remain optimistic about the long term and I will buy more regardless of the hesitation from the GMO perceptions as protein scarcity worsens globally! USA Canada has high respect from consumers trust in healthy safe food sources! As a Doctor and a consumer I am scared of the fish coming from the rest of the world and the polluted places ! Regards.
Coverage initiated by Oppenheimer witrh $7.00 price target. Google if interested.
"Since harvest is only beginning now, it will not be known how profitable the company was until the 4th quarter when they post the financial results for the 3rd quarter. Anyone know what the wholesale price of salmon is currently? Multiplying wholesale price times the metric tons harvested should give a good approximation of income for the quarter."
Let’s go AQUA!!!!! So many would buy if they knew how. Like me!
I wouldn’t worry too much and just add more shares. This wil be 8 dollar before you know it.
Getting scared yet Doc?
"Stop with all the analysis. The only thing that matters is that AQB increases its production, its distribution and geographic footprint. When this product is available everywhere then it's game over. We win."
"easily a $50 stock, ark has millions if shares, a bit risky but low risk high reward imo"
Bracing for another secondary offering. Going to stockpile some cash to buy on the dip. https://aquabounty.gcs-web.com/node/9491/html
"Why is this going down! I see 7 coming soon, no?"
"What is going on with this stock and the people that are not investing but ""playing around with it"" can't even call them ""paper hands""......I am a long term investor and i just speechless with this price around below 6 USD at the present overall market conditions.....honestly unreal!!!"
"This company and its process isn't going away. The trend for organic is growing in leaps and bounds. Salmon is a global staple because it tastes good and one of the best sources of protein. AQB isn't a substitute like plant based meat. It's the real McCoy without the pollution from the sea or chemicals from most farmed salmon. It's organic farming. It may take a while for distribution to gear up, but it will and is happening. The key question is how will AQB market the product to retail and educate the public on its taste, quality, health benefits and how will it promote its brand."
Ark bought another 200k share yesterday. I just hope they won't buy the whole company.
"Friday the 13th a bit scary, buy buying the dip."
"Question from a beginner investor. AQB has a share offering coming up (we don't know exactly when). if the price their offering is lets say at 9, would that mean people would sell to make the price go down, and re pick up those shares at 9? Just trying to understand how offerings work. Thanks for any answers!"
"This amost a value stock now. Market doesnt give them credit for tilapia they have developed, and other species in the works. Risk/reward just too much to pass on. Bought more today at $4.56. Going to take time."
"Check out the news posted on June 1. Their salmon was fully committed to their customers. To me, that sounds like it they were sold out in Q2."
AQB will be on trend to hit $8 during holiday season by this year 4th Quarter.
"SWTSX - Schwab Total Stock Market Index Fund purchased 21,009 shares on 24th of June. There are still institutions buying. In fact in this month, there are 2 institutional purchase and 0 sold."
"I have avg at 10, so..."
https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/14/weather/extreme-heat-salmon-sacramento-river/index.html
SP is a yoyo. Means nothing. Good agricultural technology and top notch quality control will eventually win the day. World needs protein. AQB is the right solution at the right time. The key is educating the public on the benefits of engineered salmon and the negatives of sea farmed salmon.
Why won’t the stock go up seems to have great fundamentals
This could have an (of course adjusted) P/E by 2024 of 10 or less with a lot of growth ahead of them. It depends on their ability to execute and the price of salmon. And we have no reason to believe that they won't be able to execute and get their new plant up and running by 2023 with full scale harvest sometime in 2024.And that projected P/E is not even taking into account the possible JV partnerships.Of course they're gonna burn a lot of cash on new plants - but I sure hope they do so and stick to their plan for.If they're able to execute... the current share price is extremely cheap.
"Bought $AQB today after waiting a couple of weeks for a good entry, going to be long term, has a lot of potential"
The US is the number one exporter. At 330M valuation AQB is just free money
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-27/salmon-have-shrunk-so-much-that-whole-foods-redid-its-guidelines
"Unfortunately, looks like #AQB is headed lower, Probably a good idea to grab shares in the mid $4 range, seriously doubt Major Shareholders like Randall J. Kirk “Third Security” or #ArkInvest is going to let this drop in the toilet. The Owner’s are very Focused-on the Longterm and so should we, hope the earnings call and forward guidance will show a ramp up in sales and proof of commercialization!!!"
who likes salmon. so many people need to eat....the population is going thru the roof
"From FishFarmingExpert (online 04.08.21), Wulf (CEO) said the company was “actively progressing on potential opportunities in Israel and China”. I think this statement is more than just selling Salmon. What if there were a joint venture of sorts in either of those two countries where a future farm could be located? Something like that could send the stock through the roof."
PRE SOLD OUT purchase orders have been received for the planned harvest of 5 metric tons of its genetically engineered (GE) Atlantic salmon. The first harvest is scheduled to be conducted at the end of May from the Company’s Indiana farm. The Company will continue to ramp production to its full capacity throughout the year. AquaBounty is the first and only company in the world to raise and market a GE Atlantic salmon approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Health Canada.
I'm really surprised about the drop. I wish I had cash. They have around 200M in cash to build their next farm. If you count that into the market cap that leaves a market cap at around 100M lol... for such a promising compnay. I'm baffled.
With this big of a move one has to wonder if Cathy is dumping
"Looking forward to Q2 Financials soon, they said they sold out of their 1st salmon run."
"I just ordered salmon at the restaurant this week, $38. Do the math, decades of work put into this, now is the time to reap the harvest..."
"Ramping up? AquaBounty is hiring Aquaculture Processing Associates and Aquaculture Production Associates at the Albany, Indiana farm."
yahoo don't even bother to publish news anymore sad
frankly they shld delist to save sone dignity for themselves
I'm Bullish on the company but the CEO really needs to step her game on how she presents this company. I've heard her say countless times about how they need to get their story out but then when she is given the opportunity she provides very little detail on why AQB has a superior product and business model.
product is fantastic but sad to see stock dying
"8 months ago, covering AquaBounty for National Research, analyst Ben Klieve writes, “We believe AQB has the most disruptive proprietary product of any emerging company across the food chain today, and view the Atlantic Salmon market as uniquely suited for disruption… we believe the enhanced growth characteristics of AAS via advanced genetics will enable AQB to balance the logistical, environmental, and economic considerations more effectively than any peer in the market today.”Nothing has changed. AQB is still an important biotech agricultural company that will be able to provide the world quality, chemical free protein at competitive pricing."
"Once again, inconsistent volume. Absolutely no PR. AQB needs to start building a brand name. It needs to start educating the public and retail sector on its benefits and start really differentiating itself from competition. They need to speak up on the significance of their new production facility and what it means in terms of sales and the expansion of its geographic footprint. Executive management needs to get out there. Management's silence is a missed opportunity."
"Check Aquabounty, ticker $AQB, next reddit stock,"
"In theory, the share offering shouldn't matter because it helps a company that has good future prospects. I haven't seen this in practice with small caps like this however. Any recommendation on moves centered around the upcoming dilution? Planning on staying long & not adding unless there is a large drop"
"I'm Japanese, and salmon is very popular in Japan. Is there a high demand for salmon in the United States?"
Haha… Let’s have a moment of silence for the money ‘Doctor’ lost today … sorry shorty. Cash out now or be prepared to lose even more!
"AQB has inherent cost advantages. Most of competition is from norway, chile etc. higher the feed, transportation (oil), just plays into their model of operation. Even the companies operating here require nearly double the feed and growth time to harvest. Inflation in everything, including other protein sources is a big win for them. Hopefully, the market will start to recognize this."
"At this price, AQB will easily beat SP500 and Nasdaq"
"A few more thoughts regarding Aquabounty, I'd welcome your view. 1. Global salmon consumption is at around 4 million tons at the moment;2. The US consumes about 400 metric tons, Canada consumes about 30 tons (based on population);3. AQB currently has licences to produce and sells in the US and Canada respectively; 4. The company claims on the trajectory to reach a production capacity of 100 metric tons by 2021;Conclusion, purely based on the numbers and what's available on the Internet and assume those numbers are accurate, AQB will start a price war on wholesale salmon price and this is strongly supported by its shortened maturity cycle (from 36 months to 13 months) and efficient feeding modification ( 23% less than the traditional farming technology). The million-dollar question remains, would the mass public buy same look/taste and healthier (no antibiotics are used in the feed) salmon fish at 50% of the price? p.s. Critically, without being picked up by the mainstream media and environmental activities trying to shut down its production before it goes big.I think they have a fair good chance (greater than 50%) of achiving this."
"Obviously, this u-shaped chart every day is heaven for swing traders. Even though there seems to be a delay in announcing the first commercial harvest, I feel strong about long-term growth of AQB as further supported by ARK keep loading up at even higher price ($8 - $9 / share) than what they initially paid ($2 - $4 / share)"
Has the location for farm 3 been decided yet? When will the dilute again for that. All I’ve found is the May IP info.
Check out these salmon dying in the Columbia river and tell me this company isn't on to something? https://youtu.be/Oz3KTUKVbN4
Scaling is the problem here. They should have couple of another kettles to grow amazing gm product they have.
ARK INV. BOUGHT 6M Shares (13G filling.)
Let s all promote AQB in the Wsb reddit thread for the 2 of July
Wow why e big drop
Thoughts: https://thecounter.org/americas-biggest-retailers-foodservice-companies-gmo-salmon-aquabounty/
"I like the ER today, added some more today at 4.57, and will hold at least for 2-3 years."
"I have asked several seafood/meat counter personnel at different grocery stores when/if they will start selling the Aquabounty Advantage salmon….they have zero knowledge of this product! I think it might help if customers start asking them to carry it. Going to be reluctance for awhile, afraid of gmo etc. They are busy people, but need to be educated a little on this! Everyone start asking about it, might start to change things"
"New investor here, what are our plans for expansion and future growth, our we keeping the R&D development going on other species of seafood to bring to market?"
A lot of people lost lox of money on this one.
taste same as regular salmon
Great news - Samuels and Son beginning AquAdvantage salmon sales this month
Just added some more a couple days ago at $4.82. I think this company has a bright future
"Here are the relevant headlines for today in relation to AQB, please share your view about today's trading pattern? 1. US jobless claim jumped to three months high;2. Christmas is seven days away and COVID vaccination is underway; 3. ARK's holding remained at 6,986,252, no buying or selling on 17th December.Do you think it will break and stay above the $8 resistance? Yes or No, please share your view!Good luck! Richard"
https://apnews.com/article/whole-foods-market-inc-lifestyle-health-coronavirus-pandemic-technology-a4ef4f24801f62ac65918e4560d7eb8aHarvest is in... and naysayers are in full riot. The bottom line is the harvest is sold out and FDA approved!
"Worldwide, Atlantic salmon populations in single rivers range from thousands to nearly a quarter million. However, some populations are small, numbering in the low hundreds or even single individuals. The endangered Gulf of Maine DPS has declined significantly since the late 19th century."
Don’t like the price action. Market probable figuring another share offering in the works. More dilution
Big News Today: AQB Electric Salmon To Power NIO and TSLA New Cars
"AQB won’t be truly profitable till Farm 3 is online and scales to their capable maximum run rate. In the meantime we will find upward movement in the stock price when AQB eventually mentions JV Partnerships perhaps in Israel, Brazil, or China where they’re currently in discussions with active AquaFarm companies. Israel sounds like the most Exciting as they’re home to some sophisticated and large scale AquaFarm companies. Eventual News should bring music to Investors!"
No worries. Buy dip and hold for long. Patience will be paid.
"Can anyone do math? 230k on 5 metric tons, at a farm with a 1200 metric ton capacity....1200÷5= 240. 240× 230,000 = 55,000,000."
"the levels of market manipulation are so evident here. the company has already said they plan on issuing 40% equity to finance their new farm, which amounts to $40m in new shares. they then get authorization to have 80m shares outstanding. now a mystery run off of 100% in a week. the inevitable offering will come within the next few weeks at an artificially inflated price. the company has already missed it's target of harvesting their AAS in ""late October"" as their CFO claimed at an investor conference. anyone investing short term needs to be careful"
Good price to load up under $6.
"As AquaBounty nears the first harvest of its genetically engineered AquAdvantage salmon, the company has started sending samples to its first customers this week for a final quality check before orders are finalized.Seafood experts working with about 10 retail and foodservice companies looking to be the first to carry AquAdvantage salmon will be checking the samples for overall quality, flavor, color, and texture, and selecting which available fish size will work well for their market, according to AquaBounty CEO and President Sylvia Wulf."
5 star Oppenheimer analyst from Tipranks has given a outperform rating to Aquabounty and a 7$ price target saying they are leaders in their sector and sees a growing market. 
"Have you gone to Costco for salmon? Not long ago the 3 piece pack was $10. Now it's almost $30!!! Once AQB proves the model they can do partnerships and go global. A half a cart of groceries in So. Cal is $95. When inflation jacks up the price of food AQB salmon will be a better commodity than gold, which doesn't have flavor or protein."
To the earth's core!!!
Increased my position to 2400 shares. Will happily add more if it drops lower. This will be 10 dollars in 12 months. Quote me on it.
Shorted this thing at $6. Going to low $4s easy!
"Not to sound apocalyptic, but fish are going down hard in numbers (some will be extinct) , and this company has the apparatus to make massive profits as prices rise and logistics become an issue."
"the whole market is down, many companies and individuals selling their entire portfolios to get into meme stocks. if you want a quick buck gamble with those but I prefer making long term steady profits. I believe in this company, I see the future potential, that's why I stay long and buy low when I can. this price is a God given gift"
I can't believe there is nobody on this message board. AQB is about to explode on this deal to sell to Samuels and Son. One of the largest seafood distributors using Aquabounty.
No longer care about reading short term bashers. I'm a long term believer. AQB is a future supplier of sustainable protein in a world that is diminishing its sources of protein. It may take awhile but this is the future. Go with God. Long and Strong.
"Stock will be included in Russell 3000 index on 6/28. After market close today its added. I am surprised investors didnt front run this knowing it is going to be added. Well, lets hope this starts getting more attention starting 6/28."
Negative people will think that it is a dumping move.. positive people will think that there will be a great news coming out and shareholders are preparing to sell at great price.. So depending on which are you.. enjoy your trade
Seems no bottom
"New site finally chosen in Pioneer, Ohio! Capacity of 8X that if the Indiana facility. Construction to start by the end of the year, reaching first harvest by 2023. This will finally get this past a 5 dollar stock that the shorties keep manipulating!"
"Bought 5000 shares in pre market at 9 ................ wish me luck,"
Buying a few shares today.Like the company having no debt.
"So now we learned that the heavy redemptions from ARK investors resulted in a lot of selling. The investors who “front run” those stocks, dump them or take profits. Underlying all this is the rotation into commodities, inflation protection assets etc. none of this changes the fundamental story of these companies. We might see additional volatility. Good chance to buy more shares. I think AQB is on radar of a lot of investors now and will move up or down based upon news. How are they going to sell their product...and how receptive the consumer is will be key. They have such a wide moat, and already have tilapia developed and are working on other species. With the recent funds raised ($8.50/sh), and R.Kirk as major investor I am fine waiting."
"7% pre, what’s up with that?? "
bad management but good business model I will stick whit the company and hoping for better management decision 
Momentum to $11+ Thoughts
"Here is a clever comment ""AQB's salmon have been genetically modified to consume more feed in the early stages of growth which allows them to reach market size in 18 months as opposed to 24-36 months. Throughout the salmon's lifecycle, they end up consuming 25% less feed compared to conventional salmon. This makes AQB 2x more profitable than companies producing conventional salmon.The mainstream public is misinformed about GMO's, but that's where the opportunity is. Once the public realizes that GMO's are not a bad thing, it will be too late to invest.Population is growing, demand for seafood is increasing... the natural ecosystems won't be able to sustain this. AQB is working on new species and are expanding to Brazil, Argentina, Israel and China.The global salmon market is about $16 billion dollars. If AQB gets just 10% of that, that's $1.6 billion in revenue per year. Apply a 12x multiple to sales and you end up with a $19.2 billion dollar market cap.At a $500mil valuation, this is a no brainer stock."""
We have more than double that in cash per share.
"Nice 4,5% aftermarket. Publicity wil make this move."
"Won't this offering help them grow faster in the end? I mean, the faster they have working mass production facility, the faster they will be able to have reasonable earnings."

This is not a flip company. This is a buy and hold for dividends. This is the type of stock you dump your profit into from other trades. In 25 years the dividends will be ripe. Buy add more hold and pass on for future generations.
"‘DOCTOR’ is getting scared. Cherishing that 18%…. Sell your short now, it’s only going to get smaller in the next few months"
"The fact that every salmon fish ever harvested by this company was sold immediately to a still-unsatisfied demand curve says it all. Solve the scalability challenge, and this goes parabolic."

"$AQB Lots of buyers, not many sellers. I trust the smart money ARK and the like are doing their DD and buying more shares. AQB may get government funding because it's a green sustainable product."
"I work in the field of eco-technology and can say that aquabounty is the only sustainable way forward. Gene mutation is a natural process, AquaBounty just happened to speed it up! I prefer my fish slightly altered but without antibiotics and grown in water, not the lab! AquaBounty the only way to go in the industry"
"Always amazes me the praise that is heaped upon this Company on this board in light of the Company bleeding money quarter after quarter. It is not like they are just starting out, they have been at this for many years. They have not even been close to being profitable on a smaller scale and now they plan to lose money on a larger scale. Will all these capital expenditures pan out? I think not."
l still hope this stock goes back up around 10 before Christmas . am I too optimist?
