"Is this another SOS, EBON and many others that have pumped and then dumped?"
$4.5 incoming today get in now
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
"I mean, $PBTS is below 1.4, not much of a risk here."
this will hit below 1$ soon
buying more
"Another 1.4% dip for PBTS, what is up with this market"
"$PBTS 72M market cap, it's below $2 rn. Definitely has room to grow"
This is the easiest stock to game ever
Does anyone believe? I know I do!!!
what a pump a dump by a chinese company. don't fall for it. china ccp is banning mining.

Once it hits 1.10 we can all start an injection.
new BTC & ETH operations = new target price?
who else shorted at the top
What's up
https://discord.gg/X4c32M5
Why are we still at 1.9-2
$3 coming...
500$ tomorrow
I now alert $PBTS at around 1.3 and look how far it will run in the next few months. PBTS will mine crypto.
"$pbts, $any, $sos, $sprt all have huge potential to become primary BTC miners, some will go up on Monday if BTC reaches 47k during during the weekend. Same story with $riot and $mara."
"Not sure what this news means for $PBTS, I take it it's a right step for its crypto + blockchain operations"
https://discord.com/invite/A7YtaA95kA
So are these 2500 rigs a bonus? We're still waiting on the 5600 other ones right ? In Portugal or something?
Stock price goes down when good news comes out. Typical. #stocks
"PBTS is bouncing back, buy it now!"
Anyone know how many miners they will run ?Or if they have any current Bitcoin holdings ??
https://discord.gg/QDBEcMBy
This hit the bottom and ready to squeeze. It can easily make 3x - 5x. Almost %0 downside risk. Crypto play. Low float. Half of the shares are shorted. What else do we need for a short squeeze?
Where did all the PUMPERS GO
Looks like a nice run on $PBTS is inbound Monday. Watching $BITF $COIN and $CTRM
STHC...going to fly with shell
"$PBTS is seeing a lot of resistance, a bounce back is imminent"
With so much volume this play is way too intriguing.

"I know $PBTS is up but keep holding, DO NOT sell now. It's only gonna go up with all the great news coming out."
Target : 10USD
Excited for this new week for $PBTS
Wow lost all the gain from yesterday
Red by close
"All ABOARRRD!!! Next stop, $1,33!!!!!"
"Market is down, don't worry about the little PBTS's dip just hold or buy more"
And the pump is over
What is your target price for the next week or month?
The entire market is red and PBTS is up? tf??
So many Chinese companies are mining now? Does PBTS have enough cash to purchase more mining gigs?
"Whooooo shorts are trapped , buy buy buy !!!!!! $5 coming fast"
this is just warming up for tomorrow
$PBTS almost back to where I was loading up at 1.28 If you’re loading up now you might be in this for a while. I was in this for a month before it made its move up 1.28 to over $2 it’ll most likely happen again but could be a long wait
"Beautiful moves $PBTS and squeeze inbound, average at the support and maximize those gains. Check ortex and fintel, looks like reversal inbound on $TMC"
who's selling not me
will hit $9.00 today
"if you read whats said on YF all of this is being caused because of the eventual failure of Chinas Evergrande land develoer.mark my words, China isnt going to allow them to crash and will soon pick up the tab, seize the comoany and either run it through the government, or re-distribute it into more capable hands.its going to take time, but it WILL happen.China is NOT keen on faliure!!!"
so much volume yesterday...what a ripped off company
Looks like a possible squeeze on $PBTS and $IMTE 0 shares left to short. Holding AMC and $GME $NOK
"This is insane, $PBTS charts identical and same PR not too long ago. Next up??"
Going back below a dollar now.
waiting for 1.10
"Market is down, don't worry about PBTS's dip just hold or buy more"
So quiet here PUMPERS HAVE MOVED ON
"PBTS have a very solid team and increasing their mining activity is a good choice, their revenue will go up and my stocks will go up. Cheers!"

Can someone tell me the share float of this ticker PBTS ?
Is this news gonna change anything? $PBTS was already doing alright. This stock can't dip much more right?
"PBTS is seeing a lot of resistance, a bounce back is imminent"
"If i have mor money, i will not hesitate to buy now, this will fly by tomorrow or monday, inshallah"
"Another 5% dip for PBTS, what is up with this market"
$PBTS on a wild rollercoaster today.
"Red season, hold strong my PBTS gang!"
"I have no idea what FXOS is, but I feel it can bring PBTS back to $3!"
"Aminer in China, I thought China banned mining?"
The pump is over get out
"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Fairstox.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I don’t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"
Powerbridge plans to invest and engage in the cryptocurrency mining for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) with planned operations globally!
"In the last time that PBTS was pumping, the next target for pump was LMFA."
Had to buy today. Like the crypto angle too!
Alright team PBTS hope you’re ready for the launch because we’re going to space!
Gonna hit 3 today
$PBTS has some very advanced tech for their mining and blockchain operations. Today's news might not mean much but it's a step in the right direction. I'm hoping this stock will turn it around by the end of the year.
Today - PBTS.Tomorrow - LMFA.Be ready!!!
"2's must be done, not getting back there again looks like."
Sigh.Remind me to sell at 1.60 next time.
"PBTS , Profitable low floater AMS ($2,6) has second Quarter 2021 net income $0.03 per diluted share (excluding the net charge) and is one of the most most undervalued low floaters in the market right now."
Green at open. Go longs.
"should've bought more PBTS at $1.2, still a good time to get in?"
will it go above $1.5 in few days?.....Huge loss again
"The 3,600 Ethereum miners Powerbridge is buying include high performance RTX 3070, RTX 3060 Ti and other models, representing an expected hash rate of 1,700 gigahash per second. Earlier this summer, Powerbridge caught the attention of retail investors on Reddit message boards, who targeted the company in an effort to collectively bid the stock higher and make a quick profit.Shares of Powerbridge Technologies at last check fell 2.2% to $1.36. They have traded on Wednesday up as much as 18% at $1.64. They were off 41% in 2021 through the close of Tuesday trading."
"I guess the crypto news is true, PBTS to $10 EOY?"
Break thru
"PBTS is one of the Chinese mining stocks with good potential, good cash flow to buy more miners, and a capable management team. Don't worry about the crypto market, just keep holding!"
https://discord.gg/ajsNXD8P
"PBTS mining ETH and BTC, gg time to get in!"
Just purchased at 1.2686 to average out my previous order of 2.10. This will rise again
$2.00 tomorrow???!
if the mining news is true then I'm buying more and holding til EOM at least
$PBTS's mining and blockchain operations are legit. FXOS is a great tool for crypto mining. I'm hoping this stock will turn it around before their next earnings.
all crypto miners are down today... Monday it is!
Read the news people. They are goin to setup a major mining operation in the USA!!!!Once this in operation the revenue is going to be astounding.
The thing about this company is that you need to be in for the long term.
$3 coming squeeze
Go green
This looks like an easy one to short. I'll wait until this is pumped over $1.40 again then ride it back down.
I heard about PBTS the other day on (http://Fairstox.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
A whole lot of companies mentioning crypto to get a rise lately. This company being based in China I wouldn't buy in with recent government regulations.
"PBTS has the potential to be a major player in the crypto space, lots of $$ to buy mining gigs for insane hashrates"
"Buying more PBTS tomorrow, do it uppp"

PBTS what are you doing!!??
go to $0.50 and I buy
very nice move towards $0.00
https://discord.com/invite/XDgZnRPD
This one got a lot of juice left.
Feels like new base at $2 before jump to $3
"my broker given path for few stocks ...all are down (LMFA, PBTS, NAOV,),...and now he is saying we need to wait for 6 months to 1 year to see the profit. Great loss.....why they are doing like this"
"I’ve held PBTS since may and I almost sold during the July spike but honestly, I’m glad I didn’t. There’s so much potential and before we know it, prices will have skyrocketed."
https://discord.gg/68FYvTQ
is this supposed to rise with BTC even though they didn't start mining yet ?
Holding the bag I don’t know I keep average down
"This thing just doesnt make sense. I would think that it would follow or work opposite of BTC's sp, but it doesnt!So what does it follow?"
"All aboard, PBTS is getting ready for liftoff!"
Is it going to climb again ?!
I can see PBTS going back to $3
holy smokes that's some volume
I purchased @2.10....now it is going down...by any chance will it go up tomorrow?....Unfortunately i cant wait for more than 2 days....
The future is looking bright for $PBTS
"Beautiful moves today on $BITF and $PBTS and squeeze inbound again, hit $4 last time. And at all time lows. Watching $COIN tmo for calls"
"A year from now when my investment have multiplied by 69, I’m buying my own chocolate fountain."
Squeeze inbound on $PBTS last time ran hard. Check charts! $SDC $ATER $GME
Is this already the moon?
I bought a little of this in premarket for fun and I am surprised most of my gain is still holding up. These stocks are a complete gamble and the bet is will the Chinese manipulation work in my trade’s favor or not! 
I heard about PBTS the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
The longer term trend shows these spikes diminishing over time.
Not even close yet red already
"PBTS is one of the newer companies that started mining crypto in China. Lots of cashflow and a strong team. Now with Michael Zhao's addition, their mining operations should perform really really well and this is on top of their other operations. Michael's previously worked at MSFT so his knowledge in blockchain tech shouldn't be overlooked. $1.30 is a very good price to get in, anything below $2 is a bargain tbh. Keep an eye on this stock."
https://discord.gg/qSyYwuR
They had some interesting insights about PBTS on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
You're still buying this Scam? See you at .70 cents next week.
Chinese stock
now is a good time to get in
China just shut down all mining operations nationwide !!!
"Red day when good news comes out, sad. Great addition for PBTS tho."
Is PBTS a safe play this week at $1.3?
Squeeze will happen around $2.5. Then we see $3 in a blink
"I'm confused as to why so many Chinese companies are mining crypto when the govt has an eye on it all the time. But on the other hand, mining would generate an enormous amount of revenue. PBTS is a bit risky but not a bad play imo when it's at $1.3."
Big gains today
"So happy I bought in last month, I’ll continue to add more to my portfolio."

Anyone buying Chinese mining stocks? Should be an interesting week for $PBTS as they begin utilizing FXOS
going down towards $1.60
goooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Sure - drop 4 cents right after I bought 8700 shares!! What kind of a thank you is that?
"Wow, one week, one great news! We can see some positive changes with these news soon or later."
"$PBTS Eth mining efficiency increases by 15%, that’ll generate $$$"
Nothing else matters until this can break $1.33.Then we might be off to the races.
game changer news! crypto!
"Tell me if I have this right - im thinking that when BTC is down, thats the time the mining would accellerate??So if BTC is down wouldnt PBTS's sp start growing?"
We are going to close at the high of the day then rocket tomorrow!
This is the new short squeeze target of WSB ! I just saw they are talking about it in their discord group. Get ready.
I'd get more $PBTS this week if I had more cash
"PBTS up 4.5%, nice!"
Dammm
can PBTS be a big player in the crypto space?
Telling you boys and girls... Under 30 cents is coming.
It's guaranteed money if you short them on the spike-ups
Stay above 2$ today tomorrow $3
Great news about crypto space. Only issue is the company is based in China. China just shut down all mining operations nationwide. So. How does this fly. ??
Going down as always
"$PBTS seems to be at a big discount right now, buy more?"
"How did $PBTS manage to get that many 3070 and 3060 Ti? The crypto market is SOOO hot right now, these mining gigs will bring so much profit to them and Michael Zhao is on board. Future is definitely looking good for them."
"As per Level II data, it looks like not even moving towards $3. Its struglling between 1.90 to 2.10"
Squeeze inbound on $PBTS watching at open. See what $CEI $DATS $WKHS do today
"This is the bottom for PBTS, comeback season has returned!!"
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SHCO
Thought on buying ?
After pumping finish PBTS will be $ 11.67 . REDDIT & The Street are watching it .
"PBTS down again, buy the dip?"
Sell sell sell
"PBTS what a great day for this one, on fire https://valuemarket.exchange/bhj6xz"
"Looks like $PBTS next to squeeze check Ortex data, and charts like to sell off then run. I opened a position :) $PROG $BBIG $ANY"
Still trying to learn more about this new FXOS but $PBTS is looking rather promising despite this dip. They keep pumping out good news and the stock price just keeps trending down just like the market.
"PBTS is a long term hold, below 1.5 is a great price to get in. EOY $7.50 target price is very possible. Chinese stocks might be risky but PBTS is in crypto mining now. They have the money to purchase enough crypto miners to make a huge profit and beat their earnings."
It’s a good time to invest in Bitcoin miners. This is even cheaper than $any.
might get some shares if PBTS trends up after earnings
Look out above ! YEH YEH
"This is insane hut is up over 10% and $BITF struggle over 5%…. I own both but weird, more bullish on $PBTS shorts attacking squeeze imminent"
