Back under $1
really incredible run here
"$PBTS seems to be at a big discount right now, buy more?"
$PBTS on a wild rollercoaster today.
"Anyone looking at this should consider that when the THOUSANDS of mining rigs their subsidiary deploys in North America and Hong Kong are activated, the re venue generated from them is going to be phenomenal.You can bank on that!!!"
Sure - drop 4 cents right after I bought 8700 shares!! What kind of a thank you is that?
this is just warming up for tomorrow
$PBTS's mining and blockchain operations are legit. FXOS is a great tool for crypto mining. I'm hoping this stock will turn it around before their next earnings.
Climate change problems here - how will they make money?
Anyone buying Chinese mining stocks? Should be an interesting week for $PBTS as they begin utilizing FXOS
"if you read whats said on YF all of this is being caused because of the eventual failure of Chinas Evergrande land develoer.mark my words, China isnt going to allow them to crash and will soon pick up the tab, seize the comoany and either run it through the government, or re-distribute it into more capable hands.its going to take time, but it WILL happen.China is NOT keen on faliure!!!"
"Powercrypto expects to complete the deployment of 2,600 high-performance mining rigs in Hong Kong, encompassing 600 high-performance BTC mining machines with a hashrate of approximately 60 PH/s, and 2,000 high-performance ETH mining machines with a hashrate of approximately 1,000 GH/s.Sean Wang, Powercrypto's General Manager and Chief Technology Officer, stated that: ""Powercrypto is a major strategic move by the Company to highlight our global presence in the crypto-mining business. We will focus on enhancing our overall hashrate level in BTC and ETH mining by setting up mining fleets in North America and Asia.""Powerbridge Technologies President Stewart Lor, commented, ""We are very excited about our launch and positioning as a global presence in the cryptocurrency mining business. We expect our high-performance environmental-friendly crypto-mining fleets to significantly accelerate our revenue."""
who else shorted at the top
Squeeze will happen around $2.5. Then we see $3 in a blink
Load up guyzz..
Go to #PBTS. THIS is also related to DWAC.
PREPARE FOR BLAST$GME $AMC $PBTS $BBIG
"Someone keeps spiking it up to empty the books, probably doing fairly expensive research, but it always implodes back down within a few hours."
"PBTS is one of the newer companies that started mining crypto in China. Lots of cashflow and a strong team. Now with Michael Zhao's addition, their mining operations should perform really really well and this is on top of their other operations. Michael's previously worked at MSFT so his knowledge in blockchain tech shouldn't be overlooked. $1.30 is a very good price to get in, anything below $2 is a bargain tbh. Keep an eye on this stock."
Just like I said new low everyday my bag is super heavy
"Powerbridge Technologies Co., Ltd. (PBTS) is the kind of stock that pops 200% towards the upside pre-market, before you have a chance to buy one single share.... The problem is, you have to own the shares before they go up..."
Why all haters
So quiet here PUMPERS HAVE MOVED ON
This is the easiest stock to game ever
"PBTS what a great day for this one, on fire https://valuemarket.exchange/bhj6xz"
The entire market is red and PBTS is up? tf??
This one day soon will be trading with the same market cap as $RIOT and $MSTR .. longterm price target for me is $60 pps
Up 12% for the day. This is looking very good.
Can you imagine having the job of maintainong 2600 computers? Im gussing that he wouldnt be a very easy one to live around!!!
When we can get some profit????
"I mean, $PBTS is below 1.4, not much of a risk here."
The thing about this company is that you need to be in for the long term.
"What an incredible day. $PHUN, $CDEV, $DWAC, and $PBTS all doing well today with $CPE and $ALLO making nice comebacks in the final hour. I close out the week with enough profit to buy a second Florida beach condo. Maybe I'll rent it out to Gladiator and Papito. Have a great weekend all!"
"PBTS , Profitable low floater AMS ($2,6) has second Quarter 2021 net income $0.03 per diluted share (excluding the net charge) and is one of the most most undervalued low floaters in the market right now."
Come to $PBTS
"Looks like $PBTS going to squeeze again, volumes in and shorts trapped. Insane moves on $DWAC today wow.. Crypto sold off aggressively earlier… $COIN cooling down"
"Is this another SOS, EBON and many others that have pumped and then dumped?"
Had to buy today. Like the crypto angle too!
new BTC & ETH operations = new target price?
"This will soar.so will seed,it has a 3.7 million share float"
Are you ready for the long journey?
"my broker given path for few stocks ...all are down (LMFA, PBTS, NAOV,),...and now he is saying we need to wait for 6 months to 1 year to see the profit. Great loss.....why they are doing like this"
You have to share your good picks Papito. I told everyone to buy $PBTS on Friday. Now it's soaring.
10k shares @ $1.04. Lets ride this for a few weeks/months.
Here we go!!
Read the news people. They are goin to setup a major mining operation in the USA!!!!Once this in operation the revenue is going to be astounding.
THIS IS THE WAY
what's the price target?
wait till the mining news comes out
Looking forward to another good day.
Feel like $BITF and $PBTS going to run today.. and $COIN $HUT
Buy and hold.
"US Gov will use this company in 2022 if congress passes less restrictive laws for online currency monetary flow. This will be the company related to the Fed reserves coin, as well as Eth & Bit. Have a nice day ;) can't wait for next year"
This hit the bottom and ready to squeeze. It can easily make 3x - 5x. Almost %0 downside risk. Crypto play. Low float. Half of the shares are shorted. What else do we need for a short squeeze?
Buy now
"This is insane, $PBTS charts identical and same PR not too long ago. Next up??"
"I'm confused as to why so many Chinese companies are mining crypto when the govt has an eye on it all the time. But on the other hand, mining would generate an enormous amount of revenue. PBTS is a bit risky but not a bad play imo when it's at $1.3."
"Whooooo shorts are trapped , buy buy buy !!!!!! $5 coming fast"
$PBTs get in before it is too late
Hahah seems like $PBTS and $XELA like to run together
getting ready 
Volume good
"Looks like $PBTS next to squeeze check Ortex data, and charts like to sell off then run. I opened a position :) $PROG $BBIG $ANY"
https://discord.gg/KwYYs2yv
"I only have 3000 shares in it at 1.2$, i wanted to load 20k more shares but founds will be available tomorrow, so sadly will be too late. will just load 2000 extra shares instead of 20k shares Just in Case I Am buying into PUMP AND DUMP lol"
"Buy buy buy, this will be 6+"
So are these 2500 rigs a bonus? We're still waiting on the 5600 other ones right ? In Portugal or something?
Still trying to learn more about this new FXOS but $PBTS is looking rather promising despite this dip. They keep pumping out good news and the stock price just keeps trending down just like the market.
added more
With so much volume this play is way too intriguing.
Squeeze inbound on $PBTS watching at open. See what $CEI $DATS $WKHS do today
Is this news gonna change anything? $PBTS was already doing alright. This stock can't dip much more right?
Big drop
Is this already the moon?
"Next runners (still early) may be $AGC $PBTS $LEV, again.. only if you like making money"
What a great start to my day. I bought yesterday at $1.15 and the price is at 1.67
"Wow, look at the 5 day chart!!! Whoopeee!!"
"$pbts, $any, $sos, $sprt all have huge potential to become primary BTC miners, some will go up on Monday if BTC reaches 47k during during the weekend. Same story with $riot and $mara."
Does anyone believe? I know I do!!!
Iceberg. Appropriately named hedge fund. They'll go down like they hit an iceberg shorting a dollar stock that could easily go up 10X or more if it catches fire.
"Good luck today guys. If you buy, please hold. This is still a good entry price and there is money to be made. Good luck everyone and please ignore the bashers. They are probably shorting the stock and do not want to lose their shirts."
This is the new short squeeze target of WSB ! I just saw they are talking about it in their discord group. Get ready.
Blessings
go to $0.50 and I buy
Squeeze inbound on $PBTS last time ran hard. Check charts! $SDC $ATER $GME
"As per Level II data, it looks like not even moving towards $3. Its struglling between 1.90 to 2.10"
"Beautiful moves today on $BITF and $PBTS and squeeze inbound again, hit $4 last time. And at all time lows. Watching $COIN tmo for calls"
"This is insane hut is up over 10% and $BITF struggle over 5%…. I own both but weird, more bullish on $PBTS shorts attacking squeeze imminent"
Will end up bad... CHINA Stock... 20Cents then OTC ... like YRIV
$PBTS has some very advanced tech for their mining and blockchain operations. Today's news might not mean much but it's a step in the right direction. I'm hoping this stock will turn it around by the end of the year.
Will it go back to $2.10 ...i invested and huge loss
"Market is down, don't worry about the little PBTS's dip just hold or buy more"
Looks like a nice run on $PBTS is inbound Monday. Watching $BITF $COIN and $CTRM
"Hong Kong mining Will boost finally this stock! It Is undervalued at 1.00 USD, not a few..."

Should be back below a dollar around closing time today.

First $DWAC took the attention off $AMC. Then $PHUN. Now $PBTS. They’re doing everything they can to get us to sell. these plays are childs play once our rocket takes off!
who's selling not me
Going down as always
Who else loading up $ONTX looks like a squeeze inbound!! Same with $PBTS let’s goo!! $AMC $CLOV
can PBTS be a big player in the crypto space?
We are going to close at the high of the day then rocket tomorrow!
https://discord.gg/Ascc4ZAx
"So happy I bought in last month, I’ll continue to add more to my portfolio."
Alright team PBTS hope you’re ready for the launch because we’re going to space!
"All aboard, PBTS is getting ready for liftoff!"
Red by close
I purchased @2.10....now it is going down...by any chance will it go up tomorrow?....Unfortunately i cant wait for more than 2 days....
Easy to way 3 dollor
"So, can the pumpers pump again Monday so I can sell this #$%$"
"Short playing risky game with this one, never ever underestimate Hong Kong"
Metx high risk. risks of getting delisted off Nasdaq trading below $1. #PBTS better play
I couldnt believe it when I bought in at 1.37 and it dropped to 1.34 right after that!!Just as I was hoping Im back to my buy price to top off the day!!!Im hoping we all have a good Friday!!
Gonna hit 3 today
Wack
Hold it guys it will touch 2$
"PBTS is a long term hold, below 1.5 is a great price to get in. EOY $7.50 target price is very possible. Chinese stocks might be risky but PBTS is in crypto mining now. They have the money to purchase enough crypto miners to make a huge profit and beat their earnings."
Great news about crypto space. Only issue is the company is based in China. China just shut down all mining operations nationwide. So. How does this fly. ??
"I know $PBTS is up but keep holding, DO NOT sell now. It's only gonna go up with all the great news coming out."
Today #PBTS. THIS will go over 1000% up today.
"If i have mor money, i will not hesitate to buy now, this will fly by tomorrow or monday, inshallah"
Is PBTS a safe play this week at $1.3?
"HI Guys,Saw this stock as a potential squeeze. 7.9 million float, 32.47% short and a short ratio of 1.84. It looks like this has some possibilities. What do you guys think? Thanks,"
Today 4$
Let's go Brandon!
I am sick of all the spam on yahoo! I actually try to stay off of the PBTS message board now and exclusively use http://the-alphatrader.com/
What else does this company do besides the crypto mining?
"something is cooking and i want to be EARLY, bought 20k shares at 0.64 ENJOY THE RIDE$CSCW $DWAC $PBTS $GME $AMC"
"PBTS is bouncing back, buy it now!"
no $3 or 4 or 10 or 50 ha ha...
"PBTS is one of the Chinese mining stocks with good potential, good cash flow to buy more miners, and a capable management team. Don't worry about the crypto market, just keep holding!"
"Yes, I'll buy it when you sell it all of it."
shorts are panick posting  
"Aminer in China, I thought China banned mining?"
https://discord.gg/Sq2PjXPs
"$PBTS Eth mining efficiency increases by 15%, that’ll generate $$$"
Down fat here rinow lol hoping for a turn around
"Tell me if I have this right - im thinking that when BTC is down, thats the time the mining would accellerate??So if BTC is down wouldnt PBTS's sp start growing?"
After pumping finish PBTS will be $ 11.67 . REDDIT & The Street are watching it .
obviously short manipulation
very nice move towards $0.00
"A year from now when my investment have multiplied by 69, I’m buying my own chocolate fountain."
Let’s go baby!! Squeeze inbound on $PBTS check shorts available and short volume. Squeezed from $1-$4 last time. Let’s see what $WISH and $TSLA do
Let’s go !! Squeeze inbound on $PBTS blasted to $4 last time. Loading up $OEG too. Solar/energy/oil and $GME $CLOV
might get some shares if PBTS trends up after earnings
How does PBTS go up when it has not posted the last 2 quarters? The 2 previous quarters to these had massive losses.What kind of DD are you people doing?
"Good trading to everybody. Volumes for long sunshine, Hong Kong miners Will be rich with electricity costs managed."
"good morning, volume"
"Come on pumpers, pump this you did Friday."
"Wow, one week, one great news! We can see some positive changes with these news soon or later."
Red by close ?
What is your target price for the next week or month?
PBTS surging up on power hour.If a stock goes up on power hour especially on a friday afternoon then next week is gonna be awesome.Anyone agree??
Buy buy
"I have no idea what FXOS is, but I feel it can bring PBTS back to $3!"
waiting for 1.10
Telling you boys and girls... Under 30 cents is coming.
$2.00 tomorrow???!
"In the last time that PBTS was pumping, the next target for pump was LMFA."
"I’ve held PBTS since may and I almost sold during the July spike but honestly, I’m glad I didn’t. There’s so much potential and before we know it, prices will have skyrocketed."
Please go lower so I could buy as much as possible
"Not sure what this news means for $PBTS, I take it it's a right step for its crypto + blockchain operations"
Easy 3-5$ play
I now alert $PBTS at around 1.3 and look how far it will run in the next few months. PBTS will mine crypto.
"well guys, perhaps things will end strong today during the power hour."
One solid PR we should get back to $1.5
over or just getting started? thoughts?
"PBTS down again, buy the dip?"
"This thing just doesnt make sense. I would think that it would follow or work opposite of BTC's sp, but it doesnt!So what does it follow?"
Once it hits 1.10 we can all start an injection.
Wow lost all the gain from yesterday
What is happening. Throw a release out already
will it go above $1.5 in few days?.....Huge loss again
Just purchased at 1.2686 to average out my previous order of 2.10. This will rise again
pls go down
So many Chinese companies are mining now? Does PBTS have enough cash to purchase more mining gigs?
$3 coming squeeze
will definitely be $2+
The pop on this is going to be immmmmmense.

"Profitable low floater AMS ($2,6) has second Quarter 2021 net income $0.03 per diluted share (excluding the net charge) and is one of the most most undervalued low floaters in the market right now."
It’s a dollar stock so of course it’s going to be volatile.
https://discord.gg/TBfqEqcw
break below $1
"The 3,600 Ethereum miners Powerbridge is buying include high performance RTX 3070, RTX 3060 Ti and other models, representing an expected hash rate of 1,700 gigahash per second. Earlier this summer, Powerbridge caught the attention of retail investors on Reddit message boards, who targeted the company in an effort to collectively bid the stock higher and make a quick profit.Shares of Powerbridge Technologies at last check fell 2.2% to $1.36. They have traded on Wednesday up as much as 18% at $1.64. They were off 41% in 2021 through the close of Tuesday trading."
Can someone tell me the share float of this ticker PBTS ?
"Beautiful moves $PBTS and squeeze inbound, average at the support and maximize those gains. Check ortex and fintel, looks like reversal inbound on $TMC"
This looks like an easy one to short. I'll wait until this is pumped over $1.40 again then ride it back down.
PBTS is the next PHUN
game changer news! crypto!

Wack it baby
Some strong action here I except some big price movement in next couple days upward… amazing technology and with crypto soaring this could be the next riot or Mara
Looks like $PBTS can squeeze today finally
will hit $9.00 today
Everyday new low
$PBTS almost back to where I was loading up at 1.28 If you’re loading up now you might be in this for a while. I was in this for a month before it made its move up 1.28 to over $2 it’ll most likely happen again but could be a long wait
Going red.
#phun I guess people going to #pbts
"Shorts will wake up one day and see 5$+++ nobody with brain is selling, people will hold long and strong for months"

I heard about PBTS the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.

Nothing else matters until this can break $1.33.Then we might be off to the races.
It's guaranteed money if you short them on the spike-ups
Break thru
"All ABOARRRD!!! Next stop, $1,33!!!!!"
Today - PBTS.Tomorrow - LMFA.Be ready!!!
