When we can get some profit????
waiting for 1.10
break below $1
Wack
Up 12% for the day. This is looking very good.
"I mean, $PBTS is below 1.4, not much of a risk here."
"Yes, I'll buy it when you sell it all of it."
"Someone keeps spiking it up to empty the books, probably doing fairly expensive research, but it always implodes back down within a few hours."
Looks like $PBTS can squeeze today finally
"Good start this morning guys. Be patient and do not sell. If you can buy more, go for it. Have a good day."
"This is insane!! Next up is $PBTS check short interest, she going to explode and crypto play"
"PBTS have a very solid team and increasing their mining activity is a good choice, their revenue will go up and my stocks will go up. Cheers!"
$PBTs get in before it is too late
Let's go Brandon!
PBTS surging up on power hour.If a stock goes up on power hour especially on a friday afternoon then next week is gonna be awesome.Anyone agree??
"HI Guys,Saw this stock as a potential squeeze. 7.9 million float, 32.47% short and a short ratio of 1.84. It looks like this has some possibilities. What do you guys think? Thanks,"
"Good trading to everybody. Volumes for long sunshine, Hong Kong miners Will be rich with electricity costs managed."
Wack it baby
Easy 3-5$ play
pump and dump...
Back under $1
really incredible run here
"So happy I bought in last month, I’ll continue to add more to my portfolio."
"Powerbridge Technologies Co., Ltd. (PBTS) is the kind of stock that pops 200% towards the upside pre-market, before you have a chance to buy one single share.... The problem is, you have to own the shares before they go up..."
Yep added at 1.28. Will squeeze and go up when btc goes. 5400 mining machines delivered this month
"Looks like $PBTS next to squeeze check Ortex data, and charts like to sell off then run. I opened a position :) $PROG $BBIG $ANY"
getting ready 
China should; not be allowed to trade on our market. I will not not buy stock in china.
Beautiful day to own $PBTS $BENE $SONM and mark… wish I loaded up Friday. Scared money makes no money
Everyday new low
When this hits it’s going to be big and fast!
Squeeze inbound on $PBTS watching at open. See what $CEI $DATS $WKHS do today
Should be back below a dollar around closing time today.
"I know $PBTS is up but keep holding, DO NOT sell now. It's only gonna go up with all the great news coming out."
"US Gov will use this company in 2022 if congress passes less restrictive laws for online currency monetary flow. This will be the company related to the Fed reserves coin, as well as Eth & Bit. Have a nice day ;) can't wait for next year"
Hold it guys it will touch 2$
Looks like $PBTS squeezing 0 shares left to short too. $2+ easy today insane moves on $DWAC $PHUN
Squeeze inbound on $PBTS last time ran hard. Check charts! $SDC $ATER $GME
https://discord.gg/KwYYs2yv
What else does this company do besides the crypto mining?
Can you imagine having the job of maintainong 2600 computers? Im gussing that he wouldnt be a very easy one to live around!!!
7-10 near term is realistic!
Sell sell sell
https://discord.gg/Sq2PjXPs
Break thru
"Beautiful moves $PBTS and squeeze inbound, average at the support and maximize those gains. Check ortex and fintel, looks like reversal inbound on $TMC"
Today 4$
Go to #PBTS. THIS is also related to DWAC.
"I only have 3000 shares in it at 1.2$, i wanted to load 20k more shares but founds will be available tomorrow, so sadly will be too late. will just load 2000 extra shares instead of 20k shares Just in Case I Am buying into PUMP AND DUMP lol"
How does PBTS go up when it has not posted the last 2 quarters? The 2 previous quarters to these had massive losses.What kind of DD are you people doing?
What a great start to my day. I bought yesterday at $1.15 and the price is at 1.67
Once it hits 1.10 we can all start an injection.
go to $0.50 and I buy
Will end up bad... CHINA Stock... 20Cents then OTC ... like YRIV
"good morning, volume"
"Looks like $PBTS going to squeeze again, volumes in and shorts trapped. Insane moves on $DWAC today wow.. Crypto sold off aggressively earlier… $COIN cooling down"
"PBTS is one of the newer companies that started mining crypto in China. Lots of cashflow and a strong team. Now with Michael Zhao's addition, their mining operations should perform really really well and this is on top of their other operations. Michael's previously worked at MSFT so his knowledge in blockchain tech shouldn't be overlooked. $1.30 is a very good price to get in, anything below $2 is a bargain tbh. Keep an eye on this stock."
added more
What is your target price for the next week or month?
Please go lower so I could buy as much as possible
"something is cooking and i want to be EARLY, bought 20k shares at 0.64 ENJOY THE RIDE$CSCW $DWAC $PBTS $GME $AMC"
obviously short manipulation
Let’s go baby!! Squeeze inbound on $PBTS check shorts available and short volume. Squeezed from $1-$4 last time. Let’s see what $WISH and $TSLA do
rolling to $2
It’s a dollar stock so of course it’s going to be volatile.
"A year from now when my investment have multiplied by 69, I’m buying my own chocolate fountain."
This is the easiest stock to game ever
"So, can the pumpers pump again Monday so I can sell this #$%$"
#phun I guess people going to #pbts
"Anyone looking at this should consider that when the THOUSANDS of mining rigs their subsidiary deploys in North America and Hong Kong are activated, the re venue generated from them is going to be phenomenal.You can bank on that!!!"
"Guys, check out (http://the-alphatrader.com). They have been crushing it lately while PBTS barley does anything at all."
https://discord.gg/N85KYSyGeZ
"I have no idea what FXOS is, but I feel it can bring PBTS back to $3!"
very nice move towards $0.00
"I'm confused as to why so many Chinese companies are mining crypto when the govt has an eye on it all the time. But on the other hand, mining would generate an enormous amount of revenue. PBTS is a bit risky but not a bad play imo when it's at $1.3."
Buy and hold.
I trust this one
"All aboard, PBTS is getting ready for liftoff!"
Today #PBTS. THIS will go over 1000% up today.
"Next runners (still early) may be $AGC $PBTS $LEV, again.. only if you like making money"
Read the news people. They are goin to setup a major mining operation in the USA!!!!Once this in operation the revenue is going to be astounding.
What is happening. Throw a release out already
"Powercrypto expects to complete the deployment of 2,600 high-performance mining rigs in Hong Kong, encompassing 600 high-performance BTC mining machines with a hashrate of approximately 60 PH/s, and 2,000 high-performance ETH mining machines with a hashrate of approximately 1,000 GH/s.Sean Wang, Powercrypto's General Manager and Chief Technology Officer, stated that: ""Powercrypto is a major strategic move by the Company to highlight our global presence in the crypto-mining business. We will focus on enhancing our overall hashrate level in BTC and ETH mining by setting up mining fleets in North America and Asia.""Powerbridge Technologies President Stewart Lor, commented, ""We are very excited about our launch and positioning as a global presence in the cryptocurrency mining business. We expect our high-performance environmental-friendly crypto-mining fleets to significantly accelerate our revenue."""
THIS IS THE WAY
PBTS is the next PHUN
over or just getting started? thoughts?
Volume good
"Come on pumpers, pump this you did Friday."
"Good luck today guys. If you buy, please hold. This is still a good entry price and there is money to be made. Good luck everyone and please ignore the bashers. They are probably shorting the stock and do not want to lose their shirts."
"$PBTS seems to be at a big discount right now, buy more?"
Easy to way 3 dollor
Telling you boys and girls... Under 30 cents is coming.
PREPARE FOR BLAST$GME $AMC $PBTS $BBIG
Going down as always
Holding the bag I don’t know I keep average down
Iceberg. Appropriately named hedge fund. They'll go down like they hit an iceberg shorting a dollar stock that could easily go up 10X or more if it catches fire.
shorts are panick posting  
The thing about this company is that you need to be in for the long term.
Looking forward to another good day.
First $DWAC took the attention off $AMC. Then $PHUN. Now $PBTS. They’re doing everything they can to get us to sell. these plays are childs play once our rocket takes off!
"Shorts will wake up one day and see 5$+++ nobody with brain is selling, people will hold long and strong for months"
Going red.
Feel like $BITF and $PBTS going to run today.. and $COIN $HUT
"I’m loading up $SNAP I use it everyday, they make $$ barely any expenses. Same with $PBTS"
"Hong Kong mining Will boost finally this stock! It Is undervalued at 1.00 USD, not a few..."
"Whooooo shorts are trapped , buy buy buy !!!!!! $5 coming fast"
Bought this today at 1.39.
wait till the mining news comes out
https://discord.gg/TBfqEqcw
"This is insane hut is up over 10% and $BITF struggle over 5%…. I own both but weird, more bullish on $PBTS shorts attacking squeeze imminent"
Here we go!!
Buy now
Some strong action here I except some big price movement in next couple days upward… amazing technology and with crypto soaring this could be the next riot or Mara
I'd get more $PBTS this week if I had more cash
$2.00 tomorrow???!
This is the new short squeeze target of WSB ! I just saw they are talking about it in their discord group. Get ready.
Isn’t crypto banned in China?
Blessings
Why all haters
You have to share your good picks Papito. I told everyone to buy $PBTS on Friday. Now it's soaring.
"This thing just doesnt make sense. I would think that it would follow or work opposite of BTC's sp, but it doesnt!So what does it follow?"
"This will soar.so will seed,it has a 3.7 million share float"
https://discord.gg/Ascc4ZAx
I now alert $PBTS at around 1.3 and look how far it will run in the next few months. PBTS will mine crypto.
"Buy buy buy, this will be 6+"
"What an incredible day. $PHUN, $CDEV, $DWAC, and $PBTS all doing well today with $CPE and $ALLO making nice comebacks in the final hour. I close out the week with enough profit to buy a second Florida beach condo. Maybe I'll rent it out to Gladiator and Papito. Have a great weekend all!"
Red by close
Let’s go !! Squeeze inbound on $PBTS blasted to $4 last time. Loading up $OEG too. Solar/energy/oil and $GME $CLOV
So are these 2500 rigs a bonus? We're still waiting on the 5600 other ones right ? In Portugal or something?
"Wow, look at the 5 day chart!!! Whoopeee!!"
what's the price target?
will definitely be $2+
Had to buy today. Like the crypto angle too!
Are you ready for the long journey?
Metx high risk. risks of getting delisted off Nasdaq trading below $1. #PBTS better play
Load up guyzz..
Big drop
This looks like an easy one to short. I'll wait until this is pumped over $1.40 again then ride it back down.
"I’ve held PBTS since may and I almost sold during the July spike but honestly, I’m glad I didn’t. There’s so much potential and before we know it, prices will have skyrocketed."
Red by close ?
Just like I said new low everyday my bag is super heavy
"This is insane, $PBTS charts identical and same PR not too long ago. Next up??"
One solid PR we should get back to $1.5
Buy buy
This one day soon will be trading with the same market cap as $RIOT and $MSTR .. longterm price target for me is $60 pps
I am sick of all the spam on yahoo! I actually try to stay off of the PBTS message board now and exclusively use http://the-alphatrader.com/
who's selling not me
Goes up again
10k shares @ $1.04. Lets ride this for a few weeks/months.
The pop on this is going to be immmmmmense.
Come to $PBTS
Some thing is cooking.......
Climate change problems here - how will they make money?
"well guys, perhaps things will end strong today during the power hour."
"Short playing risky game with this one, never ever underestimate Hong Kong"
This hit the bottom and ready to squeeze. It can easily make 3x - 5x. Almost %0 downside risk. Crypto play. Low float. Half of the shares are shorted. What else do we need for a short squeeze?
Hahah seems like $PBTS and $XELA like to run together
Alright team PBTS hope you’re ready for the launch because we’re going to space!
