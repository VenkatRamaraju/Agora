I couldnt believe it when I bought in at 1.37 and it dropped to 1.34 right after that!!Just as I was hoping Im back to my buy price to top off the day!!!Im hoping we all have a good Friday!!
"Pbts, verb let’s go"
"As per Level II data, it looks like not even moving towards $3. Its struglling between 1.90 to 2.10"
"Damnnn, PBTS is ready to rock n roll with those new mining gigs.."
"In the last time that PBTS was pumping, the next target for pump was LMFA."
Chart is looking good. PBTS bound to hit the $2 mark again very soon.
"$PBTS is seeing a lot of resistance, a bounce back is imminent"
"Bought more $IMTE and $PBTS today, let’s see the squeeze! Holding $CLOV $VISL still"
They had some interesting insights about PBTS on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"$PBTS is crypto mining now, this is huge for them"
tomorrow we can see 5$ good luck all hold :))
$PBTS has some very advanced tech for their mining and blockchain operations. Today's news might not mean much but it's a step in the right direction. I'm hoping this stock will turn it around by the end of the year.
And it’s done nice pump
Anyone buying DSS
might get some shares if PBTS trends up after earnings
I heard about PBTS the other day on (http://Fairstox.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"PBTS has the potential to be a major player in the crypto space, lots of $$ to buy mining gigs for insane hashrates"
so much volume yesterday...what a ripped off company
Anyone buying XELA?
$3 TODAY???
"PBTS 72M market cap, it's below $2 rn. Now that's a value stock."
Squeeze will happen around $2.5. Then we see $3 in a blink
News Alert: Stocks to load today is KPLT. Way oversold because of panic selling on ER. This stock has strong E-commerce technology. Easy $7 here guys. Today is the day to load cheap shares
Anyone know how many miners they will run ?Or if they have any current Bitcoin holdings ??
Added 1000 shares more. Easy money
Calm seas on a Friday mornin'
"Wow, one week, one great news! We can see some positive changes with these news soon or later."
Why are Crypto stocks like $PBTS getting hit hard today? Crypto market is hot as usual?

"PBTS , Profitable low floater AMS ($2,6) has second Quarter 2021 net income $0.03 per diluted share (excluding the net charge) and is one of the most most undervalued low floaters in the market right now."
That last pump had incredible volume. Doesn’t that mean something
The next few days will be interesting!!! If you look at the beautiful pattern forming and the past history it’s most likely a bullish future ahead! Good luck to you all
new BTC & ETH operations = new target price?
Stay above 2$ today tomorrow $3
The future is looking bright for $PBTS
"Buy the dips and ride the news. Could see a big spike after hours. Just like $MRIN or $BRIN or $PBTS, well you get the idea."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clickstreams-heypal-tm-app-experiencing-123000518.html
this will hit below 1$ soon
buying more
"Red day when good news comes out, sad. Great addition for PBTS tho."
Is PBTS a safe play this week at $1.3?
Can someone tell me the share float of this ticker PBTS ?
So quiet here PUMPERS HAVE MOVED ON

https://discord.gg/X4c32M5
$PBTS on a wild rollercoaster today.
Ok I'm In.
"PBTS will bounce back soon, let's go!"
https://discord.gg/wbPpfcSg
"added 1k more, thanks for the dip!"
https://discord.gg/UVCTKhDb
is this supposed to rise with BTC even though they didn't start mining yet ?
"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Fairstox.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I don’t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"
They had some interesting insights about PBTS on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Is this already the moon?
$3 coming...
"PBTS down again, buy the dip?"
"this is a meme stock only. Unprofitable, a penny stock below $1"
Squeeze coming
I have loaded up enough here and will load more in XELA tomorrow
I bought a little of this in premarket for fun and I am surprised most of my gain is still holding up. These stocks are a complete gamble and the bet is will the Chinese manipulation work in my trade’s favor or not! 
"PBTS is a long term hold, below 1.5 is a great price to get in. EOY $7.50 target price is very possible. Chinese stocks might be risky but PBTS is in crypto mining now. They have the money to purchase enough crypto miners to make a huge profit and beat their earnings."
who else shorted at the top
holy smokes that's some volume
I purchased @2.10....now it is going down...by any chance will it go up tomorrow?....Unfortunately i cant wait for more than 2 days....
"PBTS is seeing a lot of resistance, a bounce back is imminent"
China just shut down all mining operations nationwide !!!
https://discord.gg/CF4p4z2R
Holy $PBTS up over 40% premarket squeezing hard. $SOFI $WISH $HOOD
Load up boys. This is cheap.
"Another 5% dip for PBTS, what is up with this market"
Why are Crypto stocks getting hit hard today? Crypto market is hot as usual?
Today - PBTS.Tomorrow - LMFA.
"my broker given path for few stocks ...all are down (LMFA, PBTS, NAOV,),...and now he is saying we need to wait for 6 months to 1 year to see the profit. Great loss.....why they are doing like this"
Chance to cross 3 today
"I have no idea what FXOS is, but I feel it can bring PBTS back to $3!"
Going back below a dollar now.
"If i have mor money, i will not hesitate to buy now, this will fly by tomorrow or monday, inshallah"

Thanks for discount!
Once it hits 1.10 we can all start an injection.
The pump is over get out
Sure - drop 4 cents right after I bought 8700 shares!! What kind of a thank you is that?
"transitioning into crypto, good call"
Sinking ship and I’m going down with it
"1.3 first, then 1.2, 1.1, 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7,0.6,0.5,0.4, over"
Does anyone believe? I know I do!!!
https://discord.gg/BkJs5dJYp7

going down towards $1.60
"Once there's some profits, look into RELI. 750k ftd's from May 7th now naked at 36%. New app release next week. Low float same as PBTS"
Over $6.00 Tomorrow 
Looks like a nice run on $PBTS is inbound Monday. Watching $BITF $COIN and $CTRM
closes at $ 10
"Buying more PBTS tomorrow, do it uppp"
Premarket volumes are restarting
"Profitable low floater AMS ($2,6) has second Quarter 2021 net income $0.03 per diluted share (excluding the net charge) and is one of the most most undervalued low floaters in the market right now."
Come squeeze
Loaded up the dips $SQBG $PBTS let’s go baby!!! Buy dips not tips! $AMC $CLOV
Look out above ! YEH YEH
Great news about crypto space. Only issue is the company is based in China. China just shut down all mining operations nationwide. So. How does this fly. ??
"Do your research, but it is very clear that HGEN WILL double or more very soon! Approval in the UK and USA will drive the price higher quickly!"
So many Chinese companies are mining now? Does PBTS have enough cash to purchase more mining gigs?
"Is this another SOS, EBON and many others that have pumped and then dumped?"
https://discord.com/invite/kWvZhf8
When we can get some profit????
Any hope.........
Green day for $PBTS yo. Bounce back season is here.
"Will close today around 3$, insallah"
I'd get more $PBTS this week if I had more cash
will hit $9.00 today
Bye bye my money
Just purchased at 1.2686 to average out my previous order of 2.10. This will rise again
"$PBTS seems to be at a big discount right now, buy more?"
"$pbts, $any, $sos, $sprt all have huge potential to become primary BTC miners, some will go up on Monday if BTC reaches 47k during during the weekend. Same story with $riot and $mara."
will it go above $1.5 in few days?.....Huge loss again
After pumping finish PBTS will be $ 11.67 . REDDIT & The Street are watching it .
this is just warming up for tomorrow
I heard about PBTS the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Could it double?

"Excited for this week, a lot of good stuff going on for PBTS"
no doubt this is the bottom .. the heights are coming
Is it going to climb again ?!
Who else loaded up on the dips $IMTE $PBTS good moves on $RCAT today and $XELA
"PBTS is seeing a lot of resistance, buy the dip"
"This reminds me of $GME in many ways, and the others like $BSQR, $PBTS $BLIN reminds me of the $CLNE, $MVIS and $BB spin offs of GME. All we need to do is find one and hold, like $AMC. Seems all too familiar."
Looks like a possible squeeze on $PBTS and $IMTE 0 shares left to short. Holding AMC and $GME $NOK
Should I buy now or later ? How high can this hit ?
$PBTS's mining and blockchain operations are legit. FXOS is a great tool for crypto mining. I'm hoping this stock will turn it around before their next earnings.
Is this news gonna change anything? $PBTS was already doing alright. This stock can't dip much more right?
buy at the bottom! PBTS is making a comeback!
Load up guyzz..
Why all haters
With so much volume this play is way too intriguing.
"$PBTS 72M market cap, it's below $2 rn. Definitely has room to grow"
Are we back to being a meme stock?
Will it go back to $2.10 ...i invested and huge loss
Excited for this new week for $PBTS
lower next week! enjoy!
What's up
now is a good time to get in
"I'm buying more for sure, mark my words~"
Any good news about PBTS?Unfortunately it goes down rapidly..I bought it 1.89
Looks like the bleeding is letting up!
https://discord.gg/68FYvTQ
"PBTS is seeing some daylight here, cypto mining is a good opportunity for them"
What is your target price for the next week or month?
$2.00 tomorrow???!
https://discord.gg/9uN2nn3d
"I mean, $PBTS is below 1.4, not much of a risk here."
Closing at 3.5$ today
https://discord.gg/3qP5yFYx
"ay yo, anyone got more of that PBTS news? :D"
"Not sure what this news means for $PBTS, I take it it's a right step for its crypto + blockchain operations"
"The 3,600 Ethereum miners Powerbridge is buying include high performance RTX 3070, RTX 3060 Ti and other models, representing an expected hash rate of 1,700 gigahash per second. Earlier this summer, Powerbridge caught the attention of retail investors on Reddit message boards, who targeted the company in an effort to collectively bid the stock higher and make a quick profit.Shares of Powerbridge Technologies at last check fell 2.2% to $1.36. They have traded on Wednesday up as much as 18% at $1.64. They were off 41% in 2021 through the close of Tuesday trading."

"Aminer in China, I thought China banned mining?"
I just loaded the boat on $BRQS will be $12 by year end As well as $CPOP and $xela ans $BSQR and $RCAT $PBTS all these network and computer companies will fly in the coming weeks just look at $NEGG and $MRIN
https://discord.gg/cJwADRBAsp
Target : 10USD
"I know $PBTS is up but keep holding, DO NOT sell now. It's only gonna go up with all the great news coming out."
Gonna hit 3 today
"This is the bottom for PBTS, comeback season has returned!!"
all crypto miners are down today... Monday it is!
chance for lower than 1.4 today
Still not looking good.
"Red season, hold strong my PBTS gang!"
goooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Chinese stock
Stock price goes down when good news comes out. Typical. #stocks
A whole lot of companies mentioning crypto to get a rise lately. This company being based in China I wouldn't buy in with recent government regulations.
"PBTS is bouncing back, buy it now!"
"I'm confused as to why so many Chinese companies are mining crypto when the govt has an eye on it all the time. But on the other hand, mining would generate an enormous amount of revenue. PBTS is a bit risky but not a bad play imo when it's at $1.3."
"Another 1.4% dip for PBTS, what is up with this market"
Big gains today
Can we get a re-run of Tuesday?
Feels like new base at $2 before jump to $3
$3 coming squeeze
I now alert $PBTS at around 1.3 and look how far it will run in the next few months. PBTS will mine crypto.
It’s a good time to invest in Bitcoin miners. This is even cheaper than $any.
"PBTS up 4.5%, nice!"
"Impressed with the news for PBTS, buying more at the bottom!"
PBTS what are you doing!!??
"should've bought more PBTS at $1.2, still a good time to get in?"
"the market is red, hold for better days. "
"Since they say every day they don't have to cover the shorts, buy's them time, well its all playing out in the open for all to see. Once they are done pumping $PBTS $MRIN $EXEL $BSQR to support their short position with AMC, I wonder what Citadel and co will do next?"
"How did $PBTS manage to get that many 3070 and 3060 Ti? The crypto market is SOOO hot right now, these mining gigs will bring so much profit to them and Michael Zhao is on board. Future is definitely looking good for them."
The longer term trend shows these spikes diminishing over time.
Loaded more to average down ! Let’s goooo 
Been slowly adding more. I think PBTS has hit its support line. Can't wait to see it go back up again!
Let’s keeepppp it going !!! Touching 2$ soon
"2's must be done, not getting back there again looks like."
"Market is down, don't worry about the little PBTS's dip just hold or buy more"
To the moon
Go green
500$ tomorrow
Sigh.Remind me to sell at 1.60 next time.
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
"PBTS is one of the newer companies that started mining crypto in China. Lots of cashflow and a strong team. Now with Michael Zhao's addition, their mining operations should perform really really well and this is on top of their other operations. Michael's previously worked at MSFT so his knowledge in blockchain tech shouldn't be overlooked. $1.30 is a very good price to get in, anything below $2 is a bargain tbh. Keep an eye on this stock."
Big pump coming?
We are going to close at the high of the day then rocket tomorrow!
Next MRIN
Dang.Guess I shouldn't have sold to buy DIDI.
$PBTS $3 end of day is very possible!
game changer news! crypto!

"FXOS system now avaialble for $PBTS's mining operations, great news"
Wow lost all the gain from yesterday
This one got a lot of juice left.
"I'm a simple man, I see crypto mining and PBTS, I buy"
$PBTS almost back to where I was loading up at 1.28 If you’re loading up now you might be in this for a while. I was in this for a month before it made its move up 1.28 to over $2 it’ll most likely happen again but could be a long wait
The entire market is red and PBTS is up? tf??
"Last week bought 7k shares @2.6 FOMO. Yesterday panic sold at average 2.55,should do some DD before buying. /Selling"

Still trying to learn more about this new FXOS but $PBTS is looking rather promising despite this dip. They keep pumping out good news and the stock price just keeps trending down just like the market.
