"Excited for this week, a lot of good stuff going on for PBTS"
goooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
When we can get some profit????
We are going to close at the high of the day then rocket tomorrow!
Will it go back to $2.10 ...i invested and huge loss
"PBTS is one of the Chinese mining stocks with good potential, good cash flow to buy more miners, and a capable management team. Don't worry about the crypto market, just keep holding!"
Just purchased at 1.2686 to average out my previous order of 2.10. This will rise again

$PBTS on a wild rollercoaster today.
Target : 10USD
Nothing else matters until this can break $1.33.Then we might be off to the races.
"PBTS mining ETH and BTC, gg time to get in!"
will it go above $1.5 in few days?.....Huge loss again
Go green
Is it going to climb again ?!
Calm seas on a Friday mornin'
$2.00 tomorrow???!
"I have no idea what FXOS is, but I feel it can bring PBTS back to $3!"
Chinese stock
It’s a good time to invest in Bitcoin miners. This is even cheaper than $any.
Look out above ! YEH YEH
waiting for 1.10
This looks like an easy one to short. I'll wait until this is pumped over $1.40 again then ride it back down.
The longer term trend shows these spikes diminishing over time.
They had some interesting insights about PBTS on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
very nice move towards $0.00
"All aboard, PBTS is getting ready for liftoff!"
this will hit below 1$ soon
"If i have mor money, i will not hesitate to buy now, this will fly by tomorrow or monday, inshallah"
"Beautiful moves today on $BITF and $PBTS and squeeze inbound again, hit $4 last time. And at all time lows. Watching $COIN tmo for calls"
$3 coming squeeze
"All ABOARRRD!!! Next stop, $1,33!!!!!"
Let’s go!! $PBTS just dropped a PR squeeze inbound too $HOOD $CLOV $WISH
It's guaranteed money if you short them on the spike-ups
"Another 5% dip for PBTS, what is up with this market"
Where did all the PUMPERS GO
Dammm
Going down as always
So many Chinese companies are mining now? Does PBTS have enough cash to purchase more mining gigs?
Green day! I'll be waiting for yall at the moon!
"Is this another SOS, EBON and many others that have pumped and then dumped?"
This is the new short squeeze target of WSB ! I just saw they are talking about it in their discord group. Get ready.
"$PBTS Eth mining efficiency increases by 15%, that’ll generate $$$"
"$pbts, $any, $sos, $sprt all have huge potential to become primary BTC miners, some will go up on Monday if BTC reaches 47k during during the weekend. Same story with $riot and $mara."
no doubt this is the bottom .. the heights are coming
I heard about PBTS the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
now is a good time to get in
"This thing just doesnt make sense. I would think that it would follow or work opposite of BTC's sp, but it doesnt!So what does it follow?"
Still trying to learn more about this new FXOS but $PBTS is looking rather promising despite this dip. They keep pumping out good news and the stock price just keeps trending down just like the market.
"should've bought more PBTS at $1.2, still a good time to get in?"
"PBTS up 4.5%, nice!"
A whole lot of companies mentioning crypto to get a rise lately. This company being based in China I wouldn't buy in with recent government regulations.
"The 3,600 Ethereum miners Powerbridge is buying include high performance RTX 3070, RTX 3060 Ti and other models, representing an expected hash rate of 1,700 gigahash per second. Earlier this summer, Powerbridge caught the attention of retail investors on Reddit message boards, who targeted the company in an effort to collectively bid the stock higher and make a quick profit.Shares of Powerbridge Technologies at last check fell 2.2% to $1.36. They have traded on Wednesday up as much as 18% at $1.64. They were off 41% in 2021 through the close of Tuesday trading."

"I'm confused as to why so many Chinese companies are mining crypto when the govt has an eye on it all the time. But on the other hand, mining would generate an enormous amount of revenue. PBTS is a bit risky but not a bad play imo when it's at $1.3."
Powerbridge plans to invest and engage in the cryptocurrency mining for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) with planned operations globally!
Stock price goes down when good news comes out. Typical. #stocks
$3 coming...

game changer news! crypto!
"FXOS system now avaialble for $PBTS's mining operations, great news"
$PBTS's mining and blockchain operations are legit. FXOS is a great tool for crypto mining. I'm hoping this stock will turn it around before their next earnings.
"Red day when good news comes out, sad. Great addition for PBTS tho."
"$PBTS 72M market cap, it's below $2 rn. Definitely has room to grow"
Will fly to the moon today
Let’s go baby!! Squeeze inbound on $PBTS check shorts available and short volume. Squeezed from $1-$4 last time. Let’s see what $WISH and $TSLA do
Alright team PBTS hope you’re ready for the launch because we’re going to space!
"good morning, volume"
going down towards $1.60
$PBTS almost back to where I was loading up at 1.28 If you’re loading up now you might be in this for a while. I was in this for a month before it made its move up 1.28 to over $2 it’ll most likely happen again but could be a long wait
Thought on buying ?
"As per Level II data, it looks like not even moving towards $3. Its struglling between 1.90 to 2.10"
buying more
Any hope.........
Excited for this new week for $PBTS
"Red season, hold strong my PBTS gang!"
"PBTS will bounce back soon, let's go!"
Is PBTS a safe play this week at $1.3?
Red by close
"This is the bottom for PBTS, comeback season has returned!!"
"PBTS is bouncing back, buy it now!"
I couldnt believe it when I bought in at 1.37 and it dropped to 1.34 right after that!!Just as I was hoping Im back to my buy price to top off the day!!!Im hoping we all have a good Friday!!

I'd get more $PBTS this week if I had more cash
https://discord.gg/QDBEcMBy
Feels like new base at $2 before jump to $3
if the mining news is true then I'm buying more and holding til EOM at least
Anyone know how many miners they will run ?Or if they have any current Bitcoin holdings ??
closes at $ 10
I bought a little of this in premarket for fun and I am surprised most of my gain is still holding up. These stocks are a complete gamble and the bet is will the Chinese manipulation work in my trade’s favor or not! 
Squeeze will happen around $2.5. Then we see $3 in a blink
Chart is looking good. PBTS bound to hit the $2 mark again very soon.
"Buying more PBTS tomorrow, do it uppp"
"Whooooo shorts are trapped , buy buy buy !!!!!! $5 coming fast"
I can see PBTS going back to $3
https://discord.gg/X4c32M5
Can someone tell me the share float of this ticker PBTS ?
might get some shares if PBTS trends up after earnings
$PBTS has some very advanced tech for their mining and blockchain operations. Today's news might not mean much but it's a step in the right direction. I'm hoping this stock will turn it around by the end of the year.
https://discord.gg/BkJs5dJYp7
"How did $PBTS manage to get that many 3070 and 3060 Ti? The crypto market is SOOO hot right now, these mining gigs will bring so much profit to them and Michael Zhao is on board. Future is definitely looking good for them."
China just shut down all mining operations nationwide !!!
Is this news gonna change anything? $PBTS was already doing alright. This stock can't dip much more right?
Squeeze inbound on $PBTS watching at open. See what $CEI $DATS $WKHS do today
The pump is over get out
"Bought more $IMTE and $PBTS today, let’s see the squeeze! Holding $CLOV $VISL still"
"$PBTS seems to be at a big discount right now, buy more?"
"if you read whats said on YF all of this is being caused because of the eventual failure of Chinas Evergrande land develoer.mark my words, China isnt going to allow them to crash and will soon pick up the tab, seize the comoany and either run it through the government, or re-distribute it into more capable hands.its going to take time, but it WILL happen.China is NOT keen on faliure!!!"
Looks like a possible squeeze on $PBTS and $IMTE 0 shares left to short. Holding AMC and $GME $NOK

"Beautiful moves $PBTS and squeeze inbound, average at the support and maximize those gains. Check ortex and fintel, looks like reversal inbound on $TMC"
So are these 2500 rigs a bonus? We're still waiting on the 5600 other ones right ? In Portugal or something?

Does anyone believe? I know I do!!!
Not even close yet red already
"PBTS is seeing a lot of resistance, buy the dip"
Great news about crypto space. Only issue is the company is based in China. China just shut down all mining operations nationwide. So. How does this fly. ??
500$ tomorrow
Squeeze inbound on $PBTS last time ran hard. Check charts! $SDC $ATER $GME

Looks like a nice run on $PBTS is inbound Monday. Watching $BITF $COIN and $CTRM
https://discord.gg/HwNR29e
Green at open. Go longs.
Any good news about PBTS?Unfortunately it goes down rapidly..I bought it 1.89
https://discord.gg/wbPpfcSg
This hit the bottom and ready to squeeze. It can easily make 3x - 5x. Almost %0 downside risk. Crypto play. Low float. Half of the shares are shorted. What else do we need for a short squeeze?
"PBTS have a very solid team and increasing their mining activity is a good choice, their revenue will go up and my stocks will go up. Cheers!"
The thing about this company is that you need to be in for the long term.
"I’ve held PBTS since may and I almost sold during the July spike but honestly, I’m glad I didn’t. There’s so much potential and before we know it, prices will have skyrocketed."
"A year from now when my investment have multiplied by 69, I’m buying my own chocolate fountain."
I purchased @2.10....now it is going down...by any chance will it go up tomorrow?....Unfortunately i cant wait for more than 2 days....
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
this is just warming up for tomorrow
https://discord.gg/9uN2nn3d
The entire market is red and PBTS is up? tf??
"Market is down, don't worry about the little PBTS's dip just hold or buy more"
Wow lost all the gain from yesterday
I now alert $PBTS at around 1.3 and look how far it will run in the next few months. PBTS will mine crypto.
Anyone buying Chinese mining stocks? Should be an interesting week for $PBTS as they begin utilizing FXOS
Once it hits 1.10 we can all start an injection.
holy smokes that's some volume
no $3 or 4 or 10 or 50 ha ha...
"Tell me if I have this right - im thinking that when BTC is down, thats the time the mining would accellerate??So if BTC is down wouldnt PBTS's sp start growing?"
"PBTS is one of the newer companies that started mining crypto in China. Lots of cashflow and a strong team. Now with Michael Zhao's addition, their mining operations should perform really really well and this is on top of their other operations. Michael's previously worked at MSFT so his knowledge in blockchain tech shouldn't be overlooked. $1.30 is a very good price to get in, anything below $2 is a bargain tbh. Keep an eye on this stock."
Gonna hit 3 today
"transitioning into crypto, good call"
This is the easiest stock to game ever
is this supposed to rise with BTC even though they didn't start mining yet ?
can PBTS be a big player in the crypto space?
pls go down
That last pump had incredible volume. Doesn’t that mean something
What's up
Stay above 2$ today tomorrow $3

"PBTS , Profitable low floater AMS ($2,6) has second Quarter 2021 net income $0.03 per diluted share (excluding the net charge) and is one of the most most undervalued low floaters in the market right now."
What is your target price for the next week or month?
"PBTS is seeing a lot of resistance, a bounce back is imminent"
"my broker given path for few stocks ...all are down (LMFA, PBTS, NAOV,),...and now he is saying we need to wait for 6 months to 1 year to see the profit. Great loss.....why they are doing like this"
Sure - drop 4 cents right after I bought 8700 shares!! What kind of a thank you is that?
so much volume yesterday...what a ripped off company
Big gains today

"PBTS is a long term hold, below 1.5 is a great price to get in. EOY $7.50 target price is very possible. Chinese stocks might be risky but PBTS is in crypto mining now. They have the money to purchase enough crypto miners to make a huge profit and beat their earnings."
THIS IS THE WAY
