"Good luck today guys. If you buy, please hold. This is still a good entry price and there is money to be made. Good luck everyone and please ignore the bashers. They are probably shorting the stock and do not want to lose their shirts."
"well guys, perhaps things will end strong today during the power hour."
"Anyone looking at this should consider that when the THOUSANDS of mining rigs their subsidiary deploys in North America and Hong Kong are activated, the re venue generated from them is going to be phenomenal.You can bank on that!!!"
"Good trading to everybody. Volumes for long sunshine, Hong Kong miners Will be rich with electricity costs managed."
First $DWAC took the attention off $AMC. Then $PHUN. Now $PBTS. They’re doing everything they can to get us to sell. these plays are childs play once our rocket takes off!
wait till the mining news comes out
"So, can the pumpers pump again Monday so I can sell this #$%$"
Easy 3-5$ play
Buy buy
what's the price target?
This one day soon will be trading with the same market cap as $RIOT and $MSTR .. longterm price target for me is $60 pps
Today 4$
"Powerbridge Technologies Co., Ltd. (PBTS) is the kind of stock that pops 200% towards the upside pre-market, before you have a chance to buy one single share.... The problem is, you have to own the shares before they go up..."

Looks like $PBTS can squeeze today finally
I trust this one
When this hits it’s going to be big and fast!
"Guys, check out (http://the-alphatrader.com). They have been crushing it lately while PBTS barley does anything at all."
"US Gov will use this company in 2022 if congress passes less restrictive laws for online currency monetary flow. This will be the company related to the Fed reserves coin, as well as Eth & Bit. Have a nice day ;) can't wait for next year"
You have to share your good picks Papito. I told everyone to buy $PBTS on Friday. Now it's soaring.
The pop on this is going to be immmmmmense.
This hit the bottom and ready to squeeze. It can easily make 3x - 5x. Almost %0 downside risk. Crypto play. Low float. Half of the shares are shorted. What else do we need for a short squeeze?
10k shares @ $1.04. Lets ride this for a few weeks/months.
7-10 near term is realistic!
Today #PBTS. THIS will go over 1000% up today.
"Hong Kong mining Will boost finally this stock! It Is undervalued at 1.00 USD, not a few..."
"Buy buy buy, this will be 6+"
"What an incredible day. $PHUN, $CDEV, $DWAC, and $PBTS all doing well today with $CPE and $ALLO making nice comebacks in the final hour. I close out the week with enough profit to buy a second Florida beach condo. Maybe I'll rent it out to Gladiator and Papito. Have a great weekend all!"
"Shorts will wake up one day and see 5$+++ nobody with brain is selling, people will hold long and strong for months"
"Yes, I'll buy it when you sell it all of it."
rolling to $2
PBTS surging up on power hour.If a stock goes up on power hour especially on a friday afternoon then next week is gonna be awesome.Anyone agree??
"HI Guys,Saw this stock as a potential squeeze. 7.9 million float, 32.47% short and a short ratio of 1.84. It looks like this has some possibilities. What do you guys think? Thanks,"
Load up guyzz..
Here we go!!
Iceberg. Appropriately named hedge fund. They'll go down like they hit an iceberg shorting a dollar stock that could easily go up 10X or more if it catches fire.
"Short playing risky game with this one, never ever underestimate Hong Kong"
What else does this company do besides the crypto mining?
