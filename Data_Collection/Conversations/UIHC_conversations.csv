"What does this mean?>>â€¢ As a result, UIHC's exposure from potential future events this year in the catastrophe program is expected to be limited to approximately $9M, the company said.""I'm very pleased that our downside risk from subsequent events this year is limited,"" stated President and CFO of UPC Insurance.<"
"I have inquired a little. I have read several pages on UIHC it seems a really good opportunity, if it goes down I can still buy 10000 pieces we will see. However, surely after their process of improvement of the bisnes is finished, the market will not be able to remain indifferent. It will probably be above 7 by mid-2022."
"Expecting 21,000,000 after tax charges.Only on the hook for 9,000,000 more for rest of season ? Am I reading that correctly ? About -0.48/sh storms hit + whatever positive gets to bottom line.If the storms can stay away as season winds down it might be a good start to a reset for the company ?"
"Time for a buy-out, with HUGE payments to management so that they will agree to it."
Huh up again. Nice.
Added 1500 shares.
B74 80% short in the last 10 days everyday going out of the S and P 600 that'll only track short sellers but the kicker here it's trading for 124 million dollars they have over three hundred million dollars in cash with major cash flow for the 27 million dollars from Ida lost that they declared with a hundred and fifty million dollars in debt long term this is a steal the company is trading for- 30 million dollars so any insurance company can make an offer and come out ahead with over 30 million dollars shorts are taking advantage time to buy
CAT damage driving down the stock ?

"Well I picked up $500 worth AH, adding to the dividend pot"
"Brooke Shirazi bought 69,554 paid $3.17 average"
Looks nice.
"3,060,005 share traded at 3.15 just nowhope the compant bought them"
Bought 3000 shares for long term
Why insiders are not buying?
New to this one. In with 2K shares this AM. Insider trades interesting and if 6% dividend is sustainable at this price = good investment.
"looks like they take any policy for the rev growth, we'll see if that will show on the reinsurance levels looking forward need to dig more"
"Since I had thought that $3.70 was the low, UIHC has dropped another 23%. Maybe we should wait for some officers (insiders, not the directors) to purchase some meaningful shares on the open market before buying any more shares? I'm going to sit out. But, in the interim, I'm willing to listen to Andrea, who sees $7/share by the summer 2022."
"And another insider buy on Sept 28th, 25000sh at 3.52"
"This company cannot manage its risk and it keeps paying us 6 cents per quarter as a ""dividend"" - but its really just liquidation proceeds."
