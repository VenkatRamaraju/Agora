UIHC looking very good here. Excellent balance sheet and likely to earn over $1 per share in 2020 !
nice move today - glad that I bought more shares at $13 and had some patience.
"WHOA! Up over 3% and a huge 2020 loss. Let's see the company lose more money, and maybe I can get out at breakeven? WHOA!"
Why insiders are not buying?
Current year consensus estimate has been rising over the past 2 months. And next year consensus estimate has risen over the past 2 months as well.
We're now at $5.25. Break below $5 coming?
Wells Fargo Elyse Greenspan says UIHC is a buyhttps://www.tipranks.com/analysts/elyse-greenspan
Are we bending over?
At least the worst is behind and brighter days ahead.
Love the liquidation of 6 cents/share out of equity. And who looks at book value? I see the $2's before it sells out.
Not sure why this is getting beaten up so badly. Hermine was barely a category 1 hurricane.
any tornado damage after latest storms in the south ?
"This is a #$%$ stock, but the management makes money! No ability to manage risk. Book value mean nothing!"
"""Excited for 2020."" The same message as the last 4 quarters?"
Hurricane season is over. Enjoy and celebrate as we will rise together!
"Bad quarter/first half. Solid company, def shopping season."
"What does this mean?>>• As a result, UIHC's exposure from potential future events this year in the catastrophe program is expected to be limited to approximately $9M, the company said.""I'm very pleased that our downside risk from subsequent events this year is limited,"" stated President and CFO of UPC Insurance.<"
whoa
Look for big sell off at open tomorrow.
"Since I had thought that $3.70 was the low, UIHC has dropped another 23%. Maybe we should wait for some officers (insiders, not the directors) to purchase some meaningful shares on the open market before buying any more shares? I'm going to sit out. But, in the interim, I'm willing to listen to Andrea, who sees $7/share by the summer 2022."
WHOA! $3.80. But what about book value? Means nothing - accounting BV does not equal FMV.
"KABOOM! United Insurance Holdings Corp. Reports Financial Results for Its First Quarter Ended March 31, 2021https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-insurance-holdings-corp-reports-200500892.html"
Removal from the Russell 2000? The Index is estimated to have to sell 1.7 million shares. Market capitalization is expected to be too low.
"I have inquired a little. I have read several pages on UIHC it seems a really good opportunity, if it goes down I can still buy 10000 pieces we will see. However, surely after their process of improvement of the bisnes is finished, the market will not be able to remain indifferent. It will probably be above 7 by mid-2022."
".27 loss per share vs. analyst estimate of .05 profit ( which was profit estimate of ,32 just 30 days ago and reduced) Look out below. Tiiiiiiimmmmmmber"
Whoa! $3.85
"Andy - you buying more shares given the breakdown in the share price? Of course, hurricane season is coming so matters could get (even) worse for UIHC."
"Anyone dare to buy any shares? I'm thinking low $5's, but maybe."
Buyer sub 10
Down today around 7%. More dismal news out?
Added 1500 shares.
"Uniqure (NASDAQ:QURE) is moving into the SmallCap 600 to replace United Insurance Holdings (NASDAQ:UIHC). Uniqure is +9.3% after hours, while UIHC is -3.2%."
can we liquidate and collect book value?
4me why you delete your amazing insightful comments already? Thought you were a short seller now I am just thinking you are a disgruntled former employee who got canned!
"KABOOM - anyone still look at book value vs fair market value? These losses appear to be a quarterly event - anyone think that management should be replaced? United Insurance (NASDAQ:UIHC) estimates current year catastrophe losses incurred during Q2 of ~$40M (approximately $31 million after tax), net of expected reinsurance recoveries.The losses includes claims from two new tropical storms and fourteen new PCS catastrophe events that occurred during the second quarter of 2021."
Book value only dropped $2.50/share during 2020. This is a BUY!
Estimates for the June quarter have been rising. Things are right now lining up very well for UIHC.
"Folks when you read the scare tactic posts of 5 cent a post short chatroom trolls or AMC trolls, remember that this is a highly speculative stock with high risks and potential for high rewards. However, when they keep repeating the potential for another $1.2 billion capital raise and the negative cash flow, remember that Netflix has raised Billions of capital including another $1.5 billion debt raise just last April and still is losing tons of money. Look at NFLX performance. That is the nature of these beasts. I am not saying that HMNY will definitely be the next NFLX but I am saying it has the potential of being so. And that potential is worth your highly speculative dollars. Not your nest egg , of course."
"Well I bought this because they insure my home. Now bill has gone up $ 100, but stock has gone down ↓40%, about $2700 on 300 shares!! So there goes the premise of making money in the stock to pay my insurance bill :( Guess they are going up in cost to get there earnings up to snuff. Heck, they missed by 50% in last round. What gives, is it storms fault, or do they run a lousy company?"
"Time for a buy-out, with HUGE payments to management so that they will agree to it."
"analyst estimate never made sense, company stated a 27M damage claim plus the usual 35c profit in a good quarter comes to -0.27canalysts are incompetent or working for some shorts or bad data from yahoo ?"
I am buying more shares today. More recent insider buying. Lots of insider buying in last 6 months. Ticker has spent most of last decade at far higher prices. Today’s dip due to article with similar name.
"The merger vote was held on Friday - Anyone know if it passed? No company announcement. If they don't have the needed votes, the voting may be deferred (assuming that they want to proceed)."
Whoa
Huh up again. Nice.
Wrong board. Appologies
Guppy - What does this do for Book Value?GAAP EPS of -$1.73
"And another insider buy on Sept 28th, 25000sh at 3.52"
"Chubb catastrophe losses come in high in Q2•In light of the elevated number of natural catastrophes in Q2, Chubb (NYSE:CB) provides an estimate for what it suffered - $390M, or $315M after-tax. This stands against the company's internal projection for $280M pretax."
"Not all the skeletons are out of the closet on this one. The almost $30 million bite is just the beginning. These clowns cannot even organize a conference call let alone run an insurance company....""eh, we can't hear you... what was that question?... I still cannot hear that.... Let me check those numbers.....We must have technical difficulties......."""
"I love people who look at ""book value""! Accounting ploys not representative of fair market value. Time for UIHC to sell out - maybe then we can see $8."
Won't be trading this stock again. Don't trust mgmt.
I dunno. These earnings any good??
"Heck, the quarter ain't even over yet...."
We've now seen the $3's (top end). Could we see the $2's. Any chance that management would decide to sell out? I'd take $7.50. It's a bloodbath with the inability to price risk.
"Good consolidation period of three weeks, so now looking for a good push above the most recent highs, maybe it gets to $9 soon."
Now this stock should be free to climb up to $9 maybe now that expiration Friday has passed.
I assume there is an understanding of hurricane deductibles especially in Florida. If not it might be worth a little study. Not familiar with Texas.
"Are you delusional??? S & P up 29%, & D.Jones 23%, while UIHC is DOWN 25% over the last yr???This company, & it’s inept leaders, is a joke..."
Is this thing going bk?
did UIHC have any exposure in counties hit by Michael ?wish 10Ks forced more info on exposure by county etc
"HI- I SEE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS MESSAGE BOARD ABOUT WHICH STOCK TO BUY (MAINLY INS.) BUT THEY ARE MISSING THE BOAT WHILE THEIR HEAD IS IN THE SAND! ( NO DISRESPECT BUT IT IS THE BEST-AGAIN BY FAR- EVEN WITH DOW DOWN! THE BEST IS ""UVE"" & DON'T BELIEVE ME LOOK YOURSELF! UVE- WITH THE HURRICANES THEY STILL MADE A PROFIT-PROFIT-PROFIT! YOU COULD OF BOUGHT IT FOR AROUND 22.50 (PRIOR TO THEIR RECENT 1ST QRT. ANNOUNCEMENT) NOW $26.00 3-4 DAYS LATER! WHAT YOU HAVE WITH UVE IS THE BEST MGT./EVERY QT. EPS. BETTER? DIV AROUND 2.30 & INCREASED WITH A SPECIAL DIV./ B+ RATING/ SOME STOCK BUY BACK BUT MAINLY ""TERRIFIC MGT"". THEY ALREADY HAVE A GOOD EARNINGS GAIN TO START OFF THE YR. & JUST MEETING LAST YRS 2ND.QT (ABOVE EXPECTATIONS) WOULD BE VERY GOOD!

THEY ARE NOW WRITING IN 19 OTHER STATES! BOTTOM LINE-THEY COULD HAVE A GREAT YR.! NO- I'M NOT PROMOTING IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE PROMOTED THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY IS STARTING TO TAKE NOTICE!"
Did deepak resign or get fired? Just curious since I don't see any news here...?...??
Ouch. That must hurt
Would like to see a close at or near 23 with good volume. Then I think we might be on the move.
"I see last wknd in Barrons, two more ‘Insiders’ purchased a large # of shares. AND, the prior wk, THREE ‘Insiders’ purchased a substantially-larger # of shares. Always a good sign, right?"
Somebody likes UIHC today. About time too. Hopefully the weather gets really boring for awhile.
"More insider buying, Sept 27th at 3.66……10,000 shares!"
"Very pleasant surprise in the operations of UIHC. Awesome Q2 earnings of $0.20 per share, hugely beating the consensus expection of -$0.05 per share. This compares to Q2 loss of $0.08 per share a year ago.The beat was a surprise of 500%. UIHC is well undervalued and is likely headed back to $13 per share."
CAT damage driving down the stock ?
"Ok so a good 20 days of consolidation... now, as soon as expiration friday passes, I bet it can be allowed to succeed and crank up to $9. Natural disasters have subsided for awhile so maybe claims are down. Winter wasn’t terrible except for TX. FL and other southern states should collect lotta premiums."
"@Andy and @guppy, anything left in the kid's college fund now? How does a 30% haircut feel? Like I said before, some people just need to stick with mutual funds or they are going to be taken to the cleaners."
Some insurance company ought to take UIHC out of its misery and buy them out for around $10. Fire all the incompetent executives. I wonder if the top executives have padded their severance pay upon a change in ownership?
"We are bending over - thank you sir, may I have another"
Retained loss ratio is very good. Ceding more risk off to reinsurance protecting capitol. Looking a bit better for me. Moving to balance commercial and personal line risk is good.
"Nice to see the strong revenues. Balance sheet is great while stock price is undervalued, that is why UIHC are repurchasing millions of dollars worth of stock."
anyone thinks this is a good buy?
My whole screen is green! Except UIHC
"30% YOY sales increase, lower loss ratio, new markets, etc.... a great quarter! After the shorts have their fun pushing down, a great opportunity to get in!"
"HISTORY: ""The market expects United Insurance Holdings (UIHC) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues."""
HRTG - I've seen a number of posts recommending the shares. I started to follow the company. Can anyone explain the 20% drop during this month? Much more than a correction. I don't need to own another UIHC.
Anyone know why this is rocketing today.
Anyone think that the shares can breakdown to $4.25?
Anyone have an opinion on whether they beat analyst expectations of $0.50?
Definitely better to be in Heritage right now. They have no Carolinas exposure. That's where the hurricane hit land. My recommendation is to move $ from UIHC to HRTG before mid-March ER.
UIHC better earnings than I had expected. Revenues also very strong. Good to see business is stable and headed up.
Love the liquidation of the company with it paying 6 cents per quarter as it bleeds losses.
huge beat earnings $0.56
"United Insurance Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ: UIHC) (UPC Insurance or the Company), a property and casualty insurance holding company, today announced estimated current year catastrophe losses incurred from October 1, 2020 to November 30, 2020 between $85 million and $100 million before income taxes (approximately $67 million to $79 million after tax), net of expected reinsurance recoveries. The Company’s fourth quarter catastrophe losses through November 30, 2020 included claims from three new named windstorms (Hurricane Delta, Hurricane Zeta, and Tropical Storm Eta) and other non-named windstorm catastrophe events."
"Expecting 21,000,000 after tax charges.Only on the hook for 9,000,000 more for rest of season ? Am I reading that correctly ? About -0.48/sh storms hit + whatever positive gets to bottom line.If the storms can stay away as season winds down it might be a good start to a reset for the company ?"
"Well I picked up $500 worth AH, adding to the dividend pot"
"Brooke Shirazi bought 69,554 paid $3.17 average"
wow... $83m in retain losses from Harvey and Irma. Let Family Security Insurance Company do your dirty work!
Great ride from an unlikely quarters...loaded at $4.50 just a fortnight ago. Amazing stuff. Will ride it to $7ish on remaining position
Looks the the market likes the results! Nice stock residing in Value Town.
beats analyst expectations
"Until there is new leadership, expect more mediocre results."
Averaged up a bit. Just too tempting at these levels. Louisiana will hurt but it's only 6% of portfolio. New hurricane forming off Africa headed towards New York. Better than Florida but with Interboro acquisition it will still hurt if it does hit shore.
"Will see another Quarter, then access. It has been a rough run. Interested in seeing how new management structure can impact UPC. Losses, reinsurance, expenses. Tough balance. Great to see these numbers."
Acct boating. You live in Florida? I am hearing the damage is minimal but media outlets are hyping it up like the damage is terrible.
United Insurance estimates $24M in Q1 catastrophe losses!!!!!!!!!!!!!Anyone going to recalculate book value?
B74 80% short in the last 10 days everyday going out of the S and P 600 that'll only track short sellers but the kicker here it's trading for 124 million dollars they have over three hundred million dollars in cash with major cash flow for the 27 million dollars from Ida lost that they declared with a hundred and fifty million dollars in debt long term this is a steal the company is trading for- 30 million dollars so any insurance company can make an offer and come out ahead with over 30 million dollars shorts are taking advantage time to buy
"Nice to see UIHC earn a profit from their core net income.Core income per share came in at 21 cents per share. This was 3X of the prior year's quarter which had 7 cents per share. Things are improving for UIHC, just the stock price is down significantly, but in a good position to rise back up as operating business is strong."
KaBOOM - just another day in paradise with UIHC. KaBOOM
Bought 3000 shares for long term
"592K block traded at the close, maybe an unhappy shareholder is finally out of the way"
"looks like they take any policy for the rev growth, we'll see if that will show on the reinsurance levels looking forward need to dig more"
Farhad may be feeling more pain than UIHCshort low buy high
Excellent. UIHC was expected to hit $0.32 per share for core earnings. Instead UIHC reported $0.36 per share. This is very good. UIHC beat estimates by 13%. The company is growing. Balance sheet is strong. Margins are very good. This company is doing better than I expected. We likely will hit that $32 per share earlier than I previously said.
I took a look at today's announcement and also listened to the conference call. The management team are frankly clueless and don't have a command of the Company's business.
https://www.reuters.com/companies/UIHC.O/key-metrics you can see per share data--- both book and tangible well above $9 per share
"July 19, 2019 - Watch out below. UIHC should sell out. United Insurance Holdings Corp. (UIHC) (UPC Insurance or the Company), a property and casualty insurance holding company, announced today that it expects to incur approximately $16 million of net retained catastrophe losses primarily from new wind and hail events in Texas and Louisiana for the quarter ended June 30, 2019. During the second quarter of 2019, the Company also experienced approximately $15 million of adverse reserve development stemming from accident year 2018 from both catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses primarily in Florida."
"3,060,005 share traded at 3.15 just nowhope the compant bought them"
Should hit $10 in early 2017
"If you remove that Net unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, the core earnings are dismal. Return on equity 2.4%. Does the CEO have a crystal ball on the future performance of UIHC? >> ""While elevated levels of both cat and noncat losses hurt our operating results in Q1, I am confident that our earnings power is better than it has ever been, and we are looking forward to the remainder of 2019.""<"
CNCK looks poised to move higher. start your research on it now. It has been creeping up and volume is buildings.
Looks nice.
Good buying coming into the close today to finish off the week. Glad to see it.
How low can it go? Thinking about some bottom feeding here.
Is this company a #$%$
Looks like a good opportunity to unlock value and at 50% discount to book and even a good discount to cash on hand. Insider buying in the low 5's recently too
Below book value...makes a candidate for an acquisition or buyout by another insurance company looking to expand marketshare on the cheap or gain efficiencies with operations.
63c per share vs 49c and high est if 56c beats revenues 183 vs 157very nice Q
"When book value is -0-, will UIHC still be around?"
Hurricane Matthew has insurance companies with Florida risk dropping. It may be a bad one.
"4me - I keep asking but you provide no specificity. 1. Who Quit?2. Who are the employees getting retention bonuses? Maybe with these two questions spelled out, you can provide details as your posts are much too general. From the answers to these two questions, analysis and confirmations can thereafter occur."
"@guppy and @Andy Have you two lost the kids' college fund yet? LOL. As I said before, some folks need to just stick to mutual funds."
"UIHC hits strong revenue and has very nice improvement over prior year's Q4.For Q4 2018, UIHC had loss before income tax of $19.4 million.For Q4 2019, UIHC had loss before income tax $5.3 million.The trend is your friend. UIHC heading rapidly toward profits in 2020. I think we will soon see UIHC over $18 per share."
Trimming the book should be good going forward.
Excellent results yesterday posted by UVE. This bodes very well for upcoming results to be posted by UIHC.
Anyone remember when UIHC was over $20?
New to this one. In with 2K shares this AM. Insider trades interesting and if 6% dividend is sustainable at this price = good investment.
