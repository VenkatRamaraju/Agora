"The reverse auction begins, $233, do we hear, $230? $230 ....do we hear $220? Shorties have to short."
If you bought last night in after hours you are down 20% good trading stock not a long term buy & hold
Anyone here BE HONEST pay $298 in after hours last night? It was just $205 recently.
"Growth is slowing, competition is headwinds, and inflation is here. And COUP is up from $210 to $257 in a week? It's not just COUP. Look at NET. The market is a joke."
Congrats  to everyone COUP @ new 52 week lows! R.I.P.
"When one of the major banks (JPM) puts a price target of $130.00 for (COUP) and is trading @ $225.00 somebody is not telling the truth, and by the looks of it a lot of small investors will be holding the bag, as usual, another( Booyah ) for the Gringo's."
"Great company with good product and strong momentum. Might retest the all time highs in the next few months. At some point the bigger players are ought to buy COUPA, Alterix, Blackline before they get much bigger!"
Boom!!! Sold half my position now. Congrats to all the other longs!
Slowest among cloud
A lot of forces at play here bigger than Coupa People are concerned about interest rates and inflation affecting profitability of all companies
"The posts on the COUP board are a microcosm of what is problematic with today's stock market. The markets are grossly overbought and overvalued. COUP went all the way up to $298 in after hours earlier. And yet, you read posts from those long the stock complaining that they couldn't find any news to make it go ""down."" The greed is unbelievable. Why didn't you all take your profit at $297-$298 when you had it earlier? Wait, let me guess. You thought it would fly over $300. Now it's trading at $275, still an amazing profit from the $210 where it was 2 weeks ago."
"There was no news from the conference call that would have made it fall, thats just shorts, who are getting killed, trying to cause a panic and get some money back. COUP will be over $300 tomorrow. Analysts will be falling all over themselves raising price targets."
sold all my shares at pop..
"COUP is consistently disappointing. YTD down whopping 36%, will the company ever make profit? Is it worth increasing the position at $200-$225 range?"
"While the price action indicates a downdraft, no change fundamentally. I expect new all time highs this quarter."
Over bought
This is insane. It went from being up 13% to beingup 4%. At this rate it may actually go negative
Coupa Software 2Q Loss Widens on Higher Expenses
Is COUP still $298? Not near a pc or cellular device to see quotes.
Congrats. Longs
Can you buy or see options in after hours?
Someone sold 298 after hours; genius trade COUP
$298 last night or $250 now? Which one? COUP R.I.P.
Up $100 or 50% since an analyst downgraded COUP LOL 
I hold a decent amount of $COUP. I hope it goes up after earnings but it's consistently gone down after earnings. Fingers crossed but be prepared for the potential drop.
RBC Capital downgrade stock on august 17 at $300.00 to $210.00. Sep 7 stock will go down after earing.
"In a note this morning, JP Morgan raised their 12 month price target on COUP from $125 to $130. Not a typo. Others average higher, around $275."
What’s going on with COUP? Since Feb it has been constantly dropping. I still hold but the financials look great but the stock not
Anyone else suspecting Gee Davey is a competitor or disgruntled ex employee (or both)?
yaaaaa. from 210 to 256 in less than a month. this is heading to 230s by end of week. earnings wasnt strong enough to propel higher
The professional shorts are betting against COUP. They may know something we don't.
"Sold half my position, over valued stock"
Hedge fund(s) are keeping it down!!
"And here is another way overvalue stock (COUP) real value for this stock is no more than $10.00 at the very most and that is already = over 20 X last 4 quarters earnings, looks like the chickens are coming home to eat, Bam, Bam, Booyah."
"Coupa software amazing butPAYO, PSFE, FINV, GGPI, STAF and MVST and NIO and ASTR should be in your interest too"

"horrible. COUP almost hit $300 and then drops back to $255 after stellar earnings. Fortunately, I sold half my position at $298 but this is just sad."
based on company's press release - it is a 'meh' quarter at best. Will listen to call later. but lot of speculative calls were bought so it could levitate for couple of days or 1-2 week.
All cloud are up except this
