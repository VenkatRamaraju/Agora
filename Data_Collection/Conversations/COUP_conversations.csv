This is insane. It went from being up 13% to beingup 4%. At this rate it may actually go negative
So Tmrow this will be around $282 then $300+ next wk. then $500 in July. Then a tiny drop then $750 by September.....
"This move will be faded. There's been no base formed, no backing and filling, just a parabolic move. I'm expecting a sell on the news event. No, I'm not short COUP, I'd consider going long after the dust settles."

Coupa Software 2Q Loss Widens on Higher Expenses
Ladies & Gentlemen welcome to a new 52 week low
Consolidated let’s pop
People sold on whatever news came out
based on company's press release - it is a 'meh' quarter at best. Will listen to call later. but lot of speculative calls were bought so it could levitate for couple of days or 1-2 week.
Hilarious overreaction. Just bought some call options for Dec 21st. This baby will bounce back nicely. See you all in Maui!
MISS ON GUIDANCE. NEXT QUARTER NON GAAP earnings is much lower than estimates. THey are buying highly unprofitable revenue with their acquisitions.
$298 last night or $250 now? Which one? COUP R.I.P.
And it goes up LOL
Sold all of my puts at a substantial loss. Could have daited but my condition was not goog
If you bought last night in after hours you are down 20% good trading stock not a long term buy & hold
My account on Coupa has been frozen for several weeks. Connected with support 4 straight days. No resolution in sight. Customer support horrible. This should be a huge short as pandemic eases.
Lock in your profits if you bought! there will be a pull back to 140-144 before it goes up more
"Why is Coupa up so much more than it's peers? It is really much higher, and they all have nice gains so far for the day. What would cause a company with no earnings to run faster than the others in such a big way?"
"Coup stock jump almost 20% in 2 back to back day. This is how clear insider trading working.Friday End it was one of weakest in high flyer list, make me long in stock and very nurvous I sold cover 365 calls for small premium.Monday it was going higher and I can't figure out why so I sold stock and make those calls naked. Make profit on stock as I got them at 355 net price (When remove premium I got from Puts and naked call)But then walmart agreement which may worth may be $1M /year. Sure Walmart recognization is big deal but is it worth 20% of already very very high valuation. No.Only reason it happen because there are people with insider knowledge load up and load even more after news which basically make other to buy (Herd mentality) or cover short ( Loss getting out of control)"
Going down to $80-90. No growth at all. Will crash before next earnings.
"Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 beats by $0.15; GAAP EPS of -$0.88 misses by $0.04.Revenue of $132.96M (+30.6% Y/Y) beats by $8.97M.For Q4, sees revenues of ~$145M- $146M vs. consensus of ~$129.4M, with adj. EPS loss of $0.11 to $0.13 per share"
If the DOW ends the day under 26000 kiss the three COUP digits good bye !See you at $85...
Congrats. Longs
Someone sold 298 after hours; genius trade COUP
I see a tertiary offering coming. Coupa is clearly overvalued. The last acquisition was done with cash not stock. The company being acquired probably refused a stock based acquisition for fear of sudden loss of value. So Coupa will need to beef up its coffers again. At this valuation -- I think it makes sense to sell some stock again. maybe 7 million at 100 will net them approx 650 million after fees. They can use it for future acquisitions.
"Sold half my position, over valued stock"
Prob gonna see 220 or lower after earnings
beats on both and higher guidance . Congrats longs
A good conference should tilt us obn the green side
Comming $210.00 within 2 weeks.
More competition for coupa. Competition will only add to margin pressurehttps://spendmatters.com/2019/01/17/certify-a-te-veteran-launches-a-procure-to-pay-solution/
Shld have sold after hour
"This stock is truly out of control. Trading at over 50x sales. It's not even growing that much. It's a nice little concept, but there is a lot of competition in this space also. This reminds me of YELP a few years back, they drove that up to $130 or something and today it sits at $23. This will at some point have the same type of move, just have to play far, far out puts to make a substantial amount of money."
COUP $298 up $35 still like it was in after hours when earnings were announced?
"All Convertible holder without Hedge, I think this is start of end. Even great earning investor now start finding weak point and focusing.We talking stock at 40-50 time revenue specially when we seen growth in past 3 month but next 3 month we may see nothing."
"Here is how much overvalued this company is. Sap Ariba has better overall rating and majority market share, most vendors on platform and lot more.But if you think they can gain market share and Market full potential $10B/year at peak faster at 2025 ( It's $5B) And they get 30% market share = $3B/year revenue in 2025, current market cap still way too high.Current market cap :- $20B + $3B convertible market cap + $2B stock grant ( $330M+/year worth in RSU/ year) = $25B market cap.at $3B it trading 40+ time revenue currently and even peak sale it will have hard time justify such valuation."
"Another look at what Churchill Swartz & Associate can manipulate any stock that's listed for trading, All you have to do is look at (COUP) they pumped it up to over $280.00 only to sell off as usual just before the option expires, Bam, the amount of $$$$ they take from investors is unreal,Booyah."

There is no reason for the big boys to buy this lame stock. No catalyst and It will be meandering around the 52 week low level until the earnings next month then takes 10+% dive because of the usual conservative guidance. You heard it here first!
"Any ideas what is going on with this? Price/TTM Sales all the way down to 46.5, definitely a steal at this valuation"
"I shorted 250 call yesterday just for profit. Didn't look deeper in Notes. Today I was looking more to understand what really going as I thought it should drop.What I found is very fishy transaction that favor overwhelmingly those convertible holder.Here is detail.1.> they using 167.7M to repurchase $33M worth of facevalue issued just 2 year ago. (Basically taking 133M in loss)2.> they going to retire $55M additiona based on average price after offering which is reason it higher, Those convertible holder is covering their short and controling price so they can get higher price for their offer. I expect 245+ price. 3.> Now if price crash while they don't have short is risk, but here is yet another free lunch. 281.9M additional will used to purchase more of those convertible.In short company issue $1.38B worth of debt with convertible at $196 and Spend nearly $750M retired Old Convertible <$150M total debt. Company hardly relevant in real world so why take $600M loss specially at time where global economy going down by 6% and worst recession ever.Just amazing how such fishy deal continue happen so openly and no one even question it."
"You people didn’t think a $35 gain after hours would hold, really??That’s too big a move in a couple hours"
Totally insane reaction like MDB
"SFIX and CASY would also have been very good Pure Earnings Short Sell plays for today. Both are down in the AH session in direct response to disappointing ER's. I think right now, for the next 2-3 months, there are some excellent opportunities to make $ on Pure Earnings Short Sells because the market as a whole is trading too high, a recession has just begun, there is huge uncertainty going forward, and for the next few months ALL ER's, in terms of numbers, should reflect the economic weakness caused by the Pandemic."
Up $100 or 50% since an analyst downgraded COUP LOL 
"COUP-0.80%Benzinga InsightsFri, September 10, 2021, 5:18 PMIn this article:COUP-0.80%Leslie C.G. Campbell, insider at Coupa Software (NASDAQ:COUP), made a large insider sell on September 9, according to a new SEC filing.What Happened: A Form 4 filing from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday showed that Campbell sold 2,250 shares of Coupa Software at a price of $253.28 per share. The total transaction amounted to $569,880.Any questions on the future of this turd? Don't forget ""Coupa Cares"""
"This stock should take a beating tomorrow. Although MSFT overall cloud revenue was up, the b2b or close competitor to COUP was down. That as well as the insider trading should make for a pullback tomorrow"
COUP is up 5.01% to 238.49
"Seems the moment I exit, the tide turn around. If this closes below 306, that would be a major reversal as it will be more than 2% down day on the close basis that hasn't happened in months"
Trades at to high a multiple to sales.
They've shown zero margin expansion and ever-growing GAAP losses. Why would anyone buy this stock? #short
"The earnings were good  BUT look at the revenues, net and market cap, I can’t imagine this staying +$16"
"In case any of u shorts wanna chime in with your BS again, $COUP is growing exponentially. Just check out their career page. https://jobs.lever.co/coupa/"
I shorted at 264 before the close then at 284 and at 298 after the closeThank God the damage has been contained
"Textbook Silicon Valley VC pump and dump. Man, someone write a case history on this in 12 months."
"I might have hit the bull's eye this morning when I said that (COUP) will be under $260.00 by Friday, July 16th,2021, I think I saw too many rats on wall street and getting a little clue how they operate, Bam, Bam,Boom."
All down but coup is up. Seems odd
"Covered my COUP Short Sell at $222.91 average price, for a modest loss of just over $1.4k. Time to move on to better things! Good Luck to All."
"Unusual Put Volume in Coupa. Hope they are right and sucker drops next week....From Nasdaq Site: Coupa Software Inc (Symbol: COUP) saw options trading volume of 10,003 contracts, representing approximately 1.0 million underlying shares or approximately 43.3% of COUP's average daily trading volume over the past month, of 2.3 million shares. Particularly high volume was seen for the $230 strike put option expiring July 02, 2020, with 1,034 contracts trading so far today, representing approximately 103,400 underlying shares of COUP."
"Investors, check out the CNBC ""Mad Money"" T.V. segment (approx. 6 minutes) on December 4, 2018with Coupa Software CEO and Chairman Rob Bernstein. It is a must-watch interview andnaturally very bullish on company and its future prospects. (Go to CNBC website and just put in symbol in the upper right hand ""Search quotes, news, & video"" box.) COUPA is identified as ""the Salesforce (CRM) of expense management."" Cramer has beencorrectly bullish on cloud software companies for some time and this company is one of them."
Is COUP still $298? Not near a pc or cellular device to see quotes.
COUP down $10 up $15 so net gain +$5 on huge blowout earnings
The other cloud stocks are up only 0.5%. This one is 5% up. Confusing - buy or short. Its revenue and profit doesn’t align with the stock price.
Is COUP on track with its earnings report? Or it is time to bail out?
"The Barrons article yesterday about a software bubble is a great excuse for program selling to wash out weak hands. COUP, OKTA, AYX, etc., are all being crushed for today. Their growth rate will have them back up in a short while. Hang on if you have them and watch for buying opportunity if you've been waiting."
sold all my shares at pop..
Agree. Check their corporate financial portal. COUP is going to meet the numbers next week
"Walmart PR - $30-40 jumpCasey PR - $10-20 jumpAt this rate if COUP just publish 1 PR per month, it can be $10K in no time"
"Watching LULU as a potentially interesting Pure Earnings play for Thursday. They report AH on Thursday. What I want to see is a run-up in price over the next 3 days, leading up to the release. I want a 10%+ upside move BEFORE Thursday afternoon. If that happens, and it might because LULU has a ""cult following"" that is prone to irrational exuberance, I think LULU could be a very attractive Short Sell just before market close on Thursday. But ONLY if it goes up significantly from current price. Smart Earnings traders plan ahead like this, and are also open to trying to ride up the wave of Irrational Exuberance by going Long as a Pre-earnings play, meaning Long LULU but ONLY as a day/momentum trade and NOT to hold through the ER."
Mere $179mm rev. Not sure why this is popping
No volume. Dead stock.
Anyone else is shorting before earnings?
"PRG is 2+ when you include convertible debt.Growth isn't going higher like most analyst thought given on paper it help save money. While analyst trying to bail out big and powerful don't listen them. They will keep talking that better day coming but their past performance is mediocre and They have about same product that 2000 bubble hot star Ariba, ITWO, Commerce One and other have. Difference is those company growing revenue at 100% rate but this one 30%. Other than that valuation and everything is same.I was investor and burn badly in 2000 in all 3 name I put because those 100% growth suddenly go negative with little to no warning. Enterprise spending is not very predicitive specially when it claim that it actually save money. Being in IT industry i know every company make theoritical case on how it can save so much money but in reality those benefit never materialized.I would invest in software company who can help get more business than one who save money."
"Up almost an additional 1X TTM sales today! The sky is the limit on this one, doubt it will ever go down."
"This stock is so overbought it's laughable. The RSI is at 75 now. It's not alone though, the entire Nasdaq is ignoring the recession."
I really do not understand the valuations on companies like these anymore. 30X or more of sales...not earnings. Reality check there are no earnings.
"Anyone like COUP $240 here pre market? Down from $360. Man when these stocks fall, they fall fast. Down 33% with no bottom in sight."
News is out short it
This stock has got to be over bought at this level. Need a pull back to 70 to re-enter. Sold majority at 90. Nice profit for Jan.
"After such a terrible analyst day presentation, I'm starting to think that Coupa's mgt team is amateurish and not up to the task at this stage of the company's growth."
"When you beat earnings as huge as we just did we should be looking at new 52 week highs next. Look at these numbers!COUPA SOFTWARE (COUP) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of 366.67% and 7.87%, respectively, for the quarter ended October 2018."
"Seems like as more positive news is flowing in, traders are building the confidence to start moving some money to more cheaper stocks and for them COUP seems expensive. More cheaper options are opening up and money may start to move out from the expensive stocks. It seems like COUP may trade side ways for short term."
"$MAXR Almost $2B in revenue market cap $1B. $COUP,$SHOP,$TWLO and $BYND"
"In a note this morning, JP Morgan raised their 12 month price target on COUP from $125 to $130. Not a typo. Others average higher, around $275."
There is no way of this high valuation. It needs to have revenue of a billion to have 20B valuation. Right now it is way too high valuation.
BOOM!!!
COUP is not reacting to Nasdaq today. Any thoughts?
I think Coupa is a great acquisition target within the next 6-12 months. Lots of money to be made on this great company and business model.
Right after I buy brilliant
RBC Capital downgrade stock on august 17 at $300.00 to $210.00. Sep 7 stock will go down after earing.
This stock should be 120. Since it was 90ish no news has came out to justify the huge jump.
"Bought some today. I have been in and out of COUP since its IPO last year and have made good profit. It is a long term hold , should be around $100 next year."
"I love COUP since $122, down from $150......BUT this move from $240 to $316 is stretched, to say the least, considering Wal-Mart was always a customer."
Can you buy or see options in after hours?
"If its doing so well, why is the stock falling consistently? Maybe buy the dip? What do you guys think?"
"After close to 600,000 shares trading fake hands the stock close unchanged, the joke of the day fr.om your bobbleheads of wall street, Booyah"
How low can this go?
A lot of forces at play here bigger than Coupa People are concerned about interest rates and inflation affecting profitability of all companies
80% rise in a stock price in a month will simply not be sustainable!!
About time!
"(COUP) is like a tub of ice cream left in the heat, What happens?"
"Short now making fun of longs just longs were doing for short just this morning.Retail long and Retail short is only reason this market still somewhat real. Those so called expert use our trading data and manipulate in direction easiest or desired by multi billionaire crooks where support is. Reality is We all getting played by big boys. So it's not subject to make fun. Many who thought they are next millionaire, their dream scattered and it's not thing to joy. I reach my first million fighting this market and it took 12 year even I make very good money both in job and average on market (After having devasting 4 first year where I lose all most all my saving). It's long road and many different experience.I never thought short just 200 Tesla at $1100 and adding 2 more short call at $1400 will cause so much damage to my account but it did so. Never thought $SHOP can go $1000+, $QQQ go so much out of sync with $SPY, $COUP can go $300, $AMZN to $3300.Everything combined, My stock account move $100K+ today from morning to Evening. And I just don't know how it will tommorow. I am at mercy of those big boys as long as they can manipulate majority of people here.This will continue as long as we play their game. If everyone start doing what make sense and not listen to those, We always have fair market and you can invest any time and enter reasonable market.Not very oversold /Not very over brought. I don't think it ever possible but just for thought."
Not Selling ... obviously going to to back up.
"Folks -- I did some analysis on Q2 and Q3 reports -- Here is my take on it . looks like growth has flattened. Essentially no billings growth while stock price is at 23 times sales currently. Comments welcome from all longs and shorts.Q2Deferred Revenues 127809Q2 Subscription Revenues = 55374q1 Deferred Revenues 120458Increase in differed revenues = 7351Subscription billings = subscription revenue + deferred revenues increase = 62725Q3Deferred REvenues = 128683Q3 Subscripion revenues = 60,559Q2 Deferred Revenues 127809Increase in differed revenues = 874 Q3 subscription billings = subscription revenue + deferred revenues increase = 61433So there was no growth in billings from Q2 to Q3 and thats why they are predicting relatively flat Q4they may beat it but the growth is goneAlso look at the expected share count for Q4 = 65 million.2019 revenue per share = 260/65 = 4Price to sales = 92/4 = 23You go figure out if this is worth 23 times sales with flat revenue growth Q2 to Q3"
"Hopefully this is consolidation until the next leg up. I feel their software is exactly what every business would want, to SAVE money!"
"The posts on the COUP board are a microcosm of what is problematic with today's stock market. The markets are grossly overbought and overvalued. COUP went all the way up to $298 in after hours earlier. And yet, you read posts from those long the stock complaining that they couldn't find any news to make it go ""down."" The greed is unbelievable. Why didn't you all take your profit at $297-$298 when you had it earlier? Wait, let me guess. You thought it would fly over $300. Now it's trading at $275, still an amazing profit from the $210 where it was 2 weeks ago."
COUP is heading to $270
is this something sellers on shopify would use? sorry for the question. i just found this stock and am trying to figure out what they do. thanks in advance.
what's going on with $COUP pumped 12% and now dumped to 6.5% within couple of mins
COUP is down 5.96% to 236.00
"Puts for August are super strong, in some cases they are positive irrespective of today's 2.5% up move"
IV dropping like a rock on OTM puts
"My first post here, so forgive me any inappropriate content. I sure need to understand the community a bit more than just on this board. But I thought I'd just post some of my thinking to get myself started:To understand Coupa and to get a better baseline for a comparison with their competitors, I'd suggest to have a look on their product vision and the aquisitions they've been successfully implementing into their core over the last couple of years. Because that's where they are getting the edge over the legacy corporations like Oracle, SAPAriba and the like.Take the ""sourcing"" part of their platform: Until few years ago, the majority of the other players in the market were running far ahead of Coupa, the RFx product has simply not been competitive for any large scale buying with even a medium complexity (components, cost-breakdowns, indirect materials, logistics). With the aquisition of Trade-Extensions, Coupa inherited a best-of-breed solution and catapulted themselves into the ""Leader"" quadrant of almost all analysts (Google sourcing optimization: You will find that NONE of the competitors can offer that except Jaggaer, who are challenged by their multi-solution offer). SAPAriba can offer a plugged-in solution by Keelvar (wich is an amazing product) but no legacy support, Ivalua is working hard on the pieces it requires, but has no roadmap to commit to... etc pp... Llamasoft would be an alternative, but is adressing a completely different market and doesn't come with any P2P: https://spendmatters.com/uk/coupa-acquires-trade-extensions-leading-sourcing-optimisation-software-provider/Travel (Competing with SAPConcour, not SAPAriba): Same story there: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coupa-gunning-sap-concur-share-210000439.htmlExternal workforce (Some overlap with Workday): https://spendmatters.com/2018/09/04/coupa-acquires-dcr-workforce-giving-its-services-maestro-a-full-symphony-orchestra/Contract management (another highlight of their most recent buys of what has been another best-of-breed): https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coupa-completes-acquisition-of-contract-lifecycle-management-leader-exari-300844792.htmlNow, you sure would be right in pointing out the complex challenge to integrate foreign code to your legacy platform - and THAT'S what make Coupa outstanding... Their success manifest in integration-timelines of a few month to make any of the new functionalities available to their existing costomers on their core platform. (Remember Emptoris /IBM anyone?)Coupa's last move came totally unexpected by acquiring ""Bellin"", a German treasury management company/product (with an amazing customer base of privately owned European / German market leaders): https://spendmatters.com/2020/06/12/coupa-acquires-bellin-to-add-treasury-management-and-boost-payments-capabilities/This is a serious indication that Coupa will not be limiting themselves competing for the attention of just CPOs anymore, with Bellin they become a serious interest of any CFO as much - and that's just confirming that they are addressing a market far beyond P2P or S2P... Now, if that is going to prove the market? Maybe not in the short term... it might take a while until every analyst realizes what they are about to create. But I am optimistic that one won't lose any money if it's invested with an horizon of just a few years.I bought in 2018 for 55.- and have 10 years to retirement... couldn't be more relaxed now. ;-)"
"Here we go, exactly as I anticipated, collapse in stock price even though the ER numbers look fairly decent at first glance... Why?? Overvalued, GROSSLY!"
"Happily staying Short with COUP. Economic news looks bad, futures are down pointing to a weak open, and with the CC over, there is nothing I see that should give COUP an upside pop today. Bargain hunters coming in at $210 today?? Very unlikely. Maybe at $200 or less, later in the day. I continue to see a very good risk/reward scenario for staying Short on COUP and trying to ride her further down today."
what's going on with this today?
A couple more of those genius well-presented analysts days like the one we just had and this thing will be in the 50s!
"Great company with good product and strong momentum. Might retest the all time highs in the next few months. At some point the bigger players are ought to buy COUPA, Alterix, Blackline before they get much bigger!"
"When it comes to fake and bake nobody can beat us, just look at the shares of (COUP) Bam."
"Seems like a lot of logistics companies are interested in reducing the supply chain cost and efficiently route the trucks/ships. This would impact the oil stocks, but would help COUP kind of companies. Because of pandemic all companies are working to reduce the expenses using digital technology. COUP kind of companies have the reputation that it would quickly save millions of dollars by automating the procurement and efficiently manage expenses. That perception and momentum is working and that’s why no one is worried about the PE, multiples, etc. Some day earnings will take a prime seat and momentum will die, but not in near term."
Gonna crash overvalued by 50%
I hold a decent amount of $COUP. I hope it goes up after earnings but it's consistently gone down after earnings. Fingers crossed but be prepared for the potential drop.
"COUP had a good ER but not great, Recent acquisitions has increased the operating cost and margins. The guidance was ok too but not gangbuster for a growth stock. In todays market any cloud based growth stock does not report earnings/guidance BEYOND the expectations is punished due to high Forward looking PE ratio. Investors are not willing to pay unless there is a spectacular growth. Let the dust settle and investors willCome back because it is a great company with outstanding growth prospects."
Evercore increased PT to $340 today - this is the third analyst with over $300 PT
"This stock is up about $33 in 3 days this week for no reason. It's up 100% since April 1st, about $130. And it has a $17B market cap with $427M in revenue, and they're losing money. The Fed has created the biggest liquidity bubble in history, and you have momentum traders chasing companies that don't come close to supporting their valuation. As they say, this will end badly."
"There was no news from the conference call that would have made it fall, thats just shorts, who are getting killed, trying to cause a panic and get some money back. COUP will be over $300 tomorrow. Analysts will be falling all over themselves raising price targets."
"horrible. COUP almost hit $300 and then drops back to $255 after stellar earnings. Fortunately, I sold half my position at $298 but this is just sad."
10% pop to $80...LAST CHANCE TO ABOARD THIS TRAIN!!!!
"This was a good earnings report. The problem is though the stock is up about 200% since January! So even though there was profit taking today, the stock has had a huge run and is up over 10% in after hours. I was thinking of going short before the earnings report and I'm glad I didn't, however going short now in AH may make sense."
Buying opportunity
yaaaaa. from 210 to 256 in less than a month. this is heading to 230s by end of week. earnings wasnt strong enough to propel higher
"Did Coupa Software discover a cure for cancer? Do they have a vaccine for Covid-19? Nope. But it does have an RSI of 76. Since April 1, the stock has risen from $120 to $272. That's in less than 3 months. Apparently valuations don't matter."
Price target $370
"Ladies & Gentlemen, here we are showing you what we can do, we took from the average investor account over $150 Million in the last 6 trading days just from 1 stock (COUP) it's all legal and nothing anyone of you can do about it , BOOYAH."
"I've been spot on with COUP. Like I said 2 weeks ago, heading to $300+! It's already back to almost $250. Looking forward to $300+ by next earnings!!!"
They had a 60% increase from last years first quarter. Amazing Probably see 115-120 tomorrow https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coupa-software-reports-financial-results-200500770.html
Heading to $300+ after September earnings folks. You heard it here first! $COUP flatlining and ready to climb back up!!!
I just bought a little more.
"Coupa software is a Nasdaq stock that's losing money, with a $20B market cap. I don't know how anyone can justify paying these prices for a stock with about $400m in revenue, no earnings, no dividend, and a $20B market cap."
"Not many companies can boast about earnings like these! Look at these numbers!COUPA SOFTWARE (COUP) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of 366.67% and 7.87%, respectively, for the quarter ended October 2018."
"COUP is a great company with great potentials, but has been greatly undervalued.Give it sometime, it will come back to make a new high."
Full year Revenue was $427M .. compare with $COUP - $390M.. and $COUP trades at 14B valuation while this one is at 7B valuation.. lol.. this is way undervalued.. i will short COUP and long ESTC.
"They always play this shenanigan on options expiration days to make the call options expire worthless by 4 PM: KeyBanc Adjusts Coupa Software's Price Target to $300 From $350, Maintains Overweight RatingMorgan Stanley Adjusts Coupa Software's Price Target to $345 From $381, Maintains Overweight Rating"
"Best thing that could happen is for this to try $310 again, fail and move down the rest of the day. This would setup tomorrow and next week and maybe the rest of the month to trend down towards $240-250."
"Per IBD this is heavily shorted stock... 9.9 millions as of June 30, 2020. Two things can happen short squeeze or huge $30-40 price drop... let us see what happens?"

"(COUP) all pumping is done, who is going to hold the bag? Bam, Bam, Boom."

"Morgan Stanley has a 12 month price target on COUP of $146. It seems that this is a short covering move in pre market. There are lesser known analysts than Stan Ziotsky at Morgan Stanely who have higher price targets, but I've always trusted MS and GS more often. If the pattern post earnings holds, COUP will more than likely be faded from this level after the market opens and in the days that follow, like other software companies did who also had a good quarter: (WDAY, OKTA, PLAN, etc.)."
"Revenue $125.5M (Beat street estimate by $8M)EPS 21 cents (Analysts were expecting 0.8 cents)Raised the outlook for the rest of the year. Expecting profit of 43 to 45 cents, and revenue if $496 - $498MWhat more do investors want?"
• Coupa Software (NASDAQ:COUP) drops 6.1% after yesterday's announcement that Workday will acquire Scout RFP for $540M.• Morgan Stanley says the purchase intensifies the competitive landscape for Coupa
Even coupa's competitors say that coupa has the best product in the market. Onward and upward.
"One of the challenges of being a COUP shareholder is the minimal coverage and news. Whereas other cloud stocks seem to have press releases almost weekly if not daily, we're lucky to get a handful per quarter with COUP"
"Coupa Software CEO on Q3 success Cloud player Coupa Software 's business is firing on all cylinders as more enterprises become aware of its money-saving technologies, the company's Chairman and CEO, Robert Bernshteyn, told Cramer in a Tuesday interview.

In addition to its new customer acquisitions, which include the high-profile United Airlines , Coupa has also begun leveraging artificial intelligence to better serve its corporate clients, the CEO said. ""Enterprise software hasn't ever been able to bring this much community intelligence to bear for helping individual customers make decisions"" by using A.I., Bernshteyn told Cramer."
Still 298 after earnings?
Over bought
"Difficult to read Nasdaq. It seems like sky is the limit for it to go up. So scary to put new money, but at the same time you don’t want to lose opportunity."
"Not a good ER imo, revenue growth is practically nil from this qtr ($74.9m) to next qtr ($74m) and also less eps loss compare to this qtr.For a Growth company with such high valuation is not worth paying a premium. I think between $80-$85 is a good entry point."
"With Convertible their market cap is now approaching $30B.Total market for procument is $6.5B for 2020 and even 2025 it expected $9.5BHow market justify such valuation? Why not a single person worry about such fancy buying in this market.Sure it bring excitement in investor but if it can't sustain, it end with disaster such bad that all those investor shut for rest of life normally."
"If anyone really concerns about investing in this market,?just look at the greed of wall street and (COUP),when the share price goes down about 20% with no news it is total market manipulation, Bam, Bam, Booyah"
"We have a BUNCH of Analysts weighing in this morning and a majority of them are bullish and raising PT's. That could be a factor in why this is acting very perky. But as an experienced trader I never panic trade and am willing to stay the course and take a loss later on today if need be, but not right now..."
How is Coupe Software $301. It has been operating at a loss for the last 5 years and trading better than Microsoft. Someone explain this to me.
"So in real world, Coupa type software make sense so you have tighter control on employee spending.Now if that cost you $1K+/year on each employee you trying to make sure they don't misuse, you doing two very bad thing. First you hardly saving any money. Second because tiny thing need to run though approval, Employee feel like they don't have any decision making which impact their morale.Analyst might think this market can grow much faster. I seriously not seeing it.My company is fortune 50 list, THey have software where I submit request. Now I hardly ever spend $100/year on anything. If they spending $1K/user they basically should instead give me that $1000 to spend what ever I like within limit without require any approval and yet they come on top."
"The problem with shorts is that they let many tech companies with peanut revenue have astronomical valuation, but they couldn't see GME trade under 10 and were pushing it down! Now you have it. If you are really brave shorts, then go short $SNOW, $DASH, $COUP, $TSLA $CMG etc."
Q3 results out today?
It's crazy that COUP has ever gotten its SP this high... investors are going to lose well over 50% over the next three years!
Up on a major down day..Bought some more this AM
"cant believe anyone in their right mind will take the risk of shorting these hot cloud companies. Their TAM is expanding, and any acquisition offer by one of the biggies - msft, amzn, gooogl, orcl or sap will just wipe the shortie out."
Anyone here BE HONEST pay $298 in after hours last night? It was just $205 recently.
"my 4 stocks this year i have made the most money are veev,twlo and msft, and coup. i was going to sell my position in coup to add to my veev the other day. i didnt do that and it cost me, as veev went up 20. the only thing that will change how i feel about that is tomorrow after close if coup has great earnings as goes up at least 10 points. yea i know, its tough but it could happen."
"Now we are at 27 price to sales. Considering other companies with high valuations, COUP is now at a better price than before today. I'm a buyer here as I think it will come back with the ER upcoming. It's never been for faint of heart and has proven to be quite volatile. However, it's products are an important cog in the wheel for many many companies."
Boom!!! Sold half my position now. Congrats to all the other longs!
