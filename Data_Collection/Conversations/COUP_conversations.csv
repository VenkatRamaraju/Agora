"Walmart PR - $30-40 jumpCasey PR - $10-20 jumpAt this rate if COUP just publish 1 PR per month, it can be $10K in no time"
"Why is Coupa up so much more than it's peers? It is really much higher, and they all have nice gains so far for the day. What would cause a company with no earnings to run faster than the others in such a big way?"
"I shorted 250 call yesterday just for profit. Didn't look deeper in Notes. Today I was looking more to understand what really going as I thought it should drop.What I found is very fishy transaction that favor overwhelmingly those convertible holder.Here is detail.1.> they using 167.7M to repurchase $33M worth of facevalue issued just 2 year ago. (Basically taking 133M in loss)2.> they going to retire $55M additiona based on average price after offering which is reason it higher, Those convertible holder is covering their short and controling price so they can get higher price for their offer. I expect 245+ price. 3.> Now if price crash while they don't have short is risk, but here is yet another free lunch. 281.9M additional will used to purchase more of those convertible.In short company issue $1.38B worth of debt with convertible at $196 and Spend nearly $750M retired Old Convertible <$150M total debt. Company hardly relevant in real world so why take $600M loss specially at time where global economy going down by 6% and worst recession ever.Just amazing how such fishy deal continue happen so openly and no one even question it."
what's going on with $COUP pumped 12% and now dumped to 6.5% within couple of mins
How low can this go?

"Short now making fun of longs just longs were doing for short just this morning.Retail long and Retail short is only reason this market still somewhat real. Those so called expert use our trading data and manipulate in direction easiest or desired by multi billionaire crooks where support is. Reality is We all getting played by big boys. So it's not subject to make fun. Many who thought they are next millionaire, their dream scattered and it's not thing to joy. I reach my first million fighting this market and it took 12 year even I make very good money both in job and average on market (After having devasting 4 first year where I lose all most all my saving). It's long road and many different experience.I never thought short just 200 Tesla at $1100 and adding 2 more short call at $1400 will cause so much damage to my account but it did so. Never thought $SHOP can go $1000+, $QQQ go so much out of sync with $SPY, $COUP can go $300, $AMZN to $3300.Everything combined, My stock account move $100K+ today from morning to Evening. And I just don't know how it will tommorow. I am at mercy of those big boys as long as they can manipulate majority of people here.This will continue as long as we play their game. If everyone start doing what make sense and not listen to those, We always have fair market and you can invest any time and enter reasonable market.Not very oversold /Not very over brought. I don't think it ever possible but just for thought."
This is insane. It went from being up 13% to beingup 4%. At this rate it may actually go negative
I SOLD ALL AT 90.30 $ TODAY ...UP 40 % SINCE MY BUY EARLY DECEMBER ...TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE ...WILL BE BACK WHEN IT COMES DOWN ...WISHING THE BEST TO THE RIDERS TO $ 100I see too many analysts calling a return to S and P 2500 ...
A $60-$70 stock trading at $290. Short and hold
Its hard to justify these multiples... Also have to remember they acquired a company to get here

Not Selling ... obviously going to to back up.
Good Options play.
"Hopefully this is consolidation until the next leg up. I feel their software is exactly what every business would want, to SAVE money!"
They've shown zero margin expansion and ever-growing GAAP losses. Why would anyone buy this stock? #short
"Coupa Software CEO on Q3 success Cloud player Coupa Software 's business is firing on all cylinders as more enterprises become aware of its money-saving technologies, the company's Chairman and CEO, Robert Bernshteyn, told Cramer in a Tuesday interview. ""We're seeing gross margin expansion, we're seeing subscription margin expansion, we're seeing scale to the business, and we're now managing nearly $1 trillion of spending and management for companies around the world,"" the CEO said after his company reported third-quarter earnings. In addition to its new customer acquisitions, which include the high-profile United Airlines , Coupa has also begun leveraging artificial intelligence to better serve its corporate clients, the CEO said. ""Enterprise software hasn't ever been able to bring this much community intelligence to bear for helping individual customers make decisions"" by using A.I., Bernshteyn told Cramer."
"Another look at what Churchill Swartz & Associate can manipulate any stock that's listed for trading, All you have to do is look at (COUP) they pumped it up to over $280.00 only to sell off as usual just before the option expires, Bam, the amount of $$$$ they take from investors is unreal,Booyah."
Not to mention each time you purchase it it goes down several dollars until you sell than coincidentally runs right back up. As if it's being manipulated and only a selected few are allowed to benefit. Tested this several times on purpose and the same thing happened each time. Someone should seriously look into the trading of this stock.
"After such a terrible analyst day presentation, I'm starting to think that Coupa's mgt team is amateurish and not up to the task at this stage of the company's growth."
Mere $179mm rev. Not sure why this is popping
This stock should be 120. Since it was 90ish no news has came out to justify the huge jump.
"Morgan Stanley has a 12 month price target on COUP of $146. It seems that this is a short covering move in pre market. There are lesser known analysts than Stan Ziotsky at Morgan Stanely who have higher price targets, but I've always trusted MS and GS more often. If the pattern post earnings holds, COUP will more than likely be faded from this level after the market opens and in the days that follow, like other software companies did who also had a good quarter: (WDAY, OKTA, PLAN, etc.)."

this is a rocket!!!!! they are printing money and hedge funds love it! stay long....
"SFIX and CASY would also have been very good Pure Earnings Short Sell plays for today. Both are down in the AH session in direct response to disappointing ER's. I think right now, for the next 2-3 months, there are some excellent opportunities to make $ on Pure Earnings Short Sells because the market as a whole is trading too high, a recession has just begun, there is huge uncertainty going forward, and for the next few months ALL ER's, in terms of numbers, should reflect the economic weakness caused by the Pandemic."
"Here we go, exactly as I anticipated, collapse in stock price even though the ER numbers look fairly decent at first glance... Why?? Overvalued, GROSSLY!"
$298 last night or $250 now? Which one? COUP R.I.P.
Up $100 or 50% since an analyst downgraded COUP LOL 
"Covered my COUP Short Sell at $222.91 average price, for a modest loss of just over $1.4k. Time to move on to better things! Good Luck to All."
call me skeptic but Csco cried out about things were worse mid to small businesses. That is the main customer segment for COUP. Will see how much of Csco warning turns out to be true for Coup.
A good conference should tilt us obn the green side

The other cloud stocks are up only 0.5%. This one is 5% up. Confusing - buy or short. Its revenue and profit doesn’t align with the stock price.
Just Shorted again 200 @$277.33. Will Short another 200 if it goes higher past $279+
"it's about time to build a short position in this stock. Tech has rallied alot this week. Any weakness in NASDAQ , this stock will fall 2-3x times"
Consolidated let’s pop
Very strong growth stock. I think we have bottomed out here. Short squeeze coming. IMHO
They have pumped this stock enough via positive PR. My guess is a secondary is coming. Look at their balance sheet and spend on acquisitions — they need more cash to continue their habit
"my 4 stocks this year i have made the most money are veev,twlo and msft, and coup. i was going to sell my position in coup to add to my veev the other day. i didnt do that and it cost me, as veev went up 20. the only thing that will change how i feel about that is tomorrow after close if coup has great earnings as goes up at least 10 points. yea i know, its tough but it could happen."
"Revenue $125.5M (Beat street estimate by $8M)EPS 21 cents (Analysts were expecting 0.8 cents)Raised the outlook for the rest of the year. Expecting profit of 43 to 45 cents, and revenue if $496 - $498MWhat more do investors want?"
"Wow what a reaction. WalMart didn't acquire COUP, they're giving them more business. WalMart is already a client, and there's no indication at all how much more revenue this would be."
"Best thing that could happen is for this to try $310 again, fail and move down the rest of the day. This would setup tomorrow and next week and maybe the rest of the month to trend down towards $240-250."
Hilarious overreaction. Just bought some call options for Dec 21st. This baby will bounce back nicely. See you all in Maui!
"All Convertible holder without Hedge, I think this is start of end. Even great earning investor now start finding weak point and focusing.We talking stock at 40-50 time revenue specially when we seen growth in past 3 month but next 3 month we may see nothing."
"Anyone like COUP $240 here pre market? Down from $360. Man when these stocks fall, they fall fast. Down 33% with no bottom in sight."
"Not a good ER imo, revenue growth is practically nil from this qtr ($74.9m) to next qtr ($74m) and also less eps loss compare to this qtr.For a Growth company with such high valuation is not worth paying a premium. I think between $80-$85 is a good entry point."
Evercore increased PT to $340 today - this is the third analyst with over $300 PT
"You people didn’t think a $35 gain after hours would hold, really??That’s too big a move in a couple hours"
Is COUP on track with its earnings report? Or it is time to bail out?
I see a tertiary offering coming. Coupa is clearly overvalued. The last acquisition was done with cash not stock. The company being acquired probably refused a stock based acquisition for fear of sudden loss of value. So Coupa will need to beef up its coffers again. At this valuation -- I think it makes sense to sell some stock again. maybe 7 million at 100 will net them approx 650 million after fees. They can use it for future acquisitions.
"Coup stock jump almost 20% in 2 back to back day. This is how clear insider trading working.Friday End it was one of weakest in high flyer list, make me long in stock and very nurvous I sold cover 365 calls for small premium.Monday it was going higher and I can't figure out why so I sold stock and make those calls naked. Make profit on stock as I got them at 355 net price (When remove premium I got from Puts and naked call)But then walmart agreement which may worth may be $1M /year. Sure Walmart recognization is big deal but is it worth 20% of already very very high valuation. No.Only reason it happen because there are people with insider knowledge load up and load even more after news which basically make other to buy (Herd mentality) or cover short ( Loss getting out of control)"
beats on both and higher guidance . Congrats longs
"The problem with shorts is that they let many tech companies with peanut revenue have astronomical valuation, but they couldn't see GME trade under 10 and were pushing it down! Now you have it. If you are really brave shorts, then go short $SNOW, $DASH, $COUP, $TSLA $CMG etc."
"Looking to Cover my COUP Short at $200.00 here in the AH session. If no fill I will stay Short for tomorrow. The key lesson here is: Play the valuation on Earnings. A Grossly overvalued stock is likely to go down a LOT on a bad ER, but STILL go down, only less so, on a decent ER. Play the odds, risk/reward ratio, and you can be a successful trader with 75% winners. My odds on this one were 75-80%, so I went with the play!"
Up on a major down day..Bought some more this AM
is this something sellers on shopify would use? sorry for the question. i just found this stock and am trying to figure out what they do. thanks in advance.
Anyone here BE HONEST pay $298 in after hours last night? It was just $205 recently.
Down 7 days in a row. Brutal. Hopefully next week we will turn around.
COUP is down 5.96% to 236.00
"Now we are at 27 price to sales. Considering other companies with high valuations, COUP is now at a better price than before today. I'm a buyer here as I think it will come back with the ER upcoming. It's never been for faint of heart and has proven to be quite volatile. However, it's products are an important cog in the wheel for many many companies."
"Seems the moment I exit, the tide turn around. If this closes below 306, that would be a major reversal as it will be more than 2% down day on the close basis that hasn't happened in months"
How is Coupe Software $301. It has been operating at a loss for the last 5 years and trading better than Microsoft. Someone explain this to me.
"horrible. COUP almost hit $300 and then drops back to $255 after stellar earnings. Fortunately, I sold half my position at $298 but this is just sad."
Just Covered my $277 Short..... will be back another day
"I might have hit the bull's eye this morning when I said that (COUP) will be under $260.00 by Friday, July 16th,2021, I think I saw too many rats on wall street and getting a little clue how they operate, Bam, Bam,Boom."
Price target $370
Low volume sure does make stocks behave in a strange manner. I still feel very confident with low 200’s in near term. Not enough volume and way too high of a price for the stock
This stock has got to be over bought at this level. Need a pull back to 70 to re-enter. Sold majority at 90. Nice profit for Jan.
Think I may sell some shares today. WSJ article on businesses trimming IT budgets. This could have a negative impact on Coupahttps://www.wsj.com/articles/corporate-tech-in-line-for-its-pandemic-haircut-11594319207?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=8
More competition for coupa. Competition will only add to margin pressurehttps://spendmatters.com/2019/01/17/certify-a-te-veteran-launches-a-procure-to-pay-solution/
"Stunning numbers! Down, but it won't be down in 12 months!"
I think Coupa is a great acquisition target within the next 6-12 months. Lots of money to be made on this great company and business model.
"I close my long put and keep my short put in hope for premium.Just amazing, Analyst upgrade and increase price target and yet stock keep going down. When those analyst do real work. I thought they going to inflate and they might inflate as well but right now stock go down (More than 30% from high) and there is no demand still just making me nervous."
Full year Revenue was $427M .. compare with $COUP - $390M.. and $COUP trades at 14B valuation while this one is at 7B valuation.. lol.. this is way undervalued.. i will short COUP and long ESTC.
Congrats. Longs

"Hard to believe this isn't higher, only 44X trailing twelve month sales."
"Great company with good product and strong momentum. Might retest the all time highs in the next few months. At some point the bigger players are ought to buy COUPA, Alterix, Blackline before they get much bigger!"
"COUP is a great company with great potentials, but has been greatly undervalued.Give it sometime, it will come back to make a new high."
"The earnings were good  BUT look at the revenues, net and market cap, I can’t imagine this staying +$16"
"(COUP) is like a tub of ice cream left in the heat, What happens?"
"Sold it today at $66.25 (bought it at $58), took the profit off the table. Will get back in again if it dips to $61-$62 range."
Now's the time to buy before earnings gets close and the piece runs up!
"Momentum is not a strategy. This is gambling. There is absolutely no fundamental reason why COUP is up this much. Several analysts are on the sidelines for good reasons, and so am I. From $130 to $236 since April 1st, with an RSI over 73, which is comical. All the software stocks are overvalued, but COUP even more so. I may go short over $236."
"Uuuge beat...my a $ $.This is a Growth company valued at Price to Revenue (price to earnings). To maintain that valuation, the revenue growth rate should increase or atleast not decrease. But, alas, it is losing its MOJO despite multiple acquisitions:FISCAL 2021 rev growth = 47%FISCAL 2020 projected rev growth = ~25-27%"
when they post earnings in 2 weeks....it will break all time highs

"This stock should take a beating tomorrow. Although MSFT overall cloud revenue was up, the b2b or close competitor to COUP was down. That as well as the insider trading should make for a pullback tomorrow"
There is no way of this high valuation. It needs to have revenue of a billion to have 20B valuation. Right now it is way too high valuation.
This is the best earnings I’ve personally ever seen. The beat expectations by so much. Probably 120 tomorrow
CONGRATS LONGS !
"Sold half my position, over valued stock"
"Here is how much overvalued this company is. Sap Ariba has better overall rating and majority market share, most vendors on platform and lot more.But if you think they can gain market share and Market full potential $10B/year at peak faster at 2025 ( It's $5B) And they get 30% market share = $3B/year revenue in 2025, current market cap still way too high.Current market cap :- $20B + $3B convertible market cap + $2B stock grant ( $330M+/year worth in RSU/ year) = $25B market cap.at $3B it trading 40+ time revenue currently and even peak sale it will have hard time justify such valuation."
"I've been spot on with COUP. Like I said 2 weeks ago, heading to $300+! It's already back to almost $250. Looking forward to $300+ by next earnings!!!"
"The posts on the COUP board are a microcosm of what is problematic with today's stock market. The markets are grossly overbought and overvalued. COUP went all the way up to $298 in after hours earlier. And yet, you read posts from those long the stock complaining that they couldn't find any news to make it go ""down."" The greed is unbelievable. Why didn't you all take your profit at $297-$298 when you had it earlier? Wait, let me guess. You thought it would fly over $300. Now it's trading at $275, still an amazing profit from the $210 where it was 2 weeks ago."
"This stock is up about $33 in 3 days this week for no reason. It's up 100% since April 1st, about $130. And it has a $17B market cap with $427M in revenue, and they're losing money. The Fed has created the biggest liquidity bubble in history, and you have momentum traders chasing companies that don't come close to supporting their valuation. As they say, this will end badly."
"PRG is 2+ when you include convertible debt.Growth isn't going higher like most analyst thought given on paper it help save money. While analyst trying to bail out big and powerful don't listen them. They will keep talking that better day coming but their past performance is mediocre and They have about same product that 2000 bubble hot star Ariba, ITWO, Commerce One and other have. Difference is those company growing revenue at 100% rate but this one 30%. Other than that valuation and everything is same.I was investor and burn badly in 2000 in all 3 name I put because those 100% growth suddenly go negative with little to no warning. Enterprise spending is not very predicitive specially when it claim that it actually save money. Being in IT industry i know every company make theoritical case on how it can save so much money but in reality those benefit never materialized.I would invest in software company who can help get more business than one who save money."
"Unusual Put Volume in Coupa. Hope they are right and sucker drops next week....From Nasdaq Site: Coupa Software Inc (Symbol: COUP) saw options trading volume of 10,003 contracts, representing approximately 1.0 million underlying shares or approximately 43.3% of COUP's average daily trading volume over the past month, of 2.3 million shares. Particularly high volume was seen for the $230 strike put option expiring July 02, 2020, with 1,034 contracts trading so far today, representing approximately 103,400 underlying shares of COUP."
Still 298 after earnings?
"The Barrons article yesterday about a software bubble is a great excuse for program selling to wash out weak hands. COUP, OKTA, AYX, etc., are all being crushed for today. Their growth rate will have them back up in a short while. Hang on if you have them and watch for buying opportunity if you've been waiting."
"Coupa software is a Nasdaq stock that's losing money, with a $20B market cap. I don't know how anyone can justify paying these prices for a stock with about $400m in revenue, no earnings, no dividend, and a $20B market cap."
They had a 60% increase from last years first quarter. Amazing Probably see 115-120 tomorrow https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coupa-software-reports-financial-results-200500770.html
"I hope they pump this to 500 again. Perfect time to sell my entire portiflio and just short $TSLA and $ZM.Both are way over extended (Other are $SHOP , $W, $COUP but they lately not going higher high and not worst risk shorting at middle - big boy sure do that but they have lot more data analysis to figure out exact reason for stall price and connection with big boy bulls club to find out what they actually planning/doing )"
"In case any of u shorts wanna chime in with your BS again, $COUP is growing exponentially. Just check out their career page. https://jobs.lever.co/coupa/"
Going down to $80-90. No growth at all. Will crash before next earnings.
Gonna crash overvalued by 50%
I shorted at 264 before the close then at 284 and at 298 after the closeThank God the damage has been contained
About time!
"Happily staying Short with COUP. Economic news looks bad, futures are down pointing to a weak open, and with the CC over, there is nothing I see that should give COUP an upside pop today. Bargain hunters coming in at $210 today?? Very unlikely. Maybe at $200 or less, later in the day. I continue to see a very good risk/reward scenario for staying Short on COUP and trying to ride her further down today."
80% rise in a stock price in a month will simply not be sustainable!!
I hold a decent amount of $COUP. I hope it goes up after earnings but it's consistently gone down after earnings. Fingers crossed but be prepared for the potential drop.
Shld have sold after hour
People sold on whatever news came out
"Great company and business model, however I feel it is way overvalued at these prices. Pull back coming soon."
Trades at to high a multiple to sales.
"This move will be faded. There's been no base formed, no backing and filling, just a parabolic move. I'm expecting a sell on the news event. No, I'm not short COUP, I'd consider going long after the dust settles."
If you bought last night in after hours you are down 20% good trading stock not a long term buy & hold
Right after I buy brilliant
COUP is heading to $270
"If its doing so well, why is the stock falling consistently? Maybe buy the dip? What do you guys think?"
"They always play this shenanigan on options expiration days to make the call options expire worthless by 4 PM: KeyBanc Adjusts Coupa Software's Price Target to $300 From $350, Maintains Overweight RatingMorgan Stanley Adjusts Coupa Software's Price Target to $345 From $381, Maintains Overweight Rating"
10% pop to $80...LAST CHANCE TO ABOARD THIS TRAIN!!!!
COUP $298 up $35 still like it was in after hours when earnings were announced?
MISS ON GUIDANCE. NEXT QUARTER NON GAAP earnings is much lower than estimates. THey are buying highly unprofitable revenue with their acquisitions.
"Pure Earnings Short Seller- I like your thought process, do you play with options? Have you considered selling covered puts to take advantage of elevated volatility and also a mechanism to hedge your short?"
"Can someone tell me why Coupa would benefit from COVID ? It seems to me that less people are doing business expensing so that should reduce. This is further exarcebated by remote work and increasing unemployement. Also, even if people go back to normal, its going to be less expensing that it used to be... It definitely doesnt deserve to be all time high and 23% above the pre covid all time high???"
No volume. Dead stock.

"Folks -- I did some analysis on Q2 and Q3 reports -- Here is my take on it . looks like growth has flattened. Essentially no billings growth while stock price is at 23 times sales currently. Comments welcome from all longs and shorts.Q2Deferred Revenues 127809Q2 Subscription Revenues = 55374q1 Deferred Revenues 120458Increase in differed revenues = 7351Subscription billings = subscription revenue + deferred revenues increase = 62725Q3Deferred REvenues = 128683Q3 Subscripion revenues = 60,559Q2 Deferred Revenues 127809Increase in differed revenues = 874 Q3 subscription billings = subscription revenue + deferred revenues increase = 61433So there was no growth in billings from Q2 to Q3 and thats why they are predicting relatively flat Q4they may beat it but the growth is goneAlso look at the expected share count for Q4 = 65 million.2019 revenue per share = 260/65 = 4Price to sales = 92/4 = 23You go figure out if this is worth 23 times sales with flat revenue growth Q2 to Q3"
"When you beat earnings as huge as we just did we should be looking at new 52 week highs next. Look at these numbers!COUPA SOFTWARE (COUP) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of 366.67% and 7.87%, respectively, for the quarter ended October 2018."
wow congratz
It's crazy that COUP has ever gotten its SP this high... investors are going to lose well over 50% over the next three years!
Even coupa's competitors say that coupa has the best product in the market. Onward and upward.
Lack of transparency on organic growth vs inorganic growth ( through acquisitions ) is an issue . They have acquired a bunch of companies —- diluted stock paid huge cash and are showing growth. Some organic growth yes but the lack of transparency is an issue. Overall this growth doesn’t justify the multiple

There is no reason for the big boys to buy this lame stock. No catalyst and It will be meandering around the 52 week low level until the earnings next month then takes 10+% dive because of the usual conservative guidance. You heard it here first!
buying time. volume is high and it acting good. i am buying.
"Bought some today. I have been in and out of COUP since its IPO last year and have made good profit. It is a long term hold , should be around $100 next year."
I really do not understand the valuations on companies like these anymore. 30X or more of sales...not earnings. Reality check there are no earnings.

Coupa Software 2Q Loss Widens on Higher Expenses
based on company's press release - it is a 'meh' quarter at best. Will listen to call later. but lot of speculative calls were bought so it could levitate for couple of days or 1-2 week.
"Investors, check out the CNBC ""Mad Money"" T.V. segment (approx. 6 minutes) on December 4, 2018with Coupa Software CEO and Chairman Rob Bernstein. It is a must-watch interview andnaturally very bullish on company and its future prospects. (Go to CNBC website and just put in symbol in the upper right hand ""Search quotes, news, & video"" box.) COUPA is identified as ""the Salesforce (CRM) of expense management."" Cramer has beencorrectly bullish on cloud software companies for some time and this company is one of them."
"Got recommended by a very popular outfit today, hence the spike."
"Up almost an additional 1X TTM sales today! The sky is the limit on this one, doubt it will ever go down."
Buying opportunity
"Sold today $91, bought at $78. will buy again next dip(hopefully)"
Why isn't Coupa working with the Government or Project n95 to get protective gear and ventilators to our hospitals? Step up!
Can you buy or see options in after hours?
"Watching LULU as a potentially interesting Pure Earnings play for Thursday. They report AH on Thursday. What I want to see is a run-up in price over the next 3 days, leading up to the release. I want a 10%+ upside move BEFORE Thursday afternoon. If that happens, and it might because LULU has a ""cult following"" that is prone to irrational exuberance, I think LULU could be a very attractive Short Sell just before market close on Thursday. But ONLY if it goes up significantly from current price. Smart Earnings traders plan ahead like this, and are also open to trying to ride up the wave of Irrational Exuberance by going Long as a Pre-earnings play, meaning Long LULU but ONLY as a day/momentum trade and NOT to hold through the ER."
All down but coup is up. Seems odd
"Looking at 1 minute chart, algorithm playing"
So Tmrow this will be around $282 then $300+ next wk. then $500 in July. Then a tiny drop then $750 by September.....
Prob gonna see 220 or lower after earnings
think we can shoot up 10% this week. In this market I think it only takes belief.
"After close to 600,000 shares trading fake hands the stock close unchanged, the joke of the day fr.om your bobbleheads of wall street, Booyah"
"New here , bought end of the day ...After reading a lot and hopefull that we embark on a year end rally for good . This one can fetch back $80"
"We have a BUNCH of Analysts weighing in this morning and a majority of them are bullish and raising PT's. That could be a factor in why this is acting very perky. But as an experienced trader I never panic trade and am willing to stay the course and take a loss later on today if need be, but not right now..."
"One of the challenges of being a COUP shareholder is the minimal coverage and news. Whereas other cloud stocks seem to have press releases almost weekly if not daily, we're lucky to get a handful per quarter with COUP"
"Nasdaq is up, but all cloud stocks are sown, including COUP. Is there any rotation going on? Any insight?"
Q3 results out today?
COUP down $10 up $15 so net gain +$5 on huge blowout earnings
"Textbook Silicon Valley VC pump and dump. Man, someone write a case history on this in 12 months."
Is COUP still $298? Not near a pc or cellular device to see quotes.
"In a note this morning, JP Morgan raised their 12 month price target on COUP from $125 to $130. Not a typo. Others average higher, around $275."
COUP is up 5.01% to 238.49
"The way some of these stocks are going up -$6 to $8 every day, and no valuation math is working for these stocks, the question is if these stocks would ever stop not going up like TSLA. When the current valuation is already so high and everyone still has so much courage to pay more everyday, why the stock would ever stop not going up? If people are ready to pay $290, why wouldn’t they be ready to pay $330 and then $400. Good thoughtful answer will help if risk to buy at this price can be taken or not."
Someone sold 298 after hours; genius trade COUP
"I love COUP since $122, down from $150......BUT this move from $240 to $316 is stretched, to say the least, considering Wal-Mart was always a customer."
A lot of forces at play here bigger than Coupa People are concerned about interest rates and inflation affecting profitability of all companies
Hold or sell
"Did Coupa Software discover a cure for cancer? Do they have a vaccine for Covid-19? Nope. But it does have an RSI of 76. Since April 1, the stock has risen from $120 to $272. That's in less than 3 months. Apparently valuations don't matter."
"There was no news from the conference call that would have made it fall, thats just shorts, who are getting killed, trying to cause a panic and get some money back. COUP will be over $300 tomorrow. Analysts will be falling all over themselves raising price targets."
I just bought a little more.
COUP is not reacting to Nasdaq today. Any thoughts?
"cant believe anyone in their right mind will take the risk of shorting these hot cloud companies. Their TAM is expanding, and any acquisition offer by one of the biggies - msft, amzn, gooogl, orcl or sap will just wipe the shortie out."
"$MAXR Almost $2B in revenue market cap $1B. $COUP,$SHOP,$TWLO and $BYND"
"If anyone really concerns about investing in this market,?just look at the greed of wall street and (COUP),when the share price goes down about 20% with no news it is total market manipulation, Bam, Bam, Booyah"
Why is COUP up today? Has something to do with CRM?
"Got this stock for a while now, wondering when will MF recommend it. Finally we got that reco today. GO COUP!"
"This doesn’t deserve 275 dollars price tag. Just 450M of revenue and 18B market valuation. This is too much of valuation for 30% growth. Based on P/S 10, stock price should be around 100 dollars."
News is out short it
If the DOW ends the day under 26000 kiss the three COUP digits good bye !See you at $85...
"This stock is truly out of control. Trading at over 50x sales. It's not even growing that much. It's a nice little concept, but there is a lot of competition in this space also. This reminds me of YELP a few years back, they drove that up to $130 or something and today it sits at $23. This will at some point have the same type of move, just have to play far, far out puts to make a substantial amount of money."
"My COUP target is $160 by year end. Main rationale: COUP deserves the same valuation as cloud peers WDAY and NOW. This strategy is expanded in the youtube video ""cloud and saas investing strategy"" by legacy coder"
COUP will do well in April after the massive overselling in March. Looks like it's already starting before the month starts. =D
i was watching cramer...he loves the stock but said buy on the dip today. looks like its going up into earnings. company is still on profitable but in the same boat with CRM and workday. so im going to stick with it.
yaaaaa. from 210 to 256 in less than a month. this is heading to 230s by end of week. earnings wasnt strong enough to propel higher
Lock in your profits if you bought! there will be a pull back to 140-144 before it goes up more
what's going on with this today?
It’s about time love  it . Nice 
"Tomorrow (or maybe even today) we'll see ya all back over $230, maybe closer to $235. COUP had a great report and guidance, in spite of the fair weather analysts lowering price targets. They'll raise the targets again when the stock goes back up, typical of fair weather analysts."
"Seems like as more positive news is flowing in, traders are building the confidence to start moving some money to more cheaper stocks and for them COUP seems expensive. More cheaper options are opening up and money may start to move out from the expensive stocks. It seems like COUP may trade side ways for short term."
"Look at the company worth $17 billion with only $1.49 billion debt with $1.34 billion cash, this should make any investor very comfortable"
just got an upgrade to 400$
Nice beat and raise!
My account on Coupa has been frozen for several weeks. Connected with support 4 straight days. No resolution in sight. Customer support horrible. This should be a huge short as pandemic eases.
Comming $210.00 within 2 weeks.
tomorrow 25% up
Long way back to over $350 if ever.
Can someone explain to me why people are selling shares at a loss after a report like that? Is it just in fear that the stock will drop even more tomorrow ?
"Well let's see, valuation is up someStock is trading at 52 week highs, 99 to 367Stock basically tracks the 50 SMA. Since March correction from what looks like an Elliot Wave 1 up and a sideways correction wave 2 with floor at 245. Since March there has been a 169% valuation in 9 months from low of 128 to 344 share price. Sideways movement in wave 2 has been some 3 correction back to 50 SMA. 9-1 to 9/17 +13.4% to -17.3%, 10/13 to 11/2 +8.7% to -13.6% and 11/27 to 12/9 +12.3% to +3%. Currently resides at +20% from 12/9 price of 307Morningstar report suggest FMV 249 (was) 147.BofA identifies as a C-1-9, BUY on 12/7/20 which coincided with the correction to 50 SMA at that time when price was 325.How about this?Sell a put at 325 which assumes a 11% correction at around 6.6% over the 50 SMA to hit strike price. This would be a 32,500 commitment to buy. Upside potential is to hit the 12 month 400 BofA estimate representing a valuation of 23% or $7500.00. The after market is showing a 1.4% move up so the put will be moving away from asking price of $5.00 per contract. Conservatively, $498.7 (1.5% share price) into account at #$%$ Potential U/R loss if stock price returns to the floor of 250 of -$7500. See what happens on Monday 12/21/20.Neutral due to over extension of 50 SMA"
And it goes up LOL
"People here keep talking about how much Short loss money. They just don't know entire rally started by very powerful and inteligant Group who normally Short Stock always.Group is Convertible Bond Holders. Reason Convertible bonds has almost 0% interest because they always use hedge to stock.Tesla convertible bond holders with very large amount already issues ( Market Cap $40B+) would normally hedge using Short.Now in this new world where SEC is completely sleeping, DOJ does not go after white Crime, Our President take price of over inflated stock market, Fed don't care about Asset price bubble, They come up with new Kind of hedge. Get Analyst, Media, CEO (Who in past always worry about stock price go way over extended and comment about stock price, now does not use same tone when reference) Index management (S&P 500) Big boys who ready to buy worthless EV credit paying $1B. So inflate stock and go without hedge.They not just doing it in Tesla, They also doing in many other convertible note issued tech. (Another one I am short is $COUP which even worst because analyst keep upgrading price target even when earning hardly growing 25% for stock trading at more than 50 time revenue (When include options and convertible) Tesla atleast have fan club who think Elon is super genius & don't think any price is too much."
"So in real world, Coupa type software make sense so you have tighter control on employee spending.Now if that cost you $1K+/year on each employee you trying to make sure they don't misuse, you doing two very bad thing. First you hardly saving any money. Second because tiny thing need to run though approval, Employee feel like they don't have any decision making which impact their morale.Analyst might think this market can grow much faster. I seriously not seeing it.My company is fortune 50 list, THey have software where I submit request. Now I hardly ever spend $100/year on anything. If they spending $1K/user they basically should instead give me that $1000 to spend what ever I like within limit without require any approval and yet they come on top."
"With Convertible their market cap is now approaching $30B.Total market for procument is $6.5B for 2020 and even 2025 it expected $9.5BHow market justify such valuation? Why not a single person worry about such fancy buying in this market.Sure it bring excitement in investor but if it can't sustain, it end with disaster such bad that all those investor shut for rest of life normally."
"Difficult to read Nasdaq. It seems like sky is the limit for it to go up. So scary to put new money, but at the same time you don’t want to lose opportunity."
Beats all expectations.
Heading to $300+ after September earnings folks. You heard it here first! $COUP flatlining and ready to climb back up!!!
"Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 beats by $0.15; GAAP EPS of -$0.88 misses by $0.04.Revenue of $132.96M (+30.6% Y/Y) beats by $8.97M.For Q4, sees revenues of ~$145M- $146M vs. consensus of ~$129.4M, with adj. EPS loss of $0.11 to $0.13 per share"
"My first post here, so forgive me any inappropriate content. I sure need to understand the community a bit more than just on this board. But I thought I'd just post some of my thinking to get myself started:To understand Coupa and to get a better baseline for a comparison with their competitors, I'd suggest to have a look on their product vision and the aquisitions they've been successfully implementing into their core over the last couple of years. Because that's where they are getting the edge over the legacy corporations like Oracle, SAPAriba and the like.Take the ""sourcing"" part of their platform: Until few years ago, the majority of the other players in the market were running far ahead of Coupa, the RFx product has simply not been competitive for any large scale buying with even a medium complexity (components, cost-breakdowns, indirect materials, logistics). With the aquisition of Trade-Extensions, Coupa inherited a best-of-breed solution and catapulted themselves into the ""Leader"" quadrant of almost all analysts (Google sourcing optimization: You will find that NONE of the competitors can offer that except Jaggaer, who are challenged by their multi-solution offer). SAPAriba can offer a plugged-in solution by Keelvar (wich is an amazing product) but no legacy support, Ivalua is working hard on the pieces it requires, but has no roadmap to commit to... etc pp... Llamasoft would be an alternative, but is adressing a completely different market and doesn't come with any P2P: https://spendmatters.com/uk/coupa-acquires-trade-extensions-leading-sourcing-optimisation-software-provider/Travel (Competing with SAPConcour, not SAPAriba): Same story there: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coupa-gunning-sap-concur-share-210000439.htmlExternal workforce (Some overlap with Workday): https://spendmatters.com/2018/09/04/coupa-acquires-dcr-workforce-giving-its-services-maestro-a-full-symphony-orchestra/Contract management (another highlight of their most recent buys of what has been another best-of-breed): https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coupa-completes-acquisition-of-contract-lifecycle-management-leader-exari-300844792.htmlNow, you sure would be right in pointing out the complex challenge to integrate foreign code to your legacy platform - and THAT'S what make Coupa outstanding... Their success manifest in integration-timelines of a few month to make any of the new functionalities available to their existing costomers on their core platform. (Remember Emptoris /IBM anyone?)Coupa's last move came totally unexpected by acquiring ""Bellin"", a German treasury management company/product (with an amazing customer base of privately owned European / German market leaders): https://spendmatters.com/2020/06/12/coupa-acquires-bellin-to-add-treasury-management-and-boost-payments-capabilities/This is a serious indication that Coupa will not be limiting themselves competing for the attention of just CPOs anymore, with Bellin they become a serious interest of any CFO as much - and that's just confirming that they are addressing a market far beyond P2P or S2P... Now, if that is going to prove the market? Maybe not in the short term... it might take a while until every analyst realizes what they are about to create. But I am optimistic that one won't lose any money if it's invested with an horizon of just a few years.I bought in 2018 for 55.- and have 10 years to retirement... couldn't be more relaxed now. ;-)"
Report good?
"Market cap is 28x of sales, the most expensive software stock in the market"
why r insiders selling..anybody have any info
Boom!!! Sold half my position now. Congrats to all the other longs!
"COUP had a good ER but not great, Recent acquisitions has increased the operating cost and margins. The guidance was ok too but not gangbuster for a growth stock. In todays market any cloud based growth stock does not report earnings/guidance BEYOND the expectations is punished due to high Forward looking PE ratio. Investors are not willing to pay unless there is a spectacular growth. Let the dust settle and investors willCome back because it is a great company with outstanding growth prospects."
Ladies & Gentlemen welcome to a new 52 week low
COUPA is the Amazon of b2b spending
sold all my shares at pop..
"Not many companies can boast about earnings like these! Look at these numbers!COUPA SOFTWARE (COUP) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of 366.67% and 7.87%, respectively, for the quarter ended October 2018."
Agree. Check their corporate financial portal. COUP is going to meet the numbers next week
"This was a good earnings report. The problem is though the stock is up about 200% since January! So even though there was profit taking today, the stock has had a huge run and is up over 10% in after hours. I was thinking of going short before the earnings report and I'm glad I didn't, however going short now in AH may make sense."
A couple more of those genius well-presented analysts days like the one we just had and this thing will be in the 50s!
Shorted 1000 shares at 258.25
Anyone else is shorting before earnings?
"Seems like a lot of logistics companies are interested in reducing the supply chain cost and efficiently route the trucks/ships. This would impact the oil stocks, but would help COUP kind of companies. Because of pandemic all companies are working to reduce the expenses using digital technology. COUP kind of companies have the reputation that it would quickly save millions of dollars by automating the procurement and efficiently manage expenses. That perception and momentum is working and that’s why no one is worried about the PE, multiples, etc. Some day earnings will take a prime seat and momentum will die, but not in near term."
