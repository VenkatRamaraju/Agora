"TSA. 2,238,462. Things that make you go hum!!!!!"
Just keep buying this. The airlines will bounce back into big profits and you will be glad you kept buying this low.
Salad. BoOut
Now as I said last week after earnings. Price will go down. Up some and dip back down. Then. Climb. So. I was 100% right so far. Should of bought on the dip. Superman!!!!!!!!!!
Buying when there is PANIC on the street !Earnings are ALL positive.
My special Analysts told me DAL surely will be in the high $50 and beyond anytime soon.Tomorrow for sure will be $43 and above !
People are complaining about individuals not getting vaccinated. And there’s thousands of new cases of Covid every day. But correct me if I’m wrong… Everyone of the people who survive Covid are naturally vaccinated correct? A very small percentage die but most have morbidity issues that will take them out soon enough anyway. Quite honestly that’s besides the point. The main point is thousands of people are getting medically vaccinated and thousands are getting naturally vaccinated each day. Why don’t we hear about this? Why is it ALWAYS negative Panic po.rn￼￼? It’s because the news media and this administration want you to panic for all the obvious reasons￼
Jimmy has left me a gaype. He just prepose a open marryage and I’m fundumbfed. He say he can’t keep puttin’ from the same green he need more then one fare way for his putter. I’m am at a lossed. May I can mayke it work. May be not. BoOut
"Awesome, this will help out my other airline stocks where there is a shortage of employees. Is Delta still located in racist Georgia too?"
Company had profits- this is a great buy. Should see an increase tomorrow.
nice my $39 buy order filled in morning now riding higher again
wow losing all the gains already might start daytrading till we start stabilizing
This is a good decision. They would lose more customers having unvaccinated staff in comparison to losing a small percentile of people who do not support the vaccine. This is overreaction at its finest and will be insignificant to earnings
"Delta Air Lines Earnings Top, American Airlines Sees Positive Cash Flow￼￼￼BILL PETERS 07:46 AM ET 07/14/2021Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL) both reported positive cash flow in the second quarter, ending cash burn for the first time since the pandemic high. Delta stock and AAL stock rose."
Canada to open border to fully vaccinated Americans in August 9! Can't go any lower! It is time!
Terrible.
Estimates are 6.16 billion in Revenue. Reality will be 7.1 billion
$42 billion going into airline infrastructure and tsa passengers averaging daily 2mil+. Screw covid-19 time for airlines to rally again
"$AAL gave a nice boost to $DAL before earnings. As they say, buy when there is fear and sell when the market is booming! Now is the time of fear after 4 earnings misses and the delta variant. Still holding a few weekly puts just in case the market does not react well but mostly 9/17 far out of the money calls."
"Atleast there was a pump before close. Good sign for tomorrow, usually this stock gets dumped before close. 2 Million was traded in the last few minutes."
"You ever wonder why Yahoo doesn't just automatically delete posts that contain the word ""discord"" in it. Yahoo must be getting some nice kickbacks from the ponzi scammers."
DAL is highly bullish and should rocket up to new high record in near term....it is a bargain BUY right now...
Hope we re-test $42.4 today
@Flaming Gay Captain Bobofly777 No offense intended but based upon your yahoo posts you seem to live a higher risk lifestyle than most. Does Delta charge you more for your health insurance or is it just those employees who have chosen to not get a Covid vaccine? Does that include employees that have a natural Covid immunity due to previous infection?
"charging 200 month more for unvaxx workers. This company is a heap of trash, that is for sure. Too chicken/)/) to mandate because they knew pilots would walk. Of course, leave it to Delta to scam people out of more money."
Come on $40..... and then hold the line
Wonder if we’re being dragged down by the Spirit / American airlines multiple cancellations today.? I guess another day where you can buy the dip.
I heard about DAL the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Morgan Stanley says Delta Airlines deserves to be trading significantly higher after earnings sell-off, gives a buy rating with $73 PT! (Their comments below)""Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker noted that Delta reported Q2 results better than the company's initial guidance and that is Q3 outlook compares well to the firm's and consensus estimates. The analyst, who believes Delta ""delivered the numbers and the tone of commentary needed for investors to keep the faith in the reopening narrative,"" thinks it ""makes zero sense"" that the stock price is basically where it was back in December when the vaccine news had just hit. With greater visibility on navigating the latest variant, which should become clear one way or the other by Labor Day, Shanker argues that Delta shares deserve to be trading ""significantly higher than current levels."" The analyst keeps an Overweight rating and $73 price target on Delta."""
Chocolate. BoOut
Travel statistics give us no reason for this today at all.
"Delta just announced they're buying back up to $1 billion worth of senior notes, this is what you call fantastic management. Always improving balance sheet."
Strong earnings expected!
DAL goes up sharply tomorrow for sure on earnings and guidance.
"DAL strong BEATS ever before...Delta Air Lines EPS beats by $0.30, beats on revenue https://seekingalpha.com/news/3715021-delta-air-lines-eps-beats-0_30-beats-on-revenue?source=Drive"
Revenue will blow estimates out of the water
"Guys, what is DAL's good entry price?"
"52 in April with little travel, and 41.35 now with huge travel??? This is a joke of a price."
"As usual the highly compensated executives can afford the fine to keep their immune systems intact. Only the working people have to pay the fine in order to make sure their already low standard of living drops. Why does anyone work for a company where the executives don't do their own investigation on something as important as this mRNA mandate? Cut the Covid bonus hospitals, (who have also cut their beds by ~1/3 since 1996 before 25 million more people reached senior status) receive and watch the cases drop like a rock. Didn't the UK find that 64% of Covid cases came to the hospital for other ailments and were subsequently determined to be Covid afte0r being admitted? Wasn't it discovered that hospitals are usually 90% occupied on average pre-Covid but at the most during Covid they were 82% occupied on average? By law, hospitals have to be able to accommodate 125% occupancy in an emergency.A lot of information here but the bottom line is the CEO is just following the political winds and didn't make this decision based on facts."
DELTA issues a $200 monthly fine to unvaccinated employees.
"This is nothing more than manipulation plain and simple. It's what 100% of the market is based on now. You're either lucky enough to own what they're going to pump up, or you're unlucky and own something they're going to knock down to get a better entry point. Charts, statistics, ratios, financials and anything used to make logical decisions are now useless. This is glorified gambling now, and the house always has the edge. $UAL $DAL $LUV"
Too many chartists causing strange movement. Complete disregard that come 2022 the airlines will be rolling in $$
We have lost $10 a share in 3 months on the strongest travel we have seen in 18 months. WTH!!
Hate to say it but we will probably see 38 before 42 but hope I'm wrong. My 100k is now locked up for awhile!
My post yesterday mentioned $7.1 billion bs $6.2 estimate
"Overall, DAL will slide to around $25 as the DELTA Variant picks up speed around the world. And now there is another variant that has not been given a formal name as yet! Apparently the longs are wearing rose colored glasses and can't see the obvious disaster that is looming in front of their own faces."
Only a matter of time
Stock market going up and there sure is a lot of talk about “vaccinated”Democrats getting Covid on the news all of a sudden.￼
"I think we have exhausted all the good news here.... good earnings, upgrades, UP partnership, etc. The only catalyst remaining is transatlantic reopening. This better run up to $46 next week."
"Added 5 more & watching to add more if keeps dropping, seeds now corp later"
So delta unions where are you now? If you don’t stand against this CEO’s BS then what good are you?
"Holding 14,251 shares with an average of $44.03. Stay strong my fellow bag holders!"
Delta will FLY soon!!
Delta can take a hike instead of hiking premiums on people because of something that's called a choice.Never flying Delta again.
"What are the LT implications of these vaccines - you and I cannot look into a crystal ball or we would have enough money to pay $200,000 extra a month for this leper status...and buy our own island to escape the tyranny. Well over 100 FDA approved medications are no longer sold due to LT data indicating too many bad outcomes (wikipedia has a list). What will be the fate of these vaccines over the next 10 years? It's a lie for anyone to say they have that answer now. It's criminal to punish people before they have committed a crime. When they charge for medical coverage by age, sex, weight, BP, glucose, aortic measurements, heart measurements, heart efficiency, family history for terminal disease (a sad reality), oxygen saturation, overall blood levels, ability to stand up from the floor without assistance, etc. etc. etc. then I'll gladly pay more (or less)..."
another 1k shares at $40.15 looks good to me
"After all the weak hands shaken off the table, DAL will flying up like a rocket soon...."
Just too cheap.
options chain points to $47-50 PT move next week buy in cheap now
getting ready for next run .
decent recovery today keep adding on the dips covid is not going to stop US domestic travel
What will this stock price be in 6 months?

I am so glad i bought at the money calls!
"Got out this morning at a loss. It’s not the Delta variant. It’s not Covid. It’s the ruling party in America that is destroying the economy as fast as they can. Huge market correction coming and it was all unnecessary. But these bozos in office want Socialism and the best way to get it is to destroy the economy. For those of you who voted these local and national liberals into office, you’re getting exactly what you voted for. The result of voting with Clueless gullible feeling not logic. ￼￼What a shame.￼￼"
Simply amazing. Trading at 80% of yearly revenue
Follow the earnings. When they report earnings. We go down. Then up some. Then you may see a small down. Then up up and away. If they would open international traveling like the ceo is pushing Congress. BOOOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!’
WERE GOING HIGHER
Delta is doin great wit making profits and cutting debt. Thats want u want to see an airline coming recovering from pandemic. Thats y u see all those upgrades coming out. Do your DD and u will see Delta soaring back to new highs soon
pretty much have to wait till next earnings for any significant push upwards

Buy airlines because COVID will disappear in a month like it is doing in the U.K. delta will jump to 60
42.9-43 close.. calling it today.can it close above 43.2 though not sure..
Come on now. This is the dip I was talking about. Earnings will make it drop. Go up some then drop again and start the climb. 10 more days and it will be up 45 ish. Then will go higher.
For the delta ceo supporters! It’s not about concern for your health!
At lease a bit of a dead cat bounce today.
"LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - The head of global airline body IATA said he was cautiously optimistic about demand for travel in the second half of the year, adding that he expects transatlantic flying between Britain and the United States to re-open in the coming weeks.Schedules are expanding as airlines sense consumer demand for travel rising and progress with COVID-19 vaccinations means shuttered routes could resume, International Air Transport Association Director General Willie Walsh told reporters."
"Delta Unions, WHERE ARE YOU?"
so much manipulation by the hedge funds today wats going on?
Market cap is only $26 billion. At $7 billion a quarter their revenue will EXCEED market cap. Rare event
"DAL, V, AMZN are in a big sale for long term investors."
Come to $BA and make money
I’m out of airlines for a bit. Bridgewater news is not good. I think we might see a dip to $35-$36 this month before $DAL starts going up to $48.
Delta is hiking premiums on all unvaccinated folks getting onboard. Hit their pocket book I guess. But really they should not be seating them in the same plane as vaccinated folks period.
"Clot SHot gas lighting , Violation of US Constitution Discrimination Has Delta done this to smokers?Heavy drinkers?Non- seat belters?Non helmet riders?If not this is arbitrary to the absurd."
Delta is the best run US carrier. didn't have any forced furlough and flights are all full. I'm going back for more.
Undervalued here...........................buy the DIPS...if any.FAANG stocks starting a bottom !
Anyone noticing the hammer candlestick on airline stocks? Super bullish short term but we will see tomorrow. Hoping for $45-$46 by next week
Those selling have you been to an airport?
"Canada land border travel ban extension was a set back for the travel industry. Same will happen for EU/UK. I think it’s time we all get vaccinated and learn to live with covid! Biden is pushing it now. There is no logical science behind allowing US citizens to travel and letting them in, but keeping tourists out. Makes no sense!"

at least 50 dollars a share by October. I am not the smartest investor in the world but smart enough to know its time to load up!

"I'll say it again, COERCION is always a BAD IDEA !COERCION is the practice of persuading someone to do something by using force or threats. It is MORALLY WRONG to do so !"

This was in the 60's prior to pandemic. Should be able to get back to $50 with those revenue numbers and projections

very typical of institutional investors to short and scare away all the weak hands before earnings.So they can buy back during premarket at a very low price when earnings is released.
Pre-market looking ugly for no good reason. Cash has followed pre-market trend this entire week.

"is a BUY opportunity down to these levels now, once the Delta variants settles we headed much higher from here."
Delta peak out!!! Market is for future not current. Reopening stocks are ready to take off!!!
42.2+ needs to be seen and any close near day high is needed.
It will be too late if you wait for travel to fully recover. Will be baked in by that point.

Holding $600k worth of DAL and $500k worth of UAL. I’m stubborn as an ox and I’m not selling. I refuse to lose money on these.
"Slim,A couple of days you posted about doubling down on your DAL shares. Nice trade. At today's price, yours was a really savvy buy. Consider an alternative, because there's more than one way to skin the cat.If one is buying long for the upward potential, it might be more cost efficient to buy, for example, January 2023 LEAPS (calls) at the 30-strike. For the equivalent of buying 500 shares of DAL at $40 each ($20,000), one could have bought 14 2023 LEAPS at the 30-strike, giving them effective control of 1400 shares. Yes, 30-strike LEAPS presently have a delta of about 80.00 -- meaning that at the present, for every dollar Delta rises the LEAPS only increase by about $0.80, but, as Delta continues to rise, the delta rises too; so, by the time DAL reaches about $46 the delta will be about 90%. What this means is that those 14 LEAPS are about the equivalent of owning 1250 shares of DAL.One issue to consider is that one pays for time when they buy calls of any kind, and when buying 2023 30-strike DAL LEAPS, one will pay about $.005 per share per day for the time component, or in other words they'll lose about $200 worth of time value per month on those 14 LEAPS. If one expects DAL to reach $50 by say March of 2022, they will have incurred about $1200.00 in time costs. Comparing the gains of common stock versus the LEAPS, those 500 shares of common increasing by $10, from $40 to $50, will produce a profit of about $5.000.00. However, those alternative substitute LEAPS will generate a profit of closer to $10,000 over the same time period. (1250 equivalent shares is a value increase of $12,500 X a delta of about 90.00 = $11,250. Next, subtract the time expenses over those 6 months of about $1200.00 and that leaves a profit of about $10,000.00).And, for folks who like to sells calls against their common, they can always sell those same calls against the LEAPS."

What an investment this is!!
Airlines are capital intensive businesses. Higher fuel costs=lower margins. And they cant increase fares due to fewer passengers flying. the ones who are flying are low budget passengers. We need to see Corporate and International flyers back asap.

Delta forcing people to take vaccines that are not safe.

According to nuremburg code forcing people to take experimental drugs is punishable by death. Hope delta's executives are prepared to die for their decisions to force people to take a dangerous shot that has killed thousands when there are covid treatments that are nearly 100% effective.

Daytrading the price moves has been good so far. Till we get closer toward earnings ill take up a large position as we should hit $50 again for Q3. Travel numbers has been very consistent so far hoping for more international and business travel to increase along the way
30% gain from yesterdays low get us back to 52 week high.Its definitely good pullback to buy into.

Time to buy. 20% rally within 2 weeks from now.
BUY NOW
Just doubled down!!!!!!
I will keep buying Delta through the 40s and sell @ 75.
Added heavily today.
Buy and Long Hold for this undervalued gem
Certainly strange price action pre market.
Fuel shortages are a bigger threat to this stock than the Delta Covid variant. When you have shortages the price will necessarily rise. That will put pressure on the leisure traveler at a time when the business traveler hasn't yet returned. I will probably move on.
dal should be up 4 bucks. great job dal
Ocean. BoOut
flew mutiple airlines this summer. their employees were the worst. Gestopo in delta uniforms.
Every single thing was strongly positive. No reason for DAL to not rocket from here. It's a matter of time.
I have always said that this is the largest Casino in the world. We the retail investor have no control of the market. There are powers to be who have. We work hard to get ahead but they control the markets.
Can’t believe you dimwits think this is a bad decision. Being unvaccinated is costing them $50000 for each employer in hospital fees along with people not flying due to fear of covid. This is a matter of statistical evidence and this is the best choice for the company to thrive In times like this.
What a buy!!!! It may never see 30’s again!! Loading the boat. Longs will make so much money here!
Air travels are booming in this summer season as vaccines rollouts expanding through out all USA and the whole world as well....I see a lot of air tickets bookings ahead of this full summer vacation after the pandemic...So expecting DAL 'll be UP HUGE tomorrow and for the rest of this summer....
Do not sell a share until $52 at least. Crazy low.
I want to hear the woke Ed Basstain come out against the crime’s of hunamity in Afghanistanianian’s by them Icicle’s and Al Kayda’s like he scream about Georgia voter “oppressive’ law’s. Silence. As expected. But I bet DETLA making a mint of them CARF flight’s. The hippocrite. BoOut
Is it time to use caution concerning Dal shares? Thoughts?
TSA 2.23mm travelers on the 18th. still trending up. algos want your $. don't fall for the scare tactics.
Delta $DAL said today it plans to add used Boeing and Airbus planes due to an increase in demand
Had to add more this morning.
"Haters will be haters, but I still think DAL will bounce back to $45-$46 next week if not this week. I am hoping it's this week. Today was just a bad day for the entire market. In fact, the travel sector took a smaller hit. Growth stocks were wrecked today. Institutions are slowly and quietly buying. Don't be surprised to see a tremendous rally in the next 2 days."
Get ready forTAKE OFF soon.
i would be buying the dips now
"As soon as DAL stock price recovers to around 50, I will sell. I've had enough of activist CEO Ed Bastian entering the political fray. I don't know why so many CEO's feel they must publicly take sides on divisive political issues. When I bought early in the pandemic, it was between DAL and LUV. Wish I had bought the other."
Oh so bullish now! Another 4-5% tomorrow would be great. Consolidate next week and then 3rd leg up!
"USA Today did an article called ""Fact check: Yes, viruses can mutate to become more deadly"".Someone should put out an article: ""Fact check: Yes you can be killed by a squirrel"", because it's possible, in some very rare circumstances$LPI, $CPE, $SAVE, $DAL"
Somebody bought yesterday at 40.20. That is going to be an EPIC trade looking back 3 months from now.
"that's why I've learned to hold no matter what. the big boys were waiting for their moment. The delta variant is only hitting areas of the 3rd world hard which is no real surprise. The media is still trying to get the fear going. in Illinois, you are more than likely die from a gunshot wound than Covid."
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
"So Delta is going to deduct $200 from their unvaccinated workers as a fine. The affected employees have a wage and hour violation case against Delta, it is unlawful for an employer to fine or garnish an employee's pay unless the employee has signed an acknowledgement policy authorizing the employer to do so. Do you think any unvaccinated Delta employees have signed an authorization form allowing this $200 fine? You got a wage and hour case against Delta unvaccinated Delta employees, act on it. I know two individuals who are fully MRNA vaccinated in ICU right now with Covid, the MRNA vax does not work."
There’s two types of anti-vaxxers.. the one that dies pleading for the vaccine and the one that goes out with dignity whose last words are “the virus is fake.” Ha!
Google OANN report on vaccines only if you have an open mind! Yahoo keeps deleting the posts so you know there’s something to it!
"BREAKING: Canada just announced they're opening their borders to Americans on August 9th, huge influx of traveling demand coming for both countries.$AAL $UAL $LUV $BA $JETS $JBLU $SAVE $ABNB"
Manipulation by the big boys. Company can't do over $7 billion in revenue a quarter and not reach $50. Share
Citi says travel down 20% last couple weeks.
SOLD41.00I am out..................................
lol the anti vaxxers are complaining here go get a life
Simply amazing. Market cap dropping under $26 billion and based on current quarter and projected revenue should do over $30 billion on the year
Going to Vegas as putting money in stocks in downright gambling!
"I like the price here. Especially looking out a couple years. Ask yourself, what percent of the public has not been vaccinated? Small segment of the general public fly. In some states and demographics more than others. My argument is that of the majority choosing or needing to fly, the percent vaccinated is likely higher than the general public, especially the underinformed. I don't see the variants posing a real issue."
Added today. Tomorrow DAL shines.
Delta Airlines continues to bow to the government gods because they know that sooner or later they will need another taxpayer bailout.
"Go woke, go broke."
"Hmm, I bought in around 18 during pandemic. Why is this down today? Debating if I should take my profits or just wait to triple my investment by next year."
Delta not requiring employees to get vaccinated? If true we'll be looking at alternatives.
Over sold more than it should be . Undervalued
Fear usually means BUY.
This travel drop has been almost 18 months now and should be moving up strong daily. Come Sept when the Wall At guys return from vacation look out above from here.
BIG TSA numbers 2.238 million

still going strong after hrs
"DELTA airlines now implementing increase in health coverage if you do the following.Ride a motorcycle, drive without a seatbelt, smoke cigarettes and more you'll need to pay and extra $200 per month."
Delta will crush themselves with this $200 increase a month. I heard so many people refusing to fly delta. Good job delta. I'm selling off my stock.
DAL under $39.50 is the joke of the year to date. So oversold!
Bought some calls for the end of summer and beginning of next year. Will be looking to exercise them. The market have been treating these travel stocks way too harshly
institutions trying to play you again. keeping the price low pre market so you panic sell at open after an amazing blowout earnings report. not gonna work this time
such a rollercoster~1 day - stock fall- explanation - investors panicing over delta virus and inflation2 day - stocks soar - investors looking past virus and inflation is temporary -funny :)
Tuesday - AAL announces earnings beat in advanceWednesday - DAL announces earnings beat and profits pre-taxThursday - Raymond James Double Upgrade for DALFriday - Biden announces he will communicate transatlantic re-opening plan in a few daysSaturday - Morgan Stanley upgrades DAL to $73 maintaining overweight rating.Sunday - OPEN agrees to boost oil supply which could help control oil pricesThis is it. We do not need more news from here. DAL will bounce harder than ever. Remember those 8-10% days in late 2020 and early 2021? Lets run up to $46 this week. Weak hands will sell and re-enter at a higher price.
Delta Air Lines: Surging Travel Demand Will Send This Stock To New Highs https://seekingalpha.com/article/4431820-delta-air-lines-surging-travel-demand-will-send-this-stock-to-new-highs?source=Drive
"If youre not buying the dips during all this bozo pandemic news, you’re a bozo yourself. countless names setting up for nice run into next year. You can really buy across the board. Delta is an easy pick. Have fun watching the daily ups and downs."
Screaming deal!!
Yesterday sell off was excessive. Time to pour the money back in! There is no risk in this stock in term of future profitability.
There is a good reason why Buffet sold his DAL shares. I did too. Good luck to longs.
I have GTC sell at $52.75..........the farther it falls the faster a recovery imho.........
This is a no brainer investment. When previous earnings and revenues start returning you are looking at a sure 30-40% return from this price. Delta is also rated as America’s favourite airline based off consumer reports. Sack up and buy so you can pat yourself on the back 2 years from now as you pay off a chunk of your mortgage.
lets take back $40 today
"Since a few of you asked how I could be up total portfolio today of over 1% while taking a beating in ZM (and buying more ZM this morning!!) - my 4 losers today were #ZM #AAPL #COIN and #ME - my winners were #SDC #LL #HOTH #CNK #BABA #F #PRVB #VAL #GE #DAL #DD #MRNA and #DEN Ironically, I like, most of the time, to keep the PEG around 1… last week I was almost all in and needed to free up some cash, so I sold all the stocks outside of near 1 PEG or below… EXCEPT ZOOM! Oh well, I’m still a believer at these levels!!"
"Buy airlines, last chance to get in before 20%+ gain...$DAL $AAL $UAL $SAVE $JETS $JBLU $ALK"
Few weeks from now USA cases will go down. India. UK And almost Mexico had more cases of COVID then USA. Democrats and the media pumps this up like kids. Geez
hf algo back in buying mode
keep loading up on those shares and call options
6 days down and DAL has already announced numbers that beat estimates. This is way overdone here.
"Delta will beat all analyst estimates for Q2. You will know if you have travelled recently. Load factor is maxed out, not a single empty seat on busy routes. International travel is an issue, business travel is slowly resuming. Lower to mid $50s should come by August. Delta variant fears will diminish in a few weeks. Transatlantic flights re-opening in a few weeks could be a major catalyst to hit pre-pandemic share prices."
They have squeezed all they are going to get out of airlines and travel stocks which should be on a tear right now.
"Insider Trends: Insider Buying Added to with Purchase of Delta Air Lines SharesBY MT Newswires— 4:51 PM ET 08/05/202104:51 PM EDT, 08/05/2021 (MT Newswires) -- David S Taylor, Director, made a purchase of 5,000 shares in Delta Air Lines for $196,485 on Aug 03, 2021. Taylor, after the transactions described in the SEC Form 4 filing, owns 28,580 shares of the company, with a market value, based on the prior-day closing price, of $1.10 million.In the 90 days previous to the date of this filing, there have been 14 insider transactions reported to the SEC for Delta Air Lines These transactions came from the activities of 11 individual insiders that resulted in a net acquisition of 202,613 company shares.

"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Thetraderguide.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I don’t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"
loaded up more for next Q3 earnings.
"My wife is a flight attendant for Delta. Just flew with her the last three days. Atlanta airport was packed and all four of my flights were full. People wearing masks but flying. Yes Covid is real. These analysts should travel some what before they give their analysis on airline stocks. It's a game that is always in their favor, to purchase at a discount price. Hold and buy for long term."
It is shameful for Delta to receive stimulus money from the US government and buy foreign Airbus airplanes . Buy American things policy of Joe B is a joke?
"Such mixed sentiments about airline stocks. Some are going short, some long. Chart on support level, ready to bounce, ready to break support to $39! What’s going on? Airports are packed, flights are full, ticket prices are soaring, oil is slowly dropping, major airlines will be profitable in July. Let’s go long people. Let’s break through all the way to $56. Has to happen next month!"
"Major catalyst for airlines next week, the transatlantic route is one of the most profitable for airlines.White House says they're reviewing lifting the European travel ban, an update will be given in a few days.$AAL $UAL $LUV $BA $JETS $JBLU $SAVE"
I'm not flying Delta never again...
Let's move up already DAL. Increasing profitability in upcoming quarters is inevitable. Dividend re-in statement is a certainty.
Sold my 2500 shares 40min ago. Don't care if the stock triples.
"Delta will not require flight attendants to be vaccinated. I know a Delta attendant who I thought was vaccinated when she invited me to her home. (Months ago before vaccine was ready) Turns out it was gonna be 7 people from 5 different homes, no one vaccinated. I was shocked that she was flying all over the world, PROBABLY SPREADING THE VIRUS EVERYWHERE, and I declined her invitation to her ""get CoVID here party."" Because Delta is a mostly Southern airline, they won't require it. Unlike United is requiring flight attendants (today's news) to get it."
Pretty nice quarter. I like targeting an average of 20%+/year looking out to 2024.
"All hype,delta news,worries,technicals and manipulations aside this at 40 is too cheap and its all that matters"
"Now is when you need to ask yourself....Am I investing in this company for a week, a month, a year, or 3 to 5 years? If you are looking out to 2024-2025, I think you have a nice opportunity to outperform the market. In the short run, there is a lot of noise weighing on COVID names. Volume is coming back and more people are traveling. The trend should continue for the next few years, barring another pandemic.Revenue for 2021 is likely back at 2015 levels (40 billion) and will climb back to 2019 levels by 2024. No dividend will allow low interest rate debt to be paid down. Earnings should be back to the $7 range in two years."
Well we’ll. Why is COVID cases going down this week. Are we over the hump like UK did
Health expert: Serious cases slowing down amid booster campaignJUST LIKE UK.
Hopefully good news coming soon
"Here's an excerpt from a report by Science Magazine: The new analysis relies on the database of Maccabi Healthcare Services, which enrolls about 2.5 million Israelis. The study, led by Tal Patalon and Sivan Gazit at KSM, the system’s research and innovation arm, found in two analyses that people who were vaccinated in January and February were, in June, July, and the first half of August, six to 13 times more likely to get infected than unvaccinated people who were previously infected with the coronavirus. In one analysis, comparing more than 32,000 people in the health system, the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 was 27 times higher among the vaccinated, and the risk of hospitalization eight times higher."
hugely oversold territory down here.
A rare buying opportunity here
Vetted and vaccinated Canadians can’t come to America but a flood of Covid infected people and violent criminals and drugs can flood in the southern border without restriction?￼
$46 by end of day ?
This is a longer play. 60-70% return in the next 6 months easily
"Ouch! Close to a half a dollar loss! Planes are full, share prices dropping. Hmmmm"
The Rona is the greatest Psy-Ops Fraud in history that's why the goal post keep changing and nothing makes sense . The media propaganda is relentless . Attorneys all over the worldand good citizens will expose . Follow the money
FYI. Media pumps and dumps the stock market. This time last year 70k active cases and almost 1k deaths. And guess WHAT. DAL stock was at 51.00 a share. This virus is still here and if you look at it’s pattern. It goes up and down like a roller coaster in a circle. So it’s human behavior that we do. Summer is high right now people are gathering. Again. It’s not the virus and how bad it is. GET Vaccinated. You’d be out of your mind to sell. Heck give me your money let me make you some. Cheers! .

$AAL $UAL $DAL every chart is exactly the same. So NONE of this is about the companies. Only about overarching narratives and sentiment. So we are trading emotional fake scare swings.
Price is ridiculously cheap once again.
Is there anyone else sensing a 5-7% rally tomorrow given the price action in the last 2 days? I think DAL has to settle between $45-$47 and then the covid cases dip and travel restrictions lifted news will be the next catalyst to $50+
"Delta Air Lines is not the only company requiring all new U.S. hires to be vaccinated against the coronavirus . The other compaines are Amtrak , Anthem , BlackRock , Cisco , Citigroup , CVS Health , Deloitte , Door Dash , Equinox , Facebook , Ford , Goldman Sachs , Google , Jefferies , Lyft , MGM Resorts International , Microsoft , Morgan Stanley , NBCUniversal , Netflix , Salesforce , TJX , Tyson Foods , United Airlines , Walgreens , The Walt Disney Company , Walmart , and The Washington Post . Great move by Delta Air Lines , and good luck to the stock holders ."
Well. I was a day late when I said the stock will level at 42.00
Airlines are doing well and Covid situation is improving around the world. Just a matter of time till the money rotates back into the airlines and it will explode since upside pressure is building up.
$25 billion market cap yet $30 billion in Revenue!!
IMO its mid 50s by EO Sept
They had some interesting insights about DAL on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
DAL stock will do well in 2022
Buying more37.00-38.00
The delta virus. Look at UK. They were the hot spot just a month ago. Now they are going down. It’s just a rollercoaster ride. Everybody will get off in a few weeks. Media ugh
