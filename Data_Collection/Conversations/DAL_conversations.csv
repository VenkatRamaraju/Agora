ITs just short selling. they are selling to buy in cheaper. High ups will START BUYING NOW.
Today is your last day to scoop up DAL and other airlines for cheap. Game on starting next week... mark my words. lol!
"The travel demand is very high right now, and it will continue all the way until end of next year, the only thing that pull back all airlines stock is just the fuel price - it's more like an excuse for the analyst to cast a gloomy future for airlines stock, airlines company will hedge fuel price for sure, they are not first day in business. Besides, fuel price is something that government can interfere, this is not pandemic, OPEC has to do something about it. $AAL $UAL $DAL are all in bargain price now, buy at this price and just hold on to it, and you will have handsome return next year."
"MS analyst note acknowledged that too much fear was reflected in DAL yesterday. Note was titled “Peak Fear Presents Peak Opportunity” and reflected on mgmt overall positive and encouraging commentary. Bottom line, it appears that all the risk related to cost headwinds are priced in but the good news is not. Bottom line, DAL is risk-reward is very attractive."
"Let's go Brandon, for shutting down domestic energy production on day 1!"
Mark and Frank just pranced in to our lake house holding hand’s and giggling  like the Binky Twin’s use to and Mark look’s like he found his man in Frank. Shhhh Frank just whipser that Mark have a teeny vlaustoker that don’t has to much life to it.Yea Mark you all member aren’t you???BoOut
November 8th is near. Expect positive inflow from outside the US. 39 looks attractive especially looking out 24 months when we will likely see the stock back in the 60s.
"""Every single year for the past 5 years the airlines ETF Jets and other airline companies have ran up in November. This time there's also a massive catalyst on November 8th as the International travel ban is lifted in the US. Warning sent."" https://twitter.com/expandingmatter/status/1453883632838402139?s=20$JETS $DAL $UAL $AAL $LUV $BA $ALK"
"Let put it this way, the fuel cost rise because the demand is high, demand is high because border has been re-opened soon and people eager to fly, that's also means airlines company is selling more tickets and the business is good. So why is it a bad thing? Does market hope for fuel price is low due to supply over demand? That suppose to prop the stock price? Btw, minimum wages is increasing, money is printing, people are now asking for 4th stimulus check, child tax credit, strike all over country asking for higher pay and benefits, the government keep pouring money into the economy - remember 3.5 trillions spending plan? All commodity cost is inflated and you expect oil to stay low? Once people realize oil price hike is inevitable, all airlines stock will roaring back. $UAL $AAL $ DAL"
this news today should have rocketed delta higher. im buying it
Oil price going down and airlines stock going down too? You gotta be kidding me.
HERE WE GO! 
"Why is AAL and UAL rising over 1.5% and DAL falling 0.35%? Makes no sense, other than pure manipulation. Options should not be allowed for instruments that value a business. It's a shame we still allow that."
Added a ton of shares today. This will pop in the medium run as travel demand is on a continued path up and high oil prices are only temporary.
we will be $45 soon....
Why are airline stocks down when leisure travel demand is skyrocketing in time for winter holidays in place of business travels?
"Nice TSA numbers...2.2 million on Sunday. This quarter international travel will open up.Travel website Kayak said on Monday searches related to international travel to the United States spiked 48% on Saturday, compared to the same day one week earlier.This followed the White House's announcement on Friday that it would lift COVID-19 travel restrictions for fully vaccinated international visitors starting Nov. 8."
"I want to buy, possibly 500 shares of something. But I don't know whether to buy LUV, or DAL, and I don't know whether to get in now or wait a month or two to see if they drop more?"
"oil reversal incoming, load up on dal"
If or when DAL ever drops back under $40 buy every share you can.
Flying international across the Pacific will recover soon with border restriction loosening in November. Atlantic routes should recover too in time for holidays. People are not reserving two months ahead like they used to because volatility of the cases.
Hopefully I didn’t jump the gun but I loaded up Friday!!!!!!!!
"Reading the board you can tell shorts are worried,they are really pumping trying to get everyone to sell"
I like selling aapl above 150 and buying dal under 39.
"Today is the time to accumulate airlines stock. Let the short have today, I will be focus on next week."
Loaded up 1000 shares. DAL will be back into the mid 40's by the EOY.
Nothing this Industry does satisfies Wall Street. Wall Street only saw the fuel cost but didn't see all the positive things in DAL earnings from profitability to business travel rebounding to load factor. I am amazed and disgusted!
"The risk to reward for airlines at these levels is amazing, incoming catalysts below:- Massive influx of demand on November 8th as international travel ban is lifted by the US- Holiday season demand will be higher than usual as many weren't able to travel last holiday season- Oil prices have peaked short-term and is beginning to downtrend a bit- As demand increases pricing power of ticket prices will combat elevated oil costs.$DAL $UAL $AAL $LUV $JETS $BA"
"nuts to not buy these lull prices in airlines imo. like everything else post covid, demand, both pent up and growth trend, will rip & supply will be running full speed to catch up and prices will rise. Happening in every business, and anyone who thinks for some reason it will be different here is missing the fat pitch, which frankly is fine with me. Just talking here. CFLO waterfall coming in near future years... Efficiency and productivity high ticks. United for ex talking $20 eps 5 yrs out. npv those trends and I like this trade. a lot. I am also very interested to see actual new airplane demand in 1-3 years, and the following mid time frame. Boeing and Airbus will have trouble meeting it, imo, again, pushing up prices. Aside from a s- show of a global recession, I just don't see this stuff not happening. but haters are gonna hate. grab some popcorn and watch the show. Constructive thoughts? Emphasis on Constructive please."
Bought 10000 today.... Expecting $45 By end of year....
I have total faith in Ed Bastian.
"Covid pill will be approved in a few weeks, plus US border opening could be good catalysts for airlines in November."
Jimmy just got kick of a flight for a mask  violator’s and is in police custardy and I can’t stop crying. He refused to take his mask off while eating and drinking and had fruity drinks and pasta and a delight fill salad and even timarusu smashed in to his face and all over his tray table and the floor like a infant. The FA call the captain and when we land police grab Jimmy and we now in the hoizgow and I’m crying like a infint my self and oh my Jimmy a sloppy mess. He telling the cop’s he just beeing extra careful cuz he has a bout a dozened co mobitidities and he don’t want CORVID 19. Advise please?!?!?!?!?BoOut
I think investing in bitcoin now will be the best option now especially with the current rate of the market
"Buy as much as you are able , we will be $45 soon...."
"OK, now I have 25K freed from other investments I sold off...want to invest it in LUV and DAL. Just waiting for the right day when the entire market takes a big dip to do it."
I don't know what people are doing not buying this dip... lol. So easy to make money from DAL and other airline stocks. Just matter of time before it shoots right back up.
"EPS is expected to swing back to positive territory for the first time in seven quarters on Wednesday. Estimates of $0.16 per share compared to a huge loss of -$3.30 per share seen in the same period a year ago.The Airline company, which provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United States and across the world, is forecast to report revenue growth of over 170% in the third quarter to around $8.4 billion."
"The real story is business travel is coming back and international travel is coming back,but now before the big pop !!!!!!!"
"Qantas to step up international flying amid 'massive demand' from Australians-All 11,000 idled staff to return by early December-To bring back two A380s earlier, may add three 787s-Sydney-New Delhi route to launch on Dec. 6-Hopes to add more flights as other state rules easesall good data points."
