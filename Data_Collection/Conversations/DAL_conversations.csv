i am getting the feeling that this Friday options ex morning hold down isn't going to last much longer. nice try to shake out some folks. the reopening wave is coming.
I'm adding...
Google OANN report on vaccines only if you have an open mind! Yahoo keeps deleting the posts so you know there’s something to it!
Why do the analysts have this set at “buy” and “strong buy”?
"Awesome, this will help out my other airline stocks where there is a shortage of employees. Is Delta still located in racist Georgia too?"
Selling here is not even an option.
Delta forcing people to take vaccines that are not safe. Japan Recalls 1.63 Million Doses Of Moderna Covid Vaccine Due To Foreign Material Contamination.Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has shown more vaccine deaths in the last year than the past 2 decades of all vaccines given. According to nuremburg code forcing people to take experimental drugs is punishable by death. Hope delta's executives are prepared to die for their decisions to force people to take a dangerous shot that has killed thousands when there are covid treatments that are nearly 100% effective.
Buying when there is PANIC on the street !Earnings are ALL positive.
Friday option pegging games as usual
Hilarious how there are so many shorts coming out the woodwork now saying the are “dumping their Delta stock” as if they own any long positions. Shorts about to get burned LMAO.
This is a no brainer investment. When previous earnings and revenues start returning you are looking at a sure 30-40% return from this price. Delta is also rated as America’s favourite airline based off consumer reports. Sack up and buy so you can pat yourself on the back 2 years from now as you pay off a chunk of your mortgage.
Tuesday - AAL announces earnings beat in advanceWednesday - DAL announces earnings beat and profits pre-taxThursday - Raymond James Double Upgrade for DALFriday - Biden announces he will communicate transatlantic re-opening plan in a few daysSaturday - Morgan Stanley upgrades DAL to $73 maintaining overweight rating.Sunday - OPEN agrees to boost oil supply which could help control oil pricesThis is it. We do not need more news from here. DAL will bounce harder than ever. Remember those 8-10% days in late 2020 and early 2021? Lets run up to $46 this week. Weak hands will sell and re-enter at a higher price.
"Hey Delta, OSHA says when you Require the Vaxx, then you are responsible for any adverse reactions! Given this I’m dumping my delta stock! Stockholders, you may want to consider this!!"
"So Delta is going to deduct $200 from their unvaccinated workers as a fine. The affected employees have a wage and hour violation case against Delta, it is unlawful for an employer to fine or garnish an employee's pay unless the employee has signed an acknowledgement policy authorizing the employer to do so. Do you think any unvaccinated Delta employees have signed an authorization form allowing this $200 fine? You got a wage and hour case against Delta unvaccinated Delta employees, act on it. I know two individuals who are fully MRNA vaccinated in ICU right now with Covid, the MRNA vax does not work."
Delta is hiking premiums on all unvaccinated folks getting onboard. Hit their pocket book I guess. But really they should not be seating them in the same plane as vaccinated folks period.
"Added 5 more & watching to add more if keeps dropping, seeds now corp later"
Now as I said last week after earnings. Price will go down. Up some and dip back down. Then. Climb. So. I was 100% right so far. Should of bought on the dip. Superman!!!!!!!!!!

"Overall, DAL will slide to around $25 as the DELTA Variant picks up speed around the world. And now there is another variant that has not been given a formal name as yet!

I’m out of airlines for a bit. Bridgewater news is not good. I think we might see a dip to $35-$36 this month before $DAL starts going up to $48.

Can’t believe you dimwits think this is a bad decision. Being unvaccinated is costing them $50000 for each employer in hospital fees along with people not flying due to fear of covid. This is a matter of statistical evidence and this is the best choice for the company to thrive In times like this.

"Here's an excerpt from a report by Science Magazine: The new analysis relies on the database of Maccabi Healthcare Services, which enrolls about 2.5 million Israelis. The study, led by Tal Patalon and Sivan Gazit at KSM, the system’s research and innovation arm, found in two analyses that people who were vaccinated in January and February were, in June, July, and the first half of August, six to 13 times more likely to get infected than unvaccinated people who were previously infected with the coronavirus. In one analysis, comparing more than 32,000 people in the health system, the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 was 27 times higher among the vaccinated, and the risk of hospitalization eight times higher."

The analyst, who believes Delta ""delivered the numbers and the tone of commentary needed for investors to keep the faith in the reopening narrative,"" thinks it ""makes zero sense"" that the stock price is basically where it was back in December when the vaccine news had just hit. With greater visibility on navigating the latest variant, which should become clear one way or the other by Labor Day, Shanker argues that Delta shares deserve to be trading ""significantly higher than current levels.""

For the equivalent of buying 500 shares of DAL at $40 each ($20,000), one could have bought 14 2023 LEAPS at the 30-strike, giving them effective control of 1400 shares. Yes, 30-strike LEAPS presently have a delta of about 80.00 -- meaning that at the present, for every dollar Delta rises the LEAPS only increase by about $0.80, but, as Delta continues to rise, the delta rises too; so, by the time DAL reaches about $46 the delta will be about 90%. What this means is that those 14 LEAPS are about the equivalent of owning 1250 shares of DAL.One issue to consider is that one pays for time when they buy calls of any kind, and when buying 2023 30-strike DAL LEAPS, one will pay about $.005 per share per day for the time component, or in other words they'll lose about $200 worth of time value per month on those 14 LEAPS. If one expects DAL to reach $50 by say March of 2022, they will have incurred about $1200.00 in time costs. Comparing the gains of common stock versus the LEAPS, those 500 shares of common increasing by $10, from $40 to $50, will produce a profit of about $5.000.00. However, those alternative substitute LEAPS will generate a profit of closer to $10,000 over the same time period. (1250 equivalent shares is a value increase of $12,500 X a delta of about 90.00 = $11,250. Next, subtract the time expenses over those 6 months of about $1200.00 and that leaves a profit of about $10,000.00).And, for folks who like to sells calls against their common, they can always sell those same calls against the LEAPS."
I want to hear the woke Ed Basstain come out against the crime’s of hunamity in Afghanistanianian’s by them Icicle’s and Al Kayda’s like he scream about Georgia voter “oppressive’ law’s. Silence. As expected. But I bet DETLA making a mint of them CARF flight’s. The hippocrite. BoOut
Detla TANKING agayn. This junkahunk air line is gonna be toylet paper stick beef four to long. With a meat stick like Edmund Basstain ruinning the company is any body supprize?BoOut
"Delta will not require flight attendants to be vaccinated. I know a Delta attendant who I thought was vaccinated when she invited me to her home. (Months ago before vaccine was ready) Turns out it was gonna be 7 people from 5 different homes, no one vaccinated. I was shocked that she was flying all over the world, PROBABLY SPREADING THE VIRUS EVERYWHERE, and I declined her invitation to her ""get CoVID here party."" Because Delta is a mostly Southern airline, they won't require it. Unlike United is requiring flight attendants (today's news) to get it."
no quarantine to UK for fully vaxxed ppl on August 2nd. Positive news for international travel
I will keep buying Delta through the 40s and sell @ 75.
It will be too late if you wait for travel to fully recover. Will be baked in by that point.
Passengers please put your tray in a upright position and get ready for take off!!!!!!!!!! 46.00
i would be buying the dips now
Wowza. Detla up a hole 17 CENT’s pre market yay!!! Me and Jonny gonna cebelrate with a fruity drink and may be a poke and blow. Oh them record TS&A number’s finally paying of. BoOut
Yay!!! Just got payed and bought a extra six share’s of Detla e’ff the virus going long on this pig even though Basstain a moderned day Antilla the Ham. BoOut
delta enforcing no right to choose policies yikes
Wonder if we’re being dragged down by the Spirit / American airlines multiple cancellations today.? I guess another day where you can buy the dip.
There’s two types of anti-vaxxers.. the one that dies pleading for the vaccine and the one that goes out with dignity whose last words are “the virus is fake.” Ha!
"As soon as DAL stock price recovers to around 50, I will sell. I've had enough of activist CEO Ed Bastian entering the political fray. I don't know why so many CEO's feel they must publicly take sides on divisive political issues. When I bought early in the pandemic, it was between DAL and LUV. Wish I had bought the other."
Salad. BoOut
Is there anyone else sensing a 5-7% rally tomorrow given the price action in the last 2 days? I think DAL has to settle between $45-$47 and then the covid cases dip and travel restrictions lifted news will be the next catalyst to $50+
"Took the family to Disney and flew on Delta. The moroon sitting in the window seat, and next to my child, decided to accept the advisory and watch the movie about Billie Holiday in front of my child and several sitting behind us. As she was getting beaten by her boyfriend my child asked why he was doing that to her. Not knowing what the movie was really about I simply replied, ""because he's a Democrat"". The moroon scowled but continued to watch. Not long after that my child was treated Billie engaging in full frontal and rear nudity including oral, back side, and front side adult activity. My child was stunned and asked what are they doing? At that point I took my child on a walk down the isle. When we returned I sat next to the moroon and put my child in the aisle seat. Thank you Delta! You are kind of are like a virus."
Time for a serious short squeeze!
@Flaming Gay Captain Bobofly777 No offense intended but based upon your yahoo posts you seem to live a higher risk lifestyle than most. Does Delta charge you more for your health insurance or is it just those employees who have chosen to not get a Covid vaccine? Does that include employees that have a natural Covid immunity due to previous infection?
"Here are my reflections on the day, as it relates to airline stocks...UAL closed at a solid +1.39%, which may seem like peanuts if you think it was up 4% an hour before close. However, a stock that has been hammered like the airline industry has in the last 2 months, is unlikely going to close any higher than 2% on a single day (unless there is a huge catalyst). Day traders who have bought the dip will take their profits before the bell rings. Which is exactly what happened today.Ultimately the industry will be back as soon as vaccinations start being at a good level and infections drop below an acceptable one as well. If you are looking to make a quick profit with the likes of $UAL, $AAL or $DAL, you are in the wrong place. But if you are looking for growth in the next 3 or so months and have bought in at July - August prices, you will be doing well.Anyway, good luck to you all."
I'm not flying Delta never again...
DELTA issues a $200 monthly fine to unvaccinated employees.
"No more conspiracy theories anymore, only facts. Everything the conspiracy people that were banned on all the platforms either already happened or is happening now. It's not incompetency, if it was all predicted. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has shown more vaccine deaths in the last year than the past 2 decades of all vaccines ever given. I honestly know more people that died of the vaccine then i know that died of covid."
Oh so bullish now! Another 4-5% tomorrow would be great. Consolidate next week and then 3rd leg up!
Roof. BoOut
never ever ever fly Delta..the #$%$ covid airline
"Cybersecurity breakthrough within days of NASDAQ listing and $10 million cash from MAXIM. Only 750,000 shares total outstanding. Price ready to pop really big!

CASINOS are tanking huge see wynn todayInflation report said airlines cutting rates as less flying hotels also..These airline stocks are so overvalued now as they say no recovery till 2025 !
COVID cases did not go up much yesterday. Leveling off just like UK. Media. Please post this.
Had to add more this morning.
"My wife is a flight attendant for Delta. Just flew with her the last three days. Atlanta airport was packed and all four of my flights were full. People wearing masks but flying. Yes Covid is real. These analysts should travel some what before they give their analysis on airline stocks. It's a game that is always in their favor, to purchase at a discount price. Hold and buy for long term."
"If market price is reflecting about 6-8 months ahead, these airline stocks will rise again around November. Until then I will be adding more stocks when it dips."
