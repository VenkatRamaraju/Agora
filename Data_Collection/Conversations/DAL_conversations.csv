Delta peak out!!! Market is for future not current. Reopening stocks are ready to take off!!!
Delta will crush themselves with this $200 increase a month. I heard so many people refusing to fly delta. Good job delta. I'm selling off my stock.
"Here's an excerpt from a report by Science Magazine: The new analysis relies on the database of Maccabi Healthcare Services, which enrolls about 2.5 million Israelis. The study, led by Tal Patalon and Sivan Gazit at KSM, the system’s research and innovation arm, found in two analyses that people who were vaccinated in January and February were, in June, July, and the first half of August, six to 13 times more likely to get infected than unvaccinated people who were previously infected with the coronavirus. In one analysis, comparing more than 32,000 people in the health system, the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 was 27 times higher among the vaccinated, and the risk of hospitalization eight times higher."
"So Delta is going to deduct $200 from their unvaccinated workers as a fine. The affected employees have a wage and hour violation case against Delta, it is unlawful for an employer to fine or garnish an employee's pay unless the employee has signed an acknowledgement policy authorizing the employer to do so. Do you think any unvaccinated Delta employees have signed an authorization form allowing this $200 fine? You got a wage and hour case against Delta unvaccinated Delta employees, act on it. I know two individuals who are fully MRNA vaccinated in ICU right now with Covid, the MRNA vax does not work."
Delta Airlines continues to bow to the government gods because they know that sooner or later they will need another taxpayer bailout.
pretty much have to wait till next earnings for any significant push upwards
There’s two types of anti-vaxxers.. the one that dies pleading for the vaccine and the one that goes out with dignity whose last words are “the virus is fake.” Ha!
@Flaming Gay Captain Bobofly777 No offense intended but based upon your yahoo posts you seem to live a higher risk lifestyle than most. Does Delta charge you more for your health insurance or is it just those employees who have chosen to not get a Covid vaccine? Does that include employees that have a natural Covid immunity due to previous infection?
They had some interesting insights about DAL on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Health expert: Serious cases slowing down amid booster campaignJUST LIKE UK.
"Do you also surcharge your employees that are obese, diabetic, or in poor health?"
"Guys, what is DAL's good entry price?"
"No more conspiracy theories anymore, only facts. Everything the conspiracy people that were banned on all the platforms either already happened or is happening now. It's not incompetency, if it was all predicted. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has shown more vaccine deaths in the last year than the past 2 decades of all vaccines ever given. I honestly know more people that died of the vaccine then i know that died of covid."
Screaming deal!!

Delta forcing people to take vaccines that are not safe. Japan Recalls 1.63 Million Doses Of Moderna Covid Vaccine Due To Foreign Material Contamination.Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has shown more vaccine deaths in the last year than the past 2 decades of all vaccines given. According to nuremburg code forcing people to take experimental drugs is punishable by death. Hope delta's executives are prepared to die for their decisions to force people to take a dangerous shot that has killed thousands when there are covid treatments that are nearly 100% effective.
"Hey Delta, OSHA says when you Require the Vaxx, then you are responsible for any adverse reactions! Given this I’m dumping my delta stock! Stockholders, you may want to consider this!!"
For the delta ceo supporters! It’s not about concern for your health!
This is a no brainer investment. When previous earnings and revenues start returning you are looking at a sure 30-40% return from this price. Delta is also rated as America’s favourite airline based off consumer reports. Sack up and buy so you can pat yourself on the back 2 years from now as you pay off a chunk of your mortgage.
Criminal behavior Delta…selling all shares today!
I'm not flying Delta never again...
$AAL $UAL $DAL every chart is exactly the same. So NONE of this is about the companies. Only about overarching narratives and sentiment. So we are trading emotional fake scare swings.
"You ever wonder why Yahoo doesn't just automatically delete posts that contain the word ""discord"" in it. Yahoo must be getting some nice kickbacks from the ponzi scammers."
keep loading up on those shares and call options
This is a good decision. They would lose more customers having unvaccinated staff in comparison to losing a small percentile of people who do not support the vaccine. This is overreaction at its finest and will be insignificant to earnings
"Companies who make these mandates think that people are lining up to get a job with them. In a labor shortage, even losing 2% of your staff can be devistating."
Delta still losing a lot of money. Why not invest in a company currently profitable ?
"Delta Air Lines is not the only company requiring all new U.S. hires to be vaccinated against the coronavirus . The other compaines are Amtrak , Anthem , BlackRock , Cisco , Citigroup , CVS Health , Deloitte , Door Dash , Equinox , Facebook , Ford , Goldman Sachs , Google , Jefferies , Lyft , MGM Resorts International , Microsoft , Morgan Stanley , NBCUniversal , Netflix , Salesforce , TJX , Tyson Foods , United Airlines , Walgreens , The Walt Disney Company , Walmart , and The Washington Post . Great move by Delta Air Lines , and good luck to the stock holders ."
Delta can take a hike instead of hiking premiums on people because of something that's called a choice.Never flying Delta again.
Can’t believe you dimwits think this is a bad decision. Being unvaccinated is costing them $50000 for each employer in hospital fees along with people not flying due to fear of covid. This is a matter of statistical evidence and this is the best choice for the company to thrive In times like this.
"DELTA airlines now implementing increase in health coverage if you do the following.Ride a motorcycle, drive without a seatbelt, smoke cigarettes and more you'll need to pay and extra $200 per month."
Google OANN report on vaccines only if you have an open mind! Yahoo keeps deleting the posts so you know there’s something to it!
"As usual the highly compensated executives can afford the fine to keep their immune systems intact. Only the working people have to pay the fine in order to make sure their already low standard of living drops. Why does anyone work for a company where the executives don't do their own investigation on something as important as this mRNA mandate? Cut the Covid bonus hospitals, (who have also cut their beds by ~1/3 since 1996 before 25 million more people reached senior status) receive and watch the cases drop like a rock. Didn't the UK find that 64% of Covid cases came to the hospital for other ailments and were subsequently determined to be Covid afte0r being admitted? Wasn't it discovered that hospitals are usually 90% occupied on average pre-Covid but at the most during Covid they were 82% occupied on average? By law, hospitals have to be able to accommodate 125% occupancy in an emergency.A lot of information here but the bottom line is the CEO is just following the political winds and didn't make this decision based on facts."
Time to buy. 20% rally within 2 weeks from now.
DELTA issues a $200 monthly fine to unvaccinated employees.
Sold my 2500 shares 40min ago. Don't care if the stock triples.
