$90 by the end of the year!
Up $3 in the after hours market...what's up?
Has the Danfoss deal closed?
when is Ex-Div?
"Was looking to get some opinions here. I'm a distributor for eaton's electrical unit. I'm also an individual stock holder. Within the past year or so, and still going on, Eaton has had trouble filling my orders and in some cases back ordering items for multiple months. Mostly this involves circuit breakers, but some other items too. My question is, would you view this as positive since obviously their products are in demand, or negative since a large company should be able to fill orders in a reasonable time frame. My customers love the quality material, but myself and Eaton have lost orders because of this. Thoughts?"
I think they surprise on the upside tomorrow. Hopefully future guidance will also be positive.
The proposed budget shows $80B for the grid system. Eaton should gain nicely from this.
"From the conference call.....Eaton M&A, closing three deals. We're also making good progress toward the closure of the previously announced acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems as well as the divestiture of Hydraulics. And finally, we recently announced the agreement to acquire 50% of Jiangsu YiNeng meaning electric's busway business in China, an important part of our growth strategy for the Asia Pacific region. Having been quite busy on the M&A front, we thought it'd be helpful to provide a summary of these three recent deals. We covered Tripp Lite and Cobham Mission Systems acquisitions in some depth on the investor meetings, but each of these three deals here certainly advanced our strategic growth objectives and our electrical business.First, Green Motion, based in Switzerland, it expands our capabilities in the electrical charging market where we expect to see significant growth over the next decade linked to energy transition. Their proven charter designs and advanced power management capabilities, billing software are valuable additions to our existing energy storage and power distribution offerings that support our view of everything as a grid. We also closed our previously announced investment in HuanYu. HuanYu is based in China and provides a strong portfolio of products that will open up significant growth opportunities in our business throughout Asia Pacific. They make cost-effective circuit breakers and contactors and that give us access to Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets in Asia Pacific.And finally, last week we were pleased to announce the agreement to acquire 50% of Jiangsu YiNeng electric busway business in China. YiNeng's strong busway capabilities in China combined with YiNeng's broad portfolio of products will really position us well to participate in the high growth data center, industrial and high-end commercial segments and allowing us to pull through related electrical products. The HuanYu and YiNeng transactions, I'd also add, significantly expand our addressable market in China and in Asia Pacific, certainly allowing us to accelerate our growth rate in the region."
Own ETN at cheap levels. Currently sitting at above a 40 percent gain. This along with IR has been a big winner for me. Like ETN both for its dividend and for the capital gains. Staying long.
Close to 4% dividend; time to buy and hold for a year.
Your thoughts on Tripplite acquisition?
"From ClearBridge Financial""One secular consumer trend we are increasingly investing in is electric vehicles (EVs). In addition to owning Aptiv and NXP, leading component suppliers for EVs, we initiated a new position in the second quarter in Eaton, a global manufacturer of electrical, power management and hydraulics components and equipment. Eaton is a critical player in supporting the increasing electrification of the global economy with opportunities in areas ranging from utility generation and distribution infrastructure to EV charging stations, solar power systems and electricity supply for data centers. Eaton has transformed itself over the last decade from a heavy industrial company into a diverse set of businesses levered to the more attractive secular growth of electrification. We anticipate this focus will allow electrical products’ revenue to grow in the mid-to-high single digits and support margin improvement."""
"With a forward dividend yield of 3.12% and a payout ratio of less than 50% of cash flow, I'd certainly be a buyer at this price, except ETN already represents a hair over 10% of my net worth. My cost basis is just $37.42/share, so I'm quite pleased with ""my"" dividend yield of 7.8%"
9/10: Goldman Sachs adjusts ETN's price target to $186 from $182.

"Of 26 sell side analysts, 14 rate ETN a BUY, and 12 HOLD. Mediun price target is $108. Scott Davis from Melius and Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research have price targets of $122 and $120. Gordon Haskett raised his price target from $101 to $120 on 9/21. Combine this with the dividend yield and I'll be a buyer an every dip below $100."
Johnson Controls barely beats estimates and only reaffirms guidance while Eaton easily beat estimates and raised full year guidance. JCI is up 5%+ while ETN is down almost 2%. Something very fishy is going on.
Why the sudden price drop?
I think the new eMobility Segment will provide Eaton with great revenue. Estimated to a $33 billion market. http://www.eaton.com/us/en-us/products/emobility.html
Is this a case of simply running up too far too fast? ETN is getting beaten down far more recently then its competitors. Seems a bit oversold at this point.

Would like to get peoples opinion about when you think there will be a major correction in the markets and what do you think is a realistic price target for Eaton in 2022 is

ETN Is An Outstanding Companywith good management and carrying a Buy Rating. Revenues are good.
Mixed securities shelf offering....thoughts?

I work for a company that sells alot of Eaton products this company is growing fast
Market looking for solid firms that pay a reasonable dividend. Interest rates are headed down; ETN is headed up.
"Citing ""portfolio changes increasing the multiple,"" Citi analyst Timothy Thein has raised the price target on Eaton (NYSE:ETN) to $110 (from $98) and maintained a Buy rating onshares."
Where's the dividend? They have paid one since Dec. I thought they would have had an announcement to raise for March.
"This stock seems insane, doubled from 2019, yet barely dips during corrections. How did thier business change in 2020 to Warrent the massive gains?"
"At the current price of $60/share, the dividend yield is 4.87%. This could be an awesome buying opportunity for the buy-and-hold investor!"
"Could we see a dividend increase in 2020? Going back several years, it stays the same for a year then increases"
Is this company really worth twice as much as it was trading for just 2 years ago? This market truly is out of control. The correction is going to be very painful.
"Eaton Boosts Quarterly Dividend 4% to $0.76/Share, Payable March 30 to Shareholders of Record on March 16"
"Something Is Lacking HereThe Target Price is listed at $178. Deutsche Bank, Argus, UBS, and Credit Suisse in August all issued BUY RATINGS on ETN. This company is undervalued and should be closer to the TP."
"Seriously, whats going on here? Solid earnings and revenue and we open down ~3%??"
anyone buying here under $69?
