"Gotta live some where. Increase in population and increase in owning a home.This leads to manufactured home communities, like ELS & SUI have.Residents don't like rate increases, but they have very little option. Pay up."
Any guesses for the amount of the next dividend raise? Current dividend is $0.343/Q. My guess based upon nothing more than ~ 10% recent dividend increase >>>> new dividend $0.38/Q. I'm hoping at least.

In the Tucson area home sales have slowed. Rent goes up almost ever year; They have opened some of the ￼ amenities on a limited bases.. But may close them now tharT Az. Virus cases are up. There operating cost is down. So there profits are going to go up. I am not a hack. The stock is a good buy with there rent income you pay or you are out. Home sales should be a good time to buy.
Trailer parks are a Great investment considering our country will become completely trampled in the coming years. Also bitcoin.

They sure keep raising there rent every year They will be pricing themselves out of the market soon some people have left the park. Because of the price increase
Most of these properties are were the more affluent live. They have cut there services. There operating costs has gone down. They should offer A rebate. The rent money is flowing in at least in the park I am in. The home sales are down But that monthly rent comes still comes due
I sell mobile homes in Florida and I’ll tell you right now that the conference call is full of lies. August & September resales were dead. I had one prospective buyer tell me flat out “put me in any park ELS doesn’t own”. They’ve raised lot rents that most retirees can’t afford them. I know of one park they with about 400 units and 10% of them are for sale. And nothing is moving because the lot rent is near $800 a month for a mobile home. You can get a mortgage payment for that.
ELS is up 6.96% to 48.74
They have not cut there rent. If you can’t pay you are out. They have cut services with the virus pools closed hot tubs closed exercise room closed club house closed. There operation cost will be down. O I forget library’s closed. They should knock off a few bucks on the rent or a rebate just my thoughts
