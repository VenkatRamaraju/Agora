Ackman was terrible yesterday on CNBC. He lied and talked in circles. Any shareholder that votes for him is making a huge mistake. If he gets in he will fire 20% of the current staff. Vote NO for Ackman keep the existing team the team that gave you 202% gains over the last several years.
Bill Ackman Presentshttps://youtu.be/9rNchCv5xPI
"Normal volume today, it just mimicked the nasdaq as you can see. I have no advice for tomorrow but it the market goes up so will ADP."
"Ackman makes a long case sound like a short case. Seriously, he made it sound better on the short side that's why it's down today"
Automatic Data Processing is down 4.90% to 186.29
I would be a seller of ADP right here
Still waiting on my next stock split. I am surprised that the company has allowed this share price to go up so much without another split although I realize that they have to be conscious of the number of shares out on the market being traded. But they can resolve that by doing more by backs as well.
"Long Herbalife, Long VRX and now....... SHORT ADP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Want alerts on momentum stocks before the run happens? I have the solution…Google “LoinStockAlerts” and thank me later.
I have owned ADP shares for over 29 years and have an average return of over 13%. I have no complaints with such a nice return and will continue to support our current BOD. They are doing one hell of a job!!!!
Yawn. Another 52 week high hit 31 August 2018. No Ahh Haa to comment on it though:-(

The upside potential for ADP just got a whole lot more interesting. This is so frustrating trying to find trade ideas. I've subscribed to some email newsletters which helps me with new stock ideas. https://winningtradealerts.blogspot.com/ is the one i like best.
"My two children's college education is paid for with investment profits from Google, Apple, and ADP. I still have over 1000 shares of ADP stocks, and I will continue to hold them as long as the business fundamentals of ADP stay the course. It has been a lovely ride. Thank you so much Carols."

"Evidently Ackman doesn't think ADP does too bad because win or lose, he will keep the stock. He has lost big time on two --Herballife and some drug company so why does he think he can do something for ADP? He and Nelson Peltz should get together and start their own company."
Time to load up some .....holding it for a yr...much like my $ADP play last summer. Sold ADP to buy CBL and VIPS. Good luck
You will see some profit taking at the end of day.
Very low volume .... not a good sign... it’s to expensive at these levels. Sell and lock  in your gains cause this baby is going back to $168 - $169 for sure soon.
An over priced Hedge fund pumped stock. .. It lives in fantasy land.. DUMP IT.
Ackman has picked the wrong target to try and squeeze and drop for a profit. He is the worst kind of guy on wall street. ADP is a great company and outperformed by any measure. Bill go F yourself.
"Alight it’s in more than 180 countries already and backed by black stone . It’s value stock trading at very cheap price . It’s revival $ADP , Paycheck . Look at where they are right now . it’s  winner ."

Significantly less jobs added in July with respect to what economists predicted. Looks like market as a whole didn’t care much. Government will probably fudge the numbers like they have the past few months.
Anybody out there with a comment ??
"I love this company... but it has gone to fast on a market that in my opinion has gotten ahead of its self !! With Revenues of $15 billion and a market cap of $75 billion, a P/E of 31, some debt and at the top of the economic cycle... ?? This is not for me... so I just shorted this morning 2,000 shares at $174.15. Will cover around $170 which is what it was just a few days ago !! Sell ADP and lock  in your profits folks, it’s to rich. Take it from a guy that has been trading for over 20 years !!"

Lol .... wow where are all the smart ones here . I should have kept my short position and not listen to all you Bozos . Now you see Stock Trader nows a little about trading.
ADP makes more money than Bill Ackman so what gives him the idea he can improve anything. I think he needs to come off his high horse and realize he isn't a guru like Buffett.

Time for a split...
I shorted ADP again. $172.25
I am satisfied with the way ADP runs. They raise the dividend and make money. What is not to like?
I missed the earnings call. Did ADP discuss any plans to mitigate the impact from falling headcounts(revenues) from clients payrolls? Do they plan on making any costs cuts?
I have owned ADP and it has done just fine without Bill Ackman. Who the heck does he think he is? I make more money in the market than he does and I don't play with big money either. It is all my own money.

ADP has gone up $10 in ten days... it will retrace back to $165. It’s just a matter of time.
"Ackman has an over inflated view of himself. He doesn't pick pharmaceutical stocks well since he lost a ton of money on one. So what makes him think he can improve on a company like ADP? I am tired of these activists thinking they know more than the ceo's If they are so darn smart, why don't they start a company like ADP and drive it out of business by being so good? You won't find me voting for any activist. I think they like to see themselves on TV."
So is it that easy for ADP holders ?Another $2.00 up on Monday ? It was at $170.45 on the 14th and climbed all way to $176.91 in 4 days. I think it has gone up to fast... this Pig    is going down hard after earnings !!
Sorry Bill Ackman is trying to help longs. He is a loser.

It's a shame Ackman was'nt given the oppourtunity to turn this POS around
Ackman goes on Cramer and asks why ADP's revenue per employee is lower than Paychecks It was already explained that ADP has larger clients with many ADP products. Yet he pretends like its new information. The only conclusion I can come up with is that Ackman is not smart enough to understand the ADP business model. Why would you want a person like that on the Board.
Hey stock trader.. I'm going under. I fired off a few more. But again I'm stuck.

Ackman needs to get out of the way and let a good company go about its business.
Right back to ALMOST 40 TIMES earnings . Sorry. ITS OVER PRICED.
Lots of layoffs at ADP. Too many people off of payroll and ADP is not collecting payments
Very strange to see ADP dip at this time. ADP holds about $22.5B of customer's money at any given time. This is payroll money that ADP receives from their clients before they cut payroll checks. Unemployment is very low and the Fed is raising interest rates. A 1% rise of interest rates increases ADP's income by $225M
Need a 3 for 1 stock split
"I just got a call from bookkeeper, another pending debit for 18.12 .just 45 minutes they called and said my acc. is closed and security was looking into it. i'll see if bank catches it, there's a stop on all ADP stuff. Doug T"
ADP has done nothing this year to date. Flat. Only benefit has been the dividend. I sold half already and considering selling the rest. One can do better than ADP in this market.

"After listening to Ackman and thoroughly reviewing the presentation pack because I believe it is incumbent on us to consider other inputs, I voted the white proxy. I know many Ivy League graduates who are bad investors, not to mention all the graduates from the 'best schools' who gave us the financial crisis. What they often lack is common sense. One of Buffetts's sayings is that if you have a 150 IQ, you should sell 50 points before you invest. After 40 years of successful investing, I think there is merit to his point."

ADP company and management are exceptional. Congratulations on a good work!

Lower short term rates should also negatively impact ADP earnings going forward. They won't make any float on client funds.
