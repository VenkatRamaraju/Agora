Report suspected securities FRAUD to SEC. Type SEC complaint in a search window and the gov site comes right up.
It's time for a split like back in the good old days.
"ADP’s CEO Carlos Rodriguez sold over $8,000,000 in his stocks :https://www.google.com/amp/s/rivertonroll.com/news/2020/01/17/merit-financial-group-llc-purchases-shares-of-3494-automatic-data-processing-nasdaqadp.html/amp"
"ADP -1.7% as 8M-share block comes on offerJul. 1, 2019 4:47 PM ET|About: Automatic Data Processing,... (ADP)|By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is 1.7% lower after hours amid reports of an 8M-share block being offered through Jefferies.Those shares are being offered at $161-$163/share, or about a 2%-3.2% discount from closing price, Bloomberg reports.Some eight shareholders have at least that many shares to offer, Bloomberg notes, including Vanguard, BlackRock, BofA, State Street, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon and Wells Fargo."
"Wow didn't realize nobody talks about this stock, good company in a great business. Nice to have one piece of positive news today."
ADP has a great 5-year chart.
"My two children's college education is paid for with investment profits from Google, Apple, and ADP. I still have over 1000 shares of ADP stocks, and I will continue to hold them as long as the business fundamentals of ADP stay the course. It has been a lovely ride. Thank you so much Carols."
"On January 7th, 2020 ADP was trading at $167 and now at $174.88, I say it has gone up to fast. It will retrace back to $169 - $170 in a few days. And after earnings back to $165 - $167. Sell and lock  up your profits before its to late. This is the a very good short term short."
"11 Apr 2018: ""This dividend increase of 10% represents a return to shareholders of a portion of the benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" AND ""The Board of Directors anticipates consideration of another dividend increase in November 2018 consistent with ADP’s historical pattern""I love my dividend growth companies."
"With 30M unemployed, shouldn't this stock crater to below $100? I don't get it."
I was happy with the dividend increase article and missed the $5 billion buyback program. 6.66% of current market capitalization. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adp-authorized-purchase-5-billion-222000539.html
"I need help,2 months ago ADP started deducting close to 19.00 per month from my company account. I never heard of them,authorized this, and how did they get my account info? I only have 2 employees, I think I can write 2 cks. you can't contact humans, made contact on facebook, susposed to go to supervisor.gave my personal ph. num. That was the 23rd .Is this like wells fargo? can someone post a good ph. num? Doug T., Thanks"
"Futures not looking good... ADP will drop like a rock tomorrow. Smart money will be cashing  in and locking gains. It’s gone up to fast... it will retrace to $169 - $170 this week. ADP is a sell according to Zacks, they have it at a (4) SELL."
Automatic Data Processing reached an all time high at 223.16
Just shorted another 500 shares on margin... I am not afraid of this short position at all. Will cover at $170 and make some fast money 
"I bought this stock a loong time ago and so glad I did - since it has done nothing but make money for me over the years. For me it has been the well that never runs dry! I benefited from two splits and if it ever splits again - well, let's just say that would be a very good thing for me and for everyone else who holds this stock, especially those in the company's stock purchase plan."
CEO sold $13.9 million in shares. I’m still log.
Lower short term rates should also negatively impact ADP earnings going forward. They won't make any float on client funds.
Pershing Square Capital Management and Bill Ackman should be shut down and barred from security trading.
Every time recession is talked about this is headed 3-5 dollars lower.
"So, essentially, like they said last quarter, they wont fire anyone because its bad long term to do so, and thus they dont have too much variable cost that they can cut."
Still waiting on my next stock split. I am surprised that the company has allowed this share price to go up so much without another split although I realize that they have to be conscious of the number of shares out on the market being traded. But they can resolve that by doing more by backs as well.
has the company considered a stock split? ADP has historically traded in the range of $40-$80.
"Evidently Ackman doesn't think ADP does too bad because win or lose, he will keep the stock. He has lost big time on two --Herballife and some drug company so why does he think he can do something for ADP? He and Nelson Peltz should get together and start their own company."
