CHD never got the full value from its latest strong earnings report. It should be closer towards $80.What happened to that short seller with the fake report?
CHD is a well run company. They have a good track record of meeting estimates.
Amazing how short sellers can drive a stock down. CHD management seems to be very responsible.Looks like someone wanted to make a quick buck by creating this volatility.
Church & Dwight reached an all time high at 82.69
This will be $100 by end of August.
CHD is edging higher. Hopefully it will be able to break through $51 on heavy volume.
"CHD is at a crucial level now. It can base around $51 before powering higher. Among all of its competitors, CHD is well positioned to withstand the difficult macro conditions facing consumer staples stocks."
Church & Dwight is up 4.93% to 94.50
Good time to initiate a position in a quality name.
CHD reached an all time high at 70.28
CPB sell off pulls all CPG companies down.
Just out—-CDC recommends that people quit washing and reusing condoms. Seriously!That ought to help the stock price!
"I don't see this stock going down to 60 or back up to 80 in the near future. I wish the company would be more aggressive in their defense of Spruce's claims. BTW, I use their toothpaste (recommended by my hygienist over Crest), laundry detergent, and I own a water pick. In my local markets, their products have good shelf placement."
Devastating report here - CHD shares have up to 50% downside risk. Not a safe stock by any means. https://www.sprucepointcap.com/church-dwight-co-inc/

I have been holding this since. april.2019. didn't go anywhere. why?
"ALL CPG companies are negative today. PG. CLX,CL"
"No, this is not a ""sale."" It is still too expensive..."
"Go CHD, GO...!"
Been a long time since the last split.
when will it split?
Somebody buy this company and sell off the parts. Best way to create value here.Ichan give me a call.

I guess we'll have to go on the earnings call to find out what's going on at CHD.CHD usually beats so I'm a bit surprised.
where does this state when C&D announces- - -says nowhere in the summary- -and now doesn't say before or after the bell- - -have I mentioned how much I dislike this new format?
CHD reached a new All Time High at $67.26

"CHD looks too expensive right now. A year ago, it was reasonably priced. Now, not so much...."
NIce earnings call today.
Consumer Staples have had 3 trading sessions of positive momentum. Money is rotating into the badly beaten down sector.
"Do you think that the hundreds of thousands of investors, all over looked something that spruce says is so obvious? Unlikely. Nothing wrong with this company it’s a safe consumer staple"
they filed a law suit because they were just trying to shave a couple bucks ya rite they took the company to court not the other way around I love this
"PG merger talks, any truth to it?"
"Church & Dwight, is why I have over 4 million dollars. I work there for twenty seven years and CHD stock made me a rich man, my wife too. I was just a machinist in the maintenance dept, retired now since 2018. C&D, treats their people well, good pay and conditions. You want a good solid stock, invest in CHD. Since 1846 to NOW, how can you beat that?"
CHD reports earnings next week and I'm expecting good numbers. The stock may return to its 52 week highs.
CHD was one of the few gainers today. Nice to see that this was a safe haven.
Carl should have covered when it dropped 10% but instead now the downward trend has reversed. Poor carl is going to lose bad.
Church & Dwight is down 4.97% to 69.15
"I did backtesting of this stock on Portfoliovisualizer.com and realized an investment of 10K in the year 2008 would have become 65K today and if invested in the year 1998, it would have become 320K.I don't find any consumer staples stock that has this kind of returns. Is this is a hidden gem? Not even PG or 3M or Kimberly clark have this kind of returns. I took positions recently in this one. How is this stock different from other consumer staples?"
Long on CHD and got in 1.5 years ago. Total rev for 2019 is 4.5 billion and stock now is 94$. Proctoer and gamble total rev is 69 billion approximately for 2019 year. PG is 130$. I don't understand the CHD stock price justfication. How can it be so high with those kind of earnings. PG is way undervalued compared to CHD.
CHD reached a new All Time High at $66.05
have u seen at home if not u should check it out cuz that's the future of this stock
About time for a split again?
CHD should meet or exceed estimates. Management is very conservative and CEO is an accountant.
Sure sucks when the #s are good and the stock price goes down.
Is anyone else surprised that the zicam purchase didn't move the stock price?

CHD is a solid company. It's a mini P&G but has performed better. CHD is close to moving higher and has been basing for a while.
CHD beat on Revenue and EPS. Excellent. I'm looking forward to the earnings call.
CHD is going to 80 BIG MOVE GET IN NOW GOING TO 80 6 points up
"Great stock to own long term. Think, this will go to it's 52 week lows soon. Consumer staples haven't done well this year."
Fallen 8.00 for no reason . At min. It’s got an easy 4.00To make quickly
Note to Matt Farrell. Don't report disappointing numbers on Halloween. It's not funny.
CHD reached a 52 Week low at 63.37
Sector rotation. People feel that things are good again and leaving the defensive stocks.I wouldn't be so quick to do that. CHD is long-term for me. A slow and steady rise is what I want. What will CHD be trading at in 10 years? Not Monday. My biggest fear is that a larger international player will make a bid on CHD. I don't want that.Buy and Hold for the very long-term. Hopefully never having to sell any shares until retirement.
next support level is at 65...
"From page 28 of their Mar 31, 2018 10Q:""In the first quarter of 2018, the Company purchased 4.1 million shares for $200.0, of which approximately $110.0 was purchased under the evergreen share repurchase program and approximately $90.0 was purchased under the 2017 Share Repurchase Program.""Buybacks can help.. the 2017 Share Repurchase was $500M (I believe)."
CHD is down about 10% ytd. Does this make sense?
"Terry Smith, one of the most lauded fund managers here in the UK has just last month added CHD to his portfolio. You can watch his shareholder annual meeting at www fundsmith dot co dot uk /tv - the video is 1hr27mins but well worth the watch across his whole portfolio for which CHD is the latest addition."

"Mars, it's not so much about share count, but amount of funds you invest in a company. I would do at least $3,000.00 worth, so maybe (34) shares (35)......this amount will help your Dividend reinvest faster."
My Doc recommended their product Stelimar to avoid Covid-19. Just saying!
Good price for CHD to buy back some shares. 13+% below the 52 week high.CHD is right around the mid-point from the 52 week low.

Got a contract signing and only looking up! Im in the accumulation stage. :)"
CHD has room to run higher. It needs to clear resistance of $51.
Check Spruce Point's record on shorting. Nothing to worry about here. I am pretty sure they drive the price down and then go long. Otherwise they would be out of business.
CHD is knocking on another technical area of resistance. If it can break through on heavy volume it has room to run.
CHD is up 5.24% to 65.22
Good numbers in an uncertain world. Long-term hold.
HAY BULLISH ON CHD 75 to 78this week watch and see
Church & Dwight is down 17.02% to 52.52
It is holding its ground at 95$ very well. I bought it early 2019. stock didn't go any where until a month ago. I was almost thinking of selling it. glad I didn't
I see buying opportunity
CHD is up 5.01% to 48.65
does trade tarrifs effect this company
Strong technical breakout today. Quadruple Top Breakout. $53 is the next area of resistance.
CHD upgraded on Monday and no effect.
CHD is going to 75 get in now or your going to miss the rally
CHD is up 5.12% to 63.39
does trade war effect this stock?
Lots of washing machines being bought in emerging markets.CHD has the detergents for these new customers - in brands but more importantly price points.This is along term trend and a great runway for CHD.Watch how they discuss their international growth.
"CHD IS GOING TO 80 hold on the market is going up 500 points if you don,t get in now or your going to miss out"
CHD needs to surpass $51 . That has been the barrier.One of the few consumer stocks to beat on top and bottom lines. They are holding any increase for the outlook in the back pocket for insurance. Some selective price increases will really help too. It's time for all the Staples companies to pass on the higher logistic and commodity costs to consumers and preserve margin.
When will the stock split?
CHD releases earnings this week. Let's hope they defy the odds and report good numbers.
How low will it go?
Church & Dwight is down 4.92% to 86.05

why did it drop today?
Great last 6 months for CHD.
CHD beat. I hope the stock gets rewarded.
It looks like CHD has support around $70. That should limit downside risk.
CHD has been trending higher. Over 80% of its revenue is domestic and less affected by the strong dollar.Consumer staples is a beaten down sector and there may be some speculators buying in.
Anyone buying here?
This is a solid company with fantastic management. Where is Buffet? With his sense of humor he would love a condom company.
this stock is o e of the most shorted stocks in the market. It is such a good short that cnbc did a special on firms that are short it. I have shorted it since 75 and will continue to do so. So please buy more today Jack the price up so I can get in at a better price... thank u
CHD is on sale today. The stock is a long-term hold.Today it had a stumble but I'm sure they'll address the problem. Remember all the employees have a vested interest in the success of the company.
CHD reached a new All Time High at $61.95
CHD should report good earnings tomorrow. They have been consistent.
"it's funny every article yahoo post bought this company is negative. puts are real cheap guys u should add some protection, I mean that I dont want anyone to lose money, and this stock just doesn't act rite it's going down"
