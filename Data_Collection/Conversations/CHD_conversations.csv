I see buying opportunity
Carl should have covered when it dropped 10% but instead now the downward trend has reversed. Poor carl is going to lose bad.
Good price for CHD to buy back some shares. 13+% below the 52 week high.CHD is right around the mid-point from the 52 week low.
"Maybe down today but the numbers were good, and that's what counts."
CHD is a well run company. They have a good track record of meeting estimates.
"Do you think that the hundreds of thousands of investors, all over looked something that spruce says is so obvious? Unlikely. Nothing wrong with this company itâ€™s a safe consumer staple"
CHD is a solid company. It's a mini P&G but has performed better. CHD is close to moving higher and has been basing for a while.
"This isn't just a long term hold, it's a lifetime hold."
when will it split?
Just noted this company. What do they produce?
CHD is on sale today. The stock is a long-term hold.Today it had a stumble but I'm sure they'll address the problem. Remember all the employees have a vested interest in the success of the company.
"Mars, it's not so much about share count, but amount of funds you invest in a company. I would do at least $3,000.00 worth, so maybe (34) shares (35)......this amount will help your Dividend reinvest faster."
Church & Dwight is up 5.49% to 71.84
When will the stock split?
Strong technical breakout today. Quadruple Top Breakout. $53 is the next area of resistance.
My Dad worked there for over 40 years and always said it was one of the most reliable stocks there was.
Amazing how short sellers can drive a stock down. CHD management seems to be very responsible.Looks like someone wanted to make a quick buck by creating this volatility.
Good time to initiate a position in a quality name.
"I did backtesting of this stock on Portfoliovisualizer.com and realized an investment of 10K in the year 2008 would have become 65K today and if invested in the year 1998, it would have become 320K.I don't find any consumer staples stock that has this kind of returns. Is this is a hidden gem? Not even PG or 3M or Kimberly clark have this kind of returns. I took positions recently in this one. How is this stock different from other consumer staples?"
Anyone buying here?
Sector rotation. People feel that things are good again and leaving the defensive stocks.I wouldn't be so quick to do that. CHD is long-term for me. A slow and steady rise is what I want. What will CHD be trading at in 10 years? Not Monday. My biggest fear is that a larger international player will make a bid on CHD. I don't want that.Buy and Hold for the very long-term. Hopefully never having to sell any shares until retirement.
CHD reports earnings next week and I'm expecting good numbers. The stock may return to its 52 week highs.
CHD should meet or exceed estimates. Management is very conservative and CEO is an accountant.
Note to Matt Farrell. Don't report disappointing numbers on Halloween. It's not funny.
they filed a law suit because they were just trying to shave a couple bucks ya rite they took the company to court not the other way around I love this
Long on CHD and got in 1.5 years ago. Total rev for 2019 is 4.5 billion and stock now is 94$. Proctoer and gamble total rev is 69 billion approximately for 2019 year. PG is 130$. I don't understand the CHD stock price justfication. How can it be so high with those kind of earnings. PG is way undervalued compared to CHD.
Check Spruce Point's record on shorting. Nothing to worry about here. I am pretty sure they drive the price down and then go long. Otherwise they would be out of business.
What is a good number of shares to buy?
Good numbers in an uncertain world. Long-term hold.
Is anyone else surprised that the zicam purchase didn't move the stock price?
"Church & Dwight, is why I have over 4 million dollars. I work there for twenty seven years and CHD stock made me a rich man, my wife too. I was just a machinist in the maintenance dept, retired now since 2018. C&D, treats their people well, good pay and conditions. You want a good solid stock, invest in CHD. Since 1846 to NOW, how can you beat that?"
It is holding its ground at 95$ very well. I bought it early 2019. stock didn't go any where until a month ago. I was almost thinking of selling it. glad I didn't
"I don't see this stock going down to 60 or back up to 80 in the near future. I wish the company would be more aggressive in their defense of Spruce's claims. BTW, I use their toothpaste (recommended by my hygienist over Crest), laundry detergent, and I own a water pick. In my local markets, their products have good shelf placement."
CHD reports tomorrow. We need good numbers.
CHD never got the full value from its latest strong earnings report. It should be closer towards $80.What happened to that short seller with the fake report?
"I have many years until retirement, but plan to ride this horse all the way there."
CR Brands has signed a license agreement with Church & Dwight Co. to launch ARM & HAMMER Fruit & Vegetable Wash. It safely eliminates more than 90 percent of pesticide residue* while also washing away wax and soil. The product will launch in retail stores in Q1 of 2019
I guess we'll have to go on the earnings call to find out what's going on at CHD.CHD usually beats so I'm a bit surprised.
"Terry Smith, one of the most lauded fund managers here in the UK has just last month added CHD to his portfolio. You can watch his shareholder annual meeting at www fundsmith dot co dot uk /tv - the video is 1hr27mins but well worth the watch across his whole portfolio for which CHD is the latest addition."
"CHD is at a crucial level now. It can base around $51 before powering higher. Among all of its competitors, CHD is well positioned to withstand the difficult macro conditions facing consumer staples stocks."
