"Back in my early 20's, decades before the internet, I met an old wise man in the local library. Told me always invest in companies with long term dividends, p/e of around 12. This was in days of going through hard copy at library. The premise still holds true....buy quality at low p/e with great dividend. Forty years of buy and hold have proved that kind, old gentleman 100% correct. good luck."
"I suppose everyone knows that Altria Group is a huge stock holder in the well known brewery Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD).MO owns 10% of BUD’s shares outstanding which right now result in for every MO share ($49,53) BUD (61,39) represents about $6,60 per MO share(!!!).(In comparison: Ste. Michelle Wine represented only $0,60 per MO share).My question: Does anyone know how much BUD (normally) contributes to Altria’s EPS and dividend? How does it look both historically and today? I mean, BUD hasn’t done very well in the stock chart for the past 5 years but MO has of course received some dividend but during the Covid-19 years BUD adjusted the dividend down sharply while MO is raising theirs.Do you guys out there know?"
.90 4.7% increase.
Do any of you longtime MO and PM shareholders really want to see them merge again? Unless they really make it worth it I'd rather keep both and keep collecting these great div checks every 3 months for the next 10 + years or so! I've been long for over 23 years and not looking to sell anytime soon!
56th dividend increase in past 52 years - #MO - smoke em if you got em.
I hope they announce .90 (or more) because I think that will pop the stock and trap a bunch of shorts as well as lock a bunch of day traders out unless they want to pay $ 50+.
MO now pays a 6.5% Yield at a $55 stock price.........
Dividend rate = 7.07%...after 4.7% increaseReuters reports that it will maintains a current price target of $54.68 for MO.
"I think I‘ve gotten myself some really low risk/nice value stocks with great dividend yield during this summer by seriously loading up on both BATS.L and IMB.L. I like Altria too so don’t get me wrong but I believe BATS and IMB have a little more value.I neither own a crystal ball nor tea leaves but I have patience, time and very satisfied if I can collect a 8-9% dividend yield on my money every year. Dividend growth would just be a welcomed bonus.A momentarily unfavored sector by the institutions won’t bankrupt a good profitable business, even less so those with stable and huge cashflows as tobacco companies do.Buffett once said something like; “it’s very difficult to know what something is worth but it’s very easy to know when there is value”. I’m definitely no expert in the tobacco business but I think I see some great value here. How about you guys... what do you think about the industry and the stock valuations right now?"
Solid increase that’s just 1.6 pp under the target payout ratio of 80% based on minimum guidance of $4.59
"Wow, even at $50 still 7.2% yield!"
It's time for our annual divy increase. Just give us the $$$. I will be happy with .16 annual
"Love my qualified, tax-reduced dividends. Better than getting taxed for short term capital gains."
MO @ 79% dov. coverage.Maintains 2021 numbers.Estimates EPS growth to 4%yearly. Recent $1.3-Bi.l. saleof wine biz. probably theprelude of 10+-pct. of beerbiz for $12+-bi. MO is WallStreets best...held safely bysmall and big time investors.
"big dividend coming soon, $50+!!!"
50.70 sp would still be a 7.1% divvy.
This dividend is huge now
"4 Reasons Philip Morris Could Buy Altria In A $300 + Billion Mega-MergerAug. 25, 2021 1:46 AMSummaryRecently Morgan Stanley noted that Philip Morris could achieve major benefits by acquiring Altria for $50 to $55 per share.Since the abandoned $200 billion merger in 2019, analysts have continued to believe such a deal made sense, and the current CEO of PM has left the door open for one.The benefits to PM investors from acquiring Altria would include vastly larger and more stable cash flows with which to accelerate its plans for a smoke-free and beyond nicotine future.The benefits to Altria investors include a 7.1% to 8.7% yield on today's price, a 50% to 85% premium buyout price, and a significantly faster-growing company with an even safer dividend."
"Does anyone know the dividend coverage ratio for MO? Not payout ratio, Dividend Coverage Ratio. I know anything under 1.0 is bad, just wondering what MO's is."
"Just remember, until the politicians stop the B. S with the hands out to pay for each states programs off MO s back OUR backs. They won’t merge we are in a safe place that’s why the divided before. Buy hold and grow old with big MO in you corner "
"Buybacks and price increases will keep the dividend coming, with yearly raises, into perpetuity."
Anybody here read the S.A. articles? I've done it for years and now get a message that I can't read the articles anywhere unless I pay.
Hold BUD until the SP appreciates
"no reason to increase divi right now. use the cash for as much buy back as possible while share price remains low. reduce float, longs hold strong, and after buybacks complete this cash cow will have plenty in the revenue stream to up, up, up divi. most efficient use of cash right now considering unusually high divi due to low share price. MO needs to reduce float, which forces share price up and lowers divi. no objection."
What took them so long to declare the dividend.?I expected 90¢ (3.60 annually) and got exactly that.All is well that ends well.
Altria still has plenty remaining in their buyback reserves from the previously announced buybacks plus the capital from the sale of the wine business. I think we’ll hit .91 a quarter on the divvy. A good balance between buybacks and dividend payout is what we’ll likely get imo. I hope I’m right
New dividend 3.60 
"SP went down after investors piled in before last ex-div date. Bashers rubbed it in by saying we lost a whole year’s dividend. Well, now we’ve added the annual dividend back on to the SP. This is a prime example of why many bashers should not be taken seriously. I personally loaded up on the dip. GL to all."
"DB, K and Anonymous thanks for your post. You are now the best number 1, ""contra-indicator""."
I love it when articles say this is not in a buy zone. Gives me more time to accumulate at a discount.
"Is MO’s balance sheet info correct on here?I thought previous quarter they had far less debt, more cash and a more favorable debt/equity with no unusual activity.￼This looks a little worrisome? .72 current ratio, 855 debt/equity? Less than $2B cash, $28B debt? I could have sworn I had seen $5B cash and ~$15B debt previously with a debt/equity ratio of 96."
"Big Mo, Big Div, Big Beef"
"Altria Group Inc. (MO) said Thursday its board of directors approved a 4.7% dividend increase to 90 cents a share. The quarterly dividend is payable on Oct. 12 to shareholders of record as of Sept. 15. The new annualized dividend rate is $3.60 a share, the maker of tobacco products said. Altria has increased the dividend 56 times in the past 52 years, the company said. Shares of Altria edged higher Thursday and have gained around 19% this year, matching the S&P 500 index performance."
The best buy and hold there is been here a long time with MO but it always comes through for 2 reasons pricing power and divi! A true cash cow!
Based on MO's projected earnings the dividend @80% should be $3.68. Almost a 7% increase. Deliverance is tomorrow. I'm tired of expecting less from overpaid executives.
Very happy with the raise.
Guessing DB will cover at $52 or so. He's not the brightest person on this board . Does he not realize the Bud stake can be monetized in October?
For those who have additional holding in our companion smoke companies:BTI pays tomorrow: 0.73453 cents a share/8.07% div. rate DRIP DRIP DRIP!
"Breaking News: MO is not a buy after dividend increase says IBD. Hey IBD, give it up. You've posted the same BS long enough."
"DB, K and Anonymous were all calling for a dividend cut if not an outright elimination. These three are actually the same person. Hope they are enjoying their disastrous short position. Paying daily interest and now, an even higher dividend."
