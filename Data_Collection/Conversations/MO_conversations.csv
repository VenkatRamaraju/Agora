.90 dividend. Unexpected.
How long is the government going to take with this JUUL FTC case? It was over a month ago...
Where is the dividend raise?Is BOD too busy to get it done?
"Interesting watching some here waiver on MO one day, say they are going to retire off of it the next, etc."
Guessing DB will cover at $52 or so. He's not the brightest person on this board . Does he not realize the Bud stake can be monetized in October?
.90/share. WOW. NICE.
"Wow, even at $50 still 7.2% yield!"
Still cheap enough to accumulate
"Who was it that said that a dividend raise to $ 3.60 would send us into the 50's for good?Oh, that was me. Carry on !"
We should MOsey over to the $49's tomorrow!
What took them so long to declare the dividend.?I expected 90¢ (3.60 annually) and got exactly that.All is well that ends well.
"#4 on Insider Monkey’s best stocks yielding over 5% as ranked by hedge funds.One thing that caught my eye in particular is a MS analyst with $110 price target??I mean I’ll take it, but I think $60-$70 is more inline with performance.￼"
.90 or $ 3.60 woo hoo!!!
MO Dividend hit all my accounts ...DRIP and received a ton of new Altria stock! Expect a nice bump up with new dividend announcememt = .90 from .86. or about 4+%.We are also looking at some type of stock buy-back program ($1 to $2 Billion based on BOD approval) so dividend increase somewhat tempered.

This is a gift.10 years from now when marijuana is federally legal this will blow the roof off
just give me my dividend increase.
"Well Boys, we are coming down the backstretch. The dividend increase is imminent."

What are you drinking? This is going to be anywhere from a 2000 to 4500$ pay raise for me. I'm about to have lunch (fish and chips) with a Milk Stout brew-doggie.

56th dividend increase in past 52 years - #MO - smoke em if you got em.
I can feel it coming.
Looking at the bull flag on the 6 mo chart. Looks like it has potential to spike to $55
Dividend rate = 7.07%...after 4.7% increaseReuters reports that it will maintains a current price target of $54.68 for MO.
"Some of you may remember PAX labs spun off JUUL labs back in 2017. Both companies had cutting edge technologies in cannabis and nicotine delivery systems. PAX is still a popular cannabis use devise to this day. In the fall of 2018 the FDA declared a “teen vaping epidemic” and JUUL was the culprit. IMO if the FDA says in the fall that JUUL can stay in business, JUUL will have to re-brand itself to be successful just like Philip Morris USA did changing to Altria Group. I’m willing to bet JUUL R&D division is very busy."
Billy told me the increase would be to $.90 a quarter.
looking at this stock for my money over the next 3 years.. would love to hear people's views
Altria Halts IQOS Expansion After British American Tobacco Wins Patent Infringement Ruling
I don’t get why this stock is flat. Great Earnings report. Prospects of Dividend increase. Game-players?
"SP went down after investors piled in before last ex-div date. Bashers rubbed it in by saying we lost a whole year’s dividend. Well, now we’ve added the annual dividend back on to the SP. This is a prime example of why many bashers should not be taken seriously. I personally loaded up on the dip. GL to all."
I’d rather see a modest div increase and more buybacks since their stock price is low relative to historical value. Not sure how everyone else feels.
"Let's see what the nay sayers have to say in a month or so when MO increases the dividend once again as it has year, after year, after year for the 3rd quarter."
This dividend is huge now
Who is Schumer to decide Mom and Pop out-fits should control marihuana (50s spelling) and not Big Tobacco? Quality control and efficiency would favor Big Tobacco. Better for the consumer.
"I'm 33, new to investing, so please offer your advice. I like the idea of dividend stocks.... should these be in my tax deferred Roth IRA? Or my individual tax'd account? Also, do you all reinvest the dividends into the stock or deposit them into your core account? Any advice please thanks in advance."
I hope they announce .90 (or more) because I think that will pop the stock and trap a bunch of shorts as well as lock a bunch of day traders out unless they want to pay $ 50+.
Now I wait for the PM divy raise very early September. $$$$$$
"MO flirted with 48.00 today, I’m looking for something near 50.00 after earnings. Any thoughts?"
The pricing power here is intrinsic. It doesn't depend on anything. MO could double their prices tomorrow and lose virtually no business. It's an amazing phenomenon.
Not much of a move after hours. What else does wall st want. Geeze lol
"At the expected dividend raise to $ 3.60, that's a 6.5% Yield at a $55 stock price.I see $ 55, at minimum, this year."
"""""The"" day is now ""To""day! $0.91!"
IQOS rollout halted
"My two cents-this is an anti ESG position- all it does is pay its shareholders who have no issues with Tobacco stocks. In the next six months, there will be fears of regulation, and there will be a hiccup in price (which most likely will be a buying opportunity). If you like large dividends (without the REIT volatility), this is a good investment to buy and hold (if you can stomach the regulatory risk). I write covered calls against it, own 2000 shares, and have DEC calls @45 which are in the money (should yield 11%). I remember 1998-1999, the current market reminds me of this..... things got ugly then. Google Jeremy Grantham for hid thoughts."
"OUCH! Dow to 36,000 MO to $36.00 . Oh the poor MO BAGGIES!!! LOL"

"Comment on SeekingAlpha that is 100% correct and funny at the same time...""Altria's current leadership team is incompetent. They spend more time worrying about social justice issues than worrying about the business. Over the last five years, the stock is down close to 40% in the greatest bull market in history. PM needs to take this company over and change the culture back to its winning ways. Altria is the only tobacco major that does not have a winner in the innovative products space. They refuse to release the sales figures for On! but dance around this by saying ""how many stores it is in distribution"" during their earnings calls. IQOS is a winner but they are rolling it out at a snail's pace due to the profit-sharing agreement with PM and the worry of cannibalizing current Marlboro consumers.""""ZYN (Created in house by Swedish Match) = WinnerVuse (Created in house by RJ Reynolds) = WinnerIQOS (Created in house by PM) = WinnerAltria strategy: Buy second-rate companies and rebrand them, throw a bunch of money at them and pray that it works = Lazy Management"""
Altria said it expects the transaction will close in the second half of the year and plans to use the cash proceeds for additional share repurchases.
"i did sneak in under the wire to pick up 10,000 shares on margin at 49.80 yesterday. was touch and go, but sometimes better to be Lucky than good. margin interest rate 3.75 and tax deductible. divi 7.2. price appreciation. hmm, no brainer."
"4 Reasons Philip Morris Could Buy Altria In A $300 + Billion Mega-MergerAug. 25, 2021 1:46 AMSummaryRecently Morgan Stanley noted that Philip Morris could achieve major benefits by acquiring Altria for $50 to $55 per share.Since the abandoned $200 billion merger in 2019, analysts have continued to believe such a deal made sense, and the current CEO of PM has left the door open for one.The benefits to PM investors from acquiring Altria would include vastly larger and more stable cash flows with which to accelerate its plans for a smoke-free and beyond nicotine future.The benefits to Altria investors include a 7.1% to 8.7% yield on today's price, a 50% to 85% premium buyout price, and a significantly faster-growing company with an even safer dividend."

"Back in my early 20's, decades before the internet, I met an old wise man in the local library. Told me always invest in companies with long term dividends, p/e of around 12. This was in days of going through hard copy at library. The premise still holds true....buy quality at low p/e with great dividend. Forty years of buy and hold have proved that kind, old gentleman 100% correct. good luck."

Well I think the majority of us believe the dividend increase will be 4 cents to .90 a quarter. I would love for @M's prediction to come true with it being raise to $.96! That would be REALLY nice LOL!I guess we will all just have to wait about 1 more month here to find out. Thanks to all that commented. This was fun. Much more fun than other message boards I'm on where people are just going off on each other .
I hope IQOS is not another disaster like Juul. I’ve been waiting forever for this product to hit the masses in the US. What happens if they lose the court battle? Do both PM and MO get crushed?
Getting darn close to mid August and I want my dividend raise. Is it really that much work for the BOD to get it done that they need to wait for the wee hours of the month to get it done?Sheesh!
Altria still has plenty remaining in their buyback reserves from the previously announced buybacks plus the capital from the sale of the wine business. I think we’ll hit .91 a quarter on the divvy. A good balance between buybacks and dividend payout is what we’ll likely get imo. I hope I’m right
All of a sudden MO is a buy again lol
Sure looks like it's being accumulated recently. I just don't see how it stays in the 40's after tomorrow's raise. I think it will be 50+ for good.
"Altria Group raises dividend by nearly 5% to 3,60 $ !!"
"Is MO’s balance sheet info correct on here?I thought previous quarter they had far less debt, more cash and a more favorable debt/equity with no unusual activity.￼This looks a little worrisome? .72 current ratio, 855 debt/equity? Less than $2B cash, $28B debt? I could have sworn I had seen $5B cash and ~$15B debt previously with a debt/equity ratio of 96."

Hopefully that fade and drop on closing doesn't mean that they're jacking up the dividend by only 2¢ like last year. It needs to be at least 4¢ just to be in line with revenue growrh.
Maybe DB should be an investor in KMB. I hear their sales are skyrocketing as a result of DB and people like him needing to buy Depends because they soul themselves every day MO doesn’t fall
If Buffett didn’t have to keepUp his wholesome image he would be building up a massive stake in MO.
MO stock price blowing whichever way the DOW blows. Love that constant dividend.
"There are many investors in this company who count on MO for their dividend as a source of income. That being said, I hope that there will not eventually be a merger with PM, because after the last attempt MO shareholders were about to take a hit on their shares. Unfortunately, I think at some point merger talks will begin again, once things begin to settle with the Juul investment. Good Luck Board!"

lets all have a smoke to celebrate !
Hahaha Blue Blood was put in his place when he claimed on XOM he had 3 IRAs with 9k XOM shares and was living of them at 48 years old...Then we told him you can’t get distributions at 48 and no way you could have 3 IRAs  He then muted many and deleted messages. MO good stock too
"So you lost 10% this year, then you had an inflated div distribution based on the CSM announcement, and that was lost next day and now you have a nothing sandwich earnings call with speed bump, get your $1 bump, which was taken away today. See you in 3 months, rinse cycle complete. Good luck in the poor house. Don't say I didn't tell you so, many, many times."
Imagine how much MO will drop when the Dow is down 300+. 30’s will be visited within 2 months
Every time I'm down i buy a tobacco company and relax
"Kinda odd, Fidelity reinvested on 7/7 @$46.95 even though it didn’t post to my account until yesterday morning. And the basis wasn’t visible until today (just the additional shares were visible yesterday).No complaints though. Cheaper than at any point yesterday."
there is absolutely no reason on the horizon why MO does not blow past 52 week highs and likely past 12 months projected share price of 54+/share. i have every nickel i can muster invested right now in MO.
"I normally bash MO management cuz I think they are horrible, but it appears that MO AND PM knew that patent situation was going to be a problem and therefore the reason that maybe MO was not aggressive with the IQOS rollout. Whenever a product design is changed, FDA needs to bless it, so for you longs out there, all is not lost, well, almost all is lost but it could be worse."
"If we can get above $48.94 this week, Mo will race to $50. I still say you can by right here and do very well over the next 6-12 months."
Inflation will eventually lead to a big market correction. MO a good place
MO @ 79% dov. coverage.Maintains 2021 numbers.Estimates EPS growth to 4%yearly. Recent $1.3-Bi.l. saleof wine biz. probably theprelude of 10+-pct. of beerbiz for $12+-bi. MO is WallStreets best...held safely bysmall and big time investors.
"no reason to increase divi right now. use the cash for as much buy back as possible while share price remains low. reduce float, longs hold strong, and after buybacks complete this cash cow will have plenty in the revenue stream to up, up, up divi. most efficient use of cash right now considering unusually high divi due to low share price. MO needs to reduce float, which forces share price up and lowers divi. no objection."
"I checked the dividend history, September seems to be a good time to raise the dividend (via MO MGMT). The market is so expensive and Tobacco stocks seem cheap....... but there are smarter investors out there than me....."
Come on get back above $48 again ;)

"Research Alert: CFRA Lifts Opinion On Shares Of Altria Group, Inc. To Hold From Strong SellBY MT Newswires— 11:55 AM ET 08/31/202111:55 AM EDT, 08/31/2021 (MT Newswires) -- CFRA, an independent research provider, has provided MT Newswires with the following research alert. Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:We increase our 12-month price target by $10 to $50, based on a '22 P/E of 10.4x and a steep discount to its 10-year mean forward P/E. We maintain our adjusted EPS estimates of $4.60 for '21 and $4.80 for '22. With favorable recent momentum indicators, including a rising relative strength rating and compelling yield of 7%+ on the recently-increased dividend of $3.60/sh (up from $3.44/share), we raise our opinion to Hold. Additionally, we think shares are benefiting from recent chatter suggesting the possibility of renewed interest in a merger with Philip Morris (PM 103 ****), although we view this as highly unlikely two years after their merger talks fell apart. While we continue to view regulatory risks surrounding the tobacco industry in the U.S. as significant, particularly the FDA's proposed ban on menthol cigarettes and cigars and possible action to reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes, the comment and rulemaking period could be lengthy and we expect legal challenges from tobacco companies.MT Newswires does not provide investment advice. Unauthorized reproduction is strictly prohibited."
"MO guided full year earnings guidance to $ 4.56 to $ 4.62. Even at the low end, it seems that $ 3.60 is almost guaranteed when they announce the dividend raise next month and $ 3.64 or $ 3.68 are certainly not out of the cards.#Gorrilla"
Esg is a fad until the next crisis. MO will be here strong and proud
"Time to send a search patrol out for DB, K and Anonymous . LOL!!!"
market lost 400pts currently and mo is only down .30 cents... bears don't celebrate this.. 400pt turned into -30cents... don't talk this isn't a win for u. the whole market got destroyed today and mo didn't take a big hit
Daytraders getting nowhere. This is a long game. Us investors getting nearly $ 4 of our investment back every year on this Stalwart. Same with XOM. Us longtermers CRUSH you little day traders.
Ok. Based on what Anonymous and DB have been saying and the $0.02 decline today I’m selling my position.....NOT!
"As always stated, a BROKEN and MiSMANAGED COMPANY always one SHOE DROP from a HUGE CORRECTION.

Games before dividend bump?
I’ve said to before and I’ll say it again. IMO this thing is going to trade relatively sideways until a FTC case outcome.
"Told you smart money would pack in before the next dividend. At $ 3.60 Dividend payout, the current price of $ 48 would yield a man 7.5%. Not too shabby. Like I said, MO's days of living in the 40's/share are numbered."
Didn't hear from K Friday. Guessing Friday was more negative money flow and short covering since it was up 97 cents. LOL
MO has the BUD lockup ending in October and has at least the amount of money in their back pocket as they lost on JUUL. So they can cancel the JUUL mistake (debt) out at any time after October. So pretend JUUL never happened and you have a very strong company with a long runway to keep paying and increasing the dividend. My opinion only.
"Hey ""K"" more negative money flow today?LOL"
The best buy and hold there is been here a long time with MO but it always comes through for 2 reasons pricing power and divi! A true cash cow!

Big MO has made us long timers wealthy. We are at the point where the sp doesn’t matter. We are living off the dividends without a care in the world. I recommend you of younger years hear my words. Buy high yield companies with solid revenue streams and REINVEST those dividends while you are still working. You will wake up one day and be amazed how wealthy you have become

"Time for the DB scorecard. His short position is down 6+ points, he has paid another month of interest and at least one dividend. How is that for a train wreck. YUK YUK YUK"
Good report. Poor reaction thus far.
"MOConsistent dividend raises drag the share price higher over time. At the projected $ 3.60 payout about to come, that's 7.2% at a share price of $ 50.....at $ 55, that's a Yield of 6.5%."
Interest rate is going to go up sooner than later and leading to selling growth stocks. Thus value will be in favor soon. MO is in good position
Awaiting the .16 annual dividend increase in the next few weeks ?
Very happy with the raise.
It's looking like they should have no problem announcing a raise in the dividend to at least $3.60 next month.
Philip Morris buying Altria is teed up by Morgan Stanley as possibility again.A hypothetical transaction at $50-$55 per MO share is seen as being modestly accretive given the current valuation differential between the two companies.

"I suppose everyone knows that Altria Group is a huge stock holder in the well known brewery Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD).MO owns 10% of BUD’s shares outstanding which right now result in for every MO share ($49,53) BUD (61,39) represents about $6,60 per MO share(!!!).(In comparison: Ste. Michelle Wine represented only $0,60 per MO share).My question: Does anyone know how much BUD (normally) contributes to Altria’s EPS and dividend? How does it look both historically and today? I mean, BUD hasn’t done very well in the stock chart for the past 5 years but MO has of course received some dividend but during the Covid-19 years BUD adjusted the dividend down sharply while MO is raising theirs.Do you guys out there know?"

Why not hold the beer company until its stock price goes up?
PM buys Vectura Group for $1.2 billion. MO sells Ste. Michelle Estates for $1.2 billion. Both deals announced on the same day before the US Market opens. What do you think they are trying to tell us?
Over $2.5 billion in buybacks remaining if the Wine Estate sale gets board approval for additional share repurchases
"I think I‘ve gotten myself some really low risk/nice value stocks with great dividend yield during this summer by seriously loading up on both BATS.L and IMB.L. I like Altria too so don’t get me wrong but I believe BATS and IMB have a little more value.I neither own a crystal ball nor tea leaves but I have patience, time and very satisfied if I can collect a 8-9% dividend yield on my money every year. Dividend growth would just be a welcomed bonus.A momentarily unfavored sector by the institutions won’t bankrupt a good profitable business, even less so those with stable and huge cashflows as tobacco companies do.Buffett once said something like; “it’s very difficult to know what something is worth but it’s very easy to know when there is value”. I’m definitely no expert in the tobacco business but I think I see some great value here. How about you guys... what do you think about the industry and the stock valuations right now?"
Dividend cut will become a reality Philip Morris buying Altria is teed up by Morgan Stanley as possibility again
"Tomorrow is Friday, expect the traders to take back what's left of the SP increase, just like they did with the SP pop from the phony timed CSM sales announcement right before dividend distribution. OH YEAH, you got poked on that one too........ you must like it!"
MO now pays a 6.5% Yield at a $55 stock price.........
Stone Cold MUTED!!
It's a strong sell at 50!
Announce after the close?
Great article on MO and MJ.https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2021/02/09/tobacco-giant-altria-is-pushing-marijuana-reform-on-congress-and-state-lawmakers/?sh=6b380a4f6041
Based on MO's projected earnings the dividend @80% should be $3.68. Almost a 7% increase. Deliverance is tomorrow. I'm tired of expecting less from overpaid executives.
"Think about this bagholders, the Dow has hit about 10 new ATH's in the last month or so and MO has done NOTHING. Just wait till the market pulls back. 100% Guarantee, MO is in the 30's. ZERO WORRIES"
Selling On! internationally. Should be good for revenue over time.
"It was always my understanding that stock prices are basically a function of delivering on current earnings estimates and expected future earnings. When I look at MO I see a pretty consistent history of executing successfully on both of these.They have been involved in litigation since the 1960s and keep coming out ahead. Their legal department seems to know when to fight and when to settle in a way that maximizes the performance of the company.In the meantime, they keep on doing what they have always done; reliably increasing earnings and dividends.If the company were measured on facts the share price would be way higher."
"I like the low price for accumulation, but it would also be nice to hold some gains…"
"Love my qualified, tax-reduced dividends. Better than getting taxed for short term capital gains."
The Marlboro Ranch was sold off by this time next year PM/MO will merge back together. It was in the works before the JUUL disaster it will happen and basically there will be 2 Tobacco company`s serving the world PM and BTI! stay long!
waiting for my .90 dividend announcement
Buy a stock that has a 50 year proven record for its current stock price and dividend. Great companies will always continue to perform such as #MO....willy-nillies need to trade it or go elsewhere. good luck
Solid increase that’s just 1.6 pp under the target payout ratio of 80% based on minimum guidance of $4.59
"MO just blew out earnings and IQOS had absolutely nothing to do with it. Ignore the noise if you have lots of shares, condolences if you don't."
Any thoughts out there about the upcoming Sept. 7th ruling on MO regarding the vaping business?
"DB, K and Anonymous were all calling for a dividend cut if not an outright elimination. These three are actually the same person. Hope they are enjoying their disastrous short position. Paying daily interest and now, an even higher dividend."
Getting very attractive.
"The company hasn’t completed their initial $2 billion in buybacks. The $1.2 billion transaction makes that $3.2 billion in buybacks. If I remember from the last CC, only less than $400 million was used for buybacks as of Q1, leaving about $2.8 billion remaining minus whatever was spent on share repurchases in Q2. Not bad."
"No luck reading SA articles on different device.Logged in, then logged out and cleared the cache. Logged back in and wasn't allowed to read any article. No way to read them when you are logged out, either.Dang."
"I sold all my REITs for $MO. Thats some serious conviction!!! When times get bad, addictions grow worse!"

"MO 7th in Insider Monkey’s “Top 10 stocks under $50.”The only one ranked higher I’d even consider swapping for is Pfizer.At any price, the only stock I’d consider swapping MO’s income for is Exxon (which I did own but was a small position that I just added to MO instead of MO into Exxon).Disappointed Viacom not on the list. There’s MO-type value but nowhere near MO’s dividend."
"Now, it's marching toward next goal, $51.5"
MO will announce $ 3.60 next Thursday and we will move over $ 50/share for good.
A 3.64 divvy would be 80% of expected minimum earnings.
"""Altria expects to use the net proceeds from the Ste. Michelle Transaction for additional share repurchases.Altria’s existing share repurchase authorization is limited to $2 billion; therefore, additional share repurchasesin connection with the Ste. Michelle Transaction are subject to Altria’s Board approval."""
.90 4.7% increase.
Where’s the DB with his consolidation at 36 gibberish?
People been effing with this stock the final minutes lately.
"I’m also in MO and ENB, but ENB is facing some regulatory headwinds with a government effort to close down one of its pipelines that has been operating without issues for decades.To counter the risk a little I move half my ENB holdings over to OKE. Similar dividend yielding company in a similar business, but without the current regulatory challenge."
Ok trying something different. I decided to buy today before earnings call tomorrow. I spent half of what I have in my account. Tomorrow I will spend the other half that way I won’t regret not buying before a beat and it goes green or a miss and it goes red.
run up to next ex divi date and price target of 54? what is the down side here.
"MO Baggies better be happy the markets are in stealth rally mode or MO would be down much more than 35 cents. OUCH! 36.00 when, not IF!!!! The bags getting a wee-bit heavier today. LOL"
"""As of June 30, 2021, Helix had broadened the U.S distribution of on! to approximately 105,000 stores,representing approximately 80% of total U.S. industry oral tobacco volume and 70% of U.S. cigarettevolume."""
"Even negative news can't bring PM down. New 52 wek highs today!! Just wish MO does the same, although I think $PM will outperform $MO over the next few years..."
"Look for MO to sell its restrictive shares in BUD in October and pay a large special dividend, pay down debt and buy back shares. It will be fun to watch DB squirm.LOL"
It's time for our annual divy increase. Just give us the $$$. I will be happy with .16 annual
New dividend 3.60 
who covers MO at Goldman?
"Mo selling the winery is a nothing burger. They weren't even intending on buying a winery but when they bought Skoal and Copenhagen (Grand Slam buys), the winery came along with it."
Dow at anothe ATH while MO struggles to hold a .02 gain. LOL. MO baggies in for a RUDE awakening. 36.00 is coming!!! GOTCHA!
"Buybacks and price increases will keep the dividend coming, with yearly raises, into perpetuity."
Been checking their website; no dividend announcement yet.
let the stock price stay low this week. come Friday the dividend get paid and to anyone that is a reinvestor what a great way to buy this stock at a low price.
How much cash do we make off of beer company ?
"Just remember, until the politicians stop the B. S with the hands out to pay for each states programs off MO s back OUR backs. They won’t merge we are in a safe place that’s why the divided before. Buy hold and grow old with big MO in you corner "
"Wishes:1. JUUL lawsuit win, eventual full ownership once legal issues are sorted2. ABI divestment3. ZYN acquisition4. PMI merger5. Monster Energy acquisition"
"Thank you for the dividend increase, was going to buy more, but IEP pays $8.00 share for the same $, over 14% yield"
"@Scott and anyone else confused on the news today. Per earnings call transcript, IQOS will “stay in” the current four state expansion markets including the heavily populated northern Virginia area (think DC) without expanding beyond that for now. FDA approval of IQOS as a RRP in the US will also have some weight in the case according to the transcripts. This will be tied up in court(s) for a while. I wouldn’t sell yet, long MO!!"
Negative money flow and the same repetitive pattern has returned.
I love it when articles say this is not in a buy zone. Gives me more time to accumulate at a discount.
"50/share MO was just celebrated with a Peanut Butter Milk Stout and some Shrimp Creole Tacos (One soft, one crunchy).See ya soon."
been a holder of this stock for years and no complaints
I am McBeef and MO is my noble steed. I shall ride ye olde dividends into early retirement
Value stocks will come back one day. They should be a part of any investor's portfolio. But not a very big part...
50.70 sp would still be a 7.1% divvy.
SELL rating to private clients issued by Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management this morning.
they will be able to get rid of bud stock if they want.....raised their div 5 percent even without any or muchcontribution from bud. cleaning up after the weed and vape problems. now pm in the news as a buyeras it was a couple of years ago.. and you have had a steady daily uptrend.....the trend is our friend!!so yeah...i think pm will take this on. why not?
"BUD will be sold next, JUUL lawsuit will be done, then PM + MO will happen and Gifford plus the diversity team will run the sanitation department while PM runs the business."
Anybody here read the S.A. articles? I've done it for years and now get a message that I can't read the articles anywhere unless I pay.
Bought another 1.000 $MO shares to my existing 5.150.
"Morgan Stanley thinks September 9th could be a big day for the tobacco sector due to an anticipated FDA decision.Analyst Pamela Kaufman points out that agency is scheduled to issue a decision on that date concerning ""Premarket Tobacco Product Applications"" from industry players.Kaufman expects favorable decisions for many of the big names like Altria.."
Where is DB?
"Market Chaos and MO barely budges. ""If you have lots of shares, you love MO. It's just that simple."
"On the other front, Josh promised to sell and move on when MO hits $52. Only $1.76 from that magic number! The next week or so will be really good!!"
Everything I'm reading on other sites says that there's a long runway to increase the dividend simply by increasing the price of cigarettes. and that the price is not high compared to places where they are much higher and people are still buying them. Couple that with massive buyback abilities and the net 5+ years looks stable.
New here. What is the ex dividend date. Thank you in advance.
Do any of you longtime MO and PM shareholders really want to see them merge again? Unless they really make it worth it I'd rather keep both and keep collecting these great div checks every 3 months for the next 10 + years or so! I've been long for over 23 years and not looking to sell anytime soon!
Juicy squeeze!
"Now nobody is saying that it is unproven that cigarette smoking causes health issues but, given the mentality of the anti-vaxxers, anybody who is smoking today is not going to quit because of a new report or health advisory. Basically, you can tell someone to quit smoking but they ain't listening. While you could make the argument that smokers are dying off, the whole anti-vax movement is probably a win for the tobacco industry as young people are being told not to believe science."
"Gonna be hard to keep the low end of the share price out of the 50's, longterm, if they raise the dividend to $ 3.60. $ 3.60 and a $ 50 BOTTOM is my call."
Approaching $52.59 = 52 week high.
I'll buy back at $35 pps
What does DB’s elevator operator say to him when he walks into the building and gets on the elevator?GOING UP!!!!!!
Say goodbye to the 40’s for good.
