I’ll be buying the dip in the morning! MO will be the replacement for the fixed income portion of my portfolio.. all that money leaving tech will be seeking yield and that’s one thing MO has
"The full year guidance has been raised , why it was down yesterday"
The 7.5% dividend alone is strong catalyst for upward trend stock price. Throw in a 3.5 billion stock Buyback commitment. Future looks bright. Buy Buy Buy !!!!!!!!
"Too many “investors” are short term oriented. Added to my position under 45. Solid dividend, forward P/E under ten. Ask yourself one question: is MO a $50 stock within two years? My answer is yes, at minimum. A total annual return of at least 12%+ is good with me."
"The thing I was looking for was what they were going to do with the BUD stake. Had they sold it, I would have seen it as a sign of desperation. They are keeping it because they are cool hand Luke. They increased the buyback without even selling bud. This is a gorilla. ON! doing well, also."
"Do U understand where this is going ?? Crons....REV is up, they've been buying back shares and are still doing it 90cents a quarter DIVY......Solid NON STOP CASH COW every day.....$70-$80 once Cannabis is legal in US 100%....collect the DIVY every quarter"
"Altria is one of a handful of Dividend Kings, who increased its dividend every year for more than 50 years, irrespective of any industry and/or market conditions. This speaks for itself. If you don’t need the principal and if you’re young enough, put your money, turn on DRIP and stop checking the share price every day. Altria has a moat in an industry that is here to stay for the foreseeable future, while also diversifying into adjacent categories that will grow. They’ll also throw 2.5 billions more into share buybacks, enabling future dividend growth, which is important in an inflationary environment. Keep calm and watch MO delivering for its shareholders."
"In July company said full year EPS would be $4.56-4.62. Through Q3 MO is at $3.52.Q1 was $1.07Q2 was $1.23Q3 was $1.22To make the full year number Q4 needs to be $1.04-$1.10. Things remain on track.Focus on the day if you wish, but all you do by following that strategy is create a buying opportunity for the patient and more mature amongst us."
"There are currently about 35M smokers in the US. By 2030 that number is expected to fall to 30M-31.5M.You have at least several decades left, and that assumes that none of the alternate product strategies materialize into something."
Not surprised it's going down. Who needs a steady 7.5% dividend when TSLA doubles every year ? That's what passes for wisdom in today's market...
"Revenue good, forecast good, dividend solid. What’s not to like?"

"Classic day of shaking the tree and getting the weak leaves to fall off.Solid uptrend of continued earning and dividend growth. Full year estimate reaffirmed with lower end raised. JUUL apparently no longer an “if” but a “when”. AB InBev +10% today. Stock buyback increased.Maybe I’m missing something, but I just don’t see the demise of MO that all the naysayers keep posting.If you buy and hold for the long term this is a solid place to be."
"@DB earnings growth of ~2.5% vs est of -5.9% in the midst of a supply chain problem and continued pandemic issues isn’t anywhere near enough of a miss to get overly excited about.The fact that MO actually grew, while less than estimates, means that the dividend remains safe and your doom & gloom predictions will still remain a fantasy."
"Guidance raised. Buybacks increased. BUD up premarket. Definitely a chance of finishing green. Downrampers want you caught up in the noise, but at the end of the day, there is still 5-6% growth expected with plenty being returned to shareholders with no dividend reduction."
"If all is so dark then why did MO affirm its full year estimates and raise the lower end?The full year earnings estimates are now $4.58 to $4.62, which is 5%-6% growth for the year.Since 2016 the quarterly earnings have been as follows:2016: 0.72, 0.81, 0.82, 0.682017: 0.73, 0.85, 0.90, 0.912018: 0.95, 1.01, 1.08, 0.952019: 0.90, 1.10, 1.19, 1.022020: 1.09, 1.09, 1.19, 0.992021: 1.07, 1.23, 1.22, tbdThe trend is UPWARD! MO pays dividends based on a target of 80% of earnings. The trend shows conclusively that the dividend is safe.Earnings growth is not like a tech stock, but no tech stock pays out 80% of earnings, and many tech stocks are actually still not earning anything.Washing out the soft hands is all that is going on today. It’s overdone, as is demonstrated by the continued growth in earnings."
"Bloomberg-Cigarette sales in the U.S. climbed last year amid the Covid-19 pandemic, marking the first annual increase in two decades.Major manufacturers sold 203.7 billion cigarettes in 2020, up from 202.9 billion the year prior, according to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s Cigarette Report."
"MOMUTE TonyD, the guy that claims he works for Altria. 14 days ago he was on the MU board saying he worked for Nvidia.tonyd14 days agoReplied to a reaction$MU conversationYes I write recipes for these chips. I switched company after company. Just like Infineon this is going to drop. Too expensive to make DRAM. Now I work for Nvidia and very happy. I am sure you know DRAM. It takes so many days to make, the tooling is expensive. Dram is a dying chip. When it was expensive through the nineties and to early 2008 it was great. The price is just dropping now. I wish Micron would change their business to other chips so I could move back home."
"MO shares worth $1 Billion more today due to the increase in BUD share price. If you don't want to own MO then don't. Otherwise I thank the players who sold MO off today as it gave me the opportunity to add to my position. That's one reason I don't DRIP all my MO dividends and save funds for a later date. Today, that strategy worked and I save about $4 per share from when it would have reinvested. Thanks again. And yes I know the piece of paper called a stock certificate is being valued lower than it was in 2017. Being the owner of that piece of paper has paid me very well. Take care."
$3.5B in share repurchases authorized to be completed by the end of 2022! That’s a total shareholder yield north of 11%!!! Mind blowing when you consider the 10-yr is yielding 1.5%!!!
