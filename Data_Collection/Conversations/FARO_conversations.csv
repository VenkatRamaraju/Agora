"Down 8% on quarterly. I got mine at 40, didn't realize how much it's gone up. (and then partially retraced)GSA overcharging issue is frustrating, you would think any modern company would have enough checks and balances to spot such things before customer pays their bill. Although it was caught after the fact, at least it was they who caught it rather than the customer discovering they'd over paid. Anyway, overall the company seems to run the business well, so I guess one mistake can be forgiven. Usually a stock I own that moves 8% in one day I might want to"

This is rare short opportunity. It will go back to 47 and there won't be a bounce back. No CEO from heaven or hell can fix this company.

Looks pretty undervalued to me. Let buy some shares!
"The most important statement and what should be stressed tomorrow when discussing results is this: ""Looking ahead, we continue to see strong fourth quarter demand indicators and as revenue returns to pre-pandemic levels, we look forward to demonstrating the operating leverage we have built into the business over the past two years."""

Up 19% on a new CEO? I saw this shoot up on my OLB account and figured they must have gotten a buyout offer or something. Time to check their numbers and decide whether to take profits or aim for bigger gains.

"Deal or no deal? Should I take profits at 56? Looking at their numbers they still appear relatively cheap. I primarily focus on enterprise value to gross annual profits ratio which is about 3.5, and that's fairly low for a tech stock. On the other hand, I'm retired and when I've ot a nice profit on a stock it's tempting to take it. Only one logical course of action: Sell some and keep some."
