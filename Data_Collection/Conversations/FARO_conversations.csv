"After hours FARO down over 9%. I'll buy some more tomorrow if it's still that cheap. The quarterly was generally pretty positive in terms of their sales, and it sounds like there is a plausible explanation for the quarterly loss, namely, spending associated with efforts to grow the business. This is one of the few tech stocks that still has the potential to go way up if they are clicking on all cylinders at some point down the road."

"Many techs have gone up a lot in the last 6-12 mo but not the case for FARO. I have wound up tending to go in and out of it and that happened to work well for me, but I prefer to be a longer term investor.When I look at FARO right now I like what I see. Strong balance sheet, strong sales growth. Profit is poor which seems to be what's holding the stock down. But it appears to me that the depressed profits are primarily a side effect of their aggressive efforts to grow the company. And it sounds like the growth potential is pretty good. In the conference call the discussion of construction as a newer market that has lots of untapped potential sounded pretty positive to me.A lot of tech companies I consider very good ones have stock prices that are awfully high right now. Tech has always been where I did the best investing wise and I am only down to a few remaining tech stocks in my portfolio right now, so I am thinking I am going to up that count by one by getting back into FARO. It seems to me their growth cycle could evolve into a strong profit cycle that could propel the stock within a year or two to up to 2x what it is now. If the booming macroeconomy cools off then maybe it won't be a great investment but it should have a lot less downside than the techs that have gotten very toppy, and a strong balance sheet like FAROs always helps reduce the downside potential as well."

This is rare short opportunity. It will go back to 47 and there won't be a bounce back. No CEO from heaven or hell can fix this company.

"Deal or no deal? Should I take profits at 56? Looking at their numbers they still appear relatively cheap. I primarily focus on enterprise value to gross annual profits ratio which is about 3.5, and that's fairly low for a tech stock. On the other hand, I'm retired and when I've ot a nice profit on a stock it's tempting to take it. Only one logical course of action: Sell some and keep some."

Up 19% on a new CEO? I saw this shoot up on my OLB account and figured they must have gotten a buyout offer or something. Time to check their numbers and decide whether to take profits or aim for bigger gains.

"Down 8% on quarterly. I got mine at 40, didn't realize how much it's gone up. (and then partially retraced)GSA overcharging issue is frustrating, you would think any modern company would have enough checks and balances to spot such things before customer pays their bill. Although it was caught after the fact, at least it was they who caught it rather than the customer discovering they'd over paid. Anyway, overall the company seems to run the business well, so I guess one mistake can be forgiven. Usually a stock I own that moves 8% in one day I might want to"
