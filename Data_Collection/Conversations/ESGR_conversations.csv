"While I've commented very recently about the statistical attraction of ESGR relative to its 10-year valuation history, I'd like to also add to those who are technically-minded that ESGR looks to be thisclose to completing a very nice ""cup with handle."""

"Over the past decade, ESGR has typically sold at 1.3 times book and, during that same time, has sold at 1.5 times book in 5 of the last 10 years.At 9/30/2020, ESGR's reported book value was $242.36 and today's close was $203.93.If the company sells at its traditional 1.3 times book, the share price would reach $320.At 1.5 times book, the share price would reach $362.were the stock to get to just book value, that would be a gain of 20% from today's close; at 1.3 times book, the share price should appreciate by 56+% and at 1.5 times book, we'd be looking at a 77% price gain.Looks like a bargain to me."

Anyone know why this is so undervalued?
If you want dividends from ESGR buy the preferred stock ESGRP. Pays 7% when it is at $25. Try to buy $25 or below.It is $27.
After today's earnings report this is possibly the most undervalued company anywhere.
"ESGR should sell at 1.3 to 1.5 book...the company occupies a very nice niche in the runoff business. Insurers looking to offload their runoff business typically use ESGR (or at least give them an opportunity to bid on their ""disposable"" impediments to freeing up capital) and ESGR takes its pick of the options presented.$300 ++++++++++ should be a more realistic valuation.The Hillhouse ""offload"" of their shares was to facilitate other Hillhouse Asian options and should not be misinterpreted as a change in view of ESGR future potential."

My guess is that the 4th Q will not be good with a charge in store for the restructuring of the underwriting operation. That is the reason for the weakness. After earnings the decks will be cleared and the stock will approach book value or more...especially if the yield curve keeps steepening.

"I wanted to update my numbers after this morning's earnings report by ESGR. (BTW, 3 months ago, I posted the comments which are below and are following this update).Using the same valuation parameters as I did then.....and which I still feel are operative, using today's book value of $281.20, were ESGR to sell at it's annually occurring 1.3 times book, a fair value would be $365 versus about $226 as I write this note at mid-day Monday, March 1. At 1.5 times book, a fair value would be right around $421....so either the valuation metric, useful over the past decade + has changed,....or the stock is still significantly undervalued.*********************************************************************************************************3 months agoOver the past decade, ESGR has typically sold at 1.3 times book and, during that same time, has sold at 1.5 times book in 5 of the last 10 years.At 9/30/2020, ESGR's reported book value was $242.36 and today's close was $203.93.If the company sells at its traditional 1.3 times book, the share price would reach $320.At 1.5 times book, the share price would reach $362.were the stock to get to just book value, that would be a gain of 20% from today's close; at 1.3 times book, the share price should appreciate by 56+% and at 1.5 times book, we'd be looking at a 77% price gain.Looks like a bargain to me."

Eps 110. How is this volume so low?
"ESGR update:3/31/2021 book value $284.72.At 1.3 X book, ESGR should be priced at $370At 1.5 X book, ESGR should be priced at $427.ESGR today closed at $252.77 which, to me, represents a discount to ""fair historical values"" of between 46 and 69%.PLUS, today's news is indicated to be accretive to current book value and we still are awaiting the 6/30/2021 book value data.Still a substantial discount as I believe ""fair value"" is somewhere between 1.3 and 1.5 X book."
