After today's earnings report this is possibly the most undervalued company anywhere.
"The tangible book value per share has gone from 2014 to 2020 from $ 109,42 to $ 303,1. This is a 46% increase per year!Net income has increased from 154M in 2011 to 2.4B with only 1 year with a loss (2018).Is this a hidden gem or not?"
Is any negative thought ? I've never seen such an undervalued stock.
ESGR is likely to be over $300 post earnings once the mkt sees the effect of the Hillhouse buyback.
"ESGR should sell at 1.3 to 1.5 book...the company occupies a very nice niche in the runoff business. Insurers looking to offload their runoff business typically use ESGR (or at least give them an opportunity to bid on their ""disposable"" impediments to freeing up capital) and ESGR takes its pick of the options presented.$300 ++++++++++ should be a more realistic valuation.The Hillhouse ""offload"" of their shares was to facilitate other Hillhouse Asian options and should not be misinterpreted as a change in view of ESGR future potential."
"ESGR update:3/31/2021 book value $284.72.At 1.3 X book, ESGR should be priced at $370At 1.5 X book, ESGR should be priced at $427.ESGR today closed at $252.77 which, to me, represents a discount to ""fair historical values"" of between 46 and 69%.PLUS, today's news is indicated to be accretive to current book value and we still are awaiting the 6/30/2021 book value data.Still a substantial discount as I believe ""fair value"" is somewhere between 1.3 and 1.5 X book."
"Hey guys , you are very respected in your business . You own a chunk of WTRE . Make an friendly offer at 30 ( well below 39 book value ) and get the ultimate sale going . ACGL canâ€™t pick this puppy off for a steal price ."
The numbers don't add up. is this a shell game???
This Hillhouse sale of ESGR holding is great for ESGR......ESGR adding assets at below market valuations....
earnings out. wow!
Eps 110. How is this volume so low?
Director R Campbell bought 2000 shares in open market on 9/3 @ $223.88
Why do they not pay a dividend?
"June 30, 2021 book value is now $304.59.At 1.3 X book, likely value is $342.At 1.5 X book, likely value is $395.Discount calculates to between 30-50%.....still a bargain.....even if one prefers a 1.3 X book number."
huge block...252k shares traded on the close today. another 50k in the last half hour.
"Over the past decade, ESGR has typically sold at 1.3 times book and, during that same time, has sold at 1.5 times book in 5 of the last 10 years.At 9/30/2020, ESGR's reported book value was $242.36 and today's close was $203.93.If the company sells at its traditional 1.3 times book, the share price would reach $320.At 1.5 times book, the share price would reach $362.were the stock to get to just book value, that would be a gain of 20% from today's close; at 1.3 times book, the share price should appreciate by 56+% and at 1.5 times book, we'd be looking at a 77% price gain.Looks like a bargain to me."
"Why this share is so cheap?Tangible book value end 2011: 83,27Tangible book value end 2020: 303,1.This is 36% increase per year!And still the stock price is way onder the tangible book value.Am is missing something?"
"Anybody have any idea why the stock price is so much lower then the book value?Book value 30-6 #$%$ 319,25.At about 23% difference."
"While I've commented very recently about the statistical attraction of ESGR relative to its 10-year valuation history, I'd like to also add to those who are technically-minded that ESGR looks to be thisclose to completing a very nice ""cup with handle."""
"I wanted to update my numbers after this morning's earnings report by ESGR. (BTW, 3 months ago, I posted the comments which are below and are following this update).Using the same valuation parameters as I did then.....and which I still feel are operative, using today's book value of $281.20, were ESGR to sell at it's annually occurring 1.3 times book, a fair value would be $365 versus about $226 as I write this note at mid-day Monday, March 1. At 1.5 times book, a fair value would be right around $421....so either the valuation metric, useful over the past decade + has changed,....or the stock is still significantly undervalued.*********************************************************************************************************3 months agoOver the past decade, ESGR has typically sold at 1.3 times book and, during that same time, has sold at 1.5 times book in 5 of the last 10 years.At 9/30/2020, ESGR's reported book value was $242.36 and today's close was $203.93.If the company sells at its traditional 1.3 times book, the share price would reach $320.At 1.5 times book, the share price would reach $362.were the stock to get to just book value, that would be a gain of 20% from today's close; at 1.3 times book, the share price should appreciate by 56+% and at 1.5 times book, we'd be looking at a 77% price gain.Looks like a bargain to me."
