Gem in the rough here. I keep waiting for a little dip to buy more but it keeps making steady 1 to 2% gains every day. Excellent PE from a good company.

Little dip today is what I've been waiting for. Doubled my shares @ 15.80. Now almost 10% of my portfolio. Great company here in a good economic area. Excellent PE in a good stable market.
