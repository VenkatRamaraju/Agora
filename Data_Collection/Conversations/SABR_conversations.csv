Don’t worry a stock can’t go up every day!! SABRE will be at 12 bucks in 1-2 months focus on that!
"Delta Airlines (DAL) is already 5% away from its average pre-covid share price, while SABR is a whopping 30%. Any ideas why?"
"Merck’s new oral antiviral is gonna help international travel sector Up 6% today Look at the 10 year chartThis is a 22 Dollar stockGet your Dec 22, Jan 23 Call options in"
"10:24 AM EDT, 08/31/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Sabre SABR and Qatar Airways said Tuesday they are finalizing a new distribution agreement, which will secure long-term access to Qatar Airways' content through the Sabre travel marketplace.The companies did not provide further details on the talks or the terms of the distribution deal, but said the Sabre travel marketplace allows Qatar Airways to ""effectively market and sell"" its fares globally."
"A bit of a set back and the full recovery looks like it may take longer than anticipated due to the delta variant, however I am staying long until $20 per share!"
Such an undervalued stock - this will easily double by the summer and pick up $1-2 bucks each month leading up to it. Don’t miss out on cheap shares to take advantage of their dividends (once reinstated)!
"There’s no second wave. Even if there is hospitals are ready for it. Relax people , the reason it was so bad is cause we were not prepared."
"Tues was the straightest line down example of a controlled institutional sell, a day when lots of large investors were being played against their short positions in GME, AMC, etc..., and they needed to sell their other assets (ie:SABR) to cover their margins.I'd expect in the next few days, some will return to SABR because it's a good stock to benefit from the upcoming travel bounce. Just buy and wait."
Pretty undervalued at this price considering debt restructuring and all the new business they have generated over the past few months… It may take some time but as the world recovers this stock is poised for a serious recovery over the coming 6 months or so. I would try to build a position and hold till Summer 2022.
"has anyone here analyzed the situation around SABR's cash flow, total cash position, and debt burden? i am wondering whether SABR will need to issue more equity in the near future and if the company's solvency is in question."
"Just posted some DD on SABR on Reddit. Stay patient, travel is picking up and vaccinations are picking up. 19% short interest. Cup and handle pattern. SABR is not affected by rise in jet fuel like airline stocks. SABR gets paid per booking. https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/nwlrf9/sabr_dd_19_short_interest_cup_and_handle_pattern/"

Nice little pop today - let's see if she will hold. This should be well over $15...I imagine shorts will need to cover sooner than later.
Easy money if you can be patient for 3-6 months. $20+ Guaranteed. My largest position
100 percent chance they have to sell more shares to survive. They already diluted the stock 10 percent back in Aug 2020. Didnt a sabre executive sell like 600k worth of stock way back when it was 16 dollars a share?
"“COVID-19 has had a significant adverse effect on the travel industry, global travel bookings and on our business, financial condition and operating results,” the company said. “This adverse effect is very likely to continue until the virus is contained and may continue thereafter, particularly if government regulation of, and consumer attitudes toward, travel change in a lasting way.”"
Buy on dips and hold. You will be rewarded. GL
Well now we see the price of the offering is $850m and going to close around Thursday this week. I think we'll see a surge with the Trump plasma news and just some windfall from the RNC this week but overall I'm really concerned when that deal closes we'll see another drop to the low 6 range. I'm long at $8.90 with the intention all along to hold until next summer but this is tough to watch.
Sabre Forges 10-Year Partnership with Google to Build the Future of Travel.
"worst performing travel stock on the entire sector.. if you bought this stock, you bought the worst stock in the travel sector.. the worst! next time consider using a dart board, then you at least will not pick the WORST of all the stocks..."
Short interest has dropped by 3mil shares. 6% change. I take that as a good sign sentiment may be finally starting to change. Hope this will finally break that 12.40 barrier.
GREAT buy today! SABR will be $12-14 per share within 2-3 months
Why the big drop today? Noticed some insider selling. Still think this is a $20 stock easy.
"They had over $1b in cash in the last 10Q, seems a bit overly prudent to start raising finances again now, unless they see Delta dragging out till 2022."
"TSA number are increasing every month. Vaccinations are beginning to accelerate. There is a large pent up demand for travel. Collaboration with Google may lead to future acquisition. Dominant market leader..etc, etc.etc. This will be a $20 stock by June 1st. Don’t over think it."
"weird - SABR continues to be stuck around $12 while its customers (airlines) are up 3% today - flying more people than earlier in the pandemic. Vaccines are getting world-wide approval and in the US CVS and Walgreens will have vaccinated large swathes of the older generation by Jan's end producing a correlative decrease in COVID deaths. What gives with the SABR institutional investors, are they all just AI?"

This stock will be back to where it was precovid by summer 2021– great company providing quality service to a huge market.
"The whole market is up including airlines, corona cases are going down, most vaccines are in phase 3 trials, SABR has almost $2B cash, has extended its debt deadline, but the share price is tending downward. What gives?"
Why? Why we are on last year level?
Anyone notice that the after hours price and volume shoots up and then when normal hours trading resumes this falls back down? Are HF building a position?
"SABR is short 60 MILLION .20 % Short volume .. The travel is coming back .. This could be a potential candidate for short squeeze .. Please share your thoughts .Sabre is a global technology company. Our innovative technology is used by more than a billion people around the worldIt is the largest global distribution systems provider for air bookings in North AmericaAt the time, the company did business with 70 airlines and 100,000 hotels.[38] It operates under the platforms Sabre Travel Network, Airline and Hospitality Solutions."
"Interesting to see Hotel companies (Hilton, Marriott) largely recovered to prior to Covid valuations (despite more debt) while Sabre that will benefit from same transactions is at 6 year low......I have taken a small position but curious to hear why recovery is so slow on this software service....is the street right with current valuation? Trying to decide whether to make this a larger recovery play.....seems like a better bet than airlines or cruise!"
"With resorts and airlines up so much, why is this not following suit? I’m surprised it’s not up more at this point. Had an awesome opening price but nothing but down hill so far today."
SABR is valued less today than after its last 2 qtrly reports even though it has generated more revenue ($420M). What a muddled market.
Going up!
I was in a themed park yesterday it was absolutely mobbed so I’m confident travel will open up
Any views on how the upcoming earnings announcement (in 13 days I think) might impact the stock price? Is the bad news already priced in do we think? Or is there further downside not already priced in to the stock price?
Looks like a positive day today. Hopeful the rest of the week will be more of the same!
"Short interest 20%. I think this is what shorts have been waiting for, new round of financing and dilution. Dont know how much further this will go down but i expect some shorts to start closing their position."
They had some interesting insights about SABR on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"International travel should be back by January 2023, that’s 15 months from now!Who else is doing Call Options for January 2023 Strike @12 ????"
Easy money…$15 in Q4 and $18 Q1.
price needs to consolidate. from a technical standpoint this was needed. that push to mid 11s happened very fast. I dont know where it will settle (and obviously a lot of news is relevant) but I would expect some sideways trading for a little while and then a push back up provided nothing really negative comes out.
Kids shot approved! Travel guidance will be blowout!!! Get it while it’s cheap. We will be above $12 in days
Great vaccine news from Moderna - very bullish on the travel industry and the very undervalued SABRE!https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/07/14/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html
Big week ahead for SABR...$17 per share by weeks end. Increased vaccination = Increased Travel = Increased Share Price
I would argue this is a great long-term hold going into next year when the world is wide open. Leisure and business travel will recover. It is just a matter of time￼.
"... When a Company makes it on the ZACKS Strong Sell list , you know it is undervalued, and a screaming Buy."
I have been out of sabr for a while now but couldnt pass up the opportunity to get it at $5.8. I know there is potential downside but my gut says we wont have another lockdown and we may never see this price range again. Just my humble thoughts :) Happy Friday and see yall monday!
Clear sailing to $14
"As part of the deal, Sabre pledged it would pay Farelogix a breakup fee of up to $25 million if it couldn’t close the transaction. Sabre had separately fronted at least $20 million in attorney fees for it and Farelogix to defend the deal, which it probably can’t recover.Farelogix’s fate is uncertain. During the trial, Farelogix said it had been approached by other potential acquirers in 2017 and 2018, including an unnamed private firm and American Airlines and United Airlines.“We are disappointed that our plan to join with Sabre is not going forward,” a Farelogix spokesperson said. “However, due to the inherent uncertainty with any regulatory process, we have been well prepared for this possibility. Over the past eighteen months, we have made great strides in advancing our technology infrastructure, optimizing our product delivery, streamlining our operational processes, and implementing new customers.”"
"Good day to average down again. Took a little work over the last month of ups and down so now I've got a very solid position with a lot of shares averaged under 9 now. Sit back and wait for this one, surly not a day trader stock, this is for investors only!"

"That is because the Apr 17, 2020 $10.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options"
until COVID is completely done.. and i mean DONE.....these travel stock will fall all winter.. as I said see you at $8... if not lower....
"I spotted Sabre last Friday as the name rolled across the FOX Business screen. Had no idea what it did or sold, but it was the name that enticed me. First purchase was made at opening Monday ($ 3.35). Had to sell my MJ ETF for the money while waiting for more to come into my Schwab account today allowing more purchases up to $4.755. What was it about the name Sabre? That was the name of my German Shepherd which I had for 17 years till he died in my arms here in Denver many years ago. Smartest animal I have ever known."
Tsa travel in the us down over 30 percent 3 days in a row vs 2019. Hasn't been that bad in several months. Travel no longer improving. I had to sell.
IMO the offering was just bad timing. They should have waited for the Vaccine announcement (IMO this year) to boost the SP and then made the offering. Watch your stop-loss settings.
This stock is criminally undervalued... Travel will be back again.... Its just a matter of time.... Also can be potential buyout target
CDC revising numbers!! When truth is shown flights will be full again and boom!
"Business Travel Will Recover And Exceed Pre-Pandemic LevelsBusiness travel is coming back at United, from down 80% to down 75%. Kirby expects business demand will recover, and those who disagree are just wrong. One “inflection point” already was the change in mask guidance for vaccinated individuals by the CDC. However the airline expects a big ramp up in business traffic come September. • Even tech companies will return to the office. However there may be a hybrid work model. Kirby sees people working in the office half the time, and that one “incremental source of business travel” is “people who trade their daily two hour commute by car for a monthly commute by airplane.” However I’d note that people being in the office only half the time means less of an opportunity to travel to their office to meet with them – that footprint declines by 50% as well."
Sabr was being traded at this price back before people were vaccinated and when travel was less than 1M/day.This stock and its short position is completely controlled by institutional investors (111.09% of Float Held by Institutions -Yahoo). Their AI code tells them to sell and no amount of retail buying can elevate the price against their huge steady automated sell.This market doesn't reflect Sabr' valuation and won't until it reports its 2 quarter in early Aug.

"So this is trading well below its IPO from 2016! Covid recovery is on the way. For me, this is an easy double from today’s price within 6 months"
Tsa travel numbers higher yesterday July 1 vs the same day in 2019.
"Most important part of their earnings report: ""As a reminder, we withdrew the guidance provided on our February earnings call and are not issuing guidance at this time."" So if things were really ""taking off,"" then why would they pull guidance? That's a HUGE red flag. If you have read the 2010 Rockefeller Foundation report that outlines the entire PLAN-demic, then you know travel is NEVER coming back. Obviously Warren Buffett was informed of that reality and immediately exited ALL his airline holdings abruptly."
"Why 25% short? Seems risky assumption as more likely to pop higher vs lower, no? Appreciate anyone’s thoughts on why this stock so strongly shorted?"
"4 Billion Revenue, lowered target to $18 and Forward Dividend & Yield 0.56 (4.30%)Why is this not a screaming BUY regardless of COVID19 and missed earnings?"
"My first purchase was 300 shares on June 8, 2020, $10.42. Now the price is $8.5, and I plan to purchase another $3000 dollars on Sabre stocks on June 18, 2020."
"7 day average TSA numbers 2021 vs 2019 highest since the start of the pandemic at 85%. The overall TSA numbers are down but this is seasonal trend and vs 2019 we are looking pretty good, and this is before Transatlantic travel opens (if it ever opens)."
"SABR is being pulled downwards by the shorts to make some Nickle and Dimes. Economy is improving, travel is at its peak (try booking a flight or hotel you will see the sky rocket prices), there is tremendous demand for folks to get out and enjoy life. SABR is being manipulated and will move higher close to $16 in a month before the earnings report in August. Long here!!!!!"
"$17 after hours. Shorts are terrified. Still 7 days to cover. Here comes 20 baby! TSA data continues to gain momentum. Just ask your wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend. Everyone wants to travel!!!!"
My Jan 2023 Call options strike 12 are once again “in the money” because stock is at 12.09 :)Thank God! Hopefully this just keeps going up from now on. I heard from someone who works for American Airline they called in all their flight attendants who were on leave

"We will be ""away"" from covid this summer. Travel Tech ETF ""AWAY"" $ABNB $LYFT $SABR"
"Some context - this company doesn’t own and plane, hotel, cruise ship, or travel agency. This is a technology company that has enough cash according to the management that can survive with 0 revenue for a year and half. This company will make it through this crisis leaner and more profitable than when it came in and be a strong buyout candidate. Stay long and watch your investment double or triple in the next 12-18 months - just my two cents."
"Medical researchers at university of Tokyo have studied the new lambda variant. They found it is just as transmissible as delta, and more resistant to covid vaccines. Everyone who hasnt had covid and recovered, needs to get vaccinated now."
"Looking for revenue to bounce back a little more, but wondering about cash flow and cash position. Otherwise why announce sale of division during bounce back a few days before numbers are reported."
TSA passenger numbers yesterday 94% of 2019!7 day average 83% 0f 2019.
shares go to 20+
"SABR is being hugely oversold by its 99% automated institutional investors (T.Rowe, etc...) whose algorithms are comparing Q1, 2021 performance to Q1,2020. In comparison Airline stocks are currently trading at pre-pandemic prices with only half the performance but they have more human non-institutional investors. Most human investors would consider the gain to risk ratio on SABR to be quite high (ignoring black swan events). For example:1/ has the bookings paradigm changed? No 2/ will people stop traveling? No, look at the elevated leisure travel3/ is covid dominating the world? for the most part No, vaccination programs are working, a few countries have political/vaccination issues (India, Brazil).4/ will business travel return? Yes, it's more about when. America, Europe are opening up.5/ will SABR go bankrupt before profitability? No, they have 1.3B cash with a Q1 burn-rate of 200M.6/ Has SABR lost market share? No, the shift to Google cloud promises to add a competitive advantage with a cost reduction.7/ How high will SABR stock go? SABR 5-year average share price pre-pandemic was $23 (pre-Google collaboration).For the human investors, this drop in share price is an opportunity gift from the AI bots who in 3 months will compare Q2,2021 to Q2,2020 performance and will then instruct their institutions to buy SABR back."
"Pure manipulation by big institutions driving down price for last couple of weeks ! TSA data shows air travel has increased dramatically to only 15% off the 2019 level vs expected 25% off. Plus international travel is opening up fully. Dovid daily cases in US, Canada, Mexico etc have been going down steadily. Scoop up these low prices now and cash in in just 3/4 moths , potential 40+% minimum return."

CEO stated they have enough liquidity for a year with NO bookings. The sky is not falling chicken little
"Feeling like I’m rolling the dice a bit right now, but I bought more shares just before close at $5.85, planning to hold long of course and hope to see this back to $20 after vaccine is available."
TSA numbers increased significantly in Q3. https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput
Q2 earnings will show tremendous growth. A positive Q3 projection will lead to an analyst upgrade and a $15 per share price. Staying long until $20 by Oct-Nov.
"I purchased 50,000 stock at $6 hopefully it will show some results in a year"
Why is the stock falling so much? Results were not that bad...
I posted yesterday about IPNFF it went up 80% today. Augmented reality is the future a brand new sector that is just beginning to be opened up. Do your DD it is only the beginning. 10x to 100X potential. In all stocks in the sector. Sabre and all other company's will be involved. Research people!
"Trading off the short term ""bleak"" outlook for the industry with the long-term ""positive"" outlook for travel and hospitality. If you think that by next summer the situation is normalized with hundreds of millions of people vaccinated and ready to travel, this one should do well...at least looking a few months out..."
Bad management error releasing bookings were down. No reason to come out with that info when they did.
"This has been tough to watch. I got in at just about $8/share a few days ago, after giving a lot of thought to even buying. It was always my intent to hold on for at least a couple years as airline travel in the US would likely have to pick up at some point, especially if a vaccine becomes available. I’d also seen releases that Sabre was expanding or extending agreements overseas. So now I’m fighting the urge to cut my losses, or stick with my original plan with an expectation that a meaningful return on my investment may take a few years longer and even potentially add more shares if the SP drops to $6 or lower. Feeling pretty uncertain about any of it now."
I see a good increase either after results or 8th November once transatlantic travel re-opens
Numb Nuts finally lifted the International Travel Ban. Hopefully we will see a lift going forward. Q3 earnings should reveal positive sequential growth
"Surprising to see that SABR has been unable to go up (past $13) for months, while in that same time frame, in the US, new Covid cases have fallen by more than a half and over 40M vaccine doses have been administered. Both oil and airlines stock prices have also risen while SABR has only flat-lined. SABR is 100% owned by institutional investors using other people's money, and who knows how they will react on Feb 16th when SABR announces earnings or on Feb 26th when the US permits the one-shot J&J vaccine (the share price actually dropped on this news)."
"All travel stocks are being manipulated at the moment! Its disgraceful!Travel numbers increasing on a daily basis, positive news flowing out from airlines and travel agencies, lockdowns easing. What will it take for this to go up!"

"Stock's been dropping for 2 weeks on good news (US reopening international travel, future projections from airlines).Today SABR makes a public announcement that it's selling off a piece of itself. Sucks to be the general public."
Google is getting into travel - so it’s a real possibility that the SABR google 10 year partnership is actually a formal courting for Google buying out SABRE and other travel tech companies. Google needs growth and SABRE is cutting costs and integrating Google cloud and AI - SABR is worth 25- 30 bucks a share easy IMO
"Read this:As a software technology company, the unique aspect to consider with Sabre Corp. (NASDAQ:SABR) is its involvement in the global travel industry. The company’s portfolio caters to airlines, car rental companies, travel agencies, and hotels helping to manage operations like reservations, back-end revenue management, flight crew management, and even flights. Sabre also operates a travel marketplace processing travel arrangements. Earlier this week the company’s technology was implemented by Gulf Air, a top carrier in Bahrain. Croatia Airlines, GOL Airlines, and BIDTravel have all recently signed or enhanced agreements with Sabre. Considering the SABR stock was trading as low as $3.30 in March, it’s clear that reopening optimism – specifically in the travel industry – has helped. This week, shares reached highs of $11.73. Analysts at Deutsche Bank recently boosted their price target on SABR to $12 from $9 but still have a Hold rating on the stock. With the idea that travel picks up because of a vaccine as a solution to treating coronavirus, the backbone/pick and shovel stocks shouldn’t be forgotten. In Sabre’s case, the company expects that pent up demand for travel should firmly establish a more profitable recovery from the pandemic."
"Airlines up pre-market, TSA numbers holding steady at 1.4M with a hundred million more vaccines to dole out in the US this month...India has a new vaccine, Britain is getting its Moderna shipment, what is not to love about this stock?"
Business travel not coming back soon. Too much liability. I'm traveling later this year only because I have to use my airline tix within 1 year or lose it.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sabre-mindsay-partner-create-chatbot-120000116.htmlGreat news - love that SABRE is building out its tech platform with AI - will make it even more attractive to the marketplace that will need to “do more with less FTEs” as the travel industry recovers!
Astra Zeneca will report excellent news tomorrow on vaccine results - IMO should raise SABREs base to 10 bucks a share before the end of August!
"As travel continues to increase, even with the increase of covid 19 cases, this stock will continue to increase. The more traveling the more Sabre technology will be used. I think we have seen bottom and now this should slowly continue to rise. We will see 10 before we see 6.5 again."
"In 9 to 12 months from now, either a vaccine is found or the world learns how to live with this disease and get back to normal life. I’m healthcare provider and go to work everyday knowing that there is No vaccine for HIV & Hep C; but I wear my PPE and do my surgeries. Why? -because the world has learned to live with HIV & Hep C virus among us; same will happen to this virus if a vaccine is not found. Aside from its high rate of transmission this virus is not as deadly as many other microbes out there, plus it’s target audience is very predictable; individuals older than 65 and patients with underlying conditions. The solution is simple; isolate and protect and support the at risk population and let the rest of the society live with the virus and function normally with some added social distancing.$PK $SVC $SABR $SPG"
"“Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings CEO: Our outlook is on track, the world is opening up”Even the Cruise Lines are optimistic about World Travel, let alone Airlines and Hotels and their software companies"
"Any news to support such a drop today?! It seems a lot of the travel names are down, but this one is getting hurt more than the others..."
Disclaimer: NEVER ever ever buy or sell based on the yahoo message boards...The boards I have watched in the past are probably 98% wrong on all speculations
"What is going on here? So much weakness...we were above $20 a year ago...giant partnership with Google, push into digital/AI, restructuring and now massive vaccination campaign with an end in sight and still no love...strange, strange, strange..."
"Unreal that this stock is still being held down by shorts, shorting $SABR is possibly the worst thesis I can imagine, how will you defend it to your investment committees when the stock finally bounces to reflect the recovery and you’re caught in a squeeze god forbid WSB/Reddit takes interest in it...June will be much better because the May results were skewed by the still nascent recovery in early May...analysts will start to upgrade...travel restrictions being lifted everywhere...Hilton saying summer 2021 will be better than summer 2019..."
I’m in at 12 and will wait. This is a winner!
"What I believe is happening; Sabre is selling $500 mil of stock, $250 mil will be converted to regular stock and $250 mil is going to preferred stock that will convert to regular stock on sept 2023 @ $100. I believe this means that the people who buy the preferred stock now will get $100 worth of whatever the stock is worth on sept 2023. So if the stock is worth $50 bucks, they'll get 2 shares. Pretty sweet deal if thats what it is.Anyways (from what I understand) the immediate outcome of the $250 mil worth of common shares being sold right now, is the stock will get diluted by about 13%ish (depends on the price point of those sold shares). If sold at $7 per share, then that's 35.7 million shares being sold, which is about 13% of the total shares currently outstanding, which is what the stock should drop down by. What I believe this means is that the company needs cash and doesn't want to go into debt to get it. Sucks for investors but helps with the immediate cash flow."
SABR looks liek a very attractive takeover target. Cost to acquire substaintial revenue and profits for a reasonable investment. I wouldn't be surprised to see someone make an offer soon. Imagine all of the large players in the travel industry who would love to add the revenue plus the value of all the data in the SABR system to their portfolio.
"Any company that partners with Google will double stock price in a matter of months......long SABR, even before the public offering that dropped our share price by $3, it will recover nicely!"
"EBITDA guidance very low, business continues leaking cash despite the strong recovery in travel.Morgan Stanley just downgraded the stock this morning, target of $15 only. Not much upside left."
Sabre is up 5.97% to 10.11
SABR is DOWN?!? on the busiest day in 14 months (TSA numbers)!
"Latest deal with Pacific Airlines shows the strength and market share SABR has. This is a powerful statement:(NASDAQ: SABR), the leading software and technology company that powers the global travel industry.This does not say they are a leading company, it says they are THE leading company. Good place to be and great price to scoop up more shares!"
"Interesting to see stock stumbling here. Great entry point. Doing a refinancing of the line of credit. Debt maturities pushed back. New deal with Latam, among many recent deals announced recently...airlines are about to restart in 2021. The future is quite bright here. Both on the airline travel front and hospitality front. The stock has rebounded but to think it was in the mid-$20s pre-pandemic tells me there is still room to grow here..."

I don’t know what I would do without my daily emails from (http://trademarketview.tech)! They help me make the most of my trades and never let me down! Don’t know how I ever traded without them!
"I have been happy with my position at $8.90 for the last 5 months, it's been up, it's been down but so has everything else. I've been bullish on SABR since the start but this was totally unexpected and now I'm thinking it will be best to sell at a loss and re-buy when a new bottom is stable and MAYBE re-buy then or possibly not get in again. I agree with some of the other opinions that this is a cloud base company servicing airlines around the world but this offering shows they are not as well off as the balance sheets would have you think. Thoughts?"
Anyone know what the short interest on this stock is as of today?
Predicting an acquisition of Sabre by Google soon! $25 range
"I've been long here for months. You guys who got in yesterday are fine, it was up over a dollar and has only given half of that back today, totally expected on a sell off Friday. This is a 2021 stock and will be in the teens in 6-8 months but if you think this is a quick turn day trade you're way wrong and gonna be here for a while!"
Down 3% on no news and not directly effected by oil prices. That makes sense!
"I assume this means that Sabre is simply using google as a software supplier for AI and also as a cloud platform. I didnt see anything which says that Google is a business partner with Sabre. Am I mistaken? Are Google and Sabre travel business partners? Google has its own travel platform that it provides pricing results from various comlpanies; obviously also leaning towards its pay per click also for results. It would be unlikely that Google would get into the travel reservation business, in partnership with Sabre. This news is simply being misunderstood. That's my opinion. Don't bash me. I dont own Sabre. I am just watching it."
"I hesitate to sell because airlines are picking up. Eg...Southwest just reported positive news. SABR is such a vital part of the entire travel industry. And upon normalcy, the potential is almost a triple. I’m more inclined to hold my $8.11 shares and add more. The longer upside is too big to ignore."
"""The resurgence in demand for travel is in full swing,"" Keyes said. ""If you look at the number of flight searches, especially the more iconic travel destinations like Hawaii or Cancun, it's higher today than it was at the same time two years ago before the pandemic -- it's not even close."""
Why is this down and all other airline and travel related shares up!Pure manipulation.
"I normally don't care about the short position, but with yesterday (16%) gain and shorts (21%) having 7 days to cover, this might get very interesting (unless you are shorting). A couple more positive days and they will have to sell."
Going to work on some due diligence research I will post here and probably on Reddit in the near future. I know Sabre issued a decent amount of shares to raise cash earlier in the pandemic but it seems like they have still really lagged the greater travel/ leisure market in terms of share price recovery. I would also note it seems like Sabre has signed dozens of new partnerships over the past few months which shows an aggressive management team and potential increases in future revenue… I will post more details/ analysis soon but those are some of my poorly articulated thoughts. Overall I feel like Sabre is a significantly undervalued recovery play.
"Anyone concerned about CEO Sean Menke dumping 100K shares 12/28/20? He sold at $11.93/share. Menke also sold 8K shares 12/17/20. He still beneficially owns 754,874 shares, but seeing that big of a dump raises red flags for me."
Won’t be long before analyst upgrades start rolling in now
"Sabre Corporation SABR has recently signed a strategic partnership with the national air carrier of Bangladesh, Biman Bangladesh. Per the deal, the travel tech company will be providing its Global Distribution System (“GDS”) and SabreSonic Passenger Service System (“PSS”) solutions to the Asian airline.Using Sabre’s PSS platform, along with a wide range of other technology solutions (including its GDS), the Dhaka-based airline intends to accelerate its digital transformation process and provide new and personalized experiences to its customer base worldwide.On the other hand, the deal is likely to aid the leading travel-related software and technology provider in expanding its customer share in the Airlines Solutions segment. Sabre has its customer base spread over 160 nations with more than 425,000 agency partners globally. It is one of the largest marketplaces in the world, managing approximately $260 billion worth of global travel spending annually."""
Football stadiums are packed and people are moving past mainstream media’s promotion of FEAR. TSA #’s also improving. $15 in Q4
"TSA just announced that they are planning to hire 6,000 new agents to support the increased travel this summer. Sabre will return to $20 per share by July. Buying more..."
Google...time to buy Sabre. Tremendous synergies. $20 per share!!
This stock will double within 12 months when the travel industry recovers. Stay long and your patience will be rewarded.
"Was in at 4, 5 and 6 usd. I am here fir the long haul . Matter of time before it gets back to 20 plus . Have nearly 10k shares in it. My 20 years of hospitality tech experience tells me to hold and wait."
Isn't this the old American Airlines ticketing infrastructure ? You can probably hire COBOL and FORTRAN experts for your architecture. Sabre - welcome to the 1960s.
I am still ahead tho my last purchase was at $6.00. I have money coming into my account and will add if price stays about $.5.50. This stock is the best play in future transportation and hospitality stocks. I think SP of $10.00 within a month or two.
TSA traveler numbers out - now 1.5M+ travelers. Sabre benefits as these numbers climb. No fundamental reason for this stock to be experiencing weakness.
Share price seems to be holding up well given the drop in the market and the Airlines today. Anyone see this dropping further?
