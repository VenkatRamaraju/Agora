"Looking for revenue to bounce back a little more, but wondering about cash flow and cash position. Otherwise why announce sale of division during bounce back a few days before numbers are reported."
Short interest has dropped by 3mil shares. 6% change. I take that as a good sign sentiment may be finally starting to change. Hope this will finally break that 12.40 barrier.
"So this is trading well below its IPO from 2016! Covid recovery is on the way. For me, this is an easy double from today’s price within 6 months"
Anyone notice that the after hours price and volume shoots up and then when normal hours trading resumes this falls back down? Are HF building a position?

"“Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings CEO: Our outlook is on track, the world is opening up”Even the Cruise Lines are optimistic about World Travel, let alone Airlines and Hotels and their software companies"
My Jan 2023 Call options strike 12 are once again “in the money” because stock is at 12.09 :)Thank God! Hopefully this just keeps going up from now on. I heard from someone who works for American Airline they called in all their flight attendants who were on leave
TSA passenger numbers yesterday 94% of 2019!7 day average 83% 0f 2019.
Why? Why we are on last year level?
"Stock's been dropping for 2 weeks on good news (US reopening international travel, future projections from airlines).Today SABR makes a public announcement that it's selling off a piece of itself. Sucks to be the general public."
"worst performing travel stock on the entire sector.. if you bought this stock, you bought the worst stock in the travel sector.. the worst! next time consider using a dart board, then you at least will not pick the WORST of all the stocks..."
Numb Nuts finally lifted the International Travel Ban. Hopefully we will see a lift going forward. Q3 earnings should reveal positive sequential growth
Sabre And Emirates Reach New Distribution Agreement!
What’s going on is that the big boys can manipulate the price as they please. I see this slide continuing until result get announced next week. After that it’s anyones guess what will happen!
TSA numbers increased significantly in Q3. https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput
I see a good increase either after results or 8th November once transatlantic travel re-opens
"Pure manipulation by big institutions driving down price for last couple of weeks ! TSA data shows air travel has increased dramatically to only 15% off the 2019 level vs expected 25% off. Plus international travel is opening up fully. Dovid daily cases in US, Canada, Mexico etc have been going down steadily. Scoop up these low prices now and cash in in just 3/4 moths , potential 40+% minimum return."
Down 3% on no news and not directly effected by oil prices. That makes sense!
"Read this:As a software technology company, the unique aspect to consider with Sabre Corp. (NASDAQ:SABR) is its involvement in the global travel industry. The company’s portfolio caters to airlines, car rental companies, travel agencies, and hotels helping to manage operations like reservations, back-end revenue management, flight crew management, and even flights. Sabre also operates a travel marketplace processing travel arrangements. Earlier this week the company’s technology was implemented by Gulf Air, a top carrier in Bahrain. Croatia Airlines, GOL Airlines, and BIDTravel have all recently signed or enhanced agreements with Sabre. Considering the SABR stock was trading as low as $3.30 in March, it’s clear that reopening optimism – specifically in the travel industry – has helped. This week, shares reached highs of $11.73. Analysts at Deutsche Bank recently boosted their price target on SABR to $12 from $9 but still have a Hold rating on the stock. With the idea that travel picks up because of a vaccine as a solution to treating coronavirus, the backbone/pick and shovel stocks shouldn’t be forgotten. In Sabre’s case, the company expects that pent up demand for travel should firmly establish a more profitable recovery from the pandemic."
"Hang in there boys we cash out at $20, coming soon"
