"KEY provides great products & services to their clients. if they do as well transforming to the on line banking market as they have their clients and stakeholders, they will continue to provide a solid investment in my portfolio."
"Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities on CNBC yesterday, check out on Youtube. #1 analyst says the bull market in banks is just beginning. With BAC his favorite. He said after CCAR, the banks will release even more reserves. Yes, jobs number missed second month in a roll meaning the economy may not be as strong. Fed won't raise raise rates until employment numbers get back up. Wait till all the states that are opening up, everyone will be finding new jobs after putting up with working from home over a year. The great rotation is just beginning."
"Mike Mayo was unduly negative on Key. Clearly got an agenda to beat all banks down. Key is not like C or WFC (he's an analyst for them, so of course don't criticise them)."
Get in before KEY announced dividend increase next month during earnings.
Key is my number one go to for bank stock . Great buying opportunity.
"See how KEY and the other banks react next week after the Fed meeting. If the market stabilize the banks will recover if not what a huge buying opportunity in banks trading like its a fire sale. BAC Brian Moynihan says banks are well capitalize and ready to help its customers. KEY has branches that has no employees and are moving their loans to be more automated, lower overhead. They better be buying stock this quarter. All the banks are trading like a recession is coming. First 10/2 Yield curve, 10yr yield is going back up so that is a positive for banks. Second the difference is widening, another positive. Once this virus dissipate after 3 months everything will go back to normal in theory and so will the banks. The economy is not going into recession, even though it inverted last sept, it normally hits 12-18 months later. Its only been 6 months. If you are over age 60 reduce your activity, everybody else wear latex gloves and continue your everyday activity in my opinion. Good luck longs."
@BrownsTribeCavs - So I was in downtown Cleveland yesterday walking right by KEY headquarters. The front doors open up & a Big Dog comes out a takes a massive dump on the sidewalk. Is this a good or bad sign for KEY stock price?
"not seeing any news, yet this is up 2% in pre-market on some heavy trading"
"Did KEY declare a div increase and a buyback thru CCAR plan? Most banks stated, did not see KEY."
"Let hit 20 today with over 2000 open interest call option at 20. All banks are rising , C increase rate to 4.5% as well. Regiional banks will soon compete for fund, then funs to trigger series of merger and acquisition of regional banks."
Wait for it.. this has another 10% gain near term
Good luck for KEY Longs tomorrow. Fifth Third had good earnings hopefully translate to KEY.
someone please buy this bank!
heard Key is going through big cost savings and expense reduction again. Many jobs eliminated and branches closing . Did the first niagara merger not produce the expected financial numbers - whats the story ?
Doubled my position today and averaged down from my prior purchase!
Beth Mooney needs to wake up. Vic Riley she is not. 52 wk low in this economy is not good.
Wedbush upgraded KEY from Neutral to Outperform today with price target from $23 to $25. Less see if it can break $22.15 5yr resistance level.
"The FED will release the results of the 2020 bank stress tests today 6/25 at 4:30 PM EST.It will report on 34 banks with assets over $100 billion - KEY is one of them.Lots of anticipation about the state of the banks financial condition.Banks will have lower profits for at least the remainder of 2020 due to near-zero interest rates and bad personal/commercial loans. Watch for any recommendations by the FED for a bank to reduce dividends because their quarterly dividend payment per share exceeds their quarterly EPS.Overall, I believe that banks in general are in decent shape. Much better than the 2008/2009 financial crisis."
Interesting movement.
Morgan Stanley raised KEY from price target from $24 to $26. Maintains equal weight rating.
DING  DING  DING  Three weeks ago I made the famed Double Duce Call as follows: “Oh ya. Looking for a great call followed by 22 (the Double Duce!!).”. And today WE HAVE IT. Congrats to the BIG DOG who took over last May 1 at $9!!! 
All banks are up. KEY should catch up
"KEY hedges against lower rate environment. According to Barrons article last week KEY is ""one of the best positioned banks in this low-rate environment"", by Peter Winter of Wedbush. More loan growth with lower rates means more fees."
IMHO the fundamentals for financial companies are moderately positive but I think some stocks are getting ahead of themselves. A slight sell-off would not be surprising to me and will be buying the dip if it occurs.
Wow! I'm glad my $19.50 calls were assigned last Friday.This drop is a godsend. Buy back in and sell some calls.
3000 dec 14 calls traded so far today
Great dividend and growing. KEY increased dividend shows management is rosy about the increasing income from completion of acquisition synergy
hey guys does this stock offer monthly dividends like the Canadian version? if so how much?
How big will govt fine be?
KEY mentioned in this weeks Barrons as one of six high yield growers p21.
any news on why this dropping so much
"KEY releases Q3 earnings on Wednesday 10/21 before the market opens.Earnings estimates are .36/share mean, .18/share low, .47/share high.Revenue estimates are $1.69B average, $1.66B low, $1.73B high.Quite a range on analyst's earnings estimates."
What do you think the takeover chances are here? Many solid regionals have already been gobbled. I always thought this would be a candidate. Go longs.
So long as they only need one more quarter of significant loan reserves then the dividend is likely safe. If banks are still adding significant loan reserves in Q4 2020 then you should sell your entire portfolio of equities now.
Hey Moon.... Key went from near bankruptcy to $17 and JPM went from $29 to over $120. Please explain this to all of us. ASAP Beth Baby!
"Piper wait till KEY goes to $25 and higher. The great rotation from growth to value is under way, plus they just bought an analytics company today to help them understand there customers better. After CCAR in Jun, the fed hopefully will ok div increase this year which will give the stock another boost."
"WASHINGTON (R-e-u-t-e-r-s) -Federal Reserve policymakers have begun to acknowledge they are closer to debating when to pull back some of their crisis support for the U.S. economy, even as they say it is still needed to bolster the recovery and employment.""We are talking about talking about tapering,"" San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly told CNBC on Tuesday, referring to the potential reduction of the Fed's $120 billion in monthly asset purchases. Those bond buys, together with near-zero interest rates, are aimed at easing borrowing costs and encouraging hiring and investment.""I want to make sure that everyone knows that it's not about doing anything now,"" Daly added. She noted that while she is ""bullish"" about the fall, the economy is still more than 8 million jobs short of where it was before the pandemic, which is still not over. ""Right now, policy is in a very good place....we need to be patient.""Earlier Tuesday, Vice Chair Richard Clarida also opened the door to talking about the Fed doing less - at some point. ""It may well be...there will come a time in upcoming meetings we will be at the point where we can begin to discuss scaling back the pace of asset purchases,"" Clarida said on Yahoo Finance. ""That was not the focus of the April meeting. It is going to depend on the flow of data.""This suggestion that talking about tapering could become appropriate is a shift from just a month ago when Chair Jerome Powell said it was ""not yet"" time to even contemplate having that conversation.Fed policymakers have promised to give markets plenty of notice before changing policy, to avoid a repeat of the ""taper tantrum"" spike in bond yields after former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke surprised markets by flagging a reduction to the Fed's bond-buying in 2013.Since their April meeting, two regional Federal Reserve bank presidents have publicly urged that the discussion begin soon, and others have highlighted the risks should a current round of price increases become a more embedded cycle of inflation.The Fed has promised it won't raise rates until the economy is back to full employment and it sees inflation reach 2% and poised to rise above that level.That stance worries some analysts who believe the Fed has become too relaxed about inflation and is setting the stage for a painful round of abrupt, inflation-fighting interest rate increases that could also push the economy back into recession.Most Fed policymakers have stuck to the view that the recent rise in inflation will prove transitory, given its origins in supply and labor market bottlenecks that will in time get worked out.But not all are completely convinced. Speaking late Monday, Kansas City Fed President Esther George noted the ""tremendous"" amount of fiscal stimulus that has been pumped into the economy and said she is ""not inclined to dismiss today's pricing signals or to be overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.""Clarida on Tuesday said he believes that the Fed will be able to curb any outbreak of inflation with tough talk and more modest rate hikes that would allow economic growth to continue.The Fed will get new inflation data on Friday, with forecasters expecting that prices for personal consumption goods excluding food and energy rose at a 2.9% annual rate in April. That would be the highest reading since June 1993 and beyond the Fed's 2% inflation target.The Fed meets next on June 15-16."
I am excited to buy this at 6.
This will pop to $15+ some day soon. Long term it’ll go back to $20.
"KeyCorp ( KEY ), Bank Stocks the only sector to gain from rising rate fears. upgraded to bullish."
"Higher GDP numbers, means fed may raise interest rate one time this year which will help KEY and all banks. Hang in there longs, you are about to be rewarded."
Last night CFRA reiterated their buy rating with a $21 PT. A forward P/E of 11.2x their 2019 EPS estimate of $1.91
Solid result in Oct and I will continue to buy KEY
Almost 16 mil shares short hoping to get your shares before it hits $22
"This is James the ll, why is this site dead. I have major interests, 10 K in this bank. I also have a business account with Key bank in Oregon. My bank in Oregon is always busy. Sometimes parking is hard to get!! I started accumulating shares @ 8 dollars and some at 21. Would someone please use this site!!!"
Nice boost to dividend (42%) pushing yield to 3.4% and staying around 50% payout ratio (TTM) and around 33% with respect to 2018 projected income.
Just bought 2.5% of their shares back at $19.87. good move
Regional banks taking a hit today for some reason.
KEY reached a new 52 Week High at 21.16
@Retireyung - Next few quarters will be rough for all bank stocks. KEY dividend is currently .185/share per quarter & KEY next quarter earnings estimate is .12/share. Not good when you can't cover dividend payment from earnings. This is what the FED was talking about in their CCAR release yesterday afternoon. & why bank stocks are being sold off today.
"Up 3.4% today on very, very heavy volume. About half a buck from year high; feeling good about this."
Dividend is fine just the way it is. more Fed helicopter money will cause KEY to surge in price
Seeking Alpha out today with some suggestions on M&A candidates mentions Key in 2020
I am not a short and own 10s of thousands of shares. You got it wrong. I have owned for over 10 years and hope it rockets. Let's see if we hold
Someone is accumulating Key stock. Volume is up but stock has been static for a year.
"KEY in this weeks Barrons article, will do better in a lower rate environment thanks to their savvy hedging. Good luck longs on Tue earnings BMO."
Who is investing all this money in key? 6 billion in revenue and 1.3 in earrings in with a 21 billion market cap. How can future news be positive for banks?
Appears none of the regional banks announced any planned dividend raises to date... or did i miss it?
I guess that Key will be next one get acquired after BB&T & Suntrust merger. Quality assets and management. Share buyback continues to make this stock a value
"Royal Bank Canada is looking for US banks to acquire. Hopefully, KEY high quality attracts the bid."
Good Luck Longs with Earnings tomorrow BMO. Hope they have positive guidance.
KEY downgraded by Piper Sandler today from OVERWEIGHT to NEUTRAL. Price target $20.50.
When was the last time KEY had an 89% institutional ownership? Wow!
Bank and Energy companies are the ones that will have a great potential to go higher.Buy at any pullback.
Has KEY announced its CCAR plans?
"KEY 2020 Q4 earnings was excellent. Beat revenues $1.85B actual vs $1.72B expected.Beat earnings .56/share actual vs .42/share expected. Earnings were helped by the release of some loan loss reserves. Key also announced a $900 million share buyback, which should bolster stock price. Listen to the conference call for any forward-looking details that might affect share price."
Definitely glad to have purchased shares last Friday. No doubts at all about this well run company. The nice dividend is a bonus.
"If you think KEY is going to beat earnings, Thumbs up, if not Thumbs down."
"If there was ever a Time for Regional Bank Mergers and Acquisitions , this would be it . A Merger of Key Bank and Regions Financial would be a Great fit . Only my opinion . I believe the Two Banks combined would unlock a lot of Value for shareholders . It would result in Big cost savings , which a portion could be passed to customers in the way of savings on many Banking services without reducing Profit Margins ."
"Congrats KEY, another 52 week high of $22.89."
(http://Rightpicker.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
"Yep, Key raise prime rate which is absolutely positive for earnings."
Nice action today closing at HOD. Good job longs. Patience rewards....
"Nice beat Big Dog. Stock is down due to “buy on the rumor, sell on the news.”. Will bounce right back."
Dividend payment tomorrow. Reinvesting at a fairly low price.
why are all the banks tanking?
do you people really think there's money to be made in Bank stocks it is a conservative investment you won't lose you won't gain much. if you really want to make money go somewhere else.
"Key Bank was one of the very few banks that wasn't a player in the 08 financial crisis, yet their stock has been valued and trades like it is pariah."
KEY reached a new 52 Week High at 20.80
$KEY.CA Target Up CIBC World Markets Outperform CAD 32
I am with Warren Buffett on banks and insurance
Great job KEY on Q2. Baird upgraded KEY from $18 to $19.
Big volume today...news? Takeover? Dividend increase?
Key Corp remains an attractive target for buy out
KEY announced a new $1.5B share repurchase and is evaluating dividend increase for Q42021. Bottom line increased substantially to $698m vs $159m YoY. Purchased 300 million shares last quarter.
Wow! I didn't expect this to pop. Wish i were holding more than 50 shares.
Key is a real disappointment.
"KEY is down around 30% from its highs. Seems rather harsh. OK, interest rates have been troublesome the last couple of weeks, but KEY has weathered tough interest rates for the last couple of years. With tax reductions, regulation reductions, efficiency improvements, and a strong economy, KEY is still one of the best large regional banks."
"Read what the top hedge fund managers are putting money into today. Yes, that's right...KEY. Load up any time now. it's taking the stairs back up"
The key to success is not to own Key
Pre Covid this was roughly 20. Many other FIs have made a ton more progress on returning to pre Covid levels. I think that with some positive news on Covid vaccines this is going to pop big time. I saw a recent upgrade by RBC....
Good job Longs. Another good day. Inching towards that $18. Soon....
"Can they maintain the dividend, thoughts?"
In at $20.16
"KEY good volume today, help from 10yr treasury 2.96%. Still waiting for the upgrades. Hope Deutsche bank and Argus raise to $25 or higher price target any day now."
Deutsche Bank Upgrades KeyCorp to Buy From Hold
Great job Beth at Investors Day. KEY stock on the upswing plus $200m cost savings for 2019.
I’m considering adding to my position in KEY next week after looking into a few things over the weekend . Presently of all the banks I own key is the least weight of my group of bank stocks.Call it a rebalance so to speak .
#KEY Volume coming in. Technical indicators are looking bullish at stoxline. Looking for breakout at 21.91 with a short term target of 25.59.
"This week in Barrons, article say Bank Mergers pick up heading into 2021. After HBAN announce plans to acquire TCF. Someone will buy KEY. They are a well managed bank with good balance sheet."
I am a buyer here !!!!
"Monday, Aug. 2 Canadian stocks market are closed for a Civic holiday, it give you extra time to re-evaluate your position with KEY.Here is what 10 analysts are forecasting for Keyera:Average: $ 34.40 (CDN)LOW: $ 29.00 (CDN)High: $ 37.00 (CDN)Actual: 52 wks low: $ 18.04 (CDN) 52 wks high: $ 35.75 (CDN)IMHO, based on historical statistics September is the worst month of the year for investing. So far, Key in the same time has almost double its value. I think we are due for some profit taking. Stocks trading is not linear, there is UPS and DOWNS as well so because of all these facts, I put an open order to add more @ $ 31.00 (CDN) -- GL all."
Gerald Cassidy of RBC on Fast Money says that banks will not only raise dividends but will make up for last years hold. So expecting bigger payouts plus share repurchase.
Nice pop today! Huge volume.
so far the guy who bought all those July 12.5 calls has got to be upset
Congrats to our new CEO. Go get ‘m Big Boy!!
Impressive earning
"KEY has confirmed that earnings will be announced Thursday. The consensus earnings are $0.46, with a high and low of $0.50 and $0.37, respectively. I don't expect this stock to move much either way until earnings are reported. If the earnings beat the high expectation of $0.50 per share, I think that bells are going to be set off at several larger banks and a bidding war for this company may ensue. I am long, patient and looking to increase my holdings on any pullback in price."
"Looking at the Chart, KEY seems to be at the end of a pennant formation. Hoping for a breakout in the next few days! Some resistance at $13 but a clear shot to $20 after that... we will see if it stalls at 13."
"Wow, return on equity is 17.5 on strong quarter with across the board increase efficiency ratio. Great execution and job well done with continuous share buy back to return money to share holders."
Great earnings report. Should be a 25.00 stock.
Its going to be a good day for KEY and the whole sector tomorrow.
"IMO regional bank mergers/acquisitions won't start to occur until the Covid situation is more controlled & the USA has mostly re-opened for business again. Currently too much uncertainty as to the extent of loans that will default & the near zero interest rates will result in reduced profits for the banks until interest rates start to rise. Hard to value any bank now because they all declined to provide forward Q2 guidance on their Q1 earnings release. Banks are so busy with servicing existing loans & processing new loans currently that they probably do not have the time/resources to start due diligence on a merger/acquisition. It is a complicated process.They may be a buyer of smaller banks instead of a target. Barrons said that there were 263 bank mergers last year, mostly tiny community banks being acquired by larger regional banks.But in these uncertain times, who knows what can happen? The banks will do whatever makes financial sense to them under the circumstances that they are in.IMO we really need to somehow get the USA open for business quickly. We just can't operate with 33+ million unemployment claims & small/medium business bankruptcies. That is what will really hurt the bank stocks.Seems that all regional banks are getting sold off today after Friday's run up. Not sure why."
"Next resistance level for KEY is $22.15. Its 5yr high. Motley Fool came out with article stating that HSBC, KEY and RF are potential targets for US Bank, Citizens and Fifth Third. If you look at the KRE, its up 33% YTD, while KEY is only 25% so some potential catching up to do plus there PE is lower than its peers. Plus, with the 10yr hitting new highs today, they could surprise on Q1 Earnings next month."
"Hoping to pick this up just less than $19, if the chance arises....Things are looking up and great buy and hold stock to collect the nice dividend and sell calls."
Key is so cheap that it will attract acqusition and buyout offers.
I can sit on KEY for a year or two and collect 4.6% per annum dividend.
"Wow, this decline is breathtaking. I bought a little more today at $14.73..........with average 2020 earnings estimate at $1.88, that's a ridiculous 7.8 PE for a quality bank. Even if Key cuts earnings a bit this price is nuts."
"Citi 22%%% increase in EPS is indicative the best earnings of banks ate ahead and continue to grow as the JPM CEO saying that it is the golddie period. Interest rate is still very low, inflation is low, full employment. low debt level of consumers. The bull market will still have 2 to 3 years to run at least"
"Market down huge, Key up, thats good. Something is going on here !"
#KEY Volume is good. Stochastic oscillator and RSI go green. Long over 21.05 for a run up to 24.59.
"M&T had good earnings. Lets hope same with KEY, plus div increase."
KEY was featured in this weeks Barron's article as spotting income in the Regional Banks.
17 mil shares short working so hard to get your shares before this hits $22. How many upgrades tomorrow.
"good luck to you all. no shared thoughts, no conversation. everybody is on their own. this is a safe haven as far as stocks go. losses will be smaller then many other stocks, but games will also be smaller. this type of stock is what my financial guy takes care of."
"publicly available info: insider purchases this month 04/2020 104,485 shares, value...$1,085,783.I'm in for a few hundred shares..."
Only own this and JPM. Bought in May will hold for life
"Another regional bank merger BancorpSouth Bank and Cadence Bancorp. Though quite small, market cap of both banks are around $3B compared to KEY $20B. Its going to happen. Scale is KEY."
"KeyCorp price target raised to $23 from $20 at RBC Capital RBC Capital analyst Gerard Cassidy raised the firm's price target on KeyCorp to $23 from $20 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares after its Q1 earnings beat. The company has been ""rebuilt, de-risked, and better-managed"", proving to investors that it is not the ""KeyCorp of old"" when it collapsed during the 2008 GFC from the weight of its non-performing assets, the analyst tells investors in a research note."
KEY is cheap and may attract buyout offer
"KEY and all the banks passed CCAR. Dividends and share repurchases next week Mon/Tue, just the beginning for the banks. DCF for KEY is $23.28 so pretty good discount at current prices. Enjoy the ride longs."
"This professional equity research analyst is BULLish on $FITB, also $KEY and $CFG:https://www.twst.com/news/wedbush-securities-best-street-banking-analyst-picks-best-regional-bank-stocks/"
"Volume is almost non-existent. Even when China and the US are holding off battering each other with tariffs for a while. Even Powell is holding off on interest rate raising. Am I wrong? Missing something? The minute this goes up enough, I'm history."
"BMO gave a downgrade to KEY to $17, saying it cant meet its efficiency goals. I guess they didnt see they are closing branches to become more efficient due to its digital transformation. KEY is a well run company. Next target is for them to break 200 day MA."
"The earning report indicated the return on tangible common equity was over 13%, the new target of 15% to 18% is extremely bullish"
KEY reached a new 52 Week High at 21.01
"Heavy volume today. Stock is going over $22. New lower highs, plus x-div next monday."
"@Anonymous - You really are a sphincter. I have no idea if KEY will be acquired or acquire another bank - never even mentioned it. ""Little Chrissy ain't know Jaime D""? Really? Did you even make it through high school? Jamie Dimon is CEO of JPM - a much larger investment bank. Very different from a regional bank like KEY. New CEO Chris Gorman seems like a good choice, why not give him a chance?"
has anyone besides me blocked anonymous if not why not
"Key looks like it has some support here. I have quite a bit of Key. I bought very low a few years back, but then I bought a couple of thousand more at a few dollars higher. Heard an analyst say FED's comments next week could help the sector concerning future rate hikes. He also predicted a gradual normalization of the yield curve. If he is accurate, Key should benefit. I did sell a big chunk of NWBI today as it has held up very well, but I feared it would get sucked down along with the sector. I still have a very large banking exposure, but I hope stocks like BTO and NYCB will hold and eventually rebound. Besides the negative market, I am also disturbed by Trump's woes. He seems to be getting in deeper and deeper trouble, and he spends most of his time tweeting or throwing tantrums. His corporate tax cuts were great for the market, but his undisciplined tariff negotiations and personal behavior is starting to get frightening."
Good luck Longs on Earnings report tomorrow morning. Thumbs up if you think above $22.15 resistance level or thumbs down below.
Going to 30$
"I purchased 800 shares at $16.50 in late August. I am typically a long term investor and was attracted to Key for it's dividend; the fact that financials have yet to participate in the recent stock market rally; as a partial hedge against my bond holdings; and most importantly because I believe that in the coming 2 years, due to the low level of interest rates, there will be a spike in consolidations in the financial industry and I think that this bank could be a candidate for a takeover from a major bank."
"KEY just announced that they are paying $.185/share dividend for Q2. Same as Q1. Good news.Ex-Div date id 06/02/2020, payable 06/15/2020."
"With a dividend of +4% they must be an acquisotion target. Who could buy them out without regulatory red flag with current gov't admin? Best case they get an offer that fails for regulatory and they get paid a cool billion for deal not closing, then repeat the whole thing a few years from now."
"Morgan Stanley found its Gorman CEO a few years ago and he has been superb. In a few short weeks, Key’s Gorman takes the helm. Just watch him work his magic! Go Chris!!"
"I was trying to catch the low yesterday and missed somewhat, but 150 shares @ $13.22 will work out fine me thinks"
"KEY PAY MORE DIVIDEND THAN IT EARNED, IT IS BECOMING UNSUSTAINABLE, share will fall. SELL"
I am in today at 12.30 but a 8 PE is not sexy sadly. Only a tech pe of 500 is worth investing in. Like Zoom or Tesla
"payout ratio is still at 32% only. Key still has lots of room to increase buy back, dividend or acquisition. The last acquisition synergy is gradually showing and it can be the acquisition target as well. ."
What are we thinking? 19.5?
They had some interesting insights about KEY on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Conference call over. I would suggest that people log on to the KEY website & review the slide presentation - lots of good information. Q2 results were not great or terrible. EPS down significantly due to near zero FED interest rates. KEY added to loan loss reserves in anticipation of future loan defaults. The .16/share EPS puts a little pressure on the .185 quarterly dividend.KEY did not provide future guidance for Q3.IMO, KEY is in the same situation as nearly all other regional banks. Profits will be reduced for the foreseeable future as long as interest rates are near zero. Key has an exposure to future loan defaults that will hopefully be covered by their loan provisions. The virus situation will have an effect on the loan losses as high unemployment & business closures will contribute to loan defaults. IMO, KEY & all other regional banks are in a trading range until interest rates rise, vaccine becomes available or virus situation gets worse."
"Are any of the regionals considering a dividend raise, or just a share buyback?"
Good time to add more. Currently Buy rating.
increased stake yesterday to 3000 shares at an avg of $16.65. That is a 4.08% yield.The shares under $16 were a surprise gift. I have a feeling that this will not be under $17 for long
"Even though rate cuts are likely, buy regional bank stocks like $pnc $key $mtb. They hedge against rate cuts and go through stress test to have sufficient capital and liquidity to withstand situations like this, plus they offer decent dividends."
Key has a PE less than 10. It is very low when compared to other banks> undervalued!
KEY announced .18 dividend payable March 15. Hope they announce an div increase on earnings and update to capital plan next Thur.
"payout ratio is only32%, lots of room to grow both in dividend and stock price"
"What tyaders did not know was that Key return on equity on last quarter of 13 percent was impressive. The new target of 15% to 18% will blow the shocks off and looks even more confident and impressive. Best regional bank in my view, any other suggestions ?"
Starting to feel like being in a life boat watching the ship sink. lost $4 a share so far. Is there any turnaround in site. I don't have the binoculars.
Raise Div. 5cents and it will rocket.
"KEY announced dividend for Q3, remains at .184. So disappointing. =("
"Anyone else long on key? I keep waiting for a positive day but it can’t snap out of it. Long term Interest rates are higher than they were a year ago, two years ago, etc. key should be fine."
All bank stocks up huge in past 2 days due to Georgia senate elections going all democratic. This caused the 10-year treasury bill yield to go over 1.0%. It is up again today to 1.08%. The steepening of the yield curve means that banks will make more $$$ on their loans. Keep an eye on the 10-year T-Bill yield for further gains/losses.
Nomura at it again. Within about 10 wks they raised PT to $22 then less than a mo later downgraded with an $18 PT and downgrades again. How many of those 14 mil shares short do they hold and is today the day they start covering as vol should be up.
Key Bank has great upside potential. Feds can’t make prime rate any lower which means what for Key Bank in future. Sooner or later the Fed is going to increase the rate. Higher the rate more bank profits which would make Key share price go way upward. Buy the stock now and be patient Look at historical prices of Key Bank. The experts always like to downgrade a stock when price is low and same experts never say it’s a Buy until it’s too late. Recently a prefect example is airline stocks - when they were low - nobody recommended a Buy - stocks take off and bunch of Buys came out on airlines when it was too late. Key is a buy now under $12 - not when the stock hits $18
Buy keynote with C leading the banking sector
Just as I suggested - the post earnings drop was simply “buy on the rumor; sell on the news”. We’re right back to pre-earnings levels. Keep barking BIG DOG. You da man!
Fed announced less regulation for banks in four tiers based on assets size over $100b. KEY is $137b as of last year balance sheet. The smaller you are reduced annual stress test and other regulations. Good for KEY.
"About 2 mil shares short covered last month, with ex div on 8/30 how many of the 13+ mil shares still short are trying to get your shares? Hold tight!"
bought a hundred shares today at 10...I couldn't resist..seemed like a steal at that price
TD acquiring KEY is near
The 21st expect a big bounce upward!!
Ok. Hey Beth. Where's my penny increase. wow.
"short of a 1.8pc rise tomorrow, my calls are going to expire worthless"
"Topline rev miss is always disappointing. But the bigger picture is the div increase and share buyback and the capital efficiency ratio. All looking good, div increase means mgmt belief in the business growing and the capital efficiency ratio continues to go down meaning they are controlling costs effectively. Of course, you all know someone is going to comment today. I'm sure he is a cooler at vegas."
14 mil shares short working to get your shares at this low level! KEY is down 1.2% and the KRE is only down .62%. Hold tight. Don't give away your shares.
"Happy Palm Sunday to all. No disrespect to Beth, but Chris Gorman is perhaps the best groomed CEO-to-be in the banking industry. He will take the reigns at the most perilous time in American history and will make us all proud. Key is a massive buy down here. GO CHRIS!!"
Can this company make me a new set of house keys?
"Okay. Keys at $17. JPMorgan went from $30 to $100, BAC went from $8 to $30. And you Motons live The Moon and think she is doing a Great Job. Yea Right."
Seems like a great buy at these levels and I do not anticipate a cut to dividend.
"Man, Key has really been hit hard. I can't believe things have deteriorated so badly. Unless they have a lot of loans out to shale oil companies, this seems way overdone."
Average target price from analysts are above 19.. Way to go! I like it's return on equity has increased to over 12% now. The whole banking industry is getting more and more profitable. They should be able to achieve over 15% ROE long term
A beat on earnings and another dividend raise will get Key out of the cellar.
"All the big banks JPM, C, BAC, WFC had increases in net interest margin for the first time in almost 2yrs. That is bullish. I expect KEY to do the same. Plus, dividend increase announcement should come next week as well."
"I just reviewed the KEY Goldman Sach's presentation on Dec. 4th. Everything looked pretty positive. So what changed in the last six days that made the stock tumble so much. Was it fear or fundamentals? I think program trading has the market twisting and turning dramatically. I believe the presentation stated that KEY had repurchased something like $900 million in stock. Hey, at these levels, Key should load up and take advantage of the fire sale. Good luck!"
"picked up some at $15.90, a yield of 4.65%Will buy more at $15 if it gets there. I would be happier if it didn't"
just got into this stock. hoping to exit at about $27 in about 30 days. what are the thoughts on this?
"@gary - KEY has a tangible book value of approx $15/share, $5 stock price is never going to happen unless the entire USA economy collapses.All regional banks will have a rough Q3/Q4 due to those low interest rates & loan defaults by small/medium businesses & consumer loans. Plus reduced profits in Q3/Q4 will put their dividends in jeopardy.Regional banks are cyclical & the time to invest in them is when they are near multi-year lows. Expect a huge pop in bank stock prices when the USA FDA approves a COVID-19 vaccine towards the end of 2020."
Good stock for both capital gains and income. I'm a fan.
Heading for a 50% discount from normal (pre-Covid 19) price. Somewhere in here is a good buy opportunity for longs
Glad I got out in the last rally. Should have done it back in January. Never expected banks to be hit so hard while tech stocks perform so well. I expect tech stocks will be hit eventually. It is difficult to see the economy get hit but tech gets completely exempted.
"Thank you Nomura, upgrade today from Reduce to Neutral and $16 price target."
A year ago share price was about $23.50 and KEY is now much better financially positioned. Buy now and get a nice divi
NASDAQ website has STRONG BUY.. Target Price is $87.47 for $SNAP based on the these analysts: $JPM $MS $KEY $RJS $TFS $JEF Evercore Oppenhiemer PiperSandler WebBush .. all leading analysts. Fake news my but!!!! Just the facts!!!
RF announced a dividend increase.
Oh ya. Looking for a great call followed by 22 (the Double Duce!!).
M&T buy People United in all cash deal and created combined company of $200B in assets. They should have bought out KEY. At least new 52 week high. KEY is going to $25 with the 10yr treasury still has room to go up to 1.5-2% according to analysts.
AN a new low for the day. Not a good sign for earnings.
Tough time to be holding.

"CNN's Chris Cuomo: 'I don't like what I do professionally'“I don’t want to spend my time doing things that I don’t think are valuable enough to me personally,” Cuomo said. “I don’t value indulging the rationality, hyper-partisanship.”https://www.foxnews.com/media/cuomo-i-dont-like-what-i-do-professionally"
Financial momentum will finally lead us higher! Let’s go! KEY for the win
As posted on the NYCB Message Board:Here’s the deal that makes the most sense: KEY takes out NYCB circa 18. NYCB footprint fits perfectly with KEYs needs in NYC market. KEY’s new CEO since May is a cap markets guy turned banker who led their First Niagara acquisition and integration. He and Cangemi are a perfect fit as TC will run NYC banking. Thoughts???
"Those of you who follow Key Corp. will remember about 15 years ago an Executive in the International Division stole over $40 million by loan money to foreign banks that were no longer in business, He had condos in New York, a stable of expensive cars, a wife and kids but also a hot girls friend he lavished with millions. No one ever lost there job as the internal and external audits were both asleep. Henry Meyer was also asleep or MIA.Now we have a business client who was smart enough to swindle the bank out of $90 million. You would have thought they would have tightened controls years ago."
Bought more today !
KEY being driven down by weakness in the KRE. Despite a good earnings report. Rev up 12.64% and earnings per share up 16.67%. Buying opportunity.
Tomorrow is here. I put over 10% into big banks mid March. Things look good. this AM. plan to hold through dividend increase season (June|July).
"Kramer likes KEY on mad money. Beth did a good interview on cnbc. She said there is a disconnect of the perception of the economy and her views of the business. From that, its going to be a good Q1 earnings on April 18."
Anonymous. The sky is not falling. Geez! Rebound from here...

"Earnings looked great, I will keep buying on the dips."
Does this company make keys?
I am the bottom fisherman here. Have 6K now. Bought at 8 to 21. My problem is deversifacation. I like this stock and it has a good story going forward. I am watching it go straight down. Where is the bottom ?
When are banks going to announce their CCAR plans?
So many experts claimed the market would drop 10% if the democrats controlled the senate! Where are those experts now?
I bought today near the close. I think KEY is positioned very well and this is a $30+ stock by Feb 2019.
