Looking for 31.25 -31.40 by Tuesday. BGS our solid stock investment.
If you are on the side of thinking that we will need 90% vaccinated for herd immunity we are a long ways from getting there. The R0 of the delta variant is so much higher than the original virus causing this 90% hurdle. This is a real downer because 90% seems like an insurmountable mountain to climb with so many skeptics on getting vaccinated. From an investment standpoint BGS will continue to prosper under a eat-at-home environment for awhile.
Impressive move today especially since it is an ex-dividend day. It is basically proving to be a solid defensive stock K and KHC in green too
"Increase in snap benefits of 27% starting in October, should see a good bump in revenue from that."
Food stocks will be fine. BGS is still looking good. Pre divy 30.50? No problem.

P&G raising prices. Who would have guessed. B&G will be too. As will everyone else. My neighbors can't remodel their deck due to parts not being available. That's called stagflation.
