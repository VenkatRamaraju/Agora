Stock back to over $30 where it should be. Hope people took advantage of the dip.
So you're saying that the EPS is now higher than the dividend? And there are still shorts out there holding onto the bag?
"I hold over 30 issues, only two were green today. BGS and a muni..."
"From a marketwatch editorial: ""Coronavirus-related grocery shopping is clearing shelves at retailers across the country, giving consumers a chance to taste-test items they may not have wanted to try before, experts say. Symphony RetailAI, a marketing, merchandising and supply chain solutions platform, said that with high demand for frozen pizza leading to products being ""out-of-stock"", customers are trying gluten-free varieties. ""One of the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on grocery and categories is that customers are expanding their purchases well beyond their normal choices,"" said Kevin Sterneckert, chief marketing officer at Symphony RetailAI. Retailers may regard gluten-free pizza as a specialty item with a very prescribed purchase volume, but now, customers are happy to have any pizza if they can't have their first choice. Customers are trying new items and brands with characteristics that they wouldn't have tried prior to the COVID crisis, and this will likely continue in the future, as customers become exposed to new products."" Customers are even more willing to make their own pizzas at home, with Dean Banks, president of Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) telling MarketWatch that packs of pepperoni are a popular item to use as a topping. Data from Symphony RetailAI shows that basket size has expanded more than 60% during the Covid-19 outbreak as families stay home to meet social-distancing guidelines. And data provided by AlixPartners shows that 65% of consumers have tried a new national or private-label brand amid ""shelter-in-place"" orders. Nearly four out of five (79%) did so because an item was out of stock. Sources MarketWatch has spoken with say there's no shortage of food in the U.S. Still, even major retailers are struggling to keep shelves stocked. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP) has climbed 6.8% over the past year as the S&P 500 index has fallen 2.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average as tumbled 9.4%. ""You've handled unbelievable surges in demand which have quickly been followed by out of stocks,"" said Walmart Inc. (WMT) Chief Executive Doug McMillon in a letter to U.S.-based store associates posted to the company website, thanking them for their work.""Sure seems like this should be a good sign for green giant cauliflower crusts and cauliflower crust pizzas. As well as every other brand and product BGS sells."
"Classic trend reversal. Since the double bottom at the end of October, 2 higher highs and 2 higher lows. A close above $17.63 would be a 3rd higher high. Buyers have taken control."
"Are folks in this for the dividend only, or also share price appreciation?"
"Last I noticed, shorts were up to 32%. What do they see, Bob, that the rest of us don't see? Is it weak earnings? Guidance is about $2.20, not counting Crisco, so steady state earnings could be $2.70. But wait, Covid is ending so earnings may collapse. To what, $1.60 from last year, plus Crisco, so $2.10 next year?? Both of these scenarios result in 2021 PE of 12-14, clearly low for the market, even for food sector. Try comparing valuation to TWNK. It is off the charts compared to BGS.How about the debt? The banks were comfortable enough with prospects and free cash flow to re-up the debt and extend it. Interest at 5% will cost about $75MM and free cash flow will be close to $400MM, enough to cover interest, dividends and leave over $200MM to pay down debt, buy more accretive companies or increase the dividend.OK, how about management. There's a question there. How much will it or should it hurt the stock price. I suspect there are loads of good food managers around.When the shorts decide that they have had enough of good news and paying dividends, this goes to at least $35 if not more."
The share price players not happy today ?
What is the discussion about BRK and BGS about? Is there some actual news on that or are you guys just hoping? I see a lot of negative stuff on this board regarding them needing to cut that dividend but negative on buying back shares. The easiest way to reduce their dividend is to reduce the number of outstanding shares. Why would you pay down 5% debt and keep paying a 10% dividend when you can reduce the share count and greatly enhance the company financials. This company will greatly benefit with a much larger repurchase plan!
"BGS Facts: BGS last EX-DIV date actually closed higher, and did so 2 of last 4 EX-DIV dates. Avg volume of 933K on last 17 EX-DIV dates. Institutional shorts are bailing during this quarter by a margin of 2.5 to 1. More conservative Institutional investors are adding shares such as PA, NY, TX and GA teacher unions, the Lutheran Church and State of Tennessee Treasury Department. The Shorts carrying cost on this stock is at 7.82%, and just cost them $8M in total. THANK YOU BGS SHORTS! BUY AND HOLD BGS!"
"Just re-listening to the conference call comments by Bruce Wacha from November. They expected 2020 earnings (excl Crisco) of $2.30-2.40 a share and estimate that Crisco would add another $0.45-.50. So at the lower end, they are likely to make $2.75 a share and still be at the 5-5.1 leverage rate. So if we go back to the 18x p/e ratio... that puts our share price target at around $49-50 bucks. Let's EAT!!!"
At the 1Q report management reaffirmed their yearly guidance which would include dividend payments as currently set. So unless something precipitous has happened to the downside we should expect dividends to continue as projected.
"B&G Foods Declares Regular Quarterly DividendPARSIPPANY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- B&G Foods, Inc.

Merrill Edge Stock Technical Analysis shows Double bottom breakout with target of $19.70 in 21 days
"Company delivered. Romanzi directly addressed the ""elephant in the room"" of dividend coverage, debt leverage and acquisition opportunities for 2020. They are clearly well positioned with new plant-based product offerings in the pipeline. $20 mil growth expected in Green Giant for 2019. Working Capital improvement expected in $35-40 mil range. Will increase the cushion between cash dividend and cash flow in 2020 while lowering debt to EBITDA leverage under 6. Seriously, this is a food business company and a fairly predictable business. Management is astute in growing the business. The stock price has been trading like a technology company.I found it interesting that the analysts have been fooled by recent scanner pricing in Green Giant."
Guess they need to cover their dividend with this potential share issuance.
"Cha-Ching! B&G Foods at the top!Packaged food sales were up 7.5% over the last four weeks and accelerated to a 9.2% pace over the last week tracked, per new Nielsen data.Dollar sales were strong for Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) +12.6%, McCormick & Co, (NYSE:MKC) +12.8%, Flower Foods (NYSE:FLO) +15.2%, B&G Foods (NYSE:BGS) +15.7% and ConAgra (NYSE:CAG) +9.7% for the four-week tracking period.Once again, the category with the strongest growth was the ingredient catch-all (extracts/herbs/spices/seasoning) as at-home cooking remains elevated."
Not going to tell anyone what to do you need to decide for yourself what is the right investment choice. However I'm holding at this point. 1) The stock is moving in the right direction. Good numbers form EC. 2) The only thing holding this from being a 35 to 40 dollar stock is a lot of shorts manipulating. 3) I don't think the short busters are done by a long shot. It could hit 50. ) For those who don't know this stock only has 64 million shares outstanding whereas AMC has 400 million. GME has a bit more then BGS with 70 million so there are not a lot shares to buy up. Your mileage may very.
They filed a shelf registration and immediately they adjusted the stock price for the full dilution as if all the stock had been sold. I bought some more.
Short covering will start as soon as TTM EPS exceeds the annual dividend of $1.90. Should be once Q3 is announced.
"Today's Motley Fool article tries real hard to bring back the FUD factor with BGS stock, literally speculating that ""Wall Street"" might well tack a lower price on the stock as a discount for RISK.Also states that if not for Crisco, sales would be weak."
Reduced net debt $170M. Total debt reduced to $1.7B. Officially suspended further 2020 guidance due COVID but expecting YoY sales increases to continue. Nothing discussed in this Earnings Release call is good news for SHORTS! STAY LONG BGS!!!
"Management reported the value of the brands as of 12/31/18 was 179% of amortized carrying value. Just adding 20% appreciation to the brands gives a book value of $15. I just bought more @ $14.93. What did I get? I got a stock below ""adjusted book earning $1.95 per share (GAAP low-end of $1.65 plus the fictitious 30 cents brand amortization expense). What on earth am I missing?"
Buyer under $27
"Latest sales data from Credit Suisse has BGS sales down -6.2% in the 4wk period ending 11/16 vs the same year ago period. The late Thanksgiving may account for the increasingly negative data trend. The next report due out in two weeks will cover the period ending 11/30 and should give a clearer picture of sales. Volume sales were -12.0% partially offset by +6.7 higher unit pricing. It's possible the company is selling less, but at a greater margin so the impact on earnings is not clear."
"CFO exercise of 23,260 shares of derivative security at price 26.80 per share and sold them all at 33.78 according to Yahoo Finance Insider Trading. Gives you confidence in the stock going higher.It's always great when an insider is kind enough to sell his shares to the mass of investors."
"next probable earnings call date for BGS should be about July 29, 2021. the number of shorted shares has dropped about 17% from 16 million to 13 million. I never do shorting of stocks. BGS should take some inflation impact but have good earnings and pay high dividend. our stock pays out most of itsxearnings as dividends. it is almost like a REIT except it is a Food Enabling Investment Trust, a FEIT, and the high dividend is a great FEAT too!https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=BGS"
So much for the short squeeze before the ex dividend date.
"This stock has larger moves than most. Low volume yet the price drops like there has been some sort of negative news about revenue or earnings, etc. Zacks should have virtually no effect on the stock price in my opinion so when they say ""sell"" it should not cause a significant run on sales of the stock.There are no institutional or investment fund sales that I am aware of so it must be retail holders getting cold feet. If brokers are somehow involved in this price action I would like to know how to confirm that.I don't see evidence of a new short sale attack."
"BGS need not raise their dividend again at this point. I am waiting for earnings which I expect to be excellent due to the additional earnings from Crisco acquisition. And, the pandemic is far from gone so people are still cooking at home and will be for a long time.Also, would like to see an announcement for a new leader at BGS. No clear guidance on why Mr. Romanzi left, have to assume that his vision for BGS did not align with that of the Board. A new, energetic leader with a vision similar to the Board would merit a higher stock price."
"A paradigm shift is happening with consumer food habits that will favor B&G Foods for a long time. We are not going back to ""normal"" as some want us to think. The article below begins to quantify some of these changes for us. I agree there will be more online purchasing which I think really helps BGS because of their brand names, especially Green Giant and Ortega. Consumers are much more inclined to buy a familiar brand name than something kind of unknown when buying online even if it costs a little more. It will take a little time for many to recognize this trend but those who get it will prosper. Q2 is going to look awesome. https://www.manufacturing.net/home/blog/21133823/how-covid19-has-impacted-consumer-food-habits"
"Analyst Michael Lavery boosted his rating on Kraft Heinz (ticker: KHC) to Overweight from Neutral, and added $9 to his price target, to $39. He believes that “greater food at home trends [will] drive a sustainable lift at least into 2021, and Kraft Heinz is well-positioned with a largely meal-oriented portfolio with modest food-service exposure.”BGS will be in the same boat."
ValueLine has long term price range 45-55.
Who is selling today? Why would you sell when this stock benefits from stay-at-home and just announced a big accretive acquisition.
All high short interest and potential meme stocks are issuing ATM programs so they can take advantage if this rockets above 40 again. This shouldn't change bulls or bears so take advantage of the volatility
"Why are they (Yahoo) saying this is an overvalued stock? When I consider the value of a new holding I use a value-comparison method of determining the value. If the industry average PE is about 17.9, then the price is to low for this stock, making it undervalued (price would be about $21..). Another value tool is the DY%, need I say much more?"
"Guidance for 2020 is Adj. EPS of $2.30- $2.40. With Crisco, on a pro forma basis 2020 Adj. EPS is $2.80 - $2.90 per share. Do the shorts really think they can't keep paying $1.90 in dividends?"
"B&G Foods Inc (NYSE: BGS) has signed an agreement to sell its Portland, Maine manufacturing facility and 13.5-acre waterfront property to the Institute for Digital Engineering and Life Sciences for an undisclosed sum. Real Estate is called that for a reason. $$$$$$"
"It would be instructional for shareholders to listen to the recent conference call available on the BG foods website under ""investors/events"", paying special attention to the Bank of America analysts question regarding dividend safety for the rest of the year and the response from the management team. Should calm your nerves a bit. (It is at the 49:15 mark in the recording)"
"CNBC: Dividend is safe. Who you gonna believe, the professional trader or GIUSEPPE?"
"The shorts in this name are getting squeezed hard and it's not over yet. While the analysts might not agree this stock was $50 with weaker fundamentals. BGS is in a much better position and has a positive outlook. Crisco is going to be adding to earnings substantially. People still are going to eat at home as consumer behavior has changed. BGS is still trading cheap relative to the market. BGS is a real company, not like GME. Those who have been on this board should hang on for the ride. Earnings coming in a few weeks will validate the fundamentals."
Today is a great day to invest in BGS. The dividend is close to 11%. The ER is closing in & payday. The earnings will be better than ever. What could be safer than a food company with the included dependable consecutive dividend payments!
Shorts starting to cover pre Expirations date.
For what its worth in the last 3 months insiders have had 15 buys and 5 sells to me it shows some confidence. I am in for the long hall on this one just looks like a safe place to park a few bucks.
"Don't think anyone did the math but looked at the word dilution.Timing and amount of any sales could be today or a year from now. If there is another short attack they will be able to sell some shares at a high price. I would think this would have the affect to raise the stock price.Sell 7.5 million shares at 45 a share and pocket 330 million. That would only raise the dividend 3 million a quarter. 330 million divided by 33 million means they could pay the div for 10 quarter from the stock sale alone. That's 2 1/2 years. Then put all there cash flow on the balance sheet. I think this would scaring shorts more then anything.it may offer and sell up to 7,500,000 shares of its common stock from time to time through an ""at-the-market"" (ATM) equity offering program. The timing and amount of any sales will be determined by a variety of factors considered by B&G Foods."
I hope the new proposed increase in corp taxes doesn't have a negative effect on the stock price.
"It seems many are not seeing the forest for the trees. The almost 50% short of float interest means that BGS does not pay ""100%"" of their free cash flow in dividends, its more like 60-70%, they are using the rest to buy back shares that are beilg sold by .... the shorts ... no longs are selling right now. What this means is the % of float held by institutions is slowly creeping up, and we are heading into a VW like short squeeze, as the only people selling to covering shorts, are shorts ... BGS is buying what it can without excessively influencing the sp. Good luck shorts ... in the next 6 months you are going to need it (Hint .. when the % institutional ownership hits 105% the game is ON"""
"Yesterday's 9% drop in BGS share price is hard to understand. Other food companies held up while BGS got creamed. Nobody with a heart likes to say anything positive about the corona virus. That being said, I can't see how this is not a positive for BGS. I'd think restaurant business is already collapsing in states with reported cases. Green Giant offers ready to eat vegetable medley products which is the closest thing to restaurant veggie dishes. Also, and probably more significant is that in order to lessen trips to the grocery store, people are stocking up on food. You can't stock up on perishable vegetables, so frozen and canned vegetable sales should be on the rise. Assuming this is so, BGS is likely tweaking prices up since demand is increasing. In summary, it's likely BGS is experiencing volume and pricing increases these days. On the cost side, input cost increases have plagued the company over the past couple years and they have specifically mentioned logistics. Well, oil has just taken close to a 50% haircut. This can't help but to lower their logistics costs. The market is usually smarter than me so I must be missing something, but can't figure out what."
"This is taken from 04/29/2016. It's uncanny how similar the results are for the upcoming ER> This caused a 1 day price jump from $33 to $41.""What: Shares of B&G Foods (NYSE:BGS) were flying higher today, up 19.3% as of 11:59 a.m. ET, after delivering a strong earnings report.So what: The packaged-food maker crushed earnings estimates, posting a per-share profit of $0.65 against expectations of $0.51. Revenue jumped 62.6% with the help of recent acquisitions of Mama Mary's and Green Giant brands to $353 million, but that was short of the consensus at $360 million. Comparable sales of the base business were actually down 2%, but investors were impressed with the strong profit growth nonetheless as B&G continues to drive greater efficiencies. CEO Robert Cantwell said the Green Giant acquisition was turning out to be more profitable than the company had expected and that its innovation pipeline was growing. ""We are more excited than ever about bringing Green Giant back to prominence and I believe we have the plan and the team to make that happen,"" he added.Now what: With the acquisition of Green Giant and a 62% increase in revenue, the company is considerably different than it was a year ago, and the added profitability from the canned and frozen vegetable brand should continue to yield results. As a result of the strong quarter, management raised its guidance to revenue of $1.39-$1.42 billion, and EPS of $2.05-$2.15, better than analyst estimates of $1.95. With a strong track record of acquisitions and a dividend yield of 5%, B&G should continue to be a solid bet for income investors.""Just 3 months later BGS was at All Time High of $50.Here we go again?"
"B&G Foods is destined to continue to move up. As Americans we can't seem to accept social distancing and having less freedom under the coronavirus pandemic. We are very stubborn people that will have to learn the hard way. The trend of eating at home looks more and more long term. B&G will hugely benefit from this, and effectively take them out of being highly leveraged. Already, we are hearing the possibility of raising the dividend (albeit I don't think this is likely at all). As free cash flow builds the relative valuation should start kicking in compared to other food manufacturing companies. As others have stated this stock can move to $40 as new investors recognize the magnitude of what is happening. It wouldn't surprise me if sales growth starts picking up in August with the higher cases being reported now. Will listen to the conference call this week to get some clues."
What a beautiful play on a great dividend!!!
"This is cheap at $26. EPS will be $2.40 this year, $2.90 with Crisco. Even if all Crisco earnings are offset by reduced post-Corona EPS, it's only trading at 10-11x EPS. I'm really struggling to see why this won't go much higher with strong Q4 earnings, new CEO and Crisco.What's the counterargument?"
"The shorts will give up on this. The forecast eliminates a dividend cut. In addition short covering and just fundamental buys will take us to $19. 25 million short shares out of a float of 60MM has got to cause panic with hedge funds, Shorts also have to pay the dividend to us longs--a double wammy. BGS has the decks all cleared with debt maturities for several years. They are paying double interest right now but that will go away soon. Giddyup!"
"Many Countries around the world are suffering with big decreases in Food Production. These nationshave begun ordering for retail packaged products (canned foods and packaged foods) directly. B&G hasthe product, has been ramping up in fact, and will sell out of its entire inventory. 100% SALES GROWTH!The stock should be $50 to $60 dollars at least. FOOD GLORIOUS FOOD!"
MO increases dividend will be 7+ % yield at current price. This is for any skittish BGS holder who may fear a dividend cut or suspension here.....lol
"Just in-PARSIPPANY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 24, 2020-- B&G Foods, Inc. (NYSE: BGS) announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.475 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on April 30, 2020 to shareholders of record as of March 31, 2020."
All this chatter about how negative their debt is surprises me. Interest rates have been at record lows and look to be continuing for at least the next couple years. I can only assume the finance folks at the company have refinanced significant portions of the debt which is a net bottom line gain. May be naïve on my part but it seems to make sense.￼￼
"Plant-Based Initiative announcement by B&G Foods is a significant sign that management is paying attention to customer trends. Retail plant-based food sales in US increased 11% last to $4.5 billion last year. I find this quite positive and an exciting possibility in creating sales growth. I hope the company will talk about its strategy to participate in this recent trend towards more nutricious foods. “This is just the beginning of a massive growth period for plant-based foods,” said Caroline Bushnell, associate director of corporate engagement for The Good Food Institute. “Consumer appetite for plant-based foods is surging as consumers increasingly make the switch to foods that match their changing values and desire for more sustainable options. This growth will continue as more companies bring next-generation innovations to market that really deliver on the most important driver of consumer choice: taste.”"
"The Zachs Equity Report is quite revealing if these are reasons why the stock isn't much higher. Their #1 reasons to sell is ""Escalated SG&A Costs"". Well duh, I would expect it to be higher with much higher sales, PPE and compensation for extra hours. No mention of SG&A as a % of sales, just that it is going up on a gross basis. Even if it is going up a lot you still have to look at the bottom line and see if it's worth selling your product. Obviously, it's been worth it. Would Zacks recommend to the company not to sell more just so it can keep its SG&A cost down? #2 ""Intense competition"" of late. There's been intense competition in the sector for decades. I doubt it is harder now. If anything you can make a solid case it's less competitive with rapid rise in sales. #3 ""Risk related to the international exposure"". None of these are major reasons to sell nor related to the current stock price. No relative valuation as a basis to sell. Shouldn't price be highly relevant to buy, sell or hold? Again, it's just eye-opening that investors follow these reports blindly. I guess I shouldn't be surprised because there are still many Americans that still believe the virus isn't deadly or not worth worrying about."
AlexaYes I agree with youBut working backwards the bankers would hav learned about the missThen the stock market would alsoThe deal closed And was over subscribed Earnings should be fineRight now this seems to be in the hands of the shortsOne upgrade and this goes to 20
New article is really something. Dividend more than earnings but easily covered by free cash flow yet is still a red flag. And the debt coverage is a red flag. The stock is not a very good income stock. The stock is undervalued by about 39%. Then they offer a bunch of foreign investments as good income stocks that all yield well under what BGS offers.
"The 60% increase in sales for April was HUGE and they said May is looking very strong too. Literally, they are selling everything they are producing for retail consumers and this is not ending anytime soon. In fact, they would have sold more if they could have. Coronavirus has changed consumer behavior and without a vaccine for at least 12-18 months the wind is behind BGS. They will continue to build up brand loyalty during this time. I don't think investors realize how much it means to have a $70 mil bump in April sales. Heck, the company is afraid to speculate publicly. The stock is still way undervalued at 10% dividend yield (in a zero interest environment) and low relative p/e ratio compared to competitors. I just hope they don't get acquired before we get our full value."
"TD Ameritrade shows the short interest at 29% at 9/30. Its up a little in the quarter. I'm a big BGS fan and I just don't see the massive downside that these folks see. Sales and income are historic, partly because of the pandemic, but they will not collapse. The dividend is as safe as gold. Management is doing all the right things. Brand recognition is terrific. Debt is being paid down is very manageable. I'd like to hear the current short strategy from one of the naysayers. I understand that the upside is becoming limited. Past 35 will be tough, but down to 20 or 15? Why?"
looking at the 1 Year chart stock has taken a dip all Year but is about where it was a Year ago. In my opinion for what it is worth I think the stock will make a nice rebound at this point. The reasoning is that Grocery Stores have been making great sales since everyone is eating at home. Happy and holding at this point and if my thoughts are correct I will be adding to my holdings.
I hope that all of the Portland employees are part of the pension plan and that the severance package is rewarding.
"Don't get many opportunities as good as this. One year chart is lower highs, lower lows. Down trend is firmly in place. Looks like a move in to the 15's is very likely. Until earnings at the end of the month no catalyst to reverse this trend. I will be adding until then to lower my ave cost. This is a classic case of short term is a voting machine, long term is a weighing machine. Shorts are playing the trend and winning. But the value will win long term."
Good article about the stability of the dividend. Still mystifying why anyone would short this stock thinking the dividend is at risk. Those days are gone.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4406274-b-and-g-foods-bgs-strong-organic-growth-bolsters-6-dividend-yield#comments
"BGS should be at $36 today based upon relative PE. Utilizing a low 30% growth rate vice their actual growth rate of 38%, PEG is .44. Money managers pay up for PEGS that are much higher. The large Institutional short positions are the very real and very heavy anchor to share price. SHORTS are getting a chance to cover this morning. As analysts raise their PE estimates in coming weeks because pandemic is here for at least 4 more quarters, forward PE’s must be raised also. SHORTS, paying the 7% DIV carrying costs, will have to find weaker balance sheets to prey upon. If you want best in class DIV yield and a Company growing sales at 30%+, where else can you go with your money? BUY, BUY, BUY BGS!"
"Here is sample of how cheap BGS is selling. MV is $1.12B. If they eliminated the dividend and used that cash to retire shares at current prices, they could retire 50% of the stock in 3.2 years. Earnings would double in that case to $4/shr. In the current situation with an 11% yield, we also get back 44% of our investment in 4 years and that is with no dividend increases. So which one is better? The problem arises in that the stock would not stay at $17.70 and lenders would not approve such a decline in equity, so they could never buy that much. Their solution is to retire 5%/year and with an 11% yield, our total return is 16% assuming no growth. TRhis is not Striker Drilling it is a dull food company with steady sales."
"unreal why anyone would short this with all the hyperbolic gains in tech.... also have to pay 6% dividend... solid company, debt, dividend easily covered..."
"Mr. Romanzi continued, “Consistent with our acquisition strategy, we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to our earnings per share and free cash flow.”B&G Foods projects that in 2021, the acquired business will continue to benefit from increased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic and generate annual net sales of approximately $270 million, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $65 million to $70 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.45 to $0.50. Not a good time to be short :-)"
"I am in a long position with BGS primarily as a technical trade. However, this company appears to be the kind of company that you ""marry"" in the MFK game of stock investing. They religiously return money to shareholders, know how to grow using debt, and have been largely internally stable minus a CEO change (which was then stabilized by an internal promotion from an equally-qualified industry expert who had been with the company for a long while). How they got on the ""kill"" list for stocks seems bizarre. I have been following them for a decade, and this seems antithetical to their real value. I think it does present a compelling opportunity though.The short narrative could be wrong on two counts. First, they seem to dogmatically believe the platitude that the dividend yield cannot stay above a certain level with any stock despite company health. I think what they should be worried about is how the market will correct for this if the company does not cut the div, as BGS's financials are looking adequate to keep the current div going for a very, very long time. Second, they believe the company's debt obligations are comparatively bad to the rest of the industry. I think this debt level is part and parcel to BGS's cash-flow-growth-through-acquisitions business, and they have shown they know how to use it, negotiate around it, and refinance. The fed rate cut is also is appealing to their style of business.No matter if the shorts are right or not, or if there is another unknown, I think long investors are in a good spot to either collect the div, see the price appreciate when it gets cut (as the short story becomes less compelling), or even see the price appreciate as shorts abandon ship. I expect BGS to continue to respect its shareholders (again, ""marry"" material) by returning more and more money to their hands from dividend and share buyback programs.Also, I am new to this forum, and there are some very well-thought-out posts. I'm interested to hear what people think who know this company well. Thanks for reading."
"Worth a lot more per share than $25. It will move only up! low PE. Big dividend, only positive statements from conference and investor relations!"
25% hike in food assistance should be very beneficial to BGS.
"Very low volume day and overall Friday droop. This is when I buy the bargains, BGS, and UNM."
"It is like a run on the bank. Green Giant is the swing factor and it was up was up in Q1 and Q2 but down in Q3. The shorts are looking for some kind of disaster in Green Giant but I would doubt that. If it is up in sales, the stock will take off like a frightened rabbit. They raised plenty of cash with the new debt offering to pay all the $700MM 2021 debt. Interest costs will be up slightly as the new debt overlaps over the old dedt. Even at the 3Q lower run rate of $200MM of EBITDA, after interest and taxes, the dividend of $121MM is well covered. This appears to be a case of piling on by the shorts that has instilled fear in hands of weak longs. I guess somebody could have driven around to 100 grocery stores to count peas every day, but seems unlikely and BGS is sure not going to tell anybody."
"Seize the day LONGS. Yesterday’s Barclay’s call is the latest tripwire SHORTS are seizing. CEO was pointedly cautious in stating that business food sales remain weak. NO NEW NEWS there. Both CEO & CFO confirmed positive sales trend as articulated in last earnings release have been SUSTAINED throughout this quarter. Be shrewd and continue to ADD to your core holdings. This stock is going higher over next 55 days, not lower. The SHORTS can only make more money than LONGS on this stock by impatient longs dumping shares. This ain’t ‘cheerleading’ folks. Facts are this company’s sales are growing, dividend is safe and robust, and as CEO restated again yesterday, work from home trend is “very sticky”. They are looking for additional production capacity to meet their customers unmet needs. Today is yet another opportunity to put more of your capital to work for a 6.62% yield and reap inevitable capital gains! You sell into this weakness you’re just buying the SHORTS narrative that is obviously posted on this board. The SHORTS only have 13 more trading days to cover before they pay our next dividends. Stay focused on the facts and we will continue to make money with BGS. This is for the SHORTS on this board: BUY, BUY, BUY BGS! I continue to add to my core position, and I love collecting the SHORTS dividend payments!"
"Bitcoin is the future! Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks.

"I've been in love with BGS for about a year and a half. I made a lot of money because I got in at pandemic prices and was lucky enough to sell when it bumped up over $40. I still like BGS, ya gotta eat. However, in the low 30's the main play is over. They will grow slowly with Crisco but the institutional investors are still looking at the debt. So, if you are patient and like 6%, BGS is your cup of tea. I have shifted a fair amount to some mREITS like NLY and AGNC, along with some midstream companied like SHLX and MPLX. These are riskier but have maintained much better dividends throughout the pandemic.I appreciate all the great chat on this site. Thanks all."
Should be an interesting Friday.
"And everyone thought management was choking. You have to hand it to management for such a great move, sell the filler snacks that are last on people's list to buy and go with a healthy staple which is gaining momentum. They can use there presence and marketing to bolster the product. Plus reducing sodium in their other products. The ER call should be a great PR for guidance of their new image going forward with healthy food in an expanding market."
Why would yoo short such a solid stock with many beloved brands and low valuation?
Down Market today. I am glad to see BGS is holding up today. The two need re-branding initiative and the purchase of farmwise sure make me more comfortable holding with my average price of $13.77 now. I don't understand why anyone will be selling with this good news. If you are a company that is really struggle (like the share price is suggesting). Will any company really have the leisure to use cash to buy another company? GLTA BGS Investors!
"CAN""T WAIT FOR THE COMPANY TO ANNOUNCE EARNINGS AND COVER THE DIVIDEND FOR THE 62ND CONSECUTIVE TIMES IN A ROW. THEY WILL LIKELY HAVE COMPLETED THE REMAINING $25.3 MILLION DOLLARS SHARES LEFT UNDER THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, THIS WILL FURTHER LOWER THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING AND CREATE EVEN MORE SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL THEY WILL INITIATE ANOTHER SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH WILL ALLOW THEM TO ARBITRAGE EVEN MORE IN 2020 IF THESE LOW PRICES CONTINUE TO PERSIST. I HOPE MANAGEMENT WILL POINT THIS OUT MORE STRONGLY. DO PEOPLE REALIZED THEY CLOSED ON A $450 MIL LOAN FACILITY AT LIBOR + 2.5% AND $550 MIL SR NOTES AT 5.25% IN OCTOBER? THE COMPANY CAN IMMEDIATELY TURN AROUND AND BUY BACK STOCK THAT'S TRADING AT A 11% YIELD. THIS IS EASY CORPORATE FINANCE DEBT ARBITRAGE. JUST TO PUT THE MOOD SWING IN PERSPECTIVE WITH THIS STOCK: IN 2017 THE STOCK PRICE TRADED AS HIGH AS $51.50 WHEN THE PREVIOUS YEAR THEY HAD $1.73 EPS. FOR THE FULL YEAR 2019 THE EPS ESTIMATE IS AROUND $1.66 AND 2020 IS $1.70."
hard to believe how long shorts are holding this stock....paying the dividend and paying the shorting fee...hum?also someone said the div is paid from free cash flow...is that true?thanks
With news out on CAG I decided to look at a few statistics. The PE is 20.6 and rising. EPS is $1.66. Dividend Yield is 2.53%. The current Price is $34.18. Not at all a compelling buy compared to BGS is it?
BGS will shortly be in a position to raise their dividend payout again but I'm not sure whether the stock market will reward the stock price as much as paying down a little more debt. I guess which is a better signal to stock investors when valuing the stock price? What do you think?
Another negative article published over the weekend on Seeking Alpha. They seem hellbent on keeping this stock from getting any footing. I don't think they will cut the dividend but the damage is virtually done regardless. This stock trades like the dividend has already been cut to $1.00. That would still be 6%. The only thing that can change this price is for next earnings report to earn 47.5 cents.
Not worried about the stock price it's already down. I don't care if it's a growth company. I am happy collecting 11% a year on a dividend
"Well Fl. is officially the poster child for Covid. The spike here is more obvious every day. I went to Publix and yep, people were buying up everything for extended home time and or next Hurricane. I was glad to see BGS working the online ordering. Amazon knocked that out of the park. Hopefully they are selling a lot of Green Giant, etc."
"I'm not saying that BGS won't pass along inflation to its customers. I am saying, beware this quarter's results... just like they warned in the last conference call. https://www.zerohedge.com/personal-finance/campbells-soup-destroys-feds-myth-transitory-inflation"
$27 is near
All we need to know is the estimates are going up every 30 days due to Crisco acquisition accretion and cooking at home. The stock has not been this cheap on a multiple basis of earnings or EBITDA since 2010. The dividend is 80% of earnings and 60% of Free cash flow. About as safe as you can get. I think they will raise the dividend soon to $2.00. Forget all this trading noise.
"BGS netted $3M+ a day in free cash flow in April, with sales up 60% YoY. At Tuesday’s SH meeting, Mr. Romanzi reported May sales to date have sustained April pace. 45 days into Q2, Board already declared 2Q DIVD. Stable 8% yield is 12X 10 Treasury. 2Q sales to date 60% higher YoY, 2Q earnings report will be record breaking."
End of the trend? Stock has been in a long term down trend since topping out at $51.59 on 7/25/16. A double bottom marks the end of long term trends. Double bottom @ $15.40 on 10/28 and 10/30 with a new higher low on 11/26 @ $15.85. All we need is a higher high with a close above $17.29 and the reversal with be complete and the massive short squeeze will begin!
"Looks good to me. From Moody's: B&G's credit profile benefits from relatively high margins, consistent cash flow generation from a broad food product portfolio with low cyclical demand volatility, and a largely successful track record of integrating acquisitions. B&G's willingness to dividend a high portion (targeted at roughly 50% - 65%) of its cash from operations less capital spending is partially mitigated by the consistency of its cash flow generation. Margins have weakened in recent years because of cost increases for items such as labor, freight and commodities even though the company has had success in recouping commodity cost increases through timely pricing actions within its niche branded product offerings.B&G's SGL-1 rating reflects very good liquidity because of modest but stable projected free cash flow, the sizable undrawn $700 million revolver upon completion of the proposed refinancing, and lack of meaningful debt maturities over the next two years. The cash sources provide ample resources for the $4.5 million of required annual term loan amortization, reinvestment needs and potential acquisitions."
Why down today? They have an excellent CEO succession plan.
@big t is on the right track about taking advantage of squeezes from time to time. they cannot say this publicly. you have to read between the lines. The new CEO gets it. Note that BGS can buyback shares at any time and put pressure on the short sellers. This sets up BGS to take advantage of market conditions.
dividend payment due soon + market bullish on staples = short squeezestill far from 30/40 from 2-3 years ago for us long term investors
"With short term capital gains now taxed the same as ordinary income (avg 37%), how do shorts justify risk / reward? Or, for that matter, regular investors who buy, wait for dividend, then sell after holders date?"
Wow this stock has 26% short interest with great earnings and only 22. Why is that because the short interest should drive upward multiple times. This stock should be at least 50 to 70 or more with this type of short interest. What am i missing?
"Investors, I'm sure realize, that in 2019, 92% of the dividend distributed was in the form of return of capital.https://bgfoods.com/investor-relations/news/article/13401/""In 2019, B&G Foods distributed $1.900 per share of common stock (CUSIP # 05508R 10 6). Based on U.S. federal income tax laws, B&G Foods has determined that of such distributions, 7.52443% (or $0.142964 per share) will be treated as a taxable dividend and 92.47557% (or $1.757036 per share) will be treated as a return of capital. Generally, the portion of the distribution on the common stock that is treated as a return of capital should reduce the tax basis in the shares of common stock up to a holder’s adjusted basis in the common stock, with any excess treated as capital gains.""Anybody have a problem with this? Also, do due to the tax treatment of the distribution where is the best account to hold BGS, in a taxed account or a tax deferred account, ie...IRA?"
Markets finished down big time yet BGS finished up .52 for the day. $30 seems to be support. Also earnings out soon so will be interesting to see the results.
Zacks put BGS on its strong sell list. Stock price moves up in response.
Dividend hit my account yesterday sure love that Money
"New Short interest outIncreased to 29% ( new 1.7 million shorts)During last 15 days of June, 10% of all stocks sold was short with regular swing traders buying and selling some it appears that none of the long term holders are actually selling.Hold on tight, $30 is coming soon."

"B&G Foods, Inc. (NYSE: BGS) announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized an extension of the Company’s stock repurchase program through March 15, 2022. Under the authorization, the Company may purchase up to $50 million of shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.The timing and amount of stock repurchases under the program, if any, will be at the discretion of management, and will depend on a variety of factors, including price, available cash, general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities. Therefore, there can be no assurance as to the number or aggregate dollar amount of shares, if any, that will be repurchased under the program. The Company may discontinue the program at any time. Any shares repurchased pursuant to the program will be retired. The Company currently has 64,724,058 shares of common stock outstanding."
Can't wait until earnings comes out and hear mgmt's conference call. Q4 will be good and affirm the underlying investment story behind BGS. While they could increase the dividend it seems lowering the debt leverage would result in a higher stock price. A company with this kind of cash flow and future outlook should no longer be a short target. It's about time to convince the shorts this is no longer a place to be. The short have depressed the true value of the company and for the past few years have focused on financial leverage being too high. It has declined substantially since 2016. At would leverage ratio do you think they need to get to in order for the shorts to walk away? under 5?

If you are on the side of thinking that we will need 90% vaccinated for herd immunity we are a long ways from getting there. The R0 of the delta variant is so much higher than the original virus causing this 90% hurdle. This is a real downer because 90% seems like an insurmountable mountain to climb with so many skeptics on getting vaccinated. From an investment standpoint BGS will continue to prosper under a eat-at-home environment for awhile.
"I'd like to get back in but two things kinda bother me. One, the dividend is more than what they earned and, two, the number of shares increased by almost 600,000. The market is overpriced and I see BGS going to $20 when the market tanks. Sorry, guys."
"Something is going on, there is a lot of filings, of just in the previous week of funds taking ownership. Just looking, at these large positions, these funds are building substantial stakes, so the ""pro's, are seeing value here, just like the majority of us on this board. It is, only a matter of time, before this pops, as it were. Keep those hands strong!"
Looking at today's price-volume action you would think BGS is in danger of filing bankruptcy or announcing a dividend suspension due to adverse earnings issues. Yet there is no evidence to support it.
"They told us they were in a balance sheet position to make a smart acquisition during last quarter's conference call. Management delivered. Cisco dovetails perfectly with their cooking brand names. With the recent corona virus spike the next two quarters are an almost virtual lock for super strong cash flow. All the new customers they've gained will become even more ""sticky"" to their brands the longer the pandemic goes on. This means a higher plateau of consistent earnings is in store for them long term. This stock can easily get to $40 as the investment story gets around."
January 2020 dividend declared. No cut. The shorts have been promoting a lot of stories and hype to instill fear in BGS investors and drive the stock price down. Follow the fundamentals instead!
Added to Portfolio again today could not resist the pull back due to Year end profit taking and Excluding Dividend Date drop. Think or Swim has buy/sell ratio of 5 to 0. Long term investor so more share are off the table for Day Traders.
Just hard to understand Almost 60 percent of float short180 m of free cash flow to cover 125 m dividend Pe of a little over 7What are shorts expecting it to go down to before they coverMargin interest is expensive plus they cover a 12 percent dividend ?Next month or two will be interesting Board should announce 100m Dutch tender at 18 a share Would be cash flow accretive. By 5-6 m a year plus would finally get rid of the shorts
"I noted that the last dividend pay date, April 30th , B&G was trading just above $29.00. It took over a month for the stock to recover to the $30 + range. Dividend day is next Friday the 30th. Last month around this time B&G was trading at $33.50. The plot thickens!"
Out of money again - new dilution - why?
"CNBC’s Squawk on the Street had a restaurant analyst from Evernote on this morning. He highlighted BGS as one of the packaged goods companies that will be strong thru 2021 due to ongoing pandemic with increasing concerns of second wave. Emphasized that restaurants without a digital platform will struggle to survive, while the CMG’s will thrive. Weakness in share price this morn on light volume is yet another gift to LONGS only 5 trading days shy of EX-DIV. BUY BGS."
The Motley Fool article was completely asinine. As the author basically means don’t buy BGS buy one of TMF’s services.What really annoys me is the author trying to make an argument against BGS by excluding Crisco purchase and that any analysis should exclude it. Hey TMF Crisco now is a part of BGS and the accretive factor should remain and you should be saying kudos to BGS for making the purchase. I hope any future purchases by BGS will be just as good.As I said once before I like BGS because I like their products and I like the dividend. NOTHING in TMF’s article changes that. BGS is a clear buy under $30. It is especially great for a long term hold.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/conagra-brands-cuts-annual-profit-114729605.html bring on the downvotes.
"Dividend funds, ETF's were down 9% today which led to redemptions. BGS trades were mostly 200,000 shares each. Buyback of 7% of float shows confidence."
"Dividend cut is inevitable. Or worse , elimination!"
"Investors are slow to recognize the consumer behavioral shift as a result of the pandemic, especially when looking at BGS. We will see a large proportion of people to continue working at home, because it's productive and doable with the aid of technology. We will see people continue buying groceries on line because it is convenient and they can deliver fresh food to your doorstep. We will see people continue to cook at home because they've learned how to do it and it's way cheaper than eating out. These are macro themes happening when you step back and look at it. This idea that we are going back to the way things were is not going to happen, and this applies to BGS. BGS is well positioned to ride out on these macro themes. The shorts have got this wrong on the basis of the past."
So many things to consider with this dilution news. Will there be a huge sell off on next ex dividend day because of uncertainty over future dividends? It could drop another 5% at that point. What is a new good buy point? Is it 27 or 25? At the least it will take a few days to let the dust settle before making an investment plan.
"Per FlyOnTheWall: Latest data shows the largest indicative borrow rate increases among liquid option names include: Canopy Growth (CGC) 75.72% +5.65, B&G Foods (BGS) 4.65%. The cost of shorting BGS is going up!"
Bought when it was down in the single digits years and years ago and held on thru thick and thin. It results in 19% dividend not bad right.
"I think BGS holders could use a little comic relief at this point :)In the stock market today....Northern Tissue touched a new bottom, & millions of investors were wiped clean."
"Analysts have an average of $457 mil in est. revenues for Q3 which seems very low considering when the company generated $512 mil in Q2. Not much has changed in my opinion since Q2 so I suspect their numbers will easily beat the analysts. It is a little harder to tell if they will exceed $512 or fall a little under. On one hand the initial rush happened at the end of Q1 and beginning of Q2. On the other hand, commercial sales should have kicked in with lifting of restrictions. Also, the pandemic is clearly still going on, new products on the shelf and consumer behavior has shifted to stay-at-home. If BGS shows anywhere close to matching $512 mil in sales the analysts will move their target up from the current average of $29.33 to mid-30's. They will extrapolate the last three quarters and not treat Q2 as an outlier. It will also be interesting to see what margin improvements are. Despite some additional costs dealing with COVID the significant increase in sale coupled with economies of scale should result in better overall margins."
"Good article out on BGS: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4368662-strong-results-push-b-and-g-foods-to-19-month-highDiscusses pros and cons, and mentions options near the end (January 2022 calls with a $30 strike price are currently selling for ~$4)."
"Food is essential and the range and quality of products is good and the payout dividend is great.I expect a slight fall in earnings and performance. at earnings call, but stabilization at 28-32 over the next 6 months.BGS us a solid hold."

"As predicted, no dividend increase. Stock still undervalued and heading to $30."
"Years ago when I bought some BGS stock I made the comment on an investment forum that BGS is nice and boring. Well, I still own the stock and BGS is still nice and boring. The dividend yield has been exceptional and the business seems as solid as ever. Zacks and the short interest have seized on the exuberance of the Green Giant acquisition and stock price rise to beat it down. At the current price this stock is a buy and calling BGS earnings ""dull"" is exactly the reliable boring way it does business. Too bad they have the stock price hammered to the point that it is only good for a buy back, not a source of acquisition funding."

"""Brand Marketing"" was something trending negative in the grocery stores as many were creating their own labels. However, COVID has changed this dynamic permanently in my opinion. COVID has changed consumer behavior. It's not temporary because consumers have changed how they buy foods. They have discovered the convenience of buying online and delivery to home. As a result, familiar brand names matter as they repeat buying the same thing they are used to every week. As BGS management indicated there is a huge paradigm shift happening in the grocery industry. They've had more new customers than ever before. You can count on stickiness. I don't think investors fully recognize the impact that ""brand marketing"" has on BGS and its bottom line. While BGS is ""lucky"" in some sense they are are extremely well positioned to take advantage of this paradigm shift. With ""lucky"" timing they invested a year ago in better technology to manage their product line. This is one reason they have managed inventory, pricing, distribution, capacity, etc. better. For this reason they are outperforming their peers, especially in the area of supply management. BGS's basket of brands have huge enormous upside value in this new environment, and it's not recognized by investors."
"when i post i BTD i expect favorable results, get in the game BGS. you're oversold on shorter time frames and it's time to go green now."
"The untapped, hidden value of BGS is marketing in my opinion. BGS has so many products under their umbrella that it reaches a very high percentage of customers in the U.S. Almost everyone has one of their items in their pantry. A large company can apply more advance analytic tools that BGS simply doesn't have as small company. A large company can complement their existing products with BGS's line. The financial benefit is obvious for a large company with a strong balance sheet. I've wondered if Amazon wouldn't be interested in them. They already own Whole Foods so extending to food manufacturing isn't a stretch."
"We broke 15 twice today with thousands of stocks down and this BGS forging foward. By March 30, ex div day at 47.5 BGS should be edging at 17.5 to 18.5.. This is a good longterm investment. There is an outside chance a buyout by a larger player may occur or BGS will add to its business landscape by buying some additional quality food providers."
"short interest updateas of July 31st:Shares Short 18,150,370 Short Interest(%) 28.31% The short interest increased by close to one million between July 15th and July 31stthere was total of 11.5 million shares traded in this period, of which 8.5% were shorted stocks.Most probably most were shorted on july 31st, when the volume spiked up by one million."
"Trailing 12 month EPS is $2.67. The dividend is $0.475 per quarter! If we multiple that by 4 (4 quarters a year) the annual dividend is $1.90. The pay it ability is 2.67/1.90 or 1.4. That's plenty of money to continue making dividend payments. The extra can take care of whatever management wants, maybe debt or advertising on the sides of their trucks! The dividend yield changes from moment to moment and is not updated in most quote systems. At about 3:30 today the price was $15.81. So, $1.90/15.81 is a dividend yield of 12.01%."
Just made the WSJ:https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/this-green-giant-can-get-even-jollier-11598275800
BGS selling off because CS analyst posted a downgrade (from neutral to underperform) and reduced price target to $25. Clearly CS has an agenda. They must make more from their hedge fund clients (Prime Services) than they do from providing BGS with investment banking advice.
The shelves are empty. No frozen vegetables. This is GREAT for B&G Foods. I wish they would issue a press release that they are operating at full capacity to replenish inventory. The stock should be acting more like Campbell but BGS is underfollowed and misunderstood at the moment. Wait til they announce earnings for the first quarter. Cash flow will be awesome. They can redeploy excess cash flow by buying stock back or refinancing (0% interest rate now!). No need to spend on promotion for the moment. Low fuel prices for awhile.
If the august 5 report is good the stock should take off.
"New article by TheStreet after the Cramer interview. According to their data: ""We can see a nearby price target of $31"" and ""potential longer-term price target of $44-$45 projected."""

"Same old story with the debt/dividend. No real principle due on the debt for TWO YEARS yet every day, every quarter, the fear mongers are getting yahoo negative press and warnings about impending dividend cuts and suspensions. Moodys gives BGS a low rating because of the debt but it really amounts to disapproving of how BGS does business. Moodys would rather see BGS make debt payment priority #1 and dividend payout two, maximum three, percent yield rate like the rest of our traditional corporate community.

Oh well!https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-dividend.asp""A company will generally pay a capital dividend in instances where a dividend payment is required, but company earnings cannot facilitate such cash payment.""""Capital dividends are not a preferred form of dividend payment for firms or investors, as they often indicate a company’s struggling to generate earnings and free cash flow. Additionally, by paying out dividends from retained earnings, a company's struggles may worsen as its capital base shrinks, limiting investment and business opportunities in the future."""
"What multiple should this company have on 2020 EPS? 15x? What multiple on a more normalized baseline? 18x? Let's assume $1.90 ($0.10 higher than high end of initial guidance which they said that they will likely material exceed) on 2020 and $1.70 on 2021 (mid point of initial 2020 guidance). That would be $27.75 - $30.60. Stripping out the short position and all the noise, this multiple/valuation range seems reasonable does it not?"

"In the money again.B&G Foods, Inc. (NYSE: BGS) announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.475 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on November 1, 2021 to shareholders of record as of September 30, 2021."

"Be cautious to raised EPS guidance going in to ER & initial headline reports because many Institutions have sold the stock short. Company provided April sales: $189M. May sales: $160M, netting $3M+ of daily free cash flows for first 61 days of quarter. On June 3rd, Company guided to June sales range of $161M to $176M for quarter range of $510M to $525M. We’ll soon find out how good their guidance was and represents most important metric, NOT the manipulated EPS estimate. Good luck to fellow LONGS!"
"I don't follow BGS closely, but recently took at small long position. The finances look reasonably good. Ok cash flow, profitable, massive dividend, decent revenue growth, but poor guidance with the street. As Mark points out, their suite of products is nothing to sneeze at. These are standards across the US. So, I find the price movement somewhat perplexing. Technically, are we seeing a double bottom here? I think I'll be adding here. Consumer staples/groceries with ok margins and one hell of a dividend lends some degree of stability if the market tanks, particularly at these levels. As I said, I don't follow BGS closely, so am I missing something?"
"I brought my BGS shares are around $12 and is currently my largest position in my portfolio. Even after today's share price gain, I am NOT selling any of my shares. For BGS long term holders, they know the reason why I decided to do this. The ship has turn around. BGS is no longer a short darling, folks. What are shorts to do? Do they have a choice not to cover eventually? GLTA fellow BGS Investors"
"As I said yesterday after earnings, great company growing and rewarding investors. No reason not to add to holdings and continue to get a good return on your Money."
The Fool mentioned the 60% appreciation of BGS stock price as if it has been overbought. They conveniently omit the fact that it was sitting 100 feet down in the short sale wall street well when covid hit.
"Students of this stock recognize this pre-earnings light volume churn. Very similar basing pattern occurred last quarter. With 76% of shares owned by Institutions, none of the 300+ Institutional Money Managers who hold shares dares to be on the bleeding edge by taking their basis higher, especially with so many short sellers, and the outcome of the impending election casting a pall over entire market. This LONG added even more shares today. Why? Each time I venture to Kroger or Food Lion, the Back to Nature plant based Chocolate Cream cookies are rarely on the shelf, the Melba Toast and Ortega products are always picked over, and the Mama Mary’s pizza dough, sauces and pepperoni slices are similarly depleted. The Leseur peas display is always thin, and the Green Giant frozen veggies move, move, move. This stock will take the SHORTS carrying costs higher, not lower. BUY, BUY, BUY BGS!"
They have reported a 50 per cent increase in sales for the first two months of the quarter. Normal profits are a little above .50. Profits should increase a little more than the sales increase. Investors will wonder how much of the sales increase will continue. I consider Green Giant their key brand and am hoping their quality products found new permanent customers
"@Foster - I'm not more concerned about something catching my eye on a Yahoo Finance site more than in the grocery store. I think the company should make sure something catches a consumer's eyes as well as an investor's eye. Many companies find a way to ensure positive, forwarding thinking product news gets out there the gain investor interest and it's not just on their websites. My feeling is B&G falls short in that area. I think they have a great story. They just need to tell it."
"I just sent the following messages to BGS Investor Relations. ""I own a fairly large position is BGS. I'm perplexed as to why BGS senior management is not supporting their stockholders in taking a proactive stance to the current negative writings about the company from multiple sources. Silence isn't golden. How about reaffirming guidance or the dividend ASAP? The stock is effectively at an 8 year low. If what management has stated is true, then they need to have more influence than ZACKS on affirming the health of the company and its strategy. Your stockholders need to be supported."""
"Here we go again ,the shorts haven’t covered and the street refuses to believe the dividend is safe.This is happening in a lot of div stocks but more so with BGS.The boards are full of experts saying these stocks can’t maintain the div. The company needs to constantly proclaim the safety ."
Report looks fine. Up YoY based on 2019 as 2020 is an outlier for all companies.
"With a substantial investment in BGS, I always keep an eye on the accumulation/distribution curve to see if the almost year-long trend continues to slope upwards. Starting on 3/25, draw an upward sloping line through the point on 4/7, 9/15 and 11/25. Between 12/23 and 1/12 it took a short breather, but today it has bounced right back to the old line. This stock continues to be steadily accumulated in a strong trend line that is almost a year old. Hard for me to understand how short-sellers see this as a big money-maker, but good luck. Longs will continue to watch and wait for the inevitable squeeze, which seems virtually guaranteed at this point based on the acc/dist curve and the ongoing social situation."
I actually love this stock. I use many of its products which makes me smile whenever I buy one of its products. The dividend is great for a food stock. While some question the viability the company seems confident in it. With respect to a potential short squeeze I think the prospect of it happening is quite possible. I didn’t buy the stock for that reason but it is a positive. I bought this stock as a long term core position and hopefully it plays out well. Anytime the stock trades under $30 is a time for me to add.
"There is a good article in the WSJ (Heard On The Street column) about what stays/thrives after COVID from a business standpoint. Some of them such as superior convenience (e-commerce/grocery deliver) and new habits (cooking at home) are mentioned. Both of them coincides with B&G Foods, and how they are well-positioned for the future. ""In cases where consumers have merely adopted a workaround that is inferior to the real thing, activity should snap back strongly. Happy hours over Zoom, for instance, are no match for an actual night out. But in other cases consumers may find the new way of doing things superior, such as having groceries delivered instead of venturing into a supermarket.""""Some habits learned during the pandemic are likely to prove sticky. Many Americans have been forced to learn to cook, and those who were already handy in the kitchen have grown more so. This has been a boon for food companies like General Mills, GIS -0.42% Campbell Soup CPB +0.24% and McCormick."""
Somebody bought 1 million shares to cover. Still over 20 million shares to unwind. Keep your shares and enjoy the ride to 30+
"As long as consumers continue to purchase B&G's treasure trove of goodies, and we do have to eat, the stock price will be fine and the dividend will be safe. And we shareholders will be happy. Perhaps B&G will gobble up some of its competitors!"
"Looks like what the REITs do periodically to raise new $, for all the same reasons, debt reduction, acquisitions, etc. The market price always drops for a brief time then returns back to equilibrium. Investors dislike the event, but unless it is done too frequently, they mostly abide. It seems like they don't want to fool with the dividend, which would cause a stampede. It is also probably quicker and easier than offering a preferred issue to raise cash. This too shall pass, I hope."

"BGS has a strong cash position, is well positioned to service their debt, and should have no problem continuing to pay their healthy dividend. What is there not to like? A race horse it is not but some positions in a healthy portfolio should be conservative like BGS. I have held a large position for some time and added to it again this morning in the face of temporary softness in the share price."
Hard to sell this stock when you have to pay taxes on your gain and then reinvest in something else with a dividend of yield of 8-10% to get the same income.
"1) No Global Supply Chain Problem2) Food Company is Much More Recession Proof3) Positive Technical Trend with 4,000 points Market Drops4) 13% + Dividend5) High Short Position (Bonus Short Squeeze)I can't find a better investment to hold then BGS in my 50+ stock watch list."
"Just read the Credit Suisse analyst report. Still neutral at $28 price target. The amusing part of the report is their ""Blue Sky"" price of $31 (assumes 2021 EBITDA beats by $25 million) and their ""Grey Sky"" price of $12. Yes, $12!! Grey Sky assumes the dividend is cut (not going to happen) and EBITDA misses by $20 million.So a $20 million miss is worth a 57% stock price decline but a $25 million beat is worth an 11% increase. Think I will apply to CS for a research position, apparently it's a low bar."
"I believe Simply based their too high div relative to cash flow on inaccurate cash flow. Div is not 158% of free cash flow, per last er it's more like 75% of free cash flow. Plus BGS implemented price increases & cost reductions. In addition BGS is using remainder 25% of free cash to buy back shares which reduces div paid out and could be source of cash if they stop buy backs. The current price of BGS stock is undervalued by 50% at least, IMHO."
"This company was painful to own for us for awhile as while it had a great dividend it also had great capital losses. However the period for capital losses has ended, and we are simply left with an enormous dividend well supported by free cash flow that could easily be hiked if they wanted to do so. In addition that, the P/E ratio is at a 5 year low. Taking all this into account I would say you have a stock where the reward of owning now greatly outweighs the risk."
"New household repeat rate of 53%. 83% of US households have purchased at least one BGS product. That's impressive. How many companies can claim that? Re-reading the transcript from the BGS conference call. ""Our vast portfolio of branded products is driving growth in multiple ways from gaining new households, increased consumption in existing households, and both in the latest 12 months ending September 2020 83% of U.S. households purchased at least one B&G food products and that increased from 79% last year. That equates to approximately 5.7 million more household. The majority of our major brands have seen positive gains in household penetration, including Green Giant, Ortega, Clabber Girl, Cream of Wheat, Weber, and Victoria. And these new households love our products just like our existing consumers with a repeat rate of 53%. """
"Online grocery shopping will surge again as we go through another round of severe pandemic for the next several months. This should be plainly obvious. Expect strong sales at BGS for the rest of the year, both in-store and online. Don't forget that BGS's biggest customer is WALMART. Walmart reported 41% growth in e-commerce groceries for Q3. Walmart U.S. ended the quarter with more than 3,000 grocery pickup locations and more than 1,400 same-day grocery delivery locations. Online grocery shopping is destined to stay regardless of the pandemic. BGS will continue to reduce debt very quickly with the EXPLOSIVE free cash flow since March and what will happen in Q4 and at least Q1 2021. The notion that the dividend is in jeopardy is an old short story that doesn't fit the current fundamentals. Old myths just die hard. The greater question is how will management deploy the cash flow going forward to create more value for shareholders. Management has already expressed on their last quarter conference call they are already in a position to look at reasonably priced acquisitions. Whether they increase the dividend or make smart acquisitions are fine with me."
"7.5 million new shares. Welcome to the elevator... ""going down...""."
BGS as a quality and brand foods provider is one of the most solid investments out there. in the short term and longer term.
"This just in, People have decided to stop eating or shopping, choosing fast food and Beer alone."
"IMO shorts are betting on a continuing decline in earnings and a dividend cut. What the market may fail to realize is that the brand amortization expense of 31 cents per year is entirely a fiction. Management reported the current market value of the brands in their 2018 annual report as being 179% of carrying cost (i.e. purchase price less accumulated amortization). Supporting this was the huge book gain on the sale of the Pirate brand. Even if the true value is just 150% of book value, that would add $650,000.000 to equity - all of a sudden debt to equity looks much better! The real point I'm making is that current GAAP eps of say $1.75 is BS. The real eps is over $2.00 because the amortization expense is BS and thus the dividend is still being covered. Does anyone really think the value of Green Giant has declined since its purchase? Hope earnings stabilize as I now have a pretty oversized position in BGS."
"Can you people read ? From the conference call:"" We also continue to maintain our long-standing commitment to our dividend policy. Earlier this week, our Board of Directors demonstrated this by declaring our 60th consecutive quarterly dividend since our 2004 IPO. """" If I didn't ask this question, I think you guys would be insulted. So I'll start there. Can you walk us through the capital -- the dividend opportunity? I'm assuming it's still in safe regards. But could you just tell us a little bit through the cash flow and making sure that through the end of the year, we're in good shape there? And there won't be any need for any capital raise or anything like that? Just that will be where I'd start."""" Sure. So familiar question and thank you for asking a dividend, we're still committed to the dividend. Ken referenced on the call, the long-standing commitment to the dividend, as people saw yesterday, our Board reauthorized a dividend at the same level. And so pretty comfortable with that. And as far as the dividend coverage, based on the range of $305 million to $320 million for adjusted EBITDA, you're getting to $175 million, $180-plus million of EBITDA less cash interest, cash taxes and CapEx to cover a dividend of about $125 million."""
"I think it's worth mentioning that when one is considering investing in a company's stock, they not only look at their financials and dividend history, but also what they do or manufacture. If they manufacture in not so friendly countries that would be a non-starter! Also, if they manufacture something that is not beneficial to maintaining good health, definitely a non-starter!"
"SHEP. HERE........................ I have been shocked the last few days to see the short breakers are after this one. We bought it around $27 not too long ago for the dividend and the fact it makes one of my husband's favorite foods (Durkee's sauce). Since we can't find it around here, he has a cousin send him a dozen jars at a time. I can't imagine shorts being in a stodgy old food company. We just thought the dividend would help us and the stock might inch up and this is a really old company with history so it seemed to be a pretty safe investment. I really don't want to sell it on the run up because we have to draw out of an ira each year and the taxes on that along with taxes on other dividends from regular accounts is getting too much. You know if the short breakers run it up that it will also run down but who knows when."
FCF at -8.71MThat not so good.
"thinking of buying more now, but will hold off, it may go below 30"
"BGS earnings are going to be great again! When are people going to recognize that the course of this company has permanently changed? The pandemic has changed the way food is being consumed, which is more at home eating. BGS has a wonderful smorgasbord of brand names, and we are seeing huge gains in new customers. These new customers will be sticky not fleeting. We have about two weeks until the company reports 3rd quarter earnings. There have been no COVID outbreaks at any of their facilities so kudos to management and employees for keeping things safe."
"This is the best short squeeze set-up I have ever seen in 30+ years of investing. 40% short with support at 12% yield = $15.83. Read managements last earnings call, they have the company set exactly as they always have with debt and dividend policy. Plenty of cash flow to cover both. This is the bottom of the down trend. Management can't comment during quiet period before earnings. Earnings next week should cause shorts to see their very successful short is now played out."
"I sent this to the B&G Investor relations POC: I own over XXXX shares of stock in your company. In Jim Cramer's lightning round today, he slammed B&G foods saying ""People are gunning for these guys. They actually think they can't even cover the dividend. I have to tell you I am very concerned. I think this stock used to be a great stock....but it's not working and therefore I say be careful."" Does B&G management ever take action to refudiate these off the cuff claims? Does Jim Cramer know something your stockholders don't? It seems that silence isn't golden in a case like this. Thank you for your email. A few weeks ago we announced the payment of our 60th consecutive dividend. Since theIPO, we have returned to our stockholders almost $900 million in the form of dividends.We believe the B&G Foods business plan remains intact and very attractive, as we continue to run a lean but nimble organization that can react quickly to various industry challenges, such as widespread inflationary pressures, while we also create value through accretive M&A, while simultaneously returning excess cash to our investors through a healthy dividend and share repurchases from time to time.If you need anything else please let me know.Dara"
Portland sale is likely one of the first significant moves by the new CEO. This will make the Company more efficient and is being done in a very smart way. This portends well for both the Company and its stock.
So now BGS management has a rather large arrow in their quiver to crush shorts. Well played.
"I’ve been waiting 6 months for a short squeeze, but you would think with the increase demand, solid cash flow for dividend, buybacks and reasonable or ratio, that something has to give"
"With protein rich vegetables replacing meat, which has long term negative side effects, BGS has become a growth stock."
"Hedge funds getting short because debt trading at 5.5% and dividend is 12%. Its program selling because this is so unusual but this dividend is safe and at some point 40% of the float will have to cover. Expensive dividend to pay every quarter to be short. While this type of mismatch between debt and dividend yield is highly unusual and usually a sign of a big dividend cut, the shorts have it wrong here. Buy buy buy."
"Ok everyone, all morning, the Hedge Funds have been loaning each other shares to short. Short interest is now higher than the 37% it was at yesterday. If you hold and/or continue to buy, the shares will fly. Did you see how shares went from $37 to $47 yesterday morning from shorts covering as we bought? If we keep it up, they have no choice but to buy back the shares and send the shares flying"
"I listened very carefully to the conference call and no mention of the dividend being cut. Please don't post things that are not true . We are here to post our thoughts and ideas about the company and how it is doing, etc. not to fabricate stories. A post like that about the dividend is nothing more then a fear tactic and puts your credibility at zero."
"I think still conservative, but very nice upgrade .. Go BGSLavery calls BGS the largest beneficiary from COVID-19 in the firm's food coverage universe.Piper Sandler lifts its price target on B&G to $28 (~14.0X 2021 EPS estimate) from $21. The average sell-side rating is $22.86."
debt consolidation is a great idea. Should fetch a lower interest rate. Will be interesting to see how much they reduce with the refinance.
"I just hope B&G foods reports a great quarter and great guidance in it's upcoming ER. That would force a short squeeze and we can all just ride the wave. 27.47% short position in this stock. What a lift to the PPS that would be if they were forced to start covering their positions. Oh, and keep feeding me my divvy. Cheers, Longs!"
2Q numbers speak for themselves. RECORD SETTING Q! Like Mr. Romanzi just stated on the call: “Incredible performance”! Guided HIGHER for 3Q! Net sales for July UP 30-35% YoY! Green Giant product line generated $600M+ sales alone over last 12 months. Guidance also said new sales to Clubs & warehouses has more than made up for lost restaurant sales. STAY LONG BGS!
Is the dividend safe ? .....lol
"the roomer has it that BNG is going to cut their dividend and that's why it's going down so much, any opinions????"
Well she closed green today on a down day.
"midpoint of guidance for 2019 from the Company is: EBITDA $310 million, cash interest expense of $86 million, cash taxes of $5 million and capex of $47million. This results in Free Cash Flow of $172 million from which dividends (about $120 million per year) would be paid. In other words, there is ample FCF to cover the current dividend payments."
CAG up in pre-market. Beats on revs and earnings and increases dividend by 29%. Bodes very well for BGS!
This one's worth holding on a few days more to see if there is any speculative interest by the meme crowd. That would work to the favor of this management team that is eager to sell stock at higher prices that caused the share price to drop to low 28 after the shelf registration was filed and everyone freaked out. 33 to 35 would look more attractive.
"Thank you for selling your shares to me at $11.40 this morning. Yesterday, the short try to get everything panic along with the crazy market condition to steal your shares to cover since they understand management starts buying back $50M of shares Monday.

"Good analysis on BGS in Seeking Alpha. He's adding a trading position to his underlying LT position given the low stock price. I add that B&G would have increased its dividend if not for the acquisition. 50 cents accretion to earnings on a 15 p/e multiple should be worth $7.50 on the stock price. This is clearly better than increasing the dividend a few pennies. If the next two quarters are strong they could once again be in a position to increase the dividend too. Dr. Fauci seems to think ""normalcy"" won't be until 2022. Man, that's a long time... https://seekingalpha.com/article/4382271-halloween-tricks-and-treats-come-early-to-b-and-g-foods-investors"
"Best set-up ever. As of 11/29, percent of shares short according to Schwab 43.6%. TD lists at 44.7%. Anything over 20% is considered extreme. Float is 64M shares. So about 28M shares are short. With ave volume at 877K per day, it would take 32 days to cover all shorts. These are the 2 numbers that matter. Both are at major extremes. I don't know when the short squeeze will happen, but it is going to EPIC!!!"
Who is selling this at $21 - $22? Holders getting margin calls elsewhere? Makes no sense based on the fundamentals of the business.
"Not a pretty day today with DOW DOWN 400-500 points, even if the earnings report is good and the dividend intact. However expect a solid dividend and delivery for stockholders of record June 30 or so. Stay tuned. Our stock will rise again and soon."
B&G knocked the ball out of the ballpark and they are not finished yet. July has started off strong. Even indicated that August orders from retail stores in pandemic states were trending up as restrictions increase. Full steam ahead. Managing inventory well to meet demand. Seeing new household growth with stickiness on brands. E-commerce distribution expanding. New product pipeline will even bring more growth. Debt leverage under 5 now. Can even consider smart acquisitions. The story is not out on this company. Analysts will recommend based on strong underlying trends. Stock price can exceed its high given strong fundamental outlook.
Stock held up well today and added more. What attracted me initially was all the fervor as a Meme play but after digging into the fundamentals I like the company. The dividend is high and that's a red flag but you can also add covered calls. That's a 10% return and you aren't being greedy.
Is it possible that BGS is under consideration as an acquisition by MARS?
"Volume is picking up. Very good, shorts seem to be stepping away."
"buying some at 28, if hits 27 will buy more."
"Walmart stock down today on earnings BUT grocery sales up. E-commerce was up 69%. The continued consumer shift towards e-commerce for grocery pickup and delivery is real. This bodes well for BGS going forward. Walmart is BGS's biggest customer.From Walmart's presentation under Grocer:-Food sales reflected broad-based strength across most categories and benefited from expanded store hours, better in-stocks and strong price positioning; consumables sales growth was led by strength in household chemicals and paper products-Store pickup and delivery saw record high sales volumes reflecting continued customer shift toward eCommerce and omni options"
We should see a big move tomorrow based on their announcement of total shares bought back in Q1
"B&G brands are flying off the shelves along with the toilet paper. Can't wait until they report 1st quarter. the cash flow will be good to cover the dividend. 0% interest rate environment versus a 13% yield in a food company.

As noted they have declared the dividend unchanged. This is 61 quarters in a row that they have paid a dividend by the way.
Dividend day is this Friday the 30th. This September/October is not looking good for anybody or any stock. Delta is coming and extra unemployment is going. I also think inflation cost will be passed down from producer to consumer. And then there is the peak of hurricane season for us on the East coast.

There has been a lot of short covering. Short shares down 8 million but still 25% of outstanding is short. All that has to cover. That is alot of upward pressure just when BGS fundamentals are improving dramatically
"so a company that pays good dividend and who's business is benefiting from recent events is, according to yahoo, overvalued while companies who have been shut down with uncertainty of how they will be impacted when they do open is rated as a buy?"
I wrote the company and said This and got a response Questions / CommentsWatching the decline in stock price and seeing article after article on seeking alpha talk about high debt and if the dividend is safe is becoming the norm . Yet the company just sits back and watches the stock price decline and hasn’t come out and made a statement to refute these constant bombardments by the writers of these articles . I’ve lost a descent chunk in this company and have owned it since the 30’s and the only thing keeping me hanging on to the stock is the nice dividend . If thats cut then I won’t see much value here ......thanks Dara wrote back this Thank you for reaching out. We look forward to updating everyone on our Q3 call in a few weeks.

"So 100K share sale in last minute of today’s below average volume trading day, three trading days shy of EX-DIVIDEND date. Institutions that are SHORT doing everything they can to suppress share price. STAY LONG Home Gamers."
"My two favorite quotes on BGS in a recent Forbes article""But B&G might just be a perfect stock for a moment when the Street is lost in it’s own lunacy, when the economy teeters between growth and contraction, and when tens of millions of consumers are just waiting for the next paycheck to go shopping again for food.""""It’s trading at roughly 11x the per-share earnings B&G should earn for a fiscal year ending in December. At a moment when the market as a whole is basically three times as expensive. B&G seems a throwback to a time when valuations actually mattered.""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffopdyke/2020/12/03/bg-foods-the-boring-food-stock-with-the-fat-payday/?sh=52e3eb8f45e7"
"What will BGS state in our next ER? What percentage of the debt will they pay-down? Will the percentage be little more with each quarter(trick question)? At what point does the general market say the dividend is OK? Some people shop for a stock by looking at ""dividend growth"", but isn't it just better to look for companies that already pay-out what your looking for? @Giuseppe may want to read these comments, so please answer these questions fully. Thanks."
"Look forward to the numbers from late March, but , Apr, May, June, the forecast should be off the hook. I just found BGS in Jan, bought it for the divy, added on the corona drop , now feel like I'm sitting on a rocket."
I’m not selling. Just riding the wave and collecting the dividend.
added more . Closing in on 10k shares . keep the dividends rolling in to buy more ...GOOOOO BGS
Shorts will be feeling the pressure going into the end of the month to take their tax losses. Makes no sense to short the stock with strong earnings to be announced again in February.
General Mills reported strong numbers and the rest of the stocks in the packaged foods sector followed. They lifted their outlook for the rest of the year as stay at home retail purchasing is expected to continue. GIS's dividend yield is 3.2% compared to BGS's dividend of 8.7%. BGS is tradiing way to cheap on a relative basis. A lot more room to move higher.
Why would anyone short a food stock paying over a 6% dividend?
The company is a winner considering all the activity during the last Year. Growth is good and dividends are frosting on the cake. Happy owning this stock long term in my portfolio.
"With the refi of the 5.25% debt due 2021, they have no debt due until 2027. Thye can work on the business and not worry about a refi. The dividend is well covered with cash flow and thye state that it is a priority. The shorts love to pound this thing. The computers looks at reported eanings and say dividend will be cut. The shorts have to pay the 10.5% yield to the folks they borrowed it from so they need to Make $1.90/shr just to break even. That amounts to a 10.5% stock drop each year and in that cash the yield rises. I will take that bet. At this point shorts need to cover. I am buying the stock. Verizon is ruining Yahoo finance. Is there another such platform?"
now we're talkin
"I like the labor part of the deal. Sounds like they will be able to drop some costly employee pension and benefit obligations which can be a killer to long term expenses. I would prefer to believe what they say about being more efficient and synergistic, not just to raise cash to pay down debt."
"Cash flow is much better than GAAP suggests. Plenty of cash to cover debt and dividend. No growth, just a dividend play. 8% yield is a fair value for this company. Stock goes to $24."
some important points to remember about our BGS stocks:1. 6.3 % div is highest in food industry and very high in comparison to many stocks.2. June 29 is exdiv/ex eff3. 27 % shorted shares or about 17.3 million shares 4. Our ownership and possession rules and we will climb to 33-34 share value n June.
"Some of the Smuckers analysts think they sold the Crisco business at a modest price, which bodes well for BGS. The valuation is only around 2 times sales for a business with a 26% operating margin. Smuckers sold this business because the product line doesn't really fit in and it's a small part of their overall business. BGS, on the hand, has baking products already and it is a meaningful sized transaction for them. One thing that has been lacking with BGS has been meaningful growth through acquisition. The Crisco deal is slated to bring 45-50 cents eps accretion. That's huge! Not only will we get this from Crisco we also have organic growth because of the pandemic. We're going to get some really good earnings news on Thursday and excited to hear what they think is coming ahead."
B&G Foods Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 8.19% Yield (BGS)—from Tradesoftheday.com. Top pick today.
"Feb. 5, 2020 | Earnings ReportsSeneca Foods Reports Third Quarter Results for Fiscal Year 2020Seneca Foods Corporation (NASDAQ: SENEA, SENEB) today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended December 28, 2019.Highlights (vs. year-ago, year-to-date results):Net continuing sales increased $90.9 million or 9.7% as compared to the prior year nine months. This is a result of higher selling prices/sales mix of $58.0 million and higher sales volume of $32.9 million. The increase in sales is primarily from a $50.8 million increase in B&G Foods Inc. sales and an increase in canned vegetable sales.Gross margin percentage from continuing operations income increased from 2.7% to 9.3% as compared to the prior year nine months. Higher sales volume, lower cost increases and a decrease in the LIFO charge all contributed to the higher gross margin percentage.“The third quarter was much improved for the company in part due to an $11.3 million pretax LIFO credit. The credit resulted from reduced inventory positions as inclement weather conditions impacted the amount of seasonal canned and frozen vegetables we were able to pack. Selling prices have firmed as we work to manage our inventory positions and remain a 52 week supplier to our customer base.” -Kraig Kayser, President and Chief Executive OfficerHighlights (vs. year-ago, third quarter results):Net continuing sales increased $20.7 million or 5.6% as compared to the prior year quarter. This is a result of higher selling prices/sales mix of $23.9 million partially offset by lower sales volume of $3.2 million. The increase in sales is primarily from a $21.0 million increase in B&G Foods Inc. sales.Gross margin percentage from continuing operations increased from (0.6)% to 13.3% as compared to the prior third quarter. Higher sales volume, lower cost increases and a decrease in the LIFO charge all contributed to the higher gross margin percentage."
I did my part today made Three buys to increase my holdings. Any further Dip in price and I will add more since I am a long term investor. Every indicator I see says this Company has a great future and will earn Money!
"BGS 3rd qtr closes tomorrow. First two qtrs BGS generated a quarter BILLION $ in free cash flow, AFTER paying robust $60M in dividends. To assert that the BGS dividend is anything but safe is FAKE NEWS. Read the Company reports. Recognize the SHORTS' false narratives on this board for what they are. Sales continued to grow 30%+ YoY throughout Q3. Daily free cash flow averaged $1.4M for first 180 days of year. With sales increasing, daily free cash flow for last 90 days also had to average $1.3M to $1.5M. Despite the SHORTS best efforts, this pandemic unfortunately endures, and people are continuing to work from home & eat at home. BGS is a SCREAMING BUY on any pullback, just as the large buy of 220K shares in the last 30 minutes of today's trading indicates, as 30% of today's trade occurred in last half hour of the week. Institutional buyer seeking next Tuesday's $.475 EX-divvy. Stay on the Smart Money Team, folks. IGNORE the FALSE SHORT NARRATIVE and BUY BGS!"
"Market seems to be ignoring 2020 comps but instead looking at 2019 which shows better comps. No reason to sell this stock and as I said before it is a solid buy under $30. And while several analysts were questioning the safety of the dividend, BGS stuck it to them."
"Bought more today - long term investor - even if they did cut the dividend by 50% (highly unlikely) it would still pay about 5.5% at these prices. . .I would guess any cut would be more like 20%, and at this time there is no reason for that. Their Green Giant products are in a good place - ""plant based foods"" this year, and should continue to see high growth."
Ortega products are practically all gone at my nearby grocer. Green Giant canned corn is currently unavailable on Amazon Fresh. I wonder if they have added shifts to produce more goods similar to what Kraft Heinz announced today. They should have the capacity to do this. The numbers are going to be very strong when they come out and the sentiment will change on placing a much higher valuation on this stock. Covering the dividend is not going to be an issue at all.
"Kraft Heinz reports ""VERY strong consumer demand"" for its consumer products and see this continuing as people will be eating more at home for awhile. No surprise and this will be the same for BGS. A Goldman analyst notes that food stocks historically show multiple expansion when they are perceived to go from ""risky"" to ""less risky"". The average anlayst eps is $1.68 pre-corona virus. We could see $2+ this year. The average food stock p/e multiple is 20.68. I don't even think the stock is ""risky"" to begin with but others may perceive this. This stock is undiscovered for the moment but will be attracting new investors when they come out with their first quarter numbers."
"Fingers crossed for an ""optimal execution"" on opportunities presented in the CC tonight and a higher end of spectrum outlook."
"Phase I of China trade deal and passage of USMC trade package, the market loves growth stocks that will benefit from trade. Good day to buy shares of B&G for long term."
"Another Zacks attack over the dividend,how it can’t be sustained,this keeps on going like the energizer bunny,then they will change course and say it’s a buy how can anyone take them seriously ?"
I don't invest for virtue. Virtue is for those who want to ban weapons and the 2nd Amendment in the USA.
"So what do you think the PE ratio for BGS should be? With last four quarters earnings of $2.19, current PE is around 13.33. Nestle PE is 25, General Mills is 16.2, Conagra 17.7, Kraft is 22.8, Mondelez is 25.7, Hormel is 29, Kelloggs is 18.11. Debt is being reduced and we can expect another .45 in earnings with Crisco. Even earnings of 2.5/year with a 13.33 PE puts this stock at a price of 33.3. Still seems low to me."
So they are going to issue more shares and dilute the stock. That's not good and the 5 percent drop says it's not good at all!
"News article.B&G Foods' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 111% of what it was earning, however the dividend was quite comfortably covered by free cash flows at a cash payout ratio of only 57%. Healthy cash flows are always a positive sign, especially when they quite easily cover the dividend.Earnings per share is forecast to rise by 25.3% over the next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continues, the payout ratio in 12 months could be 93% which is a bit high but can definitely be sustainable."
Up 2.5% on above average volume. Thank you Zacks!! Only 23 more trading days before shorts have to cover 8.5% DIVD! Staying long & strong!!
"No dividend cut. From the 10/31/19 earnings call: “Finally, we continue to believe our stock is undervalued and repurchased 1.3 million shares of common stock in the third quarter at an average price of $18.55, or $24.7 million in the aggregate.” A company facing a dividend cut doesn't use cash to buy back shares. If they were buying at $18.55, how many shares do you think they bought back $15-17 since? BTW, they are reducing the dividend expense by reducing share count, another positive."
"BGS is obviously not going to be a darling when the trend is toward reopening and growth in other sectors. However, it's going to remain a solid choice for those who just want to get their fairly safe 6%+ per year. You simply can't expect red hot performance here when so many other places in the market are on fire."
life is like a box of chocolates. you never know what you are going to get
"Credit Suisse upgrades to neutral. Price target $19.""B&G’s sales grew 56% in March in our tracking data and remained strong in the first week ofApril. Some of this growth certainly must have come from one-time pantry-loading ofproducts that will eventually reverse (e.g. Underwood canned meats +95%, B&M beans 67%,and Green Giant canned vegetables +91%). But we expect a longer-lasting benefit forproducts that are on-trend with consumers and have good innovation pipelines such as GreenGiant frozen vegetables (+32%) and Ortega Mexican foods (+41%)"""
Even though they are in a position to increase the dividend I think paying down their debt is better for the stock price at this point and time. The company has been unfairly punished by food analysts by not taking into consideration relative valuation both within and outside of this sector for quite some time now. Maybe paying down more debt instead of raising the dividend will change their minds to lift their low price targets.Increasing the dividend seems to invite shorts even though they've paid it 66 quarters in a row. It's strange but this is what is happening. We know the company is generating excellent cash flow and the latest acquisition is hugely accretive. 2021 is going to be a great year again. I'd love to see them hire a good CEO soon though. With Romanzi gone there has been little to no shareholder relations communication for several months.
"In addition to the likelihood that social distancing will mean more stay-at-home meals for a while, the fact that shelves are completely empty also likely means that a lot of people who previously did not purchase B&G products will have done so out of necessity, and may now become long term customers if they like the products. So, without any ad spend or discounting/coupons they get a whole bunch of customers to try their products; particularly for some of the newer product launches under Green Giant, this could be very good for BGS."
"Am thankful a vaccine is finally coming but this not change the positive direction of B&G Foods at all. The pandemic just accelerated organic growth, firmed up their relationships with grocers, improved their distribution and production capabilities, allowed them to launch new products, bring new customers aboard and put them on solid financial footing. On top of that they just acquired Crisco that will add 40-50 cents of earnings. We are still going to see very solid earnings numbers for the next 2-3 quarters as the vaccine won't be widely distributed."
"they make enough to cover the dividend. imo.. they wont cut it unless they absolutely have to.. because it helps to keep the shorts at bay. with as many shorts as there are in this thing, the slightest good news will create a nice squeeze.. love to see that"
"Why is it that some investors get, ""all in a frenzy"" when the stock tumbles, or doesn't zoom to the stars? Ignore the shorts, ignore a miss on earnings, if the dividends are holding/increasing and the company is not filing chapter 11 just ""relish"" no pun intended, owning a good company."
"Been a long time holder of BGS since the days it was a bond/stock. The management has been generally thoughtful and consistent in deploying capital. The stock market is not giving the company a benefit of the doubt despite it's good track record. The stock is way undervalued considering the dividend coverage. On the last conference call the CFO detailed this point, but most don't pay attention. Most ""investors"" only pay attention to FANG stocks these days. As far as the top line the sales comp looks negative to the average investor because of the recent sale. Margins are improving and I suspect that transportation costs will be more friendly going forward. I wish they will have an opportunity to buy something on the cheap and simultaneously reduce the dividend to pay for it. However, I'm afraid they might be too afraid to alienate dividend hungry shareholder base. Despite Trader Joe and Aldi rolling out non-brand names in their stores I do not view this as a LT issue. This is slowing down and brand name recognition is returning as consumers differentiate the value proposition. Continuing to add to my position at these low prices. This is a great opportunity in my mind."
Why is anybody selling at this price? Earnings report is expected to be solid and is coming up soon!
"I hate to say it, but on paper, we have lost in excess of 1 year's worth of dividends alone today. I emphasize ""on paper"". Rather than panic, I added a little more to my position at $26.98. The news seems to be good. Except for the market overall today, am I missing something? One would think the story is intact, especially given today's concerns about new virus shutdowns around the world. People have to eat. If not in a restaurant, then where? At home! If the earnings report is good, the dividend yield should adjust. Meaning if the dividend stays the same, the share price should go up to reflect the 7% yield's attractiveness. Of course who said anything about the market these days is rational?"
Ex-dividend next week. How long will shorts be willing to cover 10% yield in the hopes of additional 10-15% gain?
"Be careful Home Gamers. 89% of shares outstanding are owned by Institutional investors. 3,838 put options were sold on B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS) on 6/8/2020, an increase of 1,192% over the average volume of 297. They’re going to manipulate share price to cover their loss AND their $8M dividend payment to themselves. All news from the Company has been positive, and will be thru Aug 6 Earnings Release. Don’t surrender your gains to the institutional shorts easily!"
"Time to buy now! 31,84$ = BARGAIN!!"
B&G acquires Farmwise. Some think they don't have enough to cover dividend. Management responds by buying another company.
"Crisco announcement is massive. Accretive, adds $0.50-0.55 to EPS, which makes the dividend look safer than ever. Can see a path to a dividend increase now."
"Game on! (pun intended)BGS is attractive on fundamentals at this price. With an eps of $2.50 it is only trading at 15 p/e. It could easily be at a 20 p/e multiple when the food industry is 23-25x and stock market at 35+x. To me, this is a much better candidate to run against short sellers than GME.Shorts have depressed this stock from its true value. Shorts have argued this company was going to go bankrupt because the dividend yield was too high. They've paid the dividend 65 consecutive quarters in a row! The company's fundamentals are strong and growing. Look at their last few quarter's cash flow. For those who are new the pandemic has been a blessing because consumer behavior towards food consumption has changed. People have learned to work at home/stay at home, and they have learned to cook and save lots of money by not eating out. You can buy groceries online and get it delivered within hours. We are not going back to the way things were and BGS is well positioned for the new reality."
If you read this comment board... I recommend you go to bgfoods.com investors/news events/ Q3 conference call and listen to the last webcast conference call including the Q&A from analysts. I listened to it again last night and the executives sure seemed upbeat about the business - especially in contrast to the way the share price is behaving.
Investors are so slow to recognize the sustained consumer behavior change from Covid-19. People are going to continue to eat at home for health protection reasons for a long time. Even if a vaccine comes out that works really well people will still get sick. The symptoms of Covid-19 can be really bad even if you recover. Some take months to recover. Everyone is going to reduce some risk by eating more at home. B&G. The second quarter is going to show explosive growth. Even if long term top line growth is only 5% this is huge for B&G Foods because of their leverage. They reported a whopping 50% increase in sales for May alone and we even have more cases now. I am so excited to hear how June went and the degree the profit margin is rising. I can see the stock getting to $30 quickly as their numbers are released coupled with positive outlook and the analysts recommending the stock afterwards. For those who've been with this stock the momentum has clearly swung to the positive. I'm not a momentum investor but I know what they look like.
"Just initiated a position in my HSA @ 16.41 Owned this in the past & did very well. Although I should've sold sooner once it started to crater down from the 50s. Sold somewhere in the 30s Took the proceeds and invested in pinnacle foods which did magnificently right up until it was acquired by ConAgra a little over a year ago.I'm not a huge technical analysis guy, but according to the site I use occasionally, this is sitting at very strong support."
"bgs is one of the best food stocks to earn. I expect this stock will rise into the mid-30s within 3 to 6 months. If you compare other food stores and purveyors of foods like f l o, THS, CAG, CFB,, and HR. You will notice that all of them have dividends that are lower they have in most cases earnings that are not as goo,d although two cases do Hormel and Campbell Soup, and also that the price to earnings is sometimes significantly higher. So looking at all this I'm looking for mid 30s in the next three to six months. This is a keeper and solid stock with good dividend, good PE good earnings and a good future."
Looks like a leak somewhere on bad earnings based on after hours performance. Let’s hope it’s just a fat finger.
"Hi BbGS folks.We will hear earni bags from corporate looks like Aug 5.from BGS investor web site :PARSIPPANY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 23, 2021-- B&G Foods, Inc. (NYSE: BGS) announced today that it intends to issue a press release with second quarter 2021 financial results after the market close on Thursday, August 5, 2021. B&G Foods has scheduled a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET that same day to discuss the results"
"I know the top 3 rules in the stock market are diversification, diversification, diversification, but when I see such a good company so far undervalued I'm so tempted to go all in and snag that high, safe dividend for life. Does anyone know if there is an intervention hotline to talk down over enthusiastic investors?"
"Up on decent volume. Hope it continues. I've done quite well with this since I started a position in this and with an avsrage buy price of $18, even with the shares I added the other day when it was under $26 for a moment. Can't beat the dividend, safe and secure."
The trend of all food stocks is down no up. Everyone was down today. Look for another 10 percent down in the next few months!
"Excluding dividend Day, today explains the drop in price. Doing well considering drop in price due to paying dividend. Love this stock puts good Money in my account every Three Months."
