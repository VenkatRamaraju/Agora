"New car sales up eight weeks in a row, new cars don`t need car parts or service from Advanced Auto or anyone else. Jim."

Plus, the income for the quarter (I'm reading the Zack's article) is $.77.$.77 x 4 = $3.08 annualized$3.08/ $114.25 close => 2.7% return, which is pretty low. Often I see companies at 5%. It suggest the AAP is about 2 times too high, based on those numbers.I haven't evaluated the one time adjusted earnings or new tax law numbers. Not sure why Zacks left it out."

"Seems WS will use any news, even no news like todays Supreme Court news to drag down Apple. Looks like The Wall Street Criminals will be holding back apple for a long time now---12-18 months."
earnings tomorrow wed before market opens
why does this stock have such large moves and do the opposite of the market. Today up 4 percent while the market is down 1.11 percent. when they released earnings and jumped 10 percent and the market was down that day. I originally thought the company was over leveraged and very rate sensitive but i i dont know.very weird.
The scenarios are quite interesting at current levels for AAP. I started receiving notifications from awe*some*stocks the other week and so far they have presented interesting new trade ideas.
AAP is up 7.69% to 91.16
Strong stock performance. I like AAP all the way to 200.00.

"Several days now, AAP's website checkout NOT working... Logged in from several different computers, same problem. AAP losing my business as I am forced to order online elsewhere..."
I didn''t think a 'downgrade' would make AAP stock plummit so much in one day.
I knew I should of bought yesterday. Now I have to try and buy this thing today. Does anyone think It'll drop back down by the end of the day today?
I heard about AAP the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Maybe that's why we've seen such a jump in AAP. Clueless investors are mistaking it for AAPL
AAP is down 7.40% to 79.61
Advance Auto Parts is down 8.71% to 103.79
"War is coming with China and Japan over the South China Sea and the Coronavirus. Fifty per cent of Advanced Auto Parts come from China. This will stop overnight. Get out wild you can. I watch this stock a very long time, it`s going to fall apart very soon. P.S. Hedge Funds your going to get hurt with this stock. I have been in the stock market thirty years, I know a little about company`s. Jim."
"Perhaps a short-term pull back is more likely before the next rally on AAP? check out awesom-eSTOCKS, its a pretty reliable service. of course you have to do your own due diligence, but they generally point you in the right direction."
on HOLD 6 minutes 35 seconds!!! Is this how the Potato Chip CEO thinks customers should be treared??? If did not have FAKE spped perks??/ THEY NEVER FIXED IT...would not NEED CUSTOMER DIS SERVICE...Maybe they can sell POTATO CHIPS in stores??? as do not want to sell auto parts...FIRE the Potatpo CHIP CEO

"The shakeout and post earnings profit-taking has now taken place. This has left AAP oversold, watch the buying resume next week. People need to keep their cars running."
"Earning , revenue beats and stock goes down !!?? That’s bsIt should go up $10-12 up not down"
AAP is down 4.97% to 128.48

AAP is a buy for now..

Bought my Call options Friday. Let's make some money.
AAP will benefit the most from the Agreement (USMCA) imo
Why would anyone buy shares in a company that faces class action lawsuits for improper behavior ??????????
$100 stock tops. Grossly overpriced at 145. Nobody is buying antifreeze and wiper blades in this mild winter and all items are 10% cheaper at Walmart anyway. Check their prices.
AAP reached a new 52 Week High at 153.92
Is Amazon buying AAP. I heard a rumor from someone inside that they are looking into it. Anybody else heard anything
EWLL is my largest holding and look what it did yesterday! who wants a piece!? come and get it. dinner time folks.

This stock was $160.00 when it had the same earnings and even the CEO bought in big at $120.00
Breakout?
"no, one wants that piece of junk car.made with china scrap metal.I would give it away too."
"Massive volumes buying in at new support levels, no resistance on the upside. We get to make new highs in the $220's and above."
See you all at 160.00 fellow longs.

"The answer is not the internet, it is having auto parts in the store, not at another store or warehouse. So, customers can buy them from AAP instead of having to go to competition (seems like next door in every city) to buy the part in stock and not have to wait 2 hours, 4 hours or next day."

Best buy is Imploding on Huge Warning for NEXT quarters Earnings !This can't be good news for Overpriced apple can it ?
"Advance Auto Parts, Inc. AAP reported adjusted earnings of $2.10 per share in third-quarter 2019 (ended Oct 5, 2019), up 11.1% from the prior-year quarter’s level. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07. Adjusted operating income increased 5.9% year over year to $205.1 million.Advance Auto Parts generated net revenues of $2,312 million, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,298 million. Revenues improved 1.6% from the year-ago quarter’s tally. During the quarter under review, comparable store sales increased 1.2% year over year."
"#$%$ here? Bought 1,500 at $213 a few weeks ago as it seemed a ?safe? pick versus high growth tech stocks. Have a $204 sell limit in which almost got triggered. I?ll stay, but geez."
AZO was downgraded. What does that mean for AAP?
AAP is up 6.73% to 92.19
The Great Rotation out of Apple and technology stocks and into gold and other safe investments is accelerating.
AAP is up 8.94% to 145.53
Advance Auto Parts is up 5.81% to 170.36
The Advance stores in my part of Florida always have an Autozone across the street. Has anyone else noticed this?I wonder if AZO sees AAP as a weak competitor.
haha
"Unit sales falling - that's a HUGE problem! Don't be distracted by the other nonsense the company or its paid under the table ""analysts"" tell you. The end game is to sell more at a higher rate than before. Apple is not, so I would scrap it until they prove that they can do it, and without their phony numbers."
And again a new 52 week high. I like my aap possition :)

"Gravity is just a few million share buybacks away from being ""anti-gravity"". This is one of the greatest and most profitable companies in the US. All of the products it sells, except the air freshener trees and flame sticker decals, are made in other countries and that makes their global supply chain unbelievably strong and not subject to whimsical tariffs. Also, they will have an ever increasing sales opportunity as Americans stop buying new cars entirely, and rehabilitate their old gasoline clunkers, like their ingenious, but ""auto-parts constrained"" Cuban brothers and sisters. This company, and it's friendly competitors in the auto parts space, are worth more in market cap than Microsoft, Lululemon and Apple - combined! Think about green money when you see a car with a dragging muffler, or missing a hubcap, or a stack of little trees hanging from a rear-view mirror. It's all up and away every single day!"

i wonder what today's excuse for stock being down is?

"AAP Stockholders??? HOW long?? Really how long?? Can you put up with the potato Chip guy CEO Grecco??? Floating?? Worse WASTING ??? a one TIME HUGE sales growth opportunity??? Thousdands on NEW POTENTIAL AAP customers??? if NERO aka Grecco??? knew anything??? Subprime car loan CRISIS has thousands who have no choice BUT to keep existing car running?? as credit now bad and car underwater?? in so many cases...THEY NEED ADVANCE ""GRECCO DAH?""larges % of cars underwater being traded in?? so unless $CASH to bring to ZERO balance on car??? they need advance ??? Well Grecco?? Long EXHISTING great program like ""Speedperks"" BASTAEDIZED by mad man Grecco Horrible ""Not Working correct"" computor upgrade??? How can Grecco KEEP his Job???"
AAP is up 6.92% to 96.62
"Has anyone tried using the AdvanceAutoParts website since it was updated? Unbelievably, they made it worse than it was. Look for huge revenue declines going forward. The website should be driving sales to the stores, but it just drives sales to AutoZone and O'Reilly instead. Hopefully there are enough commercial accounts to provide a buffer."
What a coincidence AAP and AAPL both closed at 157.92 today at regular trading close. This is one of those rare type of coincidence don't you think.
"What about the lawsuit? Does that imply gross manipulation? How did the price get so high within a year, and now they seem to have only a 2.7% return.The dividend is pretty small."
So we cooked the books once again.
Nice moves!! Call options I bought Friday looking real nice.
This is exactly why you dump a stock after a 10% rise after good earnings!

"AAP: might close just shy of 185$ by friday Option Expithese kind of talking head news, usually is BUY opportinity"
Can anybody explain why this stock is going down despite an earning upbeat???
they only keep one part of each in stock. things must be get bad..
"anyone else think the smartest thing AAP's board and management can do at this point is find a merger partner or seek to be acquired. IMO, they need to leverage their physical stores with another who wants and needs them. The board should get to work on courting walmart, target, amazon, carmax, and other online speciality retailers in the automotive space who want and need a physical presence. Competiting in this crowded space as a standalone retailer is going to be very difficult to increase shareholder value. They need to stop giving away cheap options and shares to executives and start focusing on a merger. Also either raise or cut that foolish 0.24% yielding dividend. How embarrasing."
What’s going on? Down on no news that I see
Wow! So much panic selling.
"Mr. Thomas Greco, I`m still shorting this stock to Ten Dollars. I`m sure you will not get us there, because you will not be there. You never changed anything and you never got rid of anyone, like all those people making a million dollars who think they run Advance Auto and drive around in new BMWs. Sincerely Jim."

"Lol, that article about why it may fall in before hours is strange. ""It might be because investors think that the business won't benefit from reopened ecconomy"". Lol, this business runs on stores, so yes, it will. It's not a tech company that rallied in covid time, just due to covid"
buying at 150
AAP is up 10.14% to $184.00
"Plus if they wanted to buy AAP, why not let it fall with the market and then buy it? Let it fall, get it cheaper. The logic is missing. The DOW sold off around 300 points, for example. The other indices sold off big time as well. Some executive sold a couple hundred thousand dollas worth of shares, I think it was today. Maybe they hold it at a price to let them be sold."
"@Fay, I bet you're right, this will turn around when nobody pays attention to it, I am in.!!!"
Beat the earnings estimate by almost 30 cents and we are still down a percent on the day... people really only invest in meme stocks now and not the f$&@*#+ future
"AAP chart looks like ready for a pullback. Too much anticipation for a beat and raise? I got Puts on this for tomorrow. Also, I think guidance could be conservative, and lowered because of tariffs and all the imported parts they sell."
Is this stock ever gonna fully recover?
"Slides a bit more, looks like good buying opportunity"
Sold out my position today...not sure of any of the drivers for stock price increase....my local AAP stores in CT seem to be hanging on by a thread.

"Walmart an amazon,these little companys such as advance auto, oreilly do not keep nothing much in stock no more.always saying will be in at 2 pm.just buy from the big two , no ship charges an the parts will be atleast 40 cheaper."
this is not the company first rodeo.playing the mind games.with other people money.
"This is why we get RICH! Shares are too cheap if you ask me. When twice the normal trading volume happens on a Thursday before bank earnings...you know that we have extreme confidence in the stability of the markets. Debt financed share buy backs and currency hedging operations, as well as massive interest in LYFT float...AAP is one L short of a huge(r) opportunity. You watch this stock is catching a ride into outer-space, gonna do what IAI couldn't do today...if they only had the right auto parts, they would have surely landed on the moon!"
"$WMT with $82 average price target... where is the upside here? $AAP hammered, $LOW hammered. I shop there but isn't this thing in the nose bleed section for retail stocks?

Once again, no one is buying auto parts. I have a friend in the auto industry who ownes the top German Car Repair Shop in New Jersey, and he said this is the badest its ever been."

"Mr. Thomas Greco, don`t worry about all the dead wood in your company, your on your way out. Buy some more BMW`s for the people who think they are running Advance Auto, and hand out more free money to them. I`m sure the Investors in this great company will not mine. I will short this company to ten dollars, your are once again going to make me very wealthy. Sincerly Jim."
The saga continues with Advance. Every CEO has a turnaround vision for the Company and each of the last four have failed. The competitors are continuing to leave Advance in their wake and the excuses from Company executives just keep coming with each earnings call. The store teams are frustrated due to the continuous lack of proper inventory availability and lack of direction. O’Reilly continues to take Advance business and quite frankly it’s a better shopping experience when you can get needed parts quickly. I’m not sure I would invest in Advance. The company always seems shaky and appears better at managing the decline than selling auto parts and being profitable. May be time to stop hiring buddies and get some professionals at the top before Advance is the next Sears.
"I like the store and people but see their website as the main concern for an investor. It is not a quality functioning website and crashes all the time. So much so they offer 20% off the next purchase. If this company plans on staying close to where they are now, get a new group of IT people. I know two people who are young and will not buy here due to this problem."

how much this will end the day fellows long?! and the week please?! seeking good opinions fellows!!
Legal issues coming. Management in jail? Failed on fiduciary responsibilities.
Check out (http://Trade-view.com). They just mentioned AAP in the daily newsletter.
"I was a 15 year employee of GPI. After the merger, I was excited about being part of the biggest company in the industry. That quickly faded as most everything they told us after the merger didnt hold up. I attended the week long management training course in Roanoke where it became painfully obvious to me these people knew NOTHING about commercial account business. But they thought they did. I decided to move on and have never looked back. Good to see they have recognized the need to keep their talent, they have lost a lot."
"I`m going to put one more warning out there, hedge funs, 401k funs, and Calpers sell this stock real soon , you are on the wrong side of this trade. Jim."
CEO needs to go.... Get a CEO that understands customer service.
They don't pay their rebates. Good way to lose customers.
STRONG SELLLLLLLLLLLLLL THIS MONSTER BUBBLE FRAUD
Earnings play ideas?
Now is the time for those who wear diapers and suggest boycotting Amazon to put on their Ninja suits and stock up on aap. The problem with AAP so far is nothing except that a competitor's sales went up but didn't reach expectations . Another plan is to wait for the earnings and buy at 120.00 .
"Some people here expect AAPL moving higher according to technical analysis. When I look at the chart, it looks like going down? Enlighten me please?"
LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MASSIVELY OVERDONE..... what a great bargain to buy at 24% off.
like I said buying 150 change that to 130 or lower
Pre market fake-out. Terrible report and in this sensitive market you will see a plunge after opening to 127 and then trading down throughout the day and over the next week. BAIL
XL is the stock to buy now!!!
"Tommy, Thomas Greco, tell your investors how many people you layed off, fired or just told not to report to work until we tell you to. I`m willing to bet fifty thousand dollars it is twenty thousand people. No one is selling anything, No one is buying anything, and No one is delivering anything. You guys are in great shape to run this company right into the ground. Jim"

Advance Auto Parts is down 4.97% to 128.48
well the numbers are coming up soon. Just a guess but I think next Tuesday the stock will be 10700. to 117.00 a surprise could make it 120.00 . The price of aap was 118.00 when the big dive started.
"Apple analyst Ming -Chi Kuo est iph 12 preorders 7-9 million with those numbers likely to rise with 12 pro max mini sales yet to come. 12 and 12 pro numbers nearly the same of as all iPhones 11 sales over first weekend. Est. first 24 hours iPh 12 orders double those of iph 11 w est. sales of 1.7-2m vs 500,000-800,000 for the 11. That smell in the air? Is money!"
Beginning of this year share price low was $156.83Today closed $156.83So we are way undervalued compare to other part stores that up % 20-50 this year
Keep the faith anyway on this stock. Windshield washer fluid is going to be needed soon!

"Sticking with the Diehard Gold Batteries... I just bought a classic car recently that came with new Napa Legends battery from NAPA auto. 3 months in, and the NAPA Legend battery is dead, not so legendary it seems. I went to NAPA, with the batter the has a serial number and date stamped battery, and they denied an exchange even though they were able to find the purchase on their computer, but I was not the original buyer. Original buyer moved south, can't help me. So off to Advance where I usually go for just about everything and bought a brand new Diehard Gold Battery with a full 3-year FULL replacement, and pro-rated refund after three years... That's why I have been buying and using Diehards since the 70's, they just last! Glad Advance bought the brand and carries them now since Sears went out of business."

"You can't find less expensive auto parts anywhere, except Amazon, or Autozone, or even NAPA. But, if you wan't suboptimal customer service, or if you have a lot of time to spend standing around the store, waiting for someone to help you find a part that they don't have in stock, and you can get cheaper, faster from somewhere else...than you are at the right place! AAP is also like the Apple store, and I love that."
