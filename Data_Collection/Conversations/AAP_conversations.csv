"So, cutting taxes wasn't a fix."
"I like the store and people but see their website as the main concern for an investor. It is not a quality functioning website and crashes all the time. So much so they offer 20% off the next purchase. If this company plans on staying close to where they are now, get a new group of IT people. I know two people who are young and will not buy here due to this problem."

"Mr. Thomas Greco, don`t worry about all the dead wood in your company, your on your way out. Buy some more BMW`s for the people who think they are running Advance Auto, and hand out more free money to them. I`m sure the Investors in this great company will not mine. I will short this company to ten dollars, your are once again going to make me very wealthy. Sincerly Jim."
"The shakeout and post earnings profit-taking has now taken place. This has left AAP oversold, watch the buying resume next week. People need to keep their cars running."

Sorry guys this is not the Apple forum! This is AAP....try again
This is exactly why you dump a stock after a 10% rise after good earnings!
What's driving the rocket today? Up ~5% with volume not excessive and no news. Thoughts?

$100 stock tops. Grossly overpriced at 145. Nobody is buying antifreeze and wiper blades in this mild winter and all items are 10% cheaper at Walmart anyway. Check their prices.
The saga continues with Advance. Every CEO has a turnaround vision for the Company and each of the last four have failed. The competitors are continuing to leave Advance in their wake and the excuses from Company executives just keep coming with each earnings call. The store teams are frustrated due to the continuous lack of proper inventory availability and lack of direction. O’Reilly continues to take Advance business and quite frankly it’s a better shopping experience when you can get needed parts quickly. I’m not sure I would invest in Advance. The company always seems shaky and appears better at managing the decline than selling auto parts and being profitable. May be time to stop hiring buddies and get some professionals at the top before Advance is the next Sears.
Perfect time for Reddit to step in….19% off the shares are shorted!!!!!!!!!!
Is this stock ever gonna fully recover?
"#$%$ here? Bought 1,500 at $213 a few weeks ago as it seemed a ?safe? pick versus high growth tech stocks. Have a $204 sell limit in which almost got triggered. I?ll stay, but geez."

I heard about AAP the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
