"As I said a couple months ago ""160 here we come."" I like this stock all the way to 200.00. It's a winner in the Trump economy. #taxbreaks"
"In response to Bill.I was wondering the same thing. Plus, the income for the quarter (I'm reading the Zack's article) is $.77.$.77 x 4 = $3.08 annualized$3.08/ $114.25 close => 2.7% return, which is pretty low. Often I see companies at 5%. It suggest the AAP is about 2 times too high, based on those numbers.I haven't evaluated the one time adjusted earnings or new tax law numbers. Not sure why Zacks left it out."
DOOMED CRAMER said AAP is a BUY BUY BUY:)
XL is the stock to buy now!!!
They don't pay their rebates. Good way to lose customers.
this is not the company first rodeo.playing the mind games.with other people money.
Beat the earnings estimate by almost 30 cents and we are still down a percent on the day... people really only invest in meme stocks now and not the f$&@*#+ future

Well Shane got taken to the woodshed today. Lulz

Earnings play ideas?
"Earning , revenue beats and stock goes down !!?? That’s bsIt should go up $10-12 up not down"
"AAP chart looks like ready for a pullback. Too much anticipation for a beat and raise? I got Puts on this for tomorrow. Also, I think guidance could be conservative, and lowered because of tariffs and all the imported parts they sell."
Wow. I just paid 290 at Rock Auto for the same part number Advanced wanted 575.
how could it get good earnings and good revenue but drop $10 a share? Has to go back up eventually.
Apple = Kodak

Any idea where is the bottom?
"If you look at the six month charts on AAP, AZO, ORLY, and GPC, all have failed double bottoms. These stocks are all going down and very soon, that is for sure. Once again, no one is buying auto parts. I have a friend in the auto industry who ownes the top German Car Repair Shop in New Jersey, and he said this is the badest its ever been."
"Perhaps a short-term pull back is more likely before the next rally on AAP? check out awesom-eSTOCKS, its a pretty reliable service. of course you have to do your own due diligence, but they generally point you in the right direction."

"Gravity is just a few million share buybacks away from being ""anti-gravity"". This is one of the greatest and most profitable companies in the US. All of the products it sells, except the air freshener trees and flame sticker decals, are made in other countries and that makes their global supply chain unbelievably strong and not subject to whimsical tariffs. Also, they will have an ever increasing sales opportunity as Americans stop buying new cars entirely, and rehabilitate their old gasoline clunkers, like their ingenious, but ""auto-parts constrained"" Cuban brothers and sisters. This company, and it's friendly competitors in the auto parts space, are worth more in market cap than Microsoft, Lululemon and Apple - combined! Think about green money when you see a car with a dragging muffler, or missing a hubcap, or a stack of little trees hanging from a rear-view mirror. It's all up and away every single day!"
What a coincidence AAP and AAPL both closed at 157.92 today at regular trading close. This is one of those rare type of coincidence don't you think.
$AAP Maintains Citigroup Buy USD 228 » USD 232 Maintains RBC Capital Outperform USD 227 » USD 240
why does this stock have such large moves and do the opposite of the market. Today up 4 percent while the market is down 1.11 percent. when they released earnings and jumped 10 percent and the market was down that day. I originally thought the company was over leveraged and very rate sensitive but i i dont know.very weird.
Can anybody explain why this stock is going down despite an earning upbeat???
Insiders of AAP have been buying like crazy at prices around $120.00 after this stock fell from $177.00.
Now is the time for those who wear diapers and suggest boycotting Amazon to put on their Ninja suits and stock up on aap. The problem with AAP so far is nothing except that a competitor's sales went up but didn't reach expectations . Another plan is to wait for the earnings and buy at 120.00 .
"This is why we get RICH! Shares are too cheap if you ask me. When twice the normal trading volume happens on a Thursday before bank earnings...you know that we have extreme confidence in the stability of the markets. Debt financed share buy backs and currency hedging operations, as well as massive interest in LYFT float...AAP is one L short of a huge(r) opportunity. You watch this stock is catching a ride into outer-space, gonna do what IAI couldn't do today...if they only had the right auto parts, they would have surely landed on the moon!"
"Mr. Thomas Greco, I`m still shorting this stock to Ten Dollars. I`m sure you will not get us there, because you will not be there. You never changed anything and you never got rid of anyone, like all those people making a million dollars who think they run Advance Auto and drive around in new BMWs. Sincerely Jim."
"$AAP can you please buy some at $12 for me? I've been willing to buy at that price since March. Also, if not too much asking, see if you can get me a Delorean DMC12 with a flux capacitor at discount price."

AZO was downgraded. What does that mean for AAP?
"Apple analyst Ming -Chi Kuo est iph 12 preorders 7-9 million with those numbers likely to rise with 12 pro max mini sales yet to come. 12 and 12 pro numbers nearly the same of as all iPhones 11 sales over first weekend.

Check out (http://Trade-view.com). They just mentioned AAP in the daily newsletter.
"Slides a bit more, looks like good buying opportunity"
This stock was $160.00 when it had the same earnings and even the CEO bought in big at $120.00
Nice moves!! Call options I bought Friday looking real nice.
STRONG SELLLLLLLLLLLLLL THIS MONSTER BUBBLE FRAUD
Beginning of this year share price low was $156.83Today closed $156.83So we are way undervalued compare to other part stores that up % 20-50 this year
"You can't find less expensive auto parts anywhere, except Amazon, or Autozone, or even NAPA. But, if you wan't suboptimal customer service, or if you have a lot of time to spend standing around the store, waiting for someone to help you find a part that they don't have in stock, and you can get cheaper, faster from somewhere else...than you are at the right place! AAP is also like the Apple store, and I love that."
Same as Autozone...sell the news and buyback after steller earnings report sends the stock downwardYou have to be a contrarian retail investor. The whales know how to get your money
"AAPL is still making plenty of money but;Rev's are downMargin's are downExpenses are upIncome is downThey also bought back shares to help, without new products this will continue.https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/Q1_FY19_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf"
I see this going up another $5.00-$10.00
The saga continues with Advance. Every CEO has a turnaround vision for the Company and each of the last four have failed. The competitors are continuing to leave Advance in their wake and the excuses from Company executives just keep coming with each earnings call. The store teams are frustrated due to the continuous lack of proper inventory availability and lack of direction. O’Reilly continues to take Advance business and quite frankly it’s a better shopping experience when you can get needed parts quickly. I’m not sure I would invest in Advance. The company always seems shaky and appears better at managing the decline than selling auto parts and being profitable. May be time to stop hiring buddies and get some professionals at the top before Advance is the next Sears.
"anyone else think the smartest thing AAP's board and management can do at this point is find a merger partner or seek to be acquired. IMO, they need to leverage their physical stores with another who wants and needs them. The board should get to work on courting walmart, target, amazon, carmax, and other online speciality retailers in the automotive space who want and need a physical presence. Competiting in this crowded space as a standalone retailer is going to be very difficult to increase shareholder value. They need to stop giving away cheap options and shares to executives and start focusing on a merger. Also either raise or cut that foolish 0.24% yielding dividend. How embarrasing."
"Greco, clear out the dead wood. Everyone making one million plus dollars doing nothing other than hiding from you has to go.Your company is full of these people."
Advance Auto Parts reached an all time high at 231.55
"Mr. Thomas Greco, don`t worry about all the dead wood in your company, your on your way out. Buy some more BMW`s for the people who think they are running Advance Auto, and hand out more free money to them. I`m sure the Investors in this great company will not mine. I will short this company to ten dollars, your are once again going to make me very wealthy. Sincerly Jim."
What's driving the rocket today? Up ~5% with volume not excessive and no news. Thoughts?

"Sticking with the Diehard Gold Batteries... I just bought a classic car recently that came with new Napa Legends battery from NAPA auto. 3 months in, and the NAPA Legend battery is dead, not so legendary it seems. I went to NAPA, with the batter the has a serial number and date stamped battery, and they denied an exchange even though they were able to find the purchase on their computer, but I was not the original buyer. Original buyer moved south, can't help me. So off to Advance where I usually go for just about everything and bought a brand new Diehard Gold Battery with a full 3-year FULL replacement, and pro-rated refund after three years... That's why I have been buying and using Diehards since the 70's, they just last! Glad Advance bought the brand and carries them now since Sears went out of business."
how much this will end the day fellows long?! and the week please?! seeking good opinions fellows!!
"seems to be stalling here in the high 160s... took some profit and cut my position in half. I think this is onr is a winner, but we may see a pullback before heading to 200. If I'm right I'm back in at low 150s."
"I like the store and people but see their website as the main concern for an investor. It is not a quality functioning website and crashes all the time. So much so they offer 20% off the next purchase. If this company plans on staying close to where they are now, get a new group of IT people. I know two people who are young and will not buy here due to this problem."
"Unit sales falling - that's a HUGE problem! Don't be distracted by the other nonsense the company or its paid under the table ""analysts"" tell you. The end game is to sell more at a higher rate than before. Apple is not, so I would scrap it until they prove that they can do it, and without their phony numbers."

I think it will go down this week do to coronavirus cause
"Lol, that article about why it may fall in before hours is strange. ""It might be because investors think that the business won't benefit from reopened ecconomy"". Lol, this business runs on stores, so yes, it will. It's not a tech company that rallied in covid time, just due to covid"
The Advance stores in my part of Florida always have an Autozone across the street. Has anyone else noticed this?I wonder if AZO sees AAP as a weak competitor.

"Walmart an amazon,these little companys such as advance auto, oreilly do not keep nothing much in stock no more.always saying will be in at 2 pm.just buy from the big two , no ship charges an the parts will be atleast 40 cheaper."
"Several days now, AAP's website checkout NOT working... Logged in from several different computers, same problem. AAP losing my business as I am forced to order online elsewhere..."
