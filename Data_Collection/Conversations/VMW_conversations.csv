Is VMW ex dividend today?
NTNX has started to outperform VMW! Own stock in both companies but definitely prefer NTNX at this point!
"Basically, it is paying a 17% dividend on this Friday. And more importantly, VMware will be free to soar. Should be over $200 by Christmas.2022 is going to raise the roof!"
I think MMS r playing foul and window dressing. VMW is a solid software enterprise.
Please when is the company paying the special dividend? Thanks
"If I have covered calls on $VMW that extend past the special dividend date, does the strike price change to reflect the dividend or does the call just lose intrinsic value? TIA"
"From the VMW press release, earlier this month:VMware Inc. (NYSE:VMW) (“VMware”), a leading innovator in enterprise software, today announced that October 29, 2021 has been set as the record date (the “Record Date”) for VMware’s $11.5 billion, conditional special dividend payable pro-rata to all VMware stockholders (the “Special Dividend”).VMware will announce the per share dividend amount following the end of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the Record Date.The payment date for the Special Dividend will be November 1, 2021 (the “Payment Date”), subject to satisfaction of the closing conditions.--------------------------------------------------------------Record date was 10/29/2021 - No announcementPayment date is scheduled to be 11/1/2021Dell posted a release confirming conversion of their 'Class B Stock' to 'Class A Stock', and the subsequent distribution of their VMW shares to their Dell shareholders yesterday evening (around 9:30 PM), however nothing has been heard from VMW, period (?)."
"Interesting that todays news has not been posted here. Why ? So, date is set. Holders of Dell Oct.29 get .44 shares VMW on Nov.2. As to the rest, only Barron knows until it is free for all to see."
$180 easy by Friday
I am long VMW but having followed this sector for many years I have become more and more certain that NTNX will eat their lunch! That’s probably the main reason why former VMW cloud COO moved over and now is the CEO of NTNX.
"From Dell 8K On September 23, 2021, Dell Technologies Inc. (""Dell"") received a favorable private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which confirmed the tax-free status of its planned spin-off of VMware, IncTo close in early Nov. pending certain unnamed conditions"
No need to waste money. DELL took away all the cash and left the company in debt. They will eat more.
"High amount of short interest is fuel. Will those shorts have to pay the special dividend on their short shares ? IMO that is a, YES. I believe few shares will be available at ex dividend price. Squeeze."
"Morningstar October 08, 2021 report by analysis Mark Cash is a well done in detail review of all aspects of VMW past, present, and future. It is available at the bottom of Yahoo chart page for VMW's stock."
"WOW, you would have thought their cloud business contracted, but know it went up 23%""License revenue, from the company’s traditional on premise software business,- was $738 million, up 3%, and ahead of the Street consensus forecast of $699 million. But subscription and software-as-a-service revenue—basically the company’s cloud business—was $776 million, up 23%, but below the Street consensus call for $790 million""It's not like VMW is seeing sales decline. What an over reaction. Last year their cloud business was $631M and they grew it by $145M - -> 23%. The street wanted $156M growth or 24.7%.............Ooooooo the horror of such a huge miss.... Give me a break especially when you consider they beat eps by 6.7% $1.75 vs. $1.64.And the CEO/CFO said it was largely Asian customers being a bit more cautious and wanted to stay on premise. I get the cloud business is preferred, but they beat earnings by 0.11 and came in at $1.74. Their 2021 forward P/E is now 21."
Can someone explain why this is down over 5% in the past two days?
"I disappeared when Palantir went DPO. What's the playbook here? Buy the dip, grab the dividend, ride the dip and break even? Is a retest of $200 possible?"
"The Special Dividend will be payable pro-rata to all VMware stockholders of record as of the close of business on the Record Date. VMware will announce the per share dividend amount following the end of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the Record Date. That record date is Oct. 29.The payment date for the Special Dividend will be November 1, 2021 (the ""Payment Date""),Shareholders of record of Dell common stock that are entitled to receive the distribution of VMware Class A common stock as part of the Spin-off will not be entitled to the cash dividend.Shares of VMware Class A common stock will trade with due bills from October 28, 2021, through and including the Payment Date of November 1, 2021.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-announces-record-date-conditional-120000460.html"
"They make $3B rev in a quarter and the stock tanks, SNOW already has a higher Market cap and made a measly $275 mil and the stock skyrockets. Annoying market."
Why people dump this stock?? Is it good to buy it tomorrow??
"michael d becomes the biggest shareholder of vmware.....if he desired,, could he take it private? if not, watch for news this coming week.....deals/deals, no one's getting any younger.....and if his advisors say he 's got too much unrealized gains.....he can do something proactive about it. maybe , he can take the few retails holders with him?"
I'll take a dollar a day!
"New SEC filing:1. new $2B stock repurchase2. date of special dividend is (probably) Nov 1st3. special dividend is fixed at $11.5B (that's the lower end of the range given on Apr 14th)Hopefully, (1) drives $VMW higher short term, similar to the effect of stock repurchase announcement on $DELL a couple of weeks back (Sep 23rd IIRC?).Also, the early date in (2) should put pressure on shorts. I believe they will have to pay a huge dividend for the stocks borrowed. (Can someone confirm?).Yahoo indicates there was a big jump in shorts: shorts are now 20.21% of float, which is up 18.5% (from Aug 13 to Sep 15). That's probably related to the unusual higher amount of sells in early Sep.Clearly, paying less dividend is good for $VMW, hence (3) is better than the $12B estimate from April.Obviously, none of this is any official financial advice. Do your own research. Etc etc. But IMHO, short term looks great. Hold your fingers crossed. Ref: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001124610/000112461021000056/vmw-20211007.htm"
Maybe $170 next week?
This is a continued climb to $160 by next ER in anticipation of a dividend effectively in the 15-18% range
"Looks like Amazon & Apple are going to pull the entire tech sector into the red today.But, that will set up some strong buying early next week."
Most of these talks are B.S why shorts talks negative to grab your share and make the most out of weak hands.....hold on to it (you haven't lost yet the mins you sell that's wat shorts are waiting for to cover

Well hello there VMW how have you been
"Expecting EPS surprise of at least 7%, price action expecting a gap up to 165-175 range with an initial point target of 169. If we see follow through here VMW could run to low 200s on a bullish continuation within the next 2 months"

Might we have a nice pre-spinoff run-up in addition to a big ol' fat dividend? That would be very satisfying to me!
We'll be in the mid 150s again soon. Then probably get to low-mid 160s ahead of dividend
"last time vmw special return of capital.....went down temporarily,,,,,,allowed you to get money out without selling shares. in ira no effect....x more money to buy more...take it out and pay taxes as ordinary income. in a taxable account......tax free is tax free...and the taxable is capital gains....also if you're over 72 and stock in a ira.....use it to meet the annual distribution, which is required anyway....take ira shares out without selling them, pay the tax......now your shares have a higher basis of what they were transferred at...at this point .zero unrealized gains... just in case."
"Forget about my ""climb to $160"" post. I forgot that we always go up for 5 days and then down for 5. True to form for last 52 weeks"

"I was skeptical of this quarter's earnings after I realized that $NTNX was reporting after $VMW.Now, I feel this earning is implying ""Get used to winning more regularly."". :)"
I am looking on VMW homepage for a news release detailing the exact amount for the special dividend which I thought was to be released at end of trading on 10-29. I don't see it. Nor did I see it on Dells site. ????https://ir.vmware.com/websites/vmware/English/2100/press-releases.html
