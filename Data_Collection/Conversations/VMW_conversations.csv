waiting for earnings. dell needs to make a decision they are anchoring this stock. Let it go already.
"Looks like this is following the three day rule, where it will start to recoup tomorrow."
In last 6 months VMW is up 4.34% and Nutanix is up 51.36%. VMW is not the future
Seems like if market holds up we should be much higher in the comings weeks/months. Just need some new money to flow in. Valuation is just so low now.
"New CEO promoted from within. Earnings results ahead of expectations. I like it.@@VMware Inc. named a new chief executive Wednesday while also delivering better-than-expected preliminary results for its fiscal first quarter. Rangarajan (Raghu) Raghuram, who currently serves as VMware’s VMW, -1.41% chief operating officer for products and cloud services, will be moving to the CEO role and joining VMware’s board of directors beginning June 1. ...That release also contained preliminary results for VMware’s fiscal first quarter, for which the company expects to report $2.994 billion in revenue, up 9.5% from a year earlier. The FactSet consensus was for $2.908 billion in revenue. VMware also anticipates that it will report net earnings per share of $1.01 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.76. Analysts tracked by FactSet were modeling 80 cents in net EPS and $1.51 in adjusted EPS.https://finance.yahoo.com/m/bd08b71f-8cab-39ce-927d-3d799c391537/vmware-names-raghu-raghuram.html"
"I'M semiconductor IC designer and I work for a big semiconductor company in Silicon Valley Northern Calif and I know that my company is one of VMware customer and we rely heavily in VMware for Cloud infrastructure for our daily operation. The same thing for other big companies in Silicon Valley. I can only see this company will keep growing. This down action in price is maybe has to do with the MM playing options for this week but when the dust settles, I can see this easily going up to > $200....especially when COVID19 situation get worser...peoples like me will have to work from home remotely and we rely heavily on VMWare infrastructure...Just use your common sense....there is nothing to be afraid off."
NTNX has started to outperform VMW! Own stock in both companies but definitely prefer NTNX at this point!
Some great news or deals or new products will be released in this week. VMWORLD conference starts tomorrow. This should be fun

"High amount of short interest is fuel. Will those shorts have to pay the special dividend on their short shares ? IMO that is a, YES. I believe few shares will be available at ex dividend price. Squeeze."
i highly recommend for everyone to listen todays road show for analysts. Vmware explains in simple terms future directions and why all those downgrades were unreasonable.
Nutanix is taking away their Clients. Nutanix has a better product.
"Forget about my ""climb to $160"" post. I forgot that we always go up for 5 days and then down for 5. True to form for last 52 weeks"
So what’s everyone expecting for ER and the stock price reaction to it?
"Everyone chill out , VMware will be good short term and great long term , to many good cycles of growth coming in data center and 5 g , great management, but needs to distance itself from dell"
Is there any profitable company in any industry with PE ratio of less than VMware. Never seen this kind of Undervalued stock.

"WOW, you would have thought their cloud business contracted, but know it went up 23%""License revenue, from the company’s traditional on premise software business,- was $738 million, up 3%, and ahead of the Street consensus forecast of $699 million. But subscription and software-as-a-service revenue—basically the company’s cloud business—was $776 million, up 23%, but below the Street consensus call for $790 million""It's not like VMW is seeing sales decline. What an over reaction. Last year their cloud business was $631M and they grew it by $145M - -> 23%. The street wanted $156M growth or 24.7%.............Ooooooo the horror of such a huge miss.... Give me a break especially when you consider they beat eps by 6.7% $1.75 vs. $1.64.And the CEO/CFO said it was largely Asian customers being a bit more cautious and wanted to stay on premise. I get the cloud business is preferred, but they beat earnings by 0.11 and came in at $1.74. Their 2021 forward P/E is now 21."
"New SEC filing:1. new $2B stock repurchase2. date of special dividend is (probably) Nov 1st3. special dividend is fixed at $11.5B (that's the lower end of the range given on Apr 14th)Hopefully, (1) drives $VMW higher short term, similar to the effect of stock repurchase announcement on $DELL a couple of weeks back (Sep 23rd IIRC?).Also, the early date in (2) should put pressure on shorts. I believe they will have to pay a huge dividend for the stocks borrowed. (Can someone confirm?).Yahoo indicates there was a big jump in shorts: shorts are now 20.21% of float, which is up 18.5% (from Aug 13 to Sep 15). That's probably related to the unusual higher amount of sells in early Sep.Clearly, paying less dividend is good for $VMW, hence (3) is better than the $12B estimate from April.Obviously, none of this is any official financial advice. Do your own research. Etc etc. But IMHO, short term looks great. Hold your fingers crossed. Ref: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001124610/000112461021000056/vmw-20211007.htm"
"Dell is going to sell VMW for $300 a share, its clear how they have positioned the company and the media is beginning to talk about its 5G growth."
VMW was called baby Google back in 2007. Investing this for long term and be rewarded.
Investors are making a big mistake selling this one down. Buying it even cheaper by buying DELL
"Will this Special Spinoff Div reduce the VMware she price by $28?VMware spin-offIn April 2021, Dell Technologies announced that it would be spinning off its 81% stake in hyper-converged software company VMware after September of this year. As per the deal, VMware will close to a $12 billion special dividend to all shareholders (about $28 per share), which means Dell's stake will bring in a fresh $9.3 billion to $9.7 billion after the spinoff."
"Picking up a few more shs at these levels. With special div in the $27-28 range, I'm basically paying $118/sh"
"From Dell 8K On September 23, 2021, Dell Technologies Inc. (""Dell"") received a favorable private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which confirmed the tax-free status of its planned spin-off of VMware, IncTo close in early Nov. pending certain unnamed conditions"
What a start to the new year. Powerful +2.57% for the day outperforming the market. Closes near the high of the day which is very good to see.
$180 easy by Friday
Sitting on Jan $200 calls I bought before the Dell anncmt. Any chance they rebound or is it dead money?!?
Sell and buy Nutanix. They continue to take business away from VMWare
Can someone throw light on if Dell owns 80% of VMW - then why these stocks are decoupled? Dell goes up while VMW goes down - every day?
this (and EMC formerly) are among the OG's of the cloud. Why didn't MSFT or IBM buy it instead of Dell is beyond me. If this trades at multiples of any other cloud computing pure plays without the corporate issues this is easily $250-300.
"Mike Dell can compress VMW's forward PE to 1 for all I care. Today's price is $10 below the 2 year average. I guess these huge profits TTM are meaningless. Where are all these value investor analysts? Here's your rotation and yes its a tech stock. Unbelievable, let the day traders play with it some more."
"Shares of VMware (VMW - Get Report) dropped on Wednesday after a Goldman Sachs analyst named Heather Bellini downgraded the company to sell from neutral, though left her price target unchanged. Everybody remember that name so we can laugh at her later"
"Once again, VMW is in the right place at the right time.@@@Singapore’s United Overseas Bank (UOB) has become the first organisation in Southeast Asia to sign up for VMware Cloud on Amazon Web Services (AWS) as part of efforts to speed up the time it takes to deploy and develop applications in a hybrid cloud environment....According to a Nutanix study, Singapore companies plan to reduce their use of traditional datacentres from 42% to 17% over the next two years. Over the same period, they are looking to increase their use of hybrid cloud by 150%. If their plans are followed through, Singapore companies could outpace their global and regional peers in hybrid cloud use by 5% and 7% respectively.https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252460540/Singapores-UOB-signs-up-for-VMware-Cloud-on-AWS"
"Dell's so called Spin-off of VMware deal is not what mainstream thinks.Dell will distribute its 81% stake of Vmware to Dell shareholders. Problem, Michael Dell now owns 65% of Dell and because of this he is the largest shareholder of Dell. Michael Dell will end up owning over 51% of VMWare with the distribution of Vmware shares transferring to Dell shareholders. Before the deal Dell was valued at a negative -24 Billion (Liquidity Hangover with so much debt) and after the VMware deal Dell is now valued at negative -4 Billion. Dell sold it stake in its Boomi Cloud business recently for 4 Billion cash so now Dell has a clean slate in regards to tilting to positive valuation trying to get investor grade rating by continuing to capitalize off other Vmware sharholders that are or non-Dell shareholders from past history manipulations. VMWare is still Dell's piggy bank by taking on more debt. Dell doesn’t have investor grade rating so it is going to shift the debt over to VMWare so now VMware may lose its investor grade rating soon. Michael Dell historically has dipped into the piggy bank with its DVMT tracking stock nightmare for VMWare which was supposed to track VMWare value which it didn’t and allowed Vmware value to evaporate into Dell’s piggy bank again. Dell floated Pivotal and monetized its value to pay down debt to deleverage and then Michael Dell used the piggy bank of Vmware again to buy Pivotal back after it realized how important Pivotal was to Dell eco-system. VMWare stock is controlled by Dell is a major concern because of Dell’s debt hangover so this is the reason most investors will not touch Vmware’s stock. The story continues to playout to pay down Dell’s debt with a salesmen like approach that Wall Street and mainstream investors do not understand what is going on in regards to lost Vmware value to sharholders.When Dell bought VMware initially, they had a gap between the amount of cash they could raise and the amount of debt they could take on. Dell and Silver Lake and a few other investors were only able to raise 4 Billion but they supposedly got 67 billion for the over deal. The way they covered the gap was they created a tracking stock called DVMT because Dell wanted to go public again to pay down their debt. DMVT was supposed track Vmware’s value but this never worked out for Vmware shareholders in their favor. DVMT was a public company but Dell was private and wanted to go public again so they were going to do this through the DVMT deal by issuing shares of Dell by going public again. Dell then was able to go public but with a lot of debt. Dell floated pivotal and monetized that specific companies value to pay down its large debt. Then Dell went back to Vmware as the piggy bank again and said now we want to buy Pivotal back by using Vmware’s cash and issuing some Vmware shares (Dillusion of VMware stock) My take on this is Michael Dell says he is unlocking value for Vmware and Dell both with the recent deal because Vmware has benefited off Dell’s eco-system by as much as 35% growth. The problem with this thinking is if all of this value (Vmware’s Cash) continually goes back to Dell over and over again then VMWare shareholders continually lose. The next losing step for Vmware because of the piggy bank drama unfolding again is on the horizon it appears Vmware is going to lose their investor grade rating. The large debt they are taking paying down Dell’s debt it is that simple. I wish mainstream investors could understand how many times Michael Dell has dipped into Vmware as the piggy bank with so many clever excuses that mainstream doesn’t understand the finanicial impact. I would invest in Nutanix versus Vmware because of the concerns of VMware continually becoming the piggy bank for Michael Dell."
So who HAS or HAS NOT seen this special dividend show up in their broker account as of today January 3? My account is with E-Trade as part of the VMW ESOP and the dividend has not shown up yet.
Most undervalued stock trading on NYSE. Look at the earning HYPE for similar companies like Workday and Salesforce but this thing is red even on day of earnings.
I think MMS r playing foul and window dressing. VMW is a solid software enterprise.
This is a total overreaction.
"From my perspective, Dell has to liquidate some of its VMW stake in order to pay down its debt. It is a forgone conclusion that this will happen next year. Now there may be other names in this market that will yield better returns over the next year, I can't argue that. VMW does seem to offer stable growth and profitability. Not to mention the ongoing efforts to integrate their cloud acquisitions, and transition away from their dependence on on-prem solutions. I see over $200 by this time next year, but we will see where the dust settles."
"Basically, it is paying a 17% dividend on this Friday. And more importantly, VMware will be free to soar. Should be over $200 by Christmas.2022 is going to raise the roof!"
Why people dump this stock?? Is it good to buy it tomorrow??
"I love working for Pat Gelsinger. He is best! However, this is major major opportunity for VMware to bring in new innovative leader. Clean house of any dead-leadership weight, get the Dell #$%$ deal behind us, and add new rigor to corporate strategy. This is going to be a great thing for growing our business if done right!"
"$NTNX bull case:1) Accelerating ARR from tcv to acv transition that incentives sales of new products and reduces discount2) Subscription business now at 89% of total billings indicating the transition towards subscription is largely completed3) Increasing share of renewals leading to more cost efficient revenue generation, basically following Adobe’s recipe for success and driving profitability going forward4) Strong win rates against $VMW according to mgmt in the latest conference call5) Continued positive revenue revisions after strong earnings report followed by multiple analyst upgradesLong NTNX!"
"Looks like commons sense prevailed, 170 by July 4th, 190 by end of year."
"Something else must be going on. The CEO just gave an upbeat presentation yesterday. Stock has been acting erratic for weeks. Maybe VMW is about to be bought out and CEO knows this, hence the move before losing his job"
Might we have a nice pre-spinoff run-up in addition to a big ol' fat dividend? That would be very satisfying to me!
Maybe $170 next week?
"michael d becomes the biggest shareholder of vmware.....if he desired,, could he take it private? if not, watch for news this coming week.....deals/deals, no one's getting any younger.....and if his advisors say he 's got too much unrealized gains.....he can do something proactive about it. maybe , he can take the few retails holders with him?"
"Looks like I might have to sell a few things so I can buy more of VMW, if the market wants to give money away I'll take some."
"No offense meant to Raghu Raghuran, but I think Sanjay Poonen would have been the better choice for CEO. Sanjay is now leaving VMware, which is a huge loss in my opinion."
"Morningstar October 08, 2021 report by analysis Mark Cash is a well done in detail review of all aspects of VMW past, present, and future. It is available at the bottom of Yahoo chart page for VMW's stock."
I for one want nothing to do with Dell
"What’s wrong with VMW these days?! NTNX for example is surging. Got a position in both, but I expected VMW to perform better!"
"I don't get why people sell when it goes down to these levels. The pattern shows dips followed by very nice spikes. Great earnings report, great recent news. Be patient."
"Ok. The way this game works is now that it's close to 150 you sell a little bit, then wait for it to go back to 140 and buy a little bit. repeat. and you make decent returns."
What’s the direction of this after earnings?
"jerry Are you dense or what? For the last time, Dell will own 41%, NOT 51%, of VMW post-spinoff. Dell and Silverlake combined will own 52%. Dell is NOT Silverlake. Silverlake is free to do whatever they want with their shares of VMW and DELL. And after years sitting on their DELL investment, it is certain they will seek to cash in ie. sell shares of one or both companies.@@@When Dell Technologies completes its spin-offs of VMware, Michael Dell is set to own approximately 41 percent of VMware, sources confirmed with CRN. Dell’s longtime private equity partner Silver Lake will hold an 11 percent stake in VMware following the spin-off, meaning Michael Dell and his private equity partner will own approximately 52 percent of VMware.https://www.crn.com/news/data-center/michael-dell-to-own-41-percent-of-vmware-after-spin-off"
"I have read recent content about Michael Dell's response to its top Executives leaving (Business as usual, the Michael Dell way his response) and I am convinced more than ever since Dell as a company started to do well on Wall Street this past year this was the catalyst for top executives to leave (It about the future of Dell only). Michael Dell got a taste of this along with the Dell investors. If VmWare were to grow massive as some suggest this wouldn't bode well for Michael Dell and its investors of Dell because it does not have Michael Dell's last name. I think VmWare investors need to seriously consider that Michael Dell is on the board of VmWare and recently mentioned he will remain on the board. He has a large stake in Vmware and what are the options for him to use VmWare's cash is what is at stake. One scenario I think might play out is Michael Dell lets VMWare's stock go south far enough that he can purchase the remaining shares of VMWare. Since it would be a part of Dell it wouldn't matter to pay all of Dell's debt with VmWare cash because VmWare no longer exists as a name. It is basically a piggy bank for Dell. I am interested in others opinions"
"Interesting that todays news has not been posted here. Why ? So, date is set. Holders of Dell Oct.29 get .44 shares VMW on Nov.2. As to the rest, only Barron knows until it is free for all to see."
The political games played with this stock over the past year appear to be coming to a close. The games are wayyyy over my head yet 1 thing I’m certain about and that is the chart! This thing has been basing sideways for a full year! 1 full year! It has launched strictly from a technical standpoint!
"If I buy VMware stocks now, will I be eligible for the dividend?"
Does anyone know where Sanjay Poonen is heading as more and more top talent are leaving in droves? Top talent leaving in droves I believe tells the story about what it is like to have Michael Dell as Chairman waisting money to pay down Dell's debt. MIchael Dell owning 51% of VMWare there will be more payments to Dell. Stay tuned. I cannot believe Michael Dell as Chairman of two companies is not looking out for the fudiciary duty of VMWare. If anyone is listening is there anything that can be done to protect VMWare from Michael Dell?
Dell wants to buy out the retail 17% publically traded float and might be using unconventional means to keep the price artificially low. He can't afford it though and the SEC might need to have a chat with him. Bully the little guys out and maybe take VM private.
"This will a long term benefit. Short term VMW must pay the dividend, I think, in form of higher debt. But hold. VMWare is so cheap. One year one double."
I'll take a dollar a day!
"The Special Dividend will be payable pro-rata to all VMware stockholders of record as of the close of business on the Record Date. VMware will announce the per share dividend amount following the end of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the Record Date. That record date is Oct. 29.The payment date for the Special Dividend will be November 1, 2021 (the ""Payment Date""),Shareholders of record of Dell common stock that are entitled to receive the distribution of VMware Class A common stock as part of the Spin-off will not be entitled to the cash dividend.Shares of VMware Class A common stock will trade with due bills from October 28, 2021, through and including the Payment Date of November 1, 2021.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-announces-record-date-conditional-120000460.html"
Can’t imagine what would’ve happened if they missed earnings
so the special dividend about 30$/shares ...or 12bil/418 mil shares?? is this correct??
"Expecting EPS surprise of at least 7%, price action expecting a gap up to 165-175 range with an initial point target of 169. If we see follow through here VMW could run to low 200s on a bullish continuation within the next 2 months"
These traders have too much control. Oh Dell dropped so we gotta drop some of course. Perfectly reasonable.
Is VMW ex dividend today?
No longer down premarket?
"There is $132, wow."
"Nothing to worry about, ROST and HPQ both beat earnings as well, and both are down at the moment, VMW will be green tomorrow and setting new highs next week"
"Looks like Amazon & Apple are going to pull the entire tech sector into the red today.But, that will set up some strong buying early next week."
I am long VMW but having followed this sector for many years I have become more and more certain that NTNX will eat their lunch! That’s probably the main reason why former VMW cloud COO moved over and now is the CEO of NTNX.
"Is it just me or do we seem to badly under perform the NASDAQ on days it's up big and then solidly out perform on days the market is down..?I guess it doesn't matter over time given the past month we are doing great, but just seems kind of odd.. Almost like VMware is a ""rotation"" stock. When funds are selling the QQQ or other tech they are buying VMware. Does anyone else feel that way..?"
why is it up so much today
What happened. It fell $6 in 10 seconds
Be wary of initial AH reaction
Stagnation is the new norm!!! I think it is good to ask the question are you in good hands with management decisions controlled by majority stakeholder decisions? VMWare's cash is pretty much gone for the next three years so all companies can leave VMWare in the dust in regards to VMware being stuck in stagnation for three years or more. If you go back and look at the history of how Michael Dell and Silver Lake treat shareholders Dell and VMware stock will be like Kodak as some have mentioned. If things start to go south you cannot trust the majority stakeholders.
"If I have covered calls on $VMW that extend past the special dividend date, does the strike price change to reflect the dividend or does the call just lose intrinsic value? TIA"
No need to waste money. DELL took away all the cash and left the company in debt. They will eat more.
Great q1. SaaS and subscription is the perfect business model for these times. I’m a call holder and this great result is what I expected. Well done.
Conference Call today at 4:00 ET. wtop management.should b helpful
"An I understanding This correctly that all outstanding VMW shares as of March 16, 2021 will receive the dividend?"

Well hello there VMW how have you been
"Virtual machine technology offered by VMware triumphs when it comes to IT deployment scaling and expansion, security, support for legacy apps, hardware assisted high availability (HA), virtualized storage that could be easily migrated, multi tenancy on single server but well isolated, ease of infrastructure management, existing large deployments, remote centralized management capability and large base of trained IT staff etc. While virtualization offers lot of sophistication needed for mission critical applications, it does come with added cost. Some niche smaller applications that may not require the large scale and other goodies can run in container environment devoid of VMs. Make no mistake, for larger end users, security is the biggest elephant in the room and can’t be pushed under the carpet. VMware is leaving no stones unturned as it is integrating virtual machine and container based technologies to expand its revenue and foot print further. IMO, I see this dip as a buying opportunity. In a medium to long run the stock may be trading much higher given the growth numbers we are seeing. (Disclaimer: Please do your own due diligence when you invest)"
We'll be in the mid 150s again soon. Then probably get to low-mid 160s ahead of dividend
When is the SD scheduled?
virtual servers and cloud technology is not exactly brand new technology. Is there a fortune 500 company that doesn't have VMware in some form? (no)….when will vmw start paying dividends ???????
"VMware, Inc.Hang on to your positions. Dell will unload VMW in Sept. which marks the 5 years of Dell ownership and therefore a tax free sale. Dell purchased for around 6B and it's now worth well north of 60B. This is a no brainer. Action in the stock is being manipulated by the shorts and will rebound very soon."
Before VMWare can move forward Michael Dell must be released from Chairman of the Board. VMWare also needs to do something about that Michael Dell and Silver Lake cannot control VMWare at a 50% margin in total stock ownership. Michael Dell has a very poor history of not looking out for the interest of its stakeholders. Seriously consider.
See you all at $150
"The whole point of companies is to make money. VMW does that great, why doesn't the stock go up then? All other tech shares are rising for days."
"The street has been really hitting Dell hard about his reverse merger plans with articles and ratings downgrades to try to persuade him to buy our the minority in vmw. This may make enough problems to force him to rethink his plans. Also, I find it too coincidental that hours before a great earnings event news just happens to break that Dell is going forward with the RM. All I’m going to say is that it sure depressed the stock and scarred any potential buys away. Maybe this was orchestrated to encourage a minority buyout. If the stock price is too high the buyout plus premium will be too much. Just my insight and I am just reading between the lines here.Cheers!"
"I was skeptical of this quarter's earnings after I realized that $NTNX was reporting after $VMW.Now, I feel this earning is implying ""Get used to winning more regularly."". :)"
It's peaked.
Anyone knows why VMW is trading higher in after-hours. I bought many Oct 18 130 calls a few days ago
What’s this thing gonna do today? Strong earnings report? We going up 10% or down 10%

"Once we dropped below $160 at end of Nov, price has been in a tight range 145-155 for 2+ months. Definitely looks like a breakout ahead of earnings. I'll be adding a few shares this week."
"Shares are trading at levels last seen in 2017. No doubt, this has been somewhat of a transitional, investment driven, period, with the acquisitions of Pivotal and Carbon Black so It might take a few quarters to optimize the synergies across all platforms. However, I remain optimistic on the name. Many great offerings in the pipeline--most notable : PaaS version of Kubernetes. Also worth noting that it's guidance does incorporate an impact from Covid19 so, depending on how sever, an upside surprise may be built in to expectations."
Nutanix had a great quarter and VM Ware had a bad quarter. Not Rocket science in which is a better long term investment.
"I work in IT and VMware is used everywhere, they are in Kubernetes big time and the stock has p/s of 5. And yet they seem to be the most hated tech stock. When is DELL going to let this baby fly?"
"Finally showing some signs of life. We are still 10 - 20% undervalued. Until VMW gets out from under Dell, the market is going to hold us back. I can wait it out, but it's still frustrating that we get discounted like this. At the end of the day VMW beat earnings & revenue and raised guidance.... Just a matter of time before we make a real push higher."
Going much lower I think. Avoid.
I don't understand the cash dividend. Does that reflect compensation for potential price drop from large increase of the float? Or is that so they can strap VMW with some of the debt associated Dell's initial acquisition of EMC? so much of it doesn't make sense...

"VMW is a high growth company with great products in a hot market. Dell is a good player in a commodity market with too much debt. Mixing the two helps Dell shareholders at the expense of VMW shareholders. No wonder it is being proposed by Dell's largest shareholders. It smells bad. If Dell wants to solve it's debt problem, it should sell its 80% share of VMW. Not only would this solves Dell's problem, it would free VMW from majority shareholder interest that is held by entities that are putting there own interest ahead of VMW and other VMW shareholders."
This is a continued climb to $160 by next ER in anticipation of a dividend effectively in the 15-18% range
I'm seeing $160 soon
There’s no way this stock stay at this level for long. Cloud computing and security and block Chain technology. This is good consolidation for the stock. Price target $190
"The CEO just sold 20,000 Insider Trading shares at $180. No wonder the price is going down today."

"Big news. VMWCloud expands to Azure.@@@@Dell Technologies, VMware, and Microsoft announced a hybrid cloud partnership that will allow customers to run VMware’s software stack in Microsoft’s Azure public cloud. The new product is called Azure VMware Solutions and it’s built on VMware Cloud Foundation – an integrated software stack with compute (vSphere), storage (vSAN), and network virtualization (NSX) that can be deployed on premises as a private cloud or in public clouds. In this particular case it’s deployed in Azure. The move is also similar to the 2016 hybrid cloud partnership between Amazon and VMware that resulted in VMware Cloud on AWS, which allows customers to run the same VMware software stack on premises or in the AWS public cloud. Under the new partnership, joint Microsoft 365 and VMware Workspace ONE customers will be able to manage Office 365 across devices via cloud-based integration with Microsoft Intune and Azure Active Directory. VMware will also extend the capabilities of Microsoft Windows Virtual Desktop by leveraging VMware Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure.https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/dell-vmware-soar-into-microsoft-azure-with-new-hybrid-cloud-deal/2019/04/"
"last time vmw special return of capital.....went down temporarily,,,,,,allowed you to get money out without selling shares. in ira no effect....x more money to buy more...take it out and pay taxes as ordinary income. in a taxable account......tax free is tax free...and the taxable is capital gains....also if you're over 72 and stock in a ira.....use it to meet the annual distribution, which is required anyway....take ira shares out without selling them, pay the tax......now your shares have a higher basis of what they were transferred at...at this point .zero unrealized gains... just in case."
"I keep reading how many can't wait for the special dividend. The dividend isn't free money for VMW shareholders... The dividend amount will be subtracted from the share price pre-market on ex-dividend date. Unlike smaller dividends, this one will be very visible and many will be left asking why did the share price drop by $25 +/- at the open that day? For long term VMW shareholders, your long term capital gain on that $25 will now turn into taxable income via the dividend. Not good! This is a positive for Michael Dell and Silverlake, but not the everyday shareholder. Just my opinion."
"RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg maintained a Buy rating on VMware (NYSE:VMW) on Thursday, setting a price target of $181"

this earnings report looks good to me. why it still down 10%??? I don't understand.
"They make $3B rev in a quarter and the stock tanks, SNOW already has a higher Market cap and made a measly $275 mil and the stock skyrockets. Annoying market."
So I don't quite follow why VMW stock price gets beat down so much after a fantastic earning report followed by being acquired by Dell.
VMWare could not lose in the 10 B DOD contract it operate in Azure and AWS sounds like win win to me
I worked in VMware for long and I feel this company is destined for success! I haven't bought any more stocks other than what I got in RSU and ESPP. With work from home economy on the rise and companies wanting to save money - storage and network virtualization is going to be of Paramount importance. Not to forget VMW has partnered with AWS and AZure to name a few to offer their esxi solution on the cloud which is a major game changer! I'd be interested in their next earnings call and want to see their traditional ESXi business going up with more license renewal. I'd say VMware is rightly priced and I see a good potential for vmw in 2020
