Poor Guilermo thought this was going to $500How cute is that
Reddit must be squeezing it
Not much longer to wait until barry and brad crawl back under their rocks.
"Since earnings GRPN has not had one day that ended positive. For the cheer leaders out there, the market has been on a tear and this stock has depreciated aka ""dripped"" downward every trading day. What about this company or stock gives you the inkling that it will be turning around soon? BTW its almost time for your Chairman to sell another 1.5M - 3M shares.How many insiders have bought shares on the open market in the past 6 months, year, 1.5 years?"
MM is trying to kill majority of call options! This is why it is down!

"Hope it stays down tomorrow so I can load up. This will end in a buyout, like it should have 10 years ago when Google made a run at them."
Lets rebrand AGAIN. Lets change our business model AGAIN.
I am considering buying and enter by tomorrow. 722M$ Market Cap and 1.1B$ revenue + positive earnings and 130M$ Net Cash...it looks like a good entry point. My buy area will be between 23.8$ and 24.3$. We'll see if I can get some stocks at that price.
Long troubled company now caught CHEATING customers in the UK by not issuing refunds. REVENUE DOWN 33%......3.1 million loss. How about cutting that staff and spending.....this company is so poorly run. Wonder how much cash they have ot pay in fines andrefunds and damages in the UK.
"We’re probably going to witness another 40%+ pop post ER, specially given their large QoQ growth they’re going to announce"
Come on....move slowly or fast....today or tomorrow - I would not sell even 1 share below $45
EBITDA....hahahahaha. Thise are not good numbers. Revenue down. Another LOSS. Endless loses.
"Chief accounting officer just resigned last week, can’t be good"
"New Trend right now, people buying discount goods stocks Via Groupon and dropping it all over the e-commerce networks, Trend going viral in Tictok and dropping sites, it’s booming"
"How is our resident Short Barry the Fairy going, Beat it shorty!!!"
"I love seeing all the Groupon + Live Nation ads for the $20 concert tickets (really awesome and diverse talent -- not a bunch of nobodies). These are the kinds of Groupon deals I've been waiting to see! I hope Groupon can keep it up. Hey G, give Starbucks a call, willya? Those deals would sell out in minutes -- I loved them!!"
Can't keep spinning BAD #s....quarter after quarter.....can't keep drastically out spending what you make. If you look closely they already spent $100 million of the $200 million they borrowed - that money will never be paid back.

"$GRPN Groupon 670M Cap, 565 million in cash, 1 Billion projected revenue 2021, small float, near 52 week low, great company $GRWG $GRPN"
HOLD your shares - This is going to slingshot to $70
"Groupon will be back to $120 before pandemic price, for now, they have more cash than their market cap and more revenue from both"
"Selloff started in March, almost 5 months, laughable. It is way, way, way, overdone. Absolutely oversold. Worth as of today at least $35-$40 even with the every uncertainty priced in.As many say, it might be a buyout attack because 2022 will be huge for the 'experiences' market and groupon is the absolute monopoly in the sector. Possible a 10x revenue growth with the right moves/investments. Groupon has been very conservative, but that might change because, again, the opportunity in 2022 is TENFOLD.Stay greedy with your shares!"
Guilermo you’re comedy will be missedRest In Peace
Love this Dip800M Cap with over 1B revenue The E-Commerce of the business
Statement of Cash Flows for qtr ending 6/30/21. . . shows merchant payables used up $40.7 mill of cash... accrued expenses used up $16.6 mill and Operating Lease Obligations used up another $10.2 mill of cash. Some people are saying it's a hit to cash. And it is. But also reduced Groupon's liabilities. I don't see a problem with negative cash flow to pay down liabilities.

Bellamaxi you’re 28$ shares looking good man!!
Just loaded 1000 share
check out the web analytics for groupon. Not looking good...
"They have more Cash than their market Cap, can they buy themselves?"
"is it a good buy at 23.31 price, please guide. or it will be lower"
"Barry, Brad how are those shorts going, getting worried yet? Watching it go down 7 days in a row and become intoxicating if you are short ,..... be careful grasshopper."
That's a nice chart. When do they account for refunds and chargebacks. A dirty little secret. They done this for 10 years. Company wide.
"hopefully we start Monday with +3. not being greedy, just want to be back pre earnings. and they crushed it so we deserve $40 by Friday"
Groupon is down 6.86% to 28.51

"still bullish, only a matter of time before this pops, Market Makers shaking out weak hands"
21 days to GRPN earnings - It would trade over $40 after that
I’m losing money on GRPN please advise should I hold or sell all ?
"According to Website IQ, LiviingSocial, a subsidiary of Groupon, had 1,602,629 visitors in August, up from 807,000 in February. What's impressive is that LivingSocial is experiencing this exponential growth without advertising. All the website visits are organic as opposed to paid links."
"I started tracking ownership in Groupon. I find this interesting. From 9/14 to 9/21/21, J Hancock small cap went from owning 594.9 thousand shs to owning 793.8 thousand shs... Proshares online went from 498.2 thousand to 687.0 thousand shs... none of the large filers reduced their holdings... just increased holdings... also... short position is getting intersting... as of 8/31/21, 29.3 mill shs o/s and 4.64 mill shs short. The short position is almost a record. If Groupon can continue executing and becoming cash flow positive, shares can definitely rebound."
"Barry and brad, please take it down a little so I can get at a little better price. I want my cost average to look as good as possible. Thanks."

FREE MONEY 750M market Cap with 650M Cash
It was traded at $41 yesterday after hour upon both earning and revenue beat. What happened this morning?
"Hi guys , just checking , if Melissa GRPN is still CFO dont expect nothing , this will move the day she leave"
"Actually, there is a negative in the confer call that may have sunk the stock. But I don't know how negative it really is. Groupon stated they expect only $970.0 mill of revenue for full year '21. Given ytd rev thru 6/30/21 of $529.8 mill, this means next 2 quarters of revenue will only be $440.2 mill. Or only $220.1 mill per quarter. Vs. $529.8 mill in first half of '21... or $264.9 mill/qtr. Dropping from $266.0 mill in 2Q21 to only $220.1 mill/qtr for next two quarters may or may not be that bad. Some of the lost revenue will be due to the completion of the outsourced Product model. Better question is can Groupon regain profitability and cash flow positive from operations going forward. Given the Services automation and Product sales being fully outsourced, I think Groupon can indeed be profitable going forward."
"Yahoo has a $45 price target on this, I bought yesterday"
Its like they badly missed earningswhat a horror show
"Melissa, you took GRPN from $60 to $24 and still dont get the message , leave now before it getting worth"
"lastly from a technical point of view, GRPN's indicators are showing EXTREMELY OVERSOLD. In other words, as of now a stable level is going to be at least 10-15 points higher, which would show the 35 level. And my friends, as always, stay greedy with your shares!"
When does GRPN come and admit compamy wide they have been scamming customers over refunds and not reporting chargebacks? Chargebacks a huge part of this business - you never hear about it.
Bellamaxi told you“ Alot of hands and fingers lost on this one today. Never too old to re-learn some disciplines every so often. Makes next week exciting.”LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Crypt-On, a subsidiary of Groupon. Yeah, has a nice ring to it."
Time to buy
"Fascinating price action today I must say. I will say most earnings reports as of late have been a sell on the news whether good or bad report. I have several stocks that had great earnings and sold off, then all recovered in next couple of days. We will see what happens here."
Can $ABNB buy $GRPN
probably good time to sell...
Bellamaxi best you speak with Alex Guilermo and Zeljanica You’re all up to speed so to speak......
"I think Groupon is slowly recovering from the Pandemic. I'm seeing more restaurant deals by me but not like the old days. Between the streamlined and cheaper way for restaurants to post deals, I think business will slowly come back."
So they were ripping off UK customers by not issuing refunds when due. Ill gotten gains. Money that DOES NOT belong to them. If they were doing this in the UK they are doing it in other places. Public company not counting/issuing refunds - hmmmm. So the numbers are incorrect at some point AND I am sure the UK issues fines.
How are those class action lawsuits coming along??? The ones where the know GRPN cheated customers on refunds. The one that will expose how GRPN does not account for refunds or chargebacks. Very serious accounting errors. This is a public company. You can't cook the books.
"For those who have been following and invested in this stock, your first red flag was managements lack of confidence by not using any of the $245M remaining in buyback authorization. Now with 75% of the stock held by institutions there will be a fire sale tomorrow. I expect at least 150M shares traded with a closing price around $1.70. The company has proposed a 1 for 10 to 1 for 12 reverse split. This translates into a $17-22 share price post RS."
Buffet normally doesn’t open below 1B dollar positions and the only reason he has not bought is probably due to market size
This is seriously soooo oversold
Mlyon tells you “ $45 by October”LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"This Groupon is amazing, from merchant, food delivery, traveling, services, attractions, professional…Etc, this is the really e-commerce that sell anything, now more amazing is that Groupon has build out its self-service platform so that merchants can list deals themselves on the platform, and almost 50% of North America deal launches during the quarter were done through self-service tools, they also launched recently the Personalized User Experience…I believe in Groupon, if they turndown 6B buyout offer from Google 10 years ago they going to score big here with this self market place, it’s unlimited"
"Alex saidTold you folks, this is an 80$ stock, with a potential upside to 100 if we also beat strongly Q3 estimates. Highly undervalued even by Buffet standards, let alone the strong growth potentialLOL!!!!!!!!!"
Hope to buy some tomorrow
Who uses Groupon?
"Melissa, This is about when you announce a stock buyback program, do some insider buying and/or issue the infamous PR that goes like this 'Groupon Exploring Strategic Options'..... LOLLet's see some SEC Form 4s by this evening. Might get an SC13 as well with all this volume."
"Morning Melissa, have a look and let us all know when you think GRPN is under value ,did you start looking for new place you better do"
"I don't know why you guys mention the cash on hand is bigger than the market cap, because that one does not really that much.It's about the equity (assets - liabilities) that should be pointed out, which is 50 millions...The cashflow also looks very bad..Just passing by over here, GL :)"
"On 3/23/21... Groupon issued $200 mill of convertible notes... 1.125%... mature 3/15/26... conversion price $68.12... given Groupon's depressed share price of only $31/sh... isn't this convertible note almost ""free money"" to Groupon?"
Just Text my parents SPA ticket
Mlyon brother Of Bellamaxi??
At what point do we get private equity and activist investor interest?. Like now.
Grpn is the costco for e-commerence. It should be trading at least $60.My target price in 12 month is $75.

Between the streamlined process for placing ads and growing short position… I can see profits and share price going much higher￼

I am a long term investor. Groupon's earning yesterday was in fact super impressive. Wall Street expected a loss of 3 cents when Groupon announced huge profit which led the stock jumped over $41 after hour. There isn't any negative news since the report after hour and this morning which made the drop super ridiculous.
"Melissa , did you sign your resignation letter or not yet ? market is waiting and till than soon you will be under $1 and you know what this mean be careful and take responsability"
Tried to warn traders. This dog was only propped up by Hedge Funds - the hedge funds do care about the company - all they wanted to do as group was to manipulate the stock. The CFO and all CFOs do not spin the story - she told facts.
I’m getting the F outta this as soon as it hits $28 if ever
"showing a lot of weakness,,,, only way it will move up is on a buyout, unless it has triple the revenue... never going to happen."
CFO should be fired. Too funny - warning of all the problems ahead.
Goes down to $20 on the 5th. Sinking dog.
"I think 3Q21 earnings will surprise on the upside. Someone correct me i’m wrong, but hasn’t Groupon contracted out the non-coupon deals? So all the travel and goods are pure profit and handled by a third party? With restaurants opening back up, number of deals should grow. The old process of having to deal with agents to list and modify restaurant deals has been streamlined. Restaurant deals can now be self-filled and so much easier to list. I’m looking for revenue to stablilize and costs to decrease."
"Melissa, this is total lack of confidence at you and GRPN , do you have something to say which you didnt on Fri ? do you have anything to add or to clarify to the market which you believe they didnt understand ? do it now before will be too late"
Guilermo told you it’s going to $500LOL!!!!!!!!
"Also Groupon has done very little to attract millenials. There might be crypto acceptance in the very near future and maybe we will finally see crypt-On, the recently leaked Groupon crypto. That will probably make headlines everywhere and double the PPS in a few days.Stay greedy with your shares amigos!"
GRPN will bounce back ever? Ok
"Groupon Chief Financial Officer Michael Randolfi Resigns >GRPN8:55 am ET August 22, 2019 (Dow Jones) PrintBy Colin Kellaher Groupon Inc. (GRPN) on Thursday said Michael Randolfi resigned as chief financial officer to pursue another opportunity. The Chicago online daily-deals provider said Melissa Thomas will serve as interim chief financial officer while it conducts a search for a permanent replacement. Groupon said Ms. Thomas, 39 years old, will also continue to serve in her current role as chief accounting officer and treasurer. Mr. Randolfi had been Groupon's chief financial officer since April 2016. The company said his resignation wasn't due to any disagreement on any matter."

"Groupon to Release First Quarter 2020 Financial Results on June 16, 2020BusinessWireGroupon, Inc. announced today that it intends to release its first quarter 2020 financial results on Tuesday, June 16, 2020 after the close of market trading. The Company will file its Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission, issue a press release, and post a letter to stockholders and a slide presentation to its IR website.While Groupon will not host a conference call to discuss its first quarter financial results, the company does intend to host a conference call when it discloses second quarter financial results in August. The Interim CEO, CFO and investor relations team will be available for follow-up calls with investors and analysts after the first quarter financial results have been disclosed."
"Btw, this does seem to be moving in opposite direction of Facebook. Others have mentioned it, but could be a pairs trade unwinding, plus rotation into value. The index funds control and overshoot to both sides (high and low) so that rotation maximizes profit. Pretty fun trick - you don't have to forecast the weather if you ARE the weather (ie. Vanguard, State Street, etc.)."
Hedgefunds on Friday getting some of that Melissa Thomas love
"There are here still a lot of people that got here only because they did a filter for reverse split and the GRPN symbol popped up. So they started shorting at $20, then at $30, then at $40, then at $50. LOL Guillermo invites you to stay here till $100, in 2021.There are very few shares thanks to the reverse split, so covering is pretty tough. Four out of five reverse split end up badly because done by companies in extremely tough situation losing money and so on. Groupon is PROFITABLE.So Groupon statistically belongs to that one of out five reverse splits that end up EXTREMELY WELL. Please stick around. We need you to keep chasing the stock price all the way to $100, this year.THANK YOU!"
Is Groupon offering on line real estate deals?
"No share offerings, operations and cash flow must be fine."

How would GRPN look in FB’s portfolio?
"Investment ThesisGroupon (GRPN) is a stock I have recommend in my Marketplace to Deep Value Return members.This stock has been left for dead at less than 6x its EBITDA. Meanwhile, recent balance sheet movements leave Groupon less leveraged, as it pays back its higher convertible instrument with lower interest rates convertibles.Even though this is clearly a reopening trade investment and readers should keep their eyes fixed on its 2022 targets, those willing to buy now and wait 12 months should be nicely rewarded over the coming year.Why Groupon? Why Now?Groupon is far from the company you will previously remember. Groupon is under new management, with CEO Aaron Cooper taking the reins last year. But as you know, the pandemic fully gripped this company's prospects.What's critical here is that there is absolutely no enthusiasm towards this company. Even if the stock is up since the pandemic lows.Looking in hindsight to where the stock has been won't help you too much about thinking where the stock is headed. The stock remains incredibly cheaply valued at less than 6x next year's EBITDA target of $250 million. However, before we dig down further into its valuation, allow me to offer you some context.Historically, Groupon relied on giving customers large discounts on things that they didn't want. However, the strategy today is that Groupon offers customers smaller discounts but on Local services. But even more important, it's about increasing the frequency of customer purchases.Groupon is determined to not only increase the number of offers on its app but increasing customers' repeat purchases. Groupon has an effective customer acquisition platform for merchants."

I have owned GRPN and made money and lost money at different times with the stock. It missed earnings and revenue estimates yesterday and the stock price deserve to drop. It is the announcement of the R/S in my opinion that caused its big drop because typically a forced R/S only causes the stock to drop further. I am a consumer and buy the groupons on sale. There is a decent market out there that makes it viable and is good for small and large businesses alike. The company has net cash and is not in the red from what I can understand. I am holding and looking to add. Thoughts.
Barry you enjoying the show? Absolutely hilarious
Good luck getting any refunds.

They had some interesting insights about GRPN on (http://Fairstox.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"The technicals are showing a potential momentum trend reversal here w/ a reversion to the mean. If that's the case, may be a tough day for clown face Barry.

"All the shorts are betting this third wave will be brutal. In reality there are many countries where covid cases/ICUs are going to zero. So as my gringo cousin Bill Gates said, Covid will be done in 2022. And stock like Groupon and the travel sector are going to skyrocket in the near future. Make it a 2x, 3x from this level. Patience is required, but yes, today's valuation is insanely low! So shorting Groupon now may become a 'deadly' trap. Good luck shorts you will need it!And my friends, as always, stay greedy with your shares!"
When do they unfold how GRPN cheats customers on refunds. And how GRPN does not account for refunds and chargebacks.
"After GRPN stock tanked last week... did a deep dive into Groupon's financials. I'm more bullish than ever. Here's what I found... anyone feel free to correct me: #1 - Groupon makes money on Services & Product. For Services, such as restaurants and nail salons, revenue seems to be holding up relatively well, i.e., $172.6 mill for qtr ending 3/31/21 vs $206.2 mill for qtr-ending 6/30/21. For Service revenue, proitability looks good going forward. Groupon has shifted emphasis to allow merchants to do self-service without the need for sales reps. For these reasons, I expect Service-related revenue and profit to increase as Service-related expenses go lower. Over time, Service Revenue will grow as more restaurants re-open and excess capacity comes back. For Product revenue, such as bed sheets and sunglasses, profit is just about guaranteed given the sales model. For Product revenue, Groupon transitioning to a ""net profit"" third party model. In 1Q21, Product revenue $91.2 mill vs 2Q21 revenue of $59.8 mill. On Product, I have no worries about profits going forward. Per 2020 10-K,... ""We have transitioned to a third-party marketplace in North America as of the end of 2020 and will begin to transition to a third-party . . . marketplace in International in the second quarter 2021. Following the International transition, we expect our Goods category to primarily generate revenue on a net basis within service revenue . . ."" In summary, going forward, I expect to see greater profit from both Service and Product revenue. And lower expenses due to self-service."
Is it a buy?
"The noise with Groupon is that it is difficult to see how much of the decline in growth was due to the pandemic and how much is due to its own mismanagement. My take is that most of the decline is due to the pandemic effect. Clearly the focus on cost cutting had also an impact on growth. Still the breakeven rate is now much lower and the company will report a 115 mio EBITDA for the year. Many doubt that the model is sustainable on the long term. It is up to Groupon to prove that after having cut costs aggressively and improved profitability the company can grow again thanks to a return to the pre-covid times and the improvement in the way to do business. Time will tell, but on a best case scenario the stock could double or triple."
