"I see the CFO is leaving. I am not surprised. There will account adjustments coming and it will not be pretty. You actually have to account for refunds, pay refunds, and include chargebacks in your financials. This company has millions in refunds and chargebacks that were not reported. Someone shuould check those bank accounts."

Surprised Groupon hasn’t formed a partnership with Uber eats… doorDash… And similar partners… Maybe they will at some point￼
"I think 3Q21 earnings will surprise on the upside. Someone correct me i’m wrong, but hasn’t Groupon contracted out the non-coupon deals? So all the travel and goods are pure profit and handled by a third party? With restaurants opening back up, number of deals should grow. The old process of having to deal with agents to list and modify restaurant deals has been streamlined. Restaurant deals can now be self-filled and so much easier to list. I’m looking for revenue to stablilize and costs to decrease."
1 month Black Friday Botox is the best sell sale out there
"you guys want a good stock that will double your money, $GRPN, market cap of 630 million, hovering near all time lows, ER set for November 5"
Interesting how GRPN insiders SOLD at the inflated prices when it hit $60.........SCAM. Hedges funds working with them.

Anyone know why most of restaurant deals are with Local Flavor? Seems Groupon is the more well-known name
"For everyone bashing your going to miss out, CFO leaving was her taking an opportunity at a bigger company as Melissa Thomas is now the CFO at Cinemark. Groupon was affected by Covid and will definitely rebound, expecting a great ER next week"
"I started tracking ownership in Groupon. I find this interesting. From 9/14 to 9/21/21, J Hancock small cap went from owning 594.9 thousand shs to owning 793.8 thousand shs... Proshares online went from 498.2 thousand to 687.0 thousand shs... none of the large filers reduced their holdings... just increased holdings... also... short position is getting intersting... as of 8/31/21, 29.3 mill shs o/s and 4.64 mill shs short. The short position is almost a record. If Groupon can continue executing and becoming cash flow positive, shares can definitely rebound."
21 days to GRPN earnings - It would trade over $40 after that
Groupon will not go away. Low float stock with a lot of insiders holder. People are still using groupon and local experiences will continue to grow next year as travel reopens.
