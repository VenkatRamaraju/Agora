New max9 striker fired compact pistol hitting the market. Good timing. Marketshare in this popular type of carry gun is currently dominated by the hard to find p365 and hellcat offerings from competitors. The lc9s wasn’t penetrating this area of the market but the max9 shows promise.
Not supposed to sell off like this. Gun tragedy generally bring solid buying. Sigh.....
Any dip is a buying opportunity ahead of these monster earnings
"will rgr increase the dividend? they have great balance sheet, lots of cash coming in ... they should return more to shareholders ...and they can also give me a discount on ammo"
"if we consider the early reaction to the pandemic's threat to the economy and it's potential for spilling over into civil/social unrest and then frame that self-preservation instinct in terms of let's say new product or technology adoption curves, particularly in march and april as it relates to first time gun buyers, we can see that this surge represents let's call it ""phase one"" or ""early adopters"" which typically represents about 15% of a given population. phase two will be comprised of the next roughly 35% (called ""early majority adopters"") which is the period we are entering into only now and probably throughout the summer as the threat of unrest lingers and grows. later this year and into next we will start to see ""the other half"" i.e., people historically and philosophically resistant to the bearing of arms capitulate and start to put their own personal safety first and jump on board ""just in case"". in other words, the surge we saw in march/april will be dwarfed in the latter half of this year. also it is important to recognize that q1 was strong on the back on march sales alone. q2 will have the benefit of a full quarter of strong and growing sales. a new all-time high is just around the corner and triple digits is within spitting distance. as usual analysts will be late to the party but i fully expect to see upgrades in price targets to 80, 90 even 100+ once we've set in a new all time high crossing the $71 threshold. it's not a question of if, just when."
"Sturm, Ruger & Company is up 4.90% to 90.76"
Bet the libs are having a field day seeing a 12% uptick in RGR! hahaha
"A quick internet search shows that this is far from the first time Citi Bank has tried to impose themselves when it comes to gun sales. In the past they have even tried to block transactions between gun dealers. With their history I doubt that there are many in the gun industry that use Citi bank. So other than a PR opportunity for Citi, actual sales impact will be minimal."
Looks like investors are finally seeing a good value stock that pays a nice div.
Ex-dividend date today. Just seeing a market adjustment in response to the special $5/share special dividend payable at the end of the month.
"RGR’s innovation outlook is neutral based on a current score of 54 out of 99, outperforming sector average. Insiders sentiment is negative. It is most exposed to ARC Group Worldwide, Inc. as its supplier. Over the past 4 quarters RGR beat earnings estimates 2 times and it pays dividend lower than its peers."
Question for you guys- If Trump re-elected will gun stocks tank as a result? Seems like they rally when a democratic president is elected due to fear of them being taken away. Thoughts?
Looking forward to the earnings report. My bet is that they sold every firearm that they made and the only issue they have is that they can't make them fast enough.
State restrictions going into affect. Be ready.
"RGR will stay flat til the US Senate control get cleared up in January. If the Dems control it, they’ll surely start neutering the second amendment which is one of the last hurdles in the path of their absolute power control over the population.. The Dems are savvy enough not to eliminate the second amendment completely at first. They will play the long game and just modify it enough to neuter it for any new purchases from then on."
Get the word out not to shop at REI. REI is trying to pressure Vista Outdoors to put out a press statement on gun control. The left is also putting pressure on financial firms to not have gun manufacturers stocks in their portfolios. Conservatives need to voice our opinions by not using these firms/companies. Let's face it the left is not going to stop from trying to take away our 2nd amendment rights. We need to mobilize together like they do.
Low inventory in FL as well. we may be seeing 4 to 5 times normal demand. I would guess production ramp up will take time. I believe they are crushing all sales expectations.
"2 million new gun buyers this year. Guns sales were soaring during the pandemic. They've exploded due to the leftist rioting. Now, even independents and liberals are buying guns since their Democratic Mayors and Governors won't stop the rioting. The liberal DAs aren't even charging most of the looters/rioters. They just let them go. If these people don't get in trouble for rioting, and the police are told to stand down, you'd be crazy not to own several guns to protect your family. Expect sales to be strong for the remainder of the year. If Biden wins the election(not likely), expect another strong surge in gun sales. If Trump wins, expect more rioting from the sore loser party. Gun sales will still be strong. Gun and ammunition sales should be super strong the next 6 months."
i wouldn't be surprised if an offer was made for the company ... it is too cheap here ...
RGR printing money like SWBI. Ainti-WS stock so buy all you can while their blinders are on.
Will be up after conference call
"Looks like Pedo President and friends are about to restrict the Constitutional rights because criminals who don't obey laws are still murdering people. Divide(color of skin, gender, creed, ect.) and Conquer(restrict law abiding citizens)."
"If you own a gun and want to keep your gun freedoms, you'll make sure gun stocks are a part of your portfolio. Need the libs to boycott gun stocks so we can get the goya and Lindell effect and take these shorts to the Game Stop!"
71 cent quarterly dividend payable March 26. that's double last quarter's
"The ""ANAList's"" estimates were too darn high. This isn't a Christmas Quarter. They blew out earnings and revenue compared to last year. 200% Increase and 35% increase. Sturm Ruger & Co (NYSE:RGR) reported quarterly earnings of $1.05 per share which missed the analyst consensus estimate of $1.23 by 14.63 percent. This is a 200 percent increase over earnings of $0.35 per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $130.30 million which missed the analyst consensus estimate of $167.06 million by 22.00 percent. This is a 35.27 percent increase over sales of $96.33 million the same period last year."
"Below 72.50, good entry....near that in premarket..."
BULL. Only ONE analyst/firm covers RGR. Lake Street. Price Target $92 is way too low. Market cap is a bargain. No debt and printing money. Great yield and a just-announced per share dividend of $5.00. Big.MEGA BULL
Sturm Ruger reached an all time high at 87.15
What the heck. They beat on both earnings and revenue.
Close to $100M in dividends get paid out on Friday 8/28. If you are short - may want to start covering now.
"not sure what happened to my last couple of posts, they seem to keep disappearing. anyway, as I said previously I believe there is a seismic shift going on in terms of public awareness and preparedness and from what I can see it crosses party lines. the trend is your friend. and the trend is solidly in place for the foreseeable future, which is why I see new highs coming this year, probably sooner rather than later. triple digits not out of the question. will this post survive? who knows? maybe i'll post it without the link to the article on april sales first and then post that separately and see what happens."
Going to $60 in next 2 months as talk of gun legislation heats up and mid term election looming
"Wife just went for gun license 3 weeks ago, done with the first part and has August date for fingerprinting and back round checks. almost a 2 month wait...now tell me we are not going higher. YEAH RIGHT,,,see you at $100 by end of august"
Looks like the public perception is that it's good to be armed during a public health crisis.

"The AP is apparently trying to shame the index funds into dropping Ruger, etc. by telling us “you may own gun stocks and not know it.” We’re supposed to be appalled of course."
"The PC9 is selling like crazy...it took me months to get one. Best take down rifle in a long time, and it's a pistol caliber carbine. Great products here. I just hope they are smart enough to make it in different calibers"
Have a look at POWW. I think you will like this ammo stock. Time to buy while it's cheap. It's time to BUY BUY BUY
Sales here in Co. are doing really well... have to wait for ER to see how much it affects overall though...
the more you say we can't have this the more we want I think sales are going to be through the roof
That was a great Qtr for RGR. Nice dividend payout too. I bet they are selling everything they can make. I think SWBI is taking some market share away though since they could ramp up manufacturing faster than RGR. SWBI should have a monster QTR. NICS checks should break a record for July. I don't think gun sales are slowing anytime soon.
"This is quite possibly the perfect stock. If republicans are in office, the media fear mongers and people buy guns, if Dems in office they threaten gun control and people buy guns and ammo. No analyst will talk about it in CNBC Bloomberg or yahoo finance, so it cannot be manipulated! Only small improvement I can think of would be for RGR to do a stock buyback and recuse share count!! I will never sell this stock!"
Anything sub 70$ seems undervalued now
Record Jan sales of marlin stock should propel earnings
What has changed from q3 2018 except more buyers?
more gun control over real and fake guns after this NYC attack. We may see a reversal tomorrow. So sad about the NYC incident.
Somebody must have got an early peek at the June nics check numbers
NICs were put out conveniently on Tuesday before market close on Wednesday. NICs were second biggest November Ever.
Earnings report will send this upwards quickly.
"liberal analyst won't cover the stock, its amazing to me the political hacks creep into every dark alley in our country"
Lost its biggest salesman Obama
"Great run today by SWBI and RGR. I think the upside will continue for the next 2 years because COVID-19 is not going anywhere. Sales started increasing since Covid-19 and current defunding of police proposals are pushing them higher. Overall, these 2 stocks will continue do well over the next 6 months and will continue in that motion till 2022."
Michigan Gov whither appoints anti gun advocate to the nrc with no experience in game management. And he’s a very close ally to Bloomberg. Let’s put more people in a position of power that have no clue about the position being hired for. I’d like to say unbelievable but unfortunately it is believable and true.
Where’s the up?
"Genuine question , is the upside for the next 5 months already priced into RGR current price ? Ive done alot of due diligence on this but gun manufacturers is a new investment area for me. RGR balance sheet looks great , seems ot be a well managed company and 2 million new permit holders has to translae into earnings. Im looking for a long term hold for some of my recent earnings from the broader market pop. Thanks in advance"
"FYI Smith & Wesson's earnings estimates should triple, not the earnings coming up but the next quarter is going to be huge. There isn't a Smith AR-15 for sale at all my distributors nationwide. In the last 3 days alone tens of thousands were sold and a lot of people are buying 3-4 at a time. You can't imagine what we went through at our store today. 130 in stock in the morning and sitting on 52 now. Time to load up. I finally feel very comfortable buying shares in huge quantities especially at these levels. This is at least a double at these prices with whats going on in this crazy world. Ruger is totally is sold out of AR's also."
"Time to buy...way over done, this will be back in the $50 at some point in the next year. Next mass shooting and threats of gun control and it's back at $55+"
"Afghanistan cells coming soon, Anne get ur gun!"
"Record background checks, again......FBI numbers show 2,002,992 background checks were conducted in May 2018. The previous May record was 1,942,677 background checks conducted during that month in 2017.This follows an April in which 2,223,213 background checks conducted, setting the record for the highest number of checks in any April in history. And that followed a March which set the record for the highest number of background checks conducted during any March in history."
"Just read that Walmart is returning firearms and ammunition to ""the floor"" in their stores that carry them, FWIW."
what's causing the rally?
Probably only wealthy people will own guns in 4 years.
Government NICS second highest October ever.
Makes perfect sense. Earnings increase significantly with good dividend payout and demand continuing to soar. Why wouldn't it go down?
Knicks Highest June ever

"I love Ruger, own a few of their guns and made money as the stock went up. Unfortunately, gun demand has peaked and with Trump in charge, the 2nd Amendment will be safe. This is bad news for RGR & AOBC (formerly SWHC). RGR will go down to $40 this year, $30 in 2-years and back in the $teens in 3-years...then the company should go private. Don't fool yourself in thinking that this will go back up. If you buy and hold this stock now, it will be the most painful holding in your portfolio. It will be death by a thousand cuts every month, as new background checks come out and they will begin to flatten then decline. Don't make the mistake of loving the stock because you love the product. This will be the easiest stock pick of the next 4-years...either short RGR or just sell your stock and walk away...being happy with what you made."
RGR is up 5.23% to 45.30
something is stirring...
What time is earnings after the bell?
Sturm Ruger reached an all time high at 89.35
"All of the gun stocks are going up. RGR, POWW, and VSTO are going to keep rising."

"NICS check numbers are down month over month this month. They have been trending down since March.Thumbs down this post if you want, but it is true."
"Surprise!!! Trump won and everybody dumps gun stocks. I welcome the opportunity to buy low. RGR and SWHC will continue to do well. More people have become gun-owners, and will want to own more guns."
Earnings report. Estimate to beat the street next Monday
"Gun Control are bad optics for any party.Eventually someone will smarten up and control the purchase of bullets.Individual can buy and use at range as much as they want .strictly monitored.Hunters can turn in spent cartridges for replacements.Individual can buy box of 10 rounds , one box per month. Entered and tracked in data base.Will cut down on people flying off handle.Not the answer but a workable compromise."
Only a matter of time before this thing is hitting $100 and all time highs. Quality stock.
Anyone else hoping for another $5 dividend? I've been trying to buy a Ruger for months and dealers are always out
Every article try to claim sales arnt up but then they usually reference last year. All I know Is my favorite on line gun store sold over 200 s&w mp sport II in a month. Thats just one type of gun. They are currently out of stock there.
"San Jose just passed an ordinance that would tax gun owners. Under the law, guns can be confiscated if the tax is not paid. This was just carried on the cable news channels last night so may have something to do with the sell off. The fear could be that other major cities will follow suit."
Barely a mention of RGR earnings on CNBC or Bloomberg. Do the gun control lobbyists control who/what they can promote?
Any thoughts where this is going? At 53.65 Ill be up 10% in 45 days. Feel like I should hold though. Not much conversation and the media keeps talking about last year and remington trying to suggest all gun manufacture are going under. I know its not politically correct but wish the news would talk about the last 30 days.
Witnessed the latest fire sale of the insiders between $75 to $85? Yeesh. Hopefully it will subside soon.
"https://time.com/5819728/gun-retailers-atf-coronavirus/""Gun retailers can still offer curbside services to sell guns and ammunition to customers amid the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) announced in an industry letter published Friday.Firearms businesses have been already deemed an “essential service” by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, even as thousands of “nonessential” businesses remain closed and the Trump administration is urging people to stay home to prevent the spread of coronavirus. (Other essential businesses include grocery stores, hospitals and pharmacies.)"""
when large mutual funds decide that they Will not have gun stocks in their portfolio this stock will go to Zero
Simple formula - supply/demand. Demand is there. Supply is not. I'm the biggest gun store on Long Island. There is no product availability.
Gun sales are up big since last year with people and business owners purchasing guns for personal and property protection. I’m looking forward to earnings release.
"BULL. Simple. 8 year tight base for 7 years $58 to $80. Once this breaks $80 and holds (which it will do) it is a freight train to $100 then $150+. Dividend yield above 1%. No long term debt. Record breaking demand in a frenzied, insane lockdown. Perfect storm for bulls. The morons that do not see it is their own myopic lack of logical conclusions."
"Im really impressed with my security 9, at like 1/2 the price of my Glock, also security 9 fits my Glock 19 holster￼"

This is how you run a company clean balance sheet nice growth!
"Sadly sold today. Dennis I have appreciated your sales input. I wonder if there is different regions selling at different paces. I believe your neck of the woods is an old Northeastern manufacturing town. I wonder how the South, Southwestern and Western states are doing when it comes to sales."
"Rumors of expanded gun control and more mass shootings, shrinking police forces and budgets =more gun and ammo sales."
Will see $70 after the election.
"Folks this stock is very very undervalued. Recently we have had pressure on the NRA to be destroyed by the far left and that has put pressure on us. No reason for this stock to have come down over $10 within days. Demand for Guns will only increase going into the election and especially if JOE BIDEN wins ( God forbid). They are anti police and constitution and i am telling you now GUN SALES already have explode and will even more over the coming months. Fingerprinting in some parts of Florida for a gun license is a 5 MONTH wait, not a typo my friends, RGR is a strong buy and will only get better. BUY BUY BUY"
Is this stock ever going to go back up.
Make shorts cover at $100+
"Looks like the past two days the fact that RGR has earnings, no debt (hence not affected by increase in interest rates), a very nice dividend and all that for a laughable p/e may make RGR a superior investment..., me thinksIMO, this may be the beginning of the ""big lesson"" the feel-good millennials so desperately need!!"
Great company. Great customer service.
loaded up on AOBC options for Friday. Rgr earnings will move it as well. Jump on good news or bad will pay well. Just can't have it not move on announcement.
"If Biden/Beto/AOC win in November, gun sales will go through the roof for the 2 months before they take office. It will be like last call."
MONSTER earning coming!
Think it popped today? Wait till mid terms if it even looks close. You may be able to retire early.
"NRA filed bankruptcy, leaving ny going to tx for a last stance, not looking good for gun owners.already we lost the right to free speech ,we now have censorship,gun manufacturers are next"
Build a nice 6 month base. Looking for a nice breakout soon. Earnings reports likely to provide the stimulus for the breakout.
"Could this stop going up for a bit, so I could get some too? Please and thank you."
"I just read that the appellate court in CA just struck down the state's limit on magazine capacities, FWIW."
"It's sort of interesting to watch people trying to figure out whether the capital appreciation will be enough to counteract the drop that will probably come when the dividends get distributed. It's tempting, but I just can't see enough a move up from here (in the short-term) to offset the dividends about to be paid. After that distribution settles out, and gun-makers start getting more product to their dealers, then RGR breaks $100 pretty easily. That should be in the next month or so. Just a WAG though. Good luck, longs."
Sturm Ruger is up 5.91% to 86.18
When are earnings being dropped? I thought it was today after close?
"Watch out, this will be $90 by July"
"Does anyone here know why there doesn't seem to be a message (""conversations"") board for SWBI (Smith and Wesson)?"
Broke 50! Awesome!
Why did they drop the comment section at SWBI?
u can't buy enough guns...better buy now before it's too late
Remington just filed for bankruptcy.
Contemplating cost averaging up. So much cash. Another special dividend this August? GLTA.
steady progress on march to $80. There is a good chance in the two days that we hit $80 plus when the good earnings number is released!
Hope other longs added as well on today’s pessimism. GLTA.
Why does this stock just continue to fall?
$SWBI has better margins and growing revenue. Why buy Ruger?
Civil war sentiment is brewing stronger in full swing now. All gun and ammo stocks will garner more attention and rotated inflow naturally. Watch MFI and Stochastic indicators and go with the flow to be just one step ahead of the FOMO retailers.
"RGR will now sell hundreds of thousands of large capacity magazines into the California market. 10/22 installed base, mini 14, pistols etc. They will sell as many as they can make. Buy the stock here."
I am surprised this has been stuck in a range for about a year. Ruger and Smith and Wesson have been making a killing :) I see another 10-12 million new gun owners this year and about the same next year!
today's divergence is telling. the market is forward looking. people all across the land are starting to wake up to reality and it's not pretty. rgr is not only a defensive play in troubled times but will most likely turn into a momentum play as wall street money starts following all the main street money pouring into gun & ammo purchases in preparation for what is likely to be a very ugly & unruly period ahead
These gun stocks are so confusing I swear.none of this makes sense to me. Doesn’t matter who wins the election but 2 things are for sure.A. Gun Sales will continue to surgeB. Nobody will ever be able to take away your second amendment right.
riots and stock price .. do the maths
ruger should buy Remington
any other stock picks for rioting? RGR is the only one I can think of. What other firearm/home defense/home security stocks are out there?
Is it just me or do the gun companies tend to go the opposite of the market? Many days everything is down and they are up and now everything is up and they are down.
NICS checks for March look good.
Cali is the cesspool of the nation. How ppl live there is beyond me. Cali will hopefully turn red to clean up the leftists politicians. Fork Cali make it its own country under water.
"Despite current situation settling down, they still will sell record amounts of products!"
Citi says it will place limits on business partners who sell guns to anyone who is under the age of 21.
"I agree that firearm sales are off the charts. Go into any sporting goods store that sells guns and you'll see a lot of emptiness on the shelves and in the cases. There's no question that a lot of money will be made by gun manufacturers like Ruger IF they can supply the demand. What I find disconcerting is that the shelves are staying empty, like the companies cannot supply the demand. Is it because of Covid closings of the various factories, or what? What I see as a possibility at earnings is nice earnings beat. However, if they can't supply the demand, guidance would seem to be necessarily weak. Big earnings, lots of background checks, etc., but nothing for customers to buy. Is this just a California thing?"
"Below 74, I'm a buyer..not until."
Cash: 187.5 million. Debt: $2.5 million. Forward PE: 22. Couple this with momentum from potential gun sales from the unrest in the US. Keep selling. I’ll be happy to buy!
Yahoo rates $RGR as overvalued. $RGR has a P/E of eleven and a 4% Dividend. And they have no debt. Are they on drugs.
Third biggest July NICs Ever
I am new to the board and a long time Ruger fan and RGR shareholder. When will ammo supplies get back to normal?
Sturm Ruger reached a 52 Week high at 81.43
"I'm confused how a stock with no LT debt, record sales, and a solid earnings beat could be down two consecutive days. What am I missing?"
Once they pass HR127 say goodbye to ruger stocks. In fact say goodbye to the stock market as well because once they regulate guns out of existence then they'll find more things to regulate out of existence.
"Wall street is expecting a Blue wave. Democrats have been good for the gun industry because they cause fear of gun regulations leading to panic purchasing. The price was driven down on the ""miss"" so that it can be rode up after the primary's. Bought mine this morning at just above 56. Now looking for exit."
"gun control will be on the hill next week, hopefully this will move soon."
RGR is up 5.07% to 52.74
"Looking to enter around 45-48, along long term trend-line."
"Buy all you can, shorts last stand, they will try to shake the tree but SWBI will be out next week and both will be at new highs soon. Gun sales won't be slowing anytime soon, still hard to find. No special sales or markdowns to suppliers = great margins."
"Red flag legislation and executive orders pushing all firearms to even more staggering sales and higher stock values, thanks Joe!"
I don't understand why Ruger and S&W are dropping. I just got home from my local Cabala's store; handgun cabinet was only about 15% full and the rifle and shotgun rack about the same. Guns are still selling. Wondering: Are they (Ruger and S&W) just totally out of inventory? Suspect the virus stuff is keeping production down some.Thoughts?
"One inside sells 5,000 share sand the stock tanks. This company has no debt, solid balance sheet, real earnings, and sports a P/E of 10. The management team is strong. We have one liberal analyst at Argus that is always a bear, they must have a huge short position. Plus Firearms, are in high demand. Even the latest Background check numbers point to a great holiday sales forecast. I am adding to my positions at these levels."
Highest numbers for May NICS checks
"Numbers were great, but now we'll have a sell-off because numbers didn't beat ridiculous projections?"
Boom. Stage 2 of the civil war 2 has begun. Patriots don’t buy imported guns from china. RGR will be fine and could do another special dividend next quarter.
concidering starting a position on monday looks like it's due for some upward action
Could the time to buy AOBC be right for Ruger ? Big opportunity for complete dominance and a cost consolidation looks like would be a better single company in the future
Right now Trump is speaking from the White House. Comments on Tariffs were expected but he is also addressing background checks and limits on bump stocks.
so cheap for such a high quality company
"Nice entry here, i believe could still be better around $44-$45/sh"
I love that they bought Marlin. Perfect brand recognition. Such a good purchase.
RGR should get into selling bigger guns. i would like to get a tank for my backyard to keep the coyotes away ..
FBI Firearms Checks numbers are in and they are really high! 4.3 million in January. BUY!
This is going to fly tomorrow and continue positive momentum at least till elections
Most Democrats are smart enough to leave the Second Amendment alone. The Democrats have an indirect way to take the guns. They will amend laws to make gun makers and gun stores legally responsible for damages for guns they manufactured or sold. That would put gun makers and gun shop owners out of business.
"Im old fashioned, sometimes I like to be old fashioned even if it goes against the headwinds and even costs me some green. This was an amazing qtr from RGR, they had double digit % gains across every metric. They kept to their dividend and they announced a special dividend. They make best in class product with US engineering old school skills. They are giving back to share holders and dont have lot of debt. This is old school buisness and I love it. Solid gains on solid facts is a refreshing change from gains on 20 year forward projections. By all means congrats to anyone making quick bucks and lots of them on the mad runs of inflated valuations, I hope you enjoy it. Its just nice to make some money the old way every once in awhile, with a solid balance sheet . GLTA."
"Taurus is selling guns at manufacturers cost , just basically giving them away. This is a problem, but hopefully quality is important and buying USA is also. I love my country and stand proudly for our national anthem. Please buy Ruger or Smith & Wesson as they are American Legends."
This isnt political but this election is going to be contested its going to get scary and people will be wanting to buy guns
Great news! Record FBI NICS checks for Feb. at 3.44 million. Gun and ammo sales are not slowing down anytime soon.
This stock will fly when peaceful protesters encircle polling places and food stores.
"What's your expectation for RGR? Mine is that it can only go up in price. Multiple reports of January being the largest month for firearms sales ever. I assume when earnings are reported, we will all be happy."
RGR should do another special dividend payout as not only a fiscal stimulus for shareholders but also an affirmation that the Second Amendment is here to stay.
Shareholder friendly co in Aug paid out a special 5.42 dividend.
"2016 when it looked like Crooked Hitlary was going to win look at how this stock outperformed, same thing going to happen this year just sell right before election day because Trump is going to win AGAIN!"
They had a very nice conference call. They had a great Qtr. The only negative was that they didn't hire any new employees until July because of concerns of Covid 19. They wanted to keep their employees safe. They also probably wanted to make sure the strong demand was sustainable as well. They do run a tight ship at RGR. So they delayed ramping up production. I think their next Qtr should be better than this one. The next catalysts will be the NICS checks for July. And then SWBI will give guidance sometime in Aug when their stock splits into 2 companies. Gun sales are as hot as it gets.
"Just looked at research report form Argus, dated 5/19/21. They have it as a ""sell"" with a $69 price target, ........, LOL, imo.Ratings for ""Financial Strength"" and ""Growth"" are both rated as ""Low"".....Meanwhile, the RGR balance sheet data published with the report clearly shows that they have cash and zero debt.I guess in their mind a p/e of 8 is all a company is worth that basically prints money hand over fist and wheels it into their vault (60% of the money as they pay the shareholders 40%). Unreal, in my opinion, and here I thought energy companies were the most hated companies by the current media/society..."
Sturm Ruger reached a 52 Week high at 78.33
NICS increased a whopping 68% first 9 months. Blew away earnings and profit. RGR deserves a $125 PTPrinting profit
"Loving the dip. Dems will take seats in the mid terms, people will get nervous, the dems will take the house in 20. Get in now, collect the dividend, and wait for the bumps up."
RGR should see steady growth month over month - AT LEAST until end of the year. Covid 19Racial divide Elections Uncertainty High unemployment rateAll attribute to high demand in weapons. I personally know 6 individuals who applied first time for license and bought guns.
My trading platform detected a continuation wedge trading pattern. 78.00 to 82.00 in 17 days.

$80 by close of business august 4. Higher if earnings are released before close
They are forgetting to write a story about the biggest NICs in May ever. Last story written was over a week ago.
Black Friday 2017 Was Biggest Single Day Ever for U.S. Gun Sales
Biggest NICs August EVER.
trump just made it easier for Gun companies to export should help
"Coiled spring condition for RGR steadily decompressing under control. Next stop $70 in January, then consolidate before heading back to stay in range in the mid $80s by April."
"I think a flat top AR-15, 16 inch barrel, adjustable stock, 1 to 4 power scope, 5 round mag, 30-30 caliber would be the perfect whitetail rifle."
Recent price drop was do to August MICS check numbers.
"One thing about Ruger, they are one of the few companies actually making products that a lot of people want and can buy."
3.6 million FBI NICS checks in Nov. Over a million more than last year. Gun sales show no signs of slowing down.
The sale of firearms in the United States is skyrocketing in 2020. https://www.fox5ny.com/news/first-a-pandemic-then-civil-unrest-gun-sales-spike-again
"RGR selling out as fast as they can manufacture, will result in a higher stock price. Outside forces are holding this down at the moment. Let's make the shorts pay."

Sales are through the roof @ RGR. Profitability is also high. People have increased purchases because of the current administrations anti-gun rhetoric. The pace will not slow down any time soon.
"Stock is moving up well. I love how anti 2nd protestors are the best salespeople for firearms. Just like obama, he was the greatest salesman of all time."
Better than the previous misses but not really crushing it. Not sure how to take earnings. Any thought on the next week.
RGR got game
Sturm Ruger reached a 52 Week high at 74.63
"Cash provided by operations during 2020 was $143.8 million. At December 31, 2020, our cash and short-term investments totaled $141.2 million. Our current ratio is 2.9 to 1 and we have no debt."
Florida Mayoer bans gun sales? walmart taking ammo off the shelves... I see a bump. why is there no chat in Smith and Wesson
Bought today just under $52. Got to love it at these levels. I see it going back to $70 once the dust settles.
What’s up???
"i just bought shares in rgr.... it appears to be a reasonable valuation in this day of inflated stock prices, and they pay a nice dividend .... what is not to like? .... the dems are not gonna get gun legislation passed ...and with covid around the priority is on the virus .... no mass gatherings ...no mass killings .... so go with RGR .."
"The selloff continues on light volume. Oh well, let's get back to 40$ and we'll bounce back to $45. Last weeks news about the M-16 had to have stirred up some gun purchases and help with sales numbers. Sigh x 2!!!"
"Investment thesis for this stock: just go on google trends and type “how to buy a gun”. Given the riots, people are afraid and will be purchasing firearms"
"RGR just announced a new ""PC"" (pistol caliber LOL) rifle in 9mm that accepts Glock mags as well as Ruger mags and comes threaded for suppressors. Like their new 9mm pistol and last year's LCPII, these will sell like hotcakes."
HUGE beat by Ruger. Excellent Job.
Amazing how the markets work. Almost didn't buy this one and now its my best preforming one. Any guess where its going. I was thinking 60.00 after earning but topping out just little above that.
This is puzzling. Earnings report is out after the close. Not expecting a miss.
I am way over weight in this stock...Tonight we will find out if I am a hero or a zero...lol...Either way it will be a reason for a drink...Cheers!!!
