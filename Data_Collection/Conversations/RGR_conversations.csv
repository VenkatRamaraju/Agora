"San Jose just passed an ordinance that would tax gun owners. Under the law, guns can be confiscated if the tax is not paid. This was just carried on the cable news channels last night so may have something to do with the sell off. The fear could be that other major cities will follow suit."
"One inside sells 5,000 share sand the stock tanks. This company has no debt, solid balance sheet, real earnings, and sports a P/E of 10. The management team is strong. We have one liberal analyst at Argus that is always a bear, they must have a huge short position. Plus Firearms, are in high demand. Even the latest Background check numbers point to a great holiday sales forecast. I am adding to my positions at these levels."
WS haters always bang this down in the 1st hour.... but we all know what will happen later

Cali is the cesspool of the nation. How ppl live there is beyond me. Cali will hopefully turn red to clean up the leftists politicians. Fork Cali make it its own country under water.
Witnessed the latest fire sale of the insiders between $75 to $85? Yeesh. Hopefully it will subside soon.
