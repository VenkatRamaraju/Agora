"NICS check numbers are down month over month this month. They have been trending down since March.Thumbs down this post if you want, but it is true."
Ex-dividend date today. Just seeing a market adjustment in response to the special $5/share special dividend payable at the end of the month.
"Afghanistan cells coming soon, Anne get ur gun!"
Witnessed the latest fire sale of the insiders between $75 to $85? Yeesh. Hopefully it will subside soon.
Recent price drop was do to August MICS check numbers.
Looking forward to the earnings report. My bet is that they sold every firearm that they made and the only issue they have is that they can't make them fast enough.
"the world is unstable and people are crazy. so what are foks gonna do? buy more guns of course. even me, as mild mannered as clark kent, gotta worry about all the crazies out there .."
"Im old fashioned, sometimes I like to be old fashioned even if it goes against the headwinds and even costs me some green. This was an amazing qtr from RGR, they had double digit % gains across every metric. They kept to their dividend and they announced a special dividend. They make best in class product with US engineering old school skills. They are giving back to share holders and dont have lot of debt. This is old school buisness and I love it. Solid gains on solid facts is a refreshing change from gains on 20 year forward projections. By all means congrats to anyone making quick bucks and lots of them on the mad runs of inflated valuations, I hope you enjoy it. Its just nice to make some money the old way every once in awhile, with a solid balance sheet . GLTA."
"will rgr increase the dividend? they have great balance sheet, lots of cash coming in ... they should return more to shareholders ...and they can also give me a discount on ammo"
"Genuine question , is the upside for the next 5 months already priced into RGR current price ? Ive done alot of due diligence on this but gun manufacturers is a new investment area for me. RGR balance sheet looks great , seems ot be a well managed company and 2 million new permit holders has to translae into earnings. Im looking for a long term hold for some of my recent earnings from the broader market pop. Thanks in advance"
You want the truth on how Ruger is doing? Pick three of anything they sell. Go to your local gun store. Try to buy them. The dealer will tell you everything you need to know.
"if we consider the early reaction to the pandemic's threat to the economy and it's potential for spilling over into civil/social unrest and then frame that self-preservation instinct in terms of let's say new product or technology adoption curves, particularly in march and april as it relates to first time gun buyers, we can see that this surge represents let's call it ""phase one"" or ""early adopters"" which typically represents about 15% of a given population. phase two will be comprised of the next roughly 35% (called ""early majority adopters"") which is the period we are entering into only now and probably throughout the summer as the threat of unrest lingers and grows. later this year and into next we will start to see ""the other half"" i.e., people historically and philosophically resistant to the bearing of arms capitulate and start to put their own personal safety first and jump on board ""just in case"". in other words, the surge we saw in march/april will be dwarfed in the latter half of this year. also it is important to recognize that q1 was strong on the back on march sales alone. q2 will have the benefit of a full quarter of strong and growing sales. a new all-time high is just around the corner and triple digits is within spitting distance. as usual analysts will be late to the party but i fully expect to see upgrades in price targets to 80, 90 even 100+ once we've set in a new all time high crossing the $71 threshold. it's not a question of if, just when."
"Cash provided by operations during 2020 was $143.8 million. At December 31, 2020, our cash and short-term investments totaled $141.2 million. Our current ratio is 2.9 to 1 and we have no debt."
"One thing about Ruger, they are one of the few companies actually making products that a lot of people want and can buy."
"Below 72.50, good entry....near that in premarket..."
Interesting last 15 minutes of trading with more than 100k traded... next week
Yahoo rates $RGR as overvalued. $RGR has a P/E of eleven and a 4% Dividend. And they have no debt. Are they on drugs.
"The ""ANAList's"" estimates were too darn high. This isn't a Christmas Quarter. They blew out earnings and revenue compared to last year. 200% Increase and 35% increase. Sturm Ruger & Co (NYSE:RGR) reported quarterly earnings of $1.05 per share which missed the analyst consensus estimate of $1.23 by 14.63 percent. This is a 200 percent increase over earnings of $0.35 per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $130.30 million which missed the analyst consensus estimate of $167.06 million by 22.00 percent. This is a 35.27 percent increase over sales of $96.33 million the same period last year."
"One inside sells 5,000 share sand the stock tanks. This company has no debt, solid balance sheet, real earnings, and sports a P/E of 10. The management team is strong. We have one liberal analyst at Argus that is always a bear, they must have a huge short position. Plus Firearms, are in high demand. Even the latest Background check numbers point to a great holiday sales forecast. I am adding to my positions at these levels."
"Just looked at research report form Argus, dated 5/19/21. They have it as a ""sell"" with a $69 price target, ........, LOL, imo.Ratings for ""Financial Strength"" and ""Growth"" are both rated as ""Low"".....Meanwhile, the RGR balance sheet data published with the report clearly shows that they have cash and zero debt.I guess in their mind a p/e of 8 is all a company is worth that basically prints money hand over fist and wheels it into their vault (60% of the money as they pay the shareholders 40%). Unreal, in my opinion, and here I thought energy companies were the most hated companies by the current media/society..."
