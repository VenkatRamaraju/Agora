Highly bought
Buy out?
I'm in...let's see how it does next week
"Revenue, Earnings beat by Zacks. Shorts attack is the reason for selling pressure. I’m loading here. Possible $8-$10"
Another 3.5 million shorted in last 10 days bringing total SI to 7.5 millions.
"Here you go folks....the largest institution is 4th from bottom. Note, there are NO sells or reductions. Also note the reporting dates came in 1, 2 and 3 days ago......glta...these are big boys and girls in here...https://whalewisdom.com/stock/gsky"
"Oh boy oh boy! 3 New Strikes were Added to the 2022 Options Chain! $12.50 strike, $ 15.00 strike, and a $17.50 strike! This is going to $20 before EOY."
"All longs should pit in a sell order for over $15-$20 that way your shares cannot be borrowed to short and will make the squeeze very fierce. Although I expect the smart ones to cover now and some will get burned very badly, but we live by the choices we make. Strong into the close and gap up tomorrow will be nice. Done my posting, now will look at this one again maybe next Monday for a very nice gain. GLTA!"
1.2b market capital for 500million revenue company with year over year growth. Good cash flow and good progress during tough COVID time
Bullish chart
Who bought all those shares yesterday and way?
"Nice gain,how do all them pesky law firms take this positive news?"
what happened sudden free fall is there any news?
Nice to see follow through.Did they miss this IPO?
"buy,buy ,buy now"
Did I miss something in the transcript? It seemed to be very positive. This company and management team are right on the mark. Should move up by 40% within 60 days.
"Greensky is trying to add alternative funding sources to fund the loans. They are considering insurance companies, institutional assets mangers and pension plans. This tells me there are more issues to come with their bank partners. It seems as a deviation from their business model."
GreenSky is up 5.33% to 6.92
Test
I thought I missed the bus this morning. I am buying now!
GSKY has an excellent balance sheet and great financial ratio statistics. Impressive current ration and PEG
Love it so far...when do earnings come out? Although in this market good earnings could move stock down 
"The markets did the same thing to so many stocks that are new. One of my favorites was VEEV - 4 years ago, great growth, promising future and $19 a share, now $81. Look for GreenSky to do the same or better."
Chase analyst rating and recommendation dated 5/9/19 says overweight with a PT $15 to $17. Seen on Marketbeat.com
"these two made a recovery today will not be done ---- GreenSky Price Target Cut to $ 11.00 / Share From $ 22.00 by Compass Point ,,,,,,,,,,,,,, GreenSky Price Target Cut to $ 11.00 / Share From $ 31.00 by Goldman Sachs, you believe that with the results of yesterday is to make a $ 20 cut in a target price that is being smoked by this analysts."
Consumers and employees/workers are doing unbelievably well. Blue collar construction (electrician/plumber etc) busier than ever. Interest rates have fallen. GSKY is going to destroy the analyst estimates with good earnings in a week. You heard it here. BOOM.
Up to 12 and up coming before closing Friday.
"Major fintech acquisition by SQ as the industry continues to evolve in the US and around the world. Is GSKY in play? It is profitable and has a very low market cap. What is it worth to a V, MA, PYPL, FISV, FOUR? Is it platform and underlying technologies scalable worldwide? Thoughts. God Bless and stay well."
Today its shows 100% institutional ownership
Sofi and Payo up today because of this buyout. People saying they could be next? Any thoughts?
"I bought share of GSKY because I have a loan with them. This drop is disturbing, but if you look at the stats they are not losing money. Also, the loans they broker are not using their money. I just learned that they get a 7% fee from the vendor (new HVAC in my case) and I get 18 months to pay off the loan INTEREST FREE. If I don't get it paid off I will be hit with an interest rate of about 17% FOR THE ENTIRE LOAN, even if I pay off most of it. This is a trap for those with few financial resources, but a win-win situation for GSKY. I bought in at $15 and I am thinking about buying more at these prices. Not sure, but I don't regret this investment even if I have to hold on to it for awhile."

"Heavy buying, wondering is buy back has begun..."
Green Skies Ahead? :-)
"Man, is the drop this morning from the news at Zach's or something else?"
"After being screwed the first try on this, the second try has been good for last 3days. Still watching very carefully not to dive from the cliff again"
SEC should look at how/why a stock falls 12% the day before it is acquired with no news or reason for the 12% drop.
"So let’s see, $4 Billion left to lend before exhausting commitments with banks. Looks to me like with the growth they’ll need much more - huge growth ahead. Hence the strategic alternatives."
GSD IPO was $10 since end of April but today's price is $28+. Could not figure out the rationale.
So Buyout is $15?
"Agreed, over sold. More buy backs on the way...."
"It's should be clear to everyone that their time as a public company has been a failure. Here's a downgrade today from Raymond James.""While we hesitate to jump out the basement window as the damage has been done, we can't justify continuing to recommend a stock in the midst of a potential business model change coupled with little to no confidence in our forward financial model,"" He goes on to say,""Although we can get to a takeout value up to $10/share for the right strategic partner that can use its own balance sheet to fund the loans and therefore arbitrage the funding costs, it's tough to assign more than $5 of standalone value to the current business (10x our updated 2020 EPS estimate) given the significant level of uncertainty.""The only hope I can see for the stock is a buyout. They are already having to shift away from banks as a funding source to insurance companies, pension plans and asset mangers."
"The company decided to develop, not sell.So the speculative guys came out.https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e4722c58-990b-394d-9afa-ba98b65b3862/why-greensky-stock-tanked.html"
Imagine if the $150M share back starts soon; it will sky-rocket to $15's imo.
"Somehow I missed the news from last month that they are now financing some medical procedures. And while they have been missing earnings estimates, the earnings have been increasing. I think I need to buy more, but do the research and decide for yourself. :-)"
"It is indeed interesting to see the stock action of this symbol. Profitable and highly recommended by analysts, yet the performance is going in the wrong direction. Why? Love to hear some feedback."
good can buy 650 shares more is not much but it is what I can buy for now.
i'm ready for squeeze
Suddenly has an amazingly low pe and high eps?? Something must be wrong. Was this a secondary or spun off from something else???
Low volume today means Share Buy Back and/or Short squeeze has not started yet. It looks very bullish. Buy back and/or short squeeze will start hopefully next week...It will go much higher...PT is still $13 short term.
Any baggees left?
going to $10+ ---strong day today considering we hit $5.78
Has to do with 10Q filing and Regions Bank leaving as a customer. Listen to the CC with J.P. Morgan Global Technology from yesterday.
It has been quiet last 2days. Add more here?

why down 12%?
https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/08/09/336890-shares-in-greensky-llc-gsky-acquired-by-kornitzer-capital-management-inc-ks.html
that's it.. no more buying for me. last bought 8.59
"Citigroup Investment Research initiates coverage for GREENSKY INC with BUY recommendation.BY Investars Analyst Actions - public— 7:20 AM ET 08/09/2018On August 8, 2018 Citigroup Investment Research initiated coverage for GREENSKY INC (GSKY) with a BUY recommendation."
"Looking just the numbers it seems like a golden opportunity below 18$. The problem is that the closest comparables are LC and ONDK, and their stories are... not great. Big investors will wait and see how GSKY performs before investing a single dollar in it. That means we need a first strong earning call, with good guidance. Even then it may not go up that much, we may have to wait until they deliver on promisses. I would say don't bet everything you have on it but I think it worth investing a few grand."
"Technically, it doesn't show any resistance on the chart until around $20."
I'm thinking about buying more. I had a feeling it might drop down below $6. I already own too many shares (just because of the increased risk of having your eggs in one basket) but I own shares at a cost that ranges from $4 to $8 and as a former customer of GSKY I have my own reasons to think that others are going to catch on at some point. No telling how long that will take. Maybe when they announce a dividend. But I hope not that long. :-)
"""Notwithstanding the Company's solid operating results, in light of the complexity of the Company’s operating model, we do not believe that the Company's current market value is reflective of the Company’s strong record of cash flow generation and intrinsic value."
Only $2 Billion? Goldman pays more than that in fines every year.
"You know you are a contrarian investor/trader when the same people are posting every day on a Yahoo Finance board lol. bought 1,000 share starter last week! $30 stock in less than 3 years"
"A couple of points reacting to other messages. 1, We know earnings are going to be low for the next year as management told us that in the January 12 Investor's Day. They have changed most of the funding method and accounting rules cause them to report double normal expenses related to reserves/charge offs for the end of 2020 and all of 2021. 2, Zacks is not news, those are machine written articles, no human put any thought into that article. Related to this, most articles about GSKY are machine written (e.g., what hedge funds are doing with GSKY). 3, there are some algorithm games being played, as the daily price volatility is too high for the actual news on this stock. I hope that 10 million share day was a big buyer, but it feels like a big quant shop testing a model, then slowly going to net neutral over the next week.Now my opinions. 1, I think this company makes no sense as a standalone company. Greensky's costs of funding are too high. Also, it's small size and non-diversified customer base makes it very vulnerable to changes in the housing industry. GSKY should declare an auction and sell themselves as several regional banks (and a few retailers) do need the fintech that Greensky has. With steady low cost funding from a Bank of the Ozarks or Synovus, Greensky's net interest margins quadruple and the accounting issues/lack of diversification no longer exist. 2. To the extent legally allowed, management should not speak. No matter what they say, the price drops every time management speaks. I will give credit to the insider buying, caused me to feel much better about Greensky. 3, If you have not listened to the January Investor's Day presentation you should. The presentation really helped me understand the changes Greensky is making to the funding model and their targeted businesses. As I saw it, the home repair lending is working and everything else is not working. 4. I hope that management will ""kitchen sink"" the 4th quarter earnings, as related to reserves. Rather than let the accounting changes harm earnings for the next year, I hope they take massive reserves and get the low margin days behind them. At $6 I am slightly bullish, mainly as I hope that someone acquires them in the $9-10 range. But, I fully believe we will see GSKY below $5 again post 4th quarter earnings. Absent news, I am a total seller above $7.50. Disclosure, I do day trade this stock, based on what I perceive to be algorithm mistakes."
"From Goldman note this morning: GSKY (Buy): The stock has underperformed other consumer credit-sensitive names (down 22% over the last month vs. consumer credit-sensitive stocks down 7%), but we think fundamentals (including credit metrics) remain strong and see upside to Street estimates through 2019. With investor expectations relatively low, we think the combination of strong results and more robust disclosures should send shares higher."
"Purely based on chart reading, next resistance is at $22."
Does anyone know when EPS will be announced?
GreenSky is up 6.37% to 8.18
bought 1000 more
"Best guess is they miss on earnings, as they always miss on earnings. My hope is that the strategic review results in an acquisition. Management promised us a result by the time of this Monday's earnings. Since we have heard nothing, my expectation is we get nothing. Status is pessimistic but hopeful."
Just purchased today...saw this which encouraged me: https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/gsky/insider-trades
Way oversold
It’s complete bs. They are obvious going to beat q4 expectations. They throw some bad estimates but also start to buy back 150 mil worth of shares a whole lot cheaper now. Smells fishy.
"Anyone else besides me and Henry, or maybe just me, interested for the numbers today? This stock is universally ignored, it seems. Makes for a peaceful message board, though. Crickets."
what went wrong in the earnings?
"Greensky is one of those no-brainers that no one knows about. I remember when priceline, netflix and facebook were launching. They had lots of users who loved them but the investing public didn't know otherwise how could you have bought facebook for $21 days after its IPO or netflix for $14 when blockbuster was still the big name out there. Greensky is the way financial lending will be done in the future and right now they own it. Really own it."
"I just bought 1,000 shares yesterday because I first bought at $15 in the past, watched it go down, then sold at a profit by being patient. I'm back in again because the price had dropped, but also because I financed my new HVAC system with them at a cost of $11k and NO INTEREST for 180 days. They have been good to work with and I expect to pay off the loan before it's due, because if I don't I think the deferred interest for the entire time will be due and at 17% or whatever, it's a LOT of money. If I was not a customer I would be very, very wary of putting much into this stock. But as a customer I think they are doing things right. I hate the high interest ""sword"" over my head, but maybe that's the correct weapon to use in this kind of business. :-)"
Im in for 6300 shares. Looking for $15ps by 2022
"Thought it was a solid quarter and the biz seems set to weather the current storm. Stock is still cheap and assuming it survives, which also seems very likely unless COVID-19 remains a major issue for many more quarters, we'll see double digits within a year. Be interested in how the 'strategic initiative' is coming, because this company is going to get bought at some point. Timing matters, so it is not too cheap."

Good things are coming my way!!!
"$150M share buy back = 17M shares at the current price. So, the float will end up 40M shares. Quite a drastic drop which is good; Opposite effect of dilution expected. I see it goes back to at least $12 short term."
Crushed earnings. This is a very quiet and under the radar board. I enjoy it here.
24 percent haircut is way too excessive. it will close around 13 today
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greensky-report-second-quarter-fiscal-210000681.htmlGreenSky, Inc. (GSKY) will release its second quarter fiscal 2018 financial results on Tuesday, August 7, 2018, before the open of regular U.S. stock market trading hours. The earnings release and the presentation materials will be available on GreenSky’s website at www.greensky.com. GreenSky’s management will host a conference call for investors to review these results at 8:00 a.m. EDT on the same day. All interested parties are invited to listen to the live webcast at http://investors.greensky.com.

(GSKY) is a leading financial technology company Powering Commerce at the Point of SaleSM for a growing ecosystem of merchants, consumers and banks."
"In its IPO in May, GSKY sold 38mil shares at $23, total of $874mil. Now assume it buys back 15mil shares at $10. Net cash is $724mil for 23 million shares, or, average of a bit over $31/share. I like companies which know how to sell shares high and buy back low. Seeing a financial firm being smart with its money? Yes please."
When is the buyout of 13.00 happening?
"Greensky was profitable before IPO. The year to year growth will gradually increase along with the business model and healthy economic environment (low unemployment rate, ... etc.)"
It will fill the gap at $12.32 FAST and EASILY!!!
Today's volume was the 3rd highest since they've been a public company. The days that the volume was higher was day 1 and day 2. Institutional holdings are at almost 31%. I believe it was at 6% a few weeks ago.
time to buy.
"WARNING WARNING. Regions loss is just the tip of the iceberg.The following is from the last 10-Q""Receipts did not rise proportionally with deferred interest billed finance charges primarily because of an increase in Bank Partner portfolio credit losses and an increase in the agreed upon Bank Partner portfolio yield in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 associated with rising interest rates.""The drop in profit was due to a big increase in bad debts of GSKY's bank partners and those banks taking away some of GSKY's profit sharing to compensate. No surprise some are leaving. Banks are very fickle with this high risk lending. GSKY does not have the balance sheet to handle a large amount of defections."
"So far, the banks that have released earnings have all indicated the consumer segment is their best performing business and defaults are low. I expect Greensky earnings will be terrific. Buying Dec 2019 Calls at $10"
Watching the GreenSky Investor Day presentation on the web...
"I made my first buy today. The positive ER from HD, the insider buying and the massive institutional buying today was enough for me. I plan on holding long term and adding more. https://fintel.io/sob/us/gsky"
Sell before they drop the 10 Q. You can buy it back lower if you still want to own it.
if earnings are growing and there is a great guidance can go to $17 easily
"O'Connor is a multi-strategy hedge fund manager within UBS, dedicated to absolute return investment management. With a heritage dating back to 1977, O'Connor offers industry leading investment and quantitative capabilities, backed up by state of the art risk management systems."
"I think Greensky is a sleeper. Most don't understand their business despite what the financials say. I think that will change at least a little if the next reporting is a positive as I suspect it will be. One reason: GSKY makes is possible to finance expensive home repairs for 180 days at NO INTEREST. I know this because I used them in 2018 for an $11k HVAC system. Last quarter was Fall and Winter and many home owners that may have put off repairs had to get them done. HVAC, waterproofing, roofing, etc. I expect to see some kind of bump in their revenue and I hope, profit. If that happens people will start to take them more seriously despite not really understanding them. That lack of understanding will limit the bump up, but I think that slow understanding also makes them a good choice as a stock to hold long term."
"Few recent IPO (DOCU, IQ, HYUA ... etc.) the initial up and down happed in the first two weeks, then it keeps flying up and either 50+% or close to 100% gain. Don't lose the opportunity for GSKY."
"I am not going to pump this stock. I have been posting about it for quite a while and have clearly stated how I am invested in it and why. I am VERY happy the earnings were more positive than expected by the market. I was not sure they would be, but I thought if the company is managing their business, that they would be.All the other junk aside, they allow contractors and vendors to be paid quickly as the cost of some of their profit(And most contractors seem to be able to afford that as they ain't cheap to hire. :-) ), and the customer (mostly with very good credit ratings) has the chance to finance interest free if they can pay it off in 180 days like I did. And let me underline that while I did have a fee when I took out the loan, that was refunded to me. So it was an interest & fee-free loan.The contractors and vendors provide the marketing to customers that are ready to buy and that costs Greensky $0.Will it go to $20 this year? That's hard to say. ALL stocks have risk. But I hope they hit $10 so I can sell the shares that I bought at almost $9. As for the share I paid $3-$5 for? I may sell some, but some I may just hold onto for a very, very long time. :-)"
What is making this so steady 20 mil volume and not budging? New here
Anyone is waiting for the result? Looks like No expectation from anyone
Goldman sachs buying Greensky for 2.2 billion $
$LC and $GSKY in the same space ...undervalued
Will AXP just buy them out?.....
@Wall St. what you have posted 5days ago is actually happening now. I am very impressed. Thanks for the advise.
Awfully quiet hear and I like that. Occasional heavy volume spikes over that past 3 to 6 months pushing the price up. No news but somebody is quietly buying.
Wonderful to see the trading action finally on this stock. Taking out stops is great! Those that thought they would lock in gains are probably going to have to pay more. Intraday swings of .50 higher or lower from the previous day closing price is great. Definition of accumulation! Mid to upper teens by 4th of July. Pretty realistic with Spring coming and home projects ramping. Not to mention financing of Lipo and other non essential operations...everyone wants to look good going into the summer but can't afford to pay cash so GSKY is the tool to get it done! 
Nice to see this climb back above 6. Seems to be heavy resistance at that price evidenced in the 1Y chart. I plan to hold through earnings next week and see how this play's out. Heavy hitter taking a position is a positive sign.
GSKY set to announce two new bank partnerships
GSKY has lost more than 50% of its capitalization since IPO. Seems like smart money either does not feel comfortable to invest in it or did not discover it yet. I bought few shares hoping for a miracle lol cheers it has a great balance sheet and great technology.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greensky-better-fintech-100000165.htmlThis fintech IPO has my full attention.
"I think we are starting to see interest in FINTECH reach GSKY. As people do the research I think they will see what this company does and realize that as long as the economy is in recovery mode, that the need for financing assistance will be needed. Being able to finance a large purchase with NO interest of fees, such as my $11k HVAC that I needed in 2018, is very attractive. Yes, I hold quite a few shares and look forward to making a nice profit on my holdings at some point."
bought some at 8.9
Turning green and it will fly all the way up.
it seems in this market a Up Grade is a kiss of death. hope we close our the week over 8.
Hope everyone bought.
I understand the CEO bought large quantities of this stock.
GSKY is less competitive in lending....4 bucks a share on the high side of life.
buying at $11-12
finally a strong day... I've been buying whole it was going down believing in gsky's sweet business model.
+15% growth and a PE of 13 and the stock drops. Who wants to live in a world when growing profitable companies aren't valued? Maybe Epstein did kill himself?
This IPO reacts VERY STRANGE. It's been down for NO REASONS!
Good earning. Undervalued stock. Add as much as possible when it is below 10. It is going to boom as like RKT.
2 Upgrades & great earnings with strong growth. 2 months of steady stock price & we go up 50 cents & in minutes market makers take us down a dollar. What's up with that... ?
And here come the lawyers. Just looking out for my best interests?
wow. speechless.
Anyone notice that free cash flow last quarter was 91% of total revenue. Each quarter in the last year it has grown exponentially.
"I'm a bit confused, GSKY reports growth and a 0.23 eps, and the price drops like a rock? Zacks reports a miss at only 0.15 eps. Who's fibbing here?"
in huge @19.78
Hope your in ad txOr buy it between thursday evening and monday morningS e k t o r3 red correction days coming for overall marketAdtx a safe royal place to hide
The analyst ratings were before or prior too the announcement that American Express was going to partner with... Should have a higher estimate.
It will close at $10.20 or higher today. Teens this week.
time to buy
This is dead money until an announcement by the company - and with a recession on the horizon - odds are it will be bad news
11 cents per share = 6.3 million bucks income this quarter. Can't we level this profitability up?
Nice and steady with upside-earnings should move it.
Looks like the company is getting its buying opportunity. Interesting rout today... hmmm would be surprised to see investigations after a day like today.
Greensky recently posted a PDF with detailed 2019 guidance on their website. Q1 looks like it will have similar transaction volume as Q4 2018 and the transaction fee rate for Q1 is expected to be 6.8%. Q2 & Q3 look much better.http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9NzA0ODkyfENoaWxkSUQ9NDE3MTkwfFR5cGU9MQ==&t=1
I also don't think before this stock took off there were many retail investors left like myself. Most sold off when it went from 5 to 9 a couple of weeks ago.
"Massive dumping for sure but have no idea who's doing it. Once they dumped all, this will start going up"
"Great earnings not best guidance. I like the buy back. At yesterday's close I was in the money on all my shares. It'll get back there again, just take a bit longer than anticipated. This company is a cash cow. Good luck all, this is a hiccup, albeit a fairly big one."
This will get ugly
Interesting AH pricing for a change - no news yet but up 8%
"Jeez, Where is everybody....?"

What is going on today? The stock is falling.
Dropping more than my expectation..
should i buy any shares ?
Never buy PEAK
bought. I like the space and they are already making money. maybe that is why the ipo did not skyrocket. You have to be bleeding cash for a successful tech ipo.
"GSKY is down almost 5% in pre-market and I have a feeling shorts are going to jump on the less than stellar news about the last quarter. I don't like getting too heavy with any stock, but if it keeps going down I may not be able to resist picking up some more.I am a former customer and financed a HVAC system at my last home with them. It's hard to beat 180 days of interest free financing. I think the pandemic may actually help their business going forward. It would make sense that at first people would put off purchases, but people are only going to do that for so long and with the loss of jobs I think many more people are going to find what they offer very attractive. I didn't see why earnings were down, but revenue was up and I find that a very good sign."
Am I alone waiting for ER?

GreenSky Announces a $150M Buyback
anybody have any insight into why the stock is down on large volume ?
I got into GSKY for the fintech exposure. The growth still projects out at 20+% over the next 5 years. I wonder if a company seeking growth to add to their portfolio might consider making a play for them. AXP has already done some things with them. More ahead? Bigger?Spring sales season is coming. GSKY's tie-ins in this arena may help them regain their glory from last May. Time will tell... good luck LongsJeff
@Gene will you buy back?
"We had to buy a new HVAC system for our home and were offered no-interest financing via Greensky. It seemed good so we went for it and plan to pay off the loan before the 18-month no-interest period is over. I was shocked to learn when I got the paperwork that the interest rate is 17.99%. Shouldn't be a problem for me, but what a trap for some people. Also, I happen to check Greensky's BBB page and there are a lot of complaints. True that most of them appear to be user error and confusion, but still noteworthy. Thinking about picking up some shares, partly because my one call to customer server was great. English-speaking, professional, helpful, and cheerful. If they can do more to support their customers and avoid a credit crisis this could be a great investment."
Here is a good summary of what GreenSky does:https://www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/loans/personal-loans/greensky-credit-personal-loans
I suspect the Algos are the reason for this exaggerated move. Perhaps they can do the same on the upside?
Opening Day for GSKY....I think this could be an attractive company
"EPS $ 0.21 Beats $ 0.20 Estimate, Sales $ 113,912M Miss $ 121.72M Estimate, not so bad for such a big fall"
"GreenSky BTIG Research says pullback is overdone,saying its recent decline provides an attractive entry point.he company is experiencing strong demand from bank partners and borrowers with no evidence of credit deterioration."
"“Last year it acquired Clarity Money, a personal finance app with more than 1 million users. It is one of several suitors eyeing GreenSky Inc., an online lender that is exploring a sale, according to people familiar with the matter. “A buyout seems likely.

"The has been the quietest board I have ever been involved in. Quite often I would come here simply to get away from silly chatter of a few other forums I follow. A thank you to CHRIS for sensible commentary along the way. This went from my second largest hold to largest overnight. Would have preferred five more years of gains but will suffice with the 50%+ jump. And to my 32+ thumb down followers from the QS and Ride forums I simply say ""Take a Lesson"""
"When Alibaba (BABA) went into IPO, it's already profitable. The stock price has been UP trending. Greensky can up trending the same/similar."
"Was concerned when I saw GSKY had been fined, but the amount was pretty small. Sounds like their platform had some problems that left it open for contractor abuse. Story hit 8 days ago and no one else has bothered to comment...Looking forward to the Earnings report on 7/28. Would like to unload some of my shares, but need to get up to $8-$10 before I will be happy about doing that. But I think we will get there as the pandemic gets closer to the end. People will be more comfortable spending to get things done and GSKY's 180 day interest-free loans adds some comfort to start spending.Talk about actual ideas and opinions and don't just pump or trash stocks as that doesn't help anyone and is a waste of time IMO."
What's up here? Anyone have any info?
Upgrades Coming. It`s pleasant targets > 20 $
add 1500 shares to $ 8.94 to cushion the fall at the end of the day.
"Increasing transactional volume year on year, more partnerships with banks and no loan book, its a winner"
Lately most financial institutions have been talking acquisition on their conf calls. Lot of consolidation happening in fintech either the value has to be realized here and stock appreciate or someone will make an offer zalik should not refuse.
"do not be afraid the association with american express will bear much fruit in the next few months is a matter of time, GSKY anticipated the association with another two companies a couple of months ago, after this fall it is not surprising that in the next day they will announce it I think it's a card up the sleeve, Morgan Stanley predicted that the payment companies could increase their profits organically by an average of 15% until 2020 and they upgraded the Fintech to attractive, GSKY will recover very soon."
"Amex news was just a well timed desperate attempt to prop up the stock before quarterly release. they are dependent on just a couple banks to supply money for loans, one of them cuts the cord and you''ll wake up -90% next morning. too much risk to invest even if fundamentals are good."
"I see the PPS of this stock continuing to move up and the drop from the 20 ranges to 13 was a gift. The great thing about it, is the drop was related to the overall market, not some issue with the company. With the positive wage increase numbers and overall sentiment in the economy being positive, people are in a buying mood for large appliances and renovations etc. I see it a positive in multiple ways. Nobody is going to go to a bank and wait 2 weeks for approval for a $2000-$5000 loan. Those that have mediocre credit wouldn't get approved anyway, those that have great credit will pay off the loan before they get dinged with high interest anyway. Gsky offers convenience to merchants and consumers, its a win win. Wouldn't be surprised to see them blowout this quarters earnings. They already had explosive growth prior to the American Express relationship, it's only going to get better and better from here on out.Good luck, my prediction we are at $20 by 3rd week of November. Why not...we were at $20 in September prior to the selloff of the market.Cheers!"
Earning beat Wall.Street expectation. The nett income rather low
"Very long and good conference ( I like health care rapid expansion! ), business accelerating in fall ( Q3 and Q4 ), over all excellent guidance....."
November 6th will be the truth about borrowers and competitive interest rates.
"I was hoping for better numbers but since they just guided down it really wasn't realistic to think it they would be great. It's not hard to figure Q4 transaction volume since they gave the full year volume at 5.03 billion. Q1 was 1B, Q2 1.3B, Q3 1.4B, Q4 should be around 1.3B. They also said the transaction fee was 7.1% add 15% to that for loan servicing and Q4 rev. should be around $106 mil.I though they might pass 15000 merchants by the end of Q4 but that was a little short at 14907. However, they should currently be above 15000."
53% short float with 32 days to cover that's nuts theres a sqeeze coming on this one
Don't buy this at $11.xx if you think you are going to get $12.xx when GSKY merges with GS. The price will be based on a small percentage of the GAS stock and that COULD be lower when that happens 4th quarter 2021 or 1st quarter 2022.
Thanks to whoever sold at 19.07
What they need are some upgrades. Analysts have this old misunderstood perspective on this company. Today's call proved their view is wrong. They should upgrade immediately with a 15 dollar buy target
I am very pleased to see the price begin to reflect the growth opportunities our company has
Goldman Sacks is controlling the stock stock price. protecting GS investment. Plus they were the company that IPO it in 2018. Shorts are going to get burned.
"$CIOXY $0.53.. $3 BILLION Rev, Payment processing co, owned by Brazil's 2 biggest banks.. FACEBOOK made online payment deals/partnership with them. Pays 4% DIVIDEND.Dirt cheap.. Its a real big and legit company being traded like is fake, UNBELIEVABLE"
Very profitable company....All about the shorts for now....but this will change with the announcement...with a short squeeze. Zachs buy and CFRA strong buy.
Good earnings !

"On top of today's news, don't forget that AMEX will be issuing the a new Amazon credit card. Perhaps this will be part of that effort? https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/26/general-breaking-news.html"
"On August 14 Jim Cramer said that it does not make sense that GreenSky Incis trading so low that day was at $ 15.39, today GSKY is below that price, two days after Cramer said that GSKY announced an association with American Express and the stock rose by 17.1% in August, my question is because GSKY lost all its profit in the first half of September without any bad news for STOCK ,,, for the moment I will add more in this price I think that in these next days GSKY can have a recovery and reach the $ 18 easy. good luck for everyone."
"what falls, who knows?"
Banks are all in.....a very good thing!
"I don't know why people panick so much, although I agree with someone that this could have been algo trading that took it down so low. We will be handsomely rewarded from these prices very soon. The daytraders will exit and just watch where it ends up even on Friday. I played MDR and OMI when they were grossly undersold and the intitial rebound was superquick. Liquidated both to get in on this in a big way and will hold for at least 3-6 months where we could see a double.The momentum in growth here is phenomenal - the partnership and upcoming marketing campaign that American Express will be taking on puts Greensky in a whole different level for playing field which wasn't even there during their IPO. Another bank added in BMO and more to come.The $150M buyback is enough for a three to 4 dollar bounce if not more as the board and Management believes they are undervalued. What more could you ask for???I have an ask though, can all the weak hands please sell their shares and leave now please and thanks.GLTA!"
Not a bad er-do not understand reaction.
about time that 150 millions buyback kicks in

GSKY will be volatile this week as earnings will come out on May 11. This might be a good opportunity bank on the opportunity to invest in a high-growth company at very attractive prices.https://beatbillions.com/greensky-a-small-cap-stock-to-watch-out-for-in-the-coming-week/
Almost 1.4 million shares tried to drive the price down 10 min before close yesterday and the price goes up. Crazy

"Citigroup, Morgan Stanley , Credit Swiss ... all initiated BUY, OUTPERFORM... etc.. It will be UP ..."
The race is fixing to start. Will the Bulls or Bears win?
bought 600 shares @ $17.18/share lets see what happens nice outlay I will continue to watch
"I've been watching GSKY for a while and I may start a long position next week. It's strange to see it drop so much without any news. The earrings was good and fundamentally the company looks good. It looks like it's a broken stock not a broken company. I think it will rebound some on Monday, but it could drop lower later in the week. If it drops to the below 14 I will start buying."
Why is this taking such a hit?
Why are people willing to sell so Cheap? Because they have weak hands that cannot lift $1 bill....They will regret when GSKY is MUCH Greener in the teens.....$13 anyone?
"I just bought 1,000 shares! I also own $IPOF $CLOV $SPCE and $PSTH and Call Leaps on $GSKY"
My research says Greensky has been printing money during the pandemic. This will be a beat on the top and bottom line.
"ask if this fall is normal or excessive exaggerated, I have seen these large falls only in companies with serious financial problems that are announcing bankruptcy, biotegnologicas that do not approve a drug, some with investigations with accounting fraud, but this fall of 36 % It seems crazy to me, GSKY made reductions to the orientation for the whole year of 2018 said that a general shortage of labor that is affecting the contractors and a change in their loan combination were responsible for their weakened outlook and will continue So in the coming quarters, I think this is something normal is something stationary and transitory with Christmas around the corner many owners ask for loans to beautify their homes, something does not smell good, GSYK have a crystal ball to see the future or is that they want to buy 150 million shares at a cheap price? hahaha"
Cash flow from operations is 1/2 of total revenue. Are you kidding me. Awesome!
"Just a quick note (and I do this with all of my large investments)...just left a message with investor relations earlier an got a call back from Rebecca Gardy. Very quick, extremely professional and shared most of what was in the release. Will get back to me with lock up share details as didn’t have the info on hand about issue price but referred to the $23 IPO. I’ve seen many shares issued to insider below IPO which is a benefit of working to build a company-I myself worked at a company and received an option to buy at $10 for a $12 IPO which I made a small fortune on. I would guess that share were issued in the $14-$20 range but could be wrong.Either way, a good call and I am confident, once again would the weak hands please sell ASAP and move on...short play is over and the smart ones have covered or will by tomorrow to lock in the best profits or they will regret it not that I care...Good luck!"
"On the earning call, the management offered analysts one on one calls to provide the financial structure of the company. Seems like management wants to share with, and guide the analysts into a right direction."

can someone help explain why this is going down ?
Bought
"Public float is only 55 mil, after buy back, 39 mil. extreme over reaction."
i have never seen a 40 % haircut of a bad earnings call in my entire trading life (except for small biotech company)
Agreed. Number of merchants have increased 20% just this year. That alone makes it a bullish buy.
"I'm not sure if everyone has seen this article. I pulled a few quotes about the concerns with Regions. Around the same time the amount of stock being short went up significantly.At a conference after the quarterly filing was released, Benjamin said Regions believed it was not receiving an adequate return on its capital invested in the program.In light of Regions' decision, Ryan expects the other banks to review the returns on their programs as well. If Regions' assertion of inadequate returns is real, there could be a bigger pricing issue, he added.https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/trending/zD_EyUm2RVVf_vSkgN5V3Q2"

"18,000,000 shares traded by 3:00 pm. Something big is going on. No news. No press releases. Hmmm. ???"
Why this sudden dip?
Losing one client is meaningless. Business will be spread amomg existing institutions. They have plenty of cash to lend. Fall from $16 is total over reaction. Simply High freequency Algorithm trading. Computers react to te headlins in filing. rather than to the reality. Company will start buying shares at bargain price now. It is a great time to buy $GSKY now. GSKY will be $20 in few month time. Smart money will start buying it at this basement leveles.
shorts are trying to push lower and it not working.
"If there are 186m shares outstanding, as Fidelity reports, why is Yahoo showing 55m?"
Well whoever shorted this made a fortune.
