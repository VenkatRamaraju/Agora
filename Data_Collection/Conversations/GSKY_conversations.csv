GreenSky reached a 52 Week high at 12.15
What they need are some upgrades. Analysts have this old misunderstood perspective on this company. Today's call proved their view is wrong. They should upgrade immediately with a 15 dollar buy target
Sofi and Payo up today because of this buyout. People saying they could be next? Any thoughts?
Short squeeze today.
Only $2 Billion? Goldman pays more than that in fines every year.
"A couple of points reacting to other messages. 1, We know earnings are going to be low for the next year as management told us that in the January 12 Investor's Day. They have changed most of the funding method and accounting rules cause them to report double normal expenses related to reserves/charge offs for the end of 2020 and all of 2021. 2, Zacks is not news, those are machine written articles, no human put any thought into that article. Related to this, most articles about GSKY are machine written (e.g., what hedge funds are doing with GSKY). 3, there are some algorithm games being played, as the daily price volatility is too high for the actual news on this stock. I hope that 10 million share day was a big buyer, but it feels like a big quant shop testing a model, then slowly going to net neutral over the next week.Now my opinions. 1, I think this company makes no sense as a standalone company. Greensky's costs of funding are too high. Also, it's small size and non-diversified customer base makes it very vulnerable to changes in the housing industry. GSKY should declare an auction and sell themselves as several regional banks (and a few retailers) do need the fintech that Greensky has. With steady low cost funding from a Bank of the Ozarks or Synovus, Greensky's net interest margins quadruple and the accounting issues/lack of diversification no longer exist. 2. To the extent legally allowed, management should not speak. No matter what they say, the price drops every time management speaks. I will give credit to the insider buying, caused me to feel much better about Greensky. 3, If you have not listened to the January Investor's Day presentation you should. The presentation really helped me understand the changes Greensky is making to the funding model and their targeted businesses. As I saw it, the home repair lending is working and everything else is not working. 4. I hope that management will ""kitchen sink"" the 4th quarter earnings, as related to reserves. Rather than let the accounting changes harm earnings for the next year, I hope they take massive reserves and get the low margin days behind them. At $6 I am slightly bullish, mainly as I hope that someone acquires them in the $9-10 range. But, I fully believe we will see GSKY below $5 again post 4th quarter earnings. Absent news, I am a total seller above $7.50. Disclosure, I do day trade this stock, based on what I perceive to be algorithm mistakes."
Goldman sachs buying Greensky for 2.2 billion $
Up to 12 and up coming before closing Friday.
"The has been the quietest board I have ever been involved in. Quite often I would come here simply to get away from silly chatter of a few other forums I follow. A thank you to CHRIS for sensible commentary along the way. This went from my second largest hold to largest overnight. Would have preferred five more years of gains but will suffice with the 50%+ jump. And to my 32+ thumb down followers from the QS and Ride forums I simply say ""Take a Lesson"""
Never buy PEAK
"I am not going to pump this stock. I have been posting about it for quite a while and have clearly stated how I am invested in it and why. I am VERY happy the earnings were more positive than expected by the market. I was not sure they would be, but I thought if the company is managing their business, that they would be.All the other junk aside, they allow contractors and vendors to be paid quickly as the cost of some of their profit(And most contractors seem to be able to afford that as they ain't cheap to hire. :-) ), and the customer (mostly with very good credit ratings) has the chance to finance interest free if they can pay it off in 180 days like I did. And let me underline that while I did have a fee when I took out the loan, that was refunded to me. So it was an interest & fee-free loan.The contractors and vendors provide the marketing to customers that are ready to buy and that costs Greensky $0.Will it go to $20 this year? That's hard to say. ALL stocks have risk. But I hope they hit $10 so I can sell the shares that I bought at almost $9. As for the share I paid $3-$5 for? I may sell some, but some I may just hold onto for a very, very long time. :-)"
The race is fixing to start. Will the Bulls or Bears win?
I'm thinking about buying more. I had a feeling it might drop down below $6. I already own too many shares (just because of the increased risk of having your eggs in one basket) but I own shares at a cost that ranges from $4 to $8 and as a former customer of GSKY I have my own reasons to think that others are going to catch on at some point. No telling how long that will take. Maybe when they announce a dividend. But I hope not that long. :-)
shorts are trying to push lower and it not working.

Almost 1.4 million shares tried to drive the price down 10 min before close yesterday and the price goes up. Crazy
Lately most financial institutions have been talking acquisition on their conf calls. Lot of consolidation happening in fintech either the value has to be realized here and stock appreciate or someone will make an offer zalik should not refuse.
What is making this so steady 20 mil volume and not budging? New here
2 Upgrades & great earnings with strong growth. 2 months of steady stock price & we go up 50 cents & in minutes market makers take us down a dollar. What's up with that... ?
1.2b market capital for 500million revenue company with year over year growth. Good cash flow and good progress during tough COVID time
"Major fintech acquisition by SQ as the industry continues to evolve in the US and around the world. Is GSKY in play? It is profitable and has a very low market cap. What is it worth to a V, MA, PYPL, FISV, FOUR? Is it platform and underlying technologies scalable worldwide? Thoughts. God Bless and stay well."
"I've been watching GSKY for a while and I may start a long position next week. It's strange to see it drop so much without any news. The earrings was good and fundamentally the company looks good. It looks like it's a broken stock not a broken company. I think it will rebound some on Monday, but it could drop lower later in the week. If it drops to the below 14 I will start buying."
And here come the lawyers. Just looking out for my best interests?

Goldman Sacks is controlling the stock stock price. protecting GS investment. Plus they were the company that IPO it in 2018. Shorts are going to get burned.
"Somehow I missed the news from last month that they are now financing some medical procedures. And while they have been missing earnings estimates, the earnings have been increasing. I think I need to buy more, but do the research and decide for yourself. :-)"

SEC should look at how/why a stock falls 12% the day before it is acquired with no news or reason for the 12% drop.
Who bought all those shares yesterday and way?
I also don't think before this stock took off there were many retail investors left like myself. Most sold off when it went from 5 to 9 a couple of weeks ago.
2.2 billion dollar Goldman Sachs offer
Awfully quiet hear and I like that. Occasional heavy volume spikes over that past 3 to 6 months pushing the price up. No news but somebody is quietly buying.
Don't buy this at $11.xx if you think you are going to get $12.xx when GSKY merges with GS. The price will be based on a small percentage of the GAS stock and that COULD be lower when that happens 4th quarter 2021 or 1st quarter 2022.
