Hope the Conference tomorrow helps BOOST Expedia's price.. I got in @ $98 after the fall and am hoping it can get it back ABOVE $100! Its been declining/stagnant for wayyy too long-- we're OVERDUE for a 5-10% jump! HODL!!!
whats up with bid/ask...jumped up after hours but I cant find any news...
"$150 when the vaccines start getting distributed, $200 by spring when travel kicks back in and $250 next summer when the bookings drop to the bottom line. The cost cutting will pay off in hefty bottom line profits for years to come !!!"
"Anyone read that article from earlier??""After Expedia Group Chairman and Senior Executive Barry Diller fired the travel giant’s CEO and chief financial officer in early December, investors pushed the share price up by 6 percent. Continued share price gains since then reflect the hope that new management will boost the competitiveness of the online travel agency.Yet not everyone has been as enthusiastic. Some investment analysts and company insiders speculate that Diller’s looking for a buyer for Expedia."""
I wonder if a buyout will be announced Sunday?
I stayed at a VRBO this past week!
"A certain someone here ↓ obviously played with money he couldn't afford to lose. Sorry buddy, but you are now way underwater on your trade. Don't get mad at me, get mad at your trading skills (lack thereof). Make it back on GOOG, that is who is taking over. How many more names are you going to create so you can post?"
Anyone know when is earning? Wasnt it supposed to be yesterday? Nasdaq has it on May 7?
"Expedia (EXPE) is jumping because of this Airbnb hype,"
Chart is look good. More upside here in my opinion. Not many big names available at these multiples. Looking to buy more...
"Same thing this did the last terrible er. Ran up 20 percent to 120 where I bought puts. I'm looking to repeat that because this has been a horribly run company and is still way overvalued. I'll wait for the wall street pump and hope for 85 tomorrow so I can load some puts. Dead company that was barely profitable pre Covid, I'm expecting them to need to raise a lot more cash to even stay afloat, and much better travel companies. This is honestly a 40 to 50 dollar stock and that's being generous."
Miss
Time to roast the shorts.
"Looks like the preliminary results release today were buried in the excitement.""In the second half of March, new gross bookings, excluding cancellations, declined 85% to 90%, and cancellations exceeded new bookings.""Who is buying this stock?"
"To all those who are comparing $EXPE to $ABNB.Just to make it crystal clear for you guys, EXPE is the Taxi’s industry, and ABNB is Uber!"
bullish just starting
"Found this while searching around on the web about Acquisitions""If you’re a public company seller …You generally want to get the acquisition agreement signed as quickly as possible. Why?Once you’ve agreed on price, how the stock trades from then until execution / announcement can impact the deal and, potentially, force a renegotiation (adding uncertainty to the deal).The risk of leaks increases with time. Leaks can move the stock price, potentially lead to renegotiation and add uncertainty. Leaks also are disruptive to customers / employees and can lead to securities law headaches.Many times you would prefer for the deal to be announced before or at your quarterly earnings since your stock price could be disrupted by the earnings announcement which can complicate M&A negotiations."""
Shorts will be all over this tomorrow.
Question: How is this stock trading at $118 when it was $100 in November 2019? Please help me understand.
Currently short this stock. The management crisis coupled with the Coronavirus makes this stock easy pickings. I probably am not short for the long haul but there is money to be made on the short side in the immediate term.
"I will explain again I hope you listen, hedge funds need to manipulate the prices up so people jump into fomo mode and buy into them selling! I’m sorry but that’s how it works they can not sell their whole position because they would lose to much money at once! I’m sorry to deliver this bad news that’s how this world works buy up the prices and sell into the chasers don’t believe me watch 2-3% come down again and long term it will drop once all positions of institutions are sold"
"Diller will decide the future of this company....if someone makes a good offer which I'm expecting to happen pretty soon he will take it...""Diller is chairman of that board, and even though he owns less than 10% of Expedia’s shares outstanding, he controls 48% of the company’s voting power through supervoting stock. He could raise his voting power to 49.3%, if he chose to purchase publicly traded common shares to exchange for supervoting stock, according to a form Diller filed Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission."""
"Lets take a look back at 3rd Q earnings...net revenue was down 22% but some key metrics were up...Imagine a potential suitor looking at these numbers....there are areas that could save them tons of money just by consolidating into any company that buys them by not have duplicate corporate offices and everything that comes with that (Executive personnel etc)BELLEVUE, WA – November 6, 2019 – Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) announced financial results todayfor the third quarter ended September 30, 2019.Key Highlights(1)• Gross bookings increased $2.3 billion or 9% to $26.9 billion. Revenue increased 9% to $3.6 billion.• Total stayed lodging room nights increased 11%.• Expedia Group's net income declined 22% and Adjusted EBITDA was flat in the third quarter.• Expedia Group exceeded 1.4 million properties available on its core lodging platform as of September 30,2019, including over 650,000 integrated Vrbo listings.• Year-to-date, Expedia Group repurchased 3.2 million shares for $418 million. Including the Liberty ExpediaHoldings, Inc. transaction, Expedia Group has retired a total of 6.3 million shares.• Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow grew 14% and 5%, respectively.Excluding capital expenditures related to our Seattle headquarters, year-to-date free cash flow grew 15%."
"""Combined, the units grew 70 percent. Egencia’s $405 million worth of new business, topping results from the previous (third) quarter, brought its total signings to $1.4 billion for the year.Instead of cheering Expedia for the investment paying off, the market is scrutinizing the higher expenses incurred in Q4.The cost rise will not end there. The company hired the 95% of staff it needed to grow in the local markets. Expedia did not say which markets they are but promised that new products and features will increase its growth rates."""
"I'm trying to figure out why EXPE is up almost 10%. Other than a short squeeze, there's really no reason. Some positive news from a Phase I trial apparently means everyone will be travelling soon and Expedia will benefit? I can't see it."
"9 times above average volume support the buy volume increase tells me that investors are piling in for a rare buying opportunities when travel booking numbers are very soljd with strong full employment. Earnings was great, increase admin costs to boost the best holidays season is positive. I have booked my trip to Asia through Expedia, their site is easy to use according to my wife and daughter. Woman and millineum have the best sense."
Lots of insider buying . You know what that means. What a Christmas present to town. It will a strong traveling season with record employment. I just booked my trip through Expedia. I put money to where the mouth is
Booked with Expedia and was denied check in at hotel because all rooms were booked. Expedia will NOT refund money unless I get brain dead hotel staff to fill out a form. When I call the hotel they don't even seem to understand english. Hard to believe that they have no system in place to automatically refund money if you are denied check in. I was inconvenienced and yet I have to fight for a refund? LOW LIFES.
Front page of Barron's today. They say it is way undervalued.
When is earnings??
MY 1000 SHORT SHARES FROM 136 IS HOLDING UP GREAT. MY 90 COVER PRICE WILL BE ACHIEVED WITHIN A FEW DAYS AS YOU LONGS GET YOUR MARGIN CALLS.
What’s the plan for today folks? Sell before earnings or wait?
"Earnings do not matter for any company right now. There is no good news about current quarter earnings and there is no good guidance either. The market says things cannot get worse; so the only way is up regardless of earnings. You can question the assumption that things won't get any worse, but if you agree with it, then the only way is indeed up."
Today will break the 100 to reach 102-104
$175 end of march
"EXPE is a screaming buy. Looking at the #120-$130 range by March. Earnings estimates have been reduced, low bar to beat, and a price we have not seen in years, not to mention market seasonality will provide support. This is a can't miss in the midterm."
my only regret is that i only bought 400 shares
"Over reactionExpedia reported fourth-quarter revenue of $2.32 billion, up 10.9% year over year, but about $40 million below the average analyst estimate. Gross bookings increased 14% year over year to $19.8 billion, while room nights increased 15%. Expedia's core brands' revenue grew by 10% year over year to $1.86 billion, while trivago, HomeAway, and Egencia enjoyed 18%, 16%, and 18% growth, respectively."
JUST COVERED MY 1000 SHARES FROM 136 @ 94.25. OUT WITH ALMOST 42 THOUSAND SCORE. WAS FUN BYE BYE
Stock should begin climbing headed into earnings first part of Feb......I still believe a buyout is coming soon but if the stock rises on it's own I will be happy either way.
"All travel websites stocks are crashing $EXPE, $TRIP, $BKNG in preparation for AirBnB IPO next year. AirBnB is verifying all room listings now and becoming a serious player in this space, and a lot of money will flow to its IPO."
"Now we have seen that Insiders started buying the stock. This is the sign of some BIG news coming soon. Load up guys , its the best time not to miss this train."
"So the largest US public company, Apple, just warned the street today that they will not meet their revenue guidance in the future because of the effect the coronavirus will have on the supply chain and demand for sales in China. In related news, EXPE's stock went up over 12% on Friday after refusing to provide guidance for upcoming quarters, due to the coronavirus. AAPL's announcement today will have implications for the broader market, and the markets will probably be weak for sometime. If Apple is worried about the coronavirus, how does this news effect the travel industry for companies like Expedia? My take is traders will realize the travel industry will be effected more than most, and this may be the catalyst for the stock to close the previous gap up Friday, maybe down to about $111."
I want to buy some Expedia before it goes back . Love this company ! Just booked a trip to Miami Trump international . Great deals . Corona virus is a big fat overblown scare tactic that will backfire on fake news !
"EXPE is basically in a duo monopoly with Booking, both companies are massive disruptors to travel agencies. and EXPE will come out on top and reach new highs."
This has gone parabolic and I understand its for a reason. Do you you guys expect a pullback? Waiting to get in.
I firmly believe this company will be purchased....solid company that has billions in revenue and very profitable......would be a nice addition to Alphabet or Booking....
BACK TO THE FUTURE YEAR 2015 THIS IS WHY THE STOCK MARKET IS LIKE A CASINO. THIS WILL HAPPEN TO THE WHOLE MARKET AT SOME POINT IN THE NEXT 2 YEARS
"Wells Fargo saying Expedia could spin out VRBO in an IPO, that is HUGE"
"Cash flow issues? Deposits for confirmed Home Away / VRBO reservations are processed immediately. Refunds for confirmed, legitimate cancelations can take over four weeks to be credited. (Personal experience).Aside from cash flow concearns terrible customer relations will affect future bookings."
Im not sure what to make of how this stock is trading? Down $1 with earnings just 3 days away.... either the street has no faith in earnings or someone is manipulating stock lower to scoop up cheap shares before buyout... or maybe im imagining this whole thing?? Haha
"EXPE has some catching up to do with PCLN, which has run up over 160.00 since last earnings drop. Both are seeing a big fundamental change in world travel by business and leisure travel picking up dramatically. EXPE should run quickly to 140's"
"If Airbnb can get a valuation of $35 billion this coming Wednesday, EXPE should at least go up 50% from here because Vrbo/Homeaway is no slouch either. Plus, EXPE has air travel, hotel rental, car rental, and cruise businesses, hotel"
"If you put all the business fundamentals aside - this is a company that no longer starts with the customer in mind. Customer service is a joke, no refunds being issued back to customers."
Looks like some Good News in progress . This is going up quietly.
"I invested snap prior to earning . They gave me four thumb down . Now I am going long for expe. I think this price $127 , it’s relatively inexpensive. It was $150 back in November. Then earning out , shares dropped . I doubt will happen again . This quarter is good season to have lot t of booking for travel. Thumb up if you think it will jump higher after 4 pm ."
"As for my most recent experience with expe there was no one availble to talk to after I had made a reservation. I called and got a "" I'll get back to you shortly"" which btw never happened after I call a few times, I called their 877# and a virtual assistant answers do you want to cancel your reservation or keep i. I will never use this outdated throwback service again. I give it A (**) from 1-10 thats 10 for great service. why is this stock $145 a share? it should be pink sheets traded otc.expeQ.pk"

"Will be $150 to $155 going into earnings, so an easy 5% to 8% to be made as a short term trade! Why, it always rises in the 2 weeks leading up to earnings. Easy money !"
"I'm not sure why people here are saying this is overvalued. Expedia owns VRBO, which is similiar to Airbnb, and if ABNB is valued at nearly $130B, how's a $20-25B valuation for EXPE unreasonable? Feel free to explain."
"According to MarketWatch, Expedia is popping because of forecasts. On a conference call, Expedia Chief Financial Officer Alan Pickerill said that the company expects adjusted Ebitda to grow 10% to 15% in 2019. Which is in line with analyst expectations of 12.1%....Something is not adding up here"
"This just factors in travel in asia pretty much. Wait for Q2, that's when all the flights were getting cancelled globally. Go against logic, only way to trade right now"

That was NOT a got earnings report. Why is it being celebrated like it’s a win?...
Took a gamble and bought the $95 and $100 calls yesterday. Looking great and expecting a huge beat and improvement in bookings. Been in the correct side in 4 out of 5 earnings for huge gains. Buy and be rewarded!
Clearly best in breed. Booking’s sub-par earnings may provide a good opportunity tomorrow.
"Google is the game-changer here. Their search engine is the first to pop when searching for travel stuff. More than 80% of people use Google as their default search engine. Expedia is generally not the cheapest, Priceline is. With Google taking over, all of these travel sites are in jeopardy. ""Expedia Chief Executive Officer Mark Okerstrom said the same day. “Google does continue to push for more revenue per visitor. And I think it’s just the reality of where the world is.”Unfortauataly, the pendalion shift has started."
It's the best time for Google to Buy Expedia . As the infrastructure and Client is HUMONGOUS. If they miss this time they will miss a big opportunity.
"”Stiff Terms?But the terms could be unattractive for the financing beneficiaries, namely Airbnb and Expedia Group. This is expensive money that they are securing.As is the case for Airbnb, which reportedly has to pay Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners around a 12 percent interest rate on the financing, Silver Lake and Apollo Global Management undoubtably will be looking for a big return on a stake in Expedia.The two private equity firms are likely looking for a 15-20 percent total return, including interest on the investment and warrants. It is likely that the investment could come in stages, with $1 billion being the investment in an initial stage, with another billion dollars or so to follow later.Barry Diller, Expedia Group’s chairman and senior executive, controls about 28 percent of the votes of the company. A $1 billion stake in Expedia Group would be a minority investment and would amount to a much smaller percentage of voting power than Diller currently wields.”"

Congrats to longs!!! Great numbers!
"Expedia priced their private offering of senior notes last night. From a press release: ""Apollo and Silver Lake would retain their Expedia warrants, which entitled them to each purchase 4.2 million shares of common stock at $72 per share."" So I'm wondering why others would buy this stock in the $85's where it is now, when it's being offered at $72 to other investors...or possibly I'm not understanding this deal."
If this doesn’t go down after ER today. I will be eating ramen for the rest of my life.
I feel the RSI is at the bottom when it's at 45ish which was at 30 RSI when it was at the 105 level and 60 when it was at 114... I have a feeling that the RSI will reach above 60 within the coming weeks and feel bullish for Expedia just wish I bought the calls on Monday today instead of on Friday... was trying to resell it on Friday but didn't bring my phone with me

Why is this not dropping faster then the avg stock?
How can this company be worth less than 20B and Airbnb over 100B?? I really don't get it and Expedia has twice the revenue.

Diller busy reducing his work force to get the company ready for sale.
"“ On Thursday Diller was laser-focused on IAC's travel site, Expedia which has seen its stock drop nearly 18 percent in the last three months. Diller, who serves as Expedia Group chairman, and vice-chairman Peter Kern held a ""fireside"" conversation conducted by the president of Expedia Business Services, Ariane Gorin. During the talk, according to travel business site Skift, Diller announced to Expedia employees that he and Kern will be evaluating the company's needs before a new CEO and chief financial officer is appointed.”"
"When a company is entertaining a sale it often will appointment ""Interim CEO""...the company I work for just did this very thing...I told my co-workers a sale was coming...guess what...2 months later we were sold ( but kept our jobs thank goodness).Seems to me something similar is happening at EXPE""One factor driving uncertainty is that Diller said the company wasn’t searching immediately for a CEO during a December 19 meeting with Expedia employees, as Skift reported from Seattle at the time. He had already appointed Expedia Vice Chairman Peter Kern as effectively the interim CEO to replace ousted Mark Okerstrom."""
Seriously my NET position is down on decent earnings and this is up huge on what exactly? I bought puts today. Will see
nowIs there is any impact of latest Trump news? As this is a Different Line of Business.
i purchased in at$50 a share in the winter
So lets say BKNG bought EXPE using stock...BKNG has 41 million outstanding.....they pay 21 billion for EXPE (about $150 per share...and yes I'm being optimistic) using their current stock price of $1926.00 per share...that would come to 10.6 million shares to purchase EXPE so BKNG outstanding stock count would be 52 million...but they would be adding over 11 BILLION in revenue to their company!
"Below is a comment on sitejabber, very typical comment from a property owner using VRBO:""We have listed our beautiful lakefront cottage on VRBO/ Homeaway for at least 10 years. Initially, it was expensive to list, but we connected with wonderful families, many of who keep coming back summer after summer. In recent years, however, VRBO has taken more and more control over our property to the point that I feel I'm just a pawn in their money-grubbing game. First, if you didn't let them do your booking, they moved you way down the list. Next, they started charging our renters a fee to use the service and they used a third party ""bank"" which charged us a percent. Then, they told us the third party bank (Yapstone) was going to start charging an extra 3% to continue to send us our money in a timely manner. So...they told us to switch over to their new ""banking"" system to save the extra percentage. If we didn't, we'd move down the list! We switched and as soon as we did, they told us after reviewing our listing, we did not qualify for early pay-outs, and they'd be holding OUR money until the day after our guests check-in! WHAT? This is not only Bait and Switch, but a form of blackmail. We just received a booking for a week in August 2021 and VRBO is holding $1500 of ours until then! Is this legal? Please, PLEASE will another listing company step up to the plate so we can all switch over to you??? I'm so over VRBO/Homeaway/Expedia's manipulation. Enough is enough! """
"I will post again...""Yet not everyone has been as enthusiastic. Some investment analysts and company insiders speculate that Diller’s looking for a buyer for Expedia.""Now what have I been saying??"

The street views google’s presence in the industry as an existential threat to the likes of all the online travel companies. Google may face similar anti-trust scrutiny to apple’s App Store issue last year.
"Anyone remember when IBM bought RedHat out of the blue? They offered $75 over the closing price from day before which was at $115.......I was in that one because I had a gut feeling someone might make a run at them because they were under valued at the time......EXPE is under valued here.""ARMONK, N.Y. and RALEIGH, N.C., Oct. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), the world's leading provider of open source cloud software, announced today that the companies have reached a definitive agreement under which IBM will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Red Hat for $190.00 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $34 billion.""I'm expecting EXPE to be bought out soon....I have no information or rumor but merely a gut feeling that has served me pretty well in the past. The longer we go with no replacement CEO or CFO the more likely this scenario becomes in my opinion. Diller is in his 70's and controls 48% of the voting power so basically he alone decides where this company goes......you dont think he would jump on an offer for $145 from BKNG or Google?? I think he would."
This stock should be at $115 or above....
Expedia started returning actuaol money for cancelled trips! Not credits.... Do u think its Federal Releive Dollars?
100% paper gains achieved today. One of the easiest trades I ever made. It will remain paper for quite some time as I have no intentions of selling for years on out.
"Been on hold with Expedia for 64 minutes (and counting) to answer a simple question about a $40 charge that showed up 20 days after booking. I'm never using them again. Not a short, just a ticked off customer with nobody else to complain to since they won't pick up."
EXPE up 14% and no news. And no one even cares? Awesome stock. wow
"Revenue for Q1 was 2.6B, Q2 was $3.2B and Q3 was $3.6B. 52 week high over $140. Once Q4 revenue is announced we rocket to $150/share. They fired the CEO because share price was dropping and the board knows the market value is significantly discounted given financial performance. They have $5B in cash, a commitment to growth, and forward P/E is 15, not the 30 you see on Yahoo. In summary, BUY, BUY, and BUY more!!"
Oh look they only earned 3.48 per share this quarter. You should probably buy Uber and lose 4 dollars per share.
Good sign today keep going up my dear
"If this is not making sense of why is up, let me explain smart money needs to trick everyone into thinking the worst is over once everyone is Chasing prices going up they will sell 2-3% into retail amateurs trading that have never trade it before. Give it time and you will see the 10-20% drop come soon maybe by Friday depending of how many people they see buying the stock going up and up and then Boom drops 3-5% and then again it happens again because they know retail traders keep hoping for it to come up and boom down another 3-8% don’t believe me watch"
"Just visiting the board and following stocks like EXPE, I got my securities licence the day of black Monday 1987. I have seen these markets several times since then. This is very similar to the internet bubble, stocks trading at 100 + PE's, these always end badly. 5.1 trillion investment dollars held in 5 stocks, when it starts to head for the door it will be epic, stay thirsty my friends!"
"If Q1's number looking as grim as it did, can you begin to imagine what Q2 would look like? Saw the CNBC interview, cancellation stabilizing because no one is actually booking. If people are actually booking trips you think Airbnb would have to go out of their way to layoff 1900+ people? Airlines would have a heartbeat and not relying on bailout money."
"Anyone looking to buy, wait until Monday or Tuesday. More selling tomorrow and unfortunately it's Friday."
"Definitely set to tank further on Tuesday... this stock reacts slowly, but that earnings report, in a sea of so many other better choices, holds a certain inexorable gravity."
"this stock will end the week below $60,,,,bold prediction ..? yes ! you'll be lucky if it below $60...and"
"Great company, but this stock is overvalued at this point. Go ahead and thumbs it down, but it's true."
More analysts upgrades
"The revenue was 2B, where did they spend most of the money?? I thought it is an agency."
"Five years ago on this day, EXPE closed at 94.23. Well good news is that if you buy it now and hold it for a year (or may be less), this will go up nicely. Travel is dead right now but this is an internet company. It is not like an airlines that has planes parked on the ground and billions everymonth in the fix expenses. BKNG and EXPE will survive and come back strongly. Too much volatility these days in both directions. Yes was 64 just a few days ago. Market is likely to dance around these levels for a while."
EXPE is certainly underperforming compared to other travel stocks. I don't get it?!
"United just announced they are tripling their flights, which means their data must be telling them travel is back to have that much confidence. It's officially GAME ON and travel stocks should be up 20% to 50% by year end."
"One last thing to consider and I will go away for a while....Earnings are scheduled for 2/13 and that is important because anyone looking to buy EXPE would want to see the latest numbers so it would be ""Convenient"" to get that info during this period."
"Yes, the market is crazy. But looking at the EV 6x the revenue, the valuation is still cheaper compared to $ABNB. Assuming the revenue would eventually recover to the $10B level, it'd bring their EV/Sales to 3x, which is reasonable. Although they are racking up debt, the balance sheet still looks relatively healthy with $3.5B in cash. FCF is improving QoQ. So the share price is not as crazy as it seems, though I would not add any new position unless there is a further sign of travel recovery."
"They are going to lose customers as a result of how the subsidiary companies are handling cancellations and I am one of them as a result of my experience with VRBO. I will never use VRBO/HomeAway again because they are not offering refunds or credits, nor is the homeowner willing to offer a future credit. I have been a long-time VRBO user, but going forward I will use Airbnb since they are taking care of their customers during this crisis."
"5 stocks were added to the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) List today: Expedia is one of them. Expedia Group, Inc. EXPE operates as an online travel company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has been revised 1.2% downward over the last 30 days."
Well atleast their Vrbo component is making good money!!
The drop from $138 to $100 was completely overblown on the recent earnings miss. Google changed search logic and now it is fixed. Buy the dip or miss out. So simple!!
To me BKNG makes the most sense to buy EXPE....with their stock so high they could do the deal in stock without adding a ton of shares to their outstanding. also it would more than double their revenue right out of the gate!!
I thought shorts couldnt participate today because of the % amount that dropped Friday? Sure does feel like short sellers are pressing this down AGAIN today.
Did I not warn the shorts? Will be 120 by next earnings 
Without revenue expe is practically extinct....they do have roughly abt $1.5b cash on hand which i would expect to run it's course in a matter of months after which point it is a $25 per share at best with an anticipation of slow rebound in 2021...if you smart you should be exiting your position or holding puts....
CEO of Expedia: Searches don’t equal sales! Talk sales not searches! You don’t get paid for ad clicks like google
"Until they hire a new CEO and CFO I think a buyout is imminent. Diller has almost 50% of the voting power so he only needs a few more shareholders to vote with him on ANY deal that comes their way.""Diller is chairman of that board, and even though he owns less than 10% of Expedia’s shares outstanding, he controls 48% of the company’s voting power through supervoting stock. He could raise his voting power to 49.3%, if he chose to purchase publicly traded common shares to exchange for supervoting stock, according to a form Diller filed Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission."""

People doing their own research, thinking things over, and making sound decisions! I think it's a fantastic idea. It will never happen though, because there's this mega-industry that employs these blow hards that pull any old thing out of their rear ends called ""analysts"" that do the ""thinking"" (translation... steering) for the sheeple."
Why Expe is so lucky to repurchase its stock at the moment. I can buy back a lot more shares and boost earning . This is more than offset the decrease of booking temporary .
"Agreed... EXPE is trading very strange... we should expect some buy out breaking news prior to earning report next week. Patient patient patient & patient. In my opinion, the bulls are going to be rewarded pretty well."
"Listening to the earnings call, management is contributing the performance shortfall to the performance with Homeaway and hurricane in the US. These factors seem to be more specific to Expedia's performance and doesn't seem to be reflective of industry trend."
I took 1.5% profit this morning shorting this. Lots of support at $146. Blew out loads of stop losses at $146 managed to get filled on my out at $145.77 after the stop loss explosion. So glad I didn't hold.
Expedia reached a 52 Week high at 131.99

137_140 is key in weekly chart
This stock would be about $500 plus if all hotels opened up 100% of that inventory to third-party reservation.
All time high. Despite the fact that several years ago the company was hitting on all cylinders when Dara K. was CEO and now it is having problems in every segment except maybe VBRO AND it is facing a systemic problem in the overall travel market is is apparently worth MORE than it ever has been before.Fraud markets. Great job Federal Reserve.
Diller is buying more stock because he plans on selling the company.....just my opinion
Any thoughts on target price guys? 100+ in sight
Watch for more upgrades as analyst realize this growth engine is about ready to rocket back to highs 160+
My guess is a buyout with a 30% premium at MINIMUM which puts buyout price at $144 per share about where the stock was trading before the latest quarterly report.
"Wells Fargo puts a $180 price target out, and says if they spin out Vrbo, that valuation alone could be $29B before any discounting. Boom,... next week !!! This is also enough time for the company to think about it prior to the earnings call and comment on it positively with intent. If so, stock goes up 50%."
Buyback program will bring price back to day highs and beyond. This company is getting prepped for some type of transformation.
"After earning it come down to around $126. All of a sudden it jumped to $142-143. I didn't find any reason behind it. Was this big jump result of massive short covering, or massive buying or the company corrected the earning report? Appreciate your input"
$160 by end of the week
I expect EXPE to be bought out soon.....this misstep by the company and subsequent drop in stock price is just the opportunity for an alphabet or Booking to buy this little gym at a discount to what they would normally pay.
Losing $19 a share and trading at $70 higher then when they made $15 per share ... reason ?
Maybe I should just change my positions to the opposite of what news. Home Depot earning were up and the stock went down the next day. Expedia earnings were garbage and the stock is up like 20% for the week. Absolutely insane logic. Maybe I should move to European markets the manipulation on the US markets is insane right now.
People will learn to live with virus and flu. Testing are grest news. Expe is still very profitable as it is virtual
"When will travel be back to pre-covid? That is the question, my guess is at the end of 2022. Until then expect losses from Expedia to increase, and their need to require more funding just to survive. There has also been a move to book directly in the market place as a result of their mishandling of cancellation during the Covid start."
Cheated me out of $1500 on my flights no refund except for flight vouchers even when I purchased their travel insurance that supposedly protects me from this. Going to get my money back even if I have to short their stock.
"My next Pure Earnings Short Sell play, after I Cover my AES Short later today, is going to be either EXPE or VTR. I haven't made an absolutely final decision, but I have narrowed my 300+ choices down to these two, and am slightly leaning in favor of EXPE. Hopefully she will have a strong, upside move day, which will only make her more of a Bloated Baby. Why EXPE as my next Pure Earnings Short Sell?? Consider: Massively over-valued. Close to her 52 week high for no rational reason. Long history of missing on either EPS or Revenue consensus estimates for quarterly earnings. Huge EPS and Revenue drops in 2020 due to Covid. Completely dependent upon both domestic and international travel for its revenue streams, which means massive uncertainty and headwinds going forward. Very weak overall financials: High debt. Poor Operating Margins. Return On Equity is poor. Growth Rate is downright BAD. Company is was not profitable last year and very unlikely to regain profitability this year.So, based on all these factors and much more, I deem EXPE extremely likely to sell off in direct response to her earnings release. Even if they modestly beat on EPS and Revenue estimates, a 3-6% sell off is likely. All the good news is already priced in on this Fat One. I just hope the market as a whole does not realize this fact today, because I want to get in at at least $170, not lower than that, when I do my Short play later this afternoon. Good Luck! :-)"
"Something is wrong when customer support goes great to none at all. You can NOT get a person on the phone, you can not get beyond the virtual chat attendant, the support page tells you to escalate via the email option which it does not offer. Something is going terribly wrong."
They had some interesting insights about EXPE on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
This company is worth at least $350 a share
"Another huge area of savings (49 MILLION) would be if a suitor purchased the company and eliminated the dividend""On September 12, 2019, Expedia Group paid a quarterly dividend of $50 million ($0.34 per common share). Inaddition, in November 2019, the Executive Committee of Expedia Group’s Board of Directors declared a quarterlycash dividend of $0.34 per share of outstanding common stock to be paid to stockholders of record as of the close ofbusiness on November 19, 2019, with a payment date of December 12, 2019. Based on current shares outstanding,the total payment for this quarterly dividend is estimated to be approximately $49 million. Future declaration ofdividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination ofExpedia Group’s Board of Directors."""
EXPE board needs to spin off VRBO maintaining 60% ownership while combining it with Trivago creating shareholder value juggernaut. Time for Diller to go!
Steady climb back to 110
I was a customer of Expedia and had booked a trip to Italy during the period of May. I had to cancel for obvious reasons and wasn’t refunded the total amount. I was told I have a voucher to use for a period of 12 at the hotel in Italy. I can’t travel to Italy in that time period and I’m out $1850.00. I hope all you investors understand many people are complaining to there respective states attorney general’s and the BBB. There stick is going to drop..
"Expedia is a pure Internet company. Majority of the expenses come from the salary of customer service reps. Server hosting goes down automatically when the load is low (virtual machines are automatically put to sleep). I am sure they have furloughed customer service people to save cost plus stimulus will provide some relief. I loaded up last week. As soon as the virus spread slows and lockdown is relaxed, watch for a violent rally in the market. Will take time before Dow gets back to 29000 but even if Dow goes up 3000 points, EXPE may touch 70 (still 50% off from the high)."

I Think Booking.com will buy Expedia down the road . This is my opinion . This will help travel industry to compete with Google.
The big Institutions and Hedgies are making sure this stock gets beaten down before they decide to take it up...they make money going down and then up......retail traders just have to be patient and wait for them......but it will happen
EXPE is also trading strange......usually stock would show some buy interest headed into earnings but the volume is nothing.....but isn't that be what that article i posted below said would happen....company would want the stock to basically flat line until they announce buyout...hmmmm...interesting
"Airbnb is being IPOed in the $40B range, Expedia is at around $18B, but Expedia owns Vrbo which is arguably a more valuable franchise - it targets wealthier vacationers who want to rent nice properties in their entirety. I used Vrbo last summer and the place was great."
"I love this coordinated fear mogering to pick up a growth company. Push it down by big traders , triggered stop lkss selling errouneously. Then buy in drones. The increase onfidence in consumers just in time favor travel stocks with aging boomers. The increased earnings look solid as rkck and happy to book my holidays and trips through Expedia. I have book marked it and nothing to do with searxh.lol."
EXPE is down -4.91% to 122.98
I'll be adding more...
EXPE will not be cash flow positive until at least winter 2021 if a vaccine is distributed this spring... my guess: EXPE will be trading at $70/sh this EOM...
"The biggest problem with Expedia is that google is building up the direct competition. Expedia managements must partner with other digital marketing channels as much as they can - increase commission rate for affiliates, offer many many free nights..."
why it went down during after hours ?
who else bought in at the drop last ER?
"some pretty decent volume AH today...was at 41k shares at $104 and then spiked to $113, it then drifted to the current AH price of $106 on over 350k shares...that is pretty significant!"
THEY ARE HOLDING CLIENTS MONEY DUE TO CORONA AND REFUSING REFUNDS
"To me this line is VERY telling...(from article I posted earlier)""During the talk, according to travel business site Skift, Diller announced to Expedia employees that he and Kern will be evaluating the company's needs before a new CEO and chief financial officer is appointed.""Evaluating means shopping the company around...if they cant sell it for what they want THEN they put someone permanent in the CEO/CFO position."
It’s almost time to start buying up expe long term calls
Bought this today at 94.5 hope I made a good decision
"I'd expect the company to start buying back shares before the ex-dividend date so they wouldn't have to pay dividends on the shares they repurchase. I'd bet they are in the market today buying on the dip. If the stock revereses higher by the end of the day, you'll know why."
What is the thought on buy now or wait until after earnings?
Back to the highs today after a small dip. Markets reaching highs daily.
Options indicate a higher price for December. Best to just wait it out. Algos what ever.
"As long as the company doesn't hire a ""permanent"" CEO or CFO you can bet the company is being shopped around. It is undervalued at the price....the earnings cc should be VERY interesting."
They are spending too much on advertising Delta will delay everything. What a waist of $ stockholder $
Loss of marketshare to Google should be a huge antitrust concert. Google puts its flight search at the top of its search results and demands websites buy ads to place above its own booking aggregator. How is that fair? Expedia is going to keep going down and lose marketshare to Google until regulators do something about it.
My favourite EXPE online travel sites are Travelocity and Hotwire. They beat BOOKING hands down on value and reliability.
"Caution. Expedia states they are delaying refunds for valid cancelations for previously confirmed VRBO/HA reservations by ""three to four weeks"". (Deposits for new reservations are processed immediately.)I have personal experience with this exceptionally poor procedure with two property deposits that toatl $11K.Essentially it is unknown if / when a refund will be processed.At the least this is exceptionally poor customer / client service that does affect present and furture business. This also is an indication of cash flow issues. Beware."
"The market has way over reacted to the recent earnings. Target price remains at $137.37 which is a huge upside gain!Count me in.Oh, already in!"

"The high price target for EXPE is $180.00 and the low price target for EXPE is $124.00. There are currently 14 hold ratings and 11 buy ratings for the stock, resulting in a consensus rating of ""Hold.""Issuer: Expedia Group"
Next stop is 138.50
"So the CEO Diller says with him and others running the company, they're expecting ""double digit"" growth in 2020. In the meantime they missed their revenue number, and they pulled guidance going forward because of the global uncertainty regarding travel because of the coronavirus. And yet, the stock is up 11% in pre market. A couple of analysts for whatever reason raised their price targets. The Wedbush analyst just gave a 12 month target of $121 with a neutral rating."
