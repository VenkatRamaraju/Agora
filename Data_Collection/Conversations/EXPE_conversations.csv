I thought shorts couldnt participate today because of the % amount that dropped Friday? Sure does feel like short sellers are pressing this down AGAIN today.
"Wells Fargo puts a $180 price target out, and says if they spin out Vrbo, that valuation alone could be $29B before any discounting. Boom,... next week !!! This is also enough time for the company to think about it prior to the earnings call and comment on it positively with intent. If so, stock goes up 50%."
European Union has officially reached an agreement Wednesday morning to lift travel ban on the United States. Change will take effect in the coming days. -Reuters Huge win for the airline & travel industry right before Summer's pent-up demand begins.$DAL $AAL $UAL $SAVE $JETS $JBLU $ABNB $CCL $RCL $NCLH $TRIP $LUV $EXPE
"Five years ago on this day, EXPE closed at 94.23. Well good news is that if you buy it now and hold it for a year (or may be less), this will go up nicely. Travel is dead right now but this is an internet company. It is not like an airlines that has planes parked on the ground and billions everymonth in the fix expenses. BKNG and EXPE will survive and come back strongly. Too much volatility these days in both directions. Yes was 64 just a few days ago. Market is likely to dance around these levels for a while."
BREAKING: Boris Johnson says UK lockdown very likely to be lifted on July 19th and the UK health secretary said there's no reason to extend the lockdown any further.$DAL $AAL $UAL $SAVE $JETS $JBLU $ALK $LUV $ABNB $BA $EXPE
"I'm not sure why people here are saying this is overvalued. Expedia owns VRBO, which is similiar to Airbnb, and if ABNB is valued at nearly $130B, how's a $20-25B valuation for EXPE unreasonable? Feel free to explain."
"So the largest US public company, Apple, just warned the street today that they will not meet their revenue guidance in the future because of the effect the coronavirus will have on the supply chain and demand for sales in China. In related news, EXPE's stock went up over 12% on Friday after refusing to provide guidance for upcoming quarters, due to the coronavirus. AAPL's announcement today will have implications for the broader market, and the markets will probably be weak for sometime. If Apple is worried about the coronavirus, how does this news effect the travel industry for companies like Expedia? My take is traders will realize the travel industry will be effected more than most, and this may be the catalyst for the stock to close the previous gap up Friday, maybe down to about $111."
EXPE is certainly underperforming compared to other travel stocks. I don't get it?!
"EXPE is a screaming buy. Looking at the #120-$130 range by March. Earnings estimates have been reduced, low bar to beat, and a price we have not seen in years, not to mention market seasonality will provide support. This is a can't miss in the midterm."
I expect EXPE to be bought out soon.....this misstep by the company and subsequent drop in stock price is just the opportunity for an alphabet or Booking to buy this little gym at a discount to what they would normally pay.
"Google is the game-changer here. Their search engine is the first to pop when searching for travel stuff. More than 80% of people use Google as their default search engine. Expedia is generally not the cheapest, Priceline is. With Google taking over, all of these travel sites are in jeopardy. ""Expedia Chief Executive Officer Mark Okerstrom said the same day. “Google does continue to push for more revenue per visitor. And I think it’s just the reality of where the world is.”Unfortauataly, the pendalion shift has started."
"If this is not making sense of why is up, let me explain smart money needs to trick everyone into thinking the worst is over once everyone is Chasing prices going up they will sell 2-3% into retail amateurs trading that have never trade it before. Give it time and you will see the 10-20% drop come soon maybe by Friday depending of how many people they see buying the stock going up and up and then Boom drops 3-5% and then again it happens again because they know retail traders keep hoping for it to come up and boom down another 3-8% don’t believe me watch"
Loss of marketshare to Google should be a huge antitrust concert. Google puts its flight search at the top of its search results and demands websites buy ads to place above its own booking aggregator. How is that fair? Expedia is going to keep going down and lose marketshare to Google until regulators do something about it.
"Anyone remember when IBM bought RedHat out of the blue? They offered $75 over the closing price from day before which was at $115.......I was in that one because I had a gut feeling someone might make a run at them because they were under valued at the time......EXPE is under valued here.""ARMONK, N.Y. and RALEIGH, N.C., Oct. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), the world's leading provider of open source cloud software, announced today that the companies have reached a definitive agreement under which IBM will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Red Hat for $190.00 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $34 billion.""I'm expecting EXPE to be bought out soon....I have no information or rumor but merely a gut feeling that has served me pretty well in the past. The longer we go with no replacement CEO or CFO the more likely this scenario becomes in my opinion. Diller is in his 70's and controls 48% of the voting power so basically he alone decides where this company goes......you dont think he would jump on an offer for $145 from BKNG or Google?? I think he would."
Currently short this stock. The management crisis coupled with the Coronavirus makes this stock easy pickings. I probably am not short for the long haul but there is money to be made on the short side in the immediate term.
"The biggest problem with Expedia is that google is building up the direct competition. Expedia managements must partner with other digital marketing channels as much as they can - increase commission rate for affiliates, offer many many free nights..."
"Airbnb is being IPOed in the $40B range, Expedia is at around $18B, but Expedia owns Vrbo which is arguably a more valuable franchise - it targets wealthier vacationers who want to rent nice properties in their entirety. I used Vrbo last summer and the place was great."
CEO of Expedia: Searches don’t equal sales! Talk sales not searches! You don’t get paid for ad clicks like google
"“ On Thursday Diller was laser-focused on IAC's travel site, Expedia which has seen its stock drop nearly 18 percent in the last three months. Diller, who serves as Expedia Group chairman, and vice-chairman Peter Kern held a ""fireside"" conversation conducted by the president of Expedia Business Services, Ariane Gorin. During the talk, according to travel business site Skift, Diller announced to Expedia employees that he and Kern will be evaluating the company's needs before a new CEO and chief financial officer is appointed.”"
"As for my most recent experience with expe there was no one availble to talk to after I had made a reservation. I called and got a "" I'll get back to you shortly"" which btw never happened after I call a few times, I called their 877# and a virtual assistant answers do you want to cancel your reservation or keep i. I will never use this outdated throwback service again. I give it A (**) from 1-10 thats 10 for great service. why is this stock $145 a share? it should be pink sheets traded otc.expeQ.pk"
