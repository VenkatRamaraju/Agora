Recall on units sold. Fingers are being damaged. Guards are distributed and liability insurance covers issues. Merrill still has pt of $480. Fyi
Buy any dip!!!
Incredible Results !!! $ 500 by end of August once the dust settles
"Anyone watching the odd trading in the stock. The last three or four days we move up between 5% and 7% only to retrace it back every day to only being up a few cents on the day. The company had a very positive accounts receivable to payable ratio and paid down a lot of debt at that $18 a share offering in February this year when the bottom fell out of the stock. The accounts receivable payable ratio could be a nice indication that this company has a surprise profit in the quarter ending September 30th, 2021. Last quarter's earnings or loss was quite a bit better than last year's same quarter and revenues were up nicely too. A few more well targeted hurricanes and we could see some nice sales down the line. Also, Generac $GNRC has been on a buying spree with similar companies though many of them privately owned so it is tough to tell what their real value might be. $NEOV also has had a nice steady up move in this industry and is up about 225% over the past two years. While we are up too we have given up almost all of the spectacular gains from earlier in the year. Just checked on etrade and at least as of today it is showing approximately 12.3% of the shares shorted right now or about 1.4 million shares. The 10 day average volume on this stock is 146,000 shares going into today and 30 day average about 325,000 shares. Today we hit 625,000 shares with most shares traded at higher prices. We have had three nice days in a row of significant volume over the 10 day average the last three days. IMOH we tend to see large volume spikes more not under accumulation but more to build up the average daily trading volume of the shares for a couple weeks prior to big position short covering. Typically half the 30 day average volume and be short covered in a day. The 30 day average volume is 325,000 share so currently about 163,000 shares can be covered in a day more per day if the average volume increases. However, at today's level with about 1.4 million shares short we are sitting at an 8 days to cover ratio which translates to at least 163,000 shares being purchased daily or about a million dollars a day for at least 8 days until position is covered, if the price of the stock jumps then more than a million dollars a day. $AMC had the big run with only about one to two days to cover because volume is so high and $GME not much more. POLA has way less shares outstanding. I think the company might have a shot to make some money to to build real wealth for long term holder actually generating a return on corporate assets and building company book value. Company has fairly low debt and decent amount of cash on hand. I pretty nice gem when you consider how many times multiples a great majority of stocks are trading for. Owned early in the year for $4 sold around $6.50 before it launched. Now accumulating again from the $6.36 range down to the $5.36 range. Nice to be able to use some of the people's money who paid $18 a share in the offering. If you been holding a while maybe we get a nice break again by the end of the year we just have to root for some more hurricanes and get people to buy more portable power and off grid generation. Let's get this rocket ship going again. Not sure what the average short level is and what will trigger a short cover but we might be getting close to a couple triggers looking at the recent trading patterns. Good luck to the long players out there. Let's get the rocket ship to the moon."
so cool to buy more at this level.. thanks
Don’t know why GNRC down 5% in the early trading
green new deal. build back china! go generac! we will all need power if socialists go green. hope we can find $15.00 a gallon gas to power generators.

Anyone know what Generacs sales are in Europe and China? I am wondering how these power crunches will benefit Generac if at all.

So… I placed an order for a 24 kw Generac generator an provided a deposit to my local Service provider. It will not be available until November. Long lead-time and $12k cost makes it an expensive proposition. Current lawsuits accumulating for oil leaks due to lack of maintenance by owners makes it a long term expense. Who else on this board has one??

"Citigroup price target came out this morning @ $500. Today, we go up."
GNRC is positioned to do quite well in the years ahead!The severe weather patterns caused by global warming has created a need for power generators around the world today! An example would be what happened in the state of Texas when the electric power went out in February 2021. People do not want to be left without electricity during a power outage for weeks! GO GNRC GO!!!
GNRC is continuing to climb!!! GO GNRC GO!!!
Haha. Up $9 pre market!!!
Millions of new home owners are lining up to buy generic systems. Home Depot and every major electrical contractor in the country are booking and installing.
The manipulation on GNRC yesterday should be investigated. A deliberate attempt to push the price down to get shares cheaper later in the day. Someone knew....and it wasn't us.
"7/26 Guggenheim raised price target from $460-540, and KeyBank raised from $400 - $500.7/29 Openheimer, UBS and Canaccord Genuity all raised price target to $500, from $375, $390 and $406, respectively."
"As previously stated. 7/29 Oppenheimer raised pt to $500 from $375. The finger amputation occurred 8 times with portable gas generators from2013 to 2017 out of 350,000 generators. There is a handle now to protect people when they move them. They DO have liability insurance. Buying opportunity in you face! July 29th Canaccord raised pt from $406 to $500!!!"
GNRC is rallying!!! GO GNRC GO!!!
"GNRC management can make this go up or down wednesday. Great fundamentals are a given. All depends on their stated outlook, supply chains, whether they can hit production targets."
"Gigantic growth potential. Reason: the adoption of green energy (solar, wind, etc.) will result in very unstable and inconsistent power grids/supplies that will result is frequent brown outs and rolling blackouts. Check out Germany it's already happened/happening right now, and they're already getting back into coal plants to stabilize their national grid. And increasing natural disasters. And when both of the above happen, people who are grossly addicted to their phones and electronics will do anything, including installing a $10k generator on their home and buy mobile ones if they can't afford the fixed one."
"I buy GNRC now for the growth because in two years, anyone who has an EV will want a outage backup to charge the auto and electricity to open the garage door. (besides all the other wifi needs etc. until power returns) - fuel and /or solar power backup."
$400 stock in 6 months. Earnings and outlook will crush.
Lawsuits against GNRC=frivolous.
I’ve a concern that GNRC is being lumped in with the solar energy sector as opposed to being an industrial.The solar sector is overbought and hence over priced with abnormally high P/Es. As they sell off it appears GNRC goes right with them.Would be better for shareholders if funds didn’t view GNRC in this manner.In one respect GNRC brings this upon themselves by failing to offer distributions. That smacks of growth vs. value.IMO GNRC needs to retain its identity as primarily a generator manufacturer - which it is (though less so every month).
I purchased a IQ2000 generator and registered it through your company before I even took it out of the box. I put fresh fuel and oil that came with it and tried to start it. It did not start. I took the unit to a authorized service center. They said it needs a new carburetor. ( It's brand new)Their warranty department will not cover the repair because I lost my receipt. I registered it and it's on your company file. The warranty states: Unit must be registered and/or proof of purchase.
"Insiders exercising options and selling whenever stock hits new highs. Just a small part of their holdings. Normal. Outweighed by company buybacks. Nervous nellies fearing supply chain and inflation issues will crimp performance and earnings report. Company fundamentals are intact and excellent. Lawsuits are major BS, but amunition for shorts. These dips are gifts for the long-term value investor."
"Unfortunately for GNRC, Wall Street is lumping them into the solar sector. That sector continues to get beaten down and will until the chip shortage issue resolves. That’ll take months.GNRC refuses to distribute any dividend so they are also being construed as a growth stock, not value. They’re sitting on a pile of cash but looking at acquisitions - as we’ve seen. Institutional investors don’t look favorably on that.It shouldn’t be a surprise PPS is dropping. They are still considered an industrial, and rightly so. A typical P/E should be approximately 20ish. GNRC 3 times that…I don’t recommend selling. Hold or buy. Once Congress gets off their duff, and once the chip shortage abates, PPS should more than recover.Don’t ever expect to see a dividend."
early in the day...
"With such great earnings and a strong 2021 outlook, I wouldn't be surprised if this stock closes green today."

"Earnings up and the stock is crushed, pray that nobody is born with my luck. I don’t know what to do now."
Just on the news in Italy where they are having California like fires. Says it may cause excessive power outages.
"After a stock goes up so much and becomes more than 5% of a fund's assets, or whatever their bylaws say, they have to sell off a chunk to stay within limits of how much of a company can occupy the fund's assets. Thats whats happening today. There is still the potential for a melt up with this. No matter what, companys fundamentals are A+++ and the stock is still a good value buy."
great buying opportunity today
Guggenheim's sharp raise on PT should have sent this thing up 20-40 today. Tells me the GNRC treasury boys stepped back today and let the poor widdle shorts play in the sandbox.

"profit takers today, no worries. GNRC is the big dog in backup power, which is sorely needed with our flakey grid, climate change weather events."
"GNRC has surpassed my target sell in 2 of my trading accounts. I typically take profits at 100% gain. One acct at 114% and the other at 123%. Not even going to trim. P/E at 56 too.Sales and backlog continue to build. Not sure if their latest factories have come online…Well, despite zero yield, I’m gonna hold. This trend should run another 4 Q’s. Sometimes rules are made to be broken.Generac turning into an absolute behemoth."

Earnings will be off the charts! Hold strong longs
"This is a good company, but not worth 50 times TTM P/E. With a PEG ratio of 5, it looks like the stock has another 50% to fall from here, before being reasonably priced."
Day traders and earnings bettors get hurt. Long term value investors get rewarded so this is a gift if you're the latter.
"Rising revenue & earnings the last 4 qtrs, chart consolidating in an uptrend, more people moving to the burbs/houses selling like hot cakes, and add to that all the stimulus checks they have gone out over the last year. Does that sound like something you should short? LOL no way."
I'm still kicking myself for not getting into Generac when it was $50. I was waiting for a pullback to the $40's which never came. Congrats to all of you longs out there!
I already have a paper gain on the few shares I added earlier today. Long term 
"Wow, so many thumbs. down on these recent positive comments. Shorts beware. We are coming up on peak hurricane season, heat related power outages in affluent neighborhoods and dangerously dry conditions in Cali and Oregon."
I sold about half yesterday around $228 so you have me to thank for today's surge :)
"Anybody,please throw some light, why it is crushed ? Has anybody any money in this stock or they are all asleep?"

I have noticed Kohler has gotten into the home generator business as a direct competitor to Generac. Has anyone heard about their products? They have a name in plumbing but that may not be of much benefit in this market.

"Long $GNRC and short $OESX today, a good result"
Previous earnings were super strong with high demand of the home generator product. They were having a hard time keeping up with supply on generators last I heard. I don't think that changed. Price targets high for this stock but it seems stuck waiting for the earnings recharge.

Back up the truck if you're a long-termer. You can be sure that executives at GNRC are delighted to buy back the stock at these levels.
"Green energy #$%$s here in California are in the early stages of outlawing new gas hookups. This is potentially a very big deal. Since it represents 10% of the nations population, as California goes, so goes the country. We are talking all electric appliances (stoves, cooktops, clothes dryers), home heating and hot water heaters. No mention yet on swimming pool/spa water heaters. I love Generac products, but California is run by fanatics that are on a crusade to totally eliminate carbon emissions."

"Hey Yahoo Finance…when are you going to pull all that Class Action Lawsuit garbage off of GNRC’s wall. Their stock is up $23 share today and when I go to their Yahoo Finance wall to see why, all I see is ads from a bunch of ambulance chasers trying to make money off the small drop in price Generac had after their recall for injuries caused by a Generator of theirs…and from what I’ve heard you’d have to be mentally challenged to manage to do that. By the way, their stock is now well above that small drop they had when the recall was announced."
"""GNRC"" stock price prognosis for 2026-08-31 is 1118.990 USD. A bit of a wait for a double, but since 9 out of 10 analysts still consider this a buy to a strong buy, it's very safe money."
Generac makes quality products. I have a 22 kilowatt generator for my house with automatic switchover in case of an outage. Very happy with it.
besides the vaccine makers this is by far the best performing stock purchase I've made over the years. If they offered a dividend I'd throw even more money at them. They always pop around hurricane season. GLTA shareholders 
Over reaction to supply disruptions. Earnings were great under the circumstances. Stock rebounding and I wouldn't rule out going positive today.

"recall on a lot of portable gens, probably going to lead to lawsuits...."
No reason this company shouldn't be sporting a 40-50 billion market cap. Analysts will revise their PTs to 800+ after next earnings report.
Wow what a chart today.
"I’d suggest $GNRC acquire a weak company like $OESX to get into the commercial building upgrade market via a motivated broker network. I’d guess target is overvalued today but enterprise values around $100 million make sense to me. Blue Ocean idea I know. If this network can sell such a limited offering, think of what they could do with $GNRC portfolio. Some conflict but nothing that can’t be worked out."
"I like that there's attorneys still out there trying to sue Generac for the shareholders for all these GAINS.... I can see it now from the attorneys ""please stop making so much money because it's getting harder for us to have any reason to sue you on behalf of the shareholders"" Can't wait until those headlines are gone."

A year and a half ago. My best friend got a generic installed. The installer told him that he personally installed 75 generators in the last year. That’s 1 installer. Can you imagine the business general is doing now with all this money in our system plus weather getting more extreme. $600 a share soon
"This latest disaster will increase backlogs through remainder of year, not to mention we are in store for another active hurricane season. Generac will crush earnings every quarter for at least the next 5-7. 450+ is the minimum conservative price target for Q4 '21."
"My logic for this stock is the California Utility plan to cut power whenever the winds may cause the lines to come down and possibly spark fires. So folks who live nearby have no juice. CA Gov't tells them to go to solar- nice, but it doesn't work at night and won't power A/C. People are really PiZZed at being told to essentialy use candles- like in 1887!!!. Generac offers whole house generators that run on propane or nat gas. A big finger to the power utility!!!. Generac was in the mid $70's in 2018 and I got in there. Generac can't keep up with CA sales, so I see earnings on an up track for the forseeable future. Policy from the ""smart People"" can have unintended consequences and investors just need to think things thru. Lots of opportunities now with the new crazy DC crowd."
This stock should be at 600!
The markets are rallying!!! GO GNRC GO!!!
What is going on with this stock today? Down $25 when all the analysts are calling for $500+?

$500 soon - with Hurricane Ida hitting the southern states.
"Long and strong 1500 shares @ 367. Let's go, Generac. That morning swoon yesterday was tense but now we going over 400 fast. True growth stock."
American rescue plan will depend on windmills and solar all made in china. we will all need generators when no sun or wind LOL!
Anyone else think it's time to load up?
"""on Wednesday reported Q2 adjusted EPS of $2.39, up from $1.40 a year earlier. Analysts polled by Capital IQ forecast $2.32. The generator maker said sales rose to $920 million in the June quarter from $546.8 ""million last year."""
"So it looks like most people don’t realize that’s it’s not a one day process to be added to the S&P. The many separate indexes and funds that Generac was in are still selling while the new funds and indexes are currently buying. It’s a balancing act. When this process is complete, Generac will rise quickly. This transition is more unique than some as Generac is 93% owned by institution. That is rare for a new entry. Price action will not and has not been as predictable. As a generac dealer I can tell you I’ve never been this busy and there is no sign of slowing. I expect 400by next earnings and $500 year end"

"What a bunch of ninnies. Bought in heavy on the drop, making money instantly on the turn around. It has happened before, but it's been a long time. Sheering sheep is a fun job, especially when they're stampeding to try and run out the gate. Can we have an amen for the BAAAAAAAAAA's"
Don't ever recall a stock tanking after getting added into the S&P 500
"huge vol selling, dropping fast, no news, any ideas?"
"I love Generac's commercial about solar power and battery storage, but it really seems like marketing BS. They are acting like they have some grand solar solution, but Generac isn't doing anything with solar that I'm aware of. You need a system that generates solar power during the day, runs off of battery or the grid overnight, and keeps generating power when the grid is down. That would be the real game changer and sales would go through the roof. Despite their nice commercial, they only support a small part of the solution."
Look at GNRC rally!!! GO GNRC GO!!!
"Buy on dips and you'll be in the chips. Every homeowner in the world wants one of these babies. Wait till GNRC offers home energy monitoring on a ""subscription basis""! FUGEDDABOUTIT! $1,000+ a share by then!"

"From Zack's in Yahoo Finance :Generac Holdings GNRC sports a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.This designer and manufacturer of power generation equipment, energy storage systems, and other power products is benefiting from solid demand for portable and home standby generators due to higher power outage events.The company is working aggressively to increase production levels and plans to increase capacity early in the second half of 2021 to address growing demand for home standby generators.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Generac’s 2020 earnings stands at $6.19 per share, having moved 4.7% north over the past 30 days. For 2021, the consensus mark for earnings has moved up 7.3% to $7.24 per share over the same time frame."
"From IBD today Shares fell 11.6% to 387.80 on the stock market today. Generac stock is still well extended past a buy point from a double-bottom base after triggering the eight-week-hold rule. The stock is in profit-taking zone, according to MarketSmith chart analysis."

"Word on the street is Generac is selling as fast as they can make them, they will 100% be posting a amazing earnings report end of month and Moody's just upgraded Generac GNRC ""Generac will experience robust demand for its residential home standby generators for years to come, in part from power outages due to volatile weather and the aging US electrical grid, but also from greater importance being placed on a continuous uninterrupted power supply to the home going forward and utility induced shutdowns in certain regions"" said Moody's Vice President and lead analyst for Generac, Brian Silver."""

"Stock is cheap, doesn't need the infrastructure bill to keep chugging. Super high PEG ratio."
"The entire solar energy sector is being hit today. Despite GNRC not relying on their solar component as being a primary earnings driver Wall Street still lumps them into that sector and that sector is being disaffected by the microchip shortage issue. GNRC is indeed impacted by that issue but are continuing to ship generators without chips and will retrofit in the field when chips become available. Unfortunately for the investor, GNRC’s continued acquisitions and their unwillingness to provide distributions or share buybacks aren’t helping the cause. Wall Street subsequently views them a growth stock vs. the stereotypical industrial value stock. Jagdfeld has done little to nothing to dispel this belief.Unfortunately for my portfolio, GNRC is an overweight. As PPS continues its descent, I’m losing many thousands.Still in all I’ve continued to hold and, if I were more risk adverse, I’d be adding. Just won’t make that move as GNRC already over 15% my portfolio.I can’t stand that trite “Stay long and strong” quip but…… I am. "
600 by December. Stock seems awfully cheap.
Credit Suisse PT was actually a downgrade. Cred Suisse took a huge short position yesterday.
Really need to see this start to participate and break out of consolidation. This company is in a good niche. Maybe more news of blackouts will get the attention of FIDO and the big boys buying 100K+ shares.
"WAUKESHA, Wis., May 10, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Weather outlets are forecasting an above-average hurricane season this year and combined with an aging electrical grid, the potential for widespread power outages may leave homeowners in a heightened state of anxiety, which can be remedied by being prepared. With National Hurricane Preparedness Week taking place May 9-15, these outlooks highlight the fact that early preparations are essential."" Not to mention cyber attacks!"

"GNRC is actually a solid buy here. They're back-ordered 6 months. But they're adding major manufacturing capacity. This company could achieve a market cap of 50 billion, justifiably, in no time. New homeowners, outside of cities, are lining up to buy generic generators by the millions. They become lifetime members with service contracts after they buy unit as well."
Just saw news of a new manufacturing/assembly/distribution facility opening in South Carolina. Expected to be operational by 3rd quarter. Great news from a great company!
I own a number of industrials and recently bought some GNRC as it was off it's high. Really like what they are doing and listened to the last conference call. The other industrials I own are all up 3-4% today but this stock is up almost 9%. I looked at the usual suspects like an upgrade but see no news. To be up this much vs. other industrials even on a good day there has to be some news. Maybe a long term holder can fill me in. Thanks.
The stock was up almost 90% ytd and the company guided net margins to 15.5 to 16% down from 16 to 17%.I don't trade so I can't tell you what to do but this will be a thousand dollars a share in 3 years
"the ""normal"" reaction these days .. just look at almost any company that produces good numbers .. they all get whacked .. the only thing that springs to mind is that personal stock options can now be exercised and sold of after that the market should recover .. ? rack 'm and stack 'm ?"
GNRC down 10% this morning... just bough another 50 shares. Take advantage of this pullback while you can GNRC wont stay below $400 very long. GNRC has made phenomenal gains over the last 5 years and will continue to dominate.
GNRC could easily smash 500 by friday. They're getting orders from everyone in Texas. Add the entire mid-atlantic region. You already know about california.
Generac — The generator manufacturer saw its stock slide more than 4% after it issued new targets for 2024 at its Investor Day Wednesday morning. They include an adjusted earnings margin of 24%to 25% compared to FactSet estimates of 26.9%. It also repeated its full year 2021 guidance.A 2% guidance reduction for 2024 shouldn't warrant a 4% drop in share price today. Strong 2021 guidance is still intact. This stock has a long runway for outstanding future gains and institutional investors will see the value at buying GNRC at these levels. Go GNRC!!!

"GNRC CEO, Aaron Jagdfeld was just on CNBC outlining a compelling argument for protecting homes and businesses with Generac generators. The long term trajectory for this stock is huge with natural disasters getting stronger as the nation's power grid becomes more vulnerable and archaic. Even the small funds set aside in the infrastructure bill won't help it."

I just had an whole house estimator leave. He recommends a 24KW Unit for my needs. His company is now finally receiving units ordered in Aug 2020. The unit I need will not be available until October 2021. Kohler & Briggs & Stratton are competing in this space and filling the void. What do you think about Generac as an investment for the next 12 months? I appreciate your feedback in advance.
"The PT revisions are laughable. This baby will be 500, justifiably, in a week or two."
Too many  on some of these comments. So I'm going to test...
"I'm seeing a LOT of thumbs down for almost every positive comment, but there are no negative comments to go along with the thumb downs. Odd. Some shorty probably figured how to manipulate that."
"I sold my position at 116 a few weeks ago. Bought it back today close to 90. Since the Dow was down 3000 poiints yesterday and gnrc was near 85, I'm comfortable requiring for a long term investment hold. I think this stock will rebound in the future because while everyone sits at home, scared to death, they are going to be thinking, maybe I need a back-up generator for my house, so I can weather the next catastrophic storm. This stock which has approximately a 5 billion dollar market cap is going to substantially grow in the years to come. Thats my belief."
Another acquisition? I used to see the same phenomenon with Actuant. They were riding high and buying up smaller semi-related privately held companies. They were milking their cash cow Enerpac.They refused to initiate buyback programs. When they finally began a distribution it topped out at $.02/share.ATU officers were incentivized by revenue more than profits. The BOD was along for the ride.It didn’t work out as eventually it caught up to them. Their management team walked away fat and happy while the employees and shareholders got beaten down. Lots of parallels here. Very disconcerting.End of story is bigger doesn’t necessarily equate to better. Bigger is just bigger.Wall Street analysts are hip to this. Shareholders should be too.
"The NASDAQ was down over 100 points this morning in early trading and it came rushing back along with GNRC. This is why you don’t “panic sell” a growth stock with excellent fundamentals and a veteran management team that’s focused on providing strong long term profitability. With institutional ownership of over 90% and a small float coupled with 2% short interest, GNRC is poised to generate an exceptional ROI for investors that stay the course."
