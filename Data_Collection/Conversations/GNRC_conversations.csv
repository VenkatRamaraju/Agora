I can see it now from the attorneys ""please stop making so much money because it's getting harder for us to have any reason to sue you on behalf of the shareholders"" Can't wait until those headlines are gone."

"GNRC CEO, Aaron Jagdfeld was just on CNBC outlining a compelling argument for protecting homes and businesses with Generac generators. The long term trajectory for this stock is huge with natural disasters getting stronger as the nation's power grid becomes more vulnerable and archaic. Even the small funds set aside in the infrastructure bill won't help it."
Generac reached an all time high at 484.59
You can thank ENPH earnings results for today's pop in the GNRC stock price. Inverter and solar business looks good for Generac long term.
"Insiders exercising options and selling whenever stock hits new highs. Just a small part of their holdings. Normal. Outweighed by company buybacks. Nervous nellies fearing supply chain and inflation issues will crimp performance and earnings report. Company fundamentals are intact and excellent. Lawsuits are major BS, but amunition for shorts. These dips are gifts for the long-term value investor."
"Reason for the rally... Truist initiated coverage of GNRC today with a ""buy"" rating and a price target of $500 with further substantial growth in 2022."

Generac — The generator manufacturer saw its stock slide more than 4% after it issued new targets for 2024 at its Investor Day Wednesday morning. They include an adjusted earnings margin of 24%to 25% compared to FactSet estimates of 26.9%. It also repeated its full year 2021 guidance.A 2% guidance reduction for 2024 shouldn't warrant a 4% drop in share price today. Strong 2021 guidance is still intact. This stock has a long runway for outstanding future gains and institutional investors will see the value at buying GNRC at these levels. Go GNRC!!!
What is going on with this stock today? Down $25 when all the analysts are calling for $500+?

how will this stock compete with tesla when tesla is creating batteries at home batteries and stuff?
"For an equity that’s gained 119% YTD this board is very quiet.Despite being a small cap with a 62M float and 1.5M short their should be more verbiage here.Mayhaps Robert’s spam and attaching multiple thumbs down  to posts turns folks off.Earnings call in 5 days. What are your sentiments?Personally, I just couldn’t resist some profit taking and took 10% off the top.ENPH is a competitor of sorts with GNRC. They had another earnings beat and had a +24% day followed by another up day today. ENPH and GNRC trades along the same path within the same sector. I’m eagerly awaiting earnings call and expect a beat despite shortage issues. GNRC my largest holding. May have to do more profit taking in another week.Ok Robert, come get me…. And Jim can assign another smarmy post."
is this ambulance chasers lawsuit the only news for gnrc with a 22 point increase today?
Anyone know what Generacs sales are in Europe and China? I am wondering how these power crunches will benefit Generac if at all.
"Oct. 28, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Generac Power Systems, Inc., (NYSE: GNRC) a leading global designer and manufacturer of energy technology solutions and other power products, today announced the introduction of the new Guardian 26kW Home Standby Generator – the most powerful air-cooled home standby generator available.

Timing of new product offerings logical given earnings are coming up? Just asking the question as I am thinking of expanding shares in portfolio.
"It’s tiresome continuing to hear about how hurricanes are such a catalyst for sales. Sure, it helps sales but that is not as big a driver as many believe.The U.S., and Europe, have over extended power grids. Generators, especially standby, will continue to be in demand. GNRC entry into solar/battery systems will grow as well as propane and diesel powered units.Earnings will be adversely impacted by the shortage issue but will be muted to a very large extent as GNRC is a very well rounded OEM and other than batteries, steel, and wiring they fabricate, paint, assemble, warehouse and ship their own goods themselves. GNRC also continuing to expand and build new production facilities as is evidenced by Pewaukee, WI ground breaking.The hurricane factor is blown (no pun intended) WAY out of proportion."
Up we go from here! GO GNRC GO!!!

"Hey Yahoo Finance…when are you going to pull all that Class Action Lawsuit garbage off of GNRC’s wall. Their stock is up $23 share today and when I go to their Yahoo Finance wall to see why, all I see is ads from a bunch of ambulance chasers trying to make money off the small drop in price Generac had after their recall for injuries caused by a Generator of theirs…and from what I’ve heard you’d have to be mentally challenged to manage to do that. By the way, their stock is now well above that small drop they had when the recall was announced."
"500 tomorrow, breaking 600 by Friday. Maybe 700. 750 next week."
"Up over 10% last 5 trading days, have to explain some profit taking. With a week to earnings I gotta do some deliberating meself."
"Will the new products impede production of current products or are they INCREMENTAL in sales and production resources ......Have more to read on this, but wondering if anyone has seen any specifics on this point. Thanks."
"The entire solar energy sector is being hit today. Despite GNRC not relying on their solar component as being a primary earnings driver Wall Street still lumps them into that sector and that sector is being disaffected by the microchip shortage issue. GNRC is indeed impacted by that issue but are continuing to ship generators without chips and will retrofit in the field when chips become available. Unfortunately for the investor, GNRC’s continued acquisitions and their unwillingness to provide distributions or share buybacks aren’t helping the cause. Wall Street subsequently views them a growth stock vs. the stereotypical industrial value stock. Jagdfeld has done little to nothing to dispel this belief.Unfortunately for my portfolio, GNRC is an overweight. As PPS continues its descent, I’m losing many thousands.Still in all I’ve continued to hold and, if I were more risk adverse, I’d be adding. Just won’t make that move as GNRC already over 15% my portfolio.I can’t stand that trite “Stay long and strong” quip but…… I am. "
"Oct. 21, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Generac Power Systems (NYSE: GNRC), a leading global designer and manufacturer of energy technology solutions and other power products, today celebrated the grand opening of its newest manufacturing, assembly, and distribution operation in Trenton, with a ceremony attended by South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, along with other state and local officials. The new Generac facility supports the increased national demand for home standby generators and associated energy technologies and serves as a strategically important distribution center for the Company in the southeastern part of the United States."
"Anyone watching the odd trading in the stock. The last three or four days we move up between 5% and 7% only to retrace it back every day to only being up a few cents on the day. The company had a very positive accounts receivable to payable ratio and paid down a lot of debt at that $18 a share offering in February this year when the bottom fell out of the stock. The accounts receivable payable ratio could be a nice indication that this company has a surprise profit in the quarter ending September 30th, 2021. Last quarter's earnings or loss was quite a bit better than last year's same quarter and revenues were up nicely too. A few more well targeted hurricanes and we could see some nice sales down the line. Also, Generac $GNRC has been on a buying spree with similar companies though many of them privately owned so it is tough to tell what their real value might be. $NEOV also has had a nice steady up move in this industry and is up about 225% over the past two years. While we are up too we have given up almost all of the spectacular gains from earlier in the year. Just checked on etrade and at least as of today it is showing approximately 12.3% of the shares shorted right now or about 1.4 million shares. The 10 day average volume on this stock is 146,000 shares going into today and 30 day average about 325,000 shares. Today we hit 625,000 shares with most shares traded at higher prices. We have had three nice days in a row of significant volume over the 10 day average the last three days. IMOH we tend to see large volume spikes more not under accumulation but more to build up the average daily trading volume of the shares for a couple weeks prior to big position short covering. Typically half the 30 day average volume and be short covered in a day. The 30 day average volume is 325,000 share so currently about 163,000 shares can be covered in a day more per day if the average volume increases. However, at today's level with about 1.4 million shares short we are sitting at an 8 days to cover ratio which translates to at least 163,000 shares being purchased daily or about a million dollars a day for at least 8 days until position is covered, if the price of the stock jumps then more than a million dollars a day. $AMC had the big run with only about one to two days to cover because volume is so high and $GME not much more. POLA has way less shares outstanding. I think the company might have a shot to make some money to to build real wealth for long term holder actually generating a return on corporate assets and building company book value. Company has fairly low debt and decent amount of cash on hand. I pretty nice gem when you consider how many times multiples a great majority of stocks are trading for. Owned early in the year for $4 sold around $6.50 before it launched. Now accumulating again from the $6.36 range down to the $5.36 range. Nice to be able to use some of the people's money who paid $18 a share in the offering. If you been holding a while maybe we get a nice break again by the end of the year we just have to root for some more hurricanes and get people to buy more portable power and off grid generation. Let's get this rocket ship going again. Not sure what the average short level is and what will trigger a short cover but we might be getting close to a couple triggers looking at the recent trading patterns. Good luck to the long players out there. Let's get the rocket ship to the moon."

"South Carolina Governor, Officials Celebrate Generac Trenton Facility OpeningGenerac officially opens new facility that will provide 750 new jobs in SC"
Need a big drop before ER …this is an incredible growth story
Generac is up 4.97% to 496.19
"The NASDAQ was down over 100 points this morning in early trading and it came rushing back along with GNRC. This is why you don’t “panic sell” a growth stock with excellent fundamentals and a veteran management team that’s focused on providing strong long term profitability. With institutional ownership of over 90% and a small float coupled with 2% short interest, GNRC is poised to generate an exceptional ROI for investors that stay the course."
Generac reached an all time high at 503.34
"Earnings should give this one a nice kick. As the globalists keep toying around with the power grid, people want generators! I'd say we pass 500 in less than six weeks."
"GNRC has surpassed my target sell in 2 of my trading accounts. I typically take profits at 100% gain. One acct at 114% and the other at 123%. Not even going to trim. P/E at 56 too.Sales and backlog continue to build. Not sure if their latest factories have come online…Well, despite zero yield, I’m gonna hold. This trend should run another 4 Q’s. Sometimes rules are made to be broken.Generac turning into an absolute behemoth."
