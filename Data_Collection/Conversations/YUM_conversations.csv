YUM is up 9.18% to 61.71
I feel this is a good buy today on the pullback. Earnings were great.
Does anyone see 90 bucks in a two weeks if the virus stabilizes
Not much interest on this board in this stock.
"well, the consensus forecast is one thing, right but ATR 1.5? ehh"
"Exceeding sales forecasts in Q4, no question about it. Bought at $ 99, looking for the $ 110 pop and then out. and these ae Pre-covid comparable numbers mind you."
Doesn’t this stock typically split 2:1 at this level?
"Price to sales waayyyy too high. This stock should be at $60.00. Taco Bell is trying too hard to get people to eat there, Pizza Hut is not growing, and KFC has major competition in the chicken sandwich wars, which Popeye's is winning. There are better places to park your money than HYUM stock."
"Is anyone concerned with the debt YUM is accumulating to repurchase stock. It seems like a typical business strategy these days to borrow money to repurchase stock. Just looking at long term investment, are EPS increasing or outstanding shares just decreasing and making it look like growth."
LARGE INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP SUGGESTS EXCELLENT CREDIBILITY I SEE MINIMIM OF ONE HANDRED AND TEN
"Cramer spoke on this stock today. Not like I give AF about what he says, but he noted 135-140$. Corroborates my thesis. Earnings should be good on this one assuming results aren’t adulterated by shortages. This stock has run up pre earnings…. We should see $125-127 I suspect. Any takers for $130 plus?"
More bullish on this over MCD? DPZ?
Yum Brands is down 10.10% to 70.54
"NewsYum Brands veteran and new CEO David Gibbs is wasting no time putting his stamp on the business.Actually, make that a grill mark.Gibbs — who officially took over from longtime Yum Brands (YUM) CEO Greg Creed on Jan. 1 — signed off on the $375 million acquisition today of The Habit Grill. The purchase price of $14 a share represents a 33% premium over Habit’s Jan. 3 closing price. Yum Brands said it will fund the transaction using cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under its credit facilities.Habit will join a portfolio of iconic Yum Brands fast-food businesses: Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken.Shares of Habit (HABT) — which were down 6% over the past year leading up to the deal news — surged 32% in early trading. Yum Brands shares fell slightly.“We’ve emerged from our three-year transformation stronger and in a better position to accelerate the growth of our existing brands and leverage our scale to unlock value from strategic acquisitions,” Gibbs said in a statement."
stores should be closed at least til end of May. stock price very over valued. wondering about the earnings reaction n april.
"The DEM wits in California I guess don't want anyone to eat yum products any more I guess. That going to hurt. That's all the pots smokers eat Taco, Bell KFC, Pizza Hut and the health food Oreo's. Good old DEM wits at their best."
looks like a good buy at these levels.
2 for 1 split time???
"you have to admit that pepsico has been very good to us, the yum spin off, and now the yumc spin off and pepsico stock price at a all time high. Doesn't get much better than this."
"Don't be fooled by the hiring need. It's not demand for their food, it's a lack of workers because of stimulus unemployment, and the fact that it's a stressful job for low pay. The restaurants will have to raise wages to attract and keep workers. Add the food supply inflation and next quarter's earnings for the fast food stocks will be bad. That is why Wall St. is pumping them, now."
Taking my profits here and will check back after earnings
"Where is the growth for the fast food and pizza chains? Outdoor, and some indoor dining is reopening, even in Southern California. The restaurants near me, are packed. I think people are crazy to dine out, but they have cabin fever, so are taking the risk. There is so much competition in the fast food space, how can all of them be showing 20% growth? I think they are playing games with their earnings. Plus, rising fuel and food costs will hit their bottom line in the next few quarters. There are better places to put your money."
"Yes, BACK TO THE RACES, LOOK FOR NICE GAINS BASE BUILT ACCUMULATION MET AND TIME TO RISE, again"
Yum Brands is down 6.08% to 76.05
Where is the bottom ? $80 or $70
who's the activist?
"The foot traffic has been increased significantly close by my rental properties. BTW, I am going to have Kentucky fried chicken for lunch later. =) cheers."
A drop of over $12 after hours? Really?? I don't see any news about this anywhere!
Something holding YUM BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HOWEVER WHEN THE TIME IS RIPE MUCH LIKE A COILED SPRING WE WILL SEE APPRECIATION
"Any company where a Millennial, once, walked by is soaring. Once the market returns to reasonable valuations, this will be $85. The problem for the shorts is that the market can stay irrational for a very long time."
Pizzza Hut new sponsor of NFL... bye bye Papa Johns :)
KFC should have never gotten rid of the double down. Made me stop going there when it wasn't.
"We Are At ALL TIME HIGHS (again). everyone investing long here is making money. Plus, keep those dividends rolling along too... cha ching."
Shallotte North Carolina is the perfect town to put a new habit restaurant lots of beach goers and vacationers visit this town all year long
the KFC popcorn chicken on Pizza Hut pizza is yum
YUM is up 7.77% to 81.22
This should work well with Candian canibus
"looking at his agin, the PE does seem high for the divy yield ratio, I dunno, would only buy around 66"
"$CMG upgraded their loyalty program to win a 2021 $TSLA Model 3 and other prizes. $MCD launched its first-ever loyalty program, joining $QSR Popeyes and $YUM Taco Bell to make consumers spend more and gain insights on consumer behavior. Another way to compete! Good for consumers!"
Oversold. Typical pattern. Will bounce back next few days.
Every since they started serving crickets and grass burgers it's been downhill for bk.
How will temporary shop closing affect earnings. Certainly will zap any momentum...appears like many challenges ahead...
Should focus on beyond meat options for less calories direction. If bunless options was good idea so is less calorie meat
YUM BUILDING A BASE
Yum Brands reached a 52 Week low at 84.25
I looked at the 2018 annual reports of YUM. The company sales went down 44% from 3.5 billion to 2billion. franchise revenue increased by 8%. EPS dropped 23% in the year 2016.Is that the reason why the stock is not going up?
In 2016 before Trump was election I bough Yum stock at $50.30 now it is over $90 so why would I vote for a socialist liberal democrat in 2020?
Time for a 4:1 split?
Yum Brands reached a 52 Week low at 75.45
what a great gain today on the Right path to high

Yum Brands is down 6.13% to 83.92
"YUM should benefit from the lower commodity prices, especially chicken, pork, grains, and dairy. sShould be a good Q"
"Gotta say I am impressed with interim President of Pizza-Hut, Kevin Hochman and Beyond Meat, they have come together to create a one of a kind Pizza, this just might be the best thing to happen in years which may bring back The Hut as a profitable business for YUM Brands and all of us as investors, sure hope so."

"If Chinese companies get de listed from American stock exchanges, will Yum be affected?"
has anyone had a pizza Hut pie lately? I bought three for a kids day and it was the worst pizza ever. the kids didn't eat it. I'll stick with locals rather than chains. not sure if it is cost cutting but I never had a pizza Hut pie that bad before.
"I love fast food stocks, but I like El pollo loco much better than KFC or Taco bell. Del taco more than Taco Bell. And I taste the best pizza at round table. But maybe the masses are looking for the absolute cheapest meal?"

"Taco Bell Nacho Fries, popular item is returning, however, this delicious treat is available for limited time and 14 locations will give this to customers (giveaways) while supply lasts............?........wow....targeting customers is : 1/ do not give them what's popular and if you really need to, just give it for free ? got it ? and we are close to new highs or dobble top ?????"

Why is this going up? They filed bankruptcy
Chicken will never go out of style
he'll how much lower is this going.....what's up
"Sit down restaurants , near me, are packed, packed, packed. Every day, even weeknights. The Covid fast food play is done, unless there is another lockdown. There is so much pressure on politicians, even Liberal Democrats, that, even with another outbreak, they will hesitate to close restaurants, and let the chips and deaths, fall where they may. The fast food restaurants are trading at historically high valuations, and can't maintain their current earnings without accounting tricks."
"Talked to the owner of the local cafe I frequent. I asked him if he was seeing inflation in the prices of his goods. He said prices on everything he buys has skyrocketed. Two months ago he paid $48 for a case of cheese, now it is almost $78. The plastic plugs for the coffee cups have tripled in prices. The restaurant stock earnings might be good this quarter, but the next will be bad."
"Finally saw a KFC commercial with George Can't Stand You. Its ok, no doubt they will get better.Hey YUM, why not hire his parents, Mr and MRS, to do a commercial together. it could be hilarious.I think Jerry would let them work in character ."

"Yup, pretty much all time high valuation. While first quarter earnings of fast food companies will be good, Inflation will kill their earnings in the second and third quarter."
All Time High (i think) is 119.72 Would like to push through that now-a-days.

Double top !!!! Nacho Fries Are Back !!!!!
are we at 85 ? OK maybe next week
"Taco Bell needs to hire new employees because their employee turnover is so high. Plus, as long as Congress is paying people to be unemployed, they are in no hurry to work. The higher cost of labor, and higher food prices will hurt the fast food stocks in the next 12 months."
YUM reached a new All Time High at 85.77
ONE HUNDRED VERY VERY SOON LOOK AT VOLUME
With Yum needing meat (beef and chicken) why have they not bought “Bynd” even up?
"KFC probably got a bump from releasing a chicken sandwich. Macdonald's had a short lived bump in traffic, but it didn't last. Popeyes still has the best chicken sandwich of the fast food chains. Food supply inflation will hurt all the food based stocks next quarter. Prices are skyrocketing."
YUM is up 6.65% to 74.29

Pizza hut is going down the drain. I would not own any Yum stock.
BIG RISE EXPECTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Thinking about getting take-out, but am still confused by expert opinions. If touching one's face is a potential risk, then why wouldn't eating virus-contaminated food carry a risk? Virus on the face is risky because one could touch the virus-laden face and then touch (1) the eye; (2) nose or (3) mouth, which is what the experts guide. The means of infection presumably is through contact of the virus with the membranes across any of the above. I understand that the virus will not likely survive the stomach acid which is one key reason experts give in concluding that transmission through ingesting contaminated food is unlikely. But, how does one deposit the food straight into the stomach without passage through the mouth? If a carrier (who may even be asymptomatic) coughs, sneezes, or even just speaks or breaths (a risk based on the latest research out today) over the food, and I ingest it, is there really no or minimal risk? Should people then not worry about touching their mouths with virus-contaminated hands?"
What’s goin on why tanking in AH?

"I last ordered carry out from pizza hut about a year ago. Pizza was OK, but I had to stop in and order, because ordering online didn't work. Here's why. It was the same deal they're offering now. $9.99 for a large with up to 3 toppings. I went through the ordering process. Classic crust, classic marinara sauce, pepperoni, sausage, & ham. Got to the checkout and it was $9.99 + $1.00 + tax. Clicked the button that said ‘what is this’ below the $1.00 & the pop-up window stated I must have ordered more than 3 toppings ?I thought that maybe the cheese was considered a topping, so I went back & deleted the pepperoni. Now I had the following. Large, classic crust, classic marinara sauce, with sausage & ham for the toppings.The additional $1.00 charge was still there. That was a year ago.Tonight I tried to order the same thing, & the results were the same.Gonna get me a Heggies Famous Six Pack Pizza insteadSo long Pizza Hut, it was fun while it lasted."

"Yum has coveted a burger brand since Tricon days. However, the portfolio created by Pepsi has never successfully acquired (or created) an entirely unrelated new brand...can you say in no particular order: A&W, Long John Silver’s, Hot n Now, Chevys, CPK, Fastinos, etc.? Be cautious."

Yum should look to make an investment in the cannibus snack food space. They might look at NGTF which is unique as a speciality snack food company that also is involved in cannibus infused products. I just took a position my self.

"Company took a beat down on Grubhub, BUT the purchase of Grubhub puts them on the tip of the spear in the food delivery business. I believe it shows the company is forward-looking. The future of fast food is tied to home delivery. There are few prominent names in this business (Grubhub, Door Dash, Ubereats). An advantage is had in that they can now leverage their delivery service to make their products preferable over other delivered food products."

BREAKDOWN IN YUM??????????????????? DISTRIBUTION OCCURRING WITH REGULARITY
"Somebody will probably three dot me, but just gotta say YUM is letting Mcd. take the lead in every which way possible. I hold several shares here which are not short, Yum was so good in the past, now it seems they`re just stuck in the mud, sliding here and there with no traction, been here since 2003 having been blessed with two stock splits in the past, sure wish management could bring those days here now."
"I am an ex-NASA engineer who last worked on the COBE mission.If you are a skeptic about UFO's the strongest evidence I can give you is provided below.While some are possibly ""black-ops"" military vehicles, there are mountains of evidence and eye witness UFO accounts including Presidents Reagan & Carter, Fife Symington the ex-governor of Arizona, several astronauts, the head of the Lockheed skunk works, pilots, over 400 U.S. government/military/intelligence officials have come forward, etc.The ex-Defense minister of Canada, Paul Hellyer, and astronaut Gordon Cooper have publicly stated that multiple alien species are visiting the earth, see links:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDGxq0Gzmj8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvPR8T1o3DcThese not just not confined to sightings by one person out in the middle of no-where at 3:00am, but there have been mass sightings in Belgium (13,000 reports), Arizona, O'Hare airport, by entire schools in Zimbabwe and Australia.Perhaps the strongest evidence came at a 2001 conference at the National Press club, where ex-military, NASA, FAA, and intelligence officials came forward to give their experiences.On Wednesday, May 9th, 2001, over twenty military, intelligence, government, corporate and scientific witnesses came forward at the National Press Club in Washington, DC to establish the reality of UFOs or extraterrestrial vehicles, extraterrestrial life forms, and resulting advanced energy and propulsion technologies. The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena. These individuals offered to give sworn testimony to Congress about their encounters, but Congress has refused to hear them. Instead for 60 years, the government has covered up and lied to the American people about the existence of UFOs.Here is a link to the press conference, please watch and pass on!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-iaV_XW9iE"

"$NCLH Norwegian Cruise Lines went public at $19 a share on January 18, 2013.

"* no position in YUM *I've tried to eat @ TB 4 times this week. Mankato Minnesota. I can understand long lines(drive-through only) but the line moves excruciatingly slow. That isn't an exaggeration. I figure that's the result of one of 2 things, or a combination of them.Too small of a staff.Too many staff members that either don't care, just poor employees, or simply haven't been trained well. I've had problems there in the past, but it was always something simple like not including the sauce I asked for. I learned to deal with that by looking in the bag before I moved away from the window. Never had a problem with the food itself.But I can't do anything about the incredibly slow service.Is this the same in other parts of the country ?"

Disclaimer: I am short Yum, but my $103 covered puts will probably get called away, today. The market looks like it's getting hot, again, and analysts lowered earnings guidance, is creating headlines of companies beating forecasts, even though earnings from most companies are down, year over year. Yum, might go to 107 range, next week. This market is really nutty, so I am taking a breather, and getting rid of most of my long, and short positions, today. GLTA"
I would not be surprised at all to soon hear that YUM is a potential buyout target as it was in late 2018 .
