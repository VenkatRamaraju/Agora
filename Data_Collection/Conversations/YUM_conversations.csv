"Cramer spoke on this stock today. Not like I give AF about what he says, but he noted 135-140$. Corroborates my thesis. Earnings should be good on this one assuming results aren’t adulterated by shortages. This stock has run up pre earnings…. We should see $125-127 I suspect. Any takers for $130 plus?"
I have been holding since 2005. any suggestions for me

I feel this is a good buy today on the pullback. Earnings were great.
What’s driving yum?
"NewsYum Brands veteran and new CEO David Gibbs is wasting no time putting his stamp on the business.Actually, make that a grill mark.Gibbs — who officially took over from longtime Yum Brands (YUM) CEO Greg Creed on Jan. 1 — signed off on the $375 million acquisition today of The Habit Grill. The purchase price of $14 a share represents a 33% premium over Habit’s Jan. 3 closing price. Yum Brands said it will fund the transaction using cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under its credit facilities.Habit will join a portfolio of iconic Yum Brands fast-food businesses: Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken.Shares of Habit (HABT) — which were down 6% over the past year leading up to the deal news — surged 32% in early trading. Yum Brands shares fell slightly.“We’ve emerged from our three-year transformation stronger and in a better position to accelerate the growth of our existing brands and leverage our scale to unlock value from strategic acquisitions,” Gibbs said in a statement."
"* no position in YUM *I've tried to eat @ TB 4 times this week. Mankato Minnesota. I can understand long lines(drive-through only) but the line moves excruciatingly slow. That isn't an exaggeration. I figure that's the result of one of 2 things, or a combination of them.Too small of a staff.Too many staff members that either don't care, just poor employees, or simply haven't been trained well. I've had problems there in the past, but it was always something simple like not including the sauce I asked for. I learned to deal with that by looking in the bag before I moved away from the window. Never had a problem with the food itself.But I can't do anything about the incredibly slow service.Is this the same in other parts of the country ?"
Im buying
"Gotta say I am impressed with interim President of Pizza-Hut, Kevin Hochman and Beyond Meat, they have come together to create a one of a kind Pizza, this just might be the best thing to happen in years which may bring back The Hut as a profitable business for YUM Brands and all of us as investors, sure hope so."
A drop of over $12 after hours? Really?? I don't see any news about this anywhere!
"I think it`s time to take some profit here, how does everybody else see it?"
"Taco Bell Nacho Fries, popular item is returning, however, this delicious treat is available for limited time and 14 locations will give this to customers (giveaways) while supply lasts............?........wow....targeting customers is : 1/ do not give them what's popular and if you really need to, just give it for free ? got it ? and we are close to new highs or dobble top ?????"
"Yum has coveted a burger brand since Tricon days. However, the portfolio created by Pepsi has never successfully acquired (or created) an entirely unrelated new brand...can you say in no particular order: A&W, Long John Silver’s, Hot n Now, Chevys, CPK, Fastinos, etc.? Be cautious."
HG residents w money to spend have left for England- 70% of the residents were qualified to leave. But you don’t hear that in the media much do you?
Pizza hut still delivering?Any company with the ability to deliver food still and not be closed should be good right.
What’s goin on why tanking in AH?
