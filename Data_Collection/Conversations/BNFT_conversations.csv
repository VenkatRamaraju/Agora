Is the bottom falling at BNFT? Management has no clue. Blood sucker company
"The recent drop is because this company is an absolute dumpster fire. They can't figure out how to implement the technology when they somehow get a rare win, they can't support it very well after go live, all of their top employees have left or are currently looking, management is incompetent and, most importantly, the ""technology"" itself is very old and clunky. Not ,much more advanced than one of those old timey monochrome CRT monitors. Slowly falling knife. Expect another dismal quarter imho."
