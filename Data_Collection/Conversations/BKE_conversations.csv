"This stock has been shorted quite a lot among other retailers. Last two sessions is probably related to coverage. Probably people have just thought this is another retail, let's short it. This company, however, has no debt and is very solid. I like the special div especially."
"Good stock, good company, bad economy!"
Does anyone have an opinion on why this stock price don't skyrocket after announcing a 62% increase in revenues??
"Guys I think this company has solid fundamentals!!! Even knowing sales are declining every year they yet managed to increase their cash on hand and decrease their debt year over year. If you equate their cash over debt then the shares are trading at $12.51 as of today, which is a p/e of 6. It has hit bottom a month ago and it already gained 19%!!! Institutional ownership is only 59% and some insiders have been buying. They have very little debt which means they can afford the 6% dividends - I am buying this tomorrow. The only question is when will sales stop declining? Any takers?"
Luv this company and managements ability to manage inventory and get great product out.
get on the bus for a total dividend of 1.55 in a couple of days
"It's nice to see this stock finally responding to better fundamentals. You never hear about this company being a great dividend play, but the company has paid a substantial special dividend every year for the past decade...total dividends declared in the last 10 years is $27.32. Analyst coverage is very low and they have regularly whiffed on earnings and revenue estimates for the past several quarters. Analyst estimates of 40-50 cents for Q2 (ending 7/2021) are way low and the company will likely report at least 85 cents. This company reports sales every month in a press release, so you would think the analysts could figure out the quarterly revenues, but they still miss by a lot."
Is anyone noticing amount of insider selling on this account happening ? Do they think that market is over-valuing them in their own eyes ?
Special divvy could now be 1-1.25 announced the beg of December......
"BKE earnings report on whole a disappointment. Earnings missed by -$.04 ($.42 instead of .046).Conference call also said BKE closed two more stores.Todayâ€™s share price drop of over 7% on high volume while broader market soars is a very negative indicator as it puts in question whether the annual special divvy will be declared or if so, reduced from former yers.I earlier predicted BKE price fall ranges and would not now be surprised to see $16 tested - especially if special dividend is trimmed or worse still is eliminated."
"With a large percentage of short interest, it would be nice for $BKE to be put on the REDDIT / MEME radar. Humm."
So under the radar.....Special divvy (.75-1/share) coming up soon.
Bought more on the dip today.
"in other words, my insurance is the E of 70-75 cents tb announced Mar9, coupled with the tax cut on standing E of $1.70 that goes to E of $2 in 2018 (tax cut 30 cents+), assumption the Q div gets raised to $1.10-$1.20 and specials will continue for total div of $2-$3/yr. Cash Cow +++. Womens denim kicks in (neg 15% goes to +0-10%) and all of a sudden serious growthie again. Seen at least three retailers pushing womens denim on Spring TV ads, it's about time. Yoga pants held on for the winter but time for: Die Yoga Pants! -- Denim is Timeless!!! (yes, I'm over weighted on BKE :-)"
"Does anyone know why Yahoo finance shows a 291.73M debt in statistics tab? BKE has no long term debt. The closest I can guess are the lease agreements. Is this what Yahoo finance is referring to?Also according to Yahoo finance, the company has $8 / share in cash. In the past, they have paid a huge portion of their available cash in special dividends (declared in Dec.) Since I have owned BKE the average yield has been near 10% annually! The management of this company are amazingly generous!"
Last year special dividend was declared 1 week after Nov same store release.....12/12 this year. This is a very methodical company that always has had a strong balance sheet.
Although very disappointing with the upcoming $2/share payout I will still leave my money in this pony. A lot of states where BKE operates have yet to see the trickle down of the new tax law. This will affect the base of BKE buyers as in 2018 they will have more to spend. Hopefully uptrend in SAS in the coming months. Still a pristine balance sheet.
"Why is BKE crashing with an earning beat of +20.93% ? Crazy, it makes no sense to me."
"Today looks better, go $BKE"
"Supply chain constraints, Covid resurgence, and a market priced to perfection are going to keep these quality retailers constrained in the near future. Same thing happening to Target, Ross, Walmart etc. Long term investors will be fine If you are day trading these companies, that's another story.. Hogs get slaughtered."
Special dividend announcement next week.
"sales for many months now and the dismal year ago neg 23%. Our comp is to Neg 23! We went + last SSS off neg 18 (yoy) so if we just hold the same relative level 23-18 = SSS +5%. That kiss analysis. Now we dont fully understand the neg 23 last year, so gotta hope that calendar event isn't there this year. (no evidence it is). So imo, SSS of +3-5% is coming. BUT what if there is some repeat of last year? Then we revert to the E of 70 cents + we're 95% sure is coming. And the tax cut for E of $2 in 2018. So low risk imo, multiple + scenarios."
I don't understand the ridiculous fluctuation of this stock. They are hitting it out of the park with revenues and it jumps up and down 20%+ within a 9 day span. I'm not sure what type of revenue a company needs to generate to get on an analysts radar but 1 analyst for a $1Billion company doesn't seem to jive.
"Great, ending 2017 at or near the high for the year. Here's what I expect (and why): New data, news reports that Xmas retail was great this year, up 5-6%. So the macro retail environment is healthy. The recent SSS at BKE have been running neg. 3-5, that off neg 15s in late 2016. So the level that supports neg 3-5 is established and now supported by ""great Xmas retail"". So expect the neg 3-5 to at least continue (established trend) into 2018 BUT the comps will be against the dismal neg 17-20s of early 2017. In other words SSS likely to go +++ early 2018 (feb-mar-april reports). Jan 4 for next SSS, iffy, my guess is neg 4 to zero SSS. BUT even if neg 4 the $2 special + reg is there until Jan 11 or so, big incentive to hold thru SSS (Jan 4) even if a neg 4 happens. Then hold on for +++ SSS in 2018. A buy at $25 is actually a buy at $23 with the divs. Is BKE worth $23? Lets see, ttm E stabilizing around $1.70, PE 13.5 is value-ish. And tax rate from 35 to 21 will be 30-40 cents E, at PE 13.5 get $4 to $5.40 of E. Semi done deal I say. Also, BKE being BKE, aint the 30-40 cents gonna go into a dividend, reg or special? My guess is it will, guess reg div goes to $1.25. Add it all up and I think we price for a 4% yield on a reg of $1.25 = $31.25. E will end up at $2+ on tax cuts, so PE 15ish, still value. AND SSS +++ is THE green light for retailers, so overshoot (past my FV guess of $30+) is possible, likely? To $35-$40-TBD??? Happy New Years!! JMHOs, GL to us all on this great old Denim Retailer!"
Forward PE of.... 7. Can we get a new multiple of 14? Is this going to double?
Where does this go to in the morning?
Loaded more in the low $39's. Looking at $55 soon. Thank you for the low share price Mr. Market Maker. ;-)
Any idea why the stock is up 4.21% in the AM?
"*The Buckle Reports Aug. Comps Up 42.7% Year Over Year, Net Sales Up 43% YoY To $111.6M- Benzinga"
"August sales were reported this morning and were up 43% over the same 4-week period in 2020 and 45% above 2019. The August period is typically 16% of the revenue for the last half of the fiscal year. If this trend holds true for FY21, we should expect revenues to come in about $693m for the for the 3rd/4th quarter, which would imply EPS of about $2.59, for an annual EPS of about $4.53. Based on that, BKE is currently trading at a PE of 8.8, which is awfully low for a company that is on a target to increase sales by 50% this year. I continue to believe that the risk/reward analysis favors the upside, and will continue to believe this until the monthly sales begin to tell me otherwise. I know BKE isn't a sexy meme or tech stock, but boy, this stock seems undervalued to me.I'll analyze again after the September sales are reported in the first week of October, but the company has historically reported Sept sales as about 2-3% below August, so we should be expecting about $105m."
does anyone think we will get another special divi in January?
Given the $2 payout is built into the share price. Should we expect the share price to go down by the same amount tomorrow or Friday?
"have owned this stock for almost 3 yrs, reinvest my div, and have bought more of BKE a few times since initial purchase. Over the past 3 yrs i am down 13%. The financials are good... No debt, able to comfortably cover div, plus special div in January. It seems like EPS are always going down yet this Co seems to keep afloat... Since Rev seem to be continually declining, my question is simple: What is management doing with their money to keep generating income? I have searched high and low, through all their SEC registered docs and other things. I'm wondering if they are investing in certain stocks or investments that are returning well or something? Does any one know anything? .... insiders hold over 40% of the shares, which is unusually high, and I think a good thing, i'm just a little befuddled as to what they are doing .....Thoughts or insights? Thx."
Raising target from 40 to 65 on this with strong buy rating !
Bought more at an avg $38.50 and have a order for more if $BKE goes lower :-)
I'm surprised this isn't rallying more with good same stores sales released today for July. You would think they would reissue the dividend soon. Hard to know when the best entry would be.
"Common sense on The Street shows that a shareholder loss of 131,963,200 equates to a sales short fall 4,522,000 (if BKE hit its June comps of 6.6% increase). That's why from year's of investment experience I learned you can't pay attention to the day to day manipulation that goes on. As a long term investor I look at the special dividend and the guaranteed one."
"Okey dokey, we are two days out from getting the BKE Q2 results. If we look at the forecast from the analysts, we see that the single analyst in Yahoo Finance is calling for $226m in revenues and 56 cents in EPS. If one looks at the Value Line, the analyst there is forecasting $255m/55 cents; his forecast for FY21 calls for $1.13b in revenues and $3.70 in EPS. The Thompson/Reuters report for the stock says that 3 analysts have a consensus forecast of 56 cents for Q2 earnings. Ok, now lets look at what we know. 1Q sales/earnings were 299m/$1.16. Since BKE reports their sales on a monthly basis, we already know that the 2Q revenues are 295m, so we already know that the two analysts I presented in the previous paragraph completely missed their revenue estimate. Based on an analysis of the relationship between quarterly sales and EPS going back to 2014 (the correlation is 91%), we should therefore expect that 2Q earnings will be at least 96 cents and likely in the $1.10-1.20 range, as BKE has increased their profitability over the past several quarters (likely due to the fact that online sales have increased from 12% pre-pandemic to 19-20% today) and has exceeded my forecast for EPS by at least 18 cents over each of the past four quarters. Therefore, it would not be unreasonable to expect 2Q to be in the $1.10-1.20 range. No matter what, they are going to blow the so-called analysts estimates completely out of the water. Regarding the FY forecast, we already know that BKE has reported 594m in revenues and the first six months of the FY typically make up 45% of the annual revenues. Based on that, we should expect annual revenues of $1.3b, which would imply an EPS of at least $4.80 and more likely in the range $5.00-5.50. By comparison, Value Line is calling for $3.70 and Yahoo $3.75.Who knows what this all means for the stock price, but the 10-year average high/low PE has been 15.6/9.2. Even at the low range of my EPS forecast for FY21 ($4.80), this would imply a projected stock price of $44.16-74.88, which means that the stock seems to have much more upside than downside risk.Dividends? BKE is currently paying $1.32 annually in regular dividends, which 3% at today's price. However, they have paid a special dividend EVERY YEAR since 2007, ranging from 75 cents/share (declared in 2015, paid in Jan 16) to $4.50/share in 2011, typically declared in early December and paid in January. This past year, the special dividend was $2. Since FY2021 is on target to be a record year, a hefty special dividend is likely forthcoming."

"Buckle needs to find a way out of the retail mall scene.. Lets face it retail has been getting slaughtered this Q. What will the China tariffs do to them going forward. I hope these important questions get answered during tomorrows call. They can have all the cash on hand they want, if they are not making new money or coming up with a new solution or platform to sell goods they are in slow motion liquidation."
