"Nice Valentines Day for BKE, why..... Saw report of weak retail BUT bright-spot was Apparel.If BKE just holds it's PE of 12.5, on probable $2 in 2018.... $25 + $2-$3 of dividends. Not bad!And it'll look more like growth (and will be if women's denim kicks in) the PE 15 on $2 + Dividends.TBD of course, but that is a realistic hope."
BKE is down -4.93% to 24.10

Overreaction as the key metric is same store sales for back to school. Mgmt seems to be on the right track as comp comparisons going forward should not be that difficult to beat.
"Good stock, good company, bad economy!"
"If one compares with overvalued shares like AEO or ANF, BKE should be $100 by now."
Since it has broken down below $15 I see it retesting that $14 range near term. Probably a good price to catch it before it heads back up to test $17
Overreaction . Company manages inventory and margins like few in the industry can.
BKE is down -5.08% to 24.30
EXPECT THIS TO CRASH CRASH BIG BIG TIME AFTER HOLDING DATE FOR DIVIDEND IS PASSED THAT ISWHYIT IS CRASHING NOW IT CRASHCRASHBELOW $17
"Today looks better, go $BKE"
Special dividend announcement most likely after the close today.
cover cover cover
does anyone think we will get another special divi in January?
"Okey dokey, we are two days out from getting the BKE Q2 results. If we look at the forecast from the analysts, we see that the single analyst in Yahoo Finance is calling for $226m in revenues and 56 cents in EPS. If one looks at the Value Line, the analyst there is forecasting $255m/55 cents; his forecast for FY21 calls for $1.13b in revenues and $3.70 in EPS. The Thompson/Reuters report for the stock says that 3 analysts have a consensus forecast of 56 cents for Q2 earnings. Ok, now lets look at what we know. 1Q sales/earnings were 299m/$1.16. Since BKE reports their sales on a monthly basis, we already know that the 2Q revenues are 295m, so we already know that the two analysts I presented in the previous paragraph completely missed their revenue estimate. Based on an analysis of the relationship between quarterly sales and EPS going back to 2014 (the correlation is 91%), we should therefore expect that 2Q earnings will be at least 96 cents and likely in the $1.10-1.20 range, as BKE has increased their profitability over the past several quarters (likely due to the fact that online sales have increased from 12% pre-pandemic to 19-20% today) and has exceeded my forecast for EPS by at least 18 cents over each of the past four quarters. Therefore, it would not be unreasonable to expect 2Q to be in the $1.10-1.20 range. No matter what, they are going to blow the so-called analysts estimates completely out of the water. Regarding the FY forecast, we already know that BKE has reported 594m in revenues and the first six months of the FY typically make up 45% of the annual revenues. Based on that, we should expect annual revenues of $1.3b, which would imply an EPS of at least $4.80 and more likely in the range $5.00-5.50. By comparison, Value Line is calling for $3.70 and Yahoo $3.75.Who knows what this all means for the stock price, but the 10-year average high/low PE has been 15.6/9.2. Even at the low range of my EPS forecast for FY21 ($4.80), this would imply a projected stock price of $44.16-74.88, which means that the stock seems to have much more upside than downside risk.Dividends? BKE is currently paying $1.32 annually in regular dividends, which 3% at today's price. However, they have paid a special dividend EVERY YEAR since 2007, ranging from 75 cents/share (declared in 2015, paid in Jan 16) to $4.50/share in 2011, typically declared in early December and paid in January. This past year, the special dividend was $2. Since FY2021 is on target to be a record year, a hefty special dividend is likely forthcoming."
Wasn't that bad of an earnings call. Buckle manages their balance sheet better than most and that is the key as the retail apocalypse is sped up as a result of the shutdown.
This co is finished
BKE is down -5.09% to 23.30
Loaded more in the low $39's. Looking at $55 soon. Thank you for the low share price Mr. Market Maker. ;-)
"This stock has been shorted quite a lot among other retailers. Last two sessions is probably related to coverage. Probably people have just thought this is another retail, let's short it. This company, however, has no debt and is very solid. I like the special div especially."
Here comes special dividend......
Forward PE of.... 7. Can we get a new multiple of 14? Is this going to double?
Given the $2 payout is built into the share price. Should we expect the share price to go down by the same amount tomorrow or Friday?
I'm surprised this isn't rallying more with good same stores sales released today for July. You would think they would reissue the dividend soon. Hard to know when the best entry would be.
I have always liked BKE and hope to get back into it once it corrects. But it was clear from the earnings call that the business is not growing and is still in a multi year regression in sales. You can only squeeze so much in trying to increase earnings when not growing the revenue pie.
BKE is up 6.64% to 22.50
"Hitting new highs daily. Expect to see some additional growth as the dividend date approaches, so still a good entry point now."
"Common sense on The Street shows that a shareholder loss of 131,963,200 equates to a sales short fall 4,522,000 (if BKE hit its June comps of 6.6% increase). That's why from year's of investment experience I learned you can't pay attention to the day to day manipulation that goes on. As a long term investor I look at the special dividend and the guaranteed one."
"Supply chain constraints, Covid resurgence, and a market priced to perfection are going to keep these quality retailers constrained in the near future. Same thing happening to Target, Ross, Walmart etc. Long term investors will be fine If you are day trading these companies, that's another story.. Hogs get slaughtered."
"5 week SSS again, so 2nd Thur in March??? (usually before open)"
The special divvy of $1.75 was announced 12/4/17.
"doesnt big money buying usually involve some ""process""? few hours, few days??"
Special divvy could now be 1-1.25 announced the beg of December......
BKE is down 6.08% to $19.31
"We are soon below $20 but I will wait until last years low, about $15. But things may be worse now?"
Does anyone have an opinion on why this stock price don't skyrocket after announcing a 62% increase in revenues??
BKE is up 5.58% to 29.35
"I am guessing that the big drop today may be due to uncertainty about Friday's earnings announcement. Down 6%!!! I am setting a buy order for market on open tomorrow. BKE still has a great Div, covered easily, No debt, and its ROA, ROE, are great. Still $0 debt. the market is just not correctly valuing this company. Now is a time to buy."
Check out my analysis on $BKEhttps://ericthomson.substack.com/p/the-buckle-inc-bke?r=fgeno&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy
Any idea why the stock is up 4.21% in the AM?
Earnings call was not negative. BKE is one of the best managed apparel retailers.
"Guys I think this company has solid fundamentals!!! Even knowing sales are declining every year they yet managed to increase their cash on hand and decrease their debt year over year. If you equate their cash over debt then the shares are trading at $12.51 as of today, which is a p/e of 6. It has hit bottom a month ago and it already gained 19%!!! Institutional ownership is only 59% and some insiders have been buying. They have very little debt which means they can afford the 6% dividends - I am buying this tomorrow. The only question is when will sales stop declining? Any takers?"
"Net Sales are UP: from $62.8 to $64 Million (so the E report, 10K/Q will be fine, so 70-75 cents, margins)Don't see how (store count down a few, no??) UP $1.2 Million gives us that sss.Alex, this another 5 week / 4 week confusion, or is the calendar shift a few days into March responsible?(improved sales show up in the next sss?)"
Astute traders are taking advantage of this pop above $19...shortaliciois
Luv this company and managements ability to manage inventory and get great product out.
"My biggest concern about earnings is tariffs. Just go on Ebay and search for their clothes, all the tags say ""made in china"". Thank you Trump for this, how does BKE price in an extra 25% cost???They dont, this will destroy any forward guidance....."
"Yeah a positive number. I'll take it as positive SSS going forward, with company maintaining margins, plus the regular and then special divvy make it attractive."
BKE reached a new 52 Week High at 29.65
Wrong on the comps. Hopefully better sales in Dec as inventory is higher than in the past 2 years.
"If BKE pays the same spec as last yr, the yield of $2.75/share gives an investor a 10.7% yield."
So under the radar.....Special divvy (.75-1/share) coming up soon.
This Company unlike The Gap manages its balance sheet well. Beats to same store sales should be more commonplace now as it seems the Company has turned the corner.
Dividend announcement deferred…
BKE is up 5.43% to 27.20
"BKE earnings report on whole a disappointment. Earnings missed by -$.04 ($.42 instead of .046).Conference call also said BKE closed two more stores.Today’s share price drop of over 7% on high volume while broader market soars is a very negative indicator as it puts in question whether the annual special divvy will be declared or if so, reduced from former yers.I earlier predicted BKE price fall ranges and would not now be surprised to see $16 tested - especially if special dividend is trimmed or worse still is eliminated."

"Buckle needs to find a way out of the retail mall scene.. Lets face it retail has been getting slaughtered this Q. What will the China tariffs do to them going forward. I hope these important questions get answered during tomorrows call. They can have all the cash on hand they want, if they are not making new money or coming up with a new solution or platform to sell goods they are in slow motion liquidation."
this stock looks like it doesnt have much upside compared to Stein Mart.
The big question is...what will the conference call bring?
BKE reached a new 52 Week High at 27.66
cmon SSS +++ !
See u at 15
When BKE will pay dividend.
"Great, ending 2017 at or near the high for the year. Here's what I expect (and why): New data, news reports that Xmas retail was great this year, up 5-6%. So the macro retail environment is healthy. The recent SSS at BKE have been running neg. 3-5, that off neg 15s in late 2016. So the level that supports neg 3-5 is established and now supported by ""great Xmas retail"". So expect the neg 3-5 to at least continue (established trend) into 2018 BUT the comps will be against the dismal neg 17-20s of early 2017. In other words SSS likely to go +++ early 2018 (feb-mar-april reports). Jan 4 for next SSS, iffy, my guess is neg 4 to zero SSS. BUT even if neg 4 the $2 special + reg is there until Jan 11 or so, big incentive to hold thru SSS (Jan 4) even if a neg 4 happens. Then hold on for +++ SSS in 2018. A buy at $25 is actually a buy at $23 with the divs. Is BKE worth $23? Lets see, ttm E stabilizing around $1.70, PE 13.5 is value-ish. And tax rate from 35 to 21 will be 30-40 cents E, at PE 13.5 get $4 to $5.40 of E. Semi done deal I say. Also, BKE being BKE, aint the 30-40 cents gonna go into a dividend, reg or special? My guess is it will, guess reg div goes to $1.25. Add it all up and I think we price for a 4% yield on a reg of $1.25 = $31.25. E will end up at $2+ on tax cuts, so PE 15ish, still value. AND SSS +++ is THE green light for retailers, so overshoot (past my FV guess of $30+) is possible, likely? To $35-$40-TBD??? Happy New Years!! JMHOs, GL to us all on this great old Denim Retailer!"

Serious question. Why is this stock fluctuating 5-10% every day? Who is moving this and making a ton of money off of this? It happens all the time even when there is no news.
dividend cut first
They come out of the pandemic with a 20% dividend raise ? Nice.
Bought more at an avg $38.50 and have a order for more if $BKE goes lower :-)
I have a few tips for potential investors.... 1. Go to Amazon and do some research on Hey Dude shoes. What do the reviews tell you? What do the top 10 best selling men's shoes tell you?2. Go to Google Search Trends - type in Hey Dude shoes. What does that graph tell you? 3. Check out their forward looking earnings.... Do you think $3.65 is possible this year? What is a PE of 18 on that?
With two more store closures in the last quarter I have my doubts whether November sales will compare well with last year - I hope I am wrong but it’s hard to fight the effects of gravity.If comparable sales are again negative (like the last 2-3 months sales comparisons) it would be a negative vector on share price. If BKE trims it’s annual special divvy it may be worse.It will be the worst case scenario if they suspend the special divvy. In that case we are looking at a share price drop range to $12-$16 or lower.

what was the date of the spec?
Back to school shopping should get this back in the 20's by the end of summer and a couple upgrades wouldn't hurt!!
it appears bulls are taking advantage over bke dividend predicting rally to 20 bucks by early may if it hits 20 i will take half loses in at 23.93 i do not see it reaching that just going back to 17 to 18 bucks this rally could be due to that article i found on marketwatch this makes sense to with dividend of bke these people could buy it before expiration date before exdividend price taking it close to 20 bucks right after they will sell most do not know if you own stock by exdividend date to can sell it after the date and still get dividend this appears to be case that some believe this stock will get to 20.00 if i remember correctly the call was to may 3rd but i believe by exdividend date this stock will hit that 20 bucks if indications are what they are these people could own stock at 17 and change so they simple buy the calls making price hit the 20.00 mark then sell the stock to collect dividend and to set 2 bucks in change in profit this could be strategy we will see if they are bought out day before exdividend taking it close to 20 because of negative sentiment stock at 4 loses i will most likely sell out of it if it hits 20 it most likely just keeps going downafter that i think the strategy for all those calls is to buy to collect dividend which will make price get to 20 buck mark but after that it most likely goes down back to 17 to 18 range with no real upside go to marketwatch.com look up bke and read article i am guessing thats what some people are doing ceo may buy more before dividend it means a little rally in bke that will not last long if it plays out where those call buyers feel its worth buying it for quick profit and collect dividend if it trends down they will not buy it let it expires hoping they get there wish taking it over 19 bucks giving them reason to buy out those calls they bought in may so i get some of myu huge loses back
Although very disappointing with the upcoming $2/share payout I will still leave my money in this pony. A lot of states where BKE operates have yet to see the trickle down of the new tax law. This will affect the base of BKE buyers as in 2018 they will have more to spend. Hopefully uptrend in SAS in the coming months. Still a pristine balance sheet.
Maybe shops should close for a few months every year. Seems to be a good time for rationalizing their business.
"BKE - As bearish as bearish can be! Chart tells 1k words, folks! Headed lowerhttp://schrts.co/LsjFQC"
Buying tomorrow's open price or lower. Should be able to gain 2% or more over next several days.
it will brankrupt as no shoppers
"""Buy Mystery - Sell History"" is alive and well. (until women's denim kicks in again, then buy-buy-hold will be operative, imo)"
"The value indicators say BUY, the growth indicators say SELL. Dead cat bounce?"
26% more revenue in this 5 week period compared to last year. Amazing.
"Curious why they announce earnings @ 6AM/7AM E, and don’t hold CC until 9/10E? Where is the guidance? What’s up? Something smells fishy."
Special dividend announcement next week.
"DOes BKE still pay a special div every year? They used to, but that was a long time ago. If so do you know how much it was? Would appreciate any feedback! Thanks!"
"in other words, my insurance is the E of 70-75 cents tb announced Mar9, coupled with the tax cut on standing E of $1.70 that goes to E of $2 in 2018 (tax cut 30 cents+), assumption the Q div gets raised to $1.10-$1.20 and specials will continue for total div of $2-$3/yr. Cash Cow +++. Womens denim kicks in (neg 15% goes to +0-10%) and all of a sudden serious growthie again. Seen at least three retailers pushing womens denim on Spring TV ads, it's about time. Yoga pants held on for the winter but time for: Die Yoga Pants! -- Denim is Timeless!!! (yes, I'm over weighted on BKE :-)"
pe 8 div 6 percent buyout coming to cheap
Raising target from 40 to 65 on this with strong buy rating !
BKE has had two double tops in the past few months with the second failing to beat the first. Not a good technical sign.
Funny thing about today is the stock lost x's more value than if the same store sales were up as much as last month. Go figure.....

Got to get those stores open. Go shopping people!
bought BKE along with LVS today... let’s see how it goes
GPS on the other hand is caught with inventory excess as they reduce shares o/s and number of stores. BKE mgmt strategically closes very few stores due to margin management. Good news is that they are coming off a bottom on women sales and I expect some positives on this front prior to Xmas. Have owned this stock off and on for over 15 years. Low basis + special divvy each year makes it difficult to sell.

"Looks like SSS on Thur (3-8) and then 10K/Q on Fri (3-9).Options, see a few bets and somebody would buy ""disaster insurance"" at 5 cents / sh, if anybody wanted to write puts at 15-18, 10 days out. No disaster in the card, got a hunch they'll beat the guess and last year and do 75 cents for the Q. SSS, let's guess 3-4% there."
"With a large percentage of short interest, it would be nice for $BKE to be put on the REDDIT / MEME radar. Humm."
"sales for many months now and the dismal year ago neg 23%. Our comp is to Neg 23! We went + last SSS off neg 18 (yoy) so if we just hold the same relative level 23-18 = SSS +5%. That kiss analysis. Now we dont fully understand the neg 23 last year, so gotta hope that calendar event isn't there this year. (no evidence it is). So imo, SSS of +3-5% is coming. BUT what if there is some repeat of last year? Then we revert to the E of 70 cents + we're 95% sure is coming. And the tax cut for E of $2 in 2018. So low risk imo, multiple + scenarios."
Apparels buying should be the trends as school coming back. I would buy into this and put big 10K buying in a smaller but just as great company LOTE. Its low now but watch it rebound
"neg 1 is fine by me, sales are stabilized, like AP says waiting for warming weather that will help women's denim, other. stabilized at neg 1 (and March was a tough comp, jan-feb were the easys off 2017) means forward E of $2 and continued Divs at the $2-$3 level are pretty much in the bag. Just need that neg 15% on women's to get fixed (fashion trend) and shares can head to 30s, even in recession? Beauty of BKE last R was its counter to economy move, hopeful that denim sales may correlate to weaker economy. n=1 sample so still tbd for n=2, always jmho and TBDs, but for me neg 1 is a buyop if anything."
get on the bus for a total dividend of 1.55 in a couple of days
10 bagger
Hold BKE if you have it but I’d wait before buying more. It has broken its last support levels and $16-18 looks to be the next support.This is a good company and even if you buy now it is a good value all things considered.
Next week special dividend. Could be between $1-1.50/share.
Still did good in a down economy. The markings of a good company with the right team to continue to be competitive in a tough market.
Bought more on the dip today.
Looking for positive Nov comps too in addition to the special dividend this week. Might surprise market...
Cut dividend next
"Why is BKE crashing with an earning beat of +20.93% ? Crazy, it makes no sense to me."
Is anyone noticing amount of insider selling on this account happening ? Do they think that market is over-valuing them in their own eyes ?
BKE May be the best managed from a purely margin based point of view but sales are still declining. This declivity has checked somewhat but BKE is fighting the negative momentum of its long term revenue erosion and the doubts that come with it.I think it will see the $18-$22 range unless it can report an increase in YOY sales for September
I don't understand the ridiculous fluctuation of this stock. They are hitting it out of the park with revenues and it jumps up and down 20%+ within a 9 day span. I'm not sure what type of revenue a company needs to generate to get on an analysts radar but 1 analyst for a $1Billion company doesn't seem to jive.
BKE breached any support it had at $20-$22.$18 is the next level down. The poor September sales comps are telling.
BKE is down -8.07% to 20.50
likely 80 percent drop in sales. Fixed rent and labor costs will still be there. Employee probably will avoid customers. Most shops probably will be shut down for 1 to 2 months and lost the high March break sales. Sales will tumble.
Ex dividend date is tomorrow on a $1 payout. Would it be wise to buy puts at the close and sell at the open?
I told this board 4 months ago that this is a good company. The “J”
"eye on the ball: OK, based on reported SSS we ""know"" (high confidence) we know Q4 will come in at 70 cents +. we also actually do know, that assuming established E holds around $1.70 (see last 3 Qs + 70 cents+ coming) we will be at E of $2+, as the new tax rate kicks in. A near certainty, that a year from now ttm E is $2ish. For $20 a share. With, in all probability an actual (quarterly + special) dividend yield of 10%. Whats not to like here?"
Prediction for tomorrow. Jan same store sales positive....guessing about 5%.
"They’ve got great rags! Top line jeans! Discounted by 23-30% of HE value. Nice shoe sets, and outstanding US store footprint."
"Just to refresh memories:Feb report (for Jan 2018) came in at SSS of +0.2 (that's off a neg 18% in 2017)March report coming is off a whopping neg 23% from Feb. 2017.March 10Q/K almost has to be 70 cents +, based on SSS numbers already in the can.That supports ongoing E of about $1.70 / sh, and gonna pick up 30 cents on tax-reform.So we are E $2 stuff for 2018, should get a div hike, and with the traditional specials $2-$3 of Divs.That kinda value can tolerate some i-rate angst and corrections, even a bear.Just Death-to-Yoga pants cmon Denim!"
"The stock was overbought leading up to the $28 price top, topping twice the last few months. It is now correcting. BKE did not open any new stores and ended closing one. There are concerns about future growth. It is a good equity with solid divvys but I would wait before buying. It is entirely plausible to see it correct to the $18 - $22 range it saw earlier this year."
BKE is down -6.21% to 20.40
I wonder about all the people who bought BKE to capture the $1.25 divvy that went ex today. BKE closed yesterday @ $20.45. But could have been bought at $17.20 x if indeed it does not go lower today. My math $20.45 minus $17.20 = $3.25. Looks like those who bought yesterday to capture the divvy took a $2/sh haircut for the privilege.Funny how BKE timed the ex divvy date to coincide with the December sales report. That fact scared me away from buying. I was happy to see I dodged the bullet when I read the sales report this morning.Losing 6.7% on December comparable net sales to those of 2017 makes me question whether BKE is truly making any headway against the now chronic decline in their sales and earnings. I was hoping to get back into this equity but it now seems like they have crossed the support line with earnings slipping below what is needed to maintain paying the divvy. Ouch!

"It's nice to see this stock finally responding to better fundamentals. You never hear about this company being a great dividend play, but the company has paid a substantial special dividend every year for the past decade...total dividends declared in the last 10 years is $27.32. Analyst coverage is very low and they have regularly whiffed on earnings and revenue estimates for the past several quarters. Analyst estimates of 40-50 cents for Q2 (ending 7/2021) are way low and the company will likely report at least 85 cents. This company reports sales every month in a press release, so you would think the analysts could figure out the quarterly revenues, but they still miss by a lot."

"Nice that ""buy mystery"" is working, BKE up the day before SSS, with Dow off about 200 right now. Here's the thing: We expect SSS +, maybe 3-4-5.... saw a guess for 7% (too optimistic imo). This SSS + guess is based on stable (and nicely profitable) sales for many months now"
Last year special dividend was declared 1 week after Nov same store release.....12/12 this year. This is a very methodical company that always has had a strong balance sheet.
BKE is up 6.34% to 22.23
nothing is wrong here except maybe this flag is a little longer. Solid little company.
"Does anyone know why Yahoo finance shows a 291.73M debt in statistics tab? BKE has no long term debt. The closest I can guess are the lease agreements. Is this what Yahoo finance is referring to?Also according to Yahoo finance, the company has $8 / share in cash. In the past, they have paid a huge portion of their available cash in special dividends (declared in Dec.) Since I have owned BKE the average yield has been near 10% annually! The management of this company are amazingly generous!"
"have owned this stock for almost 3 yrs, reinvest my div, and have bought more of BKE a few times since initial purchase. Over the past 3 yrs i am down 13%. The financials are good... No debt, able to comfortably cover div, plus special div in January. It seems like EPS are always going down yet this Co seems to keep afloat... Since Rev seem to be continually declining, my question is simple: What is management doing with their money to keep generating income? I have searched high and low, through all their SEC registered docs and other things. I'm wondering if they are investing in certain stocks or investments that are returning well or something? Does any one know anything? .... insiders hold over 40% of the shares, which is unusually high, and I think a good thing, i'm just a little befuddled as to what they are doing .....Thoughts or insights? Thx."
The Buckle is up 6.29% to 42.73
"online sales are up 5%, this is crucial is BKE is going to get back to growth. slight eps miss but revenue beat"
"As I suggested yesterday, today’s report on August sales seems to have been the reason for the recent drop in BKE share price that began with the ER. Yet again, continued shrinkage in this company’s revenues will depress the price well into the $18-$20 range. It saw $13 last year before the further regression in sales that has followed.It should rebound once it oversells but that may not be for a bit of time yet."
bought this AM ... sweet ...company has nice balance sheet ..has held up well . what is not to like
"August sales were reported this morning and were up 43% over the same 4-week period in 2020 and 45% above 2019. The August period is typically 16% of the revenue for the last half of the fiscal year. If this trend holds true for FY21, we should expect revenues to come in about $693m for the for the 3rd/4th quarter, which would imply EPS of about $2.59, for an annual EPS of about $4.53. Based on that, BKE is currently trading at a PE of 8.8, which is awfully low for a company that is on a target to increase sales by 50% this year. I continue to believe that the risk/reward analysis favors the upside, and will continue to believe this until the monthly sales begin to tell me otherwise. I know BKE isn't a sexy meme or tech stock, but boy, this stock seems undervalued to me.I'll analyze again after the September sales are reported in the first week of October, but the company has historically reported Sept sales as about 2-3% below August, so we should be expecting about $105m."
This should come down to negative. Report is bad
Shorting interest increases to 24.75% from 7% last week. Buy to cover for possible short squeeze price jack up.
"alex...dont think so, but any of the new (trumps) tax advantage (30-40 cents of E) in this great number? (80 cents+)"
"So we've had: 1)Several SSS reports showing the big declines have abated. 2)An E report, Q3, beating estimates at 41 cents, showing a stabilized very profitable business. 3) A near certainty of positive SSS in early 2018 due to comps off a dismal early 2017 4) Since E ""always"" scales Q to Q near certainty Q4 is 70 cents or more 5) A HUGE special + reg Dividend at $2 for holders into mid January. No wonder this thing just don't go down, rangey no 22-23 more or less until the next SSS in January. Then the great 10K in March. PS -- Tax reform will add about 40 cents / sh of E, watch for the reg div to go to $1.20-$1.25 on that added E. Price a $1.25 div at 3-4% yield to see what 2018 looks like. VALUE +++ , jmhos."
Buckle is up 9.17% to 17.15
