INGN -15% today? Any company specific news or something????
I read about acute shortages of oxygen in hospitals. I would think this company would benefit mightily from this.
"When the analysts release downgrades in the next couple of days, watch this sink down to $38 range."
Easy $72 tomorrow
Close your eyes and start shorting. Free money coming.
Great analysis. Inflection point is again coming. Nov. 5th or later ?https://seekingalpha.com/article/4300001-inogen-hold-breath-buy
I like the fact that in Hong Kong they have upheld the fine and censure against Andrew Left for mkt manipulation for shorting one of their stocks. The same should be done in this country.. this co put up a good q report.. it is down from $280.. what about that report or the future of this co deserves a $37 price decrease.. block should have to prove his assertions with facts prior to hjm and his buddies declaring them as facts. They have harmed this co and should be held accountable. This co has the leading devices in a growing mkt.. yet it is all bejng unwound.. why?
is INGN a buy? check Motley STOOL for meaningless opinion
NO worries...it will go lower in a few business days due to forced margin selling on Friday and Monday.Expect low 50's in a month or two as people will continue selling as there is no up side
It's going to be 120 by next week
Great thing is that they are growing by internally generated cash flow. No dilution while growing... $9 cash per share in the bank....
Must say article by Zachs is breathtaking. Company approaching 5yr low and they have it on their SELL list. I am sending them a nickel but they DESERVE a full dime!!
will this stock go back up to $60.. ?
"Read the quarterly report and here is how I interpret the comments:""Our earnings were 10% lower than expected because we have some lousy salespeople. In fact we fired 10% of them because they were lousy. If the rest of our salesforce does not continue to preform we will fire them too. We will keep on firing people until our goals are met. It is all our employees fault, not ours, that our earnings came in low. We did not hire replacements for the 10% we fired because they also might be lousy employees. Also, we did not get many applicants...not sure why.""Anyway, this is how the earnings report came across to me. I haven't googled it yet, but doubt that this company is in the top 100 places of where people want to work."

I dont really see anything wrong with this stock
Isn't anyone concerned about the drop in Inogen's stock price?
Ready to tank ..... lowered guidance !
Inogen has got some really great investor.. It is in upward trend.. Few days for folks to buy at low rate..
The guys running this should replace themselves and resign immediately. The shorts are now crushing this thing. The current mgnt is working fir the shorts. Bod should immediately replace ceo and upper mgnt
This company will be at $100 one month from now. Their oxygen is needed for almost all critical condition Coronavirus patients
This company is in freefall - amazing - from the top to the bottom..... I will short more here
Good long term company
muddy water crazy  if they think medical devices are decreasing. besides what about international sales?
Will Inogen respond or stay silent until earnings? I wouldn't mind them defending themselves here by issuing a statement.
"So, I remember when this traded at $35 and I unfortunately do not remember why I didn't purchase then. But I watched as it ascended to 287. Today I saw the drop and opened a small position at 152. And despite some of the comments on the board I'm cool with my purchase and I have another order for another 100 shares at a lower limit should Carnage reoccur. GLTA!"
"The Citron comic book ""report"" is basically like saying that Google is just a web site and there are lots of competing search engines and it looks really really I mean huuugely expensive. Oh golly run for the hills before we all die - I'm gaaasping for breath. I even make a funny with Glen Gary ha ha so clever by half. Mr Leff - try buying a razor and a pair of reading glasses and aim for the middle of toilet"
"Nothing is really wrong with Inogen. It is a fine company with good products and apparently a bright future of slow but continued growth. But it is still exceptionally overvalued based on PE and likely growth. The issue is that I don’t see a groundbreaking advance. The tech will get slightly better over time. The market will increase slowly over time. I would buy if it were below $50 for sure. If it were to go below $75, I would be doing some more in depth analysis."
Cnbc posted that he shorted it based upon inogen saying market size was 3.0 mil potential users vs his estimate of 1.3 potential
I often see ads now in the wanted section of craigslist by a reseller that wants to buy people's Inogen products.People are figuring out there is a shortage of personal oxygen devices.Someone knows there is a demand for portable oxygen units.
"After reading the hole report from murky waters, I'd say there are some real problems here"
"This is a mystery. In less than 6 month pps fell from 288 to 105, despite growth rates in the 20-30%+ range. Management does seem to have problems explaining and getting a handle on earnings/financials. The 64% 4Q earnings positive surprise, may have worked against short term PPS.So ... no debt, cash of $10 per share, an established medical product that directly effects continued and quality of life, growing like a weed in an expanding market space. Shorts may have had a good morning, but longer term this looks more like a 5 year minimum 2x and more likely 10x stock."

"The main problem with Inogen is that they never learned how to make their products in true mass production. While the Inogen oxygen concentrators are high quality and have exceptional reliability, in order to compete they need to have a price point at 25 percent of what they are at currently. They should have spent their capital on cost reduction in stead of introducing new models every couple of years. If they could produce a 3 pound unit that runs for 10 hours, delivers up to 4 liters per minute equivalent and costs under $500, they would rule the world. Instead, other players are close to meeting these requirements and are very close to taking Inogen’s entire market away. Oxygen concentrators are not anything special anymore. They are a commodity like sugar, with very little brand differentiation. Inogen’s price point is simply not competitive, and they need to cut their overhead and production costs dramatically if they want to survive."

"Theyre products are the best in the biz... with air quality getting worse, people aging and having more lung related issues, they will continue to be in demand"

Are people confusing this with IMGN which is down 20%?
"Why does a company that supplies O for medical reasons not thriving during a period when a virus that causes lung damage and often requires people to be on O? If the current CEO is unable to figure out how to take advantage of this, this company needs a new CEO."
In 2015 I Googled best share to buy. Answer was Inogen. Price was 40. I didn't buy it. Checked the price after three years because I remembered the name. Could have made a fortune.
"These guys are a pure play in the Covid response. They have the best product in the market. Recent delivery issues seems to be solved and corona virus is likely creating unprecedented demand for this type or product. Here's an article on some stockpiling. Also, according to the article, ONE nont-for profit purchased 2000 units and was asked to ship 500 to NYC (so state of NY is clearly aware of the Inogen products).https://keyt.com/news/santa-barbara-s-county/2020/03/05/infectious-disease-specialist-updates-direct-relief-on-covid-19-and-the-coronavirus/https://www.independent.com/2020/03/30/cottage-gets-nearly-200000-face-masks/Even after covid-19 is resolved (which will likely take many, many months), they should have a converted user base that is moving away from delivery of oxygen tanks (who wants the oxygen tank delivery guy in your house). Also, I believe the systems are now medicare reimbursed and they have customer service specialists to support the purchase.I believe these guys are going to have a complete blow-out quarter and updated forecast and take some revenge on the short sellers (aka a Tesla moment)…..Needless to say, I'm very bullish on Inogen for a long term play in consideration of covid-19!!"
"This company and product line has so much potential, they need a new CEO who really understands how to take this medical product to mass market. I think INGN will keep dropping back into low $20."
My only regret is not buying more

"An Inogen Oxygen unit costs over $2000. I am not sure if insurance companies cover it yet. Eventually the prices will fall, the units will be covered by the insurance companies and the stock price will explode."
just to make you long term holders feel great! I remember when this stock was at 35. Read the story about it's founding and made a note to myself. Then came the distraction. Forgot about it. Next time I looked at it...192.....sigh...Enjoy the ride..glta!
at least three analysts have upgraded this.. thats good news
"I love this stock, this price drop should make a huge buying opportunity, but how far will it drop. We are already down 60 points in a week with little volume. Wish management would weigh in !!"
Guess Andrew Left is taking it up the keister on Inogen.

SO! A short pans the company saying they have inflated their market size. SO why have they beat earnings by wide margins the last 4 quarters? Now their Q4 18 estimate is about the same as Q4 17. But what do I know - Block got his market numbers from the internet (CMS data). It doesn't add up on its face. What is Carson Block's record of market prediction / investor return?
"Valuation is currently based upon capturing as much market as possible, creating a dominant position that competitors can only weakly attack. You would have said the same, and I did, about AMZN in 1999. Revenue multiplier will fall over time, but share price will continue to go up."

"Tried to buy a product as a preventative measure (likely more useful than a handgun that people are buying) in these times. Issue is, you can't buy off the shelf, need a prescription, a significant consumer barrier."

Wonder why so many people do not believe Artificial Intelligence AI. The AI says it is going up.
"What's going on with the forecast earnings?2018 had Revenue of $358m and 2020 is forecast to be $517M. A 45% growth rate over the 2 years,2018 had EPS of $2.30 and 2020 is forecast to be $2.34. A 2% growth on 45% revenue growth! How is that possible?"
"Its most likely a screaming buy at this price. A p/e of 35 is cheap for a high growth co. They have the best product on the market. The reviews are great. The price is affordable. The sec should investigate this short seller for market manipulation. They choose cos whose shares are not widely held enough to hold up to their onslaught. It is clearly market manipulation. When you have widely held status, like shopify does, the shorts get burnt. There is alot of value in this co at its current price, imo"
"I think that long term, this is a solid company that will outperform the market. I am not in right now because P/E is still too high based on basic fundamentals calculation. Look up “how to value a stock” if you do not know how to do this. I would buy if it drops below roughly 50. Bento values it at 23.47, which is likely correct at present value, but I see some enhanced future value that he apparently does not."
The vaping epidemic will expand the addressable market for POCs for decades to come. Sad but true
"I don't own INGN. I see it's cratered the last month but hardly any news beyond lack of chips will impact sales of O2 machines. I know they make no money...yet, but sales are expected to drop. Anyone here have any insight? My take is to continue to watch this stock. I don't see it recovering in the near term. It may return to the $30's and revisit it's 52 week low. I would appreciate any comments."
2/3-3/4 of those effected by Delta have been vax'd. 60% of the vax'd show a +Dimes test 10 days after they get shot. In a 1-2 years many of the vax'd will require o2. Buy and hold.
ingn missed eps by .03 would you think the mgr would give up .03 in salaries or just stop issuing them shares.
Dead board. Decimated stock. You would never know that there is a respiratory pandemic running wild killing people from lack of oxygen. Plus several Docs are now reporting good results using oxygen supplementation (Inogen One!) before ventilation.

"I never even heard of this company, but just based on Left's track record, i usually like to take the opposite side of his trades. He is virtually always wrong, which has me interested researching and perhaps buying this stock."
"This stock is falling and falling fast. With an RSI that is getting close to being oversold, an MACD that is falling, Stochastic is plummeting, and this company missed their earnings expectations and are breaking their 50 week low, it's 100% to drop this and wait for the price to rebound from this big hit. DROP IT!"
nice.. its a start.. were only down $130 from the high though..
Something is wrong with this stock. Why the drop from $287 high to $91.00? Scary drop!!!
Nows the time to stock up on this. Buy. Buy. Buy.
How is a 300 million revenue company worth over 3 billion ???

"I think it has just dawned on someone that if folks with serious virus effects is in danger of dying from lung related impairment and ventilators are reportedly in short supply, it might be great to be able to just generate oxygen as needed."
Bagholders gasping for Oxygen.
"Left is wrong again. Nice try with a report full of half-truths and rhetorical slight of hand. Folks are lining up to pay cash for Inogen's POCs because they are vastly superior to the tank delivery model that medicare reimburses. Yes, the Wintergreen slide deck reference is regrettable, but do you throw away you Apple I-phone because of a facetime glitch? No, of course not. Oink Oink, the swine swindlers need to go to confession to their local priests"
It will be up to $80 plus soon.
"It's management selling shares ,we need new people in management positions.This stock should be $150 or sell the company."
"Classic case study here on how not to run your company once it goes public. Maybe it was the right decision to fire sales people, but replacement of top management should be the bigger priority.Someone will make a lot of money selling portable oxygen to the aging American population and the 3rd world. The likelihood that it won't be INGN just took another big ratchet up!"
staying at a hotel and watching the TV... saw commercials for INGN twice last night on TV Land and just now on CNBC
Games over shorties. Will move up like ZY tomorrow. Watch! Way too overreaction.
thumbs up if this is aSOOO tempting to purchase on the down trend?
"Just noticed that INGN was at 287 in year 2018, what happened at that time?"
"ProphetMo, and/or anyone else with an informed opinion, what do people feel are real problems with Inogen, either from the murky Waters report or from other sources? I'm watching this stock continue its drop with the intention to buy in at some point but I'm starting to hear things that point to possible corporate malfeasance. I'm not so worried about market projections but what should we know that may have been missed after somewhat cursory review of news and earnings report transcript? thanks."
what now?? Goes for off 4 to off 12 in a minute????
So I keep seeing ppl (older) with this device at dr office and grocery store. But I can see why there’s a market opportunity. This is 10x better than carrying the large oxygen tanks around. No other company is doing this. Profitable and growing. The run up to $290 was Unsustainable. If it drops further I’ll buy more.
"Remarkable control by the Market Makers! 5x volume before lunch time and 95%+ has traded between 68 and 72. Maybe the dam will break in the afternoon. At 70 the 2019 PE is right at 40. Growth has slowed (for the moment), but should still maintain 20%, giving a PEG of 2.0. A little on the rich side, but two ways growth can be accelerated. First is International, which has been doing well. Second is replacing the legacy (less than qualified) management group. Competent management could easily get this back on track to 50% yoy growth in the US markets. I give it 50-50 on whether we see 40 or 100 first!"
From $288 to $70.. they need to go
"The hard truth is: 02 is really important, and to rely on pure junk is reckless. I tested a $600 unit from China and it was gimmick compared to any of the major 4 in the market. Inogen is by far years ahead in RnD for the absolute best investment a person could make. I own a G2 and I'm about to upgrade to today's model of the G5 which cannot be beat in the market currently. Its rock solid assurance that 02 will be there for you. Save up to get the best."
"I finally sold today at just under $263. I bought 1000 shares in February 2016 at about $34 and tucked them away. At today's prices, I'm happy to get out. It's been a fantastic ride, but I've learned to take the money and run when the markets are irrational."

"Hong Kong Medical Workers Strike (2:16 p.m. HK)Hong Kong medical professionals began a five-day strike Monday after the government refused their demand to shut all entry points from China.More than a thousand medical workers had signed up to strike as of Monday morning, Winnie Yu, chairwoman of the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance, told reporters. Talks between the union and the Hospital Authority failed after the city’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam decided not to attend negotiations on Sunday, Radio Television Hong Kong reported, citing Yu.Deacons Yeung, the Hospital Authority’s Director of Cluster Services, said Monday that emergency services remained normal and authorities had activated a “major incident control center” to monitor the situation, according to RTHK. The impact on emergency services appeared limited on Monday.Virus Is Most Deadly in Hubei Province (12:45 p.m. HK)The number of official cases from the coronavirus is still highly concentrated in Hubei province. Of the 17,205 confirmed infections in mainland China so far, 65% are in Hubei, where the outbreak originated and where residents are in effective lockdown because of travel restrictions.The virus also appears to be more deadly in Hubei, accounting for 97% of the 361 total deaths reported in the country.The mortality rate is likely being magnified in Hubei because of the strains on the province’s health system. Hospitals and clinics are inundated with hundreds of severely ill patients, with overworked staff hampered by a shortage of testing kits.The situation suggests the true number of infections in Hubei may be even higher than what’s been officially reported. Other regions outside of Hubei, meanwhile, have an easier time monitoring a smaller number of patients.FLU STOCKS NLNK VIVO NBRVREG BIOTECHS LXRX IRWD SLDB HRTX FPRX ALLK TEVA SOLO TYME OTIC ASRT LCI PRVB PTLA ADRO DNLI WVE NEPT ATNM DOMO GOSS GWPH TORC PTI PSNL NLNK.

Like every business it need sales & sale growth. Then stock moves...
An authorized Inogen dealer I work with said that Inogen G4s and G5s are failing more than half of the time forcing them to return them to Inogen. Inogen sells these devices directly to the public and I have to assume Innogen is not doing the additional testing that the dealer is or they would be finding the defective POCs before shipping. The specific defect mentioned is the device not recognizing the battery when AC power is disconnected. I would imagine that if the dealer is telling the truth (I have it in writing) there will be a recall on Inogen devices.

"This co is in turnaround mode.. they got rid of the previous ceo who was not a techie.. this new one has been doing great things with product sales thru all channels.. unfortunately, these F in shorts know that this co is not widely followed so they sell at will.. way overdone, imo"
There is a way to reduce the amount of shorts.You pay a special dividend and the short holder must pay the dividend if he is still short.
INGN is one of the most successful companies on wall street . Potential growth in the future is unlimited since the number of elderly is growing at 5% a year and never stopping.

Execution is great. However they should sell it to bigger player.$60/70 is doable here.Gl!

I am making 2 predictions: Doctors will begin prescribing O2 for a massive demographic over 50 experiencing breathing issues due to recent global events. 02 will become legal soon for all pulse levels and 2 liters max for continuous flow. Inogen will offer lease to own with credible co-signer. And one year cannula replacements up to 52. Inogen will spearhead a campaign for clean air and O2 awereness for longevity. Long Full Dignified Life...InogenFinal prediction: Inogen hired me to get it done.
