INGN -15% today? Any company specific news or something????
An authorized Inogen dealer I work with said that Inogen G4s and G5s are failing more than half of the time forcing them to return them to Inogen. Inogen sells these devices directly to the public and I have to assume Innogen is not doing the additional testing that the dealer is or they would be finding the defective POCs before shipping. The specific defect mentioned is the device not recognizing the battery when AC power is disconnected. I would imagine that if the dealer is telling the truth (I have it in writing) there will be a recall on Inogen devices.
"Quarterly results are tomorrow - Tues, May 7th. Results will materially beat the Street estimates for both EPS and Revenue -- and Mgmt. is very prepared to crisply explain encouraging forward guidance (versus ""confusion"" created last Quarter) ... and the stock will powerfully move higher. Very confident."
"I don't own INGN. I see it's cratered the last month but hardly any news beyond lack of chips will impact sales of O2 machines. I know they make no money...yet, but sales are expected to drop. Anyone here have any insight? My take is to continue to watch this stock. I don't see it recovering in the near term. It may return to the $30's and revisit it's 52 week low. I would appreciate any comments."

In 2015 I Googled best share to buy. Answer was Inogen. Price was 40. I didn't buy it. Checked the price after three years because I remembered the name. Could have made a fortune.

I read about acute shortages of oxygen in hospitals. I would think this company would benefit mightily from this.
I'm debating if I should sell my shares of this stock.. and take the 3999 dollar loss.. I'll get back 2500.00.. there is fraud lawsuit against inogen...thoughts ....
Isn't anyone concerned about the drop in Inogen's stock price?
"So, I remember when this traded at $35 and I unfortunately do not remember why I didn't purchase then. But I watched as it ascended to 287. Today I saw the drop and opened a small position at 152. And despite some of the comments on the board I'm cool with my purchase and I have another order for another 100 shares at a lower limit should Carnage reoccur. GLTA!"
"why the drop in stock price today, especially after hours"
Amazing company. I love this stock.
This company will be at $100 one month from now. Their oxygen is needed for almost all critical condition Coronavirus patients
I often see ads now in the wanted section of craigslist by a reseller that wants to buy people's Inogen products.People are figuring out there is a shortage of personal oxygen devices.Someone knows there is a demand for portable oxygen units.
"Why does a company that supplies O for medical reasons not thriving during a period when a virus that causes lung damage and often requires people to be on O? If the current CEO is unable to figure out how to take advantage of this, this company needs a new CEO."
"How on Earth does this company make a smart app that doesn't even control the O2 level remotely? I mean come on....kind of a no brainer. I see $18 share price. OR make a unit that is whisper quite, or make a travel unit that is continuous flow? Inogen.....INNOVATE or just hire me as your CEO."
"Tried to buy a product as a preventative measure (likely more useful than a handgun that people are buying) in these times. Issue is, you can't buy off the shelf, need a prescription, a significant consumer barrier."
"What's going on with the forecast earnings?2018 had Revenue of $358m and 2020 is forecast to be $517M. A 45% growth rate over the 2 years,2018 had EPS of $2.30 and 2020 is forecast to be $2.34. A 2% growth on 45% revenue growth! How is that possible?"
"The hard truth is: 02 is really important, and to rely on pure junk is reckless. I tested a $600 unit from China and it was gimmick compared to any of the major 4 in the market. Inogen is by far years ahead in RnD for the absolute best investment a person could make. I own a G2 and I'm about to upgrade to today's model of the G5 which cannot be beat in the market currently. Its rock solid assurance that 02 will be there for you. Save up to get the best."
