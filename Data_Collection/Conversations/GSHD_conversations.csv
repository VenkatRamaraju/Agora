"What am I missing? As I read direct from the 10q, 6 months 2019 vs. 6 months 2020:Revenue up 18% (a little better if you use same accounting standard)Operating expenses up 42% (much faster growth than revenue)Net Income down 30%Income from operations down 37%Cash flow from operations down 64%Investing cash flow up 118%17 million negative equity.Special dividend of over 40 million which they had to borrow to pay. Once paid, negative equity will be over 50 million. I could go on and on with questions, but just this confuses me on why the increase in the stock price today?"

"Nothing new about this company. Went public (enriched insiders), somehow gets a billion dollar valuation on 14 million in revenue...total joke."
"There valuation is insane, even by tech standards. This turd should be in the mid to low teens....at best."
look at the #$%$ book value
I noticed this stock’s PE ratio and was wondering if anyone has any insight on the revenue growth. I saw in the earnings call revenue was up 50% but the actual numbers show revenue shrunk since last year.
$3B market cap?
"Geez, the insider selling is relentless. And still no insider buying. The CEO is out there pushing hedge fund managers to buy. At the same time management is selling hand over fist. This cannot end well for remaining bag holders."

"I have been involved in buying insurance agencies for over 25years. Times revenue which equates to 10-15 times EBITA. Depending on the operating margins of the agency.A large well run public insurance broker like AJGallagher is currently valued at a market cap of $22.6 B on revenues of 6.78B. This is 3.3 times revenue. Gallagher’s EBITA is 1.63B and the stock is trading at 13.87 times EBITA.Goosehead is also an insurance agency and I am puzzled why it is trading like a tech superstar. it’s market cap is $6.198 B. It is trading at 64.87 times revenue ( based on 95.42 in revenue). Goosehead EBITA is $14.78M and is trading at 418.8 times EBITA.Even if Goosehead doubles their revenue and EBITA next year, it looks like it is overvalued by 10x. Or more.Would appreciate any thoughts on how their valuation males sense and what I am missing."
"If GSHD doesn't have $50 million in revenue for the quarter and $0.50 per share in net income, the stock is going to tank below $20 per share. I just saw that $55.6 million worth of GSHD stock was dumped by insiders in the past 7 days. The insider selling has reach ludicrous mode. 103 sell orders and still no insider buys. It doesn't look good."

"Do investors know this company is a franchisor, not an insurance agent. Disgruntled franchisees, high churn, bad debts, cold calling pressure, overlapping territories, fine print 250 page Franchise Disclosure Document, signing away your book, lawsuits are the problems. Good insurance agents don't pay 50% for back office help - carriers do it for 2%. Brightway has the same MO. They hire last-stop agent on their way out, who will pay 30 grand up front and 50% for 2% worth of service."

"A load of bull on the conference call. You should listen for the comedic bluster value alone. ""EBITDA was down by $5 million, but there was an extraordinary expense of $0.3 million this year and another expense of $0.5 million."" They beat their chests on how they are innovative leaders and expect huge success. Nothing on the conference call was explained well. And their was little interest, only two callers asked a question. The one important bit is that they explained that due to their current cash-crunch, GSHD has eliminated the dividend as of today."

"Terrible results by Goosehead. Income was far dwarfed by dilution. The number of shares climbed significantly from 16.4 million shares to 18.9 million shares. That is an increase of 2.5 million shares. While the stock is around $100 per share, that is a dilution of $250 million dollars for the common shareholders per year. Terrible. And the company can only earn $0.17 per share. Did you get that? They are diluting shareholders by $250 million, yet the company is only bringing in $3.2 million per quarter. That is awful! This is why book value is down from -$31 million to now -$41.4 million, even while diluting shareholders. That book value is negative and more negative. The company is bankrupt (has more liabilities than total assets), the only way they are able to kick the bankruptcy can down the road is to dilute common shareholders more and issue more common shares. It is shocking how fast they are diluting common shareholders (by $250 million per year) and how fast management is dumping those shares (far faster, as they dump $500 million per year in GSHD shares). Beware."

"Why would GSHD be crashing?It is good to buy stocks where insider buying and insider selling are either close to matching or there is more insider buying than selling. So far this month GSHD has not had balanced insider buying a selling.There have be 0 buys by insiders and have been 72 sells by insiders (yes 72! and the month is not even over yet). GSHD has the most lopsided insider trading indicator of all. Insiders really have negative view of the future of GSHD! Insiders have sold $35 million worth of GSHD shares in Aug 2020 alone and bought ZERO.Beware, this is a management team who says glowing things and then quietly dumps huge numbers of shares hand over fist.The data:Buy/Sell__ File Date__ Symbol__ Insider__ ProceedsS 8/20/2020 GSHD Jones Robyn Mary Elizabeth $10,198.00 S 8/20/2020 GSHD Jones Robyn Mary Elizabeth $105,191.00 S 8/20/2020 GSHD Jones Robyn Mary Elizabeth $1,105,390.00 S 8/20/2020 GSHD Jones Robyn Mary Elizabeth $543,218.00 S 8/20/2020 GSHD Jones Robyn Mary Elizabeth $238,247.00 S 8/20/2020 GSHD Jones Robyn Mary Elizabeth $460,154.00 S 8/20/2020 GSHD Jones Robyn Mary Elizabeth $471,621.00 S 8/20/2020 GSHD Jones Robyn Mary Elizabeth $58,344.00 S 8/20/2020 GSHD Jones Mark E.

"Wow, those new financials stink. Revenue used to grow at over 50% per year. Now, the rate is slowing:Q2 2020 was $30.0 millionQ3 2020 was $32.0 millionQ4 2020 was $34.7 millionQ1 2021 was $31.2 millionQ2 2021 was $38.2 million.They are no longer growing at +50% per year. Now, the growth is slowing to only 27.6%. Wow, that was a sudden slowdown in growth and it is getting slower. No wonder the insiders have been selling hand over fist and not buying any shares. The income is not scaling. This company is in meltdown. Net income is less than half of what it was during the prior Q2. In Q2 2020 they had reported EPS of 19 cents per share. In Q2 of 2021 they now report only 7 cents per share. P/E is going up. Unfortunately, it is mainly because Earnings are going down so fast. Expenses are going up and they don't have things under control. The company is intrinsically worth a market cap of about $300 million. Since they have 40 million shares, that indicates it will likely be trading around $7.50 per share. GSHD is currently way overvalued for a company that can only earn $0.50 per share per year. They are in pain paying that hefty debt and the debt is growing. Interest rates will be climbing. I would not pay over $7.50 per share for GSHD."

"In presentations to analysts, GSHD management frequently highlights its lower expenses for customer service compared with other insurance brokers. At the same time GSHD pays its franchise salespeople 80% of first year commission and 50% of renewals. This commission rate is more than double the rate paid by other brokers which averages 38% new and 18% for renewals. Sales commission is the largest single expense for a broker and more than double the expense for service staff. Why does GSHD highlight its cost advantage for service expense but not draw the same attention to its expense disadvantage for sales expense?"

Lower and lower......their valuation is a joke.
"EPS announcement is coming after the market close today. Can GSHD justify a price per share over $14 per share? To justify a price per share of $14 with 36.7 million shares outstanding (that is a market cap of $514 million), GSHD needs to hit sales of $200 million per year. GSHD will need to announce that they brought in $40 million in revenue for the today's Q4 quarter and needs to show a net income of $0.40 in EPS the 4th quarter of 2020. Otherwise, the company cannot justify a share price of over $14 per share. If the company falls short of either of these for the Q4 2020 results, it will not be able to justify a price of $14.00 per share and could likely drop into single digit. This is extremely risky. That is a long way down from $160 per share to $80 per share to $40 per share to $20 per share, then to under $10 per share. Share price could easily cut its price in half 4 times this year!"
"The insiders continue to dilute the shares while claiming this is some new concept; it is not. To say nothing of the fact that the p/e ration is insanely high. So high that their revenue growth will not fill that gap, ever. I guess having a founder who worked for Bain, with ties to Wall Street paid off for the insiders. It will not pay off for investors as the economy slows."

"EPS announcement is coming tomorrow. Do you think GSHD can justify a market cap of $700 million? To do that, GSHD needs to hit sales of at least $44 million for the quarter (for P/(Annualized Sales) of 4) and GSHD needs to show a net income of $9 million $0.24 in EPS in this Q1 quarter of 2021. Otherwise, the company cannot justify a market cap of $700 million. Remember, a market cap of $700 million corresponds to a price per share of $700/37 which is a share price of $19 per share. If the company falls short of either of these projections for the Q1 2021 results, it will not be able to justify the price of $19 per share and is likely to fall far, far down from $105 per share, far down from $50 per share, far down from $30 per share, and likely down below $19 per share. GSHD has been extremely over-hyped and overpriced. Goosehead pps could easily drop to less than 1/5th of its current share price this year."

"Those were pizz poor numbers put up by GSHD for Q2. The revenue was a lot weaker than many people were hoping. They fell far short of the $50 million revenue for Q2. The couldn't even hit $40 million. They didn't even make it to $35 million. That was a disappointment. Yet the dilution to common shareholder continued strongly. There are 1.9 million more common shares this year. At $80 per share, that is equivalent to a cost of $157 million of dilution to common shareholders. That is a disappointment when there is only $3 million in net income for the quarter to common shareholders. These weak results show an overvalued company. We are going to see significant profit taking in GSHD after this weak quarterly result."

"Over the past 60 days, the mid point of estimates for GSHD was $0.15 per share. If GSHD doesn't beat this EPS (tomorrow Apr 30th), GSDH will fall hard... perhaps even into the sub $30 per share range. This will be interesting."

"I did an intrinsic free-cash-flow valuation of GSHD. Revenue is around $110 million per year and may be able to keep growing at 20% annual rate every year for 10 years. It is unlikely to be that high over the 10y period for their business and challenges of competition but for the sake of optimism, I'll assume they could grow 20% each year. I can compute the impact of taxes and investment and compute working capital and changes based on a net operating profit at a strong 10% of total revenue, which they haven’t demonstrated, but for the sake of optimism, I’ll assume they can scale and have 10% net operating profit. Then I can calculate free cash flow and discounted FCFF. This leads to a DFCFF of $81 million over the 10 year period and leads to a value for the subsequent period of $484 million. They have short term assets of $40 million and liabilities of $170 million. All these add up to $411 million total value of GSHD overall. Preferred shares are converting into common shares. They are a combined 38 million shares. Dividing the total company intrinsic value by the number of shares leads to GSHD having a total projected intrinsic value $10.82 per share. The company GSHD is currently overvalued by 1400%."

"Things are looking bad for GSHD shareholders. Price is going to head toward 5 times sales. That is still a very high multiple, but balance sheet is heading negative and sale growth is slowing for the company. If sales are $200 million per year, then appropriate market cap will be $1.0 billion. This means that GSHD has to get to $50 million per quarter in revenue. Then the company can justify the valuation of $1 billion, but there are 36 million shares owned of GSHD. Let’s hope they can get to $50 million revenue for the quarter, they would still have pretty poor fundamentals at that level (a low bar in revenues), but GSHD may not get there this quarter. Estimated earnings date is July 30th.The bigger problem is that stock price is already $80 per share. With over 36 million A+B shares, the market is already far overvaluing the business, even though they may not hit $50 million in quarterly revenue for Q2 of 2020. If they can hit $50 million, it might be reasonable for the PPS to go to $1 billion market cap / 36 million shares, which equals a GSHD stock price of $27 per share. If they fall short of the $50 million in revenue for Q2, we could see the company unable to maintain the hefty P/S of 5, and instead see the company may go to P/S=3. That would put the valuation at $16 per share, which would still be a pretty lofty valuation for the company. The P/S multiple is going to compress, it is just a question of how fast and by how much. This may be why insiders are selling so much stock and so rapidly. Enjoy!"

"When management reports earnings on Tuesday, it will be interesting to see if they give any earnings guidance and how contingent income may impact EBITDA IN 2021. Through 9 months of 2020, contingent income was approximately 45% of “adjusted EBITDA.” This included a $4,000,000 positive impact from ASC 606. Considering GSHD’s concentration in homeowners insurance and Texas, it would seem the recent winter storms could significantly reduce 2021 contingent income. Between lower contingent commissions as a result of higher claims and a normalized reporting following the conversion to ASC606, a 25% impact on EBITDA seems possible."

"Wow, $96 million in liabilities and only $27 million in current assets. GSHD is top heavy with liabilities and soon to topple over. They depend on growth, but unfortunately, net income has shrunk during the most recent 4 quarters. And the upcoming quarterly is going to be far worse.Costs for recovering receivables are going up and the ability to collect is dropping fast. The more accurate accounting for the timing of expenses clearly makes the income and balance sheets far worse. Previous statements had misled investors, and this now serves as the death knell for Goosehead common shareholders.Goosehead’s revenue comes from signing up new insurance contracts with existing carriers like Allstate, Goosehead itself doesn’t benefit at all if the rate of claims goes down. GSHD only benefits if more people sign up through GSHD sales people. Basically, Goosehead has no insurance business of its own, just salereps begging around for people to sign up for insurance and taking a commission. This coronavirus situation is truly a terrible situation for Goosehead shareholders, most shareholders just down realize it yet.Cash is running down. The Goosehead B shares will continually dilute the GSHD common Class A shares.Most scary of all is Goosehead is highly leveraged. In the past year, they have gone debt crazy with a 3.5X leverage ratio. The company has aggressively taken a large amount of debt with a whopping balloon payment required. The term note is collateralized by substantially all the Company’s assets, which includes rights to future commissions. I feel sorry for the common shareholders and for the creditor as this huge debt is not likely to be fully paid by the shrinking Goosehead.Read the risks in the 10K. “Factors, such as business revenue, economic conditions, the volatility and strength of the capital markets can affect the business and economic environment. The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of household income increases and generally falls as household income decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our business. Bad indeed for GSHD. Leverage is a killer at this time."

GSHD is down 8.28% to $33.02
"Wow, GSHD a company that depends on strong growth was already actually shrinking before most of the coronavirus impact even started. They needed to grow to $36.7 million in revenue for Q1 2020 in order to maintain their prior growth rate. But the company just came in somewhere around $24 million in revenue for Q1. GSHD is now falling 33% short from the expected growth rate! Wow. Core revenues are way short. Total revenues are way short. Just a little over a month ago, GSHD was projected to get adjusted EPS of 27 cents per share. Instead they are 0 cents per share. The cannot even earn a profit. This is a terrible negative surprise for GSHD common shareholders.This will probably drop below $30 per share. Cash is running out. Likely there will be support for GSHD not to go below book value. Currently, total assets are $76 million, and total liabilities are $106 million. So book value is -$30 million. The stock of GSHD is unlikely to go below -$30 million / 16 million. It is unlikely to go below -$2 per share."

Excellent volume the last few days. The stock has started to drop. Some think it might find support at $30 per share. But the overwhelming debt and slowdown in growth is probably going to drive GSHD much lower. It may find some support in the $8 to $10 range. Pumping has being going on for over a year. Dumping has just begun. Who were those dopes who bought over $160 per share?

"CEO Interview: quite interesting:""I was a long-time partner at Bain & Company, and my wife and I had built a real estate investment portfolio that she was managing, and she literally couldn’t find a decent insurance agent. So she kind of threw up her hands and said, “I’m starting my own insurance agency.”You need a little bit of background context on Robyn. We have six kids, and I spent 14 years at Bain & Company, most of which I was on the road, and so she was a single parent to six kids. And when she decides she’s going to do something, the very best course of action is just get the hell out of her way because she’s going to do it.""https://www.twst.com/interview/interview-with-the-co-founder-chairman-ceo-goosehead-insurance-inc-nasdaqgshd"
