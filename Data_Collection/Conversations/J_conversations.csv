"Great beat on Earnings, Revenue, and positive guidance! Looking for a big pop up from this baby, to the $100/shr level, once the regular market session begins. Long 300 shares at $93.20, so this is shaping up tp be a very nice day!"
What was the fall January 1
So J just bought TBG (The Buffalo Group). So where does the market go with this?
I'm happy to see the confidence is back in JEC ... just a guess but I wouldn't be surprised to see new highs after next earnings... any other opinions out there?

This has been a good stock for me. Just slow and steady. I work in the industry and see the moves they make are sensible. Somebody in management makes good decisions.

Go on over to STRL (Sterling Construction). They are one of 4 border wall companies and the only one that's publicly traded.
The sale of non-essential divisions will help Jacobs focus on some exciting opportunities.
"OK, we have the dividend increase and now they should think about a 3 for 1 stock split fairly soon."
still more upside here next earnings will be good

What's wrong with Yahoo's charts on this one? says the 52-week low was .27!
made some nice money on this in the last two days. Got out because I believe that the infrastructure bill vote will be delayed while legislators try to pass other priorities.
HUGE potential... waiting for new coverage ... earnings increase is a GOOD thing Revenues themselves are nothing
what happened to the Competitors tab on yahoo finance?

"Of the following, which is the best investment: Jacobs Engineering (JEC), AECOM (ACM), Fluor (FLR), KBR Inc (KBR), TechnipFMC (FTI), Quanta Services (PWR)?"
"I am surprised the stock price is holding at this level. Many former CH2M employees are selling the JEC they acquired from the acquisition by JEC. In fact, Fidelity says that my shares haven't cleared yet (after a week) because so many shares are being traded (which doesn't seem right to me - in a supposed open market)"

"It looks like everyone is disappointed about the result in the stock price, well I am...."
Jacobs Engineering and Fluor Corp should do very well under Biden's Infrastructure Plan.
J should be thinking of a 3 for 1 stock split or increase the dividend.
J is probably picking up a lot of business from the failing FLR.

"Looking for a significant move up in stock price today, probably building throughout the entire market session. Earnings, revenue, and guidance all are positive, they reported Earnings today and beat the consensus estimates with ease. On top of that, lots of breaking news from them today, all of it positive, and the CEO will be interviewed live on CNBC this morning. I'm in at $93.20, played her for earnings on Friday, and am now expecting a move above $100/shr, perhaps closer to $105, easily breaking through to a new 52 week high. Stock is already at $97+ on very low volume here in the early pre-market. Everything looks good for a very good day for anyone holding JEC!"
