Jacobs Engineering is up 4.92% to 112.43
J should be thinking of a 3 for 1 stock split or increase the dividend.
This has been a good stock for me. Just slow and steady. I work in the industry and see the moves they make are sensible. Somebody in management makes good decisions.
Here is J down because the infrastructure bill is in jeopardy
"OK, we have the dividend increase and now they should think about a 3 for 1 stock split fairly soon."
JEC is up 4.99% to 70.44
JEC reached a new 52 Week High at $82.24
J reached a 52 Week high at 99.14
"Big win for JEC today as they secured 1 contract from NASA worth $137.5 Million, after extensions on the contract it could be worth over $800 million over the course of the next year. Source: Seeking Alpha"
JEC is down -5.29% to 59.81
made some nice money on this in the last two days. Got out because I believe that the infrastructure bill vote will be delayed while legislators try to pass other priorities.
"Looking for a significant move up in stock price today, probably building throughout the entire market session. Earnings, revenue, and guidance all are positive, they reported Earnings today and beat the consensus estimates with ease. On top of that, lots of breaking news from them today, all of it positive, and the CEO will be interviewed live on CNBC this morning. I'm in at $93.20, played her for earnings on Friday, and am now expecting a move above $100/shr, perhaps closer to $105, easily breaking through to a new 52 week high. Stock is already at $97+ on very low volume here in the early pre-market. Everything looks good for a very good day for anyone holding JEC!"
JEC is down -100.00% to 0.00

Why has this solid performer been so badly beaten up? Very curious.
"Do not take investment advise from this guy below. Maybe use as a contrarian signal.Broti28 days ago200 more shares at 16.70 of mj.120 more shares of blue apron at 3.98.That’s it I’m done for a few, gonna watch the market for a week or so holding UBER also."
This is a great infrastructure bill play.
what happened to the Competitors tab on yahoo finance?
I'm happy to see the confidence is back in JEC ... just a guess but I wouldn't be surprised to see new highs after next earnings... any other opinions out there?
HUGE potential... waiting for new coverage ... earnings increase is a GOOD thing Revenues themselves are nothing
"Will Jacobs please buy FLR, get rid of the incompetent deadwood, and consolidate all of the back office functions? FLR is one of the weakest competitors holding down prices for the industry, and is currently trading at a significant discount. Capital is cheap, and there is plenty of it sloshing around in the marketplace. The time to strike is now while FLR is vulnerable, is trying to regain trust in the marketplace, and the stock is trading at a significant discount."
Looking for breakout at $56.89 with a short term target of $70.84. The buy rating at 9trading: 7.5.
"Considering the mass of contracts held by JEC, thought they would do better."
Shooting up strongly today
"Of the following, which is the best investment: Jacobs Engineering (JEC), AECOM (ACM), Fluor (FLR), KBR Inc (KBR), TechnipFMC (FTI), Quanta Services (PWR)?"
JEC is up 5.70% to 59.94
JEC reached a new 52 Week High at 72.92
JEC reached a new 52 Week High at $79.11
Jacobs Engineering and Fluor Corp should do very well under Biden's Infrastructure Plan.
"I am surprised the stock price is holding at this level. Many former CH2M employees are selling the JEC they acquired from the acquisition by JEC. In fact, Fidelity says that my shares haven't cleared yet (after a week) because so many shares are being traded (which doesn't seem right to me - in a supposed open market)"
"No posts here, since ticker symbol change JEC to J. This stock keeps climbing. If the growth economy continues, this ready to go higher."
Great buying opportunity here at 87.75! Going higher!
The sale of non-essential divisions will help Jacobs focus on some exciting opportunities.
"Great beat on Earnings, Revenue, and positive guidance! Looking for a big pop up from this baby, to the $100/shr level, once the regular market session begins. Long 300 shares at $93.20, so this is shaping up tp be a very nice day!"
"What's the best/ good stock for the anticipated ""infrastructure"" bill: J, ACM, FLR or KBR? They all fit the bill, but ACM seems to to be leading IMHO. Thoughts?"
Jacobs Engineering reached an all time high at 112.30
still more upside here next earnings will be good
What's wrong with Yahoo's charts on this one? says the 52-week low was .27!
JEC reached a new 52 Week High at 71.63
why the stock dropped $4.44 ins spite of good earnings and projection?Gabe
