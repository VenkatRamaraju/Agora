HSIC named the fastest covid-19 test company.
What’s the symbol for the new spinoff for Vets First Corp?
"Even Cramer seemed unconvinced. At the end of the interview with CEO today heard him say ""pass"""
Ive been here for a bit and just wanted to let people know about $HSIC seems like it isnt getting much attention yet and has similar news to AYTU
"Today's drop is the computer picking up key words like ""guidance"" and reacting. Nonsense. Use any weakness to add to positions as humans will prevail. The spin off is significant and animal health can have a 30pE."
"Seems like the SP should be moving higher, back into the $80's as the financials improve with with debt retirement and company expansion ventures benefit the bottom line. I have heard profit sharing was recently reinstated. Don't see any headwinds, sure wish more small investors saw us as worthy of investment."
Henry Schein mainly functions as a distributor with a small manufactoring capability. The comments of the manufacturing of millions of tests and ventilators is misleading about the HSIC capability. Cramer gives HSIC a pass.
This is one of the Cheapest Growth Stocks there is. P/E of only 16. I see long term upside .
Reported good earnings and no lowering of 2020 guidance. Stock is selling below a market multiple with higher growth rate and much better metrics.
"65 in 2 days, there is nothing wrong, it leads the world in there dental business, NO COMPETITORS"
Seems like HSIC should be getting a lot of coverage this week as the back to work test.
They make face masks and other protective gear and also over 6 models of ventilators. HSIC can ramp production fairly easily. Demand will last for a few years as stockpiles will be permanently at 1 million in the U.S. and 5 million worldwide.
Fidelity analysts providers have a 9.4 buy rating on this stock.
Someone please explain what this spin means.Did I just lost 25%?
Lot lot of money to be made God Bless All
This is another Cramer special. He parades the CEO on quarterly and tells everyone this is a great company. I only bought a few shares but still managed to lose over $500. So much for Cramer.
anyone have any info on why the drop past two days???
"I saw only positives in conference call, particularly the emphasis that the eps guidance was meant only to be a floor."
This should be a CV play!
"Uhm... Did anyone happen to notice that they can get out 3/4 of a million COVID-19 tests by end of month (and more for April)? AND, the test results only take about 15 minutes. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/henry-schein-announces-availability-coronavirus-121500079.html"
"Profit taking today? It looks to me that someone is trading based on Bollinger Bands. But for the life of me, I don't see that much volume today to bring HSIC down more than 2%. I guess buyers are watching for the buy opportunities. Should make for a good time to add to one's position."
HSIC will spin off its animal products division soon. It should have a pretty high valuation as compared to other similiar spinoffs. Giddyup!
Spin off into Vets First Choice will result in 20x PE as vet market is growing at 7%. We will get shares in Vets. Tax free spinoff. Resulting HSIC will be growing around 10% according to Mgt. HSIC may be acquired at that point. BUY!
"The moved/reallocated people/money to their spin off animal products today. so that's why it fell over 20%, but people don't know whats happening so they just see a 25% drop and start panic selling."
Anyone looking for $40.00/sh?
"Amazon death star my #$%$! ! ! They said Costco, Walgreens, Walmart, Target, etc were all going to be run out of business but they are all higher now then when that statement was made. These analysts drive people out of the stocks so their friends can buy it back at 2-3 year lows. WHAT A RIGGED WALL STREET GAME! ! !"
The last time I was in a Dental office it was like a used car high pressure sales setting selling all sorts of unneeded procedures. It looks like this is the future of Dentistry and the Dental industry.
HSIC getting some CNBC coverage with CEO.
Buying opportunity?
I keep adding more shares to my IRA on dips like we're having today. When we get stability in the US political scene and this pandemic starts to fade with a vaccine on the horizon. Henry Schein will cut through the 52 week high and do very well. Especially since people have been neglecting their dental issues for months now. The backlog for a dental appointment will be astronomical and the need for supplies will be great.
"This article has to be about HSIC, mentions 15 min test and fingerprick. This is huge news, back up the truck!https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-mass-home-testing-to-be-made-available-within-days"
"Due to pentup demand HSIC will come roaringback when virus is contained, and also in process of being contained by distributing products neccessary to containit"
Tests are cheap! Don’t expect a bounce from them. Their core business is going down hill fast.
Is Schein a manufacturer of dental products? Or merely a distributor?
"Schein should be in great position after Bidens latest speech mandating many more vaccinations, together with the flu lpl"
I haven't followed Schein since Xmas and was shocked to see approx. 40 point drop? can someone share with me what happened? Last year I saw great things happening getting into the pet business that I regretted not buying on the lower end watching it consistently rise. I appreciate any response. thank you.
"Sept. is when the spin-off should happen,a great time and price to buy"
Recent job cuts will negatively effect their Dental business for years to come.
"I am surprised they did not do worse. Dental offices were mandated closed by ADA and some states for up to 3 months plus clients cancelled appointments. The industry equipment market will need major refurb. negative suction devices, filters, PPE, etc will be in demand. HSIC will recover as dental care is only deferable for a short time."
