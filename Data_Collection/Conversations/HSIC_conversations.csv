"Is there more than 1 test per kit. Just wondering because Aytu is going to be receiving shipments of 100,000 kits per week with 25 tests per kit which equals 2.5 million. The first shipment of 2.5 million tests has already been received."

"Today was a good indicator for a strong future. Volume was up, 2.2m shares vs 1.2m average for the last 12 months traded today. I think HSIC is getting more visibility. Schwab reports 4m shares short, a slight reduction from last month. Lastly, 97% of shares are held by institutions."

"This stock hasn't done #$%$ for the past few years. All of a sudden, a pump."
Henry Schein is down 5.57% to 54.47
This is a strange reaction to vistually no change in estimates and revs exceeded. There is one less weak this year vs 2016. The stock is down to 17X earnings which is below a market PE. The ROA and ROE and growth are all well above the SPX. Statiscally a very cheap stock. They have very good balance sheet and leading market positions in most areas. It almost seems robo managers are driving some stocks. Key words are sorted and computers take over selling or buying making individual stocks volitile. This is great company growing at 11-13% that will outperform from this level.
"Elanco Animal Health released earnings this AM. Elanco's revenue grew 9%. Here's Henry Schein's Amimal Health's growth. The company's global Animal Health segment witnessed a 1.9% rise in revenues to $899.3 million. This includes 3.4% growth in local currencies and 1.5% adverse impact from foreign currency exchange. At local currencies, internally-generated sales inched up 1.1% and acquisition growth was 2.3%. The internal growth in local currencies included 0.4% rise in North America and 1.8% improvement internationally."

Is Schein a manufacturer of dental products? Or merely a distributor?

"Due to pentup demand HSIC will come roaringback when virus is contained, and also in process of being contained by distributing products neccessary to containit"

This is another Cramer special. He parades the CEO on quarterly and tells everyone this is a great company. I only bought a few shares but still managed to lose over $500. So much for Cramer.
HSIC will spin off its animal products division soon. It should have a pretty high valuation as compared to other similiar spinoffs. Giddyup!
The last time I was in a Dental office it was like a used car high pressure sales setting selling all sorts of unneeded procedures. It looks like this is the future of Dentistry and the Dental industry.

I finally found the reason for the drop. Some fear Amazon would hurt them. I am not worried about that. GLTA

Getting ready for the bounce back up. Long over 84.55.
should explode to 70 in days
They make face masks and other protective gear and also over 6 models of ventilators. HSIC can ramp production fairly easily. Demand will last for a few years as stockpiles will be permanently at 1 million in the U.S. and 5 million worldwide.
Check out TRNX guys. Gained almost doubled. @.13 is pretty solid deal. Read their PR news today. Good luck. Make some green. 52 week high is above 4$.
"Uhm... Did anyone happen to notice that they can get out 3/4 of a million COVID-19 tests by end of month (and more for April)? AND, the test results only take about 15 minutes. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/henry-schein-announces-availability-coronavirus-121500079.html"

"Seems like the SP should be moving higher, back into the $80's as the financials improve with with debt retirement and company expansion ventures benefit the bottom line. I have heard profit sharing was recently reinstated. Don't see any headwinds, sure wish more small investors saw us as worthy of investment."
Reported good earnings and no lowering of 2020 guidance. Stock is selling below a market multiple with higher growth rate and much better metrics.
Someone please explain what this spin means.Did I just lost 25%?
Henry Schein is down 4.90% to 58.61
"This company was a dog for quite some time. All of a sudden, a little pump. People buy and then a big dump"
HSIC named the fastest covid-19 test company.
I took a position on the drop. I think the company is strong and I've seen MM drop this stock a few points to get in cheap. This is larger drop due to lower guidance is overdone I think. The stock will be back in 175+ range in weeks.I trade this stock on and off. It's been good to me.
Look for possible buy-out if they can get by anti-trust issues.Skies the limit then.

Glad I sold this last year. What a pos.
Spin off into Vets First Choice will result in 20x PE as vet market is growing at 7%. We will get shares in Vets. Tax free spinoff. Resulting HSIC will be growing around 10% according to Mgt. HSIC may be acquired at that point. BUY!
"Today's drop is the computer picking up key words like ""guidance"" and reacting. Nonsense. Use any weakness to add to positions as humans will prevail. The spin off is significant and animal health can have a 30pE."
"We should be moving higher with recent HSIC business additions including the new HHS contract to house PPE, etc. I look forward to the next earnings report. Also HSIC's recent stock repurchase announcement was nice, now I await the influence on SP."

"Listen to the conference call. Lots of ""uncertainty"" and ""caution."" Brexit is a negative (and these folks are all from England I believe), there is going to be restructuring that they can't determine at this point and they are lower guidance (although very modestly). This is the kind of stock that is priced for perfection and there is just too much uncertainty. They also said dental in the U.S.A. is ""soft"". So overall, not good. This could be a good time to take a position - since I have been watching this stock forever and have never owned. Thanks for any feedback you may have."
why the drop?
"only buyers now, should be a steady rise to 85"
Henry Schein mainly functions as a distributor with a small manufactoring capability. The comments of the manufacturing of millions of tests and ventilators is misleading about the HSIC capability. Cramer gives HSIC a pass.
Seems like HSIC should be getting a lot of coverage this week as the back to work test.
When are they announcing they have 15 min tests ready and shipped ?
I keep adding more shares to my IRA on dips like we're having today. When we get stability in the US political scene and this pandemic starts to fade with a vaccine on the horizon. Henry Schein will cut through the 52 week high and do very well. Especially since people have been neglecting their dental issues for months now. The backlog for a dental appointment will be astronomical and the need for supplies will be great.

I haven't followed Schein since Xmas and was shocked to see approx. 40 point drop? can someone share with me what happened? Last year I saw great things happening getting into the pet business that I regretted not buying on the lower end watching it consistently rise. I appreciate any response. thank you.

"Now we know why share volume increased so much yesterday. Those in the know before earnings reported.Earnings reported this morning:'Total net sales for the quarter ended March 27, 2021, were $2.9 billion, up 20.4% compared with the first quarter of 2020. The 20.4% increase included 14.9% internal growth in local currencies, 3.3% growth from acquisitions, and 2.2% growth related to foreign currency exchange. '"
How high do you think the stock will get?
This should be a CV play!
UK says home tests they tried are unreliable. Anyone know if they tried the biomedomics test?

"Super over reaction, the RSI on this is ridiculuos, will bust out high fast, they make tons of money.Look at their competitors, guess what? They don't exist.

"I am surprised they did not do worse. Dental offices were mandated closed by ADA and some states for up to 3 months plus clients cancelled appointments. The industry equipment market will need major refurb. negative suction devices, filters, PPE, etc will be in demand. HSIC will recover as dental care is only deferable for a short time."

Tests are cheap! Don’t expect a bounce from them. Their core business is going down hill fast.
"The moved/reallocated people/money to their spin off animal products today. so that's why it fell over 20%, but people don't know whats happening so they just see a 25% drop and start panic selling."
