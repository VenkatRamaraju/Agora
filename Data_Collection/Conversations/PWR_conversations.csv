Can anyone explain the miniscule dividend that PWR delivers? Given the type of company it is shouldn't the dividend rate be at least a few percent?

"Look at the April monthly PWR & MTZ comparison chart. Quanta is down $1.50 while Mastec is up $5.50. Damn did I pick the wrong one! Duke, remind us again why we pay you so much."
"I stayed with PWR and increased my share holdings. I did buy OKS and when it went up over $8.00 a share a few weeks back I took my profits and bought ""T"" and more PWR. It's doing well and right now I don't really care if it doesn't have a dividend. As of yesterday I'm researching some water stocks, some oil line, and SQ. For that cheap price SQ could be a good deal. I almost think it's going up too fast."

Another boring CC from this company. Same old same old. Minimal Growth
"CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ONSHARES OF QUANTA SERVICES,INC.Recent Price: $35.83Recommendation:BUY We raise our 12-month target price to $42 from $38, valuing the shares at 12.0x our 2019 EPSestimate of $3.50 (raised from $3.17), in line with peers' forward average of 12.4x. We start our 2020EPS estimate at $3.69. PWR posts Q4 EPS of $0.96 vs. $0.45, higher than our $0.79 estimate. In Q4,revenue increased 25.6%, supported by 5.4% growth in Electric Power and 61% growth in Pipelineand Industrial Infrastructure Services (formerly called Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services). Wethink PWR is well positioned to expand during the currently accelerating multi-year growth cyclein both base businesses and large projects. In 2019, we forecast total revenues of 11.3 billion,higher than company guidance that excludes most large project work. We forecast that somepending large projects will support revenue growth of 1.2% in 2019. We see modest EBITDAmargin expansion of 15 basis points to 8.25% in 2019."
"Wow, spam sure does get around. A Google search found 80,000 references to that ""Madison"" spam comment below. I have no idea why Yahoo maintains un-moderated comment boards at all if spammers have driven away actual investors. I wish someone would start a blog for PWR. How hard could that be for someone really invested in Quanta Services?"

"I realize that these boards have more spam than actual comments, but just in case there is a PWR long here, I have a question: I held a position in Quanta Services about 12 years ago, having bought on the expectation of imminent infrastructure work. I usually prefer dividends to growth prospects. I finally sold, and this week I looked at the charts since then, and Quanta seems to be just moving sideways. My question, not meant as a provocation, is why are longs long on this stock? Is there still an expectation that the grid will get the attention it deserves?"

I bought the dip yesterday and just joined in. Thinking PWR will benefit from both new green spending and infrastructure updates. Company looks solid and reasonably stable and yet still got in near price targets. Go PWR!!

"The contract that PWR landed in Puerto Rico is a gold mine. The truth is that PWR don’t need to invest a cent from their own money to reconstruct the widely damaged PR grid despite contractual provisions. They can, and they are, using the CBDG funds to make the repairs. Likewise, the 15 year contract landed in the 14th largest market for microgrids."

"Watch for price target increases. Most were $115- $120, I bet they go to $125- $130. Tempting to sell here but you'll regret it next year."
"So summer price action in PWR has been disappointing thus far for us longs. Let me tell you my reasoning to hang on for a soon to come bump. 3Q18 eps will be .37 higher than the 3Q17 eps. We've been trading at a trailing 17 multiple forever......17X.37= a $6.29 per share increase. That should put us around $40.29 sometime in October. Then for the year $2.74 X 17pe should put us around $46.58 sometime in February. That's where I'll sell a little here and a little there. Let's see if my predictions are accurate, just my two cents."
