Can anyone explain the miniscule dividend that PWR delivers? Given the type of company it is shouldn't the dividend rate be at least a few percent?
FYI- My post that show up on this Quanta (PWR) board are all intended to be posted on SPWR Sunpower board...YAHOO has has tech issue...

"Holy smokes Batman, I was looking thru my old ETrade watch lists and forgot I had marked this one and some other of those old First Reserve companies In 2005/6/7. LOLSymbol: PWR ... Price When Added: 21.72 ... Date Added: 02/05/2007"
"Fundamentals look good, what about guidance for 2022?"
"DADavidson maintains Neutral rating, raises price target from $40 to $48. Credit Suisse maintains Outperform rating, raised price target from $44 to $49."
Quanta Services reached a 52 Week high at 54.67
Margins are meh but earnings are going to be superb. BUY
"Thought this had run up too fast a couple of weeks ago. Sold some May 80 calls against my stock position then. Unless they have an earnings blowout, should trade in the 70s for the next 3-4 months. At least until Congress approves some massive infrastructure bill."
About time PWR is kicking up some dust its been years of waiting reality is starting to set in now!!
Next year we will be over 150.00
"Credit Suisse keeps outperform rating, raises price target from $137 to $143. ""Quanta remains our top pick noting that it is the best positioned in markets with strong secular growth tailwinds including renewables, electric vehicles, and 5G wireline speed."""
I bought the dip yesterday and just joined in. Thinking PWR will benefit from both new green spending and infrastructure updates. Company looks solid and reasonably stable and yet still got in near price targets. Go PWR!!
"There was a piece on NPR this morning about the constant lack of electric power in Puerto Rico. They mentioned Luma and Quanta Services who I believe let the contract, but it was not clear. Focus was primarily on Luma which recently had a Rep testify before Congress who painted a rosy picture of how things were going. Not so said the folks on the ground. Is this something to worry about?"

"Well isn't this nice. Key Bank maintains Overweight, raises price target from $115 to 129. Piper Sandler raises price target from $120 to 140."
"Uxin, jan 15 strikes added, that oversold for the china vroom"
"The contract that PWR landed in Puerto Rico is a gold mine. The truth is that PWR don’t need to invest a cent from their own money to reconstruct the widely damaged PR grid despite contractual provisions. They can, and they are, using the CBDG funds to make the repairs. Likewise, the 15 year contract landed in the 14th largest market for microgrids."

Texas is going to need PWR!
"Wow, great results. Stock seems really cheap below 33."
Just jumped in
"I can't seem to understand why this is going down - record backlog & revenue. Anyone else have a clue? Is it just because they don't offer a dividend? Their margins aren't strong, but that is the industry."

"CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ONSHARES OF QUANTA SERVICES,INC.Recent Price: $35.83Recommendation:BUY We raise our 12-month target price to $42 from $38, valuing the shares at 12.0x our 2019 EPSestimate of $3.50 (raised from $3.17), in line with peers' forward average of 12.4x. We start our 2020EPS estimate at $3.69. PWR posts Q4 EPS of $0.96 vs. $0.45, higher than our $0.79 estimate. In Q4,revenue increased 25.6%, supported by 5.4% growth in Electric Power and 61% growth in Pipelineand Industrial Infrastructure Services (formerly called Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services). Wethink PWR is well positioned to expand during the currently accelerating multi-year growth cyclein both base businesses and large projects. In 2019, we forecast total revenues of 11.3 billion,higher than company guidance that excludes most large project work. We forecast that somepending large projects will support revenue growth of 1.2% in 2019. We see modest EBITDAmargin expansion of 15 basis points to 8.25% in 2019."
"OK, we're town 14% from the $102. high.....that's enough."
"I've been selling a little at a time during this wonderful runup at high $40's low $50's. Now this week CFRA comes out with new analysis. 2021 guidance of $4.10 earnings X 15.6PE = price target increase from $54. to $64. Holy cow, guess I was a little early."
Quanta Services reached an all time high at 74.74
"Watch for price target increases. Most were $115- $120, I bet they go to $125- $130. Tempting to sell here but you'll regret it next year."
Quanta Services shares are trading higher after the company announced it will acquire Blattner Holding Company for total consideration of approximately $2.7 billion.
"Which is the best investment in this group going forward: AECOM (ACM), Fluor (FLR), Jacobs Engineering (JEC), KBR Inc (KBR), TechnipFMC (FTI), Quanta Services (PWR)?"
