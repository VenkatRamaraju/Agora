"Stock fell yesterday most likely from a report by an analyst from Macquarie who doesn't cover the Timeshare industry, but must be an expert. I didn't see the report but it looks like he's implying that because one timeshare company is/was unethical all must be. Anyone have access to the report, please share."

CV should not have much impact on Wyndham Destinations. Most everyone uses their points to visit and maintenance fees pay salaries of staff.
"Another day another dollar. And the only thing people on this board want to talk about is how much they hate timeshares. I'll say it again... This seems like a great business model. The RCI exchange, hotel franchise fees, and timeshare businesses provide annuity-like streams of income and require low capital investments. I'm still surprised this was selling for less than 10x FCF when I bought it. Everybody was wringing their hands over AirBNB. I'm an AirBNB guy myself, but I realized very quickly that there's a finite number of people willing to rent out their own homes, and regulation is making it harder for investors to buy up multiple apartments and run them like hotels. You won't find much overlap between WYN customers and AirBNB customers, and you won't find many AirBNB hosts in WYN's bread and butter markets."

"I’ve been out of my timeshare since January, gave it back to New Bern, transferred the title and they still haunt me for monthly fees. I’ve called Wyndham, told then I’m no longer an owner and the monthly’s just keep coming. Unbelievable, persistent crooks.I want to know am I entitled to a refund for 2020 fees paid since I couldn’t use use it and they weren’t allowing due to pandemic?"

"WYND (Wyndham Destinations) is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It presents itself as a Timeshare Company and as a mother-company for the Wyndham Vacation Clubs. The Vacation Ownership segment develops, markets, and sells vacation ownership interests (VOIs)/(“Points”) to individual consumers; provides consumer financing in connection with the sale of VOIs” (by giving loans of 21 % interest). WYND recently spun off Wyndham Hotels (WH) .WYNDs financial position is very weak. The booked value is negative (- 6,30 usd/share), and the investors have discovered that this hotel company is a house of cards, mortgaged above the chimney. If all assets are sold it will still be in debt. Total Debt is 5.46 billion dollars while the Market Cap is only 4.05 billion dollars (June 2019).The stock price have plummeted during the last 18 months from 57.31 usd (January 2018) to 43.21 usd (June 2019) despite recommendation by stock market TV-guru Jim Cramer in June 2018, Shareholders are disappointed and feel trapped. Stock price have to rise by 35 % to make market cap as large as the WYND debts. Value of assets have to increase. It is alarming that WYND is in this position. In one respect their business model is brilliant. Members in the Vacation Clubs have been convinced and persuaded to make a very large one time advance payment – or take loans with an interest rate of 21% (sic) - to enjoy expensive vacations for the rest of their lives. The members also pay yearly maintenance fees despite the fact that the PVTO or “Condo association” is not the owner but that the ownership is in a “Trust”. This one-time advance payment seems to be divided between the sales force and the Wyndham staff. No new property is then bought by money but paid for by points (the Wyndham vacation currency) which the sales force will help the hotel or resort to sell to new members. WYND desperately needs income. But when the down payment is made, Wyndham has no incentive to help us; the buyers – the Vacation Ownership owners - as the big payment has already been made. And Wyndham’s Owners Care ignores us. Now, many of the members have sobered up and realized that they have invested their life savings in a dream and a bankrupt company. And since the target group and the present Club members are mostly senior, retired citizens, chances are very slim that this group will radically improve their finances and be able to make a onetime down-payment or even pay the interest and maintenance fees. After all, many had no savings when the contracts were signed. Only a desperate and bankrupt company is as abusive towards new and old clients as Wyndham is. There are 900.000 members in the Wyndham Vacation Clubs. We invested our life savings or took a high risk loan at 21 % interest rate when we signed. Wyndham desperately need new members. But the bad reputation of Wyndham and its sales process is all over the internet. It’s all about lies and harsh treatment during a full day sales process when Wyndham tries every trick in the book to convince the buyers. A ruthless sales force have been engaged. They are willing to lie, cheat and threat and take a lot of money for their efforts. (The Club’s offer to book a hotel room or flat one year in advance is very dated and does not suit a senior citizen. We have to wait until we are fit enough to travel; perhaps after a period when the cancer clinic have to be the first choice. Besides, via hotel booking sites you can order a room the same day and much, much cheaper). It is sad to see that the stock market is not really aware that there are 1000s of unhappy Wyndham Club members and that this eventually will harm the stock market performance of both WYND (Wyndham Destinations) and the WH (Wyndham Hotel and Resorts) shares. Still the WYND stock seems more vulnerable; as it’s the motor behind what’s on the net is called the Wyndham Timeshare Scam. On June 5, 2018 TV personality Jim Cramer (CNBC “Mad Money”, the Street) invited Michael Brown, CEO of Wyndham Destinations (WYND) to his TV-show. But Cramer didn’t understand the true nature of WYND. He ought to have discovered that all assets were gone. And everyone could see that CEO Brown didn’t look relaxed. Was he afraid that an unhappy Wyndham Vacation Club member might appear any minute as a surprise guest? Wyndham have caused many people economic distress and is now even targeting senior citizens that don’t have English as their first language.Brown said that Wyndham is a pure-play on vacation time-share destinations, an industry that's as strong as ever. Today's vacationers want space, amenities and consistency, he said, and Wyndham caters to the everyday traveler, which is the market's biggest segment. In addition to allowing customers to lock in future vacations at today's rates, Wyndham also sees big opportunities in the secondary markets when timeshare owners decide to make their exits.jonasbernholm@yahoo.com"
"Wyndham Destinations is doomed. It has a negative booked value. That’s why they are so aggressive today to sell their membership. They need all the money they can get. They have received an equivalent of todays 50 billion usd over the years. But have only a circa 4 billion dollar market cap. Where is the missing money? It was probably different 35 years ago – In the beginning. The correspondence I have received from other unhappy members makes it evident that Wyndham targets and invites the following people to their meetings;1) Foreigners (non American residents) 2) People who don’t have English as their first language. 3) Dyslectic people. 4) Other people who need several hours to read and understand the contract. We don’t know anything about the vacation business in America and about Wyndham and we need extra time to read the contract to understand it. The sales force is probably also highly skilled in detecting people who are unfamiliar with the Wyndham sales method and who trust people and don’t understand that they are being lied to. I was of course a perfect victim. Being a foreigner and in America for the first time in 30 years. I had never heard of Wyndham before. I trust people. I think they are telling the truth and care about my well being.It is also obvious that there are no professional people among the members; like people within the legal profession or among those active in the real estate business. Those will immediately see through the legal terms and can make calculations and see that it is an over prized way to vacation. Wyndham call this a consumer product. To me this is more like a lease or a subscription. Those often have a trial period and a limited time. And in the case of a phone or TV subscription you will soon see if it’s not for you. You can test drive a car. A refrigerator or washing machine has a guarantee. But with the Wyndham Club membership you have no chance to see it works until it’s too lateWyndham gives a 5-10-15 days rescission period. It has to be done in writing to a certain address where there are probably tons of unopened letters. Otherwise you are a lifelong member. Within this short period you have no chance to see how it works. To see the presidential suite is a poor indication to what is offered in the future. Which is either what you didn’t expect or most often nothing at all.I asked Dustin Leonard of the sales force in Panama City Beach to show me what was available and how to book it. But he flatly refused and has since never answered even one single e-mail. This won’t go on forever, however; WYND will see History repeat itself:TV evangelist Jim Bakker (Assemblies of God and PTL Club) sold “lifetime partnerships/memberships” at 1000 usd that entitled buyers to stay 3 nights per year at a Heritage USA theme park luxury Hotel. It had only 500 rooms, and Bakker sold many more memberships than capacity. In 1988 he was sentenced to 45 years in jail for this and other similar charges (wire and mail fraud and conspiracy"

Damn. 1Q2020 way worse than expected.
"Q2 :It also predicts its adjusted EBITDA for Q2 may be flat, which would beat analyst consensus expectations of a $10.8 million drop in the metric. However, its lower-end estimate for Q2 EBITDA is negative $20 million."
If anyone thinks timeshare an investment right now time to buy ;0) good luck boo boo
Anyone who owns this stock might want to pay CLOSE ATTENTION to the owners' comments on facebook and Instagram(@ClubWyndham) for the next couple of days. They have rolled out a new owner's website that is a disaster; totally inoperable with dramatic changes for the worse. Customer service is non-existant. Owners that can will walk away/default on their ownership in droves. This company has oversold it's timeshare (Wyndham Vacation Resorts) and cannot meet it's obligations and promises to the owners.

"The Timeshare organizations have a bad reputation - and mostly deservedly so. And especially Club Wyndham.There are two Wyndham companies listed on the New York Stock ExchangeWYND (Wyndham Destinations) is the Timeshare company. They have created this toxic mess. They sell VOIs (Vacation Ownership Interests). You become a member but You have not bought into a specific property. (I paid 58,379 usd or a silver membership). They have sold far more memberships than there are properties. The cash paying non-members go first and we members have to take what’s available.Wyndham and their subsidiary RCI are said to have properties around the world. But they have not. Especially not during the season when most people take vacations.Long time Wyndham Club members complain that very little is available. And that it’s almost impossible to exit the membershipThe properties are not earmarked for members. A non-member who pay cash at the location goes first. Myself I could not even get a week in Memphis in January 2018 (starting January 16th), despite that they have at least 16 hotels there.But they had one week in Nashville instead. And that hotel was almost full while other hotel chains nearby were almost empty and there were no lights in their windows. It was snowing and freezing cold in Nashville and the whole Tennessee. The pavements were dangerously slippery, and no concerts at the Grand Ole Opry. We had to accept what was available. In this case it was not Hawaii, Brazil or Fiji Islands. But ice paved streets in Nashville.I was promised a membership in RCI. They have more properties outside USA. But I was not a member. It took me 3 months and three reminders before I became a member in RCI. And then my vacation time was over. Whenever You use a Wyndham property you are invited to a update meeting. They promise interesting news for members. However, it is all about upgrading your Club membership. And to pay them more.In my case they said that my Silver membership was not good enough for me. And after an 8-9 hours meeting (without anything to eat meanwhile) I signed up for a gold membership and especially the “Rewards”.It cost me another 46,779 usd.Later I found out that I was already in the Rewards system. All I had to do was to transfer Wyndham Access points there. I had paid 46,779 dollars in vain.Still no one told me that when you transfer points this way, the exchange rate is 0,4 Rewards points for 1 Club Access point.When going to Sri Lanka in early December 2018 I found out that there was only 5 places available there. 4 were in the Capital and in the nearby area of the International airport.Plus one resort circa 250 kilometers away. But nothing was available for me. And besides, with my yearly points exchange for reward points, I could only stay 11 days in Sri Lanka. So I used a hotel booking site instead. They had 11000 places to offer in Sri Lanka. And when comparing the Silver Club membership down payment of 58,379 usd plus the maintenance costs and the yearly points with the costs of the family beach hotels that I eventually stayed at; I could stay there for 222 days compared to only 11 at the Wyndham places. (And the W. places were not available anyway.)I’m a member of Wyndham Club Access. The net is full of complains about how they run their business.Both by members, and by people who have been invited to their sales meetings. We have all been fed the same lies and promises. And never even given the opportunity to leave the meeting, so 1,5 hours promised became 8-10 hours (without food).The complaints are not about small issues like unfriendly staff and unclean rooms (They are very frequent too at Wyndham….). But major issues like; That Wyndham is over selling their memberships taking in more members than they have accommodations for. They are promising overseas accommodations in far away places where they have no footprint (They promised Africa for me, but have almost nothing there).Their back office is not working. It took them 30 minutes to set up an automatic payment plan for the rest of my life but 3 months to send a reply that my message had been received and another months to reply to (a few of) my questions. There is an avalanche of reports on the net about disappointments, broken promises, lies, fraud, and that the minimum of one month yearly vacations promised only became 4 days; because nothing was available. But missing are the names of the persons responsible for creating and upholding this situation. And that these persons eventually will walk handcuffed to the police-car following in the footsteps of Bernie Madoff, while angry club members will try to hit them in the face.Because Wyndham Vacation Clubs are criminal organizations too. You can not sell and promise something and then not deliver. Even Charles Ponzi found that out as did the board and the executive persons at Enron and Worldcom. But this will not happen by itself. Because Wyndham has made"

"It is strange that the listed companies WH and WYND still uses the name WYNDHAM. They are hotel operators. But they have dumped their properties to a number of Vacation Clubs. I made the mistake of becoming a member of the Club Wyndham Access. It cost 58379 usd (sic). The staff used a hard sell technique during 8-10 hours and finally I gave up. Afterwards you are left with lies and promises not kept. While the staff disappears and e-mail addresses don’t work…When you google on search words like “Wyndham Scams” a flood of dissatisfied people tell their tales. Whistleblowers, who reveal the Wyndham selling technique, have to be paid 20 million usd. The vacations offered are seldom available and extremely expensive. Wyndham Club and subsidiary RCI have 5 places on Sri Lanka (but nothing was available when I was there). A 5 % interest/dividend on 58379 usd will give circa 2919 usd/year.And the Condo maintenance costs for the Wyndham Club members cost 2632 usd/year.These 5551 usd will give Club-members 27 days of vacationI used hotel booking site Booking.com instead. They had more than 10000 items to choose from on Sri Lanka. They were mostly close to beach, clean, air-conditioned and with private toilet and bath etc. I paid circa 25 usd/night.This way I could get 222 hotel-nights on Sri Lanka and save the 58379 usd for myself. I believe that most people scammed by Wyndham like myself don’t use their services any more. The badwill will hurt WYND and WHs stock market performance. jonasbernholm@yahoo.com (Sweden)"

I own a Wyndham Tineshare which i bought over 28 years ago and upgraded several times. I have gotten my money back plus some for vacations forever. It's not like that old week timeshare thing. Plus they keep adding resorts to my portfolio every year. I think 219 resorts now where it was 13 when we started
WYND is up 10.23% to 18.97
Anyone here buy under 3 in 2008 or 2009 lows? My wife worked in the timeshare area when the collapse bought some at 3.24 but under 3. Wish had put my whole bank account in them. Slow steady to 110. Nice dividend almost what I paid. But could have bought 200k. But. Well. My wife thought the company would go bust they could not get financing for people to buy timeshare here in Orlando. So she talked me out of a 50k buy at 3 in November 2008! Dammit! Retirement!!

#WYN TA looks great with potential to begin ripping higher. Buy rating: 7 at 9trading. Target: 139.02
"I do think that WYND is a good investment now, and was thinking about buying shares on Monday given where the stock is, and here is my analysis:1. They have been hit harder than most of their peer group comparables (e.g., Marriott Vacation, Hilton Grand Vacations and Blue Green Vacations) and are undervalued based on all metrics (i.e., Revenues, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EPS and Free Cash Flow)2. They are the largest Vacation Ownership manager but trade at a 50%+ discount due to their brand not being a strong as Hilton or Marriott but as each quarter marches on and they continue to outperform, the market will stop penalizing them and bring them on par with Marriott and HIlton (Marriott is a closer comparable since they recently bought ILG - Interval International)3. They are spewing out a TREMENDOUS amount of free cash flow each year which is going back to the shareholders in dividends and open market repurchases (last year over $300MM + in share repurchases)...if this continues this will continue to boost the stock price over time. There dividend yield is also increasing and is now at over 5%4. The hit from the coronavirus is unjustified since very little (i.e., only 13% of their revenues are from the international markets and only a small portion of that is from China and Japan). There will likely be a small temporary hit in tours/sales but I think this will be limited to this year and next year will return to normalcy, but in the meantime they will keep generating revenue from the maintenance fees, and some sales and exchange fees. Much of the traffic to the Wyndham properties is ""driving"" and won't be hit as hard (e.g., remember 9/11 and SARS)5. They would be a ripe candidate for a LBO firm to come and scoop them up due to the amount of free cash flows they have and the share price today. My only concern there is that they may have restrictive anti-takeover covenants that may make it difficult for an outright takeover.6. I think their better bet is to go after the Hilton Grand Vacation sale that has been in play for the last several months and try and convince the Hilton Hotels group that it is in their best interest to maintain their brand licensing agreement (which generates the Hotel group over $100MM+ in revenues). The only problem is that the Blackstone group may be a bidder too and the head of that firm is an Officer at Hilton so he may prevent Wyndham from getting it using the branding rights removal as a weapon. If Wyndham could land Hilton, than it would boost the Wyndham perceived brand and the quality off the customer base and of course their would be synergies on the admin/cost side in the long term. Hiltons average household income is closer $150k vs Wyndham which is $91k. The higher income levels will reduce the loan loss provisions/reserves as well and aid in securitizations as well as pricing/revenues. From an LBO standpoint, it may not make sense for a financial buyer to go after HGV but a company like Wyndham could generate significant cost and revenue synergies by cross-selling eachothers customer base and leveraging a single administrative infrastructure. I could go on and on...but in the end, I think WYND is VERY undervalued"
They can't pay a decent dividend because they constantly have to keep training new sociopaths in their sales dept.

"they sure have a lot of hoops to jump through to use one of their so-called ""free"" 2-nite stay for attending one of their timeshare gigs. First mail in the registration, then select date/location, then get a quote for tax, parking and resort fees #$%$!), then mail a certified check or money order within 15 days of the quote. And these are only the economy properties (Days Inn, etc). I've stayed in several of their economy properties over the years - very spotty - some were ok but many were, to quote our president s***holes. Hardly worth the sales pitch. I did listen with an open mind and after crunching some numbers realized the time share doesn't make sense for me. And the $25 Reward card they give you travel charges $3/month to keep starting after 6 months. So gotta use it and cancel. All this is probably good for stockholders, but leaves a bad taste in my mouth as a potential customer."
