"Old news. But, something is fishy. How could we expect someone to increase dividends when the ship is not sailing.(NYSE: WYND) announced today that the Company's board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share on its common stock, an 11% increase over the Company's quarterly rate in 2019. The dividend is payable March 31, 2020 to shareholders of record as of March 16, 2020."
Travel + Leisure is up 4.91% to 53.41
"Not sure how I missed this news, but Bloomberg reported in August that Hilton Grand Vacation received buyout offers from Apollo and Blackstone. I never thought of WYND as a potential acquisition target but it could be in play..."
Wynd just sold its property rental management to vacasa resorts for 162m. This only accounts for 6% of its holdings... any opinions on the move
I own a Wyndham Tineshare which i bought over 28 years ago and upgraded several times. I have gotten my money back plus some for vacations forever. It's not like that old week timeshare thing. Plus they keep adding resorts to my portfolio every year. I think 219 resorts now where it was 13 when we started
new high stock price coming in the Fall.
How do we figure the basis on this stock with the spin off?
I disagree James .. March 2020 I bought in 250 shares at 19 .. Where are people going to go on Vacation .. In the states .. VA Beach traffic on I 64 was backed up 27 miles .. Customers going to the Beach
"2Q dividend to be paid in full. CEO points out that 50% of revenues are recurring, and mortgage & maintenance deferrals have been lower than expected."
"I do think that WYND is a good investment now, and was thinking about buying shares on Monday given where the stock is, and here is my analysis:1. They have been hit harder than most of their peer group comparables (e.g., Marriott Vacation, Hilton Grand Vacations and Blue Green Vacations) and are undervalued based on all metrics (i.e., Revenues, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EPS and Free Cash Flow)2. They are the largest Vacation Ownership manager but trade at a 50%+ discount due to their brand not being a strong as Hilton or Marriott but as each quarter marches on and they continue to outperform, the market will stop penalizing them and bring them on par with Marriott and HIlton (Marriott is a closer comparable since they recently bought ILG - Interval International)3. They are spewing out a TREMENDOUS amount of free cash flow each year which is going back to the shareholders in dividends and open market repurchases (last year over $300MM + in share repurchases)...if this continues this will continue to boost the stock price over time. There dividend yield is also increasing and is now at over 5%4. The hit from the coronavirus is unjustified since very little (i.e., only 13% of their revenues are from the international markets and only a small portion of that is from China and Japan). There will likely be a small temporary hit in tours/sales but I think this will be limited to this year and next year will return to normalcy, but in the meantime they will keep generating revenue from the maintenance fees, and some sales and exchange fees. Much of the traffic to the Wyndham properties is ""driving"" and won't be hit as hard (e.g., remember 9/11 and SARS)5. They would be a ripe candidate for a LBO firm to come and scoop them up due to the amount of free cash flows they have and the share price today. My only concern there is that they may have restrictive anti-takeover covenants that may make it difficult for an outright takeover.6. I think their better bet is to go after the Hilton Grand Vacation sale that has been in play for the last several months and try and convince the Hilton Hotels group that it is in their best interest to maintain their brand licensing agreement (which generates the Hotel group over $100MM+ in revenues). The only problem is that the Blackstone group may be a bidder too and the head of that firm is an Officer at Hilton so he may prevent Wyndham from getting it using the branding rights removal as a weapon. If Wyndham could land Hilton, than it would boost the Wyndham perceived brand and the quality off the customer base and of course their would be synergies on the admin/cost side in the long term. Hiltons average household income is closer $150k vs Wyndham which is $91k. The higher income levels will reduce the loan loss provisions/reserves as well and aid in securitizations as well as pricing/revenues. From an LBO standpoint, it may not make sense for a financial buyer to go after HGV but a company like Wyndham could generate significant cost and revenue synergies by cross-selling eachothers customer base and leveraging a single administrative infrastructure. I could go on and on...but in the end, I think WYND is VERY undervalued"
Looking for another earnings beat and stock price rising back into the mid 60's!!!
Yet another very good quarter for quarter for TNL as they continue to grow the business. Plus a probable increase in the dividend announced announced. I am very surprised that the share price is not spiking on today's news.
Terrific Q1 results!!! Managemrnt to be commended. Looks like Q2 will be even stronger!
"For those looking to own WYND combined with VAC , a fund SVCTF is a great way to play it. The fund trades at over 60% discount and a hit a huge winner on GME in January. Long term compound average of NAV of 21% since 1987. I have gone to all funds from individual stocks. SVCTF now constitutes 50% of my holdings."
Are millenniums buying timeshares? That is the question to ponder.
I bought more shares this morning at $33.00 per share. very happy and great dividend!!
"Best news ever, spinning off the resorts, you get shares in new holding, buy up till the 17th of May,GYSOT"
I guess it's time for some green today!What do you think?
Bank of America has issued a buy on Wyndham destinations with a target price of $62 per share!
"Great Q4 earnings report and 2020 guidance! Also nice hike in quarterly dividend by 25% to $0,50 per share."
