"Chuy's just filed for mixed offering for $100 million. If the market cap is $280 million, I would wait till after the offering has been completed. New shares and convertible debt would dilute share value. Could be a buy, but wait for a better entry point."

$CHUY continues to struggling and wither in its business despite to-go orders. It may take to 2021 4th quarter to see the results after the adjustment; if it gets okay to open up at 50% or less capacity. It's too little and too late.

I would like to love this stock but it is very overpriced. SSS are awful and barely positive. Thge stock is selling at 25x earnings and 3.5x BV. It is just tex-mex nothing special. It will probably have a disappointing quarter and be $20 soon.

I have a Chuy's near my home and I attempted to pick up a meal for my family but the restaurant was shut down. I can't be a long in this environment. At least open for takeout. Show some attempt at keeping the business going.

"Another disappointing quarter. I go to my local Chuy's and it is packed 7 days a week for lunch and dinner. Hard to believe they are not clicking off 20% earnings growth consistently. The numbers of the quarter are just unacceptable. CEO used to be with O'Charleys, another casual dining restaurant chain that never could grow out of it's own shadow. They always had a great excuse, but never delivered. I have found that companies who have long lines to spend money with them and are not super successful, are poorly run. Looking for a change at the top!"
