"For the ongoing year, the company now anticipates adjusted earnings per share to lie between $7.30 and $7.40, up from the prior guidance of $6.60 to $6.80.Seems like the stock should've reacted a little more positively today ?"
CCK reached an all time high at 69.57

WE GOING TO THE MOON BABY
nice premarket so far
Crown is down 8.88% to 56.01
"STOCK UP OVER 1 PT ON 61,000 SHARES ....HMMMM"
Sounds more like their looking to sell off a piece of the company.
Does anyone ever think crown holdings will issue dividends again?
CCK is down 7.15% to 46.78
Crown is down 13.80% to 51.59
"Bought into this stock in the mid 60s and am quite pleased with my almost 25% return thus far. I continue to be a bull and will hold this stock for the long term. So far I have had great luck with ""Crown"" stocks, the other being Crown Castle. Will be adding to both these stocks on any major pullback."
"Start paying a dividend again Crown.Not asking for much, let's say .05 per quarter, .20 cents per yearWe are in the 3rd inning of a zero interest rate cycle.People are starved for yield & even though the the amount I mentioned is minuscule, it's something."
"""That said, our Board and management team believe there may be substantial opportunities to create further value for Crown shareholders. We have decided to commence a Board-led review of the Company to unlock potential shareholder value, including substantial capital return to our shareholders. We have engaged leading financial, legal, tax and other advisors to assist in this review.""If I'm interpreting that right, it sounds like we might soon be collecting dividends from Crown!"
Crown reached an all time high at 87.62
They have no interest in gaining market share in u.s. walked away from a large customer with large margins last year. Current customers not happy Closed a plant running over 90% eff. Built a new plant that is still running horrible and was 40 mil over budget. losing alot of upper mgt. personnel
"Excited that CCK's new $1.5B buyback authorization will likely be engaged and in play today. Anything under $105 is a no brainer +5% rebound in the next 4-5 trading days. An easy $115-$120 by mid-June. Concerts & festivals, live sports, cruises & resorts, and road-tripping families use SO many cans. Q2-Q3-Q4 will be a string of record can usage quarters and will continue through 2025. Alcoa (AA) is the sister material play, but it has already seen a rebound from last weeks beatdown. CCK is ready to eat right here. This is not investment advice. I like the stock :) and love the company!"
Why are we down randomly today? Life is good. Indices are up. CCK is solid.
"Looking real good. This certainly isn't a sexy stock, but it's consistent. Todays price 61.32 divided by EPS of 5.00$ = a PE of 12."

"This is good. Congratulations to long-term holders, & by long term holders, I mean 20+ years.This thing very briefly traded below $1.00 back in the early 2000s. So glad I had an online brokerage account at Fidelity back then."
I'm told by a Secretary in Yardley that 4 Berkshire guys visited yesterday. Is that what's driving the price? Buffet could take this to 110. Makes sense for Warren to get a stake or take the whole thing. Sweet if true.

"Since the high temperature was 17° below zero yesterday, I had plenty of time to waste. I went to Fidelity & checked out a couple research reports on CCK.Here's what Zacks had to say:""The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 6. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower""WOW, way to go out on a limb there. Incredibly insightful..... LOL"
