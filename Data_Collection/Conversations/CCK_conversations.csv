SPLIT CCK STOCK 3 FOR 1 ....AND INSTITUTE DIVIDEND
EARNINGS OUT TODAY.
"As long as there is high demand for beverages, both soft and hard, CCK will do well. Invested in the 60s and very pleased with the way the stock has acted. This will be well over $100 in the future. I like boring companies and so does Buffett."
CCK Has been seeing some good buying power lately on low volume ...Wonder if something is going to happen ?
Does anyone ever think crown holdings will issue dividends again?
"This is good. Congratulations to long-term holders, & by long term holders, I mean 20+ years.This thing very briefly traded below $1.00 back in the early 2000s. So glad I had an online brokerage account at Fidelity back then."
Crown is down 4.91% to 99.84
nice premarket so far
"""That said, our Board and management team believe there may be substantial opportunities to create further value for Crown shareholders. We have decided to commence a Board-led review of the Company to unlock potential shareholder value, including substantial capital return to our shareholders. We have engaged leading financial, legal, tax and other advisors to assist in this review.""If I'm interpreting that right, it sounds like we might soon be collecting dividends from Crown!"
$2B to reduce debt and buy back stock. The long slumber might be over...
Good entry point here! I just bought in.
Now what?
"Excited that CCK's new $1.5B buyback authorization will likely be engaged and in play today. Anything under $105 is a no brainer +5% rebound in the next 4-5 trading days. An easy $115-$120 by mid-June. Concerts & festivals, live sports, cruises & resorts, and road-tripping families use SO many cans. Q2-Q3-Q4 will be a string of record can usage quarters and will continue through 2025. Alcoa (AA) is the sister material play, but it has already seen a rebound from last weeks beatdown. CCK is ready to eat right here. This is not investment advice. I like the stock :) and love the company!"
Werent quarterly earnings susposed to this afternoon after closing?
"$LOOP Gabelli Funds, LLC, will host the 7th Annual Waste Environmental Services Symposium on March 18, 2021. This timely conference will feature presentations by senior management of several leading companies, with an emphasis on industry dynamics, new technologies $SMED $WM $WCN $CCK $CWST $RSG $DAR $REGI $CVA $ECOL $PYR $LOOP $PHE $BHTG"
"Big beat. I own two Crown stocks, Crown Holdings and Crown Castle. Both have given me royal wealth."
"It's official, just saw the story at Fidelity. Crown announced a $.20 per share dividend payable to shareholders who owned it on March 5 and payable on March 25. Not sure those are the 'exact' dates."
"For the ongoing year, the company now anticipates adjusted earnings per share to lie between $7.30 and $7.40, up from the prior guidance of $6.60 to $6.80.Seems like the stock should've reacted a little more positively today ?"
"Free cash flow is strong and growing, Signode is off to a great start, and stock cheap at 13% FCF yld on '19. Good opportunity here. What am I missing."
Any else heard the rumor that Buffet is looking at CCK due to the environmental trend switching from Plastic to Cans?Sounds logical... Also any news on initiating a dividend?
