Growth for this company is unlimited for at least 10 years+, and then they will have so much surplus money they will start buying other companies doing other things like GOOGLE did on buying YouTube. Say bye bye the the old FICO score, and Hello to UPST."

market not closed yet
"I am not in this stock but wanted to say Congrats to the longs. Nice to see some people getting nice ER bounces. Cannot help but feel like I missed this a bit. Thoughts on SoFI for an ER play? Fintech, finance and personal loan seem to be on fire right now and most importantly well received by the street at the moment which is important as a lot of companies crushed ER and still dipped. Doesn’t seem to be the case doe this sector at the moment. Again congrats guys. Hope it continues for you all."
good morning longs wow premarket starts 
its dip buy buy buy
no worries gonna huge jump on Monday  have good weekend
let's go again babe 
shorts selling again 
"Sponsored Post:Aside from Upstart's newly announced private offering, these other sectors could probably use safer and effective lithium extraction methods to prevent water wastage. You could also explore more of their environmental habits of mining here. Check the disclaimer on the landing page. https://b.link/ScorchingHotEnergyPotentials"
So I guess no Kramer tonight? WTH!!
new record 229.42
Look at UPST rally!!! GO UPST GO!!!
back to 204 again yeah !!
Shorts…… sell into earnings ( stock in the 130s)……. Shorts….sell after earnings report ( stock in the 170s)…….shorts….sell after the convertible note offering announced ( stock @200)…… shorts….. sell now ( stock @ 218)….. see a pattern here ?
"When I first started working with TSLA the stock was @ $100. People at Tesla told me this could be a $1000 stock one day. I laughed to myself but now It’s at $2800+ split adjusted. That said, UPST could be $1000 per share and I’m not laughing at that."
shorts started selling to make pocket money  lol
"P Man, Boa"
2500 shares @ 98 avg.Staying put for years.
good job 
just a young upstart...
bao=Matt ???hmmm
Shorts expected another dump like last few times. I guess it didn't work out that way this time. No more pump an dump and more long term holders.
"this will close above $200, that's a gurantee!"
C'mon $225+ !!
tmr back to 225 
"There is no immediate dilution for shareholders today.The company is able to generate more cash with less potential dilution in the future due to the conversion value's premium to the current share price. Senior convertible notes usually carry a lower interest rate than nonconvertible notes, so more of the money can be used to fund expansion versus debt service."
$UPST [Sep-03 195.00 Puts] Option volume Up +245.45% | Volume: 152 vs 44|
"I mentioned this before but UPST was at 120 then , just after the lockup ended for early investors and non director employees in June. The next and final lockup ends on October 14th , on that day directors including the CEO who owns about 11.5 million shares can sell. This event will release millions of more shares in the market, creating the next dip. So those here wanting to buy on the dips should put this on the calendar because after this final consolidation the sky is the limit."
bao it's slowly covering up now if u have eye ball look up lol
230 @close 
"institutional buying will not let this drop below $200, they have call options above $200. buy buy buy!!!"
new ATH 220.70 here we go!!!
"I have to quit smoking cigarettes, having surgery and the dang insurance company wants me to get a nicotine test before they will approve my surgery. I'm about to explode. If the stock goes up it helps me not want a smoke as bad. Please help me out. Thank you."
If you are wondering why this is going up so much it's quite simple. They have a superior product offering with no competition. Highly scalable business so they are going to capture marketshare quickly.
"OMG it’s crashing it’s down -2% this morning after a gain of 80% in a month. Run for the hills. This is just the beginning. UPST is the strongest stock out there. See the numbers, see the expectations. "
buy buy buy !! 
This was a bit frothy but that’s okay. You may want to be in CHPT before the environmental stimulus package is factored into the price. It should be trading around $30 today
"remember UPST does not follow the market, the market could collpase but this will still go up. buy buy buy!"
go UPST show the power 
"Can't wait til next quarter's ER, and the one's after that."
"This is a $200+ stockThe margins are great, growth is great, profits great time for 200"
$UPST blew away earnings numbers. Personal loan business is red hot. Should bode well for SOFI lending business Earnings will be strong on Thursday
"$450 by end of year 2022, $600 by end of year 2023, $750 by end of year 2024, and $900 by end of year 2025. Mark this post."
We'll have to wait and see what their plans are for the money raised. If it's for expansion into mortgages the stock will skyrocket. 
I observed this stock following the pattern. Usually up 10:45.
I have been waiting to buy any dip.  we have not had one and I have sat out a good 40% move after earnings.
This is my strongest conviction stock at the moment. Incredibly ahead of the competition
go UPST 
Why down?
I am a holder..and yes I want it to drop..need more in here
hold tight longs this rocket going up now
"Last quarter UPST , After great earnings stock ran for three weeks ,not three days. This stock will get more upgrades and lots more great days for weeks to come. As stock holders, we benefit from analysis doing their research and giving this Fintech company their professional opinions.This company will be one to remember, for many years!,"
"Dave Girouard is a genius, our money is safe in this stock for a very very long time. He knows how to grow a company the proper way after his experience with GOOGLE's cloud and marketing business."
Upgraded from $130 to $230 WOW that’s a huge upgrade
come out and post dumdums 
this stock is on fire 
Sold Before Market Drop Good Luck Guys
I think this might get into Nasdaq Index soon... if this gets into funds.. i see it cranking up much higher
MATT ….. 5 days ago “ this should hit 150 by Friday”…… do yourself a favor and mute him …. No wait !!! Instead let’s all offer our condolences when Matt goes broke shorting this. Anyone here that can advise Matt on a bankruptcy attorney?
Going to 500
Ok ok I know this is getting old and redundant but…….CONGRATULATIONS LONGS…….. 300 on the horizon
They also demonstrate why Upstart has an opportunity to become one of the world's largest and most impactful fintechs in the years to come.Didn’t I just say that? Just the beginning. Thanks for link Wallstreet 101
open at 210 tmr
wow
I pray this will be a good week for upstart 
look up the news globe news wire released amazing new for UPST 
I wonder how many will sell before next quarter's ER? ZERO if you're smart. And if you're even smarter you won't sell for at least 5 years. MASSIVE BULLISH GROWTH RATES
"What do you think about the earning? Who bet it will be positive, please raise your hand."
This is why I love offering 
It is so overvalued... OPFI has same numbers and 20x cheaper
longs lets push this to the moon !!! hold tight don't sell
Why Report My Post Honey ?Will Drop To 180$ soon
don't sell guys u guys regret big time later 
tmr open at 235 and go UPST 
Ready TMR Drop To 203$187$ End This Week
this reminds me of fiverr stock back when it was trading at $320 then collapsed to $192 in 26 days.I am buying 3k worth of puts for a 10x return expiring next month.
"Sold another round of Puts this morning for a good profit. Now waiting to see how high you all drive this up again for Puts to be in order again. The higher you all drive it up, the happier I'll be - go go!!"
Party has just started. Just chill and watch the show!
guidance raised to $750 million for 2021!
"this will become one of the biggest cash cow on the stock markets. 1000 dollar stock in 2 years i believe. not for investment advice, for my entertainment."
UPST doesn't seem to.like it when it dips.under 200
High yesterday 206.47
"Anybody short this company is insane. It's already a proven model and years ahead of any possible competition. Banking is business where .001% is a big deal. It's hard to see another Ai lending model/algo being better while Upstart is getting smarter with every input. The enormous scale, breaking into new markets along with being able to increase pricing down the line makes this company an absolute beast. With all the information we currently have, catalysts will take this to 500+ by the end of this year."
new ATH 230 finally 
lets go longs ! enjoy climbing up 
showing great strength
"Even if the 2,750,000 are a dilution, it would only = a 3.5% drop total which only = 6 to $7 total which = $193 total from the $200 we ended on yesterday. And the way I read it it wasn't going to be a whole 3.5% dilution the way they are doing it. So whoopty doo, it's no big deal. Dave Girouard knows what he is doing people, he helped build up GOOGLE's cloud and marketing businesses , which I think are doing just fine. UPST has just began and we are in on the starting floor."
"this was the easiest 10k i have ever made, now onto 20k!"
$UPST on Cramer Tonight
"And I ask, what made this stock go up, our chat on here or the positive numbers the company put out in last 2 ER's along with the future guidance? I highly doubt any real big money is listening to yahoo finance chatrooms. LMAO"
Target price was increased from $147 to $253 at Goldman yesterday evening; reiterate buy rating. No link; it's not publicly disemminated.
"Hold this stock for at least 3 years. If you need money for bills, sell some of your other stocks, but not this one. This one is going to be too valuable, another Google, or close to it. I'll bet Dave G. the owner has some plans to grow this thing beyond just his banking software."
congratulations longs on a fantastic day !!!! let me repeat what i posted here when this was trading the day after earnings.....when you invest in a company that has ground breaking technology that is in its infancy which is producing outstanding sales increases and still has a med cap market cap.......invest and hold thru ups and downs and before you know it you will be filthy rich. for weeks this and other message boards were littered with shorts saying this would now be trading around 150.....poor souls are BROKE. KEEP THE FAITH LONGS.....we will see 300......again congratulations
premarket is green 
UPST on it's way to 300+ will have volatile moves. Enjoy the ride!
Jealous bashers. UPST is the real deal baby
Love UPST!! Did anyone see Motley Fool’s Article on UPST AND RSKD from earlier today titled:“If you like Upstart Holdings you’ll love this IPO” Riskified uses AI to reduce fraud while increasing sales.Any thoughts on RSKD?
wow omg premarket way to go UPST !!!!
so new ATH is 230.38
"I really don’t get all the fear with a capital raise. I’ve invested in private startups and there is always delusion. People think delusion is bad… and often times in public markets it is. However, consider this fact - if they raise 500+m and it deletes by let’s say 3% and then they use those funds to drive up the value of the shares via new investments, acquisitions, R&D, technology by an amount larger than the delusion … then the delusion is consider smart…Tesla went up more than one on a capital raise because investors knew it would strengthen the company…. The same is true here… this company is one of the only companies to be growing at a 1000% clip … while growing the bottom line at a clip most companies which they would grow at…This delusion is surely going to bring more value to shareholders than the actual delusion itself. It will be immediately accretive to the top and bottom lines. Just wait for them to announce what the money was for. This is why investors do not care one bit about the delusion and are snapping up shares despite it… matter of fact it could even be viewed as a positive catalyst. My two cents. Good luck all."
"Folks, this is going to be $200 sooner than expected! Cheers to all the longs and remember this is a Great company with Awesome Management!"
"Here is a great explanation of why the convertible bond announcement is great for UPST:In a nutshell, the company is issuing these bonds and paying a minuscule 0.25% interest rate on the debt, a tremendously advantageous cost of capital. The bonds will mature in 2026 and will be convertible to stock at a price of $285.26 per share.This bond issuance could potentially dilute current shareholders, but only if the stock rises over 30% from its current price. And in the meantime, Upstart is getting a ton of capital to build out its red-hot artificial-intelligence powered lending platform for next to nothing. It's not tough to see why investors might be applauding this move."
open at 222 tmr  good nite longs see ya
where is bao and p-man by the way ????lol
this Friday 250for sure 
look at premarket beautiful!!!
"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/ceo-exela-upstart-logiq-reliq-134700919.html''Our Q2 revenues grew to $194 million, up 60% compared to the prior quarter. June was our first month with more than 100,000 loans and more than $1 billion in origination volume on our platform. And we achieved this growth while also delivering record profits with adjusted EBITDA of $59.5 million and GAAP net income of $37.3 million...We have built a strong and profitable core from which we expect to launch several new products and services in the months and years to come. AI lending will transform financial services in the decade ahead and we aim to make Upstart synonymous with that category…”"
correction 229.52
"I know realistically we can’t expect USPT to be green everyday after being up 80% in a month, BUT I DO. GREEN BABY"
go UPST  show us !!!!!
Today is a win in my book. Didn't tank like everyone expected and showing relative strength.
"Ceiling my A, Z. Z, This company is just getting started, growing like a weed. There is no ceiling for this company for at least 8 to 10 years on down the road."
Probably closing down on reduced volume. I'll take that:-)
"The company has a very high P/E ratio, so the potential return on investment looks very low. Seems like the stock is overbought and a correction is on the way. The fair price for this stock should not be more than $100. It has a bright future, but it needs better earnings."
"This IPO reminds me of TTD (The Trade Desk) IPO. It's had a great previous 5 year move....a 45 bagger in 5 years, but it definitely had pullbacks during that time frame."
Wait until they get into mortgages. 4digit stock.
Bears when a stock up 1000% in 9 months continues to go up.
"UPST the company put a healing price of $400 per share on the funding they are getting, the minimum is $285. These people are smart."
Let’s hope for a new breakout 
no worries gonna cover up like always we been through like this many times 
"The reason it will stay above the $200 level and won't pull back anymore is because of the high rate of growth, profit, and future outlook of more and more growth. $200 is a fair price for this stock. If you want to sit on the sidelines go ahead, but most of us want in now because we can see what it'll be worth in a few years."
Looks like a GREAT DAY.I won't be with you 25th 26th mini getaway.
250 by Friday
Seriously. This is just the beginning for UPST. As we sign more and more banks to use UPST AI the higher this will go. This is just the beginning. It’s the one stock I know I will hold for years
Over time as UPST moves up you will get wild swings always with new company's with powerful growth. ENJOY the RIDE.
She shorted
UPST just added to IBD leaderboard top ten. This breakout has been more orderly than the previous two.
who said going to 220?
"I like UPST a lot, but look out....TNT is coming. And I love that one."
go UPST !! 
will this ever DROP to buy again ? Got out at 196.9!Big regret.
When Nasdaq is green this $UPST is red.. looks like going downhill 
"John, Trillion, Chris, Ben... all people that I just muted. Have a great day!"
"Good News today, Patelco Credit Union Selects Upstart for Personal Lending. More banks will be joining UPST. Reasons why price drops is because Funds Manager Lowe sold a few millions shares today"
Lets keep a 2 in front from here out.
ommmmmmmgod !!!!!!!! huge jump
When this stick hits 1200 people wil say “I thought you said 1000 per share”Long runway folks. Disruptor of a mega industry in need of disruption.
Record close today!! O ya!!!!
Buyers should come in tomorrow everyone trying to find bottom.UPST jumped from 135 to 220 in very few days and has to settle.Long run a Powerhouse DOCU had it's growing pains. Just an example.
"Just wait until auto financing starts.Then it’s to the Moon, UPSTART will be over $500!!"
"Very soon it will be a choice between paying a mortgage and rent or repaying a loan.Guess which one will default?And can you get a new loan if you can't even afford rent/mortgage. Sure, anything is possible in frenzy this financial world where the entire financial market and financial institutions are committing fraud and hoping that the FED rescue and bailout everyone.."
Upstart should launch its own bnpl service.
Still in the early innings. Led by an excellent management the next opportunity is auto loans then mortgage then international expansion. $100 billion dollar company in the making.
correction 224.49
Running errands. Get it 230S
Who here thinks it will continue climb or will it drop soon?
"look at the chart, goes up drastically on earnings each quarter, this will go down then up on next quarter earnings. Keep holding."
"I think there is another 25-40 to go, If next quarter result is as good it will push it to 300+"
"Finally synced exactly with market direction, enjoy the ride and be aware of market conditions."
This or LC?
220 at close !! what a great day 
"I learned the hard way long ago trying to short term trading stocks, trying to sell and buy back low. It looks good on paper but come time to pay taxes you're actually losing money. If you sell at $215 and buy it back at $205, you would have paid more money in high % short term gain taxes than if you would have just held the stock for at least a year before you sold. If you think it will keep going up there's no reason to short term or day trade it. Just hold long term and pay no taxes(0 - $40,000 = 0%) and keep your whole profit."
Lets Go!!!
$270 is target. No change the rally path.
Barclays upgrades $UPST from Equal-Weight to Overweight and raises price target from $130 to $230!!
"Total Cash 506.29M, Total Debt 23.84M, Quarterly Revenue Growth (yoy) 896.50%. Already profitable with a gaining amount of cash on hand. I'd say they are well on their way to stardom."
Let’s go baby. Let’s end the week on a high note.
tmr should be huge jump !
omg what now? what is going on ?
$175 today??
Never sell. Add on any dips for the next 5-10 years.
futures encouraging...
"Food for thought. I wonder what would happen if Google bought this company out to add to it's portfolio? $1,100 a share maybe? Crazier things have happened."
insiders hold 15.67 % of UPST down from 15.82% this means that in spite of the lockup ending very few shares were sold by insiders.

Boa and P whatever we know you have been watching all day ;) Did you switch back over to your other nickname yet?
139 will be taken out. Expect strong report tomorrow.
"No worries, UPST is way too strong of stock, it's balance sheets are too positive, and growth rates for the next 5 years is too great."
Every article I read is nothing g but positive bout UPST. The number are huge and just keeps going higher. Future is huge for UPST.
"So still trying to figure out how they are paying for prodigy or for that matter how much. Also what are they going to use the $575 million in convertible bonds for?They say ""general purposes"" which is a non-answer. They are sitting on $617 mil in cash, low debt, highly profitable, generating tons of cash and operating in a business that doe not require massive working capital. Anyone have any knowledge?"
"Incoming … Recently, Upstart filled a newly created General Manager of Mortgage position. This signals early stages of offering a mortgage product which would mean entry to a massive $2.5 trillion dollar category."
Now what do these facts tell you?
Adding another $25k to my UPST holdings. It’s just so strong.
"I sold 25% of my UPST today at 203 which I bought at 115, I will be long on the rest."
I'm not paid person or don't have something to do with UPST at all I just love this so much hope to see bright future !
wow something really going on right ????
hope could hear good news on Monday and be blasted day 
210 or 230 at the close?
"For those that think they missed the boat, think again. I’ve been holding this for a few months selling puts along the way, cha Ching! I’m looking for a small pullback to $192, then the March to $300. Folks that claim UPST is overvalued haven’t a clue."
I think it will be down 10% tomorrow. Anyone else wants to take a guess?
"Thanks for the discount, adding more shares!"
They had some interesting insights about UPST on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Will another acquisition be here soon after the notes?
I am pleasantly suprised I dumped my BABA position and rolled into UPST yesterday morning!!!!
gogogogogo UPST 
good job UPST 
"And we just witnessed a super strong comeback from UPSTART. As usual, UPSTART never disappoints longs. Cheers folks and have a great weekend!"
don't ever down grade UPST  I love this company a lot
bao u r totally wrong ok look premarket lol
What's everyone's position on $UPST ?
"Are you still on the fence to #BUY?- Currently 17 people viewing this #PKKFF Conversation!#PEAK Market Cap - $481.60Mvs.-3 people viewing #UPST Conversation!#UPSTART Market Cap - $13.70BWhere do you think you’ll make a Bigger Multiple by Investing today???In My Opinion, 10x, 20x, maybe 30x current share prices!!! Do your own #DueDiligence!"
"Back, acting just like a growth stock should."
175 today 
My view is as we get further away from the last earnings report the trading volume will drop and the price will drop. Then as we get closer to the November earnings things will reverse. If I’m right then in the next few weeks could come a buying opportunity. I’m looking to double my position.
"Can I? MOMA MIA, MOMA MIA........."
Manipulation 101 watch 200 on the penny be the top until the next ER
"Wow, that was a serious pop. Someone talk me out of selling, can this thing run substantially past $200 in 3 years?!"
"Let’s review this past week…… UPST closes Tuesday @ 135. Shorts lead you believe earnings report after the bell will cause the stock to decrease. Closes @ 161 after hours ( shorts lose)….. closes Wednesday @171. Again shorts are in panic mode and want all to believe it will tank there next day ( another day shorts lose ). Thursday upst closes @178. Now shorts are in big trouble yet they now insist Friday it will fall hard ( one more day shorts lose ). Friday upst surges to 203 and closes near the highs. Shorts have been decimated ( shorts losing streak now 4 days). Now on this board and other message boards…… it’s mass chaos in the worlds of those that have bet against this monster. They know they are about to lose it all. Folks bottom line …… will this go straight up without any declines? No. Will Upst see 300+ per share in the next 12 months ? Absolutely yes! Shorts know it will happen …….. there will be a MASSIVE short squeeze in the coming months. This along with massive sales and profits coming in a company with a GameChanging technology in its infancy , those who buy and hold their shares will be VERY rich in the next 3 to 5 years ."
"Love this stock, been researching for the last month or so. The only thing that worries me is their customer concentration. Has there been any news about onboarding new customers? Or any words of wisdom or opinions on this subject?"
"#Upstart today reached $200, 52 week high, 12% daily increase! $15.27 Billion Market Cap! @PEAK_Fintech - their verticals, #ecosystem business hub, #FutureValueAdd Opportunities, and High Future Growth Expansion may give them an ability to blow past #UPST"
Keep selling me your shares 
"I work on the prime side of Indirect Auto Lending and I would like to see UPST bring on a large auto finance partner. One of the large non-prime lenders such as Americredit, Santander or Exter would be great. In addition if they could bring on one of the large captive lenders such as Ford Credit, GM Financial or Toyota Financial it could be huge. In the Q1 call 3-months ago they mentioned a relationship with Subaru of America (via Prodigy), need to get a relationship with the larger OEM's. With the money they have from the recent offering could they purchase a company that can get them into the mortgage industry??? Lots of growth opportunities!!!!!"
"A brand new high, whoop whoop. Many more to come."
Monday will Drop 10%_15%This Stock Just Overvalue
the more the market collpase the higher this one goes!!! let's all root for the dow to lose 1000 points!
UPST has 75% fewer defaults at same approval rate. 173% higher success rate at same loss rate. Proof is in the pudding.
bears in shambles right now
keep going up til tmr go UPST 
Why do people try to short companies that are on the fast track up and up? Isn't that like playing with a stick of dynamite with the fuse lit?
Matt….. take a deep breath . Ok ok we believe you when you say you’ve made money shorting Upst . Yes Matt we believe you even though you said sell @172 and you said sell at 192. Yes Matt you made money .
"before Q2 earnings report UPST had 290 institutions controlling 68.67% of the float, now there are 316 Institutions controlling 67% of float."
Took it on the chin today. Not first or last time on the way to 300.
"it only takes 2 months o bring on a big Patelco Credit Union to the platform with over 400,000 members. the UPST AL must be very convincing."
Where is P man---OH i SEE HIM NOW
We'll be back at 225 tomorrow.
nobody can stop upst !!! its unlimited !!!!!!!!!

Will Drop Tmr Trading Carefully Guys
"Here's one comment from the shorts. ""after results, it will hit 80."" They are clueless about this stock and the huge growth it has now and future potential growth it's going to have. They are in the wrong stock if they think shorting it is a good idea."
buying back many shares !!! go UPST 
I guess we can't go up everyday
wow I am already 70% up... should I wait or sell ....
MM release a article. Use your AI to pump.
"HaHaHaHa, yahoo finally raised their target price from $191, i think it was last Friday, to $206. The price targets I've been seeing from other places are all over $375. Go figure"
Volume slowed. Couldn’t retake 220. On its way to a pullback.
I use to be nervous on red days but not with this stock. I think the story is still underappreciated.
Who thinks 230 tmmrw?
"Unfortunately, we are not able to offer you a loan with Upstart at this time.To see why, visit your Message box.

I've averaged up 3 times now. MP is estimated to own 15% of rare earths. It's like $DKNG or $MTTR or $UPST or $PENN or $ETHE or $TCNNF ...Buy the dips and be patient.
new ATH 224.22wow
$UPST trending in to resistance. Would look for a pullback before entering if it can't breakout decisively. Note that volume has been fading as buyers lose conviction. It would be healthy to see a retest of MA(20) before prices resume their upward trajectory.
It does not matter if you buy or sell right now if you are long term because in 5 years this thing will triple at least.
Hundreds of banks will be using UPST platform soon enough. This is the one stock you just buy and hold for years
$300 by end of year
"There is a compelling story with this company, as strong societal forces are at work demanding economic justice for disadvantaged communities. Traditional credit-score lending places higher interest rates on loans, if they are offered at all, to people with credit score issues. You guys know the drill; high credit scores and the ability to manage debt to achieve them is considered a manifestation of ""white privilege."" Upstart's AI looks beyond credit scores and makes better lending decisions for both lender and applicant based on other factors. Not asking for agreement about whether some communities are privileged and the reasons why others are disadvantaged, but I'm pretty sure Upstart is geared toward addressing those issues by letting lenders find reasons to make good loans despite less than desired credit scores."
"I have came to the conclusion that many were shorting this stock before the last ER, this is the only explanation I can come up with people saying this stock will go down from here, even after the future guidance was so great. I'm guessing they are about to lose their house and have no other choice but to pray. If I were one of them I'd cover my short, cut my loss, and actually buy the stock to make it back up in the future."
Volume appears to be slowing and might be good to stop the churn and buyers keeping.
Announced right now the price of conversion is 285$....should hold well...lets see today...

"I checked out an independent projection on UPST. 1 year at $375 and 5 year at $1,015. personally I like these numbers. Have 625 shares at $130 cost average."

"Look for $188 to hold, if it breaks we could test $175, at which point I’ll gladly add more."
Shorts be like...
I wonder why those who are not vested are here? But i think they have miss this stock and so are envy or jealous of us. I cant think of other reason of why they are here?
"I'll be back in 4 years when it's over $1,300 to look at it. I just don't get swing traders when here's a stock that we all know will keep growing and growing over the years, why they just don't buy and then hold tight long term. It's a huge mystery to me, I guess they can't do math on the high % short term taxes they are paying doing all that swing trading vs holding it long term and paying 0 taxes. Oh well they will be buying it back in a minute or two anyway. Here comes another big chunk."
