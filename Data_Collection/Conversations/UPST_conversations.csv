Congratulations Matt !!!!! You made 33 dollars today shorting Upst …. I’m proud of you pal
"I learned the hard way long ago trying to short term trading stocks, trying to sell and buy back low. It looks good on paper but come time to pay taxes you're actually losing money. If you sell at $215 and buy it back at $205, you would have paid more money in high % short term gain taxes than if you would have just held the stock for at least a year before you sold. If you think it will keep going up there's no reason to short term or day trade it. Just hold long term and pay no taxes(0 - $40,000 = 0%) and keep your whole profit."
$UPST on Cramer Tonight
bao=Matt ???hmmm
"HaHaHaHa, yahoo finally raised their target price from $191, i think it was last Friday, to $206. The price targets I've been seeing from other places are all over $375. Go figure"
"UPST the company put a healing price of $400 per share on the funding they are getting, the minimum is $285. These people are smart."
"I like UPST a lot, but look out....TNT is coming. And I love that one."
1000% growth ..... maybe the party is over.
bao u r totally wrong ok look premarket lol
Here's the link for Cramer's interview with Upstart CEOhttps://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/08/26/upstart-ceo-on-growth-of-ai-based-lending-fico-scores-and-expanding-platform-for-spanish-speakers.html?__source=sharebar|twitter&par=sharebar
"Anybody short this company is insane. It's already a proven model and years ahead of any possible competition. Banking is business where .001% is a big deal. It's hard to see another Ai lending model/algo being better while Upstart is getting smarter with every input. The enormous scale, breaking into new markets along with being able to increase pricing down the line makes this company an absolute beast. With all the information we currently have, catalysts will take this to 500+ by the end of this year."
market not closed yet
"Incoming … Recently, Upstart filled a newly created General Manager of Mortgage position. This signals early stages of offering a mortgage product which would mean entry to a massive $2.5 trillion dollar category."
Who thinks 230 tmmrw?
wow omg premarket way to go UPST !!!!
We'll be back at 225 tomorrow.
"I'll be back in 4 years when it's over $1,300 to look at it. I just don't get swing traders when here's a stock that we all know will keep growing and growing over the years, why they just don't buy and then hold tight long term. It's a huge mystery to me, I guess they can't do math on the high % short term taxes they are paying doing all that swing trading vs holding it long term and paying 0 taxes. Oh well they will be buying it back in a minute or two anyway. Here comes another big chunk."
tmr should be huge jump !
Look at UPST rally!!! GO UPST GO!!!
"it only takes 2 months o bring on a big Patelco Credit Union to the platform with over 400,000 members. the UPST AL must be very convincing."

"Back, acting just like a growth stock should."

Ready TMR Drop To 203$187$ End This Week
When Nasdaq is green this $UPST is red.. looks like going downhill 
"There is a compelling story with this company, as strong societal forces are at work demanding economic justice for disadvantaged communities. Traditional credit-score lending places higher interest rates on loans, if they are offered at all, to people with credit score issues. You guys know the drill; high credit scores and the ability to manage debt to achieve them is considered a manifestation of ""white privilege."" Upstart's AI looks beyond credit scores and makes better lending decisions for both lender and applicant based on other factors. Not asking for agreement about whether some communities are privileged and the reasons why others are disadvantaged, but I'm pretty sure Upstart is geared toward addressing those issues by letting lenders find reasons to make good loans despite less than desired credit scores."
"Food for thought. I wonder what would happen if Google bought this company out to add to it's portfolio? $1,100 a share maybe? Crazier things have happened."
"No worries, UPST is way too strong of stock, it's balance sheets are too positive, and growth rates for the next 5 years is too great."
Shorts be like...
wow something really going on right ????
Love waking up Monday’s being a UPST holder 
Love UPST!! Did anyone see Motley Fool’s Article on UPST AND RSKD from earlier today titled:“If you like Upstart Holdings you’ll love this IPO” Riskified uses AI to reduce fraud while increasing sales.Any thoughts on RSKD?
Sideway Right Now And Will Drop More Tmr
correction 224.49
Two weeks back price target was raised from $120 to $230 and reached $228 today.
UPST on it's way to 300+ will have volatile moves. Enjoy the ride!
