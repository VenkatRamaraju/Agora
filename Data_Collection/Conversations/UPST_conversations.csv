"Can't wait for earnings, gonna be amazing!"
Have a great weekend Longs! Luv all! and Luv this Upstart Holdings!
UPST looks like it is about to drop. Be careful guys. I have been reading http://alert-sounds.com/ and their stocks have been doing way better.
"I’ve been here before with SHOP. No need to panic. An 11% drop without some kind of devastating news is quite extreme. I’m down $13,000+ today but will enjoy the ride back up to $400 before long. I just bought 50 more shares and will buy more if it dips again. If you’re smart you won’t sale under $400. Be patient"
Wells Fargo was on the podcast. Imagine the rocket ride when that gets announced... https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/customer-experience-nate-longfellow
"Some of the banks on the podcast: Flag Star, Lend Key, Unison, Liberty Bank (Connecticut), Credit Union National Association, PATELCO, Ohio Teamster's Credit Union, National Association of Federal Credit UNions, USAA, First Horizon Bank, WSFS, First Federal Bank of Kansas City... and lots more"
Futures are down after 2 tech behemoths missed earnings expectations. Today may be a bloodbath in the broader index. *Crosses Fingers* for the best
"In Japan, the Yoshinoya beef bowl will be raised by 39 yen. The price of potato chips will also increase by about 10%.uummm...... Inflation is starting quietly."
"so far so good, i think we are lagging the market, volume was down today, but that's good news for the earnings release. Keep the base at this level, then breakout for earnings."
"Hi Shareholders and Friends!Here are some reasons why UPST is a PROVEN QUALITY LONG-TERM INVESTMENT - to hold forever:Upstart is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) lending platform that partners with financial institutions to provide consumer loans using non-conventional variables such as education and employment to forecast credit worthiness.1• Upstart Holdings greatly benefits from the expertise and vast experiences of its outstanding executive leadership team including Ex-Googlers and Co-Founders Girouard, Gu, and Counselman, CFO Datta, other valuable engineering and business development leaders, and its capable staff. 2• Upstart Holdings is a new PROFITABLE (profit margin of 12.3%) business - without any debt -, that has consistently exceeded both revenue and earnings forecasts.3• “Four in five Americanshave never defaulted on a credit product, yet less than half have access to prime credit.” Thanks to Upstart’s smart credit model, lenders can now approve almost twice as many borrowers, with fewer defaults. (1)4• Upstart also yields 10% lower average APRs for approved loans. (2)5• The AI approval process is done almost instantly.6• in addition, Upstart Holdings acquired last March Prodigy Software because it seeks to develop other vertical markets such as the multi-trillion dollar car loan market.7• in my humble opinion, Upstart Holdings’ business plan is sound and intelligent because it aims to quickly and efficiently capture new growth, expand loan opportunities with new and existing Customers, while developing New Vertical Markets!8• Aside from the numerous reputable financial institutions and fine investors ( see major holders on Yahoo! Finance ), Upstart initially raised capital from valuable investors such as First Round Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, New Enterprise Associates, Google Ventures, Crunchfund, Mark Cuban, Eric Schmidt (Google Executive Chairman), Marc Benioff, Khosla Ventures, Founders Fund, Collaborative Fund, Rakuten as well as The Progressive Corporation .9• in summary, Upstart Holdings offers a simple, unique Quality, Cost, and Time-Efficient Loan Solution for 2021 and the next decades - with a sound plan to consistently capture new untapped loan opportunities, consistently develop new vertical markets such as the multi-trillion-dollar car loan market, with a user-friendly website and with the necessary financial backing to be successful! How can it go wrong?(1) (2) Upstart Holdings websiteHow would you like to own numerous shares of this Valuable Proven UPST - BEFORE its price rises again?"
 Hi Longs! I believe that The Beast will be RISING to $365 today! I wish everyone a  day!
don't sell it will bounce back
We all know it was going to climb back up  all part of the game. Drop the price and buy more shares right before earnings. Less than 2 weeks away. Keep your eye on the prize 
"OK, so if a company adopts Upstart's system, and that results in a 75% (hypothetical number) higher loan approval rate, do the *analysts* account for that in their calculations? Hypothetically, if a bank is doing 100 million dollars in loans, and then with Upstart, they do 175 million in loans, is that accounted for in these analysts projections? Is it possible that all of the analysts projections are low? They haven't taken the Upstart Effect into account..."
"Hi Longs and Smart Long-Term Investors,Let’s have a meaningful conversation!Please tell us the REASONS WHY you invested and/or are currently investing in UPST."
"Yes, yes, yes!! There are rumors that UPST will announce a partnership with Flagstar Bank which has $30B+ in assets. The bank was discussed in Upstart for Lenders podcast channel. Also. UPST's announcement with Four Corners Community Bank was a partnership since July 2021, which tells us there are other bank partnerships that haven't been announced yet!!"
"Hi Longs!Despite recent analyst’s estimates, I will NOT sell even one single share of UPST because this new enterprise has had a repeated PROFITABLE proven-track record - incredibly RARE and INEXISTENT among new IPOs.This year, I invested, per ten (10 ) analysts‘ estimates and forecasts, and lost 50% of my principal because, unfortunately, ALL analysts were mistaken. I will not mention the 2 stocks for which same sad story applies because I believe that same two (2) companies do NOT deserve any FREE publicity.However, Upstart Holdings rightfully deserves accolades. Do NOT sell away your VALUED UPST shares and let a  or a  control your profits. UPST is the Google of Finance, which will trade in the $1,000 in a couple years or sooner.As a result, many Americans will now, thanks to Upstart, be able to afford a car and drive to their workplace - without undergoing any drastic and economic change in their career and lifestyles ( such as an expensive house sale, relocation, career change as a result of a relocation because a financial institution could not approve a SMALL loan - simply based on FICO scores ).In this respect, Upstart Holdings is contributing to reducing the current labor shortage.Congratulations UPST!In my opinion, that is a game changer. Wouldn’t you agree?Great opportunity TODAY to add more shares at a discount rate!(1) Upstart Holdings website"

"Buy UPST stock and hold it long term, it's a no brainer money profiting decision. You don't trade UPST, you hold it for a long time and let it grow, just like UPST's profits and revenues do."
