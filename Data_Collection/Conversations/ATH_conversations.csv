"‘Crazy’ Bets on $200 Oil Invade the Options MarketTraders are wagering U.S. crude’s rally to a seven-year high is just the beginning, despite a softening global economic expansionThe bullish trading amounts to a gamble that supply-chain disruptions and regional shortages will keep pushing energy markets higher.PHOTO: LUKE SHARRETT/BLOOMBERG NEWSBy Gunjan BanerjiOct. 17, 2021 5:30 am ETA roaring trade in bullish crude-oil options says the 2021 energy rally is far from over.Traders once again are betting that the U.S. oil benchmark will surge above $100 a barrel, from a recent $82, as early as December. U.S. crude, known as West Texas Intermediate or WTI, is up 10% this month, and 70% this year, but it hasn’t hit $100 since the oil crash of 2014.Wagers across the Atlantic are even more aggressive. Some traders are betting Brent crude, the global benchmark, will hit a record high of $200 a barrel by December 2022, according to data from provider QuikStrike. Options give investors the right to buy or sell at a stated price by a certain date. Traders typically use options to make directional bets or to hedge their portfolios.The bullish trading amounts to a gamble that supply-chain disruptions and regional shortages will keep pushing energy markets higher, despite a slowing global economic expansion and concerns that higher oil and natural-gas prices will crimp consumer spending. The wagers also show that investors drawn by the small upfront investments and potentially quick payoffs of options trades are piling into energy markets, echoing trades in the stock market this year.$BTE $OXY $CPE $RIG $OIH $SU $XOM $CVX $VET $EOG $CNQ $LPI $CLR $CDEV $CPG $ATH $CNQ $USO"

"Ok...I read the article in detail. It looks like a cut and paste article from many previous articles. This was a direct attack on the company. I have always said NVAX is a soft target, so politico feels they can do this. Most importantly, the fact this has happened now, can only mean we are going to an ATH.The Head of PR, gave them minimal information. This is PR 101, they will need to mobilize with rest of the C-Suite and BoD to provide a more detail response. In the event, that NVAX stays silent...Worse comes to worse this will be resolved when the EUAs are submitted. I am not losing any sleep over this. Remember, John T. and Glenn all manufacturing issues resolves, assays methods validated-we are confident in testing previous batches, and all EUAs submitted in Oct. I don’t believe they would lie and risk going to jail. I am trusting my intuition and holding. #ATH #STRONG."
