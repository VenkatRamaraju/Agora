"Assumptions and expectations in names like CNP, VST, NRG and other in the Texas energy space to reduce Dividend payouts for remaining of 2021 to preserve cash and obtain more variable rates in upcoming much needed convertible bond issuances. Coming a lot clearer now that the state of Texas is not looking to resolve. Companies like VST code to a Dividend cut from 17 cents to 05 cents and a company like NRG could see it's dividend return back to .05 per share. Only in 2020 did they raise the dividend but do to URI dividends are on the table."
Great report for NRG once again. They have unlocked value for shareholders in last 18 months. More buybacks. I got in at $11 in 2016 and one of my top holdings.
Panic in - time to load
Good buying opportunity today. I bought some on the dip.
"I still think BP taken a majority stake in NRG or even a outright take over for 15 Billion is very possible here. BP is locking at purchasing a large U.S Electric power provider and NRG logistically it's profile the best from both a retail and consumer perspective. This is something BP wants to close fast, they are not going to wait until NRG is back in the 40's to steal the premium incentive. I'm thinking we see $50 to $55 a share by June 18th."
NRG press release indicates they are in good position to weather storm!
time to buy
Thinking about picking up some shares of NRG today. what yall thank?
The analyst at Morgan Stanley maintained a Buy rating for NRG on Tuesday with a $50 price target.
There is no denying that the one who manipulates this action is a good manipulator. I'm doing very well! Always upload it step by step and consistently with a little money. Congratulations!
"They did a great job burying the ""one time costs"" of Uri. VST could have learned a thing or two."
Some ginormous sells AH.
Planning to fail.
I used to work for NRG was buy this stock at 7 when people that worked with me told me never to invest where you worked! Haha
So the direct energy deal should close on Jan 5th 2021 now. Everything has been approved. Will we see a nice bump up before then or on the 5th? https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nrg-receives-ferc-approval-direct-140500262.html
"Ok, it may take a month or Two, to begin the climb up the stairs..but I'm starting a position, and will average down it dips. If starts to go up, I will add on the dips. It works .."
I'm no expert but it looks like the current support is at 32.00 and the resistance at 32.18 during this time of consolidation. If it breaks 32.20 (for more than a single bid) it could break up another 50 cents until another testing period.
"If Atmos Energy $ATO had to buy back 2.5bil-3.5bil of power when it was pegged at 9k MW/h, I expect $NRG had to have done the same; 33% of the market cap would be the minimum. $NRG is lucky ERCOT saved their #$%$ and killed the grid, and possibly saved them from Chapter 11, but is still not out of the question. Can't wait to hear management squirm on their DELAYED earnings LOL"
"I just saw the fiscal graph of NRG cash reverses increasing from 2019-20. It's insane, they have nearly $4 billion in cash reserves, but liquidity ratio a slight risk. You can read into their company @ecoshares on Instagram, they cover on climate change related firms."
I wish people wouldn't sell! The story of stock's. This is a hot stock right now that I can only see with positive momentum over the next few weeks.
"Spke (spark energy) got crushed today. NRG's competition. Announced 65 million hit from uri and yet they only have about 50,000 RCE's in ERCOT.NRG and VST should get the upside longer term."
"March 25th is a very significant day for all entities within ERCOT. Soon thereafter news will come about who is paying who for February business. Settlement day!Settlement day for February 2021 will become to be known as settlement decade. Lawsuits, bankruptcies and the unknowns associated with such a tragic performance event.Stay tuned."
"Yesterday (3/18) wasn't to bad aye? DO NOT SELL, I WILL GLADLY BUY YOUR LOSES to a certain extent.Few more days of volatility, then the slow process to recovery.I was comparing NRG to VST. By numbers VST looks good or better. Of particular interest is the EPS Next FY. VST: P/E: 14, P/CF: 3.3, Debt to Capitol: 54, EPS Growth CFY: -54%, EPS NEXT FY: +225%NRG: P/E: 18, P/CF: 8.3, Debt to Capitol: 84, EPS Growth CFY: +165%, EPS NEXT FY: +8%VST management including the president Mr. James Burke purchased company shares of approximately 1 million USD. I realize these guys probably make 15 million USD per annum, and its a drop in the bucket for them.I am thinking of making a 80/20 split between VST / NRG. Thoughts of seasoned utility share holders??I am getting clobbered at RYCEF, hopefully this will offset that."
"The other things about Warren Buffets team yesterday that should but to rest some posters comments. We say the likes of VST and other Texas energy producers rise yesterday also because, some of the bears felt that updating or winterizing the grid as they called it would be costly. We'll now we are seeing tons of outside energy suppliers coming up with proposed emergency power solutions, All will need to be reviewed by Texas, but just the influx of such solutions has taken a lot of pressure off the Energy Producers. The only Risks I see here is in order to get it's foot in the door of the Texas market Warren may spend $20Billion here and try to grab one of the small cap energy producers. He likes companies that Brand things well like stadiums and things. So may options Warren and others have tossed out. All actually great for firms like NRG."
happy dance +13%
"As predicted, investors needed to look past headlines and go deeper on the execution of their plan. They have done great so far."
"took a look. Yeap no Class Actions because it appears the items were fully disclosed: Titled the Estimated Impact. Thus, estimates are to be taken as such, as outlined in Forward Looking Statement Disclaimers. They have now come forward and but more color to the estimates largely based on what they are seeing from ERCOT. ERCOT is actually looking at Clawing Back any losses for any members if it can more to come.The estimated financial impact is still preliminary, due to customer meter and settlement data not being finalized, as well as potential customer and counterparty risk and expected ERCOT default allocations. Based on a preliminary analysis, Winter Storm Uri’s financial impact is expected to be within NRG’s current guidance range. The Company separately stress-tested assumptions and although at a lower probability, this stress-test analysis indicated a potential plus or minus $100 million to guidance ranges. NRG’s integrated platform continues to deliver stable results through unprecedented events."
NRG website press release indicates they have weathered this Texas storm !
"Buy, electricity is the power source of the future......don’t look a gift horse in the mouth. Yield plus appreciation potential ......definitely growth. Huge drop forced selling its over........"
Nice technical breakout on NRG. Hopefully it sticks
I'm expecting this to start moving once the direct energy deal is done. The end of 2020 can't get here fast enough.
I really want to see which person manipulates this action all day in the same way every day as in a book. I plan to write to the stock exchange for this case to see day by day who trades this stock.
"So they now say $700 Million which is most likely $400 million higher then what they will realize. We all knew it could not be $100 Million, given the losses VST and XEL experienced. Thus, Impact is really NIL and with $3.5 Billion in Liquidity and a good hot summer coming in Texas. We should get back to the Mid 40's by year-end easily as all of NRG Commercial lines come back on line as we move out of the pandemic."
I’m betting on NRG to see increase in share value in 2019
Accumulating more shares today. Thanks for the discount sellers.

way undervalued
Why the giant selloff? They are executing their plan flawlessly.
The reason why the lawyers will stay away is because ERCOT is a regulatory body. It would be like the Regulators suing the Regulators.
20s
Highly undervalued stock. The recently announced dividend may give it the push it needs... maybe $36 by the end of the week??
NRG Energy is up 6.18% to 40.87
HB4492 has been signed by Governor Abbot. Effective immediately. Huge good news for NRG and VST.
"Caught with their pants down, it will get worse before it gets better."
"NRG unlike VST may have taken a overly conservative approach when accessing the impact of the Texas February winter storm. It appears VST came right out the gate and estimated that it might lose in the $1.2 Billion to $1.5 billion range. Yet NRG cited during it's review some type of historical risk assessment on what there loses may be. If the losses are going to be a bit more material then they thought they need to make announcements soon to avoid any Class Actions. I think that's what is driving NRG down at this point. More detail and clarification on the Feb Winter Storm Impact needs to be released to the public, especially when so many other major's in the Texas space and surrounding area's are communicating significant losses. Heck, Energy stock not even in Texas like XEL, is stating that consumers in Colorado will see a $264.00 bill per household just due to the N Gas Demand and going to market for the N Gas during the same Feb Winter event. Also, damage assessments regarding water damage and lawsuits to numerous to count are piling up. It may just be best to give Texas some time to sort it all out."
"Trying to understand price movement, is there any justification for this being above $20?$19B in debt and losing almost $1B last yearBV per share (MRQ) 5.14Tangible BV per share (MRQ) -3.14So why is it up here, and is there any reason to buy thinking it will go higher?"
"brutal. i saw this gimmering train flying across the terrain. I decided to board the train known as NRG in early decemeber. Since then the train has fallen off the track. Consolidation after a big year? Bigger issues? I'm not seeing any but any help, ideas or info would be nice. thanks"
I just bought 500 shares on the panic drop down. Nobody should be selling this. 7 analysts give a Buy rating on this stock.
NRG heading to 50. solid .jg
Displaying upside momentum. Technical looks good according to stoxline. Long over 29.61 for a run up to 34.58.
"interesting.. posted in BP news yesterday.. Street Color: BP Reportedly Seeks to Enter US Retail Electricity Business, Financial Times — 12:11 PM ET 04/26/202. MidCap Firms close to their Natural Gas assets. who VST OR NRG Both with $8 Billion market caps. BP is said to have some $13 billion in capital asset sales coming. VST A Single state where NRG brings diversity. Either case BP'S natural gas assets in Texas can take a lot of Risk out of Texas power generation in the future,"
"power utilities will become increasingly valuable as more homes move towards electric vehicles. no matter which EV wins, tesla ford xpeng nio lucid rivian etc, the power utilities will gain from it. the best part is they are still fairly valued while most EV companies have skyrocketing price/earnings years ahead of schedule"
Time for a 3 to 1 split. And then grow.
Looks like I was right and everyone that gave me a thumbs down was wrong. Maybe you’ll listen to me next time.
Just profit taking and the big ice storm in texas. Ignore the short seller BS.
"As far as lawsuits doubt you will see any. Reason being during the Earnings Conference call they very clearly stated that they could not estimate and only gave a flavor on what their Risk Assessment ranges at the time looked like. Also, during an event deemed a Federal Emergency and National Emergency I've never seen a single Class stand under those circumstances. Much more of a Risk that a Small Cap Firm like NRG under 8 Billion may actually be ripe for a Takeover at any price below $14 billion. Like VST and a lot others are going to be bought out in the next few months."
2021 dividend has already been pre-announced in the investor presentation. Increasing to $1.30/share.
"Proud of all you longs in here! I'm up 37%, never selling!"
Hmm what do you guys see for the future value of nrg?
This will drop to low 30's. I will gladly pick some up there.
All power producing facilities now need to be winterized and will cost these utilities to do the renovations. This will be on top of the cost for power during the cold snap and settlements for those who died and suffered outages. The big question should be is will this company be able to recover the losses from these problems? I would think that they could recover the costs of winterizing but the cold snap will hit the bottom line and hurt their balance sheet.
Almost hit $43 today. The 1 month chart looks amazing on this stock. Remember ex-dividend date is 4 days away so if you want to get the dividend don't wait to long. This is going to 60!

Afew more bucks down and I Will be buying more

NRG is a great company. Their utility rates are extremely competitive and they offer so incentives to join them. Solid company with excellent customer service.
we are all over the place today! let's push 38!
"I know P/E and EPS dont matter to anyone anymore, but this company has some really strong numbers. I feel like it's very underbought. I just loaded up on some shares this morning, hopefully I'm not just buying hype :0"
Vistra is down 20% today. 1B loss for the storm loses . That’s a ton of money. Any idea how all this will affect NRG when reporting earnings?
Sold last week and bought back this morning. NRG under-reacted and now is over-reacting to compensate. Perfect buying opportunity.
Stock buy back confirmed
Very strange P/E is temporarily inflated from 4Q of 2019 .which was reported in 02/27/20. $12.83 /share. Normally for last several years its maybe a dollar if you averaged it. What was this unique spike from? . In some ways this is lucky as most other energy stocks with similar characteristics are trading for much less or getting desisted
"Tod, I have worked for this company and it’s norm is to climb now till about feb or March"
Still super hot in Texas stock should be going up.
$NRG off for unhedgable and just bad luck with this catastrophe. I believe the main issue is their STP nuke went out on the 15th. That’s a short at 5 days of $7000 power x 24 hours x 1200 MW. $1billion. Plus the retail exposure doesn’t help. But none of this is certain bc they have yet to release any sort of press release. They need to explain what’s going on
Still positive cash flow for the year despite the $700 million losses. NRG is even expected to lower its debt to income ratio as it was able to absorb the losses. This is GREAT NEWS! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alexander-funding-trust-moodys-affirms-191414987.html
NRG Energy is up 5.57% to 32.97
So why is this trading at such a low p/e? Their finances seem okay ..
How can a utility have 40%+ 5yr earnings growth? What justifies that growth prediction?
bit expensive and no dividend
I have been watching this action for three months. It is manipulated in the same way every day. And at the end of the day he always goes to work. Here a person manipulates it daily in the same way. I hope some regulator to refer.
"Is this really such a great thing, gutting this company?Has it still got some upside, or does it slide down from here?"
"Before anyone asks tomorrow, it's ex-dividend day so the price will drop .30 before open. No you don't get the dividend if you buy tomorrow."
"Just Energy (jengq) just announced another $48,000,000 hit in additional ercot expenses resulting from ercot's ufe calculations. Just Energy is just one of a ton of players within ercot - if they got hit with 48mm in ufe, the market wide ufe may be over a billion. And guess who is on the other side of that cost? The generation divisions of NRG, VST, Calpine... will make a killing and should offset, to a large extent, the ufe share of their retail load divisions. It depends also on how long these generators were bilaterally, too."
any idea why this is down 5% today? cannot find news
"The manipulation of this company is so great that the manipulator could lift it higher than Amazon and quickly lower it, but it would make an impression. I guess he trades it himself and the regulators have to report a crime."
"Should have just been straight from the get go. Said impact was immaterial and it was not. It happens, but when management downplays it you have to question if they should go. Compare to VST that provided full disclosure right out of the blocks. Can’t change the weather, can change the leadership."
"What is that 4-5 consecutive days with no pullback? I know i ain't selling. Up 35%, big whoop!"
NRG Energy is up 4.95% to 41.77
"I want the regulatory authorities to contact and check this single digger and seller of NRG Energy, I think this is completely illegal and bad for the company itself!"
buying opportunity
Ive done some research on this company and it seems for a utility company they are not very stable with everything that has happen in their past. I dont know if I should buy in?
"Everything Warren does is cool a calculated with minimal Risk. It's why Firms like NRG could get taken over for $50.00 a share, by someone who wants in the Texas market with minimal Risk."
I bought in at 35 and loving it! I believe in this company to do great things for us!!
is this still a buy at $41?
"No company will sell forwards contracts for electricity without being hedged. Typically, a power company will buy forward gas for a price, multiply that by the market heat rate and come up with a good price to sell that power before it contracts with retail buyers. NRG certainly did this, without doubt. Only open question is how much hedged were they. Typically they would hedge up to 90% of the projected demand. Don't believe everything in the gloom and doom scenarios people are spewing."
The lawsuits have started and retailer is not paying.... Please confirm but nrg's current position is that they will win every lawsuit... this will be an anchor on the stock for 2 years not good
"Knock, Knock!Who’s There?Orange.Orange who?Orange you glad I told you to buy this when it was below $31/share."
"First time on the NRG board. I always wanted to get into the utility business, as they say, the utility business + dividends = “Steady Eddie”. Ha, ha but that was not the case on 3/17/2021.This cumulative -17.5% ($-7.7) decrease of NRG value over the past two days, has been the greatest since the Covid 19 fiasco of March 2020, of -45% (-$17.9) over the course of 25 days. All the other significant reduction has been in the range of 5 to 13% ($-4).Just hang in there, couple more days of going negative: DO NOT SELL. Couple more days of vultures hanging over head of a wounded animal, just waiting to buy your loses. I joined the party today at $37.2, and plan to buy the dip to a certain extent.Hopefully the next global recession doesn’t tomorrow.Now I need to figure out what this company does to generate net positive cash flow. This drop had something to do with winterization costs."
"So what do you roll back into EPS. ? Well you make your earnings release announcement and unlike VST, you don't add anymore bad news to the story. So You at first estimated $100 million of URI losses, then you say $700 million, means the real number was like $650million? Then you have the first Glimpse at what Direct Energy's 3 million customers bring to the NRG bottom line and for sure a short squeeze and puts party is in the making... It clearly , the future should take NRG into the $40's as we watch Buffet and BP."
"Upgrade today, good pre market!"
"NRG is one of the few stocks of mine up today. Forecast of $52 for a high, $40 for a low. how can you lose money here? By selling on a dip of course, but that is your own fault. Stay long and strong. 7 more days till the merger."
How are these guys trading so low? They have great recurring committed customer base (even if you assume that 20% of the customers are out due to the recession...their P/E and dividend yield is great). Utilities are one of the last things they would shut off....what do you think?
Only 2% of their energy portfolio is renewables. Not a good hedge if Biden wins.
$37 and under...I may get in. Texas issues hangs over this stock for now.
NRG is up 5.41% to 41.72
Why this jump today?
gotta love de regulation.
"If you own NRG, you should hedge with VST as well. Both can make money, especially if forward yields pick up."
NRG Energy reached a 52 Week high at 40.66
I’m buying back in now.
Nothing Can help this..
"By requiring publicly traded companies to disclose ESG metrics to the SEC and shareholders, H.R. 1187 would impose a private-sector mandate as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). The mandate’s costs would equal the expenses incurred by those companies to comply with the new disclosure requirement. Because the SEC has not issued the rules required by the bill, CBO cannot determine whether the cost would exceed the private-sector threshold established in UMRA ($170 million in 2021, adjusted annually for inflation)."
when is the next ex-dividend date? anyone?
Bull market coming soon
well someone picked up a million shares on the cheap today:)
Does anyone have a objective assessment of how bad this weather in Texas is for the operations of NRG? I see the risk to having to pay for energy at inflated prices versus what it was sold at. I would like to hear views on how much they will lose from this dynamic? I can’t imagine it being good.
great after hours! This will go bigger in pre market!
It should be traded around $44.
NRG Energy reached a 52 Week high at 41.41
NRG is up 4.94% to 26.77
People trying to short this and scare you to sell because of a little snow storm. I hope they lose big time! I hate shorts!

Got some spare cash still a buy for tuesday morning?
New High Today
.87 cents a share vs .04 consensus. 1b share buyback. paying down 600mm debt. stock going to $50 this year
I’ll do some easy math for you. 1 year ago they were trading at $22 with profit margins that were 4X what they had this year. All those margins were just evaporated!
NRG Energy is up 5.29% to 41.96
"Why is it going only down, no green days"
NRG Energy reached a 52 Week high at 43.38
"The ERCOT independent market monitor is recommending retroactively capping ancillary service fees at $9,000/mwh. Does anyone have insight into how large this ancillary service market is and who the big players are, long and short?"

I’m glad I bought all those cheap shares. Anyone else want to sell?
Should I wait till earnings to buy this stock?
why does this stock have such low PE ratio? Is the earning expected to go down in the next year?

"Nice green day, trending upward at last. Wish i bought more at 28.50. Expecting green from now till next year boy!"
It could be cooling off now. Only about a 20 cent pop after the last consolidation. HOD 32.46 and is testing around 32.42 resistance.
The entire utility complex got slammed today so NRGs performance wasn't that different. I dont believe we have a California situation that was compounded by Enron that wreaked havoc on PCG and to a lesser extent EIX. NRG investors will have some anxiety until the financial impact of the winter weather becomes evident. Some puts might take the edge off...
"Not looking forward to upcoming earnings report, looks likethis is still losing money?PE Ratio (TTM) -8.45EPS (TTM) -2.98... but hopefully can improve a little?Not sure what to make of the ""transformation"" plan.Might work somewhat short term?"
Here trading and analysis of financial statements is not just manipulation by players on the platform. The whole energy sector is falling it is rising. The company's reports are worse than the previous ones despite the increase in revenue.
Just as it was not easy to estimate URI estimated loss. It's going to be equally as hard to estimate the revenue boom NRG is going to receive no matter what rate factor is used to factor consumer MWPH Costs and Delivery Costs. It will be like an extra two months of revenue coming in. NRG is going to reside someplace between $45 and $56 per share by July 2021.
"Not surprised that NRG stock has tripled in the last 3 years. Their profits come mostly from scamming consumers. They send reps around to sign people up to use NRG as supplier, showing a lower rate. Then a few months later, BAM! They double the rate. of course they do this without any notice. to And the only way the consumer finds out is by looking at the fine print on the bill, and comparing the rate paid versus the default rate. I am sure these overcharges are the reason for the high profits and CEO pay and bonuses."
"Long, long, long in this company. Can't wait to see how they do after the direct energy acquisition."
NRG to 38 tomorrow! A lot of buzz in energy sector and NRG will show. Great options price with 38$ call Jan 8. Especially for the merger!
this is a bad day
Good news. NRG sent me a email that states that I can drive my car and stay in my own house GUILT FREE if I just send them $4.50 per month and they will flip a switch to offset all my carbon emissions!!! SIGN ME UP...for this croc of s..t
"Selling wind and solar assets. Quarterly and Annual Revenue and Ebitda both down from previous quarter and year. Now share buy back. I invested in this company, they went back on what they stood for. Glad to have sold my 1 share."
NRG Energy is up 4.92% to 39.24
Whats going on this morning ?
"Well, not good news for the short term, but long term they will do ok and continue to get rid of their debt. Good time to buy on the dip."
To commenters below: have you seen premarket price?
Another P/E mystery. Why are companies with P/E 6 thru 25 being punished while P/E 200 and negatives are rewarded?
"NRG may be tapped out for the day. If you are long it is still a good hold. If it is a day or swing trade now may be the time to exit. I was in at 31.44 and out at 32.44 (should have followed my instincts and jumped at 32.60, but that 32.76 bid had me thinking it might explode up despite how it had slowed down)."
I missed the opportunity with first energy when it went below $20. Glad I learnt from my mistake and bought into NRG…. It’s fast approaching a Elliott wave 3
"Don't the companies carry ""insurance"" for this kind of event??"
