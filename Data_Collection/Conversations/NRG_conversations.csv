Highly undervalued stock. The recently announced dividend may give it the push it needs... maybe $36 by the end of the week??
I really want to see which person manipulates this action all day in the same way every day as in a book. I plan to write to the stock exchange for this case to see day by day who trades this stock.
The analyst at Morgan Stanley maintained a Buy rating for NRG on Tuesday with a $50 price target.
Accumulating more shares today. Thanks for the discount sellers.
Whats going on this morning ?
I just bought 500 shares on the panic drop down. Nobody should be selling this. 7 analysts give a Buy rating on this stock.
Here trading and analysis of financial statements is not just manipulation by players on the platform. The whole energy sector is falling it is rising. The company's reports are worse than the previous ones despite the increase in revenue.
"I still think BP taken a majority stake in NRG or even a outright take over for 15 Billion is very possible here. BP is locking at purchasing a large U.S Electric power provider and NRG logistically it's profile the best from both a retail and consumer perspective. This is something BP wants to close fast, they are not going to wait until NRG is back in the 40's to steal the premium incentive. I'm thinking we see $50 to $55 a share by June 18th."
"Assumptions and expectations in names like CNP, VST, NRG and other in the Texas energy space to reduce Dividend payouts for remaining of 2021 to preserve cash and obtain more variable rates in upcoming much needed convertible bond issuances. Coming a lot clearer now that the state of Texas is not looking to resolve. Companies like VST code to a Dividend cut from 17 cents to 05 cents and a company like NRG could see it's dividend return back to .05 per share. Only in 2020 did they raise the dividend but do to URI dividends are on the table."
All power producing facilities now need to be winterized and will cost these utilities to do the renovations. This will be on top of the cost for power during the cold snap and settlements for those who died and suffered outages. The big question should be is will this company be able to recover the losses from these problems? I would think that they could recover the costs of winterizing but the cold snap will hit the bottom line and hurt their balance sheet.
There is no denying that the one who manipulates this action is a good manipulator. I'm doing very well! Always upload it step by step and consistently with a little money. Congratulations!
Vistra is down 20% today. 1B loss for the storm loses . That’s a ton of money. Any idea how all this will affect NRG when reporting earnings?
"The manipulation of this company is so great that the manipulator could lift it higher than Amazon and quickly lower it, but it would make an impression. I guess he trades it himself and the regulators have to report a crime."
2021 dividend has already been pre-announced in the investor presentation. Increasing to $1.30/share.
Just as it was not easy to estimate URI estimated loss. It's going to be equally as hard to estimate the revenue boom NRG is going to receive no matter what rate factor is used to factor consumer MWPH Costs and Delivery Costs. It will be like an extra two months of revenue coming in. NRG is going to reside someplace between $45 and $56 per share by July 2021.
"I just saw the fiscal graph of NRG cash reverses increasing from 2019-20. It's insane, they have nearly $4 billion in cash reserves, but liquidity ratio a slight risk. You can read into their company @ecoshares on Instagram, they cover on climate change related firms."
"I want the regulatory authorities to contact and check this single digger and seller of NRG Energy, I think this is completely illegal and bad for the company itself!"
"interesting.. posted in BP news yesterday.. Street Color: BP Reportedly Seeks to Enter US Retail Electricity Business, Financial Times — 12:11 PM ET 04/26/202. MidCap Firms close to their Natural Gas assets. who VST OR NRG Both with $8 Billion market caps. BP is said to have some $13 billion in capital asset sales coming. VST A Single state where NRG brings diversity. Either case BP'S natural gas assets in Texas can take a lot of Risk out of Texas power generation in the future,"
Great report for NRG once again. They have unlocked value for shareholders in last 18 months. More buybacks. I got in at $11 in 2016 and one of my top holdings.
"No company will sell forwards contracts for electricity without being hedged. Typically, a power company will buy forward gas for a price, multiply that by the market heat rate and come up with a good price to sell that power before it contracts with retail buyers. NRG certainly did this, without doubt. Only open question is how much hedged were they. Typically they would hedge up to 90% of the projected demand. Don't believe everything in the gloom and doom scenarios people are spewing."
