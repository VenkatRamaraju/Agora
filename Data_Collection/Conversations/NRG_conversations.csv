Should I buy? Or too late?
NRG Energy is up 15.89% to 42.31
"First time on the NRG board. I always wanted to get into the utility business, as they say, the utility business + dividends = “Steady Eddie”. Ha, ha but that was not the case on 3/17/2021.This cumulative -17.5% ($-7.7) decrease of NRG value over the past two days, has been the greatest since the Covid 19 fiasco of March 2020, of -45% (-$17.9) over the course of 25 days. All the other significant reduction has been in the range of 5 to 13% ($-4).Just hang in there, couple more days of going negative: DO NOT SELL. Couple more days of vultures hanging over head of a wounded animal, just waiting to buy your loses. I joined the party today at $37.2, and plan to buy the dip to a certain extent.Hopefully the next global recession doesn’t tomorrow.Now I need to figure out what this company does to generate net positive cash flow. This drop had something to do with winterization costs."

Why the giant selloff? They are executing their plan flawlessly.
"Yesterday (3/18) wasn't to bad aye? DO NOT SELL, I WILL GLADLY BUY YOUR LOSES to a certain extent.Few more days of volatility, then the slow process to recovery.I was comparing NRG to VST. By numbers VST looks good or better. Of particular interest is the EPS Next FY. VST: P/E: 14, P/CF: 3.3, Debt to Capitol: 54, EPS Growth CFY: -54%, EPS NEXT FY: +225%NRG: P/E: 18, P/CF: 8.3, Debt to Capitol: 84, EPS Growth CFY: +165%, EPS NEXT FY: +8%VST management including the president Mr. James Burke purchased company shares of approximately 1 million USD. I realize these guys probably make 15 million USD per annum, and its a drop in the bucket for them.I am thinking of making a 80/20 split between VST / NRG. Thoughts of seasoned utility share holders??I am getting clobbered at RYCEF, hopefully this will offset that."
I wish people wouldn't sell! The story of stock's. This is a hot stock right now that I can only see with positive momentum over the next few weeks.
Does anyone have a objective assessment of how bad this weather in Texas is for the operations of NRG? I see the risk to having to pay for energy at inflated prices versus what it was sold at. I would like to hear views on how much they will lose from this dynamic? I can’t imagine it being good.
"Everything Warren does is cool a calculated with minimal Risk. It's why Firms like NRG could get taken over for $50.00 a share, by someone who wants in the Texas market with minimal Risk."
"By requiring publicly traded companies to disclose ESG metrics to the SEC and shareholders, H.R. 1187 would impose a private-sector mandate as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). The mandate’s costs would equal the expenses incurred by those companies to comply with the new disclosure requirement. Because the SEC has not issued the rules required by the bill, CBO cannot determine whether the cost would exceed the private-sector threshold established in UMRA ($170 million in 2021, adjusted annually for inflation)."
How are these guys trading so low? They have great recurring committed customer base (even if you assume that 20% of the customers are out due to the recession...their P/E and dividend yield is great). Utilities are one of the last things they would shut off....what do you think?
"NRG is one of the few stocks of mine up today. Forecast of $52 for a high, $40 for a low. how can you lose money here? By selling on a dip of course, but that is your own fault. Stay long and strong. 7 more days till the merger."
Here trading and analysis of financial statements is not just manipulation by players on the platform. The whole energy sector is falling it is rising. The company's reports are worse than the previous ones despite the increase in revenue.
"took a look. Yeap no Class Actions because it appears the items were fully disclosed: Titled the Estimated Impact. Thus, estimates are to be taken as such, as outlined in Forward Looking Statement Disclaimers. They have now come forward and but more color to the estimates largely based on what they are seeing from ERCOT. ERCOT is actually looking at Clawing Back any losses for any members if it can more to come.The estimated financial impact is still preliminary, due to customer meter and settlement data not being finalized, as well as potential customer and counterparty risk and expected ERCOT default allocations. Based on a preliminary analysis, Winter Storm Uri’s financial impact is expected to be within NRG’s current guidance range. The Company separately stress-tested assumptions and although at a lower probability, this stress-test analysis indicated a potential plus or minus $100 million to guidance ranges. NRG’s integrated platform continues to deliver stable results through unprecedented events."
Thinking about picking up some shares of NRG today. what yall thank?
NRG is a great company. Their utility rates are extremely competitive and they offer so incentives to join them. Solid company with excellent customer service.

"Also bought in at about 35, really never thought this would be one of best holdings. Wish I put in more instead of going into ENB with x-tra cash."
"Ok, it may take a month or Two, to begin the climb up the stairs..but I'm starting a position, and will average down it dips. If starts to go up, I will add on the dips. It works .."
"interesting.. posted in BP news yesterday.. Street Color: BP Reportedly Seeks to Enter US Retail Electricity Business, Financial Times — 12:11 PM ET 04/26/202. MidCap Firms close to their Natural Gas assets. who VST OR NRG Both with $8 Billion market caps. BP is said to have some $13 billion in capital asset sales coming. VST A Single state where NRG brings diversity. Either case BP'S natural gas assets in Texas can take a lot of Risk out of Texas power generation in the future,"
"They did a great job burying the ""one time costs"" of Uri. VST could have learned a thing or two."
I missed the opportunity with first energy when it went below $20. Glad I learnt from my mistake and bought into NRG…. It’s fast approaching a Elliott wave 3
well someone picked up a million shares on the cheap today:)
"I know P/E and EPS dont matter to anyone anymore, but this company has some really strong numbers. I feel like it's very underbought. I just loaded up on some shares this morning, hopefully I'm not just buying hype :0"
why does this stock have such low PE ratio? Is the earning expected to go down in the next year?
Vistra is down 20% today. 1B loss for the storm loses . That’s a ton of money. Any idea how all this will affect NRG when reporting earnings?
"Sorry, i shouldn't have bought in. Everything i buy tanks."
So why is this trading at such a low p/e? Their finances seem okay ..
Good news. NRG sent me a email that states that I can drive my car and stay in my own house GUILT FREE if I just send them $4.50 per month and they will flip a switch to offset all my carbon emissions!!! SIGN ME UP...for this croc of s..t
Some ginormous sells AH.
NRG Energy reached a 52 Week high at 40.66
$NRG off for unhedgable and just bad luck with this catastrophe. I believe the main issue is their STP nuke went out on the 15th. That’s a short at 5 days of $7000 power x 24 hours x 1200 MW. $1billion. Plus the retail exposure doesn’t help. But none of this is certain bc they have yet to release any sort of press release. They need to explain what’s going on
NRG website press release indicates they have weathered this Texas storm !
"If Atmos Energy $ATO had to buy back 2.5bil-3.5bil of power when it was pegged at 9k MW/h, I expect $NRG had to have done the same; 33% of the market cap would be the minimum. $NRG is lucky ERCOT saved their #$%$ and killed the grid, and possibly saved them from Chapter 11, but is still not out of the question. Can't wait to hear management squirm on their DELAYED earnings LOL"
The reason why the lawyers will stay away is because ERCOT is a regulatory body. It would be like the Regulators suing the Regulators.
"I just saw the fiscal graph of NRG cash reverses increasing from 2019-20. It's insane, they have nearly $4 billion in cash reserves, but liquidity ratio a slight risk. You can read into their company @ecoshares on Instagram, they cover on climate change related firms."
"The other things about Warren Buffets team yesterday that should but to rest some posters comments. We say the likes of VST and other Texas energy producers rise yesterday also because, some of the bears felt that updating or winterizing the grid as they called it would be costly. We'll now we are seeing tons of outside energy suppliers coming up with proposed emergency power solutions, All will need to be reviewed by Texas, but just the influx of such solutions has taken a lot of pressure off the Energy Producers. The only Risks I see here is in order to get it's foot in the door of the Texas market Warren may spend $20Billion here and try to grab one of the small cap energy producers. He likes companies that Brand things well like stadiums and things. So may options Warren and others have tossed out. All actually great for firms like NRG."
NRG Energy is up 6.18% to 40.87

"Buy PFEHigher Div. and price is going up.Also, the colder it gets, the less cost, lol."
gotta love de regulation.
well.. if there is any truth to the chatter and Najarian on CNBC the next few weeks may be interesting .. the most they may get for this debt ridden company is maybe 25..
I just added some more shares. Going to hold this long and see where it goes. Prepare for another big drop.
"Tod, I have worked for this company and it’s norm is to climb now till about feb or March"
Bull market coming soon
Going to $50!
we are all over the place today! let's push 38!
"Sold at 23.00 and 23.10, lucky. May get back in if it falls to 19+. Good luck longs."
More interesting question here is will Buffett make a move into Texas Retail Energy Market before BP given the numerous number of consulting henchmen they have on the ground. We shall see just don't be late to the party.
Nice technical breakout on NRG. Hopefully it sticks
NRG to 38 tomorrow! A lot of buzz in energy sector and NRG will show. Great options price with 38$ call Jan 8. Especially for the merger!
So the direct energy deal should close on Jan 5th 2021 now. Everything has been approved. Will we see a nice bump up before then or on the 5th? https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nrg-receives-ferc-approval-direct-140500262.html
"I still think BP taken a majority stake in NRG or even a outright take over for 15 Billion is very possible here. BP is locking at purchasing a large U.S Electric power provider and NRG logistically it's profile the best from both a retail and consumer perspective. This is something BP wants to close fast, they are not going to wait until NRG is back in the 40's to steal the premium incentive. I'm thinking we see $50 to $55 a share by June 18th."
great after hours! This will go bigger in pre market!
Afew more bucks down and I Will be buying more
"No company will sell forwards contracts for electricity without being hedged. Typically, a power company will buy forward gas for a price, multiply that by the market heat rate and come up with a good price to sell that power before it contracts with retail buyers. NRG certainly did this, without doubt. Only open question is how much hedged were they. Typically they would hedge up to 90% of the projected demand. Don't believe everything in the gloom and doom scenarios people are spewing."
Highly undervalued stock. The recently announced dividend may give it the push it needs... maybe $36 by the end of the week??
Whats going on this morning ?
People trying to short this and scare you to sell because of a little snow storm. I hope they lose big time! I hate shorts!
Came in at 10.97 thinking it was undervalued. Guess there was still some room to go down. Got my fingers crossed for a positive ER.
Let the lawsuits begin.
Ive done some research on this company and it seems for a utility company they are not very stable with everything that has happen in their past. I dont know if I should buy in?
It could be cooling off now. Only about a 20 cent pop after the last consolidation. HOD 32.46 and is testing around 32.42 resistance.
any idea why this is down 5% today? cannot find news
"The ERCOT independent market monitor is recommending retroactively capping ancillary service fees at $9,000/mwh. Does anyone have insight into how large this ancillary service market is and who the big players are, long and short?"

NRG Energy reached a 52 Week high at 42.15
The lawsuits have started and retailer is not paying.... Please confirm but nrg's current position is that they will win every lawsuit... this will be an anchor on the stock for 2 years not good
"The manipulation of this company is so great that the manipulator could lift it higher than Amazon and quickly lower it, but it would make an impression. I guess he trades it himself and the regulators have to report a crime."
"BP may be willing to offer uo to $55.00 per share, before the board meeting on May 5th. if Financial Times is correct and hey want into the U.S. Electricity Market quickly."
NRG reached a new 52 Week High at $37.04
It should be traded around $44.
"Proud of all you longs in here! I'm up 37%, never selling!"
bit expensive and no dividend
20s
Time for a 3 to 1 split. And then grow.
Great report for NRG once again. They have unlocked value for shareholders in last 18 months. More buybacks. I got in at $11 in 2016 and one of my top holdings.
Another P/E mystery. Why are companies with P/E 6 thru 25 being punished while P/E 200 and negatives are rewarded?
I’m glad I bought all those cheap shares. Anyone else want to sell?
All power producing facilities now need to be winterized and will cost these utilities to do the renovations. This will be on top of the cost for power during the cold snap and settlements for those who died and suffered outages. The big question should be is will this company be able to recover the losses from these problems? I would think that they could recover the costs of winterizing but the cold snap will hit the bottom line and hurt their balance sheet.
Zacks' target was 40. Looks like it's on its' way.
2021 dividend has already been pre-announced in the investor presentation. Increasing to $1.30/share.
NRG is up 4.91% to 27.13
"Not surprised that NRG stock has tripled in the last 3 years. Their profits come mostly from scamming consumers. They send reps around to sign people up to use NRG as supplier, showing a lower rate. Then a few months later, BAM! They double the rate. of course they do this without any notice. to And the only way the consumer finds out is by looking at the fine print on the bill, and comparing the rate paid versus the default rate. I am sure these overcharges are the reason for the high profits and CEO pay and bonuses."
"Don't the companies carry ""insurance"" for this kind of event??"
NRG Energy reached a 52 Week high at 43.38
HB4492 has been signed by Governor Abbot. Effective immediately. Huge good news for NRG and VST.
This will drop to low 30's. I will gladly pick some up there.
NRG press release indicates they are in good position to weather storm!
"Should have just been straight from the get go. Said impact was immaterial and it was not. It happens, but when management downplays it you have to question if they should go. Compare to VST that provided full disclosure right out of the blocks. Can’t change the weather, can change the leadership."
"March 25th is a very significant day for all entities within ERCOT. Soon thereafter news will come about who is paying who for February business. Settlement day!Settlement day for February 2021 will become to be known as settlement decade. Lawsuits, bankruptcies and the unknowns associated with such a tragic performance event.Stay tuned."
To commenters below: have you seen premarket price?
"Assumptions and expectations in names like CNP, VST, NRG and other in the Texas energy space to reduce Dividend payouts for remaining of 2021 to preserve cash and obtain more variable rates in upcoming much needed convertible bond issuances. Coming a lot clearer now that the state of Texas is not looking to resolve. Companies like VST code to a Dividend cut from 17 cents to 05 cents and a company like NRG could see it's dividend return back to .05 per share. Only in 2020 did they raise the dividend but do to URI dividends are on the table."

Got some spare cash still a buy for tuesday morning?
Why this jump today?
"If you own NRG, you should hedge with VST as well. Both can make money, especially if forward yields pick up."
NRG is down -5.03% to 24.08
"brutal. i saw this gimmering train flying across the terrain. I decided to board the train known as NRG in early decemeber. Since then the train has fallen off the track. Consolidation after a big year? Bigger issues? I'm not seeing any but any help, ideas or info would be nice. thanks"
when is the next ex-dividend date? anyone?
Nothing Can help this..
this is a bad day
Sold last week and bought back this morning. NRG under-reacted and now is over-reacting to compensate. Perfect buying opportunity.
is this still a buy at $41?

I have been watching this action for three months. It is manipulated in the same way every day. And at the end of the day he always goes to work. Here a person manipulates it daily in the same way. I hope some regulator to refer.
"Why does this stock do so terrible even though Charles Schwab gives it a ""B"" rating?"
Looks like NRG is turning things around.
Almost hit $43 today. The 1 month chart looks amazing on this stock. Remember ex-dividend date is 4 days away so if you want to get the dividend don't wait to long. This is going to 60!
"VST dropped 25% on great earnings, but up to a $1.3B hit. I wouldn't read into the earnings tomorrow and would instead look to the one time impairments."
"So what do you roll back into EPS. ? Well you make your earnings release announcement and unlike VST, you don't add anymore bad news to the story. So You at first estimated $100 million of URI losses, then you say $700 million, means the real number was like $650million? Then you have the first Glimpse at what Direct Energy's 3 million customers bring to the NRG bottom line and for sure a short squeeze and puts party is in the making... It clearly , the future should take NRG into the $40's as we watch Buffet and BP."
Accumulating more shares today. Thanks for the discount sellers.
"Well, not good news for the short term, but long term they will do ok and continue to get rid of their debt. Good time to buy on the dip."

Just profit taking and the big ice storm in texas. Ignore the short seller BS.
I'm no expert but it looks like the current support is at 32.00 and the resistance at 32.18 during this time of consolidation. If it breaks 32.20 (for more than a single bid) it could break up another 50 cents until another testing period.
Looks like I was right and everyone that gave me a thumbs down was wrong. Maybe you’ll listen to me next time.
How can a utility have 40%+ 5yr earnings growth? What justifies that growth prediction?

Only 2% of their energy portfolio is renewables. Not a good hedge if Biden wins.

Just Spam here. Any qualified thoughts here? Why this is pulling back?
Just as it was not easy to estimate URI estimated loss. It's going to be equally as hard to estimate the revenue boom NRG is going to receive no matter what rate factor is used to factor consumer MWPH Costs and Delivery Costs. It will be like an extra two months of revenue coming in. NRG is going to reside someplace between $45 and $56 per share by July 2021.
"NRG unlike VST may have taken a overly conservative approach when accessing the impact of the Texas February winter storm. It appears VST came right out the gate and estimated that it might lose in the $1.2 Billion to $1.5 billion range. Yet NRG cited during it's review some type of historical risk assessment on what there loses may be. If the losses are going to be a bit more material then they thought they need to make announcements soon to avoid any Class Actions. I think that's what is driving NRG down at this point. More detail and clarification on the Feb Winter Storm Impact needs to be released to the public, especially when so many other major's in the Texas space and surrounding area's are communicating significant losses. Heck, Energy stock not even in Texas like XEL, is stating that consumers in Colorado will see a $264.00 bill per household just due to the N Gas Demand and going to market for the N Gas during the same Feb Winter event. Also, damage assessments regarding water damage and lawsuits to numerous to count are piling up. It may just be best to give Texas some time to sort it all out."

Very strange P/E is temporarily inflated from 4Q of 2019 .which was reported in 02/27/20. $12.83 /share. Normally for last several years its maybe a dollar if you averaged it.

Displaying upside momentum. Technical looks good according to stoxline. Long over 29.61 for a run up to 34.58.
I’ll do some easy math for you. 1 year ago they were trading at $22 with profit margins that were 4X what they had this year. All those margins were just evaporated!
"I want the regulatory authorities to contact and check this single digger and seller of NRG Energy, I think this is completely illegal and bad for the company itself!"

Big selling to start the year just like last year gains ahead.
I’m buying back in now.
"Just Energy (jengq) just announced another $48,000,000 hit in additional ercot expenses resulting from ercot's ufe calculations. Just Energy is just one of a ton of players within ercot - if they got hit with 48mm in ufe, the market wide ufe may be over a billion. And guess who is on the other side of that cost? The generation divisions of NRG, VST, Calpine... will make a killing and should offset, to a large extent, the ufe share of their retail load divisions. It depends also on how long these generators were bilaterally, too."

"Buy, electricity is the power source of the future......don’t look a gift horse in the mouth. Yield plus appreciation potential ......definitely growth. Huge drop forced selling its over........"
$37 and under...I may get in. Texas issues hangs over this stock for now.
There is no denying that the one who manipulates this action is a good manipulator. I'm doing very well! Always upload it step by step and consistently with a little money. Congratulations!
NRG reached a new 52 Week High at 30.72
"So they now say $700 Million which is most likely $400 million higher then what they will realize. We all knew it could not be $100 Million, given the losses VST and XEL experienced. Thus, Impact is really NIL and with $3.5 Billion in Liquidity and a good hot summer coming in Texas. We should get back to the Mid 40's by year-end easily as all of NRG Commercial lines come back on line as we move out of the pandemic."
"Spke (spark energy) got crushed today. NRG's competition. Announced 65 million hit from uri and yet they only have about 50,000 RCE's in ERCOT.NRG and VST should get the upside longer term."
NRG heading to 50. solid .jg
I’m betting on NRG to see increase in share value in 2019
"Knock, Knock!Who’s There?Orange.Orange who?Orange you glad I told you to buy this when it was below $31/share."
The entire utility complex got slammed today so NRGs performance wasn't that different. I dont believe we have a California situation that was compounded by Enron that wreaked havoc on PCG and to a lesser extent EIX. NRG investors will have some anxiety until the financial impact of the winter weather becomes evident. Some puts might take the edge off...

"As far as lawsuits doubt you will see any. Reason being during the Earnings Conference call they very clearly stated that they could not estimate and only gave a flavor on what their Risk Assessment ranges at the time looked like. Also, during an event deemed a Federal Emergency and National Emergency I've never seen a single Class stand under those circumstances. Much more of a Risk that a Small Cap Firm like NRG under 8 Billion may actually be ripe for a Takeover at any price below $14 billion. Like VST and a lot others are going to be bought out in the next few months."
"NRG may be tapped out for the day. If you are long it is still a good hold. If it is a day or swing trade now may be the time to exit. I was in at 31.44 and out at 32.44 (should have followed my instincts and jumped at 32.60, but that 32.76 bid had me thinking it might explode up despite how it had slowed down)."
what's happening guys? any news?
I just bought 500 shares on the panic drop down. Nobody should be selling this. 7 analysts give a Buy rating on this stock.
Nrg great news. Upward. 44+
