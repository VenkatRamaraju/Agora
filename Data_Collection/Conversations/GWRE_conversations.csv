"Here's a Motley Fool article that is being tweeted:bombaywala46 May. 2 at 8:05 AM $EBIX $MDXG $YTRA $GWRE 3 Bargain Stocks You Can Buy Today You shouldn't have to look for these high-quality companies in Wall Street's bargain bin, but that's exactly where you'll find them today. Ebix (NASDAQ:EBIX) stock has fallen 41% year to date. The maker of cloud-based software and services for the insurance industry now trades at a minuscule six times trailing earnings and 13 times free cash flows, and the company is valued a 1.1 times book value. I'm sorry, but that's a blatant error. The company's full-year sales rose 17% in 2019 and earnings increased by 7%. The coronavirus may trounce the insurance industry as a whole, but Ebix stands an arms-length away from that danger. Even a struggling health-insurance or life-insurance carrier will need to use Ebix's tools for processing claims and evaluating coverage risks. You don't have to take my word for it."
Longs are you buying this breakout? Seems expensive but looks ready to run.
Yah bichch go 130
"Seeing it run so much before ER, thinking that the fall might be painful if it misses. Exiting here and we’ll see how the results turn out."
Shift to greater mix of SAAS orders and increase in average larger order size bodes well for next 2-5 years along with margin increases. Global insurance companies have to make this shift. No real significant competitor. We could see $200 stock price in five years.
Strategic acquisition by VRSK makes sense for both companies and both sets of shareholders. CEO of VRSK not prone to bold moves but with his retirement coming up maybe new leadership will seek bold moves
No way this company is worth 7.7 billion. Only averaged 11% rev growth over last 5 years. Typical tech stock right now. Anything and everything with a 7 billion dollar valuation.
Its in breakout. It will be at $150+ in the next 6 months on anticipation of Saas model with higher margins on higher sales. Great story. They have 1 billion in cash. The gains get bigger from here.
I see a double bottom to break through the all time high. this will be triple digits prior to next EA.
Guidewire Software reached an all time high at 128.52
"Ok clearly given the market sentiment now, investors would be best exiting and waiting for post earnings to get back in. Negative sentiments would make an earnings miss open at a large gap, creating massive losses for investors."
"This whole sector is struggling, even when they beat, guidance has been soft so I'll be surprised if this thing gets a good boost from the ER. More likely to go down IMO. Barchart shows 40% SELL, pretty sure that's meaningless. Short interest has decreased 15% in the last two weeks. I'm a small BUY on this one."
to the moon
hoping that monday will be a green day
stock is up almost 5%. any reason?
Andrew Lott is going to short this stock
Guidewire Software reached an all time high at 126.29
still has a lot the shorts in this stock
"Oh, 3% revenue growth y/y. Great result for this ""fast growing"" company."
All time high today
114 here we come
Opportunity for VRSK to come in and make a bid while GWRE goes throught transition to cloud SAAS model and new CEO Premium bid could be 30%? IMHO
"Anyone can explain? going down 4.24%, after 400% EPS surprise & 10.3% Revenue surprise"
Up $9 originally now up $3. Story of my life
Shoot first ask questions later. Typical market response.
Loss of ($0.11) per share - too many free options? An insiders game?
The sleeper among vertical SAAS companies. As GWRE mix shift towards greater SAAS mix of revenues becomes more visible over next 6 months analysts will get more positive. 2022 will be a breakout year and push GWRE stock up 30-50% IMHO
Just go with it
This is awesome.
What kind of market value can GWRE have at 1 billion in high margin sales? Seems pricey at 8 billion value today. Can this stock double?
Several firms raised their 12 month target prices to $117-118 this morning based on yesterday NYC analyst day.Reinforced 20% annual growth next 5 years with improving margins after 18 months. Shift to SAAS model hurts revenues and margins in short term but helps longer term. Maybe stock trades in $95-115 range for a while. Increasing cooperation with VRSK raises some interesting possibilites.
What happened? This triggered during yesterday’s “virtual analyst” webEx w investors.
"Missed EpS and lowerd guidance——ouch, so much for growth"
"I think they're sandbagging on guidance. This was a great quarter and they beat numbers. Many companies are somewhat unsure going forward, given the macro environment with tariffs, etc."
GWRE guided quite a bit lower on their revenue ($199m-$207m vs.$226m expected) for next quarter. I didn't realize both the top and bottom line guided lower. It's seems to me they're overvalued.
"arget Near Term $118 DA Davidson analyst Rishi Jaluria recommends using the recent selloff in shares of Guidewire Software as a buying opportunity. The analyst maintains a Buy rating on the shares with a $118 price target after Guidewire reported fiscal Q1 results. While the cloud commentary was disappointing, the company is making the right investments in its offerings, Jaluria tells investors in a research note. The analyst believes cloud ""extends Guidewire's market leadership position and runway of growth, even if it takes longer than expected to see adoption, especially in a notoriously conservative industry."" $118 near term target from DA Davispn analyst report"
Does this company have a moat? What portion of their revenues are subscription based currently?

#GWRE Rising with good volume. Long over 99.9 for a run up to 116.68. http://www.stoxline.com/stock_chart/GWRE.gif
this miss EPS but still hard to swag... if this can drop a bit I can get enter and exit with profit... but I have't see a big jump from tech for a while in a day of 10%+https://soundcloud.com/angkorian/jaya-ali-wanted-you
