"Missed EpS and lowerd guidance——ouch, so much for growth"
"Seeing it run so much before ER, thinking that the fall might be painful if it misses. Exiting here and we’ll see how the results turn out."
"Nice beat but investors aren't interested what you did yesterday they want upside guidance and here's where GWRE falls on its face.Co issues downside guidance for Q1, sees EPS of ($0.17)-($0.14) vs. $0.04 Capital IQ Consensus EstimateCo also sees Q1 revs of $98-$102 mln vs. $112.86 mln Capital IQ Consensus Estimate"
Anyone knows why the big drop today ?
#GWRE Rising with good volume. Long over 99.9 for a run up to 116.68. http://www.stoxline.com/stock_chart/GWRE.gif
If IBD picks this stock up as a momentum play it could move pretty quickly here.
This is awesome.

"Here's a Motley Fool article that is being tweeted:bombaywala46 May. 2 at 8:05 AM $EBIX $MDXG $YTRA $GWRE 3 Bargain Stocks You Can Buy Today You shouldn't have to look for these high-quality companies in Wall Street's bargain bin, but that's exactly where you'll find them today. Ebix (NASDAQ:EBIX) stock has fallen 41% year to date. The maker of cloud-based software and services for the insurance industry now trades at a minuscule six times trailing earnings and 13 times free cash flows, and the company is valued a 1.1 times book value. I'm sorry, but that's a blatant error. The company's full-year sales rose 17% in 2019 and earnings increased by 7%. The coronavirus may trounce the insurance industry as a whole, but Ebix stands an arms-length away from that danger. Even a struggling health-insurance or life-insurance carrier will need to use Ebix's tools for processing claims and evaluating coverage risks. You don't have to take my word for it."

Several firms raised their 12 month target prices to $117-118 this morning based on yesterday NYC analyst day.Reinforced 20% annual growth next 5 years with improving margins after 18 months. Shift to SAAS model hurts revenues and margins in short term but helps longer term. Maybe stock trades in $95-115 range for a while. Increasing cooperation with VRSK raises some interesting possibilites.

"arget Near Term $118 DA Davidson analyst Rishi Jaluria recommends using the recent selloff in shares of Guidewire Software as a buying opportunity. The analyst maintains a Buy rating on the shares with a $118 price target after Guidewire reported fiscal Q1 results. While the cloud commentary was disappointing, the company is making the right investments in its offerings, Jaluria tells investors in a research note. The analyst believes cloud ""extends Guidewire's market leadership position and runway of growth, even if it takes longer than expected to see adoption, especially in a notoriously conservative industry."" $118 near term target from DA Davispn analyst report"

"This whole sector is struggling, even when they beat, guidance has been soft so I'll be surprised if this thing gets a good boost from the ER. More likely to go down IMO. Barchart shows 40% SELL, pretty sure that's meaningless. Short interest has decreased 15% in the last two weeks. I'm a small BUY on this one."

No way this company is worth 7.7 billion. Only averaged 11% rev growth over last 5 years. Typical tech stock right now. Anything and everything with a 7 billion dollar valuation.

Does this company have a moat? What portion of their revenues are subscription based currently?
Shift to greater mix of SAAS orders and increase in average larger order size bodes well for next 2-5 years along with margin increases. Global insurance companies have to make this shift. No real significant competitor. We could see $200 stock price in five years.
115 here we come

What happened? This triggered during yesterday’s “virtual analyst” webEx w investors.
I see a double bottom to break through the all time high. this will be triple digits prior to next EA.

If we are to go off the RSI then you could argue that a pull back next day or so could occur on GWRE before rallying up. Ive been struggling with this stock lately. Some of my other trades have been from awe.some_sto-cks which are working out pretty well.

Its in breakout. It will be at $150+ in the next 6 months on anticipation of Saas model with higher margins on higher sales. Great story. They have 1 billion in cash. The gains get bigger from here.
Andrew Lott is going to short this stock
I’m out for at least two quarters. This was disappointing
Opportunity for VRSK to come in and make a bid while GWRE goes throught transition to cloud SAAS model and new CEO Premium bid could be 30%? IMHO
Longs are you buying this breakout? Seems expensive but looks ready to run.
"Chart looks ugly on this. Looks like the next stop is 68. If that doesn’t hold, 65 and possibly 60. Be careful with this one!"

"ARKF just brought over 20,000 shares"
BGCP and NMRK are better buys go look it up
The sleeper among vertical SAAS companies. As GWRE mix shift towards greater SAAS mix of revenues becomes more visible over next 6 months analysts will get more positive. 2022 will be a breakout year and push GWRE stock up 30-50% IMHO
"None of know any details about this company and yet it goes up and PD ZM and Work go down, and we know why they are special. Jump on the SRNE REAL and RVLV train instead."
Was this supposed to move?

What kind of market value can GWRE have at 1 billion in high margin sales? Seems pricey at 8 billion value today. Can this stock double?
GWRE guided quite a bit lower on their revenue ($199m-$207m vs.$226m expected) for next quarter. I didn't realize both the top and bottom line guided lower. It's seems to me they're overvalued.
