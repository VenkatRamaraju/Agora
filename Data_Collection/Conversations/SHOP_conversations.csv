This stock is in a serious Up Turn. Time to make the big true north push and into $2000 
"$77,000. That's how much more my portfolio would have been if I held on to all my shares from begining. Glad I held at 900 when people said it would dive,...glad I held at $1100 when they said ""over-valued"". Glad I held at $1400 when shorts talked negative again. Someday I plan post...""Glad I held at $2000"""
Today Shopify introduces new In-App Shopping Experiences on Tic Tok.
Here's the real question of the day? Why did Amazon partner up with Affirm which they know Shopify owns ten percent of when they could have built there own buy now pay later system themselves?
"Important to note, Shopify owns 10% of Affirm. :) $SHOP continues to eat away at Amazons moat as each quarter passes."
"Can't wait to see SHOP back over$1650, holding until it's over $1800."
Fed Powell reports current sales of durable goods are 20% higher than they were prepandemic.
We’ve been a stealth stock recently. Flying under the radar and making sizable gains consistently. I like it! Vamos! On to $2000! 
By the way Global-e Online Ltd. (GLBE) .in which Shopify owns 5% of shares plus 11.85 million warrants was up today 11.56% today at 81.19.
Today Polen Capital stated in a letter to investors that Shopify has at least 30% earning power for the next five years. Further Shopify has GMV of over 150 billion and we see those numbers going up also.
"Today Motley Fool put out an article stating the strong moat Shopify has and that the financial flexibility will make it extremely difficult for competitors to catch Shopify. I have been saying that same thing for months. Shopify is just to far out front in terms of even subscriptions, fulfillment services, international presence in 175 foreign countries, social commerce channels growth and partnerships along with extensive payment services. Just think they signed with Tic Tok and this doesn't even count Spotify yet. Shopify is big and getting bigger. I can't imagine what revenues will be on Black Friday weekend."
"I read an interesting article on how hard it would be for Amazon to recreate Affirm. The building of a credit staff would be tougher than the engineering side. Said that Affirm has hoards of former credit card employees. Given Amazon’s size, it would take a very long time to get going."
"I’ve bought my shares as of a couple days ago. Now I’m just sitting and patiently waiting for the stock price to lift off and shoot past the old highs. That’s the game with SHOP. Buy the dips, then wait for a new high to be made. The reason SHOP always pulls back after setting a new high is due largely to institutions selling to rebalance their portfolios. Part of portfolio management is trimming when a stock gets to be too overweight in your portfolio. Hedge funds in particular are more prone to lock in profits after a huge run up in price then gradually buy back in. That is why people who call for the end on every dip are really out of line. And also people who call this stock incredibly overvalued when all one has to do is look at historic valuations to realize that SHOP in the 1400s is less expensive in terms of P/E then it was in 2017 when this company wasn’t even $100 a share. I’ve read through Nathan’s posts either he just hates SHOP or is completely clueless. I would actually suspect it’s a bit of both."
Shopify tobuy or not to buy. Looking at the charts over the pass two years I noticed that in both years the low of the year came in March and in both years Shopify went on to make new highs going into the year end. So far in 2021 it appears Shopify is setting itself up to do the same. Right now with the Nasdaq making new highs in the off season and getting ready to approach on season trading in September I feel pretty good that Amazon and Shopify are both going to make a run as it appears there is a lot of international money sitting on the sidelines and getting ready to enter the market. So it would appear that it looks like another good year for Shopify. As a result I would say that they again will follow that trend and I would be a buyer at this point looking for Shopify at the 1700 to 1800 range.
How much will Shopify rise today in regards to them owning 10% of Affirm after Amazon signed contract with them?
Shopify's President Harley Finkelstein just tweeted that 67% of the young consumers 18-34 just moved the majority of there shopping online last year. That's up 50% and were not going back to the way the things were. This is the future of retail.
"All these Shopify announcements about Facebook, Google, Apple, and TikTok are great but they will be materializing in the financial statements 8-12 months after the press release. So I am enjoying my summer cottage on the lake (thanks SHOP) and patiently awaiting 4Q results to see what Walmart and Facebook are bringing to the revenue pipeline, and then google and Apple, and then TikTok, and who know who is next.Tik Tok, Tik Tok - I love my lazy clock wealth machine !!! Be patient and stay long my brothers and sisters."
Cathie’s weekly innovation note wonders whether combinations of social media apps with SHOP will challenge Amazon. TikTok is the example used and SHOP is praised.
"25Aug, Mstar's latest report on Shopify by Dan Romanoff has FMV $933usd""SHOP is Over Valued at a 66% premium."" (which is much lower than it has been for much of Shopify's history)Economic Moat : Wide Financial Health: Moderate1-Star Price 1,113.15 5-Star Price 783.40 usdIn contrast to Feb 2021: SHOP is Over Valued at a 64% premium.Economic Moat Narrow Financial Health Moderate 1-Star Price 971.50 5-Star Price 630.33I mention it only because I noticed this while looking for something else:""Jan. 24, 2020 — In fact, take a look at Morningstar's Dan Romanoff's analysis. ... Romanoff wrote that: ""Our fair value estimate for Shopify is $175 per ..""It was very expensive then too, and not yet profitable. How quickly our young grow up! And then there are the growing spurts...I wonder how many analysts from other sectors Mr. Romanoff consults with, before issuing his reports. The company is becoming increasingly complex to follow. I am grateful to all the board contributors who scrape the internet looking for the threads that comprise the fabric of this incredible company. Red green red green, every investment, every day."
"Anyone else here invested in shopify partner $FOBI? They just completed integration with $SHOP, the NR is from this morning! Big potential "
"Love that all the bears always come out to play claiming SHOP is finished whenever it declines. Just like every other time it has declined and then proceeded to rally. Instead of attacking me maybe you could listen to me and make some money. The short thesis has never had any stickiness to it with this stock except for a trade. To be short for the long haul has never been a winning strategy with SHOP. The people arguing valuation don't know how to value stocks..most of them probably just look at what the number itself says rather than looking at where it is in terms of valuation where it has historically traded. When one does that one can see that SHOP is nowhere the top of its historical range in terms of valuation. And most people also don't look at forward P/E either. Current P/E only tells you where the stock is now, not where it will be in the future. Keep up the attacks trolls. It's pretty clear in your case that the only money you'll make won't come from your long term investing strategies."
Keep an eye on Affirm as Square bought company like Affirm known as After Pay! So Shopify will likely make a whole lot more money on Affirm going forward as they own ten percent.
"I am a big believer in SHOP, but not nearly as big a believer in Cathie Wood? Is she smart? Yes. I believe long term Ark will be just fine as their biggest holdings are concentrated in names like TSLA, SQ, PYPL, SHOP, and TTD. However the genomics names and the biotechs she owns are extremely high risk. The reason Cathie Wood can afford higher risk than you and I is because she has hundreds of millions, possibly billions, of dollars to play with. Also whenever she sells SHOP shares, she is doing it to keep it from being too overweight in her portfolio. It’s a simple principle…to maintain as close to an equal weighted portfolio as possible you trim as the stock price goes up. She still owns a large amount of SHOP on her books and doesn’t dislike the company in the least. I’m so sick of people in this discussion acting like insider selling and institutional selling is universally bad. Those who say that don’t realize that portfolio management and the rules in general are more of a gray area vs. black and white."
SHOP getting serious now. Time to roll up the sleeves and go work. Eye popping partnerships starting to kick in. Hasta $2000! 
"This story is still in its infancy. Too many small businesses still do not recognize the importance of having a web presence. Surveys and studies indicate nearly 50% of small businesses choose not to invest in a website because they feel it is not relevant for their business. However, each year more and more businesses are waking up to reality and changing their views. Long SHOP for at least another 3-5 years."
Buy shopify at this price or wait for a dip????
"I can't say what happens the rest of today, tomorrow or the rest of the week, but for the moment the last 2 trading days illustrate for the umpteenth time that when SHOP goes down, 99.99% of the time you should buy the dip. I'm sure Mary and the other bears think they know better but the last 2 days are proof they are dead wrong, at least so far. I've already illustrated how history proves SHOP isn't expensive compared to where it's been, and looking at a chart you will see that after every decline a rally has followed. Congratulations if you listened to me and the other posters telling you this decline was a bear trap. If you fell for the trap and shorted you are hurting big time right now and most likely the pain will only get worse if you refuse to cover. All of us who understand what it means to have a virtual moat and a business that continues to grow explosively know that valuation is not going to be the demise of this company. The only hope for the less than 2 percent of shorts that make up the float is if something happens where SHOP commits fraud or a new competitor comes along that has a better mousetrap. So far it hasn't happened, and with the number of patents SHOP is accumulating it's getting harder. BIGC came along to try and compete with SHOP and as is illustrated by the declining to stagnant stock price it's proving to be a lot more difficult than they thought."
So glad I bought SHOP back in 2017. This investment has changed my life. Thank you Tobi and the Shopify team. They will have effectively cut my retirement age by at least 5 years.Cheers longs!
"See what I mean about this company? I'll bet the TeamSHOP Scouts were absolutely salivating at their prospects today. Is correction in the air? Probably. It always happens. Resets, whatever. Is this, that? Dunno. red green.But once again, here is Shopify, so sideways it's almost laughable: Shop.to tanked -$1.20cad/share -0.06% on 50% volumes. A bit more in the US -$7.13 -0.48% at 95% volume. With a weird price spread - on the exchange. Something in the money markets?). This is about -1% of the original $100/sh price of the 2017 investment bunch. All they did was hang on, Q after Q after Q after Q (taking profits as necessary), and not sell, correction after inevitable market correction. Shopify price has never given back as much as the market wants to take, not nearly. Sometimes they even go green when everything else is tanking. Just not today.But we have always expected to give back much more than we ever have. This is true of every market correction in the past 20 quarters. People laughed the first time I called this my recession-safe investment, and a ""value"" investment. I maintain my thesis regardless. I bear witness to the rebirth of the American entrepreneurial Spirit with every e/r, and every builtwith update.Re today's messy market, there are 46 businesses in my (relatively) balanced portfolio, and while there was a little green, not a single gain was >1% (go jnj, for actually placing on the leaderboard for the first time in...5yrs? But green is green. Even boring investments can sometimes shine.)Everyone still strapped in? Shopify is now a business hybrid, part growth, but matured into profitability too. A ""safer bet"" than it has ever been before.I had this thought around being institutionally driven. Scouts talk about this like it's a bad thing, like they will suddenly flood the market with Shopify shares. It won't happen. For them too, this is a long term investment, a next-gen brkH, IBM, aapl, amzn or any of the great, mature divvy players of today. It's not in their interests to unload. Foresight - or rather, the lack thereof, has been repeatedly demonstrated by the waves of non-shareholding investors that pass through here. So easy to be a strong hand investor in Shopify. It gave me patience to stick with other long term plays that I might have been inclined to abandon, but are proving richly rewarding today! Happy Investing Everybody!"

"""Arming the Rebels"". If you put enough rebels together, suddenly there's an army. And once you build an army, other armies will start to appear. Today's thought is that Xpo is just as interested in carving into the Amazon pie as Shopify. It was just announced that effective Monday 30Aug21, xpo will be rejecting Amzn's LTLs into Albany. (I've pasted the link at xpo)The financial media has not been kind to xpo either. They are both industry distuptors, and the stock has been volatile. Amazon spanked them by cancelling come contracts in 2019 and share price tumbled, they got knocked by House of Fraser's bankruptcy etc. So now, XPO is cancelling amzn's business at a time when everybody is seriously short of staff. What does it mean? What's the grand plan...What if the companies that wanted to take jabs at mighty Amazon ganged up together, and strategized synergistically? I think that maybe (and it's a big maybe), this is Xpo putting pressure back on Amazon, which they couldn't do without the nimble (and hungry) SFN backing them up.Wouldn't it be interesting if SFN becomes more efficient, more cost effective than Amazon, in say, 5 years?Hey Kenneth, what if Amzn went with Afrm because there was nobody else big enough to maintain the service"
Today Merchant Mastery wrote an article on how ten businesses from Shopify doubled and tripled there revenues in six months.
Amazon just announced a deal with AFFIRM that Shopify owns ten percent of . Affirm is up 17% to almost 80.00. Congrats Shopify!
"Love how ARK unloaded 21030 shares on August 24th and the price was able to spike up to 1550 so they could get an excellent sales price. If you think SHOP and CMG are trading normally, than you have to be kidding yourself."
"This link is to an interview with Dax DaSilva at the BMO Tech Summit. I'm not plugging the company (although I hold a long position since ipo), but DaSilva and Tobi are business rivals... That aside, at 37:00min, he answers questions from the floor, including one about competition, and discusses Shopify for about 5 minutes. (At one point in the interview though, he was asked about his last round of fund raising, and admitted that it was just a good time to raise money - which is what Shopify does.https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2021-tech-lightspeed?start=2265#/"
"Now everyon keeps talking about Spotify partnering up with Shopify now that the Tic Tok deal is done. Even Harley has spoke about Spotify. So I decided I wanted to see how big Spotify really is. Spotify is the world's most popular audio streaming subscription service with 365 million users, including a 165 million subscribers across a 178 markets. Interesting. This to me would be like icing on the cake with all the other partnerships Shopify has created."
"I have a question about this mixed shelf offering. Does it operate like a faucet, that they can ""trickle-release"" shares into the market? xnumber at a time? Sort of whimsically? Intellectual expressed concern that they had not closed the offering, but it's open-ended. They've filed, and now they can do what they want, release them in such a way as to control price? And they don't have to announce it, because it's already been done? Wow. Clever, tricky tricky Shopify for ""managing"" share price, if that's the case. I hope somebody can shed some light, because as I see it, it doesn't look very good for the scouts.For example, yesterday and today were sideways days. They could have flipped a switch and called 50k shares into play, and the only difference would have been a few bucks to the green, instead of the red. Does this make any sense?"
"With all the partnerships in place by Shopify which include Facebook, Google, Pinterest, Instagram, Tic Tok and others with 3.4 million merchants according to builtwith the 3rd quarter is going to be YUGE!"
"I have a feeling I will be six feet under before Mary posts something positive about SHOP. She's been pessimistic since $1040 and even before that. She has either has the mindset of a short term trader, which isn't a good strategy with a long term growth stock like SHOP, or she just detests the company for whatever reason and is posting her agenda trying to get others to get on board. I muted her awhile back, but I can tell she continues to reply to my posts anyway. You have three choices with SHOP: buy it for the long haul, trade it, or short it. Trading will get you pocket change compared to investing for the long haul, shorting will get your house foreclosed on and you living on the streets going to the bathroom in a portable bucket. You pick which lifestyle you want...anyone with common sense wants money in the bank and a roof over their head. Going long SHOP you can get tons of money in the bank and a very expensive roof over your head."
