Shopify is just new luckin coffee) Same sales figure inflation.
"Muted Jason. He lives in a fantasy world I want no part of. He thinks all trillion dollar market cap names are bubbles, and he also thinks anything that is expensive is either fraudulent or a bubble. If he knew anything about the meme stocks he would realize SHOP is anything but a bubble. Getting cheaper each quarter."
"I can't say what happens the rest of today, tomorrow or the rest of the week, but for the moment the last 2 trading days illustrate for the umpteenth time that when SHOP goes down, 99.99% of the time you should buy the dip. I'm sure Mary and the other bears think they know better but the last 2 days are proof they are dead wrong, at least so far. I've already illustrated how history proves SHOP isn't expensive compared to where it's been, and looking at a chart you will see that after every decline a rally has followed. Congratulations if you listened to me and the other posters telling you this decline was a bear trap. If you fell for the trap and shorted you are hurting big time right now and most likely the pain will only get worse if you refuse to cover. All of us who understand what it means to have a virtual moat and a business that continues to grow explosively know that valuation is not going to be the demise of this company. The only hope for the less than 2 percent of shorts that make up the float is if something happens where SHOP commits fraud or a new competitor comes along that has a better mousetrap. So far it hasn't happened, and with the number of patents SHOP is accumulating it's getting harder. BIGC came along to try and compete with SHOP and as is illustrated by the declining to stagnant stock price it's proving to be a lot more difficult than they thought."
$WISH I didn't get in $PINS at $12I didn't get in $ETSY at $6 I didn't get in $SHOP at $20I didn't get in $AMZN at $37 so yeah I like $WISH under 10$ and I’m adding every pay biatches 
"Now everyon keeps talking about Spotify partnering up with Shopify now that the Tic Tok deal is done. Even Harley has spoke about Spotify. So I decided I wanted to see how big Spotify really is. Spotify is the world's most popular audio streaming subscription service with 365 million users, including a 165 million subscribers across a 178 markets. Interesting. This to me would be like icing on the cake with all the other partnerships Shopify has created."
I heard about SHOP the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"There's always a period of adjustment after an event like this. Portfolio rebalancing etc. The two equities have to find their own price. It can sometimes take a while. For example, aapl didn't recover their pre-split price for about 9 month. Some people will move into xpo, others into gxo, others simply want to grab their winnings. Maybe institutions will take some profits now.Their could be some volatility with with both companies, since they are both unknowns now. Two companies means twice the risk, so there's trimming going on.You have to shrug it off, shift focus. do something else or you can drive yourself mad. Check in every week, or month. If you look at xpo's 5 year chart, you will see why I've spent a lot of the past five years ignoring the price movement. It's exciting, but you also have to be able to sleep and night. Investing should NOT cause distress. It's important to handle the emotional side of things. I love my businesses, and give them the time they need to get things done.Fortunately for us all, Shopify's foray into Europe should send profits trickling in fairly quickly. This is LTP, long term play, and these are brand new days! Love your companies. Give them time to shine. Look at xpo's 5yr chart! I trimmed some profits when it began crasing Sept2018, and it didn't hit $85 again until Jan2021. Aapl traded sideways for 9 months after the split. Great time be building a position, or simply leaving your investment to mature.Yes, a little bit down down today. Volumes were also down 30% over yesterday. The dust needs to settle. The administrative end is still being looked after. Red green red green.. Investors are far less excited by normal daily price movement, than the traders and scouts since we think in terms of quarters, years and decades.. Eventually we move so far away from our entry price that we don't even think about it. Its a function of Time, and not becoming impatient, just like Warren Buffet says.@Abdul. I'm not against trading (although I don't), but I always suggest that people should avoid shorting and trading Shopify. It's been tragic seeing so much money thrown away. Shopify, xpo and gxo are nimble and creative in a way that few companies are, and now that they are partnered AND are both disruptors, Shopify will teach them some of their...tricks...to discourage traders and short selling. Nobody build a brand quite like Shopify, and they're very generous. XPO, pre-split, needed to grow revenues 50% to catch up with their nearest competition, I can't escape the sense that they and Shopify and gxo of course fit heavily into each other's plans. At the 6RS website, ""In no particular order"" they have listed the top 20 logistics company they are doing business with, and xpo is one of them. I'm trying not to read too much into it, but XPO is number one on the list, and Europe is where they plan to make serious coin with SHOP. I just know that I'm right.$SHOP now has more than 3 million merchants. That's 715,000 more than they had on 10June.21. More than half are US merchants, which bodes well for $XPO, and the balance are from everywhere else, like Europe..It's gonna be great!"
"A gross margin expansion has been taking place for two consecutive quarters right now in SHOP. I warned back in December that SHOP was in the crux of an opportunity to expand margins, and it has indeed done so, going from the lower 50s in December to almost 55 percent now. So this company is clearly trending in the right direction in terms of margins. In addition to that, return on invested capital is trending upward and clearly beginning to reflect the fact this company has a strong and durable competitive advantage over its peers. SHOP continues to carry zero long term debt as well. In addition to that, further proof this company has gotten cheaper despite the rise in price is free cash flow yield, which is at a 5 year high, and further illustrates my point that while still a high growth stock SHOP's valuation has slowly gotten more in line over time. Jason will call this a pyramid scheme all he wants, some people just think anything that is virtually bullet proof has to have something that smells. The only thing SHOP stock smells like to me is the smell of fresh crisp $100 bills, not human waste."

Institutional Holdings Continues To Climb Now At 83.48% On Shopify!https://fintel.io/so/us/shop
"I read an interesting article on how hard it would be for Amazon to recreate Affirm. The building of a credit staff would be tougher than the engineering side. Said that Affirm has hoards of former credit card employees. Given Amazon’s size, it would take a very long time to get going."
"Just bought more at 1495. I say with 95 percent certainty this is not the beginning of another February-May beating for growth. I remain long my major growth names like SHOP and TTD and continue to hold the trillion dollar market cap names as well as other companies with clear competitive advantages that represent growth at a reasonable price. I continue to steer clear of the profit less and weak balance sheet names. Cathie Wood is smart but there is no doubt she sometimes takes on unfavorable risk reward scenarios and has a much higher pain tolerance than I do, which makes sense because she has an infinite amount money to play with than me. SHOP was an idea of mine years before Cathie first caught on."

Don’t forget. MANY of the Canadian TSX ETFs have SHOP either in their number 1 or number 2 Holdings. That says something. Institutions want and need this company to succeed and go up. I would bet that the institutions won’t sell this one…
"Dear TeamSHOP Investors Just a heads up that it might get a little bit busy in here as the Scouts line up their various bets for and against the House. It suggests that we might have a little volatility ahead of us. Strap in for a ride. It comes free with every share purchase. Take Gravol. Wear a helmet.Be aware that the scouts, while very small in number, are noisy, and tend to cluster here. Their job is to be noisy and shake out the weak hands from the trading end, so that we always know how much this wonderful business is worth.. These are how few of them there actually are, from the Yahoo Stats Page: Shares Short (Jul. 30, 2021) 1.58MShort Ratio (Jul. 30, 2021) 1.12Short % of Float (Jul. 30, 2021) 2.44%Short % of Shares Outstanding (Jul. 30, 2021) 4 1.26%Shares Short (prior month Jun. 30, 2021) 4 1.69M THIS IS NOT what an attack looks like. By way of reference, this a tiny bit of a spike. Attack is along the lines of >7% short of float. Attack is AMC at 17% short. W at 22%, BBBY at 23% I don't think Shopify has 7% short of float since Winter 2017, after the Citron short. His second attempt failed so miserably that the share price recovered in 3 days. He's a big mouth, and he lies, and he welches on his bets: He never paid out the $200k to the RobinHood Foundation of NYC that he promised if the second short failed. (The fact that he ceded the bet a few weeks early didn't get him off the hook to the commitment to a charity. He lost, and he didn't pay up. And people like darling Idiot Nephew copied him, and lost too.We might be uncomfortable 5%, especially if in a new position, and not yet sitting on plump gains. Patience. Walk away. Follow the Q and the A/Rs, limit your screen-peeks. The business. Follow the business. Get on their mailing list, So it's important to think like a business owner/investor, not like a gambler playing giddy'up at the racetrack. Trim if you must, but hold on to those shares. Unsplit, perfect shares. I can't imagine that a single person here would be upset if they had a single EARLY share of msft, amzn, brkH, aapl. Or just had a few dividend queens.How about boring old IBM? 100 original shares of IBM are now split into ~7450 shares. and the quarterly dividend is $1.64/share. The annual dividend is slightly more than $7.35 ipo price. .Today, those old retirees (or their widows or offspring) are hauling in nearly $49k/year...on a $735 investment...I keep thinking I've misplaced a decimal... IBM wasn't cheap either, $7/share at IPO - but they paid dividends from the very beginning. Today, It doesn't matter what was paid back then. Who cares what it is trading for today? That's compounding magic! Long term wealth-building. Park and hold.SHOP is unlikely to pay a dividend, or split, for a very, very long time. It has to do the with m.o. of the company. Think BRK-A, original, shares, with a different kind of moat. So share price will always be high, and expensive. And keep it in mind as the scouts try to convince you to unload. That's where they make their money.Keep in mind also, that the longer you hold on to a good stock, the less likely it is that price fluctuations will affect your capital. After you've invested your money, you feel sidelined. We all do, and it feels horrible. Get over it, and resist the urge to sell/make trades. Give your investment a chance to grow. Fwiw, I really believe that this will be a trillion dollar company. What would a few unsplit shares be worth?"

"Well, SHOP was at 1440 range back on 7/16 and in six sessions, it jumped 200 pts to 1640+ on 7/23. People can talk about all they want about it will go down...etc.. but when it moves up, it is really powerful."
"All these people claiming SHOP is a ponzi scheme and a fraud need to take a look at NKLA, whose founder Trevor Milton just got charged with deceptive business practices and misleading investors and is looking at prison time. This could also spell the end for that company. SHOP unlike NKLA has straightforward management and a founder and CEO who is ethically very sound. Harley Finkelstein as well is incredibly transparent and straightforward. SHOP may have had a huge price runup over the past several years to where it is overvalued, however it is overvalued for a justified reason and will most likely be able to sustain a large enough growth rate to maintain the valuation. Lots of people look at a stock running away from fundamentals and immediately conclude that something stinks, but it really depends on the company. Grouping SHOP in with the meme stocks makes as much sense as grouping in tigers with parrots and claiming they are the same family of species. Each growth stock is a different animal. SHOP has a rapidly growing business, the meme stocks are just expensive with zero real growth. A bubble SHOP is not. And a fraud it is not."
"I guess Goldman Sachs and Motley fool closed their long positions and now have only puts (you can see in their 13F). As a result we will not see pumping posts here for some time. Good time to present fair and quality information.Shopify is Ponzi and forging its papers1) Shopify claims that their stores generated 42 billion of revenue in 2Q 2021. It is more than P&G and Coca-cola combined. How much do you spend in Shopify stores and how much you spend on these 2 brands? It is no-brainer that this figure is forged.2) 1.5 billion of 2020 Revenue is coming from Shopify payments. Contract terms (section 5, google it) between Stripe, who is processing payments for Shopify, you will see that the whole responsibility and control over payments is on Stripe. In this case Stripe is a principle. Furthermore, Shopify does not have any system to process payments (9.5 million computer equipment is a joke). As a result revenue from Shopify payments should be accounted on net basis not gross and decreased at least by 70%.3) WIX, competitor of SHOPIFY, has similar number of live websites but has 10 times less revenue from merchant solutions (they call it business) than SHOPIFY.4) Despite have that Shopify claims that they have more sales than WIX, the deferred revenue balance of SHOPIFY is less than WIX’s.5) Sales and marketing costs are not temporary. It is cost of supporting Shopify stores during trial period and providing services for big companies whom Shopify signs to promote themselves. Shopify doesn’t generate income from them (ex. Staples and Fenty Skin). In fact, these big companies even don’t’ have Shop Pay services. You can check it on their websites. Those costs are COGS.6) R&D expenses are not temporary either. In 3 year 1.5 billion spent on R&D haven’t generated any asset. Most probably R&D expenses are just developing new website templates. That should be treated as COGS, not R&D. Worse scenario that is just stealing money from the company.7) Top management is leaving the company. Insiders hold less than 1% of company.8) There is no way for Shopify to not lose its revenue growth while all other ecommerce companies do. Shopify is either operating on Mars or forging their figures.9) Balance sheet is missing restricted cash. According to the same contract with Stripe: Shopify USA acknowledges and agrees that Stripe or its financial partners may require a reserve to secure Shopify USA’s liability (the “Stripe Reserve”).10) The cash itself is not trustable. It consists mostly of commercial papers and bonds. That are probably borrowed and don’t even belong to them.Because the Ponzi is close to its end they require more cash. These explains increase in frequency of SPOs. Sep2020, Feb2021, Aug2021 (6, 4, 3 months break). After August the next one will be in September-October 2021, then November-December 2021. After it Ponzi will crash.Investment bank Goldman Sachs is aware of it, but they have interest in SPOs.Firstly, they do underwriting and receive fee for it. Then they manipulate the media and sell these shares to their clients.Secondly, with remaining money Shopify purchases minority interest in other private companies to support their valuation for upcoming IPOs (AFRM, GLBE, now Stripe). These IPOs are underwritten by Goldman Sachs. The last investment was in Stripe, that acts as the processor of Shopify Payments. Shopify purchased less than 0.5% of it for 350 mln. It is comparable the their yearly R&D expenses."

"SHOP’s institutional ownership continues to grow, now it has topped 83 percent. 83 percent institutionally owned tells me less and less weak hands have the ability to control the direction of this stock. When the people on here sell I just laugh, I’ll take it seriously when institutions begin offloading their shares.

"All stocks looking to open in the red as geopolitical and growth concerns all shift the perceived risk reward balance in stocks at least temporarily. Afghanistan falling to the Taliban and retail slowdown in China I predicted would both weigh on markets, especially China as it clearly indicates the Delta Variant is applying to friction to the process of normalizing economies around the world. It could be a turbulent week to few weeks ahead but SHOP will be fine over the long haul. SHOP does well in an open economy as well as a closed one, in an open one at least as long as inflation and rates don’t get out of control. I am looking 6 months ahead, not the next few weeks. Once the turbulence leaves it should be smooth sailing for longs."
All this softness on a flat market. Wait until a correction occurs. Reality coming in 3rd quarter and REALLY coming in 4th quarter.

Innovative company has just created a new way of doing business: selling websites and using infrastructure of other companies to process payments for a fee. I open the window and see year 2002 from it:)
The best part is we can continue climbing till earnings and if earnings are great there is absolutely no need for a correction this time around. $1800ish and if we break through that easily with good volume we are going to $2400. $1643 to $1800 is the easiest 10% you're ever going to make in your life.
"With Shopify running triple digits on gross profit and revenue I see Shopify going to 2300.00 by year end. Further evidence of the strength in this company is it's ability to hold institutions at a very high rate of investment into the shares outstanding on a percentage basis. Currently this number is 82.40% as of yesterday. Compare that number to the likes of Google, Amazon, Microsoft or others and Shopify is at the top. So as far as Shopify stock price is concerned this stock has a ways to run yet this year."
"Looks like e-commerce overall is again getting a boost as a result of the lingering pandemic conditions. Analyst's appear to be reviewing again at this point this situation. The number of cases we are now seeing is over a 100,000 cases a day nationally. This is running right into the third quarter which is the fall season of the year in which we have cooler weather coming in. Don't see this improving anytime soon so it looks like stay at home stocks are again going to do well not only for this reason but subscriptions in Shopify have expanded and now wholesale trading is here which is a larger GMV opportunity than retail."

"I think SHoP went up too much too fast last year and it may trade sideways for awhile, AMZN is in similar situation and it is flat for the last 12 months."
I thought SHOP is in bubble territory when it was $500/share and look at it now. LMAO. Institutions are keep pumping. I'm going to enjoy watching SHOP tanking below $500 within a year.
"Perfect explanation as to why growth is doing well today and value and cyclicals aren't. Virus concerns. Good for stay at home stocks like SHOP. There all kinds of tug of war forces in the market right now...the virus favors growth, the jobs report points to a Fed taper soon which favors value and cyclicals at least in the short term, etc. We will be seeing a tradeoff between the Dow and S&P and the Nasdaq in the coming weeks, as the reopening forces battle the forces pulling us backward. Ultimately reopening will win out over the virus with a 99.99 percent certainty, but the Fed is not trying to jack up rates to the point they strangle the economy, only trying to get them back to where they were just prior to COVID. There is a possibility SHOP could take a hit, but it will only be temporary. The market never likes it when the Fed raises rates, regardless of the context. With every taper comes a taper tantrum. I plan to hold SHOP through the good times and the bad, because I know SHOP will come out on top eventually like it has ever since it first became public. Unless the company does something unethical like commit fraud or a serious competitive threat emerges, and BIGC is a paper tiger at the moment heading in a downward spiral, there is very little that can hold the companies with competitive advantages down forever."

"All these Shopify announcements about Facebook, Google, Apple, and TikTok are great but they will be materializing in the financial statements 8-12 months after the press release.

Be patient and stay long my brothers and sisters."
"It’s a big question mark what lies ahead for SHOP in the near term because the topic of whether or not the Fed tapering is baked into the shares of individual stocks is hotly debated. I feel like some already is priced in at least in terms of the smart money. Veteran investors like me are fully expecting tapering to come possibly as early as the next couple of weeks. We will see how it all shakes out but after this it should be smooth sailing. The big question mark in my mind is whether SHOP will receive the same treatment as it did from February to May when tapering happens, and it IS going to happen, not a question of if but when. I bought a few days ago but plan to hold off in the event that tapering is not fully priced into the market. But I remain a believer in SHOP over the long haul."

I think Shopify is going up big-time tomorrow… The deal with Tic Talk is just way to big to ignore.

From February 2020 to February 2021 Shopify social commerce channels have grown 76%. Not to shabby!
"With all the partnerships in place by Shopify which include Facebook, Google, Pinterest, Instagram, Tic Tok and others with 3.4 million merchants according to builtwith the 3rd quarter is going to be YUGE!"
"Apparently nobody realizes MSFT and AAPL weren't rewarded by the street either despite good earnings, and that SHOP is expensive for a reason, unlike the meme stocks, which have no underlying business driving the price growth."

"I'm most certainly not an expert on these things, but somewhere around $1,500 is looking like a hard bottom presently.

ATB Capital raises Price Target on Shopify to $2500.00
"I’ve bought my shares as of a couple days ago. Now I’m just sitting and patiently waiting for the stock price to lift off and shoot past the old highs. That’s the game with SHOP. Buy the dips, then wait for a new high to be made. The reason SHOP always pulls back after setting a new high is due largely to institutions selling to rebalance their portfolios. Part of portfolio management is trimming when a stock gets to be too overweight in your portfolio. Hedge funds in particular are more prone to lock in profits after a huge run up in price then gradually buy back in. That is why people who call for the end on every dip are really out of line. And also people who call this stock incredibly overvalued when all one has to do is look at historic valuations to realize that SHOP in the 1400s is less expensive in terms of P/E then it was in 2017 when this company wasn’t even $100 a share. I’ve read through Nathan’s posts either he just hates SHOP or is completely clueless. I would actually suspect it’s a bit of both."
"This link is to an interview with Dax DaSilva at the BMO Tech Summit. I'm not plugging the company (although I hold a long position since ipo), but DaSilva and Tobi are business rivals... That aside, at 37:00min, he answers questions from the floor, including one about competition, and discusses Shopify for about 5 minutes. (At one point in the interview though, he was asked about his last round of fund raising, and admitted that it was just a good time to raise money - which is what Shopify does.https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2021-tech-lightspeed?start=2265#/"

I heard on the radio today that September is the worst month historically for stocks. If you know this you probably wouldn't be buying any stocks Aug 31 however you might be buying in the last week of Sept.
"I have a feeling I will be six feet under before Mary posts something positive about SHOP. She's been pessimistic since $1040 and even before that. She has either has the mindset of a short term trader, which isn't a good strategy with a long term growth stock like SHOP, or she just detests the company for whatever reason and is posting her agenda trying to get others to get on board. I muted her awhile back, but I can tell she continues to reply to my posts anyway. You have three choices with SHOP: buy it for the long haul, trade it, or short it. Trading will get you pocket change compared to investing for the long haul, shorting will get your house foreclosed on and you living on the streets going to the bathroom in a portable bucket. You pick which lifestyle you want...anyone with common sense wants money in the bank and a roof over their head. Going long SHOP you can get tons of money in the bank and a very expensive roof over your head."
"One of the indicators I use to determine if a company has a competitive advantage is if the company has patents: SHOP has 45 patents. BIGC is going to have an awfully hard time infringing on SHOP’s territory as long as that is the case. Barriers to entry are extremely high if somebody wants to go and copy what SHOP is doing. 45 patents is like a skyscraper one will have to find a way to scale to be able to compete on the same level as SHOP. Bottom line, stick with SHOP. There really aren’t any decent alternatives. One could argue AMZN is a competitor but in terms of direct competition SHOP doesn’t really have that at all."

"For those who can’t review information themselves: you shouldn't trust daily or even weekly moves of institutional holding. There is a time lag between submissions of SEC filings by different institutions. When one institution sells, another buys.For example, if you look at the resource: https://fintel.io/so/us/shop you will see that that the last quantity of holdings of SHOP by ARK Investment Management LLC is stated according to report of 30/06/2021 submitted 08/05/2021 and doesn’t consider sales starting from July."

Shopify has filed for an up to $10 billion mixed shelf offering after the recent earnings.Does anyone know when this will be?
"By the way those familiar with the ""Rule of 40"" here is some info for you. Merchant growth alone will be 39%. So if one is wondering about revenue growth rate and profitability margin they can stop worrying. As I have said before Shopify will be $2300.00 by year end."

"I always invest in companies who solve problems or make life better by people using long term solutions. SHOP is one of those companies. They literally created a digital way for businesses to launch, get the word out much faster than word of mouth, and instantly reach far more people at a far faster pace. SHOP simplified the process of launching a business. I use financial analysis to say SHOP will grow into its valuation, but when looking at the practicality and stickiness of the business one doesn't need numbers to automatically conclude that SHOP has major staying power. I invest in Dollar General because they solve a problem with the lower class not being able to afford expensive items at mom and pop store chains, such as groceries. But even consumers who can afford those things will always choose the lower price. Hence their method is sticky as well. These are the types of companies I park my money in. Ones that not only solve a problem, but ones whose solutions have little chance of being replicated or replaced by something better in the near future."
for some reason i feel like feds will take away all the gains and the good quarter earnings.
"With Aug 20 1100+ and 1300+ Put options at $1450 and $1400 and also 2238 at $1200, this stock will stay in the 1400's this week. That's a lot of protection from a price drop. Major manipulation to sell those shares! Some sucker over the phone at the desk being told ""Look how solid SHOP during this small Nasdaq correction"". Same old Wallstreet game. We'll have to see how many Puts are placed for next week to see if the broker is done with the placement yet."
"The changing face of business. I needed about $550 worth of air filter. When I purchased the machine, I ordered online through a local distributor, who had it shipped to me. The business (American designed and built) is global. They are now on Shopify, and I've now made my 3rd PAY purchase, quite unexpectedly. To day, PAY has processed more $$ than I spent on amzn last year.BTW, builtwith reports 715,000 NEW live merchants since mid-June, when I last reported. They now have 3.1 million live merchants, with another 1million redirects. ShopPLUS merchants aren't included.Somebody mentioned BigC...They've now dropped to only 52k merchants (they had 77k at IPO, and 130k at some earlier time, and are still losing customers to Shop, in droves.. SHOP's net gain of BigC Merchants: >5000 this month. ShopPLUS plucked up an additional 141.The name rocks, but the company is still trading 20% below IPO price, and is $100 down from the peak. I feel sorry for the SHOP holders that closed their positions here, and moved over to bigc, but they were so impatient for quick, easy money. I actually considered taking a short position, but it's just not in my makeup.Maybe the company will prove to be a decent investment over time, but it had none of the hallmarks of a winner. Still, people traded their $1,000 single share of SHOP for 13 shares of of BigC @ $76, because ""more shares are better"", They have about only 58% the number of shares that Shopify has, and 14.75% of the float is short despite large institutional ownership. (72%) I think that the institutions jumped in, after their massive fail in identifying Shopify, and their modified fail in identifying Lspd, that traded only on the tsx for their first 18 months. The Finpages missed both of those gems, so they want for bigc in FOMO, and pumped it for weeks, never critical of the the corporation's history, or offerings. Then they stopped pumping it, so they wouldn't look like idiots.""The bitter taste of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten."" On another note, I think I need to pay more attention to 6RS. I found this link today. The headline, from TheManufacturer is ""Cobots expand potential labour pool to help fill worker shortage"", referring to Chuck's picking system.https://www.themanufacturer.com/articles/cobots-expand-potential-labour-pool-to-help-fill-worker-shortage/"
"""Arming the Rebels"". If you put enough rebels together, suddenly there's an army. And once you build an army, other armies will start to appear. Today's thought is that Xpo is just as interested in carving into the Amazon pie as Shopify. It was just announced that effective Monday 30Aug21, xpo will be rejecting Amzn's LTLs into Albany. (I've pasted the link at xpo)The financial media has not been kind to xpo either. They are both industry distuptors, and the stock has been volatile. Amazon spanked them by cancelling come contracts in 2019 and share price tumbled, they got knocked by House of Fraser's bankruptcy etc. So now, XPO is cancelling amzn's business at a time when everybody is seriously short of staff. What does it mean? What's the grand plan...What if the companies that wanted to take jabs at mighty Amazon ganged up together, and strategized synergistically? I think that maybe (and it's a big maybe), this is Xpo putting pressure back on Amazon, which they couldn't do without the nimble (and hungry) SFN backing them up.Wouldn't it be interesting if SFN becomes more efficient, more cost effective than Amazon, in say, 5 years?Hey Kenneth, what if Amzn went with Afrm because there was nobody else big enough to maintain the service"
I think the reason why SHOP has been going down so much recently is that both WIX and Amazon had bad results and SHOP is kind of like a hybrid of those 2 companies .... even though SHOP didn't have bad results but some may think SHOP will therefore disappoint in the next earnings call.
"Love that all the bears always come out to play claiming SHOP is finished whenever it declines. Just like every other time it has declined and then proceeded to rally. Instead of attacking me maybe you could listen to me and make some money. The short thesis has never had any stickiness to it with this stock except for a trade. To be short for the long haul has never been a winning strategy with SHOP. The people arguing valuation don't know how to value stocks..most of them probably just look at what the number itself says rather than looking at where it is in terms of valuation where it has historically traded. When one does that one can see that SHOP is nowhere the top of its historical range in terms of valuation. And most people also don't look at forward P/E either. Current P/E only tells you where the stock is now, not where it will be in the future. Keep up the attacks trolls. It's pretty clear in your case that the only money you'll make won't come from your long term investing strategies."

"We are truly seeing SHOP becoming a platform company right now. The last big platform company was MSFT (it still is), so given where SHOP currently is, in it's growth trajectory, I would think they are Microsoft circa early 1990s. The path to $1T valuation is very likely if revenue growth continues at 50%+ CAGR over the next 5 years at least."

There are over 6,800 $1,140 Calls outstanding, but the folks on the other end of that trade who issued those calls will be working hard to drop the stock in Jan 2023 since there are over 6,800 options outstanding.

"What Arming the Rebels looks like. This is a 13 minute read/analysis from the Shopify blog (which anybody can subscribe to.) In early days, the Shopify blog was an important news resource for this board. ""Alexa, What Are Amazon’s Main Competitors? And Why Are They Successful?"" Shopify outlines the competition, and helps merchants find their edge. It's good background, and gives one an idea of who owns what. Even merchants can make decisions about where they want to put their money.https://www.shopify.ca/blog/amazon-competitors"
Don't get me wrong this is a decent company at $120 per share. With revenue of $31.42 p/s it puts it much more in line with normal valuations.
"The argument for SHOP getting overvalued is holding less water all the time now. After earnings SHOP's PE has again decreased from the lower 100s to 77, and now sports a 30.89% 5 year earnings growth rate. That is almost growth at a reasonable price folks, not quite there yet but we will get there soon. It took AMZN many years to get to this point, SHOP is growing even faster than AMZN. We will soon be investing in this for value, not growth. It is indeed growing into its valuation and looking more attractive all the time. As this clearly shows, just because there is a price increase doesn't mean the PE will increase. The earnings growth is rapidly catching up to the price growth. And clearly the street sees this and that explains why analysts continue to get more and more bullish."

"I have a question about this mixed shelf offering. Does it operate like a faucet, that they can ""trickle-release"" shares into the market? xnumber at a time? Sort of whimsically? Intellectual expressed concern that they had not closed the offering, but it's open-ended. They've filed, and now they can do what they want, release them in such a way as to control price? And they don't have to announce it, because it's already been done? Wow. Clever, tricky tricky Shopify for ""managing"" share price, if that's the case. I hope somebody can shed some light, because as I see it, it doesn't look very good for the scouts.For example, yesterday and today were sideways days. They could have flipped a switch and called 50k shares into play, and the only difference would have been a few bucks to the green, instead of the red. Does this make any sense?"
"You just have to decide which narrative works best for you. I'm not overly concerned for Shopify's future, but the clamour of the coyotes across most boards and here, suggests coming volatility. I don't think it hurts to brace for it, because all the time that our Scouts spend squinting at their graphs might mean...something. But then I bump into this ""Team Transitory""'s perspective, and find myself further reassured. Shopify isn't recession-proof,, but I maintain that it's recession-resistant, and believe that our market scouts with find themselves underwhelmed by their gambol against the House. Some of them with win sometimes, but disappointment will outweigh joy..https://www.msn.com/en-ca/money/markets/team-transitory-is-proving-the-fear-mongers-wrong-and-winning-the-battle-over-inflation/ar-AANzpvu?ocid=winp1taskbar"

"Practically the only concern about SHOP that investors may not like when the company reports earnings on Wednesday is the spending they've engaged in to maintain a competitive edge against BIGC, which is likely to weigh on profitability this quarter. Other than that I expect merchant growth, user growth, and revenue growth all to handily top estimates, even as revenue growth begins to normalize with reopening. We'll see how it all plays out but as I've already said I will buying the selloff if there is one, because one quarter that fails to please the street in most case doesn't outweigh the long term story. I don't see BIGC as a significant threat to SHOP now or in the future if the stock price behavior of the two companies is any indication. BIGC has been largely stagnant while SHOP has risen 60 percent since May and even more than that since BIGC first became public. In addition, BIGC has failed to make a dent in SHOP's key metrics, such as margins. So overall I remain a bull on SHOP regardless of what happens on Wednesday."
How low will it go? What’s your guess? I am hoping for 1200 to buy more shares but it’s unlikely…many of us longs want it to drop so we can buy more. We are unphased by price drops.

"See what I mean about this company? I'll bet the TeamSHOP Scouts were absolutely salivating at their prospects today. Is correction in the air? Probably. It always happens. Resets, whatever. Is this, that? Dunno. red green.But once again, here is Shopify, so sideways it's almost laughable: Shop.to tanked -$1.20cad/share -0.06% on 50% volumes. A bit more in the US -$7.13 -0.48% at 95% volume. With a weird price spread - on the exchange. Something in the money markets?). This is about -1% of the original $100/sh price of the 2017 investment bunch. All they did was hang on, Q after Q after Q after Q (taking profits as necessary), and not sell, correction after inevitable market correction. Shopify price has never given back as much as the market wants to take, not nearly. Sometimes they even go green when everything else is tanking. Just not today.But we have always expected to give back much more than we ever have. This is true of every market correction in the past 20 quarters. People laughed the first time I called this my recession-safe investment, and a ""value"" investment. I maintain my thesis regardless. I bear witness to the rebirth of the American entrepreneurial Spirit with every e/r, and every builtwith update.Re today's messy market, there are 46 businesses in my (relatively) balanced portfolio, and while there was a little green, not a single gain was >1% (go jnj, for actually placing on the leaderboard for the first time in...5yrs? But green is green. Even boring investments can sometimes shine.)Everyone still strapped in? Shopify is now a business hybrid, part growth, but matured into profitability too. A ""safer bet"" than it has ever been before.I had this thought around being institutionally driven. Scouts talk about this like it's a bad thing, like they will suddenly flood the market with Shopify shares. It won't happen. For them too, this is a long term investment, a next-gen brkH, IBM, aapl, amzn or any of the great, mature divvy players of today. It's not in their interests to unload. Foresight - or rather, the lack thereof, has been repeatedly demonstrated by the waves of non-shareholding investors that pass through here. So easy to be a strong hand investor in Shopify. It gave me patience to stick with other long term plays that I might have been inclined to abandon, but are proving richly rewarding today! Happy Investing Everybody!"

"When I first bought this stock over 8 weeks ago, I was very positive. After 8 weeks of chop. It is trading from a low of $1390 to high $1650, but no real direction. It appears that everyone waits for a dip, they buy, stock goes up, they sell, stock goes down they buy, stock goes up they sell, its a YoYo stock. I guess if that is your idea of trading, I guess it works. That means it's time to sell, I will wait for another dip and then buy and wait for it to go back up. I understand the play now."

"Two key indicators I use to time my SHOP buys. Relative strength index and MACD. With RSI you want to buy when it’s in the 40s or less, and with MACD you want to buy when the MACD line falls below the signal line. MACD line was below the signal a few days ago, I bought and now the stock has moved 40 points. Technical analysis isn’t the end all be all to knowing when to buy a stock, but it certainly doesn’t hurt. The MACD line is usually a solid indicator of what direction a stock price is going to move in."

"If you wondering why Shopify dropped yesterday; look at insider selling. John Phillips sold $17 Million. The share price was up $20 in the morning but ending up -$40.Tuesday morning the share price was up over $30 and ended up down $20 as Tobi the CEO sold over $10 Million. He does this every week. I know it is part of the incentive plan but they are not forced to exercise their options, they do it because they believe the share price is grossly overvalued. If it was undervalued they wouldn't be selling. I know some of you don't care but if $MS gets fed up with the insider selling and they sell off their $6 Billion market share it will be a big problem for Shopify share holders."

Retail sales disappointments are dragging down the market today, and quite frankly I don't understand why anybody is shocked they disappointed. If you know anything about the current market conditions you could smell this coming from a mile away. The market will shrug it off soon.

"I always like to say if you can't make up your mind to invest in a company visit their stores and look around, or in the case of SHOP, do a mock trial of launching a business and take it as far as you can go. That's ultimately what drove me to invest in 2017. I wasn't interested in launching a business as I already had the same job I still have today and I enjoy it very much. But I tried out the SHOP product and was amazed at how easy and simple the process was. Not something a monkey could quite do but it certainly fit the mold of Digital Business Launching For Dummies. I could tell just by my mock trial that this potentially would become something big. And I was right more than I ever could have imagined. So do the see, touch, and feel approach for all companies you are considering investing in. Ask yourself was your experience good, did the products perform as advertised, and had you ever used anything before that was quite as good? Then you throw in what the sell side research says on top of that and do financial analysis, or, have your financial advisor do it for you. That's how to successfully invest."

"Hello New GXO Shareholders! I've been long on XPO since Jan2017, only 4 months longer than one of my other darling stocks, Shopify where I do most of my research and hanging out. SHOP & XPO have been connected to XPO through Shopify's wholly owned subsidiary 6 River Systems, a robotics company that Shop acquired for about $500mln in late 2019, and which has been developing business independently of Shopify as well. I think of them as Shopify's secret weapon.I was checking out an article about some of GXO's blue-chip customers, and noted that Nestle was near the top of the list. Nestle is also one of Shopify's earliest ShopPlus merchants! So then I searched GXO + Shopify, and found 6RS's shout out to GXO on ipo: "" 6 River Systems 8,271 followers 1d ""Our team would like to congratulate GXO Logistics, Inc. on their launch and going public on the NYSE. Thank you for being our partner and including us in your big day. "" I like that last sentence, a lot.So XPO was one of the earliest testers/adopters of the Chuck System. The relationship won't be touted on Shopify finance pages, because 6RS moves in the background. But I have stated that I believe the power hub of Shopify is shifting to the Shopify Fulfillment Network (SFN), which is 6RS. Shopify likes to do things away from spotlights. I wasn't concerned about the recent release of various executives, because of the real action is happening at 6RS.Mr Jacobs and Mr. Lutke are two very smart men. I'm sure Mr. Wilson is too. Talk about unlocking value!GXO is partnered with Shopify, right out of the gate. This is the first time I've seen it in print, no more speculation, and I'm pretty excited! Go $SHOP Go $XPO Go$GXO !!(Sorry for the global posting, I don't do it very often, but this is pretty big, and is not new territory.

Shopify also recently acquired the team behind Primer, an Oakland based augmented reality home design app. The deal marked the first publicly announced acquisition acquired since it acquired three companies in 2019, across a span of six months.The accelerated investment and acquisition strategy comes as Shopify has seen notable growth in revenue, income and gross profit over the last year, bolstered by the shift to e-commerce. In the first quarter of this year, Shopify increased it's total revenue by 110 percent year over year, while gross profit was up 117 percent.The Shopify tidal wave of making investments and acquisitions seems to be accelerating and many of these investments could turn into 100 to 1000 bagger for Shopify!"
"I have to laugh at people who call SHOP dramatically overvalued, or an inflated bubble, especially when valuation is getting more reasonable by the quarter. 4 years ago SHOP had a PE of 14000. Now it's less than 100. With a 25-27 percent growth rate forecasted out over the next 5 years. All this is a proof the PE has shrank dramatically even with the dramatic price growth. The institutions clearly know this, as well as the intelligent investor. Institutional ownership continues to climb despite the protests of Intellectual and the other bears. I was buying the whole way down from February to May and now not only has the loss been completely erased but my share ownership has risen dramatically."
"SHOP and TTD have both taken it on the nose lately. They may not have gotten a lot of love the past 2 weeks but that won’t last. The main reason the two names have gotten back down to the levels they are at is due to the turbulence in the general market, not company specific news. I bought both this morning. Soon my decisions will be rewarded. Not a question of if these names will rally but when. The growth trade is still very much on and value is flatlining, especially when one looks at value ETFs. My bet it is on growth for the long haul."
SHOP will hit $2000.
"Let’s face the truth. Harsh, unfortunately.1) Shopify stores cannot generate 42 billion of revenue in 3 months. It is more than P&G and Coca-cola combined. How much do you spend in Shopify stores and how much you spend on these 2 brands? It is no-brainer that this figure is forged.2) Shopify does not have any system to process payments (9.5 million computer equipment is a joke). All is done by Stripe. As a result revenue from Shopify payments should be accounted on net basis not gross and decreased at least by 70%.3) Sales and marketing costs are not temporary. It is cost of supporting Shopify stores during trial period and providing services for big companies whom Shopify signs to promote themselves. Shopify doesn’t generate income from them (ex. Staples and Fenty Skin). In fact, these big companies even don’t’ have Shop Pay services. You can check it on their websites. Those costs are COGS.4) R&D expenses are not temporary either. In 3 year 1.5 billion spent on R&D haven’t generated any asset. Most probably R&D expenses are just developing new website templates. That should be treated as COGS, not R&D. Worse scenario that is just stealing money from the company.5) Shopify can’t develop. All they do is buy minority interest in their Suppliers (Stripe, AFRM, GLBE). There is no justification for buying 0.5% of Stripe for 350 million instead of developing own payment system.6) Top management is leaving the company. Insiders hold less than 1% of company.7) There is no way for Shopify to not lose its revenue growth while all other ecommerce companies do. Shopify is either operating on Mars or forging their figures.8) All these indicates that company is actually losing money for years and the only thing that keeps them alive is frequent SPOs and loan issuance. The longer you hold more you are diluted.9) And finally, what is the maximum revenue? Now 4 bln, of Shopify revenue is generated by claimed 160 bln. revenue from all Shopify Stores. Price to sales ratio if 40. If reasonable ratio is 8, then Shopify stores should generate 900 bln. Revenue. It is 1.5x of Walmart. How realistic it is?"
This is institution driven stock and fair value is $166/share. A lot of Shopify merchants resell from aliexpress or whomever make cheap products (large volume). Isn't this a pyramid scheme or what?
Keep an eye on Affirm as Square bought company like Affirm known as After Pay! So Shopify will likely make a whole lot more money on Affirm going forward as they own ten percent.
I sadly missed out on SHOP but NUVEI will be my salvation 
How much will Shopify rise today in regards to them owning 10% of Affirm after Amazon signed contract with them?
Shopify seems to buck the trend ... a stock that is an elevator up and a staircase down.
"On 6/21/21, I was looking at SHOP and CMG. SHOP was trading in the 1500s and CMG was trading at 1400. I chose SHOP ... what a mistake! Today SHOP is still around 1510-1530. CMG is trading at $1923, a difference of $500 per share, that is $50,000."
Today Polen Capital stated in a letter to investors that Shopify has at least 30% earning power for the next five years. Further Shopify has GMV of over 150 billion and we see those numbers going up also.
Look For Shopify To Launch Shopify Audience this quarter which is an advertising tool that allows advertisers to use Shopify's data to target ads on Facebook and Google. This will be another significant stream of income and has been even suggested for months by some analysts.
Can we get to 1500 by Friday????
Bought a share this morning. Love this position. Long hold.
"This is old news, but I thought I would share it with newer investors. I often mention Shopify in reference to entrepreneurial programs and competitions tied to the educational systems in Canada. This is about the launch of the DevDegree, a specialized Hons Ba, on top of their CS degree. (YorkU) There were 8 students in the first cohort of Sept2018. They'll graduate with 4500hrs of mentored/practical from first year onward, Shopify pays tuition, pays intern wages while they work and learn. Two schools (YorkU & CarltonU) in Canada, and Make School in Silicon Valley. The first calls will graduate Spring 2020.The website is devdegree dot ca - Worth a visit to the site. Insanely good opportunity It's open to pretty much anybody just going into Computer Science. Students can apply before being accepted into their main school.The first class will graduate between Spring2022-23. Building their future leaders.https://betakit.com/shopify-launches-dev-degree-program-with-york-university/"
This is awesome! Let’s hope amzn does the same
Sell before this become ZM. Same earnings and revenue !!
"I might wait 2-3 weeks and see what the stock does. Some people are saying SHOP is way overvalued. It would be nice if it dropped to the $1,350 range, but I don't see that happening. I still live this stock for the long term. I could see myself buying 5-10 shares and holding them forever."
"Anyone else here invested in shopify partner $FOBI? They just completed integration with $SHOP, the NR is from this morning! Big potential "
Fed Powell reports current sales of durable goods are 20% higher than they were prepandemic.
"I LOVE this company! Nearly 2% gains on the tsx, >1% down on the Nas, slightly elevated volumes for both. Must have something to do with the Canadian markets being closed on Monday. I've barely paid attention to my portfolio since June. That's the luxury of a solid portfolio. Another offering? It's due. It's Shopify's most direct connection to the pulse of her investors. Gives the company the most control of share price, while gauging investor sentiment, imo. Helps keep the float small, and the company agile. No need for a split.Has anybody else noticed that the most delightful ads, and innovative products on youtube, are Shopify merchants? And many of the major youtube movers and creators have adopted the Shopify Guerilla marketing approach to their sales channels? I think I've spent about c$25k in online purchases this year, >4x that of last year. It doesn't matter that Shopify did not get the bulk of those sales. Amazon didn't either.I spent some time at Squamish/Whistler area. It was very busy with tourists, but the stores were not as busy as I expected them to be. Major staff shortages at the eateries. The west coast has been ravaged by the sun. Specialty shops refer customers to online. Wildfire smoke have driven people indoors, and forced many evacuations. Thousands of people starting over. Online purchasing is critical to them. Just my thoughts today, as I go online to order another $450 VOC air filter to get me through the next few fire seasons. All purchases are now D2C, it's a US company and made in US product. I like controlling how and where I spend my money!Shopify was only in 5th place today, rarely a daily superstar, but a nice July overall. Has anybody notice that builtwith is reporting Site TotalsTotal Live: 3,041,790 PLUS 1,050,483 additional redirects. When did this happen!? Go SHOP!"
"I can’t imagine how john handles himself on a daily basis. Surely his blood pressure is at hypertension levels. He has no understanding of markets. He is literally like the person who has never played baseball in their life going up to bat to hit the 100 mph fastball. Not only does that person not succeed in hitting it by a mile, they freak out when they see how fast that ball is coming. This John and his investment in SHOP in a nutshell. If he wants low volatility he should stick to dividend stocks. SHOP is only suited for people who know and understand the story and are able to roll with the volatility. John is clearly deaf when it comes to all the people including me who have tried to help him. There are some things you just shouldn’t do yourself. If you have a phobia when it comes to investing your money, best to let a financial advisor handle your money for you. Even better, use index funds instead of individual stocks (passive vs. active). Money can be made by not taking risk, but the most profitable investments for me have been using a risk reward scenario with moderate risk."
Shopify smoked earnings and revenues. Subscription growth 70% growth!
"For those who point out that Shopify is a $200bn company with $3bn in earnings: yes, those are two numbers in the raw math. But they miss the analytical point. The analytical point, sorry to those for whom this is teaching a grandmother to suck eggs, is that a PER is a ratio. It comprises two numbers, price and earnings. As earnings go up, arithmetically the PER goes down. Now, unlike, say, a utility company, whose earnings are pretty stable, Shopify’s earnings are growing, and can be expected to grow, very fast and very high. There are several reasons for this. One is a total addressable market of, possibly, $150 billion (45x times Shopify's $3.4 billion in current annual sales). Another related point is – and, in the nicest possible way, this is one sometimes forgottten by Americans – that 75% of the global economy is outside North America. Shopify has engaged with this 75% by making itself available in major world languages such as Spanish, Mandarin, French, German and Japanese. Meaning it can derive revenues from the huge markets that use those languages, and where it is just getting started. Another is its moat of apps, which would be hard and time-consuming to duplicate. All these factors, and more, are why the stock price is where it is: it incorporates the expectation that Shopify is turning into a kind of global operating system for e-commerce. So the earnings question is: how fast and how high? The shorts look at the arithmetic of the PER and say, aren’t the numbers ridiculous; the longs see owning Shopify as being like owning Microsoft back in the 1980s. Good luck to all."
When comparing Amazon and Shopify since the first of the year Shopify has gained over 40 percent while Amazon has gained less than 20 percent. Amazon in the mean time is currently off it's 52 week high of roughly 12 percent while Shopify is off it's high by 7.5 percent. So overall for the year Shopify is out performing Amazon.

Dow Jones News Wire at 1346 Hrs: CIBC states Shopify will achieve 46 percent revenue growth in the 2nd quarter.
"Does the partnership between Binance and Alchemy pay, allowing crypto transactions on Shopify change the outlook of this investment ?"
"Today Motley Fool put out an article stating the strong moat Shopify has and that the financial flexibility will make it extremely difficult for competitors to catch Shopify. I have been saying that same thing for months. Shopify is just to far out front in terms of even subscriptions, fulfillment services, international presence in 175 foreign countries, social commerce channels growth and partnerships along with extensive payment services. Just think they signed with Tic Tok and this doesn't even count Spotify yet. Shopify is big and getting bigger. I can't imagine what revenues will be on Black Friday weekend."
Here's the real question of the day? Why did Amazon partner up with Affirm which they know Shopify owns ten percent of when they could have built there own buy now pay later system themselves?
So glad I bought SHOP back in 2017. This investment has changed my life. Thank you Tobi and the Shopify team. They will have effectively cut my retirement age by at least 5 years.Cheers longs!
Buy shopify at this price or wait for a dip????
1400 coming today
Netflix subscriber growth has slowed with re-opening. Same will happen with SHOP:- stimulus checks dry up- Covid stimulus money ending- mortgage forbearence ending- rent forbearence ending- food and gas pricing rising; less money for disposable income on SHOP sites- More in-person spending as re-opening occurs- FED to stop buying bonds this year; taper to begin in 2022; rates up in 2023- Easy comps on 2nd quarter as sites were still coming online--not so much 3rd and 4th quarter.
"I am a big believer in SHOP, but not nearly as big a believer in Cathie Wood? Is she smart? Yes. I believe long term Ark will be just fine as their biggest holdings are concentrated in names like TSLA, SQ, PYPL, SHOP, and TTD. However the genomics names and the biotechs she owns are extremely high risk. The reason Cathie Wood can afford higher risk than you and I is because she has hundreds of millions, possibly billions, of dollars to play with. Also whenever she sells SHOP shares, she is doing it to keep it from being too overweight in her portfolio. It’s a simple principle…to maintain as close to an equal weighted portfolio as possible you trim as the stock price goes up. She still owns a large amount of SHOP on her books and doesn’t dislike the company in the least. I’m so sick of people in this discussion acting like insider selling and institutional selling is universally bad. Those who say that don’t realize that portfolio management and the rules in general are more of a gray area vs. black and white."
"All these posters like Jamar say SHOP is going to 1400, scoring brownie points with his shortie friends, yet here it is up 24 points. Got any other accurate forecasts for us, Jamar? You can't even get one day right, why should we think your crystal ball forecasts for the next month to 2 months are any more accurate? Lol."
"Indices appear neutral right now but jobless claims and GDP disappointed. We’ll see if that sinks the markets or not. Regardless I’m in SHOP through the good times in the bad, because eventually it always comes out on top."
Shopify tobuy or not to buy. Looking at the charts over the pass two years I noticed that in both years the low of the year came in March and in both years Shopify went on to make new highs going into the year end. So far in 2021 it appears Shopify is setting itself up to do the same. Right now with the Nasdaq making new highs in the off season and getting ready to approach on season trading in September I feel pretty good that Amazon and Shopify are both going to make a run as it appears there is a lot of international money sitting on the sidelines and getting ready to enter the market. So it would appear that it looks like another good year for Shopify. As a result I would say that they again will follow that trend and I would be a buyer at this point looking for Shopify at the 1700 to 1800 range.
Long term hold for me. I don’t care about these short term fluctuations. We know for a fact the company is growing at a rapid pace. It will continue to grow and impress. Solid balance sheet. 
Christ I lost my chance to unload my calls yesterday morning and missed my chance load up more today
2016 - got in at ~40...didn’t sell (or buy) since. Let people say whatever...the fact remains that Shopify is an extremely well run company in an area of the economy with tremendous growth opportunity. Not selling my shares anytime soon! 1000 shares at 40 was 40k at the time...glad i made my investment
"Markets are treading water today ahead of the Fed minutes. We'll see which way stocks end up going, but even in the worst case scenario, SHOP should only turn negative by a small margin. It is going to take company specific news to get SHOP to drop 100 points in a day down to Jamar's remote $1400 price target today."
SHOP has spent fractions of the money they have raised by share offerings. If they are going to “compete” with AMZN as all are saying then they should put their money actually to work. FOBI is to pacify that they are trying to expand business. Lets not forget about the executives that left a few months ago. At least TSLA is buying land and building factories. I see nothing from SHOP but more and more stock offerings.
"Love how ARK unloaded 21030 shares on August 24th and the price was able to spike up to 1550 so they could get an excellent sales price. If you think SHOP and CMG are trading normally, than you have to be kidding yourself."
Shopify's President Harley Finkelstein just tweeted that 67% of the young consumers 18-34 just moved the majority of there shopping online last year. That's up 50% and were not going back to the way the things were. This is the future of retail.
"Come on Shop let’s do that long awaited split. I know plenty of retail investors who want in, but can’t afford the valuation. Let’s give them an entry point and reward your longs with even more SP growth potential."
