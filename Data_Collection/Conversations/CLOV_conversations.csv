"This thing was down as much as 4% today, now price is at break even and it can’t move. Funny how that works. Obvious manipulation is obvious. HODL!"
Danny is either a bot or someone paid buy hedge funds. I can't come up with any other reason for his behaviour.

"Andrew Toy CTO of CLOV.""I am frequently asked why Clover Health started a health plan as opposed to a software startup that made Clover Assistant and sold it to health plans. My answer: this would be like trying to sell electric car batteries to the car industry in 2010. If Tesla had tried that, they’d have been told that there’s no market for electric cars and it’s just easier to make money by improving miles-per-gallon or building hybrids."""
"Clover is a great company, own 5000 shares @8.10 going to $15 by year end.........This is a real company and true Asset in ,my opinion...."
