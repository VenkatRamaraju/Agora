"Squeeze coming next week, buy now"
Shorts added again yesterday so they are betting we tank from $7.50 down. If we have some good news on earnings next week this could cause a nice squeeze. Just hold or buy more if you can.
It’s getting really tough for the shorts to keep this down.
"I am sitting on 175,000 shares with covered calls that expired yesterday. I will NOT be writing more as I think we will see a nice jump here soon."
Very good news coming soon
"We just need some good news and Clover will run up real fast, expect earnings report early Nov. to show large growth and then all the shorts will be rushing out the door at once, looking forward to that......."
"Yep, I did it again bought 500 more at 7.60....I believe"
It’s that time pushing through 7.50 buy now
"Sorry shorts large investor just bought , burnt toast it’s over"
Who is really selling at this SP.
Should I sell or hold.
I keep my 4k this week from covered calls. good. have a good weekend everyone.
"Look at last 2 days price action in OCGN; Classic short squeeze in progress in this meme stock. A beauty to behold. CLOV's day is also coming, sooner or later."
Here the chart going into earnings!!! $9.50 is my predictionCLOV for the BIG Score!!!!
Loading time!
"No volume , ppl. Are buying knowing this will be over 15 soon"
Added 2200 this AM.
"think this entire board is underwater and losing money on this stock, that is why everyone making things up, so optimistic, looking to earnings, making up terms I never heard of. Wake up, sell and take your loss, there are so many great plays to be had, this IS NOT one of them."
Sell if you have a gimp suit. Otherwise hold I have made a fortune on game & amc just be patient only those who can stomach big fluctuations will make Money don’t listen to the fud short sellers this is a game changer patience pays
What do you think the price will be after earnings?
"By 2023..this will be over 100, I will wait it out!!"
Buy buy buy and hold
"Everyone is buying now at very low price, just a truck load @ this price ."
Just BUY and HOLD
At least my GREE is going up
"book it people!!!!!! 6 before 8 .... Danny the man who is never wrong said it. LOL .. BHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAawesome stuff, cannot make it up. BHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
"All the pummeling that this stock and shareholders are taking for months on end and yet here I am...able to sleep well that this will pay off handsomely in a couple of years (x10), if not sooner. Know the company you invest in and everything else is just noise..."
"Everyone is thinking Nov 8, meaning it is priced in. Or how do you know Nov 8 is gonna be good ????"
"No seller only buyer , get in now great opportunity"
It will move up by earning
Winning isn’t done overnight
"@Danny. ""Temporary Network Error, please try again later"". Bwahahaha! Deleting your posts again?"
Going to pop soon
Serious question: how much money are the shorts losing with holding/maintaining their positions?
"Danny - did you just buy puts or something? LOL, keep working it, girl! :)"
It sure is a coincidence how it always ends up exactly at max pain every single Friday. For 16 Fridays in a row. And they don't even care how obvious it looks.
You see pain I see opportunity.
The hedge funds want us at or right around $7.50 to wipe out the options buyers yet again.
"Something is cooking here..this will pop, patience is the key  "
"Buyers coming in late in the day, great set up for tomorrow !!"
I am all in.
One step forward and 4 steps backward fml
Just bought 3000 shares
Just bought 4000 more shares
"Im dreaming  clover is having an ok day? Nooo, something must be cooking"
Hey Danny. In one of my accounts I sold $10 calls. Tell your boss to see that my shares are assigned today! Thanks!
Don’t really care about the short term. I am long and the price is 80 in 1.5 years. Cheers
Tomorrow 8
10700 shares Avg 9.50No SellMy target $50+Hoping tht wil be in 2022 
Keep buying Shorts will cover...This is a gift
It might be a good battle today at Max Pain $7.50? It would be nice to finish at $8.00 or at least substantially above $7.50 ($7.75) to make the Hedge Funds suffer a bit.
Earnings after the close on November 8th.
"Wow ,look at that 7.61 here we go , buy now"
"Awesome,, first time in a long time has stayed strong all the way to the end.. This is taking off soon, seat belts on , cell phones off & fold the tray tables .."
CLOV $12-$15 by earnings. Possibly $25.
"Still eating Ramen boys! Every penny going into more and more CLOV. I'll buy the dip until I'm completely broke, there is no better play in the entire market right now than CLOV. Within 1-2 years it'll become a ten bagger. Good luck fam!"
Only a few more weeks until Max Pain puts us at $9 so there is light at the end of the tunnel and the option strangle hold breaks us out of this range of $7.50 - $8.
sold all my WISH and am ALL-IN on CLOV
"ok, Danny. I am selling all my shares tomorrow. LOL. ok?"
This is the one play I avg at $17 and yes i'm losing. I won't sell but I won't buy anymore until I see some stability.
$10 next week!
"We will have another spike/mania latest by new year, anyone agree?"
Added 3000 shares today
"book it, book it ... Danny! 8 before 6. LOL. BHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!youse will loose money today and will join the kneeling club. BHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA!"
Take a look at the 12\17 Call options from $9 to $20. A ton of money making big bets this is going way up
"I'm not gonna lie to you guys, after all, you're all family...I'm going to buy this company on every single dip until I'm flat broke...I'm going to skip lattes and mcdoubles in the off chance I can scoop up even one more little share...Every quarter I find, penny in the couch, side hustle revenue, you name it, its going into this stock...I'll eat Ramen for the next 2 years...The moment she goes Free Cash Flow positive, ill be eating Ramen with a diamond crusted fork.Good luck yall."
"Would guess this doesn't close Friday above $8, options. Me im 1200 shares at $10.49 , probably alot of holders at the same or higher. Bought on the reddit pump, but looking at this company im ok holding, andwill buy more on these dips , earnings in a few weeks, hyper growth stock, like buying Tesla 10 years ago, I believe in the Company, and can wait a few years. I hope we get out of the MEME classification and investors see the potential in this company , just my take , not financial advice"
"Retail investors love valuing revenue growth over profits, and they have more than enough cash to absorb losses. Very bullish for the next 1-2 year."
"Clover is a solid well run company there is no real reason for this stock to go that low. Earning is in 2 weeks and this should be priced in the 20's just on the current evaluation, This is very manipulated but sooner or later it will bounce back. Good luck longs."
"What it’s that time , “POWER HOUR”"
"see you all next week when I pop in to buy more and to announce I have more. till then, buy and hold and be patient. Also, ignore the bashers."
Just bought another 500 shares. @ 7.51
Wow grabbed a few hundred shares at 7.38. In all was able to add 3000 shares to my CLOV portfolio today.
Slow and steady wins
Why is goin up???
Buy now & hold
So predictable. How do we break the manipulation that these HFS have on CLOV?
Wait for Squeeze coming.
all you have to do is sell cover calls on your position over a period of time and you have zero losses. facts people
8 then 9 then 11 then skyrocket
Is this stock legit ?
Good buy point for New investors...... I have 15 k shares and will hold till $15. Clover is a real company and excellent Asset......Adding new members and expanding in many states. They have a awesome cash burn rate that will last for at least 2.5 years to expand and offer new products/services................................
Computer generated to close above 7.50￼
I bought my first lot on 02-05-2021. Since then between my Webull and TDA accounts I added 26 additional lots. I'll add more before the end of the year.
They trying really hard to keep the price low …: we have to come together and keep moving frwd buy and hold
Amazing ended up again at $7.50 to wipe out all options.
This is a gift..
"I'm actually super tired of worrying about stocks...it's driving me insane these days,I think crypto investment is by far a sure deal than stock.."
Baillie Gifford - investment management firm around since 1908 made a decent bet on CLOV last quarter. They purchased a little north of 5 million shares. Longs in good company with more good news coming soon with earnings and upgrades.
Keep this down and pay more interest
Maybe they beat the numbers this time.
"Danny baby!!!! you have it wrong, I am under your skin. BHAHAHAHAHAI am down 200k or so, but keep on getting income from covered calls and waiting. Its a lot less then 200k loss but who is counting .... ahh, you are of course. LOL but, but, but ..... book it my boy! LOL"
"Siguler Gulf Advisers, LLC invests in CLOV at approximately $8.61. Summit Rock Advisers, LLC invests in CLOV with 210,639 shares comprising 0.92% of its portfolio. Average price $7.39 - $12.33. Source: GuruFocus per Webull CLOV News tab. To my CLOV team: Keep holding and accumulating, even if only a few shares per week."
"ok, fine. I will buy another 10k. LOL"
8USD is always doable..I loaded up my truck today 
"OCGN tore through sellers today and climbed 10% at finish. Gnomes are saying this one has no future or prospects and it went up only because it us a meme stock. Well, well well...let's see how it unfolds going forward."
Hour=power buying more now
Sold all $CLOV shares with 3% profits and bought more $BB. Will use a bit profits buy CLOV options after earnings. I’m not taking earning risks here. 
This is flat for the last month nothin changes
"Just Bought another 5k shares @ $7.40.........Now have 15k shares ap $8.50, This a $15 stock and a solid company. I haver Clover as my health insurer and they are Excellent. Listen dont pay attention to the daily noise and nonsense, and hold long term. Ive been doing this for 50 years and made a ton of money......... Patience and owning a real Company/asset will earn you many Rewards !!!!"
Danny enjoyed the board all along but but time is over now
"go, Danny! go, Danny! manage your losses. LOL"
"if you think this stock is a good buy at 6, you may miss the boat entirely. if you do, do, do think that this will go up, buy some now. My 2c. ... oooga booga. LOL"
Uptrend pattern holding going up
"I love how the paid chills come out. These guys are concerned about retail loosing money, they must be our angels here to protect us from loosing money."
"I’m in for the long run . 3 years or more . Sold SHOP in 2017 , Moderna fall of 2020, good profit, but big mistakes. If I held worth millions instead of thousands!"
"Cmon , Lucky Clover, Its time to Go up up up!!"
When it finally goes up it will be VERY Fast and then alot of people will be Kicking themselves for not buying it this LOW!!! CLOV for the BIG Score!!!!!
"Remember..Bashers are buyers trying to get in at lower prices..This stock is future gold..they know it..Otherwise, they would not be here.."
Holy cow! Look at the 12\17 calls. Huge volume all the way $20. Either someone knows something or there are a lot of gamblers.
"Why is Danny even here, what's your purpose of posting that u hate this stock???"
breaks support at 7.38 it goes right to 6.80....................
"Hedge funds win again, but just a matter of time now."
Remember this: the only reason this stock isn’t double digits now is because of shorts selling artificial shares not because of actual valuation. It only takes one whale that comes along to change the entire dynamic and create panic repurchasing. $8 will be here any moment and soon $9+. In the meantime best way to fight the crime is buy and hold.
Market goes up...clov stays same or goes down...market goes down...clov goes down double....seems like complete exploitation of SP.
So someone wants me to believe 10 mil shares sold off today just prior to what will be stellar ER...come on...scam.
"Make money buy & hold , investors know they’ll have a awesome earnings report. Buy low"
A penny no less than 20 .. and it will happen faster than you imagine.
Only buyers here
Danny's last resort ... desperate - create new IDs to post here! BHAHAHAHAHAHAHABHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAA
20 plus - coming
To the moon today!
Cant wait for this to jump
Bought more 3000 shares a@$7.28 lol
I feel a bad moon rising!!!
Time to buy again.
Just to show you how bad the advice here can be: Luke Skywalker advised to sell CLOV today as we are heading higher to buy LCID at 40 ...which is now trading at 33.
"This stock goanna end up like Wish. Good company, good revenue, too many retail buys in it, so MM is taking our money give it to Hedge Fund. I'm still holding since June. I'm not adding until it hit another new low... in a hope of break even."
The train is leaving
Over 8 tomorrow
"Seems like optimism abounds...............GREAT, I would venture to say that 99% of the people on this board are underwater. I bought this and I bought that, the only problem is, the more you all buy the lower it goes, soon people will be buying at 6.50 and think they have a great play. Your are what your record says you are, NOISE to one is losing money as far as I can tell. Bought KAVL at 1.50 yesterday and sold at 2.80 this morning, that's not noise, its a good play."
OMG I believe we're being manipulated!! LOL
"Buy low , sell high and repeat "
Bag holder from 15. Thinking about adding 50k shares to bring my average down to 9. What do you guys think?
This is an extremely easy play..no where but up.....these services are vital to Americans....how on earth can this be spun differently.
Ooops.. What's happening??
Finish strong buy now
What are the chances of CLOV having a short squeeze?
Finally after 7 months making $$ from OCGN and I know CLOV’s turn will come and patience will be paid eventually
"My target price is always 8USD , AND ALWAYS NEVER GO WRONG AND SELL IT...WAIT FOR FEW DAYS AND ALWAYS PULL BACK...keep buying at this price level.. EASY "
NOV 8TH...that's when we see!!!
"Oh snap, we ended the day in Green!!"
Notice something weird happened today? The traders did not cash out at the end of the day to tank the stock. Maybe we go up into earnings. Hope all the weak hands out.
Does anyone know how the earnings report is shaping up?
I have a funny feeling for some reason CLOV will a great week coming up
YF deletin everything..at $26.32 come get me 
"No worries here , buy this low price"
"@CloverHealth is not only a Medicare company. It is also a tech company. When they anounce other sources of revenues from their healthcare tech, that would be a really big news for investors.@VivekGaripalli @andrewtoy @chamath$CLOV #CLOV"
The market needs to get on bipolar meds
Great doji in a weekly candle .. just before the earnings report. Waiting for next week! Very bullish(:
"Oh boy the paid bashers are going to come on here in full force today trying to distract, scare and confuse us once again. They can’t stand CLOV being green especially when the market’s red. Hold strong folks! Patience will be rewarded on this one."
Going no where
"Up 8,000 on gree, buying more CLOV"
there's a lot of first time investors out there that will sell at this price all they see is it going down and they don't ever see it coming back up again so they panic and they sell I used to do that when I first started investing never again
This stock should do well now that the expanded Medicare bill has been kept out of the social infrastructure spending bill!
where's my squeeze?!
This feels like my past holdings in $CLOV and Wirecard. Bullish LT. A small position so not going to crystalise the loss at least for now
When you know you know....
Manipulation at finest for this and $clov
Bought 4000 shares today @ $7.40. Long-term reward stock
