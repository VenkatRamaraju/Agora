"Buyers coming in late in the day, great set up for tomorrow !!"
Shorts added again yesterday so they are betting we tank from $7.50 down. If we have some good news on earnings next week this could cause a nice squeeze. Just hold or buy more if you can.
Amazing ended up again at $7.50 to wipe out all options.
This is the one play I avg at $17 and yes i'm losing. I won't sell but I won't buy anymore until I see some stability.
Good buy point for New investors...... I have 15 k shares and will hold till $15. Clover is a real company and excellent Asset......Adding new members and expanding in many states. They have a awesome cash burn rate that will last for at least 2.5 years to expand and offer new products/services................................
What do you think the price will be after earnings?
Finish strong buy now
"Awesome,, first time in a long time has stayed strong all the way to the end.. This is taking off soon, seat belts on , cell phones off & fold the tray tables .."
It might be a good battle today at Max Pain $7.50? It would be nice to finish at $8.00 or at least substantially above $7.50 ($7.75) to make the Hedge Funds suffer a bit.
"I love how the paid chills come out. These guys are concerned about retail loosing money, they must be our angels here to protect us from loosing money."
Notice something weird happened today? The traders did not cash out at the end of the day to tank the stock. Maybe we go up into earnings. Hope all the weak hands out.
"Remember..Bashers are buyers trying to get in at lower prices..This stock is future gold..they know it..Otherwise, they would not be here.."
The train is leaving
This is an extremely easy play..no where but up.....these services are vital to Americans....how on earth can this be spun differently.
"No volume , ppl. Are buying knowing this will be over 15 soon"
Loading time!
"Oh boy the paid bashers are going to come on here in full force today trying to distract, scare and confuse us once again. They can’t stand CLOV being green especially when the market’s red. Hold strong folks! Patience will be rewarded on this one."
Great doji in a weekly candle .. just before the earnings report. Waiting for next week! Very bullish(:
"Still eating Ramen boys! Every penny going into more and more CLOV. I'll buy the dip until I'm completely broke, there is no better play in the entire market right now than CLOV. Within 1-2 years it'll become a ten bagger. Good luck fam!"
