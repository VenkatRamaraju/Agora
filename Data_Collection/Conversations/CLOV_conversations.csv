$2090 stock by year end
New price target $24!!!
How is this not over $20 by now?
new price target by analyst: $16!!!! let's rock!!!
"Time to move UP past $10, $12, $20!!!!CLOV for the BIG SCORE!!!!!"
Futures Rollover is tomorrow. Last time we had Futures Rollover? 6/8. Take a look if you don’t remember at what happened that day. 
Big volume starting to come buy now
Reverse Repos now 1.218 trillion. A new record. Something big is happening.
Tons of CLOV YOLO posts on WSB now.
"If $clov need take more than 1 year to see a significant growth in the stock price, why invest now? Lmaooo there are plenty of stocks can return good money in short term."
Some V shaped recovery happening right now!!! Will run up quickly!!!
I am happy spammers like Denny exist... good sign
Still not selling
The gamma squeeze is coming
Wait till open enrollment next month 25.00+++ easy with the territory the serve for healthcare. Southern hit states. Buy Buy Buy CLOV...!!!
clover will provide door to door covid vaccination...
Panic selling nothing more
Apex “put” @$8 sorry for you loss . Try call at $8.50 next week!
I thought big things were going to happen on September 9th here it is September 10th and we're still going red SMH
Buy $BB and $CLOV. $bbig
"I've never seen a stock like Clover. I've never seen a stock that absolutely can NOT hold its gains. Ever. It goes to 28 in June. Then straight back down to 7. If it suddenly goes up 50 cents during the day, it immediately plummets right back down 5 minutes later. And very rarely, when it does gain 22% in one day, it loses all of its gains the very next day. It's extremely disappointing."
Drop AH because there is a news article that Cowen gave 7$ price target. But it is a rumor - it is not confirmed. Last Cowen price target was 15$ though. It is most likely not true and was spread to make retail investors sell.
Next week should be a very interesting week. Hopefully management drops a  at their presentation on Thursday. Have a nice long weekend. 
If CLOV goes up that's good! If CLOV goes down I buy!! Either way I'm going UP!!!
You guys still have money to donate for options?Haaaaaaa Holding my shares strong  Not even sell 1 shares until 2025
"Short squeeze is imminent on these stocks,$BBIG, $CLOV, $SPRT, $ROOT"
Let's be real those who bought at $10.95 yesterday is better than those who bought in the 15's or even the 20's so stop     
"“We’re proud to partner with Clover Health and share the same ambition to improve the cancer experience for their members, while we work together to improve outcomes and lower costs for everyone involved.""Thyme Care’s intuitive technology generates actionable insights that make it possible to identify at-risk members earlier and offer relevant support based on where members are in their cancer journey in order to close gaps in care and drive value. Now, every Clover Health member in New Jersey with a suspected or confirmed cancer diagnosis will have access to a personalized team of physician-guided oncology nurses and resource specialists who will provide education, guidance, and advocacy while offering support and coordinating with providers every step of the way."
It'll get pushed to just under $8 for tomorrow because of options. Happens every week. Can't wait to see a pop in share price eventually.
"The volume-price pattern is exactly the same as last run up, except that this time we’ve doubled the revenue and would probably go to 50-100 range"
Dark pools were never designed to allow a market maker to blunt supply demand forces on SP so the market maker could impose its will on SP. This needs to stop now.
Can we see $9 today?
When do we moon?
"This will be a $2,000 stock some day"
define volatile = CLOV
Everbody buy and hold if you wanna win big!!!!
Danny tomorrow 
"As I said before: the more manipulation that occurs, the more violent the upside swing will be (which is inevitable). Also, warrants are entirely out of the equation now. Done and done. Have a good evening Clover Health family; we are still in early innings. $CLOV"
Who’s ready for $20+?
Buy Buy Buy right now
Can we see $9 ever again?
let's go! !! Buy him too! !! Buy her too! !! Dad also buys !! Mom also buys! !! I can't buy it because I don't have money! !!
$15 AH tonight! $25 tomorrow!
"There is an SSR (short selling restriction) in place today. Buy up as much as you can, This reminds me of end of May/beginning of June, when the price ran from $7 to $28. We can do it again. Let’s squeeze the naked short selling criminals, It’s payback time."
"Cowen and Company LLC, who recently came out with the downgrade has 35500 put options. You can’t make this up. HODL! Source: https://fintel.io/so/us/clov/cowen-and-company"
When conference
anybody else realize that this chart looks like the amc chart before it popped to 60$
"More big buys after market, if they wanted the price to go up they would buy iEX open market. HOLD HOLD HOLD"
I’ll wait it out. I waited last time and clov printed.
CLOV now accelerating in reddit trending list way beyond GME and AMC! Tomorrow could be incredible starting premarket trade.
strange chart today. flatlined in more ways than one.
Fully manipulated by cowen who bought puts first and then lower the price target while the fundamentals of $Clov are improving. Buy the dips to let them cover at much much higher !
never sell
"Why are people paying $.23 for $8.50 call options expiring tomorrow?This is why CLOV will never go up. All these reddit crowds just keep buying these lottery tickets, which lose 99% of the time.Can't complain (I have been selling them like hotcakes), but it just doesn't make any sense."
So after ripping up 23% yesterday on 180M shares we're supposed to believe that it is completely normal and natural that it stayed at 9.43 for 6 hours the day after ?
$17.50 a share will happen Danny boy . In two years fro now that’s 50% a year . 5 times the return on the S&p 500
"I’d be nervous with $CLOV if I hadn’t gone through this before, especially $BTU 9 months ago. So much FUD & negativity 9 months ago. Then *very suddenly* all the FUD stopped and the stock went from $1 to $20 now. I have faith in $CLOV. FUD won’t deter us. Only makes us stronger."
Its happening!!!!
Bought 900 shares for the dip 
..wow..where did all these bashers come from.probably work for cowen!!So many new people!!
Very strong feeling Google may acquire Clove....$100
$1m buy at $8.17 just printed… take a hint..Not financial advise..
"$CLOV $WISH $WIMI If my daddy taught me one thing about life, it was never quit and never pull out. CLOV WIMI and WISH until we moon"
"The more ""Shorts"" I see on here . . . I know we are going the right way!!! "
My latest post with company news release link was deleted by yahoo. Looks like news and substance is not tolerated here !

Tomorrow! Let's rock the Casbah...
She knows how to do it and she will. Patience .. I am not excited about glowing green and not scared of flashing red .. I wait patiently and reap my profits. it will take time? I have full of it.
Where is the big news about Clover that we were told was going to be announced today?
I know we had a lot of weak hands folding recently. I believe we now have a better class of retail investors willing to hold this long term. That’s why I’m not making any short term predictions. I can just affirm that we are massively oversold and undervalued. My PT is $30 p/s. $CLOV
"2 new entrants in the Clover Sweepstakes1.Citigroup came aboard on 9.3.21 with Neutral rating on CLOV and price target of $ 102. Cowen Co(manages $12.5B in assets) with a price target of $ 7 lolps Little that Cowen knows, that we have a shark of a market maker here- Citadel.Citadel likes to eat the lunch of small hedge funds and molest their girlfriends.Citadel poured millions in Jan Feb in GameStop,went long as their small hedge fund brethren were shorting and eventually went bankrupt, thanks to folks like Honest Ken of the Citadel fame.Last month Ken Griffin did it again, bought a large stake in AMC and from $ 30 the movie chain is now $ 50. The british hedge fund that came 1 week before Citadel into the shorting of AMC will now lose its pants and Citadel will reap...bw aha ha ha.Lets see, if Ken can screw Cowen the same way..."
Added 100.
All eyes on CLOV NOW !!!

"The THUGS are trying again this morning and we will see what happens, but please don't give them any of your shares. GO CLOV"
Huge buys in the dark pool during after hours yday
"Wow, MF had a positive article about Clov."
@MatthewP. wrong AMC and GameStop don't make money this company is going to make millions and millions
"I'm going to stop getting excited when it goes up. Because every time it does, it just immediately drops straight back down again. So why even get happy? There's no point in it. These hedge funds and short sellers seem to have all of the power. They have full control over Clover's share price. They have an iron grip on it, and they are never letting go."
Shorts have played around with CLOV too long and now are about to lose an eye.
is this ever gonna squeeze?
Tomorrow will close over 9.10
Don't get me wrong. Today was a great day. But it would have been even better if we didn't have certain people whose only goal in life is to have enough money for a down payment on a Ford Focus. Oh well. It is what it is. I'm going to be very interested to see what happens in the after hours.
They won the week. They will not win the year.
"Cl Clover Health $ CLOV will provide participants of the Medicare Advantage program with COVID-19 vaccination at homeClover Health has announced that it will provide assistance in home vaccination against COVID-19, which is especially important for supporting medically complex Clover members. The company partnered with MedArrive, a healthcare logistics and services platform, to launch a vaccination program in New Jersey."
"2,399 shares @ $7.64- I posted my position on Reddit yesterday. We are going to squeeze back to $28+"
"95% of investors thought $AMC going from $10 to $72 was impossible. Yet it happened. Took 3 weeks. It is *absolutely* possible with $CLOV as well. When I sign off with “$CLOV to $100,” I truly mean it. Cherry on top? $CLOV is a significantly better company. $CLOV to $100."
"CLOV is unable to hold on any gains, something is wrong with this company..."
Don’t worry. Be happy.It is also necessary to wait.
"please please please bring it to 8 today, I need more shares."
Is it asking too much for CLOV to have just ONE green day this week???
"My advice to retail: stop chasing the next shiny thing (stock). The biggest money is not made in getting in and out of trades (recipe for disaster); it's made by sitting on your bottom and waiting. Control your impulses; they are usually bad. Buy, sit, wait, wait more, cash out. $CLOV"
"Cowen downgrades to $7 because they got 35,500 put options they are gonna lose a ton of money on,pure manipulation."
What’s w this pre market run up
"Thumbs up if you took advantage of the ""Cowen drop"" today and bought more shares. I did."
"Thing about this company is: we all know it’s undervalued and the price has been artificially pressed down. If you hold shares, you can easily benefit by waiting this manipulation out. I repeat: $CLOV is massively undervalued and oversold. I rest my case."
Is it me or does Joe seem to have a lot of anger and aggression? Wonder how much money he has lost with CLOV. Poor kid.
"Its our turn to run up 120, 140%. Lets roll!"
This stock is only ever green after hours and premarket
"Come on, squeeze to $50-60 as AMC did..."
28m shares traded with good news and no movement...an absolute manipulated stock...
we will have big time up volume if its truly a up volume day we are going to have another 20% gain today
ClOV now short sale restricted.
"CLOV now has 129% borrow interest. Shorts will be covering with such numbers I guess, especially as recent price targets are around these levels."
8.84 tomorrow
"Excellent news, more people are looking for a job!!!!!!!! GO CLOV"
own clov but pre market sdc is trying for the squeeze today.
target price $16
"Going up at end of day, that's different"
"This stock has been trading roughly in the $8 range for the past 6 months with a few dips below and above. Nothing has changed to the fundamentals and the only news coming out has been positive. It's not going to suddenly dive to zero so people need to stop panicking. This is a marathon, not a sprint. If you're looking for quick riches, try a casino."
"Does ""30 cents"" hurt shorts a lot that they won't let it stay there for even just an hour? I can see it staying around 8 or even 7 for weeks without feeling nothing. I know the stock's value. But seeing it jumping up in the morning then sliding slowly underwater every day is really annoying"
Not selling
for those who said it would close over 9:10 today you were wrong again
any chance to see 15 eoy?
Based on my carefully conducted research I have concluded that CLOV might potentially increase in value.
Buying more tomorrow
Can a single bear give me an explanation for why this is a bad company? Would love to hear the other side.
"It's moving up nicely. But I'm not going to get excited, because we all know what happens next."
Just sold out upwork that I held for a year and bought more Clov… 9720 shares strong 
I noticed there's no more talk about a short squeeze so that must have come and gone luckily it's a good stock long term
"Broke thru both the 50 and 200 day moving average today. Last time CLOV did that was early June and then it tripled in price over the next 3 days. If CLOV follows the AMC pattern on its second run from 6 to 60, then CLOV should reach 80+ near term."
"The Memer's gang tackle approach to ""stick it to the man"" via social media has backfired. The SPACs where a joke and did more damage than good to retailers as there are now more scams within scams then before. With that said, manipulation has always been around and will forever evolve. GME, not a SPAC, is and was an impressive one-of-a-kind and has yet to be duplicated in scale. The pros are now well ahead of the WSBs tactics and understand the psychology behind it."
These shorts trying to scare people out of their positions is fun to watch. Could it go down another dollar? Absolutely. Do I care about a $1 when I see WAY more upside for years to come? Not in the slightest. Look at the levels we were holding the last few months and that was before we doubled analysts expectations. If they wanna short this down to new lows let em. I'll still be holding and wondering how nervous they are when the next earnings rolls around or when Clover announces another strategic partnership. My two cents.
Looks like we are frozen in this range till we move up to $12...CLOV for the Big SCORE!!!
"Well, nobody is selling.. tic toc HF…"
Nothing but bullish news on CLOV. Fundamentals with this company are amazing. We will see a correction in value over time. Buy and HOLD.
"Accumulate and keep ,sure to win big in the futureGood luck need patience"
unbelievable
I bought some clov for long long term 2025/2030. Someone think we Will see 30/35$ then?
"Huge buy now, rocket time tomorrow"
"Don't lose heart, DOW is in a correction. Lost 1000 points since 35000.I don't expect a spike to $ 40-50 a share till next year.In the meantime 4 new insurers that went public early this year grew rapidly1.Bright Health(BHG $ 12 a share) grew 275% to $1.1 B in revenues. Their CEO is a former UNH chair and CEO.2.Clover(CLOV $8.30) grew 140%3.Oscar Health(OSCR $12) grew at 37%.Their revenues were $ 830M4.Alignment Health($ 17-18) rose in revenues at 35%.Revenues at $300M. This is the favorite stock of Kevin Fischbeck, analyst for Bank of America, who is also an analyst for CLOV.Clover is not expected to turn profit till mid August 2022. They will use losses to bring CLOV lower till then."
"relax, know what you hold."
"we are getting ready ladies.....we need about 15,000 shares today. Fresh reload."
"I'm looking at the chart and the chart is telling me: oversold, oversold, oversold! Said it time and again, good companies don't stay oversold forever. Eventually value folks come in and scoop up shares at wonderful prices. Same will happen here. Matter of time. $CLOV"
today's volume 1/5th average volume!!! looks like everybody is waiting for Sept 9th.
Tomorrow…
Good morning everyone in America. The battle with hedge funds begins.
"Wow! They sold lots of $9, 10, 11 options at the beginning of the week and they plan to make them all expire today."
My lucky clov!!
I have $ 2 million ready to add more today.
I’m not selling but it will probably get manipulated back down just like always. I’ll hold to $100
20% hike....
bought a few thousand the other day at 8.38 and again yest at 8.16. Glad I sold it at 8.54 this morning. Will buy it back again at 8.0 and maybe lower.
May we see $9 today ???
CLOV will either continue growing exponentially it be bought by one of the big players.
Price should be over $20 to $30 without manipulation.
Go $CLOV
Health care is the only sector closing green today.
Wow FUD is at 100%… we are ready gang!! LFG
"Was waiting for $8.00 this week to buy more, I guess it won't happen."
"If you get down a little today due to the manipulation, please watch this video. Two major Dark Pool buys. Positive Bloomberg Terminal news days ago but apparently not out in the mainstream yet.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y2oPTBQLnw"
If it doesn’t bounce off this level it will be the first time in 8 months.
looks like we gonna end green
"Look at Oscar health down for the year was 36 now 17 also bright health group (BHG) was 17 now 9 and Clover also down for the year..... Now is the time to have Clover buy one or two health care companies at half price. Bright Health has 4 Billion in revenue and thousands of members in the same areas as Clover. Size is key to profit in this industry, as the healthy pay for the sick. This is a gift to grow the business very fast at a cheap price that we may not see again. We need something to spark this stock......"
"I'm going to be adding to my position with each passing month. I'm at 400 now. To me, it looks like an 80 dollar stock in a year or 2 times"
CLOV takes top billing at WSB. Over 750 comments in 24 hrs. GO CLOV
You guys are always fine in the premarket.
Clov gonna spike
Added 5000 shares at 9.3
Short borrow fee 107% ? You feel that? Its money
"Keep adding to position, Reddit army is being patient."
Thanks for reaching out and appreciate your support. We remain laser focused on executing against our mission to improve healthcare and believe progress will be rewarded by the markets at some pointRespond from clov investor department
i'm the big bag holder of clov @ 14. Can i make atleast break even by this year end?
"If someone has the faith to put over $8 million into this stock, then I'm beginning to feel more confident in my measly $10k."
Every day the same..
My portfolio is officially 100% CLOV. Lord please let me be right 
CLOV going to $50 tomorrow
Open over 9.00 tomorrow and over 10 by Tuesday
Just trade it until this volatility goes away. It moves up and down like clockwork.
Tomorrow it’s honing to cross $10. Sources
"Great news and going in the wrong direction. This market is disgusting!!! Stocks like AMC and GME and so many others move 15-20% on no news and bad fundamentals. CLOV had a fantastic earnings report, is repeatedly bringing out positive news, and the sp moves in the other direction"
All of the bears are delusional and don’t know what value investing is. Shorts will be burned with time HODL. 1400 shares strong.
"Someone has brought $10 million worth in the dark pool, anyone wanting to buy will be your day today we might see 7 great time to buy I know I will be. Clov for the long. 1000 shares owned myself at 7.42"
"From reading posts it would appear I am in the minority. However much I could benefit from a short squeeze I am just as happy not to. The time it takes for this working man to add to my position, is not days. Or even weeks, its months. And for all those who truly do have thousands of shares, there are far more like me. Who aspire to hundreds. I really think those who are on here saying they have tens of thousands they are suffering from constipation, full of it. Good luck and beware the FUD."
This is turning red by end of day.
Good VIDEO DD on CLOV here thought i'd share..i am adding more here https://lussosnews.com/video-trader-thinks-clov-future-looks-bright/

Cowen Co put options at $7 strike price didnt pan out. Do we have more contestants..do I hear $6..$5...$4 ? Going once..
reminder: 140% yoy rev growth... 1.5 billion in revs
"People are trying to offset paper losses in $CLOV by getting into some hot flyers & are getting burned. Doesn’t take a genius to know not to revenge trade. Just sit, be patient, drink your coffee, read a book or a 10-K, & cash out when the stock doubles, triples, etc. Be simple."
Can we get past 9 again
"This Friday is 3-ple witching. Cowen Co, with its $ 7 target on their 35.5K puts are slated to lose some pretty penny , if CLOV won't go down. Citadel as a market maker isn't playing ball so far, because, if they do, next week another smarty pants can appear with a strike price of..$6 and another with $5..$4 and before you know it the market maker can be investigated for price collusion and fixing. Cowen is here to buy some shares for $8 or $9 a pop and help us out a little.lol"
Have 56 shares on Clov and lost about 50$ 10% lost what should I do ?
huge buy just came across!!
"Not selling selling at 11, 15, 20 or 28. Diffently not selling at 9, 8, 7, or 6 below. Hahahaha"
"Bloomberg saying conference call September 20. No one saying anything, news not out yet"
Just got 12 more shares praying it will boom let’s go
There’s a 95% chance that the $3.5 trillion Infrastructure bill gets passed on September 27th. 80% chance that Medicare eligibility gets expanded to 60 years of age and above. Massive catalysts for the stock market & for $CLOV. This will bury the shorts. Mark my words. Patience.
So many PUTS going down the drain Friday...OH WELL
More institutions buying https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetfools/comments/pnpaem/arizona_state_retirement_system_acquires_new/
I bought this stock at a price of 28 and now the average price is 11 together. Every drop I buy I have no hope of this stock together. Every drop I buy until I win. I will not sell with a loss. If one cent I will not lose.
I am still not selling.
"from last few days early morning it always goes up by + 3 to 4 % but later it close in Negative, is this something a manipulation?"
Tomorrow $9?

DO NOT SELL BEFORE $35. PERIOD
gme is broke it's amazing their stock is even where it is it's smoke and mirrors
"“Buy when people are fearful and sell when people are greedy.” Right now the bears are coming out and others are paper handing… seems like the perfect time to buy. Huge reversal tomorrow and into Friday. 108% fee to borrow on fintel and I can only imagine the short squeeze score now. It took a lot of selling and money to bring this beast down. I’m in 1,400 shares at 7.58. HODL."
On the move
Well selling apple tomorrow to buy this
Are you guys okay? please help me. I'm at $ 11.

1 more quarter and Clover skill passs total Revenue of all of 2020 .Growing Company!
Buy and hold!!!
"I think yesterday's flatlining at 9.45 was probably due to the warrants expiring today (extended deadline), where holders either can exercise and get a common share for $11.50 (more cash for the company) or do a cashless exercise for 0.249 shares per warrant held (minimize dilution for the company). Either way, I think the runway is being cleared for take off in the near future..."
"Once again, a firm who has a bearish position on $CLOV, with 35,500 put options, initiated coverage on $CLOV that’s, you guessed it…bearish. You can’t make this up. Lol"
"Please be practical about target prices, the short interest is no longer a criteria as it appears, hedge funds played Blackpool to counter reddit crowd and cover short interest, the stock price need to be moved by good performance and good news in my honest opinion. Please advise If I am wrong. I wish I am wrong. I hold good amount of stock and looking for practical ideas."
"10s in sight, will BE very quick!strong buy !!!"
CLOV is low now but has been much higher over last few months. Consequently many shareholders who bought much higher are now diamond hands and will not think about selling until at least stock gets back up to 30. You sell now I think you will regret making that decision this early in the big move to come.
Cramer just said! BUY BUY BUY!!
"I was working on some shareholder numbers of CLOV and found a discrepancy. According to Fintel there is 138,771,787 institutional shares held as far as the current filings as well as 71,046,419 shares held by insiders. There is already a problem with their percentages and the amount of shares they list but I will use the percentages as they are much smaller values than the listed share amounts. I am betting there is a little gray area there as far as class a and b but still not enough to make it make sense. At any rate here is the math. Institutional shares + Insider Shares + Retail Shares = Float Fintel lists Institutional shares make up 33.99% of the Float 33.99% of Float = 86,027,618 Shares They give Insider shares as 36.18% of the float which is = 91,570,439 Shares Yahoo lists Retail as owning 38% of the float for CLOV which is= 96,176,802 shares and obviously retail is the largest shareholder of CLOV. Good job everyone that is actually awesome.Crazy part is most of us are holding and market makers have a good amount of shares for hedging purposes but that makes the math even more weird since the float is only 253,096,849 shares.So 86,027,618+91,570,439+96,176,802=273,774,859 shares total. 273,774,859- 253,096,849=20,678,010 shares that do not exist.This is probably the lowest end of what I would assume to be close except no one actually knows how many shares retail holds and I have read different numbers on this over the last couple weeks some saying retail owns as much as 70% of the float depending on what brokerage you check with. I took the lowest value that is out within the last couple weeks and used that but if you assume retail actually owns 70% of the float then the number of non existent shares is quite a bit larger.For instance 70% of the Float = 177,167,794 Shares that would be owned by retail. Add that to the 91,570,439 owned by insiders and the 86,027,618 owned by institutions and you end up with =354,765,851 Shares -253,096,849 =101,669,002 shares that are unaccounted for or otherwise synthetic.Let them play their games but the math on the float has never added up to me even with some late reporting wiggle room and the whole mess between class a and b shares and the warrants. None of it makes any sense. If you use the share values Fintel lists instead of the percentages the number ends up much higher. If anyone has any additions or sees any flaws in my math or accounting let me know I am merely working from todays published fintel numbers and a couple other sources found online or through brokerages with a little help from the reddit crew."
"Unlike other meme stocks, CLOV has the fundamentals to justify a higher share price and market capitalisation. $20? Higher! $40? Higher $100? Don’t see why not!"

"I’m just going to keep slowly adding until next earnings call. That’s when we’ll squeeze some those shorts, squeeze them hard."
CLOV executives and investors have a meeting with Aliah Capital Monday to pitch to hedge funds for long term investment. That's most likely why the Large purchases this morning. Whales taking a shot at an early catch. While I'm a large holder of Clov stock I'm still kinda neutral with fundamental inclination of a solid breakout. Just so my position is known.
"Such a large amount of borrowed shares must be repaid at some point. And before that, they have to buy them! We will sell expensive, very expensive."
"took amc almost 5 months after the first squeeze to see the real squeeze. If its gonna squeeze, it will do it in the next two months."

Glad I’m not the bag holder for once $CLOV
"95% of investors thought AMC going from $10 to $72 was impossible. Yet it happened. Took 3 weeks. It is *absolutely* possible with $CLOV as well. When I sign off with “$CLOV to $100,” I truly mean it. Cherry on top? $CLOV is a significantly better company. $CLOV to $100."
"$7 puts will be itm soon. This Co. Will keep on diluting your shares. Free float has doubled since last squeeze....... buy something else that’s not so manipulated buy hedges and themselves, Clover Health."

"This stock will run like AMC ran a few months ago. I guarantee it. This is exactly how blindsided the bears at AMC were. They had no idea; neither do the $CLOV bears. I can’t wait to watch this unfold. Patience, everyone; get some popcorn ready."
Not going to lie... Didn't see this dropping back into the 7s..but it looks like it!
"RIP @Danny, it was nice laughing at your FUD.Good luck tomorrow gang!"
This is way undervalue but without any news it will stays like that.
Hopefully Clover can get momentum tomorrow with the short restriction of the stock finishing more than 10% down today. I think it could only get shorted during an uptick tomorrow.
"CLOV: A unique investment opportunity that could potentially “squeeze” in the short term (due to its relatively low market capitalisation, high short interest and diamond-handed shareholders) but is equally a great long term hold for both retail (Reddit/Twitter apes) and institutional investors. As I mentioned in a previous comment, unlike other meme stocks, CLOV’s fundamentals are rock solid (see last earnings report) and so it’s eventual short squeeze won’t be a quick pump and dump. Tip: We’re currently in the final accumulation phase (could last until next earnings call). Each week until November I’m going to keep adding more and more shares. You don’t get opportunities like this everyday, a truly undervalued company!"
"Red again, gamble in fdvrf is better."
Adding more shares at 9 thanks for the low price
It’s opposite week. This week starts red and ends green. Ready for a rebound!!!
"Clov is more talked about on WSB than GME,AMC,BB and every other meme stock. Think that might mean something"
