anybody else realize that this chart looks like the amc chart before it popped to 60$
CLOV got 2 patents. Another thing to add onto the list of positives. The big catalyst will be a PT upgrade. Just wait.
CLOV
Danny is either a bot or someone paid buy hedge funds. I can't come up with any other reason for his behaviour.
$CLOV is the only “meme stock” with indisputable growth potential. 140% year over year revenue growth. Nothing to sneeze at. Change my mind.
Huge sell wall at $9. They can’t afford to let $9 be breached.
50 tomorrow?
Good old fashion jail time would help this squeeze.
#AMC - Short Losses $AMC is up 23% generating losses for short sellers of over $800m today alone
"We need 8.50 for max pain..by friday..We need a push , to get it rolling"
Not selling
Hey Danny boy! Does youse want to go for a ride with a bunch of $CLOV-tards?
Well I’ve got $25k in options calls down for this Friday @9$ entry price .75. each. For my sake please keep buying and holding haha. Thank you
"Clover is a great company, own 5000 shares @8.10 going to $15 by year end.........This is a real company and true Asset in ,my opinion...."
"Folks this baby is heading back to $28, holding my 2,600 CLOV shares"
This is the the big push down for the set up for tomorrow’s closing price . Shorts have to persuade people to sell today. Hodl !
"2021-08-20 - Morgan Stanley has filed a 13F-HR/A form disclosing ownership of 821,885 shares of Clover Health Investments Corp Class A (US:CLOV) with total holdings valued at $10,947,000 USD as of 2021-06-30. Morgan Stanley had filed a previous 13F-HR on 2021-05-17 disclosing 116,353 shares of Clover Health Investments Corp Class A at a value of $879,000 USD."
What would be the next catalyst for this company?
Who’s ready for $25?
"Good morning everyone, $$$$$ CLOV "
We went up 35 cents in 3 minutes. Now that's a beautiful sight!

"If you can’t handle your investment being manipulated, don’t invest in CLOV"
when will clov reach its potential
They had some interesting insights about CLOV on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Should see an analyst upgrade or two in the next several weeks…GLTA Longs…
Power hour
Is that wall at $8.65 Fake or real? Need some bulls.
We broken the wall  
It says a lot about the company when it’s stock is crashing in a bull market
140% Revenue GREW 2nd Qrt 2021. CASH increased to $630 Million. I will buy and wait few years...Correct me if I am wrong
"This thing was down as much as 4% today, now price is at break even and it can’t move. Funny how that works. Obvious manipulation is obvious. HODL!"
read clovers benefits. who wouldn’t want the clover plan.providers are reimbursed within 7 days. when medicare opens up this fall clover will do well imo.Their benefits and system is very well laid out and explained on their sites .
Completely unsurprising
I highly recommend this video if you want to know why CLOV is so heavily shorted.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=garunMWoBGE
I love that Danny is Desperate for us to sell..it tell me to Buy buy buy!!
Should be trading at a 10billion market cap which would be $27 per share! Really worth $50+
let's go CLOV to $30 ASAP
It’s going to go up tomorrow
Let’s goooooooooooo!
WELL DONE option holders.. ya finally won one. Not max pain for first time in awhile. This could be the start of something new.

I muted @Danny and a few other degenerates. This mute button feature on yahoo is my favorite. CLOV has one of the best technical setups ATM in the whole market
"Like most on the board, I have been buying down, maybe less than some, but we are all in the same boat. Shares have been going down and those looking for the quick buck have jumped ship, and that's ok, but for the rest of us, keep in mind that sales next quarter will reflect open enrollment, (starts Oct) I expect sales to explode up and membership should triple. Any new company building, in our case members will have much higher costs to get the customer. In time those costs will come down and revenue ill still increase. The pandemic may increase medical costs, that will also come down when that levels off. It seems to me the bigger health care companies IE United and Aetna will have advantages by having lower pay out % to total paying membership. That leads me to believe that if membership grows, Clover would at the very least be a viable take over candidate as the size does matter in this case. They could also be a buyer of another smaller company like Bright health or another.... My point here is it is not just become profitable or fail. It is the ultimate goal to become profitable but could take years of growth to reach. See Face book and Amazon, Tesla and others who just now are at that point. So keep faith, be strong our time will come, and if not there are other companies that would love to get our members. That's the way I see it...."

love this stock bought a ton
I think the squeeze will be in september yet only - shorts panic only after -100% on position.
Is it right time to sell or this go more ??I am new investor
90% of warrants are already exercised and the rest will be at a 75% discount so no big deal. I'm sure some complained they missed out and therefore the company extended to be nice.
"One of the most undervalued stocks in the entire equities market. Will bounce up. Just a matter of time, in my opinion. Can't stay oversold forever. $CLOV"
This stock should reach $30 easy.....and soon....confident in this one.Holding 58k shares. I see this headed to $100 or more within a year (my opinion only and not financial advice).
Selling season for Medicare Advantage plans starts 10\15!
"I am not holding 9000 for quick buck or slow buck though either may happen. I am in to support company and its philosophy. CLOV is the only healthcare insurance company that sees itself as serving patients and doctors and believes in empowering patients and doctors to improve outcomes. All others are in business with sole purpose of extracting maximum healthcare dollars out for themselves to enrich company and its executives by exploiting premium players and doctors. Think T-mobile the uncarrier. It has humbles Verizon and AT&T. It is building business base, not chasing quick profits. Think birth and growth of Amazon."
Today is the last day and they are running for the hills!!! At the end of the day we just want a fair playing field.
"at this pace, Joe's taking everyone to Red Lobster tonight - hehe"
"Gamma squeeze incoming , options closing in"
Danny desperate = Squeeze Imminent!See you at $20 LONGS
There is no reason to believe shorts are losing money.
"Added 1500 shares today at 8.71. Amount of CLOV shares sold in the last 60 days, ZERO!!! HODL!!!"
"Short report & DOJ inquiry discredited. Revenues grew 140% YoY. Mgmt pitching to institutions. Not a single share sold by mgmt, Chamath, Ian. JPM buying calls & shares (reverting to long). Still massive SI position (35% of FF). $CLOV to $100."
just bought 1000 more...lets go!

"There is a long way to go… neutral for now, bullish for the next 2-3 years"
See what WallStreetFools are saying about CLOV https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetfools/
Retail owns approximately 200m shares. Bashing article reads ownership by retail is 38% of this 3.6b market cap company! Buy and hold !
WE NEVER SEEM TO HAVE A GREEN WEEK AND NOT EVEN A GREEN DAY FOR NO REASON? IM GOIN TO KEEP A SMALL AMOUNT OF SHARES AND MOVE ON
"tick, tick, tick...BOOM"
"Just add another 250 share, hope every keep buying so we can get above 11 this week so squeeze begin,once it hit 50 then it will go to 400 or higher"
Who saved enough peanuts to add to the day? We got 75 minutes left to do this!!
"CLOV ready for breakout, it is in horizontal movement for a time which has no way except up"
This is a health care company that’s also a tech company with the Clover Assistant helping both patients and physicians resolve complex health issues. It’s fundamentally undervalued. SI is unwarranted and based on a false premise. Matter of time before upside reversal. $CLOV
"Ok folks. Let’s get real. Revenue is $1.6B. Let’s say Clover stops growing and spending forever, at 5% profit margin it’s $80M. That implies a P/E of 40x at today’s price. Not too shabby. But do you seriously think they won’t grow?"
As we get closer to Wells Fargo Virtual Healthcare Conference on September 9 Danny gets increasingly more desperate.
"Check out that late-day bounce, Danny Boy!"
Come to $clov heavily shorted 140% yoy growth and just got two patents
WTH is up with this stock. Earnings/forecast were good but it does nothing
Aaaand they borrowed 3 Million synthetic shares today to short Clov once again!!Dig deeper into the rabbit hole Kenny.
They got 1 billion shares to cover
This will go up today
"Thanks for the red day, just add another 800 shares"
Question - why do ya think they are keeping down? Who has bought in big since April - Exactly those that were not able to get during pre IPO!! There was no IPO so therefore all the tires are being able to buy in!!

(SPRT) is CLOV next????????????????
"Three things in life are for certain, death, taxes, and $CLOV getting naked shorted during the last hour of the day. HODL."
Just buy and forget about it. In a year we will be up 100%+

Bears are starting to sweat!!!! The trap is set and you can feel Clov about to breakout!!!! Buy while you can!!!!
"BHG..vs..CLOV, What's the difference, which is better?? Any detail explanation appreciated Thanks!!!"
"Shorts, if you can't get this thing below $8.04 on the day the Dow was down 500, time to cover. Because when 33.42 million short shares all cover at once, there will be a major squeeze."
"Oh look, they’re buying back those fake shares."
Dannys Boyfriend told me to buy more
Anyone hear from Danny lately? Staring to worry about him... 
I thinks we need to break $10 to get to $25. Let’s add up and be smart APES.
I
Green  on a Friday! Awesome 
Big volume coming GO $Clov

Mark Cuban“It’s the foundation of how I invest in stocks these days. The companies that have harnessed AI the best are the companies dominating.”
The options action “puts” @ $8 . Second most $8.50
"Tomorrow is September the first, look for a big rally in most stocks tomorrow or Thursday. Or maybe both! GO CLOV"
"I bought in at $21 lol, just 100 shares, still holding, will add 900 shares at $7 and under. Don't really have much choice here."
10 today?
bought more
Iborrowdesk fees going up. More shorts incoming
let's forget Danny we have bigger fish to fry he's just a minnow
$8.50 today
Let’s hope this follows the pattern of SPRT… Hung out around 8 for a while before exploding to 55 in a month’s time before pulling back
"Low volume, nobody wants to sale, it’s good  sign"
I've seen physicians (posted on Reddit) also heavily invest in CLOV.... subject matter experts jumping in also bolsters my confidence in CLOV.
"Really, really, really good DD. Check it out. $CLOV https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p5hz6d/my_lucky_clov_a_case_study_in_the_meme_markets/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
They’ll try to keep this below $9 by close Friday. Keep accumulating and help it break out
$CLOV is about to explode 
how much more boring can a stock with 43k reddit followers get? The pinning of this stock is outrageous. The amount of effort and money to keep it here must be huge.

We need some major news to break the status quo and break the shorts
"I just read an article which says that starting on Tuesday, hedge funds and institutions can no longer use FTD's and naked short selling to drive down the stock. Because that is when NSCC-2021-010 goes into effect. Is that true? I sure hope so. We will find out on Tuesday."
We will be chasing AMC with $30 soon
"I have to say it’s a great day, however I will not sell a single stock before $50"
When the fear of missing out kicks in. Then some new level of fun begins!
Hey Danny! Come dance with us...

People’s playing On options should go to casino play at the tables game.99% is losing money 
Hey! Danny!
"this stock will be manipulated until the hedge funds either stop making money or stop making enough money (i.e. can make better profits off another stock).that will happen eventually, and the stock will slowly rise to around $30, which is a fair value. until then, there won't be a ""squeeze"" or anything else. if you're holding, just hold and wait. if you're expecting a squeeze, move on and lose money somewhere else. retail investors don't win by trying to squeeze stocks, period."
If clov went up 50% I will still be red
8.50 today
Let’s not think of this as a meme stock with the possibility of going up 2000% in a few months… This is a solid company that will probably go up 500% in five years
"Oh ohhh.. DANNY will disappear in 3,2,1… green soon."
ILL BET WE HAVE A NICE GREEN WEEK NEXT WEEK
Tesla Clover of Amazon Health
If....I had to choose sides....I would choose up!
Climb and maintain 25
"Guys, i hold 8000 . Still cheep to buy extra? Any tips and tricks. The whale story sound nice but… what do you think will happen? I feel something good is on its way but thats my common sence."
Danny thinks this is a meme stock but it's not. This is a great company with huge potential.
Looks like the CLOV is ready for LAUNCH...Destination $28 again!!! Load it up.
"Morning awesome people and DANNY. hey Danny, can you step up your game? I have an order at $8.00 waiting to be filled for a while."
"Clover Health is inevitably going to be a successful company. People just don’t understand the potential and vision here. Once the market realizes that to the full extent, this will just explode to the upside. Simple as that. $CLOV"
Going to 15 friday
Buy when the presence of the bears is the strongest. Get ready for it!!!!
"Adding more, shorties thanks for the discount?"
Hold above 8.50 and we get a small win!!
Fathom these numbers. My company has 600k plus employees. My company pays premiums for healthcare insurance of over 1k a month . Spouse plus one . My portion is $100 a month for the lowest consumer price. 600k x $1100 a month =$660mThat’s only one company’s premium. There is a estimated 50 million full time working Americans Multiply by 49 million.
So I hear we have two patents approved by the US government. That’s kind of a big deal for an AI tech company in the health care industry. Nothing to sneeze at. $CLOV
This has spent half the day at 8.60... lol
"Launch time coming soon , buy now"
"CEO Vivek Garipalli and President & CTO Andrew Toy will present at the 2021 Wells Fargo Virtual Healthcare Conference on Thursday, September 9, 2021, at 3:20 p.m. Eastern Time. SHORTS WILL BE COVERING BEFORE THEN."
"CLOV has 400 million shares outstanding, 150 million class A and 250 million class B. Each class A share has one vote, and class B has 10 votes. Only class A shares are traded class B are not. Any clue as to who holds class B shares and why they are not traded? Appreciation in advance."
"2 new patents, warrants bought back to decrease dilution, 140% proj year over year revenue growth, amazing investor conference, and a large retail backing (43,000 Reddit members) with a avg share price in the teens. Could u ask for more. Did I mention they have another conference coming up and a potential PT upgrade? How is this going down."
They tried to make people’s tiered But we don’t We don’t pay any interest Keep holding strong 
Why does this have such a hard time breaking 9?
Anyone know what caused this to go up today? No news about Clov.
"Super strange, something going to happen soon"
Need a big surge again from reddit lol
"Andrew Toy CTO of CLOV.""I am frequently asked why Clover Health started a health plan as opposed to a software startup that made Clover Assistant and sold it to health plans. My answer: this would be like trying to sell electric car batteries to the car industry in 2010. If Tesla had tried that, they’d have been told that there’s no market for electric cars and it’s just easier to make money by improving miles-per-gallon or building hybrids."""
Who would buy a company with 110% revenue growth?
CLOV to $100
"Most new investors enter the market thinking they can make quick money. They invest when the stock is going up, but panic when the price begins to fall. Fearing the stock will go down further, they sell – only to later see the price rise and hit new highs."
I bought in $16 per share  now my average $13.46
$9…here we are for the 3rd time today. Will this time be a charm?
Do you think CLOV will go over $20 again?
I add 2500 more shares today
CLOV has only been trading for a year now. Some people are very impatient if you want to follow Danny's advice and sell more for me. Being impatient is the worst thing you can do.
"I see Clover headed to 110 by end of year. according to my guidance this will be a 900.00 stock within 5 years, but the first line of resistance will be in December at or around 100.00 per share. ( My opinion only and not qualified financial advise.)"
1.4 million shorted attack just gotten bought without a price drop
I’m taking everyone to red lobster when CLOV hits $50
"LoL shorts desperately trying too hard,"

"Rocket time , please buy$ now"
SANEL....waiting for the group purchase schedule. I would like to double my position also and heard you are General of this army! Let's March Together.
Just pick up another 250 shares thanks for shorting
management needs to post positive news
Small increase on low volume yet again. I smell blood in the water.
What I don’t understand is who tf is selling this!??
THESE ARE THE SAME COMMENTS THAT ARE ON CLOVW!!!!!
any survivors left after yesterday?
"Thanks for the dip, pick up another 500 shares"
CLOV is the way!
Clov mooning tomorrow LFG
U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday voted to pass a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that would expand spending on social programs and advance a $1 trillion infrastructure bill already passed by the Senate.
CLOV commons are certainly going to continue to move up as the warrants are gone. Question though if anyone knows? If a warrant was shorted at expiration how could it be covered? The redeemable value is .10c. I'm not a short or shorting but that seemed to be a rather lucrative bet. Anyone know anything about that?
Buy at atleast 25 shares today....
Danny is overdrive!! Go Danny go
Anyone selling ? No No No We hold and buy only
Like to get to 9 or more today!! Go CLOV
"I think this breaks $10 today. The big question is can it hold above it. I think the Meme traders and the FOMO traders were the catalyst for pushing it up to $28+ when it hit it’s high 10 weeks or so ago and I don’t think it revisits those levels on at least the current run or say the next month, if it takes multiple runs to get there. But I have a price target of $22.50 for the next 4-6 weeks."
"It seems to me with such a small float and so many retailers and institutional investors holding that stock is wound tighter than Willie Nelson’s headband. I am only one retailer and I am holding 58,500 shares. Not selling until this is definitely worth my while. Hang tight and get ready…"
Looking surprisingly strong. We are due for a good Green Day.
Patience is golden
So what's the deal? We have better than expected numbers. A revenue that grew 140% was it? And we're down 10% after the earnings release? How does this make any sense?
"Green and Moving up, Up, UP!!!!CLOV for the BIG WIN!!!"
Let’s go!! I’d love to see a close at $10… might be overly optimistic but someone has to be!!
One off or are MEME stocks back in play?
Bought another 200
Hold guys! 99.3 Util! 20% SI!
I went all in BBIG guys I will bring all the gains here next week
I don't care if they are selling back and forth to each other. 11 million shares cost someone some money. LMAO GO CLOV
Chart is looking beautiful!!! Get in for under $9 while you can. It is cooling up for the next pop!!!
all this FUD and name calling . . . . however where is your sustance to your argument ? ? THE COMPANY SUCEEDS ! ~ the best days are in front of us . . . NEW HIGHS BY FEBRUARY ! ! ~
"It would be awesome if we could get some price target increases and if the stock could be upgraded to ""Buy"" this week. A couple of positive news articles would help also."
"After warrants expired, CLOV starts to fly, maybe see $14 in 2 weeks"

"check this out, CLOV is one of the most active stocks, is it time for it to run?https://lussosnews.com/these-were-the-most-discussed-stocks-on-wall-street-bets-monday/"
Stay above 8.5 at close we blast stay above 9 we mooning
We’ve just gotta stay above 8.50. If we stay green through the first half of the day we will have some good price action later. CLOV is always shorted heavy at the start.
"2,399 shares for me at $7.64! Not selling till $30. Didn’t even think about taking profits yesterday when CLOV hit $9.11. A lot of Penny flippers and shorts."
43k members on r/CLOV Growing and holding!
"So many longs here, I have no idea why you would short this with institutions jumping in."
9.5 this week
Ladder attack again
All aboard - this train is leaving the station soon
We will probably have a pull back tomorrow. Three big Green Day’s in a row is unheard of with CLOV.. I just wish people would realize the value of the company and not think of it as a meme stock to swing trade.
"Grabbed 2,399 shares today for $7.65! Also picked up $10 call LEAPs for 2023. I’m ready for the moon "
When clov hits 120 I’ll give first comment 25k via Venmo I’ll hit my 2 mill target
Danny you should take a break and comeback after September 9 because even if people are thinking about selling noone will do it before that date.
Buying 300 more!
