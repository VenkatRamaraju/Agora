"Converted shares doesn't mean sold shares. They didn't sell the first time. Tune into tomorrow for shapes and colors, brought to you by @Danny"
Keep a close eye on $CLOV. I made a quarter mil off of this stock last June and it looks like it may be ready to make a move again.
"CLOV is about to explode to $13So far, 3 days now, Shorts is trying to push down and failed. No one wants to sell. Oct 15 is the day will crush all shorts. Next week, some shorts will get heart attack or stroke. Just warning shorts. Cover as soon as possible."
To the Moon
"Shorts, just throw in the towel. The bottom is in. Put your ego aside and join us fellow longs. You’re literally shorting for pennies and the volume is consistently low."
wow its trending
"Oh look, they’re buying back all of those fake shares they sold this morning."
"holy molly, these are some serious rips."
You have to wonder how long they can continue this manipulation.
Going higher. Danny’s weekend not looking great
9.12 soon
"Will be 7.50 on Friday. Market Makers need that for maximum pain, that is for them to make the most money."
This thing can spring to 8.5+ very quickly. Fasten your seat belt. 
super stagnant closing price for the past few days. Suspiciously stagnant
anything under 10 is a buy
Well Danny Green Oaks DEFINITELY did not sell. So either post a link or stop spamming.
"On June 8 price spiked to $22 on volume of 750 million shares. No doubt MMs who are charged with maintaining liquidity ended up with a lots of naked shorts in their accounts on June 8. Now after 4 months of down drifting + 25 million B shares on 9-8-202, MMs may have unloaded their shorts. So next up move may be more explosive than the previous one and may occur before mid Nov. Keep your seat belts tightened."
Shorts wants CLOV to close below 8$ for option expiring today Let’s all jump and buy more and start a new big squeeze
Pressure cooker ?
Added 2000 shares below 8.
Thanks for the cheap 2000 shares this morning under 8!
Back to 8s then 9s soon and then all the shorts will magically disappear again... 
Patience is a virtue..
Volume spike.

Investor Place just published a bull article on CLOV!
"All of that shorting earlier, and still above $8. Might even close green on the day."
Pressure cooker
"According to Fintel, CLOV has now skyrocketed to 3.5 Days To Cover. That is very good news! It's a signal that a short squeeze could be imminent."
"""BLUE SKYS"""
jon najarian just disclosed he's long on clov!!
8.5+ is imminent  train is about to leave the station. 
Going to be 30 before you know it. As I’ve been saying over the past 3 months. You cannot hold down a good company forever. Don’t think we will get pinned to max pain this week.
"Danny - market aside, I am really interested in understanding why you are doing what you are doing? you cannot possible make money by being here, you hope to influence or scare someone here into selling? I don't understand it. I hope you realize that all of us here, and I mean all of us here on this board, will amount to a rounding error of the shares traded. this rant of yours has no upside to anyone, it is amuzing ... in full disclosure, that's why I am here - to get amuzed. LOLcare to comment?"
It’s true 13g filed by GeenOaks 50m shares converted B to A . Usually looked at as good news .
Should be in $30s and moving up from there
Here comes the squeeze
"CLOV upgraded, volume is spiking. Looks like there going to run with it. Go CLOV"
No one is selling for a loss. Most people got in at 8 and above. Sure there was day traders but looks like they moved on. I hope our Team crushes shorts into oblivion for what they did these past 6 months
"2,000 shares @ $7.52"
Its Trending today
Above 8..I will take it
I wouldn’t be surprised if this goes from 7.90s to 8.5+ within minutes. Holding large position and continuing to buy more shares today.
"When the market was down 2% a week ago, CLOV dropped 5.6%.As the market ascends back up, CLOV climbs a measly 1% - half of the 2% rise in indexes.Drop fast, rises not hardly at all.What a great stock!"
"I am proud of my investment in Clov. I truly feel that this company will eventually be in the top 500 in the US and feel that absent of a complete Canadian style health care plan, that this option is even more viable..Proud to collect as many shares I can and am certain that the future will shine bright at Clov..Not a pump , only an opinion.."
Easily bounce back to 10 soon
robots seem to take priority over real people
Thumbs up to thank Danny for keeping us entertained on this broad while we March toward $30  Thanks Danny!
Danny is going to be giving rim jobs for change to get the bus. Poor Danny.
2nd time today Danny deleted over 15 comments total 
I wonder how many people got spooked by the dip this morning. I would imagine they’re chasing the price now. Thankfully even at this price you have far more upside than down.
Max pain this week is at $8.00. That is where the MMs will try to pin it. Less than a month from earnings and analyst upgrades in my opinion. Holding and accumulating still. Not financial advice. Do what is best for you.
hey guys! I won't lose to short sellers today! We clov warriors win! Revolutionize America's complex medical insurance system!
Danny Conference Calls
Shorts are returning shares today.
"Now this is interesting. 60,000 $8 calls and 20,000 at 8.50. Very few puts in comparison. Someone is going to make or lose a bunch of money."
This enrollment period will raise CLOV's market value by at least X2-X4. Added to portfolio.
"Very excited for next week starting tomorrow. Looking at a 100k call options for this Friday between 8-10$ is very very bullish. Most people here bought at a higher level and the new ones are already in profit. This will be running and breaking 10$ this week and hopefully we will have enough volume to break all time high. I am holding my shares and my call options and will be adding more as we move forward. This was just my opinion, I wish you all a good luck and crazy gain $$$"
Power hour will be interesting

"Great entry price , after the star rating increase & open enrollment plus earning report in the near future"
ON MONDAY WE RIDE $CLOV
Let’s push to 10$ open on Monday and ride to a new all time high It’s a serious buy buy buy
@william. exactly these people need a reality check they think they're going to make millions of dollars in three or four days that's crazy the market doesn't work like that
How does this stock constantly get squashed...nobody selling at loss under 8 yet millions share on a decline...how can this happen.
Buy more I added 250 more
Love the increasing volume. First sign of a strong move up.
Huge buys coming in!!! Gamma?
no volume
Wait for it
Did anyone catch that whale who bought 4 million shares? Can’t believe the purchase was made on the lit market.
Upgrade next week $20+
"Chamath with the mention on Twitter, which he rarely does. Shorts, you’ve been warned."
Added 12K CLOV
Morning Danny you ready to eat it today.
"Danny - here is the upside. it cut through 8 like butter, and that is the strongest support on the chart. the way I am thinking - better to give up 5k now for buying the calls then to miss this show. Even you have to be smart enough to realize that with any catalyst you will be staring at a 10 dollar stock here shorty."
Clov closing green to show Danny he’se never been wrong 
Looks like we’re are going to test 8 before close
22 million shares traded. Nice
Check Reddit wallstreetbets. Shares for 1 Million bought at 7.97 by single person
Looking forward to breaking and holding 8 on Monday followed by a push through upper resistance levels through the week
Better cover soon shorts. Unlimited losses as this thing climbs
"Danny you know the tide has turned , you have no clue sound familiar ?"
NOW TRENDING!!! NEXT WEEK WILL BE HUGE!!!!
For the record Green Oaks initially owned 96 million Class B shares. 175 million shares as an absurd number.
Clov...distruptive...best stock for the next 3 weeks...
reminder: 140% yoy rev growth... 1.5 billion in revs
GUys - CLOV will hit 9 today
Clover MA ads were on TV in the Atlanta market last night.
We just started .. Welcome to the party.
"I was saved But I don't sell, because clov looks forward to clov growth until a year ahead."
Watching Danny stroke out
Seen this story 20 times over. Have a good weekend folks
3 green days in a row
Something is cooking..unusual on this market day. What's cooking here ?
"Earnings announcement* for CLOV: Nov 10, 2021"
11$ soon
it’s really funny to me because people are freaking out about a little dip like it’s not even that bad. I’m young and I’ll wait 10-20 years if I have to. I have all the time in the world for this. I’m adding more when I get my next paycheck
"Days to cover 2.6 days, short up to 16% of float, up to #2 on Ape Wisdom. Indicators looking good. One guy has 612K shares!"
8 dollar is a perfect buy in for newbies. Stop deleting my comments yahoo

Danny deleting his posts is a good sign! LFG!
"It's one think for someone to say Green Oaks ""disposed"" of shares when actually......they converted class B to A. Youse wrong again. I can only imagine this person is playing with a toy phone that plays music....."
I’ve been here before with clov and it all worked out. I’m not worried.
Still adding. This is like buying gas at $1/gallon.
where is Danny this morning?
why only up .13% in AH? when there is so much activity?
Buy buy buy. Time is on our side. I’m not selling.

Is it an intentional block to keep under 8...who would have ability to do that and how is that done. Are these phantom shares being used to make wall...otherwise who would have the shares to sell.
I think it's going straight back to $9 or $10 next week
It will close green don’t sell em your position in this company.
Run shorts run!
I won’t give up clov soldier in japan!!
Just read on Reddit that shorts are really 2.5 BILLION with a lot of naked shorts. This is why they are not showing on reports. Just a matter of time now when they can no longer manipulate the stock.
"@Alex, @Joe and others who seem to be much better with options than I am (just started dipping my toes in those a few weeks ago). tell me if this makes sense. not on CLOV but my online presence is non-existent, so I thought I'd post here. Yesterday, I bought a ""lot"" of stock at 4.87 that tanked the day prior. My thinking was it would trade between 4.50 and 5 for a few days or weeks before making any ""major"" movements in either direction. I immediately sold calls ($5 strike expiring tomorrow) and collected 0.17 in premium. Today, the share price jumped and was hovering around $5.25 when I was thinking I didn't want the calls to be assigned if the uptrend continued (we'll see what tomorrow looks like!). If they were to be assigned today or tomorrow I would've earned 0.30 per share - premium on the sold calls + the difference between my purchase price and the strike (excluding commissions, etc.). That would be about 6% in 3 days which is not bad... I could've bought the calls back at a loss of about 0.07 (the premium on the $5 strike with tomorrow's expiration was around 0.24) and waited to see what happens next - didn't like that approach. I could've rolled them to next Friday at a smaller loss. Then I looked at the $5.50 strike expiring on Oct 22 (2 weeks out) - the premium was around 0.31. So here it goes - I should roll the ones expiring tomorrow ($5 strike) to the ones expiring on Oct 22 ($5.50 strike) and, at the same time, collect additional 0.07 while increasing the overall earning potential from $5 to $5.50. I didn't pull the plug on it (will look at it again tomorrow). But, does my thinking make sense and would that be a good move in your opinion or am I missing something? Thanks in advance for any thoughts and feedback."
"There are over 40,000 options expiring today. 23,000 of which are between the strike of $7.50 - $8.00Unless tradition breaks and the stock rises to end the day above $8.00, then all the value in these calls are basically forfeit. People really should just buy the stock."
"So many experts here, they all sold at $11 and are now buying back. ..: SURE…"
people who are bashing clov rite now are gonna be the ones buying at 15
Steady climb to double digits

$28 again! Short squeeze like last time possible again. Better business fundamentals and growth forecast. Upgraded today!
We will go green!!!!
"October 15th open medicare enrollment my mistake, but CLOV will head higher 20.00+++"
I believe she will turn 20 soon. Patience is all that is required. I put the money where my words are.
with volume low I assume it's mostly buyers FOMO
"Let me tell you something you already know, the world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows. It can be a mean and nasty place for a Bull and it can make you sell $CLOV permanently if you let it. But it ain’t about how hard you can hit a bear, it’s about how many times you can get hit by a bear and keep moving forward. It’s about how many times you can get shorts thrown at you and keep moving forward. That’s how mooning is done!"
I just saw a Clover Health ad while I was playing Words With Friends. I thought that was pretty cool.
"Up 4 pennies today. Hey man. 4 pennies are 4 pennies, 4 times more than 1 penny. Frankly I will be happy even with a fraction of a penny, as long as it is green."
Who owns the remaining 154 class B shares commanding 1.5 billion votes>
"There is a semi famous investor. Who turned 40k into just over a million. Sir jackalot, funny name I know. There is a screen shot of him going all in on CLOV. Will be illuminating on what effect he alone can have in the markets. That is. Ge is famous for his picks and winning."
GreenOaks Capital Partners LLC is an investment advisory service that has $13 billion under management. They have been invested in CLOV since 2019 when CLOV was still a private company. It is not known how much money they had invested in CLOV at that time. It may have been peanuts. There were 250 million class B shares in IPO in January 2021 and looks like GreenOaks owns a bulk of them if not all of them. Each class B share has 10 votes but no monetary value unless converted in class A 1:1. A few weeks ago GreenOaks had converted 25 million B shares into A shares. On 10-12-2021 news came out that it ad converted additional 50 million B shares into A. It will not be surprising if they just want to get their investment out as even after all these conversions they still could be holding 175 million class B shares and control of company with their 1.75 Billion votes compared to 250 million class A shares which can be bought or sold if someone tries to acquire company.
whole market is down! relax!
I’m excited for Monday! This is going to be a long weekend. Shorts better cover now!
"Bye bye shorts Thanks for pushing the price down, now it’s time to pay"

"I love seeing the low volume. I know that may sound odd, but shows we are trading less a meme stock and they are looking at real value. With a base of hard core holders for one reason or another the remaining shorts will have to borrow and dig themselves in a hole to keep the price down or start to cover. They have no choice as long as we hold and that in itself will drive up the price going into the season of selling. I'm not saying we see $28 again but $10 in the next month is very possible in my opinion."
This stock will move when you guys quick options ( donation) and buy shares only !STB

Love seeing the snakes here in the morning...we are either going up or getting more on sale..CLOV..
been watching this! good day
Just a matter of time with this stock now. Now that the squeeze crowd has left the building this stock will climb steadily on its own merits. The next quarter report should move this up significantly and 2022 will push this higher still. All we need to do is hold and watch. There is no short thesis here that makes any sense.
DANNY claims he’s not been wrong yet. In an earlier post he said CLOV is going to $6.00 on Monday. Let’s see if he’s wrong for once.
Somebody knows something and it's not Danny.
"Fair value/target (IMO) when accounting for triple digit growth over the next 5 years:2021: $15 2022: $302023: $602024: $902025: $135The way it is going so far, I am not optimistic about realizing the 2021 target - though we went to $28 earlier in the year - but I am lot more confident about the long term targets if we keep growing at this pace."

"Those waiting for good news for stock prices to go up are doomed to be disappointed. Good news came on 8-11-2021, earning report saying covered lives and revenues doubled when stock price was $8.13. After that more good news came that CMS had approved doubling territory and direct Medicare contracting. Today it closed at $7.24. Best of the news have done nothing good. Thanks to powerful competitors/enemies bent upon destroying the company. They have recruited hedgies/wall streeters to accomplish their mission."
In at $7.81 Been watching for quite awhile and finally pulled the trigger. I think New Jersey opening up is going to be the catalyst...excited to be aboard!

Expect low volume and more shorting. Hopefully new investors continue to gobble up shares. Rinse and repeat of yesterday. Honestly don't know why they continue to short with clear support at $7.82. This will never bottom to 7 again. Its time for those Puts (YOUR TAKING A LOSS) ●Get Over It●

If the shorts decide they cant drive is any lower they will move on amd we can start moving towards real value. I expect an easy double in 12 months.

"The breakout continues Bitcoin could be in the process of seeing a "" volatile reset . "" By the start of this week's trading session , moving between dips and rises is a typical neutral weekly outlook which makes it a tough decision for Investors to decide how best to utilise the current market ; as for me it can't be more obvious that trading Bitcoin is way more lucrative than just hoding and waiting for the price of Bitcoin to skyrocket . I didn't think it was possible to make constant win from trading till I came across Mrs Charlotte Walter program for Investors / newbies who lack understanding on how trading Bitcoin works , to help them stack up more Bitcoin , since late last year till date | have made over 19BTC from 2.6BTC with Mrs Charlotte’s help ."
Lets Close over $8 thats a win in my book. Small steps will get us to a price that withstands dumping.

Closer this gets to earnings in November the higher the price

Add 5 shares at $8.05
"@Sergy. I've never played options, so I'm ignorant on the strategy. But, I do look at the options chains to estimate max pain which is what HFs will shoot for, especially with CLOV. What I do notice is that the fee to purchase a 100 share block of options is pretty much equal to the current share price of the stock, regardless of the expiration date. Example: If a stock is currently trading at $5.00 per share you can buy $4.00 calls for a $100 fee, or $5.00 per share. Options seem extremely risky and if a person is willing to risk $100 for $4.00 calls on a $5.00 stock then why not just buy the stock? In regard to CLOV, options are killing the share price. Nearly every Friday, Hedge Funds are manipulating the share price of CLOV to establish maximum pain on calls and puts. The most effective way to burn the Hedge Funds and shorts is to buy and hold."
Bought some more at 7.89 today - sweet! 
You guys are so optimistic. Let me know when you guys are ready for reality. This stock is going nowhere.

News broke at 1145 that CMS has awarded CLOV 3.5 stars. Stock immediately jumped on high volume. Attempts to bring and keep it down have not been successful.
Extremely low volume the last two days. It’s similar to the daily volume at the end of May before mooning to $28.
Buying the dip. Gracias 
Add 5 shares at $8.10.

"The name itself is deceptive, designed to deceive and defraud...""Hindenburg Research"" is not a real ""research"" firm, but a firm that disseminates alleged analysis to depress the share price of companies it has previously sold short.
