people who are bashing clov rite now are gonna be the ones buying at 15
"Just saw my first Clover health commercial here in New Jersey, sounded real good getting ready for open enrollment.... Nice to see this, this is the start of our move up..."
No one is selling for a loss. Most people got in at 8 and above. Sure there was day traders but looks like they moved on. I hope our Team crushes shorts into oblivion for what they did these past 6 months
Easily bounce back to 10 soon
Wen lambo?
Too Many $8 Calls open this Friday but next week we should go higher
I love this platform https://stockhaul.today/LiveTradingRoom ! I signed up three years ago and so glad I did with all of the innovations they are coming out with. It is really an important tool to use everyday for traders. I have found no better tool on the market and i have used a lot of them.
super stagnant closing price for the past few days. Suspiciously stagnant
I'm holding 51000@ 9.00
Added 2000 shares below 8.
"As usual, expect algorithm controlled $7.50-$8.00 maximum pain share price today. Lots of call premiums to be reeled in by the criminal hedge funds $7.50-$9.00 range. I think CLOV will go down in history as the most SEC ignored, manipulated stock...if it hasn't already. The SEC is a disgrace. Over 14,700 shares long."
FOMO’s are jumping in!!! 
$27 thursday
Love the increasing volume. First sign of a strong move up.
"Calm down....volatility comes with the territory of winning, this is just a little dip. Denny can bring this down as much as he wants and will bounce back fast and more furiously."
Bought some more at 7.89 today - sweet! 
To the Moon
11$ soon
sec has been updated! Who bought a lot?
Run shorts run!
"CLOV is coming now, heading for an eruption..."
low volume
monday morning AM is going to be EPIC
"All of that shorting earlier, and still above $8. Might even close green on the day."
"So, what's the general consensus from the longs?"
"If it closes green, tomorrow we rock"
8.25+ today. Let’s go!!!

jon najarian just disclosed he's long on clov!!
"As I predicted, $7.50–$8.00 EOD so Hedge Funds can scoop up the call option premiums. Somehow whoever is buying the calls must think it’s a good idea, but from what I can tell they are always losing money????? If Hedge Funds are creating naked shares to short then this could go on for Eternity. I’m long with over 14,700 shares, so I despise this manipulation. Manipulation the SEC apparently condones and encourages."
Good Morning I count 4 deleted posts from our favorite
hey guys! I won't lose to short sellers today! We clov warriors win! Revolutionize America's complex medical insurance system!
Tomorrow going to $10
I have an average of 8.22 and hold 9k. I feel like I'll finally be saved
If you can (pronounce) *Describe Danny in one gif.
"Shorts are in range, locking phasers...FIRE!!! Next stop $10CLOV for the BIG Score!!!"
CLOV 3.5 stars guys LETS GO
I'll be back
"""BLUE SKYS"""
Added 12K CLOV
"According to Fintel, CLOV has now skyrocketed to 3.5 Days To Cover. That is very good news! It's a signal that a short squeeze could be imminent."
It’s true 13g filed by GeenOaks 50m shares converted B to A . Usually looked at as good news .
Shorts..time to panic..
it’s really funny to me because people are freaking out about a little dip like it’s not even that bad. I’m young and I’ll wait 10-20 years if I have to. I have all the time in the world for this. I’m adding more when I get my next paycheck
We will go green!!!!
Clover MA ads were on TV in the Atlanta market last night.
https://youtu.be/18_kJ_NMjZo
"Shorts better cover now! Low volume because no retail, and no insiders are selling. Algo’s trading amongst themselves trying to lure sellers. Not happening. This is a recipe for ascent!"
Add 5 shares at $8.10.
Green by end of the day.
Just read on Reddit that shorts are really 2.5 BILLION with a lot of naked shorts. This is why they are not showing on reports. Just a matter of time now when they can no longer manipulate the stock.
GREENOAKS JUST FILED A 13G/A.......LOOKS LIKE 5% OWNERSHIP OR MORE!!
Above 8..I will take it
Breaking news: No one is selling. It’s just shorts doubling down.
Wait for it
Power hour will be interesting
No one selling under 8
"Today, we win!"
ON MONDAY WE RIDE $CLOV
"It's one think for someone to say Green Oaks ""disposed"" of shares when actually......they converted class B to A. Youse wrong again. I can only imagine this person is playing with a toy phone that plays music....."
8.50 noon
Going to break out like nobody's business. I am calling the breakout early next month. When another big money player starts buying all they can.
where is Danny this morning?
"After reading the chart and doing all my DD on this stock, I have no doubt that it'll be over $15 by the end of 2021"
"Danny, Denny and Jim morning routine"
Just loaded up !
2nd time today Danny deleted over 15 comments total 
Buy buy buy. Time is on our side. I’m not selling.
I'm holding clove almost 4 months now
You don’t want sell 8$ then buy it 16$. Be smart patience is a key.
Still adding. This is like buying gas at $1/gallon.
Peeps who buy options in this stock are the ones paying HF’s and shorts … if everyone owned Clov stock cash and bought the dips and hodl…. Then retail has no loss because we hodl..:. HF trading with themselves… not financial advise… my opinion your call
"So, was the Hindenburg report fake news or was it fake news?"
Over 9 today

"I read where 2.2 million shares were purchased at $9.59? If true, and if it was yet another institution going long, eventually these instructions are going to get fed up with this manipulation."
ARE WE HEADING TO $90?????????????????
Shorts wants CLOV to close below 8$ for option expiring today Let’s all jump and buy more and start a new big squeeze

"Can't debate deleted comments, that's for sure....so Danny tell us more about Green Oaks dumping I mean ""Coverting"""
DANNY claims he’s not been wrong yet. In an earlier post he said CLOV is going to $6.00 on Monday. Let’s see if he’s wrong for once.
WALGREENS TO ENTER INTO PARTNERSHIP 
"I’m expecting a 10,000 point drop"
Buying the dip. Gracias 
No one selling for this price
"Hold my 15k shares at 7,99 avg. time is on our side… lets see what it brings next couple of weeks, months … long is the way"
We are trending on Stocktwits# 4. LFG
Can we do $8.75 or na?
It will close green don’t sell em your position in this company.
I'm clov soldier
We are not red. All we have had is good news the past 3 weeks. I am completely content with 3% gains a day.
"Green again, lets get to $9 this week!!! Then $25 by December!!!CLOV for the Big Score!!!!"
Let’s win this battle buy more
we are trending
Next stop 9.12
"Great entry price , after the star rating increase & open enrollment plus earning report in the near future"
up or down today?
Expect low volume and more shorting. Hopefully new investors continue to gobble up shares. Rinse and repeat of yesterday. Honestly don't know why they continue to short with clear support at $7.82. This will never bottom to 7 again. Its time for those Puts (YOUR TAKING A LOSS) ●Get Over It●
"So many experts here, they all sold at $11 and are now buying back. ..: SURE…"
"I love seeing the low volume. I know that may sound odd, but shows we are trading less a meme stock and they are looking at real value. With a base of hard core holders for one reason or another the remaining shorts will have to borrow and dig themselves in a hole to keep the price down or start to cover. They have no choice as long as we hold and that in itself will drive up the price going into the season of selling. I'm not saying we see $28 again but $10 in the next month is very possible in my opinion."
"I was saved But I don't sell, because clov looks forward to clov growth until a year ahead."
"added 10k this morning, ready to "

Danny Conference Calls
GUys - CLOV will hit 9 today
"The breakout continues Bitcoin could be in the process of seeing a "" volatile reset . "" By the start of this week's trading session , moving between dips and rises is a typical neutral weekly outlook which makes it a tough decision for Investors to decide how best to utilise the current market ; as for me it can't be more obvious that trading Bitcoin is way more lucrative than just hoding and waiting for the price of Bitcoin to skyrocket . I didn't think it was possible to make constant win from trading till I came across Mrs Charlotte Walter program for Investors / newbies who lack understanding on how trading Bitcoin works , to help them stack up more Bitcoin , since late last year till date | have made over 19BTC from 2.6BTC with Mrs Charlotte’s help ."
Lets Close over $8 thats a win in my book. Small steps will get us to a price that withstands dumping.
Well Danny Green Oaks DEFINITELY did not sell. So either post a link or stop spamming.
2 green candles followed by a 3rd forming
"Bye bye shorts Thanks for pushing the price down, now it’s time to pay"
WALLGREENS/CLOV Partnership Rumors are spreading around the forums !! could be the kicker to start the short covering.
"2.20 Million share bought at 9:59 , seems institutional buyer ? Good for holder."
I won’t give up clov soldier in japan!!
Not selling.
Did anyone catch that whale who bought 4 million shares? Can’t believe the purchase was made on the lit market.
Picked up another 100 shares today. 2800 shares and proud
sold 10k of my 7.70 lot at 8.51. still have 60k. watch and learn Danny. LOL
"The attempts to inject FUD are so obvious and entertaining. Get used to it - as I said before we are going back to 8s, then 9s soon and then back to 11...from then it will just explode. Ignore the noise."
"I am keeping my eye on the prize: $40 by Dec 2022 and $80 by Dec 2023. $6, 7 or 8 does not matter today or tomorrow. Stay cool my fellow longs..."
Still the most manipulated stock after four months LOL
Analyst Upgrade Monday 3.5 STARS is rated a BUY NOT HOLD
can it go to 14 on Monday ?
We just started .. Welcome to the party.
Breaking $8.08 is very important!LFG!
Seen this story 20 times over. Have a good weekend folks
"Dear longs, Danny & Dennys  might be too small to think long term. I don’t blame them. You guys shouldn’t either. The strategy should be to let them waste their time spamming a yahoo broad while we sip some tea, live our lives and let time do it’s magic on this little sprout"
Shorts are returning shares today.
"BTW, these are not pums and dumps. These are shorts blowing up, one by one. :) just hold, be merry. :)"
Place your bet clov in 2025:30$35$40$Your opinion?.. mine 35/40$
"There are over 40,000 options expiring today. 23,000 of which are between the strike of $7.50 - $8.00Unless tradition breaks and the stock rises to end the day above $8.00, then all the value in these calls are basically forfeit. People really should just buy the stock."
"I am proud of my investment in Clov. I truly feel that this company will eventually be in the top 500 in the US and feel that absent of a complete Canadian style health care plan, that this option is even more viable..Proud to collect as many shares I can and am certain that the future will shine bright at Clov..Not a pump , only an opinion.."
Buy more I added 250 more
GreenOaks Capital Partners LLC is an investment advisory service that has $13 billion under management. They have been invested in CLOV since 2019 when CLOV was still a private company. It is not known how much money they had invested in CLOV at that time. It may have been peanuts. There were 250 million class B shares in IPO in January 2021 and looks like GreenOaks owns a bulk of them if not all of them. Each class B share has 10 votes but no monetary value unless converted in class A 1:1. A few weeks ago GreenOaks had converted 25 million B shares into A shares. On 10-12-2021 news came out that it ad converted additional 50 million B shares into A. It will not be surprising if they just want to get their investment out as even after all these conversions they still could be holding 175 million class B shares and control of company with their 1.75 Billion votes compared to 250 million class A shares which can be bought or sold if someone tries to acquire company.
I believe she will turn 20 soon. Patience is all that is required. I put the money where my words are.
"never gonna sell, shorts will learn thier lesson like $AMC, $GME, $NOK $CLOV $ROOT"
If the shorts decide they cant drive is any lower they will move on amd we can start moving towards real value. I expect an easy double in 12 months.
Thanks for the cheap 2000 shares this morning under 8!
Prediction- today close likely above $8.4 pps
"Predicting another low volume day, less than 7 million traded, where during the first 1-2 hours, price will get manipulated down to around $7.85-$7.90, then towards the end of the day, they’ll buy those fake shares back causing price to rise and close at $8. Wash, rinse, repeat."
Volume is picking up. I think we're headed higher

Pressure cooker ?
"8.56 is not a squeeze .............. 28 bucks was a squeeze , thats why I sold out at 22"
"On June 8 price spiked to $22 on volume of 750 million shares. No doubt MMs who are charged with maintaining liquidity ended up with a lots of naked shorts in their accounts on June 8. Now after 4 months of down drifting + 25 million B shares on 9-8-202, MMs may have unloaded their shorts. So next up move may be more explosive than the previous one and may occur before mid Nov. Keep your seat belts tightened."
Not selling anything till we hit $20 next year
Up grade!!
Look it's Danny talking to Denny
Patience is a virtue..
Danny after-hours job
"Net, net, net: Clover is MADE for this economy. We're in the middle of retiring baby-boomers. This administration WANTS to promote good healthcare for seniors and the under-privileged and/or minorities. It's likely that Clover will get policy assistance from Washington. Clover is expanding into the Southeast where that demographic is prevalent. The Clover Assistant web tool aims to provide care-givers unique, personal information to help patients on a one-to-one basis. AND open-enrollment starts in 9 days."
