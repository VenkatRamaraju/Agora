"Anyone who thinks they?ve seen a #$%$ storm, they never worked at $EXAS"
"The temporary condoms needed in this WFH environment will buoy $REYN for awhile, as long as the rubber band supply remains solid. Cheap alternative when Trojans box is empty. Will drive significant short term volume."
REYN is down 6.80% to 26.13
call was not so great imo. company will struggle with shut downs and costs going forward as customers demand virus controls. sounds like Q4 was a peak in revs. this one is going lower
REYN is down 6.86% to 26.06
"Reynolds' products seem to sell just like commodities. Their products are not like other consumer staples companies (for example Coke, P&G, etc,) which enjoy huge brand recognition. Am I missing something?"
"Think this thing is undercover value, I always have Reynolds wrap in my house, this for the long term for sure, good div & good company"
This #$%$ pays a dividend. I guess $REYN is better than $OESX

"The market is trash, put it in a Hefty bag... along with the cash this is generating."
$REYN had massive debt. Lucky to be able to pull this off.
If you take a $REYN Presto sandwich bag and a couple rubber bands with you it’ll save a lot of money on Trojans.
Commodity price of aluminum is rising is my guess.
Reynolds Consumer is up 4.99% to 31.35
"Clorox down today as well. It could be rotation out from defensive/panic-buying stocks. With earnings out, now news lingering out there as a carrot. Play what is currently trending higher with near daily news updates (Apple, Disney, Amazon, Tesla, and some the drug makers for the vaccine plays)."
This one snuck up on me...good safe play with so much uncertainty with coronavirus...
Tremendous buying opportunity!

Expecting a strong beat. This company is simply great.
Seems like a good company to invest in...do we know if they will be paying dividend?
Why is it going down? I do not understand
REYN is down 7.00% to 23.51
"Good earnings beat. Covid did not affect this company, too bad the market abused this stock. Debt is relatively low & their free cash flow + revenue allows them to keep/grow their dividend for a long time coming...GLTA"
$REYN is an exciting company.
Some nice insider buying.

Good buy at this level.

Wait until $REYN announces a discount condom line.

"with rates where they are and where they are expected to be, who can argue the debt clause all that much. also, Lance is not a bs'r imo so the dividend should be around 3.5% making this a comfortable hold imo. the IP article was uninformed imo and authored as a devil's advocate POV. share holders need to employ a sense of critical independent thought imo."
Hi 5-wk high last Friday. Today (Monday) is falling into close on an up day. Any ideas why?
I put in an order at $30. What do you guys think is a reasonable offer? Mine was just a SWAG
Imagine the market wasnt down almost 700 dollars doing good for what it is
"I have a very good feeling that the earnings report will blow some people’s minds. If Tupperware had a huge increase from people eating at home, then this is going to skyrocket. Very bullish and LONG LONG LONG"
REYN reached an all time high at 29.83
I am buying shares of REYN each morning that it trades below $29.50... IMO $34 by July/August is possible
Surprised this stock has stayed flat all year. Every year more money comes in. Looking forward to see how they do this year.
Confident in this company. Everyone uses their stuff & they reinvest in their business. So simple an idiot could run it. Price will come around soon enough when the market is producing again.
"sell ....... wmt is 27% of sales....foil, bags, are generic so they can easily be put under private label. has been done by wmt before with other products."

Market swings this stock stuck on glue? Been watching it for a few weeks. Little volume. Surprised at the price action. I guess I will pass.
Yikes! Long term health looks fine but prices for resin & aluminum are killing profits at the moment. Back up the truck on this!
Very promising

It’s been 3 months & this thing hasn’t moved in any direction. Would be nice to see volatility once in a while! Spends the whole weeking building 1% gains then wipes it out in a day. This happens weekly on this stock
"Added more shares today as it dropped below moving averages. The longer the base, the bigger the breakout, but hopefully Reynold’s isn’t a dud..."
Reynolds Consumer is up 5.73% to 33.21
REYN is down 5.14% to 27.51
Personally I never buy the first week or longer. It’s a good company but my buy in point 22.00. Most of the time this works. Patients
$REYN seems like dead money. Needs a dividend but they had too much debt so forget that idea. Should sell.
Reynolds Consumer is up 5.02% to 29.49
"#$%$ is going on, why is $REYN down? I like the dividend but this ought to be up. I am tripling my long position."
REYN is down 7.11% to 27.09
"I think the InvestorPlace article made me feel better about owning this even though it was intended the other way. Basically took away from it, currently reasonable price with some room to go up before it hits a ceiling due to sluggish growth. Some dividend upside to offset that growth. Basically low risk and some short term upside for now, with a reasonable valuation."
When is this available on Robinhood
REYN reached an all time low at 26.57
In for 500 at $26
"Lots of faith in this company. With all of the cooking going on at peoples homes, their sales will continue to increase. I am always shocked at how many different kitchen products they produce."
"You should know by now, never buy on ipo. Especially since the market is going to tank in a year. Buy at the low of the recession"
Any idea why REYN is going down the past couple of days?
"The numbers looked pretty good in the report. Debt is still high, but the interest expense is a lower drag owing to the new facility. It looks like the dividend rate was increased compared to $0.60 annual posted on Yahoo here. Projecting 2020 to end at the higher end of the earnings range provided in December. Looking at something close to $1.65-$1.69 which would give a multiple on current year earnings in the 18.5-19.0 range. Not cheap, but not ridiculous for a company that can't keep up with the surge of buying at the stores. See how things play out, but this looks pretty good where we stand."
Welcome to the party. I felt lonely over here.
REYN reached an all time high at 31.75
I am buying after it opens. I like stable companies. I like IPOs where they are already making money.Debt is reasonable. I like the fact that they are immediately going to have a dividend. And it looks like there is plenty of growth outside of the USA.
Reynolds Consumer is up 6.64% to 31.50
"So period ending 6-30-21 2nd Qtr, REYN did not have enough “CASH” on hand to payout the dividends. It appears that it financed the additional cash. Not a sustainable course. Words “Going Concern” should be scrutinized on the Quarterly Earnings report moving forward. Hopefully it was a one off."
This would be a great buy in the twenty buy range
Reynolds Consumer is up 5.03% to 33.64
Solid defensive play.
"Interesting article in the Wall Street Journal Weekend edition 3/23/20 about “What Happens When Plastic Gets The Sack?”.A study showed that after single use plastic bags were banned, sales of small plastic trash bags increased 120%. Sales of medium plastic trash bags increased 64%. This bodes well for REYN. New York State banned most single use plastic bags this month. I’m sure more states will follow."
Anyone buying on the open?
