Market swings this stock stuck on glue? Been watching it for a few weeks. Little volume. Surprised at the price action. I guess I will pass.
I am buying shares of REYN each morning that it trades below $29.50... IMO $34 by July/August is possible
Imagine the market wasnt down almost 700 dollars doing good for what it is
REYN reached an all time high at 31.75
Still going long and strong
Personally I never buy the first week or longer. It’s a good company but my buy in point 22.00. Most of the time this works. Patients
"Interesting article in the Wall Street Journal Weekend edition 3/23/20 about “What Happens When Plastic Gets The Sack?”.A study showed that after single use plastic bags were banned, sales of small plastic trash bags increased 120%. Sales of medium plastic trash bags increased 64%. This bodes well for REYN. New York State banned most single use plastic bags this month. I’m sure more states will follow."
Expecting a strong beat. This company is simply great.
"Lots of faith in this company. With all of the cooking going on at peoples homes, their sales will continue to increase. I am always shocked at how many different kitchen products they produce."
"The numbers looked pretty good in the report. Debt is still high, but the interest expense is a lower drag owing to the new facility. It looks like the dividend rate was increased compared to $0.60 annual posted on Yahoo here. Projecting 2020 to end at the higher end of the earnings range provided in December. Looking at something close to $1.65-$1.69 which would give a multiple on current year earnings in the 18.5-19.0 range. Not cheap, but not ridiculous for a company that can't keep up with the surge of buying at the stores. See how things play out, but this looks pretty good where we stand."
It’s been 3 months & this thing hasn’t moved in any direction. Would be nice to see volatility once in a while! Spends the whole weeking building 1% gains then wipes it out in a day. This happens weekly on this stock
"sell ....... wmt is 27% of sales....foil, bags, are generic so they can easily be put under private label. has been done by wmt before with other products."
cant wait to load the boat.
... im brainimging vi in is
Seems like a good company to invest in...do we know if they will be paying dividend?
"So period ending 6-30-21 2nd Qtr, REYN did not have enough “CASH” on hand to payout the dividends. It appears that it financed the additional cash. Not a sustainable course. Words “Going Concern” should be scrutinized on the Quarterly Earnings report moving forward. Hopefully it was a one off."
Very promising
Reynolds Consumer reached an all time high at 32.49
"I think the InvestorPlace article made me feel better about owning this even though it was intended the other way. Basically took away from it, currently reasonable price with some room to go up before it hits a ceiling due to sluggish growth. Some dividend upside to offset that growth. Basically low risk and some short term upside for now, with a reasonable valuation."
"Think this thing is undercover value, I always have Reynolds wrap in my house, this for the long term for sure, good div & good company"
I put in an order at $30. What do you guys think is a reasonable offer? Mine was just a SWAG
Surprised this stock has stayed flat all year. Every year more money comes in. Looking forward to see how they do this year.
"Reynolds' products seem to sell just like commodities. Their products are not like other consumer staples companies (for example Coke, P&G, etc,) which enjoy huge brand recognition. Am I missing something?"
Reynolds Consumer reached an all time high at 33.73
"Good earnings beat. Covid did not affect this company, too bad the market abused this stock. Debt is relatively low & their free cash flow + revenue allows them to keep/grow their dividend for a long time coming...GLTA"
Reynolds Consumer is up 6.64% to 31.50
REYN is being featured on Cramers Mad Money as I write this. He was very positive. Rated it a Buy.
"I might load up on $REYN at $22, seems like a fair valuation"
"just bought 17k worth of stock at 27,1. solid earnings, manageable debt, insiders buying in consistently. This should bounce back to 30."
Why is it going down? I do not understand
In for 500 at $26
"with rates where they are and where they are expected to be, who can argue the debt clause all that much. also, Lance is not a bs'r imo so the dividend should be around 3.5% making this a comfortable hold imo. the IP article was uninformed imo and authored as a devil's advocate POV. share holders need to employ a sense of critical independent thought imo."
Solid defensive play.
I am buying after it opens. I like stable companies. I like IPOs where they are already making money.Debt is reasonable. I like the fact that they are immediately going to have a dividend. And it looks like there is plenty of growth outside of the USA.
Good buy at this level.
this thing seems pretty solid for $30+ per share.
Hi 5-wk high last Friday. Today (Monday) is falling into close on an up day. Any ideas why?
"Added more shares today as it dropped below moving averages. The longer the base, the bigger the breakout, but hopefully Reynold’s isn’t a dud..."
When is this available on Robinhood
Some nice insider buying.
