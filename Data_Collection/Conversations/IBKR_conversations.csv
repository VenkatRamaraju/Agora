The chairman of the company basically incriminated himself and the company on tv today
"IBKR to start trading on the IEX, the exchange that was created to counter HFT firms. You guys can read more about it in the book called ""Flash Boys"", by Michael Lewis."
I've used IB for literally 20 years and this is the worst and longest outage I remember.
Can anyone explain this? https://seekingalpha.com/news/3368144-interactive-brokers-dips-second-day-june-metrics-release
Selling short! Buying puts! We're taking this company down!
IMO -IBKR has turned the corner- Passing UP through the 50 & 200 Day moving average- IMO--Quarterly earnings will be up 150+% next month
how do you guys feel going into earnings? i’m bullish
"bought puts for this, i don't like this stock knowing they blocked trading of $GME, I fear a backlash and I also fear some liquity issues that nobody has a clue #$%$ those might be"
Could someone please explain why this stock is so expensive (high P/E) ? Thanks.
"Residual issues? I think having no trading access is more than a residual issue.....""Early this morning, we experienced a significant failure in multiple segments of a highly resilient data storage system. We engaged the vendor for analysis and recovery. We have mostly recovered and are addressing a few residual issues. We recognize the dislocation this has caused to our clients, and express our apologies""."
"That's gotta smart:""April 21, 2020Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: IBKR) today noted that, as has been widely reported, the energy markets yesterday exhibited extraordinary price activity in the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil contract. The price of the May 2020 contract dropped to an unprecedented negative price of $37.63. This price was the basis for determining the settlement price for cash-settled contracts traded on the CME Globex and also on a separate, expiring cash-settled futures contract listed on the Intercontinental Exchange Europe (""ICE Europe"").Several Interactive Brokers LLC (""IBLLC"") customers held long positions in these CME and ICE Europe contracts, and as a result they incurred losses in excess of the equity in their accounts. IBLLC has fulfilled the firm’s required variation margin settlements with the respective clearinghouses on behalf of its customers. As a result, the Company has recognized an aggregate provisionary loss of approximately $88 million.The Company does not believe that any anticipated losses will have a material effect on its financial condition."""
"What has really been in the news as one of the most profitable investments in the world, I really don't understand much about it"
this stock should be so much more down... so many hours downtime? I am not sure I will continue to trade with them....
IBKR might get bought by GS... MS acquired E*TRADE
Compensation required by the overseeing entity ! Thats fairness
"I called the bottom of the 2008-9 financial crisis the day after it happened. I’ll tentatively call this one, the selloff is over. Almost all signs point north now. Unlike 2009, though, we do have some big problems brewing (indictments, impeachment), but it was trade that was really scaring the markets and things are now looking very good on that front. Trump just has to make nice now that he’s won, rather than gloat. Kind comments toward president Xi, etc, about a constructive trade relationship, will cement this rally.I’m betting on big gains.$NVDA $FB $ADBE $MU $GOOGL $MSFT $NFLX $AMZN $AAPL $IBKR"
"One of the better trading platforms but the worst customer service in the industry and as a 14 year client they arbitrarily increase margins to multiples of exchange margin but don't even bother notifying and say take it or leave. They won't have many large clients left, If you own the stock, sell it!"
Am I The only one who owns this? Seems like the stock just keeps going up forever. Very good for my portfolio.
The cannot even handle thousands of customers including their investors who are losing for recurring tech. Issues
They say they will fix the problem prior to market open... They have 9 minutes ;-)
"Some quick facts to help you decide your investment in $GSX:1. Last week we have seen lots of manipulation in the stock price. MarketCap management/manipulation is a long time tradition in China Market now this comes to US. So don't expect this will come down anytime soon, unless there is some catalyst. ( @SEC) Also, the large amount of short float makes any manipulation fairly easy.2. Board members of $GSX, at the same time, serve on the board of $TIGR, which is the broker forced users to cover their short positions last week. $TIGR also work closely with $IBKR. Also, one of the board member is the CFO of $BILI. 3. One of the firms invested in their Pre-IPO round, Gaorong Capital, also invested in PDD and HUYA. 4. Larry Xiangdong Chen is a billionaire, ex-EDU member, left $EDU cuz had conflicts with the founder of $EDU, Minhong Yu, who is well-respected in China. He also once served on the board of $PUXIN.5. A random user on Twitter claiming ""I will push GSX to $100"", ""Dont forget it's me who squeezed your short position"" is actually Yongqiang Qian, Billionaire, Ex-$EDU, Ex-$DATE, a close friend of Larry Chen. He actually owns a hedge fund in Singapore, called QQQ capital.6. Larry has the trust of CCP.7. Those ppl, along with those PE giants behind them, are a gang. Also Smart, and Extremely Wealthy.Personally I think this is 100% fraud and I feel shameful for them. I know China's online education scene very well and GSX is Mr.Nobody. The big players are $TAL and $EDU. However, with the amount of $$$$ behind GSX, the squeeze will also be painful, so choose wisely, hedge your shorts, good luck with trade."
"I have had a IBKR customer support ticket number T878730 open since November for a simple transfer, till today nothing has been done. I have called several dozen times, some calls taking over two hours before connected to a rep, some promise someone will get in contact, other times I get disconnected. I hope IBRK can tell how long a customer has been waiting online. This is becoming worse than getting an appointment for Covid-19 vaccine, its painfully excruciating ..."
"Imagine if the market was down big, a global sell off.. Armageddon type of selling, no bids in sight.. Why because we rely on the internet to trade.. This just may be a warning to what can happen on a larger scale. A complete lockdown of all mats!"
"This stock will go down due to huge compensation they will have to pay !!!Closing my account , well I mean if i can access it today or tomorrow !"
65! And soon 70+
Mass exodus of traders incoming. Company is in free fall. Run while you can!
"Bought 11K @45-50 enjoy the dividend with selling cover calls, sold my remaining 7k last Friday love the platform but customer service is really bad CEO must be Changed ASAP.I'm here today to say goodbye to IBKR good luck to everyone it's time for me to move to something else."
"These guys should be out of business. There retail customer facing portal is just the worst, and I have been trading online with many different companies for over 20 years. Graphs are ok and snapshot info is ok, but other than news - which is good also - it is not possible to get further information on a security. Gotta go somewhere else for that. But let me get to the real gripe, market info. It frequently does not load. They have a blurb that says you can still manage your account but can't trade!!!!!! So, not only can you not trade on their platform but you have no idea what is going on with your holdings. What a joke! Isn't a portfolio management platform useless without market info? YES, IT IS!!!!!! And, it's slow. The only good thing is their low margin interest rate. If it wasn't for that I bet these guys would be out of business. Want another joke? They gave the guy who was responsible for designing this POS $70 MILLION DOLLARS!"
"FYI - * Interactive Brokers is consistently profitable, but Robinhood has the scale to own the future. GO - HOOD"
"Server Down, Phones busy, I tried to log into the Hong Kong Server through a VPN. But IKBR claims ""Systems are returning to normal functionality."" They can't even be honest about the status of the network. Like many of you, I will be changing brokers ASAP"
"Not sure y ppl say their system is down everyday. first time it happens to me (Been using them for few months now). Saying that, i cannt beleive its still down. As an IT guy that is really unacceptable."
"hi guys, I bought yesterday at 66$ ,due to market volatility all share prices are dropping for the last few days. what do you all think about the overall market. Will it continue with market correction? "
"anyone know what the real p/e ratio is on this, my brokers say around 20 but i also see numbers like 42, and 74 ttm"
Servers down globally
For once I will give a massive GO for shorties to short this stock to hell ! You will have the full support from social media to back you up with your report ! IBKR has let hundreds thousands trader down today resulting to massive opportunities loss and for many losing thousands ... Market is closed and cannot still have access to my account 
"is this common with interactive brokers!? im a new client , in two weeks its second downtime!!"
Time to short this one. Investors should flee this platform. Who are they to decide what you can buy or sell on the exchanges? You should expect that from peterffy!
$VIRT $CME $ICE $IBKR are interesting too. Getting ready to take a bite out of $SAN . gl2a.
About to lose a lot of clients today.
"Does the ""AVERAGE PRICE"" change everyday for the same unchanged positions for Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (IBKR) TWS? this has started recently, anyone else noticing this?"
