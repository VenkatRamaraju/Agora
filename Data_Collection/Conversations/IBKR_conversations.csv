Interactive Brokers reached a 52 Week high at 69.24
This is what I think happened.Hedge funds borrowed GME and AMC shares from TD/Robinhood/IKBR and shorted it.The stocks went up and the hedge funds lost moneyHedge funds came to the brokers and told them if you dont help us you are not going to get your money back.The Retail Brokers screwed the retail investor (who is their life line) and added the restrictions.CRIMINALS!!!
I remember the CEO of ibkr was disgusting Trump Trash in 2016 running his own ads. He is from eastern Europe and I believe grew up in a communist state. Trump is a dictator wannabee and this guy probably still drools over Trump. I hope Schwab buries him. commission free trades yessssss

This stock is going to crash bigggg time in the next few days! Wait for the hundreds thousands complaints to be filled and millions they will have to compensate for their incompetence!
"I'll love the euphemistic headline: ""experiencing problems."" I guess IB is an advertiser, so you can't say the truth: ""Interactive Brokers platform breaks down and fails completely, leaving traders stranded for a day.""Time to shop around for another prime broker."

They should have dropped more. Just look at volumes of all stocks and ETFs the past quarter.
"Our clients know the companies they own. With only 15 stocks, we take the time to keep our clients informed about our portfolio companies, such as Brown-Forman ($BRA) or Air Lease (NYSE:$AL) or Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:$IBKR).

looking for $65 when results of BITCOIN futures volume reported!!!!!
IBKR is up 5.21% to 43.59
"from scuttleblurb.comThe way the introducing broker arrangement works is that IBKR takes all the broker’s client trades and runs them through a volume tier that gives the broker very low rates, and those brokers in turn charge their clients what IBKR would have charged had those clients come to IBKR directly (the introducing broker keeps 2/3 of what the client pays, IBKR gets only 1/3). My understanding is that although these accounts generate far lower revenue per trade, they are still quite profitable because they are unencumbered with recurring sales expenses (the introducing broker, not IBKR, interfaces with the end customer). Still, even if these commissions came on at a 100% contribution margin, we can impute based on IBKR’s brokerage margins that they would still generate far less profit per DART than the average IBKR customer. Furthermore, the ultimate customer being sourced from these introducing brokers is relatively less active in his trading. This quarter IBKR’s average customer account transacted 400 times this year vs. 450 times the prior year and the average introducing broker customer spent $463 in annual commissions compared to $1,437 for the average direct individual customer."
How is this sham company still in business ?
"Well, that was the worst $4300 I have ever invested at closing bell. Anybody want to buy my stock for 10% less?"
"word on the street from the horses mouth is ""systematic risk"" and it starts with this broker, the reason they blocked trading is a violation of their company statement, robinhood had to raise 3.6 BILLION dollars. WAKE THE #$%$ UP, retail found a crack and there's some BIG risk out there right now, and GOLDMAN second this risk over the weekend, I got puts on all the banks, I believe were just getting started."

Wonder if they had a cyber attack
IBKR AND THEIR OPERATION STINKS LIKE AN OPEN SEWER.YOU CAN DROP DEAD LISTENING TO THEIR ANNOYING GAS CHAMBER TUNE WHILE ON HOLD FOR OVER AN HOUR.THEY DO NOT AT ALL HAVE ADEQUATE STAFF TO ANSWER PHONE CALLS OR THEY ARE JUST JER * KING THEMSELVES UNDER THE TABLE.THAT BUTTERFLY CEO IS TOO OLD TO RUN THE COMPANY & MUST BE REPLACED IF HE IS UNABLE TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE.OVER 60 TO 90 MINUTES OF WAIT TIME IS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE.

"That's gotta smart:""April 21, 2020Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: IBKR) today noted that, as has been widely reported, the energy markets yesterday exhibited extraordinary price activity in the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil contract. The price of the May 2020 contract dropped to an unprecedented negative price of $37.63. This price was the basis for determining the settlement price for cash-settled contracts traded on the CME Globex and also on a separate, expiring cash-settled futures contract listed on the Intercontinental Exchange Europe (""ICE Europe"").Several Interactive Brokers LLC (""IBLLC"") customers held long positions in these CME and ICE Europe contracts, and as a result they incurred losses in excess of the equity in their accounts. IBLLC has fulfilled the firm’s required variation margin settlements with the respective clearinghouses on behalf of its customers. As a result, the Company has recognized an aggregate provisionary loss of approximately $88 million.The Company does not believe that any anticipated losses will have a material effect on its financial condition."""
Compensation required by the overseeing entity ! Thats fairness
"I've double-insured as many of my positions as I could today. I bought PUTs on everything, just in case Trump and Kim (and Trump's boss, Putin) end the world tomorrow. I'm buying the priciest insurance, near or at-the-money PUTs expiring this Friday. Buying PUTs on $FB, $AAPL, $ADBE, $NVDA, $BOOM, $IBKR, $MU, $GOOS, $NTNX, $AAOI, $TGTMost likely, Putin will not expose his puppet tomorrow. Why do that, when he can be used to sow so much more discord in the Western World, while Putin strengthens Russia and its allies' positions? But blowing the Manchurian candidate's cover tomorrow would be like dropping a nuke on Democracy and would throw everything into disarray, because he would expose not only Trump but hundreds of our politicians as traitors. It could take years or decades to recover, if we ever do. This is much worse than Watergate.Anyway, I think that ""nothing"" will happen tomorrow. Trump will probably achieve ""success"" at the summit, which will help get more Republicans into office in a few months, giving him yet more power to destroy the institutions of Western Democracy. Putin and maybe China too are probably encouraging Kim and Trump (their puppets).So, all these PUTs will probably expire worthless. But I see tomorrow as a day of great danger for a black swan event, and so I think it's worth it just this once."

Based upon the lack of conversation on this board HOOD investors will continue to eat your lunch …….. what’s up????

"Some quick facts to help you decide your investment in $GSX:1. Last week we have seen lots of manipulation in the stock price. MarketCap management/manipulation is a long time tradition in China Market now this comes to US. So don't expect this will come down anytime soon, unless there is some catalyst. ( @SEC) Also, the large amount of short float makes any manipulation fairly easy.2. Board members of $GSX, at the same time, serve on the board of $TIGR, which is the broker forced users to cover their short positions last week. $TIGR also work closely with $IBKR. Also, one of the board member is the CFO of $BILI. 3. One of the firms invested in their Pre-IPO round, Gaorong Capital, also invested in PDD and HUYA. 4. Larry Xiangdong Chen is a billionaire, ex-EDU member, left $EDU cuz had conflicts with the founder of $EDU, Minhong Yu, who is well-respected in China. He also once served on the board of $PUXIN.5. A random user on Twitter claiming ""I will push GSX to $100"", ""Dont forget it's me who squeezed your short position"" is actually Yongqiang Qian, Billionaire, Ex-$EDU, Ex-$DATE, a close friend of Larry Chen. He actually owns a hedge fund in Singapore, called QQQ capital.6. Larry has the trust of CCP.7. Those ppl, along with those PE giants behind them, are a gang. Also Smart, and Extremely Wealthy.Personally I think this is 100% fraud and I feel shameful for them. I know China's online education scene very well and GSX is Mr.Nobody. The big players are $TAL and $EDU. However, with the amount of $$$$ behind GSX, the squeeze will also be painful, so choose wisely, hedge your shorts, good luck with trade."
They say they will fix the problem prior to market open... They have 9 minutes ;-)

"As a customer of Interactive Brokers for 15 years, I cannot recall many complaints I have had. However, today using this brokerage, I have been trying to place orders to sell a junk stock I hold, PIXY. In order to 'protect' me, the tool would not allow me to place a sell order for the price being bid, 25c. Instead, Interactive Brokers decided to place a limit sell order on my behalf, of 25.5c, ... this was to sell a lousy 200 shares. So in to 'protect me' from losing a $1 on the limit order I was trying to place, they entered an order at a higher price that NEVER executed. Their policy is that you need to 'call in to remove the cap.' Really unbelievable. Supposedly this policy has been in place for 2 years, I just have never previously been affected by it. IB support is blaming it on the exchanges.This is possibly a policy that IB may want to change, otherwise I don't think a 'free trading' incentive is going to work. What good is free trading if you cannot even control your limit sell price?"

"These guys should be out of business. There retail customer facing portal is just the worst, and I have been trading online with many different companies for over 20 years. Graphs are ok and snapshot info is ok, but other than news - which is good also - it is not possible to get further information on a security. Gotta go somewhere else for that. But let me get to the real gripe, market info. It frequently does not load. They have a blurb that says you can still manage your account but can't trade!!!!!! So, not only can you not trade on their platform but you have no idea what is going on with your holdings. What a joke! Isn't a portfolio management platform useless without market info? YES, IT IS!!!!!! And, it's slow. The only good thing is their low margin interest rate. If it wasn't for that I bet these guys would be out of business. Want another joke? They gave the guy who was responsible for designing this POS $70 MILLION DOLLARS!"
IBKR reached a new All Time High at 71.00
"I have a personal account with IBKR and a corporate account, I also have accounts at Schwab, Tradestation and Robinhood. without any doubt IBKR should go out of business. There is no value here whatsoever their customers will flee in droves as their customer service stinks, the trading platform stinks, and they are charging commissions. Maybe it is worth $10 in a firesale to Schwab or someone else. It's garbage. Researching for a short which in part I will do through their #$%$ platform."
Will be $45 AH today
buying puts
#$%$ IBKR... hedge funds now are making money shorting on u

"I called the bottom of the 2008-9 financial crisis the day after it happened. I’ll tentatively call this one, the selloff is over. Almost all signs point north now. Unlike 2009, though, we do have some big problems brewing (indictments, impeachment), but it was trade that was really scaring the markets and things are now looking very good on that front. Trump just has to make nice now that he’s won, rather than gloat. Kind comments toward president Xi, etc, about a constructive trade relationship, will cement this rally.I’m betting on big gains.$NVDA $FB $ADBE $MU $GOOGL $MSFT $NFLX $AMZN $AAPL $IBKR"
"This stock needs a correction , so l can get back in"
"Free trading has started at IB. Webull, Robinhood, Trade Zero and the list goes on. I'll never pay commission again. Welcome to the club IB glad you could make it. They just should charge a membership for full access not watered down software that doesn't add more value. This would retain and grow business otherwise it's yet another free trading firm but this one has capital."
So they steal money from all of us and the stock goes up hope to see it crash and burn

"I have started a crusade at IBKR that users/clients of the TWS platform should also be entitled to commission free trading.If you agree, give them a call or send them a complaint ticket.I believe if enough people voice discontent against this discrimination, they will come to the party, and the TWS platform, will also be subject to commission free tradingGLTAL in trading"
goes down daily
IBKR reached a new All Time High at 74.86
Do not invest in this LOSER Company!!! I hope the chairman goes to HELL and burn for all eternity.
"One of the better trading platforms but the worst customer service in the industry and as a 14 year client they arbitrarily increase margins to multiples of exchange margin but don't even bother notifying and say take it or leave. They won't have many large clients left, If you own the stock, sell it!"

"#$%$, I trade with them, they cheated tens of thousands of traders who wanted to trade pump stocks. GET OUT! People just not starting to flee from them and Robinhood. Go find another platform, that respects your rights."
Time to short this one. Investors should flee this platform. Who are they to decide what you can buy or sell on the exchanges? You should expect that from peterffy!

"FYI - * Interactive Brokers is consistently profitable, but Robinhood has the scale to own the future. GO - HOOD"
Burn this company to the ground guys. Ridiculous censorship
"I feel fortunate that my current positions are not ones that I have to micro manage, but I can't imagine this if I had a few hundred open option contracts which I often do. That could be very scary on a bad day. Hope nobody is getting beaten up too bad."
"why can't Interactive Brokers send email to all users notifying.Just keeping it hush-hush does not help.Such a market cap, and they can't manage IT platform. This is alarming"
"These idiots just changed their account management interface. It's a total mess. I tried to make a monthly withdrawal and instead they thought I was trying to make a deposit INTO the account, rather then sending out the money. On the phone with them this morning ... the wait time to speak to a representative on the phone was unbelievably crazy, so apparently I am not the only one who is having problems.They are really a bunch of idiots. I have had an account with them for 13 years. They should not be #$%$ off their customers like this."
IBKR is down -4.96% to 65.96
