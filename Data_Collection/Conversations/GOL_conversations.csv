Not good news. Delta needs to step in and show them how to run an airlines
"my previous projection that we would be in the $6 range by mid July has occurred, the march to $ 6.50 continues and then low $7s will then be next IMHO be patient with GOL it will happen IMHO"
1m shares traded today which is a increase from recent weeks. I have a feeling this is going to start to take off.
Gas prices going down.
BUY! BUY! BUY! The low $8's may be the last chance you'll have to double up on this one by the EOY. Great opportunity today!
this is a very volatile stock but will stabilize at or around the $7.10 area going forwardswhere bounce backs will typically gravitate too
When is the earnings report?
"Here in Brazil, if you want I can send the link. The auditing company sent the SEC a report that says it's concerned that the company will no longer be a going concern. This is a audit report for 2019 fiscal closing. Gol said there is nothing to be worried about. The situation is hard"
"remember my earlier forecast of $ 6 range for GOL a week ago , as incremental buying moves this higher to break upward resistances , we should arrive there no later then end of July with mid July as previously projected still a good probabilitythis is the typical recovery process on oversold conditions - be patient"

"It all depends on how expensive the fuel is going to be for Gol during the next following weeks. They just picked up more business from Taca airlines, so the potential for growth is there. They are good managing their business, but they were caught up in the middle of renewing their fleet with Boeing planes and maybe that is another emotional reason investors are pulling their money away. If they get cheap fuel they should be fine again I think."
GOL – Reports Aug total demand (RPK) +0.1% y/y and consolidated load factor was 76.9%.
short term stabilization price of GOL approx. $6.50 to $7.50 as soon as the higher base building starts developingand after the elections $9 range is most likelyin longer term basis China will help Brazil return to higher digit growth and prosperityand the airlines are the first to come with it
"shareholders equity is now negative 7.5 billion how do you value an equity where it has no net value to shareholders if liquidated, they are growing but do not produce positive net earnings to pay off their liabilities so as the real sinks and the economy dips any cash they generate disappear as fast as the Brazil real tanks - classic case of boom and bust cycle for GOL and they are headed for another bust cycle and lower equity value its a yoyo - ive learned not to try to sell at risng toops or try to catch falling knives thinking you got the bottom - trend indicates its about to break down south again IMHO, I rather sell when its going south and buy when its going up - finally I learned to follow the trend if the data warrants it use boht technical and fundamental and both looks bad again - so this is a sell IMHO"

"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
"I think it's time to go in. I have not figure out why this has dropped bellow the $6.00 mark. I'm spending this weekend looking at the fundamentals, all technical analysis indicates BUY."
Hi guys where is Stephen ?
$12 to $8.XX TODAY$3 SOON
ie the fundamentals of GOL hasnt changed and continue to improve as agreed by the analystsbut if you look at the price of GOL and it was over $ 7.80 two weeks ago when the Brazil Real currency started to drop so did GOL this is a currency led decline over the politics of Brazil and who will become presidentthere are only to viable candidates and both are pro or supposed to be pro business - so only Lula the imprisoned ex president is riling up the politics and causing the currency mess in the short term I thoiugh this was kind of dealt with back a few months ago but i guess they brought it all back againwhat a shame over something not even relate to companies or their economy just the fact that some believe the imprisoned ex president poll results showing him in the lead matters
$4.48 USD on way to $.4460This is a chance to sell and save 90% of your investment and then buy for a 10x bagalacaca
"Yesterday, this took off . It's going to pay in the long run."
Why is this so cheap?
"what happened to the stock price here, is the airline giving away free tickets or paying passengers to fly for the month"

"Both moderate parties said they would seek to strike an alliance with Rocha’s PRB, which has 21 congressional deputies and two senators. Following Rocha’s withdrawal, the PRB called for moderate parties to join forces.“There is a clear understanding that the country cannot flirt with extremes and therefore, more than ever throughout the process, it is critical that the centrist forces come together in a single plan,” the PRB said in a statement. by the way the story was published just yesterday late in the day - the picture of that candidate was taken back in april 2018 just FYI - yes its a very recent story of the positive elections developments developing just yesterday"
hit $10 GOL
Didn't know it had a 5+% dividend. Putting stop loss on at 13.25
I talked to two of the analyst for GOL and they both maintain their buy and $10 to $12 price targets and they said fundamentals are improving at GOL and that the currency fluctuation is temporary impact and no changes to their buy ratings or price targets this is a volatile stock - when it starts going back up - it will be the same way upIMHO

Just bought another 2000 shares. I expect the price to double this time next year after their re-opening.
"there is nothing more important then a companys balance sheet - they hit the retained earnings in 2019 by $2.6 billion negative hit making the shareholders equity negative $7.5 billion, they missed earnings last qtr by 50%, they ordered 60 max 737 boeings, the current ones are grounded, they got a serious Brazilian Real to US dollar issue that cuts their earnings even more, Brazil economy is going in reverse again last 2 qtrs. - technically the stock is breaking below all supports again - $10 to $13 is the trading range coming in the next few weeks or sooner iMHO"
"The fact that GOL is down has little to do with the SEC investigation and all with the strengthening of the dollar against the Brazilian Real and the new found political instability in Brazil regarding the upcoming presidential elections. There's some rumors that the Brazilian Supreme Court is trying to free Lula from prison and nullify his recent conviction, which would make him eligible to run for president again. The market, predictably, does not like that - hence the negative pressure on GOL and most other Brazilian stocks."
"earnings miss, macro headwinds, travel virus scare - after rooting tor them for past year and half the bad Brazil economy now with china in trouble and buying less Brazil products due to trade war - this may head back to the $10 support , cashing out everything , short term sell on this as technical have finally broken to the downside again and based on what happened last time the shorts will pile in which almost killed my margin account but I made it thru last selloff shorting and made out but don't want to go thru that again, reverse my buy position - strong sell on this now"
"ie most days volumes are 60% to 73% short volumes as traders are the ones selling mostly:The short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker GOL is 70% on Jul 10, 2018. The short sale volume is 130,482. The total volume is 185,832. The short sale volume percent is up 11% compare to Jul 09, 2018."
"Althought I am out now, always is good to see GOL doing great. I think it will reach 10 by the end of year."
Well I have options that after the summer pandemic in Brazil it will be a longer stretch but I believe(?) this stock in a year will be back in 12-15 range. If the country gets a handle on Covid. That is the X factor. I believe it is a well run airline. But what I don’t know is also the X factor.
"Gigantic drop tomorrow ASSASAOS see the PR, SMILES will implode and GOL along with the proposed capital increases to merge smiles back into the GOL. WHAT A DISASTER. I WILL MAKE MANY DOLARES TOMORROW WITH ME SHORTS"
5 days ago i tould to buy
Where is Stephen the genius ?
Blackrock increased it's stake in Gol. News came out today. I have no position in Gol but am thinking about it now.
Both CitiBank and Bank of America reiterates GOL Buy Rating and maintains their $10 to $12 Price targets
WHERE IS STEPHEN
GOL reached a new 52 Week High at 12.88
all supports broken we are headed to $10
Gol Intelligent Airlines is up 9.66% to 7.95
Well I have been accumulating since $8 and will continue to grab as many shares as I can under $8. Great deal. Brazils economy is just starting to boom after the recent recession. Delta is almost 10% owner of shares. Great buy opportunity and should see $12 by end of year.
"The short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker GOL is 74% on Sep 06, 2018. The short sale volume is 343,449. The total volume is 466,840. The short sale volume percent is up 10% compare to Sep 05, 2018."
let's go gol
"Remind that the analyst has an avarage forecast of USD10 in a year, pesimistic see GOL somewhere around 8. Then, trolls see GOL heading to 0."
"Hey Nostra, is this you 15 days ago?""Nostra15 days agoJust as I gave an information for you, now the GOL will never see $5 again."""
"I ewxpect a retest of the lows areounf $10 to $12 range as support breaks I expect alot bigger misses ahead , not only is the economy suffering and athey have a boeing 737 max problem but here is the deal for example Instead of reaping the benefits of lower crude prices, the real’s 24 percent plunge against the dollar over the past several months will swell the the overseas debt.Gol gets 87 percent of its revenue in brazll reals, while over 75 percent of its obligations are in foreign currencies. Concern the airline will struggle to pay its dollar debt will cause yields on its bonds to soar a few percentage points - as a result GOL from a buy in sept 2018 to a strong sell in Feb 2020 IMHO they lost their entire partnership with Delta and all other US carriers not good brace yourselves for a short attack once suspiciours posters show up soon they will strat the attack IMHO"
"technicals are breaking down , I never used to believe in technicals and charts and boy when I realized that technical algos rule the direction of equity more then the fundamentals , I am a believer now and use both , I see GOL going as lower as $10 the new support but IMHO its marching there soon for many reasons I just posted below I was pumping up Brazil airline industry during their worst times sept 2018 during the elections and they shot up like rockets, my new re assessment is that in the short term the mass uncertainty will drive short sellers in and its the worst pace to be with the Brazil real hitting new lows against US dollar that determines the airlines profitability - ovoid or sell is my new reversal analysis - you have to know when to get in to make money and when to get out to avoid losses an they are coming IMHO Gol airlines is almost all real to US dollar based and when real tanks so does GOL airlines - its almost a side by side trend line real to GOL airline performance equity wise - kind of weird but amazingly true www.cnbc.com/..."
"guys WHO is very familiar with OCGN as they have already visited the production site and accepted their quality standards, the wrap of of the review concluded on sept 10 India time which was last night , now they make the decision - we will know very very very soon - if the WHO chief scientist believes it will be approved by the WHO technical advisory committee who is to say it will not be - IMHO it was a matter of in August supplementing the additional data asked so they could complete the review by last night this time is the real deal ie the over promised but will be delivered results finally IMHO"
Any thoughts on price in a week or two?
"great recovery today, but I gave up on this..after summer in Brazil the numbers will go down"
"So rumors are that once the international airspace regulations are lifted, DELTA airlines will be buying out GOL. Load up your shares now."

"when the Court decision is upheld that Lula cant run for election - GOL and the Brazil markets and their currency will skyrocket upwards - cannot believe all this mess from an ex president in Jail trying to get out to run for re-election !!!!Court expected to rule against LulaThe UN panel's announcement came as Brazilian Attorney General Raquel Dodge presented a request to Brazil's top court for election matters, the Superior Electoral Tribunal, to invalidate Lula's candidacy. Dodge asked the court for a speedy decision, given the fast-approaching October 7 election.The court is expected to rule that Lula cannot run in the election under a ""clean slate"" law that bans politicians from seeking public office if they have been convicted of a crime and it has been upheld on appeal, which is the case with Lula.Lula has said his conviction was the result of political persecution and that it is part of a right-wing conspiracy to keep him from regaining the presidency.Under Brazilian law, Lula is currently allowed free access to his lawyers, who include some top Workers Party members, as well as weekly family visits.He can communicate in writing, but federal prosecutors say he is barred from making video or audio recordings.Dilma Rousseff, who succeded Lula in office before she was herself impeached in 2016, offered her support on Twitter, saying: ""Lula is innocent.""Brazil says UN ruling not bindingBrazil's government said ""the conclusions of the [UN rights] committee have the character of a recommendation and do not have a legally binding effect."" The government added that it said it would pass on the committee's findings to the judiciary.The UN Human Rights Committee monitors member states' compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as a supplementary text called the Optional Protocol.Brazil has ratified both texts, meaning it is technically obligated to abide by the committee's findings. In a statement, the Foreign Ministry said that Brazil ""faithfully complies with the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights"" and that its principles ""are also Brazilian constitutional principles applied with zeal and absolute independence by the judiciary."""
"Hi guys, where is Stephen the genius?"
China's huge economic success was driven by them taking Hong Kong back from the British then leaving the most capitalistic center of the world alone and learning from the highly skilled business people in Hong Kong and using that knowledge to re-invent China into a World Economic power - if Brazil would embrace more of the China investments they claim are buying up their country but in reality the foreign investments infusions they need - Brazil's economic growth would surpass 3 to 4% in the net few yearsits all about those economic reforms the current govt is trying to embraceif we hear any approvals of those reforms - Brazil stocks would surge rapidly again
Where is the genius stephen
Hey Stephen ! A big thank-you for giving me the confidence to buy many more shares of GOL. That was a month ago when it was getting crushed. I just sold the last of my shares today. Are you still ... all in ?
huge reversal uptrend later this week to $7.10 is promising
"Im out pals, however i will keep tracking the stock. I suggest to take precautions now. I think we may see a drop in the following days. However, there is a good possibility for the rally to continue. All the best!"
What is the NEW Float? Thanks
Brazil Real strengthens this morning as emerging markets currency starts to rebound and as China backs its Yuan currency
Ok folks I’m in long. I feel GOL will survive Covid-19 at this point. Huge upside with lack of competition due to Covid-19 induced bankruptcy’s. Am I wrong?
We have found bottom finally.
"@Stephen, I would have been concerned on how this stock is performing especially if your investment is worth over 2 million dollars. Very nice paper money account I guess. Here's my concerns. I look back at the 3 year performance of this position and this stock dropped all the way down to Pennies. A 1:10 RS was executed back in 2015. stock continued to trade in the low dollar amounts and in 2017 the stock increased all the way up to $14. I would have SOLD all my position and enjoyed the profits. I honestly think that this will drop all the way down to $3 level before it turns around. The entire airline sector is loosing money, and as long Oil prices continues to go up, they will continue loosing money. Good Luck...."

Headlines: Airline Gol asked the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an extension for filing its annual report. The so-called 20-F form is mandatory for companies with shares listed on the American market. The company says it needs more time to complete an assessment and a review with independent auditor KPMG on the effectiveness of internal controls. Gol says KPMG found that the report on internal control “is likely to include one or more gaps” and a warning on continuity risk — when the auditor sees the survival of the company in jeopardy. The airline industry has been one of the hardest hit around the world by the contraction in demand due to the pandemic. Gol says it expects to deliver its 2019 report within the 15-day extension period

"Top Fund Managers initiate bargain buying in Brazil and South Africa with Overweights:Emerging market fund managers hunt for bargains after Turkey contagionDaniel LeussinkTOKYO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Turkey’s economic crisis has created headaches for investors and policymakers across emerging markets, but for some fund managers, it’s a chance to pick up a range of cheap assets, from Indonesian bonds to Brazilian equities.. . . . .Chuck Knudsen, a portfolio specialist at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, says Turkey gave him the opportunity to invest in assets such as stocks of private banks in Brazil and India, insurance companies in South Africa and China, and equities of internet and financial holdings in Russia.Knudsen said emerging market valuations, based on 2019 price to earnings ratios, have fallen to discount levels, compared with their historical averages and relative to developed markets.“Brazil and South Africa would be two countries today where we have overweights and that we like,” he said."
Buy opportunity. Gas will drop back to the $50 per barrel.
"in fact the goal of the shorters was to knock this down 20 cents a day each and every day and when yesterday fell short they made up for it today because they were trying to hit as close to $5 as possible before going in reverse after this week to bounce it back the other way to make the "" round trip"" outcome so yes $ 8 to $10 by end of the year most likelyand $7.50 in the near term when political uncertainty gets ingrained in the daily likely of Brazil and its just the norm"
"yes GOL setting up nicely for a run into the mid $6 and possible low $7 this month as mentioned by me before - the possibility that the current Brazil Govt will approve alot of the economic reforms prior to the elections is high as it has been, the Real will slowly depreciate the US dollar back to the $3.70 then eventually to the $3.50 level by early next year, the Brazil economy will show a rebound in July and GOL control of the domestic demand market will increase again - there is not a better value play in Brazil right now then GOL in the short and into early next year IMHO"
Gol paid off the US 300 million dollar loan to Delta. That's a good sign. Let's hope that have solid cash.
remember the short term problems in GOL tied to the elections and the Real are short term phenoms - with short term problems that go away vs significant long term opportunities - the reward vs the risk is very high for GOLif you have the stomach for this volatility you could be rewarded handsomely herethese are the situations like in the past where 100% plus returns result in these special situation Brazil mkts froth with short speculators artificially creating short term situations that are come and go real will most likely trend toward $ 3.70 by year end and GOL price may reach $ 8 to $10 before or by year end IMHO
It amazes me to see how successful and free Americans are and most countries around the world refuse to become capitalist as well as adopt the same constitution.

"Forbes article is the most credible of who will win Brazil elections:they day once the TV ads starts that Aickmin will return back to the lead since he has the greatest TV sponsored Ads to be implemented with Forbes highlighting the following so the center right and the far right candidates are the favorites :in a recent client survey by Nomura Securities, investors from Brazil were more likely to believe Alckmin wins the presidency than foreigners. Some 56% of Brazilians surveyed said Alckmin will win, while only 40% of the foreign respondents said so. That would put Alckmin basically tied with the tough-talking Bolsonaro, who saw 41% forecasting him to take over.Other candidates, including a candidate from the Workers’ Party, scored under 10% from Brazilians and even less from the foreigners.The Workers’ Party recently announced their pick for the presidency: ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. He is incarcerated. He cannot run for office based on Brazil’s Clean Slate laws, even if he is freed from prison. Lula is serving a 12-year sentence for his involvement in the massive Petrobras graft scheme. That scandal led to a political crisis in Brazil not seen since the military overthrow of the Joao “Jango” Goulart government during the height of the Cold War. Brazilians have been railing against their leaders ever since the Petrobras crisis led to the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, Lula’s hand-picked sucessor.If it is Alckmin versus Bolsonaro, it is a question of whether Brazilians want an establishment politician who’s been in the system forever versus a small-party congressman seen as unqualified and uncivilized in the polite society sense, not unlike Lula in his time (and Trump in our time). The difference between the two personalities, at least, could not be more stark.Brazilians may be tired of drama, and perhaps the most drama-free candidate with some name recognition is Alckmin. Others might say environmentalist Marina Silva, the lead female candidate on the ballot.Back in March, political risk advisory firm GeoQuant predicted that the next president of Brazil would be a “boring centrist.”MORE FROM FORBES"
This stock is on a roll? why?
GOL is up 15.62% to 3.85
It’s really going to be bad if aug 23 is bad
Mortality rate in Brazil is 145%. In a year from now GOL will be minus 20USD
Is this good time to invest in GOL and/ or AZUL as prices are low n convinced me to invest huge buy confused....press if agree 
Bought more. Double by end of year.
Another day in the $5.00 range. Good sign.
any one in this stock. Not sure if this is going to go up or not
Don’t sell now. Stay in for the long haul and you will be rewarded.
"Jair Bolsonaro will still win the election LuLa in jail and cant be on the ballotall this over a small riot in Rio de Janeropure buying opportunity again like last timeI got greedy so my 1/2 million profit shrunk to $ 120,000this will all go away and GOL will surge in a week again - these temp problems are what is considered buying oppsI incfeased my stake today"
"and yes guys - the shorts are still at it today essentially putting themselves in a bigger and bigger hole every day:The short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker GOL is 66% on Aug 31, 2018. The short sale volume is 197,035. The total volume is 298,013. The short sale volume percent is down -9% compare to Aug 30, 2018."
Accumulating much more this month.
"I hope the CEO realizes when shares drop this low, investors come in to buy 10 percent or more to gain control of the company.

Monday is a new month. I say this will be back $10 by 2nd week and then $15-20 by end of February.
Brazil has the greatest opportunities and the least problems in all of Latin America - the turn up will be dramatic in the future and GOL will be one of those going up in dramatic fashion IMHO
"you have to realize when you invest in Brazil stocks you have to realize and deal with the higher volatility that comes with it but this is where alot of the value in Brazil stocks lie as there is almost a 30% discount to world index emerging market stocks that have a 14% discount avg - Brazil stocks are a play on their consumers especially the airlines - all the trade war talks and strong dollar has hampered the recent recovery but that will soon subside - the best way to play Brazil is on the solid consumer demand stocks like GOL where it serves most of their market and as the world trade, dollar and political uncertainty will inevitably subside further and normalize there is a big rebound sequential recovery that will occur although some risks still remain due to oil prices look for $6.50 here and then possible an attempt at $7 but if you hold it long enough it will eventually approach $9 for those will the will to go thru the volatility that goes with Brazil stocks and this airline sectorpatience and resilience can pay handsomely here in both short run and longer run"
the march to $6.50 this month continues as higher lows higher highs continue off a solid base
My target price is $.4460 USD
Also airlines have become more resilient to combating higher oil prices the past decade and a half through becoming more business smart. They started charging fees and have learned to create additional capital.
"the march to over $6 resumes next week, Brazil Real improving also , so things are aligning togo towards $6.50 this month - I don't knowing the timing of when we hit $6.50 just that it will IMHO"
Because GOL getting green Nostra disappear 
"where's Nostra couldn't hear a while,"
"good in that passenger unit revenues were actually up 7.5% to 8% over last fiscal year period, margins about flat and cash flow $500 million to $550 million - yes results with all the CR**P stuff that went down with strikes etc. and the results came out slightly better or flat to same period last year with passenger unit revenues even up close to 8% - that is great news for GOL , imagine what they will do with no truckers strike the next quarter"
"As stated, this is now heading to $.4460"
"they are still at it the shorts that is:The short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker GOL is 77% on Aug 29, 2018. The short sale volume is 300,954. The total volume is 388,641. The short sale volume percent is down -3% compare to Aug 28, 2018."
"Gol is a very volatile stock , when it starts going up it sometimes goes up 10% plus in a single day - the opportunities far exceed any problems GOL has - going forwards its those opportunities that will be relevant and push GOL back towards $8 to $10 range again and possibly before end of this year IMHO"

"heading into the Brazil elections the leading party candidates are all now claiming to be pro business and alliances are now forming tor the selection at end of July - if more pro business candidates or claiming to be form alliances - we may see a spark in Brazil stocks near end of July to give even more stimulus to GOL share prices as it rebounds on its own merits and undervaluationsRIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Billionaire Flavio Rocha dropped his bid to become president of Brazil on Friday as rival center-right parties seek to draw his Brazilian Republican Party (PRB) into an alliance for the October elections.FILE PHOTO: Brazilian Republican Party (PRB) presidential candidate and retail magnate Flavio Rocha poses in Sao Paulo, Brazil April 13, 2018.

in these special situation stocks like GOL typical after an oversold process is complete and a base building solidifies - they typical rebound 20% to 25% within 2 to 8 weeks - that's what the future technical signal here IMHO
"Analysts do not know anything. In fact, watch the lemmings all throw in the towel Monday when this trades below $5 USD. CUT TO HOLD, NEUTRAL, SELL, ETC"
Numbers out for July on Barons. Traffic up 178%. International travel on the way. Solid recovery. Their busiest season is coming.
"Pretty quiet board. GOL has a solid balance sheet, and regardless of Covid status in Brazil, will weather the storm. Bail if you like, but the airline and stock are here to stay. Soooo pooeeeee from the USA."

This just came in. More good news for GOL. Gol taps into the Mexican market with MAX 8 aircraft: Brasilia-Cancun in Jul-2019
http://atarde.uol.com.br/economia/pr-newswire/noticias/2137544-gol-amortiza-term-loan-b
"Which to believe? The story NPR story about strong customer growth or the Reuters story about hugh losses? I started following GOL when it was around $7. It dropped to $4.90 and I bought. I waited and followed stories about how this company has worked hard to keep up to date and cut fuel expenses. When it dips back down, I will buy more. The appear to know how to run an airline."
Loving it.
"Company has less than 15 days to pay off a US 300 million dollar payment to Delta. It doesnt have the money. They are still waiting for 2 billion reais from the govt bank, but nothing yet. Yes, there is a probability of bankruptcy. We will find out very soooon."
"this situation not going forever, anyway start the all airlines flying, this stock very undervalued"
"The short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker GOL is 75% on Aug 23, 2018. The short sale volume is 336,554. The total volume is 447,890. The short sale volume percent is up 1% compare to Aug 22, 2018."
"Just as I gave an information for you, now the GOL will never see $5 again."
whoooo making money today
Today a great chance to short more of the GOL before the last leg down to $0
"Don't worry guys - the rampant forces of the Real speculators I call them drunken like sailors that have been targeting a $4.20 brazil real all year - and as I said before the central bank of Brazil would protect the Real against these speculators artificially trying to drive down the real , the brazil markets and the likes of those also artificially shorting GOL near 70% to 80% every day here is the deal by year end of this year the Real will return to normal or $3.70 next year end the real could be at $3.20 USD/BRL which would literally skyrocket GOL into the outer sphere ie $10 to $12 dollars and maybe a lot more here is the deal:Today, until 2:00pm Brasília time, the speculators trying to tank the BRL and depreciate it drove every EM currencies down and after that happened also the Argentinean central bank acted to protect the peso. at that same time 2.00 pm Brazil timer Brazils central Bank communicated a 1,5billion swap, other EMs came up along Edith the BRL.Yes as I have told every one before the Brazil Central would intervene to protect the Real from the speculators trying to damage the Real artificially to make moneyremember by year end GOL will rebound to $8 or more and early next year GOL will be close to the $10 to $12 price target of the 3 major brokerage firms Bank of America Citibank and Deutsche BankGOL order a lot of new Boeing state of the art panes just recently - GOL is becoming the SouthWest airline of Brazil - it will dominate in the future"
guys great news to reportI spoke to the company today and they indicated that they have reduced their capacity from 3% to 2% kind of like what USA airlines have done in the last few years to be able to fill more seats and make more money on each flightaccording to them their domestic demand is a robust +3% to +4% increase which is double their capacity increase and therefore has been able to recapture ie offset any cost increases thru their fare prices which resulted in their positive 2nd qtr and they continue to do so under the challenging macro picture - ie oil prices etc..therefore they maintain high liquidity and are able to make adjustments to operations as needed to ensure their success
"Unfortunately I have to agree with Jt. South America (especially Brazil) is far behind in its vaccinations, lax in its lock-downs (will continue to spread at a high rate), and is entering into winter (aggravating the spreading). BUT, I believe this time next year They will be largely vaccinated with heard immunity, coming out of their summer and huge pent-up demand reflected in their 2X stock price. I bought a fairly large amount of the Jan 20, 2023 CALLS. I will make lots of money.Your thoughts?"
Should see $9 to $10 easy in 3 months.
were headed to $7.10 guysas Ive said for two days - not much will stop it
"GOL announces prelim quarter results ( looking good - drop in share prices unwarranted)check their prelim results announced - the data was so good they announced prelim results - that is a good sign going forwards and this despite all the political, truckers strike etc."
Id love to see a quick debate between stephen and nostra
Im right here Nostra.. Almost 10% UP. How does it feel?
"Hi Stephen, what say you today, Another downgrade w $3 PT and stock about to implode below $5"
I have tried to post details of the Brazilian govt supporting GOL through the BNDES bank to the tune of 2 billion but Yahoo will not let me post the link. Maybe you can search and find it. Looks like they will offer some new shares and the gov will buy 60%. The article is in Portuguese and I don't read it as well as I speak it. Good luck. This is a positive for sure.
unbelievable that investors keep the stock at 32% of prepandemic levels 1 day before q3 release that had around 40% of flights and it being >55% for about a month with summer time beginning.
Building a solid base.
today GOL is green can not see Nostra
$azul $azul $azul
"All, time to sell GOL and move over to safer SBS. Everyone needs drinking water in Sao Paulo, while flying is still a luxury attainable by only a small % of the population."
"Gol Airlines is still one of the most indebt in the Americas airlines and will lose money from due to the Brazilian real decining.The real’s 12 percent drop against the U.S. Dollar will prevent GOL to improve its operations. This happens because 77 percent of its debt is denominated in dollars, while Gol gets most of its revenue from within the country in Real On top of that, fuel (Gol’s biggest expense) is priced in dollars as well.Gol’s struggles will be the same as other industries in Brasil because of the Real’s decline. This situation gets worse due to a drop in traffic and slowing economy as China corona virus hits . On top of all these, there is a bigger problem hurting; GOL is hyper-indebted with the Real declining as in other Brazilian Airlines Latam and Azul will see their operation costs more then double IMHO if the Real stays at this all time low levels .For GOL, a big problem is their debts.The problem is Gol is hyper-indebted, and the dollar hurts them as the Real declines the debt costs increase and their margins suffer how in the world did their shareholders equity value decline by another $2.5 billion to $7.5 billion negative equity value for shareholders is a head scratcher for me , to me the share prices should have drop to $10 as a result of the above and lower if it persists IMHOthe technical look like its about to break the support level, if it does , its a long ways down to $10 the next support after $13 and $14 breaks IF it breaks just my assessment , I called the bottom in sept 2018 and now I am called the reversal down IMHO from experience of this cyclical yoyo of a volatile stock headed on a current downhill trajectory push momo"
oil prices should weaken in the 3rd quarter driven by supplies higher then expectations but oil shortages may reappear in the 4th quarter of this year depending on the types of sanctions that appear and how much weaker demand is or notbut this month and next month should be good for GOL then after that things may get complicated depending on unknown Macro events - but this thru next month should be good size bounce for GOL IMHO only of course
"does anyone know how long the bndes credit decision will take? i read ""first week of july"""
"I short another 10,000 today at 4.55"
"post election this will go up significantly and in 2019 even more as the Real will recovery significantly per ABN Amro:“In short, the real is currently under pressure but the central bank will counterbalance this move by increasing FX swaps and, ultimately, by raising interest rates. Later in the year (after the elections) we expect a recovery of the real thanks to decreased political uncertainty and a less negative external environment. We therefore maintain our forecast for the BRL/USD of 3.70 end-2018 and 3.20 end-2019.”"
Fitch reduced credit rating to CCC- from B-. Not looking too good. Hope for the best.
"Good news, in Brazil govt might purchase 100 million reais worth of tickets from gol. Not complete yet, but a possible strategy. Also, the 2 billion REIAS deal, not in dollars, is likely to pass during the first week of July. This was in the Brazilian news."
I think that Bolsonaro will win on sunday and in the second round. GOL @ 10 by year end.
why is gol falling 5%?
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/emerging-markets-latam-fx-slammed-203747336.htmlyou do not want to own Brazil airlines anymore, last time the Breal was this low to the US Dollar the airlines equities hit new lows, as they profit or loss on fuel but mostly the currency ratios to US dollar at 4.39 last time it was this bad it was election based but now its economy based which is even worse , both Gol and Azul will tank as there are short sellers that prey on these Brazilian airlines when the real to US dollar hits hows - from a frightening experience I went thru when this last happened"
I haven't seen any posts here for a while. How are people feeling? Personally I'm a bit worried about the investigation from the Schall Law Firm. anyone heard any uplifting / good news abiut bailout money or otherwise?
GOL DOWN 14% IN 3 DAYS
"Everyone is calling GOL junk. Again, there's certain situations that's affecting the airline industry world wide. High fuel cost. Look at the performance of the US major airlines, stocks dropped also. Go ahead, run away from this POS. That will make more shares available to BUY,,,P.S today OPEC is meeting and CRUDE prices are already dropping."
the 10 year support has always held except for the great recession -and only that coupled with a govt overthrow - now that they are in a recovery with 2.6% plus growth in GDP forecasted for 2019 just wait for the inevitable macro and political events to ease their way out plus the open skies agreement will have many years of additive accreditive earnings top and bottom linealways get it when the reward to risk is high and temporary risks make it an extreme value play IMHOthe risks will be removed over a short period of time and the recovery phase will ensue with share price to normalize back incremental closer to $ 6.50 to $9
https://seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4437423-gol-is-currently-undervalued-by-the-market
7%. Still doubts of the potential here?
"Was holding 30,000 shares, sold off 28,000. Waiting for a dip to RÉ enter : )"
"gol merging with usa airlines under ""one world"" alliance would that help make this stock to go up after this whole crisis is over?"
"what a great opportunity to buy in at this price, after the covid situation in Brazil normalizes I see this stock in the 12-15 range"
"there is a good chance the short volume of approx 1.2 million will need to start covering today so the price of GOL will bounce back up todaygreed goes both ways and if the Central Bank of brazil intervenes as expected to help their currency this morning as the Real is improving - the shorting that has occurred will reverse up ASAP IMHO and GOl share prices stabilize and head towards over $6 again towards $6.30 to $6.70 range until the elections are over , then it heads back over $7 towards $8 again after the elections IMHO"
"I keep seeing folks stating that Delta owns shares of GOL. Doing my research I can't find that information. Brazilian economy is going thru hard times, this will drop bellow $6 and then back up again."
4.13 Brazilian Real to US dollar. Brazilian Real is heading up again.
Gol I still sinking since Real at 4.0 makes it harder to pay dollar debt and buy jet fuel with dollars. Also hurts travel in an de out of Brazil. They could go under and have credit lowered again.
if it touches bottom again it could mean adding more shares.
Ok - this thing is heading impulsively up....anyone with a new PT for this based on the updated guidance?
Buying as much as I Can For Long term!
"80% of shares sold yesterday were short sales meaning no one is really selling:The short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker GOL is 80% on Aug 28, 2018. The short sale volume is 400,378. The total volume is 499,948. The short sale volume percent is up 11% compare to Aug 27, 2018."
there is fundamentally nothing wrong with GOL whose majority of the business is domestic routes with demand still rising year over year - the Real has caused a drop in international flights but that is only 8% of their businessso all the problems are linked to the short term phenom the elections which is now improving with Lula gone and the PT party in serious trouble with market friendly candidates coming back to the for front to be situated in the final roundand as this cloud is finally lifting and it just started lifting today with both the Lula supreme court decision and the Real rebounding significantly - it bodes will for GOL going forwards IMHO
Not sure there are any investors on this board but We will see you at 12 By ChristmasHappy to see Gol back to March prices
"The short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker GOL is 74% on Aug 22, 2018. The short sale volume is 636,629. The total volume is 855,693. The short sale volume percent is up 9% compare to Aug 21, 2018."
China will form alliances with Brazil in the future to buy and build up its natural resources - Brazil in turn will become the China of Latin America..the surge in Brazil assets will be HUGE in the coming yearsthey will start will going after Brazils copper assetsGOL airlines will be the SouthWest airlines of Brazil in a few yearsthey got a new fleet of the latest Boeing arriving this year and will be state of the art airline
Seems to be holding $9 well. $10+ by the end of the year.
"the problem in Brazil is they over grew the capacity in the last 2 years expecting a big economic surge now the load factors are dropping and costs will shoot up due to the tanking real, one big airline already went out of business , the rest of their airlines will now have hard times and their equity may go back down to 52 week lows again, it happens everytime their real and economy goes reverses course and this time is no different with the entire world growth now in distress -sell all Brazil airlines especially GOL that has a negative shareholders equity of 7.5 billion in neg equity , Delta tossed their partnership with them sept 2019 and sold the entire stake, this spells trouble ahead for GOL and that was before the Brazilian real hit within one cent of all time lows"
Emerging markets are where the risks have been but that is exactly where the rewards are also - money flow will slowly gravitate back to Brazil emerging market as the overblown oversold based risks become clarified and removed - big and smart money will soon gravitate here - if you position yourself well - the rewards can be significant
I talked to both Bank of America/Merill Lynch and Citigroup GOL analyst and they both maintain their buy recommendations as of today and their $12 and $10 price targets for GOL this FX currency is a short term phenom and will stabilize itself back soonthe Brazil Central bank still has over $50 billion in reserves to help support its currency and did so during June this year IMHO
Trend look like GOL is done.
It's time to buy
GOL will seek bankruptcy protection before the end of the year....not to go out of business but to protect their fleet. Current shareholders may get burned badly. I think they will recover nicely 2 to 4 yrs out but very bad environment for them right now.
GOL was 3 last november. Then steady slow climb to 20+
5% UP today. This article from ZACKS just came in today. You are still in time to jump in. AVG price target is somewhere between 8-10 USD. 50% UP from here.
"too bad I had no free cash today otherwise I would have bought another 350,000 shares If I could havethat's life , classic investing mistake is no risk mgmt. with stop losses and no dry powder to go all in on weeks and days like today when the price is more then like stealing it for a lot less then it should - yes I will beat myself up for not implanting the correct strategy to wait for this key price level to then go all in but not until today - my crystal ball was slightly off"
Stop using this SITE for advertising other SITES. Only the GOL stock news are important.
MORE GOOD NEWS FOR GOL:* The real strengthens 2.1% to 3.9378 per U.S. dollar.* Bolsonaro leading for 10% (Market backs Bolsonaro).* The Bovespa Index gains 3.5%
"it will be tough going for short trades going forwards as today showed despite the high short volume %:The short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker GOL is 64% on Jul 03, 2018. The short sale volume is 157,580. The total volume is 245,219. The short sale volume percent is up 13% compare to Jul 02, 2018"
GOL reached a 52 Week low at 8.53
"Now is a very critical time for the GOL. The GOL dropped from usd $24 to $11 in one month back in January 2017...$11 then is the equivalent of $2 now after splits. My guess is $4 is some support then straight to $2 , then a test of the .223 low which would be $.446"
Great price to buy more
"No sells, all buying today. Call it low volume but 100% optimistic, bullish sign!"
Any opinions on what will happen to GOL today ?
yes for the entire week just about every day share volume were shares short ie approx. 65% to 75% every daythat's why that short paid shill Nostra character showed up - there are about approx. 1.2 million short shares sold this week that now needs to be covered and they need you to sellthe last time this happened - it reversed up $ 2.8 dollars up the following monthI only expect $1.50 back up this time due to the election uncertainties - then after the election the big moves up IMHO will then occur
"GOL stock now down 15 of last 16 days or 36%, down 60% from high, this is likely a Bk candidate with these trading stats"
focus on the Real back to $3.70 by end of this year - everything in between is just noise created by speculators that come and go Brazil is destined to succeed with GOL one of the biggest winners IMHOremember these speculators running these short chop shops come and go and post all kinds of nonsense - just ignore them
Azul and Gol reported August traffic! Gol up 84% year over year! And Azul 178% for the same period!
"Brazil is the largest country in Latin America. More than 200 million people. Take away $GOL and $AZUL then they almost have no airlines. Those two airlines will not go bankrupt, at least not in the next 5 years..By the second week to July these two airlines should be up 150% each. The market, stock brokers, impatient people who want to get rich overnight, angry people like creating fear. Did I mention that Brazil has a new Treasury secretary to oversee the Airlines stability as soon as possible?"
"I am also pushing or asking really the CFO to market this company more to major institutions to help enhance she share value and to remove some of the fluctuations that exist thru bigger institutional holdings as well as asking one of the GOL analyst to ask the CFO to do the same to put pressure on them - if you dont ask you dont get resultsyes I own almost as many shares as Blackrock has in their GOL holdings report and I plan to see this back towards the $6.70 range when this temporary selling is over just remember the fundamentals of the company is improving that is why the buy rating from the analysts do your own diligence but IMHO I got this one right it went near $8 on my previous callthen $6,70 on my most recent although short of the $7.10 due to the currency dropbut IMHO we are headed next back towards $6.70 in the not too distant future"
"Look at TSA figures - bookings going up - and earnings - also going up. Combine this with their increased vaccination rates, economy opening (especially with the commodity sector being rotated into, which always helps South American economies) and their summer coming in a few months and the price should boom! Anyone else see this as a buy?!"
Bolsonaro will bankrupt this company.
my prediction that GOL will be in the 6 range by end of 2nd week of July and no later then endof July has high probability of being realized - the dynamics of the rebound is slowly developinginto fruition as the base is solidly formed IMHO
the Brazil Real the Brazil markets and GOL should start bouncing back todayits way oversold and driven down by shorts but things change todayso watch for the reversal up most of today
my short term target price recovery for GOL remains at $6 to $6.50 where it the price will stabilize at before it proceeds higher later on of which the timing I am not certain of but only this range I have very high confidence in as of now IMHO
"good news for Brazil:Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a proclamation allowing Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to provide targeted relief from quotas imposed under Section 232 on steel from South Korea, Argentina, and Brazil, and aluminum from Argentina"
believe me when I say that the contagion theory was all made up by short hedge funds shorting all the EM currencies - its contained in Turkey and Argentina - no spreading except by those short IMHO
Any news on this stock?
where is all this downward pressure coming from. great news on friday showed how underpriced the stock is. all the news since the debt-repayal were like this. and still its sold so heavily?
"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s front-running far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro was stabbed in the abdomen while campaigning on Thursday, and is in serious condition and undergoing surgery, his son and a hospital spokeswoman said."
"Earnings today, after the market closes."
74% of shares sold yesterday were short sales shares on Aug 22 - so no one is really selling except shorting
Not sure why the market reaction since market backed Bolsonaro.
"NOSTRA for the first time i am here you are right. A month ago you predicted that GOL will never see USD 5 again. You were right. Now is in the USD 6 area. Well... i know its not what you meant, but a broken clock get the right hour 2 times a day."
$8-$9 in 3 to 4 months.
I was out in a theme park yesterday and it was packed travel coming back
"I think Nostra own an apologize for this stock and for us , what do you think's fellas "
Looking out 6 months this company and the industry will be doing much better. Especially when international travel opens up for gol. Good time to take a position
Why is this heading down?????
"after analyzing the technical chart and the high volume selling last 2 days , it will tsrend down to the 13.30 to 14.40 range at a minimum and if those 2 levels do not hold then it will fall all the way down to $ 10.50 range where it will stabilize and hold , march usuualy is the worst month for this sirline with april and may before the summer also not good months but the march month is where I expect alot of selling as poor economic inidcators and a bad real hits thee hardest st this time of year"
"shorts continue to pile up on shares they will need to cover:The short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker GOL is 75% on Aug 30, 2018. The short sale volume is 180,865. The total volume is 241,153. The short sale volume percent is down -2% compare to Aug 29, 2018."
"Guys Fantastic News for the Real, the Brazilian stock market and GOL share prices - ie they are all headed uphill fast:Tonight the Brazilian courts barred LuLa from running for President of brazil !!!!!!!y Associated Press August 31 at 10:29 PMSAO PAULO — The Latest on whether former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva can be a candidate in this year’s presidential election (all times local):11:20 p.m.A majority of justices on Brazil’s electoral court have voted to bar ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from running in October’s presidential election, virtually ending his candidacy.After several hours of debate late Friday, four of the seven justices had voted against da Silva’s candidacy and just one in favor. Two other justices were still to vote, but only a majority is needed for a ruling."
I'll keep buying
bottom feeder time!
"GOL did well during the truckers strike, they were solid in Aug and July with very tough comparables in 2017 - the trend in Domestic Airline growth is very solid and growing - fundamentals going forwards even better ( ie forget the shorter chop shops that come and go playing hysteria on a very solid fundamentally driven company with growing demand)here is the deal:If GOL can continue to do this well under trying times - imagine what GOL will do under the better times coming and with the headwinds about to be taken away with the Elections related climate going positive and eventual EM situation slowly improving and once gone and turns up - the amount of catalyst drivers and the opportunities that currently exist is enormousBrazil is the EM Latin favorite for a reason - as their exports will be increasing - which is the prime or best way to drive economic growth by exporting more so that domestic demand continues to growth and with it a faster placeBrazil is one of the few countries less affected by the current trade wars and with China looking for more natural resources in Latin America especially copper , soybeans, pork etc. Brazil economic rebound will be one of the best in Latin Americait could be like the last time Brazil came out of an Election plagued year with follow up economic boon renaissance in subsequent yearsif you have the guts to handle the current volatility - you get the 2x payoffs - it sounds simple beause that is the situation Brazil is in - high level payoffs for your abiity to handle itsame with Gol and the airlines - its a very high reward gutsy play that is winnable iMHO"
"GOL making a run, anyone have a target price?"
The Fed in Brazil just announced they are buying shares of GOL and AZUL to support the companies here. Don't fight the Fed.
Long and strong!
"$BRZU the last time Real to US dollars hit $4.05 , GOL airlines fell to $4.50 now the real is even weaker , GOl airlines is most debt ridden Brazilian airline with the worst negative shareholder equity of all their BRazilian airlines neg $7.5 billion negative shareholder equity a stunning worsening of the balance sheet by another $2.5 billion on their recent 2019 year end issued, essentially its worthless as real sinks and travel dives , all technical broken headed for $10"
"Wondering why GOL is dropping ? Sadly :BUSINESS NEWSAUGUST 27, 2020 / 3:04 AM / 4 DAYS AGODelta, facing its own troubles, may have to repay $300 million on behalf of Brazil's GolMarcelo Rochabrun5 MIN READSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) is facing a fresh Latin American headache as a Monday deadline nears for former Brazilian partner Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (GOLL4.SA) to repay a $300 million loan that the U.S. carrier guaranteed. If Gol fails to repay - which ratings agencies say is looking more likely - Delta would have to honor the debt on Gol's behalf, honoring the five-year-old agreement. But just like Gol, the Atlanta-based carrier, which said in July it was burning $27 million a day here has little cash to spare due to the coronavirus pandemic.Gol’s struggles are just the latest challenge for Delta, whose investments in Latin America, once seen as a growth area, have faltered due to COVID-19.Delta's 49% stake in Aeromexico and 20% stake in LATAM Airlines Group are at risk of dilution or being wiped here out as both airlines undergo bankruptcy restructurings.For Gol, Brazil’s largest carrier, the due date of the Delta-backed private loan comes amid a severe cash crunch. The loan was extended by unidentified private investors.“Gol is facing constant cash burn without refinancing possibilities,” said Amalia Bulacios, who covers Gol for S&P Global Ratings, which rates its debt as CCC-, at risk of default.By Monday, before repaying the loan, Gol could have just 1.6 billion reais ($285.19 million) left in cash, Reuters calculated. The calculation is based on Gol’s cash and cash equivalents, as well as its liquid investments, as of June 30, minus its expected cash burn of 3 million reais a day."
They will still be making billions now and ten years from now.
"Great lesson on how to invest. Buy when country is having problems and know their ppl still need to move about. Beats other phase 1 speculative sentimental people slagging off so called ""shorts"" because they're not making money. Live and learn. My portfolio has 8 such get ideas that are down >75%"
What app/platform do you guys use to buy stock? I am having a hard time to find a proper platform where i cnan buy GOL and Azul SA stocks.
Stephen take a gol's airplane to Brazil
all this noise is due to SEC's new investigation. Nothing new from what GOL has seen in the past. The company is cooperating with authorities and has already paid $12M in 2016.
Cant wait until the day delta announces the buyout and wish I could see nostra in person so I can see the facial reaction
GOL IS OVERSOLD NOW! WE SHOULD EXPECT PRICE UP!
"What's everyone's plan for this one? Hold, hold, hold?"
"the Brazilian Real to the US dollar will improve considerably in the next 6 months as the US dollar weakens later this year to the Real , oil will stabilize and Brazil will resume its 2019 2.6% plus growth - GOL will build a incrementally higher base to rise from higher lows , higher highs in a slow but steady fashion as there few sellers below the current price and only driven by some short term short sellers only - but GOL will see a steady rise into the rest of the year - the Macro picture will continue to improve - these are all the components that will continue to mend the GOL share prices back to a higher stabilization price - it wont be long before we wont ever see the 5s again this year - the share prices will be north of $6 plus for rest of year soon where the low end of the fair value resides based only on uncertainties and not future macros or micros of the companies operating efficiencies"
Oil in the 2020s will be produced so rapidly and consistently by many nations that the supply output will be significantly higher than today. OPEC will have to eventually realize that they are not oil cartels anymore. Competition is now around. The U.S. will export more oil in the 2020s than they ever have before. Mexico is increasing oil production. Waiting for Columbia to come back. Iran will continue pumping oil. Technology has made it possible for other countries that were not oil players before to get involved in the oil market. Fracking will be prevalent in not just the U.S. in the coming years. Russia banned fracking because of fears of cheaper oil prices. OPEC will eventually give in to fracking. Saudi Arabia purchased oil land in the U.S. it is just starting. This is the last oil spike before the decade of low oil prices coming in the 2020s.
IMHO GOL will be close to $8 more before end of this year and In the $10 to $12 range early next year close to Bank Of America and Citibanks price target and also Deustche Bank target as wellbe patient - GOL will come back stronger then everGOL is the SouthWest airline of Brazil - and become the dominant airline of Brazil iMHO
Airline stocks are up again today. We were left out yesterday hopefully today GOL will ride with all the other airline stocks.
"folks, my technical calculations indicate due to the ongoing 60% to 72% daily shorting %, the short shares sold has far outstripped the available shares willing to be sold left and the shares are very prone to a mini squeeze by TuesdayGOL therefore will be back in $6 range by 2nd wk of JULY - be patient - a lot of people make money in these situations"
This stock ought to fall all the way to 17 soon
"Just an information for you, today is the last chance to sell the GOL above $5 Usd"
"Hard to believe that people are investing in Gol now. Brazil will come close to collapse this year. More pandemic lockdowns, more confusion, less $$ in almost everyone's pockets and an election next year.If I was a shorter, I probably jump on Gol."
apparently his son was wrong and Bolsonaro is in bad shape - WOW the question is will he still be a candidate or is Aikmin going to be the winner now that the PT party will be desecrated and the only viable candidate left is Aikmin since he will be viewed as the only non-thug with all the TV ad coverage showing PT thugs and everyone else as unsuitable for running now
Where do we open on Monday?
USD to Real is near 4.05 in after hours as those short the currency are in panic modeGOL may hit $9 to $10 before end of this year IMHO
Breakout to $10 is coming real soon!
"some Brazil stocks and special situations like GOL and Brazil in general will be an emerging market play soon, foreign investors like China and emerging interest from US will emerge as soon as the trade war rhetoric subsides - some will get in earlier then others depending on their risk reward strategies but GOL specific is the most interesting due to its volatility ie with both up and down but the rebound metrics here has great posibilties going forwards"
14% up in almost three days. Just saying...
