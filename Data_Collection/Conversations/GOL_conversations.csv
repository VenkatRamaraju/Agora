"guys WHO is very familiar with OCGN as they have already visited the production site and accepted their quality standards, the wrap of of the review concluded on sept 10 India time which was last night , now they make the decision - we will know very very very soon - if the WHO chief scientist believes it will be approved by the WHO technical advisory committee who is to say it will not be - IMHO it was a matter of in August supplementing the additional data asked so they could complete the review by last night this time is the real deal ie the over promised but will be delivered results finally IMHO"
market cap too low. could this go to 4s?
"Brazil is the largest country in Latin America. More than 200 million people. Take away $GOL and $AZUL then they almost have no airlines. Those two airlines will not go bankrupt, at least not in the next 5 years..By the second week to July these two airlines should be up 150% each. The market, stock brokers, impatient people who want to get rich overnight, angry people like creating fear. Did I mention that Brazil has a new Treasury secretary to oversee the Airlines stability as soon as possible?"
Azul and Gol reported August traffic! Gol up 84% year over year! And Azul 178% for the same period!
"Which to believe? The story NPR story about strong customer growth or the Reuters story about hugh losses? I started following GOL when it was around $7. It dropped to $4.90 and I bought. I waited and followed stories about how this company has worked hard to keep up to date and cut fuel expenses. When it dips back down, I will buy more. The appear to know how to run an airline."
I have tried to post details of the Brazilian govt supporting GOL through the BNDES bank to the tune of 2 billion but Yahoo will not let me post the link. Maybe you can search and find it. Looks like they will offer some new shares and the gov will buy 60%. The article is in Portuguese and I don't read it as well as I speak it. Good luck. This is a positive for sure.
Numbers out for July on Barons. Traffic up 178%. International travel on the way. Solid recovery. Their busiest season is coming.

"there is nothing more important then a companys balance sheet - they hit the retained earnings in 2019 by $2.6 billion negative hit making the shareholders equity negative $7.5 billion, they missed earnings last qtr by 50%, they ordered 60 max 737 boeings, the current ones are grounded, they got a serious Brazilian Real to US dollar issue that cuts their earnings even more, Brazil economy is going in reverse again last 2 qtrs. - technically the stock is breaking below all supports again - $10 to $13 is the trading range coming in the next few weeks or sooner iMHO"
USD to Real is near 4.05 in after hours as those short the currency are in panic modeGOL may hit $9 to $10 before end of this year IMHO
"the Brazilian Real to the US dollar will improve considerably in the next 6 months as the US dollar weakens later this year to the Real , oil will stabilize and Brazil will resume its 2019 2.6% plus growth - GOL will build a incrementally higher base to rise from higher lows , higher highs in a slow but steady fashion as there few sellers below the current price and only driven by some short term short sellers only - but GOL will see a steady rise into the rest of the year - the Macro picture will continue to improve - these are all the components that will continue to mend the GOL share prices back to a higher stabilization price - it wont be long before we wont ever see the 5s again this year - the share prices will be north of $6 plus for rest of year soon where the low end of the fair value resides based only on uncertainties and not future macros or micros of the companies operating efficiencies"
Got me some.
Why is this so cheap?
"this situation not going forever, anyway start the all airlines flying, this stock very undervalued"
Undervalued airline stock
"Don't worry guys - the rampant forces of the Real speculators I call them drunken like sailors that have been targeting a $4.20 brazil real all year - and as I said before the central bank of Brazil would protect the Real against these speculators artificially trying to drive down the real , the brazil markets and the likes of those also artificially shorting GOL near 70% to 80% every day here is the deal by year end of this year the Real will return to normal or $3.70 next year end the real could be at $3.20 USD/BRL which would literally skyrocket GOL into the outer sphere ie $10 to $12 dollars and maybe a lot more here is the deal:Today, until 2:00pm Brasília time, the speculators trying to tank the BRL and depreciate it drove every EM currencies down and after that happened also the Argentinean central bank acted to protect the peso. at that same time 2.00 pm Brazil timer Brazils central Bank communicated a 1,5billion swap, other EMs came up along Edith the BRL.Yes as I have told every one before the Brazil Central would intervene to protect the Real from the speculators trying to damage the Real artificially to make moneyremember by year end GOL will rebound to $8 or more and early next year GOL will be close to the $10 to $12 price target of the 3 major brokerage firms Bank of America Citibank and Deutsche BankGOL order a lot of new Boeing state of the art panes just recently - GOL is becoming the SouthWest airline of Brazil - it will dominate in the future"
"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s front-running far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro was stabbed in the abdomen while campaigning on Thursday, and is in serious condition and undergoing surgery, his son and a hospital spokeswoman said."
Just bought another 2000 shares. I expect the price to double this time next year after their re-opening.
"80% of shares sold yesterday were short sales meaning no one is really selling:The short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker GOL is 80% on Aug 28, 2018. The short sale volume is 400,378. The total volume is 499,948. The short sale volume percent is up 11% compare to Aug 27, 2018."
IMHO GOL will be close to $8 more before end of this year and In the $10 to $12 range early next year close to Bank Of America and Citibanks price target and also Deustche Bank target as wellbe patient - GOL will come back stronger then everGOL is the SouthWest airline of Brazil - and become the dominant airline of Brazil iMHO
Well I have options that after the summer pandemic in Brazil it will be a longer stretch but I believe(?) this stock in a year will be back in 12-15 range. If the country gets a handle on Covid. That is the X factor. I believe it is a well run airline. But what I don’t know is also the X factor.
were headed to $7.10 guysas Ive said for two days - not much will stop it
Building a solid base.
$8-$9 in 3 to 4 months.
I was out in a theme park yesterday and it was packed travel coming back
"yes GOL setting up nicely for a run into the mid $6 and possible low $7 this month as mentioned by me before - the possibility that the current Brazil Govt will approve alot of the economic reforms prior to the elections is high as it has been, the Real will slowly depreciate the US dollar back to the $3.70 then eventually to the $3.50 level by early next year, the Brazil economy will show a rebound in July and GOL control of the domestic demand market will increase again - there is not a better value play in Brazil right now then GOL in the short and into early next year IMHO"
Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes is up 6.63% to 7.40

"Guys Fantastic News for the Real, the Brazilian stock market and GOL share prices - ie they are all headed uphill fast:Tonight the Brazilian courts barred LuLa from running for President of brazil !!!!!!!y Associated Press August 31 at 10:29 PMSAO PAULO — The Latest on whether former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva can be a candidate in this year’s presidential election (all times local):11:20 p.m.A majority of justices on Brazil’s electoral court have voted to bar ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from running in October’s presidential election, virtually ending his candidacy.After several hours of debate late Friday, four of the seven justices had voted against da Silva’s candidacy and just one in favor. Two other justices were still to vote, but only a majority is needed for a ruling."
"should I hold this stock tomorrow or I should sell it? Press  for “Hold”, press  for “Sell”"
"what a great opportunity to buy in at this price, after the covid situation in Brazil normalizes I see this stock in the 12-15 range"
"just added 15k shares, total 40k shares won't doubt if tomorrow get back the lost from today"
"good news for Brazil:Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a proclamation allowing Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to provide targeted relief from quotas imposed under Section 232 on steel from South Korea, Argentina, and Brazil, and aluminum from Argentina"
Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes is down 7.11% to 6.79
"great recovery today, but I gave up on this..after summer in Brazil the numbers will go down"
"Look at TSA figures - bookings going up - and earnings - also going up. Combine this with their increased vaccination rates, economy opening (especially with the commodity sector being rotated into, which always helps South American economies) and their summer coming in a few months and the price should boom! Anyone else see this as a buy?!"
"The reason of drop could be, that Brazilian market BOVESPA is down. It is on 6 month minimum."
Looking out 6 months this company and the industry will be doing much better. Especially when international travel opens up for gol. Good time to take a position
Gol paid off the US 300 million dollar loan to Delta. That's a good sign. Let's hope that have solid cash.
