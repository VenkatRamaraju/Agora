"there is a good chance the short volume of approx 1.2 million will need to start covering today so the price of GOL will bounce back up todaygreed goes both ways and if the Central Bank of brazil intervenes as expected to help their currency this morning as the Real is improving - the shorting that has occurred will reverse up ASAP IMHO and GOl share prices stabilize and head towards over $6 again towards $6.30 to $6.70 range until the elections are over , then it heads back over $7 towards $8 again after the elections IMHO"
Im right here Nostra.. Almost 10% UP. How does it feel?

"it will be tough going for short trades going forwards as today showed despite the high short volume %:The short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker GOL is 64% on Jul 03, 2018. The short sale volume is 157,580. The total volume is 245,219. The short sale volume percent is up 13% compare to Jul 02, 2018"
"heading into the Brazil elections the leading party candidates are all now claiming to be pro business and alliances are now forming tor the selection at end of July - if more pro business candidates or claiming to be form alliances - we may see a spark in Brazil stocks near end of July to give even more stimulus to GOL share prices as it rebounds on its own merits and undervaluationsRIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Billionaire Flavio Rocha dropped his bid to become president of Brazil on Friday as rival center-right parties seek to draw his Brazilian Republican Party (PRB) into an alliance for the October elections.FILE PHOTO: Brazilian Republican Party (PRB) presidential candidate and retail magnate Flavio Rocha poses in Sao Paulo, Brazil April 13, 2018.

"yes GOL setting up nicely for a run into the mid $6 and possible low $7 this month as mentioned by me before - the possibility that the current Brazil Govt will approve alot of the economic reforms prior to the elections is high as it has been, the Real will slowly depreciate the US dollar back to the $3.70 then eventually to the $3.50 level by early next year, the Brazil economy will show a rebound in July and GOL control of the domestic demand market will increase again - there is not a better value play in Brazil right now then GOL in the short and into early next year IMHO"
today GOL is green can not see Nostra
Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes is down 7.11% to 6.79
"and yes guys - the shorts are still at it today essentially putting themselves in a bigger and bigger hole every day:The short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker GOL is 66% on Aug 31, 2018. The short sale volume is 197,035. The total volume is 298,013. The short sale volume percent is down -9% compare to Aug 30, 2018."
Any opinions on what will happen to GOL today ?
When is the earnings report?
Today a great chance to short more of the GOL before the last leg down to $0
"there is nothing more important then a companys balance sheet - they hit the retained earnings in 2019 by $2.6 billion negative hit making the shareholders equity negative $7.5 billion, they missed earnings last qtr by 50%, they ordered 60 max 737 boeings, the current ones are grounded, they got a serious Brazilian Real to US dollar issue that cuts their earnings even more, Brazil economy is going in reverse again last 2 qtrs. - technically the stock is breaking below all supports again - $10 to $13 is the trading range coming in the next few weeks or sooner iMHO"
there is fundamentally nothing wrong with GOL whose majority of the business is domestic routes with demand still rising year over year - the Real has caused a drop in international flights but that is only 8% of their businessso all the problems are linked to the short term phenom the elections which is now improving with Lula gone and the PT party in serious trouble with market friendly candidates coming back to the for front to be situated in the final roundand as this cloud is finally lifting and it just started lifting today with both the Lula supreme court decision and the Real rebounding significantly - it bodes will for GOL going forwards IMHO
unbelievable that investors keep the stock at 32% of prepandemic levels 1 day before q3 release that had around 40% of flights and it being >55% for about a month with summer time beginning.
Stock is overbought here. I’ll buy back @ $7
let's go gol
"Brazil celebrates tonight:Judge Admar Gonzaga, who as a lawyer worked for Lula's handpicked successor Dilma Rousseff's 2010 election, cast the decisive vote in the 6-1 decision that sealed the leftist icon's ejection from the presidential election."
"what happened to the stock price here, is the airline giving away free tickets or paying passengers to fly for the month"
Numbers out for July on Barons. Traffic up 178%. International travel on the way. Solid recovery. Their busiest season is coming.
GOL was 3 last november. Then steady slow climb to 20+
BUY! BUY! BUY! The low $8's may be the last chance you'll have to double up on this one by the EOY. Great opportunity today!
"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s front-running far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro was stabbed in the abdomen while campaigning on Thursday, and is in serious condition and undergoing surgery, his son and a hospital spokeswoman said."
Well I have been accumulating since $8 and will continue to grab as many shares as I can under $8. Great deal. Brazils economy is just starting to boom after the recent recession. Delta is almost 10% owner of shares. Great buy opportunity and should see $12 by end of year.
I have tried to post details of the Brazilian govt supporting GOL through the BNDES bank to the tune of 2 billion but Yahoo will not let me post the link. Maybe you can search and find it. Looks like they will offer some new shares and the gov will buy 60%. The article is in Portuguese and I don't read it as well as I speak it. Good luck. This is a positive for sure.
Cant wait until the day delta announces the buyout and wish I could see nostra in person so I can see the facial reaction
any one in this stock. Not sure if this is going to go up or not
believe me when I say that the contagion theory was all made up by short hedge funds shorting all the EM currencies - its contained in Turkey and Argentina - no spreading except by those short IMHO
remember the short term problems in GOL tied to the elections and the Real are short term phenoms - with short term problems that go away vs significant long term opportunities - the reward vs the risk is very high for GOLif you have the stomach for this volatility you could be rewarded handsomely herethese are the situations like in the past where 100% plus returns result in these special situation Brazil mkts froth with short speculators artificially creating short term situations that are come and go real will most likely trend toward $ 3.70 by year end and GOL price may reach $ 8 to $10 before or by year end IMHO
I was out in a theme park yesterday and it was packed travel coming back
"just added 15k shares, total 40k shares won't doubt if tomorrow get back the lost from today"
"Gol Airlines is still one of the most indebt in the Americas airlines and will lose money from due to the Brazilian real decining.The real’s 12 percent drop against the U.S. Dollar will prevent GOL to improve its operations. This happens because 77 percent of its debt is denominated in dollars, while Gol gets most of its revenue from within the country in Real On top of that, fuel (Gol’s biggest expense) is priced in dollars as well.Gol’s struggles will be the same as other industries in Brasil because of the Real’s decline. This situation gets worse due to a drop in traffic and slowing economy as China corona virus hits . On top of all these, there is a bigger problem hurting; GOL is hyper-indebted with the Real declining as in other Brazilian Airlines Latam and Azul will see their operation costs more then double IMHO if the Real stays at this all time low levels .For GOL, a big problem is their debts.The problem is Gol is hyper-indebted, and the dollar hurts them as the Real declines the debt costs increase and their margins suffer how in the world did their shareholders equity value decline by another $2.5 billion to $7.5 billion negative equity value for shareholders is a head scratcher for me , to me the share prices should have drop to $10 as a result of the above and lower if it persists IMHOthe technical look like its about to break the support level, if it does , its a long ways down to $10 the next support after $13 and $14 breaks IF it breaks just my assessment , I called the bottom in sept 2018 and now I am called the reversal down IMHO from experience of this cyclical yoyo of a volatile stock headed on a current downhill trajectory push momo"
China's huge economic success was driven by them taking Hong Kong back from the British then leaving the most capitalistic center of the world alone and learning from the highly skilled business people in Hong Kong and using that knowledge to re-invent China into a World Economic power - if Brazil would embrace more of the China investments they claim are buying up their country but in reality the foreign investments infusions they need - Brazil's economic growth would surpass 3 to 4% in the net few yearsits all about those economic reforms the current govt is trying to embraceif we hear any approvals of those reforms - Brazil stocks would surge rapidly again
"Pretty quiet board. GOL has a solid balance sheet, and regardless of Covid status in Brazil, will weather the storm. Bail if you like, but the airline and stock are here to stay. Soooo pooeeeee from the USA."
"some Brazil stocks and special situations like GOL and Brazil in general will be an emerging market play soon, foreign investors like China and emerging interest from US will emerge as soon as the trade war rhetoric subsides - some will get in earlier then others depending on their risk reward strategies but GOL specific is the most interesting due to its volatility ie with both up and down but the rebound metrics here has great posibilties going forwards"
"Hi guys, where is Stephen the genius?"
"I am also pushing or asking really the CFO to market this company more to major institutions to help enhance she share value and to remove some of the fluctuations that exist thru bigger institutional holdings as well as asking one of the GOL analyst to ask the CFO to do the same to put pressure on them - if you dont ask you dont get resultsyes I own almost as many shares as Blackrock has in their GOL holdings report and I plan to see this back towards the $6.70 range when this temporary selling is over just remember the fundamentals of the company is improving that is why the buy rating from the analysts do your own diligence but IMHO I got this one right it went near $8 on my previous callthen $6,70 on my most recent although short of the $7.10 due to the currency dropbut IMHO we are headed next back towards $6.70 in the not too distant future"
"The fact that GOL is down has little to do with the SEC investigation and all with the strengthening of the dollar against the Brazilian Real and the new found political instability in Brazil regarding the upcoming presidential elections. There's some rumors that the Brazilian Supreme Court is trying to free Lula from prison and nullify his recent conviction, which would make him eligible to run for president again. The market, predictably, does not like that - hence the negative pressure on GOL and most other Brazilian stocks."
yes for the entire week just about every day share volume were shares short ie approx. 65% to 75% every daythat's why that short paid shill Nostra character showed up - there are about approx. 1.2 million short shares sold this week that now needs to be covered and they need you to sellthe last time this happened - it reversed up $ 2.8 dollars up the following monthI only expect $1.50 back up this time due to the election uncertainties - then after the election the big moves up IMHO will then occur
"Yesterday, this took off . It's going to pay in the long run."
"great recovery today, but I gave up on this..after summer in Brazil the numbers will go down"
I talked to two of the analyst for GOL and they both maintain their buy and $10 to $12 price targets and they said fundamentals are improving at GOL and that the currency fluctuation is temporary impact and no changes to their buy ratings or price targets this is a volatile stock - when it starts going back up - it will be the same way upIMHO
"I think it's time to go in. I have not figure out why this has dropped bellow the $6.00 mark. I'm spending this weekend looking at the fundamentals, all technical analysis indicates BUY."
"post election this will go up significantly and in 2019 even more as the Real will recovery significantly per ABN Amro:“In short, the real is currently under pressure but the central bank will counterbalance this move by increasing FX swaps and, ultimately, by raising interest rates. Later in the year (after the elections) we expect a recovery of the real thanks to decreased political uncertainty and a less negative external environment. We therefore maintain our forecast for the BRL/USD of 3.70 end-2018 and 3.20 end-2019.”"
Why is this heading down?????
IMHO GOL will be close to $8 more before end of this year and In the $10 to $12 range early next year close to Bank Of America and Citibanks price target and also Deustche Bank target as wellbe patient - GOL will come back stronger then everGOL is the SouthWest airline of Brazil - and become the dominant airline of Brazil iMHO
"ie most days volumes are 60% to 73% short volumes as traders are the ones selling mostly:The short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker GOL is 70% on Jul 10, 2018. The short sale volume is 130,482. The total volume is 185,832. The short sale volume percent is up 11% compare to Jul 09, 2018."
Breakout to $10 is coming real soon!
the 10 year support has always held except for the great recession -and only that coupled with a govt overthrow - now that they are in a recovery with 2.6% plus growth in GDP forecasted for 2019 just wait for the inevitable macro and political events to ease their way out plus the open skies agreement will have many years of additive accreditive earnings top and bottom linealways get it when the reward to risk is high and temporary risks make it an extreme value play IMHOthe risks will be removed over a short period of time and the recovery phase will ensue with share price to normalize back incremental closer to $ 6.50 to $9
"Althought I am out now, always is good to see GOL doing great. I think it will reach 10 by the end of year."
5 days ago i tould to buy
Ok folks I’m in long. I feel GOL will survive Covid-19 at this point. Huge upside with lack of competition due to Covid-19 induced bankruptcy’s. Am I wrong?
all this noise is due to SEC's new investigation. Nothing new from what GOL has seen in the past. The company is cooperating with authorities and has already paid $12M in 2016.
"my previous projection that we would be in the $6 range by mid July has occurred, the march to $ 6.50 continues and then low $7s will then be next IMHO be patient with GOL it will happen IMHO"
I'll keep buying
"the Brazilian Real to the US dollar will improve considerably in the next 6 months as the US dollar weakens later this year to the Real , oil will stabilize and Brazil will resume its 2019 2.6% plus growth - GOL will build a incrementally higher base to rise from higher lows , higher highs in a slow but steady fashion as there few sellers below the current price and only driven by some short term short sellers only - but GOL will see a steady rise into the rest of the year - the Macro picture will continue to improve - these are all the components that will continue to mend the GOL share prices back to a higher stabilization price - it wont be long before we wont ever see the 5s again this year - the share prices will be north of $6 plus for rest of year soon where the low end of the fair value resides based only on uncertainties and not future macros or micros of the companies operating efficiencies"
"what a great opportunity to buy in at this price, after the covid situation in Brazil normalizes I see this stock in the 12-15 range"
What app/platform do you guys use to buy stock? I am having a hard time to find a proper platform where i cnan buy GOL and Azul SA stocks.
GOL – Reports Aug total demand (RPK) +0.1% y/y and consolidated load factor was 76.9%.
I talked to both Bank of America/Merill Lynch and Citigroup GOL analyst and they both maintain their buy recommendations as of today and their $12 and $10 price targets for GOL this FX currency is a short term phenom and will stabilize itself back soonthe Brazil Central bank still has over $50 billion in reserves to help support its currency and did so during June this year IMHO
"GOL announces prelim quarter results ( looking good - drop in share prices unwarranted)check their prelim results announced - the data was so good they announced prelim results - that is a good sign going forwards and this despite all the political, truckers strike etc."
Seems to be holding $9 well. $10+ by the end of the year.
"Gigantic drop tomorrow ASSASAOS see the PR, SMILES will implode and GOL along with the proposed capital increases to merge smiles back into the GOL. WHAT A DISASTER. I WILL MAKE MANY DOLARES TOMORROW WITH ME SHORTS"

5% UP today. This article from ZACKS just came in today. You are still in time to jump in. AVG price target is somewhere between 8-10 USD. 50% UP from here.
USD to Real is near 4.05 in after hours as those short the currency are in panic modeGOL may hit $9 to $10 before end of this year IMHO
Bolsonaro will bankrupt this company.
Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes is up 6.63% to 7.40
"Which to believe? The story NPR story about strong customer growth or the Reuters story about hugh losses? I started following GOL when it was around $7. It dropped to $4.90 and I bought. I waited and followed stories about how this company has worked hard to keep up to date and cut fuel expenses. When it dips back down, I will buy more. The appear to know how to run an airline."
Looking out 6 months this company and the industry will be doing much better. Especially when international travel opens up for gol. Good time to take a position
"BRAZIL exports are growing, , politics are stabilizing, Brazil stocks are THE place for emerging mkts stocks ie the go to placeGOL will realize the growing domestic flight demand as a resultGOL will gravitate towards $7.10"
"Hey Nostra, is this you 15 days ago?""Nostra15 days agoJust as I gave an information for you, now the GOL will never see $5 again."""
Why is this so cheap?
"where's Nostra couldn't hear a while,"
"Both moderate parties said they would seek to strike an alliance with Rocha’s PRB, which has 21 congressional deputies and two senators. Following Rocha’s withdrawal, the PRB called for moderate parties to join forces.“There is a clear understanding that the country cannot flirt with extremes and therefore, more than ever throughout the process, it is critical that the centrist forces come together in a single plan,” the PRB said in a statement. by the way the story was published just yesterday late in the day - the picture of that candidate was taken back in april 2018 just FYI - yes its a very recent story of the positive elections developments developing just yesterday"
today Nostra disappear again Because chart is green
"shareholders equity is now negative 7.5 billion how do you value an equity where it has no net value to shareholders if liquidated, they are growing but do not produce positive net earnings to pay off their liabilities so as the real sinks and the economy dips any cash they generate disappear as fast as the Brazil real tanks - classic case of boom and bust cycle for GOL and they are headed for another bust cycle and lower equity value its a yoyo - ive learned not to try to sell at risng toops or try to catch falling knives thinking you got the bottom - trend indicates its about to break down south again IMHO, I rather sell when its going south and buy when its going up - finally I learned to follow the trend if the data warrants it use boht technical and fundamental and both looks bad again - so this is a sell IMHO"
Bought more. Double by end of year.
Why are Brasil stocks down today?
if it touches bottom again it could mean adding more shares.
Any thoughts on price in a week or two?
My target price is $.4460 USD
"Good news, in Brazil govt might purchase 100 million reais worth of tickets from gol. Not complete yet, but a possible strategy. Also, the 2 billion REIAS deal, not in dollars, is likely to pass during the first week of July. This was in the Brazilian news."
https://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/brazil/brazils-gol-airline-records-173-increase-in-demand-and-152-increase-in-flight-supply-in-july/
guys great news to reportI spoke to the company today and they indicated that they have reduced their capacity from 3% to 2% kind of like what USA airlines have done in the last few years to be able to fill more seats and make more money on each flightaccording to them their domestic demand is a robust +3% to +4% increase which is double their capacity increase and therefore has been able to recapture ie offset any cost increases thru their fare prices which resulted in their positive 2nd qtr and they continue to do so under the challenging macro picture - ie oil prices etc..therefore they maintain high liquidity and are able to make adjustments to operations as needed to ensure their success
"NOSTRA for the first time i am here you are right. A month ago you predicted that GOL will never see USD 5 again. You were right. Now is in the USD 6 area. Well... i know its not what you meant, but a broken clock get the right hour 2 times a day."
"Guys Fantastic News for the Real, the Brazilian stock market and GOL share prices - ie they are all headed uphill fast:Tonight the Brazilian courts barred LuLa from running for President of brazil !!!!!!!y Associated Press August 31 at 10:29 PMSAO PAULO — The Latest on whether former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva can be a candidate in this year’s presidential election (all times local):11:20 p.m.A majority of justices on Brazil’s electoral court have voted to bar ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from running in October’s presidential election, virtually ending his candidacy.After several hours of debate late Friday, four of the seven justices had voted against da Silva’s candidacy and just one in favor.

Gol I still sinking since Real at 4.0 makes it harder to pay dollar debt and buy jet fuel with dollars. Also hurts travel in an de out of Brazil. They could go under and have credit lowered again.
Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes is down 7.51% to 5.79
I haven't seen any posts here for a while. How are people feeling? Personally I'm a bit worried about the investigation from the Schall Law Firm. anyone heard any uplifting / good news abiut bailout money or otherwise?
"The reason of drop could be, that Brazilian market BOVESPA is down. It is on 6 month minimum."
my prediction that GOL will be in the 6 range by end of 2nd week of July and no later then endof July has high probability of being realized - the dynamics of the rebound is slowly developinginto fruition as the base is solidly formed IMHO
It's time to buy
Accumulating much more this month.
China will form alliances with Brazil in the future to buy and build up its natural resources - Brazil in turn will become the China of Latin America..the surge in Brazil assets will be HUGE in the coming yearsthey will start will going after Brazils copper assetsGOL airlines will be the SouthWest airlines of Brazil in a few yearsthey got a new fleet of the latest Boeing arriving this year and will be state of the art airline

Got me some.

"Was holding 30,000 shares, sold off 28,000. Waiting for a dip to RÉ enter : )"
I think that Bolsonaro will win on sunday and in the second round. GOL @ 10 by year end.
"Everyone is calling GOL junk. Again, there's certain situations that's affecting the airline industry world wide. High fuel cost. Look at the performance of the US major airlines, stocks dropped also. Go ahead, run away from this POS. That will make more shares available to BUY,,,P.S today OPEC is meeting and CRUDE prices are already dropping."
Great price to buy more
This just came in. More good news for GOL. Gol taps into the Mexican market with MAX 8 aircraft: Brasilia-Cancun in Jul-2019
"the problem in Brazil is they over grew the capacity in the last 2 years expecting a big economic surge now the load factors are dropping and costs will shoot up due to the tanking real, one big airline already went out of business , the rest of their airlines will now have hard times and their equity may go back down to 52 week lows again, it happens everytime their real and economy goes reverses course and this time is no different with the entire world growth now in distress -sell all Brazil airlines especially GOL that has a negative shareholders equity of 7.5 billion in neg equity , Delta tossed their partnership with them sept 2019 and sold the entire stake, this spells trouble ahead for GOL and that was before the Brazilian real hit within one cent of all time lows"
Building a solid base.
It amazes me to see how successful and free Americans are and most countries around the world refuse to become capitalist as well as adopt the same constitution.
Just bought another 2000 shares. I expect the price to double this time next year after their re-opening.
Is this good time to invest in GOL and/ or AZUL as prices are low n convinced me to invest huge buy confused....press if agree 
"you have to realize when you invest in Brazil stocks you have to realize and deal with the higher volatility that comes with it but this is where alot of the value in Brazil stocks lie as there is almost a 30% discount to world index emerging market stocks that have a 14% discount avg - Brazil stocks are a play on their consumers especially the airlines - all the trade war talks and strong dollar has hampered the recent recovery but that will soon subside - the best way to play Brazil is on the solid consumer demand stocks like GOL where it serves most of their market and as the world trade, dollar and political uncertainty will inevitably subside further and normalize there is a big rebound sequential recovery that will occur although some risks still remain due to oil prices look for $6.50 here and then possible an attempt at $7 but if you hold it long enough it will eventually approach $9 for those will the will to go thru the volatility that goes with Brazil stocks and this airline sectorpatience and resilience can pay handsomely here in both short run and longer run"
Airline stocks are up again today. We were left out yesterday hopefully today GOL will ride with all the other airline stocks.
Blackrock increased it's stake in Gol. News came out today. I have no position in Gol but am thinking about it now.
"Top Fund Managers initiate bargain buying in Brazil and South Africa with Overweights:Emerging market fund managers hunt for bargains after Turkey contagionDaniel LeussinkTOKYO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Turkey’s economic crisis has created headaches for investors and policymakers across emerging markets, but for some fund managers, it’s a chance to pick up a range of cheap assets, from Indonesian bonds to Brazilian equities.. . . . .Chuck Knudsen, a portfolio specialist at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, says Turkey gave him the opportunity to invest in assets such as stocks of private banks in Brazil and India, insurance companies in South Africa and China, and equities of internet and financial holdings in Russia.Knudsen said emerging market valuations, based on 2019 price to earnings ratios, have fallen to discount levels, compared with their historical averages and relative to developed markets.“Brazil and South Africa would be two countries today where we have overweights and that we like,” he said."
7%. Still doubts of the potential here?
"shorts continue to pile up on shares they will need to cover:The short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker GOL is 75% on Aug 30, 2018. The short sale volume is 180,865. The total volume is 241,153. The short sale volume percent is down -2% compare to Aug 29, 2018."
Bolsonaro has won the election. Not sure what effect it will have on the stock price.
74% of shares sold yesterday were short sales shares on Aug 22 - so no one is really selling except shorting
Not sure there are any investors on this board but We will see you at 12 By ChristmasHappy to see Gol back to March prices
"guys WHO is very familiar with OCGN as they have already visited the production site and accepted their quality standards, the wrap of of the review concluded on sept 10 India time which was last night , now they make the decision - we will know very very very soon - if the WHO chief scientist believes it will be approved by the WHO technical advisory committee who is to say it will not be - IMHO it was a matter of in August supplementing the additional data asked so they could complete the review by last night this time is the real deal ie the over promised but will be delivered results finally IMHO"
"I keep seeing folks stating that Delta owns shares of GOL. Doing my research I can't find that information. Brazilian economy is going thru hard times, this will drop bellow $6 and then back up again."
I like 1 million volume days in the positive direction.
Don’t sell now. Stay in for the long haul and you will be rewarded.
"GOL making a run, anyone have a target price?"
"Remind that the analyst has an avarage forecast of USD10 in a year, pesimistic see GOL somewhere around 8. Then, trolls see GOL heading to 0."
"I ewxpect a retest of the lows areounf $10 to $12 range as support breaks I expect alot bigger misses ahead , not only is the economy suffering and athey have a boeing 737 max problem but here is the deal for example Instead of reaping the benefits of lower crude prices, the real’s 24 percent plunge against the dollar over the past several months will swell the the overseas debt.Gol gets 87 percent of its revenue in brazll reals, while over 75 percent of its obligations are in foreign currencies. Concern the airline will struggle to pay its dollar debt will cause yields on its bonds to soar a few percentage points - as a result GOL from a buy in sept 2018 to a strong sell in Feb 2020 IMHO they lost their entire partnership with Delta and all other US carriers not good brace yourselves for a short attack once suspiciours posters show up soon they will strat the attack IMHO"
oil prices should weaken in the 3rd quarter driven by supplies higher then expectations but oil shortages may reappear in the 4th quarter of this year depending on the types of sanctions that appear and how much weaker demand is or notbut this month and next month should be good for GOL then after that things may get complicated depending on unknown Macro events - but this thru next month should be good size bounce for GOL IMHO only of course

Not good news. Delta needs to step in and show them how to run an airlines
"technicals are breaking down , I never used to believe in technicals and charts and boy when I realized that technical algos rule the direction of equity more then the fundamentals , I am a believer now and use both , I see GOL going as lower as $10 the new support but IMHO its marching there soon for many reasons I just posted below I was pumping up Brazil airline industry during their worst times sept 2018 during the elections and they shot up like rockets, my new re assessment is that in the short term the mass uncertainty will drive short sellers in and its the worst pace to be with the Brazil real hitting new lows against US dollar that determines the airlines profitability - ovoid or sell is my new reversal analysis - you have to know when to get in to make money and when to get out to avoid losses an they are coming IMHO Gol airlines is almost all real to US dollar based and when real tanks so does GOL airlines - its almost a side by side trend line real to GOL airline performance equity wise - kind of weird but amazingly true www.cnbc.com/..."
1m shares traded today which is a increase from recent weeks. I have a feeling this is going to start to take off.
Id love to see a quick debate between stephen and nostra
Undervalued airline stock
"It all depends on how expensive the fuel is going to be for Gol during the next following weeks. They just picked up more business from Taca airlines, so the potential for growth is there. They are good managing their business, but they were caught up in the middle of renewing their fleet with Boeing planes and maybe that is another emotional reason investors are pulling their money away. If they get cheap fuel they should be fine again I think."
"GOL did well during the truckers strike, they were solid in Aug and July with very tough comparables in 2017 - the trend in Domestic Airline growth is very solid and growing - fundamentals going forwards even better ( ie forget the shorter chop shops that come and go playing hysteria on a very solid fundamentally driven company with growing demand)here is the deal:If GOL can continue to do this well under trying times - imagine what GOL will do under the better times coming and with the headwinds about to be taken away with the Elections related climate going positive and eventual EM situation slowly improving and once gone and turns up - the amount of catalyst drivers and the opportunities that currently exist is enormousBrazil is the EM Latin favorite for a reason - as their exports will be increasing - which is the prime or best way to drive economic growth by exporting more so that domestic demand continues to growth and with it a faster placeBrazil is one of the few countries less affected by the current trade wars and with China looking for more natural resources in Latin America especially copper , soybeans, pork etc. Brazil economic rebound will be one of the best in Latin Americait could be like the last time Brazil came out of an Election plagued year with follow up economic boon renaissance in subsequent yearsif you have the guts to handle the current volatility - you get the 2x payoffs - it sounds simple beause that is the situation Brazil is in - high level payoffs for your abiity to handle itsame with Gol and the airlines - its a very high reward gutsy play that is winnable iMHO"
market cap too low. could this go to 4s?
Does anyone know what happened
If you want the article where the auditors say the company is no longer a going concern.https://valor.globo.com/empresas/noticia/2020/06/17/gol-pede-a-sec-mais-prazo-para-relatorio-auditor-ve-risco-de-continuidade.ghtml
"So rumors are that once the international airspace regulations are lifted, DELTA airlines will be buying out GOL. Load up your shares now."
"Gol is a very volatile stock , when it starts going up it sometimes goes up 10% plus in a single day - the opportunities far exceed any problems GOL has - going forwards its those opportunities that will be relevant and push GOL back towards $8 to $10 range again and possibly before end of this year IMHO"
"80% of shares sold yesterday were short sales meaning no one is really selling:The short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker GOL is 80% on Aug 28, 2018. The short sale volume is 400,378. The total volume is 499,948. The short sale volume percent is up 11% compare to Aug 27, 2018."
Both CitiBank and Bank of America reiterates GOL Buy Rating and maintains their $10 to $12 Price targets
"does anyone know how long the bndes credit decision will take? i read ""first week of july"""
GOL will seek bankruptcy protection before the end of the year....not to go out of business but to protect their fleet. Current shareholders may get burned badly. I think they will recover nicely 2 to 4 yrs out but very bad environment for them right now.
"The short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker GOL is 75% on Aug 23, 2018. The short sale volume is 336,554. The total volume is 447,890. The short sale volume percent is up 1% compare to Aug 22, 2018."
Gas prices going down.
Rotation from lockdown stocks into vacation stocks $UAL $GOL $BA
Brazil has the greatest opportunities and the least problems in all of Latin America - the turn up will be dramatic in the future and GOL will be one of those going up in dramatic fashion IMHO
Headlines: Airline Gol asked the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an extension for filing its annual report. The so-called 20-F form is mandatory for companies with shares listed on the American market. The company says it needs more time to complete an assessment and a review with independent auditor KPMG on the effectiveness of internal controls. Gol says KPMG found that the report on internal control “is likely to include one or more gaps” and a warning on continuity risk — when the auditor sees the survival of the company in jeopardy. The airline industry has been one of the hardest hit around the world by the contraction in demand due to the pandemic. Gol says it expects to deliver its 2019 report within the 15-day extension period

My avg is $8.08 currently
were headed to $7.10 guysas Ive said for two days - not much will stop it
"this situation not going forever, anyway start the all airlines flying, this stock very undervalued"
"folks, my technical calculations indicate due to the ongoing 60% to 72% daily shorting %, the short shares sold has far outstripped the available shares willing to be sold left and the shares are very prone to a mini squeeze by TuesdayGOL therefore will be back in $6 range by 2nd wk of JULY - be patient - a lot of people make money in these situations"
Azul and Gol reported August traffic! Gol up 84% year over year! And Azul 178% for the same period!
"Look at TSA figures - bookings going up - and earnings - also going up. Combine this with their increased vaccination rates, economy opening (especially with the commodity sector being rotated into, which always helps South American economies) and their summer coming in a few months and the price should boom! Anyone else see this as a buy?!"
Monday is a new month. I say this will be back $10 by 2nd week and then $15-20 by end of February.

"Wondering why GOL is dropping ? Sadly :BUSINESS NEWSAUGUST 27, 2020 / 3:04 AM / 4 DAYS AGODelta, facing its own troubles, may have to repay $300 million on behalf of Brazil's GolMarcelo Rochabrun5 MIN READSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) is facing a fresh Latin American headache as a Monday deadline nears for former Brazilian partner Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (GOLL4.SA) to repay a $300 million loan that the U.S. carrier guaranteed. If Gol fails to repay - which ratings agencies say is looking more likely - Delta would have to honor the debt on Gol's behalf, honoring the five-year-old agreement. But just like Gol, the Atlanta-based carrier, which said in July it was burning $27 million a day here has little cash to spare due to the coronavirus pandemic.Gol’s struggles are just the latest challenge for Delta, whose investments in Latin America, once seen as a growth area, have faltered due to COVID-19.Delta's 49% stake in Aeromexico and 20% stake in LATAM Airlines Group are at risk of dilution or being wiped here out as both airlines undergo bankruptcy restructurings.For Gol, Brazil’s largest carrier, the due date of the Delta-backed private loan comes amid a severe cash crunch. The loan was extended by unidentified private investors.“Gol is facing constant cash burn without refinancing possibilities,” said Amalia Bulacios, who covers Gol for S&P Global Ratings, which rates its debt as CCC-, at risk of default.By Monday, before repaying the loan, Gol could have just 1.6 billion reais ($285.19 million) left in cash, Reuters calculated. The calculation is based on Gol’s cash and cash equivalents, as well as its liquid investments, as of June 30, minus its expected cash burn of 3 million reais a day."
We have found bottom finally.
$8-$9 in 3 to 4 months.
The Fed in Brazil just announced they are buying shares of GOL and AZUL to support the companies here. Don't fight the Fed.
"Brazil is the largest country in Latin America. More than 200 million people. Take away $GOL and $AZUL then they almost have no airlines. Those two airlines will not go bankrupt, at least not in the next 5 years..By the second week to July these two airlines should be up 150% each. The market, stock brokers, impatient people who want to get rich overnight, angry people like creating fear. Did I mention that Brazil has a new Treasury secretary to oversee the Airlines stability as soon as possible?"
Gol Intelligent Airlines is up 19.54% to 7.77
"What's everyone's plan for this one? Hold, hold, hold?"
this is a very volatile stock but will stabilize at or around the $7.10 area going forwardswhere bounce backs will typically gravitate too
short term stabilization price of GOL approx. $6.50 to $7.50 as soon as the higher base building starts developingand after the elections $9 range is most likelyin longer term basis China will help Brazil return to higher digit growth and prosperityand the airlines are the first to come with it
MORE GOOD NEWS FOR GOL:* The real strengthens 2.1% to 3.9378 per U.S. dollar.* Bolsonaro leading for 10% (Market backs Bolsonaro).* The Bovespa Index gains 3.5%
Well I have options that after the summer pandemic in Brazil it will be a longer stretch but I believe(?) this stock in a year will be back in 12-15 range. If the country gets a handle on Covid. That is the X factor. I believe it is a well run airline. But what I don’t know is also the X factor.
"should I hold this stock tomorrow or I should sell it? Press  for “Hold”, press  for “Sell”"
Gol paid off the US 300 million dollar loan to Delta. That's a good sign. Let's hope that have solid cash.
"Earnings today, after the market closes."
14% up in almost three days. Just saying...
"Don't worry guys - the rampant forces of the Real speculators I call them drunken like sailors that have been targeting a $4.20 brazil real all year - and as I said before the central bank of Brazil would protect the Real against these speculators artificially trying to drive down the real , the brazil markets and the likes of those also artificially shorting GOL near 70% to 80% every day here is the deal by year end of this year the Real will return to normal or $3.70 next year end the real could be at $3.20 USD/BRL which would literally skyrocket GOL into the outer sphere ie $10 to $12 dollars and maybe a lot more here is the deal:Today, until 2:00pm Brasília time, the speculators trying to tank the BRL and depreciate it drove every EM currencies down and after that happened also the Argentinean central bank acted to protect the peso. at that same time 2.00 pm Brazil timer Brazils central Bank communicated a 1,5billion swap, other EMs came up along Edith the BRL.Yes as I have told every one before the Brazil Central would intervene to protect the Real from the speculators trying to damage the Real artificially to make moneyremember by year end GOL will rebound to $8 or more and early next year GOL will be close to the $10 to $12 price target of the 3 major brokerage firms Bank of America Citibank and Deutsche BankGOL order a lot of new Boeing state of the art panes just recently - GOL is becoming the SouthWest airline of Brazil - it will dominate in the future"
Buying as much as I Can For Long term!
