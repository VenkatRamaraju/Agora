looking for a good gain to start the week off. Oil is up and so is the DOW in futures trading. Could be looking at a $1.45 pps gain day.
$25.00 tomorrow
With the coronavirus in China bring the oil price down I think NOV will break below the $21.22 support soon.
"It appears to me that US is at Cold War II w China and Russia and the main tool is oil prices... so prepare for a ride. Before Iraq war we clearly saw end of oil, now we clearly see only horizon... meanwhile gasoline prices are same."
cmon NOV
Just like clock work....price dropped from the morning highs around 1130am and hovered through lunch time....and then retraced on a steady climb back up. Looking good!
Is NOV really that dependent on offshore that they need $80+/barrel to move the needle? This is painful.
"based on options prices, the bottom has been hit. from here on out it is sideways and up."
don't wait until this stock pops to jump in; I’ll just keep loading up here and sell them back later at a much higher price as usual
Rumor has NOV buying Denali fiberglass. Here is another fiberglass company they will ruin.
Do SOMETHING with the cash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"At $12.5 NOV is once again a BUY. As long as WTI stays above $50, the industry should recover nicely and so will NOV."
Y@hoo cheats with the aftermarket changes trying to create a panic among buyers and holders
NOV is down 4.93% to 21.60
This is crazy. What is the board of director doing? THEY HAVE TO CUT COST!
"Thanks to the big seller, low 15 teen was a gift. Searched all afternoon for news, never found any."
This should open up 10% on these earnings.
A very quiet board im seeing. watching this stock take off the last couple days. just wondering ones thoughts that has stayed long?
staggered. total blow out of EPS and revenue. Oil at $78 and this wont move. Should be touching 40.
Anyone listen to the conference call?
The plan is to try to cover the current backlog as incoming is exploding with demand.
I sold a quarter of my position at $17.7 - even though I do believe we will see $20+ before the end of the year. Just being cautious. Oil services stocks are now overbought - we were at $13 less than a month ago. If you are a long term investors you shouldn't care.
"facts are, NOV stands out in the energy crowd. can't be persuaded and should they even give back some dividend, that would cause my opin to change. meanwhile, you posters are all buyers. you're smarter than most. yeah, of course."
Certainly didn’t knock it out of the park

NOV reached a new 52 Week High at 45.73
Rumors of a buyout!!!!
When it hit's 52 week low I'm in
NOV is down 5.68% to 20.41
"Earnings will continue to improve as customers resume capital spending, but I believe a recovery will likely be a long and uneven one."
"This company used to be a fantastic investment. I've never seen it with earnings -$15.00 eps. I know there are some serious pro investors on this board. Please tell me, is this company going under?"
Heaviest volume of the year 90 mm shares including after hours. No news. Just index funds rearranging.
"Let's hope no news is good news, something must of been said on the call, I wasn't listening. Anybody that was please reply!"
"BAS (Basic energy services) The market cap of this company is mind boggling at 6.5mil with the stock trading at .29 compared to what’s its actually worth. Just the 860 million NOL (carry forward losses for tax purpose) would save a larger company like $SLB $NOV $BHGE 180 million alone plus the almost 60 million in cash and their water midstream unit is worth at least 350 plus million.They are expected to be cash flow positive this quarter of about 5-8 million which is the total market cap right now! Capex ex is minimal going forward. Never in my life have I’ve never seen such a disparity between market cap and what the company should be trading at and NOT a measly 6.5 mill market cap make ZERO sense. 850 million plus in revenues and been signing big contracts in last few weeks with oil rising Add recent sale of unprofitable biz between 40-75 mil which is outstanding, potentially another $3-5 mil buyback new CEO which is second to none in industry This should be $7.00-$9.00 Plus a share easy 1"
"If you can't short it, you better buy it! OR just watch it fly high! AMEN"
"Woooooow, what a turnaround from where it opened (and yesterday in AH trading!!). Must be combo oil down 3%, plus something they said on conference call."
"Why not a Buy out, at this price levels before it goes higher"
APA Apache oil and gas earnings soon bynd really cheap today zm
Well apparently for some fund manager $73 oil is not enough and they are willing to sell NOV at the same price it was when oil was at $40. Very heavy volume today so someone must have liquidated a large position - there is no news that I could find anywhere.
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Thetraderguide.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
"Bought another 1000 shares today at $12.84. Wish I could buy more - this is a gift, but have to maintain discipline in allocations."
"Look at the one year chart, beating thru the 50 day and 200 day moving average. Chart the high and low trend lines. Have a nice weekend !!!!!"
NOV should not be reacting to the price of oil each day. What a joke.The company is off and running now and drillers are drilling.
NOV reached a new 52 Week High at 41.84
this is going up!!!!
"NIce day for one of my ""hedges"" against paying higher prices at the pump!"
"At $13.86 NOV is back at where it was before last earnings and before the multiple upgrades. It is also back to where it was at the beginning of the year when oil was in the 40’s! Since the industry is still recovering and improving and oil prices are still high - which bodes well for capex spendings - this is a great buying opportunity, once again."
Nov has been lagging the industry despite having one of the strongest balance sheets out there.
NOV reached a new 52 Week High at 39.98
"Yes, nice pull back. Good luck to all new longs"
"Those who are selling didn't bother to read: ""The combination of $60+ oil, the continued recovery in the North American rig count, improvements in international activity, and the emergence of a number of our offshore drilling customers from bankruptcy is expected to lead to meaningfully better results in the second half of the year."""
"Between oil declining today and the shorter who are going to hammer this down I'd be cautious with the current PPS, inflated and comes down twice as fast as it goes up"
This stock just keeps falling. Will it ever rebound again?
"Strong sequential growth, adjusted EBITDA of $0.27/share, strong balance sheet and cash position, improving outlook and orders. What’s not to like when the stock is pretty much at the same price it was at the beginning of the year? Strong Buy! Still NOV is my top energy stock pick with the highest upside potential for the next 12 months!"
National Oilwell Varco is down 10.47% to 11.63
NOV is down 6.14% to 16.96
Oil up will move NOV up along with NG prices with all the bad weather.
$21 Tomorrow
"Oil just cruised over $60 a barrel, something is in the works !"
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Pick-stocks.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
Warned you guys...
Hard to beleive we have no one following this stock....NOV and BKR has quite of bit of upward room to move.
"Leap calls on oil are going up despite the industry sell-off. What does that tell you? No credible metric is buying the oil sell off, in fact they are buying future shares."
"Does anyone have any idea why NOV is up over 7% today? I'm not complaining, I just can't find any reason why. Thanks."
"How many companies do you know that amidst the worst slump in the industry's history, not only are not issuing debt / using additional financing, but actually using their massive cash flow to buy back their bonds? I think NOV's conservative approach to dividend payment and focus on improving the balance sheet is going to pay off big time one the industry recovers. Definitely one of my top picks - easily a triple from here ($8) when cv is history and the oil industry recovers."
NOV is down 10.11% to 9.42
"WOW! I can,t believe what a buying situation we have. I didn't think we would see 42 again, at this price and the pick up in oil production,$55 is not far away."
"We are looking goooood for Tuesday. The stock held tight, without a big huge drop going into the long weekend. If any oil related news happens on the weekend, stock will be ready to react on Tuesday. Much good news on the economy reopening in more locations will be in the news, and oil storage will likely show a bigger drop at Cushing on Wednesday via API or Thursday via EIA. People have more time to mull over stocks to buy for Tuesday, as well as institutional buyers adjusting portfolio's. I would be somewhat disappointed to not see NOV and BKR move higher. At least $13.25"
I am not sure how much value this management team is willing to lose without the board of director doing something about it. They are sure not working for investors. Too bad....
"I think the SEC needs to look into possible manipulation of NOV stock. The first item that I find interesting is that during the last 5 years while the company has been doing worse that most oil industry companies and the stock price has considerably consolidated, the institutional ownership in the company’s stock has reached 96%. Very surprising that these institutions would be so interested in this company which is doing poorly and I feel that they now as a group can control the price of the NOV stock. What does the SEC say about 96% control? Has the SEC looked into this control? Why don’t the institutions take NOV private? Secondly, why has the price of NOV stock not moved up like the rest of the oil industry during this market comeback? Last time WTI and Brent were at $70+ a barrel NOV was double the current price and then some? The company has to be getting massive increase in incoming orders as oil topped $40/$50/$60 a barrel and yet the Management of NOV has made no announcement about increased sales outlook to the public or the shareholders. The SEC should be asking why is Management being so quiet when most CEO’s are screaming this news from the mountaintops. The stock price is being suppressed… WHY?"
I believe an 11 year low.
Added some more at $11.25. I suspect the selloff is based on some short term nonsense. I look at 12 - 24 month time range and the fact that NOV generated $380 billion in operating cash flow in the worst quarter ever for the oil industry. You will easily see double from these levels if you just have patience and look at the longer term.
NOV is headed back to $60+ in the next year. If Venezuela gets squeezed out maybe $80. Lots of rigs will be updated or replaced.
11 year low
"If you are watching this today, the range is staying tight between $12.10 and $11.95 which is good. Over the holiday weekend come Tuesday, there will be good demand from oil being talked about and other good positive influences for getting the economy on track. Who knows I would not be surprised if the stock finished around $12.25 today. Then that gives me more confidence that come Tuesday ...we see it hit $13.00"
"I KNOW THE CEO KEEPS SAYING THEY WILL CUT COST BUT I JUST DON'T UNDERTAND HOW HAL A 23BILLION COMPANY HAS 60K EMPLOYEES AND SLB A 55 BILLION COMPANY HAS 100K EMPLOYEES BUT NOV A 9BILLION COMPANY HAS 34,220 EMPLOYEES"
"(Bloomberg) -- Gasoline demand surged to a a record high as Americans took to the road for the July 4th holiday weekend.Gasoline supplied, a proxy for demand, rose to 10 million barrels a day the week ended July 2, the highest in data going back to 1990, according to the Energy Information Administration.Demand has regained its footing as vaccinations and easing economic restrictions propel more Americans to resume their pre-pandemic lifestyles. Oil prices have risen almost 50% this year as U.S. refineries run close to full-bore to keep up with fuel demand. While the U.S. recovery quickens, the world’s largest oil producers can’t agree on how to supply the market with Saudi Arabia advocating for tempered supply increases given the potential headwinds that still exist.“Demand is bucking with the price spikes and summer driving, but with high gas prices and inflation, the picture in September may look different,” said Trisha Curtis, co-founder of PetroNerds.The moving average for demand also climbed higher, reaching the most since late 2019. But on a seasonal basis the figure was still about 150,000 barrels a day short of July 2019, suggesting the market still has some room to recover.U.S. motorists hit the road in large numbers despite contending with the highest gasoline prices since 2014.

#NOV in play. Target: 56.06 at stoxline.
Maybe I will wait for this to hit 12 or my third bite of the apple. What the hell is going on with oil now? What manufactured artificial nonsense problem is being used to drop prices across the board?
"New global oil discoveries are at 70 year lows. Oil companies are coming up far, far short of replacing the depletion they are experiencing out of their existing reserves. When this oil glut ends, it's going to end with a bang, and once it does, it's going to take years for new drilling to bring new supplies up and running to replace continued depletion. This glut is like water rising behind a cracking dam. The higher the water rises as the glut continues, the bigger the flood is going to be once it breaks. The longer the glut persists, the more a company like National Oilwell Varco will benefit once it breaks... and the break is inevitable."
been selling in the money puts for some good money. only problem is that NOV is not touted by any big firm.
"As the oil prices stabilize, we should see oil companies invest in capital equipment which should go well for companies like NOV."
chapter 11 on the horizon
"In the call, outlook for 3rd and 4th Q to decline. Hence the drop!"
still a huge miss. only good if oil recovers..
If we finish the year at a similar sp to the start of the year I feel the bear trend in the sp has ended so with all the chopping and changing within the organization I believe the sp has hit the floor and hopefully price of oil shall start on an upward trend in 2020 pulling the NOV sp with it lots of potential for the future.
"Bought yesterday and will buy more over time. Do me a favor next time you drive your car, or get something delivered, or run your electricity, or lather your hair with shampoo or pack the kids lunch in tupperware or apply mascara, etc, try doing it without oil and oil byproducts. We all work for big oil in one way or another. Buy while the hipster apocalypse has everyone believing in absolute rubbish."
"I made a ton of money buying NOV over the years, so when the price dropped I told my younger brother to buy it. That was at 42, he does bring that loss up a lot at family gatherings. Sorry bro."
I'm still waiting for a buyout.
Expect A Big Quarter Ahead From National Oilwell Varco $NOVhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4180369
"Another upgrade to buy, by Bank of America. This coming ahead of earnings means there are good things coming. NOV is dirt cheap too relative to other services companies. Load up!"
"Thought WTI was going back to 55 bucks. That looks unlikely at this juncture so just got back into good, old, NOV!! If I'm wrong about oil (could be if the dollar rallies, or if Venezuala starts producing again, or if frackers pump even more oil), then oil will collapse down to 50 or 55 bucks, and I double down on NOV. Can't lose, Can't lose!!!"
Earning missed expectations. Outlook dismal. Same old strategy to pump the price up during after hour and pre-market trading while the volume is light.
"NOV is one of the few energy stocks that has quite of upside left, just to catch up with its peers. It should be trading at $18 - $20, just to catch up in the short term, if oil prices remain stable around $60. I recently turned neutral and even bearish on some of the oil stocks that have overshot and become overbought/overpriced for this stage in the recovery. NOV is not one of them. Still bullish short term."
Where are the earnings?
Oil hitting yearly highs and NOV is consolidating???
NOV is down 25.89% to 11.62
"Yay, in the green!"
"National Oilwell Varco EPS in-line, beats on revenuehttp://www.seekingalpha.com/news/3328269"
"The 3 analyst who updated their view following the report, have an average price target of $15. So why are people selling at half the price? This market is crazy bearish - lost all connection to reality."
Every month 1 or 3 messages :) Hot stock :(
This company should finally come out strong in 2022. Time to accumulate now.
"Strong cash flow, improved balance sheet, increasing rig count - why are people even selling? This stock will easily be $25+ in a couple of years."
"I have voted Williams and, in fact, the majority of the board OUT each of the past three years as this once proud company continued to plummet. They continue to be there! WHAT ELSE MUST BE DONE TO GET THEM OUT??!! Do we need to go so far as to contact the SEC and other regulatory agencies to investigate them and intercede???!! They are LITERALLY FINANCIALLY DESTROYING SHAREHOLDERS WITH THEIR INCOMPETENCE AND INDIFFERENCE. This is BEYOND immoral and Unethical. SOMETHING MUST BE DONE BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!!!"
NOV is down 9.26% to 10.97
I continue to not understand NOV share price. They have an excellent balance sheet compared to competitors whose prices are sky rocketing. This is a very well managed company being punished for some reason.
Sometimes I think that I will never get out of this one. Been stuck with it tons higher. If I ever break even I will be thrilled.
Delete every one of them.
"I know a guy who knows a guy, that works at McDonald's in Omaha. He serves Buffet every morning. He said they had a conversation and he thinks Buffet is buying NOV."
I guess most people missed the fact that NOV was just awarded a giant Shetlands wind project.
STRONG BUY $NOV 12.33 / 11.43 . comming wave 3 Weekly
NOV is down 4.91% to $36.92
$12.9 is the same price NOV was at last year when oil was at $40... this is getting crazy.
Cowen raises price target to $16.
Been a roller coaster been making out on puts and calls on this one!
NOV is down 10.83% to $33.00
This is garbage! 3rd qtr result just released below 2nd qtr guidance. Not improved like HAL and SLB. High risk of its debts declared junk. Sell.
"You may not know this, but Bill Clinton is short MNKD stock.$amd $nvda $hmny $sny $nov $jcp $nbev"
"$1.20 away from $14 Not much distance. This stock can do it in 1 day...Looking to sell tomorrow maybe....bad thing is oil report will be out after 4:00pm and then in the am on Thursday for the EIA. Since this stock has been running erratic, but fairly predictable. I am thinking it could hit 14 and drop back. One of these days there will be a run up of at least $5 and I would hate to miss that. It seems like NOV and BKR are running in tandem. Kind of weird"
get rid of this stock
this is going up!!!!!!!
"Moving higher on heavy volume, couldn't find any news, not sure what is going on but I told you NOV has yet to catch up with its peers by going to $18 - $20. If we're lucky and it overshoots we may see $22."
That's hot. A 75% beat on earnings and a 3% beat on rev and the price falls.
Going back to March 18th on this stock look at the 3 or 6 month graph.....the lowest lows keep getting higher and higher. And the price swings throughout the day can be as great as $1 or more. Its impossible to not make money on this stock provided you watch it carefully and hit it at the right point.
There is an outside chance NOV will get delisted as TSLA gets enlisted. I guess it would be a changing of the guard and we're all about the cheap marketing stunt these days.
This stock looks like it wants to break out...
graph had been looking solid. let's break through $50
"Management change needed urgently! I have spent years analyzing companies and can tell you with certainty that NOV's cost structure is way out of whack. the stock is at a multi-year low yet management shows no urgency to implement the hard changes that need to be taken. The board of directors needs to do its job and fire top management and replace them with guys who are filled with bs! Urgency needs to be shown yesterday, yet we keep getting a bunch of nothing! If the board of directors cannot act quickly on this, then we need to replace the board of directors. It's that simple. this used to be a viable company, but not anymore. With facility consolidation and a 20% headcount reduction, we can bring the cost structure back in line and return this company to meaningful profitability. I understand that the market is a bit soft for their products right now but that notwithstanding, this company should be consistently profitable. Management is getting fat and happy on our dime. Time to throw them out!"
NOV and FANG are coming back strong. Keep going!
NOV is down 5.39% to 21.96
"For an industry that has been increasing demand steadily for the last 7 months and whose price has been increasing for the last 7 months, it's strange that NOV and oil and general would be so volatile."
They shook a lot of weak hands out. Watch as they run this back up into $29 the next few days. The institutions playing amateur investors like a fiddle on this one.
NOV to Buy Diamond Offshore Merger ALERTS
So I googled hurricane stocks and NOv made big gains last hurricane. Is it hurricane season yet?
In the last 3 days nothing has changed for the worse and yet oil has been dropping consistently for weeks. It's all so juvenile.
"wow , now thats a lot of loss"
"Oil is now at a 3 year high, up 60% ytd, yet amazingly NOV still trades at the price it did when oil averaged $40 last year, before the recovery. It’s just a matter of time before it does a catch-up with its peers. I don’t know what the catalyst will be - either an earnings report or reinstatement of dividend but it can easily move up 50% and still be considered undervalued."
I am sick of all the plugs for awesome stocks and the other bull s!!! posts of people who are promoting these sites. Yahoo should every one of them. Free advertising for this #$%$.
"This professional portfolio manager is very excited about $NOV:""We recently took a position in National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:$NOV), which is a provider of capital equipment for oil and gas exploration. And National Oilwell Varco has really been consolidating the industry over the past decade-plus. They are really the one big player in a couple of other end markets, and one of those is rig technologies, which is really equipment packages for offshore and land-based drilling rigs.""https://www.twst.com/interview/taking-the-emotion-out-of-the-investing-process"
"You have a double from current levels ($15) if you are just patient enough. Last time oil was at $73 NOV was at $40. Do I think it's currently worth $40/share? Of course not. But with capex budgets increasing and oil holding steady above $60 for another year, we may see big gains in this stock later in the second half, as companies catch up with their spendings and resume projects they have been delaying because of covid. Combined with leaner oil companies we may have even higher profitability than before."
"mindful, NOV doesn't do divs as long as no payouts keeps their shirts on NOV's back. investor shirts, well that's another story. grasp fact newb, buying oil patch is dicey, and especially now. buying the patch and not even earning a dividend for the very risky long hold, is bonkers. comments here are for amusement only."

"HOUSTON, July 27, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NOV Inc. (NYSE: NOV) today reported second quarter 2021 revenues of $1.42 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to the first quarter of 2021 and a decrease of five percent compared to the second quarter of 2020. Net loss for the second quarter of 2021 was $26 million, or 1.8 percent of sales, which included pre-tax net charges (""Other Items"", see Other Corporate Items for additional detail) of $15 million. Adjusted EBITDA (operating profit excluding depreciation, amortization, and Other Items) increased sequentially to $104 million, or 7.3 percent of sales."
NOV is up 4.96% to 22.45
NOV is down 15.23% to 8.63
NOV has the kibosh on it and I have no idea why. It is one of the few exceptionally well run oil industry companies. They never let their balance sheet bloat the maay most do. Strange that the market has decided to punish them.
"Bought back yesterday at $17. The reasoning: all major oil services stocks are trading at pre-covid levels: SLB, HAL, BKR. I personally don't think that any of the services stocks should trade at pre-covid levels when business is quite far from pre-covid levels, but this is a relative value play. That means if we are to catch up to their valuation, NOV should be trading at $20+."
"Last time oil was at this level, NOV was way higher. What is going on?"
still my #1 garbage stock. Sell the company to one of the big boys.
"NOV is a roller coaster special. Big ups, big downs. But more downs than ups."
Down 20% ? Real ?
Better load up while it's below 40
"How ridiculous is NOV at $14.5 and why people who are selling / not buying are going to regret?1. The most recent analyst price targets were $18, meaning a 25% upside from current levels. And those price targets were set 2 months ago when oil was in the mid 60's. Since then a lot has improved.2. NOV is more or less is at the same price it was in January, when oil prices were in the 40's!3. Last time oil prices were in the 70's NOV was at $40. It may not get there this year but as long as the recovery continues, this is a realistic price you can expect in 1-2 years, when the industry is fully recovered. I added more today at $14.6. Fully loaded."
The management needs to cut cost or this stock will stay at this price for years to come! If they cut cost the stock would be much higher at this point in the cycle.
"earnings today. I'm not particularly confident. We won't see the big moves for two quarters yet, but if the market is future looking then it should continue to accelerate the price increase. That being said, another bad earnings report and we are back 9 dollars a share."
Do SOMETHING with the cash.
"I am looking forward to when the pendulum swings back to normalcy here in America, when the police are told to ""do whatever you need to do"", and BLM and Antifa are relegated to the dustbin of history.#Nov 3rd#Trump2020"
"$11.9 - who would have thought the crazies would take this stock to the same price it traded last year, before the recovery and when oil prices averaged $40?"
Overbought. I can still see my message here from less than a month ago when NOV was at $8. Now at $14 it is 75% higher. Congratulations longs. Long term still looks good however short term most oil stocks are now overbought. The effects of the vaccine on the bottom line will take at least a year. Between now and then we have at least 2 more bad quarters for the oil industry.
Looks like they want to run this back up into the $29 range this week. Institutions wanted your shares CHEAPPPPPPPPPPP
"good report, much improvement over last quarter. on the way back."
Will the bleeding continue?
NOV will start moving soon as all these rigs are starting to fall apart and need new parts.
NOV is up 4.96% to 44.63
"management owns less than 1% of this company. why is that? why did management get 100% bonuses last year? the annual meeting is next tues may 28th. if you want to see what a fat and happy board of directors looks like, then attend this meeting. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! they are using the company's piggy bank and stock to enrich themselves while taking on no risk themselves! UH HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM! BLACKROCK, get off your rear end and start putting pressure on these guys. there needs to be some urgency here. compare the cost structure to their competitors and you will be astonished at how out of whack NOV's is."
I think this company has finally has turned the corner. 2022 is the breakout year!
So it took oil to go to a 7 year high (up 70% ytd) and a one year recovery so that NOV would finally be up a whopping 3% YTD!
arrrgg. is this ever going to make the leap back to actual value?
10 year low - ouch!

"BASX (Basic energy services) The market cap of this company is mind boggling at 6.5mil with the stock trading at .29 compared to what’s its actually worth. Just the 860 million NOL (carry forward losses for tax purpose) would save a larger company like $SLB $NOV $BHGE 180 million alone plus the almost 60 million in cash and their water midstream unit is worth at least 350 plus million.They are expected to be cash flow positive this quarter of about 5-8 million which is the total market cap right now! Capex ex is minimal going forward. Never in my life have I’ve never seen such a disparity between market cap and what the company should be trading at and NOT a measly 6.5 mill market cap make ZERO sense. 850 million plus in revenues and been signing big contracts in last few weeks with oil rising Add recent sale of unprofitable biz between 40-75 mil which is outstanding, potentially another $3-5 mil buyback new CEO which is second to none in industry This should be $7.00-$9.00 Plus a share easy."
"Another 52 week low. Fire management, it sell the company. No shareholder value"
NOV GAPPING HIGHER TAKING OFF
"I think the new tax law impacted NOV's first quarter. The new tax law allows immediate expensing of capital equipment purchases, effective January 1st. If companies were thinking about ordering equipment from NOV in November or December, they obviouslywould have held off to see if they would have gotten a way bigger tax deal in 2018, and they did.So, if orders from November/December were pushed to January/February, NOV wouldn't have had enoughtime to build that equipment and book it as revenue in Q1. I also think those delays will just add to pent-up demand and compound the orders into 2018. Indeed, NOV's CEO characterized the dearth of revenue as a temporary thing, consistent with what I'msuggesting."
"Even during the most horrendous quarter for the oil industry, NOV generated $380 in operating cash flow! That bodes very well for the future when the industry recovers. NOV is on my list of stocks that will double within 1 -2 years. I recommended it when it was trading at $12. Additional potential doubles: HP, BP, PBF (the latter I recommended a smaller than average position because of its leverage and higher risk)."
"you want another Big Oil stock check out reconnaissance energy Africa LTD. Junior oil company has 8 million Acres over in nambia own 90% And just prove their first well. I made $50,000 off of it in less than a year."
"I was speaking to a trader this morning, things are too quiet for gold. A woof in sheep's cloathing. America has the last word on North Korea."
"this has to be one of the most hated oils out there. none of the upside, all of the downside in the oil soap opera."
NOV is up 4.94% to 38.04
"Please sell the company, make an aquisition, or raise the dividend. I'm officially sick of being a bag holder."
NOV is down 11.68% to 8.32

NOV reached a new 52 Week High at 42.69
"the weak first qtr is already in the stock. the stock is greatly lagging the recent upturn in oil from $50 to $60. This stock is about to pop big time. 1st qtr conference call is going to be very bullish. NOV has a great balance sheet, is buying back stock, and has a great opportunity with Saudi Arabia that will begin to ramp up big time as the year progresses. The stock is being left for dead but the fundamentals have already turned. it's classic Wall Street. buy it on the cheap today!"
This stock is soooo predictable...it hits a newer high and rolls right back down into $1150 - $12.50 range...
"What is it going to take to push this stock up? I mean seriously, oil is high? WTH!!"
I gave up. Bot at 50 mid '15.Finally dumped it Friday.Thanks for the write off.
Finally!!! Let's hope it's finally turned the corner and heads back up above $50
"On December 31 2020 NOV closed at $13.73. Oil was around $47. Today oil prices have increased by 50%, capex spendings are ramping up, NOV indicated that they see meaningful better results during the second half, yet the stock is at $13.57 as of today. Does it make sense? No - in the short term the market can be irrational. However, NOV will catch up at some point and move to $20+ where it belongs. You can't hold this stock down forever - it has a solid balance sheet and I predict it will resume paying dividend early next year, which will take the stock to mid 20's."
the stock is at a decade low and yet Clay Williams got paid $13.8 million last year. anyone have a problem with that? punch up a long term chart and see if you can come to grips with the shareholder destruction that has occurred while this management team has been at the helm.
Moving up on heavy volume. It looks like the entire selloff a week ago was meant to shake some retail investors and get their cheap shares. We're going to be $20 before the end of the year. NOV is extremely undervalued under any peer / historical comparison.
still nothing from this lousy board of directors! And now the math has changed again for the worse with the price of oil down 5%. wonder what they are waiting for? we need activist investors to throw this board of directors out restructure the company. the cost structure is insane!
"Patient investors might find BOARF of interest at its current price. SEI Investments holds 275,000,000 sharesper Yahoo ""Holders"" column."
what's wrong with this pig?
"Nice move up today, I hope we see more of it tomorrow!"
Fred sander where’s earnings
This stock is permanently disabled and will never recover imo. it will forever hover around the mid teens
NOV is up 4.94% to $36.85
21 hours ago someone wrote that this stock will pop out... and it will be big time. Thanks man. :))) You should be ordained as priest.
"The analyst had his so-wrong with X, and are still trying to predict lower ESP. Buy, SLB, and NOV are going to be popping, could squeeze"
Most bizarre selloff on low volume. Many oil stocks gave back two months worth of gains in 2 days. And that's despite the fact that oil prices held above $70. Looks like a buying opportunity to me. The recovery in the oil sector will continue.
Weather and covid are temporary. Use the dip to buy more. $20+ before year end. There is a lot of pent up demand for NOV products/services due to low spendings in 2020.
"Sandor, are you buying yet?"

Folks appear to be waking up to the fact that $70 oil is here to stay for the foreseeable future.
"Here are the results of the OPEC agreement today:They have agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels a day, beginningin January. Translation: They will be producing like a bat-outta-hell all through December. There are no provisions to ensure compliance. Translation: They'll all produce whatever the hell they want to producebeginning in January.Every ""cut"" that OPEC has ever enacted has been followed up on withreports estimating how much they're all cheating on the cuts. EVERYTHING that OPEC does is designed to jawbone oil prices higher.Show me one time that OPEC has ever actually cut production, aside fromthe late 1970s, and I'll eat my gas cap."
"18 Million+ shares on the buy side, $58 target seems low. Can't wait for the rig count!!!!"
NOV reached a new 52 Week High at 46.48
Fire the board and CEO. Sell this company now.
"Big Volume yesterday, up on a day the market too a beating. hopefully a continues uptrend into the 50's. Looking for a great earnings report with an increase in the backlog orders"
"Sweet Jesus, they finally announced a share repurchase of $500 million in Nov 6th. Finally!!!! At least it's something."
NOV reached a 52 Week low at $30.20
oil has breached 80. Nov trading as if it's 40. Crazy how such a well run company is punished for no reason other than pantomime.
"Morgan Stanley upgrade. The last holdout finally admitted that NOV is ridiculously priced. The Morgan Stanley analyst is know for his conservative price targets, gave NOV $18 pt. Mine is $25 within a year."
Great buying opportunity going to 30.00 within 90 days
"***** has anyone heard any rumor about results in the field for the E-FRAC system with their partner, NEX?? Should have results by now........maybe they will save it for the next conference call....*****deepsub"
"Nice upgrade today by Barclays, pt raised by $6 to $18."
NOV reached a new 52 Week High at 48.98
"If this goes below $20, is there a law about mailing poo to the board of directors, attn. CEO?"
"You want to be long NOV when dividend reinstatement is announced. It will take the stock to $20+ to catch up with its peers (the reason it's trading so low is just because of dividend in my opinion. NOV is not doing fundamentally worse than its peers). I believe it will be first quarter next year, but if this quarter is strong, it may be as soon with earnings announcement for this quarter. Either way, you want to be long and wait patiently."
"From Simply Wall St., Executive Summary:REWARDSTrading at 28.4% below our estimate of its fair valueEarnings are forecast to grow 105.42% per yearRISK ANALYSISNo risks detected for NOV from our risk checks."
"Starting to peruse nov. If,when, and doubtful, however, and After first tranche, will post. prematurity will slap you here. belief that usual comments here may bear fruit, is nonsense."
NOV is down -5.33% to 38.74
Look at the Normalized EBITDA on the financials. This company was in trouble long before Covid.
got a long way to go back to $40
"I must be The only bag holder. This has broken the old low, I think we may test, or come close to the low at the end of the energy crash. This completely sux!!"
When u see a company hire back their landscaping people after a downturn then u know...happy days are here again 
I told you...
"$700 million in FCF in 2020 - that's the takeaway number from the earnings report. That means that in the worst year for the industry on record, NOV generated $700 million in free cash flow, a number that will only grow as the industry recovers over the next year. That means improved balance sheet, improved liquidity and financial and operational flexibility. NOV is currently trading at around 7 x FCF - dirt cheap."
"Just bought back into good, old, All American, no nonsense, NOV!! I've been waiting patiently for a bottom to form. Dollar appears to have more weakness going forward and oil looks like it want to continue to rally. NOV has a nice chunk of King Cash on its balance sheet. Stock is worth a minimum of 35 bucks. Nice entry point today around 27.30."
"Sell the Company to a dividend paying company. This is a bag holders turd of a stock, and I'm tired of holding it at a loss."
why the big drop afterhours?
"Don't let them fool you into selling. At $13.2 NOV is the *only* oil stock that has a potential to double within the next 12 months, even if oil prices just remain at current levels ~$60. It is dirt cheap and there is large pent up demand for its products/services, which will materialize later in the year. Mark my words: NOV @26 in a year, if oil just remains around $60. None of the other stocks that I follow will double, even those that I highly recommended in the past. For example, HP and SLB will not be at $54, HFC will not be at $70, BP will not be at $49. The only other stocks with a double potential is PBF but that is a very high risk/reward stock, unlike NOV which has a strong balance sheet and generated $700 million in FCF last year, despite the worse year for the oil industry. Load up right here around $13."
I’m baking up the truck at $0.50. -0.05 EPS last I checked. OTC NOV. Here we come.
i reckon this will be back within a few months.... I hope
NOV reached a new 52 Week High at 47.89
Another reason YAHOO finance target prices are not worth the paper they are written on.
NOV is down 5.27% to 22.91
Hopefully this is a start to take us to new all time highs.....
