"Any reasons? Why NOV down, but all oils are up today （10/25/2021)"
staggered. total blow out of EPS and revenue. Oil at $78 and this wont move. Should be touching 40.
"Disappointing. On the other hand, the stock is pretty much unchanged ytd, so you can say much of it is reflected already in the stock price, which lagged the industry by a wide margin. Still, 2022 should be a strong year, finally. The book to bill ratio is a good forward indicator."
"I am fairly certain in years past NOV made most of their profits from offshore rigs. Offshore has not come back yet for it is expensive compared to onshore production, hence the poor earnings report. Having said that offshore will come back if oil prices stay high. I am optimistic about NOV's stock price rebound starting the 2nd half of 2022. I am buyer on any dip."
So it took oil to go to a 7 year high (up 70% ytd) and a one year recovery so that NOV would finally be up a whopping 3% YTD!
"What is it going to take to push this stock up? I mean seriously, oil is high? WTH!!"
I guess they'll have to post even bigger losses if we want this stock in the 20's...
When u see a company hire back their landscaping people after a downturn then u know...happy days are here again 
Green??? wth?
"Ahead of earnings - I believe now the odds of div reinstatement this quarter to be low - even though that would be a nice surprise. On the other hands, earnings should indicate continued recovery and growing pent up demand for products/services. With oil in the 80's, I will be buying more on any dip. NOV is trailing all its peers by a large margin, so a good earnings report will take it to $20 in the next couple of weeks."
"Oil is now at a 3 year high, up 60% ytd, yet amazingly NOV still trades at the price it did when oil averaged $40 last year, before the recovery. It’s just a matter of time before it does a catch-up with its peers. I don’t know what the catalyst will be - either an earnings report or reinstatement of dividend but it can easily move up 50% and still be considered undervalued."
Heaviest volume of the year 90 mm shares including after hours. No news. Just index funds rearranging.
"You want to be long NOV when dividend reinstatement is announced. It will take the stock to $20+ to catch up with its peers (the reason it's trading so low is just because of dividend in my opinion. NOV is not doing fundamentally worse than its peers). I believe it will be first quarter next year, but if this quarter is strong, it may be as soon with earnings announcement for this quarter. Either way, you want to be long and wait patiently."
"I sold yesterday most of my NOV shares and sold 15 covered calls on the rest. The fact that after a full year of recovery in the oil services business, NOV managed to post worst results than same quarter last year, says a lot. And it was no doubt terrible. In fact, they should have published an earnings warning. As I consider the reinstatement of dividend in the foreseeable future to be remote (and even if they do, it's going to be at most $0.05/qtr), I view the buy level to be around $12, which is where I'll consider buying again. Sorry guys, I hope those who stay long with a lot of patience eventually get rewarded, but for me, that was the last straw."
Well there you have it folks. No chance of getting back to $20 anytime soon
oil has breached 80. Nov trading as if it's 40. Crazy how such a well run company is punished for no reason other than pantomime.
What a shame. Losing faith in the leadership of this company.
Down 20% ? Real ?
"I took them at their word, when they said not long ago ""we expect meaningfully better results in the second half of the year"". Yet they did even worse than 3rd quarter last year! Given the results, I don't expect dividend reinstatement until the second half of next year, if that. Hard to believe that only 3 short years ago this stock was in the 40's."
I am staying far away from NOV - It looks like it is going to drop off a cliff. I actually get way better stocks at http://alert-sounds.com/
