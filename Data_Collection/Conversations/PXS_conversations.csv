"Remember these names: RYON, HAROLD,.....NO CREDIBILITY!!!"
$DCIX $TOPS $PXS $ANWWQ $GLBS mess with the Greeks and hold a heavy bag a year if not bankrupt!
Glad I sold yesterday at $2.95!
so they are issuing another 2 million shares of this on Friday....check the news release.
2.50 tomorrow
Why can’t I buy this online
What happend today?
"By the day PXS IPOed, its CEO Eddie Valentis has followed the same strategy about the stock: He never diluted at a lower price and never made a reverse split. Mr Valentis prefers to drive the stock price above $1 to meet NASDAQ requirements than do a r/s. Additionally, they have a mixed share offering running, but the shares are redeemable at $1.40. Another reason for the stock price to spike.So, it is very likely that PXS has a 25% minimum gain to offer until the end of this year. The bonus could be a higher spike above $1, like every year has happened during the second semester."

SHIPPING STOCKS GOING TO RUN TODAY AGAIN! GET IN FOR THE RIDE!
y'all I would sell now
There she goes
https://ceo.ca/bes
Go on Reddit and post ppl. Spread the word. PXS_stock
it's very volatile right now.
This guy is a very disciplined day trader. He mentions PXS @7:15 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_S2w7RUj4A&feature=youtu.be
Looks like ship got wrecked with iceberg
"OK this is looking like a buy signal. if it crosses above 12, buy with your life savings and sell at 15"
"with DCIX, it was going up 50%, down 15%, up 50%, down 15% and so on. From $12 it's at $10.22 s that's about 15%. it'll go back up"
wow the go wild today.
Monday will open below $2.00
@jose most free screeners are delayed and have limited information. i use e*trade pro and it can show stocks that are moving as it is happening in real time. it’s not cheap but it’s worth it to have good software
Couldn’t short
Any clue about the reason for yesterday's price jump?
I’m buying again at 10.45 hopefully goes up to 15
ready for end of the month run
I think you should buy GLBS

this is a buy at 4 dollars. It will pump again
Well that was fun while it lasted
13k..profits
dam i shouldve bought this when i saw it hovering at 5.5
R they still trading?
"A lot of pump and dump schemers commenting here.. It will not go to 10USD, but if you want to lose your money then go right ahead.."
$GLBS $PXS $DCIX $TOPS big pumpers really getting Greek'ed as the BDI keeps on plunging.https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/baltic-dry-index-falls-to-1009-down-55-points/
Another run? I'm shook
Going
$PXS TO 3$ NORMAL
come on in... the water is warm

"The last high was around 12. If it gets to 13, trust me all momo players will push this to 20"
hahahahahahaha traded for a second and price went to 10.45
"for the newbies out there, basically how I made a killing on DCIX was each time it went above the high, I would buy and then sell later, and keep repeating."
Come one lambo
Going to 20
Trap
going to 8 dollars yesssdd
KR is on the move today
common stock offering...gonna tank
This is sky diving
Wondering if now is a good time to buy. ER coming out nxt week.
"Feedback anyone? Thought I was late in at 2.55, but apparently not..."
"Nice so far. If it holds 6, I'll sell half at the open."
I really wish I found this guy sooner. My market knowledge has increased 10fold and the stock tips cant be beat. https://thestockmarketnews123.blogspot.in/
"Up 12% after hours. Gonna jump today, just a question of how much."
One more round tomorrow?
TOPS is next
High for shorting. Make money 1000% down
its going to 20
I think it will go upto 400% and drop back again like most Greek shipping companies did in November
Is there any way to know what stocks will be pumped in the future or is it just luck?
Should I short?
long here!
"Is it a ""I am not the last one"" game?"
Dam it !!! Sold too soon!!
Short position anywhere from 8+ will make a lot of money this stock is still worth what is was 3 days ago.$5 or under close

TOMORROW.. high hopes for shipping tomorrow
PRIVATE PLACEMENT AT $2 PPS...SHORT NOW FOR$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Todays update. #SOS killed it today. AH runner will continue moving into weeks to come. Strong Buy. TRADE WATCH. For this next call. $PXS Hot to watch. Spiked to 4.60 on large volume before close. Back down After Hours. 3 million float. Oil Tankers. Shipping making some moves. Could drive up fast PM and before close. Might be worth a postion.
Nobody panic everyone hold
"Just look at the chart. This will likely show its true intentions after market open tomorrow. Good financials and low volume means that previous pops on the chart are absolutely possible. Definitely a buy until 2.15. Then, hold until high 2s before a sell-off happens. If your on the edge or want to buy, buy before mid tomorrow."
See what happens at 7$
"The difference between $PXS and other shippers like $TOPS $GLBS, $SHIP etc, it is that PXS can spike with just $500k to $1 million, while all the others need $3 to $10 million to react. Beyond the fact PXS in not a dilution machine and haven't made any r/s, like them."
$STGG!!! Went up %8000 yesterday and went up another %250. I Bought in at .70 and sold at 2.40 already.
Want it again but probably missed
Appropriate this company has 'tankers' in it's name.
i need it to bounce back to $3 again
it makes me wonder what boiler chat room operation signals out 1 name and has the power to pump it 330%--amazes me
"Private placement at 2 just announced. Why is it trading at 90 percent premium to offering price? Will go below $ 2, or the private placement price once the tax loss selling is done."
Monday PXS will easily take out Friday's high. Look at the volume. This is no joke.
OBVIOUS STOCK PRICE MANIPULATION SCAM MEANT FOR THE FINANCIAL BENEFIT OF THE PXS PRIVATE PLACEMENT SHAREHOLDER WHO JUST GOT THEIR $2 PPS SHARES TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!https://www.fbi.gov/tips
The halts are triggered AUTOMATICALLY because of the fast price jumps within seconds.
as high as 6.52 in premarket!
I would pick up more. Maybe 2000-3000 more sub 1.50
in @ 6 out at 11.89
"1000 shares at 4.73, i have a feeling its going to jump up over $6/share tomorrow morning"
"If it goes above 12, thats a buy signal. Otherwise, sell and save yourself."
is that the end ....
Do you realize this company only has 4 legit ships and they're working in a sector with low rates?
Crash
"Two months ago when it was 3.6 I told you why it was way over priced, above the private placement price thus unsustainable. 16 Days ago when it opened at $2, I told you to sell and it will go down to $ 1.25, and it did. Now that the markets are in a topping mode I will not buy it at 1.25. This stock will retest its 52 week low below $ 1 and I suggest you nibble for a technical rebound at $ 1. That is where I will enter. If there is a significant market correction, watch out, it could register a new low at .75 .80"
93% inside ownerships
$TOPS amazing how there's a seemingly endless supply of willing bagholders to supply the Greeks with shiny new fleets of ships $DRYS $NEWL $FREE $PRGN $DCIX $PXS
Hold it it will make you happy next week going to 3
already up 21% premarket and still 3 hours left until the open.
What causes a halt
GLBS no one listened
"Tanker rate slump is here, as predicted. VLCC rates are already down y/y and floating storage unwind hasn’t even really hit yet. See new FreightWaves article for latest tanker rate info and analyst comments: $NAT $FRO $INSW $DHT $TNK $TNP $STNG $ASC $PXS $NNA $TOPS https://www.freightwaves.com/news/supertanker-rates-nose-dive-the-dam-has-burst"
I bet you they're waiting for people like Austin to short so they can accumulate. Just watch. They'll push this up so fast shorts will fuel the rally into the $20s hehe
Here we go!
spot rates have quadrupled
That’s a great buy 1.65-1.85
I stand by what I said. I think the crooks are loading up and all the panic sellers and short sellers are hitting their bids. They're about to run this up big time.
Gonna go above 10 today. Wouldn't be surprised if this copies DCIX
Wow ... this thing was a rocket at the end !! need more big jumps like this !! 
go ahead and pay $5.00 for what others are paying only $2.00https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyxis-tankers-inc-announces-4-135107248.html
9 to 5.58 in5 minutes..fresh bagholders
sold at $7.67 for +30%. probably going higher though
It could reach to 7.50 by tomorrow due to positive news related to Rig.
"Business has picked up, uses US for most of business , I think we go to 20.00."

"Hold it, it will reach 4 soon."

"At 1 million float, it's going to 20+ like DCIX"

this thing is gonna surge when all these shorts take their profits and get out before the weekend.
Pop goes the bubble

$ESEA longs should team up with the $PXS $GLBS $ANWWQ bagholders to pump $DCIX next.Never mess with the Greeks! Anchors away waiting for the next offering!
I'm out after my final trade. Jumped in on the drop to 8.9 and out at 9.4. This is too crazy.
ok now I'm out at 11.35 :) Made $5K
"Product tanker market braces for ‘supercycle’A price war and demand destruction because of the coronavirus pandemic have sent oil markets into a whirlwind during the past two months. While crude tankers appear to be heading into the anticipated downturn, the product tanker industry believes its inflated earnings are here to stayAnastassios Adamopoulos@Anastassios_LL Scorpio Tankers chief executive Emanuele Lauro is optimistic that the product tanker fundamentals point to the makings of strong prospects.“Supply of new tonnage remains anaemic against the backdrop of a rapidly ageing fleet. Simply put we have never seen an orderbook so low with rates so high,” he said during a conference call."
Well I'm buying this after hours great value great growth there is some bearish setiment but overall the fed contracts give this company a higher value
$TOPS $DCIX $PXS $ESEA $ANWWQ the Greeks thank everybody for their very generous donations to the beautify Athens fund.

"Pyxis Tankers Inc. operates as a maritime transportation company with a focus on the tanker sector in the United States. Its fleet transports refined petroleum products, such as naphtha, gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel, and fuel oil, as well as other liquid bulk items, including vegetable oils and organic chemicals.Huge demand is coming!"

PXS don’t miss the boat. It’s in early stage at great price.
"$PXS $DCIX $TOPS unload the bags quietly, massive dilution icebergs off to the starboard side."
"Jet fuel upside for product tanker demandReduced jet-fuel demand has hit both crude and product tankers hard. At last month’s virtual Capital Link New York Martime Forum, Ridgebury Tankers CEO Bob Burke said, “Everyone has experienced an 8% decline in demand, and if you ask why, there’s one answer: airlines.”According to Stifel Analyst B. Nolan, “Refined product tankers with high leverage should benefit [from the vaccine’s positive effect on air travel] as they have been oversold on the opaque outlook for the recovery.”On Monday, the stock of product-carrier owner Ardmore Shipping (NYSE: ASC) rose 15% and shares of Scorpio Tankers (NYSE: STNG) rose 14%.Among owners of both crude and product tankers, Diamond S Shipping (NYSE: DSSI) rose 13%, Frontline (NYSE: FRO) and Teekay Tankers (NYSE: TNK) rose 10%, and International Seaways (NYSE: INSW) gained 8%.""Time for the remaining smaller product tanker cos like PXS to react during this week or the next."

"Why is this stock still selling at 80 percent premium to the very recent $ 2 per share private placement? Ten -twenty percent premium I can understand, but at 3.60 it is way way over priced. The management just told you how much the market will bear to raise cash. Why do you think you know more than the smart money?"

Wait for under 5 to buy. Big money will pump it again so they can get out
Likely to get a multi day halt. Very sketchy play.
Heading to $3
Is this a pump job....because it feels like a pump job.
Play cautious I think shorting is the better play cause you know it will eventually come down. Can’t always know if it’s gonna keep going up
100% pxs will meet NASDAQ requirements until the end of the year. That means ZERO risk by buying below $1.01.
WOW Jackpot on making $3 will be here in a day or 2 !!!! BUY BUY BUY
