"$PXS $DCIX $TOPS unload the bags quietly, massive dilution icebergs off to the starboard side."
Just jumped in 3000 shares. This is in early stage of pump. The word is spreading. Jump in before pumpers ruin it.
Remember DCIX? Went up 600% in one day. This will do 300% easy at 1 million float
come on in... the water is warm
"Tanker rate slump is here, as predicted. VLCC rates are already down y/y and floating storage unwind hasn’t even really hit yet. See new FreightWaves article for latest tanker rate info and analyst comments: $NAT $FRO $INSW $DHT $TNK $TNP $STNG $ASC $PXS $NNA $TOPS https://www.freightwaves.com/news/supertanker-rates-nose-dive-the-dam-has-burst"
Do you realize this company only has 4 legit ships and they're working in a sector with low rates?
Up 22% pre-market. Was at 5.18 at one point.
$TOPS $DCIX $PXS $ESEA $ANWWQ the Greeks thank everybody for their very generous donations to the beautify Athens fund.

"Just remember folks, it CAN drop like a rock. Protect your gains."
Monday should be interesting
"This stock wants to break and oil prices and delivery ,this is going to be big ,get in now before it takes off"
13k..profits
EPS 1ST quarter 2018 estimate 0.20 compare to -0.02 Q4 2017 ;;;;;;;;HUGE POP TO COME SOON don t sell now
With oil price increasing and higher tanker rates….this will blow up soon.
"By the day PXS IPOed, its CEO Eddie Valentis has followed the same strategy about the stock: He never diluted at a lower price and never made a reverse split. Mr Valentis prefers to drive the stock price above $1 to meet NASDAQ requirements than do a r/s. Additionally, they have a mixed share offering running, but the shares are redeemable at $1.40. Another reason for the stock price to spike.So, it is very likely that PXS has a 25% minimum gain to offer until the end of this year. The bonus could be a higher spike above $1, like every year has happened during the second semester."
"Jet fuel upside for product tanker demandReduced jet-fuel demand has hit both crude and product tankers hard. At last month’s virtual Capital Link New York Martime Forum, Ridgebury Tankers CEO Bob Burke said, “Everyone has experienced an 8% decline in demand, and if you ask why, there’s one answer: airlines.”According to Stifel Analyst B. Nolan, “Refined product tankers with high leverage should benefit [from the vaccine’s positive effect on air travel] as they have been oversold on the opaque outlook for the recovery.”On Monday, the stock of product-carrier owner Ardmore Shipping (NYSE: ASC) rose 15% and shares of Scorpio Tankers (NYSE: STNG) rose 14%.Among owners of both crude and product tankers, Diamond S Shipping (NYSE: DSSI) rose 13%, Frontline (NYSE: FRO) and Teekay Tankers (NYSE: TNK) rose 10%, and International Seaways (NYSE: INSW) gained 8%.""Time for the remaining smaller product tanker cos like PXS to react during this week or the next."

It could reach to 7.50 by tomorrow due to positive news related to Rig.
Is there any way to know what stocks will be pumped in the future or is it just luck?
Rumors has it…. PXS is next pump. Word is spreading
Oil price is crazy and this tank isn't rising? Sooner or later it's going to explode
Go on Reddit and post ppl. Spread the word. PXS_stock
Play cautious I think shorting is the better play cause you know it will eventually come down. Can’t always know if it’s gonna keep going up
Today this stock is restricted to placing opening trades with a broker at TD Ameritrade.(No opening transactions online) Which brokers do NOT have this restriction?
its going to 20
PXS don’t miss the boat. It’s in early stage at great price.
ok now I'm out at 11.35 :) Made $5K
