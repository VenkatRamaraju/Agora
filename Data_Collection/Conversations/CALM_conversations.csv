CALM is up 6.46% to 45.16
"Eggs are on fire sale in all groceries again. However, this stock used to be resilient to low egg prices. It makes difficult for bottom pickers to get in."
"eggs were lower by 19.9 percent as a result of overproduction relative to demand. Production increased by 3.3 percent to 7,952 million dozen but domestic disappearance increased at a lower rate of 2.1 percent between 2018 and 2019 to 284 eggs per capita.---- Looking like another loss for this Qt. it would be the 4th in arrow."
HIgh short interest: 17 days to cover. Can we get a short covering rally during the next few days?
Management------please give us a dividend.
"Egg prices in grocery stores in my area, NorthEast, show steady increases. The stock performs weakly at the moment, mostly because broad market is too strong and so “safe havens” are not in big demand."
I just got my weakly food ad's.....Aldis has eggs on sale for 69 cents.....One super market has an 18 pack for 99 cents....Maybe thats why CALM is so weak.......
"Some day egg market will get balanced and, who knows, this company may start making money. It can happen in 2021 and investors used to buy before the turnaround."
"Zack's has CALM at a hold before earning it was a strong sell, so that is two upgrades. Strong sell to sell to HOLD and after next qtr or egg price back over 2 bucks a dozen === Zack's strong buy list all good BUY LOW sell high. O it does work that way OK."
Can some one plz tell me why share price increasing even though results are very poor? appreciate your thoughts
CALM reached a 52 Week low at 37.29
When are the earnings?
Egg prices will be closing the week around $1.53/dozen in several keys regions. Roughly 25% increase over last week's price.
"I am genuinely surprised this stock is not $32 or lower right now. I really thought it could even move to $30 or even high $20's on today's announcement. The company faces issues beyond its control, on multiple fronts. It is hard for me to imagine any new money moving in here, until the outlook improves. I think the stock hanging around $35 is a total gift for those that are long and provides a selling opportunity. I still think this stock makes a sharp break lower and when it does, those that got out at $35 will be happy. They should be able to buy back 20% lower in a month or two, if they chose to do so...."
"s/b a great Q ... Analysts s/b about right w/ $1.40 to $1.50 ... expecting a bit better revenues in the $480m range ... good pricing momentum going into Q ... record prices during Q ... and a relatively good May, which is traditionally the worst month for producers ... bird numbers up ... but very strong demand ... not sure what it will mean for stock price .... netlosstoo / calvin"

CALM is down -5.04% to 48.95
CALM is so big.........they could control / influence the market if they wanted to..........like creating a shortage of eggs all of a sudden.....just before the coming Holidays......
CALM is down -4.95% to 43.67
Why would Zack's rate us a sell??? It has to be a mistake.
You know the market is a bubble when a stock like this doesn't get that hard after a disasterous quarter. There's no hope for a dividend next year or the next and everyone is pricing it like there's going to be a return to $3/doz eggs next year.
CALM is up 5.62% to 39.49
"Revenues are expected to drop from $443,095 year ago to $311,000 and a loss between $0.10 to $0.34 vs. $1.48 I believe they could be much worse, but next qt. with current egg prices and the price of corn the losses could double the next qt. and the comparisons deadly! What you got is a crack egg, go short!"
“Historically the industry has made more money w/ higher feed costs” Dolph Baker 22 min into the recent BofA webcast under events on the cal maine websiteInvestors in egg industry companies should understand the reasoning behind this contrarian concept. IMO investors should not be selling when corn and beans are on the rise ... netlosstoo
Cal-Maine Foods is down 4.99% to 39.07
The company pays a cumulative variable dividend. Which means they need to get back above water before they will pay another. My guess is the next dividend will be late 2017 or early 2018.
CALM is down -5.25% to 41.50
No profits no dividend....
"I was referring the stock market-""strongest markets ever"""
"I read a article on Forbes that Calm was a ideal short, lolGreat idea Forbes numbskull to Short more CALM so we can run over you and make you beg to cover. Just when egg prices and profits are soaring. Calm is a trading vehicle for traders wanting to time the profit cycle of this egg producer. Maybe tomorrow or any day now you will see analyst earnings upgrades from .06/sh average consensus to over .60/share a ten fold increase. This news is about to bump CALM another 5-10% and its leaking slowly out as earnings date approaches. Everyone knows CALM had a great Feb Q."
I see they est. 0.86$ earnings per share next year Vs -1.04 this year. Is that right? If so not bad but if not well .......Sticky refers to the fact the market hits new highs since 2015 and this thing is stuck at negative stock return!!! New chief is family ....
Yah it just expected to drop. Like I said u can buy around 34 by end of this week
"Finally, true value stock performance here."
"I am in ... simple business to understand, basic consumer stuff, high dividend, low payout ratio, low debt, low PE, growing trend in last 5 years,... eh... whats not to like, Hope they kept debts down after this acq... due ur own dd."
"Egg prices move higher. My wife sent me to buy couple dozens today and I purposely checked few stores around. The price went up everywhere, comparing with couple weeks ago. This stock will follow in the same direction."
"Egg market is firmly oversupplied and ""specialty eggs"" is a hilarious thing; they are likely bought by folks unaware of real life and real pricing. It is, essentially, the same, by culinary criteria, eggs for double price.This stock is perpetually overvalued, because market sees it as ""safe haven"", people will continue eating eggs no matter what. It keeps price high, higher than fundamentals suggest; esp. in time of turbulent markets."
Do hens catch Covid-19 ?
I told you all this would crash. I am looking for 30 and then 25 as egg prices crash further. Last time I bought eggs it was .49 at aldi Calm is losing their shirts and it will not turn for several years at least. Cage free means free eggs for everyone. Look the chicken makes eggs for free why shouldn't the farm give the eggs away the way I see this. Short more PUTS yesssss
"The most steady oversupply industry conditions; no indications for having meaningful profits for long time ahead. On the other hand, strong balance sheet and industry ""safe haven"" reputation supports share price well higher than book value. It leaves little room for this stock to regain ""value"" status in foreseeable future."
I have watched CALM trade in a range for years......Locally eggs are cheap one store is running a special 57 cents a dozen....
Cal-Maine Foods is down 4.99% to 43.75
eggs prices are still falling
1.02 market.
"For what it is worth - I never short stocks - I hate having unlimited downside risk. In this case with CALM I have bought put options. The 42.50 Nov 21 puts have very little premium(about $1) in them only trade around $6 currently. If I am wrong my risk is limited to the option value - if right I can make a lot of money. If I am correct about feed cost killing earnings - we will see it in one of the next two earnings reports and the share price should reflect it (at least in part). I like this trade - but just like everything else - these put options are just a small part of a much more broad portfolio - which is almost entirely long, in my other positions.."
"Lower input cost, record sells, higher prices = huge profits...CALM could soon bring back the dividend....JMHO"
Buy opp!
"Why do they call eggs cage free? Because thats where the price is going...FREE, oh my CALM is hurtin big time no one coming to save the big egg producer. Being the biggest hurts the most. wake me up at 30 please"
what happened today?
"They are basically giving eggs away for free. Look.........I bought 12 large eggs for $.03. Yes, three (3) cents. No typo. Albertsons' had it on sale last Friday only, two cartons max. per customer........ 3 cents.......really......Well......yes........So I got myself two cartons........and the cashier smiled at me when I paid for them.....with a nickel and a penny."
"I just paid 88 cents for extra large eggs......What's the news on the large contract that CALM lost , what will that do to CALM profits going forward...."
https://www.togglemag.com/case-studies/cal-maine-foods-inc/
This stock is going to 60
"“Since the end of the third quarter, market prices have moved significantly higher to record levels,”We did beat earning and revenue Next quarter is looking great "
"Guessing a 40 cent EPS loss Q1 ... 45 cent feed cost including a LCM write downGuessing a 2 cent EPS for Q2, 40 cents for Q3 and 2 cents for Q4netlosstoo"
I wonder what is supporting this slow rise in stock price?? Some stores are giving a dozen eggs away as a special.
CALM is up 4.90% to 42.80
"strong management and negligible debt will see CALM through again. it's tough to be long right now, but patience will pay. i will add to my position as appropriate."
Any news to explain the 3% drop.......
CALM reached a 52 Week low at 36.26
CALM is down 5.70% to 39.07
"Statements by CALM in their website cast a grim near-term:https://calmainefoods.com/investors/volatility-of-egg-prices/Quoted from website:We have experienced reduced demand for egg products, as many of our commercial customers reformulated their products to use fewer eggs when prices spiked and have been slow to resume previous egg usage. Together, these factors have created an oversupply of eggs, with continued pressure on market prices. We expect the egg markets to remain under pressure and do not expect to see meaningful improvement until there is a better balance of supply and demand."
"ok here we go, egg prices are soaring over the next few weeks for Easter. Started going up today in fact. Estimates going up. Calm will easily beat at earnings. Estimates are for .06/sh which is laughable. I'm sure estimates are being adjusted as I write this.Looks to me like CALM may earn 1.00/sh for the Q ended Feb 28. Next Q started out good also. All the estimates need to go up giving CALM PPS a good boost back up into the mid 40's again. Great safe trading vehicle. All aboard now!!"
No mistake about it. Egg prices in the stores around me have definitely stabilized. Also the price of this stock has firmed up.
"Just a matter of waiting for good news. Until then, the price goes anywhere the big players want it to go"
You can buy this around $34 in few days. I wouldn’t buy now. Will not go up for 3-4 days. Serious loss so no chance to go up soon
Technically charting CALM eggxactly the 36 level triple swab test but break the shell of that ceiling and CALM can run like liquid down the slope but in this scrambled example will go to 38. Raise your sights up today CALMboids. Going to 40 before humpty dumty fixes all his cracks.
CALM is up 6.15% to 32.85
Easter is coming...........and people -for some reason- throw away millions of eggs..........but they have to buy them first.
Egg price is on the news againhttps://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/coronavirus-panic-shopping-eggs-prices-have-tripled-in-three-weeks/
Seems like good support at 38? looking to buy. Long term holders your thoughts?
"I always hate selling stocks short - i dislike the unlimited risk. I much prefer options, and this is a good stock to do that with. As I noted previously - I have been short for a while, via owning put options. If you buy the Nov in the money puts - something like the 42.50 puts for November, the premium is only about $1 - not too bad given - I think this stock is much more likely to see $30 than $40 by the end of the year. The nice thing with the Novembers as well, they expire about a month after the August earnings release in October earning release - if that report is as bad as I expect - the stock could really get pounded in the weeks heading into expiration. I own some August puts as well - but with Easter supporting the May quarter, it may act to mask some of the bad news, so I prefer November for the extra $1 in cost...Good Luck..."
"Frank- corn-""Friday at around $5.30 per bushel"" You left out that corn was selling for $3.25 per bushel a year ago."
Egg prices are trending higher in my opinion..........
CALM reached a 52 Week low at 34.90
Cal-Maine Foods is up 5.73% to 36.91
"CALM has seen its lows; stock price should trade higher 45-50 before end of 2016 instead of under 40.Besides, dividend should return after none paid this past quarter because of losing quarter.Just my 2 cents."
"It was long ago proven that eggs contain all amino acids needed for human survival.Now, the longest living person on Earth reveals all:""She maintained her unusual diet since 1919, when she was diagnosed with anemia and a doctor advised her to eat eggs.For the last 27 years, her physician has been Dr. Carlo Bava. “Emma has always eaten very few vegetables, very little fruit,” he said. “When I met her, she ate three eggs per day, two raw in the morning and then an omelette at noon, and chicken at dinner.Think about that. Not only do eggs contain ALL the proteins needed for human health but also virtually everything else."
"Formally speaking, results are mixed: miss on revenue, beat on earnings. However, the earnings beat is pretty strong. Also dividend restored. I think, in total, the company performs very well and, the most important for investment perspective, it is a safe haven stock."
"Some of you ""bulls"" on CALM have to be smoking crack to think it's heading back to $40.They had a WHOPPING loss of 10.1 MILLION $$$.Sales are down 12.7%Missed consensus estimates by a BIG marginThey lost a BIG customerThere is continued DOWNWARD pricing pressure on salesThere is continued DOWNWARD pricing pressure on costsThere's a big increase in hens (more downward price pressure)What don't you guys get???CALM will be 30-32 (maybe lower) before it ever gets anywhere else."

Earnings release Jan 5th
Anyone else hear the news of the huge egg recall
she is gonna make another run at those recent highs. this time i suspect the price will not collapse like last time. the fundamentals have shifted in favor of this company with lower grain and higher egg prices.
CALM is up 6.37% to 42.60
Why is this dog up? Revenue is dropping and they are losing money.
CALM is up 5.30% to 47.00
"ea. date is set, should say not ea. but loss date. gone short again, it looks like a loss this qt. and also next qt.Not only are egg prices low but their biggest expense corn is making highs-ugh!"
Are they in the news with the recall due to the salmonella outbreak? I could not see any of their brands among those listed online. Eh?

Albertson's had 12 eggs for $0.03 the other week..............Who can make money on that ? Granted it's a promo........but still.......
Eggs are still cheap in my area.......
"This is a commodity business for the most part, other than the specialty eggs that are produced. On the demand side per capita egg consumption does not change that much, however on the supply side it can change drastically in just a few months. After a good market year for shell eggs like 2018, excess money in farmers' hands almost always results in over production the following year. It is a vicious cycle."
CALM reached a 52 Week low at 33.22
And arent they existing higher priced specialty eggs?....still can not read the CEO strategy other than hoping for prices to go up....eh still long not sure for how long.....
"Why surprised? Just check PPC and SAFM or TSN. Now, when the company admitted the low egg price, you know how bad it is now. $35 target?"

"Some chickens are almost completely resistant to a serious strain of avian influenza, new research has shown.The study, carried out at the Pirbright Institute, found birds that carried the strain of avian influenza but were genetically resistant to the disease only shed the virus through their respiratory tract and for a limited period of time.The researchers discovered that this was the only relevant means of spreading the virus and that resistant birds were therefore completely unable to initiate or sustain a chain of infection.Genetic restrictionFurther results in the study suggest that this could be due to a genetic restriction within the animal that stops the virus spreading when inside the body. Birds that were susceptible to the disease shed the virus in faeces and over a longer period of time.Professor Venugopal Nair, head of the Avian Viral Diseases programme at the Pirbright Institute, said: “The findings of this study emphasise the importance of examining the intricate nature of the virus-host interactions and the potential role of the host genetic factors influencing the transmission dynamics and outcomes of important diseases such as avian flu.”Major implications for poultry breedingThe findings, reported in the journal Scientific Reports, pave the way for further investigation, and work is planned to discover and examine the precise biological mechanisms behind genetic resistance. This could have major implications for poultry breeding, as well as human flu treatments, in the future.Dr Colin Butter, from the School of Life Sciences at the University of Lincoln, which was heavily involved in the research, said the results of the research were significant. “Until now we knew relatively little about how a bird’s genetics can affect its reaction to flu virus, but this new research, which for the first time shows that some poultry lines are genetically resistant to avian flu, represents a significant step forward,” he said.“Limiting risk to human population”“The prospect of breeding birds with natural immunity to influenza virus would certainly widen the scope of existing control measures and perhaps limit the risk to the human population of the emergence of pandemic viruses.“Furthermore, as human genetic determinants for catching flu are comparatively unknown, research such as ours, which is developing a better understanding of the genes and mechanisms involved, could also lead to improved therapeutic options in humans.”The study also involved specialists from the University of Oxford and the Francis Crick Institute in London and was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.Tony McDougal, Poultry World---See full article on worldpoultry"

Great time to buy!
"Frank-"" so what could go wrong."" Lets start with the fact that egg prices are at the year's low and below their cost and have been so for the last month. Then the fact that their single biggest cost item corn, is trading at the high for the year and seems to be going higher. Net, net CALM is losing money and maybe doing so for a long long time and that is why they got a double downgrade. Dead money at best!"
Anyone still think this isn't simply short covering?
visit http://www.imxprs.com/free/stockalerts/stockanalysis1 .
The USDA reports egg prices ........ I believe weekly....
May short covering for CALM begin--back to $46-$48 fast.
Their latest rev reported in the 340 mil range and the previous qtr rev in 440 mil range. BUT net income 26 cents now Vs 1.44 cent previous qtr. Come one now whats up with this.... Their last 4 qrtly reports they missed earnings by three to one!!!! Who is running this thing? How difficult is it to sell eggs and keep costs down... get someone with fresh yoke
"#$%$ state -"" plus the 22% reported short interest will have to cover at some point "" Shorts do not have to cover anymore than longs have to sell, also 78% longs are losing money this up year and the 22% shorts are making money. These figures show me the pressure is on the longs to sell as they are missing out on a strong market being long this very weak stock."
This looks like the last “value stock” around with share price still low. All similar equities already jumped.
Bird flu outbreak at Tyson foods
And no more div. :(
i looked at CALM and all this company does is own a bunch of chickens and sells eggs and i think a lot of the land is leased. so do not put a bunch of your eggs in to one basket. THIS STOCK IS NOT FOR ME. THIS STOCK WILL DROP A LOT MORE
Looks like a bad data point for earnings release in June. Must be July -- bad info. Bummer.
"Nowhere to go but down, slowed only by short covering."
The new add's just arrived. The local supermarket has an 18 pack of eggs for $1.00.........

(WDAM) - Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce Andy Gipson and the nation’s largest shell egg producer, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., donated 280,000 eggs to Extra Table to assist families during the COVID-19 pandemic.The donation was made as a way to show appreciation to workers in the food industry during the pandemic, as well as do an honorable deed as a part of National Egg Month.Extra Table was joined with the Mississippi Food Network as they helped to facilitate the donation.“There is no better way to recognize National Egg Month and to honor our farmers and food workers who have continued to work through the pandemic than with this donation of over a quarter million eggs that will go to those who need them the most,” said Gipson. “I want to thank Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. for their generosity and for making this possible, and I appreciate the Mississippi Food Network and Extra Table for getting these eggs into the hands of those in our local communities.The donation to Extra Table will help families in the state during the pandemic as the organization aims to end hunger by providing food pantries and soup kitchens with new and healthy food they need to feed the hungry in their community.“What an ‘EGGciting’ donation to receive at a time when our hungry neighbors here in Mississippi need food,” said Martha Allen, Executive Director of Extra Table. “At Extra Table, we know eggs are a family favorite for breakfast, but eggs are also the glue that holds much of what we eat together, from brownies to meatloaf.”Based in Jackson, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. Operates in a company of almost 40.1 million layers and 9.9 million pullets and breeders, selling about 1,038.9 million dozen shell eggs.“The people of our state have experience natural disasters and the effects of a world-wide pandemic, and a lot of people need help,” said Ryan Laster, Director of Food Safety and Animal Welfare of Cal-Maine Foods. “We are proud to make this donation to the Mississippi Food Network and Extra Table.”"

My eggzact jumbo chart is never cracked and shows that humpty dumpty is falling down and can't get up. Just get out your sharp #2 pencil and take notice of the shape of your chart vs my washed and graded final score and you will see that CALM has a hairline crack right up the middle of the chickens ovum. The only way CALM can survive is to Hi-line as fast as possible to delete the future hatch and since we all know CALM is too stupid to see the future in front of their eyes just keep shorting these girl hens until the feed bill goes blood red spot like the eggs in the blue pail. Nothing but cage free dog food here. SELL like there is a fox in the hen house.
Cal-Maine Foods is up 6.15% to 32.85
"Todd, the downward slide has a long way to go. The analyst all had too high ea. estimates and price targets. one had ea. est. of + $.69 and price target of $ 47 and now all of them have egg on their face and must start lowering their estimates big time. Eggs this qt. so far are much lower then last qt. and the ea. estimated for this qt. which are already a negative 69 cent will likely go below a dollar loss for this qt. Once the big institutional wake up they will start selling, but it just take time."
"Armageddon, You left out one more important factor and that is demand/consumption for eggs is flat to lower, so Calm has been losing money big time and so will shareholders."
"CALM has a history of being a well run company with low debt. CALM also has a history of paying a nice dividend, I would not be surprised to see CALM acquired by an investment company or a large food company that uses a lot of eggs in their products...jmho"

Eggs price has greatly improved (at least at the store) over the past months. One dozen of regular large eggs was $1.99 not too long ago......and now it's $2.49 - That's a nice %.
Initiated as Buy at B of A. Price target $47.
Today is a totally overreacted reaction in my opinion. These analysts apparently have more to say at the moment than are doing their quarterly reports.
I just read that the Avian flu is hitting parts of Africa and that egg prices rising.....

Shell egg disappearance during the 2019 holiday season is estimated to benearly 6 eggs per household (2.2 eggs per capita), down about 2 eggs from 2018 whenEaster/Passover was observed three-weeks earlier. Consumers are responding favorablyto active retail promotions and it is estimated that they will consume/color an estimated707 million shell eggs during the holiday season, about 60 million dozen."
WHO IS BUYING THIS STOCK AFTER THE DISASTROUS REPORT.
More bad news.Corn futures on track to settle at highest in nearly a month as USDA cuts U.S. ending stocks estimate.
"Missed 4 quarters in a row and negative earning. Later guys, I am exiting this boat."
"Commodities are raising, tax cuts are adding to the bottom line and Easters coming.CALM should see increased earnings. A few quarters of positive earnings and CALM could start paying a dividend again "" in my opinion ""....."
Great Value eggs at wal-mart is CALM. I wonder why?? Maybe because they are going cage free????
Huge short ratio: about 18 according to NASDAQ. That is probably driving the rally since the earnings release spike down.
everyone and their mother hens know this is a yoke company that is gonna lay rotten eggs from now on. This cracked shell of a company can not even crack a profit ever. The management is scrambling to stop rolling downhill and once they get to the bottom they will be fried up and poached. Believe me this company which all they do is lay duds of eggs can not even count to 12 much less do any any hard cook books. There is only red and green egg numbers in this outlook so you may as well sell these eggs and move on. going below 20 soon.
Should into the 30'soon.
CALM has a 95% chance to crack under 29. The earnings are grade B at best and possibly in the blue pail if you know what that means its basically inedible or in wall street parlance bankrupt. How will calm get the cash to cover the feed costs this Q with egg prices sunny side down? The only way is too offer shares which will dilute or float a large bond and the egg producer will have to pay hard cooked money at least 9% from the lending mill. Speaking of the mill it seems like the farmers growing corn and soybeans will cash in this year and next on CALMs broken egg back. Oh my someone needs to contact CALM bod and mandate that they immediately kill all layers over 59 weeks but that will be expensive although it might save this sour egg from going into receivership. Heck even 20 dollar PPS is better than zero eggzactly where it's headed.
Been holding this stock for a few years now. It’s been one big dud.
CALM is down 8.41% to 41.60
Cal-Maine Foods is down 5.09% to 32.79
Any solid data on whether the laying flock was impacted with the freezes?
Huge move on very low volume.............
CALM reached a 52 Week low at 36.06
"Aftermarket weakness by 100K shares. Why? Downgrade coming? How do we value this stock? Surely, it looks overpriced at more than 20 times forward earnings per share. But,eggs are steady, staple in many American's diet. The stock did not do much past 5 years. Finally, why such high short positions? Any answer to these questions would be appreciated."
With this mornings up tick this thing is already 20% up from its Nov 4th lows!!!..... up to u now to trade or hold... and u know what I am doing....
"Looks to me like the Bird flu pandemic in Japan and Korea where they are on the verge of losing over 50% of the total layer production has finally began to affect USA egg prices. Egg prices began to rise this week already and the demand from Korea and Japan is overwhelming supply especially with the extreme summer heat in USA egg producing areas, and the cut backs due to high feed we will see a run that may rival 2015 when CALM almost got to 65 as egg prices doubled that year due to AI in USA. I expect we already are seeing what could be a spike in egg prices to Urner Barry 1.50 and above maybe even 2.00 UB. There is going to be a extreme shortage of eggs in July and August and you can see Walmart has just started to fill their warehouses in advance but they are driving the egg price higher this week and it will continue thru July and August most likely because they will drain every egg in production. Would not be surprised at all to see egg prices double in the short term. Seen this happen before and oh BTW the high short interest will fuel CALM pps way over 40 by July 8th. I'm long and strong and getting longer at these levels tomorrow."
"I covered my short and sold my puts, hope it rallies before ea. so I can do it all over again. Egg prices are still to low for this Co. to make money and so no dividend."
"Check egg prices, after a very brief jump from below .50 cent to just above $1.00 they have a fallen again to just above .50 cents. At this current price CALM is still losing money, no dividend and should be making new lows, unless egg prices rise which does not seem likely near term.IMO"
This is not eggzactly what I eggspected.
"USDA Economic Research Service issued an updated forecast of egg production on December 16th, updating the previous November 15 th report. The volume of eggs produced and per capita consumption in 2019 were increased by 2.9 and 1.9 percent respectively compared to 2018 data. Consistent with this disparity, the benchmark New York price was reduced by 31.9 percent in unit value."
Look at a chart going back 4 years and you'll see CALM hitting around $37.00 low and around $60.00 high..Recently it seems like we are range bound between $40.00 and $50.00..If the charts correct theres strong support in the high $30's and low $40's..CALM seems to be buying up all it's competitors and with Easter coming we could see some nice numbers......JMHO

Air lifting eggs to South Korea due to shortage of eggs for Lunar New Year. Love it! Not making this up. Apparently there is a chicken flu epidemic in S. Korea. Source BUZZ/ Charles Schwab news. Expect egg lift to continue after Jan 31 (Lunar new Year) until at least June 2017.

"I just added a few more puts - not at the exact top - but when the stock was about $36.80. All my other puts are Aug/Nov - after earnings reports. This time I decided to by some 37.50 and 35 puts for June 18th. I think we had one big buyer come in today to push this higher - my best guess is it reverse in short order. I will stick my neck out and say we go back below $36 before the day is over and back below $35 by early next week, maybe even late this week.. If I am wrong, this trade will hurt me some - but as we all know, you have to invest as you believe no matter what others say or think so all of this is simply my opinion, being backed up by some of my cash - nothing to crazy - but about 5% of my stock money is in puts here, after today''s trade..."
It is crazy BOA finally comes out with a double down grade from Buy to sell - siting higher feed costs. Unbelievable these analyst get paid so much when they always seem to be late to figure things out - look at my notes from two months ago - maybe BOA should hire me... But seriously - it is terrible these analyst get paid so much and perform so poorly - not just here - but with many stocks...Nevertheless - I am glad to see the downgrade - it will only help my position...
No yoke stay CALM buy eggs resistance broke ovum support at 36

Their presentation http://www.calmainefoods.com/media/1131/calm-stephens-2016.pdf shows feed costs per dozen, egg prices, and price of soybean & corn meal. BUt have they ever said at what price they break even? In other words, if you take out the feed cost, what other costs per dozen do they have?

"I've got a contact in the egg industry who says wholesale prices are now over $3.00/dozen this week. First time in 20 years to have a price this high. Demand is high and supply is low. Of course this week's pricing won't be posted until Monday, so now may be the time to move."
If egg prices are low and corn prices are high wouldn't that hurt profits ?.........jmho
"I would expect to see this week, the few analyst that follow CALM, to drop price targets and ea. estimates and recommend SELL!"
I like how their answer to over supply is more supply of specialty eggs.
"FRANK, you state-""stock remains in the long term uptrend""- The stock sold higher 5 years ago and is flat from 7 years ago. I believe most investors would call that long term."
That’s what we need“we remain focused on meeting the current high demand for eggs.”
"I think it will make a new yearly low, IE. low $30s by next qt. earnings"
What is driving this stock? Low volume short covering?
Don't get me wrong - these guys run good business - but I think they could have real problems over the next few years. We saw a nearly 15% increase in cost in this most recent quarter (mostly due to corn prices) I think corn prices will keep going up - in part because I think with Biden/Democrats in power we could once again see more ethanol production (thanks to subsidies coupled with rising oil costs)....I think CALM will really be hurt by the cost increases over the next year or two and we could easily see this stock pull back to $15-$20 area over the next couple years...
Its slowly recovering but still ways to go... If they can repeat last quarter and hit pre tax of $1.25 per quarter then this may go to at least the high 70's and get back to paying div. The chief got to deliver now with all the recalls etc... eh lets see
I see a 54 cent loss. Revenue at $254 million based on egg prices averaging about 5% higher than Q1. Since dividends are based on earnings and will not be paid until the company returns to profitability the next payout could be a while. Losses are cumulative so the company has a hole to crawl out of. My guess is the next dividend investors will receive will occur sometime in mid 2018.
"Everyone - take a good hard look at the long-term chart. If CALM makes a new 52 week low, there is basically no support level until the $15-$16 area. I am not saying it will go down that far, but there is no support underneath - so all bets are off on how far this falls once a new 52 week low is hit...I am very glad, I took the position I have taken (buying puts) as indicated in my previous notes...A rare thing for me - almost every other position I have in the market is long..."

"October 1, 2018 Earnings Release Spike Down:CALM should recover to $48 in the next few days. Tends to spike down on earnings release, and then recover to pre-release stock price in the following week or two. Check the chart."
"Why will Calm be up 5-10% plus this week? #1 analysts over shot reducing estimates and CALM will beat the -.50 concensus#2 Egg Market is on the upswing after a mediocre summer#3 USDA announcing large purchases eggs into the fall further tightening egg prices#4 Oct-Dec are CALMs seasonal best stock increase times, and starting from low basis the odds are PPS goes back to 45 plus in coming weeks and months.#5 Producers have been reducing the flock over last year by 7-8%#6 demand from restaurants and institutions is at the nader and will improve as we reopen economyNo one is expecting a beat tomorrow except a few people and I think tomorrow will be a big turn for CALM but CALM is not really a long term investment. It is to me a trading stock."
Frank- yes 4m short and making money and 144m long losing money.Tell me which side has the pressure to sell or to cover?-Thanks
What will CALM earnings be for this FY? Full year earnings. Any estimates?
I am going to accept today's gift and sell out of my put options. Given recent egg price activity and corn price decreases - it is time to move away from a short position on this...
USDA reports that egg prices are up a few cents..
May be it is time to eat the hens.........or give them away as div........ I'd love to receive say........24 hens as dividend..........Oh well.......things will improve next quarter hopefully.
Should be an excellent Q ... analysts have not updated for the better than expected egg prices ... EU shortages creating better world egg prices ... netlosstoo
"FRANK, You got everything backwards. Shorts have cash in/covered almost 1 million shares and now have only less than 10% of outstanding stock short. The shorts are making money, whereas the longs or 40+ million shares are all losing money this year and more so if they don't sell soon. The pressure is on the longs to sell(losing money) and not the shorts to cover(making money)"
"SHELL EGGSEgg prices have rallied significantly in the past week, as analysts attribute the strong retail demand to consumers stocking up on essentials. Additionally, foodservice demand has remained strong. When combined with the seasonal expectations for increased shell egg demand for Easter and Passover, prices are forecasted to remain firm in the upcoming weeks. There are still enough birds in the pipeline, but analysts point out the demand story is in command of the price direction. With the market rebounding sharply off the recent lows, Further Processors have had to pay up for additional supplies, as prices were higher for both breakers and liquid eggs.https://www.usfoods.com/our-services/business-trends/farmers-report.html"
"Ok........they lost a large customer, and that is not good at first sight. Hey, it's business, it happens.........but wouldn't that give them the opportunity to find new customers ?.......... Why always emphasize the bad side of things ?Do we even know the name of that ""lost"" customer ???"
"My household used to go through a dozen eggs a month, but now with Covid, between making our own whiskey sours with egg whites, and my wife baking up a storm, we are buying quadruple that amount. Earnings will be good for a while. Also, at some point, the trade in tech will max out, and the Robinhood crew will need a new stock to chase. CALM stock feels like a good place to park money."
Egg prices are in the tank. Why doesn't this stock reflect that?
CALM looking like earnings will be over $4 next year.
How can a egg company that has 1/4 of the market lose money. This company is not run well.
I have been trying to buy at $38 and under but no luckAnytime I place an order ask jumps up??So I got in today.Oversold Trade deal will open up the market Very undervalued Good time to get in I think
The last time this was in the $34.s was April 2014.......Good things and bad things happened since. No way it goes back there these days.
I am short this stock and you should be also...Get out before egg prices go down and feed goes up. CALM has no pricing power. Its all over now
CALM is up 6.17% to 42.70
When is the earnings release date? Anyone.... anyone....

They should supply MCD,YUM,DIN,BKC, and many others only EGGG company that can supply there need. I THINK because they do supply wal-mart and SAM's plus COSTCO well done. STAY CALM and get paid and paid well since 2008 very well done. O TSN should make a bid for CALM or work something out and merge sweet deal. O YES"
"CALM-Making 5 year lows during one of the strongest markets ever, so when a correction happens, we could go back to single digits."
"""Pursuant to Cal-Maine Foods’ variable dividend policy, for each quarter for which the Company reports net income, the Company pays a cash dividend to shareholders in an amount equal to one-third of such quarterly income. Following a quarter for which the Company does not report net income, the Company will not pay a dividend with respect to that quarter or for a subsequent profitable quarter until the Company is profitable on a cumulative basis computed from the date of the last quarter for which a dividend was paid.

"CALM is the largest egg producer in the USA, at a $2B market cap. That is really low folks. A few years ago this was valued at around $55. This is a well run company with over $200M in cash, very little debt of a few $M. This will either get bought out, or you will see a continue in consolidation in this space, with CALM being the largest beneficiary of newly acquired assets. They own farms, land, and chickens. It is a very simple, straightforward business that will be very profitable once egg prices turn around, which is around the corner. Hold tight and relax."
"SAFM and PPC have PE about 10. If CALM makes $2 this year, that gives a forward PE of over 20. CALM is over-valued relative to industry peers. Any good reason to price CALM so richly?"
"Management should manage a growth plan to cover price fluctuations like all other businesses. Price of eggs will fluctuate. So what. If the only way this thing will make it is waiting until price of eggs are up well then .. what are overpaid ""execs"" doing?"
Solid quarter should be closer to 1.40 earnings per quarter hopefully will trade close to $70. I added more today.
"Covered all my shorty pants, eggs getting a bid and could double due to cutbacks, and our distand Cuz safm goooot scoped up by Cargill at1 x sales so Calm could get snapped up by cargill at 1 times future sales which would be 45 although the closely controlled board would never accept less than 60. LONG is the play now into the winter. CALM will see 45 by January as egg prices soar soon. Do not get egg on your face if you are short"
"Well...........the heirs got clobbered all right - They just lost >$28,000,000 today alone.That should reduce the estate tax by some.........."
How can this move up or down when it isn't even announced how much they are paying? Looking at what happened in the oil patch with companies acquiring assets at the top of oil prices I think this could go either way depending on the price paid to acquire new producers. Maybe there will be a huge savings in operations but people should wait a bit to get more info about the deal
BEAR OF THE DAYCalMaine Foods (CALM) is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and after seeing its stock peak in early March the price has tumbled down some 17% to current levels
"Its a good business, low valuation, no debt, reasonably diversified segments, negative correlation coef, easy business to understand (not simple buy easy), it is cyclical so more often their rev and income will swing, I like their div policy... its credible and with low debts and will not mess up true book value...its a great buyout target if not for the insiders...eh...whats not to like for long term investors...on the risk side, regulation, viruses and consumer trends and maybe alternatives.... do ur own DD...I like to hold and may buy more if it dips too far...may have to wait to 2018 to capture gains but where else....its far better than current market valuation..."
"Channel checks are still telling me the (large, wholesale, South region) egg price is holding over $3/dozen. CALM will now have 2 straight weeks of selling eggs at the highest price in memory. This quarter's sales figures should look very strong on both a YOY basis and absolute basis."
Cal-Maine Foods is up 4.93% to 38.12
Maybe they ought to go into selling chicken soup? Another cash stream and an outlet for excess layers?? Lol
"Earnings announced. Strong beat on both revenue and earnings, esp. earnings. Egg market turned the corner, while the company maintained exemplary financial strength."
"Frank-""So I guess CALM can't raise their prices."" You are right CALM can't raise prices unless the commodity price for eggs rises. That is why CALM does not give a forecast for the next quarterly earning. When asked why not their reply was ""we don't know what the price for eggs will be and the price of corn will be, as we have no control over these prices."" You can check the new egg prices on Tuesday in Wall Street Journal under commodity prices and they are at the years low."
What a joke.....As long as they run this company as a commodity producer it will rise and fall irrespective of its well paid management team...... a bit of branding and differentiation can go a long way. But this requires leadership and vision. .... eh.... anyway am hoping price of eggs go up and some rain... will do the dance...
"Their plain earnings report missed sales again at a time when ""per capital egg consumption is up near historic levels"". So if not now when will sales beat? Perhaps when consumption is at historic low due to some unforeseen virus.....? Come guys....Again, nothing in their earnings about how specifically they plan to grow.... still hoping they dont keep renovating and expanding their facilities back to losses..... eh"
Egg prices are falling when they usually rise and are well below cost of production.. This qt. and next look like another loss and that would be 4th consecutive qt. in the loss column. I think these developments may cause a panic rush to the door to get out. Time will tell.
Just compare corn futures trend 2007 vs 2021...
"Has anyone looked at the short interest in this stock and if so, do they have any comments?"
CALM is down 12.75% to 31.08
CALM is up 5.91% to 39.95
This will definitely go to 25 soon the earnings are chicken scratch and the feed costs are record high. The egg producer is running around like a chicken with their heads chopped off thinking they are alive. The sales are in the compost pile and the only thing left to do is delete the chicken. Expansion as usual killed the goose with the golden egg and all that's left is rotten eggs that's no yoke. Short this to 25 and lower.
Why so much short interest in CALM? There are many way overvalued restaurant and tech companies.
"I'm liking this stock more and more as I look at the balance sheet, scale, and acquisition runway.Management has good track record of executing growth strategy. Cage free should be steady area for growth funded by legacy production egg sales."

Is this settlement anything to do with the recent story about Walmart mislabeling cagefree CALM eggs in their stores?

Seems overvalued by about 5-7$ imo.
"I will tell everyone - I never short stocks and rarely buy puts. But I did buy puts a while ago for the reasons indicated in my previous notes. They have been performing very well. After today's action, against yet another up market, I can tell you, this stock is on the verge of a major sharp move downward. If, I were long, I would, without a doubt sell, wait for the next earning release - to see how bad it is, wait for the stock to put in a solid bottom, then and only then re-enter...Good luck..."
"Todd- it looks like some stuckholders want to get out before the earnings report that CALM just announced today, that will be on the 19th of July. The next quarter coming up will be a bigger disaster( egg prices down, corn prices up and egg sales flat) so keep holding your puts."
