Does anybody ever post here? I bought 700 shares on Friday. It looks like a great long-term hold to me. No debt. Cutting edge products and staff. Pays a decent dividend. Willing to work and contribute with others for the greater good. What’s not to like?
Is this stock a good buy for long term?( NB)
Why does this has PE of 350?
What’s going on with NATI? No one wanna discuss?

National Instruments Rises Following Strong Q3 Results
"This is a great company with innovative products and a lot of very smart people. It’s a great place to work. However, that does not make it a great stock. If you want a respectable dividend in a safe stock with some growth, this stock may work for you, but don’t expect big gains in price or returns.NI was a disruptive force at its beginning. Going up against established big boys like instrument maker Hewlett Packard and HP did not like it one bit. NI made hardware and software that enabled automation of HP instrument using an IBM PC rather than HP’s proprietary instrument controllers. HP fought then on the standards committees but lost. NI-488 eventually became a de facto standard version of IEEE-488. NI moved towards making complete instruments with PC modules and later PXI. LabView was unique software that provided an easer path for lab automation and opened new markets in manufacturing test and academic R&D.Currently, growth is steady but limited. NI makes instrument modules for a wide range of applications at lower cost the traditional bench instruments but the are not leading edge in performance. 5G is driving some demand but, if you need top in performance in RF, you go to Keysight (formally Agilent formally HP) or Rhode & Swartz."
