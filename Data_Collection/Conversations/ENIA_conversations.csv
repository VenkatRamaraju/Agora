What on earth is moving this stock today? I can't get any news on this or ENIC. They seem to march to a different drummer than the utilities North America. Does this have something to do with the utility in Argentina who just filed bankruptcy yesterday? How is that good for ENIA? I see that ENIC is exclusive to Chile and this company has all the other neighboring countries. Which one is the better buy and which one is safest? What does Chile withhold from the annual dividend when it is paid to an American investor?
