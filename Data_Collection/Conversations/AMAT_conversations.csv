It seems big WHALE buying AMAT today and could be next week as well in accordance with good news from INTC.
"I took time to analyze all companies in SOX index to select those, which would fit holding during tapering (those, which are not overvalued, profitable and are set to generate good income near-term). Here's my best bets:$KLAC - my best bet and safe-haven. Unlike some other semiconductor equipment manufacturers ($LRCX, $AMAT, $TXN) this one is on the front of the chip miniaturization and its metrology equipment is used in testing and production of 3nm, 5nm and 7nm nodes. This company's further prospects and financials will be very correlated to $ASML, because smaller nodes require more metrology. But KLAC is currently 2-3 times cheaper than ASML fundamentally. Moreover, even if after EUV lithography there will emerge some alternative production equipment for sub-nm nodes and ASML loses its dominance, KLAC still should feel fine because even more metrology will be needed for smaller nodes regardless of production technology - so safe to hold like 10 years ahead.$AMKR - company is on the front of the chip shortage and engaged in production of microchips used in devices, wearables, IoT, vehicles etc. The company is extremely cheap fundamentally, even though it has grown 2x since the pandemic begun. Management comment that it will experience cyclical tailwinds at least through whole 2022 and good results has only started to show up in earnings yet. I expect at least 30% upside here yet going forward but it is not a long-term asset.$MCHP - analog and digital microchip producers, whose products are in high demand right now. Company is again relatively cheap to its peers ($MRVL, $ADI), while management reports 60 weeks lead times on new orders in some categories right now. Everything is essentially booked up 1 year ahead already. Company is about to get a 2:1 stock split too in one week.$INTC - Intel apparently is cheap fundamentally compared to its peers and overall has been beaten down for several quarters. But near-term some positive developments are about to start working. New family of processors on new chipset and new DDR5 memory is poised to be a success starting selling in November. In January Intel will finally release new videocards, which are planned to be competitive this time to $NVDA and $AMD . Also new CEO's plans to engage into fab business goes well with current chip shortage theme. Time will tell if Intel can return its lost share in processors and videocards but the possibility of it should give the stock momentum anyway."
"Saw the Cramer bit on semi cap eqpt. He was very positive towards the sector, saying this was going to grow and grow, as opposed to creating excess capacity then taking a hit when overcapacity happens. His expectation is the digitization of pretty much everything is not so much a trend, it is the way of the world. And it'll continue for a long time. Which, to be blunt, is pretty much saying what I've been saying up here, too. So many things demand chips these days, and the need for compute is increasing exponentially. Just look at vehicles, they'll need the equivalent of 2 computers to handle autonomous driving (the need for redundancy is essential given the vehicle is making all the choices). That'll be 4x the chip count now. For reasons which were pretty weak, he stated a preference for $LRCX over $AMAT, $ASML and $KLAC. But clearly, he was blessing the sector as much as any one stock."

"bought today 5,200 shares...screaming buy...."
"$LRCX validated some analyst fears, that the demand for semi capex has peaked and will start to decline. They've been itching to call a peak in the cycle.I don't think this is the case. At all.As best as I can tell, the industry capacity is constrained and its one company which is the primary constraint -- $ASML. If you can't get another litho tool, you don't need another etcher, or implanter -- the stuff Lam and Applied sell. But the demand for chips remains incredibly strong.Imbalances between chip types are causing modest oversupply. For example, PC capacity is constrained by certain 'limited availability chips', but they are not memory chips. So memory chips are not being ordered to fit demand, but to fit what can be made in the constrained world. Memory-maker Micron will see a sharp increase in demand for its chips once these 'limited availability chips' increase capacity. Same thing exists with vehicles. The 'limited availability chips' determines how many chips a company actually needs right now. It may be just 1 chip out of 100 which is constraining capacity, but that's enough. What happens when that 1 chip adds capacity? The demand for the other 99 will go back up in a hurry.Semi capex may take some hits from this issue (there may also be some supply chain issues Lam, ASML, AMAT face). But this is actually a case where the ""problem"" is really too much demand coupled with some specific supply imbalances, not too little. So ASML is the key semi capex player in meeting demand since its the constraint. But every ASML litho tool delivery means more etchers, implanters, etc. My sense is the ASML tools have long lead times since certain items are likely to be very long lead time (EUV optics don't come from Lenscrafters ...)The underlying story couldn't be more bullish. Some analysts think they see a peak. But given the structural demand for chips, they are wrong."
"BIG companies e/r like GOOGLE, MSFT, FB,ETC will all boost whole market up instantly in a matter of today / tomorrow...ever...BUY MORE...."
Probably AMAT consolidating and moving up FAST from $136.00 and beyond due to good news from INTC.
Good earnings from $amd and $msft . Both are relatively flat after hours. Investors were supposedly 'nervous' about these earnings and they were both great. $amat and $lrcx remain range bound and in consolidation mode. Perhaps AMD's conference call will give some insight on CAPEX.
I am sick of all the spam on yahoo! I actually try to stay off of the AMAT message board now and exclusively use http://the-alphatrader.com/
"Now with a forward PE of 15 and a PEG of only 0.75. AMAT is significantly undervalued and at a time when there's likely never been more growth and expansion in the industry. AMAT themselves have said profit alone is expected to grow almost 50% going forward. Once the market gets over it's overreaction phase, I expect a significant movement for this stock."
$AMAT has been talking about 60% of growth in their process control. $KLAC has just reported 71% growth in their main equipment category! it continues to strengthen its leadership in metrology. I bet it will be surpass 400$ soon.
"For the past 6 months AMAT is struggling to hold between the 135 and 140 range in a market where supply/demand can't be met and chip shortage is growing. It's still one of my preferred positions in my portfolio, the lack of sustainable growth in share price is a little bit concerning at the moment. Also, chip producers like Intel are beating expectations and still investors aren't satisfied. -12% because the revenue target was missed by a fraction, it makes no sense."
"The market and the analyst have created a ""cycle peak"" narrative for the semi equipment space. TSM just said......not so fast. we see strong capacity expansion for chips AND equipment continuing THRU 2022. The market will adjust to the NEW narrative . All chip and chip equipment stock can go 15-20% higher in the next 6 months."
sellers under $138 will greatly regretted later on...
"AMAT makes great machines. Maybe the best. Where do those machines get used? Taiwan, China, South Korea, and other high-tech hubs. But, sadly, not a whole lot in the US. For decades, the training necessary to be proficient in using AMAT's technology has been entirely ""overseas.""Until the US ramps of education of systems engineers that can use AMAT's technology, the US will not be competitive. I am long AMAT, very long. Like 3-5 years out, when American Universities start graduating ""chip foundry"" engineers by the hundreds.jmvho, amirite?"
"the more money a company make the lower its share price, my phd thesis just cleared the acad board...! buy companies that burn cash and u be rich"
"I have watched all investor master classes from $AMAT. I do really recommend them to get a feeling of what trends are shaping up in WFE market. What I understood is that variability of equipment and steps to produce modern chips is increasing. There are new types of processes, which are getting traction like epitaxy, ion implantation, selective etching etc. All these processes are about adding or removing materials to wafers in vacuum. $MKSI is a company, whose main clients are $LRCX and $AMAT and they provide them with subsystems that are used to deliver or remove that material in vacuum. If $LRCX and $AMAT will be growing so will $MKSI's business. But I prefer this company as investment because it is simply cheaper right now and at 1.5-2 times better multiples."
"Listening to bloomberg... They often mention semi equipment companies $LRCX, $AMAT, $ASML but never $KLAC. Even from daily pre-market you can judge that this company is not well-known. Even though it outperforms them in quarterly growth and forecasts too and analysts are more bullish here than there... I guess we need more time and more outperforming quarters before market notices that metrology is outperforming."

Huge buying opportunity!!!
LOADED 4.8K SHARES WITH IDEALLY UNDERVALUED TODAY !
I see a lot of “Recent” posts today on this AMAT board with screams to sell AMAT. These are posters I haven’t seen on this board before. I can’t help but think they might be getting pinched today with options expiration?
"unbelievable! mute one guy, cleans up the whole board!"
Today growing because of Intel's announcement on significant capex expansion over next 3 years. Confirms growth for WFE market in 2022. $AMAT $KLAC $LRCX $ASML $TER.
"Semiconductor sector is hot! Don't let the intermittent pullbacks sway your positions. Global semiconductor sales are up big. Up 30% yoy and over 3% month to month, according to SIA. Just about all semiconductor and equipment companies are offering strong guidance going forward with no indication of weakness anytime soon. Most claiming they see the shortage lasting through 2022 ($MRVL the most recent). This shortage combined with the global expansion taking place AND the evolution of the industry's super ""cycle"" indicates a strong long term outlook for the industry. Who stands to benefit the most? TSM of course. Along with $ASML with their monopoly on advanced EUV that's in great demand by anyone wanting to compete in producing advanced semiconductors. $AMAT is the most diversified equipment provider. $KLAC is the dominant PDC supplier. MRVL for (5G and Data Center) infrastructure. $LRCX for memory. $ICHR and $UCTT are extreme value plays right now as well that benefit from having the companies listed above as customers. GLTA!"
AMAT 'll rocket up beyond $146 this week for sure...buy...buy...
Strong day considering the negative reaction to the good report from $lrcx . Both stocks recovered much of the earlier selloff.
under $136 is ideal / a SCREAMING BUY....
"Didn't know the good news from INTC, probably it 's time to buy more at 135.9 up..."
"A lot of people on here complaining because they bought at $139 and are wondering why we can't hit new highs. Complaining about manipulation, and why we can't keep up with one index or another. Meanwhile those who own this stock since $60 from last year are grinning and wondering what all the complaining is about"
Intel confirming large CAPEX spending in 2022. Along with many others. Applied and $lrcx are going to do well even with some of the constraints. They will ease as such industries will be top priority for materials. The growth is going to be very large IMO.
Sell now before it sink down again with nasdaq back to its low this early morning as INTC has trouble with its e/r yesterday...
sell now is GOLD...Holding is loosing your Gain in a matter of one day....I absolutely agreed w others .
SELL and SELL SHORT TO earn and secure your portfolio...
"Micron announces they will spend more than $150B to expand memory chip production which accounts for 30% of the semiconductor market. In addition JPM came out saying they like the chip equipment space. If you have a longer term perspective you can buy any of the chip equipment stocks right here. (LRCX, AMAT, KLAC, ASML........etc)"
just loaded 1700 shares after sold w good gain....as it could move up from here due to good news from INTC...
"ASML sees revenue growth growing at an 11% average rate through 2030. While 11% may not shoot the lights out in any one year, a compounded 11% growth rate over 10 years is extremely good and difficult for most companies to achieve, especially those already as large as ASML. Throw in annual share repurchases and a rising dividend, and ASML's stock looks like an unstoppable compounder for the next decade."
"AMAT shares have gone sideways for around 7 months. Overall industry is growing. It will take a couple more quarters to get a clearer picture of how government investment schemes will play out on overall CAPEX spend. In general, AMAT will participate in a long period of secular growth and still boasts the world's largest installed base with a subscription-like service business. There is a lot to be liked here. Long term holders will be rewarded !!"
Up beyond $140 anytime soon for sure this week...Screaming buy today...
