"first time buyer ,hope 126.00 is a good price"
8/19/2021 FYI---Diawa Securities started coverage this morning with an OUTPERFORM rating and a $140 PT.
"AMAT is my largest holding, so the idea of buying more on this pullback is a bit daunting. Still, if it goes down much further, I'd consider. AMAT is at a forward P/E in the mid-teens.Expect about $1.80 eps when they report next week, do the math and the P/E is 17 if they merely hold that profitability. But they are expected to grow more profitable, $8+ eps is not that far out in the future. PEG well under 1. In other words, this is dirt cheap compared to the rest of the market. And it'll still be cheap at $160."
Waiting for it to reach $129 then buy and wait for November action. That's when the pendulum swings the other way.
"Here it comes again under-valued, just bought 5.2k shares. Thanks for the high volatility"
"The shares of Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) have received a price target of $165 from DA Davidson. And DA Davidson analyst Thomas Diffely is maintaining a “Buy” rating on the company shares."
"TSM is undervalued here, been consolidating since March, and is due for a breakout. It's the most advanced semiconductor company that all the big boys utilize ($NVDA, $AMD, $QCOM, $APPL, $AVGO, ARM, $INTC) and have all given very positive future outlooks. It is rapidly growing and expanding it's operations in an attempt to try and meet extreme demand. It's unrivaled 3nm process is fully booked for the next two years and production on the 2nm process is set to begin in 2023. The chip shortage has greatly contributed to a super cycle with semiconductors. The global expansion will ensure massive semiconductor growth for years and technologies like 5G, IoT, AI, and EV only reemphasizes their long term importance. Semiconductor equipment manufacturers like $ASML, $AMAT, $KLAC, and $UCTT all stand to greatly benefit from this global growth and expansion by all semiconductor manufacturers like TSM."
"Chip shortage is similar to the oil shortage in the 1970's. To stop inflationary pressure, supply must increase. High prices and high levels of demand are good for chip industry.https://www.barrons.com/articles/chip-shortage-stocks-economy-51629507891?mod=hp_LEAD_1"
"Absolutely incredible quarter. $1.90 EPS, $1.77 expected. Up 41% yoy. $6.2B revenue, $5.9B expected. Up 71% yoy. Plus guides higher next quarter. No denying semiconductor growth."
Agreement with Taiwan is going to mean ALOT of CAPX spending is gonna be happening in Arizona over the next few years.
"great company, great biz, great earnings, great future.AMAT has $6+billion in share buyback authorization and it is days like today, when it drops despite delivering a brilliant earnings report, that you hope they buy back shares. My guess is that AMAT will double its dividend within the next year. Its earning nearly $2/quarter, it can afford a dividend of nearly $2 per year. I can't rationalize a share price this low. This is among the cheapest high tech stocks in the world, along with $KLAC, $LRCX and a few others who play big in this space. PEG ratio of 0.2?!!!! Forward PE of 15-ish. Strong balance sheet. Huge growth opportunities as AI starts to take hold. And numerous major nations deciding they're under-invested in IC technology. The story couldn't be better and the shares have rarely been cheaper."
I did a double take when I saw the low volume so far today on AMAT.Lam is also way below average volume today.
AMAT senior management is participating in 5 conferences (fireside chats) with the major brokerage houses in the next 5 weeks. I think they have a positive story to tell and are anxious to get out there and tell it.
Gregory it was a huge factor every xdiv date with the same amount because AMAT is such a great company
AMAT is a growth company. It deserves a P/E of 25. It can earn $8 in the coming year. My target is 200 (=$8X25).
"Record quarterly revenue of $6.20 billion, up 41 percent year over yearRecord quarterly GAAP operating margin of 32.5 percent and record non-GAAP operating margin of 32.7 percent, up 7.3 points and 6.3 points year over year, respectivelyRecord quarterly GAAP EPS of $1.87 and record non-GAAP EPS of $1.90, up 105 percent and 79 percent year over year, respectively"
"Next week is AMAT's ER. This is very suspect to have an unknown research firm called Trendforce come out with a negative story in the Investors Business Daily (IBD). When AMAT reports and the stock moves up to $150 Trendforce will not be able to be found anywhere, and the ""retail investors"" will be the ones that get hurt. Instead I am buying."
I would love to see this ticker fill the gap back up to $135. I'm surprised it's not taking off like a rocket after that earnings report and all the analyst upgrades.
"Dallas Fed official Robert Kaplan on CNBC just now and referring to the semi shortage. He was saying the demand for semis continues to grow faster than the supply and that the semi shortage will last longer than most people think. This guy gets GREAT industry information from many (diverse) sources. I would rather listen to him than analyst, hedge fund managers, research firms and day traders, all of whom have their own agendas."
"Next Resistance: $137.61/s, RSI(14): 45.30. Lots of room to move up. Lets go and load up. Peace and cheers!"
And so the day starts strong for AMAT on both volume and price. Compare to yesterday’s weak volume. Perhaps The financial media and in turn the trading houses and fund managers are giving in to the facts of the recent ER and guidanceLove him or hate him even Cramer piped in that AMAT is “buyable”.
"Share price at close was 129. In the cc, mgmt pretty much told us they'd make over $8/share in the year ahead. So we're looking at a forward P/E of 16. For a lot of the market, if you can get a PEG under 2, that's a steal. AMAT's PEG is 0.2 (16 PE / 90% growth in EPS) !!! And it serves the most important industry of our time -- it is one of the few companies the world literally can not do without. So compare excerpts from these two quarterly statements:1. xxx reported record revenue for the second quarter ended August 1, 2021, of $6.51 billion, up 68 percent from a year earlier and up 15 percent from the previous quarter ...GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.94, up 276 percent from a year ago and up 24 percent from the previous quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.04, up 89 percent from a year ago and up 14 percent from the previous quarter.vs2. yyy generated revenue of $6.20 billion. On a GAAP basis, the company recorded gross margin of 47.9 percent, operating income of $2.01 billion or 32.5 percent of net sales, and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.87.On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, the company reported gross margin of 48.0 percent, operating income of $2.03 billion or 32.7 percent of net sales, and EPS of $1.90. Record quarterly GAAP EPS of $1.87 and record non-GAAP EPS of $1.90, up 105 percent and 79 percent year over year, respectively.************So ----- Which looks better? The first company is NVIDIA. AMAT is the second. AMAT is obviously a key part the NVIDIA supply chain (via TSMC). AMAT's earnings are almost double NVIDIA's. The growth rates of both are exceptional, both nearly doubling non-GAAP earnings over the prior year. AMAT, with non-GAAP earnings of $1.90, has a share price of about $130NVIDIA, with non-GAAP earnings of $1.04 has a share price of about $200NVDA has about 1/2 the earnings and yet, it has a 50% higher share price!!AMAT shares are a steal at $130 -- and they'd still be a steal at $200. But the market seems to think the story has too much risk. Even though CSCO said just yesterday, their own earnings are going to a bit more modest because chip demand is so high and they need to pay up for the chips they need. I've long thought AMAT is going to finish the year above $180. And it should, its crushing it. But the market reaction is so blah. I'm not sure what to make of this. The company if terrific. The stock, not so much."
Today after hours all shorted shares have to be covered
Strongly believe AMAT will be 140+ soon
The real pop back up above $140 is coming soon.
"134 here we go, next leg up to 140"
"AMAT had positive momentum mid-morning today, then the terrible news about the Kabul International Airport bombing came out, volitility increased and the majority NASDAQ stocks went down and remains down. However, AMAT is demonstrating resiliency and should end the day on + side."
I have never listened to an Applied Materials earnings call before. What a class act! I learned so much about the semiconductor landscape in one hour. Amazing. Not to mention what great prospects for AMAT going forward.
AMAT guides revenues higher for next quarter. Big blocks on the bid bodes well.
"Again take analysts with a grain of salt, but these new released targets are all 20-40% higher than our current price. Even Morgan Stanley increased their price target. This is such a discount now!JP Morgan raises target price to $173 from $160Mizuho raises target price to $161 from $158Stifel raises target price to $180 from $170 Morgan Stanley raises target price to $150 from $139"
"All shares need to be purchased by Monday to be eligible for the dividend, which means AMAT will be going up and shares also need to be returned from shorts by Monday which means AMAT WILL BE GOING UP EVEN MORE"
"Motley article on AMAT just released an hour ago: “If Data Is the New Oil, This Stock Will Soar”"
"Cramer likes us.. I don't know how to feel about that.. he can be the kiss of death, but I know fundamentally AMAT is strong, so I will not protest your pump.. seems that Trader won the last ER battle but Lawrence and the longs may win the next ER. My meaningless p/t is $155-160 by eoy."
P/E of 26.74 and solid growth over the next decade has me looking for an entry point in AMAT.Buy when no one else wants it.
"Once again, AMAT hits the $140 area and gets rejected. Happened in April, in early June, in late June and now again in August. Still think the prospects are terrific, but what could they possibly say in their earnings which would get this thing to breakout?Even the Micron story (memory pricing softening) doesn't really add up. Micron just reported their order filling time is at a record high, 20 weeks, meaning they aren't keeping up with demand. How does 'not keeping up with demand' = 'weakness ahead'? I get a sense the market is wanting to pounce on bad news for $LRCX, $KLAC, $AMAT and others -- as if they want to get ahead of some big downward spiral. But that isn't coming, demand is explosive and huge new markets are still early. 5G phones have barely begun to sell. Autonomous driving is a few years from adding massive new demand. Computational medicine is bigger than almost any chip market ever -- and that's coming, too. The markets can't drive it down too much while the results are stellar. But forward P/E in the mid-teens makes zero sense. Not when the upside is so large. So I expect continued aggressive buybacks and stellar results. And perhaps some day, the fearful will realize that chips are essential to the future, and stop the downward pressure on these excellent companies."
i need to stop watching the premarket
VERY STRONG results and raised the revenue guide for the next quarter. This will pull the whole semi cap equipment sector forward tomorrow. Remember there still IS a chip shortage. GL
Tomorrow is the last day to buy a stock to get dividends
Price action and stock price today is practically the same as after earnings last May. Believe it's a buying oppurtunity.
So Gerry did you buy AMAT before the ER like you postulated yesterday? I bought those calls earlier and am glad I did. The lack of hard positive AM action shows a delayed response so you still have time to buy. I agree with Mike that the Forward PE now makes this Equity a confirmed value buy.
