AMAT clipped the top bollinger band today and has had three upward progressive higher highs on healthy volumes. Incremental yes. Persistence to a possible breakthrough ? All the positive vectors are there. We’ll see as we approach this Friday’s option expirations.
"Not sure how market respond but any good news of coronavirus vaccince could be bullish for the market, it could reach record high again....."
"At this point, any downgrade should be looked at as an attempt to drive the price lower because the big boys want in at an even lower price. Even though currently this is arguably the cheapest of all semiconductor equipment stocks and the one likely benefiting most from industry/global expansion and spending."
HEY Trader! THE VOLATILITY HAS BEEN WIDELY BROADCAST! EVERYONE HERE KNOWS WHAT HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE!
"sell now , don't wait until its AMAT e/r , sure it'll sink like LRCX like yesterday as it belongs to semi group...."
AMAT 'll rocket up beyond $146 this week for sure...buy...buy...
Why is AMAT down today..morning 10-26-21? It has dipped below $134??Any news why the drop???
CEO sold .32m stocks out of 1.7m.CFO sold 43K out of 140K shares.SVP Om N sold 52K out of 135K shares.SVP Gino A sold 40K out of 250K shares.
"Okay. The Treasury yield went up and ""long duration"" stocks that rely on future earnings (i.e. AMAT and other semi's) take a hit. So what? I'm not a day trader and see today's drop as a buying opportunity. I'm long on AMAT because they have a solid business model. Grabbed some more shares @ $133."
BUY AND HOLD FOR GREAT...GREAT PROFITS BY THE TOMORROW !!!!!!!!
This downgrade is a scam for them to load up as the price drops. AMAT has plenty of backlog and future demand.
"Motley article on AMAT just released an hour ago: “If Data Is the New Oil, This Stock Will Soar”"
It seems a lot of investors load up any below $136...
"No dividend increase?!? woof, that's not great when two of your biggest competitors LRCX and KLAC raise theirs. They are in the exact same cash position as well so I wonder why they chose not to... well let's hope they increase the buyback, I would rather that honestly."
Today growing because of Intel's announcement on significant capex expansion over next 3 years. Confirms growth for WFE market in 2022. $AMAT $KLAC $LRCX $ASML $TER.
due to psychological buying alone. $AMAT $VENA
"HEY Trader! WHAT ARE THE STOPS? OH, THIS IS JUST YOUR MAKE BELIEVE! YOU LACK THE KNOWLEDGE OF BEING AN INVESTOR!Trader6 minutes agoAt close stops will come out...."
I see a lot of “Recent” posts today on this AMAT board with screams to sell AMAT. These are posters I haven’t seen on this board before. I can’t help but think they might be getting pinched today with options expiration?
We ain't going anywhere . $AMAT $VENA
Phil: Good analysis and a good reason for long term investors to hang on to AMAT as a quality growth stock. The demand issue as you describe is a unique complexity that creates an unusual opportunity to buy as the short term investors and momentum traders look to exit near term and by doing so put AMAT within target range for value investors to buy. - When? Once AMAT’s price drops to neutral or below the relevant PE ratios
Sure feels like there is a large block of shares with a sell order at around $140 resulting in a price ceiling. Been going on for awhile where the share price just can't seem to get past this mark. Don't know why...maybe I'm just seeing things incorrectly. Don't care much. Will hold another decade (at least). That should be long enough to get past the $140 threshold.
Should be up back above $135.00 in no time today ...It's a screaming BUY now...
Once again we break the $140/share mark. Can we hold it this time and keep going higher?
HEY Trader! ANSWER YOUR OWN QUESTION!Trader6 minutes agoNasdaq trying to hold 1 1/2 % ?
Surely an ugly day for most investors today. I own a few AMAT and have done well. I added a few a few months back and today I added a few more. Chips are now in everything and demand has outstripped supply and I see AMAT playing a significant role in the chip industry. Thoughts. God Bless and stay well.
"Obviously, the recent China saber rattling over Taiwan doesn’t help nor the dubious downgrades AMAT got."
They tell me China retail sales growth collapsing in August from 7% to 2.5%This can't be good news for Broadcom can it ?30% of avgo revenues from ChIna..Watch out for big dump this afternoon....Less

GREAT presentation at the virtual JPM Champions Conference. Go to AMAT's website and listen to it.
Wow. Another broken yahoo message board. Only takes one or two crazies to chase away true investors.
Trading Central suggests the following technical events as of today:- As long as 142.6 is resistance look for 121.6- Alternative scenario is if above 142.6 look for 149.5 and 153.6Sticking with AMAT to at least $150!

sellers under $138 will greatly regretted later on...
AMAT is the most diverse semiconductor equipment manufacturer. It is under valued with a forward PE of only 17 and a PEG of 0.77! It's also trading about 12% under it's intrinsic fair value of about $153. Earnings are up 80% yoy with sales increasing by 41%.
"HEY Trader! WHAT IS YOUR POINT? AMAT CURRENTLY IN THE GREEN, THIS IS THE IMPORTANT ISSUE!Trader2 minutes agoS&P trying to hold flat."
"8man AMAt now showing down .27!!!!!Who knows it was down eight points for no more than 10 minutes, who knows in any case thank you for responding let’s see what the heck is going on.￼￼￼"
chips are in big demand for................
New street downgraded AMAT and ASML today. By the dip hold long.
Huge buying opportunity!!!
"ASML sees revenue growth growing at an 11% average rate through 2030. While 11% may not shoot the lights out in any one year, a compounded 11% growth rate over 10 years is extremely good and difficult for most companies to achieve, especially those already as large as ASML. Throw in annual share repurchases and a rising dividend, and ASML's stock looks like an unstoppable compounder for the next decade."
Could be $140 by the end of today...
"Never seen a such good opportunity to sell in my lifetime investment on today 's AMAT fake / overreact jump, and for sure it 'll repeat its damp cycle / going down under $130 again no matter what...Just sold all...Thanks GOD helping me in one day today."
Not sure why my comment gets deleted when mentioning about the most recent insider sales at the start of this month. The 'Holders' tab on Yahoo isn't even up-to-date; since July now. I only linked to the SEC filing...lol
"I've seen this movie before. AMAT hits 140 or so, stagnates there and tumbles back into the 130's. A lot of people want to get ahead of the curve -- thinking the biz demand has peaked and we'll see softening demand in the not too distant future. So they get out before this stock tanks.The reality is, AMAT will be filling fabs with equipment for years to come. Demand is increasing at rates which are hard to imagine. In industry after industry, companies are becoming ""compute centric"", built around products designed, made and tested on a computer. Customer contacts developed and maintained on a computer. And in the products themselves, there is more and more embedded compute power. Just had my water meter replaced a few minutes ago, and there's an electronic connection for automated monitoring instead of a meter-reader.Autos are a good example. Compute content is going up exponentially. within vehicles. Its still early on for chip use in entertainment systems, safety systems, fuel efficiency systems, mapping systems, voice recognition systems, various external communications and the big one, autonomous driving. Building vehicles is increasingly done by computer, from managing robots to managing inventories. Design is all computer, parts fabrication is mostly computer and a lot of testing is also computer. Want to be a success selling cars? You'll need to buy enormous numbers of chips. There are more demand drivers than at anytime in history and the demand is going up enormously. And that won't end anytime soon. Even if an imbalance happens and the semi biz winds up with more capacity than it needs, that will be brief. Just too much demand coming from too many directions. AMAT has a massive future, along with LRCX, ASML, KLAC, etc.The market, though, isn't seeing it and I do wonder if it ever will. Because no matter how good these companies are and how incredibly difficult it is for new competitors to emerge, they never seem to get an above average market multiple."
"Very nice close today. Definitely on it's way back over $140. Glad I bought more below $124, but still a good price here."
"Is there any bad news, the equipment stocks as well other stocks in my portfolio are getting hammered hard."
"AMAT remains in the stall I posted about 10 days ago. It’s failed to climb back to the $142 level. Low volume the last two sessions indicates a lack of excitement for this equity. Taiwan is a concern with Chinese fighter jets buzzing its defense perimeters. The shift in analysts sentiment, the fast paced run up in price and AMAT being above its historical average PE are its headwinds presently."

So grateful for the mute button. The last two new posters to AMAT - Yuck.

"This great undervalued at $136 will not last long, just loaded another 3.8k shares . It will be up from here for the rest of today ."
This stock has got to be one of the slowest movers in my portfolio. Just lingers and and trades mostly sideways if you are use to 5 to 10 dollar jumps like a FB or GOOG dont expect it here. Same with TSM very slow mover
"Buy...buy...buy more today , 'll be rewarded as soon as tomorrow / this Friday huge up...."
AMAT down eight points after hours noted on Yahoo finance. Is anyone getting the same?? 5:16 pm e.s.t.Also if this is true what caused the 8 point drop￼????? ￼confused???
It’s like they are trying their hardest to keep these semi stocks down
Why is the price collapsing?
Sold this morning. That was a nice 10% gain in a couple weeks. Thanks AMAT
Some relative strength for AMAT today considering $lrcx was down more than 2%. They rarely diverge like that. I don't see any specific news. Strange.
"Holding on AMAT at its peak / above $135 is killing your portfolio...That is right Selling is GOLD, agreed w others..."
"Anemic volume today, what gives?! Guess a constant parade of upgrades isn't enough?"
"A general rotation out of the tech sector and into hard commodities and energy is contributing to AMAT and others flagging performances. PE ratios are better suited to PPS growth especially those with earnings growth rates. Steel, oil, coal, gas, even fertilizers are in full ascent."
Where all the bulls at? Like if your here.
Just about everything we use daily will have a chip in it. Automobiles alone have 4x times as many chips in them than just a few years ago. That's going to continue to ramp. Demand will grind higher.
"for the last 6 months, AMAT has spent nearly the entire time between 130 and 140, with a few brief dips below and a few brief moments above that range. I have too much AMAT stock, but I have a buy order in in the lower 120's, in case the market does dumb things.It seems there is too much fear of an overcapacity scenario for AMAT shares to run up. But its simply too good a biz and already trading so cheaply that it really won't drop much. So we've got this awkward tension and while it is frustrating, we have a stock trading about a 40% discount to the forward PE of the QQQ. Which means if this does break out and somehow gets the premium (instead of the massive discount) it deserves, a double is within reason."
"The market and the analyst have created a ""cycle peak"" narrative for the semi equipment space. TSM just said......not so fast. we see strong capacity expansion for chips AND equipment continuing THRU 2022. The market will adjust to the NEW narrative . All chip and chip equipment stock can go 15-20% higher in the next 6 months."
"The way the stock price is acting, you'd think that they missed on earnings, revenue, guidance, etc. Maybe I'm expecting too much, but this got over $140 multiple times before earnings, and should be up there again or higher. I have patience, though, and I'm willing to play the long game."
Why did AMAT spike up today ?
AMAT broke its August 20th low and may test its May 12th floor around $115 though I have doubts whether it would sink that low. It is still above it’s historical PE average (16.50) and fighting market sentiment.
"The downgrade is exactly the sort of thing some analysts have been sitting on. They are all trying to catch the inflection point, when the chip mfg biz goes from under-capacity to meeting capacity to over-capacity. So some will jump to downgrades once they perceive we hit peak under-capacity. The first one to jump is the Susquehanna guy. But here's the thing. Even if he is right that we're around the peak under-capacity, it is not at all obvious we'll get to meeting capacity anytime soon. Let alone go too far and have the chip biz hit over-capacity, which is the point equipment orders will slow/delay. Today we have chip shortages in plenty of places. Many are forecasting it'll take a year to fully catch up. And by then, we'll have 5G phones hitting their major growth window, as 5G becomes more useful. Autonomous driving is a few more years out, but after the 5G cycle peaks, these new vehicles will suck up chips at double the rate of most of today's vehicles. And the trend towards digitization isn't slowing down even a little bit. Indeed, its now the ante for most businesses -- if you don't digitize much of your operation, no one will invest in it. And yeah, computational medicine will soak up chips like nothing else in history because biology is really complicated and the computing horsepower needed to solve things like cancers and autoimmune diseases is staggering. All this isn't to suggest that there will never be another cloudy day for AMAT. But they'll be few and far between. And they won't last long either. Because ship consumption is going to grow enormously and for a long time. And they need $AMAT, $LRCX, $KLAC, $ASML, etc to do this. As for AMAT, you can this set-up for a below market multiple!! Geez ..."
It's been so great time loading up more...and more everyone....

KGI Securities UPGRADED both KLAC and AMAT. AMAT price target $160. KLAC price target $420. GLTA
And so the day starts strong for AMAT on both volume and price. Compare to yesterday’s weak volume. Perhaps The financial media and in turn the trading houses and fund managers are giving in to the facts of the recent ER and guidanceLove him or hate him even Cramer piped in that AMAT is “buyable”.

"Another screamming BUY at $132.00,..loaded additional 4.2k shares...."
A PEG of way less than 1. Demand that is not waning. A nice dividend. Bizarro world these days.
"Folks, buy up as this ride is going back over $140!"
What are you scared about? It is so undervalued!!!
"I have watched all investor master classes from $AMAT. I do really recommend them to get a feeling of what trends are shaping up in WFE market. What I understood is that variability of equipment and steps to produce modern chips is increasing. There are new types of processes, which are getting traction like epitaxy, ion implantation, selective etching etc. All these processes are about adding or removing materials to wafers in vacuum. $MKSI is a company, whose main clients are $LRCX and $AMAT and they provide them with subsystems that are used to deliver or remove that material in vacuum. If $LRCX and $AMAT will be growing so will $MKSI's business. But I prefer this company as investment because it is simply cheaper right now and at 1.5-2 times better multiples."
sell now is GOLD...Holding is loosing your Gain in a matter of one day....I absolutely agreed w others .
"New Street Research (never heard of them) downgraded both AMAT & ASML to neutral from buy. These guys are still saying that there is still a semi equipment ""cycle"" and the CAPX spending is nearing it's peak. I think they are wrong and the CAPX spending will be strong thru 2022 at a minimum."
All stops above 133 will disappear today..Today is not the day of buying..Exhortation has to set in all day....LOL
"Suckers create ""panic"" so that they could buy low...it's a good BUY today."
HEY Trade! YOU REALLY HAVE NO CLUE ABOUT ANYTHING!Trader19 minutes agoAt close stops will come out....
I mentioned on this AMAT board that it would test the $132-134 range on this downward oscillation. It did get down to $133 range but did not spend a lot of volume there.Today is options expiration. Anticipate high volume
"So which companies will be hurt the most by the potential downside events driving today's sell-off? Chip equipment will not be immune -- it never is -- but the fundamental demand drivers are not going away. Which means the likely scenario if things go bad is a lull of a quarter or two. Push out of equipment deliveries, not cancellations.Thing is, we had the same sort of reaction in early 2020 at the start of the pandemic. Companies decided there'd be less demand for their products and cut back on chip orders. How'd that work out? Everyone from GM to Cisco to Apple is talking about tight chip supplies. All because of a brief period of fear of excess capacity. This is the more likely ""repeat"" scenario, that a slowdown (or fear of a slowdown) leads to a brief period of underinvestment. 2 quarters of underinvestment takes about 2 years to fix. AMAT and their peer group will be just fine. The underlying story (demand for chips) is incredible, and while risks are out there, few actually decrease the need for chips. Some of the risks actually drive demand for chips.I have no sell orders in, but another buy in the 120's. Because this story is simply too good."
Intel confirming large CAPEX spending in 2022. Along with many others. Applied and $lrcx are going to do well even with some of the constraints. They will ease as such industries will be top priority for materials. The growth is going to be very large IMO.
"I took time to analyze all companies in SOX index to select those, which would fit holding during tapering (those, which are not overvalued, profitable and are set to generate good income near-term). Here's my best bets:$KLAC - my best bet and safe-haven. Unlike some other semiconductor equipment manufacturers ($LRCX, $AMAT, $TXN) this one is on the front of the chip miniaturization and its metrology equipment is used in testing and production of 3nm, 5nm and 7nm nodes. This company's further prospects and financials will be very correlated to $ASML, because smaller nodes require more metrology. But KLAC is currently 2-3 times cheaper than ASML fundamentally. Moreover, even if after EUV lithography there will emerge some alternative production equipment for sub-nm nodes and ASML loses its dominance, KLAC still should feel fine because even more metrology will be needed for smaller nodes regardless of production technology - so safe to hold like 10 years ahead.$AMKR - company is on the front of the chip shortage and engaged in production of microchips used in devices, wearables, IoT, vehicles etc. The company is extremely cheap fundamentally, even though it has grown 2x since the pandemic begun. Management comment that it will experience cyclical tailwinds at least through whole 2022 and good results has only started to show up in earnings yet. I expect at least 30% upside here yet going forward but it is not a long-term asset.$MCHP - analog and digital microchip producers, whose products are in high demand right now. Company is again relatively cheap to its peers ($MRVL, $ADI), while management reports 60 weeks lead times on new orders in some categories right now. Everything is essentially booked up 1 year ahead already. Company is about to get a 2:1 stock split too in one week.$INTC - Intel apparently is cheap fundamentally compared to its peers and overall has been beaten down for several quarters. But near-term some positive developments are about to start working. New family of processors on new chipset and new DDR5 memory is poised to be a success starting selling in November. In January Intel will finally release new videocards, which are planned to be competitive this time to $NVDA and $AMD . Also new CEO's plans to engage into fab business goes well with current chip shortage theme. Time will tell if Intel can return its lost share in processors and videocards but the possibility of it should give the stock momentum anyway."
$AMAT has been talking about 60% of growth in their process control. $KLAC has just reported 71% growth in their main equipment category! it continues to strengthen its leadership in metrology. I bet it will be surpass 400$ soon.

"Listening to bloomberg... They often mention semi equipment companies $LRCX, $AMAT, $ASML but never $KLAC. Even from daily pre-market you can judge that this company is not well-known. Even though it outperforms them in quarterly growth and forecasts too and analysts are more bullish here than there... I guess we need more time and more outperforming quarters before market notices that metrology is outperforming."
"The entire semiconductor sector appears to be under fire from so called ""analysts"" that are actually jack-of-all-trades but masters of NONE. Their archaic thinking in traditional cyclical rotations of the semiconductor industry is forcing stocks prices lower. Even when most chip and equipment companies are crushing earnings, are producing at max capacity, increasing prices, and raising guidance. Global demand would be high regardless of any shortage. 5G, AI, EV, crypto, data centers, cloud tech, gaming, eSports were already ensuring this growth and demand. Now add the new infrastructure spending and the global ""arms race"" that's taking place. We are in the beginning of a super cycle like never seen, likely lasting many years. Semiconductors are the new #1 global resource....the new oil.(Fabless) companies like $NVDA, $AMD, $MRVL, $AVGO, $QCOM design the most advanced and sought after semiconductors in the world. (Fab-owning) companies like $TSM, $TXN, $ADI, $QRVO manufacture the chips. Companies like $AMAT, $ASML, $LRCX, $KLAC, $UCTT, $ICHR make all the equipment and materials used by those chip manufacturers. High tide raises all boats! .....and many of these companies are already currently undervalued. GLTA"
No surprise there 's good news from INTC that cause it pop quickly this morning.
"Just sold all my stucking AMAT position for a long time and move to other security , sure it 'll sink again as its historic chart showing !"
"well, short term it could go up again beyond $140...just loaded up some shares ..."
"if you think the world is gg back to typewriters and petrol car,,pls dump the stock...else load up and xmas this yr will be sweet"
"TODAY IS FRIDAY, IT 'LL NEVER HOLD AT THIS IDEAL FAKE POP...SELLING IS GOLD..."
"great company, great biz, great earnings, great future.AMAT has $6+billion in share buyback authorization and it is days like today, when it drops despite delivering a brilliant earnings report, that you hope they buy back shares. My guess is that AMAT will double its dividend within the next year. Its earning nearly $2/quarter, it can afford a dividend of nearly $2 per year. I can't rationalize a share price this low. This is among the cheapest high tech stocks in the world, along with $KLAC, $LRCX and a few others who play big in this space. PEG ratio of 0.2?!!!! Forward PE of 15-ish. Strong balance sheet. Huge growth opportunities as AI starts to take hold. And numerous major nations deciding they're under-invested in IC technology. The story couldn't be better and the shares have rarely been cheaper."
"bought today 5,200 shares...screaming buy...."
"Congrats to all shorts, be cautious now though. This is turning back to 135-140."
"Long term AMAT can't hold and how could it hold at just one day pop, like today ...Again Sell is GOLD, agreed."

"I think the hardest things for investors is to change there sentiment from bullish to bearish. During these long bull cycles investors get complacent and almost in denial even though the economy has gone into cycles the last 160 years. earnings and the markets don't grow forever. It would be wise for some on this board to watch Ray Dalio's 30 minute online video ""how the economic machine works"""
"Long term its repeat weird cycles up and down between (120, 135..) and for sure it 'll not hold at one day pop...and how it could be..doubt it..."
oversold stock as being called out by more and more analysts! time to buy the dip!!
What are you scared about. It is at so low price?!
"Kiss of death from Jim Cramer for $lrcx and $amat . Calling Lam and the sector long term growth buys. He won't know for sure though until TSM reports. If you're doing your homework, you don't need to wait for that."
"And once again, this hits 140, actually gets thru it for a day, then quickly heads right back to $140. It'll breakout one of these times and head towards $200, but this is about 5th or 6th time this has gotten to 140 and failed to sustain a breakout. At least the good news is there appears to be a floor, when it dips below $130, it recovers quickly."
under $136 is ideal / a SCREAMING BUY....
"IT 'LL NEVER AND NEVER HOLD AT THIS IDEAL LEVEL TODAY...AND THE NEWS IS FOR LONG TERM 3 YRS AHEAD, IT MEANINGLESS IF HOLDING ...AS IT 'LL FOR SURE SINK BELOW $130 AGAIN NEXT WEEK, IF NOT SAYING TODAY IN AFTER HOURS....SELL IS BEST, IS GOLD AS ITS MASSIVE REPEATING CYCLES WEIRDLY FROM ITS HISTORIC CHARGE REGARDLESS OF NASDAQ UP OR DOWN..."
Coiled spring. PE is more than reasonable and will shrink with the coming growth. We'll see what happens.
I am sick of all the spam on yahoo! I actually try to stay off of the AMAT message board now and exclusively use http://the-alphatrader.com/
"A lot of people on here complaining because they bought at $139 and are wondering why we can't hit new highs. Complaining about manipulation, and why we can't keep up with one index or another. Meanwhile those who own this stock since $60 from last year are grinning and wondering what all the complaining is about"
Stay patient for $131 and then load up

"Welcome reversal for AMAT this morning. Let's hope it's not a dreaded dead cat bounce. Even if so, AMAT is a long term hold that will pay off."
"Saw the Cramer bit on semi cap eqpt. He was very positive towards the sector, saying this was going to grow and grow, as opposed to creating excess capacity then taking a hit when overcapacity happens. His expectation is the digitization of pretty much everything is not so much a trend, it is the way of the world. And it'll continue for a long time. Which, to be blunt, is pretty much saying what I've been saying up here, too. So many things demand chips these days, and the need for compute is increasing exponentially. Just look at vehicles, they'll need the equivalent of 2 computers to handle autonomous driving (the need for redundancy is essential given the vehicle is making all the choices). That'll be 4x the chip count now. For reasons which were pretty weak, he stated a preference for $LRCX over $AMAT, $ASML and $KLAC. But clearly, he was blessing the sector as much as any one stock."
HEY Trader! WHAT IS AMAT'S CURRENT PRICE? YOU POSTED THE FOLLOWING 3 DAYS AGO! LMAO!Trader3 days ago$AMAT conversationAll stops above 133 will disappear today..Today is not the day of buying..Exhortation has to set in all
Added some more at 128 yesterday before close
Good earnings from $amd and $msft . Both are relatively flat after hours. Investors were supposedly 'nervous' about these earnings and they were both great. $amat and $lrcx remain range bound and in consolidation mode. Perhaps AMD's conference call will give some insight on CAPEX.
"This has gone nowhere for 5 months, as the business ""caught up"" with the earlier surge in share price. This will start moving up again soon. Business in solid share for years to come. Long term holders will be rewarded nicely."
Strong day considering the negative reaction to the good report from $lrcx . Both stocks recovered much of the earlier selloff.
"unbelievable! mute one guy, cleans up the whole board!"

Probably AMAT consolidating and moving up FAST from $136.00 and beyond due to good news from INTC.
"For the past 6 months AMAT is struggling to hold between the 135 and 140 range in a market where supply/demand can't be met and chip shortage is growing. It's still one of my preferred positions in my portfolio, the lack of sustainable growth in share price is a little bit concerning at the moment. Also, chip producers like Intel are beating expectations and still investors aren't satisfied. -12% because the revenue target was missed by a fraction, it makes no sense."
135 Guaranteed for next week. 140 is very likely.
"China is staying firm that Taiwan belongs to China. If we go to war with China (over Taiwan) it could put a lot of disruption in the chips supply chain as other countries around the world all scramble to replace the chip capacity out of TSM. Better get those ""regional"" fabs for every country in the world on a FASTER construction schedule."
Funny to see all the shorts panicking. Been holding for years. This is by far the best strategy. Has served me extremely well.
"nice moving in pre-market, hold strong $AMAT $VENA"
Lawrence.
"BIG companies e/r like GOOGLE, MSFT, FB,ETC will all boost whole market up instantly in a matter of today / tomorrow...ever...BUY MORE...."
whom never had anything in the first place. We’re good! $AMAT $VENA
"Semiconductor sector is hot! Don't let the intermittent pullbacks sway your positions. Global semiconductor sales are up big. Up 30% yoy and over 3% month to month, according to SIA. Just about all semiconductor and equipment companies are offering strong guidance going forward with no indication of weakness anytime soon. Most claiming they see the shortage lasting through 2022 ($MRVL the most recent). This shortage combined with the global expansion taking place AND the evolution of the industry's super ""cycle"" indicates a strong long term outlook for the industry. Who stands to benefit the most? TSM of course. Along with $ASML with their monopoly on advanced EUV that's in great demand by anyone wanting to compete in producing advanced semiconductors. $AMAT is the most diversified equipment provider. $KLAC is the dominant PDC supplier. MRVL for (5G and Data Center) infrastructure. $LRCX for memory. $ICHR and $UCTT are extreme value plays right now as well that benefit from having the companies listed above as customers. GLTA!"
Calling Susquehanna......was that you buying today on your downgrade? Sure was a nice gain on high volume.
Check the infographic. 71% YoY growth in main equipment category! $AMAT has reported only 60% growth in metrology segment. So $KLAC continues to strengthen its leadership in process control.
"AMAT shares have gone sideways for around 7 months. Overall industry is growing. It will take a couple more quarters to get a clearer picture of how government investment schemes will play out on overall CAPEX spend. In general, AMAT will participate in a long period of secular growth and still boasts the world's largest installed base with a subscription-like service business. There is a lot to be liked here. Long term holders will be rewarded !!"
"The fear of a further fall will be gone by the end of the week when we are back at 142, when y’all are buying again cause it “looks strong” and I’m buying puts."
Picked up shares on this dip
Those who got fooled by analysts 'll be fully regretted when sell today...They just playing a whole b.s roller coaster games...Meaning it'll move up fast after down too low like today's date....
Base on this a lot of shorts sellers are trap and they want you to sell. Mmm ok lol
I am so tired of AMAT doing nothing all day. Can you move??? I have been reading http://alert-sounds.com/ for a month now and the stocks there actually go!
Congrats to those buying on the dip near $125 again. I threw a lot in the other day near $124. Just give it a little time. This is a great company to be invested in for the long run (& short run). I've got over 900 shares in the last year plus and will keep buying.
"All sellers seems exhausted, they even start buying back and push AMAT even up faster than ever ! Could beyond $140 anytime soon today ! buy and buy !"
I don’t understand why are they keeping this stock down on a powerful day like this. So frustrating!
$AMAT $NFLX $WIMI What are your expectations? Are you willing to share with a fellow investor. Appreciate your willingness to do so
Great day.. still my favourite large cap semi play.. setting up to break ATH before ER
"Good grief, every time this sees 140, it acts like its seen a ghost and retreats. There's nothing wrong with the company, its really everything one might want (fast growth, essential biz in an essential industry, well-run, highly profitable, solid balance sheet, etc).Bizarrely its selling for less than market multiples. Appears Wall St is spooked by past history of overcapacity leading to harsh down cycles, even though its hard to see a genuinely harsh down cycle anytime in the next decade -- just too many things need chips (with more coming like AI, autonomous driving, computational medical, etc) and you can't build chips without boatloads of AMAT eqpt. On top of all this, there are governments wanting to insure they have native capacity. And chip users who realize that they need to rethink the value of chips in their supply chain -- they are too important to simply bid down prices. That reliable chip supply is essential and worth paying for rather than getting a low price today and being shut out of supply tomorrow."
"Well I still see semi's are etting mistreated.....and they were already bargains before this market temper tantrum. Now they are just insanely cheap! Should be a great time to buy. They are going to bounce back up as soon as everyone realizes their concerns about the industry's ""cycle"" is not happening. We are still in the beginning of a decade or more long super cycle. The industry has evolved! $TSM $KLAC $ASML $AMAT $QRVO $UCTT $ICHR $MRVL"
"$LRCX validated some analyst fears, that the demand for semi capex has peaked and will start to decline. They've been itching to call a peak in the cycle.I don't think this is the case. At all.As best as I can tell, the industry capacity is constrained and its one company which is the primary constraint -- $ASML. If you can't get another litho tool, you don't need another etcher, or implanter -- the stuff Lam and Applied sell. But the demand for chips remains incredibly strong.Imbalances between chip types are causing modest oversupply. For example, PC capacity is constrained by certain 'limited availability chips', but they are not memory chips. So memory chips are not being ordered to fit demand, but to fit what can be made in the constrained world. Memory-maker Micron will see a sharp increase in demand for its chips once these 'limited availability chips' increase capacity. Same thing exists with vehicles. The 'limited availability chips' determines how many chips a company actually needs right now. It may be just 1 chip out of 100 which is constraining capacity, but that's enough. What happens when that 1 chip adds capacity? The demand for the other 99 will go back up in a hurry.Semi capex may take some hits from this issue (there may also be some supply chain issues Lam, ASML, AMAT face). But this is actually a case where the ""problem"" is really too much demand coupled with some specific supply imbalances, not too little. So ASML is the key semi capex player in meeting demand since its the constraint. But every ASML litho tool delivery means more etchers, implanters, etc. My sense is the ASML tools have long lead times since certain items are likely to be very long lead time (EUV optics don't come from Lenscrafters ...)The underlying story couldn't be more bullish. Some analysts think they see a peak. But given the structural demand for chips, they are wrong."
"And fwiw, share price is back to where it was ... 12 days ago. Lots of perceived drama here, very little actual drama"
"It's way overbought, overextended intraday. If it doesn't correct some before the close, the sellers will arrive in droves tomorrow and next week. I see this as a short covering rally."
"Yeah, hit my limit buy order minutes before close. They really didn't want it to hit 128.00 did they. That's a lesson never use whole dollars for limit buy/sell."
"Didn't know the good news from INTC, probably it 's time to buy more at 135.9 up..."
"New to this Stock: I would like to go in but at what price - any conviction thesis, por favor??"
"HEY Trader! AS ALWAYS, YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE OR FACTS TO SUPPORT YOUR CURRENT SELF-SERVING BOGUS CLAIMS!Trader57 seconds agoVolatility is Setting up from here to close...Trader6 minutes agoWatch the DOW at closing...."

LOADED 4.8K SHARES WITH IDEALLY UNDERVALUED TODAY !
"Hate to say the Micron news (soft forecast) will hurt AMAT tomorrow. But it will. Thing is, the Micron news actually demonstrates how the chip shortage is actually holding back demand. ""A slowing of orders from PC makers is a short-term issue, according to Mehrotra. Some of his customers are struggling to get other types of components, meaning they can’t build all of the laptops and desktops that have been ordered. That’s led them to reduce memory inventory. The situation will reverse when industrywide shortages ease in the coming months, he said.""This is a big issue. If you need 100 different chips to build a module, but you can only get 99 of those chips, you can't build the module. So there's no need to keep building inventory for those other 99 chips until the 1 in short supply becomes available. Micron is saying demand is there for the PCs (ie backlog building), but specific chip shortages means companies can't meet the demand, so they order less chips across the board. As the shortage ends, demand jumps because of the backlog for PCs. This news is actually positive for AMAT because it says end market demand is strong and it is the end markets which drive demand. But that isn't how I expect the Micron news to get interpreted."
It seems stable and move up from ~136.00 up...
I sold yesterday at $143.75. I had a nice profit from $131 average. Limited upside and too much downside risk led me to sell.
So much for 'the chip shortage is over' narrative. Apple just blew that theory up. $lrcx and $amat will do well. $aapl

Western digital imploding pre-market...51.20 -6.08 (-10.61%) wow  wow wowPre-Market: 07:53AM EDT
AMAT is too promising a company to see a price surge..instead look for companies with PE of 500 and u will get 100000% gain
It seems big WHALE buying AMAT today and could be next week as well in accordance with good news from INTC.
"AMAT makes great machines. Maybe the best. Where do those machines get used? Taiwan, China, South Korea, and other high-tech hubs. But, sadly, not a whole lot in the US. For decades, the training necessary to be proficient in using AMAT's technology has been entirely ""overseas.""Until the US ramps of education of systems engineers that can use AMAT's technology, the US will not be competitive. I am long AMAT, very long. Like 3-5 years out, when American Universities start graduating ""chip foundry"" engineers by the hundreds.jmvho, amirite?"
whats going on today? it was over 140 earlier.
The climb
"Cramer likes us.. I don't know how to feel about that.. he can be the kiss of death, but I know fundamentally AMAT is strong, so I will not protest your pump.. seems that Trader won the last ER battle but Lawrence and the longs may win the next ER. My meaningless p/t is $155-160 by eoy."
"Micron announces they will spend more than $150B to expand memory chip production which accounts for 30% of the semiconductor market. In addition JPM came out saying they like the chip equipment space. If you have a longer term perspective you can buy any of the chip equipment stocks right here. (LRCX, AMAT, KLAC, ASML........etc)"
I just snagged 100 shares. Hard to beat below $124. It'll be over $140 at some point before end of the year.
"the more money a company make the lower its share price, my phd thesis just cleared the acad board...! buy companies that burn cash and u be rich"
Sell now before it sink down again with nasdaq back to its low this early morning as INTC has trouble with its e/r yesterday...
clearly the world is ruled by invisible forces...evergrande saga cause the entire world market in turmoil?! come on AMAT makes chips machine not cement mixer!
Why is this plunging today!
