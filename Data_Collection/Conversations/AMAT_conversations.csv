Being dragged down by overreaction of $MU. We will recover. Good time to grab a few more shares.
"Credit Suisse re-iterated a $175 price target today with an Outperform rating. Unchanged from before, but still a far cry from where we find ourselves now. Those absolute turds at Morgan Stanley kept their equal-weight rating. Can anyone that has access to their reports share more details? Price Target? For reference I couldn't give a tiny rat's #$%$ what they actually say but it does drive institutional investors one way or the other."
"hope we go up next week, calm before the storm, at this rate every damn stock i own is down and getting beat down everyday and they all post great profits and future outlook. The funny thing is i own one looser and it the only green one in my portfolio. Goes to show you its just a game of manipulation being played day in and out. Fundamentals do not have anything to do with making money anymore. What a turd the market is, i am afraid to open my 401k and see how much its fallen the past month. Blue Chips = massive losses and turds = big buck$$$$$$$$$$$"
HOLD AND ADD2 days after May's earning AMAT went up almost 10.00
The real pop back up above $140 is coming soon.
TSMC just reported that their June quarter revenue was up 23% YoY. Then United Microelectronics said that the chip shortage will likely last into 2023. ALL the chip equipment stocks are still very cheap right now. Add if you can. GLTA

Dude calls are being bought by the millions WOW LOADING AND LOADING AND LOADING MORE SHARES
AMAT once again is a SCREAMING BUY now as it just hit $130 level again....should rocket up to $140 by tomorrow again....
"Always entertaining to check in on these forums with my August of 1996 cost basis of $3.17 a share. Get rich slowly, as they say...."
When is it a good thing when a stock price goes lower? When it is AMAT after a great earnings report and guidance forward and you get to buy more shares at a discount.
AMAT firing on all cylinders with blow out numbers and long term growth and still get no love from investors. Time to add to my existing shares.
WOW......Green on a day like today? That's gotta say something.
"Another superb ER and a showdown awaits between the arch nemeses Trader v Lawrence. Increases on FCF from multiple revenue streams. But $8 fy 2022 eps guidance is not great, it’s flat, unless they are anticipating some surprises from a huge backlog.. guess I wad overly optimistic hoping for closer to $10. All depends what the market does tomorrow, maybe bw a low 127-128 high 132-133? A/h vol light because of market willies and freaky Friday option exp"
"One such company that might be well-positioned for future earnings growth is Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT. This firm, which is in the Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry, saw EPS growth of 37.2% last year, and is looking great for this year too."
this stock...so controlled its sick......money in the bank but the short control over this is too muchup $4 down $4 really doesn't go anywhere except for earnings time.....
"PAAAAAAthetic response to an incredible earnings beat and great guidance, go figure wall street."
CALLS ARE FLYING OFF THE SHELVES FOR 130.00 CALL OPTIONS WOOHOO
Mind blowing numbers coming our way $VENA $AMAT
AMAT senior management is participating in 5 conferences (fireside chats) with the major brokerage houses in the next 5 weeks. I think they have a positive story to tell and are anxious to get out there and tell it.
Agreement with Taiwan is going to mean ALOT of CAPX spending is gonna be happening in Arizona over the next few years.
We should be over 135.00 after hours
This stock should be $20 higher easy.
"what a racket. it's so dumb. two quarters ago people were selling because amat projected their revenue growth out for too far, and it was 'lower' than expected. duhhhhh. that just means management set themselves up for quarter after quarter for earnings and revenue beats, plus have themselves more runway for forward guidance revisions upward. all games. everyone knows this is a solid company. set it and forget it."
BEST EARNINGS EVER WOOHOO AND XDIV DATE 8/25 NICCCCEEEEE
"10 year chart is decent for this cyclical semiconductor play. If you believe in $AMAT and other WFE plays, you should believe in $UCTT. Still have years of growth ahead"
THIS LOW OVERSOLD VALUE WON'T LAST LONG...IT'S A BUY SIGNAL TODAY FOR UP TO $140 BY TOMORROW AND $150 NEXT WEEK AFTER ITS E/R !!!!!BUY...BUY...BUY MORE BEFORE CAN'T TODAY.....
Loading up on calls here
Today at 7 am you’ll see everyone loading up on the sale price
"After $LRCX earnings, there are now some price targets being lowered. That hasn't happened in while. It could get ugly in this sector today. Would like to see AMAT hold $110 as support. If it loses that, it's hard to say where it will go. We'll see if there is more downward price targets as the morning and day goes on."
"HEY Trader! FROM INVESTOPEDIA, THE INVESTMENT BIBLE, SHOWS THAT YOUR CONTINUED USE OF SHAKE OUT IS INCORRECT!""What Is a Shakeout?A shakeout is a situation in which many investors exit their positions in a stock or market segment at the same time, often at a loss. A shakeout is usually caused by uncertainty or recent bad news circulating around a particular security or industry. Shakeouts can be quite variable in duration, but they are usually sharp in terms of the amount lost from recent highs.”"
"Motley article on AMAT just released an hour ago: “If Data Is the New Oil, This Stock Will Soar”"
Call me when we are back in the 140's. Another aggravating sector. Mass shortage and industry does not react right
"Just added at $129.00 ~ if they did not like the earnings, AMAT would be down 5% by now."
"So why are we down ah? Beat and raise, my two favorite words."
earnings up 79% and sales up 41%!
I would love to see this ticker fill the gap back up to $135. I'm surprised it's not taking off like a rocket after that earnings report and all the analyst upgrades.
AMAT will ride over 135.00 today
Great day
Definitely a great buy here for AMAT! I've added another 25 shares to my 500+. This will be over 200 by end of year.
"just buy good companies and forget about it. stop checking everyday. all I did was buy AMAT in the $40s and 50s last year and it 2-3x'd. stop messing around with options and just be an owner. if people just bought shares it'd go up, and you'll prob make more owning stock anyways. easiest 100% gains I've ever made by just buying a good stock like amat and ignoring it."
"AMAT Trading about $132 a share this morning, I’m depressed because I know it’s gonna go back down to $129 there’s just no way the market manipulators will lead stay at this level."
So Gerry did you buy AMAT before the ER like you postulated yesterday? I bought those calls earlier and am glad I did. The lack of hard positive AM action shows a delayed response so you still have time to buy. I agree with Mike that the Forward PE now makes this Equity a confirmed value buy.
"Charles, please do that and then get off the board and stop crying"
"You know, fiscal year ends October 25 and it looks like earnings for this year will be over $7. A PE of 20 gives us a share price of $140 and a PE of 25 is $175. I see earnings of $10 a share next fiscal year if it doesn't do anything drastic to hurt earnings, so maybe $200 to 250 next year."
"AMAT had positive momentum mid-morning today, then the terrible news about the Kabul International Airport bombing came out, volitility increased and the majority NASDAQ stocks went down and remains down. However, AMAT is demonstrating resiliency and should end the day on + side."
Very nice movement lately. Up over 5% this week and past that 140 resistance.
I have never listened to an Applied Materials earnings call before. What a class act! I learned so much about the semiconductor landscape in one hour. Amazing. Not to mention what great prospects for AMAT going forward.
Loaded another 500 we should break 130.00 and another run up to 135.00
Whats going on?
VERY STRONG results and raised the revenue guide for the next quarter. This will pull the whole semi cap equipment sector forward tomorrow. Remember there still IS a chip shortage. GL
Bullish baby
"Next Resistance: $137.61/s, RSI(14): 45.30. Lots of room to move up. Lets go and load up. Peace and cheers!"
"This is a chance to pick up shares in a company that makes money and will demonstrate that next week. Yes, there's a chip shortage but that's why we'll learn that all AMAT equipment is spoken for far into the future. This selloff is odd, unless there is some unknown issue."
Can not even make it to $131 with such a powerful day!
earnings report: very positive forward projections next qt.
"Buying up as many shares as I can here, way oversold"
Memory maker micron falling big ...Anyone know why ?
WOOOOOOHOOOO
Well there is always next week. SP deserves better
A forward PE of only 18. Industry average is around 33. PEG under 1 at only .8. Strong recent earnings. Chip shortage has spawned a massive demand with massive profits. Expecting a great ER next month. Other companies earnings are strong and positive. AMAT is looking like a value stock here. Undervalued and one of the major players!
SMASHED EARNINGS
"It MAY be a tough slow slog (big institutions accumulating, options considerations, whatever...) but if you are an investor and not just trading (I do both), you cannot go wrong buying AMAT at $129 if your time frame is beyond the next couple months. I had a long swing earnings play on AMAT I established yesterday,, bought more in the post-market (as I posted in real time yesterday), and after listening to that stellar earnings call, these shares will pass to my kids as they are now moved to our core portfolio. Good luck long-time AMAT believers. Looks like you will be well rewarded."
"$IBM $WIMI $AMAT rumor has it, this sees 20s next week..."
aftermarket action total fud!
Ten years from now this company will be substantially larger than it is today. Just holding and holding some more. Yawn.
KEEP LOADING FELLOW LONGS
"As soon the pandemic close to the end then investors start selling DOW JONES and buying NASDAQ...which leading the way for the new record high again. Once again, it seems more investors selling THE DOW and buying NASDAQ , thus pushing nasdaq higher from now on !"
"As much as AMAT has gone up in the last year, or even the last few years, the stock is still dirt cheap.....This stock will keep going up, and although this stock has been a 6 Bagger for me so far, I see another double at least before the company's business starts cooling down.......Every single major economic power wants to start building Semi Fabs within their borders, that just means more and more business for al the Semi equipment makers.......just the facts!"
TRADER 20 MORE MINUTES OF PAIN FOR YOU WE ARE HEADED TO 140.00REALLY WISH I COULD MEET YOU IN A DARK ALLEY
Wow some of the semiconductor stocks are looking like value stocks with forward PE's under 18 (avg for sector is 33)! AMAT trading around 12% under fare value during a time of high demand and spending from semi manufactures is looking very attractive here for adding to long positions.
"This is a perfect example of a bulletproof report/guide followed by negative price action for reasons beyond explanation. In this case, the weakness is a gift that you buy into. I wouldn't be surprised if this opens green tomorrow, but if it doesn't, I have buy orders set."
picked up a thousand shares on the dip
How the heck do you go from 144 to 133 in 3 days with no news in strong market?
This manipulation makes me sick. There’s no reason for this thing to sell off today.
We understand it's hard for negative put buyers but AMAT is going to have a great MONTH
nice to see AMAT above 140 again ... that's where it belongs.Maybe we'll see SP creep above 145 after earnings.
"Cramer likes us.. I don't know how to feel about that.. he can be the kiss of death, but I know fundamentally AMAT is strong, so I will not protest your pump.. seems that Trader won the last ER battle but Lawrence and the longs may win the next ER. My meaningless p/t is $155-160 by eoy."
Really is amazing after that ER and 6 brokerage firms ALL raising their price targets (from $150-$180) and the stock trades lower by $2.

HEY Trader! HOW IS THE 131 OPTION CURRENTLY DOING? LMAO! LMAO!Trader 8/23/2021131 Option will be kapoot !!!
Great day coming wishful thinkers that think AMAT will drop are fooling themselves we should see at least a5.00 gain today and another 5.00 gain tomorrow
"Well it takes some time to work off and reverse a news media narrative that doesn’t fit the facts - as they emerge. AMAT’s performance will soon outweigh the trading houses’ supply of churnable accounts. I feel sorry for those folks who signed off on control of their investments but when it happens like this it gives us, the ones who control and can take charge, a great buying opportunity."
8/19/2021 FYI---Diawa Securities started coverage this morning with an OUTPERFORM rating and a $140 PT.
TSMC is an absolute beast of a company. The market will eventually wake up to realize this and not let US/Chinese political worries interfere. The stock deserves so much more love than what it has gotten this year. No bigger better positioned semiconductor company in the industry right now. Well except $ASML and maybe $AMAT.
"started position with AMAT, 126 and 125.65 as core. wish me luck. will be buying as I go"
$AMAT $WIMI I HOLD FOR YOU AND YOU HOLD FOR ME.$PLUG
"Thanks Kirk, I saw the historical data prices and you're 100% correct I also loaded another 325 shares"
Dirt cheap
And that's how you shake out the weak hands......make the Nasdaq go up 150 points while AMAT goes down 2.5% on a fabulous ER. These market makers sure know how to play the game. Quite fraudulent.
Long and prosperous decade ahead for this company. Keep holding.
"Again take analysts with a grain of salt, but these new released targets are all 20-40% higher than our current price. Even Morgan Stanley increased their price target. This is such a discount now!JP Morgan raises target price to $173 from $160Mizuho raises target price to $161 from $158Stifel raises target price to $180 from $170 Morgan Stanley raises target price to $150 from $139"

Liam I added another 300 and have an order in for a block at 3:30
Hopefully the huge buyback program will help the stock continue to grow. Now the price looks quite low ahead of the financial report.
AMAT was down -$15 for 4 days while LRCX was down $-65. Loaded more shares for both. Hope I will be ok.
I’m highly confused on why it’s going down so much and no news?
"It's either gonna pop pre-market or drop further to shake the tree even more than its already been shaken. Either way, they're gonna try to keep the small guys out. Look what happened to nvda today..."
"AMAT is the most diversified semi equipment company in the world. Likely the most leveraged company during this semiconductor shortage and expansion. With a forward pe of only 18, AMAT is likely the most undervalued semiconductor equipment play in the market with the most upside potential right now."
What the hell just happened? Why is it down to 122 after hours?
"DAVID, THERE WILL BE NO LOWER ENTRY POINT"
8/20--Brokerage firms:CFRA price target goes to $150Mizuho Securities goes from $150 to $161.

Loaded another 2500 shares they are expecting HUGE GAINS TOMORROW
"All I can say after the share price not being able to push past and stay above $140 despite several attempts, is this: if semiconductors are so important, then why are the companies essential to making these chips being valued so darn cheaply? AMAT has a forward PE in the teens and several governments (Japan, S Korea, USA) are making chip manufacturing investments an essential part of their national; strategy. AMAT and Clorox have almost the same forward earnings forecast, but CLX sells at $185/share, not $135. Why is something so darn essential being valued so darn cheap?"
"Yet again, share price gets to 140 and gets pushed back, I haven't been concerned but I do think some on Wall St think we've hit an inflection point where things will continue to be good for AMAT, LRCX etc, but that the acceleration is slowing a good bit and might reverse. So very good company, very good outlook, but perceived slowing rate of growth = stalled share price. Still think we see $180-ish this year, but a bit less confident"
ASML the better choice?
It's an ascending triangles pattern inside of an ascending triangles pattern.
A lot of investors were complaining when AMAT couldn't close above $140 and hold it. Now we close above $142 with the Dow down 100 points and the S&P down 8 points and people are mad that we couldn't hold $145 (on a mostly red day). Yes the Nasdaq was up .06% while AMAT gained 1.49%. Are you EVER happy??? The options activity in this stock says it's going HIGHER still...do your own DD. GLTA.
"Share price at close was 129. In the cc, mgmt pretty much told us they'd make over $8/share in the year ahead. So we're looking at a forward P/E of 16. For a lot of the market, if you can get a PEG under 2, that's a steal. AMAT's PEG is 0.2 (16 PE / 90% growth in EPS) !!! And it serves the most important industry of our time -- it is one of the few companies the world literally can not do without. So compare excerpts from these two quarterly statements:1. xxx reported record revenue for the second quarter ended August 1, 2021, of $6.51 billion, up 68 percent from a year earlier and up 15 percent from the previous quarter ...GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.94, up 276 percent from a year ago and up 24 percent from the previous quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.04, up 89 percent from a year ago and up 14 percent from the previous quarter.vs2. yyy generated revenue of $6.20 billion. On a GAAP basis, the company recorded gross margin of 47.9 percent, operating income of $2.01 billion or 32.5 percent of net sales, and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.87.On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, the company reported gross margin of 48.0 percent, operating income of $2.03 billion or 32.7 percent of net sales, and EPS of $1.90. Record quarterly GAAP EPS of $1.87 and record non-GAAP EPS of $1.90, up 105 percent and 79 percent year over year, respectively.************So ----- Which looks better? The first company is NVIDIA. AMAT is the second. AMAT is obviously a key part the NVIDIA supply chain (via TSMC). AMAT's earnings are almost double NVIDIA's. The growth rates of both are exceptional, both nearly doubling non-GAAP earnings over the prior year. AMAT, with non-GAAP earnings of $1.90, has a share price of about $130NVIDIA, with non-GAAP earnings of $1.04 has a share price of about $200NVDA has about 1/2 the earnings and yet, it has a 50% higher share price!!AMAT shares are a steal at $130 -- and they'd still be a steal at $200. But the market seems to think the story has too much risk. Even though CSCO said just yesterday, their own earnings are going to a bit more modest because chip demand is so high and they need to pay up for the chips they need. I've long thought AMAT is going to finish the year above $180. And it should, its crushing it. But the market reaction is so blah. I'm not sure what to make of this. The company if terrific. The stock, not so much."
"great company, great biz, great earnings, great future.AMAT has $6+billion in share buyback authorization and it is days like today, when it drops despite delivering a brilliant earnings report, that you hope they buy back shares. My guess is that AMAT will double its dividend within the next year. Its earning nearly $2/quarter, it can afford a dividend of nearly $2 per year. I can't rationalize a share price this low. This is among the cheapest high tech stocks in the world, along with $KLAC, $LRCX and a few others who play big in this space. PEG ratio of 0.2?!!!! Forward PE of 15-ish. Strong balance sheet. Huge growth opportunities as AI starts to take hold. And numerous major nations deciding they're under-invested in IC technology. The story couldn't be better and the shares have rarely been cheaper."
"Absolutely incredible quarter. $1.90 EPS, $1.77 expected. Up 41% yoy. $6.2B revenue, $5.9B expected. Up 71% yoy. Plus guides higher next quarter. No denying semiconductor growth."
"If it looks, feel, tastes and smells like mid-summer market churn, it is mid-summer market churn which has the appearance in many sectors and price consolidation which is a price correction against time. Most semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks are range bound and have been for a trading range since late April/Early May 2021 with $TXN, $ADI, $AMAT, $LRCX, $AMD, $KLAC and many others as examples. Enjoy your summer and seek buying opportunities near the lower end of the price range bound from early May onward. There is nothing new here just typical summer market action. The demand for semiconductors will only increase with time and that demand curve doesn't appear linear but rather more exponential."
My order to buy October AMAT $140 calls just got filled for only $1.40/sh.Yea! So far it’s the low price of the day.
HEY Trader THE SPAMMER! HERE IS WHY NO ONE TRUSTS YOU! LMAO!Trader 12/3/2020Shorts will block 88+Trader 11/4/2020Heavy pounce above 64.18....Trader 10/6/2020Let the short flush out..before 61+
"KEEP IN MINDX Dividend date is 8/25/21, shares have to be purchased by 8/22/21 to be eligible for the dividend ( not that the dividend is that much) but AMAT always goes up at least 10.00 2 days before XDIV DATE."
I'll buy a thousand more if it breaks back into 127 and below
"Once again, AMAT hits the $140 area and gets rejected. Happened in April, in early June, in late June and now again in August. Still think the prospects are terrific, but what could they possibly say in their earnings which would get this thing to breakout?Even the Micron story (memory pricing softening) doesn't really add up. Micron just reported their order filling time is at a record high, 20 weeks, meaning they aren't keeping up with demand. How does 'not keeping up with demand' = 'weakness ahead'? I get a sense the market is wanting to pounce on bad news for $LRCX, $KLAC, $AMAT and others -- as if they want to get ahead of some big downward spiral. But that isn't coming, demand is explosive and huge new markets are still early. 5G phones have barely begun to sell. Autonomous driving is a few years from adding massive new demand. Computational medicine is bigger than almost any chip market ever -- and that's coming, too. The markets can't drive it down too much while the results are stellar. But forward P/E in the mid-teens makes zero sense. Not when the upside is so large. So I expect continued aggressive buybacks and stellar results. And perhaps some day, the fearful will realize that chips are essential to the future, and stop the downward pressure on these excellent companies."
this had gone no where in 3 months.....bout had it !!
Smokin!!!
Will we see 133.25 by tomorrow eot?
https://www.thestreet.com/.amp/investing/applied-materials-amat-stock-earnings-analysts
"BOUGHT 5000 SHARES AFTER EARNINGS, MY HEDGE FUND SAYS AMAT IS GOING TO SKYROCKET TOMORROW"
Looking at historical data AMAT did exactly the same thing last earnings and day after earnings then went up over 5.00 2 days before xdiv date and another 7.00 day before xdiv date. shorts have to return all shares before xdiv date. we can expect amat to be over 140.00 by tuesday
Tomorrow is the last day to buy a stock to get dividends
"Shaking off all the short sellers please...Moving up higher and higher as fast as when they moved down, the way it was...."
"All shares need to be purchased by Monday to be eligible for the dividend, which means AMAT will be going up and shares also need to be returned from shorts by Monday which means AMAT WILL BE GOING UP EVEN MORE"
P/E of 26.74 and solid growth over the next decade has me looking for an entry point in AMAT.Buy when no one else wants it.
"Looking for a 3% move either way.. forward guidance, margin numbers and EBITDA give more perspective than top line.. if they come in close to $2 eps this Q and project around $10 eps fy2022 that seems strong to me but if 2022 forecasts are weak, prepare to get dinged. I have only been holding since before last ER but who can complain with over 100% SP increase in last 12 months. Bullish long-term but neutral short-term due to macro factors"
AMAT could break out as early as next week!!!
"Here is what gets us to $150/share.1. ASML has a strong earning and future demand forecast---check2. TXN says revenue will be flat (due to margins) BUT demand is still strong ---check3. INTC beats and says the chip shortage can drag into 2023---check4. House and Senate (Congress) passes the ""Chips Act"" that includes $52B for semi manufacture domestically---(almost check....Senate passed the bill and it's in the house)5. LRCX and KLAC both report next week and will blow away their estimated EPS and increase guidance."
$140 tomorrow!!!
Thats also why there's shares being bought by the billions right now
"AMAT is my largest holding, so the idea of buying more on this pullback is a bit daunting. Still, if it goes down much further, I'd consider. AMAT is at a forward P/E in the mid-teens.Expect about $1.80 eps when they report next week, do the math and the P/E is 17 if they merely hold that profitability. But they are expected to grow more profitable, $8+ eps is not that far out in the future. PEG well under 1. In other words, this is dirt cheap compared to the rest of the market. And it'll still be cheap at $160."
Looks like there are some people snatching up shares here late in the day.
You just wait till next earnings. This will fly. What a crock. Spare us the gratuitous spin.
Added to qcom avgo and amat. all oversold imo
There it is. 10 AM. Like clockwork. Looks like a rough day.
"When you see Bubble Boy , Market Crash Man, and the other spammers please remember this. They are a VERY GOOD contrary indicator, so you can BUY when they come out of the wood work. I actually use them as one of my ""indicators"". They are actually getting the OPPOSITE affect of what they are trying for with their post."
I did a double take when I saw the low volume so far today on AMAT.Lam is also way below average volume today.
132.50 today and then 140.00 monday woohooooooooo
"Running out time for weak hand players. it's now comming strong hands with tons of buying at this bargain price / extremely low , oversold value...."
"134 here we go, next leg up to 140"
MM could be working with an institutional/ hedge fund client to hold the price down for accumulation. Patient in holding on fundamentals should pay off. GL
Buy now or too late later... as more and more buyers jump in at any moment low and no more chance for low / oversold valued anymore for buying... good luck ....
"Dallas Fed official Robert Kaplan on CNBC just now and referring to the semi shortage. He was saying the demand for semis continues to grow faster than the supply and that the semi shortage will last longer than most people think. This guy gets GREAT industry information from many (diverse) sources. I would rather listen to him than analyst, hedge fund managers, research firms and day traders, all of whom have their own agendas."
"Do not worry, the whole equip. group got punished today, the front and backend sectors.Do not try to rationalize today's move."
AMAT is severely undervalued and during a time of record growth and demand in the semiconductor industry. Expect earnings to be outstanding and this value play to not last much longer. AMAT is extremely diversified for this red hot industry and this demand and growth is not going anywhere for quite some time.
im way up but im still gonna add more to my position $AMAT $VENA $PYPL
Load up more shares this is just Smoke and mirrors trying to get people to sell
"I just made 25,000"
Solid beat/raise. This and/or LRCX should be a long term hold in any portfolio. Early innings of a decade long growth cycle for the semi equipment manufacturers.
"Yo KIrk loaded all day, shorts are going to be SQUEEEZED!!!! woohoo loaded another 1000 shares at 129.10"
"it's quite simple, we buy and hold $ORCL $AMAT $VENA"
It would be nice to stamp and hold 140+. Markets are at all time high's. Massive chip shortage! This is the cream of the crop and we cannot breakout to new 52 week highs . GIVE ME A BREAK
WOW. 2nd quarter earnings!!! Will shake out much higher. Added yesterday AH.
LOADED MORE SHARES
"MU had a great earnings report. The only metric that did NOT meet expectations is that their CAPX spending was too high......hmmmmm, wonder what that means for the semi equipment stocks."
okay I bought in yesterday at 134 do u sell and wait for bottom or is this a good entry point for more??
"No wonder if the market reverse to upside , positive soon today....and so does AMAT ..."
CHIPS AHOY!!!
"IMO much of this weakness we are seeing is related to the SMH where TSM weighs 14% of the etf. They've been taking tsm to the woodshed for several sessions now. MU, TSM particularly have weighed!"
A not named market research firm forecast weaker memory prices and the market sells off?
AMAT is a growth company. It deserves a P/E of 25. It can earn $8 in the coming year. My target is 200 (=$8X25).
Shouldn’t the fab market boom proceed the chipmaker boom? Chipmakers rising and pulling AMAT up with them; meanwhile massive news of increasing production capacity and related infrastructure spending didn’t move this stock for 5 months.. bullish either way but seems odd.. overdue for blast off from this consolidation to fair value vs market at 210 per share
"Next week is AMAT's ER. This is very suspect to have an unknown research firm called Trendforce come out with a negative story in the Investors Business Daily (IBD). When AMAT reports and the stock moves up to $150 Trendforce will not be able to be found anywhere, and the ""retail investors"" will be the ones that get hurt. Instead I am buying."
My favourite semi play. Also like HIMX ONTO and IMOS.
AMAT has a near term (May 12th) low of $114 but it doesn’t seem that strong or deep compared to the subsequent strength and volume over time of the trading that took it to $140+. With this positive ER it will be a few days to digest and clear before the upgrades kick in. Meanwhile it’s having a dip which is a good buying opportunity. Count your blessings.
AMAT I’m long term even if it goes to $115 I will hold this for the next 10 years….I have a great strategy…..never sell and hold long term…. I’ll make thousand on paper and never have to report a taxable gain!!!
Absolutely absurd..
Unbelievable…AMAT it’s up five points today 7/21….. don’t worry tomorrow on 7/22 it will be down 6…..to return to its norm!!!!￼￼￼
Gregory it was a huge factor every xdiv date with the same amount because AMAT is such a great company
glad I bought last week
After hours is the worst indicator for how tomorrow will go.
Let's get ready to ruummmmble!!! (or tumble)
"HEY Trader! YOUR CONTINUED USE OF FLUSH OUT IS ALSO TOTALLY INCORRECT! A FLUSH OUT IS A CAPITULATION, FROM INVESTOPEDIA-Capitulation is when investors give up any previous gains in any security or market by selling their positions during periods of declines.Many market professionals consider it to be a sign of a bottom in prices and consequently a good time to buy stocks. However, the extent of a capitulation can only be understood after the fact."
It's nice to see AMAT staying above 140 for several consecutive days now... next stop 145!
Strongly believe AMAT will be 140+ soon
"@Scott - u may dump Chinese stocks, but why buy stocks in companies which would be hurt if China takes over Taiwan as in Taiwan Semi Conductor"
$200 for AMAT after its e/r next week .
"HEY Trader! SHAKE IT OUT! FLUSH IT OUT!HEY Trader! FROM INVESTOPEDIA, THE INVESTMENT BIBLE, SHOWS THAT YOUR CONTINUED USE OF SHAKE OUT IS INCORRECT!""What Is a Shakeout?A shakeout is a situation in which many investors exit their positions in a stock or market segment at the same time, often at a loss. A shakeout is usually caused by uncertainty or recent bad news circulating around a particular security or industry. Shakeouts can be quite variable in duration, but they are usually sharp in terms of the amount lost from recent highs.”"
set your sell orders over 200.00
"Feels like its a no-win situation for the earnings. If earnings are good and forecast is good, the analysts will be talk about the upcoming headwinds -- that all the added capacity will take the chip biz from shortage to glut in a short time. And if AMAT has anything less than a strong quarter, the analysts will beat it up because of 'weaker than hoped' results or forecasts.We're in the 'perception=reality' phase of things, and it isn't working out that well for AMAT stock and most of the rest of the chip eqpt makers. Sure feels like the market has decided its time to wait for the inevitable overcapacity event -- and since the share price keeps getting rejected at $140-ish, there's not enough upside left to attract buyers. Of course, there is nothing inevitable about overcapacity, since there are so many trends which require substantially increased chip consumption. But that isn't what the market thinks at the moment. Any tiny breeze of bad news turns in a hurricane. If there's some good news, its that AMAT and the others have already been taken to the woodshed, so the downside is probably pretty modest from here. If this ever sees the 1-teens again, it'd be a good time to add more."
"AMAT is not solely tied to DRAM, so why the big flush?"
UP and DOWN + or - $10 points is normal in this market as due to high volatility. Buying at this ideal low price today for great profit next week when its e/r is due
"Had my doubts in after hours and with Asian markets down big but it appears Jerome is back at the printer and we are pushing past 130 after ER. NVDA held their gains, SOXL up"
"What a gift. I'm in AMAT for the first time in AH. This report was amazing, on all metrics."
"yep, we shook off the shorts now they all will be rebuying in for the div"
BOUGHT MORE ON SALE
On April 5; I purchased a 1/2 position @ 145 . What are you all talking about.
LOADED ANOTHER 125
"That's a real confirming BREAKOUT, not just by a $1.00 or $2."
"Buying the smoke and mirrors sale price ALWAYS MAKES ME WEALTHYUse the sale from smoke and mirrors to add to your positions,"
Still a long-term hold. Price is way up over the last 12 months. It was bound to slow down at some point. Will hold shares another 10 years (at least). AMAT's business will be substantially larger - and so will their FCF and market cap.
"Did anyone else see the lucky SOB that got a fill at 119 in the AH? I saw it drop 7.5% for a second and knew some unlucky retail investor put in a market sell order, haha."
"Strange drop...Does somebody know something ... orders canceled, etc.?"
"first time buyer ,hope 126.00 is a good price"
"Prediction: $201 at year end. This would be a 45.5% gain from the $138.16 closing price on July 2nd. An astonishing move in only 6 months but that's where I see it based on valuation relative to peers, rising inflation and secular demand."
Shocking that there is still selloff pressure after a strong earnings and good days for Nasdaq!
DUDE YEEEEHAHHHH LOVE IT EARNINGS WER CRUSHED AND GUIDANCE FOR THE NEXT YEAR IS REMARKABLE
AMAT seems to be going sideways for the last several months. Not entirely sure why. Doesn't matter much - they have a long and very rewarding decade ahead of them.
They just said they have a $10 billion dollar backlog of orders and they foresee demand increasing even more in all sectors of Memory and Foundry Logic!!! Take that Morgan Stanley! The sad thing is they probably vacuumed up all the cheap shares during this dip.
"The shares of Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) have received a price target of $165 from DA Davidson. And DA Davidson analyst Thomas Diffely is maintaining a “Buy” rating on the company shares."

Thank you for the sale price. Back in!! The gift that keeps giving
NICCCCEEEE SALE ENDS TODAY
i need to stop watching the premarket
AMAT guides revenues higher for next quarter. Big blocks on the bid bodes well.
Took big profits in $AMAT along the way this year. Letting my current position ride. This is headed to 200 in time.
"don't feel bad ..all chips and the sector in sell off/correction regardless of earning HIMX p/e of 4 and still dropping , just saying"
"MS downgraded MIcron to $75. What a bunch of shills, of all the Analysts they are the most deceitful and manipulative, I’ve never know them to be right about anything and they always low ball."
Usual wall street chicanery. When it's a beat the market makers get the big shorts out and add the big boys & girls wanting to load up. So freakin' obvious when one has played this game since 1998.
All shares that were shorted have to be returned 2 days before XDIV DATE and thats why AMAT always goes up between 10-15.00 after earnings

Price action and stock price today is practically the same as after earnings last May. Believe it's a buying oppurtunity.

Look at the 1 month chart and 5 day chart AMAT was pulled back so much we may even ride to 140.00 today AMAT deserves to be over 200.00
Closing will be interesting...I SOX holds green??
This company has great fundamentals! Staying long!
AMAT BLOWS EARNINGS OUT OF THE WATER!!!!!!
"AMAT with a nice, high growth, high margin, wide moat business. Will do well in the coming years - best to think longer term with this holding and ignore daily share price movements."
Wow...certainly the greatest earnings report in AMAT history and one of the best of any tech companies. I will be adding to my position...the stock price deserves to be well above $200.
"As with Gabby, I began adding to my positions in AMAT, $LRCX and yes even added some $ASML this morning. Should price opportunities emerge below this mornings lows I will make additional buys."
"Passing of the ""Infrastructure Bill"" will have a positive effect on chip equipment stocks with an extra $52B in there for semiconductor capacity expansion. Other countries will do the same."
"$AMAT $WIMI $FSR You're also saying this because you saw a drop. If it didn't drop, what do you have to say?"
chart is showing a close today ove 135.00 and tomorrow over 140.00
"TSM is undervalued here, been consolidating since March, and is due for a breakout. It's the most advanced semiconductor company that all the big boys utilize ($NVDA, $AMD, $QCOM, $APPL, $AVGO, ARM, $INTC) and have all given very positive future outlooks. It is rapidly growing and expanding it's operations in an attempt to try and meet extreme demand. It's unrivaled 3nm process is fully booked for the next two years and production on the 2nm process is set to begin in 2023. The chip shortage has greatly contributed to a super cycle with semiconductors. The global expansion will ensure massive semiconductor growth for years and technologies like 5G, IoT, AI, and EV only reemphasizes their long term importance. Semiconductor equipment manufacturers like $ASML, $AMAT, $KLAC, and $UCTT all stand to greatly benefit from this global growth and expansion by all semiconductor manufacturers like TSM."
"Here it comes again under-valued, just bought 5.2k shares. Thanks for the high volatility"
"I sat in on the LRCX earnings CC. No red flags, after hours trading is just the day traders and HFT's. The best FACT reported on the call was that WFE spend for 2021 was moving from $75B previously to.......$80B now. That's all you need to know. Semi equipment goes higher from here. Maybe not tomorrow .......but certainly in the next 6 months. Invest.....don't trade. GLTA"
Trader we had a bargain all day and everyone is adding shares not selling. Sorry but your going to LOSE REALLY BIG
Waiting for it to reach $129 then buy and wait for November action. That's when the pendulum swings the other way.
"8/20 JPM---PT $173, Stiefel PT $180. Just an FYI"
Siro was right. hopefully it will hold onto 140+. Chip shortage will be around for awhile . I'm long on this company even if it fluctuates short term.
I THINK AMD is going back to all time high next week
will EXPLODE next week!! IMO
"I honestly love when good stock is on SALE, I have made a lot of money buying when the stock is down"
Today after hours all shorted shares have to be covered
"semiconductors are stagnating and going down because people are trying to predict that the semi market will get hit by a return to normal (shortage dries up) and they there will be some sort of huge oversupply that'll crater the markets for years like happened a while ago. I think they're off the mark in these fears. IoT, AI, and increased digitization everywhere will be enough to soak up supplies. it's irrational and frustrating, but that's why semis have had problems over the last few months."
Trading sideways. Why?
I'm going LONG on AMAT. I like the fundamentals of this company. I also like LRCX.
How low is this on going? i jumped on some option calls yesterday and now i'm sinking.
Not even a small bounce!
"Once a month we seem to get the ""the semiconductor cycle is over"" call from some analyst or another. Still stuck in the 90s mentality of this industry. Who know how many days the fear selling will go on. The virus fears are ramping again and the work from home craze isn't going away any time soon. Demand will only grow. Bullish IMO."
"Unusual Options Alert (AMAT) $145.00 At The Ask Exp Date August 27, 2021 Open Interest 25,063"
"Why why is this stock going down??? There still is a demand for semi conductor equipment, and even though rotations are going to the large cap stock that doesn’t explain why the stock should fall from $140 a share to $134 makes no sense???￼"
It’s doing so well and that’s why the stock price is falling. The boyz at work.
LOADED AND WE WILL SEE 132.00 TODAY
KEEP LOADING
"I just bought AMAT 168 shares today. We will see next month. I am unloading some of my Chinese stock and dump it to NVDA, AMD and AMAT. I think my money has good or better future. So help me God Peace!"
"Just take a step back and take a look at what is going on....fabless companies $NVDA $AMD and now $QCOM all reporting incredible ER's with tremendous growth WITH very positive guidance going forward. Semi manufactures like $TSM $TXN all reporting beats with significant growth and constantly guiding upwards with positive outlooks going forward. Other manufacturers like $QRVO and $SWKS will likely reports similar strong ER's this week. Semi equipment companies like $ASML (destroyed earnings) $LRCX $AMAT are and will likely continue reporting even more significant earnings and growth due to unprecedented demand. The semiconductor industry is looking outstanding right now and has an even brighter future. ER's are reflecting this nicely. I'm severely bullish on this industry right now and many of the stocks, particularly semi equipment stocks are looking like value plays ($AMAT and $LRCX especially undervalued)."

Like to see as NVDIA did yesterday/today
EASILY 136-137 TODAY
Thinking about pulling out of this and moving it to NVDA. Hopefully there will be a pop on Monday to pull me to the green but this hasn’t budged since the last earnings.
Is this some sort of joke? nasdaq ripping and AMAT DOWN
Micron continues to sell off...Devastating news for chipmakers...
Now Toyota is out there saying the chip shortage will last thru at least 2022. Early innings in the investment cycle for semi cap equipment folks.
Must be worrisome to shorts nothing but great news today tomorrow and the future

And so the day starts strong for AMAT on both volume and price. Compare to yesterday’s weak volume. Perhaps The financial media and in turn the trading houses and fund managers are giving in to the facts of the recent ER and guidanceLove him or hate him even Cramer piped in that AMAT is “buyable”.
"This stock ended where is started blah blah blah day. One of these days it will get wings and move higher where it belongs. Right now it is being controlled by the MM and algos. This baby should be in the $160.00 soon and closer to $200 BY December. There is just to much great news with AMAT now, current price is pathetic."
"“Texas Instruments Forecast Stokes Concern Over Chip Demand”Hmmmmmmm,"
AMAT could be $160 after its e/r next week. Loading more on today's dip.
