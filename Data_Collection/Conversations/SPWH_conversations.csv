Sportsman's Warehouse reached a 52 Week high at 12.19
Sell SPWH buy BGFV the mother of all squeezes is coming on Set 17
Over $15+
PE = 7 on F2016 Earnings of $0.69 / share and Q4 Earnings $0.25Much better value than Cabela's or #$%$ Sporting Goods. My understanding is that SPWH is now #4 in the sector.Should go up from here with these stable earnings and growing revenues.
About how long does a deal like this take to close?
"WEST JORDAN, Utah, Dec. 02, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc. (""Sportsman's Warehouse"" or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: SPWH) today announced financial results for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2020.“Sportsman’s Warehouse continued its exceptional performance in the third quarter of 2020. We were extremely pleased with the efforts of associates in all of our facilities as we worked as a team to safely and effectively serve customers, both new and returning,” said Jon Barker, Sportsman’s Warehouse CEO. “During the third quarter, same store sales increased 41% compared to the same period last year, driven by elevated participation in fishing, camping and hunting, and our continued market share gains in firearms.”Mr. Barker stated, “We continue to be excited about the expansion of our ecommerce capabilities, with ecommerce-driven sales up over 200% from the prior year period. We are also highly encouraged by the strong visitor traffic on both our website and inside of our stores. We opened 9 new stores year-to-date in 2020, taking the total Sportsman’s Warehouse store count to 111. In addition, our first Legacy Shooting Center, which opened earlier this year, is performing ahead of expectations.”“We believe we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on substantial growth opportunities, including heightened participation in outdoor activities, ecommerce growth, and new store expansion to create long-term shareholder value.”For the thirteen weeks ended October 31, 2020:Net sales were $385.7 million, an increase of $143.2 million, or 59.1%, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. The net sales increase was primarily due to a surge in demand across all major categories, led by our hunting and shooting category, as well as strong growth in our ecommerce platform compared to the prior year period.Same store sales increased 40.9% during the third quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2019.Gross profit was $130.6 million or 33.9% of net sales, compared to $84.2 million or 34.7% of net sales in the comparable prior year period, a year-over-year increase of $46.4 million in gross profit and an 80-basis point decrease in gross profit margin.Net income was $30.5 million compared to net income of $10.5 million in the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted net income was $31.5 million compared to adjusted net income of $10.8 million in the third quarter of 2019 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures”).Adjusted EBITDA was $49.9 million compared to $23.2 million in the comparable prior year period (see ""GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures"").Diluted earnings per share were $0.68 compared to a diluted earnings per share of $0.24 in the comparable prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.71 compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.25 for the comparable prior year period (see ""GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures"")."
Added some when it dipped under $14 today. Should be another good report on Wednesday.
I will be buying in on Sportsman Warehouse. I am a fisherman and will support them mainly for that reason.
SPWH is up 5.62% to 6.20
"John, Gregory, Sid...Congratulations. It still #$%$ me off that somebody was able to manipulate this stock to drive it down to accumulate."
Sportsman's Warehouse reached a 52 Week high at 13.99
Not a bad day
Total cash 22.millionsTotal debt 402.millionsGood time to sell now.
"If you own this stock, sell it. Here's why. I am unable to order ANYTHING from their website. Don't believe me? Try it. You cannot even enter a shipping address much less a credit card number. Who's the genius that wrote the code and QA'd the page?"
Investigations will find that the acquisition price isn’t adequate. We should be paid more.
Let’s gooooo
Impressive quarter but will it be enough to move the stock where it should be retracing to and then breaking out.
Got Jan 15th calls Strike 12.50 paid $2.50 for em. Down 31% after an earnings call that checked all boxes..Amazing.. This isn’t $18+ by eom somethings wrong here
What is funny is that I have tech stocks with negative earnings but that is still rising. This company is making money and expanding. #$%$ earnings report wasn't that bad yet this stock gets pummeled. Go figure
Wow what a pay day! Good stuff for everyone that held on there.
My job is done here. Congrats to all the longs.
"Don't see any catalyst for this dip. Still bullish on this...sales are still beating LY, they opened 3 new stores recently, opening 3 more in the next 40 to 60ish days, converted 8 Field & Stream stores LY... Feels like this will pop after ER, then continue its slow gradual climb."
I'm getting buyers remorse from holding this stock! Most all the other stocks in the sector are moving up even after their misses at the last Q! I have no more patience for this stock!
They definitely sold SPWH way to low management must have been promised lucrative jobs by Bass Pro.
I have had enough I am gonna make some calls and get the squeeze going this week. Get out of the way or lose
"What to do? a penny miss, but still .55 per share per year. thinking that there's still no way this stock should be under $4. I'm Guessing the shorts are the ones who get fooled tomorrow. institutional ownership is over 98% with 12 million shares short. I might be loading up tomorrow."
bought more on dip at $3.90. Ad of August 15 there are 28 percent short. This on a company near historical low and earning profit. This is just ridiculous
Still holding my position. No way I'm selling when it is this clearly undervalued.
"If folks are looking for an affordable investment, grass roots company. paying a respectable dividend then this is a great stock for the portfolio. Only concern is whether this ""Outdoor Trend"" will stick around. Truth is discovering the outdoors is becoming RETRO. It's been out of the mainstream for the INDOOR TECH GENERATION. Now all of a sudden, the Flu has created the only real option for being out of the house. Indoor gathering will never be the same. Outdoors is wide oprn literally and will continue to enjoy a renaissance. Also many activities like Disneyland and oter activities like going to the movies involve spending huge amounts of cash. Buy camping gear, and its good for a decade of good times with your family, rather than a single long weekend. IMO."
What happened today?? Any ideas? If there was news I missed it! Can you fill me in?
I am not selling actually adding today trust what you know
"Up to $5 is definitely a possibility. There's a lot to like with spwh moving forward: new stores opening, gun sales, more E commerce, etc."
J.C. someone move this thing up a bit. All these other #$%$ companies that don't make money and we are getting are a... kicked. I hope the shorts feel the pain here shortly.
SPWH is up 6.00% to $5.48
This stock will report exceptional sales in coming earnings report imho.Check out their web page and see how many items are unavailable due to being sold out and placed on back order. This will take off one day soon.
I've been buying at 17.40. The deal is scheduled to close 2nd half of the year - which is an almost guaranteed 4-8% annual return. I estimate the very small risk the deal doesn't close is about equal to the very small chance the purchase price goes up based on legal action.
SPWH is down -5.41% to 5.77
Sportsman's Warehouse reached a 52 Week high at 10.10
"My 50, april 16, $15 strike calls I bought last week for 0.97c are about to explode!!"
"Sportsman's Warehouse (SPWH - Research Report) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.76 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.32 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.13 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 137.50%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this outdoor sporting goods specialty retailer would post a loss of $0.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.01, delivering a surprise of 116.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Sportsman's Warehouse, which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, posted revenues of $380.99 million for the quarter ended July 2020, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33.66%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $211.77 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Sportsman's Warehouse shares have added about 118.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 9.2%.What's Next for Sportsman's Warehouse?While Sportsman's Warehouse has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Sportsman's Warehouse was favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.33 on $280.80 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.91 on $1.10 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Apparel and Shoes is currently in the bottom 10% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1."
I knew we couldn't make it three in a row lol. It fought back after the morning drop though at least 
This has been one of my worst days in stocks. I don't what to expect tomorrow but hope for best
"David, you keep posting that everyone needs to sell before it's too late, last chance, etc, but it keeps going up. You make a good point on the debt they carry, but I can tell you their sales have been blowing away LY since C19 started. The only limiting factor on that is inability to get product to stock shelves - they are out of many things with no estimate to restock. Still, I don't think they will fall abruptly. Maybe a plateau followed by gradual decline. Guns/ammo, Camping Fishing sales in particular are through the roof."
Sportsman's Warehouse reached a 52 Week high at 9.61
Hello everyone just a quick question. With this new acquisition between SPWH and The Great Outdoors Group. Will we still hold our shares in SPWH or will they be sold for $18.00 and we are done?
Stock up a little today on poor volume.Comments? Closest store is 200 miles from me in W.Vi Won’t be making the trip. I’m sure most of their sales are on line. Can anyone let me know what their stores are comparable to? Gander Mtn?Cabbalas? Happy the stock is moving up but still puzzled by low volume.
What with yahoo showing institutional ownership at 107%?? Never have seen anything like this. If this close to true SP irrelevant tutes will set where they want. Great way to keep option premiums .
what a #$%$ this is. JC can't even hold water for 1 day after earnings.
Sportsman's Warehouse reached an all time high at 16.74
SPWH is down -6.87% to 4.61
7.51 PE ratio....yes please
"Closed today at 12.45, AH at 12.60 on decent volume. That's curious. Might be a view on what we can expect on Monday. The stage is set for this stock, earnings are there now corp. and BOD need to declare a dividend. Then we have lift off. BTW, I'm not saying a dividend is on the table, however the increase in this companies valuation with a declared dividend, would double its valuation."
Some one must be playing with this stock. SPWH deserves much better price than this
Would be much happier if this run up was accompanied with volume.
SPWH is down 7.07% to $4.60
Wouldn't want to be short.
Sportsman's Warehouse reached an all time high at 15.36
Been a while but I’m in again at $12.90. I think the risk reward is pretty decent at this price. Probably set a stop somewhere under the earnings low as protection of further downside.
I’m pretty confident it will retest 12 month high sometime in next 30 days.Anybody with a diff outlook?
Bottoms pretty much in here we go!
SPWH is down -7.73% to 3.82
Tired of dealing with this stock. It makes no sense that the last two earnings reports killed it but it is down 7.00 from it's high while other retailers like Kirklands and Kohls are going higher and higher. At least I can claim my losses on my taxes. Never again will I get sucked into this stock.
Sportsman's Warehouse reached an all time high at 17.02
"This board is pretty dead, but the stock isn't. I'm a new investor for this company, but the future is looking very bright indeed!"
Zacks indicates that it could beat ER
How much do you think we go up after earnings? 10%?
"Such a great company, such a disappointing stock. I have a feeling one of these days it's going to pop, the fundamentals are just too outstanding. It's just not ""exciting"" enough right now to create a euphoric buy period. I still don't see how this doesn't get to $20 in the next year though. Fundamentals can't be denied forever."
"Dear Investor Relations: Please read your email. Someone might want to inform the CEO that his website(s) are not working as advertised. Simply put, the sportsmanswarehouse.com domain will NOT allow you to checkout. However, the sportsmans.com domain will allow you to checkout.What genius decided it was a good idea to change to a new website during the holiday shopping season? I get it! Someone's KPIs are tied to their bonus and the new website needs to be in place by year's end. Your marketing department didn't read the memo from the CTO. So, they keep using the old website in their email offers. Fix or not? I do NOT care. It's your revenue stream. Please inform the CEO to expect my call on Monday. This assumes anyone in your company pays attention to your ""valued customers.""SELL, SELL, SELL!"
More than double the avg vol. and a new 52 wk intraday high. More days like this in near future? Opinions? I know you’re out there.
I am so happy I did not fill up this morning! This is headed into the $3 range!
Sportsman's Warehouse reached a 52 Week high at 9.29
Hopefully vaccine news will move this up tomorrow.
Looks oversold today! This will easily go up to $14+
Here we go all aboard
this is the news we've been waiting for!!!!
Urban Outfitters beat their earnings so not all retail market suffering. This company is opening new stores so I would expect either they meet or beat earnings estimate
"Insane earnings. Sellside will have to take up full year earnings estimates by 40% (and I think that's still a lowball, they will end up making $2 this year).This is currently trading at 4x EBITDA. At 6x EBITDA (usually assigned to no-growth companies) it would be $21, + 50%"
Still long on this one.
Why did it go up so much today? earnings and revenue were a small miss. can't find info on why a 17% jump
Sportsman's Warehouse is down 7.19% to 16.01
SPWH is down -6.32% to 4.45
"M & M's playing games with the stock!!!!!! (shorts) must be paying them a lot more then long traders at this time! I know an M & M out of San Diego and that's how this works........... A group of small companies representing mostly shorts will pay a fee upfront to use their influence on a stock............... It's against the law but it happens all the time! When the M & M's see or are hired, they evaluate the days and news releases to predict their income flow!.... That's why SPWH is an easy target to short!!!SPWH needs to ""sandbag"" the earnings dates and come out with earnings before the announcements! It will stop the shorts quickly! Game over!!!"
AOBC reports today. Possible buying opportunity tomorrow.
Why is this down they killed earnings
"Revenue and Earnings Increases -- Y over Y ComparisonsFor the fifty two weeks ended January 28, 2017:•Net sales increased by 10.4% to $780.0 million from $706.8 million in fiscal year 2015.

Them selling out to Bass Pro is a sad day for all sportspeople. BP will ruin them just like they did Cabela's.
"I find it a little strange that the ratings Analysis have not changed over night for SPHW. Zacks is still a 2 buy, TD is mostly a Buy, Fidelity is still 7.3 out of possible 10 which is a Buy, no downgrades, nothing negative."
"First, congratulations to all longs. I guess we know why the price was being kept low until now! Second, for those asking what to do, you have two options:1) You can hold on to your shares until the deal is official, likely several months away. You are promised $18 minimum, no matter what and the shares will turn to cash when it's done. 2) You can sell your shares. The price will likely reflect the risk of the merger being rejected by some unforeseen issue, so it will never get quite to $18 until it's a done deal. It is likely not to move much from now, although it should continue to slowly rise towards $18 until the summer.It is probably wisest to sell soon and find your next big winner, but the choice is yours. Great investing with you and GLTA!"
"john--are you still on the sidelines, or did you buy back in?"
I am still not selling till $18 its coming in June. I can wait and will add under $17 again
"just bought 50 april 16 , 15 dollar strike calls at $.97"
"yes this might be a run to force the shorts into a buying/panic frenzy. if we see this again tomorrow, this stock will go to 15 maybe 16, just depends on how fast they can cover that 10% currently shorted on this stock. that's basically 60 million shares shorted from what i can see."
Sportsman's Warehouse reached a 52 Week high at 12.35
SPWH is down 5.74% to $4.27
"Buying more at the open tomorrow. Would like to see this be a 10 bagger. Cabelas and Bass Pro aren't satisfying the market. SW has a new store in Crescent Springs, KY and it is really nice."
Was able to get a nice piece at 15.95 and 16.31 so far.
Really nice earnings once again. Have to see what the market thinks but they are now trading at 7x 2020 earnings and .5x sales with revenue growth of 30-40%. They also have zero debt if you back out the store leases. Not sure what else to say other than this should be a $25 stock.
"Unfortunately, the company either beats by a penny or missed by a penny in most Q’s! They didn’t miss by much on revenue and were in line on earnings! Over reaction from scared money! The company added all the stores they predicted for the year! They are expanding while their competitors are closing stores and missing forecasts by millions! I like my position with this company! I will be adding if the shorts get greedy! Solid company well run and managed!!"
"AOUT just reported a great QTR. Camping, hunting, shooting and fishing are super strong."
SPWH is up 5.50% to $5.37

"I was at the Sportsman Warehouse in Grand Junction, Colorado last Saturday ... People were buying ! Of course its hunting season here but there was a steady stream of hunting related stuff going out the front door. Only 3 registers open so kinda long lines. This store can be real slow at times but not last weekend."
can anyone tell me the estimated closing date of the buyout?
So why the volume and price drop anyone know. Seems the sector is still red hot and the value here is impressive
Market obviously believes that they will only do $1 in earnings in 2021. Unless management comes out and gives guidance to the contrary I am not sure this is going to get moving. 2020 earnings is pegged around $1.9 so the market believes earnings will fall by 50% next year and give the company a multiple of around 13-14x earnings. I know management wants to be conservative but this is the reason the stock will not move today.
SPWH is up 5.58% to $4.54
Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas you were blessed if you held this stock.
"I heard SPWH buyout is being renegotiated to 28 bucks a share, much more fair although still not full value."
based on other retail should be good. guessing we will see 15% pop from here
SO happy I sold out at $4.76!!! Made a nice little pick-up load! If it goes lower I'll buy again! Great company excellent numbers and good growth! No sense trying to hold something that criminals are controlling! I made my money and will wait now!
Based on guidance by management and inventory levels they expect gun sales to normalize some time in 2022 possibly. So is the market going to ignore amazing sales and earnings for another 5-6 quarters? Tired of the gun sales are temporary line. They been saying that for a year now.
SPWH is up 7.35% to 4.09
Spwh. Proved true value and growth stocks. earnings surprise of 137.50%.
I’ve been waiting for a dip buying opportunity and this is it.
Anyone follow this stock?? Any insight for the earnings this week?? Thank
Big wins guys my day just got fantastic
been watching this stock for a while and finally got in at $4.29. I think $5 within a month is realistic
Good time to sell.
For what it is worth I’m back in and buying heavy now. Trading at 9 x the lowest estimate on the street now.
I wonder if this is the dump before the run up it sure looks like it. You never know with these small cap stocks
This is up today? Is something wrong? Lol. I hope this starts the run this company deserves!!!
Only a matter of time before the stock starts to pop the shorts are already getting nervous.
SPWH is down -6.54% to 4.57

"New Corona, CA store opening soon. Great expansion in an industry that stands a chance of being regulated out of part of their business. Gun control/lockdown/empty shelves. Hold in my opinion, buy in at $10."
Blow out numbers for the quarter and a a reminder from management the deal will be completed this summer. Man I was smart adding under $17 what was the MM thinking. Soon I will have my $18 I’m not selling for a penny less.

Why this company is struggling so much? They expect good earnings next week or I am wrong?
SPWH is down -6.99% to 4.86
"Somebody please explain the reasoning why after this company reports it's best quarter in it's history, and obviously future, albeit slightly more normal results are on the horizon, its stock price falls like a stone by 25% to an 11 PE, when you have crazy Tesla and NVDA at stratospherically insane PE's?? Seems like a huge runup is imminent."
"The value here is impressive we just need someone to sell the story to the Wall Street Whales,"
Where is the Wall St Wolf ? Keep making those calls who ever you are
"Why is this down at all? Lol, I am acquiring shares on every drop. Guaranteed (almost) $18 buyout in a few weeks. Not many of those in the markets!"
did the company sell for too little? all the sports stores are killing it!
Great earnings
"Unless there has been a news release or a Q report, I've found that the stocks do the opposite from the AH price... people say it means nothing but, I've watched to many stocks do exactly what I've said...."
"The smack down has begun! The news and shorts have taken this down $1 , get out now! I’ve lived this before! Had to wait for the recent turn up and made great profit but, this is not the time to hold!! JMHO"
Anyone listening to the CC?
Buyout at $18 a share it would appear??
Has formed a base over last 6 trading days. Should soon break to upside and cross 200 day moving avg
"AOUT has agreed to acquire SPWH for $18 in cash per share... any day now... according to a press release Dec 22, 2020"

Go into a store half the inventory all wiped out from ammo to guns to tents to beat spray to survival food
"Credit Suisse backs its Outperform rating on Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings (SPWH -0.2%) in a fresh note issued this morning. Key snippets are posted below.""The company uses an everyday low price strategy on key traffic items, allowing it to compete effectively vs. larger, more expensive destination stores, and mom and pops that buy through distributors, as well as vs. the lower selection mass merchants. Its convenience factor also narrows the competitive gap vs. AMZN in our view.""""The industry has started to rationalize over the last 12 months, after a period excessive store growth. Slower store growth for competitors and Gander's closing positions SPWH as an important distribution channel for vendors. SPWH has yet to see the margin benefits from its improving position, but we would expect it to as sales trend stabilize.""CS has a price target of $8 on SPWH vs. the 52-week trading range of $3.86 to $11.30. The stock traded hands at $5.44 at last check. Looking forward to second quarter earnings reports."
$.76 last quarter profit... this quarter looking for $.40s... and Christmas quarter... probably the best quarter looking for $.26... these numbers will have to be much higher... 6 new stores added this quarter too and hunting season... the estimates need a big raise and so does the stock price... wouldn't surprise me to see $20+
Deal should have been worth more that $18.00 per share. Bass Pro is getting a steal on this company.
"Shorts, thank you for the buying opportunity! I love it when a plan comes together!"
Is this the week we make a 52 week high? Good chance. With this stock so thinly traded it’s like watching paint dry. Be long and patient
Will be interesting to see if these investigations bring anything to light or shake up the buyout
Sportsman's Warehouse reached an all time high at 16.25
"Not that it matters to the market but first price target increase is out this morning from Lake St. Lake Street analyst Mark Smith raised the firm's price target on Sportsman's Warehouse to $23.50 from $22 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares after the company reported third quarter sales and earnings that beat his estimates and consensus forecasts. Continued demand and market share gains led to same-store-sales growth of 40.9% that was driven by strength across all product categories, Smith noted."
Bought more on the dip after hours. Not much to complain about considering the numbers they really killed it. They also paid off about $150 million in outstanding debt aside from $18 million

I’m not selling until I get my $18 so GFYS
Someone has an interest and is working this hard to shake out and wear out positions. Bottom is almost in.
Hey these shorts sure have some pretty lips  for tomm trading this could hit $20
why is there a 27 percentage short on this stock? I can't see a big drop at this price.
Slowly but surely on the right track.
Sportsman's Warehouse reached a 52 Week high at 10.64
We really got hosed on share price this should have been at least $20-$24 a share buyout. This would have been up 15% today regardless and would have continue to run.
SPWH is down -7.13% to 4.82
Go back and see Schaefer sold most all his shares through the last run up! This was no surprise except to Baird. John Barker has a great solid background with a much larger organization! Barker is multi faceted with his GLOBAL OPERATIONS experience! He took Walmart Internet marketing and global customer growth to new levels! Company is reporting on the busiest Q the company has during the year. Should be good Q.
The shorts are going to have a problem tomorrow morning !......
Going long on this one will sell around 5.5 to $6
I bought this because Michael Burry of Scion Capital owns it.
Did anyone notice the 8K published with the SEC TWO DAYS AGO? SPWH (PAID DOWN THE DEBT) by $24+ Million dollars from the last Q until October 17th of this Q!!!! Their total debt is now less then $78 Million! They are going to have a banner QUARTER!!! They will beat numbers by millions folks!
Any idea why this went down? Merger in doubt?
I could not resist jumping in on this one today.
removal of the CEO doesn't set well with wall street ! The shorts see a huge opportunity to take advantage! May be the sweetest buying opportunity you've seen thus far!
Not once during the call did management get asked or talked about enhancing shareholder valueWith al the excess cash flow there needs to be a share buyback or dividend institutedBoth would go a long way towards short attacks and improving future earnings
will this be higher than 17 dollars tomorrow or sink down??
This is defying my reality. America is in turmoil and record numbers of Americas are returning to the woods.
this keeps dropping for some unknown reason.. I guess ill have to bulk up on more shares
"If this goes under $6 i jump back in, sold out and bought $gme at $3"
"As one who frequents these types of stores, Sportsmans Warehouse is a better shopping experience than Bass Pro who bought out Cabelas. Analysts are Overweight on this stock."
Another example of this no logic market.
Why is it going down?
"1.7 million trade so far for a stock with 42.5 million shares, 82 percent institutional holding and 27 percent short as of 7/31/17. So who is selling and driving this stock down ?"
just reported awesome earnings of $1.57 vs .77 and and way above the .48 estimate
SPWH is up 7.02% to 5.79
Spwh to be acquired by great american outdoor group for $18
Two nice days up in a row? Trend forming?
SPWH is up 5.19% to $4.97
The action on this stock is very strange for an $18 buyout that is scheduled to close by years end. One could theoretically buy at 17.65 and get a 2% return in less than 3 months - that's over 8% annualized.
"Great Quarter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This will continue as all their product are in huge demand! Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc. Announces First Quarter 2020 Financial ResultsJune 4, 2020 at 4:05 PM EDTWEST JORDAN, Utah, June 04, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc. (""Sportsman's Warehouse"" or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: SPWH) today announced financial results for the thirteen weeks ended May 2, 2020.“We are excited with our first quarter results. I could not be more proud of the Sportsman’s Warehouse team as we navigated both a global health pandemic and surging demand in our business,” said Jon Barker, Sportsman’s Warehouse CEO. “We were fortunate to be able to safely keep the majority of our stores open for business as well as serve customers through our eCommerce platform. During the first quarter of 2020, our same store sales were up 28.6% compared to the same period last year, led by a surge in demand for firearms and ammunition. We introduced many new customers to the Sportsman’s Warehouse brand during the first quarter and we believe this bodes well for our long-term growth.”Mr. Barker continued, “We believe the COVID-19 situation is impacting consumer behavior and motivating people to spend more time outdoors. Our products fit exceptionally well into an environment in which consumers are spending more time fishing, camping, hiking and hunting. Additionally, we believe the upcoming election cycle has the potential to continue to drive demand for our firearms and ammunition products.”“However, there is significant uncertainty and variability in the current economic environment. Therefore, we will not be providing forward guidance today. We will continue to be financially disciplined as we limit discretionary expenses, pay down debt and preserve our liquidity to effectively navigate these uncertain times. In the long-term, we believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on market share opportunities and changing consumer behavior to become a larger and more profitable company.”For the thirteen weeks ended May 2, 2020:Net sales were $246.8 million, an increase of $72.8 million, or 41.8%, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The net sales increase was primarily due to a surge in demand for firearms, ammunition and to a lesser extent, other essential products, including water filtration, food preparation and dehydrated food, as well as strong growth in our eCommerce platform compared to the prior year period. Same store sales increased 28.6% during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019. Net loss was $1.1 million compared to a net loss of $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted net income was $0.4 million compared to an adjusted net loss of $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2019 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures”). Adjusted EBITDA was $8.2 million compared to $0.4 million in the prior year (see ""GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures""). Gross profit was $74.8 million or 30.3% of net sales, as compared to $54.2 million or 31.1% of net sales in the prior year period, a year-over-year increase of $20.6 million in gross profit and an 80-basis point decrease in gross profit margin. Diluted loss per share was $0.03 compared to a diluted loss per share of $0.13 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.01 compared to adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.13 for the comparable period in prior year (see ""GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures"").Balance sheet highlights as of May 2, 2020:Total debt was $144.2 million, consisting of $118.4 million outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit facility and $25.7 million outstanding under the term loan, net of unamortized debt issuance costs. This is a reduction of $31.1 million of debt year-over-year. Total liquidity was $82.4 million as of the end of the first quarter of 2020, comprised of $60.3 million of availability on the revolving credit facility and $22.1 million of cash, as compared to $41.0 million in total liquidity at the end of the first quarter of 2019.Second Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Outlook:We will not be issuing forward guidance at this time.Conference Call Information:A conference call to discuss first quarter 2020 financial results is scheduled for today, June 4, 2020, at 4:30 PM Eastern Time. The conference call will be webcast and may be accessed via the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.sportsmans.com."
"made 100k today, closed my position. off to Cabo! TaTa!"
This is going back to $5 based on fundamental undervaluation and improving outlook. The fact that they are picking up some of #$%$ customers is huge. As long as gun control is limited to tighter criminal and mental health background checks - this stock is going to benefit nicely from competitors leave the market for certain types of weapons.
"Looks like shorts are pushing this back down to retest the $4.00 range! There hasn't been a retest of the bottom and there is a gap at $4.43 that needs to be covered before this goes higher then it has at $5.95. It tried hard this morning but, it has hit the roof for the day. Looks like we'll be headed to close the gap before heading into the $7.00 range! Huge gap at $7.43-$7.49 then onto the $12.00 range! JMHO"
this stock got hosed this AM and I was a buyer ! Will be making $$$ on the way back up! The new CEO is so much better then the CEO that just left! He has a handle on the business because he has run a larger organization at Walmart and took them GLOBAL by using the internet to leverage costs and add income streams to the business! They will blow away the numbers in a few weeks!

"just filed by SPWH today new 8K that lowers the interest rate on it's loans by .25%, plus extends payoff dates out until 2022 and increases the amount of previously obtained loans to $150 million! That is significant! The banks have looked at their books and see the clear sailing ahead of earnings and the retail debacle! This is great news for shareholders and SPWH in general! Hold your shares kids, we're going up!"
SPWH is down -16.46% to 4.01
How hasn't this stock popped? Their financials look great! Revenue and profits are increasing and it seems they have paid down a lot of their long term debt. Going long on this one.
"Camping World just had a great Qtr. RGR had record earnings selling guns. They said gun sales were not slowing down. IMO, this stock will be at $20 soon than you think. They should have great earnings again."
Should have sold this months ago and bought the other outdoor stocks whose price have appreciated significantly. The buyout has really hurt us shareholders. Company was sold way too cheap.
Do you think we will go back up next week? It seems pretty bad today
SPWH is up 5.56% to $4.75
Who on here is still holding?
SPWH is up 11.91% to 5.26

"203,000 gun purchase background checks performed on Black Friday, single day record. 18,000 more background checks than last year Black Friday."
