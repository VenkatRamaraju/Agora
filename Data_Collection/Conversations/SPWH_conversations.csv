$.76 last quarter profit... this quarter looking for $.40s... and Christmas quarter... probably the best quarter looking for $.26... these numbers will have to be much higher... 6 new stores added this quarter too and hunting season... the estimates need a big raise and so does the stock price... wouldn't surprise me to see $20+
So why the volume and price drop anyone know. Seems the sector is still red hot and the value here is impressive
For what it is worth I’m back in and buying heavy now. Trading at 9 x the lowest estimate on the street now.
Someone has an interest and is working this hard to shake out and wear out positions. Bottom is almost in.
"First, congratulations to all longs. I guess we know why the price was being kept low until now! Second, for those asking what to do, you have two options:1) You can hold on to your shares until the deal is official, likely several months away. You are promised $18 minimum, no matter what and the shares will turn to cash when it's done. 2) You can sell your shares. The price will likely reflect the risk of the merger being rejected by some unforeseen issue, so it will never get quite to $18 until it's a done deal. It is likely not to move much from now, although it should continue to slowly rise towards $18 until the summer.It is probably wisest to sell soon and find your next big winner, but the choice is yours. Great investing with you and GLTA!"
I have had enough I am gonna make some calls and get the squeeze going this week. Get out of the way or lose
Really nice earnings once again. Have to see what the market thinks but they are now trading at 7x 2020 earnings and .5x sales with revenue growth of 30-40%. They also have zero debt if you back out the store leases. Not sure what else to say other than this should be a $25 stock.
"I heard SPWH buyout is being renegotiated to 28 bucks a share, much more fair although still not full value."
How hasn't this stock popped? Their financials look great! Revenue and profits are increasing and it seems they have paid down a lot of their long term debt. Going long on this one.
Should have sold this months ago and bought the other outdoor stocks whose price have appreciated significantly. The buyout has really hurt us shareholders. Company was sold way too cheap.
Sell SPWH buy BGFV the mother of all squeezes is coming on Set 17
"Not that it matters to the market but first price target increase is out this morning from Lake St. Lake Street analyst Mark Smith raised the firm's price target on Sportsman's Warehouse to $23.50 from $22 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares after the company reported third quarter sales and earnings that beat his estimates and consensus forecasts. Continued demand and market share gains led to same-store-sales growth of 40.9% that was driven by strength across all product categories, Smith noted."
Any idea what is going on here? Seems a very odd drop with a buyout price of $18.00. Maybe something is up?
The action on this stock is very strange for an $18 buyout that is scheduled to close by years end. One could theoretically buy at 17.65 and get a 2% return in less than 3 months - that's over 8% annualized.
Not once during the call did management get asked or talked about enhancing shareholder valueWith al the excess cash flow there needs to be a share buyback or dividend institutedBoth would go a long way towards short attacks and improving future earnings
Deal should have been worth more that $18.00 per share. Bass Pro is getting a steal on this company.
Wow what a pay day! Good stuff for everyone that held on there.
just reported awesome earnings of $1.57 vs .77 and and way above the .48 estimate
