This is the last stock I ever buy because some “smart” guy on CNBC says it’s a great investment. I swear.
"Rug pull is coming this week or next. I’ve shorted $LYV - no sales, tons of debt and no plans to restore. When valuations matter again very very shortly, this piggy will deflate. Good luck to all. Hope the longs have hedged."
"I'm going to purchase 500 call options on ER day cause I know they'll report zero earnings with a chance to go BK. The stock will pop $10, and I'll be rich!"
"Hurting my Puts, but I am buying again, just pushing my expirations out to June. Costs more, but I think its worth it."
"Can't decide if it's funny, or just sad how these talking heads are trying to guess what LYV will report for Q1. Unavoidable fact is, Q2 is a big goose egg. 0 events, 0 sales, nothing but refunds. Q3 is shaping up to be more of the same. Reschedules are a shell game, only taking away from next year's results. I wouldn't give you a plug nickle for a venue right now. Why this isn't in the single digits is the real mystery. Buffett got out of airlines saying their world has fundamentally changed. That can't be more true for Live Nation. $40 in cash today is better than $4 Friday."
"For the record.......Its not how many cars you make, Its how many cars you sell. This is important.The ENTIRE automotive sector is in complete collapse, and Tesla just happens to be in the automotive sector.Berlin is on hold, model S is real tired, model X is a warranty nightmare, model 3/Y not sure if the 3 will give up sales to the 3, no semi, no roadster, no 400000 orders for the Y, no robotaxi, no fsd (yet people paid for it), $11.6B debt......Tesla in 17 years has NEVER had an annual profit, and that streak is very safe.$spy$tvix$sqqq$xom$lyv$grub$uber$vac"
"Huge day for LN! Congrats to all shorts! We all know that the drive-in, so called concerts, will be cancelled, and their earnings report will be a disaster! The Saudi's will be selling as well everybody else, if they're smart. Longs, join the crowd! Only green money ahead for the short side! Steak, lobster, and fine wine for all."
"good luck shorting this stock. took my losses and found other opportunities. The biggest part about investing is learning to accept losses and walk away. Something is artificial about this stock and put and call holders are down 50-70 percent due to IV and stagnation. It's obviously being held into place by the big fish in the pond. You can sit here and wait for it to tank as it should or get money from every other direction. Made my money back by leaving this fake stock, and following the trend"
My $35 puts expire tomorrow - just may pay out after all!Anyone see Art lately? Somebody should check on him...
"All signs point to a bad outcome regarding future prospects for Live Nation. The NFL, NBA, and MLB are all talking about limited to no fan attendance. Prospects for future concerts are other live music events are virtually nonexistent at this point. Who in their right mind thinks this is going to change anytime soon?"
This is holding up really well. I expect this to pop after consolidating here. $100 will happen! $LYV
"How does a company stock with no income rise 18% in one week? Perhaps I just don't understand how the stock market works, but it's not practical."
"On March 12, 2020 the world had a total of 4981 Covid-19 deathsOn April 12, 2020 the world had a total of 114179 Covid-19 deaths.109198 Covid-19 deaths in 30 days. Ever think about whats changed in the world in the last 30 days?? We really should have not had the best week in stocks in 45 years last week. imo$tsla$wing$lyv$lvs$tvix"
Hi Guys. Just got back from vacation at the Bahamas. Good to see LYV is still strong after earnings. What did I say about manipulation at the finest? 
"April 13, 2020 11:31 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- NewsThe coronavirus pandemic has brought industries come to a standstill, and one health expert says large gatherings such as conferences, concerts and sporting events may not return to normal until fall 2021, according to The New York Times Magazine.“Restarting the economy has to be done in stages, and it does have to start with more physical distancing at a work site that allows people who are at lower risk to come back,"" Zeke Emanuel, the director of the Healthcare Transformation Institute at the University of Pennsylvania, told the publication. Benzinga is covering every angle of how the coronavirus affects the financial world.

"Based on the performance of this stock, I'm thinking of initiating a new ETF called CARE (Cruise lines, Airlines, Resorts and Entertainment). It is sure to be a big winner!"
I hope someone sensible looks at this equity and downgrades. But they could have done this when ER came out. That is why I think it will take a few weeks as long some effective vaccine news does not come out. Any sensible fund would take their losses and move to better value equities.
"Sooooo strong! love it! I tell you again, this is going much much higher!"
"From BZ NewswireLive Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) - BuyPrior to the COVID-19 shutdown, live entertainment ticketing company Live Nation was firing on all cylinders.

"Wake me when I can go to a concert or LYV hits $20, whichever comes first."
"A statement from Motley Crue:We wanted to reach out to all of our amazing fans and let you know that we've been hard at work preparing an amazing show. Our priority during this unprecedented time is to make sure that we are being as thoughtful and responsible as possible in the decisions we are making regarding The Stadium Tour and that we are putting the fans' health, well being and safety first and foremost. We are currently weighing all options and are awaiting further direction from the powers that be. Our goal is to have an official update to everyone by June 1 outlining exactly how we will proceed. In the meantime, stay safe and healthy. We cant wait to see you all again."""
"ER has been delayed, pushed back to Aug 6th after MKT close.Delay means LVY is looking to find more loans, share offerings."
"Two weeks ago Emanuel Ariel Z, a Board of Director, sold 71,394 shares (practically all of his shares). My intuition says he knew the pandemic would shut down Live Nation."
LYV might announce additional share offerings to compensate for huge loss and Cash Burn!Earning Report is tomorrow after Market close
soon as this hits 100 im expecting a big sell off
Another huge day today! Covid is done! Market = up up up!! Best be scared!!
"they already cancelled the rose bowl parade and thats in January cruise lines and live nation are doomed this isnt worth half of it current price it will drop below 40 at some point i have added to my long position on every spike over 14,000 now cant wait for e.r. what can the guidance possibly be "" we are going to try to get people to sit in there car and listen to a concert on their radio lol "" you can do that for free with youtube"
"Just looking at the basics here. The debt to cap on this company based on what's published here is a ratio of 136%!!! There are levered companies and then there's Live Nation. I briefly read the 4Q earnings call and it seems their CEO is optimistic that if they have any liquidity issues there's roughly $900 m in borrowing capacity to tap. Remarkable. I just have to stop there. There's nothing operationally that will drive revenue until 2022 and he again optimistically says there's ""pent up"" demand. This is a phrase that's subject to interpretation. It's not ""pent up"" its ""make up"" shows and its not like the artists that have to fund their own way will double up on shows in 2022. Beyond Pearl Jam, who is going to fill their venues in 2022? Maybe U2 will announce a world tour? Who else? I have to laugh a little when just now the price of this absolute dog #$%$ stock (based on the financials) is going up. I'm not even going to project a reality valuation here. All I can say is that this stock is not worth the $89.29 I'm seeing now. It's not, but there it is."
Interesting article about tickets refunds.
concerts by July?
https://labusinessjournal.com/news/2020/may/25/live-nation-credit-downgraded/
Rating is B2. A rating within speculative grade Moody's Long-term Corporate Obligation Rating. Obligations rated B2 are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk. This stock will go to 20s by October after the regular flu season picks up. The reg flu and COVID 19 is definitely going to be a mess (of course not according to Trump doctors). Bankruptcy is a good possibility. Of course one knows bankruptcy is to get rid of the creditors and investors and they will start another company with a new name.
"This really wants to move higher then big orders push it down, don’t want to use the term manipulation but it surely looks suspicious"
Is there news or is this a pure short squeeze? Small buys only 100 and 200 lots are moving this. Must be all the millennials on their Robin Hood app buying. Summer revenue will be lost....nothing is going to open for months. Looks Short term overbought and close to a nice short entry point?
"I think there's some shady activity going on with LYV, like money laundering. They are sitting on huge piles of cash, over $2 Billion, they refuse to refund their customers, change the language and terms of what can be refunded and keep moving the goal posts on when and how people can even apply to start the process of a refund. The NY State AG is now starting to investigate them. According to Live Nation:“Live Nation’s plan is to continue offering an opportunity for refunds on all of its rescheduled shows as new dates are set. We anticipate those windows will begin to open up on an event by event basis in the next few weeks.”Shifty legal speak, not wanting to release customers money back to them."
I’ll admit when I’m wrong. I timed it a day too early.
"It is amazing that this stock is going up when others are going down. Vaccine trial delays, covid, no profits, no revenues for a year."
Thanks so much for the price support this morning guys I was able to get fully loaded up on puts to sell you all next week! Much appreciated!
"Down 1% to up 1.31% in 10 minutes. What was the news, another power bill that can't be paid? Jkjkjk, obviously there was no news and the institutions didn't like being down for 2 hours this morning."
"CFRA updated its research report on LYV. New target price = US$40.""04/07/20 13:57 pm ET ... CFRA REDUCES OPINION ON SHARES OF LIVE NATION TO HOLD FROM BUY ( 34.51***): We cut our 12-month target price by $25 to $40 on ’20 EV/EBITDA of 19.0x, above peers. We cut ’20 EPS estimate of $0.36 to a $1.36 loss and cut ’21 EPS by $0.20 to $0.50. Our action partly reflects an uncertain duration and/or extent of the continuing negative impact of the Covid-19 outbreak, after LVY’s mass global cancellations of its core live events in the U.S. and international markets. In late-February, LYV alluded to its relatively limited geographic exposure to the Covid-19 outbreak, noting its diversification and attendance that skews much higher in H2. However, with LYV’s key revenue streams all but shut down, we now expect the ongoing disruption could last well into H2, with a likely sharp downturn in attendance, ticket sales, and other key performance indicators. Also, with about $3.3 billion of long-term debt, the Covid-19 outbreak raises the specter of increased liquidity risk for LYV, already on credit watch for a potential downgrade by some of the major ratings agencies"""
"Like I said with $LYV, the 2nd most overvalued stock in the market, if you want to get FINRA and the SEC’s attention on $CVNA, contact their employees on LinkedIn addition to filing a complaint. Hindenburg, etc. would probably be interested, too."
"There is no revenue stream and LYV themselves said that. I think the mutual funds are selling it but also increasing the price by buying small amounts. Once they are done, then it will drop. Until then!"
Share price completely out of touch with reality. Nothing new about that though.
We are in a bubble when this stock is 20 percent higher than pre coved levels with not even half the revenue
94$ by March 2021
"I tell you guys that it is high time to move away from shorting this. I did this 4 months ago and lost quite a bit. Then I put money into SPACs and other tech and doubled my investments and more. I suggest looking at RSVAU, PCPL, NGA, VGAC. Don't look at ones that have already gone up. DYDD"
I’m at a loss of words. This is borderline money laundering at this point. Zero revenue with a business that wasn’t doing great to begin with during its highest sales months. It increases today during a market selloff. Casinos went down yet this stock went up. Y’all are being bamboozled into buying this.
Ok I’ll be completely honest. Don’t own this stock but I do work in the entertainment industry. I personally know many people that “Did “ work for Live Nation for over 29 and 30 plus years. Live Nation is quietly “terminated” multiple top Board members and local Promoters very recently. I know this because I have personally talked to these former employees. These top tier employees have been terminated no furloughed but fired! One employee/ friend has worked for LN as the top Michigan promoter for over 30 years. He released internal information about a memo that was leaked how Live Entertainment will not be close to normal until 2022 at best. In my opinion this is one of the most manipulative companies I’ve ever had to work with. I would not own this stock or recommend it to anyone long or short! This company in my opinion can’t even come close to being transparent to save their stock holding life’s! Stock holder’s beware! Just my honest opinion.
Liberty Media John Malone is about to purchase Live Nation and roll it over into Sirius XM Radio Holdings (SIRI)
https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9616601/2021-concerts-canceled-festivals-covid-19-delta-variant
Bon Jovi just cancelled entire 2020 tour
Mnuchin & Powell pumping air into the market today. The FED can not print our way out of this. There will be a reckoning. LYV made no money before the pandemic. 1/4 filled venues won't be good for the bottom line or the fan experience. If they re-open venues there will be contact tracing and if anyone becomes infected as a result LYV will be on the hook for lots of high cost and distracting litigation. This IMO should be trading in the 30's. It will soon. It's not a matter of if but when.
Anybody read about the tame impala concert at the gorge Washington last night on Twitter? What a disaster. Totally missed managed by Live Nation. Folks sat in cars for hours 5 miles out with no ability to attend show. Zero messaging from Live Nation. This venue mgmt is a joke.
The people have won against Ticketmaster!!https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9360740/ticketmaster-preparing-refund-plan-for-thousands-of-postponed-shows
"Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation, are facing legal action over unpaid refunds for events delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic, court papers show.Ticketmaster, which processes sales to Live Nation events, is being accused of retroactively revising its policies around March 14 so customers would be given their money back only for canceled events, not those rescheduled or indefinitely postponed, according to court papers obtained by FOX Business.It's an issue that's not unique to Ticketmaster. From sports games to concerts, events across the country remain in limbo for the foreseeable future, leaving many ticketholders in the dark about whether they will get their cash.Prior to the outbreak, the ticketing company assured customers they would receive a refund if an event were postponed, rescheduled or canceled, the lawsuit stated. That policy, followed until at least March 13, was largely the reason why customers paid ""premium prices for tickets and substantial fees directly to Ticketmaster,"" the lawsuit stated.The mass cancellation of live events as states across the nation shut down to curb the spread of COVID-19, however, created unprecedented refund demand.Not only were events from tours to awards shows, conventions, and festivals scrapped in rapid succession, concert tours were postponed, movie releases shifted and Broadway went dark.Health experts now predict that live concerts won't make a full comeback until the fall of 2021 at the earliest, according to the New York Times."
"LOL! What a joke of a stock! If ever there was proof of a bubble in the stock market, this is it. More debt, no revenue and it's trading at an alltime high? Rigggghht! LOL"
The CNBC TV snake oil salesmen are pumping the top because they got in late. The time to buy has long passed. Don't be a bag holder. Just shorted.
"If you look at a one year chart, you see rolling hills. It appears that we are at the top of another rolling hill. Will this time be different because we are strengthening into a more possible opening of events? Thoughts?"
Wow it’s good to be back with my long friends. Holy smokes all the shorties from a few months ago are gone!! Whooaaaa
Also keep in mind that they have held a lot of revenue for deferred concerts. Even when life goes back to normal there will be a year of concerts that were already paid for in 2018 or early 2019 (not additional/new revenue). They still have my money from a few concerts that keep being deferred to a later date.
"Short squeeze gone, concerts canceled, another pile of debt coming, no revenue, and more than 50% of concerts canceled until next year. Oh yea and even on a GOOD YEAR they only made a lousy $100m profit on $10b LOL. $10 coming end of the year"
Josh Brown nailed it.
"Finally net positive on shuffling in and out of short positions. Fundamentally, should be in the $30s. Chart shows retracement to ~ $37 or about the level the Saudi money came in. We’ll see."
"I would like to invest in a company who cooks their books, uses strong arm tactics on their customers, who says we won't take a paycheck but do, and says everything is rosy but has no revenue to speak of. Any ideas?"
"""Following Live Nation’s results, Berenberg Bank analyst Brett Knoblauch maintained a Hold rating on the stock WITH A PRICE TARGET OF $40"".That's right, $40. Not $51.77"
"OK, razor has me scared on the news. I'm covering and going long!"
and look at all the blue dots (available seats for sale) which doesn't even count the hidden hold backs they need to hide to make it look better than it really is. They are dead. The odd show has people holding their seats due to demand like Pearl Jam at MSG but for the most part anything rescheduled over and over AND anything recently put onsale (very few new events onsale in the last 90 days) has not sold well at all. Summer 2022 NOT 2021. They didn't even offer season plans OR lawn packages. Another 2-3B burn coming and ZERO revenue. Let it go you stubborn tutes. Y'all have NOTHING and are losing BIG TIME!!!
Cancelled
Could someone please explain the recent $LYV offering? Stock at $90.10? Huh? Thanks.
"Live Concerts are coming soon!!# I can't wait! Drive-in concerts, check out Keith Urban's show. 300 to 400 cars, 60 minute sets, audio via FM radio, text for concessions, stay in your car, BIG money maker for LN! This stock is going to sky rocket. The past Arkansas show which had about 200 people made millions! LN will try anything to made a buck, Arkansas lost money, drive-in's same thing. Keep paying debt with debt, that's a financial success story."
"Was reading the refund statement from Live Nation. "" Under Live Nation's new policy, customers holding tickets to events with no new date will be able to request a refund after waiting 60 days from the time their postponement was announced; they will then have 30 days to ask for their money back.Then on top of this, after you request your refund, you will receive it in as little as 30 days. As little as? Is this a joke? This is meant to spin the customer. Most will read it and say, Ill get my money soon. Thats not going to happen. You will probably wait 6 months for a refund. It appears that they do not have the funds to refund all of these tickets. This is a ticking time bomb. A large portion of the cancelled and the postponed shows are Live Nation Shows. First, they wait as long as possible to postpone the event. Then once you wait 30 days and there is no date, you can request a refund. How long from there? This is shady, Very shady. I wouldn't trust Rapino. He's changing his company stance every week. At first, he promised no layoffs, not reductions in pay, or bonuses owed and he is not staying true to his word. Look for more layoffs this week, more summer tour cancellations. Look for the Motley Crue which would have probably grossed 250M to be moved. ( This is the largest tour that is still on the books that hasn't cancelled. )"
If you really want to know the status of concerts go to TicketMaster website and click on a show/ tour/ artist. Go through the entire process of acting like you want to buy a ticket ... all the way through until payment. At the last tier before actually buying the ticket you will notice an icon in the top right corner of the screen regarding the most recent information on the event. You will see all postponements and how none have mentioned the next new scheduled date... try it for yourself.
who is buying it?
"People are delusional on LYV. The EARLIEST a vaccine will be readily available for everyone is the second half of 2021. And that's IF a safe, effective vaccine will be readily available at all. In the meantime, LYV has effectively ZERO revenue and a MASSIVE continuous cash burn. How long can a company survive under that scenario? They were already losing money before the pandemic! Watch this ticker bleed during the 2nd Covid wave. Tutes can't prop this up forever...when one concedes, the others will follow."
Once the dam breaks on this one the outflow will be massive. It rose on the now largely abandoned Easter date. In actuality the ban on large events is going to be in place for the foreseeable future. No one is doubting that fact. Meanwhile they will bleed $ and owe debt repayments. Someone please make the bull case for this because so just don't see it. Thx
Does anyone know how are they planning to make money in 2020 and 2021 (first half at least)?
$92! here it is!
"Trying over 92 again. Will it, can it, hold"
"How is this faring better than the broad market and who is buying this today? I just don't get it. This business is dead for the foreseeable future, and they couldn't turn a profit under perfect conditions."
"Here the reason why customers can’t get a refund for a postponed show as per Ticketmaster:“I think there’s a lot of misperception about Ticketmaster,” Joe Berchtold, president of Live Nation, the company that owns Ticketmaster, said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Squawk Alley.” “Ticketmaster doesn’t sell these tickets and sit on a mountain of cash. Ticketmaster sells tickets and gives the cash over to the venues where the events are held.”What I don't understand is that I've also read articles mentioning that tickets sellers aren't getting paid either. So where is the money???"
"Humpty Dumpty setting up for a big fall! No way lyv produces good numbers in his environment and at some point, numbers will matter."
Really Jeffries thinks that this stock can hit 55. May be it goes to 20 and then comes back up??https://www.barrons.com/articles/6-underdog-stocks-to-ride-the-post-pandemic-recovery-51597423559?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
Where's yappy Razor? Did he sleep in?
"The highest that LYV saw before the pandemic hit was $75/share, so why should they trade at $85 now when they had zero revenue in 2020, hardly any revenue in 2021 with an unknown future revenue path???"
"Breakeven 2022 (may be) and very high debt. The headline is deceiving and sounds like they are breaking even now but the text inside that it may happen in 2020.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/loss-making-live-nation-entertainment-153607219.htmlLive Nation Entertainment currently has a debt-to-equity ratio of over 2x. Generally, the rule of thumb is debt shouldn’t exceed 40% of your equity, which in this case, the company has significantly overshot. Note that a higher debt obligation increases the risk in investing in the loss-making company."
I can't imagine their overhead is high. Yeah the revenue isn't there but what's their operating cost monthly? If they aren't bleeding much money and their debt is low then lenders are more inclined to extend a life line.
I occasionally look at this stock but I don't understand how it could be so valuable and never earn a dime.... I only invest in stocks that have a positive PE ratio...
Can someone explain to me how the hell the CEO said they can make it through the end of the year? Their Accounts Payable and Accrued liabilites are over 2B. Those are all services they have CONSUMED. Their cash flow statement appears to show they use about 230m a month that they MIGHT be able to get down to 150m (for debt). How on earth will they not be eating all their cash in 6 months. Especially since only 900m of it is free cash not tied to the sales of pre-sold concert tickets (again a liability in deferred rev). They then have another 900m revolving credit. None of which will cover just their short term liabilities.
"Let me start by saying I do not own this stock. However I do work in the entertainment industry. I can tell you that large gatherings and live events are far from coming back anytime soon. Concerts and artists are already quietly rescheduling touring events to august of 2021. That being said the conversations have now moved to if the fall of 2021 is even realistic. Personally speaking the protocol for hosting small live event like recorded award shows is very very expensive. We have to constantly take daily covid test. While at the venue PPE gear is a constant standard and if violated you will be removed from the venue. We are all waiting for an approved vaccine, but are slowly realizing that this still will not be the answer. The additional cost, distribution, compliance is all getting more and more distant. I say all of this with a heavy heart. For over 22 years this was my work, my love , my passion. I have seen enough. I am now personally looking for a new career path , and live events just doesn’t work. This trend is real and not going away. Putting all your eggs in the vaccine basket is not the answer. Just my personal experience. But life goes on while the business model changes!"
"Blows my mind that this stock is trading so high lol. Some kinda voodoo going on. Concerts been cancelled again, holding onto tons of customer money without confirmed rescheduled dates. If when they dont happen they'll owe millions in refund. Think this is why the books are looking so healthy right now."
"to the two lumps that replied to my previous post, guess what, the stock is up today. should move up all week."
Are drive-in shows coming soon?
Looks like the OCESA acquisition is back in play. The recent $450M stock offering is to pay for it. I think that is what is driving this run.
"Downside risk is MASSIVE. With increasing risk there will be no sports attendance or concerts(except virtual which is nonsense), there is no revenue to be had and certainly no profits. This is $20-25 stock at best and that is IF they don't go bankrupt."
$529 mill cash spent in 3 months and everything is just “fine”
"Is LYV a buy?Even before the pandemic, Live Nation was struggling with a sizable debt burden as its 2019 interest expense of $157.5 million made up nearly half of its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating profit at $324.8 million. With its debt already up by more than 50% this year, interest expense will also surge, cutting into its already thin net margin. That means that even the effects of pent-up demand on its recovery will be muted as the company will need to grow operating income significantly just to get back to where it was on the bottom line before the pandemic.Add it all up, and Live Nation is a company with a solid business model, but with a lot of a debt, thin profits, and operations in a mature industry that has been kneecapped by the coronavirus pandemic. Given those circumstances, why this stock is trading near all-time highs is a mystery, especially because when it was worth the same value at the start of 2020, expectations of a record year were baked into that price.Analysts are still expecting substantial losses for 2021 and for revenue to be down about a third from 2019 results, showing that the road to recovery will be a long one. At this point, Live Nation still faces strong headwinds for at least another quarter or two and will likely have to borrow more money. The stock looks overvalued for now, trading at pre-pandemic levels. Investors are better off looking elsewhere for recovery stocks.There is no bull-case for this stock for the foreseeable future. Absurdly overvalued."
Does Live Nation have insurance to cover Ticket sales for refund to customers for canceled events?
Mark Cuban bought in LYV around $44-45 per share about two weeks ago. We know Mark is a smart man. Buying 25% better than Mr. Cuban seems smart to me???
"pre COVID-19 this was one of the best companies....can someone explain how a company that has not made any money in the past 3 months and will continue to do so for the rest of this year, is having a share price at this level...also will human behaviour change and will their model be profitable in years to come? Am I missing something?"
"Rent not paid, credit cards not paid, oh let's go to a concert..."
Dude. 30% spike within 8% of ATH? So this stock is worth 8% less with no revenue compared to when it....made money?
"Putting aside the question of when people will feel comfortable attending crowded events, or whether attendance levels will return to pre-Covid levels any time soon, aren't LYV investors concerned that the crazy inflation in ticket prices will hit a brick wall given the economic destruction? Concert prices have quadrupled in the last 20 years while sport events tickets are up 136% since 1997 - still far outpacing inflation."
Is this a bio-tech stock? Did LN come up with vaccine in clinical trial?
most of the posters here think this stock is worth 10 bucks. wake up.
"We should expect announcements of cancellations of whole regular seasons of professional sports soon. Once it does the writing is on the wall for no large entertainment gatherings occurring throughout the summer which is a primary earnings season for LYV. Fall/Winter brings a potential 2nd wave of influenza and we should put SARS-CoV-2 in the same category which means events would also be disrupted. Cancellations will require refunds, (LiveNation has been using 'rescheduled ' vs. cancelled as an excuse to hold irate fans funds), which will erase hundreds of millions from their cash cushion. Absent outside investment the situation looks grim for LYV the rest of this year, or until a widespread vaccine is approved. Trade cautiously and stay safe."
"When do we really think people will be comfortable going to stadium concerts or sporting events? 635 healthy young men tested positive on the USS Roosevelt, many of them asymptomatic. I can’t imagine my family entering a 60,000 head stadium until a reliable vaccine is developed and universally implemented."
can't imagine the $ they have refunded already and the forward guidance has got to be bad. combine that with huge debt and even a surging should leave this behind
LYV has not yet confirmed that the 23rd is earnings release date. They may have some accounting issues!
"It's been asked before, are there any longs on this board? If so, state your case. I'd like to know your reasoning."
"doesn't look like summer concerts will happen and yet the fix is in for this stock to be at pre-pandemic level. Mark Cuban and the Saudis, rich get richer. a salute."
"Live Nation trades like tutes trade it back and forth to increase the price. Only down 11 or 12% for the year, trading at 2018 levels (when the company was healthy), stock rises constantly despite essentially zero revenue, huge cash burn, massive losses, no revenue for the foreseeable future, terrible earnings, consistent earnings misses despite miserable expectations, pending lawsuits re: refunds, and more. If it quacks like a duck... Here's the form to file a complaint with FINRA: https://www.finra.org/investors/have-problem/file-complaint/complaint-centerAnd the SEC: https://www.sec.gov/oiea/Complaint.html"
"No doubt that losses continue, but most important is the future trend on the conf call tomorrow at this time."
is this drop real???
Buying more 5/17 puts. Betting the Motley news is out to insiders. That's why 2M shares traded into close and a 60k block sold last night! Down she goes
https://www.livenationentertainment.com/2020/05/live-nation-entertainment-reports-first-quarter-2020-results/Over 90% of fans opt to keep tickets over refunds? I doubt that. So many shows not rescheduled yet that won't play. Smoke and mirrors indeed.
"Ask yourself if the market really wants a quick result virus test. It's been a beautiful ride up, so hmmmm! Some would say, sure it does, things back to normal. Planes full, stadiums full, restaurants full, the heck with social distancing. Things will be great, so the feds get out, stay at home stocks get crushed, liquidity becomes secondary as stock valuation becomes the barometer, and basically the market gets a haircut. LYV, well, it gets crushed!"
Wonderful how the stock of a company with absolutely no revenues can trade near its all time high---yeah that price it was trading at when concerts and revenue was booming.----which makes this one of the most baffling of the re-opening stocks....
Nice $2 pump from Josh Brown on CNBC.
Do people realize that there will be next to no revenue coming on for over a year even once things open back up? They are already approaching g a year of backlogged concerts that are already paid for...most payments have not been refunded and rather postponed.
"Just out: Ticketmaster's vetting plans for concert goers. I guess they have no choice, but this is such a monumental hassle that I am afraid it will literally decimate attendance. Not really good news at all for the tickets industry. In fact, even requiring all ticket holders to have a smart phone with their app installed is a hurdle for the older generation, believe it or not.https://nypost.com/2020/11/11/ticketmaster-to-require-negative-covid-19-test-vaccination/"
"On Aug. 3, Live Nation Entertainment reported its financial results for the second quarter of 2021. The company reported a positive adjusted operating income, or AOI, of about $10 million for the quarter, after five straight quarters of negative AOI. Live Nation’s LTM AOI as of June 30, 2021, was approximately negative $706 million. Read the full covenants analysis here: https://reorg.com/live-nation-tear-sheet/"
Here's a bull case since I haven't been able to find one in a long time. What happens if fans are forced to pay 4x the price due to 25% capacity limitations? I'm thinking that there will still be some takers. Any thoughts?
"Why buy long at these levels? I have a short position that I’m continuing to cost-average up thanks to that Saudi pump and retails thinking this is the recovery. If you bought here and closed your eyes, would you be green in 5 years...? Probably. But why do that? Why not make money on the way down and on the way up. I plan to convert some of my short position to a long position in the low $30s or maybe even $20s.Live Nation makes their real dough on big attendance concerts and sporting events WITH FANS. Those will be some of the last things to “return to normal” and even small venue shows will be affected. There are two things traders simply aren’t pricing in right now:1) Consumer reticence to attend ANY show of any capacity over say 50 people until there’s a reliable vaccine (Q1 2021 at the earliest) 2) Recession driven by job loss that will not be temporary. Trust me. Companies will use this as an excuse to trim fat. You know how many companies have realized through this that they had 10 people doing the jobs of 7. Plus they don’t have the cash reserves to rehire back to prior capacity anyway. This was not a 14-day pause. The chance to stave off a recession is long gone. And what happens in a recession: Less discretionary consumer spending. Where does that hit the hardest? Entertainment & Leisure sector.Coalesce these two factors and this stock is expensive at this price. I don’t see how this thing doesn’t bleed for end of Q1 (which we’ll see reflected in the report) and all of Q2, Q3, and Q4. Q1 2021 is the soonest for real recovery for this stock.Don’t buy a ticket to $LYV’s downturn when you can get both the refund and the credit instead if you’re simply rational and disciplined."
"Trump said he wants the NFL to go on as planned in September like the rest of the world would like to see. It symbolizes world recovery and that we are back on our feet. We all want that, but people are skeptical about his prediction. If he is correct, and we do start in September, 30M a day in revenue that LYV makes x a minimum of 150 days. Thats 4.5B in missed revenue for LYV. How does a company survive that? Even if they do, what will the value of the stock be? Thats the problem with all the industries, big and small.... If they survive, how will they have the cash flow to revamp? Lots of dilution I would assume? Same with the airlines. This is not a 35.00 stock, thats for sure."
Liberty Media will soon own 100% of LN.
"I think this stock is running out of gas and am considering exiting my position. There is still a covid risk that isn't priced in, and Spotify is considering entering the live event space, which would make them a formidable competitor to LYV given their massive data advantage. Stock markets are irrational in the short term though so who knows, maybe it'll keep climbing to 100."
"Fair analysis by Motley Fool. An interesting point in the seasonality of the cash flows. LYV has usually negative EBITDA in Q1 and Q4. Now with the virus, Q1 will be even more negative than usual and Q2 EBITDA will be negative for sure and probably even Q3. It won't be long before LYV hits its bank covenant. And what I understand from it 10-K, is a lot of its cash on hand is restricted and can't be used to repay debt."
"I only see more downside for Live Nation for the following reasons:- Most of their revenues are generated during summer and the tours needs to go on sale at least 2 months on advance prior to the summer show dates. They need time to sell the tickets and their window of opportunity is closing. - Even if tours go on sale in the next month or two, they will likely see a decline in ticket sales from pricing as well as number of tickets sold. Promoters like Live Nation typically offer a fixed guaranteed amount to the artist and operate with very thin margins. They will likely incur a loss in their tours if they do tour. In this scenario, Live Nation will have to re-negotiate better deals with artists and most artists will probably postpone their tours for next year. - Live Nation was not profitable during the good times. Imagine what will happen when their revenues are cut by half. They are highly leveraged with high fixed costs to maintain employee salaries and venues. - No bailouts for this sector unlike the airlines. - This virus will change consumer behavior for the foreseeable future. Large gatherings will be a risk for people."
"With earnings coming up and based on previous correlations, this will soar to $5,000 or more! No sales with even less profits = massive shareholder returns, guaranteed. Just you watch."
What is the prediction? Is this going to pop up or go down after earnings today? Looks like there is buying going on!

Happy Monday everyone! LYV up huge!! Long and strong! Love it!! Drive in concerts are the future! LYV has some big plans for revenue streams that will complement their already booming business! Let’s go and make some money y’all!!
The price action on LYV is incredibly bearish. A lot of size on the offers within the dark pools. A lot of hesitation/time between buys hitting the offers.
"Live Nation will probably announce cancellation of tours for the month of April very soon, explains the stock price drop. They should also include May, June, who knows. Even when touring starts back up, say mid summer at the earliest, there are major scheduling and social issues. If it starts in the fall, I'm going to football games, not a concert. It's going to cost them millions. Part of their 2.5 billion in cash is from tickets already sold for shows that are going to be rescheduled at a later time, so where's the new ticket sales going to come from, on a normal scheduling basis. Down to the 20's it goes, maybe teens or lower. LV is staring at bankruptcy."
How can this stock only be 8% shorted? This doesn't make any sense.
Who is really pumping this stock? I think shorts will not rush in to cover at this time since one would want to wait for the earnings date.
Very soon Live Nation will be either bought out buy Sirius XM Radio Holdings (SIRI) or Liberty Media John Malone will roll it over into Sirius XM Radio Holdings because Live Nation won't be able to survive Coronavirus Pandemic.
Bankruptcy coming any day now for Stubhub. Purchase completed from Ebay 6 weeks ago. 4 Billion... Fastest loss I've ever seen. They are in a position WAY worse then Live Nation
Abysmal numbers. Despite the 86% headline negative 87 million ticketing revenue. I the vaccines do not come through in the most optimistic fashion this cannot be a going concern!https://www.livenationentertainment.com/2020/08/c-o-r-r-e-c-t-i-o-n-live-nation-entertainment/
DOJ is investigating Live nation for its practice on pricing through subsidiary Ticketmaster.
"Soon to come, proof of vaccine to enter live events!!! Back to the 60's or even 50's for LYV."
"Live Nation, TEG, Chugg Entertainment and Frontier Touring claim they've lost six months worth of revenue."
"Whatever fluff has been propping this stock up is about to run out of air. Live Nation's 2020 is toast, it just doesn't know it yet."
"With all these canceled events popping up almost daily, one would think LYV would tank back into the $50 to $60 range. Remember last year, no shows and LYV approached all time highs! Many shorts got killed in the process. I'm not saying history will repeat itself but, very tight hands control this stock which leads to potential manipulation by those hands."

this earnings call is going to be a train wreck. shady PR of the past few months won't cover up the reality of no revenue . should drop 30%
covered pre market waiting for green to short again razor cant short because he has a robinhood account
Just stopping in to see if the big players are still keeping this propped up. Looks like it...Makes you wonder how long they can hold this value with no revenue really.
"Kid Rock, Kiss etc have cancelled shows and it's not even September."
Hi Everyone!Did you all miss me? Sorry I was super busy last month volunteering for Biden's campaign. Huge Huge day today! Those that listened to me can enjoy steak and lobster dinner tonight! Woohoo!Go back to my message history 5 months ago and those who were resilient have been rewarded. 1000 shares at $52 and 1000 shares at $45. Plus work bonuses.. Going to be a very very merry Christmas! Kaboom!
Here's Razor's news: Zacks Investment Research Lowers Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) to Strong Sell
"“we have operated with the goal of staying true to our company’s core philosophy of ‘taking care of our own.’ This is why we continued to keep our team at full pay through March and April, even as the tens of thousands of events we support and sell ground to a halt.”And that’s why they are not giving refunds to THEIR customers, because there PHILOSOPHY is to take care of THEIR OWN!"
Just be patient for the big news to come. Which will cause a big pop. Market is already turning around from today’s low just like Friday how we got that big bounce!

Bottom line as always: profit and fundamentals!!! No stock can run away from it. How does LYV stack up?
The only way this is going down is if I buy into it...so today I started a position. You're welcome everyone.
Morgan Stanley cut their estimates from $80 a share to $40 a share. Try $20
"You do understand there is no saving this company if restrictions are placed on crowd size for sports and entertainment events? Also, what entertainer do you know who will be scheduling concerts during the pandemic and who would come if they did?"
Lyv just cancelled the share purchase of Ocesa from Televisa. Struggling with cash.
"“The company estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $449.6 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund the previously announced acquisition of 51% of the capital stock of OCESA Entretenimiento, S.A. de C.V. (the ""OCESA Acquisition""). “"
