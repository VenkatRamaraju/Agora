"I think there's some shady activity going on with LYV, like money laundering. They are sitting on huge piles of cash, over $2 Billion, they refuse to refund their customers, change the language and terms of what can be refunded and keep moving the goal posts on when and how people can even apply to start the process of a refund. The NY State AG is now starting to investigate them. According to Live Nation:“Live Nation’s plan is to continue offering an opportunity for refunds on all of its rescheduled shows as new dates are set. We anticipate those windows will begin to open up on an event by event basis in the next few weeks.”Shifty legal speak, not wanting to release customers money back to them."
"Let me start by saying I do not own this stock. However I do work in the entertainment industry. I can tell you that large gatherings and live events are far from coming back anytime soon. Concerts and artists are already quietly rescheduling touring events to august of 2021. That being said the conversations have now moved to if the fall of 2021 is even realistic. Personally speaking the protocol for hosting small live event like recorded award shows is very very expensive. We have to constantly take daily covid test. While at the venue PPE gear is a constant standard and if violated you will be removed from the venue. We are all waiting for an approved vaccine, but are slowly realizing that this still will not be the answer. The additional cost, distribution, compliance is all getting more and more distant. I say all of this with a heavy heart. For over 22 years this was my work, my love , my passion. I have seen enough. I am now personally looking for a new career path , and live events just doesn’t work. This trend is real and not going away. Putting all your eggs in the vaccine basket is not the answer. Just my personal experience. But life goes on while the business model changes!"
"Based on the performance of this stock, I'm thinking of initiating a new ETF called CARE (Cruise lines, Airlines, Resorts and Entertainment). It is sure to be a big winner!"
soon as this hits 100 im expecting a big sell off
"I only see more downside for Live Nation for the following reasons:- Most of their revenues are generated during summer and the tours needs to go on sale at least 2 months on advance prior to the summer show dates. They need time to sell the tickets and their window of opportunity is closing. - Even if tours go on sale in the next month or two, they will likely see a decline in ticket sales from pricing as well as number of tickets sold. Promoters like Live Nation typically offer a fixed guaranteed amount to the artist and operate with very thin margins. They will likely incur a loss in their tours if they do tour. In this scenario, Live Nation will have to re-negotiate better deals with artists and most artists will probably postpone their tours for next year. - Live Nation was not profitable during the good times. Imagine what will happen when their revenues are cut by half. They are highly leveraged with high fixed costs to maintain employee salaries and venues. - No bailouts for this sector unlike the airlines. - This virus will change consumer behavior for the foreseeable future. Large gatherings will be a risk for people."
I’m at a loss of words. This is borderline money laundering at this point. Zero revenue with a business that wasn’t doing great to begin with during its highest sales months. It increases today during a market selloff. Casinos went down yet this stock went up. Y’all are being bamboozled into buying this.
"Like I said with $LYV, the 2nd most overvalued stock in the market, if you want to get FINRA and the SEC’s attention on $CVNA, contact their employees on LinkedIn addition to filing a complaint. Hindenburg, etc. would probably be interested, too."
This is holding up really well. I expect this to pop after consolidating here. $100 will happen! $LYV
"Blows my mind that this stock is trading so high lol. Some kinda voodoo going on. Concerts been cancelled again, holding onto tons of customer money without confirmed rescheduled dates. If when they dont happen they'll owe millions in refund. Think this is why the books are looking so healthy right now."
"Kid Rock, Kiss etc have cancelled shows and it's not even September."
"Trying over 92 again. Will it, can it, hold"
"Two weeks ago Emanuel Ariel Z, a Board of Director, sold 71,394 shares (practically all of his shares). My intuition says he knew the pandemic would shut down Live Nation."
"Humpty Dumpty setting up for a big fall! No way lyv produces good numbers in his environment and at some point, numbers will matter."
Josh Brown nailed it.
Cancelled
Buying more 5/17 puts. Betting the Motley news is out to insiders. That's why 2M shares traded into close and a 60k block sold last night! Down she goes
Wonderful how the stock of a company with absolutely no revenues can trade near its all time high---yeah that price it was trading at when concerts and revenue was booming.----which makes this one of the most baffling of the re-opening stocks....
Wow it’s good to be back with my long friends. Holy smokes all the shorties from a few months ago are gone!! Whooaaaa
"Is LYV a buy?Even before the pandemic, Live Nation was struggling with a sizable debt burden as its 2019 interest expense of $157.5 million made up nearly half of its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating profit at $324.8 million. With its debt already up by more than 50% this year, interest expense will also surge, cutting into its already thin net margin. That means that even the effects of pent-up demand on its recovery will be muted as the company will need to grow operating income significantly just to get back to where it was on the bottom line before the pandemic.Add it all up, and Live Nation is a company with a solid business model, but with a lot of a debt, thin profits, and operations in a mature industry that has been kneecapped by the coronavirus pandemic. Given those circumstances, why this stock is trading near all-time highs is a mystery, especially because when it was worth the same value at the start of 2020, expectations of a record year were baked into that price.Analysts are still expecting substantial losses for 2021 and for revenue to be down about a third from 2019 results, showing that the road to recovery will be a long one. At this point, Live Nation still faces strong headwinds for at least another quarter or two and will likely have to borrow more money. The stock looks overvalued for now, trading at pre-pandemic levels. Investors are better off looking elsewhere for recovery stocks.There is no bull-case for this stock for the foreseeable future. Absurdly overvalued."
"If you look at a one year chart, you see rolling hills. It appears that we are at the top of another rolling hill. Will this time be different because we are strengthening into a more possible opening of events? Thoughts?"
"Here the reason why customers can’t get a refund for a postponed show as per Ticketmaster:“I think there’s a lot of misperception about Ticketmaster,” Joe Berchtold, president of Live Nation, the company that owns Ticketmaster, said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Squawk Alley.” “Ticketmaster doesn’t sell these tickets and sit on a mountain of cash. Ticketmaster sells tickets and gives the cash over to the venues where the events are held.”What I don't understand is that I've also read articles mentioning that tickets sellers aren't getting paid either. So where is the money???"
who is buying it?
"The highest that LYV saw before the pandemic hit was $75/share, so why should they trade at $85 now when they had zero revenue in 2020, hardly any revenue in 2021 with an unknown future revenue path???"
Once the dam breaks on this one the outflow will be massive. It rose on the now largely abandoned Easter date. In actuality the ban on large events is going to be in place for the foreseeable future. No one is doubting that fact. Meanwhile they will bleed $ and owe debt repayments. Someone please make the bull case for this because so just don't see it. Thx
"On Aug. 3, Live Nation Entertainment reported its financial results for the second quarter of 2021. The company reported a positive adjusted operating income, or AOI, of about $10 million for the quarter, after five straight quarters of negative AOI. Live Nation’s LTM AOI as of June 30, 2021, was approximately negative $706 million. Read the full covenants analysis here: https://reorg.com/live-nation-tear-sheet/"
Ok I’ll be completely honest. Don’t own this stock but I do work in the entertainment industry. I personally know many people that “Did “ work for Live Nation for over 29 and 30 plus years. Live Nation is quietly “terminated” multiple top Board members and local Promoters very recently. I know this because I have personally talked to these former employees. These top tier employees have been terminated no furloughed but fired! One employee/ friend has worked for LN as the top Michigan promoter for over 30 years. He released internal information about a memo that was leaked how Live Entertainment will not be close to normal until 2022 at best. In my opinion this is one of the most manipulative companies I’ve ever had to work with. I would not own this stock or recommend it to anyone long or short! This company in my opinion can’t even come close to being transparent to save their stock holding life’s! Stock holder’s beware! Just my honest opinion.
Are drive-in shows coming soon?
Share price completely out of touch with reality. Nothing new about that though.
Anybody read about the tame impala concert at the gorge Washington last night on Twitter? What a disaster. Totally missed managed by Live Nation. Folks sat in cars for hours 5 miles out with no ability to attend show. Zero messaging from Live Nation. This venue mgmt is a joke.
"From BZ NewswireLive Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) - BuyPrior to the COVID-19 shutdown, live entertainment ticketing company Live Nation was firing on all cylinders. There’s no reason why the company can’t eventually return to that level, but investors may need to be patient.It may be June or later before large events and shows are back on the calendar, and it may take many more months for customers to be financially able and willing to gather in large numbers without fear of infection.

""and a Buy rating? What is wrong with the analysts these days? Do they not understand how the market works?"
How can this stock only be 8% shorted? This doesn't make any sense.
Looks like the OCESA acquisition is back in play. The recent $450M stock offering is to pay for it. I think that is what is driving this run.
"“The company estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $449.6 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund the previously announced acquisition of 51% of the capital stock of OCESA Entretenimiento, S.A. de C.V. (the ""OCESA Acquisition""). “"
$529 mill cash spent in 3 months and everything is just “fine”
"I think this stock is running out of gas and am considering exiting my position. There is still a covid risk that isn't priced in, and Spotify is considering entering the live event space, which would make them a formidable competitor to LYV given their massive data advantage. Stock markets are irrational in the short term though so who knows, maybe it'll keep climbing to 100."
"With all these canceled events popping up almost daily, one would think LYV would tank back into the $50 to $60 range. Remember last year, no shows and LYV approached all time highs! Many shorts got killed in the process. I'm not saying history will repeat itself but, very tight hands control this stock which leads to potential manipulation by those hands."
"Why buy long at these levels? I have a short position that I’m continuing to cost-average up thanks to that Saudi pump and retails thinking this is the recovery. If you bought here and closed your eyes, would you be green in 5 years...? Probably. But why do that? Why not make money on the way down and on the way up. I plan to convert some of my short position to a long position in the low $30s or maybe even $20s.Live Nation makes their real dough on big attendance concerts and sporting events WITH FANS. Those will be some of the last things to “return to normal” and even small venue shows will be affected. There are two things traders simply aren’t pricing in right now:1) Consumer reticence to attend ANY show of any capacity over say 50 people until there’s a reliable vaccine (Q1 2021 at the earliest) 2) Recession driven by job loss that will not be temporary. Trust me. Companies will use this as an excuse to trim fat. You know how many companies have realized through this that they had 10 people doing the jobs of 7. Plus they don’t have the cash reserves to rehire back to prior capacity anyway. This was not a 14-day pause. The chance to stave off a recession is long gone. And what happens in a recession: Less discretionary consumer spending. Where does that hit the hardest? Entertainment & Leisure sector.Coalesce these two factors and this stock is expensive at this price. I don’t see how this thing doesn’t bleed for end of Q1 (which we’ll see reflected in the report) and all of Q2, Q3, and Q4. Q1 2021 is the soonest for real recovery for this stock.Don’t buy a ticket to $LYV’s downturn when you can get both the refund and the credit instead if you’re simply rational and disciplined."

This is the last stock I ever buy because some “smart” guy on CNBC says it’s a great investment. I swear.
$92! here it is!
