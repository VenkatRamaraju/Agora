Too bad a down day market-wise had to come after these spectacular results. AVAV would've soared. Not complaining. The rest of the market will find this beauty later on today. 60 Minutes?
Pre-market trading wins again ...surprise surprise.Still up on market down day but that pre-market stuff angers me.
"AVAV is grossly undervalued, that's a fact. And now that geopolitical tensions are escalating involving Iran, it's very reasonable to expect that a few select defense names will benefit. AVAV is a now in a partnership with KTOS whose stock has done very well, and with AVAV the leader in unmanned aircraft and drones, now may be AeroVironment's time to shine. AVAV got an upgrade and price increase from an analyst the other day, to $86. I'm in for the significant upside, no matter how long it takes."
"You people are oblivious to the real answer. Do you not watch the action of the chart of this stock. The last minute of the day the shorts activate a large sell, ( 3:59), and kills the stock. The Company tries to stop it but is not consistent. When the Company does stop it, the sellers knock it down the first thing the next morning. Some big short seller is killing this stock."
107 good entry point patient
Good luck shorting AVAV close to 70% if not more owned by institutions Absolutely perfect management team one of the best investments I have done in early 2018 at $ 26.76 per share and I have plenty just wish I would have more between commercial licencing and Military contract I will just pray and you should too till then Gennady
Premarket low was $67.79 this morning...
AeroVironment selected by Cathie Wood for inclusion into $ARKX. Go AVAV flying helicopters on Mars!
"Okay, so there was a clear beat and we are down 8%? If I could only sue "
From$121 to $55.I never saw this coming.
"Re-energized the march to $200! before the EOY 2019, we'll be @200+"
I bought tsla at 30 but did not hold long enough to see 300+ days. I also bought avav at 27. This time I have enough patience to wait
Drop on beat earnings? Joking right
I think EV is powering this Stock . Electric charges at every dealershipand Charges for the home with every electric car. BMW just added to the listof vendors.
tomorrow we break 72. May our troops be safe
Drones for war and defense are great as a short term revenue source. The long tail opportunity is with the HAPS mobile business...the number of drones could far outstrip whatever is put in place for a limited war time use case. IOT and 5G could further drive the demand.
Since AVAV fell 25% already are we recession proof?
Looking forward to next ER. Hopefully good earnings and revenue - and lots of new projects to discuss. They currently have 70+ open job positions in Similar and Boston.
"Onward and upward for AVAV.I will hold until $100+ or buyout, whichever occurs first."
"Virtual Press Briefing.... Any serious shareholder or potential investor in AVAV, needs to view the 18 min. video from yesterday 10-13. This is the future of war preparedness and the warfighter!

"Tim Conver, Chairman of the Board, sold about 10 million dollars worth of stock in the last 3 months at around 70ish a share. Could be one reason the stock keeps sinking"
Google: Drone Software Market SWOT Analysis including key playersLooks like we are quite well positioned with AVAV
"I'll be buying dips here for a while, having such visibility with that big backlog is a giant confidence booster. We see 70+ in time....."
Buy n hold.
"In at $81.50, 3,000 shares. A bit late to the party, but not complaining!"
RSI of 32 and below the Bollinger band. It will cross $101 in the next few days.
"If you listened past conference calls, would noticed this time Mr. Wahid ‘s confident and opening voice and attitude about guidance especially facing Analysts’ challenging questions!Definitely bottom up!"
anyone? there is a quarter results guys
I think I can get this at a lower price but this company has an impressive balance sheet.
"AeroVironment is now teaming up with Nvidia, IBM, Microsoft to cope with wildfires. And teaming up with Alphabet’s Loon, Nokia and Ericsson.I never know such proficient company ever."
is earnings gonna beat or bust?

NO ONE is selling good company ran up before earning OUTLOOK I say is GREAT and backlog even better
"Some stocks you buy to hold, this is one of them!"
"if the HAWK30 gets any media this stock will run to $100 because it is disruptive leading edge technology that can handle voice/LTE/5G for a 200km radius. Would allow cell/data access over water and remote areas that would otherwise not have coverage, and can also be used to replace cell/data towers. Softbank will be the first to use this technology in Hawaii and Japan."
Bought more today $43.50. Disclosure! Happy Trading.
this company has a great future
Wish I had saved some dry powder for this day.
Not sure why exactly but AVAV is completely breaking down. I've been waiting for a good time to acquire and it looks like that opportunity has finally arrived.
"AVAV - ""It's like a smart mortar system, yet instead of launching up and then down on a sharp ballistic arc, it lofts into the air, helps the operator search for targets, and attacks targets when found."" https://www.sofx.com/2020/05/12/aerovironment-to-build-backpackable-attack-uav-to-enable-ground-troops-to-search-out-and-destroy-targets-military-aerospace-electronics/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=aerovironment-to-build-backpackable-attack-uav-to-enable-ground-troops-to-search-out-and-destroy-targets-military-aerospace-electronics"
"Institutions cashing out ,volume not that heavy to be down 15%"

Finally just bought 300 shares @ 84. Good luck

"Get in now ,going much higher!"
buy at 50
Game is being played to drop he share price after a stellar day. Waiting for earnings right now. The fact they have arranged a conference tomorrow morning for investors and WS bodes well for a good guidance.
"Game playing! Up over $2 above close, but CNBC indicates under $60. Some one is playing around this small co. CC is being conducted and so far lots of excitement. Let them play game. The conference tomorrow should be superb. Glad I doubled my shares yesterday."
AVAV with their suborbital drones are sure to be included in the new ARKX. They are also already in the autonomous & robotics ETFhttps://youtu.be/_hj77MFfwSs
It's gonna be alright. Strong company with good outlook regardless what the economy does next year. I'm buying on the dip...and will accumulate if it drops more.
Trump committed to 750 billion dollar defense budget.
EPS and rev look good. not sure why we see 2% down AH.. doesnt matter we will be fine.
"I can't figure out why AVAV has been faded (hammered) off the recent highs following their great ER report. They raised guidance, the stock ran to $95, and 5 or 6 days later it's below where it was trading before the ER report. Thoughts?"
I think its as simple as Blackrock rebalancing ETFs. They own 16% of the outstanding shares. This has nothing to do with fundamentals.
Is someone buying up a big position?
no volume trading down. load the boat. I am
Bummer. Rookie brokers and newbees who probably didn't even read the ER dumped big time. One time 13cent tax related expense was part of the reason for the 4cent loss. That equates to an 8cent non-gaap profit The rest of the ER is pretty solid.
Wait....no movement after earning beat?
Will this be a $200 stock? mi thinks so ...
"Short Squeeze rule now in affect, another few weeks of this and she's blowing her top off."
Does AVAV have a drone that UPS can use/rent/buy for their drone airline delivery service?
No way that Mr. Nawabi and his management team will sell the company. Call the investor relation now! Trust me!
Great great great report :)
"I just went long AVAV again, this time more than I care to admit. I'm betting the stock recovers by the end of the day, and heads higher in the coming days/weeks. The report was great, the response was strange, however the market will reprice AVAV in the near term based on the fundamentals."
Have you guys heard anything about KWEMF on this board? It looks like they are using AVAV drones and have some potentially massive growth coming with DOD and NATO allies.
Why up so much today? Normal?
"AVAV has only 24m shares outstanding 80% of which are held by institutions. Evidently both institutional and individuals are holding, making the available number of shares available for purchase very few. Those that want to buy must pay dearly under these circumstances In ligh of the last earnings report, this scenario for AVAV will remain in place for the long term."
Go to check SA site. It is up over $3 after market trading right now!
Having followed this company for many years now. I would say their promise of bringing innovation to the Defense business with speed and quality is now paying dividends in spades. Nice to finally be recognized for the top tear tech company they are.
Have over 1000 shares since first offering would hope you could have distribution at some point. Thank you. Chuck
Investors are funny. Earnings were solid and management reiterated annual revenue targets. Think UPOD.
"again avav disappoints, but I am still very much bullish when it comes to this co future. it seems to be full of opportunity and future growth."
"Another example short hedge fund bites the dust thinking they can manipulate price by such sensational news bashing the co. This reminds me of the guru of short fund Citron of Andrew Left who shorted NVDA, SHOP, SQ and VRX. Now every one of these has hit new high and still close to that prices now. Precise why I use these short hedges as contrarian indicators and profitable trading vehicles. These shorts are losing huge money along with their followers."
Earnings beat and raised guidance. Is anyone else confused here or is it just me?
OIL going up more need for EV . Motely projects a possible Double .I'll take $70

Avav makes the drones and sells it to katos which has a contract with the government ...Katos has satellite and avav drones ...bottom line avav drones used by our defense government ... gl
Long!
"Small float, highly shorted. Has a chance to run..."
"""A police helicopter costs from $500,000 to $3 million to acquire, and $200-$400 an hour to fly. Manned aircraft are large, complex machines requiring expert ground crews, multiple shifts of pilots and co-pilots, and (unlike drones which can often be hand-launched) runways or helipads."" Just need a wee bit faster AVAV drone to replace these..."
"I had this stock for a few years, got in in the twenties and made a few bucks when I left at 105.55 when this last quarterly came out. I'm still not understanding how AVAV has failed to be profitable at a time when drones appear to be the best weapon we have in our arsenal. Why has this company not flourished? Was it leadership in selling the product, bias in government contracts, maybe not a great product? Drones should be on the government best buy list but AVAV doesn't cut it. Why?"
I heard in the past they were in the recharging station biz...but nothing of that aspect anymore. what happened!!??
I don't own AVAV right now but I might pick some up if it retraces. I I work in the aerospace business for about 15 years as an engineer. And I have to believe that we have seen the last pilot flown jet. Pilots pass out around 9 g's. You could probly get a design of a jet efficiently probably 15 to 20 g's is my guess. I'm sure there may be cases in the future where you need a pilot for something but I guarantee 95% of jets will not need pilots. Commercial airliners only use pilots now to take off and land. The rest is all auto pilot.
it's going to rebound quick
This stock stays flat for long periods of time looking at the 1yr chart
Up 200% in at 32$....buy more?
"Congratulations my fellow longs. I've been in Aerovironment for about 6 years, looking forward to Ms Woods company as we head toward s the next century marker of 200+."
They did beat earring and revenue. Their expense to buy Pluse and openNewEngland innovation center will lower their next year eps but they guide higher revenues for 2020!
to the moon Alice:)
half of what it used to be
"$AVAV I took new positions in $AVAV today. I have been researching to invest in a market leading, US-based Drones platform & analytics company with mature and stable cash flows, and $AVAV rose to the top of my list. AVAV offers a great pipeline of stable and ongoing defense contracts along with new growing revenue streams from commercial sector (their partnership with Soft Bank and Google to offer internet in remote areas, agricultural and climate resilience mapping drone applications). The stock is at a low price thanks to the historical sell-off. This stock has no exposure to COVID-19 or consumer spending. I recommend it a STRONG BUY, and it should be at $65-+ already!PS: I am an activist investor / analyst of sort... I take contrarian positions in misunderstood companies whose stock prices are depressed due to short sellers activity or typical WS analysts putting wrong Price Targets / Ratings. Look forward to working with you all my investor friends here on this board...!!"
"This looks very over valued, why has it moved up so much?Target was like $45?"
"AVAV is so undervalued. Their (new) headquarters are next door to the Pentagon, and we need to keep a close watch on a country we've just abandoned physically and is being run by the Taliban. This is a no-brainer."
"Feels like this is one large investor pulling the plug - and not necessarily because of earnings. It's year-end, might be tax loss selling or rebalancing. The fundamentals are solid and the call was positive."
This is one to buy on dips. It’s overpriced like a lot of growth stocks but it has zero debt. Long term winner for sure
I am perplexed why us it sliding down?
70+ just around the corner ;)
Bought some shares at 49.30 today. Maybe it will drop a little more next week with the rest of the market and present a another buying opportunity. GLTA!!
"Zipline is a drone delivery company\system. Good if AVAV can get in this mix. Or, fry bigger fish. Either is good. https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/connecticut-drones-coronavirus-symptom-monitoring?fbclid=IwAR3npwaCbTYTRmvbHRhBu4XOM6Vq4y-pMugut2kuR-omY3cPm1-AGrZ8yCw"
Would like to see this over $100 again
Stock on steroids
I've also seen this happen a lot after decent earnings reports...pps almost always comes back within weeks.
"Some funny reporting with different news agencies reporting different things, but eps was $0.26 per diluted share not $0.24 as reported in some of the articles. Whether that is a miss or a beat depends on which analysts you polled, but was roughly in-line. Revenue was a beat, all are agreed. The 4th quarter fiscal 2018 was an impossible comparison - revenue and earnings have now shifted to an even distribution over the year, as they noted, and the 2018 number included the large litigation settlement benefit. But overall growth for 2019 was massive, and they are predicting double digit revenue growth for fiscal 2020. $200 million in government appropriated funds not counted yet in the backlog. New acquisition, new projects, continued growth in government spending on drones, it wasn’t the blockbuster earnings report many of us hoped for, but the future is still bright."
TD Ameritrade had 1.3 million shares of AVAV traded today. Monday will be interesting to see where we go from here. GLTA!
"Drones are required for almost all countrys and US army in particular , this stock was beaten down for no reason."
It's mostly small orders. The big guys that got in at the end of the day are staying. https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/avav/after-hours?page=2 Only 22K traded in the after market
https://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/unmanned/unmanned-aerial/aerovironment-grows-military-commercial-drone-applications/
down in pre-market I wonder why?
"You have to ask yourself, who started selling their shares at such a low price right after an earnings beat? Certainly not retail investors. As the year is ending, the greedy institutional holders who bought this stock at <$30 are cashing in to make their year-end numbers. Maybe we can ask them for a copy of the memo they put out last nite regarding SELL, SELL and moving to another sector."
EPS by Analysts Raised from .04 to .05 . Earnings report 3/6
I need a personal air space radar to monitor air traffic over my property. Does anyone know of an affordable system? I think it was an AVAV drone that flew over yesterday.

Diamond in the rough AVAV
Some good green action here today. 70 calls are very active
Has the Company gone to sleep? The shorts have moved from knocking down the stock at the last minutes of the day to morning open. Someone has to be appointed to watch the stock/ shorts or this stock will never grow as it should. The stock price does not and will not reflect the performance of the Company unless the shorts are contained. A small percentage of shorts are whip-sawing the stock to the point that this stock is untouchable.
wow. wish I could have more shares

AeroVironment reached a 52 Week high at 87.94
"So, what's the news?"
So close to punching through that $80 resistance!
how are you guys feeling about the earnings this time around?
no reason for this to be down.
real bottom was 60. up up up from here
"When I heard about the wildland fires in California, it really struck me personally,” said Jacci Cenci-McGrody, senior technical marketing engineer for Nvidia. “I thought to myself, ‘How can I use Nvidia’s technologies to help the firefighters?’The answer: AI-enabled drones and a collaborative AI pipeline."
No reasonable explanation for stock price drop. Inexplicable.
Get on the train b4 it takes off tomorrow. I’m seeing 79+
Crazy that KTOS has the market cap to buy AVAV. AVAV is very undervalued.
I'm new to this. always manipulated?
"So, aside from the numbers, what is AVAV missing here? Shouldn't this technology be on fire and in great demand, both in the US and all over the world? Is their military prowess not up to we small investors think? Is their management not creative enough to create markets? Is their technology now a commodity?"
Continue to hold AVAV despite the precipitous decline.
Nov 21 - Dubai Air Show - Drones are growing into a $100 billion industry22 Hours AgoUnmanned flying vehicles are growing in popularity all over the world.

I believe AVAV will retrace back around the $49 base. I have sold half of my investment for a double making my remaining shares free. I will hold them long term.
Really close to 52 week high.

Small float any good news will send it soaring. I do know us gov needs at least one drone
"wow, was that the dip from 109 to 106? People are holding this for the long term it seems...analysts will not upgrade AVAV for awhile, so this is a steep price to pay and hold until probably the next earnings date when it might get another upgrade. I'll watch it for awhile though.."
"Anyone ever heard why AVAV doesn't have interest in the ""delivery drone"" market for UPS, Amazon, etc..?"
I expect short covering will start soon and will be more next week. Yahoo shows 2.85M shares short....Short Squeeze is very likely !Today is the final day of the quarter/month. Let's close at $57's...Still plenty of time.
Today is what U call a Big Dump!
"Could not find much social activities for this stock , has been thinking whether to just sell and cut the loss. Though ARK seems to have bought 7900 shares of AVAV today."
Earnings on 11/29 lets see where this goes
Breaking out will happen
Today looks like the day to breakout to record high... thoughts?
why is this down? it had a good ER?
Nice haircut ! This is what happens when you roam the countryside with a PE ratio of 90.
Smart money and MM's have been collecting cheap shares from weak hands today . They will sell above $65 easy soon...
Baird upgraded AeroVironment from Neutral to Outperform and raised the price target from $65 to $81.

"Concerning the recent price action, with a P/S of 3.94 and a Forward PE of over 50, the current price is not a bargain. The return on equity is not great, either. But us longs are looking 5 to 10 years forward, and I see a company with a head-start in a disruptive business . The one-year chart does not look bad so I’m not worried. Consider the weakness a reasonable entry point."
"I lost a ton of money following a Zack's ""Strong Buy"". No more, they are a joke!"
Nice
AVAV...TO THE MOON!
"Frustrating that I missed this move. Lost a lot of money on the way down, temporarily got out on a relative move up a couple weeks ago, should have got back in yesterday, wouldn’t have minded missing 2 or 3 percent, but jeeze, 10% in one day? Not sure I want to chase that."
"Zacks did an analyst change 3 times in 3 days which should be illegal but what do I know? 2/20 from buy to hold, 2/21 hold to buy 2/22, buy to hold. Or maybe we need to sign up with these unscrupulous swing trade analysts."
Kratos buyout could be a smart move from here looking long term.
"AVAV is one of two major players in the military drone market. They're the lesser known brand, but that means they're trying harder. And their visibility is under the radar. Earnings are EXPECTED to be lower because they spent a ton on getting that helicopter to Mars. But that was a success, and is a notch in their belt. Remember - if earnings EXCEED expectations, that is a HUGE benefit to the share price. As of right now, earnings estimates are already built in to the share price. I'm betting that ACTUAL earnings are HIGHER than expected.... by a LOT. Get in while the price is under $130/share."
Are you guys listening in?
"Every person under the age of 50 should hold at least a small position of AVAV in their portfolio. It’s a play on increased military spending, reduction of troops put in harms way, industrialization of farming and EV charging for companies other than Tesla which will be the auto companies who will have the largest sales volumes."
bottom?
this should rally in light of recent developments.
"Technically, it breaks 250 sma resistance at $64 range and stands above another higher resistance lvl at $68-69 range, bullish signal, seems a concrete base was done, target $80"
"From Stocktwits: ""AeroVironment director just picked up 3,000 shares "" It will go higher...."
$200+No debt?Lots of cash?Growing sales and margins?

Going to 200 soon
Big contracts? Buyout? Privet sector?Where will this be in 5 years? It won’t be at this sp and it won’t go under..... time to buy

Today would seem like an excellent time for the US to buy about 50 AVAV drones.
DRUS is where the action is.
"Beat top and bottom but looks like a guide inline. Could be enough though, it’s been so beaten down. Let’s hope it rallies!"
Whew!! What happened today?
"Even the Barron’s is willing to play this fake news game to support the hedge shorts. This news on carrying on board with explosives was totally rebuffed by the co and by an analyst’s report. Is it small wonder, investors no longer trust these supposedly leading financial journals which clearly have their own agenda connected to the short hedges."

There's movement alright 
"Frustrating, but have to be patient and wait for the stock to find some firm footing. It will. The business is strong, beating and raising the last 2 quarters, predicting revenue growth in a business that has great tailwinds with increased US military spending on drones planned."
AVAV to the moon after close 
This is not even thinking of going up anytime soon
"Just a blip. Rebuilding to be stronger, faster, more efficient and effective."
AVAV buys small VTOL maker for 25 million cash. AVAV has no debt. Seems like a good move to me. I am in the red with this stock but holding long term. Will buy more to lower my basis if the upcoming earnings report is positive. I don't know why the short interest is so high in avav but at some point I would think they have to cover.
is there a drone stock that pays a dividend?
who is excited ? I am !

Any news here? Why down so much lately? Is there not confidence in the changes at the top? The prospects seem so bright for this leader in military drones and in its space helicopter developments.
so how do feel about earnings I liked it
"Excellent buying opportunity here, with price around $42."
"Absolutely stellar report. In addition, the stock has been so beat up, that $70-$75 in the near term is reasonable. Technically, the monthly chart shows a strong buy."
wow. powerful results
"what a slide, all the gains are wiped in 3 days. very sad :( I think it's a buying opportunity "
"When AVAV announced its big earnings beat 9/6/2018 of 0.85 eps, it guided eps for the full year of 1.1-1.4. The stock went as high as $121. In December it beat and raised full year eps guidance 1.3-1.5. The stock dropped to as low as $65. Now they beat and raise again to 1.6-1.8, with a negative reaction. If the stock was going to fall, it should have done so based on the guidance in September. (It did, but not until the whole market corrected.). Since then, there have been only positive surprises. The business, and therefore the stock, is worth more after the earnings beat and raise than before. It is oversold and should and will go up.For a small company like this that may finish orders at various times in the year, you can’t just look at one giant quarter (fiscal 2019 Q1, which included 0.26 eps of a litigation settlement) and now say the company is shrinking because subsequent quarters haven’t kept up. Except for a couple of outlier quarters there has been steady, sequential earnings and revenue growth. They are guiding further revenue growth. This is a premier company, a market leader in an industry that is growing, with the US expected to increase spending on drones by 15%/yr the next 5 years. As far as I’m concerned, this is a great price for a great company."
"Doesnt seem very liquid, low $ trading on a large market cap. Is that a concern? Good, bad, not applicable?"
I've been in long and just took profits at 84.5$. Will buy back when it gets back to 80$
Solid report!
AeroVironment relocating next to the Pentagon. I can handle that.
Back to 100 quickly
"Well, well, well. Stock could run but the shorts keep knocking it back down. If the Company does not appoint someone to watch the shorts, there is no hope for the price. Shorts are trying to take command again. One day of glory does not make a winner."
US Air Force awarded AVAV 13 million dollar contract to support Caribbean and Latin American countries with Ravens.
After hours single share selling and block buying manipulation. Someone is expecting a pop tomorrow.
"Also it looks like chairman has been selling 7000 shares each day from middle april to right before earning announcement day of 6/29. Even though it is prescheduled sales, could hard to believe he did not act like this based on inside info... is his sales legal?"
Great earnings and great positive guide forward for upcoming year!
Aerovironment - Locally Made Craft Headed for Mars Gets Name http://www.sfvbj.com/news/2020/apr/29/locally-made-craft-headed-mars-gets-name/
Pat each other on the back
It seems we can either take the loss or hold til earnings in a few weeks to see if the analysts are proven wrong.
"Etrade increased margin rate from 25% to 55%. Therefore, some traders on margin got margin calls starting yesterday morning. They are forced to sell and drove down the price yesterday. I am holding on cash so Not affected and will double soon. Hold your shares it will go much higher. It will beat the next EPS and Revenue numbers nicely..."
"So how do you trade from a high intraday of $95 after a great ER report, all the way to $71 in only 7 trading days? They raised guidance! This can't just be about Boeing and their problems, besides AVAV sells drones. No downgrades, no news, just solid revenue and earnings with raised guidance. The chart is a mess for whatever reason."
Watch this baby run!!
ARK buying ?
"Sweet move up today. Earnings will be great, I hope."
yes glad I bought this stock on a whim.
Had been wanting to get back in for a while after selling too early last spring. Finally took advantage of the nonsensical dip on great earnings to take a sizable long position.
Nice pullback to $125 to add
"ok this should move up nicely tomorrow after earnings, but then again you never know... sometimes the market likes doing the opposite of what makes sense."
"So quiet here, any investors? Just took a new position at these lows."
Wasnt the helicopter on Mars right now made by AVAV?
"Looking good,takeover coming sooner than later!"
Solid bump in gross margin (45% from 40).
Tough day. Be nice to see this pull a turn around tomorrow like some of the other tech stocks earlier in earnings season.
"AVAV is massively oversold in all the tech indicators, and is sitting on major support. Looking to get in tomorrow."
Why the big sell off?
went up to almost $100 and then to 90 in a few mins...
Market makers just giving big money a chance to get in before next run up
This is a gem bought 100 shares
had this on my radar for 6 months. Finally found the right time and right place. Very excited for this company's future and if it breaks down further I'm prepared to double up. :)
Great entry point under 100 will make a nice 10 pts on this one
10 pts drop this week will be good....Keep my fingers crossed.
"Buy AVAV, MU, SQ,and HES here"
Down 13%? Wow.
A CFO leaving a company like this is a non event. If that's the cause of the stock being off 5% then it looks like a buying opportunity.
"Why is AVAV up with such low Revenue guidance? Please enlighten me. Next full year revenue is between $290M to $310M MUCH LESS than $336.99M estimates. The recent examples such as ORCL and AOBC, they tanked with lower guidance vs estimates. This morning when it was down to $56's which is the right direction. Well, please let me know what I am missing here."
Ticker AVAV is what a real drone stock looks like! I’m stuck in ticker: DRUS 
Why down? what happend?
I cannot imagine a major powerhouse has not yet purchase this company
"With the new products being announced and the aerospace and defense meetings this week in DC, the stock can react to the upside."
"this is looking very solid, backlog is rocking! hope to see a runup in days to follow."
