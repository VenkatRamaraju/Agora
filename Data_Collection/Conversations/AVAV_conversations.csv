"PR release only notes coronavirus once (potential risks) - and management isn't making any adjustments to it's guidance the remainder of the year. Say what you want about the business, most companies have taken the opportunity to revise number downward."
10 pts drop this week will be good....Keep my fingers crossed.
AVAV...TO THE MOON!
"I lost a ton of money following a Zack's ""Strong Buy"". No more, they are a joke!"
Hope this blasts through 80
"https://mobile.twitter.com/aerovironment/status/1260922225219289088Where the traders are watching?146M!The first time procurement of AeroVironment popular system. It means this year’s big business, right?How dares people are selling..It’s 146M! Not 1.46M!"
"what a slide, all the gains are wiped in 3 days. very sad :( I think it's a buying opportunity "
Watch this baby run!!
I expect short covering will start soon and will be more next week. Yahoo shows 2.85M shares short....Short Squeeze is very likely !Today is the final day of the quarter/month. Let's close at $57's...Still plenty of time.
"Short Squeeze rule now in affect, another few weeks of this and she's blowing her top off."
how are you guys feeling about the earnings this time around?

Tough day. Be nice to see this pull a turn around tomorrow like some of the other tech stocks earlier in earnings season.
"AVAV is massively oversold in all the tech indicators, and is sitting on major support. Looking to get in tomorrow."
"Onward and upward for AVAV.I will hold until $100+ or buyout, whichever occurs first."
Let’s just c were it goes and if it can hold it my # is 79 plus
Not sure why exactly but AVAV is completely breaking down. I've been waiting for a good time to acquire and it looks like that opportunity has finally arrived.
Having followed this company for many years now. I would say their promise of bringing innovation to the Defense business with speed and quality is now paying dividends in spades. Nice to finally be recognized for the top tear tech company they are.
"Zacks did an analyst change 3 times in 3 days which should be illegal but what do I know? 2/20 from buy to hold, 2/21 hold to buy 2/22, buy to hold. Or maybe we need to sign up with these unscrupulous swing trade analysts."
Diamond in the rough AVAV
Some good green action here today. 70 calls are very active
RSI of 32 and below the Bollinger band. It will cross $101 in the next few days.
"SIMI VALLEY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 14, 2019-- AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV), a global leader in unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), today announced a major Middle Eastern ally awarded the company a firm fixed-price contract valued at $11,999,992 on October 25, 2019 for logistics support, spares, and repair services in support of its existing fleet of AeroVironment’s Puma AE and Raven B tactical UAS. The contract award period of performance is two years....keep em' comin"
"AVAV is one of two major players in the military drone market. They're the lesser known brand, but that means they're trying harder. And their visibility is under the radar. Earnings are EXPECTED to be lower because they spent a ton on getting that helicopter to Mars. But that was a success, and is a notch in their belt. Remember - if earnings EXCEED expectations, that is a HUGE benefit to the share price. As of right now, earnings estimates are already built in to the share price. I'm betting that ACTUAL earnings are HIGHER than expected.... by a LOT. Get in while the price is under $130/share."
"AVAV has only 24m shares outstanding 80% of which are held by institutions. Evidently both institutional and individuals are holding, making the available number of shares available for purchase very few. Those that want to buy must pay dearly under these circumstances In ligh of the last earnings report, this scenario for AVAV will remain in place for the long term."
"HAPS for military - ""In the near-space domain, AeroVironment is flight testing its next generation solar-powered, high-altitude pseudo satellite (HAPS). Dwelling for extended missions at an altitude of 65,000 feet, these HAPS systems can provide redeployable, secure connectivity and remote sensing across large areas of interest, supporting ground or naval operations employing tactical unmanned systems at the battlefield’s edge."""
70+ just around the corner ;)
"Technically, it breaks 250 sma resistance at $64 range and stands above another higher resistance lvl at $68-69 range, bullish signal, seems a concrete base was done, target $80"
Go to check SA site. It is up over $3 after market trading right now!
DRUS is where the action is.
new contract up to 400 mil
What brought on this pop.?Took a position last week @ $45..nice move!
"In at $81.50, 3,000 shares. A bit late to the party, but not complaining!"
EPS and rev look good. not sure why we see 2% down AH.. doesnt matter we will be fine.
OIL going up more need for EV . Motely projects a possible Double .I'll take $70
buy at 50
From$121 to $55.I never saw this coming.
went up to almost $100 and then to 90 in a few mins...
"My cost basis is 79 so at least I did not pick the top, as with some other dogs. :) gltaI wonder if there is a chance to wait it through"
"Another example short hedge fund bites the dust thinking they can manipulate price by such sensational news bashing the co. This reminds me of the guru of short fund Citron of Andrew Left who shorted NVDA, SHOP, SQ and VRX. Now every one of these has hit new high and still close to that prices now. Precise why I use these short hedges as contrarian indicators and profitable trading vehicles. These shorts are losing huge money along with their followers."
This is a gem bought 100 shares
"Re-energized the march to $200! before the EOY 2019, we'll be @200+"
"Just a blip. Rebuilding to be stronger, faster, more efficient and effective."
who is excited ? I am !
Avav makes the drones and sells it to katos which has a contract with the government ...Katos has satellite and avav drones ...bottom line avav drones used by our defense government ... gl

"Standing at 3k shares, looking to acquire another 1k in the not too distant future. Like the prospects here. GLTA"
There's movement alright 
Today is what U call a Big Dump!
I think I can get this at a lower price but this company has an impressive balance sheet.

"AVAV is so undervalued. Their (new) headquarters are next door to the Pentagon, and we need to keep a close watch on a country we've just abandoned physically and is being run by the Taliban. This is a no-brainer."

I expected a bigger punch with such amazing results... anyone else?
"Tim Conver, Chairman of the Board, sold about 10 million dollars worth of stock in the last 3 months at around 70ish a share. Could be one reason the stock keeps sinking"
I've also seen this happen a lot after decent earnings reports...pps almost always comes back within weeks.

"Also it looks like chairman has been selling 7000 shares each day from middle april to right before earning announcement day of 6/29. Even though it is prescheduled sales, could hard to believe he did not act like this based on inside info... is his sales legal?"
Game is being played to drop he share price after a stellar day. Waiting for earnings right now. The fact they have arranged a conference tomorrow morning for investors and WS bodes well for a good guidance.
I'm new to this. always manipulated?
"Frustrating, but have to be patient and wait for the stock to find some firm footing. It will. The business is strong, beating and raising the last 2 quarters, predicting revenue growth in a business that has great tailwinds with increased US military spending on drones planned."
Too bad a down day market-wise had to come after these spectacular results. AVAV would've soared. Not complaining. The rest of the market will find this beauty later on today. 60 Minutes?
"After this ER, and the current geopolitical and economic stresses throughout the world, someone please tell me how the stock price of a company with no debt and a backlog of orders goes back up again??"
"this is looking very solid, backlog is rocking! hope to see a runup in days to follow."
"With the new products being announced and the aerospace and defense meetings this week in DC, the stock can react to the upside."
Any news here? Why down so much lately? Is there not confidence in the changes at the top? The prospects seem so bright for this leader in military drones and in its space helicopter developments.
Up 200% in at 32$....buy more?

Have you guys heard anything about KWEMF on this board? It looks like they are using AVAV drones and have some potentially massive growth coming with DOD and NATO allies.

Nov 21 - Dubai Air Show - Drones are growing into a $100 billion industry22 Hours AgoUnmanned flying vehicles are growing in popularity all over the world.

"Some funny reporting with different news agencies reporting different things, but eps was $0.26 per diluted share not $0.24 as reported in some of the articles. Whether that is a miss or a beat depends on which analysts you polled, but was roughly in-line. Revenue was a beat, all are agreed. The 4th quarter fiscal 2018 was an impossible comparison - revenue and earnings have now shifted to an even distribution over the year, as they noted, and the 2018 number included the large litigation settlement benefit. But overall growth for 2019 was massive, and they are predicting double digit revenue growth for fiscal 2020. $200 million in government appropriated funds not counted yet in the backlog. New acquisition, new projects, continued growth in government spending on drones, it wasn’t the blockbuster earnings report many of us hoped for, but the future is still bright."
"On April 30, 2020, AeroVironment, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an amendment to the Design and Development Agreement (the “Amendment”) with HAPSMobile, Inc.

The total maximum net value excludes approximately $6.0 million of consideration paid to the Company by SoftBank Corp. under preliminary design agreements related to the program."
"Likely affected by erroneous auto-generated earnings summary article by the AP, Zacks, and Automated Insights that mis-quoted revenue as having missed expectations by approx $30MM. The correction notice is available under related AVAV News."
Wish I had saved some dry powder for this day.
I see some bullish options activities happening today expiring Jan 17 2020. we should be good
Drop on beat earnings? Joking right
Big contracts? Buyout? Privet sector?Where will this be in 5 years? It won’t be at this sp and it won’t go under..... time to buy

"Concerning the recent price action, with a P/S of 3.94 and a Forward PE of over 50, the current price is not a bargain. The return on equity is not great, either. But us longs are looking 5 to 10 years forward, and I see a company with a head-start in a disruptive business . The one-year chart does not look bad so I’m not worried. Consider the weakness a reasonable entry point."
Trump committed to 750 billion dollar defense budget.
wow. powerful results
NO ONE is selling good company ran up before earning OUTLOOK I say is GREAT and backlog even better
"If you listened past conference calls, would noticed this time Mr. Wahid ‘s confident and opening voice and attitude about guidance especially facing Analysts’ challenging questions!Definitely bottom up!"
Investors are funny. Earnings were solid and management reiterated annual revenue targets. Think UPOD.
I need a personal air space radar to monitor air traffic over my property. Does anyone know of an affordable system? I think it was an AVAV drone that flew over yesterday.
"So, what's the news?"
This is not even thinking of going up anytime soon
"Could not find much social activities for this stock , has been thinking whether to just sell and cut the loss. Though ARK seems to have bought 7900 shares of AVAV today."
"Drones are required for almost all countrys and US army in particular , this stock was beaten down for no reason."
so how do feel about earnings I liked it
Bummer. Rookie brokers and newbees who probably didn't even read the ER dumped big time. One time 13cent tax related expense was part of the reason for the 4cent loss. That equates to an 8cent non-gaap profit The rest of the ER is pretty solid.
Bought more today $43.50. Disclosure! Happy Trading.
why is this down? it had a good ER?
AVAV buys small VTOL maker for 25 million cash. AVAV has no debt. Seems like a good move to me. I am in the red with this stock but holding long term. Will buy more to lower my basis if the upcoming earnings report is positive. I don't know why the short interest is so high in avav but at some point I would think they have to cover.
"Would like in on this one. Any dip coming soon, or should I buy now? Could you please put a number on that ""to the moon"" comment? (Obvious rookie here.)"
had this on my radar for 6 months. Finally found the right time and right place. Very excited for this company's future and if it breaks down further I'm prepared to double up. :)
22nd Jan 2020Tunisia has ordered eight unmanned aerial vehicles from Aerovironment in the United States.
Pre-market trading wins again ...surprise surprise.Still up on market down day but that pre-market stuff angers me.
"When I heard about the wildland fires in California, it really struck me personally,” said Jacci Cenci-McGrody, senior technical marketing engineer for Nvidia. “I thought to myself, ‘How can I use Nvidia’s technologies to help the firefighters?’The answer: AI-enabled drones and a collaborative AI pipeline."
no reason for this to be down.
ARK buying ?
All this need is some good industry news and it'll really take off.....
Are you guys listening in?
I don't own AVAV right now but I might pick some up if it retraces. I I work in the aerospace business for about 15 years as an engineer. And I have to believe that we have seen the last pilot flown jet. Pilots pass out around 9 g's. You could probly get a design of a jet efficiently probably 15 to 20 g's is my guess. I'm sure there may be cases in the future where you need a pilot for something but I guarantee 95% of jets will not need pilots. Commercial airliners only use pilots now to take off and land. The rest is all auto pilot.
will it see 52 wk high tomorrow?
"Feels like this is one large investor pulling the plug - and not necessarily because of earnings. It's year-end, might be tax loss selling or rebalancing. The fundamentals are solid and the call was positive."
$200+No debt?Lots of cash?Growing sales and margins?
After hours single share selling and block buying manipulation. Someone is expecting a pop tomorrow.
Trump mentioned in Iraq today that we need drones to assist in security for our southern border.
"""A police helicopter costs from $500,000 to $3 million to acquire, and $200-$400 an hour to fly. Manned aircraft are large, complex machines requiring expert ground crews, multiple shifts of pilots and co-pilots, and (unlike drones which can often be hand-launched) runways or helipads."" Just need a wee bit faster AVAV drone to replace these..."
"I can't figure out why AVAV has been faded (hammered) off the recent highs following their great ER report. They raised guidance, the stock ran to $95, and 5 or 6 days later it's below where it was trading before the ER report. Thoughts?"
Great great great report :)
nobody has any comments
"When AVAV announced its big earnings beat 9/6/2018 of 0.85 eps, it guided eps for the full year of 1.1-1.4. The stock went as high as $121. In December it beat and raised full year eps guidance 1.3-1.5. The stock dropped to as low as $65. Now they beat and raise again to 1.6-1.8, with a negative reaction. If the stock was going to fall, it should have done so based on the guidance in September. (It did, but not until the whole market corrected.). Since then, there have been only positive surprises. The business, and therefore the stock, is worth more after the earnings beat and raise than before. It is oversold and should and will go up.For a small company like this that may finish orders at various times in the year, you can’t just look at one giant quarter (fiscal 2019 Q1, which included 0.26 eps of a litigation settlement) and now say the company is shrinking because subsequent quarters haven’t kept up. Except for a couple of outlier quarters there has been steady, sequential earnings and revenue growth. They are guiding further revenue growth. This is a premier company, a market leader in an industry that is growing, with the US expected to increase spending on drones by 15%/yr the next 5 years. As far as I’m concerned, this is a great price for a great company."
Crazy that KTOS has the market cap to buy AVAV. AVAV is very undervalued.
Good luck shorting AVAV close to 70% if not more owned by institutions Absolutely perfect management team one of the best investments I have done in early 2018 at $ 26.76 per share and I have plenty just wish I would have more between commercial licencing and Military contract I will just pray and you should too till then Gennady
Buy n hold.
"""Hand-launched AeroVironment Raven is the most widely used military unmanned aircraft system in the world"""
Nice haircut ! This is what happens when you roam the countryside with a PE ratio of 90.
Going to 200 soon
Finally just bought 300 shares @ 84. Good luck
Why didn't I buy this!! Been on my radar for over a year too...
Great earnings and great positive guide forward for upcoming year!
"Congratulations my fellow longs. I've been in Aerovironment for about 6 years, looking forward to Ms Woods company as we head toward s the next century marker of 200+."
"AeroVironment is now teaming up with Nvidia, IBM, Microsoft to cope with wildfires. And teaming up with Alphabet’s Loon, Nokia and Ericsson.I never know such proficient company ever."
I heard in the past they were in the recharging station biz...but nothing of that aspect anymore. what happened!!??
"I had this stock for a few years, got in in the twenties and made a few bucks when I left at 105.55 when this last quarterly came out. I'm still not understanding how AVAV has failed to be profitable at a time when drones appear to be the best weapon we have in our arsenal. Why has this company not flourished? Was it leadership in selling the product, bias in government contracts, maybe not a great product? Drones should be on the government best buy list but AVAV doesn't cut it. Why?"
Now $2.3b valuation. 8x forward 2019 rev and 95x forward 2019 eps. This is a defense contractor!
Great earnings! KABOOM!
AVAV to the moon after close 
Great entry point under 100 will make a nice 10 pts on this one
Pat each other on the back
Get on the train b4 it takes off tomorrow. I’m seeing 79+
EPS by Analysts Raised from .04 to .05 . Earnings report 3/6
"Why is AVAV up with such low Revenue guidance? Please enlighten me. Next full year revenue is between $290M to $310M MUCH LESS than $336.99M estimates. The recent examples such as ORCL and AOBC, they tanked with lower guidance vs estimates. This morning when it was down to $56's which is the right direction. Well, please let me know what I am missing here."
Whew!! What happened today?
why is this happening
"$AVAV I took new positions in $AVAV today. I have been researching to invest in a market leading, US-based Drones platform & analytics company with mature and stable cash flows, and $AVAV rose to the top of my list. AVAV offers a great pipeline of stable and ongoing defense contracts along with new growing revenue streams from commercial sector (their partnership with Soft Bank and Google to offer internet in remote areas, agricultural and climate resilience mapping drone applications). The stock is at a low price thanks to the historical sell-off. This stock has no exposure to COVID-19 or consumer spending. I recommend it a STRONG BUY, and it should be at $65-+ already!PS: I am an activist investor / analyst of sort... I take contrarian positions in misunderstood companies whose stock prices are depressed due to short sellers activity or typical WS analysts putting wrong Price Targets / Ratings. Look forward to working with you all my investor friends here on this board...!!"
"Even the Barron’s is willing to play this fake news game to support the hedge shorts. This news on carrying on board with explosives was totally rebuffed by the co and by an analyst’s report. Is it small wonder, investors no longer trust these supposedly leading financial journals which clearly have their own agenda connected to the short hedges."
Solid report!
This is one of gems of American tech industry.
Baird upgraded AeroVironment from Neutral to Outperform and raised the price target from $65 to $81.
TD Ameritrade had 1.3 million shares of AVAV traded today. Monday will be interesting to see where we go from here. GLTA!
"Anyone ever heard why AVAV doesn't have interest in the ""delivery drone"" market for UPS, Amazon, etc..?"
"if the HAWK30 gets any media this stock will run to $100 because it is disruptive leading edge technology that can handle voice/LTE/5G for a 200km radius. Would allow cell/data access over water and remote areas that would otherwise not have coverage, and can also be used to replace cell/data towers. Softbank will be the first to use this technology in Hawaii and Japan."
"So how do you trade from a high intraday of $95 after a great ER report, all the way to $71 in only 7 trading days? They raised guidance! This can't just be about Boeing and their problems, besides AVAV sells drones. No downgrades, no news, just solid revenue and earnings with raised guidance. The chart is a mess for whatever reason."
"Well, well, well. Stock could run but the shorts keep knocking it back down. If the Company does not appoint someone to watch the shorts, there is no hope for the price. Shorts are trying to take command again. One day of glory does not make a winner."
"I'll be buying dips here for a while, having such visibility with that big backlog is a giant confidence booster. We see 70+ in time....."
I am perplexed why us it sliding down?
Continue to hold AVAV despite the precipitous decline.
A CFO leaving a company like this is a non event. If that's the cause of the stock being off 5% then it looks like a buying opportunity.
Earnings on 11/29 lets see where this goes
Have over 1000 shares since first offering would hope you could have distribution at some point. Thank you. Chuck
is there a drone stock that pays a dividend?
I bought tsla at 30 but did not hold long enough to see 300+ days. I also bought avav at 27. This time I have enough patience to wait
"Doesnt seem very liquid, low $ trading on a large market cap. Is that a concern? Good, bad, not applicable?"
Really just the beginning for this industry. AVAV is well positioned both militarily as well as commercially. https://www.futurefarming.com/Tools-data/Articles/2019/6/Agricultural-drone-market-to-grow-to-USD-48-billion-434564E/
"Get in now ,going much higher!"
Kratos buyout could be a smart move from here looking long term.
Today would seem like an excellent time for the US to buy about 50 AVAV drones.
They did beat earring and revenue. Their expense to buy Pluse and openNewEngland innovation center will lower their next year eps but they guide higher revenues for 2020!
Why up so much today? Normal?
"I just went long AVAV again, this time more than I care to admit. I'm betting the stock recovers by the end of the day, and heads higher in the coming days/weeks. The report was great, the response was strange, however the market will reprice AVAV in the near term based on the fundamentals."
Wait....no movement after earning beat?
I think these guys just need to charge more.
Low volume today indicates that selling has decreased significantly. Three day rule today...I expect it will close GREEN today. GL to all longs...
Ticker AVAV is what a real drone stock looks like! I’m stuck in ticker: DRUS 
AeroVironment relocating next to the Pentagon. I can handle that.
Wasnt the helicopter on Mars right now made by AVAV?
"So quiet here, any investors? Just took a new position at these lows."
"Some stocks you buy to hold, this is one of them!"
"You people are oblivious to the real answer. Do you not watch the action of the chart of this stock. The last minute of the day the shorts activate a large sell, ( 3:59), and kills the stock. The Company tries to stop it but is not consistent. When the Company does stop it, the sellers knock it down the first thing the next morning. Some big short seller is killing this stock."
Earnings beat and raised guidance. Is anyone else confused here or is it just me?
"AVAV is grossly undervalued, that's a fact. And now that geopolitical tensions are escalating involving Iran, it's very reasonable to expect that a few select defense names will benefit. AVAV is a now in a partnership with KTOS whose stock has done very well, and with AVAV the leader in unmanned aircraft and drones, now may be AeroVironment's time to shine. AVAV got an upgrade and price increase from an analyst the other day, to $86. I'm in for the significant upside, no matter how long it takes."
"earnings are going to be up, this CO has a bright future:)"
Why down? what happend?
down in pre-market I wonder why?
"again avav disappoints, but I am still very much bullish when it comes to this co future. it seems to be full of opportunity and future growth."
"Sweet move up today. Earnings will be great, I hope."
this should rally in light of recent developments.
"Absolutely stellar report. In addition, the stock has been so beat up, that $70-$75 in the near term is reasonable. Technically, the monthly chart shows a strong buy."
AeroVironment Settles with United States Department of State for Voluntarily Reported Alleged Export Violations.1Mil charged over 2 years. hope we get good earnings next week
AVAV with their suborbital drones are sure to be included in the new ARKX. They are also already in the autonomous & robotics ETFhttps://youtu.be/_hj77MFfwSs
"Beat top and bottom but looks like a guide inline. Could be enough though, it’s been so beaten down. Let’s hope it rallies!"
I believe AVAV will retrace back around the $49 base. I have sold half of my investment for a double making my remaining shares free. I will hold them long term.
"wow, was that the dip from 109 to 106? People are holding this for the long term it seems...analysts will not upgrade AVAV for awhile, so this is a steep price to pay and hold until probably the next earnings date when it might get another upgrade. I'll watch it for awhile though.."
"Etrade increased margin rate from 25% to 55%. Therefore, some traders on margin got margin calls starting yesterday morning. They are forced to sell and drove down the price yesterday. I am holding on cash so Not affected and will double soon. Hold your shares it will go much higher. It will beat the next EPS and Revenue numbers nicely..."
Beat
Nice
This is one to buy on dips. It’s overpriced like a lot of growth stocks but it has zero debt. Long term winner for sure
It's gonna be alright. Strong company with good outlook regardless what the economy does next year. I'm buying on the dip...and will accumulate if it drops more.
"Excellent buying opportunity here, with price around $42."
I think its as simple as Blackrock rebalancing ETFs. They own 16% of the outstanding shares. This has nothing to do with fundamentals.
It seems we can either take the loss or hold til earnings in a few weeks to see if the analysts are proven wrong.
"From Stocktwits: ""AeroVironment director just picked up 3,000 shares "" It will go higher...."
