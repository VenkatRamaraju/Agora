Warren Buffett seems to have increased stake in SYF! Bullish!
Phenomenally run company.
what happened after hours?
Earnings Whisper is $1.13Potential nice beat!
"749,000 shares bought AH. Considering that's about 15% of the average daily volume I'd say that's significant. Another gem that no one cares about. Unlikely but would be nice to see a pop with a strong ER, but I'm not complaining, financials are going be desirable with interest rates rising"
"Warren Buffett may add to the position. Just like American Express, when it walk away from the Costco account cause profit margin is low, AMX tanks to 50-55, look at where AMX is today. Winning and losing accounts are part of the business, great management can adjust the actions accordingly. I am bullish on SYF , partly because WB team, partly because consumer spending is on the rise."
"cost per share 14.4-19.8 = -5.4 , so they give you five bucks when you buy this share and it earns five dollars a year. It is a good day to be alive and looking for deals. I'd love to put my whole portfolio in this but there so much else that is a fantastic deal. Come what may this will be harder and harder to beat as the best deal on the street."
"""Sell us your stock at $5 below market"" - Love, TRCSynchrony Financial announced today that it received notice of an unsolicited ""mini-tender"" offer by TRC Capital Corporation (TRC) to purchase up to 2.5 million shares of Synchrony's common stock at a price of $47.00 per share in cash. The offering price is 4.47 percent below the closing price per share of Synchrony's common stock on August 20, 2021, the last trading day before the offer was commenced. The offer is for approximately 0.44% of the outstanding shares of Synchrony's common stock."
Even if revenue and net income stayed flat for rest of year that's close to $10B rev and $5B net income. The margins are insanely good. The average analyst target of $57.50 is a complete joke. This should be at $60 minimum
I am laughing in buying this business that will generate profits for years to come with increase interest charges if people is out of work temporarily. The interest charge from the increase that will well offset any loan loss provision.
"@ Mark @Basil Wow! Even that earnings whisper was wrong.....they beat by $0.32 --> $1.24.There's a mention of a revenue miss, but I don't see 'Revenue' in the tables..Just Earnings.."
"I feel like you can safely ride this thru earnings. The trend is your friend, not only that but SYF has surprised Wall Street a number of times since ipo...this is a slow roller...perfect for Buffett....undervalued and a solid business...Buy and hold I say!!!"
wasn't expecting as large a drop based on the GAP credit card news.
Yes!
earnings coming out soon - hoping for a large share repurchase to be announced with the capital freed up from reserves for the Walmart portfolio sale. I think up to 6B will be available over the next few qtrs.and the board was exploring options during the last conference call
"AXP , JPM, BAC all have PE higher than SYF , I assume that means SYF still have some head room to run ... may be into mid 30's?"
Earnings are tomorrow morning buy now!!!
"what else does management have to do to get this price up? earnings, buybacks and dividend climbing way higher than last two years, but not close to all time high. unreal"
Did you all see the news about the amazon portfolio? Could be massive news for syf... hopefully they win it over amex. Could increase their loan portfolio massively. Bullish. Even now with current earnings at about a little over a dollar a quarter... see 65+ within the next year. on a 14 multiple... they will maintain dividends + massive buybacks. Killer stock. Cash Cow. Buy.
Warren Buffet is the King and he owns 20 million shares of SYF.
"Is there any reason not to buy this stock? They are bringing in all of the sales through Amazon and own the credit market, They have a billion users buying stuff on Amazon with their credit card"
Meaty volume today
"Why is this is so ridiculously cheap? Because interest rates are low/money still flowing to sexy tech plays with negative eps and horrendous cash burn and margins? HF algo trading because it's 99% institutionally owned? Mediocre management? Any ideas? I know float is 500M but they have huge margins, FCF, no need for offerings. Why aren't they buying back shares, making acquisitions, increase div? They got some upgrades recently -- where do you see this eoy? Is 55-60 reasonable? Seems dirt cheap, what am I missing"
"This is a $60-70 stock this year easily and I'm looking for triple digits within 2 years. When you look at the investment thesis with this stock, the list goes on and on.1. It's breaking out of a 3 year pattern where it found resistance at the same level we are now in arguably the best shape it has ever been in.2. The stock and financials in general has underperformed the market for too long. It doesn't matter what percent its up from November, relative to the market it still has a long way to go.3. The stock is tied in with the economic recovery and especially the consumer, providing loans and credit to every single sector. As consumer credit improves and stimulus helps bridge the gap the company will only generate more revenue.4. As the company is extremely tied in with the consumer, it had to hold tons of money for reserve, even more than J.P. Morgan and Goldman. As credit and the consumer improve, just think about how much cash they can release back into their operations.5. Synchrony Financial is clearly shareholder friendly, looking to boost the value of the people truly believe in the company with the 1.6 Million buyback. Additionally, when they release their reserve money, look for them to buyback even more stock as it trades extremely cheaply.6. Just look at the 10 Y T-Bill, all financials will benefit from rising rates.7. Unlike many financial stocks, Synchrony actually focused on establishing organic growth for the company post-pandemic. The Venmo card it launched with PayPal essentially links it with the largest virtual bank and the millions of customers PayPal has. This provides a nice runway for double digit growth in the next 2-3 years and sustained single digit growth following that.8. A majority of the stores who issue cards with Synchrony have contracts with it extending past 2025. We know for certain that this thing is going to be a cash cow till at least 2025.9. The only things that will stop this stock is if either the consumer doesn't recover fully or the economic growth we are going to see for the next 2-3 years stalls and hits a wall. I significantly doubt both. With all the stimulus in the market and the surprisingly positive February jobs report, we are heading to one of the strongest consumers we have seen. Furthermore, an accommodative Fed that would that sell their soul to achieve the employment rate that they wish should dispel any fear of a weak consumer. The more likely outcome for some of these financial, energy, and industrial stocks is if economic growth stall and would likely lead to a sell-off. Then stock picking will be very important, and if you own this one, you're going to be in a good spot.One more thing, I see that a lot of people were talking about firms upgrading the stock and giving price targets, that doesn't matter. What are they going to do if the stock runs to $60, downgrade it? The thing trades near 9 times forward earnings and PEG of just under 0.4. Forget about what these firms say, everyone who is in this stock is a smart investor, not one of these reddit investors who could care less about valuations and fundamental analysis. Stick with your gut and believe in your pick. Sit back and enjoy the ride with this one, its going to be a nice 4-5 years with this stock."
"The multiple on SYF is around 7...it should be 9 or 10. Despite all the stock buybacks and great earnings, until the market rewards them with a higher multiple you won't see the $50-$60 this stock deserves. Is it that the quality of the portfolio is subject to above average losses when the economy tanks and the market sees this in 2020-21?"
Shares short doubled in 1 month? Not sure I would be shorting this with 4B buyback in place - not much to gain and plenty to lose if they are on the wrong side IMHO
"Mixed results---higher EPS, lower charge offs, loss of Walmart portfolio, gain of Verizon business. I don't think this 10% drop is warranted; however, most stocks are off today. Just bought my first 500 shares today. Will add more is she sinks down to $27.50. Berkshire and GS and Vangard like this stock and I like them."
There's the buyback I mentioned. With that repurchase you pretty much assure an earnings increase based on fewer shares outstanding and it will help put a floor under the share price. I also noticed the short interest was quite a bit lower than last month. All in all - I am in this for the long haul.
"Please note that Synchrony Financial also issues cards for AMAZON...That's on top of many other large companies like Lowe's, Williams Sonoma, Havertys, etc... Moreover, and unlike Mastercard and Visa, Synchrony is a less expensive alternative for the merchants and can retain its relationships in hard time.Yes we are heading into a recession and millions of American consumers have lost their jobs, but don't expect SYF to go belly up because of bad loansLastly, there's a guy called Warren Buffett who is a major Synchrony shareholder and I trust that he will not let his investment turn sour..."

"Furthermore, despite being a new program, the Verizon card will have actual proven demand from Verizon customers,"" writes Orenbuch, who has an Outperform rating and $32 price target on SYF."
I wrote an article about SYF on seekingalpha. Feel free to read it.
"From the call transcript - ""We've purchased $1.3 billion approximately for the first 2 quarters under the plan. We have $2.7 billion remaining under the $4 billion authorized repurchase plan."" That will work out to $900M per qtr over the next 3 quarters or approx 400,000 shares a day based on $37 per share. I am still in this for the long haul..."
Buy aggressively here
"Long term productivity gain, time to add more"
"Guys any thoughts on the react price actions. I'm still long, and will continue to be unless something like fraud happens in the company, I'm pretty confident. Just some weird stuff going on. Stock didn't participate when bonds rallied up to 1.7 something and instead has been correcting. I assume this correction will actually be beneficial. Many funds, especially momentum funds, have to rebalance next week and I think this recent move from 42.50 to 39 is just giving these guys a better entry point. Still maintain my price target of somewhere between $60 and $70 by the end of the year."
Maybe 35 going toward 40 once the hedge funds and institutional traders chime in
Have you guys ever heard of http://alert-sounds.com/? The picks on there are way better than SYF
"Technically this stock is basing and it is looking better each passing day. I owned this stock several times and traded it. Now truthfully, although I have small positions, I am looking to increase those positions. This reminds me of TEVA another one of Buffett's stocks. I got a nice gift today from Teva, I think the same will happen at SYF in the near future."
Why down so much?
