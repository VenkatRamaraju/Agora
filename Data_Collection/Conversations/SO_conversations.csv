This is a Buy and Hold for the Dividend...
just can't hold onto any gains - it pops nice then heads red for the day 9th day in a row down!
Continuing to buy in regularly during recent price decline this year.
"strong, solid move up here all day so far....why is this board so quiet, i'm just talking to myself I think..."
I have been investing in stocks for the past 25 years and SO is one of the best stocks that I have owned. I have never lost sleep owning this stock
Utilities/energy sector rally as price surges and anticipated higher demand towards winter! #SO
"dividend yield now 4.22% not bad these days for solid blue chip type stock, I am adding..."
good buy opportunity with this lull....solid company and great dividend-
"Hedge funds increasing position in SO lately, dont take my word for it, read the article.Maybe my strategy of adding SO shares during this little lull or pullback will payoff.I predict a new 52 week hi by end of November...also, LOVE the dividend it rewards shareholders with."
These 6 analysts have an average price target of $63.5 My conclusion Nuke issues way out of line not to mention over focus on wokeness.
"4% dividend----solid....but for some reason struggling to get buys, it will turn up soon"
"I worked in the oil refining industry for 32 years. Unexpected things happen, believe me."
"I'm pretty bullish on SoCo. First you have demographics in play and the SE continues to grow and expand both organically (kids stay) and inorganically (people moving here from elsewhere). So you have increased demand from humans + increased demand from the increasingly electrified economy (cars). I still think it will take much longer than most people and car companies think to convert from ICE to electric, especially with the infrastructure required, but I would expect demand to be up for SoCo watts and nuclears power by at least 50% within the next 5 years. And as rates are regulated by per kw/hr, increased consumption = increase revenue and non-linear increased profit."
What’s with this slide today? Because of mentioning Vogel proposed start up? We all know this already…..Thought this was priced in
Thinking about dumping SO and going elsewhere.
"Before everyone gets their shorts in a twist consider the following quote from SO press release. .. . . . . .""Progress continues to be made towards Unit 3 fuel load following the successful completion of hot functional testing this summer. Unit 3 direct construction is 99% complete, with the total Vogtle 3 & 4 expansion project approximately 95% complete."""
Racial equity 700 K donation from SO there is a better way to do this in Georgia I don’t live any ware near Georgia but I donated to a good man there. The best way to help racial equity actually all equity in the state is Hershel Walker a supper good man. Hershel is a fighter no nonscience to the point all around the best person to fight for all he knows we all are one race AMERICANS any questions.
"seems like with the markets being so crazy now, people would be flocking to stocks like SO for safety purposes and respectable dividend yield-"
"Hot off the press today love this one Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has taken a decisive stand against the pernicious encroachment of “woke” politics into America’s top corporations by introducing a bill to “enable shareholders to hold woke corporations accountable.” Dubbed the “Mind Your Own Business Act,” the bill released Thursday would empower shareholders with the power to successfully sue a corporation if the corporation is behaving in “woke” ways that undermine its “fiduciary duty” to the shareholders."
Is the last few months of red ink for SO due to it being in an anti-woke short hedge fund's portfolio?The expectation is that overconcentration on wokeness leads to neglect of fundamentals
