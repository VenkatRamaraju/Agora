"dividend yield now 4.22% not bad these days for solid blue chip type stock, I am adding..."
I'm checking into this. please post any articles that you think might help. Thankshttps://www.myajc.com/business/kempner-georgia-power-nuclear-tower-teeters-emcs-concerned/wJb830Vfybvq2shcFxxc5H/
why are we down on a good earnings report ?
"I have owned Aflac for 30 years and always reinvested the dividends I wish I could say I have 10,000 shares but, I do not. I have put together a little more than 3,500 shares using a Drip plan. If you are a young investor please look at drip plans"
"Strong dividend, great earnings, renewable energy, trend will go higher"
"Southern Company’s third-quarter earningsIn the third quarter, Southern Company’s total revenue fell 2.6% YoY to $6 billion, possibly due to the sale of its subsidiary, Gulf Power, in January. Meanwhile, its kilowatt-hour sales fell 4.7% YoY and its customer count fell more than 4%. This year, Southern Company expects EPS of $2.98–$3.10, representing flattish YoY growth."
Payday today.
With interest rates so low Southern Company is a much better investment than the bank. Money should flow into this safe haven.
I tried to add to SO after hours at $51.70 but the ask is $53.50 so that's a bogus price after hours. No need to be concerned lol
"Vote extended to 7PM Now! Drama! Drama! Drama! At least both sides are still negotiating, that's a good sign progress is being made!"
Last day to get dividend is tomorrow. If price goes up enough by tomorrow I will take profit and buy back later after another 4-5 point drop. It adds up when you buy 2000-3000 shares at a time. It's all in my Roth so profit would be 100% tax free.

"So are you thinking SO will trade above the option price of $65.00? (like it is now) The holders will purchase a ton of shares @$65.00 and sell them back pocketing the difference? If so, what does that do to the stock at that point?"
have had southern company since the early 90s safe when mkt. tanked. SO went down a fraction good for a nervous investor!!
Can someone educate me the difference between SOLN and SO? And how's SO compare to SRE in term of long term investment? Thx in advance.
"I am long on SO, in this over stretched market.. I take the dividend and bank it for the correction. Maybe next week or next year, no one knows when that will be..."
Hey. Southern company still has coal fired power plants. Relax. They can stock up to 100 days of fuel for power onsite. Believe me when I say that coal is clean these days. A lot of filters on the fuel that is burned. Read up on it or stay in the dark.
So at 54 - great time to add to positions
well I have had this stock for 20/years and a day like this big drop in the Dow. SO goes up! not exciting but safe with a good div
"Be interested to see if they bump up dividend in may quarter, they have for years!"
Sell today and dividend is gone w/Southern Co record date is not until 5/21. A little different than some other Utes.
Slow steady climb.
"I've been dumping the D, who are cutting the divy, and put it into DUK, and especially SO when the div yield hit 5%+. Makes sense to me.. also bought a few SRE, they have a monster DGR. I'd like some NEE, but that valuation is too much in the stratosphere for me.."
"My Mom told me to buy this stock back in 94, after I had just sold my company. I only bought 200 shares, then at $20.If I had put all my investment money into SO at that time, I would be a rich man now!The market has tanked a few times since then, but each time SO only lost 10-15% of its share price.Despite the ""experts"" downgrading it over the years, it has been one of the best long term stocks to buy......I now own 2000 shares and will buy more..."
It's really really astonishing watching utilities having this kind of volatility. Been in the market almost 30 years and have never seen this. Never.
"Owned this stock for twenty five years, when I retired I sold enough to pay off our house, sold some more to diversify, still own 2100 shares, will add some more if it drops below 43.25."
so the vote has been pushed back till 7pm est
"summer usage spike begins in Southeast, revs up up up earnings up up up"
Nice dividend increase announced today.
What do you think earning will bring?
"Retired and using dividend payments as income, no plans or need to sell my shares, ever!"
"4mvp when you speak of 3.02 could you explain what you are talking about...just getting into stocks and was thinking of making a substantial investment in SO, Thank you in advance"
Today is dividend payday.
A new buy chance!!!
"APC CEO just sold $14.6 million in SO stock on 6/10/19, any thoughts, ideas?"
"The Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, located near Waynesboro in eastern Georgia near the South Carolina border, is jointly owned by Georgia Power(45.7%), Georgia Power is a Major Subsidiary of SO.Time to add to my position, in view of all the so-called EV invasion!"
"Adding more, my div reinvest , Holding for retirement ."
https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/southern-company-recognized-as-2020-sepa-utility-business-models-power-player-of-the-year-301100508.htmlGreat recognition for southern company. They have a lot going for them. They have positive earnings and great dividends. Definitely a company to buy and hold.
"Press release - ATLANTA, Oct. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Southern Company today announced a regular quarterly dividend of 60 cents per share on the company's common stock, payable on December 6, 2018 to stockholders of record on November 19, 2018. This marks 284 consecutive quarters – more than 70 years – that Southern Company will have paid a dividend to its shareholders that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter."
"After the last couple of days to still be in the plus column, and dividend coming in Nov!Next earnings should again beat as they do every qtr. and now that the bad news about the additional cost on plant Vogtle are already baked in, blue skies ahead at least for a while! Long term hold! Hold and make $"
Anyone buying today?
Looks like construction will continue
dividends !!
I have had southern. co. for over 20 years not a glamour stock but safe with good dividend if it goes down to 45 I would think good buy.
"Our SO is way up and I’m so very happy about that, and therefore I have considered selling and taking a nice profit. However when considering other investments and utes, I discovered SO’s PE to be lower than all comparable equities, plus I expect a dividend increase soon. When I got into SO as a hold for life, it just might be that."
"I started to accumulate today at 44.16, then 44.10. If it goes down tomorrow I'll buy more. I can average down a long time if needed but usually stocks that have sold off like this rebound and I sell for a small profit just like I did with PPL today and IBM and ALB last week."
"Another Quarter, Another Beat!"
"If you pull the chart out to five years, SO traded in a pretty consistent 45-53 dollar range, but in 2019 shot all the way up to 70 before falling in March. Any idea why the big runup in 2019?"
"I am still down about 7%, but will sit back and collect the dividends."
"I like this stock, solid company headed in the right direction. I don't see this stock getting too badly hammered, when the market tanks. And I definitely see that coming sooner rather than later, and I have positioned my investments accordingly."
"I think Southern Company is strong as ever. It will trend upwards, but drop everytime there is any news. Vogtle will be eventually be completed. It will continue to look like a multibillion dollar boondoggle. But, something will cause a setback for coal or gas powered"
"Revenue Came in Lower than Expected: Revenues of $5.4 billion came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.8 billion.Key Stats: Southern Company’s total retail sales fell 10.5% as residential and commercial sales both declined. Moreover, industrial sales fell 5% year over year. This brought about a downward movement in overall electricity sales and usage. Total electricity sales during the first quarter were down 11.2% from the same period last year. Meanwhile, total wholesale sales slumped 13.3% year over year.The power supplier’s operations and maintenance cost decreased 9.6% to $1.3 billion, while the utility’s total operating expense for the period – at $1.7 billion – was down 65.6% from the prior-year level."
Another run at $44. today! Nice slow steady climb over $50. this time around!
I have been investing in stocks for the past 25 years and SO is one of the best stocks that I have owned. I have never lost sleep owning this stock
"Love my SO stock after 4 decadesGreat dividends, long term investments"
Plant Vogtle expansion gets green light to continue! Yea!! Well at least that's outta the way!
Does anyone know how well the Nuclear Power plant project is going ?
"I would like to get some SO but I feel like Im missing something here. They are investing in Nuclear, which is probably the most efficient way to go but with the recent cost overruns which pushed SCANA ( Dominion now) off the cliff, it seems that any nuclear plants in the works would be risky risky risky! The red tape and cost is probably enormous! It seems most Utilities are slowly divesting themselves on Nuclear energy. Why is SO still going down that road? It seems far more easier to pour a concrete pad, buy some natural gas fired turbines, grid tie it, ask for a slight rate increase and go about your merry way spinning power.I would like to buy some SO but it seems they are like a pit bull latched onto this nuclear thing, which I fear may come back to haunt investors eventually. Someone got some insight to what Im missing here?"
Yep solar and wind going to take over! Ask the people in the south and mid-west today!
just can't hold onto any gains - it pops nice then heads red for the day 9th day in a row down!
"Hedge funds increasing position in SO lately, dont take my word for it, read the article.Maybe my strategy of adding SO shares during this little lull or pullback will payoff.I predict a new 52 week hi by end of November...also, LOVE the dividend it rewards shareholders with."
Utilities/energy sector rally as price surges and anticipated higher demand towards winter! #SO
Dividend and Growth!
I believe SO is worth about $50.
"What happens to SO if they vote to stop this expansion - ""A decision on the expansion of Georgia’s Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant is expected by Monday"""
"It's down today because last day to get .60 div. Ex div tomorrow, higher yield buying today going forward"
"Wind turbines frozen, solar panels covered with snow. How is that green energy working out for ya??"
$56.72 is a good entry point if you can get it
"I'm just sitting back, enjoying the dividends.Less stress that way."
"Looks like they raise the dividend EVERY year around May time frame. I wouldn't bet on too much of a pullback given that they have raised dividends for something like 18 years straight. It does seem like the stock is resting in the $61 - $63 range for now. We are long term, automatically reinvesting dividends and we're planning to let it cook for another 15 - 20 years before we start taking those dividends as income instead of reinvesting."
"Yesterday's trading had 61% shorting, over 1.1 million shares. So evident share price is controlled. Today is great day to buy."
"""By all accounts, 2019 was an outstanding year for Southern Company, as we performed well across a broad range of metrics,"" said Chairman, President and CEO Thomas A. Fanning . Hmmm? Why did you dilute shareholders to the tune of 32 million additional shares outstanding in the last 12 months?"
Racial equity 700 K donation from SO there is a better way to do this in Georgia I don’t live any ware near Georgia but I donated to a good man there. The best way to help racial equity actually all equity in the state is Hershel Walker a supper good man. Hershel is a fighter no nonscience to the point all around the best person to fight for all he knows we all are one race AMERICANS any questions.
"Been buying So since 2007, trying to build an avg $1k monthly supplement from dividend.My advice: start young, will be wealthy by retirement."
Sounds like natural gas is the ONLY option if you want to stay warm ALL of the time!
I am going to add to my position if it gets to $64.00 after this pay date. Go SO!
"I've been waiting for a >5% div yield to add some shares. I don't give a #$%$ what Mizuho says short term, except thanks for giving me a >5% and increasing forward yield..works for me! (early retired with a div paycheck)."
"I agree that the stock has gone down to the extent that dividends will take a long time to cover if you think the price will NEVER increase. I think SO will report strong earnings over the next two years, ensuring the dividends and also signal price appreciation. If you sell today, where would you put the X number of $$ to earn over 5%? The loss is paper loss until you sell. Selling locks in your loss of course."
good time to buy. 5.2% dividend with plenty of upside
I don't know why investors worry about the decline in the stock price. If you are a long term investor your reinvested dividend will buy more shares and pay more dividends down the road. You never lose until you sell at a loss. Just sit it out and in the long run you will see the benefit of you patience.
"Hello everyone, I bought SO for the first time about 2 weeks before ex-div,I don't see div posted to my Merril lynch account yet. Just wonder when? Thanks"
"I've been day trading for years and I'm so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They're pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don't beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
Is the last few months of red ink for SO due to it being in an anti-woke short hedge fund's portfolio?The expectation is that overconcentration on wokeness leads to neglect of fundamentals
"U.S. utilities are looking to miniature nuclear reactors, as they seek a steady energy source that can help reduce the carbon emissions linked to climate change.While power companies have stopped building big nuclear reactors because of cost overruns and construction delays, not all utilities are giving up on nuclear power.There is only one full-size nuclear plant under construction in the U.S. -- Southern Co.'s expansion of its Vogtle facility in Georgia. The project is more than five years delayed and billions of dollars over its initial projected cost. Numerous plants around the country are in the process of being closed or decommissioned, as the industry faces political opposition to nuclear power and competition from low-cost natural-gas power plants and renewables such as wind and solar."
Thinking about dumping SO and going elsewhere.
"For the money, there are few stocks with a beta and dividend like this. Close to 5%, hard to beat. The only other one I own like this is ABBV. Currently I own 2300 shares with SO, may be adding another 1K or 2K shares."
"consider... I have nearly a 50% gain from SO shares bought <2 years ago.. counting the divs reinvested since, it's well over 50%. In a ute! It's a no brainer to buy the best utes low, with a div yield well above bonds.."
looks like a beatsome kemper issue but fy18 is in line and q3 guidance is in line to a little over 1.04 est (1.05 projected)stock down ???
what's the deal?
Bought on Christmas EveWent up $4 since.Great gift !
Southern Company Gas partners with Chauncey Black famous for his song (bootie call) this is the left hand wonder what the right hand is doing. What ever happened to miss dig I guess that was to simple well they have a song (no diggity) woke is the new way with SO happy.
In an unstable world this company looks pretty stable
$50. share public offering along with ex-div. -.62 on Friday will have this testing $50. by the end of this month! ... all above the board trading as CEO sells 1.5 million shares just before public offering!
"Very nice earnings print. I listened to Q&A and couldn't be happier with this management team. They are prepared, confident and very straight forward."
Definitely some downward pressure here on SO. There must be some who are seriously concerned about issues with the new nuclear power projects. Otherwise they keep beating earnings estimates and raising the dividend every year so maybe this dip in the share price is a great buying opportunity. I also think once the nuclear plants are finished SO should be up at $80/share or better.
SO should be at least $50.
I was supposed to get a dividend check this week I don’t have one anyone else behind
So if i buy this stock today do i receive the dividend
bought 300 shares around 44.5. this is my first time buying so. I dont expect growth from so.but I think it is seriously undervalued at this level. just invest in value
"Still have a few hundred shares under $43, that I'll be keeping forever! Thinking under $50. might be the new $43? Who Knows anymore!Either way sitting tight and adding on any correction!"
"""The vote came after the commission's advisory staff recommended letting Georgia Power complete the project only if the company passed on some of the additional costs to shareholders rather than try to recover all of the money from ratepayers."" . . . . . related to cost overruns at Nuclear power plant. Explains some of the recent price action."
"The bottom looks to be today's low $43.16! With Goldman's ""Sell"" it should be considered a ""Strong Buy"" since they also said to sell MSFT @ $45. (Since Doubled!),wait for next pullback to low $43.'s again maybe and the pounce! IMO."
"Over Bought Territory! Could go higher, could go lower, tricky this one!Southern Company (SO) stock has a median target price of $47.09, which indicates an estimated downside of 4.4% for the next 12 months. Currently, the stock is trading at $49.29Morgan Stanley raised Southern Company’s target price from $44.5 to $46.0 on February 12"
"The whole Market is at record high,will it go even higher? Yes if Trump is reelected, Probably crash big time if not. Don't really see much change from now until then"
"I have been accumulating Southern stock since late December as it's been dropping. Currently, getting 5% dividend yield from averaging down with additional purchases over time. Any thoughts on continuing this strategy as a means of attaining greater dividends at higher yield in this environment of higher inflation? In addition, it acts as a hedge in case this bull market turns bearish as SO has weathered prior bear markets relatively unscathed! Since I don't need the cash, I can continue to hold this stock for several years and eventually the stock price is will move higher for an opportunity to sell. Very tempting to purchase more stock today and take advantage of the ""ex-dividend"" date today!"
"SO is a great company, if it wasn't Hunter and the Big guy wouldn't invest their China and Moscow money in it..."
investors will move back into SO for its dividend and EPS growth history
Tip from Charles Payne show last year. Got in at $42. Hope this ride keeps going!!Think I'll enjoy ride and dividends. Thank Charles
These 6 analysts have an average price target of $63.5 My conclusion Nuke issues way out of line not to mention over focus on wokeness.
Nearing the 52 week high.
"Watch for the late fade as it goes ex-div., more downside coming, careful here!Trap is being set!"
"I have owned SO investments for 3 decades, started with some 7.5% notes, when redeemed I bought stock. I believe the strengths of any entity are in the quality of the management. Able to identify and quantify risks and be proactive to changein their industry. SO was first with their Nuclear energy technology, and has weathered the recent financial challenges metin building the additional facilities. Betting over $200K and reinvesting each dividend.AAA+++ in my book."
Tell me where I can get 5.1% on my money with pretty much no risk? folks- back up the truck here.
"I'm pretty bullish on SoCo. First you have demographics in play and the SE continues to grow and expand both organically (kids stay) and inorganically (people moving here from elsewhere). So you have increased demand from humans + increased demand from the increasingly electrified economy (cars). I still think it will take much longer than most people and car companies think to convert from ICE to electric, especially with the infrastructure required, but I would expect demand to be up for SoCo watts and nuclears power by at least 50% within the next 5 years. And as rates are regulated by per kw/hr, increased consumption = increase revenue and non-linear increased profit."
Today's trading of SO will be very interesting now that Vogtle will continue and the Fed is raising interest rates.
"Can this just keep going higher?All Yahoo keeps doing is raising the Price Target at every move higher, just unreal!Got a base amount under $43. and will hold forever now! Any pullback appears to be a buying opportunity!"
"Ok who or what corporation is buying Southern Company? Seems like someone is intent on buying this company, otherwise who can explain this rocket ride???"
The market recovers and down go the utilities with Southern leading the way.
Here is an article from last month on the up coming vote.http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Oglethorpe-to-vote-on-Vogtle-future?feed=feed
OMG!! Now an 11:30 PM extension to get this deal done! It will get done!
Continuing to buy in regularly during recent price decline this year.
I’m new to dividend investing. Can this stock keep appreciating or is it headed for a downturn? Thanks for any detail on why it could go the way you think.
WOW SOUTHERN WHAT A RUN INVESTORS LOOKING FOR YEILD AND SAFETY KEEP IT GOING.
Got my dividend!
"So, new high today bought loads of So 9 years ago at 40, I don’t know if I should sell, don’t really need the Div, any advise ?"
"I think we retest the low 50s due to natural gas price surge and fuel cost increases. Dividends are nice though, and long term I’m bullish, but the next few months will be rocky."
I originally purchased SO. because it was the electric utility where I lived. 500 shares back in 2004 $28 something. Sitting on dividend reinvestment. I actually doubled down bought 500 more when it was $38 something. Widows and orphans its not huge but it pays insurance bills and no bank account has interest comprable.
I'll just sit back and collect the dividends. Don't get excited.
18% Revenue growth. I'll take that.
"With increasing Vogtle construction costs....and with the Fed's commitment to raise interest rates in the future, I don't see much upside to SO.....only a slow gentle slide downward with fewer and fewer upward swings.....their current dividend rate is the only positive I can find right now."
div increased to annual 2.56
Still looking for a near bottom entry point to purchase Southern stock but the price keeps going down.....I think the decline is more on the utility industry as a whole rather than Southern specifically....I may have a long wait.
"Slow steady climb, with a good dividend, I'm sticking around."
This is a Buy and Hold for the Dividend...
"Hey folks, have you heard the energy secretary, stating the only way to decarbonization, is Nuclear power. So much for Green energy. You can't clear cut standing forest, releasing tons of carbon, and eliminate future growth of carbon capturing trees..."
"The only thing driving this is the 10 year, it sure isn't the financials! Not Overpaying here!Southern Company reported total revenue of $5.10 billion in the second quarter compared to $5.63 billion in the second quarter of 2018. This difference represents a fall of more than 9%Southern Company’s total retail electric sales fell more than 7% in the second quarter. Its total number of customers decreased by 8.6% in the quarter. So far this year, Southern Company has added net 23,000 residential electric and 14,000 gas customers due to strong jobs and population growth in the Southeast region. Its electric sales to industrial customers fell more than 5% mainly due to global trade concerns and changes in production levels.Southern Company’s management maintained its full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $2.98–$3.10 for 2019. This guidance implies flattish earnings growth compared to 2018."
"Hey don't see Awesome anymore? I guess Mr. Negative can't be negative anymore!! Go SO!! Great long term ""holder""!!"
Well this is a good day
$60 this week. $72 this year
where are the brakes to stop this slide - every trade is down down $ 5 this month #$%$
I'll buy at 42 - 43 range...
Happy that I bought this stock years ago.
"Just joined the SO group. 100 @ $65.00. I wanted one utility in my portfolio so I was following duk, sre, xel, & d. Southern has been paying their dividend for 19 years. All the power companies are holding debt, but you investors seem confident in Southern’s future earnings."
"seems like with the markets being so crazy now, people would be flocking to stocks like SO for safety purposes and respectable dividend yield-"
An individual trader I converse trades only utilities and holds them just long enough to lock in the dividends and moves on to the next utility. He has an entire schedule on when to buy and sell. He appears to me making a compounded return of 30% on his investments. I know it’s a lot of trading but he does it on his lunch hour...Has anyone heard of anyone else doing this sort of thing and being successful at it?
"Now is the time to accumulate, I've always made money in the long run. Patience is the KEY on this one."
We are created equal why is thin company obsessed with all this nonsense privilege is anyone’s for the taking. I am a old white man that worked my behind off for a better life. My friends of color I grew up with in the 60ts most are better off than I am I am very happy for them. Most of my posts get taken down SO needs to jump off the boat on this BS and focus on real issues.
"Buying southern Company is like buying gold it's a safe investment because people will not stop using electricity and will only increase as the economy opens up again. Southern Company is undervalued, overlooked, and is a steal at these prices."
"So much for the 10 year note going to 4.0 like the experts predicted, 52 week low today! Southern should remain solid until the 10 year or hedge funds decide to drive it back up!Always take any decent profits and ignore the so-called experts!"
"All four owners agreed to continue with the Vogtle expansion.Am glad to see that reason has prevailed.Just consider this; the Plant Vogtle expansion, that is unit 3 and 4, represent the only site with 21st century nuclear technology to be built in the USA.China is currently going through commissioning on the same technology.Are we, the USA, who wrote the book on turning nuclear energy into a power plant instead of a bomb, are we going to play second fiddle to other countries; including China?"
oh man I almost bought at 55. Then watched it climb a bit higher. Now it is getting tempting. I like solid dividends
Not that I care I'm in for the long hall.
"for you DRIPpers, we get more shares as it plunges"
where from here?
Thanks for the payday SO.
Big move today on what looks to be heavy volume so far. I guess that resting/consolidation period is OVER !
Wow finally a Ash Beneficial Center that was yesterday today SO celebrates 811 day all this great news just the last 2 days. I have a few great ideals what they can do with there Ash I am fully woke now SO happy.
Today another all time high over $60 few months ago.someone was saying they were going to buy when it hit 42 ha! I have owned this stock for over 25 years never saw it making these.kind of gains?
Any reason for the almost $2 drop over last week?
How does SOLN differ from SO? Is SOLN a preferred stock. I'm having a hard time finding information.
buying on dips selling on rallies making money 2% at a time
"Hey 4mvp, looked like price wasn't wasn't going below 42.80, then i blinked and what do you know, I'm in at 42.75. Good starting point to start accumulating shares. Looks like an interesting few years ahead of us."
"topped expectations, the market does not care (apparently)"
This is long term hold never reduced the div 5 to 8% position let it ride take a nap and forget it. Why trade it
"Hot off the press today love this one Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has taken a decisive stand against the pernicious encroachment of “woke” politics into America’s top corporations by introducing a bill to “enable shareholders to hold woke corporations accountable.” Dubbed the “Mind Your Own Business Act,” the bill released Thursday would empower shareholders with the power to successfully sue a corporation if the corporation is behaving in “woke” ways that undermine its “fiduciary duty” to the shareholders."
"SO Good dividend, but I am not sure I want to own it any longer."
"I know what you mean, so has ben good to me"
Southern Co : Morgan Stanley cuts target price to $52 from $57
Adding 10% to all my power company stocks in the next two months.
"I just looked up last year's dividend increase press release. It came out on April 20th, 2020. So we should be seeing the news for this year's dividend increase in about 7 weeks or so I would think."
I have it in my Roth so the 5.5% divvy is 100% tax free. Double the best CD rate.
Very undervalued. That’s ok Because 2 new nuclear plants hitting the grid soon. Nothing but money makers and cheap energy in the long run. You will notice it on your power bill 
"This is a great company. Buy it for the long term, as the stock price and dividends will continue to increase. It has survived the hurricane season, so hopefully there will be less costly issues that affect the company's profitability. I live in California, and would never purchase a California utility stock!"
$1.00 loss in one day usually means it rebounds next day. But I think I will wait a little longer too.
"According to a recent Zach's article, 90% of the owners & co-owners of the Vogtle Project must approve to continue or the project will be scrapped........what's the chances of that happening???If it is approved to continue, will that have a positive or negative effect on the share price?....Are investors betting on continuance or cancellation of the project?....Any ideas?"
"I bought a few more shares this morning. According to my crystal ball, Southern will rise until bad news hits again, fall/ recover, and will eventually retain the status of rock solid performer."
Simply amazing. The nuke project must be in the home stretch. Cost basis $45!
good buy opportunity with this lull....solid company and great dividend-
Dec 1st $52.
"4% dividend----solid....but for some reason struggling to get buys, it will turn up soon"
"SO is hitting the 5% (46.60) dividend mark today. You should buy,buybuy. Simple folks, if you keep it simple. Read and heed, and thank me later ;)"
$45 is just around the corner.
I would love to have a conversation about the recant news and some past news from Sothern Company.
I'm going to cash in a CD (that's earning very little) and buy some of this stock shortly. Past history shows SO to be pretty solid.
What’s your thoughts about this stock?Good or Bad?
How do you end up ahead if you get the dividend but the stock goes down / sells off on the ex dividend day such as it’s doing today ? Does it typically come back in the value of the price it’s losing today ?
they beat earnings and the stock is down before the market opens
"I would not be surprised if the Fed signals a stall or slow down in rate increases. Sure the market is overheating, but inflation remains at historical lows for the economic growth we think we have. Should this happen, dividend stocks will rally."
Why is this dropping??
does southern company reduce the dividends since stock price going down
"When SO is the only stock I own that's up, it's a very bad day :("
Nice move up today!! I noticed the upgrade yesterday from Guggenheim that may be helping. Anyone have any other news that might be causing the bump up today and recent strength ?
"I bought a load of this stock for safe dividends and some appreciation. How can I be upset if the price goes down when I reinvest the dividends? If the stock is lower you get more stock when reinvesting, then eventually when it rises again you have much more than if you had just taken the cash dividends !"
"SO trending toward $60, trend looks great, company doing great on track"
not long now.....we will find out if shorts will have to cover or not...
This stock is doing well lately. Im happy with it. Can it continue?
Time for a 2-1 split
"10 of thousands of people retiring each year and they need as safe as they can get Investments ...SO,D, ED are going to be a couple that will see $$ going into them."
SO a great hold for long term. Dividends should remain steady. I’ve owned for years and added to my position in dips.........like now. Dividends will be a great supplement to retirement. While not guaranteed I for one think they are solid at current level even if they have to suspend the regular growth of the dividend.
Looks like the all time high was around $70.40/share. Might be seeing that sooner rather than later if earnings are good and dividend increase is as expected.
