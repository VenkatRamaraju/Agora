"I don't understand what's going on with this stock. They announce a distribution of .45 per share. Yesterday I buy 2800 shares at 14.14 and buy the close it's down to $12.92, now today after a brief rally it's down to $12.88. Why is everybody selling prior to the Ex-Dividend date???"
any opinions on this stock?
Has ETRN officially stated their dividend rate for 2019?
Equitrans Midstream is up 13.47% to 10.11
"I can understand the delay in MV pipeline, but don't get it why cost goes up from 3.5B to 6B. Did they put out a random number originally as an estimate of the cost???"
I'd like to see a commensurate pay cut management to the dividend cut. They are NOT doing their job.
Buy and hold through dividend date. Make almost 4%. Then sale or enjoy the dividends and hold. I love me some dividends.
"Quick question, I saw they still have 800m to spend on capex until MVP comes online and looks to me like they are paying out most of their income on the dividend. With only about $500m current assets and about the same on current liabilities, where is the money going to come from? Have they mentioned their source of funding in the past? I would think they would need to borrow it."
Equitrans Midstream reached a 52 Week high at 11.35

"For those that don't know how this will play out....it's simple from this price level.If EQT survives in it's present form (no BK or reorganization) ETRN will thrive....regardless of whether the MVP gets delayed again.EQT, with a 25% headcount reduction, hedges. lower drilling costs and recent bond action (moving debt outward) are set for at least the next two years of low NG prices (but really set up for one at sub 2).The question is if NG prices stay sub 2 for the next two years....then what? A BK at EQT will mean 74% of EQM/ETRN's revenue is at risk (not lost.....just up for renegotiation since in BK all contracts are tossed out).Even then the bond holders (the new equity holders) will still need EQM.....or if they liquidate the new holders will again, still need EQM/ETRN to move that NG.So EQM survives either way.....but to really prosper they need EQT to survive the fallout from these sub 2 NG prices.As a side note......the MVP will help greatly in that regard as it will close the gap/spread between Henry Hub prices and the Appalachian Basin NG prices (win win for everyone....including end customers)."
What if MVP gets completely rejected and has to stop in it's tracks? Not trying to imply that it will in any way but what do you think the value is per share and future divi prospects are in that scenario. I think there would be costs in removing existing pipe and the remediation but I'm not really certain. I'm just trying to understand what my maximum downside risk is here and don't say it's not possible. Anything is possible and not obtaining final permits is a risk although hopefully it is a very remote risk. What do you guys think? Thanks
buying opportunity?
"AM and AR just made a deal that EQM and EQT should mimic. EQT/ETRN should buy those 50M shares EQT wants to get rid off (spend the 500M and save 100M a year in dividends) , cut them a deal on volume, and both companies will end up stronger.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/antero-midstream-announces-100-million-123000164.html"
Equitrans Midstream is up 4.93% to 9.15
"The combined company will have about 720M shares and generate about 1.8B in FCF once the MVP is done.CAPEX this year, with the MVP will be close to 1.3B, but once that is paid off the distribution coverage will be insane..60 cent X 720 is only 430M. At that rate they'l be able to deleverage (pay off debt) and then the dividend will raise....and rapidly."
"Like to see this make a run to $11-$12 at current fmv, and then $17-$19 when MVP comes online with nice divi."
I Can’t find the news for the huge move up with massive volume. Can anyone explain?
Some good news from the Supreme Court today concerning the MVP. The fact the court agreed to hear the case means about a 99% chance the liberal 4th circuit's decision will get tossed.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-u-supreme-court-hear-135325308.html
"The MVP got some good news today.....although you wouldn't know it looking at the share price. ''The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved Tuesday Mountain Valley Pipeline's request to change crossing methods for nine waterbodies over a conservation group's objections alleging the project is seeking to change conditions of its certificate while circumventing standard review processes.Moreover, FERC said the resources in question are outside areas where MVP voluntarily suspended construction to avoid affecting the candy darter and Roanoke logperch, following a lawsuit filed by environmental groups over species protections. FERC also said the US Army Corps of Engineers confirmed no permits were needed to allow the altered crossings under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, and that the waterbodies and wetland do not come under jurisdiction of Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act.''"
Shorts at work again. The earnings are next week. ETRN will be riding high in a month as its maintenance costs decline. Actually they are already looking better and earninf first and second quarter will be surging.
"Executives at ETRN have to go. They will be 3 years late with MVP at the end of 2021. After spinning their wheels for over two years some genius decides to permit individual stream crossings. They have to go. The Board of Directors need to go for running what was once a shining midstream company into oblivion. Executives make millions a year at ETRN for missing the deadline for completing MVP by at the best 3 years and having the cost of the project dramatically higher than original estimates. And. And if they don't have MVP finished early in 2022, I believe they owe EQT hundreds of millions..... I hate for people to become unemployed but enough is enough. The Board needs sued/fired. The executives need terminated. Three years is too long!"
-15% in two days. Why? I bought more.
I received Nice fat dividend DRIP today and my average is $9.17. WIN WIN !
"Hmm, i thought this would be further out ahead by now. NG, good placement, nice earnings. Debt is of course high, but capex is capex."
EPS is so attractive on this-why is the stock not moving up?
Why MVP must be completed... https://www.ajc.com/news/business/land-fights-public-opposition-left-georgia-reliant-on-one-pipeline/SKHTLMFV7FHGVMQB3OPKGSJMEA/
Bought twice as much at $8.86. I luv these prices.
So you slash the dividend by 66% and the stock hasn’t dropped even more than it has. I’m actually quite surprised. They probably think we won’t notice since the overall market is down so much today. I’m out
"I don't think many really understand just how much the MVP will effect earnings and cash flow for ETRN in the future.....even if it never gets finished.ETRN will earn about 1B, give or take, in 2021....yet have negative cash flow of around 100M (give or take everything included).So how is that a positive...negative cash flow?It's because about 700M of that cash is headed for the MVP.Whether the MVP ever gets finished or not eventually that 700M is dropping to zero.When it does the free cash flow will jump from negative to a positive 600M (give or take).If the MVP gets done....then add another 400M per year in free cash flow to the pot.Dividends at the current pace will pay you 9% today....and it's only about 250M in annual cash to the company.If the MVP never gets finished and the only thing that disappears is the 700M in cost they're spending on it this year....that's over 2X the amount of the annual dividend.Give them 1.1B if it gets done and it's over 4X the current dividend.Now none of this is to say building this pipeline was a smart move in the first place....or the way they've handled trying to get it completed. Both are clearly questionable moves...and then some.But the point is simply is this a good investment today with everything we know......and my answer is yes so I've been buying the last week."
"Poor management. Time for the executive suite to be cleaned - and new management brought in. Honest, competent management. Before the stock goes bankrupt. EQT management is bad but ETRN may the be the least competent of any team I have ever seen. Board, act or face the music."
"This stock will be $20 with a healthy dividend once MVP gets open, there will be obstacles ahead, but I have confidence it will proceed; just need patience. A great buy at these prices. Extremely Bullish"
"One interesting fact is CAPEX for 2020 (this year) is projected at around 1.3B (700M related to MVP) yet maintenance is only set at 55M (once built pipelines don't require much maintenance).So why is that a big deal?It's a big deal because if EQT slows down (or shuts down) production growth (expected to grow 2% in 2020) ETRN/EQM's CAPEX will drop like a rock.Meaning cash flow will take a gigantic leap forward. So the best case scenario going forward is NG prices stay low this year, causing growth in production to slow down or stop across the industry (while demand continues to increase), resulting in large cash flow gains for the midstream companies (less CAPEX). Hopefully they all (including EQM/ETRN) will use that cash flow to reduce debt. With the end result being once NG prices start to move north again (3 dollar range) and production picks up to cover the demand growth (expected for decades into the future) all these midstream companies are in much stronger position (debt wise) to increase their CAPEX."
I'm trying to find information on the debt situation for ETRN.THey appear to owe 7B but earn 1B. I can't find any bonds. Anyone have any idea?

"I believe that the current valuation too low (8.62). Without the MVP resistance, it's worth $12.If and when MVP gets completion/approval then $18 is likely. If they are forced to abandon thenwe'll see $6. In today's environment, it's a buy below $9. Div is well supported at .15/qtr"
"Really liking this as a strong value play with huge growth potential once MVP gets online. Combining EQM is going to be great for the long haul, new dividend is very manageable, and stock price should double once the economy begins to rebound after Covid."
"Just remember, If you own this company, it has contracts for the next 15 years and according to EPA forecast, natural gas is going up next few quarters and beyond. Good luck to all Longs""EIA forecasts that prices will rise in the second quarter of 2020, as U.S. natural gas production declines and natural gas use for power generation increases the demand for gas. EIA expects prices to average $2.36/MMBtu in the third quarter of 2020. EIA forecasts that Henry Hub natural gas spot prices will average $2.21/MMBtu in 2020. EIA expects that natural gas prices will then increase in 2021, reaching an annual average of $2.53/MMBtu."""
