Would expect a transaction of the remaining EQT holdings of ETRN shares relatively soon...Well above the current level imo ....
Q3 2020 Highlights:Delivered third quarter 2020 results ahead of guidanceGenerated $168 million of net income and achieved $282 million of adjusted EBITDARecorded 68% of total operating revenue from firm reservation feesRaised full-year 2020 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance
Bought twice as much at $8.86. I luv these prices.
"The MVP got some good news today.....although you wouldn't know it looking at the share price. ''The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved Tuesday Mountain Valley Pipeline's request to change crossing methods for nine waterbodies over a conservation group's objections alleging the project is seeking to change conditions of its certificate while circumventing standard review processes.Moreover, FERC said the resources in question are outside areas where MVP voluntarily suspended construction to avoid affecting the candy darter and Roanoke logperch, following a lawsuit filed by environmental groups over species protections. FERC also said the US Army Corps of Engineers confirmed no permits were needed to allow the altered crossings under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, and that the waterbodies and wetland do not come under jurisdiction of Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act.''"
Virginia DEQ just said it will take at least another year to process all the water permits for MVP.
about time to take profit?
"For those that don't know how this will play out....it's simple from this price level.If EQT survives in it's present form (no BK or reorganization) ETRN will thrive....regardless of whether the MVP gets delayed again.EQT, with a 25% headcount reduction, hedges. lower drilling costs and recent bond action (moving debt outward) are set for at least the next two years of low NG prices (but really set up for one at sub 2).The question is if NG prices stay sub 2 for the next two years....then what? A BK at EQT will mean 74% of EQM/ETRN's revenue is at risk (not lost.....just up for renegotiation since in BK all contracts are tossed out).Even then the bond holders (the new equity holders) will still need EQM.....or if they liquidate the new holders will again, still need EQM/ETRN to move that NG.So EQM survives either way.....but to really prosper they need EQT to survive the fallout from these sub 2 NG prices.As a side note......the MVP will help greatly in that regard as it will close the gap/spread between Henry Hub prices and the Appalachian Basin NG prices (win win for everyone....including end customers)."
"Earnings release on 11/3. Why 11/3? Is another event on the horizon that day? Maybe something that will take our attention away from a bad report? I am always wrong, please don’t let this be the exception. Could they be telling us that after missing TWO years of completion dates on MVP, senior management will be taking millions in bonuses and oops, announce MVP will be another “ little longer” before completion. Or oops, earnings aren’t as good as expected? No worries mates, I am always wrong as I really thought stock holders would hold management accountable for missing their in service date by more than two years. Two years. If you earn a million dollars a year, this can’t be excused. Bet these same personnel get mad as heck when an employer earning $7.25 is five minutes late getting them their pumpkin latte. Hold people accountable - no excuses."
"Don't really understand this market but it appear someone wants out of EQM and doesn't care what the price difference is to ETRN.''ETRN to acquire all outstanding public EQM common units in a 100% share-for-unit transaction, approved by the EQM Conflicts Committee, in which each outstanding public common unit of EQM would be exchanged for 2.44 shares of ETRN common stock''ETRN is at 4.75 X 2.44 = 11.59EQM is down 18% right now to 9.38.Just looks to me like a large holder wants out and could care less about the exchange rate."
is 6.00 a good buy
The major midstream companies stock price is stable or increasing and ETRN continues to slide...inability to secure NWP 12 will decimate this company.
"Can someone explain the differences between EQM and ETRN, and which is likely to be the more compelling investment moving forward from a risk/ return perspective. Thanks."
Wait for 30% dividend haha
Headed to $6. Glad I am shorting. Bounces are falling flat.
%18.85 dividend!
Good to see the insider buying at a higher level...gives confidence the offers for etrn is north of 16
Some good news from the Supreme Court today concerning the MVP. The fact the court agreed to hear the case means about a 99% chance the liberal 4th circuit's decision will get tossed.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-u-supreme-court-hear-135325308.html
Buy and hold through dividend date. Make almost 4%. Then sale or enjoy the dividends and hold. I love me some dividends.
Looks like it’s going to 10. But I’ll stay in SXOOF. 15x coming fast. Do some research I promise you won’t be disappointed
"I’m in several other midstreams that not unexpectedly cut their dividends, but you guys really got screwed in this deal. I almost bought back in March, glad I didn’t. Good luck to all."
"ETRN is trying a last ditch effort to salvage the doomed MVP permit process by abandoning their delusional, greedy hopes that NWP-12 could be a one stop, easy path to permitting. Now they have a massive uphill climb going stream by stream which will substantially increase the time & expenditures before MVP can even begin digging. At the very least, ETRN is completely lacking in candor when they tell investors that MVP will be completed this year, or when they try to put on airs that they haven't been thoroughly mismanaged by amateurs that thought they could sell a pig in a poke."
"AM and AR just made a deal that EQM and EQT should mimic. EQT/ETRN should buy those 50M shares EQT wants to get rid off (spend the 500M and save 100M a year in dividends) , cut them a deal on volume, and both companies will end up stronger.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/antero-midstream-announces-100-million-123000164.html"
Took out some stop losses is the reason for big drop in first hour. Selling on ex-div date? You have to crazy.
Pretty good read concerning EQM/ETRN and the MVP indirectly: https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-1587/109667/20190729162149372_Cowpasture%20-%20Brief%20of%20WV%20and%2015%20Other%20States.pdf
"Wonder if they would consider buying back the shares from eqt, would reduce there required div going forward and feel it’s a good market value do do this at these prices."
I will stay until $10.75 and then bail if price doesn't hold
"One interesting fact is CAPEX for 2020 (this year) is projected at around 1.3B (700M related to MVP) yet maintenance is only set at 55M (once built pipelines don't require much maintenance).So why is that a big deal?It's a big deal because if EQT slows down (or shuts down) production growth (expected to grow 2% in 2020) ETRN/EQM's CAPEX will drop like a rock.Meaning cash flow will take a gigantic leap forward. So the best case scenario going forward is NG prices stay low this year, causing growth in production to slow down or stop across the industry (while demand continues to increase), resulting in large cash flow gains for the midstream companies (less CAPEX). Hopefully they all (including EQM/ETRN) will use that cash flow to reduce debt. With the end result being once NG prices start to move north again (3 dollar range) and production picks up to cover the demand growth (expected for decades into the future) all these midstream companies are in much stronger position (debt wise) to increase their CAPEX."
"""Our third quarter results demonstrate our ability to generate predictable and stable revenue in any type of operating environment,"" said Thomas F. Karam, ETRN chairman and chief executive officer. ""The transformative actions that we took earlier in the year have allowed us to focus on controlling costs and efficiently deploying capital, which ultimately enables us to strengthen our balance sheet and generate substantial free cash flow.""""Our results also reflect the benefits we are realizing as a result of the new gathering agreement executed earlier this year,"" said Diana M. Charletta, ETRN president and chief operating officer. ""This new agreement allows us to optimize our assets by eliminating redundancies, scheduling efficient construction plans, and safely streamlining operations, all of which lead to meaningful capital reductions."""
"I think they made some smart moves. The run up in EQT reflect some financial relief they are getting, not necessarily that they got the better deal."
Slight move up. Increased share count traded. Is there room for hope? Executives heading for the door? Stay tuned..... someday excuses won’t be accepted and the c suite gang will be held accountable allowing the stock price to move up.
"I believe that the current valuation is correct (9.65). Without the MVP resistance, it's worth $12.If and when MVP gets completion/approval then $18 is likely. If they are forced to abandon then we'll see $6. In today's environment, it's a buy below $9."
Dividend coming up on 18% and will be cut big 2000% payout
Equitrans Midstream is up 5.58% to 8.70
"You know, EQT is acting mighty strong in this market, a good sign for ETRN. Lower oil prices likely mean better outlook for natural gas supply and demand. Good luck to all Longs"
Shares should average out at about $12 when all is said and done...
"EQT appears to be going all in trying to get an investment grade for rating it's debt.They suspended their dividend today while previously they've cut 25% of their workforce, cut a deal with ETRN to lower their midstream costs, cut drilling cost north of 20% , raised about 1.5B in bonds to pay off debt due the next two years and are considering selling even more assets to lower their debt to less than 2X.For ETRN to prosper EQT (which is about 75% of their revenue) needs to survive....and by all appearances that's what they are going to do.The recent drop in oil prices, while it caused ETRN's share price to crater even further, is actually good news the way i see it. All those wells producing oil that bring up NG as a by product will be shut down very rapidly if oil stays anywhere near 20 dollars. This appear to me, by all indications, setting up late 2020 for a rapid recovery in the price of NG.....if demand returns sometime this summer and does not drag out until next year.Since EQT is about 85% hedged in NG for 2020 they can survive just fine with low NG prices this year....it actually benefits them as those not hedged will be cutting back at these price levels.The MVP completion is just a bonus to the low share price at this point....not priced in at any level."
Looks like MVP will not be completed in 2020. This is will hurt stock price. MVP will never be completed if Biden and AOC win in November.
Highest call to put ratio on options market call to put activityDirector added shares @ $12.25That's a +25% upside from here
Earnings now 2 weeks out and drops after hours today. The drop for any anticipated shortfall is way overdone. ETRN now just $3 from EQT share price which has surged almost 10 % and ETRN down 14%. ETRN's price is an oversold position that you have to buy now. It should be sitting at $11. ETRN will move up quick with little notice.
So why is this +5% on heavy volume.
Does holding this company trigger a K-1 or is it a regular 1099 for the dividends? Does anyone know?
why the push?
NC DEQ just rejected the Southgate extension for the second time. Additional permit denials on the near term horizon.
"I don't think many really understand just how much the MVP will effect earnings and cash flow for ETRN in the future.....even if it never gets finished.ETRN will earn about 1B, give or take, in 2021....yet have negative cash flow of around 100M (give or take everything included).So how is that a positive...negative cash flow?It's because about 700M of that cash is headed for the MVP.Whether the MVP ever gets finished or not eventually that 700M is dropping to zero.When it does the free cash flow will jump from negative to a positive 600M (give or take).If the MVP gets done....then add another 400M per year in free cash flow to the pot.Dividends at the current pace will pay you 9% today....and it's only about 250M in annual cash to the company.If the MVP never gets finished and the only thing that disappears is the 700M in cost they're spending on it this year....that's over 2X the amount of the annual dividend.Give them 1.1B if it gets done and it's over 4X the current dividend.Now none of this is to say building this pipeline was a smart move in the first place....or the way they've handled trying to get it completed. Both are clearly questionable moves...and then some.But the point is simply is this a good investment today with everything we know......and my answer is yes so I've been buying the last week."

"Poor management. Time for the executive suite to be cleaned - and new management brought in. Honest, competent management. Before the stock goes bankrupt. EQT management is bad but ETRN may the be the least competent of any team I have ever seen. Board, act or face the music."

Confirmed the Dividend until MVC completed..
"MVP is toast, It isn't completely necessary but quite a hit never the less"
Gte a steal at this price with plenty of cash
Why no earnings report ?
"I'm guessing this would be between $22 and $23 when it opens on Monday as ""ETRN which would pay @8% Dividend and then grow towards 10% in the coming months."
"MVP was to be finished fourth quarter 2018. Quit rewarding personnel for missing deadlines. Hard, drop dead deadlines. Clean house from the top down. Senior officials have to be accountable. Rewarding personnel for these blunders with promotions is asinine. Tired of hearing them stumble all over water operations. Recycle 95% of your impaired water - has to be your main driver. The key is adequate storage until you are ready to use it in completions operations. Just tired of rewarding incompetence. Easy to blame environmentalists but competent executives would be two steps ahead. Is why they are paid seven figures."
I'd like to see a commensurate pay cut management to the dividend cut. They are NOT doing their job.
is ETRN a MLP
These prices represent an extreme underestimation of the value of this company. What an opportunity for those with some extra cash to invest! Going up from here rapidly...
any opinions on this stock?
"Quick question, I saw they still have 800m to spend on capex until MVP comes online and looks to me like they are paying out most of their income on the dividend. With only about $500m current assets and about the same on current liabilities, where is the money going to come from? Have they mentioned their source of funding in the past? I would think they would need to borrow it."
ETRN is experts at losing money. How did they run this into the ground
Why keep dropping? Is this company going BK?
"This stock will be $20 with a healthy dividend once MVP gets open, there will be obstacles ahead, but I have confidence it will proceed; just need patience. A great buy at these prices. Extremely Bullish"
As they shut down fracking natural gas production drops significantly! Your assumption is correct! They can’t just snap their fingers and start it back up! Consumption will continue to increase! Not thrilled about the merger but I think you are at the bottom! Should slowly go up from here until their is a shortage
what is the conversion factor in this merger?
ETRN is down 4.98% to 14.59
"Obviously those that claim the MVP project has been bungled by Equitrans Midstream Corp. have never studied the projects history. Almost 7% dividend plus a some growth, what do you want? This is income, not a home run stock"
thank you Jordan
"I'll stay away from these NG, drilling stocks. Despite the lofty dividend. Better plays out there."
Equitrans Midstream is up 13.47% to 10.11
Can't wait for $3 then the dividend will be over 20%. Buy all you can.
Still___ no earnings report ?

This stock is an excellent buy.
In early August some insiders Including the Chairman and CEO bought at $16 and change. So far they're in the red but I'm guessing they have better quality info than I..
"ETRN was trading for 19 dollars when Rice took over at EQT and started talking about renegotiating contracts with EQM/ETRN.The share price tanked after that down to it's current levels even though the CEO has been buying and estimates for the next two quarters haven't budged....although they are down 10% for next year.This is from the EQT C.C. the other day regarding the negotiations. It appears to me to be a win win scenario for each party....EQT getting relief from current contracts when the MVP kicks in (and EQM's EBITDA will jump 300M a year) in return signing contracts for future expansion when it comes to pass in W.Virginia. EQM/ETRN needs EQT to survive and prosper but also needs to look after it's own shareholder's interests (EQT own 30% of EQM, not 51%).Odds are the new contracts, when signed, will keep rates current until the MVP kicks in a large amount of EBITDA (meaning next year's estimates will move back up) and then provide for future gains when NG prices allow EQT to expand production again (and stay a healthy company in the meantime).''Over the last couple of weeks we have made good progress with the Equitrans team towards a solution that we believe would be a win-win for both parties. In exchange for gathering fee relief the timing of fee relief will likely be tied to the in-service date of Mountain Valley Pipeline, a project that including other related projects is expected to add over $300 million of EBITDA for Equitrans upon going in service.Second, EQT can offer an extension of the contract term and a substantial increase in the minimum volume commitments to provide long term cash flow certainty for Equitrans shareholders.Lastly, EQT can dedicate the remainder of its undedicated West Virginia acreage position to Equitrans. As we have highlighted before, West Virginia will become a larger part of EQT story going forward. Our recent success in extending laterals, executing acreage swaps and lowering well costs show this area is competing for capital. I'm encouraged by the progress we have made and both sides are working diligently to have an agreement in place in the next few months.''"
"“Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have not experienced any material disruptions to our operations and have worked toensure that the safety of our employees, contractors, families, and communities remains our top priority,” added Diana Charletta, ETRNpresident and chief operating officer. “As a result of the recent increase in natural gas strip prices, our producer customers are becomingstronger and we are optimistic that the activity level across our operating areas will remain steady. As we progress through the year, wewill continue collaborating with our customers in order to optimize future development plans and maintain our acute focus on capitalefficiency.”"
WOW !!! Did they ever GUT the dividend...
How many fractional shares of EQM does each share of etrn have?
Is this a good buy right now or not?
ETRN reached an all time low at 9.07
I clearly am lousy at calling bottoms.
"if aoc is in charge of energy under biden , we are done....she will shut this whole thing down"

"There have been some honest responses. They want more money. The reality is people use ""environmental"" reasons for fighting projects like when their real problem is that they aren't getting paid what they want or they only see through their eyes. Benjamin Franklin was aware of this issue and gave the government the authority of emminent domain. I've seen environmental issues brought up to fight nuclear generation (remember the move ""China Syndrome""), on wind farms they use noise, flicker etc., on solar they use land consumption, electrical issues etc., on water power they used fish. I've been involved in easement from acquisition and selling sides and I know from personal experience many don't even consider they've bargained until they go to court. Those are the people ETRN is dealing with now."
Very good reaction

"When s team loses 15 games/matches in a row, the entire team can’t be fired. So the coach/manager/GM/President has to go. Greater than three years late on a project and the price doubling is a 33 game losing streak. Stock down 75% is a 40 game losing streak. Culpability for hundreds of millions in charges for missing MVP deadline - 25 game losing streak. Missing earnings estimates and reducing dividends - 50 game game losing streak. The Board has to be aware they can be sued for negligence in allowing the executive team at ETRN to continue to earn millions as they destroy this company. New leadership today! We deserve it."
ETRN announce your distribution amount for the fourth quarter.
How much is the dividend? Coverage and leverage? Thanks
Equitrans Midstream is up 4.93% to 9.15
This is quite possibly the saddest board on Yahoo.
What a train wreck.
I received Nice fat dividend DRIP today and my average is $9.17. WIN WIN !
"More than two years late completing MVP. Billions in cost overruns. I offer instead of saying when MVP is in service, we should use “if” MVP is ever finished. Perhaps they can use the partially finished line to get water to the coal fields of Appalachia whose fresh water sources have been poisoned by coal mining and oil/gas wells with no fresh water protection casing/cement. Tell me another company that has fouled up such a major project as MVP and the executives remain employed. Executives have to be held accountable. Delay after delay isn’t acceptable in any business. We fire college coaches for much less. Had a CEO once who said, “I’ll coach, coach but if that doesn’t work I’ll change course”. Paraphrasing there. But it’s past time to coach - we deserve change."
Management GUTTED the shareholders...
The good news today was EQT was up 10.14% and ETRN-EQM have long solid contracts with EQT. So EQT being strong is great news and ETRN-EQM will eventually follow. Good luck to all Longs
Not liking the trend these days.
"looks like we are finally getting some positive movement here. Would be great to continue the momentum, get the MVP active, and this puppy should be north of $20."

Ubs ups ETRN to buy...per Merrill website.
we will get the real update on the earnings call
Equitrans Midstream is up 7.15% to 8.39
"Have no idea why the tank job after earnings when the miss was due to a one time write off at EQM.It was goodwill based related to other pipelines they bought last year....before NG tanked pipeline prices.''ETRN and EQM net loss for the third quarter 2019 was impacted by a $298.7 million impairment charge to goodwill and net intangible assets. ETRN also incurred a $6.8 million impairment charge to deferred taxes related to the goodwill write-down. The impairments were primarily driven by lower forecast natural gas production growth behind the Rice Midstream Partners LP (RMP) gathering assets, which EQM acquired in July 2018, and the Eureka Midstream Holdings, LLC (Eureka) and Hornet Midstream Holdings, LLC (Hornet) gathering assets. EQM acquired 60% of Eureka and 100% of Hornet in April 2019.''EQM has dropped about 3B in market cap (about 15 dollars a share) in the that time so the write off seems reasonable.But the rest looks good to me. This just need to get the MVP finished for EBITDA to jump 30%.''EBITDA was $335.0 million; net cash provided by operating activities was $234.6 million; and distributable cash flow was $234.2 million. ''"
"Just remember, If you own this company, it has contracts for the next 15 years and according to EPA forecast, natural gas is going up next few quarters and beyond.

EIA expects prices to average $2.36/MMBtu in the third quarter of 2020. EIA forecasts that Henry Hub natural gas spot prices will average $2.21/MMBtu in 2020. EIA expects that natural gas prices will then increase in 2021, reaching an annual average of $2.53/MMBtu."""
"I'm a EQM unit holder. Not particularly happy about the price/ratio since it is a big discount to where I bought about 6 months ago. This looks a lot like Kinder Morgan of a few years ago when they simplified their structure. Yes, a big haircut on the divvy now but in about a year and a half they should be able to substantially increase it...if everything holds together and their numbers/forecasts are good. This will take time to digest and work thru. GLA"
Here comes the rally
This is beyond painful. When does it stop?
"I feel that if people are going to be working from home all Spring and Summer, then they will be using more gas and electricity to keep their homes comfortable. ETRN will continue to deliver the gas."
Can't believe this held up so nicely on such a down day! Can we call this the bottom? Maybe? Hopefully?
"Here is a paragraph from a ZACKs report that came out today. Looks like next earnings release is looking good. Good luck to all Longs""ETRN will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.40, up 60% from the prior-year quarter.

This will be a SDC type story. This is when you get in

"Like to see this make a run to $11-$12 at current fmv, and then $17-$19 when MVP comes online with nice divi."
What if MVP gets completely rejected and has to stop in it's tracks? Not trying to imply that it will in any way but what do you think the value is per share and future divi prospects are in that scenario. I think there would be costs in removing existing pipe and the remediation but I'm not really certain. I'm just trying to understand what my maximum downside risk is here and don't say it's not possible. Anything is possible and not obtaining final permits is a risk although hopefully it is a very remote risk. What do you guys think? Thanks
"I don't understand what's going on with this stock. They announce a distribution of .45 per share. Yesterday I buy 2800 shares at 14.14 and buy the close it's down to $12.92, now today after a brief rally it's down to $12.88. Why is everybody selling prior to the Ex-Dividend date???"
I Can’t find the news for the huge move up with massive volume. Can anyone explain?
"ETRN finally, reluctantly & sheepishly admitted that MVP may not enter service until at least summer 2022."
"Wow, whoever bought this in the 10's really lucked out... but plenty of upside is still there, and with this kind of momentum..."
"idk why my comment keeps getting deleted - yahoo board bearinsh ETRN? So, the div-lovers have sold, and if they bought for the 18%, why wouldn't they. The drop is on par with what's going on with the market, and it can bounce back to 9 just as quickly, cuz the news is good for the company. It wаsn't healthy to keep the huge payout. And ETRN is now no less attractive, just in another way. This isn't necessarily permanent either, they can increase again in a periоd pf time. Eаrnings beat badly, the buybаck - it's all great news, there's nоthing bad here."
's tough to figure where the bottom is. here.
"I'm new here. I like to know what caused ETRN price to drop to less than half of its value. Is it the decline in oil price, the corona virus or something else?"
"EQT is rumored to be working on a 1B royalty deal. My guess is they have gone to plan B (plan A was selling their 20% stake in ETRN) to raise cash/lower debt. This is a smart move by them as dumping ETRN at fire-sale prices, and losing 90M a year in free cash flow (dividends), would have been a really dumb short term move. Their C.C. coming up in a couple weeks should prove very interesting.....but the bottom line is they do this deal (similar to what AR did to raise cash) it's a big win for ETRN (the more stable EQT is the better for EQM/ETRN)."
Collect the $1.80 until year end 2020 and then probably a modest bump.
Short squeeze.
"Really liking this as a strong value play with huge growth potential once MVP gets online. Combining EQM is going to be great for the long haul, new dividend is very manageable, and stock price should double once the economy begins to rebound after Covid."
ETRN is down 4.94% to 13.85
ETRN is down 5.24% to 17.00
Presentation says between 8 and 10%. I have asked if a partial dividend will be paid to owners for the fourth quarter. I haven’t heard a response.
Has ETRN officially stated their dividend rate for 2019?

"Bought 233,394 shares today."
So you slash the dividend by 66% and the stock hasn’t dropped even more than it has. I’m actually quite surprised. They probably think we won’t notice since the overall market is down so much today. I’m out
Someone paid up for 60 $15 calls....April expiration.
EPS is so attractive on this-why is the stock not moving up?
UBS initiated coverage of ETRN at 15 dollars on Aug 6th.That's the low of the 11 analysts that now follow the company.The average is around 21.Like always.....analysts are a trailing indicator of a share price. In the meantime the CEO was busy buying 200K shares at 16.11 last week.
why the sell-of?
Anyone know what the MVP impact is if supreme court rules that no pipeline can cross Appalachian trail? Can they reroute or have to file bankrupt?
More execs selling and heading for the dooor as ETRN burns down. No cash to keep paying dividends
Looks like this puppy is heading for the moon! :D

-15% in two days. Why? I bought more.
how could they have such a disagreement with eqt.....what a mess
buying opportunity?
I just bought in here . The dividend is aggressive and I think MLP's have been overly sold.
"What is a low but good enough Natural Gas price for both EQT and ETRN to survive? I know they are hedged for 2020. However if NG prices continue to be in $2 range through 2021, what will their prospects be?I read about the inverse price action of NG vs Oil. I.e. if Oil drops really low (which it already has in the $20 range) A lot of the oil companies in the US are going to cut back or just go BK. Natural Gas is also a by product of some these Oil extraction companies. So if they cut back on Oil, supply of Natural Gas also reduces. So hopefully that should help NG prices in the future.If somebody has more context of NG and Oil co-relation, please share. THanks!"
"Earnings good, outlook great and below link for dividend cut. My average is now $8.54https://seekingalpha.com/news/3546471-equitrans-to-simplify-structure-gets-15-year-gas-gathering-deal-eqt"
Equitrans Midstream reached a 52 Week high at 11.35
Now that's a recovery! Hope we can see 3 or 4 more days of this.
"Executives at ETRN have to go. They will be 3 years late with MVP at the end of 2021. After spinning their wheels for over two years some genius decides to permit individual stream crossings. They have to go. The Board of Directors need to go for running what was once a shining midstream company into oblivion. Executives make millions a year at ETRN for missing the deadline for completing MVP by at the best 3 years and having the cost of the project dramatically higher than original estimates. And. And if they don't have MVP finished early in 2022, I believe they owe EQT hundreds of millions..... I hate for people to become unemployed but enough is enough. The Board needs sued/fired. The executives need terminated. Three years is too long!"
Bankruptcy Time!
"Because MVP currently lacks required stream-crossing and water protection permits, it would also be subject to the moratorium requested by the Virginia Council on Environmental Justice, said council member Tom Benevento."
"Hmm, i thought this would be further out ahead by now. NG, good placement, nice earnings. Debt is of course high, but capex is capex."
I don't if anyone else if playing the trading game with ETRN and EQM but I can't help myself.The two companies are joined at the hip yet ETRN is down double what EQM is in the last month.A month ago EQM hit 45 (down about 10%) while ETRN hit 21 (down about 20%). Now the dividend/distribution is still not equal (about 11% for EQM and 10.25% for ETRN) but it's close.And ETRN is a straight 1099 dividend while EQM is a K1 distribution. I think 2% difference was the normal play between the two.If ETRN moves back to 21 and EQM runs to 45 I'll probably move back to EQM again.No clue why they are moving like this.....anyone have an idea?
"The combined company will have about 720M shares and generate about 1.8B in FCF once the MVP is done.CAPEX this year, with the MVP will be close to 1.3B, but once that is paid off the distribution coverage will be insane..60 cent X 720 is only 430M. At that rate they'l be able to deleverage (pay off debt) and then the dividend will raise....and rapidly."
A lot of ETRN holder sold and went to CNXM which bounced from 10.70 to $11.70 on FRIday 28 FEB 2020
"I believe that the current valuation too low (8.62). Without the MVP resistance, it's worth $12.If and when MVP gets completion/approval then $18 is likely. If they are forced to abandon thenwe'll see $6. In today's environment, it's a buy below $9. Div is well supported at .15/qtr"
"Two months ago when NG was trading for around 2.45 BTU while ETRN was trading for around 20.NG tanked to around 2.05 and ETRN tanked to the middle 12's.NG today hit 2.36 BTU while ETRN, with the CEO buying shares at 16, sits at it's low.Go figure."
It’s a good $15 stock and a great $20 stock
Time to buy ETRN on sale?
$9.16 is my average. My last buy was at $8.86. New people are buying at a steal
I noticed that the board of directors get paid very well.
Another 52 week low lol. People buying this get a free bowl of soup.
At this rate ETRN will be in the $1's in 6 weeks If not where is the bottom?
"Like Obama, I think Biden understands the benefits of responsible development of natural gas."
Cog sold pipelines from Marcellus to the southeast for 13.4x ebitda..good read thru for the value of ETRN
Shorts at work again. The earnings are next week. ETRN will be riding high in a month as its maintenance costs decline. Actually they are already looking better and earninf first and second quarter will be surging.
Anyone loading at these levels?
