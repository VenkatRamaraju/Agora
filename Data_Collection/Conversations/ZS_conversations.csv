"My only ZS concern re their quarterly AH stock price is that it’s had almost a 37% increase in price since last quarterly earnings report.If you’ve extending your long, it might make sense to stall your purchase a cupla trading days.GLTA,paul"
Earnings leaked. Stock going higher.
"ZS trading at 19 times F2019 revs,of $250mm. Thats high, but where else are you going to find sustainable 30%+ revenue growth from a free cash flow positive company? I hope this pulls back to the $37-38 area so I can get long again."
"Trayes, I use calls and puts and use a chart to day trade I don't keep any one position I ride the stock both ways using an indicator chart to sell and buy puts and calls and make money. Today I used the technique to make an easy 16,000 on LULU. Using calls and puts, but this may be too much info for you're small mind"
"In addition to major accumulation, a short squeeze is underway this morning. There are a huge number of shares sold short."
Non-GAAP net income per share was $0.14. The street was expecting .09. Looks like a beat on earnings and revenue.
Zacks Investment Research reports that the 2021 Price to Earnings ratio for ZS is NEGATIVE-206.37!!!! vs. an industry ratio of -43.70.
why is it even going down? I wasn't expecting this from the vaccine or election news. nonethless long and strong but curious
"Brother Liam. Is it true that you were short LULU? Oh my man. Wait until stocks are trading underneath the mid and long term moving averages before you short. In fact, shorting in this type of market is unwise. But its your money. Have a great evening."
"100,000,000,000 transactions per day! Zscaler stands for Zenith of Scalability. This marvelous engineering feat demonstrates the lengths to which Zscaler will go to in order to ensure our customers’ successful and secure digital transformation. We founded Zscaler more than ten years ago on our belief that organizations would need to entirely rethink security as employees increasingly worked remotely and as the number of devices and applications exploded. We developed Zscaler cloud security platform from the ground up, from day one, to be the Zenith of Scalability so we could protect any enterprise no matter the number of people, devices, applications or size of data. We are now securing 100 billion transactions per day across more than 4,000 enterprises including over 400 of the Global 2000 brands. This is a milestone meant for our customers but one made possible by our employees as well. Thank you to every person at Zscaler, past and present, who was part of making this possible. Now, time to work towards 1 trillion.CEO Jay Chaudhry"
You guys will have to see for yourself tomorrow
Level II showing no buy support for $ZS...stock currently being propped by automated algos...
"Interesting to see that the S&P 500 and DJIA both closed down 3% today, but ZS manages to close up 8%. It just makes you wonder what the potential will be when the markets normalize, and more Investors start buying ZS becuase they realize that ZS is a company that helps people work from home and provide a Security Gateway to all of their networks and apps. I can only imagine the $$$ that lay ahead. Stay Long my Friends!!"
"I hate to tell everyone, BUT this won't be up to anyone except hedge funds and big boys on Wall Street and the word is, ZS is oversold and has been artificially pumped for 2 months and big boys can't make money on the stock unless they sell it off and then pump back up. It's just the way it is, nothing personal longs"
Up $8 already AH
people are getting out of this market
"If Coronavirus is going to be around for a while, then Zscaler sell Zscaler Private Acess (ZPA which is remote VPN) - and if more people will need to work from home, existing Zscaler customers will consider purchasing ZPA. This is a great Market opportunity for Zscaler with the fears around COVD19."
"Plus, as I said, I’m not selling until I make my money back, don’t care how long it takes, that’s why it’s called investing"
"What is your take on the 2020 outlook for the US market, given the escalating coronavirus situation and huge financial investments by the government? Talks about another crash - what is the expected impact on stocks like ZS? I think ZS continues to be a key solution for the future and in remote working, etc. however in terms of stock value is there significant ground for further growth in 2020 from where it is now (61 USD range)?"

Why the big move up today? Could be the breakout Cameron was looking for....
Looks like we are retesting the low from yesterday which is not a bad thing from a technical standpoint. Just give this more time. It was a good earnings call and growth is still very strong. Guidance is always conservative and ZS will beat it again.
SALESFORCE moving its CLOUD TO MSFT AZURE....guess who does security for Azure?
I bought more at 42.05. I think this is a great company. The slightest positive news will have a significant impact. Soon IMHO.
"He said Zscaler is the “best pure play” in cloud security.“While the valuation is lofty and the stock will continue to grow into its multiple over the coming years in our opinion, we believe seeing the forest through the trees that ZS could double its market opportunity over the next three years from where it sits today, and in the near term, deliver results which justify a stock meaningfully higher as operating margin leverage and further multiple expansion take hold,” he wrote.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wedbush-names-best-pure-play-154321207.html"
"HOT OFF THE PRESS!!!Cloud Security Players to Benefit From Move to Cloud in 2020 After Amazon, Azure Enterprise Cloud Success, Says Wedbush12:28 PM EST, 01/07/2020 (MT Newswires) --Cloud security players are likely next in line to benefit from the move to cloud in 2020 following the success of Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) Azure with their enterprise cloud initiatives, according to Wedbush analysts.Wedbush said it believes ""the next build out of the cloud is translating into strong deal flow for cyber security players in 4Q as our checks saw cloud cyber deals up 35% year over year in the field with the financial and health care verticals particularly robust,"" according to a note to clients Tuesday.Security vendors such as Zscaler (ZS), CyberArk (CYBR), Qualys (QLYS), Rapid7 (RPD), SailPoint (SAIL), and Tenable (TENB) are among those who stand to benefit the most from the shift to cloud, the firm said.Wedbush said Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is a major X variable, with the cloud vision and product portfolio to fully monetize the move among customers.The move to cloud is ""putting major fuel in the engines of the cyber security sector,"" which could eventually lead to a surge of M&A deals by both cloud and tech investors as well as financial buyers in 2020.The firm sees a $60 billion dollar growth opportunity in cloud security ""up for grabs"" over the next five years for ""vendors that have the solution sets to protect critical cloud deployments and seamlessly work with on premise and public/hybrid workloads through a unified and deep solution set.""Also being forecasted for 2020 are ""a number of seven- and eight-figure federal opportunities"" initiated by the JEDI and other big government cloud deals.The cyber security sector is expected to have a strong Q4 earnings as majority of vendors are on track to report healthy top-line and bookings upside, with Fortinet and Varonis believed to be among the clear standouts, both of which are seen to be building larger deal momentum going into 2020."

The analyst expects upside of at least 8% -10%, which would imply revenue of $191M, or 52% year-over-year growth.

MSFT beats big time thanks to cloud. And guess who is providing security for MSFT clouds! All time high coming soon here
They need to change the earnings date. The market always does this.
"Analyst Ives said the ""party is just getting started"" for ZS..."
"MSFT just won the $10B Jedi Contract for the US Federal Government. ZS is the only Fed Ramp Certified Cloud cyber security play, which fully integrates into MSFT Azure. Monday is going to be a great day!!!"
There is no way ZS stock should be trading higher than CRWD. In every category CRWD metrics are better.
September correction?
I guess ZS is eating Symantec's lunch; that's what this breakout on high volume tells me. Earnings should be great.
"Okta trading down after announcing earnings (losses) and Zscaler trading up in after hours. You would think that ZS would trade down to in sympathy with Okta. But I guess the Street is realizing that Zscaler is pulling away and winning the battle for cloud security. Also Okta has not filled its CFO position. So without a person in charge of the finances, Okta is a ship without a captain. Okta tech can be great but without someone in charge and responsible for fiscal responsibility, it can't manage the finances which is what investors want to see. I think this propels Zscaler to new highs this week."
"Just listened to the conference call, it was great, after hours action was total head fake, we’ll be fine tomorrow and this is definitely a long term winner."
tomorrow big money here may be 290 to 300 after market today
"Big Sell off, wait for the correction"
I am looking forward to the 40 points correction around the earnings report date . . . The market is due for correction anyway.

"Beat the top and bottom and a decent guidance, problem is the stock has already run up some 30% from July, and all the good news are backed in, so not sure how much further it can go! I will take a position somewhere in $265-$270 range."
"Liam, for someone that knows everything, you are wrong with your assumptions on what this should go up or down tomorrow based on earnings. Now. I was up very nicely so i took 25 percent off the top and am very comfortable keeping this as one of my holdings. Cheers."
Short covering will run this stock up in the coming week. This thing is climbing like a homesick angel.
I'm expecting large growth and EPS to be mid because of reinvestment for growth.
Does not compute why ZS stock higher than CRWD!!!
Credit Suisse raises its Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) target from $55 to the Street-high $75 citing growing conviction in the long-term growth with no real competition.Rating maintained at Outperform.ZS shares are up 2.4% pre-market to $65.
"PANW just blew out their numbers for Q3, and the stock is up 5% in after-hours trading. I expect ZS to do the same next weekend. Both companies are capitalizing on COVID19 trends"
Losing week for the market. I guess this is on par.

"The Stocks, Forex, and dividends market is constantly evolving with new features, market fluctuations, trading opportunities. You can make great profits fast but trading without experience and the right strategy for the particular market you can lose them even faster. Another thing is your risk management plan. Even if your winning system and trading psychology are good, a lack of risk management skills will make you give back all your profits at some point. That's why it's always advisable to work with a professional and registered trader, I work with Mr Harris who has taught me how to capitalize on the stock market trends and her trading signals and strategies have actually proven to bring out the best results with her knowledge and experience from stock trading, I'm always grateful because it has actually been helpful to me financially. So far I have made reasonable profits learning how to trade better through him. I recommend him, don't forget that as some are losing in the financial market, others are capitalizing and winning.Te*le*gr*am>>>>>Harrisgibson"
"When so many people say the stock will go down, it eventually jumps."
"By now, you already know that cloud computing is a really big deal.More than a quarter of a trillion dollars will be spent on public cloud services in 2019, and they'll account for a third of global businesses' overall IT budgets. Researchers believe that nearly half of all corporate workloads ran on various cloud services in 2017. But that will increase to 55% in 2019, and 94% by 2021. In other words, nearly all of our data will move to the cloud within the next two years.That's great news for the public cloud providers. In the quarterly earnings report Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) delivered Wednesday, it reported that Azure sales grew 63% in constant currency and said its Intelligent Cloud division now provides a third of overall revenue. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) similarly noted in its earnings call that its Web Services group grew 35% annually and now accounts for 28% of its top line.In short, there's big money being made in providing the cloud's infrastructure.An artist's depiction of cybersecurity protecting various devicesImage Source: Getty ImagesThe cybersecurity opportunityDue to this mass migration of data to the cloud, there's never been a greater need for innovative cybersecurity companies. But as the market evolves, endpoint security antivirus software from Norton and enterprise firewalls from Palo Alto Networks just won't cut it anymore. Our cloud-housed data needs new tools to protect it from data breaches and hackers -- and a new wave of companies is beginning to step up to address this need.Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS) is one of them. Based on the premise that network firewall hardware will soon become inadequate, Zscaler offers a cloud Secure Web Gateway entirely through its cloud-based security layer -- no hardware required. This decentralizes the cybersecurity protection, allowing the data to flow back and forth from the public cloud rather than redirecting it to clients' own physical data centers."
"squeeze hard everyone,"
"I'm out. There's no catalyst to boost the price back up, so therefore, it will keep drifting lower. Except yesterdays volume was above average. Above on a down day in a down trend= not good to be long. I hope all of you make money, but I got my teeth kicked in."
See what´s happening with SYMC these days. ZS is winning all their webproxy business which is huge. It´s a massive shift. And ZS technology is 2-3 year ahead of competition. What an unique opportunity. We will see ZS at &60-$80 by end of year.
Thanks for lowering the price. i got in at $275 for the first time!
We will see a lot of new large enterprise customers signing up ZS contracts in the near future. I just talked to a consultant who supported several RFIs/RFPs for large web gateway projects recently. There was no competitor close to ZS in all those cases. The ZS architecture is indeed unique. Born in the cloud for the cloud. And economy of scale will have an huge effect for ZS. Long ZS!
Zscaler Inc. shares rally Tuesday following a blitz of announcements that includes a partnership with cybersecurity company Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. Also Check Out : https://stocksheadline.com/cwle7
ZS has seen a 70% increase in volume over the past 5 days. Really validating this move higher.
"Watch and learn at tomorrow's open, watch how it gets sold off until it's in the red."
"The drop today is Interesting, especially when Jamie Dimon said cybersecutiry is the NUMBER ONE issue facing most businesses today; that being said, just hold or add at lower levels. I'm no chart specialist, but if you take a look at the chart this is pretty much normal; probable consolidation before the next leg up."
Looks like I was correct large growth but also eps loss.
See you guys i told you 300 tomorrow pre open market and 310 to 315 easy easy for closing day ahead load up as soon as you can great ER best time to invest for Long Run
Downgrade by MS today but I didn't see a price target....anyone? We were upgraded the other day to 50 bucks....
"If previous ER increase a lot, the next time mm will control the price especially ah. Same as mdb, ttd. Don’t sell . Tomorrow it will be green. Cloud security is good sector."
"The earning result is good, but it didn’t go up, but drop more instead"
"For this stock...think long term. Every System Integrator (Accenture, Deloitte, etc.) and Telcos (Network Providers to Enterprise Businesses) are being inundated right now with Digital Transformation and with any technology that can help them with ""work from home"". Every stock including ZS (ie Checkpoint, Fortinent, PANW, CRWD, WORK, ZOOM, etc.) are all benefitting right now. ZS Q3 is currently happening (Feb, March, and April), and ZS expenses are down becuase employees are not having to spend company money on gas, entertainment, flights, conferences, etc. - and they are busy upgrading their current customers to Zscaler Private Access, and System Integrators, Telcos, and Channel partners are bringing them new customers, so Revenue for this current Q3 is going up on top of what was already accrued billings for ZS Cloud. So, when the company reports their Q3 numbers in mid-May, they should blow away their EPS, as Revenues will be higher and their expenses will be lower for this current Q3. How much higher can this stock go over the long term with Global Tranformation to the Cloud, and an increased ""work from home"" economy....SKY is the limit, until MSFT comes along and says, ""will pay you even more Mr.Chaudhry to buy you out"" Stay Long my firends...and enjoy the ride."
"I'm calling the bottom. I will stand by this with an additional purchase . This will not rip back up but will be more like SQ. Slow steady base with right side of cup to come exactly as warranted. Earnings, time and persistence will be rewarded. This is not NTNX waiting on long hard to sell transformation. This is cloud security."
Looks like this thing is happy getting support at the ten day moving average… the 21 is only 5 percent below todays closing price. This stock is showing strength. Shorting it seems like a poor risk reward set up. If it bounces off the 21 day… ill add a few of the shares I skimmed off the top. If it wants to close a percentage or two below that… ill leave. Pretty simple.
"o listened to CC and the management is on the right track to execute their business plan. The management is focused on expanding the business and becoming the leader in cloud/public cybersecurity/enterprise space There no competition to speak off at this time in this field. . They could show if wanted to more revenue and profit and margin leverage instead they want to expand by investing in R&D, sales and marketing (Added 300 more employees) and acquisition. They are replacing at a fast pace internal and internet based security network/appliance based models. They are disrupting the traditional security models with their ZIA and ZPA platforms and big enterprises across the globe are adopting their technology.NTW, 4th qtr guidance is beating street again, historically Q2 and Q4 are their nest quarters.I came away from CC with more conviction then before to be in this for quite a long time."
why the beat down
"this stock has over $300M in cash, free cash flow positive, 100% cloud based, so derred revenues will be counted - and has a product like Zscaler Private Access that everyone needs when most knowledge workers wil need to start working from home to access their networks. The world has now changed, and ZS is at the forfront in helping companies change. that is why the stock is up 7% when the rest of the market is down 8%"
Just added a swing long earnings play in the post-market at $280 ~ I will take my chances here. The domination of the rap Jack by the shorts & pretend longs reminds me of the false bravado by the bears on the LULU after earnings release yesterday. The guy who said he is gonna get back in at $265. I don't think so. On-balance volume suggested accumulation. I bought Zscaler for the first time on the break-out on August 20 at $245.55
somebody knows something the way this price is acting I think we're in for a great surprise to the upside on earnings
"I moved from 1 retail company to another for about 3 years now and have implemented ZScaler to all of them. They are big and continuously growing mass and luxury retailers. Very soon, ZS will be in the level of Splunk, Adobe, Nutanix, and all other cloud companies."
"Net income (loss) per share: GAAP net loss per share was $1.93, compared to $0.89 in fiscal 2020. Non-GAAP net income per share was $0.52, compared to $0.30 in fiscal 2020."
Great response to a down market
"I’m expecting some kind of analyst action in this stock soon, my guess is Monday morning. ZS’ recent performance, mostly due to increased expectations/forecasts, I believe will lead analysts (such as GS, $53 HOLD, MS, $40 SELL, CITI, $50 HOLD) to re-evaluate their analysis. Just my two cents. What do you guys anticipate?"
"Gosh. We have a guy here who has over 1,000 clients & he is posting on the ZS thread?! What a freaking hoot. We had a dude on the LULU message board telling us that he knew of at least eighty hedge fund clients who were gonna short LULU no matter what the earnings were going to be. You shorts are funnier than the most absurd reality TV. Speaking of which, I bet some of you all were devoted Duck Dynasty fans. Yahoo!!!"
I think considering the market is green we could have a decent pop and maybe even move on up. if it was a red day I think it would have struggled.

Some kind of manipulation is definitely taking place today - there's NO reason why this stock should be off this much on NO news! Really makes you lose faith in the market when you see scams like this....the volume today is off the charts so one or more of the big boys are playing fast and loose with this one....

"A little more digging into recent analyst statements. There is no concern from analysts ZPA will hit out of the park this quarter. Problem is ZIA, B2B, & other cloud security solutions growth slowing as companies delay capital projects. Rosenblatt analyst upgraded 2 weeks ago and also referred to this problem. So expectation is this will be discussed in the early June earnings call. So is this becoming priced in? 3 analysts in 2 weeks calling out the same problem means it has started to be priced in. All 3 analysts like the longer term opportunity for ZS product adoption, issue is with corona virus delaying new capital projects."

"Is there an actual mature competitor for Zscaler. From what I see from Palo Alto and Fortinet, they are still routing traffic from endpoint devices through customer-owned routers via MPLS and SD-WAN technologies. Is there another cloud-first, direct connect competitor that doesn't require the customer to maintain all that firewall & router equipment and funnel traffic through it instead of the endpoint devices going directly to a cloud-managed interface?"
35 billion for a company that loses money?
Brother Liam this thing is not going to cooperate with you. Don’t short healthy stocks. I agree that this is not he time to buy zs as it is a little extended. But trying to scare shareholders that are happy owing the stock is just not very nice.
"Just wondering, why Palo Alto would feel to point out in their last quarterly ER that they beat out ZS on a $10M deal? Unless they think that ZS is making inroads into their potential customer portfolio?"
"It is true, after crashing over 56% from peak, Zoom is not as overvalued as something else such as bitcoin, $GME, $AMC, $SNOW, $SHOP, $TEAM, $SNAP, $DDOG, $ASAN, $CRWD, $ZS, $MDB, $OKTA, etc. However, for realistic investing purpose, it is foolish to compare Zoom to those things. When valuation for these extremely speculative bets is imploded, these bets could easily tank 90% or more, and even if Zoom tanks 70%, it is still a foolish bet nonetheless.Going forward, Zoom is only projected by stock analysts to grow annual revenue by 17.6% next year, and zero growth on annual EPS. If the future reality is slow growth or worse, the P/E ratio could easily reset to 15 or lower, and trigger a crash of over 80%.Any opposing opinions out there think for sure Zoom would continue peak pandemic type of hyper growth for many many many years to come, and further think that the stock analysts are all wrong ??? Please provide your thesis in details."
"Shorting 300 shares?! Kennedy, you would have been shorting ZS near the $287 at best. Here is input for you. The straddle on the $280 options suggested an 8% move up or down for Zscaler behind its earnings report. Do you really think ZS is heading to $255 given the price action in the post-market on high volume? Conversely, this straddle suggests an upward move to the $302 level. For your family's sake, I hope you are just braying & not actually shorting here. If you are actually shorting ZS here, you could use some prayers to go with your brays."
"$16 opening price?!? Too high valuation as it already is. I was gonna jump in, but too risky. By time we'll get to buy once it comes out on market, it'll probably be at $24-26. That's more than double what they initially where going to sell. I'm out. Buyer Beware."
"I see today as a huge buying opportunity!!!!! Just bought $400,000 worth."
Non-Volatile Electronics Corp can use Quantum Physics to produce Physical Unclonable Functions for Cybersecurity.
Another huge milestone! Zscaler just surpassed 100 billion daily secured transactions – over 10x the number of Google searches per day. This is why it is important to stay long ZS.
any idea why is this going lower today
"Totally NOT surprised at the outcome; we all talked about it and how the stock would get hammered if guidance was less than stellar....and that happened. Numbers were excellent for this young company with years ahead of it. In this investing environment I really don't know what a company can say to make their stook shoot up, but we did have a good run and when you look back at a chart a few years from now you will not even see this tiny drop; instead, it will look like a pure 45 degree line going UP."
"Shorts - the revenue number speaks for itself. The share price is going up like the revenue number. Great company, firing on all cylinders in an unprecedented growth market."
63% net loss growth from 49.5 mil to 81 mil yoy .This inflated junk needs price hair trim of 63% as well .
"Getting upgrades, having reports that ZS is the best positioned in its niche. I am very optimistic that things will move upward soon..."
Sold. Good Luck
"Zscaler, Inc. was said to acquire Smokescreen to enhance Zscaler's zero-trust exchange with advanced active defense capabilities. What do you think of this one?

ZS is going a lot higher. Great numbers and guidance

Been holding this bad boy since $60!!!

You haft to give the executives props for keeping the stock flat and not negative.
"PANW, NET & CRWD all rallied big on earnings report. This should act the same way. I think $300 is the first target."
Man oh man. What to do. What to do. Cyber security stocks have been taking it on the chin lately after earnings. So the options are hold or sell. Buy is out for now. Looking at the stats ZS is very similar to CRWD. Really leaning towards sell.
Last three quarters ZS has gone up post earnings. With the increased demand for cloud security this will out perform. Mark my words this stock is going higher after earnngs. Earnings will stellar!! Buy Buy...
"Weak earnings, 50% haircut until I see a buck eps. Sorry charlie."
MSFT has been selected to compete with Amazon for the Pentagon's cloud; hopefully MSFT will prevail and this will be HUGE for ZS which handles Azure's cloud cybersecurity. It's a TEN billion dollar contract so a nice piece should come our way.
Zscaler has reached correction status since Tuesday’s high
Hope ZS skips it's yearly 40 dollar drop.
This is a $300 plus stock
when would it be a good time to load up ZS?
to the moon
$300 tomorrow in the AH!
Anyone else loading up on calls? I know some cyber security stocks have dropped after earnings but I’m trying to stay positive!
Here is a great article in Forbes outlining why ZS is better than PANW... The future is so bright... You got to wear shadeshttps://www.forbes.com/sites/richardstiennon/2019/12/09/gartner-has-it-right-palo-alto-networks-has-it-wrong/
I bought this IPO and sold for a few percent gain lol. just realized they are doing really well. ya live and learn.
Companies are switching to Microsoft teams or webex due to security issues on zoom. This will significantly boost ZS. The short interest was down to 13.5% from 16.6% as of March 31.

"Do you think ZS will be higher tomorrow after ER today? Thumps up for YES, thumps down for NO."
"Liam, with your LULU short and this one, you should give back your CFA, if you even have the designation. I suspect that you are just a retail amateur trolling on this site."
We keep going. It’s that simple
Bought 500 @24.90.
"Look at what happened to Okta after it reported. The stock was down that evening in the after market by a few bucks but took off the next morning. Applying the same scenario to ZS, we are up after market after earnings and will be up even more tomorrow. Perhaps, new all time high. The trend is your friend."
how can a growing company stock drop 60% and everyday for 90 days?
I'm loving the after hours price action. The share price will definitely rise above $290 tomorrow.
"i spoke to a friend at PANW, and he let me know they are so busy right now becuase all existing clients are now trying to figure out how to move their workforce to a remot environment. He thinks the same is happening across the entire cloud security space - everyone is trying to figure out how their entrerprise workforce can work from home and access their network. Zscaler Private Acess I imagine is being upsold to all existing customers right now."
"I hate when companies use deferred revenue. I think it's manipulation. Deferred revenue: $630.6 million as of July 31, 2021, an increase of 71% year-over-year.Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments: $1,502.6 million as of July 31, 2021, an increase of $132.0 million from July 31, 2020."
"Earnings Results to be released on Tuesday, December 3, 2019, After the Close of the Market"
Rookie mistake by the retail shorts on Zscaler. You thought because over 8% of the ZS float was short that you had cover. And that is often the case. But you just learned a painful but worthy lesson. Take it with you & prosper. Better luck next time ~ as you are on the wrong side of this one.
"If you wondering if ZS is good a long term investment, I suggest you look at the follwoing: 1) Sales Kickoff is finishing up this week at ZS, their year end is July 31, and the number of Sales Reps that made Presidents Club is a lot more than previous years (in fact it is the biggest its ever been) - https://www.linkedin.com/company/zscaler/ - checkout the photo on the company LinkedIn page. Earnings will be reported on Sept.10 - and by the number of people that will be going to Mexico for Presidents Club, I'm willing to bet Fiscal 2019 was VERY GOOD!!! 2) Zenith Live (Annual Zscaler Customer Conference) will be one week after earning is announced starting on Sept.16 at the Venetian Hotel. You only book a Venue this large if you are expecting to have a record number of Customers and Partners come to this event for 3 days in the middle of September. Do you know how hard it is to get C-Level Executives to leave work for three days? This will be the largest customer conference in the history of the company, and expect many new annocuncements and Partnerships to be announced. 2) At least 200+ plus Job openings Globally in a company that already employs 1400 people. You only hire when your growing. And if you are hiring that many people, than you must be growing Sales at a very high rate. 3) You can't control the short-term stock price (i.e. Trump, China, Federal Reserve, etc.), but you can control building a Great Company and Security products (i.e. SWG, Next Gen Firewall, Data Loss Prevention, CASB etc.) for the Cloud where all Global 2000 companies are headed to over the next 5-7 years.4) Founder led comapnies tend to do well over the long term (i.e. AMZN, GOOG, FB, AAPL, etc.) - and when the founder and his family own almost 50% of the company, chances are he's highly motivated to succeed. Good Luck, and Happy Investing!"
Lockup expiration date? Any idea?
"Schneider David (Director) acquires 14,584 shares. Love to see continued insider buying at these levels."
"In a note Monday, Needham analyst Alex Henderson, who has a ""strong buy"" rating and claims the most bullish Wall Street price target of $89, said he ""came away with renewed confidence"" following a recent visit to the company.""Zscaler is one of our top recommendations in Cloud Direct Zero Trust Security, which we believe is the critical requirement for future security architectures,"" Henderson said. ""Zscaler has the best platform for Zero Trust, integrates tightly with Cloud Direct, and is core to delivering Digital Transformation implementations, in our view.""The analysts also played down competition in the cloud-security space from Palo Alto Networks Inc.(PANW), noting ""we see no evidence of pressure from Palo Alto and strongly believe Palo's architecture is incapable of competing with Zscaler ( ZS ).""Of the 22 analysts who cover Zscaler ( ZS ), 11 have buy or overweight ratings, 10 have hold ratings and one has a sell rating, along with an average price target of $62.63, according to FactSet data."
"Sure… if you dont own this you have some FOMO and need to talk about how it’s extended or overbought. The reality is that its only 12 percent above its fifty day moving average. Maybe a tad high to start a new position, but hardly a problem if you own the stock."
Should I buy ZS or Crowdstrike CRWD at the same price with double the market cap?
How is it that a stock like ZS is a leader in its field and the stock price keeps losing stream??
ZScaler is going to make a new high when they report next week and the stock will move like Twilio
Looks like futures are up and wow Microsoft knocked it out of the park. Listened to the conference call and they talked a lot about Microsoft 360 (Zscaler heavily involved with it). Should be a good green day tomorrow and things looking good.
"All I’m saying is...FORGET the intraday, intraweek, dips....if a company is CENTRAL to MSFTs cloud business, I want to be in it for the long haul."
Motley foot just recognized ZS as a timely stock
Classic 3 week tight chart w/low volume. Break out 250.10
Just shorted 1000 shares
How can this go up $6 or $7 every day?
"All the ""analyst"" (aka paid shills) upgrades this AM just one more attempt to pump up $ZS before hedgies and institutions start taking gains. We are now entering peak gain/loss harvesting season...."
honestly all of the security stocks beat and fell besides one. almost guaranteed it will beat just no idea how the street will react.
Looks like a little profit taking before the long weekend which is healthy. Low volume and ZS was trading at $45 and change just ten days ago. A little consolidation before the next move up.
"speculation, it's probable IBM makes a play for ZS in M&A."
It's easy $300-350. Buy before anyone else.
"ZScaler is about to move up by 50%, the move will happen because it will trade at a higher price to sales ratio, from ~30 to ~40. Also their growth and forecast should easily exceed expectations, remember the whole world has the same issue, work from home, and it is not temporary, Twitter and Square employees are now permanently allowed to WFH forever. Other companies will follow this same approach, which means ZS is in the mother of all sweet spots! By the way, did I mention the world wide demand on bandwidth? The other company in the mother of all sweet spots is Ciena, CIEN."
"Analyst Actions: Deutsche Bank Initiates Coverage on Zscaler at Buy, Price Target $171"
we march on...and up
Three all time highs the past three years. Is it time for a pull back or a 4th all time high. Chart show pull back between 170 to 205. What do you think?
Shorts to 200 and calls at 250. Who will win?
Bought 50 more shares yesterday on the dip. This and CRWD still have a lot more room to run from here.
