"Sure… if you dont own this you have some FOMO and need to talk about how it’s extended or overbought. The reality is that its only 12 percent above its fifty day moving average. Maybe a tad high to start a new position, but hardly a problem if you own the stock."

"Brother Liam. Is it true that you were short LULU? Oh my man. Wait until stocks are trading underneath the mid and long term moving averages before you short. In fact, shorting in this type of market is unwise. But its your money. Have a great evening."
"Love this stock and many in the space but let's be honest here. They don't even make 800m a year, they're losing money at record pace and worth 43b. Markets red and this is pushing higher with minimal pull back not following sector. Again no hate for the actual company or product just expensive for what this is. Im sure I will get hate just keeping it real."
Last three quarters ZS has gone up post earnings. With the increased demand for cloud security this will out perform. Mark my words this stock is going higher after earnngs. Earnings will stellar!! Buy Buy...

"The Stocks, Forex, and dividends market is constantly evolving with new features, market fluctuations, trading opportunities. You can make great profits fast but trading without experience and the right strategy for the particular market you can lose them even faster. Another thing is your risk management plan. Even if your winning system and trading psychology are good, a lack of risk management skills will make you give back all your profits at some point. That's why it's always advisable to work with a professional and registered trader, I work with Mr Harris who has taught me how to capitalize on the stock market trends and her trading signals and strategies have actually proven to bring out the best results with her knowledge and experience from stock trading, I'm always grateful because it has actually been helpful to me financially. So far I have made reasonable profits learning how to trade better through him. I recommend him, don't forget that as some are losing in the financial market, others are capitalizing and winning.Te*le*gr*am>>>>>Harrisgibson"

$ZS has a 63X TTM revenue multiple and a 45X forecast revenue multiple...it is grossly overvalued and overextended. Poster child for FOMO/MOMO.
"Beat the top and bottom and a decent guidance, problem is the stock has already run up some 30% from July, and all the good news are backed in, so not sure how much further it can go! I will take a position somewhere in $265-$270 range."
"Look at what happened to Okta after it reported. The stock was down that evening in the after market by a few bucks but took off the next morning. Applying the same scenario to ZS, we are up after market after earnings and will be up even more tomorrow. Perhaps, new all time high. The trend is your friend."
