hail CZR!
"Big over reaction here in the market. we’ll be green again. If not tomorrow, certainly by Monday after everyone had time to chill over the weekend."
CEO Thomas Reeg and his team have made a deal with Clairvest to operate its Japan IR development project. It's a free pass entry to a $25b market.
Happy that I kept buying through the bankruptcy has really paid off with spinoff and merger
This thing is a machine..one of my better life decisions to buy this at $16 back in April. Holding long to well over $100
"Lumiere place casino, which is owned by Eldorado Resorts Inc. is now taking reservations starting May 15, according to Lumiere website.>>https://lumiereplace.reztrip.com/mobile/searches/5eacb5c4fed9782709968736/hotels/SLLUPL/calendar"
"If we can climb closer to $40 in after market, tomorrow’s pre-market will do the rest. Las Vegas reopening will set the tone for all casino stocks. The $50 push Eldorado needs."
Somebody please convince me that COVID-19 was the best thing to ever happen to this company. I'm not buying it.
Deutsche Bank just raised ERI stock price target to $57!!!!
Look for higher high and lower lows in every downturn...it wouldn't stop before 128
Today would have been a great day to buy in the low 30s.... Economy will not shut down again. We can't afford to do it.
"Best ""not-talked-about"" stock this year. Bought at $14 and waiting for $85 to finally say goodbye. Thanks CZR!"
What a ride…
terrible stock
"We are not trying to time this stock by going in and out, we are ONLY increasing our positions on the dipsPersonally I haven't increased in awhile because its been going nowhere but UP UP and AWAY!To the MOON!"
Wells Fargo begins coverage of CZR today with a price target of $160.00
Caesars Entertainment is up 5.65% to 105.64
Shocking that the new company is hosting Q-Anon. I am glad I decided to not play there anymore. Seven Stars member. The new company took most of the Seven Stars perks away. All there loyal gamblers are upset.
this management knows what there doing we should go to 150 plus. added some
Anybody know if Planet Hollywood is charging for parking?
"Hey, what happened to Mr. Stagflation?"
"abigail this isn't the original Caesars, it is Caesars and Eldorado and way under valued should be a $70 stock, at least by the end of the year!"
"So my take on ER is they weathered the initial storm and have enough liquidity, plus selling two more properties to Twin River, keeps them in good hands for the moment. Assuming the merger goes through it will bump the stock in the short term. However, that's four sales in two months in an effort to keep money in hand. With the acquisition of Cesars (which still needs three state approvals) I am concerned with the long view. They are consolidating to stay liquid and make the merger happen, putting all their chips in on Cesars. I'm cautiously bullish, definitely short term. Long term will be Covid driven. I don't see a big dip coming, it feels like this was expected and baked into share price. May rise a little on the news of the sales. Probably a slow growth pattern from here till bigger news hits one way or the other."
Hale Caesar! 
Hail CZR!
"For those who don't understand current price and apparently don't want to do research, El Dorado regional casinos bought out Caesars last year and booted all CZR management. CZR prior management ran CZR to into the ground. New CEO Tom Reeg is taking this company to new levels, expanding partnerships, purchased William Hill on line betting firm and updating Las Vegas properties as well as regional properties. Most wince at the debt carried by CZR, but don't underestimate the CEO Tom Reeg's ability to generate revenue and pay off debt. They are making all the right moves at the right time. CZR will be a revenue powerhouse once the masks are off"
Something is brewing between CZR and MGM. Stayed tuned and watch the options !
"Morongo Casino re-openning last Saturday was very impressive! Morongo casino is in Cabazon, CA.It drew over 8,000 people into casino in less than 36 hours and the lines were very long at front of casino as well as outlet! Local Channel 7 TV station has the coverage of the record turn-out!I think Eldorado will do so much better than that.$45 a share is relative modest. I think $75 is a better target for near term!"
"Boys and girls - I’ve been with you all since early April. Keep holding! Corporate debt is part of the ballgame and this merger with Caesars will be great with ERI’s leadership and management efficiency of Caesars 55+ million person loyalty program. Long, strong, and proud!"
Everyone wants to get out and spend their stimulus money! Buy! Buy! Buy!
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
add on the dips going to 150 I add today. good buy.
"When it comes back to 95 or so, I will restart a position. To everyone else good luck."
"look at terms of merger, not brag about when you bought. Lower Eri price favors Czr stock value in merger. Abramson & Cantor vs Icahn. Merger valuation will be 5 day average before merge. Currently 1 Czr = approx 0.3 ERI at merger. But $1 price increase in ERI @$40 only = $0.09 increase in valuation of CZR. IMHO, ERI will peak during 5 days before merge. This gives them most CZR for the buck."
"Folks, this is only the beginning ..."
I repeat 135 before you know it !!
Anybody know where there is free parking on the Strip?
Hail to the King 
"It’s going to be a moon shot! Pretty little baby!!! 150, prepare accordingly my comrades."
"Zacks seem determined to tell people to sell. Czr have created the business, and just need to chip away at the debt now to become one of the biggest betting companies around. Long term potential is there to see for me."
Bought 500 shares of ERI at 9... wonder if it’s time to shave some gains... anyone believe this will be a 200 dollar stock by 2023
no volume
This is just the beginning of the push. Eldorado still has casinos reopening soon. The merger would be that extra ladder we need to surpass previous highs. Tomorrow morning if Pre-Market takes us over $45 we will reach for $50 Friday.
low volume and it's going up....... all buyers.just dont understand why more people aren't jumping in..... this thing could really take off!Been in it since $18.00 with Eldorado.
"Eldorado-Caesars deal sees a green light in NevadaJul. 8, 2020 3:53 PM ET|About: Eldorado Resorts, Inc. (ERI)|By: Clark Schultz, SA News Editor Eldorado Resorts (ERI +4.0%) and Caesars Entertainment (CZR +1.5%) trade higher after the Nevada Gaming Control Board recommended a commission approval for the merger of the companies. That final nod is expected later today.The combination of the two companies will make Eldorado the largest casino operator in the U.S.During a presentation to the gaming board, Eldorado CEO Tom Reeg said the company's casino reopenings have gone quite well and that group bookings for September are extremely strong."
just a little slow down on the way to 170. no problem.
"Somewhat bearish for the short term. Too many unknowns with delta surge, extended enhanced unemployment benefits being terminated by states, and inflationary pressures. There exists a strong threat from states to further restrict freedom of movement due to delta variant. I went short some time ago and I think I'll hold that position awhile longer. I did not like certain changes made in AC after take over. I see an impact after the tourist season is over on Labor Day Weekend. Good investing to all. use one man's opinion."
"It’s a battleground with shorts losing the fight. You can see it, there! In the chart. Strong rally coming next 7 weeks."
"@Chris In all due respect  You don’t have the stomach for tradingYour missing out on once or twice at best in a lifetime opportunities You, no one, will every time the bottom and top just right so you are better off just putting all your money in a low cost index fund like VFIAX. Leave the trading to me and the other ERI winners, D, SJ, etc on this board Much love"
"In Chicago, driving just 6mph over the speed limit will get you a $35.00 ticket in the mail. Cameras everywhere. The Mayor reduced speeding from 10mph over to just 6mph over the speed limit. Could you keep your from momentarily going over 6mph?"
Big boys coming for you moneyLet’s see stock market vs gamblingWho is the bigger thief Let’s play
"Lottsa news today. Named partner with the Colts, unveiled plans for 500 mil property in VA. And did I read correctly that CZR got the deal with ESPN? Wow, this is freekin solid, exciting times"
This is bullish chart to $135. Buy before anyone else !
Just checked in at Caesar’s Palace tonight. Front desk told me they have been sold out every night for the last 4 months.
BUY while you can at these great prices... and look at the shares after 3 years... and then go the casino and gamble a bit of the gains.
"CZR is like a massive ship powering its way through the sea. (See 1-year chart.) Delta variant was a large iceberg that took us off course. Hope we're back to cruising, will know for sure when we get back to triple digits, maybe in the next couple of weeks."
3 Billion!!!
"BOOM  more good news!! ESPN Explores Sports-Betting Deal Worth at Least $3 Billion, held talks with $DKNG & $CZR (via WSJ)"
Calls 125 and 105 12/17 volume are too good to be true. I guess next earnings will be high and probably is.
Here is a little first hand news. I checked into the Atlantis Casino in Reno NV on Friday ( the second day of reopening) and checked out Tuesday 6-10-2020. everyone who entered were tested using a temperal scanner in order to get in. I normally gamble during the early hours of the morning between 1 and 5 am in order to freely move between machines. Normally there is less than 50 people on the floor at 3 am. the four nights I gambled the amount of people were at least 3 times of normal. (This may be due to the virus) During the Day Atlantis was packed with people wearing masks some were not observing g the social distancing protocols. They were politely asked to move.I mention this because the financial media was not sure people would return at the same levels pre corona virus. For anyone who thinks some gamblers will opt to stay home or quit gambling you are mistaken. Gambling are addicted Some have it bad some can control it but anyone who has been to Vegas can't wait to go back win or lose virus or not Someone smarter than me should track atm withdrawals at casinos post Corona shutdown. Unfortunately I found myself using them this stay. I noticed they were either out of cash or out of service. Gambling is not going away.
Any free parking on Vegas Strip? Planet Hollywood?
"$198 by Feb. Easy play here. With all the other big name casinos stuck in Asia, CZR can run the table and grow. The sports book commercials airing on tv are simply the best. Draftking and Fandual had better watch out."
CZR and WYNN Are Very Close and also match in Prices
125 by xmas just watch.
Soon some Casinos will be opening with safety guards in place. Some areas of the country will open very soon. Just keep in mind this stock was $55 three months ago!
Hedge funds are loading the boat before November earning
"Earnings WILL be poor. This is common knowledge. But look what happened to PENN when poor earnings were released; jumped up like crazy. Something to think about. Current stakeholders: let’s hope the same happens. Prospective stakeholders: if a drop - I hope you all can get in at a good price. Great company & Monday can either go one of two ways, but other casino stocks have showed to be promising after earnings. Good luck to everyone we all deserve something good on Monday after these unprecedented times. Best to you and your families!"
"Mixed results over the past month with my portfolio. But when my largest holding CZR is rocking like it has been, all is well. Congrats longs, on another all time high."
does Caesars have casinos in Macou china like wynn does?
If you arent in I would strongly consider doing so at the open or right after (could always be a slight drop) but once Nevada Gov announces plan to reopen the strip today we are heading towards the $40 mark
"ERI shares are 37% short interest. These folks will not go down w/o a fight to sabotage the ERI/CZR merger. Expect continuous negative articles from so-called “experts” from MF and SA trying to convince you to give up your shares. The typical group of bashers here will be supported by new folks you have never seen before. A favorite tactic of theirs will be to spotlight Industry competitors and claim their superiority to ERI, with the aim of persuading impatient investors to sell their shares. Don’t fall for it! This CV-19 pandemic will eventually come to an end (some say magically on Nov. 4) and we will eventually get back to normal. This merger will be successful going forward and folks holding long and strong will be rewarded. Approvals will come through, ERI and CZR will become a stronger company for joining forces, and your patience will be rewarded. Hold and profit! GLTA!"
"Caesars pushes ahead with William Hill deal; SA author points to upsideOct. 12, 2020 12:41 PM ET|About: Caesars Entertainment, Inc.

"Mister stagflation, why so quiet? You waiting for a day when CZR drops to reappear? Or just thumbs downing everyone from the shadows? Have a nice weekend!"
Overreaction .... Completely oversold ... eom
Picked up more shares today. NJ approvals coming through and it won’t be long before folks will be asking themselves “Why didn’t I buy more when it was still under $40?” Love that Barron’s article - let’s go to $150!
Told you we were gone…Long!
RSI for this is still too high right now.
"Major upside coming, could see a 6-9 point gain soon. The cat is out of the bag ladies! We’re going to the moon!"

"If business slows, will parking be free again?"
"Just returned from my 3rd trip to Vegas since the lockdown ended. It was the most crowded visit of the three. Visited most casinos on the west side of the strip. City center was crowded, everyone was wearing a mask and casinos employees had a zero tolerance for not complying. Cosmo was the most lenient, but most did have masks, however, the young crowd was a little too free for my comfort level. Employees were walking around and enforcing it, but not as much as mgm properties. Caesars was absolutely packed. Most were compliant with mask policy but didn’t see as much enforcement as mgm. Caesars did have more buckets of disinfectants available for guests to clean machines. Link/harrahs/flamingo were just as packed with about the same precautions. Overall, very impressed with everyone’s dedication to staying safe and the extra procedures in place to ensure a safe and fun environment. Also saw a massive 3.9million win at bellagio, that was awesome."
"All time high, congrats longs. It was a bumpy ride for a while after the Eldorado merger, but I could not be happier with the mighty CZR. One of my top few investments ever, and 125 is hopefully coming up soon!"
"Great fundamentals, and u r selling !!"
Big Money for us Big Boys!Let’s go!
I wish they would actually update the analytics on yahoo for this stock like they are supposed to. Avg target price is 55 fyi. Highly undervalued
"Hi new to this , just general question!! Do you guys think this would go up after the earnings , should I buy more shares before the earning ?"
Eldorado reopened 5 casinos today. We now have 11/23 casinos back up with Vegas coming later this week. All we need is the merger announcement and we not looking back.
$50.00 on the horizon. Will be a powerhouse in casino business once the Caesars merger is completed.
Buy before next run to 135 !!
I am raising target from 135 to 155 with strong buy call. Very bullish chart.
I saw the article from Barons that talked about how Covid impacted visitors in August. That’s bull. I stayed at Caesars in mid August and it was PACKED. The front desk manager told me that they had been sold out of rooms for 120 days.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/globalnews.ca/news/6990678/las-vegas-casinos-reopening/amp/I’m not sure what anyone is questioning right now. This stock is going to sky rocket knowing that casinos will open and they are taking over CZR...
Was just at Casesers Palace 2 weeks ago. Place was packed and the front desk manager told me they have been booked solid for the last 4 months.
"Wynn Pushes for Nevada Opening (2:20 p.m. NY)Wynn Resorts Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Matt Maddox is calling for parts of Nevada’s economy to start reopening in early May, followed by the Las Vegas Strip in the middle or later part of the month.Maddox, in an opinion piece published by the Nevada Independent, outlined safeguards such as reduced hotel occupancy, physical distancing measures, temperature checks and no large gatherings. He also proposed keeping hospitalizations and deaths relative to the population below the U.S. average.The casino operator was the first in the state to shut down operations and is paying staff for 60 days through May 15.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-hails-governors-fewer-deaths-214247801.html"
this is a 20 dollar stock at best.....it will take awhile but you will see
"Why I am very bullish, not just long term, but even very very short term.1- $CZR, Caesars earnings were just fantastic and pushing the stock up 7%+ right now2- $Penn, earnings are friday and it's not hard to see those numbers will mimic or best caesars.3- Cheaper entry and substantially undervalued compared to the above companies.4- Company is and always will be a valued acquisition target by ""bigger fish""5- Legalization and expanding markets."
"It will close at $90 today. And up every day, the rest of the week. Don’t be pressured to sell low."
More ath's coming...
still a good buy a little pricey but it going to 150 if not more. was at one of there casino's today it was really crowded I loss to.
This is great news...https://finance.yahoo.com/news/capital-one-arena-caesars-sportsbook-145728729.html
"Hi I am in Atlantic City the Tropicana which is on by El Dorado is fairly busy and they are not giving anyone free rooms as far as I know at least anyone who is not a huge player as they are trying to make money on the rooms as well they quoted me a price of over $200 for a room Saturday night a friend of mine who is a reasonably good player was forced to take a room at the Wyndham everyone is wearing masks inside the problem is at night on the boardwalk maybe two out of town are wearing masks and if the infection rate goes up Murphy the governor will not open indoor dining and who knows what they will do the casinos however he has 26,000 casino workers down here that he needs to get back to work no Poker as of yet which is what I enjoy and I would say the place is doing much better than I thought it would as far as mortgaging the properties to the Riets that is like an individual taking it home equity line because the casinos had all their money trapped in their real estate with no access to it now they have a business #$%$ which Carl Icahn founded which shows them how to free up cash from their real estate and use it to enhance operations or pay down debt MGM is using the same deviceThey will all use it eventually if you have a mask on they will not give you an extra one here they do watch every penny I think it will be a very successful company going forward and they would have not gone into this if they did not have a plan to pay off the debt which I believe they will do but not only enhancing operations bye-bye mortgaging the property toThe real estate investment trusts and use that money to pay off the debt and then have a very successful operating business the old rules do not apply to casino valuations because of the ability to take the money out of the real estate which was never done before as I said Carl Icahn I believe developed this is Atlantic City with the Tropicana there is a war between the Longs and the shorts on this company and I believe the Longs will win good luck everyone"
I heard about CZR the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"My target remains 135, and raising to 155."
"why offered up to $5000 free bet to get one new customer. Such an expensive move. Why don't CZR just acquire Sklz. The players on sklz's platform already gave a gambling mindset. For every video game, there are millions players. Those players can turn over w a single mouse click. Do what PENN did with Barstool, cost a lot less and more effective. Skillz is more valuable than Barstool. They already have it's own marketing company Aarki. This is a no brainers. whoever acquire Skillz will have a head up to their competition in Customer Acquisition. "
Long! Suit up!

Anyone else manage to snag some shares when it dropped in to the 35 range?
"I played at Harrahs for 29 years. I obtained the highest card level. The new company has taken away almost all the perks from all their high level players. This is not a secret. The people that gamble, and are regular pay the rent. The new company has also fired many people. You may find a very good earnings report/ reports due to the slashing of employees and the end of comps for the high level players in the short term. I will never gamble with them ever again. The question is? Will the money continue to flow in without the ones that gamble the most?"
They’re trying to steal your shares…stay long! $200 stock.

"Hey guys would appreciate your advice.. I'm currently up 100% on ERI, up around $1,200 and in it long. When would it be a good idea to take profits and if so how much of it to take out vs keep it all in and let it ride? Thanks!"
EPS -9.40 ugg

"Gambling is an addiction and these casinos by nature will be at full capacity within 12-24 months. This is an easy stock to own right here and a definite double. Yes, there will be ebbs and flows in the next 3 months. But, buy and hold is the best strategy with casino (and restaurant) stocks."
