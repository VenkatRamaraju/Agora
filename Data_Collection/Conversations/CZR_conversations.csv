"Shorts are covering. And big, long-term investors are taking more, quietly. They are thrilled to buy more at this level. No need for short-term gains"
Wells Fargo begins coverage of CZR today with a price target of $160.00
"In Chicago, driving just 6mph over the speed limit will get you a $35.00 ticket in the mail. Cameras everywhere. The Mayor reduced speeding from 10mph over to just 6mph over the speed limit. Could you keep your from momentarily going over 6mph?"
Big boys coming for you moneyLet’s see stock market vs gamblingWho is the bigger thief Let’s play
why is this stock crashing daily. all the casinos are packed
football season this will go big time possible 150 NFL team in Vegas will pack them in hotels from all over.
does Caesars have casinos in Macou china like wynn does?
Happy that I kept buying through the bankruptcy has really paid off with spinoff and merger
"All time high, congrats longs. It was a bumpy ride for a while after the Eldorado merger, but I could not be happier with the mighty CZR. One of my top few investments ever, and 125 is hopefully coming up soon!"
"It’s going to be a moon shot! Pretty little baby!!! 150, prepare accordingly my comrades."
Something is brewing between CZR and MGM. Stayed tuned and watch the options !
"Focus on digital...$1B EBITDA within 2-3yrs. Whaaaat?! Next step...consolidation. Merger w MGM. Will own the strip. The gaming industry is now so huge and broadly defined, that there will not be an anti-trust issue. Maybe need to sell a few properties. THEN....takeover of Sands. Will control US and Asia"
CEO Thomas Reeg and his team have made a deal with Clairvest to operate its Japan IR development project. It's a free pass entry to a $25b market.
Long! Suit up!
"I'd Been Followed and Day Trade CZR Since March-2020 at 9 and make lots of money until Today, I'm So Happy Every day"
If you arent in I would strongly consider doing so at the open or right after (could always be a slight drop) but once Nevada Gov announces plan to reopen the strip today we are heading towards the $40 mark
"Zacks seem determined to tell people to sell. Czr have created the business, and just need to chip away at the debt now to become one of the biggest betting companies around. Long term potential is there to see for me."
Eldorado reopened 5 casinos today. We now have 11/23 casinos back up with Vegas coming later this week. All we need is the merger announcement and we not looking back.
Bought 500 shares of ERI at 9... wonder if it’s time to shave some gains... anyone believe this will be a 200 dollar stock by 2023
"With ERI taking Caesars name, they have to merge the stocks once the market opens. That is why everyone got CZR stocks at 12 a share. CZRs is already trading for 41.25 on Etrader. No need to panic, we will get our money back once the market opens up."
"It’s a battleground with shorts losing the fight. You can see it, there! In the chart. Strong rally coming next 7 weeks."
I repeat 135 before you know it !!
"Do you sellers and shorts get it now after $CZR? They trashed critics, posting impressive results. We, as market participants should be forward looking, not looking back to March of 2020, the place we are trading right now. I will keep adding if you keep taking it lower."
Overreaction .... Completely oversold ... eom
"abigail this isn't the original Caesars, it is Caesars and Eldorado and way under valued should be a $70 stock, at least by the end of the year!"
125 by xmas just watch.
"Best ""not-talked-about"" stock this year. Bought at $14 and waiting for $85 to finally say goodbye. Thanks CZR!"
"BOOM  more good news!! ESPN Explores Sports-Betting Deal Worth at Least $3 Billion, held talks with $DKNG & $CZR (via WSJ)"
"I have to think that CZR is caught up in general pull back due to concern of investing in hospitality and resort when government is trying to shut us down again. USA is 70% vaccinated, it's time to give up the draconian mask wearing and fear mongering of catching a cold. Notice how there is only focus on the number of new cases or ""spreadability"" not mortality rate. It is simply because the mortality rate of Covid19 (any variant) is now below the seasonal flu in the USA. This administration has no concern of Covid19 other than use it for fear and control for their anti-capitalist, tax and spend agenda. If you are high risk, take precautions... otherwise it's time to get on with our lives. Covid19 will never be eradicated, it is here to stay just as the flu and rhinovirus (common cold)."
"Folks, this is only the beginning ..."
"bought 5000 Shares at Dip at 86 on July-19, Should I Sell all and Profit-taking Now / Any Advice ?"
Was just at Casesers Palace 2 weeks ago. Place was packed and the front desk manager told me they have been booked solid for the last 4 months.
CZR is going to crush Q3 earnings. Hopefully this will convince folks that Las Vegas is back and push share price over $120
"CZR, you rock!!!!"
All WYNN investors welcomed here.
Hold. Don’t fall for it.
"Mixed results over the past month with my portfolio. But when my largest holding CZR is rocking like it has been, all is well. Congrats longs, on another all time high."
this management knows what there doing we should go to 150 plus. added some
https://www.google.com/amp/s/globalnews.ca/news/6990678/las-vegas-casinos-reopening/amp/I’m not sure what anyone is questioning right now. This stock is going to sky rocket knowing that casinos will open and they are taking over CZR...
Big Money for us Big Boys!Let’s go!
"Amazon Down 250 After Hours, Tomorrow AMZN will drag all tech stocks down. Would CZR Affected ? Any Advice ?"
Sweet deal 
"I bought 5000 Shares at Dip at 86 on July-19, Should I Sell all and Profit-taking Now / Any Advice ?"
"Major upside coming, could see a 6-9 point gain soon. The cat is out of the bag ladies! We’re going to the moon!"
Paranoia has set in apparently….no move after record 2 nd quarter. That’s without conventions & large groups etc etc .
Shocking that the new company is hosting Q-Anon. I am glad I decided to not play there anymore. Seven Stars member. The new company took most of the Seven Stars perks away. All there loyal gamblers are upset.
"Great fundamentals, and u r selling !!"
EPS -9.40 ugg
Anybody know if Planet Hollywood is charging for parking?
I am raising target from 135 to 155 with strong buy call. Very bullish chart.
He also told me he has been interviewing 75 people a day to fill open positions.
More ath's coming...
"Lottsa news today. Named partner with the Colts, unveiled plans for 500 mil property in VA. And did I read correctly that CZR got the deal with ESPN? Wow, this is freekin solid, exciting times"
Caesars Entertainment is up 5.65% to 105.64
2 words - online betting. It is completely underestimated how huge this market is and the William Hill move puts CZR in a great place.$100 easy.
"Great CZR ghost, new all-time high!!!"
CZR has a nasty habit of end of day sell off.
"Just returned from my 3rd trip to Vegas since the lockdown ended. It was the most crowded visit of the three. Visited most casinos on the west side of the strip. City center was crowded, everyone was wearing a mask and casinos employees had a zero tolerance for not complying. Cosmo was the most lenient, but most did have masks, however, the young crowd was a little too free for my comfort level. Employees were walking around and enforcing it, but not as much as mgm properties. Caesars was absolutely packed. Most were compliant with mask policy but didn’t see as much enforcement as mgm. Caesars did have more buckets of disinfectants available for guests to clean machines. Link/harrahs/flamingo were just as packed with about the same precautions. Overall, very impressed with everyone’s dedication to staying safe and the extra procedures in place to ensure a safe and fun environment. Also saw a massive 3.9million win at bellagio, that was awesome."
"Hi new to this , just general question!! Do you guys think this would go up after the earnings , should I buy more shares before the earning ?"
"CZR is like a massive ship powering its way through the sea. (See 1-year chart.) Delta variant was a large iceberg that took us off course. Hope we're back to cruising, will know for sure when we get back to triple digits, maybe in the next couple of weeks."
still a good buy a little pricey but it going to 150 if not more. was at one of there casino's today it was really crowded I loss to.
"Japan expansion? Oh man, $150 coming…"
Everyone wants to get out and spend their stimulus money! Buy! Buy! Buy!
"If business slows, will parking be free again?"
"8/15 is right around the corner....will see positions. Most of the large ones likely behind bank disclosures. Shorts are out. Vegas is jammed through the Fall. Digital is at its infancy. Covid is fear, not reality for Vegas business. CZR is trading at 3x 2022 cash flow. $200 by mid-2022"
"Hey guys would appreciate your advice.. I'm currently up 100% on ERI, up around $1,200 and in it long. When would it be a good idea to take profits and if so how much of it to take out vs keep it all in and let it ride? Thanks!"
I wish they would actually update the analytics on yahoo for this stock like they are supposed to. Avg target price is 55 fyi. Highly undervalued
What a ride…
Did I hear 1 billion in EBITDA….. yep Vegas is back !
Are they charging for parking at Planet Hollywood?
hail CZR!
wynn and caesars charts look beautiful
All of Vegas is packed sister was there 70 percent of city folks vaccinated
Wow!!! 
I saw the article from Barons that talked about how Covid impacted visitors in August. That’s bull. I stayed at Caesars in mid August and it was PACKED. The front desk manager told me that they had been sold out of rooms for 120 days.
$50.00 on the horizon. Will be a powerhouse in casino business once the Caesars merger is completed.
"Wynn Pushes for Nevada Opening (2:20 p.m. NY)Wynn Resorts Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Matt Maddox is calling for parts of Nevada’s economy to start reopening in early May, followed by the Las Vegas Strip in the middle or later part of the month.Maddox, in an opinion piece published by the Nevada Independent, outlined safeguards such as reduced hotel occupancy, physical distancing measures, temperature checks and no large gatherings. He also proposed keeping hospitalizations and deaths relative to the population below the U.S. average.The casino operator was the first in the state to shut down operations and is paying staff for 60 days through May 15.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-hails-governors-fewer-deaths-214247801.html"
"Mister stagflation, why so quiet? You waiting for a day when CZR drops to reappear? Or just thumbs downing everyone from the shadows? Have a nice weekend!"
This is just the beginning of the push. Eldorado still has casinos reopening soon. The merger would be that extra ladder we need to surpass previous highs. Tomorrow morning if Pre-Market takes us over $45 we will reach for $50 Friday.
Anybody know where there is free parking on the Strip?
Roller coaster ride
"Hhmmm , you're not Caesars, you're tools with a gambling problem."
It’s all about cash generation. The EBITDA margin. And 50-100% ROE in digital. $1B investment funded by asset sales. Crazy! CZR is trading at 3-4X forward EBITDA
Dennis stocks is an uneducated investor . Czr got William hill for free they will get 2 billion in couple months . In addition most experts view them as the leader next ten years along with draftkings and FanDuel with one huge edge . It’s icasino business will bring in billions of profits as it’s customer list in millions and it has continuing walk in business that draftkings didn’t have . The profits they will have will pay off their debt in 4 years or less as they will pay off 2 billion in few months . So many uneducated investors
Nevada went back to masks today for patrons and employees. Performance people exempted so shows will go on.
"Hey, what happened to Mr. Stagflation?"
"Morongo Casino re-openning last Saturday was very impressive! Morongo casino is in Cabazon, CA.It drew over 8,000 people into casino in less than 36 hours and the lines were very long at front of casino as well as outlet! Local Channel 7 TV station has the coverage of the record turn-out!I think Eldorado will do so much better than that.$45 a share is relative modest. I think $75 is a better target for near term!"
Just checked in at Caesar’s Palace tonight. Front desk told me they have been sold out every night for the last 4 months.
"Wow, that EPS beat is beyond impressive. This stock deserves to be back over 100. Completely oversold lately."
just a little slow down on the way to 170. no problem.
"Just buy 5000 Shares at the dip today at 87.20, i might Sell all and Lock in profit before the market Close today, Since Profit taking is always the best strategy in such a Volatile market and Cash is always King"
"ERI shares are 37% short interest. These folks will not go down w/o a fight to sabotage the ERI/CZR merger. Expect continuous negative articles from so-called “experts” from MF and SA trying to convince you to give up your shares. The typical group of bashers here will be supported by new folks you have never seen before. A favorite tactic of theirs will be to spotlight Industry competitors and claim their superiority to ERI, with the aim of persuading impatient investors to sell their shares. Don’t fall for it! This CV-19 pandemic will eventually come to an end (some say magically on Nov. 4) and we will eventually get back to normal. This merger will be successful going forward and folks holding long and strong will be rewarded. Approvals will come through, ERI and CZR will become a stronger company for joining forces, and your patience will be rewarded. Hold and profit! GLTA!"
Big news…MS knows what’s up son!
"God almighty had been doing great things in my life but the greatest he did was to have connected me to this Trader that has turn my life around. Some months ago I started investing with David rock and it was very successful I was able to earn over 34,000$ weekly.. with an investment of 6000$ it been so amazing trading and investing with David platform you can contact him via Telegram @davidrock7"
"Guess it's a good day to be a casino stock like CZR with no Macau exposure. Wynn getting hit, maybe sellers there will move it to CZR"
casinos will be only outlet people have even if virus returns.￼ casinos ￼will make him eat!￼
Stay Long Fellow Longs!
"Yeah, that Planet Hollywood deal will be huge."
"@Chris In all due respect  You don’t have the stomach for tradingYour missing out on once or twice at best in a lifetime opportunities You, no one, will every time the bottom and top just right so you are better off just putting all your money in a low cost index fund like VFIAX. Leave the trading to me and the other ERI winners, D, SJ, etc on this board Much love"
BUY while you can at these great prices... and look at the shares after 3 years... and then go the casino and gamble a bit of the gains.
I see 150 easy by year end there casino's are crowded I been to some. people wearing mask.
"Somewhat bearish for the short term. Too many unknowns with delta surge, extended enhanced unemployment benefits being terminated by states, and inflationary pressures. There exists a strong threat from states to further restrict freedom of movement due to delta variant. I went short some time ago and I think I'll hold that position awhile longer. I did not like certain changes made in AC after take over. I see an impact after the tourist season is over on Labor Day Weekend. Good investing to all. use one man's opinion."
"Stay long, headed higher."
Just as I posted to the uneducated poster Dennis stocks. The value of customer list is insane and dkng just paid 1.5 billion for one and Caesar’s has the biggest which will make them top 3 in this business forever . Many shorts look at their debt and I would have agreed with them prior to online revolution . The amount of profit they will have in couple years can pay off their debt in 2 years in full and they will get 1.5 -2 billion for William hill pay down more debt . In 4 years they will have little debt with double valuation and an ebita unheard of ever before
Upcoming earnings will be strong. This will return to $100+ within the coming week. Hoping to gain traction as the gaming industry returns to full capacity. Visited the Casino in Montreal; packed; $50 minimum at the tables; no spaces available. People are returning to the industry in droves … glta
CZR and WYNN Are Very Close and also match in Prices
Calls 125 and 105 12/17 volume are too good to be true. I guess next earnings will be high and probably is.
add on the dips going to 150 I add today. good buy.
RSI for this is still too high right now.
Buy before next run to 135 !!
"When it comes back to 95 or so, I will restart a position. To everyone else good luck."
"Hi I am in Atlantic City the Tropicana which is on by El Dorado is fairly busy and they are not giving anyone free rooms as far as I know at least anyone who is not a huge player as they are trying to make money on the rooms as well they quoted me a price of over $200 for a room Saturday night a friend of mine who is a reasonably good player was forced to take a room at the Wyndham everyone is wearing masks inside the problem is at night on the boardwalk maybe two out of town are wearing masks and if the infection rate goes up Murphy the governor will not open indoor dining and who knows what they will do the casinos however he has 26,000 casino workers down here that he needs to get back to work no Poker as of yet which is what I enjoy and I would say the place is doing much better than I thought it would as far as mortgaging the properties to the Riets that is like an individual taking it home equity line because the casinos had all their money trapped in their real estate with no access to it now they have a business #$%$ which Carl Icahn founded which shows them how to free up cash from their real estate and use it to enhance operations or pay down debt MGM is using the same deviceThey will all use it eventually if you have a mask on they will not give you an extra one here they do watch every penny I think it will be a very successful company going forward and they would have not gone into this if they did not have a plan to pay off the debt which I believe they will do but not only enhancing operations bye-bye mortgaging the property toThe real estate investment trusts and use that money to pay off the debt and then have a very successful operating business the old rules do not apply to casino valuations because of the ability to take the money out of the real estate which was never done before as I said Carl Icahn I believe developed this is Atlantic City with the Tropicana there is a war between the Longs and the shorts on this company and I believe the Longs will win good luck everyone"
"Why I am very bullish, not just long term, but even very very short term.1- $CZR, Caesars earnings were just fantastic and pushing the stock up 7%+ right now2- $Penn, earnings are friday and it's not hard to see those numbers will mimic or best caesars.3- Cheaper entry and substantially undervalued compared to the above companies.4- Company is and always will be a valued acquisition target by ""bigger fish""5- Legalization and expanding markets."
no volume
Look for higher high and lower lows in every downturn...it wouldn't stop before 128
Hail to the King 
They’re trying to steal your shares…stay long! $200 stock.
Any free parking on Vegas Strip? Planet Hollywood?
"Boys and girls - I’ve been with you all since early April. Keep holding! Corporate debt is part of the ballgame and this merger with Caesars will be great with ERI’s leadership and management efficiency of Caesars 55+ million person loyalty program. Long, strong, and proud!"
Hail CZR!
I heard about CZR the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
3 Billion!!!
Don’t believe the hype! Moon shot coming!!
Up 16K since the fake virus.
Deutsche Bank just raised ERI stock price target to $57!!!!
"If we can climb closer to $40 in after market, tomorrow’s pre-market will do the rest. Las Vegas reopening will set the tone for all casino stocks. The $50 push Eldorado needs."
Price action lower than expected … oversold!! People worried about the resurgence of COVID variant … get vaccinated people!!!
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"

terrible stock
This is bullish chart to $135. Buy before anyone else !
Here is a little first hand news. I checked into the Atlantis Casino in Reno NV on Friday ( the second day of reopening) and checked out Tuesday 6-10-2020. everyone who entered were tested using a temperal scanner in order to get in. I normally gamble during the early hours of the morning between 1 and 5 am in order to freely move between machines. Normally there is less than 50 people on the floor at 3 am. the four nights I gambled the amount of people were at least 3 times of normal. (This may be due to the virus) During the Day Atlantis was packed with people wearing masks some were not observing g the social distancing protocols. They were politely asked to move.I mention this because the financial media was not sure people would return at the same levels pre corona virus. For anyone who thinks some gamblers will opt to stay home or quit gambling you are mistaken. Gambling are addicted Some have it bad some can control it but anyone who has been to Vegas can't wait to go back win or lose virus or not Someone smarter than me should track atm withdrawals at casinos post Corona shutdown. Unfortunately I found myself using them this stay. I noticed they were either out of cash or out of service. Gambling is not going away.
"For those who don't understand current price and apparently don't want to do research, El Dorado regional casinos bought out Caesars last year and booted all CZR management. CZR prior management ran CZR to into the ground. New CEO Tom Reeg is taking this company to new levels, expanding partnerships, purchased William Hill on line betting firm and updating Las Vegas properties as well as regional properties. Most wince at the debt carried by CZR, but don't underestimate the CEO Tom Reeg's ability to generate revenue and pay off debt. They are making all the right moves at the right time. CZR will be a revenue powerhouse once the masks are off"
low volume and it's going up....... all buyers.just dont understand why more people aren't jumping in..... this thing could really take off!Been in it since $18.00 with Eldorado.
"$198 by Feb. Easy play here. With all the other big name casinos stuck in Asia, CZR can run the table and grow. The sports book commercials airing on tv are simply the best. Draftking and Fandual had better watch out."
10 day swing trade over
Told you we were gone…Long!
"Ask yourself where will the stock market be in January 2021?Where will the stock market be in late 2020? Where will ERI be in 6 months/December?You know the answer!Buy now and don’t look until then, its not worth any aggravation, up down up down, down down, up down, up up, down, when all is said and done, you are getting a 50% off sale! Take advantage of it, don’t just let the Wall Street guys make all the money, it’s time we get our share!"
