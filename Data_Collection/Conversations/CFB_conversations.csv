Beware of the illusion of earnings! Loan loss reserve can be manipulated. CrossFirst loan portfolio contains a large amount of oil & gas loans. Natural gas was recently trading at 50 year lows. Demand for oil will be reduced with more use of renewables. A recent WSJ article noted largest number of bankruptcies in the oil & gas industry in years are coming in down the pike. CFB will be adversely impacted and so will stock. Stock performance since IPO has been poor.
