Mfg earning over $9 billion of comprehensive income over the past year if you gross up the 2 million shares of black rock it owns. Nearly $85 billion of book value and nearly a 5% dividend. Not bad for a $40 billion essential bank of Japan.

"I doubt the Olympics will have any significant effect. No spectators, tighter COVID restrictions, thinner sponsorship and promotions, a seemingly lack of worldwide viewer enthusiasm, and the amount of money spent on venue infrastructure will probably not produce any real economic boost. However, I think Japan's turning the corner on COVID and eventually loosening restrictions will be the catalyst for improvement."
