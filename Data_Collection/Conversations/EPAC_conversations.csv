I have been a long time holder of this stock. It truly amazes me that management can retain their positions. They have done absolutely nothing for the shareholders over the past decade.

They pay the president of the company almost $1 million per year for a company with a market cap barely over $1 billion? Really?

Check out the pathetic insider ownership of this stock. It shows how management has no confidence in its own company. Hardly any stock purchases on the open market. They only wait for their stock grants to dilute the earnings. Despicable.

The most benevolent Board of Directors (for company management) and the most egregious case of Board malpractice (the shareholders be damned). Just to keep pace with the S&P 500 over the past ten years this should be at $82. No movement at all over this timeframe. Stunningly pathetic.

"All these accolades for the departing CEO, good old Randy. Really?? They should be reflecting on the abysmal stock performance during his tenure. The Board is culpable as well. Total ineptitude."

Management's compensation is so out of whack with the dismal performance of this company. We need an activist shareholder to clean house.

Check out the insider transaction tab. You will see stock grant after stock grant issued to management. What you won't see is any stock purchases on the open market by our esteemed management team. They just continue to suck this company dry. Only hope is an activist shareholder

"Wow, an action taken by the Board of Directors, replacing the CEO. Way past time to completely clean house. Including the Board."
