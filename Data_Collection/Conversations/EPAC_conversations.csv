"Randy's exit interview with the company.....Randy, we'd like to understand your significant accomplishments in order to set your golden parachute. After an uncomfortable amount of time passes Randy responds ""well I changed the company name!""Ok...here's $10 mil."

They pay the president of the company almost $1 million per year for a company with a market cap barely over $1 billion? Really?

If ever a company needs a management shake up it's this one. They never meet earnings or revenue projections.

"All these accolades for the departing CEO, good old Randy. Really?? They should be reflecting on the abysmal stock performance during his tenure. The Board is culpable as well. Total ineptitude."

The most benevolent Board of Directors (for company management) and the most egregious case of Board malpractice (the shareholders be damned). Just to keep pace with the S&P 500 over the past ten years this should be at $82. No movement at all over this timeframe. Stunningly pathetic.

The Board needs to be scrutinized and held accountable on Randy's golden parachute. If this guy gets one dime it's too much. Time for a class action lawsuit?

How much is Randy getting to hang around till year end? Just another way to milk the company.
Is Randy getting a golden parachute?
"Wow, an action taken by the Board of Directors, replacing the CEO. Way past time to completely clean house. Including the Board."

I have been a long time holder of this stock. It truly amazes me that management can retain their positions. They have done absolutely nothing for the shareholders over the past decade.
Check out the pathetic insider ownership of this stock. It shows how management has no confidence in its own company. Hardly any stock purchases on the open market. They only wait for their stock grants to dilute the earnings. Despicable.

Management's compensation is so out of whack with the dismal performance of this company. We need an activist shareholder to clean house.
Actuant expects Q1 sales of $260M to $270M & EPS of $0.14 to $0.19. Consensus was for $294.95M & $0.28. $ATU

Just a pathetic management team and Board. The stock is at a major low and still no insider buys. I guess they are waiting for their annual stock grants for doing such a fantastic job! Where are the lawyers?

Check out the insider transaction tab. You will see stock grant after stock grant issued to management. What you won't see is any stock purchases on the open market by our esteemed management team. They just continue to suck this company dry. Only hope is an activist shareholder
