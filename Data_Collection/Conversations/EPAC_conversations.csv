I have been a long time holder of this stock. It truly amazes me that management can retain their positions. They have done absolutely nothing for the shareholders over the past decade.
The Board needs to be scrutinized and held accountable on Randy's golden parachute. If this guy gets one dime it's too much. Time for a class action lawsuit?

If ever a company needs a management shake up it's this one. They never meet earnings or revenue projections.
Is Randy getting a golden parachute?
They pay the president of the company almost $1 million per year for a company with a market cap barely over $1 billion? Really?
