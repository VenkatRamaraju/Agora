The Board needs to be scrutinized and held accountable on Randy's golden parachute. If this guy gets one dime it's too much. Time for a class action lawsuit?

Is Randy getting a golden parachute?
If ever a company needs a management shake up it's this one. They never meet earnings or revenue projections.

I have been a long time holder of this stock. It truly amazes me that management can retain their positions. They have done absolutely nothing for the shareholders over the past decade.
