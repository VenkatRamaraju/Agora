Check out the pathetic insider ownership of this stock. It shows how management has no confidence in its own company. Hardly any stock purchases on the open market. They only wait for their stock grants to dilute the earnings. Despicable.

Stock price March 2013 $34.13. Thanks management for everything you did to grow the company. Pathetic.
Is Randy getting a golden parachute?
Check out the insider transaction tab. You will see stock grant after stock grant issued to management. What you won't see is any stock purchases on the open market by our esteemed management team. They just continue to suck this company dry. Only hope is an activist shareholder

I have been a long time holder of this stock. It truly amazes me that management can retain their positions. They have done absolutely nothing for the shareholders over the past decade.

"All these accolades for the departing CEO, good old Randy. Really?? They should be reflecting on the abysmal stock performance during his tenure. The Board is culpable as well. Total ineptitude."

The most benevolent Board of Directors (for company management) and the most egregious case of Board malpractice (the shareholders be damned). Just to keep pace with the S&P 500 over the past ten years this should be at $82. No movement at all over this timeframe. Stunningly pathetic.

Management's compensation is so out of whack with the dismal performance of this company. We need an activist shareholder to clean house.
