Prime buy out target at these prices......638 bank mergers last year...
will drop back a little today as dow declines.
"Big banks can’t buy back their own shares, or up their dividends, but they can buy smaller banks."
serious flooding in Birmingham
When When When will this stock go up? I'm holding on but geez getting harder to keep talking myself into not hitting that sell button.
"With a P/E of 12.7 and a yield of 3.2%, RF looks like a good long-term investment for a prudent investor seeking primarily income."
RF is going.on a run just.like the big banks.
"RF will be bought by either JPM or BAC in 2018. Solid financials and strategic locations along the southeast corridor, that would compliment either large bank's total locations."
Make some moves already.
two of these three calendar dates are true: dtg4Mar2021 ex-div 1Apr2021 dividend pay date 4Apr2021 major announcement: RF files 13D to buy position in WFC
"No one on MSNBC as ever mentioned a ""RICO"" suit. All they HAVE done, is recommend Regions."
"Earnings were better than what Wells Fargo did , and its stock is going up . Again , Banking Industry is too Saturated . RF needs to Merge with another Regional soon."
earning announcement and a revised upward target of $20 on the same day. verrry interesting!
"Three months back, RF was 15.60. By the end of 2018, I won't be surprised if the price goes north of 25. More dividend growth and interest rate trends that will help all banks increase revenue."
RF was over $17.00 before the virus...When the virus passes could we return to $17.00...?
As soon as you get a positive article the stock goes down ?? Its like these analyst wright these articles because they are getting ready to dump their position into the strength
"FED released the results of their 2nd Bank Stress Tests after market close today. Results were very good, banks are generally well capitalized to withstand any loan defaults. The restriction on Bank share buybacks was lifted but buyback amount cannot exceed trailing 12 month earnings. Great news for banks, especially those with solid earnings. Most banks up big in after-hours trading."
the next time B of A downgrades a competing bank.....buy buy buy!
"This is a beautiful hold. Low p/e, share price got cut from 20 to 13, the business is doing well. We have a decent dividend yield with another increase next Spring. And every CC from management describes the economy as doing okay. RF is buying back shares and loan losses are near historical lows. I'm just building my share count with dividend reinvesting. Just don't see the negativity in financials, I understand that interest rates will likely move higher at a slower rate than maybe anticipated."
RF is down -100.00% to 0.00
"I usually never get caught up in the hype/speculations of buyouts...but today's news released by RF is great news. Eliminating debt is a good thing! And now we have Barron's suggesting PNC might be looking to take out RF. Add to that, the ex-dividend date is coming up in a couple weeks. I wouldn't be surprised to see RF back in the $11's by end of May."
"Wow......... increase in qtrly dividend from .09 to .14 That is a 55% increase in the dividend. Plus the proposed $2.03 Billion in share buyback over the next 12 months. That is incredible. I know we are coming up from a small base but those are awesome increases. If you are a LT dividend investor, this has been a slam dunk. Long since 2010."
Reminder: RF presents at Credit Suisse Virtual Finance Services Forum tomorrow.
#RF has been showing support at 17.07 and resistance at 18.42. Technical indicators are looking bullish at stoxline.
"rf's balance sheet, income statement, and sources and uses statement look extremely strong to me. sooner or later someone will notice. value investing to the max."
"when i was my son's age, i didn't have time for video games. i played this game called ""a job."""
Wesley your posts couldn't be more wrong
guess who now owns the biggest pork producing company in this country? THE CHICOMS!
"With USB picking up that Japanese branch bank in California, it would seem that RF has lost one of its rumored suitors. But, I still believe they will be in the merger/acquisition mix soon."
Raise the Div price will go up
"CCAR results come out on June 28th. We will see a div increase and share buyback number that I expect will be very bullish. Another regional bank HBAN expects to payout 45% of earnings in divs over time. If RF's div policy is similar, we can expect another large div increase. Last qtr for RF was $.35 eps, over a year that is eps $1.40. 45% of $1.40 = .63 annual dividend. (Current div is .36/year.) We are not going to get that but a double digit increase seems to be on the way. Lot of room for div growth."
pe of 11 puts this stock at $16.8. New short term target.Should continue to rise following jpm good earnings.
RF reached a new 52 Week High at 18.90
"Screaming buy. Leveraged Free Cash Flow isn't usually a stat used on banks. But if it were, RF would be shown to be a screaming buy."
not as robust a quarterly report as i had hoped for.
"Banking stocks all down, Warren buffet bought into this sector, says sector is under valued."
"when BAC goes up 3.4% in one day, you know banks are hot. RF may take a day or two."
"MS just revised upward their short term RF target to $24. RF chart now shows 6 closing prices above top Bollinger, and none below lower band since 19 Nov 2020."
"RF going down again! No surprise since ignoring the $46,000,000 RICO lawsuit circling them."
"Regions is ignoring a $46,000,000 RICO lawsuit involving Interstate Mail Fraud and Tortious Interference with Contractual Relationships? https://twitter.com/roundtaillight/status/1009774882744406016"
RF's PEG ratio continues to drop. going higher. bank on it.
"22 Jan 2021 is next earnings release. If earning are $.419 or above, then whoa nelly! Roll Tide!"
Mueller rally incoming
"i'm gonna buy me a brand new yugo tomorrow, off my rf profits. in the ghetto. and his mama cried."
"Great ER released....11 percent growth, $20 stock"
RF is buying back over a billion dollars worth of shares. I guess they will be trying to drive the price down until they buy them. This would mean we are losing short time value until they get their shares. Does this sound right?
Nothing official but ex-div expected next week (why do they wait so long to announce) and it will be larger than last year
Sold the remainder of my $8.18 shs I bought early last year. Possible global headwinds. Risk will build into next year. Higher rates will occur early next year due to rampant inflation. Economy as a whole will suffer from policies coming from DC. I will reinvest when the next 20%+ dip occurs.
RF has great div Funds keep adding on dips and they love it Buy on dip
This is a solid bank with great leadership
50 day ema has dropped below 200 day ema. RF has gotten a bit ahead of itself. time to bail for a while.
"Bank stocks have had a very nice run, prices should level off for a couple of quarters, until earnings catch up with valuation."
"Does anybody know what this means, what RF will be required to do?""The Federal Reserve on Monday said it dismissed the stress-test appeals lodged by five banks . . . . and Regions Financial."""
top Bollinger is now 22.24. will take that out next week. roll tide!
I see a bullish move here 22 plus this quarter 
Facebook wants banks to share information so they can pinpoint ads. If regions goes for this they can kiss me goodbye.
GS to buy Regions. Buy the november21 17.50 calls
This is a hold long.
you can't let this flu over-reaction affect your thinking. look at RF's chart before the big dip. ascending pennant formation.
I don't know what's going on here but I like it. RF and T are both in my portfolio and are making great gains.
Regions Financial reached a 52 Week high at 24.06
"In response to the Fed announcement, a substantial increase in the dividend would be a much, much more positive sign than another share buyback. Reducing the float can be like putting lipstick on a pig, makes all the ""per share"" number look better, whether there's any real improvement or not. But handing shareholders more money is real--there's no way to fake a dividend."
"RF has lost more market cap by ignoring this $46,000,000 RICO lawsuit's circling them with its adverse social media publicity (And it looks to get worse next week when C level is ""apprised."") by refusing to prove they are not conspiring with Wallace in their abuse of legal process. JMO BTW, GA RICO is triple damages and US Supreme Court gives GA RICO lawsuits 50 state jurisdiction. Birmingham, AL, Regions could be in court in Rockdale, GA?"
I heard about RF the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
look for profit-taking to drop RF back to slightly above $18. But the trend is in!
"I love rf. The employees are super friendly at my branch, the on-line banking software is great, the bank is in a growing region, and the fact that they challenged the stress test requirements is also a positive since management must be thinking finances are looking good."
"sometimes, when you follow a stock closely and there is good news, it can take a couple days for the market at large to react to what you already know. you wonder what gives? imho, that's what's happening today. today."
"RF & nearly all bank stocks are down for past 2 days because the 10-year treasury yields are going down.Even banks with decent Q4 earnings reports are down. RF Q4 earnings were good, but forward 2021 guidance not so hot. This is the pattern that most banks have been reporting for 2020 Q4.RF is a well run regional bank that will do just fine in time, but banks in general may stall at these levels until interest rates improve & COVID is under control. Remember that most banks are up 40+% since end of September & there is bound to be some profit taking."
"I’m a fan of this bank based in the South and Midwest currently, since the laws of those states promote working and earning your own wealth, as opposed to being given handouts by the government, which never translates to wealth growth. A cheap financial growth stock that has dividend date next month, this one is a buy and hold."
"RF Q3 earnings report will be released on the morning of Tuesday 10/20.Earnings estimates: .33/share average, .25/share low, .42/share highRevenue estimates: $1.49B average, $1.44B low, $1.53B highRemember that the Q3 numbers are in the past - July, Aug, Sept. Important to hit the Q3 numbers, but the forward guidance will play a larger role in the direction of the RF stock price."
$22.50 by May 15th!!!! $25.00 by Sept 1st.

Higher dividend = higher stock price.
I love this stock. This has been my stock of choice for a long time. Sold out of TSLA and BBBY this morning. Back in RF. Lets see how this goes.

wesley wins Poster Of The Year Award.
"Exactly, he is making an assumption. RF's financials do not depict increasing loan losses. RF is operating well in their footprint. I hope the share buyback is picking up these shares on this dip. And we should get another generous dividend increase next Spring."
Suntrust being acquired should bode well for Birmingham based Regions.
suggestion:the positive results of the fed's bank stress test will probably cause a blip up prior to the opening bell which may fade later in the trading day. suggest placing a pre-market order.
"One particular bank stock that I have been following is Regions Financial Corp (NYSE:RF). This stock just put in a minor top on September 5th, 2018 at $19.99 a share. Today, the stock is trading around the $18.27 level. Please note, the stock is now trading below the 50 and 200-day moving averages which is an indication there should be more downside in the near term. The one level that looks solid for a potential long swing trade is around the $17.00 area. This is where the stock was defended around the mid-July time period and should be supported when retested."
The trend is our friend. Let it ride to $15 plus.
Regions Financial is up 5.75% to 13.52
It would seem that if the financials were going to be encouraging the price would not be headed south.
RF reached a new 52 Week High at 17.91
bank mergers are heating up again!
"Folks, this is an amazing growth story! Geographically, South-eastern banks are poised to outperform the rest of the country... on the coattails of tax reform and IR hike: Hollywood's relocation to Atlanta, hurricane aftermath stimulus, Housing market 'growth', and the prospect of Amazon's HQ2. Regions is also taking market share from other local competitors. I think RF takes out $40 by late 2019- early 2020."
rf has the same intrinsic value today as it had last week. i've preached for decades to stay away from Chinese stocks--having had two different ceo's run off with the treasury stock. recourse? absolutely none.
Great News - Odeon Capital upgraded RF from HOLD to BUY. But no buyout. Sorry @robert.
the four decimal point trades are the specialist taking a position. they are on the uptick today.
RF reached a new 52 Week High at 18.20
"Regions Financial upgraded to Conviction Buy from Buy at Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs analyst Ryan Nash added Regions Financial to Goldman's Conviction List with 90% upside to the firm's price target of $14. With short-term interest rates at zero and a 10-year in the 100 basis point range, Regions' margins will prove to be ""much more defensive"" than others given its hedging of short-term interest rate risk, Nash tells investors in a research note. The analyst keeps a Buy rating on Regions Financial.Read more at:https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3055628"
mr peabody says rf is a good buy.
"If this stock never rises above current levels I will feel it is my fault. One would think that with the type of life I've led God would seek to reward me. God has however decided to test me through my investments. It appears my investments in banks has been reason enough for God to point me in different directions. My last investment in banks ended with an approximate $100,000 loss I was never able to recover as this was when the demon ocrats failed to listen to suggestions that they ask the banks to show more restraint on loaning money for mortgages on overpriced housing to low income families and families. Maxine Waters thought it was marvelous the banks would give money to families who couldn't afford a home. My bank went bankrupt and tried to take me with it. I am hoping I could be rewarded for attempting another stab at a bank, that being RF. I have been a customer at the same bank through name changes dating back to 1987. My investment has seemed to cause the stock price to fall. Hopefully someone with good luck will offset the damage I have caused."
"In yesterday at 14.46 and 14.49 and out today at 14.74 and 14.77, respectively. Little over a grand after commissions and fees. Maybe I'll have a chance to jump back in tomorrow...or cry in my beer if it jumps higher. At least I can buy a PREMIUM beer."
Up in AFTER HOURS..... Way Over SOLD
Nice day...price target 16.50..recession fears were just that....fears..not fact
Anybody understand what the Sabal Capital acquisition brings to RF? I assume there is a strategic vision behind bolt-on acquisitions. Reminds me of the job interview question: Where do you see yourself in five years? How would the RF board respond to that?
looks like rf's mgmt wants to be the buyer rather than the buyee. that works.

strange call option activity. Someone betting alot..it will hit $15 by april 4th
There will be a dividend increase
"@Robert - Give us a break. RF is surely not being accumulated today on low volume & a small loss on share price. Yes, PNC has a huge amount of cash on hand but there is no evidence that they are going to be making an offer for RF. Sure sounds like someone is trying to pump up RF for their own gains, not realizing that RF has nearly 1 billion shares in float & you can't possibly move the stock price on the Yahoo message board......"
"Buybacks, dividend increase , stock dropping ! What am I missing?"
calling in bonds early. always a good sign for a bank.
"Hi Anthony and Chicken- I am new to day trading and was wondering if you could share your thoughts on some good stocks to monitor and learn about. I'm looking at RF, but think I'm too late to the game on this one now. Thanks!"
"RF has a ton of cash on hand, over $13 per share, so i think dividend is safe. They have enough $ on hand to ride out this corona mess, then shares should trend up to $14-15 when economy picks back up in early 2021. Until then enjoy the dividend."

i love it when you can take advantage of an over-reaction.
"Dewey, Cheetum, and Hou just issued a rare double down on Regions Bank, citing a accelerating improvement in PEG ratio."
Great price to get in today. it will be over 19 next week when they beat huge in earnings like they did last quarter.
Sell-off is in reaction to B of A & Goldman decline in revs. RF has a different business model. I'm hoping decline in rev is not as significant on a percentile basis.
"Im baaaaack!! Bought yrs ago at $7,,and bailed at $15 (really didnt think it would hit $20),,,Now things have reset and poised for another run (in at $12.50).Interest rates going up more,Efficiency,looking better,Bad debt loans decreasing,Nice divvy,and good buyback program.I'll bail again once it hits $25.(I was right last time,and in position to hit it right again :) SQ,RF,CORT and KMI :)"
BBT as possible buyer?
"Regional banks are extremely healthy, I would not be surprised to see several mergers....Regions,Huntington, Fifththird all would make great merger candidates....."
"rf has bounced off the lower bollinger band (two sigmas) and has traded above the top bb five times since november, and never below the lower bb. the rsi confirms at 62, ie. above 50. and their numbers look great. the $21 target (multiple recommendations) looks very doable."
Notice RF outperforming again despite a downgrade by Wedbush.
"@robert - It is Goldman Sachs, not Goldman Sacks. And they will not be acquiring RF. Why would a large investment bank like Goldman Sachs want to buy a regional bank? Two completely types of businesses."
Any chance someone will buy this. I have been a customer for 32 years and an investor for a few months. The investment in their stock appears to be a major mistake.
all the bank stocks fell suddenly BELOW their lower bollinger band in two days--a classic over-reaction to a very small FED adjustment. this is a value investor's dream scenario buying opportunity.
"the board has to approve, but we wont know till ex-div date should see a .02 increase. its been a profitable year"
Whats wrong with this one.
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SHE3
"So, does the acquisition of EnerBank make RF a more attractive or less attractive target for merger or takeover? I would say less attractive, because of the increased complexity associated with more diverse moving parts. Will it make a substantial dividend increase more or less likely? Again, I would say less, with free cash being diverted to the costs of integrating the new operation. Share price? Continues down, into somewhere around $18.50. As a very long term investment, probably makes sense, but if you're looking for a quick profit, look elsewhere."
"strange market. very strange. RF makes their number and the market panics, while an electric car company about to go bk still commands $275 a share. i'll stay with the regional banks."
Buying Senior Debt smart move.
"RF needs to look north for expansion possibilities soonest. this is a unique time for banks to either expand/merge or stagnate. the ky, in, wi, and mi areas look attractive to me. the southern tier is saturated."
"Do not sell the bank stocks, finally see the some light now on!"
i'd like to think RF would do everything in their power to get all races in Alabama to get vaccinated.
"Yup, RF reports 2020 Q4 earnings on Friday 1/22. Average consensus is approx .42/share earnings & $1.56 billion revenue. While 4Q earnings numbers are important to hit, it is in the past. The forward guidance & loan loss status needs to be positive news also to support the huge run-up in share price recently."
"Looking Good For Tomorrow..... Analysts recently raised ...Analysts watching the company’s growth closely have provided estimates for its revenue growth with an average revenue estimate of $1.56 Billion. They suggested that in the process company could generate revenue of as low as $1.52 Billion which could climb up to $1.6 Billion to hit a high. The average estimate is representing an increase of 5.2% in sales growth from that of posted by the company in the same quarter of last year. In keeping analyst consensus estimate with, company is forecasted to be making an annual revenue of $6.16 Billion in 2021, which will be +5% more from revenue generated by the company last year.In last 7 days, analysts came adjusting their opinions about stock’s EPS with 1 upward and no downward revisions, an indication which could give clearer idea about the company’s short term price movement. In contrast, when we review RF stock’s current outlook then short term indicators are assigning it an average of 100% Buy, while medium term indicators are categorizing the stock at an average of 100% Buy. Long term indicators are suggesting an average of 100% Buy for it."
"Seems someone is privy to higher than expected loan losses; which were hinted about in an earlier downgrade. If RF's earnings are expected to have a big hit, they have obligation to make share holders aware of this."
RF's report on 2020 efforts to hold the line during troubled times is very encouraging.
Bank South and Cadence Merger announced this morning. That takes 2 more Southeast banks out of play. That leaves one gem in Regions available. Let the bidding begin.

"Citigroup downgrades to sell, lowers PT from $16 to $14. Jefferies upgrades to buy, raises PT from $16 to $18."
it's so sad that the SEC states have such low vaccination rates--including Alabama. what can RF do to change this?
"One thing positive for the company. The company has indicated it is buying back $1,000,000,000 worth of shares back. They should be able to buy quite a few shares back at these discounted prices. It isn't encouraging for investors when the stock goes up and down like a yo yo"
Why do these bank execs get paid so much when this stock has basically done nothing for the last 40 years. Overpaid to under deliver!
"RF price target raised from $12 to $14 by Trust Securities. But still no buyout.@Robert - RF is one of the larger regional banks with a total market cap of approx $12 billion.I'm sure that bank merger/acquisitions will occur, but they usually involve smaller banks being acquired by the larger banks. What makes you think that a large regional bank like RF will be the target of an acquisition?"
my portfolio is a chicom free zone. thank the lord.
Wish we could keep pushing towards $16.
Lot of amateur lawyers on this board.
SEEMS OVERSOLD
"Decent dividend, solid bank according to the numbers hang in there"
Nice pop. I hope we can keep the momentum.
We’re seeing buyers looking strong
"At the time I posted two months ago, RF was 15.60. The upside happens, while the skeptics keep nah saying. RF has solid fundamentals and is an easy target for a monster bank to takeover and if not, the economics cycle is very positive for regional banks like RF. Let's see in two more months!"
"Zack's just put out an article titled: This is Why Regions Financial (RF) is a Great Dividend Stock. Having held RF for more than 20 years, through the bad times and the good, ""a Great Dividend Stock"" is exactly what I hoped it would get back to being when it was at its worst. Barring another global financial catastrophe, RF will continue to regrow the dividend, slowly and responsibly, like a quality bank stock should do. And share price will follow yield."
"earnings beat in 2 days, with 23+ close."
"Dividend increase: looking at the current and historical numbers, I'm predicting a 13% increase in the annual dividend, from $0.62 to $0.70. Assuming earnings not much different from preceeding quarter, that will leave the payout ratio below 50%, and should support a share price increase to about $22.00."
"IMO regional bank mergers/acquisitions won't start to occur until the Covid situation is more controlled & the USA has mostly re-opened for business again. Currently too much uncertainty as to the extent of loans that will default & the near zero interest rates will result in reduced profits for the banks until interest rates start to rise. Hard to value any bank now because they all declined to provide forward Q2 guidance on their Q1 earnings release. Banks are so busy with servicing existing loans & processing new loans currently that they probably do not have the time/resources to start due diligence on a merger/acquisition. It is a complicated process.RF is one of the larger regional banks. Market cap of approx $10 billion & book value of approx $16 billion.They may be a buyer of smaller banks instead of a target. Those 638 mergers last year were mostly tiny community banks being acquired by larger regional banks.But in these uncertain times, who knows what can happen? The banks will do whatever makes financial sense to them under the circumstances that they are in.IMO we really need to somehow get the USA open for business quickly. We just can't operate with 33+ million unemployment claims & small/medium business bankruptcies. That is what will really hurt the bank stocks."
Best regional bank play in America. I bank at Regions...moved $63 million through them last year. Bought this in the $3's many years ago. Sold it at $9 and change. Watched it go to $16. Kicked myself for a long time for not holding. Added more today. Great bank. Buyout target!
"More assumptions than facts;Nomura/Instinet analyst Bill Carcache downgraded Regions Financial (NYSE: RF) from Neutral to Reduce with a price target of $14.00 (from $17.00).The analyst cites a view that accelerating commercial and industrial loan losses with drive negative EPS revisions and drive shares to underperform regional peers. The analyst further comments ""Industry C&I loan growth has accelerated sharply YTD as underwriters have loosened lending standards amid weaker loan demand. Against this backdrop, KEY and RF are growing C&I loans at elevated rates above the industry, and we believe this will lead to greater-than-expected loan losses"

Raise The Dividend I Need It.
Dividend is safe now. A lot depends on the economy and especially the virus.
"I read the Barrons article & it is the typical short general type that they use to fill up their weekly paper.Of the hundreds of regional banks, they only have 6 targets & 5 buyers? No buyout price targets or estimated time frames? The only buyers that seem to have the size & capital to merge/acquire are the two canadian banks. The other 3 are much smaller than the targets. There will be regional bank consolidation in due time, just need more USA financial stability & clarity first.No one can place a value on a bank currently due to a lack of forward guidance for earnings & loan defaults.Barrons mentioned 263 mergers last year (approx 5 per week). The vast majority involved tiny banks that we've never even heard of, not banks like RF, CFG, SNV, TCF."
Load the dips today for the 6% rise on Fri. (16.6 - 17.0) target.
Big first quarter earnings beat of 63 cents vs estimste of 48 cents. Sweet.

"There's some support about $1 away each direction. Selloff breaks $13, back to single digits. Really annoying trying to invest your money in a market run by robots that are constantly evaluating stop losses and margin balances."
"Two weeks ago I penned on this thread: ""I usually never get caught up in the hype/speculations of buyouts...but today's news released by RF is great news. Eliminating debt is a good thing! And now we have Barron's suggesting PNC might be looking to take out RF. Add to that, the ex-dividend date is coming up in a couple weeks. I wouldn't be surprised to see RF back in the $11's by end of May.""Damn good call!"
We’re moving up here nice
New Price Target of $22 issued this week by Morgan Stanley. That would be a nice move from these levels.
"GS reported Q3 earnings this morning & of course there was no RF buyout announced. Why would a large investment bank want any regional bank? If a buyout was to be announced, do you think that it would be done during a quarterly earnings report?All the geniuses who post nonsense about RF being acquired have absolutely no knowledge of any merger/acquisition for any publicly traded company. They are just investors who are stuck in their stock at a much high price. I hope everyone understands this."
met earnings of 37 cents. Revenue up 2.6%. Solid quarter but nothing to get too excited about.
"Still cheaper and a lot less stress than returning a check stamped ""insufficient funds""."
Last summer RF announced a $2 Billion share repurchase program. That was going to last 1 year. I hope they are sitting on some dry powder. Approx. 13.4% of the market cap. could be bought up at today's share prices. Great for long term holders.
"rf in up channel. lewing gud! if you're into regional banks, checkout sybt. they just bought a big expansion.interesting. instead of regionals being bought, they are doing the buying."
