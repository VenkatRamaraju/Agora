"earnings beat in 2 days, with 23+ close."
not as robust a quarterly report as i had hoped for.
rf has the same intrinsic value today as it had last week. i've preached for decades to stay away from Chinese stocks--having had two different ceo's run off with the treasury stock. recourse? absolutely none.
"declining revenues ain't where you wanna be, regardless of earnings."
Sold the remainder of my $8.18 shs I bought early last year. Possible global headwinds. Risk will build into next year. Higher rates will occur early next year due to rampant inflation. Economy as a whole will suffer from policies coming from DC. I will reinvest when the next 20%+ dip occurs.
the four decimal point trades are the specialist taking a position. they are on the uptick today.
it's so sad that the SEC states have such low vaccination rates--including Alabama. what can RF do to change this?
As soon as you get a positive article the stock goes down ?? Its like these analyst wright these articles because they are getting ready to dump their position into the strength
"With USB picking up that Japanese branch bank in California, it would seem that RF has lost one of its rumored suitors. But, I still believe they will be in the merger/acquisition mix soon."
looks like rf's mgmt wants to be the buyer rather than the buyee. that works.

I heard about RF the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
i love it when you can take advantage of an over-reaction.

how bout those 500 coal-fired power plants the chicoms are building. 50 years more pollution. are we that afraid of the chicoms that we won't challenge this?
50 day ema has dropped below 200 day ema. RF has gotten a bit ahead of itself. time to bail for a while.
RF is going.on a run just.like the big banks.
Anybody understand what the Sabal Capital acquisition brings to RF? I assume there is a strategic vision behind bolt-on acquisitions. Reminds me of the job interview question: Where do you see yourself in five years? How would the RF board respond to that?
my portfolio is a chicom free zone. thank the lord.
