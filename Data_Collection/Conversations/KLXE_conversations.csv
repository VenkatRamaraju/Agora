"All I have to say is, I’ve been waiting since April for this move. There were days I felt these oils were dead money for life’, that oils were my worst - ever investment thesis in my 40-year investment career, and that their only value would be as a tax write off. That may eventually still be the case, but at least for the time being, it looks like my patience is finally paying off!Here’s to more oil patch gains waking forward!!

This isn't red. Not sure how to handle it.

"Schlumberger, a bellwether of the sector, is hugely optimistic on the direction of the oilfield service industry.Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) has revealed that the company saw global revenue of $5.84 billion in the third quarter (3Q).The figure, which included $4.67 billion in international revenue and $1.12 billion in North America revenue, marked a four percent sequential increase and an 11 percent year on year increase, Schlumberger highlighted. The company’s 3Q international revenue was four percent higher sequentially and 11 percent higher year on year and its North America revenue was four percent higher sequentially and nine percent higher year on year.Schlumberger’s net income for 3Q came in at $550 million, compared to $431 million during the previous quarter and a loss of $82 million compared to year ago figures.“We started the second half of the year with strong results, delivering another quarter of sequential revenue growth, a fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion and a solid free cash flow performance,” Schlumberger’s chief executive officer Olivier Le Peuch said in a company statement.“Revenue growth was led by well construction and reservoir performance, our predominantly service-oriented divisions, delivering quality revenue that more than offset the impact of transitory global supply and logistics constraints in production systems,” he added in the statement.“International revenue grew 11 percent year on year and is on track to meet our double digit revenue growth ambition for the second half of 2021 compared to the same period last year,” Le Peuch went on to say.Looking ahead, the Schlumberger CEO said the company anticipates another quarter of growth and expects to close 2021 with strong momentum “that will set the foundation for an exceptional growth cycle”.“The industry macro fundamentals have visibly strengthened this year, particularly in recent weeks, with demand recovery, oil and gas commodity prices at recent highs, low inventory levels and encouraging trends in pandemic containment efforts,” Le Peuch said"
"In the beginning of June 2021, KLXE was $14.50 per share while OSX, the oilfield service index, was at 69.50.A few up and downs for both, but OSX regained almost everything it lost between June and now: currently at 64.50.

"""Looking forward, we expect stronger results in the second quarter and further improvement through the balance of the year. This is supported by higher activity levels and slightly improved pricing across many of our service lines, which is estimated to result in a sequential increase in fiscal second quarter revenue between 15% to 20%. Combining the recovering top line with the full impact of the $46.0 million in annualized merger synergies, the incremental $4.4 million in annualized cost savings, and modest pricing improvement, we believe we will return to breakeven Adjusted EBITDA in the fiscal second quarter 2021 for the first time since pre-Covid,"" concluded Baker."

"“Observation of the stock market will show that the stocks of companies facing receivership are likely to be more active than those which are very low in price merely because of poor current earnings. This phenomenon is caused by the desire of insiders to dispose of their holdings before the receivership wipes them out, thus accounting for a large supply of these share at a low level and also sometimes for unscrupulous efforts to persuade the unwary public to buy them. But where a low-priced stock fulfills our conditions of speculative attractiveness, there is apt to be no pressure to sell and no effort to create buying. Hence the issue is inactive and attracts little public attention. This analysis may explain why the public almost always buys the wrong low-priced issues and ignores the really promising opportunities in this field.” -Security Analysis by Ben Graham & David Dodd, Sixth Edition, Page 523$OIH $CXW $GEO $DIDI $PTEN $RRC $AR $PSCE $KLXE $REI $RIG $MRO $MUR $RES"

"Saudi Arabia Just Crushed U.S. Crude Oil Prices AgainGlobal oil demand is faltering, and Saudi Arabia just slashed prices to two of the world's biggest customers.The crude oil recovery has hit its first big speed bump.The surge in COVID-19 cases in many parts of the world, the end of a weak peak-summer demand season in the Northern Hemisphere, and the cessation of record crude purchases by Chinese refiners in the second quarter have created a chain of events that has crude oil futures cratering on Sept. 8. At this writing, Brent crude is down 4.5% to $40.13 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate futures are down a brutal 7% to $37.02 per barrel. Today's massive sell-off comes after news over the weekend that Saudi Arabia was cutting crude prices for October shipments to both Asian and U.S. refining customers. This marks the first time since early in 2020 that the petro state has lowered prices for crude shipments to the U.S., putting its selling price to Asia back below the country's target benchmark as Chinese shipments weaken after months of stockpiling.Stacks of oil barrels"

"KLXE has a market cap of $94 M and an enterprise value of $215 MIt has $121 M cash and 24 M sharesI have never seen anything more absurd in terms of undervaluation of a stock. Management clearly has the possibility of buying back one-half of outstanding shares for around $50 M and still have cash of around $70 M left. Alternatively, management can first buy back as much stock as possible at these ridiculously low prices and when they cannot buy the rest without driving up the price too high, they can simply take the company private – bingo. That would be a great way for them to get rich."
