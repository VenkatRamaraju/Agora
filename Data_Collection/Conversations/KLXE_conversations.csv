"“Observation of the stock market will show that the stocks of companies facing receivership are likely to be more active than those which are very low in price merely because of poor current earnings. This phenomenon is caused by the desire of insiders to dispose of their holdings before the receivership wipes them out, thus accounting for a large supply of these share at a low level and also sometimes for unscrupulous efforts to persuade the unwary public to buy them. But where a low-priced stock fulfills our conditions of speculative attractiveness, there is apt to be no pressure to sell and no effort to create buying. Hence the issue is inactive and attracts little public attention. This analysis may explain why the public almost always buys the wrong low-priced issues and ignores the really promising opportunities in this field.” -Security Analysis by Ben Graham & David Dodd, Sixth Edition, Page 523$OIH $CXW $GEO $DIDI $PTEN $RRC $AR $PSCE $KLXE $REI $RIG $MRO $MUR $RES"

Management clearly has the possibility of buying back one-half of outstanding shares for around $50 M and still have cash of around $70 M left. Alternatively, management can first buy back as much stock as possible at these ridiculously low prices and when they cannot buy the rest without driving up the price too high, they can simply take the company private – bingo.

"""Looking forward, we expect stronger results in the second quarter and further improvement through the balance of the year. This is supported by higher activity levels and slightly improved pricing across many of our service lines, which is estimated to result in a sequential increase in fiscal second quarter revenue between 15% to 20%. Combining the recovering top line with the full impact of the $46.0 million in annualized merger synergies, the incremental $4.4 million in annualized cost savings, and modest pricing improvement, we believe we will return to breakeven Adjusted EBITDA in the fiscal second quarter 2021 for the first time since pre-Covid,"" concluded Baker."

"Saudi Arabia Just Crushed U.S. Crude Oil Prices AgainGlobal oil demand is faltering, and Saudi Arabia just slashed prices to two of the world's biggest customers.The crude oil recovery has hit its first big speed bump.The surge in COVID-19 cases in many parts of the world, the end of a weak peak-summer demand season in the Northern Hemisphere, and the cessation of record crude purchases by Chinese refiners in the second quarter have created a chain of events that has crude oil futures cratering on Sept. 8. At this writing, Brent crude is down 4.5% to $40.13 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate futures are down a brutal 7% to $37.02 per barrel. Today's massive sell-off comes after news over the weekend that Saudi Arabia was cutting crude prices for October shipments to both Asian and U.S. refining customers. This marks the first time since early in 2020 that the petro state has lowered prices for crude shipments to the U.S., putting its selling price to Asia back below the country's target benchmark as Chinese shipments weaken after months of stockpiling.Stacks of oil barrels"
