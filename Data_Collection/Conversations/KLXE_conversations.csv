"This is an easy swing to $18, march highs. 3x!!! Price was marked down due to insider selling, these were Quants executives that received stocks as part of severance pkg. As this is thinly traded, the selling brought down the price especially with wti crashing down in the same time period. This company still has 1,200 employees, $38m cash and gave guidance for positive Q2 earnings."
and the WINNER is ... ROBERTSON CORBIN J JR. He made millions from July to now on unloading his shares at the right time. I smell insider trading!!!
"Schlumberger, a bellwether of the sector, is hugely optimistic on the direction of the oilfield service industry.Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) has revealed that the company saw global revenue of $5.84 billion in the third quarter (3Q).The figure, which included $4.67 billion in international revenue and $1.12 billion in North America revenue, marked a four percent sequential increase and an 11 percent year on year increase, Schlumberger highlighted. The company’s 3Q international revenue was four percent higher sequentially and 11 percent higher year on year and its North America revenue was four percent higher sequentially and nine percent higher year on year.Schlumberger’s net income for 3Q came in at $550 million, compared to $431 million during the previous quarter and a loss of $82 million compared to year ago figures.“We started the second half of the year with strong results, delivering another quarter of sequential revenue growth, a fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion and a solid free cash flow performance,” Schlumberger’s chief executive officer Olivier Le Peuch said in a company statement.“Revenue growth was led by well construction and reservoir performance, our predominantly service-oriented divisions, delivering quality revenue that more than offset the impact of transitory global supply and logistics constraints in production systems,” he added in the statement.“International revenue grew 11 percent year on year and is on track to meet our double digit revenue growth ambition for the second half of 2021 compared to the same period last year,” Le Peuch went on to say.Looking ahead, the Schlumberger CEO said the company anticipates another quarter of growth and expects to close 2021 with strong momentum “that will set the foundation for an exceptional growth cycle”.“The industry macro fundamentals have visibly strengthened this year, particularly in recent weeks, with demand recovery, oil and gas commodity prices at recent highs, low inventory levels and encouraging trends in pandemic containment efforts,” Le Peuch said"
crude futures.. ?!
"The pullback in oil stock valuations was far more drastic than the drop in the price of WTI. I think that earnings are about to start mattering. IMHO even if crude prices stayed the same, CPE, $CDEV, $LPI, $MRO, $MTDR $REI and drillers like $RIG and $KLXE would have risen unless Delta got really bad. That was a blow off bottom, so to speak."
"MONSTER 300k buy today at $4.5.Another one was seen some days ago , another 340k!.Enjoy the last dips. OIL IS NOW AT $84, which looks like the new normal!"
excellent upward trend...
Not sure why everyone cares so much about this sale. Maybe the guy is going through a divorce. Maybe he’s buying a house. Who knows and who cares

nat.gas up..
"In the beginning of June 2021, KLXE was $14.50 per share while OSX, the oilfield service index, was at 69.50.A few up and downs for both, but OSX regained almost everything it lost between June and now: currently at 64.50. However, KLXE has not regained anything. Why is the discrepancy? Where is the catch?"
What is up with the volume today? Extraordinary. This stock ought to do better with today's commodity prices.
"VP..you're right! everyone should want to do DD...but they seem to covered with innuendo, forensics, and ""smells""..."
