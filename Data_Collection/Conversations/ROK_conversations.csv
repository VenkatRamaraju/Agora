"Reported sales up 32.6 percent year over year; organic sales up 26.4 percent. Record orders of over $2 billion, up double digits year over year.Inorganic investments contributed 1.1 percent to reported sales growth.Diluted EPS of $2.32; Adjusted EPS of $2.31.Cash Flow from Operations of $461.5 million; Free Cash Flow conversion of 161%.Updating fiscal 2021 sales growth guidance to ~12% and organic sales growth guidance to ~8%.Updating fiscal 2021 Diluted EPS guidance to $12.85 - $13.05 and Adjusted EPS guidance to $9.10 - $9.30, including $(0.15) . They had a great quarter, but updated their guidance to negative growth due to covid-19 concerns and ""continued supply chain constraints""."
Why is this trading at a 14% discount to a mostly cash offer ?
Crushes earnings and off 5%.
"I just did an 8 method weighted valuation on ROK and I came up with $163. I may have been a bit too conservative with my revenue growth estimates for 2019 and 2020 and too aggressive with my 2019 repatriation tax forecast, but even accounting for that, anything above $170 seems expensive.40% of their revenue is outside of North America. Their forecasted range of sales growth seems very ambitious given arithmetic mean annual revenue growth over the last 5 years is negligible. So where am I wrong? I’m curious if I missed something in my forecasting. I included future allocated buybacks and 8.4% dividend growth. What’s the bull-case for ROK at $180+?"
"I think Rockwell is looking at $350-$400 by EOY. Too much automation demand, and demand in a ""living wage"" is just going to destroy more and more (human) jobs."
"Just Sold Short 560 shares of ROK at $182.02. This is a Pure Earnings play. ROK reports before market open tomorrow and I think there is significant risk of a bad ER, and a significant sell-off tomorrow as a direct result. This stock is over-valued and there is every reason to expect the ER will be bad. Coronavirus impacts will be felt more on ER's going forward, than in previous months. I think this could get a 5-15% haircut tomorrow and the risk/reward ratio of this Short play is very good."
Just curious does Rockwell have a lidar company they work with?
"the senate passed 1 trillion infrastructure bill. Once (IF) the house passes it, Rockwell will benefit greatly! If we have a dip this week I will add. In the meantime we keep having new highs each week."
ROK hit a new 52 week high today! $300 soon. $350 by the end of Q3. IMO 
"Ok “S”, ROK A NEW ALL TIME . Volume is only 170k @ 1:45 vs. average of 700k. Nobody’s selling! What do you think?"
very quiet message board .All this stock does is make $$$$$
"Why I love ROK and other companies to booster productivity.Manufacturers and other businesses can sustain and even increase production, even in the services sector, by investing more in technologies that boost productivity. And it's already happening. The Q2 GDP reports shows that the amount of goods and services that were produced was 1% greater than the total amount of goods and services produced in Q4 of 2019, well before the pandemic struck. That is, GDP has fully recovered and then some to pre-pandemic levels. But more surprising is that all the goods and services produced in Q2 of this year were produced with 4.4% fewer workers than was the case in Q4 of 2019, as measured by nonfarm payrolls. Productivity has been soaring in recent quarters. With workers in short supply in some industries, companies have a greater incentive to invest in labor saving technologies. That seems to be an unexpected silver lining to the pandemic. When workers were lining up to be hired at an low wages there was much less interest in finding ways to increase worker productivity. Consider that the productivity boom of the late 1990s coincided with tight labor markets and rising real wages without runaway inflation."
Big props to “S”! Thousands of shareholders and only S hasa post. Sad. Another fabulous quarter from ROK.Thanks S.
"October 28, 2021--The Board of Directors of Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE: ROK), following its regular review, today declared a quarterly dividend of $1.12 per share on its outstanding common stock, payable December 10, 2021 to shareowners of record at the close of business on November 15, 2021.

"September 14, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE: ROK) and Ansys (NASDAQ: ANSS) today announced that the enhanced Studio 5000 Simulation Interface now connects with Ansys digital twins. This gives automation and process engineers new ways to use simulation to improve the design, deployment, and performance of industrial operations.""Connecting the digital and physical worlds with Studio 5000 Simulation Interface creates tremendous value for users,"" said Shane Emswiler, senior vice president of products, Ansys. ""It can help them go from conceptual designs to physical equipment faster and at a lower cost. It can provide useful new insights during production. For instance, users can apply what-if scenarios to understand the impact of changes on a process. They can create virtual sensors to estimate values that are otherwise too expensive or not possible to get today, and they can predict outcomes like failures that hurt the bottom line.""The Studio 5000 Simulation Interface allows users to connect a digital twin to either an emulated or physical controller. Connecting to an emulated controller can help them optimize production at the design stage before they have a physical controller or equipment. Connecting to a physical controller allows them to create a digital twin of how the equipment should run and compare it against actual performance."
"adding to my position today. More robots and automation in store for the future, and Rockwell is a champion in automation."
Consistently creeping higher. Looks like a buyout target...
"They beat estimates and upped guidance, and the stock tanks. What am I missing?"
