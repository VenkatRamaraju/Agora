Did you listen to the call? The cut of employee pay and year end bonus propelled the quarter well above expectations. No one knows what the future holds.

"Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature approved a measure aimed at retroactively shielding paint makers from liability after a billionaire owner of a lead producer contributed $750,000 to a political group that provided crucial support to Walker and Republicans in recall elections, according to a report released Wednesday.Citing leaked documents gathered during a now-shuttered investigation into the governor's campaign, the Guardian U.S., an arm of the British newspaper, reported that Harold Simmons, owner of NL Industries, a producer of the lead formerly used in paint, made three donations totaling $750,000 to the Wisconsin Club for Growth between April 2011 and January 2012.Simmons' donations were made before and after Republicans approved two laws helpful to the industry — one in January 2011 and the other in June 2013. The 2013 measure was inserted in a budget bill in the middle of the night despite warnings about its constitutionality.http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2016/09/14/report-lead-paint-makers-helped-gov-walker/90349256The documents confirm earlier reports that Walker solicited millions of dollars for Wisconsin Club for Growth, a group then run by R.J. Johnson, one of his top campaign advisers. The Guardian story says Walker was warned in an email about potential ""red flags"" with Simmons, who died in 2013, including a magazine story that described him as ""Dallas' most evil genius."""

"Just Sold Short 560 shares of ROK at $182.02. This is a Pure Earnings play. ROK reports before market open tomorrow and I think there is significant risk of a bad ER, and a significant sell-off tomorrow as a direct result. This stock is over-valued and there is every reason to expect the ER will be bad. Coronavirus impacts will be felt more on ER's going forward, than in previous months. I think this could get a 5-15% haircut tomorrow and the risk/reward ratio of this Short play is very good."

"September 14, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE: ROK) and Ansys (NASDAQ: ANSS) today announced that the enhanced Studio 5000 Simulation Interface now connects with Ansys digital twins. This gives automation and process engineers new ways to use simulation to improve the design, deployment, and performance of industrial operations.""Connecting the digital and physical worlds with Studio 5000 Simulation Interface creates tremendous value for users,"" said Shane Emswiler, senior vice president of products, Ansys. ""It can help them go from conceptual designs to physical equipment faster and at a lower cost. It can provide useful new insights during production. For instance, users can apply what-if scenarios to understand the impact of changes on a process. They can create virtual sensors to estimate values that are otherwise too expensive or not possible to get today, and they can predict outcomes like failures that hurt the bottom line.""The Studio 5000 Simulation Interface allows users to connect a digital twin to either an emulated or physical controller. Connecting to an emulated controller can help them optimize production at the design stage before they have a physical controller or equipment. Connecting to a physical controller allows them to create a digital twin of how the equipment should run and compare it against actual performance."

"Why I love ROK and other companies to booster productivity.Manufacturers and other businesses can sustain and even increase production, even in the services sector, by investing more in technologies that boost productivity. And it's already happening. The Q2 GDP reports shows that the amount of goods and services that were produced was 1% greater than the total amount of goods and services produced in Q4 of 2019, well before the pandemic struck. That is, GDP has fully recovered and then some to pre-pandemic levels. But more surprising is that all the goods and services produced in Q2 of this year were produced with 4.4% fewer workers than was the case in Q4 of 2019, as measured by nonfarm payrolls. Productivity has been soaring in recent quarters. With workers in short supply in some industries, companies have a greater incentive to invest in labor saving technologies. That seems to be an unexpected silver lining to the pandemic. When workers were lining up to be hired at an low wages there was much less interest in finding ways to increase worker productivity. Consider that the productivity boom of the late 1990s coincided with tight labor markets and rising real wages without runaway inflation."

"Very difficult to see ROK not making a big run north. Yo you should really check out awesomeSTO-CKS, they seem on point with their stocks."
So they set a price target 10% over current price take no account of 1.5% dividend and call it a sell ? Great work. What are they buying. I'll stay here.
$300 again and a new all-time high! Next stop is $325 by Q3
Short it
Many more runs down. Just a breather.

Nice start this morning!
The unusual run up by ROKU feels like a set up for a secondary....does ROKU have enough funds or is a secondary needed for expansion into Europe. I have a large holding but want to buy more as it fills the gap to recent highs.

"Apple has 5x Cash On Hand as of Last Quarter Then ROKU Market Cap. IMO Apple has more of an Incentive then Walmart to Buyout ROKU. Over the Weekend The Talk was how Apple dropped The Ball On Streaming And Already Knowing how far behind They are Buying ROKU would Eventually go to Apple vs Walmart Considering Their Cash On Hand Just parked here in The US can Outbid Walmart. Now, I would prefer that ROKU stay on its Own for The Longterm Looking at LONGTERM ROI. What would it take for ROKU to Seriously Consider Going with Apple? 2x, 3x, or 5x Current Market Cap Of ROKU? Personally, I know ROKU Hired The #1 Guy That Handles M&A And If We Get a Deal It is going to be GREAT! However, getting back to The Longterm ROI, ROKU Can Make More Staying On It’s Own And as Nice as a FAST 300% Return from Friday’s Close would be Nice We would be Missing Out 2,5, 10 Years Out On The MEGA ROI’s that Stocks Like ROKU bring Stakeholders Longterm And WHERE Would You Put The Proceeds on That 3x Buyout Because There are NO OTHER ROKU’s and that’s what Should Be Questioning Stakeholders? Another Option for The KNOWN Companies that want to Buyout ROKU is to just Take A STAKE In ROKU STOCK & Get a Seat At The Table Following SEC REG’s And Get The Longterm ROI While Having The Integration Into The ROKU PLATFORM run seamlessly. Why Close The Barn Doors While The Horses Are Out Running? Either Way The Horses Will Be Back To The Barn And as Long As They Have That They Are Taken Care Of. I believe the Analogies are Easy to Understand. Another Question is out there right now “IF” ROKU Should Go PRIVATE Like DELL Did? There is just Soo Much Talk Out There now with “What If’s” Scenarios And That’s The BEAUTY OF HOLDING THIS GEM AS THEY ALL END WELL FOR ROKU Which has Signaled The Sidelines Money That It’s Better To Get LONG Now and not Miss Out On Anything Because a Day Like Friday can happen Many Times Over at ANYTIME........ Even Today? I Hope Everyone Had A GREAT WEEKEND and CONGRATULATIONS LONGS & ROKU!!!!!!!!!!.!!!!"

oops wrong forum. I thought this was ROKU
Seems all the great American companies are being acquired by the world. When you have substandard leaders it leaves a gap for the world to take advantage of the weak minds. Sad part is probably most of this will be funded by cheap central bank debt partially funded by US federal reserve system to keep interest rates low.

Their forecasted range of sales growth seems very ambitious given arithmetic mean annual revenue growth over the last 5 years is negligible. So where am I wrong?
