https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ollie-bargain-outlet-celebrates-opening-133000472.html
Still the same OLLI ...look for snap back next week. New highs in January
"This is simply a growth story from a very well run, financially healthy company with a huge and loyal national customer base that will only get bigger with the new stores. These people know exactly what they’re doing."
I bought 1k at 54.50 back a couple days after earnings. Then when it retested 54.50 three weeks ago I bought another 1k. Just sold half at 64.50. Made 10k in 6wks and I’ll hold the other half till after holiday and sell at 74 and pocket 30k. I also made a mill in five below Making money in retail is easy if you know what you’re doing.
$80 by July
"Watch the Biography of Ollies and you will be hooked. Amazon is taking over the world.... REALLY?People are curious by nature. Ollies peaks that curiosity. What discontinued items do they have for me today?People love to shop. But they don't have the money to afford the Malls. :(Going into Ollies gives you the same RUSH of dopamine on products you can afford.I LOVE Bed Bath and Beyond.... Even with coupons in hand I walk out without a purchase. I have never walked out of OLLIES without buying something. Sure, one time it was potato sticks....but it was still a purchase. Ollies closed 7/1/15 @$19.62Do you really think after 4 years of growth they aren't worth $58.40, today's close?Close your eyes and BUY. In a few years, open them to the realization that you are now a MILLIONAIRE*.(*millionaire status is dependent on amount of shares purchased. Duh, 100 shares won't make you a millionaire.)"
"40% same store sales increase is AWESOME. New highs this week. Thank you Ollie's leadership team, honoring founder this way."
Can someone explain why my options are jumping up high for no reason for price action
Here we go again...Another 52 week high today? Big boys will be getting positioned before earnings and guidance. I expect other analyst to start following ollies and more buy ratings after this CC.....
HERE IS MY FULL BULLISH THESIS ON OLLIES!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXfowb6qLuA
Target crushes it. Ollies will too when they post numbers. New stores opening fast and I do believe one opens today. They will probably over shoot my $110 PT on earnings and guidance. Great retail stock for any economy.
Closing in on the 52 week high. Great retail company. Watch the Kramer interview. Can't wait till they put up a store in my area.
"52 Week LOW. Things are terrible, But OLLIES' is opening NEW stores. What other Company opens new stores when their business model is failing. Ollies is being compared to with other failing companies. Find an Ollies, look at the parking lot. Look at the customers shopping carts. This is the time to be BUYING!"
I understand Ollie's is continuing to open new stores during the pandemic which is extremely rare for a retailer but what is going on today up 12%? Wow.
Down because DLTR or DG warned of supply chain costs rising and difficulty getting items.
"this stock is on the rise. when the ceo boldly states midway thru Q3 that the comp will bounce back from negative comps in Q2, take it to the bank! Thanks for the tip Butler!"
Why down 5
"Peer group, ie discount retailers are on fire! customers love to save money and the treasure hunt experience.Guaranteed mid $70 by next earnings call!"
After listening to conf call bought 67.80
Big news for Ollies https://www.seibertron.com/transformers/news/ollies-rumoured-to-get-massive-transformers-overstock-for-2018-holiday-season/41539/
Needing to plan to buy more shares. I suppose at this point any entry point is good. My fear is that the shares are overbought. Opinion?
Good quarter...I am sure it will reach new highs in a few months...
"Not sure why this stock has such a large short position, but after absolutely crushing it with the pre-announcement, I'm sure glad I'm not one of them!"
"Good news for OLLI: OLLI IS A BUY:The AnalystBank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Jason Haas maintained a Buy rating on Ollie's Bargain with a price target lowered from $110 to $75.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Bradley Thomas maintained at Overweight, price target lowered from $110 to $90.BofA: Q2 A 'Rare Execution Misstep'Ollie's second-quarter miss is a function of a ""rare execution misstep,"" Haas said in a Thursday note. Comps fell 1.7% versus expectations of 2.5% growth. The retailer attributed the big miss to cannibalization from new stores and supply chain issues at distribution centers. The company was also negatively impacted by cold and wet weather throughout May.Other negative readouts from the quarter include a 194-basis point drop in gross margins and an 80-basis point decline in merchandise margins, the analyst said. Encouragingly, Ollie's said it is ""pleased"" with its performance in August, and new store openings remain on track at a mid-teens growth rate, he said. The long-term growth story remains unchanged, although the company is ""less deserving"" of a premium multiple exiting Wednesday's report, according to BofA. KeyBanc: Guidance Remains StrongOllie's management revised its 2019 full-year EPS outlook lower from $2.16 to a range of $1.96 to $2, which is disappointing — but the company remains in a ""healthy position"" to gain market share over the long term, Thomas said in a Wednesday note.Ollie's has a path to operating 950 stores throughout the U.S. and generating longer-term 1% to 2% comp growth, 17% to 20% annual EPS growth and flat-to-slightly higher margins, the analyst said. View more earnings on OLLIDespite a concerning second-quarter print, the company has shown ""strong consistency"" in margins, new store economics and sales results since its July 2015 IPO, he said.Ollie's ""cyclically insulated business model"" remains unchanged and adds another positive element to the stock, Thomas said. Finally, Ollie's stock is likely to remain rangebound until it can demonstrate improved results, especially against a difficult fourth-quarter comparison, according to KeyBanc."
Looks like it's going to reach my first price target even before earnings. That sets us up for another 10% upside on earnings and CC news. Only pennies from hitting my $100. target as i post this.....Very strong stock...
retails exploding again. Ollie's is in The Sweet spot in any market. very undervalued. $105 price Target
"Listened to bout first quarter of CC ... some bits from it ... $100 million stock buyback over next 2 years authorized ... 42-44 store openings target for 2019; this is up from 36-38, in past ... no debt ... Ollie's Army up to 9 million members; last number I sort of remember was around 8 million"
Olli could be 200$ in 4 years
"Whether we want to admit it or not, the trade war is going to land punches on retail. Discount stores ($FIVE $TJX $GO $OLLI $DLTR $DG) can thrive in environments like this. Wholesale like $COST will likely be fine as well. You're rolling the dice on anything else though."
"If not for today’s market news, OLLI likely would rise. It may still, but I’ll continue to add if not. Too good of an opportunity."
"Very strong stock. New 52 week as I post this, and that's in a down market. Expect another 10% or so on earnings and CC. Options think so too. Ollies not affected even if there would be a short term trade war, and I thinkit would actually be good for this company..."
Back to new highs
"Earnings for retailer were in most cases very good. Especially for the discount retailers. Ollies is in the sweet spot for ANY market cycle and are just starting their buildout. The stores I've been to or drove by lately are very busy, and seem to have a Great X-MAS merchandise and lots of toys to sell. Since the market has oversold the retailers for NO reason, they will comeback strong about the time Ollies comes out with their blowout earnings. (JMHO) Great company and great business plan."
"OOOPS--I forgot that I posted 3 weeks ago that I bought OLLI at $41-$43 last March, and today I said that I bought them at $33. Its hard to keep track of my virtual shares."
"They preannounced holiday sales last Year around this time, was hoping for it this year"
Funny how absolutely no one is interested in this hidden gem.
keep going... I'm almost at my break even.. it's been a long wait!
"as a blue collar middle income earner, my tax refund is much larger than last year thanks to new tax structure, should be big boost to retailers in first half of this year. just go to tax calculator and plug in some numbers to see the big difference between thus year and last year, not sure thus is being factored in by wall street"
This will come back. My wife and I shop at the Ollie’s in Madison Al. Always extremely busy.
"Sorry Travis, but being short is not the play here. This stock is going higher. Bought at 60 today."
The most oversold stock I’ve almost ever seen. It was oversold yesterday...today makes it an incredible bargain. See you @. $62-$64 within 10 days or less.
Back to long term hold...stable model in all economies
Its not so Bad results this drop is fear
"OLLI (the stock) has been held back for, imho, a couple reasons. Coronavirus....I doubt it. Same-store sales (i.e., comps) percentage declination and being negative....I think so. Possible over-extension of expansion plans and the perception of having inadequate financial coverage to support those plans...could be. General malaise with retail-related stocks....probably. At this time, OLLI stock is a ""falling knife"" which you shouldn't try to catch unless you have a long-term horizon. At some 22x earnings, OLLI isn't exactly cheap for a retailer, but I think better times will come. One thing more disturbing is that Ollie's seems to be raising prices on their merchandise where the bargains aren't quite bargains as they once were (this according to my wife who frequently shops there). I want to buy some OLLI stock, but i think lower prices are ahead. That's just my opinion."
"Ollie said they initiated stock repurchase program in Q2, hope that will give price some support"
I will buy more at $55-57.
Great company! Huge growth. I’m in big now for a 10-bagger!
dow down big 2 days in a row. Ollie's up 2 days in a row.
I'm very excited that OLLI is $100! Now all I need is for it to go to $400 and it will make up for my losses shorting GME at $4 twice in August. I'm not worried. I know more about retail than Michael Burry.
this is way oversold. the only reason they're down is because they are expanding faster than expected. this is going to be some very easy money buying in this morning at the Lows.
I’m very optimistic. Sympathy oversell+temporary market sell vs store expansion in time for Christmas = much higher pps going forward.

looking into the shorts / 18% !! - this could b the perfect MEME Stock lol / excellent fundamentals - I’m very confortable w this investment. Regardless the drop - painful but don’t need the money now .
"Last night Cramer said to his viewing audience - don't buy OLLI. Accordingly, immediately after he spoke those words, I bought shares of OLLI."
"About 2 weeks away, but I think they will even beat this guidance. Store near me is ALWAYS busy....https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ollies-bargain-issues-q2-view-114711935.html"
"This is a over reaction. Ollie's will be fine, especially this last quarter with Christmas. They have outstanding toy section compared to other local stores.. Good time to buy more on the dip."
I went to our local Ollie's last weekend and was like a kid in a candy store! Bought a few ceramic pots that were incredibly priced at only $7.99 and $9.99. I saw the exact same thing at Lowe's for $25 & $32. I love going in to see what bargains i can find. I always walk out with something. Now a proud member of Ollie's Army!
Summer 2021 this will be trading close to a new all time high
What do you guys think? Does it really deserve a 14% drop? Isn’t it too excessive?
The stores have always looked a mess like the old time salvage stores. If you are willing to risk your health you may find a bargain. The one I go to should after Christmas have a bull dozer come in with a bulldozer and push #$%$ to the parking lot and sell it by the pound. A quarter a pound would clean it up. The re is no evidence of an aged goods liquidation program . Go into any store that has been open for more than three years and have a look. No payroll is their secret. Run ads without merchandise coverage and you always hear we just sold out. I bought this on the IPO and sold around 80. I would say there is a day of reckoning coming that will take it down below 30. No store up keep. No floor payroll. Assortment is feeling the pinch. Cheap rent and low payroll
Hard to believe that Morgan Stanley issued a Hold rating and a $63 price target. Really?
"my takeaways after going through OLLI annual & quarterly reports 1, facing significant supply issue due to the pandemic. inventory increased, account payable decreased, probably paying cash for product2, double whammy of end of economic stimulus and decreased demand for PPE3, significant down side risk with little/no margin of safety. even after 50% drop from all time high, still higher than historical highs 4, insiders have been selling"
Ollies Bargain Outlet Price Target Raised to $84.00/Share From $70.00 by JP Morgan
"I've looked around but it's hard to find a retailer that has better stock returns than OLLI, as well as the future growth potential that this company provides. I'm definitely going to be adding to my position, which is only 600 shares currently. This seems to be one of those under the radar stocks that we are early in right now. Glad I found it!"
Wonder why it’s dropping today.Seems like a good time to pick some shares up!
GOOD BREAKING NEWS !!!8/30/2019 Morgan Stanley maintain Price Target $70.00 on OLLI today.
I said a long time ago this is the stock that will do well in any market but it's specially in the market we're in now. there's going to be a lot of retail stores that go bankrupt and Ali's will be there to buy the merchandise for pennies on the dollar. if you don't listen to me and just held or bought more you would have made a ton of money. this is just like a dollar store it's going to keep going up and up and up especially in a turbulent market like this.
Thanks to the ANALyst the downgraded them today. I just bought more. Can't wait for earningsand CC.....
"Reports Q2 (Jul) earnings of $0.52 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.55; revenues fell 21.4% year/year to $415.88 mln vs the $434.6 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Comparable store sales decreased -28.0%, resulting in a two-year stack of positive +15.3%. Co guides to Q3 (Oct) comp growth of +5-7%. Co does not provide full guidance due to pandemic impact.""We continue to face strong year-over-year comparisons in the third quarter as we, once again, delivered record sales and profits last year"
"Great conf. call, paid down over 100$ million debt this year, and stated the remaining 40$mill will be paid off this year, so they will be debt free, and stated starting next year cash would be returned to shareholders either thru buybacks or other means."
Bought a little OLLI today @53 Seems to be oversold. Can't find many stocks you can say that about lately.
Consensus Target is $82.84.OLLI is a BUY today.
"even in this terrible market, Ollie's is green again today. wouldn't be surprised to see another new 52-week high by end of day."
Are the earnings coming out after the bell on 9/5 or 9/4?
earnings and conference call next week. once again they will beat estimates and probably once again raise guidance. the discount retailers like this are in The Sweet spot in any type of market.
"Well, I hold Olli as a swing trade account and I was in my local Tampa Bay area store. Business as usual folks. Tuesday around 5, and every time I cruised by the check out area, two lines 7 to 8 people in each line. I'm not sure what the deal is with the decline in price, but my local store is fine. Just thought I'd share that info."
"Ollies entering Texas market, East Texas city of Marshall first location, i think they will do very very well there!"
Bought 100 shares in Ah at $68.
Opening one store a week
"Notes from conference call that caught my attention. Forward looking statement. They expect slower growth for the rest of the year. Goal of 40% gross margin. In Q3 already opened 4 stores. Lesser inventory on hand. Response by management is that leaner inventory is not effecting stores and is part of their plan making the floor 'fresher'. They have a lot of merchandise to purchase and seeing those very well. Goal is still 40% on gross margin. 20 of 21 categories were positive. Only category negative from previous year was luggage which was understood by less travel. Slow down is expected as more retailers come online and open up. They did sell out of yard seasonal items faster than previous years due to stronger demand. All 4 regions performed well. Management is excited about all categories. For Christmas they see heaters and holidays categories which are seasonal they see as going to be strong. They do not see any real change in competition even with all liquidations of other retailers. They paid $4 mil in premium pay which was $1.50 to front line employees which has since stopped. They are not forecasting anything though. Sales did accelerate from mid teens to high teens. They like less in store merchandise so it is easier to shop, but if they can buy more, they will store it in warehouses. Want to keep stores 'fresher'."
It usually drops a bit after earnings
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ollies-bargain-olli-could-140002334.html
Just a great long term hold . Nice niche and big store expansion. I shopped there and saw something for everyone to buy from cheap food to lawn furniture
"I backed up the truck here at $72.50, I'm all in!"
RECORD EARNINGS....https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ollie-bargain-outlet-holdings-inc-201000046.html.
Can see share price recovering over coming week...
"Perspective: at $57 a share, Ollie’s has exactly tripled in 5 years (+200 percent), far outpacing overall market gains. Not sure if this is bullish or bearish but it’s worth noting."
"Barrons on Ollie:The company said its fourth quarter-to-date same-store sales were in the low-single digits, a big sequential deceleration. That was the main impetus for Goldman Sachs analyst Chandni Luthra, who downgraded the shares to Neutral from Buy and cut her price target to $95 from $122. ...... While it may be a good strategy to underpromise and overdeliver when it comes to the key holiday season, with investors scrambling for evidence that pandemic winners can hold on to their gains going forward, cautious outlooks are less welcome this year."

"This is a low float stock, so it moves either way rapidly, but I like that, and the fundamentals are superb. I really like the business plan in times like these. people always looking for a good deal."
"They missed their revenue numbers, and guidance was mostly weak, and yet the stock is up. Maybe I should buy more stocks like this before earnings, because if they crush the estimates it will go up, and if they miss like this, it will still go up."
Not the typical retailer. Buy!
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-best-stocks-buy-earnings-135201283.html
Opening new stores which are in black after a year. Buy some shares at $85
No support now t0 $49 and then $39. Not looking good.
"Boom ... back to 80sTotal net sales increased 15.3% to $327.0 million. Comparable store sales decreased 1.4% compared to a 4.6% increase in the prior year.The Company opened 13 stores during the quarter, ending the period with a total of 345 stores in 25 states, a 16.2% year-over-year increase in store count.Operating income increased 22.0% to $35.7 million.Net income increased 8.6% to $27.0 million and net income per diluted share increased 7.9% to $0.41.Adjusted net income(1) increased 28.3% to $26.8 million and adjusted net income per diluted share(1) increased 28.1% to $0.41.Adjusted EBITDA increased 22.5% to $42.6 million.The Company repurchased $40.0 million of its common stock in the third quarter of fiscal 2019."
Good quarter..think it is wise to hold this for awhile.
Will hit mid $50s this month
"WOW,, I don't see any news. Anyone know what's up? (Other than the share price. LOL)"
Stocks don't drop 8-10% on that type of headline news. There must be more to this departure story that is not being disclosed until the earnings report and conference call. The longer-term impact causes uncertainty and in this stock market environment investors bail at the moment there becomes uncertainty.
Zacks gave them a strong buy today.
"7th time playing/trading OLLI, first-time bagholder. Paid $84.50, now at $66. I will hold, but won't average down. Today was a huge miss, and I wouldn't be surprised if tomorrow brings downgrades."
"Big Lots has a little over 1400 stores, seems like Ollies could too. Ceo said Tuesday nay have new study done to update the 950 store count figure, he said he thought 950 was light."
"Kind of hope Mark Butler reads this stuff ... trying to say something to him via Investor Relations or the ""PresidentCEO"" link in Ollie's website is useless ... he REALLY needs to take heed of what the front line troops are saying about working @ Ollie's (Glassdoor,etc) - NOT good ... front line troops are so critical and with Ollie's growth trajectory such becomes even more important... hope some analysts, next week, are VERY vocal on this point ... also, still a bit uneasy re consistent product supply, given expected company growth."
"This is a silly valuation, forward PE of 15 for a company growing 15%+ a year!!! Block out the noise and keep averaging in, OLLI has 10 bagger potential!!!"
"Just left one of their Nashville stores and it's ""packed"" with new selections of varied inventory for the holiday season and there were plenty of shoppers, as always. I feel he stock will hit $100.00 before Christmas. Just y gut feeling. Happy trading!"

Fidelity increased their position in OLLI last quarter..
"Dec. 17, 2018 low was $61/sh.................I bought a few hundred shares today."
Been an investor in OLLI for several years. Sold when it was $97 thinking I could pick up at a lower price. But as others have mentioned something is not right with the stock. Just keeps falling even after an analyst upgrade. I tried taking a position in the mid $50's. I'm not a technician but noticed there seemed to be support at $53. I decided as long as it held $53 I would stay in. Well it appears to me it's broken support so I sold most of my shares. Will keep it on my watch list possibly buying back as we get close to ER. To those who remain long understand I have on occasion sold stock at the bottom so maybe you can thank me later. GLTA
Stephens analyst maintains strong buy and 100$ target
"Will be green tomorrow. Blowout numbers and Great call. Unemployed still getting $400 per week more than suppose to, and TRUMP signing that payroll tax holiday will give a Big boost every paycheck for at least the rest of this year."
A super long term hold! Just buy it and put it away
"Something isn't quite right with the house Ollie built. I think the business model has deteriorated in the past year or so. """"Bargains"" don't seem to be quite as available as they once were. 10-20% off doesn't cut with a brick-and-mortar store, especially one which sells ""close out"" items. My understanding is that they purchased a lot of inventory from the nearly-defunct Toys-R-Us business and they did not take fully take advantage of the pre-Christmas sales of these items, leaving them with quite a bit of inventory. They continue to sell non-perishable, food-related items which are near or past their expiration date and no one is willing to buy those. The stores do not utilize their space efficiently (look at the rugs/carpets which occupy a great deal of real estate), and their stores are generally disorganized. It gives the appearance of being a flea market. On top of this, I believe they are expanding too quickly."
goin green
I never sold. Worth holding long term.
Big beat!
"Just so you know, this is how Ollie's works. It will go lower, usually a few bounces lower before it goes up again. I have bought and sold this stock numerous times and made money, but you have to understand the way it -- trends--. If you can't be comfortable and have patience, this is not the stock for you. GLT"
It’s a great store. Some friends in Worcester ma are loyal shoppers and it’s only been open a year
"@stocks. They are not looking to get bought out. They are opening 40 more stores in 2021 with 40 more in 2022. They just got into TX 8 stores and I know of a new one in Hurst by march. They do not do anything online and they plan on keeping it that way, They are a better shop then other discount stores. I think they are going to put big lots out. Also they have no problem going up next to a family dollar or dollar gen. I do think its a long term play as they will have 1,000 stores in 7 years. I do think they will have growing pains because of the fast growth. Logistics and warehouses most likely."
"An unexpected pleasure. I'm back in OLLI at $30.77. Of course, every stock is on sale right now. I shop Ollie's frequently and as Darlene said, it is business as usual. The loss of their long time CEO was a shock and the corona virus is another shock. The good news is OLLI remains a strong force in their market and their most recognizable competitor (Big Lots) is on the ropes. I look forward to holding as OLLI continues to open stores, ever westward, for a long time."
"Today after hours Zoom reported a huge 3-beat (top line, bottom line, and increased forecast), yet their stock price fell 5% AH. OLLI needs to deliver blowout numbers and increase forward forecast."
Crazy price reaction. Stores are profitable in two years after opening …opening a lot of new stores…ollies army members up…no shortage of quality inventory. Company was doing great prior to pandemic. If you can wait a year you will make 50% on your money.
I’m think about starting a long term position in this one. Been watching for about a year and this looks like some short term headwinds with expanding so fast. These new stores will create bundles of new revenue and profits.
"PE ratio is still far too high especially given the miss. It will take at least two quarters to gain back confidence. Should trade in the mid to high 40’s before rebounding into the 50’s. I may take a nibble this week to start a position. Long term, a good story if they can execute. Taking over toys boxes is very risky and in this economy, things can change very fast on the ugly side if you are not careful with expansion plans.I worked at a high level for a world class retailer and their stock went from 30 to 9, even though things looked good from the outside. Managing new store openings while minimizing cannibalization is like walking through a mine field. I don’t think the leadership is strong in this area..."
"here comes the upgrades ...Analyst Actions: RBC Boosts Price Target on Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings to $76 From $69, Maintains Outperform Rating"
holiday sales from different sources say it was much better than expected.
It is beginning its run...It is amazing that each store opened becomes profitable and paid for after 12 months
"Ollie Senior VP of Supply Chain departure announced. I don't currently own OLLI but it's on my watch list. If it weren't for the stock market rolling over on inflation numbers, I would be tempted to buy at $85. Anyone know if this was a firing?"
Why is it down so much today? Only thing I could think of is that the retail sector is down. Olli share price fluctuates a lot.
"OLLI has 48% EPS growth, Price Target $85. Wow."
Cramer went bullish on OLLI just now.
Ha we’re all the way back from where we were before earnings were released. So glad I sold at $68.
$105 PT. going into earnings and especially guidance and updates on upcoming CC. Locked and loaded. GLTAL's..
They missed across the board. No good at all.
"This is really bad. I sold prior to earnings, but feel sorry for the stock holders. If you can get out without a huge loss I suggest you do. Otherwise it's going to be a few years of bag holding."
"Some higher end retailers already filing for BK. Ollies can pick up some higher end merchandise for pennies on the dollar, and this is something that will continue for quite awhile, and will be a Boon for Ollies and it's army....."
Recession or weak economy this company should do well right ??
"As I warned, Ollie needed a 3-beat, revs EPS and forecast. They failed to deliver the 3-beat, and in this stock market environment, you get punished severely. Look no further than what happened to Zoom and their growth rates crush Ollie. Next, expect analysts to lower price targets. OLLI stock is toast for months. Perhaps Hold s I will do, but do not invest more here. Plenty of other stocks in my portfolio running wild. Everyone remain diversified. GLTA"
Great quarter and great expansion plans
"If shorts want a reference, take a look at BIG's earnings pop. It is a 3 day climb to consolidation level. You dont cover now, you can cover at higher price tomorrow and Friday."
I don’t understand the reason behind the price. Are they expecting horrible results?
After Hours selloff calmed and is recovering. Let's hope all the analysts maintain their buy ratings and raise target prices as a reward for a great backwards looking quarter.

"Why Coronavirus is good for Ollie’s:1.Companies may be forced to cut prices to clear product, which is deflationary and not favorable to profit margins (and profits).2. Unsold inventory raises the potential for working capital issues. In other words, badly needed cash may be trapped in stores and warehouses.3. Companies may face solvency issues if they cannot clear inventory quickly enough. That could trigger a ripple effect throughout credit mark4. Ollie’s buys inventory on the cheap"
4 days in a row
Cramer said look for another great quarter when they report next week
nice rebound today. Hopefully their earnings exceed expectations
"Good news for fellow burned Ollie longs - next week stock performance, even if down, will be better than today. Nice weekend to all."
Are we ready to see $89 this week?
Opening stores rapidly. They would not be doing this if they could not fill them with inventory
"@Bubba ... a couple of questions ... would you think the potential for ""periods of lesser product availability"", given the nature of OLLI's current business model, a possible OLLI weakness, particularly when considered within the context of it's expansion trajectory? ... and, if so, have you ever heard OLLI talk about how it expects to evolve and whether there would be new facets to the business that would help to lessen the effects of periods of lesser product availability?"
my broker said it dropped 3$ after hours but here its still only .37...why?
Revenue $283 MillionEarnings Per Share 0.38
"I think Peter Lynch would buy Ollie at this price. In "" One Up on Wall Street"", he says these fast growers, eps growth 20-50percent, little debt, good management, regional to national, and PE ratio less than growth rate, are some of his favorites and were multibaggers for him."
"We visited several stores that opened within the last month, all crowded. But what struck me was several other customers just commented to me out of the blue that this was a neat store, little bit of everything with great prices"
Buy some shares this morning
"If the analyst price targets, which range from $59-$70, are 12-month targets, they are definitely too low for OLLI. I'm thinking more like $80-85 this time next year...we'll see."
85 in quick time
I wanted a weighted blanket for my daughter today.Management made that happen.The comment was casual.Management in central Pennsylvania is above average.The store was packed.
I recognize an oversold bargain when I see one...especially in light of such a positive recent quarterly report. Just added this to our retirement Roth IRA.
"I bought 300 shares at $79, sad : ("
Just like I said.... Now next week it will probably start a downtrend for awhile as investors lock in profits. Will watch for re-entry in the low 80's.
any word on why Ollie's is up so much?
"Shorts! The longer you hold...The more you'll lose.... & ... The more you average down, the higher it goes. Cover and go long."
"Beat earnings, excellent management, conservative outlook, great margins and the stock goes down. Uncanny."
"I've owned shares (mid 40s) from way before covid and will continue to hold; think the past 1 1/2 year pandemic frenzy and fed cares act $$$ perks could be considered significant factors in Olli growth. Also believe store expansion a key to the (unforeseen) supply chain strain (a to common theme in just about every industry today). SP could see a mid 50s handle before the clouds abate, then a new normal. I shop at Ollies"
"Should have bought OLLI pre market at 65, but you never know!"
OLLI is not at all like Dollar stores
Sorry for those who bought at $100 plus. I was in last year when the price kept sliding after the news of the founder died; I held on like 5 months until it recovered and some. Just hold on. Olli ain't going away.
"Long term regional to national classic Peter Lynch growth story, we have 270 or so stores now on way to 1000, and new stores are outperforming, i think because the south and midwest really likes bargains."
Not much of a bump from upcoming earnings ...my prediction all good news is in stock price
This was down 6.66% today. That does not bode well!￼￼
Supply chain challenges. Seems a lot of retailers are reporting this.
Tis a gift nothing about the business model has changed!
Ollie's is now up to 400 stores. And is sitting on a lot of cash with no debt.
"guys 25 percent of the stock is short. They have to cover this within 13 days, stay tight and good luck"
"New highs coming. Next earnings will again beat easily, and they will probably raise guidance once again. This company will be a star in any economy.."
Ollie vs Big lots....327 stores vs 1400 PE 24 vs 4.. EPS 2.14 vs 6.47.. Div O vs 4.40 %.. 53.00pps vs 27.00 pps....what am i missing...thks
stealth accumulation going on as funds seem to be positioning themselves before earnings run.
"I took a small gamble today, bought some 84.50 shares. Now watch that risk backfire in the days ahead."
Is the coast clear now? There was just one bad OLLI quarter (the one before this one) and now all is okay? Looks that way to me. I like the Ollie's story and am hoping this is a long term play for me. But I don't want to fall in love with it.

"Until they shake out as many shares as possible this will not end. Could go down into the mid 60s ebven if it gets 2 or 3 up grades. Just how the big boys do it. Olli's upped every number, every metric for the next 15 months. Also, it appears this will be the best retail Christmas in 20 years."
"New quarterly report shows decline in revenue, end of YoY revenue growth since 2013."
OLLI - Love the nice steady increase. I just bought more today...looking forward to a good earnings report!
My biggest fear was shortage of product
Stopped into an Ollie’s in Worcester MA. Not too busy but busier than other stores that remain open. Well stocked with food and essentials. Prices are 30% below competitors ...much better atmosphere and selection than dollar stores for sure
$67 by summer
If AEO and ANF can go up big then OLLI should be up $10 after earnings. I understand different company but I can assure you more people are shipping at Olli's then those 2 retail stores in the malls. OLLI has been punished for no reason. I think this has a lot op upside after earnings. I just bought in.
"If you have never been to one of these stores, try it. Customers in every isle, great prices, a large variety of product. On the other hand, product is poorly organized and displayed. Only reason I could see why management would ever say foot traffic would be down during the Christmas season is to lower expectations and over deliver. You can probably make money with a side hustle purchasing and reselling products from these stores."
Not much to dislike on this release. Be nice if they would have provided guidance going forward but that has been the norm for them since Covid started.
time to add more. their strategy and mgmt team are rock solid.
Will be $80 by December
"Hahahahaha! I'm RICH!!!!!BLEW OUT THE QUARTER! COMPS UP 8.8%!EPS 0.97, Consensus was 0.85!Of course I said the same thing last night after the FIVE report and it was down $8 today. But I know retail!"
$120 this week
"Buy! Fifty two week low for no fundamental reason. Their supply chain is much different than most all other retailers. They are not China dependent for product. They buy bankrupt inventories, overstocks, close outs..."
someone knows something that they keep selling off. day after day for the last month.
Stores still open. I think with all the store closings company will have a lot of inventory and sales.
