Seen this action play out so many times in other companies......whenever ive seen these huge selloffs you can expect the sell pressure to last a couple of days beyond the initial day....the stock should begin to rebound next week so now is when you buy as we all know this company is rock solid and this was probably a one off miss......
"this stock is on the rise. when the ceo boldly states midway thru Q3 that the comp will bounce back from negative comps in Q2, take it to the bank! Thanks for the tip Butler!"
holiday sales from different sources say it was much better than expected.
"They missed their revenue numbers, and guidance was mostly weak, and yet the stock is up. Maybe I should buy more stocks like this before earnings, because if they crush the estimates it will go up, and if they miss like this, it will still go up."
"The chart shows a clear double bottom break at $60....with about $2+ EPS....it is a sell until it gets over $60, IMO. Nice to see a Cramer favorite destroyed too!@"
"Whether we want to admit it or not, the trade war is going to land punches on retail. Discount stores ($FIVE $TJX $GO $OLLI $DLTR $DG) can thrive in environments like this. Wholesale like $COST will likely be fine as well. You're rolling the dice on anything else though."
"I've owned shares (mid 40s) from way before covid and will continue to hold; think the past 1 1/2 year pandemic frenzy and fed cares act $$$ perks could be considered significant factors in Olli growth. Also believe store expansion a key to the (unforeseen) supply chain strain (a to common theme in just about every industry today). SP could see a mid 50s handle before the clouds abate, then a new normal. I shop at Ollies"
"This is simply a growth story from a very well run, financially healthy company with a huge and loyal national customer base that will only get bigger with the new stores. These people know exactly what they’re doing."
Just got back from shopping at a local store and they had to open another line as it was busy.
"Many investors miss out on these regional to national growth stories because they see high pe ratio, but if its good story pe will be high, would be too easy if it was low"
Look for good quarter and better outlook ...$70s this week
I recognize an oversold bargain when I see one...especially in light of such a positive recent quarterly report. Just added this to our retirement Roth IRA.
I don't own this stock but I find it very strange that it's going against the market right now.
"This is a low float stock, so it moves either way rapidly, but I like that, and the fundamentals are superb. I really like the business plan in times like these. people always looking for a good deal."
Filled Sell 500 OLLI Market 77.8607 -- -- 10:09:13 08/06/19 This represents a $3500 loss.Imagine if I didn't take that loss?nt
"Something isn't quite right with the house Ollie built. I think the business model has deteriorated in the past year or so. """"Bargains"" don't seem to be quite as available as they once were. 10-20% off doesn't cut with a brick-and-mortar store, especially one which sells ""close out"" items. My understanding is that they purchased a lot of inventory from the nearly-defunct Toys-R-Us business and they did not take fully take advantage of the pre-Christmas sales of these items, leaving them with quite a bit of inventory. They continue to sell non-perishable, food-related items which are near or past their expiration date and no one is willing to buy those. The stores do not utilize their space efficiently (look at the rugs/carpets which occupy a great deal of real estate), and their stores are generally disorganized. It gives the appearance of being a flea market. On top of this, I believe they are expanding too quickly."
"OLLI 's unbelievable with 52 week low, loaded up 25,050 shares for great great profits anytime soon."
Always do opposite of what Cramer says
popped up almost 7% and now even with market close not a good look for tomorrow
It is beginning its run...It is amazing that each store opened becomes profitable and paid for after 12 months
85 in quick time
Good quarter...I am sure it will reach new highs in a few months...
Target crushes it. Ollies will too when they post numbers. New stores opening fast and I do believe one opens today. They will probably over shoot my $110 PT on earnings and guidance. Great retail stock for any economy.
The most oversold stock I’ve almost ever seen. It was oversold yesterday...today makes it an incredible bargain. See you @. $62-$64 within 10 days or less.
I went to our local Ollie's last weekend and was like a kid in a candy store! Bought a few ceramic pots that were incredibly priced at only $7.99 and $9.99. I saw the exact same thing at Lowe's for $25 & $32. I love going in to see what bargains i can find. I always walk out with something. Now a proud member of Ollie's Army!
"Ollies entering Texas market, East Texas city of Marshall first location, i think they will do very very well there!"
Summer 2021 this will be trading close to a new all time high
"7th time playing/trading OLLI, first-time bagholder. Paid $84.50, now at $66. I will hold, but won't average down. Today was a huge miss, and I wouldn't be surprised if tomorrow brings downgrades."
Zacks gave them a strong buy today.
Consensus Target is $82.84.OLLI is a BUY today.
"New quarterly report shows decline in revenue, end of YoY revenue growth since 2013."
Supply chain challenges. Seems a lot of retailers are reporting this.
"Rockport shoes filed fir bankruptcy, hope Ollies can capitalize"
"There keeping it down, only to bid it up after earnings. I'm looking like for a reaction like BIG got."
"They preannounced holiday sales last Year around this time, was hoping for it this year"
GOOD BREAKING NEWS !!!8/30/2019 Morgan Stanley maintain Price Target $70.00 on OLLI today.MEANING it' ll rebound above $65.00 at least in near future !
Fidelity increased their position in OLLI last quarter..
Ollie's Bargain Outlet is down 4.95% to 79.10
"Peer group, ie discount retailers are on fire! customers love to save money and the treasure hunt experience.Guaranteed mid $70 by next earnings call!"
Are the earnings coming out after the bell on 9/5 or 9/4?
OLLIs will have a nice beat.
I hope it open in the red tomorrow AM. I want to buy more.
"Kind of hope Mark Butler reads this stuff ... trying to say something to him via Investor Relations or the ""PresidentCEO"" link in Ollie's website is useless ... he REALLY needs to take heed of what the front line troops are saying about working @ Ollie's (Glassdoor,etc) - NOT good ... front line troops are so critical and with Ollie's growth trajectory such becomes even more important... hope some analysts, next week, are VERY vocal on this point ... also, still a bit uneasy re consistent product supply, given expected company growth."
Buy some shares this morning
Market green and doesn't make sense why this is in RED.
Any one seen any news? The stock value is stretched. Like the up move though. Seeking Alpha called for shorting the stock on Friday.You figure it out.
"Not sure why this stock has such a large short position, but after absolutely crushing it with the pre-announcement, I'm sure glad I'm not one of them!"
I’m very optimistic. Sympathy oversell+temporary market sell vs store expansion in time for Christmas = much higher pps going forward.
Back to new highs
"Stock is down because Wells Fargo downgraded it today accompanied by a new $70 price target, and said it was because it won't be able to replicate the great pandemic sales results which have boosted results this year. Don't necessarily agree with them, but it appears that's what drove the decline today."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-defend-ollies-bargain-disappointing-160730883.html
I wanted a weighted blanket for my daughter today.Management made that happen.The comment was casual.Management in central Pennsylvania is above average.The store was packed.
OLLI - Love the nice steady increase. I just bought more today...looking forward to a good earnings report!
"Well, I hold Olli as a swing trade account and I was in my local Tampa Bay area store. Business as usual folks. Tuesday around 5, and every time I cruised by the check out area, two lines 7 to 8 people in each line. I'm not sure what the deal is with the decline in price, but my local store is fine. Just thought I'd share that info."
Great buy and forget it stock
Incredible to me that people sell at these prices when they should be buying hand over fist. This is a financially very healthy company that is historically priced in the $80-$100 range. This short term growth situation WILL get better. They know what they’re doing.
https://finance.yahoo.com/m/706110be-5f70-3e3c-9318-c3f37947f784/ollie%26%2339%3Bs-shares-are.html?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&yptr=yahoo
Funny how absolutely no one is interested in this hidden gem.
stealth accumulation going on as funds seem to be positioning themselves before earnings run.
"WOW,, I don't see any news. Anyone know what's up? (Other than the share price. LOL)"
"This is really bad. I sold prior to earnings, but feel sorry for the stock holders. If you can get out without a huge loss I suggest you do. Otherwise it's going to be a few years of bag holding."
"This is a over reaction. Ollie's will be fine, especially this last quarter with Christmas. They have outstanding toy section compared to other local stores.. Good time to buy more on the dip."
"If you have never been to one of these stores, try it. Customers in every isle, great prices, a large variety of product. On the other hand, product is poorly organized and displayed. Only reason I could see why management would ever say foot traffic would be down during the Christmas season is to lower expectations and over deliver. You can probably make money with a side hustle purchasing and reselling products from these stores."
"guys 25 percent of the stock is short. They have to cover this within 13 days, stay tight and good luck"
Will hit mid $50s this month
Just a great long term hold . Nice niche and big store expansion. I shopped there and saw something for everyone to buy from cheap food to lawn furniture
Ollie vs Big lots....327 stores vs 1400 PE 24 vs 4.. EPS 2.14 vs 6.47.. Div O vs 4.40 %.. 53.00pps vs 27.00 pps....what am i missing...thks
Time to buy.
"Big Lots has a little over 1400 stores, seems like Ollies could too. Ceo said Tuesday nay have new study done to update the 950 store count figure, he said he thought 950 was light."
Just remarkable how they're beating this down - wall street manipulation at its best
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-cheap-stocks-buy-skyrocket-171841276.html
Been an investor in OLLI for several years. Sold when it was $97 thinking I could pick up at a lower price. But as others have mentioned something is not right with the stock. Just keeps falling even after an analyst upgrade. I tried taking a position in the mid $50's. I'm not a technician but noticed there seemed to be support at $53. I decided as long as it held $53 I would stay in. Well it appears to me it's broken support so I sold most of my shares. Will keep it on my watch list possibly buying back as we get close to ER. To those who remain long understand I have on occasion sold stock at the bottom so maybe you can thank me later. GLTA
Got to love OLLI
Expecting stock to rebound by late next week or early week after to low/mid $60's......growth story still intact so big boys will want to begin loading back up.Anyone posting the stock going much lower is a short......
"Some higher end retailers already filing for BK. Ollies can pick up some higher end merchandise for pennies on the dollar, and this is something that will continue for quite awhile, and will be a Boon for Ollies and it's army....."
"as a blue collar middle income earner, my tax refund is much larger than last year thanks to new tax structure, should be big boost to retailers in first half of this year. just go to tax calculator and plug in some numbers to see the big difference between thus year and last year, not sure thus is being factored in by wall street"
Step up and buy..great price!
"Olli: EPS of 65 cents on revenue of $414.4 million with comp sales up 15.3%., net sales up 25% yoyFIVE: EPS of 35 cents on revenue of $444 million with comp sales up 12.8%, net sales up 26% yoyOLLI Price: $89 at closeFIVE Price : $162 at closeOLLI Market Cap $6 BillionFIVE Market Cap $9 BillionWhich one do YOU want to own?"
"Beat earnings, excellent management, conservative outlook, great margins and the stock goes down. Uncanny."
"If the analyst price targets, which range from $59-$70, are 12-month targets, they are definitely too low for OLLI. I'm thinking more like $80-85 this time next year...we'll see."
"Barrons on Ollie:The company said its fourth quarter-to-date same-store sales were in the low-single digits, a big sequential deceleration. That was the main impetus for Goldman Sachs analyst Chandni Luthra, who downgraded the shares to Neutral from Buy and cut her price target to $95 from $122. ...... While it may be a good strategy to underpromise and overdeliver when it comes to the key holiday season, with investors scrambling for evidence that pandemic winners can hold on to their gains going forward, cautious outlooks are less welcome this year."
Are we ready to see $89 this week?
"Until they shake out as many shares as possible this will not end. Could go down into the mid 60s ebven if it gets 2 or 3 up grades. Just how the big boys do it. Olli's upped every number, every metric for the next 15 months. Also, it appears this will be the best retail Christmas in 20 years."
Cramer went bullish on OLLI just now.
If AEO and ANF can go up big then OLLI should be up $10 after earnings. I understand different company but I can assure you more people are shipping at Olli's then those 2 retail stores in the malls. OLLI has been punished for no reason. I think this has a lot op upside after earnings. I just bought in.
"IMO - CEO lowered the forward guidance bar, which will make it easier for Ollie to exceed expectations next quarter. Longs will take a short-term hit, then gradually recover. Lower price will create a potential buying opportunity. JMHO"
"OLLI should use stock to buy BIG. OLLI would more than double it's earnings while only giving up 25% of the company at current prices. Add in any savings from synergies and purchasing power, and easily transform some Big Lots stores to Ollie's where it makes sense and the earnings would rocket even higher. This seems like a no-brainer to me."
"Ollie said they initiated stock repurchase program in Q2, hope that will give price some support"
Its not so Bad results this drop is fear
Opening new stores which are in black after a year. Buy some shares at $85
https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/ollies-bargain-outlet-delivers-more-double-digit-growth
"Why Coronavirus is good for Ollie’s:1.Companies may be forced to cut prices to clear product, which is deflationary and not favorable to profit margins (and profits).2. Unsold inventory raises the potential for working capital issues. In other words, badly needed cash may be trapped in stores and warehouses.3. Companies may face solvency issues if they cannot clear inventory quickly enough. That could trigger a ripple effect throughout credit mark4. Ollie’s buys inventory on the cheap"
I understand Ollie's is continuing to open new stores during the pandemic which is extremely rare for a retailer but what is going on today up 12%? Wow.
"not much to be excited about here. i covered after hours at $78 from the summer. Optimism imo was wayyyyyy to bulled up on this board then calling for $140 and $150 price targets despite there being minimal growth in ollie's when you take away new store openings. Still i love the company but let's value it more reasonablly now and actually take into account the minimal to no earnings growth in this name. $140 come on guys, get serious, this isn't worth even $100 based on the current state of affairs. it will be probably stay in purgatory till the next earnings call but like i said i covered AH so good luck to you guys who stay or decide to open new positions today ir next week. just my 2 cents"
Just wants to continue the run up!

$105 PT. going into earnings and especially guidance and updates on upcoming CC. Locked and loaded. GLTAL's..
Hard to believe that Morgan Stanley issued a Hold rating and a $63 price target. Really?
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rheos-capital-works-inc-buys-123801389.html
OLLI is not at all like Dollar stores
I have been in this stock for quite a while and will be for long time. very well run company. sit back and watch it run
Great company! Huge growth. I’m in big now for a 10-bagger!
Looks like it's going to reach my first price target even before earnings. That sets us up for another 10% upside on earnings and CC news. Only pennies from hitting my $100. target as i post this.....Very strong stock...
my broker said it dropped 3$ after hours but here its still only .37...why?
"Last night Cramer said to his viewing audience - don't buy OLLI. Accordingly, immediately after he spoke those words, I bought shares of OLLI."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ollies-bargain-olli-could-140002334.html
"If shorts want a reference, take a look at BIG's earnings pop. It is a 3 day climb to consolidation level. You dont cover now, you can cover at higher price tomorrow and Friday."
Wonder why it’s dropping today.Seems like a good time to pick some shares up!
Great company and operating model. I’m buying but holding for 5-10 years
"This would be a good meme stock. 15% short interest of the float and 20% of the AMC market cap, plus profitable. The Reddit crowd could move OLLI up 50% in one week if they wanted to."
My biggest fear was shortage of product
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-best-stocks-buy-earnings-135201283.html
Opening stores rapidly. They would not be doing this if they could not fill them with inventory
"Good news for fellow burned Ollie longs - next week stock performance, even if down, will be better than today. Nice weekend to all."
"Great conf. call, paid down over 100$ million debt this year, and stated the remaining 40$mill will be paid off this year, so they will be debt free, and stated starting next year cash would be returned to shareholders either thru buybacks or other means."
Closing in on the 52 week high. Great retail company. Watch the Kramer interview. Can't wait till they put up a store in my area.
Just like I said.... Now next week it will probably start a downtrend for awhile as investors lock in profits. Will watch for re-entry in the low 80's.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ollies-bargain-outlet-holdings-olli-133001262.html
Looks like it might take a little break and consolidate before continuing it's climb. I think it actually is needed and healthy since it has ran up pretty quickly in a short period of time.
"Ollie Senior VP of Supply Chain departure announced. I don't currently own OLLI but it's on my watch list. If it weren't for the stock market rolling over on inflation numbers, I would be tempted to buy at $85. Anyone know if this was a firing?"
"OLLI has 48% EPS growth, Price Target $85. Wow."
"OOOPS--I forgot that I posted 3 weeks ago that I bought OLLI at $41-$43 last March, and today I said that I bought them at $33. Its hard to keep track of my virtual shares."
In at $60. Good luck to all!
Going to $100!
"40% same store sales increase is AWESOME. New highs this week. Thank you Ollie's leadership team, honoring founder this way."
dow down big 2 days in a row. Ollie's up 2 days in a row.
Not much of a bump from upcoming earnings ...my prediction all good news is in stock price
"I took a small gamble today, bought some 84.50 shares. Now watch that risk backfire in the days ahead."
Why down 5
I never sold. Worth holding long term.
OLLI stock....good stuff cheap!
Stephens analyst maintains strong buy and 100$ target
I’m think about starting a long term position in this one. Been watching for about a year and this looks like some short term headwinds with expanding so fast. These new stores will create bundles of new revenue and profits.
Stores still open. I think with all the store closings company will have a lot of inventory and sales.
"New highs coming. Next earnings will again beat easily, and they will probably raise guidance once again. This company will be a star in any economy.."
Ha we’re all the way back from where we were before earnings were released. So glad I sold at $68.
Still the same OLLI ...look for snap back next week. New highs in January
Good quarter..think it is wise to hold this for awhile.
Bought a little OLLI today @53 Seems to be oversold. Can't find many stocks you can say that about lately.
retails exploding again. Ollie's is in The Sweet spot in any market. very undervalued. $105 price Target
"Watch the Biography of Ollies and you will be hooked. Amazon is taking over the world.... REALLY?People are curious by nature. Ollies peaks that curiosity. What discontinued items do they have for me today?People love to shop. But they don't have the money to afford the Malls. :(Going into Ollies gives you the same RUSH of dopamine on products you can afford.I LOVE Bed Bath and Beyond.... Even with coupons in hand I walk out without a purchase. I have never walked out of OLLIES without buying something. Sure, one time it was potato sticks....but it was still a purchase. Ollies closed 7/1/15 @$19.62Do you really think after 4 years of growth they aren't worth $58.40, today's close?Close your eyes and BUY. In a few years, open them to the realization that you are now a MILLIONAIRE*.(*millionaire status is dependent on amount of shares purchased. Duh, 100 shares won't make you a millionaire.)"
"We visited several stores that opened within the last month, all crowded. But what struck me was several other customers just commented to me out of the blue that this was a neat store, little bit of everything with great prices"
"About 2 weeks away, but I think they will even beat this guidance. Store near me is ALWAYS busy....https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ollies-bargain-issues-q2-view-114711935.html"

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ollie-bargain-outlet-celebrates-opening-133000472.html
Needing to plan to buy more shares. I suppose at this point any entry point is good. My fear is that the shares are overbought. Opinion?
Revenue $283 MillionEarnings Per Share 0.38
I'm very excited that OLLI is $100! Now all I need is for it to go to $400 and it will make up for my losses shorting GME at $4 twice in August. I'm not worried. I know more about retail than Michael Burry.
"Listened to bout first quarter of CC ... some bits from it ... $100 million stock buyback over next 2 years authorized ... 42-44 store openings target for 2019; this is up from 36-38, in past ... no debt ... Ollie's Army up to 9 million members; last number I sort of remember was around 8 million"
"No doubt this today is being hurt by (1) down overall market and (2) Big Lots tanking after report. However, if you have been in these stores, you know this is NOT Big Lots."
Not the typical retailer. Buy!
This company does well in all economies. Super buy with earnings coming out in a month
What do you guys think? Does it really deserve a 14% drop? Isn’t it too excessive?
It usually drops a bit after earnings
"If not for today’s market news, OLLI likely would rise. It may still, but I’ll continue to add if not. Too good of an opportunity."
After Hours selloff calmed and is recovering. Let's hope all the analysts maintain their buy ratings and raise target prices as a reward for a great backwards looking quarter.
Is the coast clear now? There was just one bad OLLI quarter (the one before this one) and now all is okay? Looks that way to me. I like the Ollie's story and am hoping this is a long term play for me. But I don't want to fall in love with it.
"I've looked around but it's hard to find a retailer that has better stock returns than OLLI, as well as the future growth potential that this company provides. I'm definitely going to be adding to my position, which is only 600 shares currently. This seems to be one of those under the radar stocks that we are early in right now. Glad I found it!"
"Just left one of their Nashville stores and it's ""packed"" with new selections of varied inventory for the holiday season and there were plenty of shoppers, as always. I feel he stock will hit $100.00 before Christmas. Just y gut feeling. Happy trading!"
Thanks to the ANALyst the downgraded them today. I just bought more. Can't wait for earningsand CC.....
"An unexpected pleasure. I'm back in OLLI at $30.77. Of course, every stock is on sale right now. I shop Ollie's frequently and as Darlene said, it is business as usual. The loss of their long time CEO was a shock and the corona virus is another shock. The good news is OLLI remains a strong force in their market and their most recognizable competitor (Big Lots) is on the ropes. I look forward to holding as OLLI continues to open stores, ever westward, for a long time."
Company has been opening a lot of new stores in Texas...business is good. $125 coming soon
"Got in yesterday at $55.25. Good deal in my opinion. GLT, stay safe from Dorian."
ETF selling has hurt a lot of good companies.
"PE ratio is still far too high especially given the miss. It will take at least two quarters to gain back confidence. Should trade in the mid to high 40’s before rebounding into the 50’s. I may take a nibble this week to start a position. Long term, a good story if they can execute. Taking over toys boxes is very risky and in this economy, things can change very fast on the ugly side if you are not careful with expansion plans.I worked at a high level for a world class retailer and their stock went from 30 to 9, even though things looked good from the outside. Managing new store openings while minimizing cannibalization is like walking through a mine field. I don’t think the leadership is strong in this area..."
Ollie's Bargain Outlet is up 5.05% to 88.37
$67 by summer
"Boom ... back to 80sTotal net sales increased 15.3% to $327.0 million. Comparable store sales decreased 1.4% compared to a 4.6% increase in the prior year.The Company opened 13 stores during the quarter, ending the period with a total of 345 stores in 25 states, a 16.2% year-over-year increase in store count.Operating income increased 22.0% to $35.7 million.Net income increased 8.6% to $27.0 million and net income per diluted share increased 7.9% to $0.41.Adjusted net income(1) increased 28.3% to $26.8 million and adjusted net income per diluted share(1) increased 28.1% to $0.41.Adjusted EBITDA increased 22.5% to $42.6 million.The Company repurchased $40.0 million of its common stock in the third quarter of fiscal 2019."
Can see share price recovering over coming week...
keep going... I'm almost at my break even.. it's been a long wait!

A super long term hold! Just buy it and put it away
"I bought 300 shares at $79, sad : ("
OLLI has fallen past key price support levels. Your guess is better than mine where this finally bottoms out.

I will buy more at $55-57.
RECORD EARNINGS....https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ollie-bargain-outlet-holdings-inc-201000046.html.
"@stocks. They are not looking to get bought out. They are opening 40 more stores in 2021 with 40 more in 2022. They just got into TX 8 stores and I know of a new one in Hurst by march. They do not do anything online and they plan on keeping it that way, They are a better shop then other discount stores. I think they are going to put big lots out. Also they have no problem going up next to a family dollar or dollar gen. I do think its a long term play as they will have 1,000 stores in 7 years. I do think they will have growing pains because of the fast growth. Logistics and warehouses most likely."
any word on why Ollie's is up so much?
Over $100 on earnings and CC.
If Ollie fails to make its numbers on 3/19 this stock could tank to $25. Helluva ride from $103 to $39 so far.
I bought 1k at 54.50 back a couple days after earnings. Then when it retested 54.50 three weeks ago I bought another 1k. Just sold half at 64.50. Made 10k in 6wks and I’ll hold the other half till after holiday and sell at 74 and pocket 30k. I also made a mill in five below Making money in retail is easy if you know what you’re doing.
A lot of great companies stumble. Buy this one today
someone knows something that they keep selling off. day after day for the last month.
This just doesn't make any sense to be down so much...
A must listen to all serious investors....Best retail stock out there.....http://investors.ollies.us/phoenix.zhtml?c=254045&p=irol-EventDetails&EventId=5277212
"Notes from conference call that caught my attention. Forward looking statement. They expect slower growth for the rest of the year. Goal of 40% gross margin. In Q3 already opened 4 stores. Lesser inventory on hand. Response by management is that leaner inventory is not effecting stores and is part of their plan making the floor 'fresher'. They have a lot of merchandise to purchase and seeing those very well. Goal is still 40% on gross margin. 20 of 21 categories were positive. Only category negative from previous year was luggage which was understood by less travel. Slow down is expected as more retailers come online and open up. They did sell out of yard seasonal items faster than previous years due to stronger demand. All 4 regions performed well. Management is excited about all categories. For Christmas they see heaters and holidays categories which are seasonal they see as going to be strong. They do not see any real change in competition even with all liquidations of other retailers. They paid $4 mil in premium pay which was $1.50 to front line employees which has since stopped. They are not forecasting anything though. Sales did accelerate from mid teens to high teens. They like less in store merchandise so it is easier to shop, but if they can buy more, they will store it in warehouses. Want to keep stores 'fresher'."
"Will be green tomorrow. Blowout numbers and Great call. Unemployed still getting $400 per week more than suppose to, and TRUMP signing that payroll tax holiday will give a Big boost every paycheck for at least the rest of this year."
"Perspective: at $57 a share, Ollie’s has exactly tripled in 5 years (+200 percent), far outpacing overall market gains. Not sure if this is bullish or bearish but it’s worth noting."
Big beat!
"Sorry Travis, but being short is not the play here. This stock is going higher. Bought at 60 today."

"Retailers getting slammed today, but look at Ollies. When retail breaks out, this ones going to rip."
"I know the store here in Durham NC has steady business. Every time I am in there, they are busy. I also saw (can't find the link) that analysts expect 52% increase in total revenue this quarter. That is a high bar. Even WMT crushing their earnings, the stock went down on guidance. I can't see how OLLI doesn't crush their numbers (see COST, TGT, WMT) who were open during the pandemic. The mystery to me is where the stock goes after earnings. I've seen stock crush it and drop on the news. Others take off on future guidance. Mystery to me. I day traded a small amount the last 2 days on the dip. Also opened a few covered calls at 115 with the hopes the stock goes up or at least sideways to collect the premium and hopefully a small bump in price to call me out."
Opening one store a week
"Very strong stock. New 52 week as I post this, and that's in a down market. Expect another 10% or so on earnings and CC. Options think so too. Ollies not affected even if there would be a short term trade war, and I thinkit would actually be good for this company..."
Olli could be 200$ in 4 years
"I backed up the truck here at $72.50, I'm all in!"
"That is one heckuva fine report! And with Christmas shopping, this scenario is going to get even better. Glad I’m long!"
I don’t understand the reason behind the price. Are they expecting horrible results?
I said a long time ago this is the stock that will do well in any market but it's specially in the market we're in now. there's going to be a lot of retail stores that go bankrupt and Ali's will be there to buy the merchandise for pennies on the dollar. if you don't listen to me and just held or bought more you would have made a ton of money. this is just like a dollar store it's going to keep going up and up and up especially in a turbulent market like this.
New high within two months
They missed across the board. No good at all.
Dependable earnings and great business model
Meh..I actually sold all of my OLLI position last week at $106. I mistakenly said I sold half at $106 three hours after it last traded there. However after the continued decline I decided I really sold it all.
"Shorts! The longer you hold...The more you'll lose.... & ... The more you average down, the higher it goes. Cover and go long."
Cramer said look for another great quarter when they report next week
time to add more. their strategy and mgmt team are rock solid.

Back to long term hold...stable model in all economies
"Good news for OLLI: OLLI IS A BUY:The AnalystBank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Jason Haas maintained a Buy rating on Ollie's Bargain with a price target lowered from $110 to $75.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Bradley Thomas maintained at Overweight, price target lowered from $110 to $90.BofA: Q2 A 'Rare Execution Misstep'Ollie's second-quarter miss is a function of a ""rare execution misstep,"" Haas said in a Thursday note. Comps fell 1.7% versus expectations of 2.5% growth. The retailer attributed the big miss to cannibalization from new stores and supply chain issues at distribution centers. The company was also negatively impacted by cold and wet weather throughout May.Other negative readouts from the quarter include a 194-basis point drop in gross margins and an 80-basis point decline in merchandise margins, the analyst said. Encouragingly, Ollie's said it is ""pleased"" with its performance in August, and new store openings remain on track at a mid-teens growth rate, he said. The long-term growth story remains unchanged, although the company is ""less deserving"" of a premium multiple exiting Wednesday's report, according to BofA. KeyBanc: Guidance Remains StrongOllie's management revised its 2019 full-year EPS outlook lower from $2.16 to a range of $1.96 to $2, which is disappointing — but the company remains in a ""healthy position"" to gain market share over the long term, Thomas said in a Wednesday note.Ollie's has a path to operating 950 stores throughout the U.S. and generating longer-term 1% to 2% comp growth, 17% to 20% annual EPS growth and flat-to-slightly higher margins, the analyst said. View more earnings on OLLIDespite a concerning second-quarter print, the company has shown ""strong consistency"" in margins, new store economics and sales results since its July 2015 IPO, he said.Ollie's ""cyclically insulated business model"" remains unchanged and adds another positive element to the stock, Thomas said. Finally, Ollie's stock is likely to remain rangebound until it can demonstrate improved results, especially against a difficult fourth-quarter comparison, according to KeyBanc."
"here comes the upgrades ...Analyst Actions: RBC Boosts Price Target on Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings to $76 From $69, Maintains Outperform Rating"
Tis a gift nothing about the business model has changed!
It’s a great store. Some friends in Worcester ma are loyal shoppers and it’s only been open a year
Not much to dislike on this release. Be nice if they would have provided guidance going forward but that has been the norm for them since Covid started.
"Long term regional to national classic Peter Lynch growth story, we have 270 or so stores now on way to 1000, and new stores are outperforming, i think because the south and midwest really likes bargains."
"I think Peter Lynch would buy Ollie at this price. In "" One Up on Wall Street"", he says these fast growers, eps growth 20-50percent, little debt, good management, regional to national, and PE ratio less than growth rate, are some of his favorites and were multibaggers for him."
Recession or weak economy this company should do well right ??
Stopped into an Ollie’s in Worcester MA. Not too busy but busier than other stores that remain open. Well stocked with food and essentials. Prices are 30% below competitors ...much better atmosphere and selection than dollar stores for sure
$80 by July
"@Bubba ... a couple of questions ... would you think the potential for ""periods of lesser product availability"", given the nature of OLLI's current business model, a possible OLLI weakness, particularly when considered within the context of it's expansion trajectory? ... and, if so, have you ever heard OLLI talk about how it expects to evolve and whether there would be new facets to the business that would help to lessen the effects of periods of lesser product availability?"
Bought 100 shares in Ah at $68.
this is way oversold. the only reason they're down is because they are expanding faster than expected. this is going to be some very easy money buying in this morning at the Lows.
Great quarter and great expansion plans
Here we go again...Another 52 week high today? Big boys will be getting positioned before earnings and guidance. I expect other analyst to start following ollies and more buy ratings after this CC.....
"52 Week LOW. Things are terrible, But OLLIES' is opening NEW stores. What other Company opens new stores when their business model is failing. Ollies is being compared to with other failing companies. Find an Ollies, look at the parking lot. Look at the customers shopping carts. This is the time to be BUYING!"
This will come back. My wife and I shop at the Ollie’s in Madison Al. Always extremely busy.
After listening to conf call bought 67.80
Is Ollie’s just a gimmick or does this company have any same store growth potential. I mean how many AirFryers can one person buy?
"everybody i talk too blue collar getting 25 percent bigger refund this year, not sure wall street factoring this in"
Will be $80 by December
earnings and conference call next week. once again they will beat estimates and probably once again raise guidance. the discount retailers like this are in The Sweet spot in any type of market.
Ollie's is now up to 400 stores. And is sitting on a lot of cash with no debt.
"OLLI (the stock) has been held back for, imho, a couple reasons. Coronavirus....I doubt it. Same-store sales (i.e., comps) percentage declination and being negative....I think so. Possible over-extension of expansion plans and the perception of having inadequate financial coverage to support those plans...could be. General malaise with retail-related stocks....probably. At this time, OLLI stock is a ""falling knife"" which you shouldn't try to catch unless you have a long-term horizon. At some 22x earnings, OLLI isn't exactly cheap for a retailer, but I think better times will come. One thing more disturbing is that Ollie's seems to be raising prices on their merchandise where the bargains aren't quite bargains as they once were (this according to my wife who frequently shops there). I want to buy some OLLI stock, but i think lower prices are ahead. That's just my opinion."

Ollie's Bargain Outlet is up 4.93% to 93.65
4 days in a row
"Reports Q2 (Jul) earnings of $0.52 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.55; revenues fell 21.4% year/year to $415.88 mln vs the $434.6 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Comparable store sales decreased -28.0%, resulting in a two-year stack of positive +15.3%. Co guides to Q3 (Oct) comp growth of +5-7%. Co does not provide full guidance due to pandemic impact.""We continue to face strong year-over-year comparisons in the third quarter as we, once again, delivered record sales and profits last year"
Stocks don't drop 8-10% on that type of headline news. There must be more to this departure story that is not being disclosed until the earnings report and conference call. The longer-term impact causes uncertainty and in this stock market environment investors bail at the moment there becomes uncertainty.
"Just so you know, this is how Ollie's works. It will go lower, usually a few bounces lower before it goes up again. I have bought and sold this stock numerous times and made money, but you have to understand the way it -- trends--. If you can't be comfortable and have patience, this is not the stock for you. GLT"
"Buy! Fifty two week low for no fundamental reason. Their supply chain is much different than most all other retailers. They are not China dependent for product. They buy bankrupt inventories, overstocks, close outs..."
Can someone explain why my options are jumping up high for no reason for price action
Earnings and guidance was good. Buyer will be taking it up to my $110 pt over the next few weeks.

$120 this week
Ollies is near me. Love this store. Friendly people and great prices. We do most of our Christmas shopping for my son here and he loves the stuff.
Crazy price reaction. Stores are profitable in two years after opening …opening a lot of new stores…ollies army members up…no shortage of quality inventory. Company was doing great prior to pandemic. If you can wait a year you will make 50% on your money.
"Today after hours Zoom reported a huge 3-beat (top line, bottom line, and increased forecast), yet their stock price fell 5% AH. OLLI needs to deliver blowout numbers and increase forward forecast."
Big news for Ollies https://www.seibertron.com/transformers/news/ollies-rumoured-to-get-massive-transformers-overstock-for-2018-holiday-season/41539/
nice rebound today. Hopefully their earnings exceed expectations
"As I warned, Ollie needed a 3-beat, revs EPS and forecast. They failed to deliver the 3-beat, and in this stock market environment, you get punished severely. Look no further than what happened to Zoom and their growth rates crush Ollie. Next, expect analysts to lower price targets. OLLI stock is toast for months. Perhaps Hold s I will do, but do not invest more here. Plenty of other stocks in my portfolio running wild. Everyone remain diversified. GLTA"
"Should have bought OLLI pre market at 65, but you never know!"
$125 by December
"Earnings for retailer were in most cases very good. Especially for the discount retailers. Ollies is in the sweet spot for ANY market cycle and are just starting their buildout. The stores I've been to or drove by lately are very busy, and seem to have a Great X-MAS merchandise and lots of toys to sell. Since the market has oversold the retailers for NO reason, they will comeback strong about the time Ollies comes out with their blowout earnings. (JMHO) Great company and great business plan."
