OLLI is not at all like Dollar stores
My biggest fear was shortage of product
$50 is most likely target now.
"Should have bought OLLI pre market at 65, but you never know!"
"Well, I hold Olli as a swing trade account and I was in my local Tampa Bay area store. Business as usual folks. Tuesday around 5, and every time I cruised by the check out area, two lines 7 to 8 people in each line. I'm not sure what the deal is with the decline in price, but my local store is fine. Just thought I'd share that info."
"This is a silly valuation, forward PE of 15 for a company growing 15%+ a year!!! Block out the noise and keep averaging in, OLLI has 10 bagger potential!!!"
Why is it down so much today? Only thing I could think of is that the retail sector is down. Olli share price fluctuates a lot.
Down because DLTR or DG warned of supply chain costs rising and difficulty getting items.
"7th time playing/trading OLLI, first-time bagholder. Paid $84.50, now at $66. I will hold, but won't average down. Today was a huge miss, and I wouldn't be surprised if tomorrow brings downgrades."
"I bought 300 shares at $79, sad : ("
They missed across the board. No good at all.
No support now t0 $49 and then $39. Not looking good.
"If you have never been to one of these stores, try it. Customers in every isle, great prices, a large variety of product. On the other hand, product is poorly organized and displayed. Only reason I could see why management would ever say foot traffic would be down during the Christmas season is to lower expectations and over deliver. You can probably make money with a side hustle purchasing and reselling products from these stores."
Stocks don't drop 8-10% on that type of headline news. There must be more to this departure story that is not being disclosed until the earnings report and conference call. The longer-term impact causes uncertainty and in this stock market environment investors bail at the moment there becomes uncertainty.
"I've owned shares (mid 40s) from way before covid and will continue to hold; think the past 1 1/2 year pandemic frenzy and fed cares act $$$ perks could be considered significant factors in Olli growth. Also believe store expansion a key to the (unforeseen) supply chain strain (a to common theme in just about every industry today). SP could see a mid 50s handle before the clouds abate, then a new normal. I shop at Ollies"
Funny how absolutely no one is interested in this hidden gem.
Supply chain challenges. Seems a lot of retailers are reporting this.
How will Ollie be affected by all the supply chain problems and shortages. Will they be able to keep their shelves stocked with discount items?
Bought 100 shares in Ah at $68.
Still the same OLLI ...look for snap back next week. New highs in January
This was down 6.66% today. That does not bode well!￼￼
After listening to conf call bought 67.80
Crazy price reaction. Stores are profitable in two years after opening …opening a lot of new stores…ollies army members up…no shortage of quality inventory. Company was doing great prior to pandemic. If you can wait a year you will make 50% on your money.
"This is really bad. I sold prior to earnings, but feel sorry for the stock holders. If you can get out without a huge loss I suggest you do. Otherwise it's going to be a few years of bag holding."
Been an investor in OLLI for several years. Sold when it was $97 thinking I could pick up at a lower price. But as others have mentioned something is not right with the stock. Just keeps falling even after an analyst upgrade. I tried taking a position in the mid $50's. I'm not a technician but noticed there seemed to be support at $53. I decided as long as it held $53 I would stay in. Well it appears to me it's broken support so I sold most of my shares. Will keep it on my watch list possibly buying back as we get close to ER. To those who remain long understand I have on occasion sold stock at the bottom so maybe you can thank me later. GLTA
"Reports Q2 (Jul) earnings of $0.52 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.55; revenues fell 21.4% year/year to $415.88 mln vs the $434.6 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Comparable store sales decreased -28.0%, resulting in a two-year stack of positive +15.3%. Co guides to Q3 (Oct) comp growth of +5-7%. Co does not provide full guidance due to pandemic impact.""We continue to face strong year-over-year comparisons in the third quarter as we, once again, delivered record sales and profits last year"
goin green
"Ollie said they initiated stock repurchase program in Q2, hope that will give price some support"
I will buy more at $55-57.
looking into the shorts / 18% !! - this could b the perfect MEME Stock lol / excellent fundamentals - I’m very confortable w this investment. Regardless the drop - painful but don’t need the money now .
"New quarterly report shows decline in revenue, end of YoY revenue growth since 2013."
"Ollie Senior VP of Supply Chain departure announced. I don't currently own OLLI but it's on my watch list. If it weren't for the stock market rolling over on inflation numbers, I would be tempted to buy at $85. Anyone know if this was a firing?"
Sorry for those who bought at $100 plus. I was in last year when the price kept sliding after the news of the founder died; I held on like 5 months until it recovered and some. Just hold on. Olli ain't going away.
What do you guys think? Does it really deserve a 14% drop? Isn’t it too excessive?
"Dec. 17, 2018 low was $61/sh.................I bought a few hundred shares today."
Is Ollie similar to Big Lots. I have never seen an Ollie store in California bay area.
Its not so Bad results this drop is fear
The stores have always looked a mess like the old time salvage stores. If you are willing to risk your health you may find a bargain. The one I go to should after Christmas have a bull dozer come in with a bulldozer and push #$%$ to the parking lot and sell it by the pound. A quarter a pound would clean it up. The re is no evidence of an aged goods liquidation program . Go into any store that has been open for more than three years and have a look. No payroll is their secret. Run ads without merchandise coverage and you always hear we just sold out. I bought this on the IPO and sold around 80. I would say there is a day of reckoning coming that will take it down below 30. No store up keep. No floor payroll. Assortment is feeling the pinch. Cheap rent and low payroll
"my takeaways after going through OLLI annual & quarterly reports 1, facing significant supply issue due to the pandemic. inventory increased, account payable decreased, probably paying cash for product2, double whammy of end of economic stimulus and decreased demand for PPE3, significant down side risk with little/no margin of safety. even after 50% drop from all time high, still higher than historical highs 4, insiders have been selling"
HERE IS MY FULL BULLISH THESIS ON OLLIES!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXfowb6qLuA
