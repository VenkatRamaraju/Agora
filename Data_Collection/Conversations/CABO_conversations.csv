"I respectfully ask Mr. Gayner and Ms. Laulis to stop diluting and get a repurchase plan going. Strategically, and WACC-wise, I get it, but enough is enough. With a BB rating, just below investment grade, it’s worth carrying more debt on the balance sheet.I don’t mind the most recent offering or preceding offerings, with very minor (< 5%) dilution, but it would be nice to scrap the dividend and approve a buyback."

Look at EBITDA and FCF numbers. This is a great business. Almost all of the cash flows are from operating activities. Wait until they get a legit repurchase plan going. Long $CABO

Stock is down ~10% YTD. Priced so only institutional investors are interested. Even with dividend increase they are really underperforming in spite of the price. Highly over-valued stock. Big shareholders are going to start to look for bigger dividends than 17% of net income quarterly if stock continues to languish.

CABO is down 7.48% in the last two days of trading and 21% YTD. Maybe the company needs to do a bogus stck split to convince anyone that it's worth buying.

The acquisition of hagray was a merger to save both companies. CABO is not paradise for investing unless you are riding it down. I call sub $1000 by end of year. The cooked books are going to boil over and show how they throw bad money after more. They have $0 to reinvest into infrastructure. How can they buy back? Hence the senior note offering.

"They have regressed in their pricing strategy, switching back to long-term, deep discounting. That could be signalling a slowing of residential appetite."
