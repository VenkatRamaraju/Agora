The next few quarters will be very good. There is an energy crisis in the world. Oil and gas sector is red hot. Krimbill and his team are buying Ngl units. It seems the turn around is imminent.
"Completely off topic:As I write here occasionally, I thought it appropriate to identify a different stock I am now heavily focused on FSK. It’s an amalgamation of 6 BDC’s into what is now the second largest one out there. It’s is only now getting re-introduced to public markets. Yield is a safe 10.5%+ and growing. In an industry that usually trades at an 8% yield. Stock is at $23, should be north of $30. It’s manager, KKR, is heavily incentivized to get the stock price up. Check it out."
"The stock price is trading as if near bankruptcy, while bonds are trading normally. The obvious fact is that NGL handed over complete power to the bond holders in that last move. THere is no reason to hold stock in this when you can get 7% secured. All growth will go to make bond holders more secure. All cash flows the same. Until that dark hole is filled, the stock price deservedly has no reason to trade above whatever high water mark the market sets, 2.20? 2.30?"
"Krimbill has bought 650,000 in the last few weeks. This CEO wants to tell us something."
Bottom area around $1.28..will buy at that level
"September 24, 2021EIA expects increasing consumption of natural gas by U.S. industry in 2021 and 2022:Based on our September Short-Term Energy Outlook, we expect industrial sector natural gas consumption to rise throughout 2021 and to exceed pre-pandemic 2019 levels. We forecast the growth to continue into 2022, and natural gas delivered to industrial consumers will average 23.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) that year. If realized, this amount would be near the current record high for annual industrial natural gas consumption set in the early 1970s."
"Krimbill the CEO bought 100,000 units at $1.74 this week. Definitely this coming Q will be very good. I am buying. Good luck guys."
"Preferred exchange doesn't make sense, and if it does happen it will be with only the preferred D's. Parity between common and preferreds are not favorable. General partner has 48% IDR's at around $2/unit that they don't want to give up. Insiders have a relatively large share of common units they don't want to dilute. Preferred D's have warrants at around $17 for 25 million units that they will get in 2028 or something. Preferred B's and C's contribute $30mm in carrying costs per year and Preferred D's $60mm. You think a company guiding $570mm per year at $460mm cash flow neutral cares about $30mm enough to dilute their own shares by several fold? After they were just awarded and purchased around 1mm units between all of management? Why would they exchange preferred B's and C's when they go to float in the next 2 years and will go from 9% carrying cost down to 7.2%, which is lower than their debt carrying costs? The preferred B's and C's are a nice way to triple your money after a year or two from appreciation and distribution in arears, and that's it guys. No get rich quick scheme. The time for all those balance sheet moves were before the refinance during the XOG bankruptcy.Could the Preferred D's pull something and massively dilute common? Maybe. You can't participate in that because it's private placement.Any EBITDA above the cash flow neutral line of $460 implies value to the common. A company does not pack up shop and declare bankruptcy because their shares/units are trading poorly. They declare bankruptcy when they can't pay their debts. Many options to address 2023's from straight debt payment to second lien on secured to a term loan to push it out 1-2 years. NGL could post a $480 EBITDA this FY and still be in good enough shape so long as the fundamentals behind water remain. The unit price is going to be challenged because people expect a distribution out of an MLP, NGL isn't in any dumb money indices, oil and gas as a whole is out of favor, and people are aware that all cashflow is going to debt and then preferred for the foreseeable future. Little reason for them to wait it out while they can make 10% somewhere else and come back to NGL in a year.If you have the compulsive need to see your value on paper increase then you should be in dumb money index funds. People are brainwashed to think that is the responsible thing to do, so substantially all savings go into those indices regardless of fundamentals. It's just the nature of the market now.If you do decide to hold NGL there's not much to do but wait. It's just going to take time to get the balance sheet back in line. Different people could justify a price all the way from $0.01 to $10.00 at current metrics, so be prepared for a bumpy ride, particularly on the low side. NGL has the unique components of being highly leveraged, vastly underestimated growth in the next 3-5 years, and very undervalued share price. So long as the fundamentals behind growth remain the holders of every class will win."
I wonder if they sold their oil inventory they were sitting on…do they have to announce that? That’s worth about $50M at these commodity prices
Water has already been good. The other 2 sectors were not good in the first Q but we know they tend to be good later in the year. That means the next few Q will be good. We will see $4 even this year.
I wonder if it can pass $2 today?
NGL Preferred down a bunch today. Is it worth buying?
"I wonder if any other big player would benefit from acquiring NGL … the debt is high, but a big company could leverage efficiencies especially if they have a need for midstream services and fracking water solutions. IDK, just thinking out loud."
Low supply big demand price rises. NGL thrives stock price rise. Basic 101 Economics.
Mike K going to make a big announcement on Monday folks.
The pfd are where the action is.
My plan to buy at the historical low is getting ruined....
"I’d like to be wrong about this - for the sake of the employees, if nothing else. Bit this s company and my experiences with it remind me of several unfortunate notions: ‘We didn’t lose the game, we just ran out of time.’ - Lombardi Being right at the wrong time is still being wrong.Ken Lay etal bought tons of Enron stock when they knew the company was tanking. And it cost them very little for the advertisement. Are you looking at the picture of the toy on the cereal box? . Krinbill is the Ozian ‘man behind the curtain.’ Sound business actions have never guided this company - just defense of sunk costs and raw ego. Short the f out of this - with timing that syncs as closely as possible with their 2nd quarter earnings call. Krimbill’s ego and capital pipelines won’t let him go bankrupt - he’ll be able to sell.If you’re local, you might hang out in the NGL parking lot looking for limos as your barometer."
"Should be $2.50 before end of September, IMO"
I say buy . Analyst have beaten this stock up highlighting it's challenges. Which i admit are many . At any rate the assests alone at 1.80 is worth any risk when  balancing the reward. If you haven't bought now you better buy VERY soon. The stock has gained very slowly the last 48 weeks. And is ready to take off very very soon i see buying ....latly and very little selling which indicates price will continue to rise.
3 days in a row profit lets make it 4 come monday!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1 day at a time
"It seems odd to me that grand mesa only generated $20.5mm this quarter where the previous generated $26mm with storm Uri. I wonder if some of this is a delay between when the barrel in transported and when the invoice is paid.I'm going to looking closely at that number next earnings. In the worst pandemic situation and a bankruptcy they were still able to generate $153mm for FY21. Right now they are on track for... $82mm.Water growth can power through this deficit, but if it stays anywhere close to that low the preferreds will take a couple extra quarters to be reinstated. Either way that asset will get filled eventually, but I think we all want results sooner rather than later."
The numbers were not as bad as feared. Water will be worth more then the Debt. By year end that should be a $400mm Ebitda business. That will fetch $3B. What is left is worth more then the pfd once it gets back to normal. The pfd is probably money good. The common is marginal.
Lovely. Please get to $10 and start paying dividends
3 day in a row profit can we make it 4 tommorow!!!!!!!!!!!
Ngl is up6.7% on a down day for the market.
Nothing to see here. Just a company getting gobbled up by insiders.
I believe ngl is way undervalued. They have plenty of cash and debt is not a problem. Neither are preferred shares In all in and buying more just like the insiders
R3 level is 1.69. Lets see if we can break that.
"The most important number, produced water volume, was good at 1.667 million bpd and skim oil increased to 2,500 kbpd. Everything else was pretty atrocious. Increased water OPEX holding water back a touch. I'm guessing the first recycling operation was pretty expensive to start up. Liquids is such a frustratingly terrible part of NGL, and crude was just bad. Grand Mesa not pulling its weight right now. They drew down some of the oil inventory, but no gaming of the inventory is going to make up for Grand Mesa being so weak. 77kbpd is just not acceptable."
VMR (private analyst) reiterated a strong buy with a one year price target of $5.35. Anticipated growth in the water segment for Poker Lake and utilization of Grand Mesa capacity to lift profits and meet Debt to EBIDTA requirements by Jan 2023.
"Oil is up again. It is exciting. If next Q is good, ngl will go to the moon."
"I haven't read the bond covenant, but management might not even be able to sell the overpriced assets at bargain prices, even if they wanted. It's time to rid this company of the CEO and CFO. They are exceptionally bad managers."
The new cfo has connections in the bank world.We will refinance at lower interest rate for sure.Banks are more ready to lend when the oil industry is strong.They are after the money.
"Excellent moves so far this morning. Perhaps some short covering of the lower level and as soon as we slow in the rise, new shorts will take new positions.....quite a gamble considering the underlying value of this company!"
"nice, it’s out-perform the market"
"Despite some very persuasive analyses of some analysts, the truth is Ngl won’t go down as long as oil price goes up. Krimbill has signaled that strong belief with his recent insider purchase. Some people worry about the cumulative distribution on preferred but that is not a big issue. In the worse scenario, Krimbill can just turn then into commons. Not good for common but it is not cause for bankruptcy. As upstream companies are done with strengthening their balance sheets, they will be back to spending and expanding to take advantage of the high oil price. Ngl will have a lot of work to do. So the question is whether the world economy is recovering , hence the increase in oil consumption, or COVID will kill us all. I believe COVID is no match for Pfizer and Moderna."
"I expect we will have some ""real"" analyst coverage and updates in the next 30 days which will start this price back up....last update was Wells Fargo with target of $2.65."
Always a horrible day when NGL is in the Red :-(
"Drilling productivity report again very good for Permian and now the DJ basin. I think Occidental is the one adding barrels in the DJ, and unfortunately I don't think any of those will come to us. Still good to fill up the excess capacity around the whole region."
Krimbill bought 230000 units. That is $350000 at today price. He must believe Ngl will do well.
"I am an owner of NGL, bought some 2000+ stocks some time ago. Let's be realistic. This company has 2 billions of goodwill on it's balance sheet - what for, is it a Nike company, Reebok... This goodwill is worth 0. Deduct this and you have a company that has negative equity - and yes, this represents all our ownership in this company. Right now I have no hopes of this going anywhere but lower... Yes, I want time to prove me wrong."
I dont think ngl will go bankrupt in the next few years when oil price is going up and there is more and more demand for ngl service.next 3 Q will be good and the price will be more than $3.
"major shareholders have reported short positions of NGL Energy Partners: Citadel Advisors LLC, Simplex Trading LLC, HAP Trading LLC, Susquehanna International Group LLP, Group One Trading L.P., Wolverine Trading LLC, and Cutler Group LP. Let’s see how long and how much are they willing to wait"
"Let's look at the numbers :- Revenue: Up 76% to $1.49 billion.- Operating loss: Up more than sixfold to $69 million.- Earnings (loss) per share: Loss of $1.23 a share, versus a loss of 0.44 per share in the same quarter last year.So if I am interpreting this right, the more revenue NGL generates, the greater their loss on that revenue? They are clearly giving away services and product in order to book revenue. On a similar note, Q1 they lost $69 Million. On July 1, NGL paid out $40+ Million in bonuses. They are laughing at all the bond holders for providing the cash to continue paying themselves.Good work if you can get it."
Ngl is up 5.4%. Someone is loading.
"If Krimbill and management really believe in what they are preaching , they should buy as much as they can now."
"Wow! Krimbill has just bought 200,000 units. This is very bullish."
Ngl earning will be good today.
"At this low price, ngl is worth only less than 200 million dollars for a 5 bil dollar in revenue. Some people with deep pockets may buy the whole company and take it private."
Does anyone understand the Debt to EBIDTA calculation requirement?
The metrics for NGL point to great instability in the near term and the next earnings report is vital to its continuation as a going concern. The recent purchases by insiders are serving to stabilize the stock price in order to prevent an absolute sell-off and possible bankruptcy.
Krimbill should fire the PR guy too. He goes totally silent for months. No wonder a lot of people assume NGL is dead.
Well first limit order done at 1.47. Lets try another
Krimbill not on the conference call. Odd!
https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2249306-us-shale-producers-switch-from-ducs-to-drilling
Cheniere Energy CEO just declare a .33 dividend based on that 90% of all their LNG production is booked for the next 20 yrs. Unbelievable!
Obviously a 2022 investment..Either ur In or Out.Risk is high.Rewards are high.
Recent option activities point to a turnaround. I believe it is an upward turnaround because the macro environment for ngl is very favorable.
We are a starting to get noticed attracting more and more attention. Last couple days NGL finally popped up on Trade ideas scanner. Soon more investors will begin piling into this 95 % discounted Stock.
If U are serious about owning I would start accumulation 2nw..And be prepared to buy at $1.50 heavy..
all pipelines up except NGL and it's dropping like a rock.
Looks largely like a retail buyers day - low volume - pricing change very minor. Can't wait to see when the MM start positioning for ER!
I've got to imagine M is feeling pretty good right now after buying 100k units at the bottom of 1.50
"Kinda agreeing with the pre Q earning spike. But the June one was on the (sadly wrong) optimism on the refinancing right??But..:let’s go, more green, match back up to over $10 with a dividend would be a marvellous Xmas present"
"One thing I'm going to be paying attention to this quarterly report is the ""Other Service Revenues"" in the water segment. This is where recycled/reused water sales goes.Previous revenue in millions:11.521 - June 1912.153 - Sept19.166 - Dec15.698 - Mar8.38 - June 206.555 - Sept13.132 - Dec5.809 - Mar21.697 - June 21*** Large scale recycling project of ~150kbwpd starts in MayThe second LARGER recycling project of 250kbwpd started in late July. Effective per barrel margin in water is going to be quite high between increased skim oil revenue at $60+ oil and these recycling projects.Produced water disposal will be the driver and I'm not big on the ESG initiatives, but if they show they can make money I'm all for it!"
"Company is literally running out of cash. The move from 1.90 to 1.45 was letting everyone know: Bankruptcy is now in the cards. If it hits .90 then delisting becomes a real possibility. Still interested to see how they will solve preferred shares. 1/25 exchange into common, then 25 to 1 reverse split?"
"Oil apparently is everything wrong with the world, despite the fact that it runs everything in the world. This almost plays out like a silly parent/child melodrama. Not just NGL, but the entire sector drops to the beat of every phantom problem despite how essential it is to commerce while terrible tech companies with lazyware implementation, some worse than from decades ago, seem to thrive. World Perspective: Making zero common sense since March 2020."
"Big mike wasn’t dumb in buying more common on Thursday. Common sense prevails! If fiscal 2021 EBITDA came in at $448mm, with lockdowns, crude in negative prices, bankruptcy extraction, and uri storm, and obvious that Q1 is picking up exactly where Q4 left off. Then fiscal 2022 has to outperform with more capital inventory. Expect management buy ins are close to follow"
"They are announcing on a Monday, beginning of the week. Expect good news. last time was on a Thursday. I sold before the market closed last time and was right. I am holding this time into earnings in 20 minutes."
Ngl will soar to $3 with any good news
want to eat investor money..this company better declare for bankruptcy.
"One thing is pretty certain....management is heavily vested in turning NGL around. The typical seasonality is for the first two quarters of the fiscal year to be lower due to the seasonality of many of their products/services. Water sales, water recycling, and water disposal will be growing as the Permian ramps up to meet the needs in the country. Oil price is in a good range of $60 to $70 for profitability in the Permian. $570 - 600 projected full year with the first couple of quarters estimated to be 90-120 mil EBIDTA means the second half of the fiscal year will support the critical level of EBIDTA of $180m per quarter, or meet the 4.75 multiple ....of course this is holding all things equal in the economic realm. Very Positive!"
Anyone buying at !1.50...?
I have just bought 100000 units. Wish me luck!!!!
"NGL has spiked into quarterly earnings in previous months - most notable $3+ 2 quarters ago....we have many positives coming into the end of this quarter, some being positives not realized in the market yet. Last quarter management recognized many of the negatives which lowered EBIDTA. The question for this quarter is if this is the first of the improved quarters, or another bite the bullet quarter. I am OK with either as long as the year EBIDTA is confirmed again at $560 - 600. Improved water services noted in the last quarter call should have provided more confidence in the remainder of the year. Any improvements in Propane with the purchase of the Ambassador Pipeline back in March, and any added volumes from the Grand Mesa ""Open Season"" will help ensure sufficient EBIDTA to have 4.75 ratio for the next 4 quarters. Any negative surprises for the next two quarters will push that out likely for a year. Oh, and listen for rumors of refinancing the debt. It could be logical that stronger growth could open that opportunity and with Linda's knowledge, I would look to see that come to fruition sooner than later! 2% reduction of the the loan rate would fund a $.50 per share annual dividend and drive the price back to previous levels. Also, they have many assets (land, technology, skilled workforce) that is capable of growing the business back to revenue levels in business with much higher margins. Management can deliver this with focus and effort!GLTAL"
NGL going up... $5... $10... $20... plus a nice big fat dividend....
There is strong support at $1.5. It seems the stock is oversold and a lot of investors are stepping to buy despite the risk. High risk high return.
"I’ll go this far:Mgmt stock purchases at least indicate that they believe they will hit their indicated Ebitda range of $550 - $600. Because if they are not on track, not only will the stock flirt with the sub-dollar range, the bonds will crash forcing some very tough choices. If they do, in fact, make those numbers the pfd will trade up to par. Also, the stock purchases weigh against my prediction that an exchange is about to happen. We shall see."
"If ngl went bankrupt it would pay each shareholder $10 per share.  (based on the assets minus the liabilities divided by the outstanding shares listed on Ameritrade, I don’t know if that includes preferred or not)"
"When things are darkest it’s very difficult to step up and buy stock. Especially in a time of maximum uncertainty with NGL debt . But when big Mike has a massive personal investment in the company, (i think 4M already COMMON share) you know with conviction that he is aligned. Haven’t seen not one sell of his and purchases have been in high 20s to mid 1s now. Waiting for trey CFO to buy in, to be  convinced"
Marching toward $3... $4.... $5.....
Chevron announced they're looking to sell their Eagle Ford assets. Big indicator that they want to high-grade to delaware basin and might be factoring in a purchase of the Shell delaware basin assets.Would be MASSIVE if NGL handles their water.
"Talk about putting all your eggs in one basket. Solaris ipo is expected to fetch 1B valuation. How can a company with 5x debt leverage and 80% of its revenues supported by acreage dedications and minimum volumes commitments from COP be valued so high? NGL with more capacity in 3 basins(premian,DJ,eagle Ford)crude logistics and liquids be valued less than 300M? The IMPORTANCE of having a producer as a stake holder! I hope xom follows cop steps"
can we see $3 tomorrow?
Some institution is buying in large.
What can I say about 52 week low. Only more sellers than buyers and emotions influences better judgment when it comes to investing. Trading as if bankruptcy is imminent.
"So what is a fair value. I see from latest investor presention enterprise value is $4.45 B. Might be $4.6 B with increase in stock price.FY2021 ""adjusted EBITDA"" was $487.8 million.Projecting $560 to $600 M for FY 2022.Do companies like this trade at 9X ""adjusted EBITDA""? If so then company is fairly priced, but I think it might trade at 7 or 8X.Thoughts?"
Whats up with nat gas. Hitting 5. Wonder how propane and butane look heading into winter
NGL will survive alright. Only question is if it's worth our time to hold and wait that long.....
"Just found this from Whiting Petroleum: ""Whiting also entered into an agreement to divest its Redtail assets, including associated midstream assets, located in Weld County, Colorado to a private entity for total cash consideration of $187 million, before typical closing adjustments. The assets span 67,278 net acres with daily production of approximately 7,100 BOE/d (51% oil). ... divesting of properties in Colorado that were not going to compete internally for capital.""The important part is someone who isn't Civitas made a move in that area. Perhaps this is why NGL went with the Grand Mesa open season around the same time. Might be a new customer or an old one looking to increase production."
"With liquidity where it is, I hope NGL is monitoring its positions because if a margin call occurs that could go really bad. Especially in light of the ""certain restricted payment provisions"" covenants from the 2021 Debt Package."
The oil price spike is coming at an interesting time. All of the preliminary indicators on 2022 production sounded good. Producers will be getting ready to officially release their guidance and $80 oil will hopefully nudge them higher. I would have never guessed this situation a year ago.I am a bit concerned on NGL's liquidity given their primary inventory buying time is right now and everything is very expensive. Hopefully it is as simple as delaying bond repurchases until March while paying down the revolver.
More insider purchases folks...
Come on NGL…horrible when it’s Red. Let’s have some positive earnings. Pay down that debt and give us some dividends!!
"Looked at the Wells Fargo forecast for NGL.....just a few slight improvements in EBIDTA from propane investment, water processing growth, or Grand Mesa puts the company on track for dividend return as early as end of 2022/early2023. Just think of what a 8% dividend at $8 will mean to those who purchased at this level - 25% return!"
Some day you guys will regret not to buy at $1.5.
Krimbill seems determined to fix the debt problem.He owns alot of commons like us.I think he is on our side.
Our town abandoned aquafer water because they said saltwater was infiltrating the aquafer. We switched to Lake Michigan water. So why can't NGL create water systems that will allow towns to stay on aquafers?
"Linda should buy some units.Show us your confidence in NGL,please."
I bought at $2.38.and a bunch at !.50 which I traded for a profit.I am going too buy on any dip and hold this time..Just my thoughts
"Krimbill bought 350,000 last week. That is a show of confidence in Ngl. I think we are at the bottom."
Hold your shares.....this will be back above $2.40+ by Nov 9 ER
How many divis does NGL owe to holders of preferred share? Will they company EVER have the money to pay the $$ owed. I doubt it unless a NGL buyer is forced to cover NGL's debts.
"Every time i think, I just bought at a new low, ha."
I think a deal between civitas and GM is very near. Think about it. NGL can buy all the crude at market price from civitas minus the transportation cost of shipping on GM. That’s a win win for all. I think the deal is in the bag there just waiting for everyone to jump on board with there last agreements. I don’t doubt probably trey will be the new cfo for civitas. We’ll see huh
Do we know Krimball’s average now? I assume still $10+ given that he has been buying for years
Linda has 30.4k units.
"The Dj basin is known for its heavier crude. That crude is in high demand now that 79% of production is offline due to IDA. Grand Mesa has capacity of 340 kbd(190 Saddlehorn and 150 Ngl). While Saddlehorn is owned by Magellan, oxy and plains it’s make sense for NGL to keep oddly quiet about the new shipping contracts."
Volume is 2.17 million. Something very good is happening.
How low is this going. Any clue??
"Any ideas why the preferred are moving up? Not complaining and the higher they are, the less chance of a takeunder, but I'm beginning to wonder by the action if someone has been informed the takeunder is coming and everyone is getting in to get a a little money."
2.33 a share after hours up another 11 cents. Up 21 cents a share today. Yessir
"Putting together the press releases and relevant earnings so far... a lot of signs point to the July-Sept quarter being a significant increase over the quarter to be discussed this week. Exxon will be going from 400kbpd to 440kbpd in the Permian. A small NGL recycling operation starting late May and then a larger one in late July. The oil barrels they held back in Jan-Mar can be sold anytime, and they very well could have held onto them until July-Sep. Grand Mesa Binding Open Season started July-Aug. That's quite a bit of revenue increase so long as no lockdowns come down and no single events like Storm Uri occur.I would still like to see something like 1.5mm+ barrels of produced water just to see some growth, but with sawtooth being sold at a loss we might see another large GAAP eps loss. XOG/BCEI ramping up is hopefully a benefit, but it may not have come back to 100% in the whole quarter. The only other factor I can think of is the colonial pipeline hack. I don't know if that would affect the liquids segment positively, negatively, or not at all.This quarterly report might be good, but I think all signs point to July-Sept being the blowout quarter to start NGL's recovery."
Earnings call will be next Monday. We will see at least $3.
$3 tomorrow?
"US Energy Information Administration (EIA) - Sept 8, 2021Based on our latest Drilling Productivity Report (DPR), 5,957 drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs) were in the United States in all DPR regions in July 2021, the lowest for any month since November 2017. The decline in DUCs in most major U.S. onshore oil producing regions, especially in the Permian region, reflects more well completions and, at the same time, less new well drilling activity. The completion of more wells is increasing oil production in the Permian region, but the completions are reducing the DUC inventories, which could limit oil production growth in the United States in the coming months."
"I honestly believed the inflection point wouldn’t of been reached till sometime next year. But forecast data for October for the premian alone anticipates another increase of 4% in disposal market in the fourth quarter, which will bring the size of the market to a record 1.3 billion bbl per quarter. Not to mention the recycle and reuse business side. It’s been a tough fiscal 2021, with Covid, price war, extraction, Urí. Fiscal 2022 is looking total opposite for NGL. The sling shot is barely being stretched. Let’s see how much it recoils!"
Any thoughts and dreams when the preferreds might start receiving dividends again? What advantage would it be to NGL if they did have the resources to pay the cumulative dividends from the past non-paid quarters?
Next Q will be good. Water is doing very well.
Strong start looking like 5 days in a row in the green this stock is turning around quickly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What I like about Ngl is it can double with good news. It has done that not long ago.
A good article. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dangerous-rally-natural-gas-prices-000000541.html
"So the last response on EC trey explains the Hedge. So if crude prices rise very quickly NGL is in a loss. Since they pay for crude daily, they don’t get paid by the refiners until the end of the entire average monthly price. If the AMP is lower or backward hedge is lower and they paid more for crude during the month, LOSS. But it can also be opposite, thus GAIN. So going forward, more opec crude should pressure price down. Hopefully! Thus why the huge capital expense for purchases during the quarter."
"If there was real value here, you would think every insider would be loading the boat at $1.50. So far...Nothing to speak of!"
"Exxon Quarterly Permian Production since the quarter before Poker Lake Express pipeline was commissioned:Sept 2020: 401000Dec 2020: 389000Mar 2021: 394000June 2021: 400000Exxon estimate of Sept 2021: 440000We kept going into every quarter assuming Poker Lake was firing up. This is the first time we've had some real evidence that it is. It's going to show up in the produced water numbers, the question is just how much does that incremental production give NGL in produced water. A 2.5x multiple gives us 0.1 million barrels of water per day... and there's also a Recycling project that started in July."
"CEO, CFO, directors, managers, all of them should buy at this price to show confidence in their company. They lead, we will follow."
"From an analytical, to a critic and now show and tell blog. Human nature "
"I want this to drop today, so my order will go through.."
"Let’s see. Almost 1M worth of common purchase by ceo and BOD. Why common, not preferred or bonds? Oh yea common are dirt cheap, voting rights as to who gets what, when and for sure no dilution down the road. This quarter is looking to be a good one for water and crude logistics"
3 days in the row green lets make it 4 tommorow
when are they going resign?
"US Energy Information Administration - Sept. 21, 2021Crude oil inventories in Cushing, Oklahoma are down more than 40% from start of 2021Crude oil inventories in Cushing, Oklahoma, totaled 32.9 million barrels (excluding pipeline fill and stocks in transit by water and rail) in the week ending September 10, which is a 42% decrease since the beginning of the year. Crude oil inventories at Cushing are now 26% lower than normal, based on the previous five-year (2016–2020) average for that time of year. The Cushing storage hub is the crude oil delivery point for the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures contract and is home to 14% of U.S. commercial tank and underground crude oil working storage capacity.Seems a rally in the price of oil is brewing which should lead to more drilling in the Permian which of course should help NGL Energy."
I wonder why Trey Bolshevik hasn’t bought any units.
NGL is still highly undervalued and fundamentals that are lifting the performance continue to get better....shares are on sale!!!
Volume is low. The selling has stopped and there is strong support at 1.48. We are looking at the bottom now.
Banks now love oil. I think Krimbill will be able to refinance soon.
One thing that might be telling is insider buying through next ER
CFO retiring.
"Interactive Brokers raised maintenance margin to 100% right before earnings, coincidence? No way, I 've watched them do this multiple times to positions I've owned right before they fell big time. I expect earnings to be bad IMHO>"
NGL is up 8.79% to 1.70
Can conceivably hit 1 at some point.
"How long should we hold NGL for wait for divvies to come back? GEL, PAA and ET are back to less than $10. My hard earned $$ could use their divvies than waiting for divvies here."
I want to see the CFO buy some units. He always sounds optimistic in earning calls.
"One of the greatest investors of all time, Peter Lynch, was noted as saying that ""insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise."" In fact Evidence suggests that insiders tend to act far in advance of expected news. They do this in part to avoid the appearance of illegal insider trading. And a study by academics at Pennsylvania State and Michigan State contends that insider activity precedes specific company news by as long as two years before the eventual disclosure of the news. So we have ways to go"
I hope the new CFO will buy some units
Wow real winner here down 5% and mercantile price up .15 today…when it rains it pours
The only green today among the sea of reds... someone has some faith in NGL...
"After Krimbill recent insider purchase, it is likely the next Q will be good. I believe Ngl will go up very fast when investors see a solid recovery."
pressure from profit taking in morning..
4.27 million units are traded today. I hope the unhappy investors have already left. We will have a new beginning Monday.
Ken Griffin got caught lying under oath. Loses his lid and makes the whole market red.
Ngl can’t go down because the CEO has told us loud and clear that next Q will be good.
Margin requirements change if a stock closes below 2..Alot of margin calls hitting accts.Basically forced liquidation..
As mentioned got in on this double digits.Would be great Xmas present to see $10!!!
"Bloomberg Oct 11, 2021Oil prices above $80 a barrel are once again spurring a revival of shale drilling in America’s biggest oil field, where production is expected to return to pre-pandemic highs within weeks.Only this time, the surge is being driven by private operators, rather than the publicly traded companies that fueled the previous booms. And they see little reason to slow things down.Increased access to financing and strong oil demand has created an opening for closely held producers, most of whom are backed by private equity or family money, to ramp up output in West Texas and southeast New Mexico. With the other major U.S. shale basins either holding steady or declining, according to BloombergNEF, the surging growth in the Permian isn’t likely to risk upsetting OPEC or tanking crude prices as it did in previous shale booms—at least not yet.---"
I'm in.. take a gamble. Why not? Have fun everyone! GLTA
Last chance to buy under $2 folks...
It will go above $4.00 in few weeks .... CEO now holds huge numbers of shares...some good announcements coming soo...
The pfd rallies as common goes to zero.
"We are 3 rotation into no dividend paid to B,C and D prfds though D gets treated to bonds. What is that, close to $95M in the rears already?"
4 days in a row in the green lets make it 5 tommorow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
what happened to the big banks prediction of 20% market crash? I could've used that crash to scoop up some goodies.
TBW their is no reason to hold a stock which is likely to be dead money until distribution restored! It’s really that simple! Don’t overthink it!
"If you run a company that is going bankrupt, would you spend $350,000 to buy it’s worthless shares? There is something I am 100% sure. Krimbill has no intention of filing for chapter 11. So we can stop talking about bankruptcy now."
Krimball bought another 200000 shares at 1.52
I think this stock does better on lower volume for some reason the higher the volume more then likely its going to drop so hoping for around 620k volume should be a profit day
Oil deliveries for august contracts were done at upper 60s last month. If they fulfill those contracts with today’s oil spot purchases crude logistics is looking to have a good quarter. Now producers are scrambling to get production to market. Water shall be up as well
"""China Orders Top Energy Firms to Secure Supplies at All Cost"" (from Bloomberg today). I think we are going to see energy commodities go through the roof for the foreseeable future."
"Couple interesting quotes buried in Exxon's Sept 7 press release regarding third party nat gas environmental certification:ExxonMobil has selected Poker Lake for certification because of the wide range of technology solutions already in place, scale advantages, proximity to nearby markets, and growth potential as production in New Mexico increases.Approximately 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day from Poker Lake will be assessed and certified. The certified natural gas could be available to customers by fourth quarter 2021."
Don’t forget that this got ripped on shorts after last earnings. Nearly half of the volume came from short coverings. I presume scared retail investors sold at a loss and shorts reaped the benefit from the emotional selling.
"As more people around the world are vaccinated, Delta won’t be a problem. The world will need more oil. The US has just begged OPEC to pump more oil. Ngl will do well in the third and fourth quarters. Krimbill seems to believe that because he maintains the guidance despite a bad first quarter. That means the second Q is the time to accumulate. I expect to see at least $3 by December."
More stock purchases.
CEO buys more stock
Only positive thoughts..Thx.
"nice, SQ will take it to $3 today, we need patience and $5 by year end .............."
"In case anyone cares, debt in NGL is falling in price. I sold at 92 or 93, it is now down to 82 and 84, I think. Meanwhile, PBF bonds are slowly moving up."
"To hit guidance 570- 600m they must perform on all cylinders going forward. Looks tough but water is there.Water 320m/ 80m per quarterCrude 150m/ 50m next 3 quarters Refine 100m/ 35 next 3 quarter. They actually did good on crude because they bought at $61/b and sold at $66 plus shipping rates. It’s the low volume on GM that’s making the stinking derivatives expensive. We have to much capacity in water and crude that NEEDS TO BE FILLED. The refine best quarters are still to come Q3,4. Can water surprise with 400m? Don’t know and probably not. patience is a virtue and everything has its price. Certainly no get rich here"
"Jim I think there has been a buyer at each lower level. He goes to the level after it opens in the am and then sits and takes it in. The trading hasn’t been up and down, just steady. They are accumulating. Also the comment about Ciolek’s 30,000 units awhile back. TBW is right on. He doesn’t see bad times ahead. There is a lot of capitulation going on and throwing overboard. Think MGT is being quite. I’d like to think things are going to come around."
As weird as it sounds…I like being forced to hold my shares for 1+ years so I can get the tax benefit. Lol. I typically sell for a quick profit and get killed on taxes
"Buying NGL for $2 per share is like buying a brand new 2022 Corvette for $5,000...."
"Mike, we are watching like you told us to!!!!"
"John Ciolek purchased 10,000 units this morning at $1.40 a piece. Not much but management seems to have started buying ..."
"Any good news will lift Ngl to $3 immediately. Krimbill confirm the good news for the next Q by purchasing 600,000 units in the last few weeks. Remember what he said? Watch what I do. BTW, is it legal?"
"Almost earning time. If it is bad, unit price go to $1. If it is good, we will see $4 just like last time. I think it is better to buy or hold."
Volume is low. The unhappy investors have left. We go up from here
"The prices of oil and gas are going up. Oil companies are increasing their activities to meet the demand. There is a lot of work for ngl. Ngl business can only go up from now on. If next Q is good, ngl will be at least $3 and it will keep going up"
https://www.currentargus.com/story/news/local/2021/09/29/state-new-mexico-buys-7-500-acres-restore-lesser-prairie-chicken/5905051001/
"There is a clear need to see some expansion of the underutilized assets at NGL - they have a huge amount of acreage that could accommodate solar, solar agriculture for carbon capture, carbon capture partnerships with new technology, etc. Give it five years and their will be more new cities like Las Vegas popping up in the desert which will support manufacturing - they will need electricity and water.....need to get ahead of the curve and leverage all of those acres."
"Pretty big development... Solaris Water Midstream is going for an IPO. This is the most important private competitor to NGL. While NGL has Exxon as its big customer, Solaris has ConocoPhillips. Not sure right now if I view this as good or bad.Something to keep in mind as we still wait for acreage dedication news. Solaris has built up its infrastructure quite a bit, but I'm not sure it's positioned well enough to take anything from NGL."
"Bankruptcy was priced in at $1.86. If Krimbill declares bankruptcy, which is unlikely, the unit price will stay around $1.8. Anything else will lift the price up, maybe even $4 like we have seen this year. The choice is obvious."
Anyone buying ?
Does anyone know when preferred stock dividend is usually declared?
"I think I'm going to cut my buying early given this news with Solaris. In my opinion, the biggest argument for NGL was that they would get the lion's share of all produced water as the Permian grew from a 4.5 million bpd of oil to 8 million bpd over the next 4-5 years. Solaris did not seem to have the ability to challenge that, but they've increased their operation to have a capacity of 900kbpd of recycling and 3 million bpd of produced water capacity. That's on par with NGL's nameplate numbers. They would only go for an IPO if their balance sheet was reasonable and can demonstrate good cash flow. If they intend to raise additional expansion capital through the IPO they can invest in CAPEX while NGL is stuck using all cash flows to repair the balance sheet. They can both take business from NGL and pressure the produced water disposal margins. The $0.56 is already going to fall naturally as skim oil percentages drop. If Solaris is strong enough to undercut water disposal prices that could go pretty significantly lower.The current dedications limit how much solaris can cut into NGL's business and they are already starting to produce and ramp up water volumes. This short term trend should not be effected too much even if Solaris steals a future dedication. NGL growing to a $600-$750 EBITDA range is still likely and that is enough to get to a refinance and a distribution reinstatement for the common. Solaris growing would really only take out the possibility of a $3-$4 distribution down the road.I do feel a little paranoid about the timing with Trey leaving. I think there were enough screw ups in the last few years where it makes sense to make a change. At the same time, why did they just award him 150k units and then kick him out? Did he screw something up on the financing side that hurt the ability to get a dedication? And is Solaris trying to capitalize on it by raising money through an IPO? All very speculative. Nothing to do but wait and see how the quarter results come up, and in November-January we'll see the producers hard numbers for production."
"New Insider Buying - August 26, 2021 James Collingsworth just bought 25,000 units @$1.49 each."
"I didn't take any action when lockdown rumors started getting more realistic because the E&Ps put us in such a tight supply situation that they will stick to their production plans no matter what. I got angry when they wouldn't increase production in the first half of the year, but it will be nice that they don't pull production now. The sticker shock of 1.73 is pretty scary, but I'm transferring IWM winnings to NGL until October so it just means more units.Devon Energy had some good Permian results. I think water will have a serviceable quarter and we'll keep adding produced water disposal from there."
"krimbill our great ceo bought another 200,000 units on august 30,2021.Next Q must be very good."
you people are nuts. did anyone read the announcement. Lindaa been at the forefront of NGL finance issues for the last five years and had. extensive experience with midstream finance in the banking industryyou people talk like she Just got out of ZAccounting 101.
"Goodness people, there is a new CFO, not a messiah. She will not create more revenue and, without Krimbill’s permission/approval, will not cut expenses. as for pulling off some new, miraculous “refinancing”, right now the interested lenders dictate the terms, not anyone on the NGL side"
Krimbill buying $230K of common stock is probably the best news this year. Let’s see how others inside buy this up. This instills massive confidence that they are optimistic on their future!
"when preferreds drop, they very often pause at $7 for awhile."
"I want to see $90mm+ and 1.8mm+ bpd of produced water out of the water segment this quarter. Only bad thing was Hurricanes that may have reduced refinery demand. Otherwise, full quarter of the small recycling project, half quarter of a larger recycling project, +$5 average oil price for skim oil, Exxon already estimated an increase from 400kboepd to 440kboepd, and the start of recovery in non-Permian basins. $90mm+ very possible."
"He collected a nice little divvy for about 8 years - doesn’t make up the overall loss though. Geez, what’s his average? $12"
Rig Count up +9. 4 added in New Mexico and 3 in Texas. Hopefully that translates into more business for NGL.
"The problem with common sense is that it’s not “THAT COMMON. Think about it. Ceo Mike bought half of million of COMMON shares in AUGUST. With that kind of money and at his age, he may have situations in his life such as paying for his parents’ care, or funding a messy divorce, which mean he may not have spare cash to invest in NGL. Honestly, if a CEO has a lot of his own money tied up in stock, he may not make reckless decisions which could endanger the business."
I think earning will be good. Almost all oil related companies report good earnings.
Krimball buys another 100K shares
Isn't it wonderful when NGL Energy closes at the high of the day? Keep it going Krimbill.
So let me get this straight: stock drops from 3.6 to 2.2 to 1.9.to 1.5 and then pops to 1.7 and everyone was right and happy sunshine? Oh man Stockholm syndrome has gone viral.
What I want to know is which joker set the EPS at $.89 when they have had 5 negative EPS in a row. Most recently -66 and -45 and -18. From my point of view they are already in bankruptcy as they need to sell assets at a loss to cover debt payments. And let's not forget all the debt they aren't paying but are liable for. How does a company with $5B in revenue per year go bankrupt? Read the NGL history for the last 3 years to find out!
"At the end of the day, I’m still betting that the next quarter will be better. Super simple thought process - if NGL execs thought it could go lower then it did last month, they wouldn’t have loaded up. AND, I think we would have seen a quick sell when Krimbill’s $1.50 purchase price went to $2.40+. No selling at all by insiders says a lot."
"Only symbolic change, she was moved up to the CFO position. Been there for a while. Knows where the skeletons are."
They are sticking to their guidance of 570-600M EBITDA. They made 91M in Q1. Long way to go!!
entire oil industry pumping and NGL still can't even hit $3.
"Ngl was miserable last year thanks to COVID. The world economy was suddenly frozen. Oil price dived and one of the biggest customers of Ngl went bankrupt. Banks turned hostile to the oil industry. It was hard to find a bank to refinance. Krimbill managed to refinance at a high interest rate saving Ngl from bankruptcy. Now we live in a different world. Oil and gas become red hot. Banks love money so they will lend to oil industry readily. I am sure Krimbill will find a bank to refinance to lower interest rate. On top of that, oil drilling activities are going crazy. Oil rigs count is increasing rapidly. Ngl will soon return to the precovid revenue or better. Finally, attitude toward fossil fuels is changing fast due to the current energy crisis. Just last year most investors thought oil and gas would be dead and replaced by renewable. Now they know renewable is too little to power the world. Money is pouring back to the forgotten oil and gas sector, pushing unit prices ever higher. I believe Ngl current price wil be much higher very soon."
"Management confirmed the full year EBIDTA of $560-$600 million. This affirmation is critical to achieve and holds some key insights. Consider that the 1st qtr was $91. Assuming that Q2 shows improvement in water and has none of the heavy write offs from last quarter - $130m. Some would say that this is bad; however, when you look at what that means for the 3rd and 4th quarters, it gets very interesting: 560-(91+130) = $339. Divide by two for the two remaining qtrs = 169 per quarter. If we look at the Debt to Equity ratio at that level - 3400 debt / 169 EBIDTA annualized (169x4) = 5 - not quite 4.75...On the other hand, if 560 becomes 600, then the same logic yields 4.48 per qtr. That implies 2 of the 4 quarters could be attained in the next 6 months. It is am accounting challenge to align numbers the way you would like them to occur on revenue, but their is always some ""flexibility"" on recognition of expense between qtrs within a year and ""economic outlook"".I welcome feedback on the above calculations, but the main point is we are in a game of achieving EBIDTA of about $180 per qtr to meet the requirements to get back to dividends. How this qtr plays out on the earnings and confirmation of full year will lead to a low range of $2.25 to 2.75 for the next qtr, or with better results a range of 2.75 to 3.25(about 35% from current levels).GLTAL"
BK very very soon.
"Thoughts:1. Why would VP John Ciolek buy 30,000 units a month and a half ago at $2.24? This was after most of fiscal first quarter that will soon be reported was over. Only one reason to buy, right?2. Seems fracking production is slowly coming back but a lot of firms hedged at $40 and once these hedges are over I would think production will come back stronger.3. Strange that unit price is hovering at 52-week low when it rallied nicely last quarter.4. Exxon's Permian production looks solid for NGL:From Exxon's latest conference call:We're also benefiting from ongoing attractive upstream investments as well, especially in the Permian as development performance continues to improve, resulting in rapidly growing value. We produced 400,000 oil equivalent barrels a day this quarter, which was up approximately 50,000 oil equivalent barrels a day versus the second quarter of last year, excluding the impact of the economic curtailments. We expect to grow production a further 40,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the third quarter. And importantly, value is growing even faster as operating and development performance continues to improve at a rate exceeding our plans.Relative to 2019, we've more than doubled the lateral feet we're drilling per day and recently set an industry record by drilling a Delaware Basin 12,500-foot lateral in just 12 days. At the end of the second quarter, our drilling rates are approximately three times more efficient than in 2019. So another way to think about this is that the eight rigs we're running today are achieving the same lateral length as it took close to 25 rigs to drill just two years ago. Completions are improving, too.Our frack rates are around 50% faster. This has resulted in a reduction in drilling and completion costs of more than 40%. And on top of that, we've also improved lease operating expense by about 35%. Our environmental performance also continues to improve.We achieved record low flaring intensity levels during the quarter, which was top quartile in the industry. As we've discussed previously, the advantaged short-cycle development profile of the Permian gives us flexibility within the portfolio. The parameter setting our pace of development have not changed. First, delivering positive free cash flow across a broad range of price scenarios; second, demonstrating we are achieving industry-leading capital efficiency; and third, ensuring double-digit returns and $35 a barrel or less."
OIL IS DOWN AND NGL IS UP GOTTA LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Conoco buys Shell's Permian assets rather than Devon. Devon probably would have been better for NGL, but this acreage may have already been under acreage dedication. More details are something to look out for. Solaris water midstream going public will hopefully fill in a lot of the gaps with things like this."
"NGL even with Friday close while the rest of the market is down 765 points at the time of this comment! Krimbell has added over a million shares since Feb 2020 at an average cost per share of $2.33(this includes the management grant at a cost of $0). I have no doubts that he knows he will make a material return on investment on his purchases. Next milestone....$2.33, and higher soon thereafter. Like the VMR call of $3.25 by Nov 9th!!!!"
Should trade down in opening .Will reinstate my position.Next 24 months is falling in place..
When this going to rise in meaningful way???Sadly I’m avg at over $7.
Exec VP John Ciolek bought 10k shares @ $1.78 on 09/10/21
Let’s be honest. Mike is the board and on last cc you could feel the tension with them both. Mike didn’t say a word. Trey is good guy but didn’t perform up to par when it came to problem solving. He answered all the questions but never provided solutions. I believe this strategy will work. We’re at the later part of quarter and management knows how’s it looking. If the q2 is good with new cfo at the helm things should start to turn. Let’s hope!
"Michael Krimbill bought another 100K shares on Sep 15, 2021.This filing was reported on Sep 15, 2021. The insider acquired a total of 100000 shares at an average price of $1.74, increasing their original shares by 4.18030491144024%.NGL to the moon soon"
"I want to buy, but..."
Anyone buying at $1.50?I will..
"Just a little NGL fun nugget: at $6B (expected) in annual revenue is right now equal to $46 in revenue per NGL share…trading at a cost of $2.40/share. In parallel, XOM revenue per share is $50 and trading at $62/share."
"July 1, 2014... NGL share price... $43...."
I don’t feel comfortable giving any advice on this stock I’m down 58%. Maybe a hurricane in gulf will get a short term bounce and winter is coming ???
Teasing 2.5. Let’s get to 10. It’s high time us longer term holders get something back. Come on!!!
"If we assume 600 million ebitda for future years, wouldn’t NGL be a candidate for a buyout? A suitor would have alot of expensive debt they could payoff and pocket the savings?"
CEO buys stock. Good news.
$1.47 is dirt cheap for a company with 5 bil dollars in revenue and is in no danger of bankruptcy for at least a few years. I feel good that the CEO is competing with me for the units on the open market.
I'll say it again. Geaux Linda Bridges! She's the good luck charm since her ascension!
93 approved drilling application last week in NM. 57 were approved in Eddy County and 36 in Lea County. 54 the week before that. I guess NM likes those royalties after all
"The price here is so attractive that big investors will be buying what is being sold....little by little though. They realize that until any positive news on operations that the price will flounder. Remember, alot of the big firms own positions at prices that are higher than this level and will love to cost average down, but were very happy with the price points at which they purchased before. Watch for update on the 2nd CAPEX update of water recycling that was planned to be brought on by end of July....some update would be reasonable for first 30 days or 60 days. Any positive results of the Open Season bids should add volumes and revenue that make it to the bottom line for profits. Overall market still very positive with pricing well above $55 per barrel - Permian is very profitable for Oil and Gas operators.Next quarter's EBIDTA expected to be $120m to $130m....then OCT-DEC 2021 results expected to be 180m with improved recycling results and Propane/liquids margins.Target Feb 15 2022: $2.75-$3.25 per share"

Does anyone have any analysts' estimates for NGL earnings and EBIDTA over the next few years/quarters?Thanks!
Volume is 3.26 mil. Wow!!! Some institutional investors are buying.
Propane and butane futures at 2-3x historical levels. Going to require a lot of working capital in the liquids segment so I'm not expecting much debt reduction this quarter. June to December is their buying time and it will unwind by the March quarter. Let's hope it at least translates into better margins in the liquids segment.
I know The new CFO is not that rich but it would be nice if she buys a few units.
I have no doubt Ngl will hit $3 if the coming Q is good.

NGL-PC is up 9.84% to 13.66
There is no danger of bankruptcy at least in 2 years. The last Q was not good but not bad either. I am accumulating.
"XTO production will ramp ahead of the noted ""schedule"" as long as the economics are there and the support services can keep up....the ramp to 2025 is a baseline that can be exceeded with current ""unique technology program that brings significant upside to current planning basis""(slide 34, investor presentation).Anyone have an estimate of how much every 100k OEBD means for NGL EBIDTA? 100k barrels per day4.5 barrel cut rate(barrels of produced water)=450,000 per day$0.61 Revenue per year(current disposal rate)= 100,192,500 per yearAgree or disagree with this calculation? And what would be your estimate of what would go to EBIDTA?"
Better buy ngl while you can at a bargain. It will soon be $3 a share
What is going on ??Two really good days. Starting to believe I can get back to my avg of $10
Back to 2014 level. Double digits very soon.
"Krimbill bought another 200,000 shares today"
"Wonder what’s going on??Sadly, one of the suckers who bought in at 10 and watch this bleed to insignificance. Hope and pray I can break even someday."
"One issue with this quarter and this fiscal year earnings...On August 9, NGL had their conference call regarding Q1 earnings which were not good. One excuse former CFO Trey Karlovich gave was ""We have some inventory and hedging noise impacting our crude segment this quarter, which we expect to make up this year as we turn our inventory and realize our current hedge positions."" He further said ""we estimate that about 15 million of deferred profits is in our inventory and hedge book, and will be recognized in the coming quarters as we turn inventory and realize current hedge positions. THIS ASSUMES CRUDE PRICES DO NOT ESCALATE SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THIS PERIOD OF TIME"".Well, on the day Karlovich said that, WTI was trading at $68 a barrel. Today, a month and a half later, the price has risen almost 11% and everybody and their grandmother are calling for sky high prices in oil and natural gas by year end.I wonder if these poor hedge decisions by former CFO Trey Karlovich are the reason for his departure. What did Mr. Karlovich mean by ""escalate significantly""? How do you think today's and tomorrow's oil price will affect NGL's earnings?"
Can anyone explain why volume is 1.7mm trades but price nearly the same?
6 days in a row in the green no hotter stock out there right now!!!!!!!!!!! obviously the percentage it has gone up isnt great but this a hidden gem
ngl survived the worst year last year when oil price crashed due to global lockdown.Now oil price is going up.The world is opening up.DEmand for its water service is up .I think the fear of bankrupcy is unfounded.I expect the price will double in 6 months.
Shale oil activities are going crazy in the US. We are going to be rich.
I think at $1.50 risk/reward becomes attractive.Will buy at that price..
Who would be selling it at a loss? What could be a better investment in a bear market like now? Help me out folks.
Propane up 15% in trading today.....wonder how much NGL has?

"If you believe NGL will go under soon,you should sell and leave.If you believe NGL will survive for at least 2 years and bring back the distribution,you should accumulate at this price.I am accumulating a lot because I believe NGL will survive thanks to the refinancing and the favorable macro environment. Demand for NGL service can only go up as America and the world open up."
We have a new CFO
"I still feel like their could be an M&A play here - even with the debt, the assets are big and could complement another big oil company with midstream needs and water solutions. The debt will be paid off quicker due to broader company efficiencies…especially redundancies in people…"
"Solaris Water is apparently going to be publicly traded as Aris Water Solutions, Inc. (ARIS). The IPO document is a treasure trove of information. Their asset footprint is smaller than I expected. Produced water volumes of about 720kbwpd which is about half of NGL's in the same area. They have one pretty good block of what I think is Chevron acreage, and then a lot of areas interspersed in NGL territory. $77mm of CAPEX this year is quite large for their size. NGL seems to be lower cost ($0.61 per barrel vs ARIS $0.647 per barrel) and higher effective margin. I think ARIS will end up with something like $150mm EBITDA for 2022.I think NGL has the upper hand to either choke them out or acquire ARIS over time. Getting the 2 dedications would ensure it!"
"Industries beaten down by Covid and ceos that have put their money where there mouth is. David Simon ceo of Simon Property On March 17, Simon bought 150,000 shares of SPG stock at a weighted average share price of $60.83, for a total outlay of $9.1 million. Now 128.00 shareYou couldn’t catch me within 10 yards of a fitness facility at this point. But CEO Christopher Rondeau bought 20,000 shares of his company’s stock planet fitness March 12 at prices between $50.54 and $51.24. Now 68.00CEO of kinder Morgan Here’s a record of Kinder’s recent purchases.March 11: 500,000 shares at $15.51 March 5: 300,000 shares at $19.51 Feb. 28: 300,000 shares at $18.88Feb. 26: 300,000 shares at $20.72 Now 15.50. Patience is a virtue"
"Lots of early day volume - I’d assume there’s quite a bit of shorts covering. Man, they cleaned up the past month!"
The new cfo should show confidence in Ngl by buying a few hundred thousand units. Lead by example.
"Regarding Solaris going public:1. It shows that water assets in the Permian Basin are valuable.2. Will show value in NGL when investors compare valuations of Solaris and NGL and wonder why Solaris with less assets is worth 10x more. (keep in mind that NGL has 2 other divisions in addition to 3 million barrels a day in takeaway capacity.)3. Touting the environmental benefit on water recycling is something NGL PR should have been doing since they started, maybe Solaris will do NGL's job for them in that respect.4. One possible negative is that Solaris will have a larger war chest to compete for future contracts until NGL is done with deleveraging.5. I am sure that NGL has more water rights than Solaris.Lets stick with the plan of deleveraging as fast as we can and then re-instate the distribution.Hopefully we all win in the end."
"Not the best news: WaterBridge Announces Strategic Acquisition of Produced Water Assets and Expanded Dedication with Colgate Energy in the Delaware BasinWaterBridge is probably bigger than Solaris Water Midstream, but less of a direct competitor in the Delaware. This was not exactly NGL's wheelhouse, but you have to wonder what NGL is missing out on while we de-lever..."
Would sure be nice to know if the Grand Mesa open season resulted in anything. PDC energy? OXY? Some private?
"By all means XTO/XOM is by far NGLs largest customer in the Delaware basin. 400 wells and 23+ active rigs. Anyone can blame management for all the debt and the loss of shareholders value during the past 2 years. But in reality, it’s not that easy bringing out the value of a water midstreamer in such a huge scale. It takes time to build and Scale is where the money is. It helps reduce cost, and reduces trucking by supplying pipelines. Not to mention reliability, safety record, operational efficiency and, ultimately, TRUST! No trust, no customer. I guess now, the wave is turning in the partnerships favor with all these water mergers and acquisitions"
3 days in a row profit lets make it 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and the oil pre market lookign amazing as well
Let's go . NGL is on a winning streak.
There is an energy crisis in China and Europe. Anything related to oil and gas is hot. NGL will survive and thrive.
Earning is actually not that bad.
