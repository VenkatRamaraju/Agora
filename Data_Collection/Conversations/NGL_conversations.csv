It's getting some value back. The debt will be a hindrance because the analyst won't look at the whole picture. When revenue report comes next month is the true test to see if the market has it right. Regardless of report this is a multibillion dollar company with thousands of employees and numerable assets and NGL should hold it's value and continue to rise and eventually start paying dividends again. This company has been around over 70 years and has weathered many storms.
"It is buying opportunity. There is no bad news. There is good news, the CEO bought a lot of units. Ngl goes down because some investors are scared. Baseless fear is the reason Ngl is a good buy now."
"John, still down 4% on my ngl purchase. Should of double down at the bottom, might add more here. love the chart now lets see the proof"
"In effect; The price of oil etc is irrelevant. The key thing is how much margin NGL can generate. Hope they haven?t done stupid #$%$ and have a bad Q3. It?s looking ominous, as normally there is a pre earnings lift. I have a crazy amount of shares so want nothing more than NGL to recover!!!"
"Management confirmed the full year EBIDTA of $560-$600 million. This affirmation is critical to achieve and holds some key insights. Consider that the 1st qtr was $91. Assuming that Q2 shows improvement in water and has none of the heavy write offs from last quarter - $130m. Some would say that this is bad; however, when you look at what that means for the 3rd and 4th quarters, it gets very interesting: 560-(91+130) = $339. Divide by two for the two remaining qtrs = 169 per quarter. If we look at the Debt to Equity ratio at that level - 3400 debt / 169 EBIDTA annualized (169x4) = 5 - not quite 4.75...On the other hand, if 560 becomes 600, then the same logic yields 4.48 per qtr. That implies 2 of the 4 quarters could be attained in the next 6 months. It is am accounting challenge to align numbers the way you would like them to occur on revenue, but their is always some ""flexibility"" on recognition of expense between qtrs within a year and ""economic outlook"".I welcome feedback on the above calculations, but the main point is we are in a game of achieving EBIDTA of about $180 per qtr to meet the requirements to get back to dividends. How this qtr plays out on the earnings and confirmation of full year will lead to a low range of $2.25 to 2.75 for the next qtr, or with better results a range of 2.75 to 3.25(about 35% from current levels).GLTAL"
"US Energy Information AdministrationOctober 29, 2021Residential propane prices start winter heating season at highest level since 2011The average U.S. residential price of propane reached $2.59 per gallon (gal) as of October 4, 2021, the highest price reported for the first week of the winter heating season since 2011, according to our Heating Oil and Propane Update (HOPU). The winter heating season runs from October through March. Prices during the first four weeks of the current winter heating season were 49% higher than the same time last winter."
here is what bothers me. last qtr there was no positive press releases and the result was bad qtr and the stock tanked. this wtr the only positive news was insider trading but no positive press releases about the business. so I think we are looking at the same thing that happened last qtr. I hope I am wrong but.... if the business has positive news you would think they would release it. but mothing.
"Just a little NGL fun nugget: at $6B (expected) in annual revenue is right now equal to $46 in revenue per NGL share…trading at a cost of $2.40/share. In parallel, XOM revenue per share is $50 and trading at $62/share."
"WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?""During the quarter, production volumes in the Permian averaged approximately 500,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, an increase of approximately 30% from the third quarter of 2020.""In July's earnings they estimated 440kboepd..."
Inflation is here and will continue to rise. This may just help NGL Energy pay off debt a lot quicker than planned.
Oct 29 -- Rig Count up again. They added one in Colorado.
Oil is up again. We haven’t seen a favorable macro environment like this for ngl in a long time. It is like the red carpet has been rolled out to welcome Krimbill. The question is : can he walk?
"anyone got an idea on EBIDTA or variable cost is for each barrel of additional water disposal? Revenue was at 0.61 per barrel ....300,000 barrels per day being added between 2nd qtr and end of year. I have estimated approx. .52 per barrel to EBIDTA at current capacity levels. 300k × .52 x 365 days..57M added to EBIDTA for next year. That would be a nice addition on the way to 700m EBIDTA per year next year."
"They will announce earning call soon. Oil drilling in the US is going crazy. It will be a good Q. If it is a good Q, the next one will even be better. I hope to see $5 even this year."
"Enterprise value is almost 4 billion dollars. Market cap is only $380 million. The current price is the same as last year when the oil industry is almost dead. A lot has happened since then. Oil is now $84. The oil industry is on steroid. They are drilling like crazy and they are using Ngl water service. Do you guys think the current price is fair? I believe Ngl is extremely undervalued considering the favorable macro environment. If I am right, we will see improvement this earning and it will get better and better. Unit price will go much higher when they reinstall distribution."
"Solaris Water is apparently going to be publicly traded as Aris Water Solutions, Inc. (ARIS). The IPO document is a treasure trove of information. Their asset footprint is smaller than I expected. Produced water volumes of about 720kbwpd which is about half of NGL's in the same area. They have one pretty good block of what I think is Chevron acreage, and then a lot of areas interspersed in NGL territory. $77mm of CAPEX this year is quite large for their size. NGL seems to be lower cost ($0.61 per barrel vs ARIS $0.647 per barrel) and higher effective margin. I think ARIS will end up with something like $150mm EBITDA for 2022.I think NGL has the upper hand to either choke them out or acquire ARIS over time. Getting the 2 dedications would ensure it!"
"Ngl was miserable last year thanks to COVID. The world economy was suddenly frozen. Oil price dived and one of the biggest customers of Ngl went bankrupt. Banks turned hostile to the oil industry. It was hard to find a bank to refinance. Krimbill managed to refinance at a high interest rate saving Ngl from bankruptcy. Now we live in a different world. Oil and gas become red hot. Banks love money so they will lend to oil industry readily. I am sure Krimbill will find a bank to refinance to lower interest rate. On top of that, oil drilling activities are going crazy. Oil rigs count is increasing rapidly. Ngl will soon return to the precovid revenue or better. Finally, attitude toward fossil fuels is changing fast due to the current energy crisis. Just last year most investors thought oil and gas would be dead and replaced by renewable. Now they know renewable is too little to power the world. Money is pouring back to the forgotten oil and gas sector, pushing unit prices ever higher. I believe Ngl current price wil be much higher very soon."

"1.) From last call, water services growing toward 2m barrels per day in full fiscal year. Key to watch - how fast is that being brought on?2.) Ambassador Pipeline purchased for $18.1 million earlier this year(March 2021). Key to watch - how much will be contributed to EBIDTA for this addition - ROI?3.) DJ Basin production is improving with the consolidations including XOG. Key to watch - what results from the Grand Mesa Open Season, and opportunities going forward?4.) How is the FY estimate for EBIDTA evolving?5.) Opportunities for refinancing earlier in that the industry has a more favorable view from consumers?6.) Looking past 2023 - opportunities to grow into ecological long term energies/energy services, and utilization of large current assets of land and recycled water?Others?"
New Mexico rig count now at 87. It was 50 a year ago. Water biz will kick it going forward. DJ basin making a comeback as well. Charts look like NGL is about to move considerably higher soon.
"Civitas (Extraction + Bonanza Creek + Crestone Peak + High Point) kept flat production. Merger should finalize imminently and hopefully they'll guide to a higher 2022. PDC Energy's production has been ticking up consistently. I'm not sure they ship on Grand Mesa, but even if they're filling other pipe capacity that is still good for us. I guess we're hoping for private companies and second hand wells to get us some growth on Grand Mesa. It will fill eventually, but our main customer sure isn't helping us."
"Bloomberg Oct 11, 2021Oil prices above $80 a barrel are once again spurring a revival of shale drilling in America’s biggest oil field, where production is expected to return to pre-pandemic highs within weeks.Only this time, the surge is being driven by private operators, rather than the publicly traded companies that fueled the previous booms. And they see little reason to slow things down.Increased access to financing and strong oil demand has created an opening for closely held producers, most of whom are backed by private equity or family money, to ramp up output in West Texas and southeast New Mexico. With the other major U.S. shale basins either holding steady or declining, according to BloombergNEF, the surging growth in the Permian isn’t likely to risk upsetting OPEC or tanking crude prices as it did in previous shale booms—at least not yet.---"
"In looking at a Wells Fargo outlook for NGL, they have taken a very conservative estimate of the EBIDTA and Earnings. It would appear that their is a strengthening argument that while fiscal 2022 will have a loss, FY 2023 may have EPU of $0.72 or more - this will become clearly evident in the next two quarters. Look at PAA midstream....NGL will be back at $10-15 per share in 18 months."
"Oct. 28, 2021 (Bloomberg) -- Oil fell for a second day as one of the top energy diplomats in the U.S. urged producers to hike output."
"Given the management guidance of the last ER, lower end of $560-600m....$100m for the second quarter and confirmation of the range is a win in my book! it will provide EBIDTA at a level that will be close to meeting the 4.75 ratio for the 3rd and 4th quarters. Price should be $3.25 or higher at Nov 9 earnings release call,"
NGL/ Any news about Q 3 result ?
There is an energy crisis. Crude paused today but will go up again.
"Strong top line should be a home run. The issue is can they produce margin, give belief that they can pay down debt and pay some dividends??? Come on NGL!!"
"TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NGL Energy Partners LP (NYSE: NGL) announced today that NGL plans to issue its fiscal 2022 second quarter ended September 30, 2021, earnings press release post-market close on Tuesday, November 9, 2021. Members of NGL’s management team intend to host an earnings"
So is it the general consensus that this drop over the last couple of trading sessions is simply profit taking from the recent runup? or is it a sign of something deeper - a real issue with the company's earnings expectations for the past quarter?
"Exxon reports earnings this week and EOG and Devon report next week. Not a peep from NGL on when the earnings call will be. I don't expect anything out of Linda, but if she could make this ship run a little tighter it would be great. Upload the presentation before the call. Start the call on time. Get us a direct link in the investors section with replay capability. Issue press releases when operation threatening weather and natural disasters occur. Start acting like a multi-billion dollar enterprise value company."
it's becoming a joke now. but not real funny. 2.75 to 2.27 in two weeks with no news. got to admit funny stuff but I am not laughing.
"Kinda agreeing with the pre Q earning spike. But the June one was on the (sadly wrong) optimism on the refinancing right??But..:let’s go, more green, match back up to over $10 with a dividend would be a marvellous Xmas present"
Just need a good Q2 earnings report. Give the belief they can pay down debt. Come on NGL!!
"So what is a fair value. I see from latest investor presention enterprise value is $4.45 B. Might be $4.6 B with increase in stock price.FY2021 ""adjusted EBITDA"" was $487.8 million.Projecting $560 to $600 M for FY 2022.Do companies like this trade at 9X ""adjusted EBITDA""? If so then company is fairly priced, but I think it might trade at 7 or 8X.Thoughts?"
"Aris Water Solutions, an environmental infrastructure company, along with the biotech Xilio Therapeutics, and the medical technology company Minerva Surgical, listed their shares.Shares of Aris Water (ticker: ARIS) opened at $15.85, peaked at $15.89 and closed at $14.30, up 10% from its offer price. One reason for weakness today.Aris raised nearly $214 million, making it Friday’s biggest deal. The Houston company sold 17.65 million shares at $13 each, less than its planned $16 to $18 price range. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are underwriters on the deal."
"Exxon also increased Permian guidance to a 2021 outlook of 440-460 kboepd, implying a Q4 production of 460-540kboepd after this insane 500kboepd"
CEO knew this Q would be good when he bought a lot of units last month. He already had the numbers in his hand.
"NGL has spiked into quarterly earnings in previous months - most notable $3+ 2 quarters ago....we have many positives coming into the end of this quarter, some being positives not realized in the market yet. Last quarter management recognized many of the negatives which lowered EBIDTA. The question for this quarter is if this is the first of the improved quarters, or another bite the bullet quarter. I am OK with either as long as the year EBIDTA is confirmed again at $560 - 600. Improved water services noted in the last quarter call should have provided more confidence in the remainder of the year. Any improvements in Propane with the purchase of the Ambassador Pipeline back in March, and any added volumes from the Grand Mesa ""Open Season"" will help ensure sufficient EBIDTA to have 4.75 ratio for the next 4 quarters. Any negative surprises for the next two quarters will push that out likely for a year. Oh, and listen for rumors of refinancing the debt. It could be logical that stronger growth could open that opportunity and with Linda's knowledge, I would look to see that come to fruition sooner than later! 2% reduction of the the loan rate would fund a $.50 per share annual dividend and drive the price back to previous levels. Also, they have many assets (land, technology, skilled workforce) that is capable of growing the business back to revenue levels in business with much higher margins. Management can deliver this with focus and effort!GLTAL"
Some investors sold because they were haunted by the last few pre- earning rally. But they fail to notice a big difference. This time the ceo bought a lot of units. CEO sells for a lot of different reasons but they buy for only one reason: They expect the price to go up.
