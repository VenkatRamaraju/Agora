"So the last response on EC trey explains the Hedge. So if crude prices rise very quickly NGL is in a loss. Since they pay for crude daily, they don’t get paid by the refiners until the end of the entire average monthly price. If the AMP is lower or backward hedge is lower and they paid more for crude during the month, LOSS. But it can also be opposite, thus GAIN. So going forward, more opec crude should pressure price down. Hopefully! Thus why the huge capital expense for purchases during the quarter."
As weird as it sounds…I like being forced to hold my shares for 1+ years so I can get the tax benefit. Lol. I typically sell for a quick profit and get killed on taxes
So Trey the cfo was the cause of our misery?What did he accomplish during his time with ngl?
What I want to know is which joker set the EPS at $.89 when they have had 5 negative EPS in a row. Most recently -66 and -45 and -18. From my point of view they are already in bankruptcy as they need to sell assets at a loss to cover debt payments. And let's not forget all the debt they aren't paying but are liable for. How does a company with $5B in revenue per year go bankrupt? Read the NGL history for the last 3 years to find out!
"All this huff and puff about UAE wanting more production in OPEC+ will blow over soon enough. I don't think any of the parties involved have a death wish, so some type of compromise will occur.The only major event was the sawtooth sale which I'm not sure makes it onto the adjusted ebitda line. Otherwise, the quarter results should give us a good baseline of volumes for both water and grand mesa. I'm hoping for anything greater than 1.5mm bpd of water disposal and above 1.8mm would be a blockbuster number. As tempting as it is to keep investing in NGL past October, it's getting close to 50% of my portfolio and I need to start derisking the income/oil focused investments with something like EPD. Still a while to go for NGL, but I think everything is looking good as of now."
"NGL Energy Partners LP Announces 2021 Open Season for Grand Mesa Pipeline Starting July 9, 2021... In 2016, NGL held an open season seeking commitments from shippers interested in shipping on Grand Mesa’s pipeline system. In response to the 2016 open season, Grand Mesa signed transportation service agreements with multiple shippers. Due to recent shipper bankruptcies and related contract terminations, committed capacity on Grand Mesa’s system has become available again. Accordingly, NGL is holding the current open season to re-contract available capacity on the Grand Mesa pipeline. The transportation services under this open season process are being offered pursuant to terms and conditions that are substantially similar to those applicable to the committed shippers that signed transportation service agreements in the 2016 open season, as specified in the open season documents."
What is going on ??Two really good days. Starting to believe I can get back to my avg of $10
Do we know Krimball’s average now? I assume still $10+ given that he has been buying for years
"CEO, CFO, directors, managers, all of them should buy at this price to show confidence in their company. They lead, we will follow."
How low is this going. Any clue??
"I expect we will have some ""real"" analyst coverage and updates in the next 30 days which will start this price back up....last update was Wells Fargo with target of $2.65."
Obviously a 2022 investment..Either ur In or Out.Risk is high.Rewards are high.
What can I say about 52 week low. Only more sellers than buyers and emotions influences better judgment when it comes to investing. Trading as if bankruptcy is imminent.
NGL-PB is up 7.48% to 11.50
"With liquidity where it is, I hope NGL is monitoring its positions because if a margin call occurs that could go really bad. Especially in light of the ""certain restricted payment provisions"" covenants from the 2021 Debt Package."
Volume is 2.17 million. Something very good is happening.
"$NGL I think an interesting comparison is $OXY in terms of measuring how undervalued NGL is. Similar debt to equity ratio, ROI and recent EPS. OXY does have more annual revenue (OXY is $18B and NGL is $6B) and better gross margin, but still quite a bit of similar metrics. Here’s the major difference: OXY has a $23B market cap and NGL has a $275M market cap. "
Any of you guys checking the 2025 PBF bonds? Getting sold off like crazy. Wonder if refiners are just taking it hard right now because of the african sun beetle migration patterns or something. I give up trying understand the psycho-political phantom pressure oil lives under while pretty much everything else lives in the rational world.
Earnings call will be next Monday. We will see at least $3.
Well first limit order done at 1.47. Lets try another
"Should be $2.50 before end of September, IMO"
When this going to rise in meaningful way???Sadly I’m avg at over $7.
crazy downtrend..goodluck investor
I'll say it again. Geaux Linda Bridges! She's the good luck charm since her ascension!
"Thoughts:1. Why would VP John Ciolek buy 30,000 units a month and a half ago at $2.24? This was after most of fiscal first quarter that will soon be reported was over. Only one reason to buy, right?2. Seems fracking production is slowly coming back but a lot of firms hedged at $40 and once these hedges are over I would think production will come back stronger.3. Strange that unit price is hovering at 52-week low when it rallied nicely last quarter.4. Exxon's Permian production looks solid for NGL:From Exxon's latest conference call:We're also benefiting from ongoing attractive upstream investments as well, especially in the Permian as development performance continues to improve, resulting in rapidly growing value. We produced 400,000 oil equivalent barrels a day this quarter, which was up approximately 50,000 oil equivalent barrels a day versus the second quarter of last year, excluding the impact of the economic curtailments. We expect to grow production a further 40,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the third quarter. And importantly, value is growing even faster as operating and development performance continues to improve at a rate exceeding our plans.Relative to 2019, we've more than doubled the lateral feet we're drilling per day and recently set an industry record by drilling a Delaware Basin 12,500-foot lateral in just 12 days. At the end of the second quarter, our drilling rates are approximately three times more efficient than in 2019. So another way to think about this is that the eight rigs we're running today are achieving the same lateral length as it took close to 25 rigs to drill just two years ago. Completions are improving, too.Our frack rates are around 50% faster. This has resulted in a reduction in drilling and completion costs of more than 40%. And on top of that, we've also improved lease operating expense by about 35%. Our environmental performance also continues to improve.We achieved record low flaring intensity levels during the quarter, which was top quartile in the industry. As we've discussed previously, the advantaged short-cycle development profile of the Permian gives us flexibility within the portfolio. The parameter setting our pace of development have not changed. First, delivering positive free cash flow across a broad range of price scenarios; second, demonstrating we are achieving industry-leading capital efficiency; and third, ensuring double-digit returns and $35 a barrel or less."
"John Ciolek purchased 10,000 units this morning at $1.40 a piece. Not much but management seems to have started buying ..."
"How long should we hold NGL for wait for divvies to come back? GEL, PAA and ET are back to less than $10. My hard earned $$ could use their divvies than waiting for divvies here."
"Back in March of 2020 as oil prices tumble so did the share price of NGL. In essence the more the price of crude tumble the more NGL fell. Why doesn’t higher oil and gas prices provide a direct benefit to the share price now?Debt the same.Water volumes almost sameCrude logistics not same, but isn’t timing the market the driver for investing?"
"Energy Transfer cut dividend but didn't offer any explanation. NGL, too, cut dividend but did offer business outlook. The extent of price reaction to the dividend cut is disappointing. Instead of making speculative remarks we really need to wait until November 9 earnings call to hear out the management. Still the following are my plus & minus reactions-1. In the update they talked positively about Water & Liquids segments but no mention of Crude logistics - I am curious to hear the outlook on that business after loss of XOG contract.2. Today Exxonmobil announced 15% workforce reduction mostly in management. Hopefully, the company will be in a better cost position to grow Permian fields.3. Management can't be faulted for COVID-19. Although, the fear of sustained lockdowns are back and the oil price as well as NGL price visiting the first lockdown values. This time around we are much closer to vaccines and therapeutics so uncertainty regarding long term lockdowns is lot less.4. October is mutual fund's tax loss selling month- which is now coming to a close.5. The stocks is also facing significant headwind due to Biden's new Green Deal. I just can't imagine the transition from O&G to renewables to happen in his Presidential term. We need O&G for many years to convert energy production infra to Green energy infra. If Biden wins he may get 3 trillion stimulus & 2 trillion for Green deal. And with renewables representing less than 10% of energy, you can spend 5 trillions w/o using a whole lot of O&G. It takes a lot of energy to make & install wind turbines, renewable power plants & energy storage systems."
Isn't it wonderful when NGL Energy closes at the high of the day? Keep it going Krimbill.
Next Q will be good. Water is doing very well.
"OPEC+ deal in line with what makes sense. Need to dodge any major lockdowns and production should have a slow and steady return. High-grading to Permian production and slight increases are enough to get NGL to where they need to be.Not great news for the get rich quick crowd, but I'm not sure anything in the market is looking good for the get rich quick crowd right now."
The new cfo has connections in the bank world.We will refinance at lower interest rate for sure.Banks are more ready to lend when the oil industry is strong.They are after the money.
"If you run a company that is going bankrupt, would you spend $350,000 to buy it’s worthless shares? There is something I am 100% sure. Krimbill has no intention of filing for chapter 11. So we can stop talking about bankruptcy now."
"I didn't take any action when lockdown rumors started getting more realistic because the E&Ps put us in such a tight supply situation that they will stick to their production plans no matter what. I got angry when they wouldn't increase production in the first half of the year, but it will be nice that they don't pull production now. The sticker shock of 1.73 is pretty scary, but I'm transferring IWM winnings to NGL until October so it just means more units.Devon Energy had some good Permian results. I think water will have a serviceable quarter and we'll keep adding produced water disposal from there."
you people are nuts. did anyone read the announcement. Lindaa been at the forefront of NGL finance issues for the last five years and had. extensive experience with midstream finance in the banking industryyou people talk like she Just got out of ZAccounting 101.
Ngl earning will be good today.
We have a new CFO
"Bankruptcy was priced in at $1.86. If Krimbill declares bankruptcy, which is unlikely, the unit price will stay around $1.8. Anything else will lift the price up, maybe even $4 like we have seen this year. The choice is obvious."
I wonder if they sold their oil inventory they were sitting on…do they have to announce that? That’s worth about $50M at these commodity prices
The metrics for NGL point to great instability in the near term and the next earnings report is vital to its continuation as a going concern. The recent purchases by insiders are serving to stabilize the stock price in order to prevent an absolute sell-off and possible bankruptcy.
"Wonder what’s going on??Sadly, one of the suckers who bought in at 10 and watch this bleed to insignificance. Hope and pray I can break even someday."
"Michael Krimbill bought another 100K shares on Sep 15, 2021.This filing was reported on Sep 15, 2021. The insider acquired a total of 100000 shares at an average price of $1.74, increasing their original shares by 4.18030491144024%.NGL to the moon soon"
Didn’t they push $40mm of sales into this quarter from last?
"Just found this from Whiting Petroleum: ""Whiting also entered into an agreement to divest its Redtail assets, including associated midstream assets, located in Weld County, Colorado to a private entity for total cash consideration of $187 million, before typical closing adjustments. The assets span 67,278 net acres with daily production of approximately 7,100 BOE/d (51% oil). ... divesting of properties in Colorado that were not going to compete internally for capital.""The important part is someone who isn't Civitas made a move in that area. Perhaps this is why NGL went with the Grand Mesa open season around the same time. Might be a new customer or an old one looking to increase production."
Got in at $1.76 going too take my profit..
"On June 18, 2021, NGL Energy Partners LP (“we,” “us,” “our” or “the Partnership”) sold its 71.5% interest in Sawtooth Caverns LLC (“Sawtooth”) and associated assets to a group of buyers for total consideration of $70 million less estimated expenses of approximately $2.1 million. Sawtooth previously comprised a portion of the Partnership’s Liquids Logistics segment."
"The price here is so attractive that big investors will be buying what is being sold....little by little though. They realize that until any positive news on operations that the price will flounder. Remember, alot of the big firms own positions at prices that are higher than this level and will love to cost average down, but were very happy with the price points at which they purchased before. Watch for update on the 2nd CAPEX update of water recycling that was planned to be brought on by end of July....some update would be reasonable for first 30 days or 60 days. Any positive results of the Open Season bids should add volumes and revenue that make it to the bottom line for profits. Overall market still very positive with pricing well above $55 per barrel - Permian is very profitable for Oil and Gas operators.Next quarter's EBIDTA expected to be $120m to $130m....then OCT-DEC 2021 results expected to be 180m with improved recycling results and Propane/liquids margins.Target Feb 15 2022: $2.75-$3.25 per share"
I think at $1.50 risk/reward becomes attractive.Will buy at that price..
"If Krimbill and management really believe in what they are preaching , they should buy as much as they can now."
"If there was real value here, you would think every insider would be loading the boat at $1.50. So far...Nothing to speak of!"
There is no danger of bankruptcy at least in 2 years. The last Q was not good but not bad either. I am accumulating.
"It appears NGL Energy's new 2026 Bonds have been placed and already selling on secondary market with high activity and interest. They are currently trading above par at $101.75.This unties NGL's hands from overbearing bankers and allows the company freedom to grow and prosper. It also gives the board the freedom to pay distributions on preferred and common. As you can check for yourself, the current coverage on the common distribution is over 4x and that is during a pandemic. Since this board loves to speculate, how do you think the price of common and preferred units will react when NGL reports the successful closing of the offering on February 5th with no disruption to distributions?"
Bottom area around $1.28..will buy at that level
R3 level is 1.69. Lets see if we can break that.
"Every time i think, I just bought at a new low, ha."
Does anyone have any analysts' estimates for NGL earnings and EBIDTA over the next few years/quarters?Thanks!
"Wow! Krimbill has just bought 200,000 units. This is very bullish."
"Let's look at the numbers :- Revenue: Up 76% to $1.49 billion.- Operating loss: Up more than sixfold to $69 million.- Earnings (loss) per share: Loss of $1.23 a share, versus a loss of 0.44 per share in the same quarter last year.So if I am interpreting this right, the more revenue NGL generates, the greater their loss on that revenue? They are clearly giving away services and product in order to book revenue. On a similar note, Q1 they lost $69 Million. On July 1, NGL paid out $40+ Million in bonuses. They are laughing at all the bond holders for providing the cash to continue paying themselves.Good work if you can get it."
Some day you guys will regret not to buy at $1.5.
"Buying NGL for $2 per share is like buying a brand new 2022 Corvette for $5,000...."
"Intrepid potash is very small compared to ngl. Q4 6M in water sales, which is not even 10% of what ngl does. And thats because sales grew 33% in Q4. they are small and nimble, and are a great indicator of where water sales are going. I like the question asked in Q4 earnings. So, I'll ask, is the recycling opportunity? How does -- as you see it now, how that compares to the market opportunity that's a little bit more tangible in freshwater rights and water disposal.Is it equal or greater or perhaps earlier stage?Bob Jornayvaz -- Co-Founder, Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive OfficerI think it's greater. Quite frankly, every single oil company is trying to move toward a recycling component, but you need source water, either fresh water or brackish water, to start the flywheel. And so, despite operators' claims of very high percentages of recycled water. I'd say right now, it's in the 25 to 30%. But we're seeing the technology that can easily take it to 50% in 2021 and grow it from there. So, we see it as first and foremost, where the regulators and the politicians want to take it so that we're not fighting battles over river water, Agawala water, etc. It enables everyone to get on the same ESG page and move it forward.So the last ngl business update is following pretty close to the intrepid comment"
I want to see the CFO buy some units. He always sounds optimistic in earning calls.
"At this low price, ngl is worth only less than 200 million dollars for a 5 bil dollar in revenue. Some people with deep pockets may buy the whole company and take it private."
Ngl is up 5.4%. Someone is loading.
I bought at $2.38.and a bunch at !.50 which I traded for a profit.I am going too buy on any dip and hold this time..Just my thoughts
Wow real winner here down 5% and mercantile price up .15 today…when it rains it pours
"NGL Energy buyout? There was an article a few months back that suggested NGL Enregy was a possible takeover target due to its depressed market cap as the value of the enterprise was worth much higher than wall st. was giving them credit for. Personally, I did not give that article much thought. Now that NGL Energy is trading around $8 a unit with a market cap of $1 billion, I started to think if the argument from that article had any validity. Remember that NGL just acquired Mesquite for $900 million and Hillstone for $600 million. As NGL CEO Mike Krimbill stated that these were the best two targets in the Delaware basin. That is 1.5 billion. Compare that with NGL's market cap of $1 billion. Also keep in mind that private equity is still buying up water disposal assets in the Permian as Anonymous posted a link to a recent purchase by WaterBridge. So a buyer would be getting Hillstone, Mesquite, NGL's other significant water assets, the crude logistics division and the Liquids and Marketing division. Of course they would get NGL's outstanding debt as well and they would have to offer a substantial premium.The last point is that NGL just hired John Ciolek, a specialist in divestitures and acquisitions. With NGL's recent record quarter, the safe distribution payout and coverage and growth prospects, I believe NGL is a great investment. The midstream industry as a whole is trading at 52 week lows so the depressed unit price is not company specific.Anyways. I am just thinking out loud."
Anyone buying at !1.50...?
Our town abandoned aquafer water because they said saltwater was infiltrating the aquafer. We switched to Lake Michigan water. So why can't NGL create water systems that will allow towns to stay on aquafers?
this was 2.5 in premarket.
"Talk about putting all your eggs in one basket. Solaris ipo is expected to fetch 1B valuation. How can a company with 5x debt leverage and 80% of its revenues supported by acreage dedications and minimum volumes commitments from COP be valued so high? NGL with more capacity in 3 basins(premian,DJ,eagle Ford)crude logistics and liquids be valued less than 300M? The IMPORTANCE of having a producer as a stake holder! I hope xom follows cop steps"

"I honestly believed the inflection point wouldn’t of been reached till sometime next year. But forecast data for October for the premian alone anticipates another increase of 4% in disposal market in the fourth quarter, which will bring the size of the market to a record 1.3 billion bbl per quarter. Not to mention the recycle and reuse business side. It’s been a tough fiscal 2021, with Covid, price war, extraction, Urí. Fiscal 2022 is looking total opposite for NGL. The sling shot is barely being stretched. Let’s see how much it recoils!"
"Just issued -Commons and preferred distributions suspended til leverage falls below 4.75x. February 4, 2021 4:18 PM ESTNGL Closes Refinancing of Revolving Credit Facility which Extends Maturities to 2026 and Increases Liquidity; Provides Distribution Update TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 4, 2021-- NGL Energy Partners LP (NYSE: NGL) (“the “Partnership” or “NGL”) closed on $2.05 billion of newly issued 7.5% senior secured notes due 2026 (the ”2026 Secured Notes”) and a new $500 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Facility”) which also matures in 2026. The proceeds from the 2026 Secured Notes and borrowings under the ABL Facility will be used to repay all outstanding amounts under the Partnership’s existing $1.915 billion revolving credit facility and repay its $250 million term credit facility, along with all fees and expenses associated with any of these repayments and the issuance of the 2026 Secured Notes and the ABL Facility. The Partnership currently has approximately $340 million in availability under the ABL Facility, net of all currently outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. In connection with the refinancing, the Partnership agreed to certain restricted payment provisions under the 2026 Notes and the ABL Facility. One of these provisions requires NGL to temporarily suspend the quarterly common unit distribution beginning with respect to the quarter ended December 31, 2020, as well as distributions on all of the Partnership’s preferred units, until the total leverage ratio falls below 4.75x. The cash savings from this suspension should accelerate the deleveraging of the Partnership’s balance sheet and increase NGL’s liquidity, thereby creating more financial flexibility for the Partnership going forward. “This refinancing of our credit facility meaningfully extends our debt maturities and provides a significant improvement in our liquidity,” stated Mike Krimbill, NGL’s CEO. “This structure also gives the Partnership additional flexibility once our leverage has been reduced and eliminates certain financial covenants. Our Board of Directors expects to evaluate a reinstatement of the common and preferred distributions in due course, taking into account a number of important factors, including our debt leverage, our liquidity, the sustainability of our cash flows, upcoming debt maturities, capital expenditures and the overall performance of our businesses.” JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. is an Issuing Lender, Joint Lead Arranger, Joint Bookrunner and the Collateral and Administrative Agent for the ABL Facility. Royal Bank of Canada and Barclays Bank PLC are also Joint Lead Arrangers, Joint Bookrunners and Lenders for the ABL Facility. The Toronto-Dominion Bank, New York Branch, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association are Issuing Lenders under the ABL Facility. Paul Hastings LLP was legal advisor to the Partnership and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP was counsel to the bank group. Intrepid Partners, LLC served as an advisor to the Partnership. The offer and sale of the 2026 Secured Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws an may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state laws.

Anyone buying ?
"understandable that NGL market value can be influenced by many factors that don't directly affect its underlying business such as the pandemic or basic market pessimism. Not to mention share price is the amount at which one seller and one buyer find price agreement. Not necessarily representing all 129M shares. My question on a scale of 1-10, (1 not, and 10 certain), is NGL capable of paying 50% of its debt by 2026 bases on 450M ebita?"
"The problem with common sense is that it’s not “THAT COMMON. Think about it. Ceo Mike bought half of million of COMMON shares in AUGUST. With that kind of money and at his age, he may have situations in his life such as paying for his parents’ care, or funding a messy divorce, which mean he may not have spare cash to invest in NGL. Honestly, if a CEO has a lot of his own money tied up in stock, he may not make reckless decisions which could endanger the business."
Ngl will soar to $3 with any good news
Let's Wrap this up..Everything they sold has gone up in value..Everything they bought has gone down in value..Thats the facts.Enjoy ur drinks and dinner
Oil deliveries for august contracts were done at upper 60s last month. If they fulfill those contracts with today’s oil spot purchases crude logistics is looking to have a good quarter. Now producers are scrambling to get production to market. Water shall be up as well
I think earning will be good. Almost all oil related companies report good earnings.
Hold your shares.....this will be back above $2.40+ by Nov 9 ER
CFO retiring.
"The only green in my portfolio list amongst all the reds. I could think about only one phrase... ""Insider Knowledge"""
"One thing is pretty certain....management is heavily vested in turning NGL around. The typical seasonality is for the first two quarters of the fiscal year to be lower due to the seasonality of many of their products/services. Water sales, water recycling, and water disposal will be growing as the Permian ramps up to meet the needs in the country. Oil price is in a good range of $60 to $70 for profitability in the Permian. $570 - 600 projected full year with the first couple of quarters estimated to be 90-120 mil EBIDTA means the second half of the fiscal year will support the critical level of EBIDTA of $180m per quarter, or meet the 4.75 multiple ....of course this is holding all things equal in the economic realm. Very Positive!"

At closing the Mesquite system will have 35 salt water disposal wells in total, representing over 1 million barrels per day of disposal capacity expected by year-end 2019. The majority of volumes on Mesquite's system are contracted under long-term acreage dedications and minimum volume commitments. Additionally, approximately 95% of the current system volumes are delivered via pipeline. NGL expects the funding for this acquisition to be leverage-neutral and significantly accretive to distributable cash flow per unit in fiscal 2020 and beyond.Pro Forma Northern Delaware Asset Map includes existing assets, assets under construction, pipelines and pipeline rights of way""As we have consistently stated in the past, our water strategy is focused on consolidating, integrating and growing our position in central Reeves County, north to the Texas / New Mexico state line and throughout Lea and Eddy County. Pro forma for the Mesquite assets, NGL's permitted disposal capacity will nearly double to over 2 million barrels per day in the Delaware Basin,"" stated Mike Krimbill, NGL's CEO.

There is strong support at $1.5. It seems the stock is oversold and a lot of investors are stepping to buy despite the risk. High risk high return.
"I think I'm going to cut my buying early given this news with Solaris. In my opinion, the biggest argument for NGL was that they would get the lion's share of all produced water as the Permian grew from a 4.5 million bpd of oil to 8 million bpd over the next 4-5 years. Solaris did not seem to have the ability to challenge that, but they've increased their operation to have a capacity of 900kbpd of recycling and 3 million bpd of produced water capacity. That's on par with NGL's nameplate numbers. They would only go for an IPO if their balance sheet was reasonable and can demonstrate good cash flow. If they intend to raise additional expansion capital through the IPO they can invest in CAPEX while NGL is stuck using all cash flows to repair the balance sheet. They can both take business from NGL and pressure the produced water disposal margins. The $0.56 is already going to fall naturally as skim oil percentages drop. If Solaris is strong enough to undercut water disposal prices that could go pretty significantly lower.The current dedications limit how much solaris can cut into NGL's business and they are already starting to produce and ramp up water volumes. This short term trend should not be effected too much even if Solaris steals a future dedication. NGL growing to a $600-$750 EBITDA range is still likely and that is enough to get to a refinance and a distribution reinstatement for the common. Solaris growing would really only take out the possibility of a $3-$4 distribution down the road.I do feel a little paranoid about the timing with Trey leaving. I think there were enough screw ups in the last few years where it makes sense to make a change. At the same time, why did they just award him 150k units and then kick him out? Did he screw something up on the financing side that hurt the ability to get a dedication? And is Solaris trying to capitalize on it by raising money through an IPO? All very speculative. Nothing to do but wait and see how the quarter results come up, and in November-January we'll see the producers hard numbers for production."
One thing that might be telling is insider buying through next ER
"I think the market & the UBS analyst are only focusing on one negative (XOG contract) and ignoring positives. A while back Seeking Alpha had an article pronouncing that NGL will go bankrupt after losing XOG contract. The stock went down to $3.5 and found support. Now after negative XOG contract ruling the stock has come back close to $3.5 However, since then NGL has announced two huge water contracts with SUPERMAJORS in Permian basin. Experts are forecasting peak oil production in the US but if read carefully the peak in Permian oil production is still ahead of us. Please allow me to illustrate this point-1. Conoco Acquires Concho – “Once the Concho takeover is completed, Conoco says it will restrict drilling capital to projects that will turn a profit even if crude is trading for less than $40/bbl, which could remove some parts of the company's existing portfolio, such as fields in Alaska and western Canada.” There will be pressure on oil from renewables but oil still has life until at least 2040. Under this pressure on oil, Permian production will go up because first, cost of production of unconventional oil will come down and the largest oil companies will divert limited capital away from high cost production (Canada, Alaska etc) to oil friendly & low cost Permian basin.2. Major Oil Companies will do well relative to smaller companies with scarce capital – Permian already has focused interests from supermajors Exxonmobil & Chevron, also OXY/Andarko and now Conoco/Concho. NGL’s water contracts with supermajors will have less of a risk than it had with bankrupt XOG."
"I still feel like their could be an M&A play here - even with the debt, the assets are big and could complement another big oil company with midstream needs and water solutions. The debt will be paid off quicker due to broader company efficiencies…especially redundancies in people…"
it was obvious that selling Sawtooth at such a loss was an act of desperation. worrisome in itself. I was hoping this quarter was going to show progress in terms of profit. still not there and I am willing to wait one more qtr then forced to move on.
Trading down from bonds to preferred. Bonds are entering zone where refinancing / exchange becomes possible. Fixing bottom half of capital structure will soon follow with pfd getting lion’s share of equity upside.
"Pretty big development... Solaris Water Midstream is going for an IPO. This is the most important private competitor to NGL. While NGL has Exxon as its big customer, Solaris has ConocoPhillips. Not sure right now if I view this as good or bad.Something to keep in mind as we still wait for acreage dedication news. Solaris has built up its infrastructure quite a bit, but I'm not sure it's positioned well enough to take anything from NGL."
"Debating on just keep loading more common here. The business has to return next year, we can’t sit back too long and let oil run up to a $100/bbl."
Krimbill not on the conference call. Odd!
Better buy ngl while you can at a bargain. It will soon be $3 a share
"nice, it’s out-perform the market"
Hopefully the new Open Season on GM helps fill the spare capacity!
The pfd rallies as common goes to zero.
Don’t forget that this got ripped on shorts after last earnings. Nearly half of the volume came from short coverings. I presume scared retail investors sold at a loss and shorts reaped the benefit from the emotional selling.
More insider purchases folks...
"Should NGL Energy be over $22 a unit?NGL Energy Severely Undervalued (part 2)Anonymous posted a good news story about WaterBridge buying some water assets in the Delaware basin and Canyon Traveler posted a comment about lack of barriers to entry in the water disposal business. I would like to address both of those.First, WaterBridge (a pureplay water management company) recently bought some water assets in the Delaware basin. Its integrated water infrastructure now provides 1.7 million bpd of produced water handling capacity with over 800 miles of pipelines and 70 handling and disposal facilities.GIC (Singapore's sovereign wealth fund) acquired a minority stake in WaterBridge earlier this year in a deal that valued WaterBridge at $2.8 billion.Now compare that to NGL Energy:NGL Energy CEO Mike Krimbill (Nov. 2019 Conference Call) We have established the largest water system in the U.S. with nearly 3 million barrels a day (about 65% more than Waterbridge's 1.7 million) of disposed capacity and many hundreds of miles of pipelines [380 +170 being built]. [NGL Energy has 58 Disposal Facilities with 112 Wells]NGL's market cap, assuming an $11 unit price, is only $1.4 billion (half the value attributed to WaterBridge). Keep in mind that in addition to its best in class water division, NGL Energy has two other divisions (Crude Logistics and Liquids & Marketing).It is no surprise that NGL Energy insiders are buying up units as NGL Energy is severely undervalued.Second, Canyon Traveler mentions lack of barriers of entry to the water business. A good point as even Spiro Dounis of Credit Suisse asked NGL how they can protect their water business now that everyone knows how valuable it is.NGL Energy CEO Mike Krimbill (Nov. 2019 Conference Call) So in the basin, you had us -- ourselves, Mesquite, Hillstone, OWL and Solaris. That was it, really, the large systems, that we felt the 2 best were Mesquite and Hillstone for their physical assets but also their contract profiles. As you know, OWL went Instar, and Solaris is doing whatever they're doing today. So we just had to purchase these 2 businesses, and leverage will increase somewhat, but it assures our business really of being the franchise in the Delaware.So now what's left? Well, there's really nothing left. So the -- there may be a few producer systems out there that may come up for sale. But otherwise, there's -- all the systems are divvied up and the producers are pretty much divvied up.The bottomline here is that saying NGL Energy is undervalued is the understatement of the year. As you can see that other water companies are valued much, much higher. While private equity is now aware of the money to be made in the water disposal business, most of the contracts with producers are taken. The recent WaterBridge aquisitions do show that some opportunities to purchase existing infrastructure may come up, I am sure Mike Krimbill is looking for the best ones that compliment its business."
Just bought at $1.94..
"Short interest has dropped from 7+% to around 3% in the last month, therefore, this is real buying, not a short squeeze. The stock should move back towards its 50 day moving average ( which is just over $5) in the next few weeks. The distribution announcement will be made in the next 2 weeks. The ex date should be August 6 or 7 and the pay date August 15. The expected distribution is $0.20 per unit, but given the coverage ratio of 2.5-1 I would not be surprised to see an increase, perhaps $0.25 per unit or $1 annually. Don’t forget, management owns a significant amount of units, in fact, Mike Kimbrill (sic?) the CEO and founder owns over 7.5 million units! A significant number of which he has bought in the open market over the last 6 months at an average price of $6. These units and distribution makes up a large part of his income and he will constantly prod the board to raise the distribution. Don’t forget, prior to Covid the distribution was $1.56 annually and was covered 2 to 1. The board lowered the distribution due to Covid uncertainty, not because they couldn’t cover it. Since the market and oil prices have since recovered and NGL has added a new big customer whose fee income is NOT in this year’s numbers, I would not be surprised if a distribution increase is in the cards. Just as background, I’ve owned this stock/unit for 7 years. During this downturn I’ve increased my position to just over 500,000 units/shares @ an average cost of $2.90. I’ve paid as much as $12 for this stock and sold at $25 a few years ago. This is a good company that is the best at what they do. Mike Kimbrill is considered to be the god of water disposal in the industry and NGL is the go to company for disposal of fracking water. There income is 85% fee based long term contracts so very stable. The entire short theory was flawed from inception as they neglected to mention that NGL only owns 37.5% of the pipeline in question so therefore, they are only exposed to 37.5% of any loss (there will be none, by the way)not 100% as stated in the short thesis. I used this last 3 weeks as a buying opportunity after I determined the short seller was wrong. Time will tell, but I’m a buyer whenever the yield is above 20%."
Any thoughts and dreams when the preferreds might start receiving dividends again? What advantage would it be to NGL if they did have the resources to pay the cumulative dividends from the past non-paid quarters?
Last chance to buy under $2 folks...
3M volume today already. Some large institution dumping NGL.
Another officer buys 10k shares
Ngl is dirt cheap now. It is worth the risk to buy. It will be at least $4 if they beat estimate in the coming Q.
Should trade down in opening .Will reinstate my position.Next 24 months is falling in place..
NGL is up 8.79% to 1.70
the best thing you can say about this earnings call: absolutely none of it was unexpected.
"Lots of early day volume - I’d assume there’s quite a bit of shorts covering. Man, they cleaned up the past month!"
"When things are darkest it’s very difficult to step up and buy stock. Especially in a time of maximum uncertainty with NGL debt . But when big Mike has a massive personal investment in the company, (i think 4M already COMMON share) you know with conviction that he is aligned. Haven’t seen not one sell of his and purchases have been in high 20s to mid 1s now. Waiting for trey CFO to buy in, to be  convinced"
What I like about Ngl is it can double with good news. It has done that not long ago.
"Oil apparently is everything wrong with the world, despite the fact that it runs everything in the world. This almost plays out like a silly parent/child melodrama. Not just NGL, but the entire sector drops to the beat of every phantom problem despite how essential it is to commerce while terrible tech companies with lazyware implementation, some worse than from decades ago, seem to thrive. World Perspective: Making zero common sense since March 2020."
How many divis does NGL owe to holders of preferred share? Will they company EVER have the money to pay the $$ owed. I doubt it unless a NGL buyer is forced to cover NGL's debts.
Haddington ventures and Trafigura buy 71% stake in Sawtooth for 70 mil from ngl.News today boy can’t even find it on ngl site.
Buying shares of NGL at this price level is like buying a Da Vinci painting at a garage sale...
"He collected a nice little divvy for about 8 years - doesn’t make up the overall loss though. Geez, what’s his average? $12"
Down 3 days in a row we need a turnaround quickly
$1.47 is dirt cheap for a company with 5 bil dollars in revenue and is in no danger of bankruptcy for at least a few years. I feel good that the CEO is competing with me for the units on the open market.
Krimbill bought 230000 units. That is $350000 at today price. He must believe Ngl will do well.
"Krimbill the CEO bought 100,000 units at $1.74 this week. Definitely this coming Q will be very good. I am buying. Good luck guys."
NGL going up... $5... $10... $20... plus a nice big fat dividend....
"I’d like to be wrong about this - for the sake of the employees, if nothing else. Bit this s company and my experiences with it remind me of several unfortunate notions: ‘We didn’t lose the game, we just ran out of time.’ - Lombardi Being right at the wrong time is still being wrong.Ken Lay etal bought tons of Enron stock when they knew the company was tanking. And it cost them very little for the advertisement. Are you looking at the picture of the toy on the cereal box? . Krinbill is the Ozian ‘man behind the curtain.’ Sound business actions have never guided this company - just defense of sunk costs and raw ego. Short the f out of this - with timing that syncs as closely as possible with their 2nd quarter earnings call. Krimbill’s ego and capital pipelines won’t let him go bankrupt - he’ll be able to sell.If you’re local, you might hang out in the NGL parking lot looking for limos as your barometer."
I think a deal between civitas and GM is very near. Think about it. NGL can buy all the crude at market price from civitas minus the transportation cost of shipping on GM. That’s a win win for all. I think the deal is in the bag there just waiting for everyone to jump on board with there last agreements. I don’t doubt probably trey will be the new cfo for civitas. We’ll see huh
The numbers were not as bad as feared. Water will be worth more then the Debt. By year end that should be a $400mm Ebitda business. That will fetch $3B. What is left is worth more then the pfd once it gets back to normal. The pfd is probably money good. The common is marginal.
I dont think ngl will go bankrupt in the next few years when oil price is going up and there is more and more demand for ngl service.next 3 Q will be good and the price will be more than $3.
Some institution is buying in large.
"OMG, ""Market hundred"" just recommended this stock and it has crashed from a high share price of 46 down to $2; including crashing dividends from 0.63 per quarter to 0.1 ....."
"What are the chances Krimbill and Karlovich not only put the $70mm from the sawtooth sale towards the 25s or 26s, but also put all the cash flow towards those as well? Bonds at 0.85 vs 0.97 for the 23s are getting pretty close to being worth it."
I say buy . Analyst have beaten this stock up highlighting it's challenges. Which i admit are many . At any rate the assests alone at 1.80 is worth any risk when  balancing the reward. If you haven't bought now you better buy VERY soon. The stock has gained very slowly the last 48 weeks. And is ready to take off very very soon i see buying ....latly and very little selling which indicates price will continue to rise.
Last chance to own Ngl below $2 today.
52 week low
"From an analytical, to a critic and now show and tell blog. Human nature "
3 day in a row profit can we make it 4 tommorow!!!!!!!!!!!
Volume is low. The selling has stopped and there is strong support at 1.48. We are looking at the bottom now.
Does anyone understand the Debt to EBIDTA calculation requirement?
Loaded another 5K today.
"Krimbill bought 350,000 last week. That is a show of confidence in Ngl. I think we are at the bottom."
4.27 million units are traded today. I hope the unhappy investors have already left. We will have a new beginning Monday.
"FYI, some interesting conversations on Stocktwits for NGL too"
I wonder if it can pass $2 today?
"when preferreds drop, they very often pause at $7 for awhile."
Water has already been good. The other 2 sectors were not good in the first Q but we know they tend to be good later in the year. That means the next few Q will be good. We will see $4 even this year.
VMR (private analyst) reiterated a strong buy with a one year price target of $5.35. Anticipated growth in the water segment for Poker Lake and utilization of Grand Mesa capacity to lift profits and meet Debt to EBIDTA requirements by Jan 2023.
OIL IS DOWN AND NGL IS UP GOTTA LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Earning is actually not that bad.
"Linda should buy some units.Show us your confidence in NGL,please."
"Putting together the press releases and relevant earnings so far... a lot of signs point to the July-Sept quarter being a significant increase over the quarter to be discussed this week. Exxon will be going from 400kbpd to 440kbpd in the Permian. A small NGL recycling operation starting late May and then a larger one in late July. The oil barrels they held back in Jan-Mar can be sold anytime, and they very well could have held onto them until July-Sep. Grand Mesa Binding Open Season started July-Aug. That's quite a bit of revenue increase so long as no lockdowns come down and no single events like Storm Uri occur.I would still like to see something like 1.5mm+ barrels of produced water just to see some growth, but with sawtooth being sold at a loss we might see another large GAAP eps loss. XOG/BCEI ramping up is hopefully a benefit, but it may not have come back to 100% in the whole quarter. The only other factor I can think of is the colonial pipeline hack. I don't know if that would affect the liquids segment positively, negatively, or not at all.This quarterly report might be good, but I think all signs point to July-Sept being the blowout quarter to start NGL's recovery."
"How did the cashflow statement look, operating cashflow, free cashflow?"
Cheniere Energy CEO just declare a .33 dividend based on that 90% of all their LNG production is booked for the next 20 yrs. Unbelievable!
"In case anyone cares, debt in NGL is falling in price. I sold at 92 or 93, it is now down to 82 and 84, I think. Meanwhile, PBF bonds are slowly moving up."
"One of the greatest investors of all time, Peter Lynch, was noted as saying that ""insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise."" In fact Evidence suggests that insiders tend to act far in advance of expected news. They do this in part to avoid the appearance of illegal insider trading. And a study by academics at Pennsylvania State and Michigan State contends that insider activity precedes specific company news by as long as two years before the eventual disclosure of the news. So we have ways to go"
Ngl is up6.7% on a down day for the market.
CEO buys more stock
My plan to buy at the historical low is getting ruined....
I wonder why Trey Bolshevik hasn’t bought any units.
"New press release up regarding recycling. Yahoo doesn't like links, so just go to NGL's website.Keep in mind this (unfortunately broken) quote from the earnings call when you read it:""So as we said, we’re at 100,000 a day to 150,000 a day right now as a percentage of produced water, I mean, of our total water. That would be about on the 150 side that would be 10% of what we disposed of in the fourth quarter. But that water will have to keep going, that water has to keep going up to maintain 10% or better. But I think that’s certainly the trend that we wouldn’t expect it to decrease.""10% of total produced water. This second project adds up to 350,000kbpd of recycling to the 150,000kbpd current, or 500,000kbpd. That implies FIVE MILLION BARRELS PER DAY OF PRODUCED WATER. Take the low end of the range and we're still getting 3.5 million bpd of produced water. Make any revenue estimate with that and I think we see a very bright future for NGL investors."
TBW their is no reason to hold a stock which is likely to be dead money until distribution restored! It’s really that simple! Don’t overthink it!
Does anyone know when preferred stock dividend is usually declared?
Krimbill seems determined to fix the debt problem.He owns alot of commons like us.I think he is on our side.
NGL/many investors will regret for selling their NGL stocks ?
"The Dj basin is known for its heavier crude. That crude is in high demand now that 79% of production is offline due to IDA. Grand Mesa has capacity of 340 kbd(190 Saddlehorn and 150 Ngl). While Saddlehorn is owned by Magellan, oxy and plains it’s make sense for NGL to keep oddly quiet about the new shipping contracts."
when are they going resign?
pressure from profit taking in morning..
"major shareholders have reported short positions of NGL Energy Partners: Citadel Advisors LLC, Simplex Trading LLC, HAP Trading LLC, Susquehanna International Group LLP, Group One Trading L.P., Wolverine Trading LLC, and Cutler Group LP. Let’s see how long and how much are they willing to wait"
"krimbill our great ceo bought another 200,000 units on august 30,2021.Next Q must be very good."
want to eat investor money..this company better declare for bankruptcy.
"The most important number, produced water volume, was good at 1.667 million bpd and skim oil increased to 2,500 kbpd. Everything else was pretty atrocious. Increased water OPEX holding water back a touch. I'm guessing the first recycling operation was pretty expensive to start up. Liquids is such a frustratingly terrible part of NGL, and crude was just bad. Grand Mesa not pulling its weight right now. They drew down some of the oil inventory, but no gaming of the inventory is going to make up for Grand Mesa being so weak. 77kbpd is just not acceptable."
They are sticking to their guidance of 570-600M EBITDA. They made 91M in Q1. Long way to go!!
"If ngl went bankrupt it would pay each shareholder $10 per share.  (based on the assets minus the liabilities divided by the outstanding shares listed on Ameritrade, I don’t know if that includes preferred or not)"
"Excellent moves so far this morning. Perhaps some short covering of the lower level and as soon as we slow in the rise, new shorts will take new positions.....quite a gamble considering the underlying value of this company!"
Krimbill should fire the PR guy too. He goes totally silent for months. No wonder a lot of people assume NGL is dead.
I hope the new CFO will buy some units
"Any good news will lift Ngl to $3 immediately. Krimbill confirm the good news for the next Q by purchasing 600,000 units in the last few weeks. Remember what he said? Watch what I do. BTW, is it legal?"
"I am an owner of NGL, bought some 2000+ stocks some time ago. Let's be realistic. This company has 2 billions of goodwill on it's balance sheet - what for, is it a Nike company, Reebok... This goodwill is worth 0. Deduct this and you have a company that has negative equity - and yes, this represents all our ownership in this company. Right now I have no hopes of this going anywhere but lower... Yes, I want time to prove me wrong."
"If this sees two more bad quarters, you can read the fire sale on the wall. They will either need to decimate their overpriced assets in a fire sale or strongly consider some drastic financial hokus-pokus on shares/preferreds/debt. Or just Chapter 11. I wonder if I can buy the private jet?"
"Goodness people, there is a new CFO, not a messiah. She will not create more revenue and, without Krimbill’s permission/approval, will not cut expenses. as for pulling off some new, miraculous “refinancing”, right now the interested lenders dictate the terms, not anyone on the NGL side"
"Insiders are also starting to buy the common which is a good sign. Director recently purchased 10,000 units of common."
The pfd are where the action is.
"These are the days when NGL's unit price is expected to suffer for lack of direction. MLPs routinely decline following their most recent distribution. This is due largely to our now facing a ninety day interim period with only strong news capable of driving the valuation higher.It would appear that we have probably faced most of the worst ""decay"" likely to afflict our precious units. I'm seeing $12.85 or so the bottom, at least for now. Just about any positive news will probably cycle us into the $14 range.Something to keep in mind: We are now one third of the way through this down time in the distribution cycle. Our next distribution is now just two months away instead of the three months we faced in early February. It's very important as anxious distribution hunters will be starting back on the trail in four weeks or so. Seasoned investors know the time to pile on is right around the corner for unit pricing isn't likely to drop much furthe, making this the perfect time to load up.The increased proliferation of articles based on NGL's recent performance tells us more eyes are on the company. ""Justin"" at IHUB posted an important article this morning going into the trending we find at the Permian Basin. The best known majors are gradually consuming the smaller drillers. Chevron, Exxon and Shell are mentioned. I'm fine with that for I know that contracts for water critical to fracking are usually drawn on five year programs. This is great for NGL Partners. And it could not be better for us junior partners.This, then, is the time for us to sit back and follow all we can in an effort to better understand our company and its efforts to be the sustaining force it is fast becoming. It calls for calm and patience plus a goodly measure of trust in management.If you respect the last quarter's results, then it is a safe bet that in two months we will again be dancing in the aisles. And those aisles are going to be a lot more crowded, rest assured!"
Volume is 3.26 mil. Wow!!! Some institutional investors are buying.
"Still following $IPI and my previous assessments for its strong performance in the next year still stand. However, in researching its relationship with $NGL, I began to see a bigger opportunity for a spec play and/or value play in the debt restructure and revenue focus on water and water recycling opportunities they are pursuing. Additionally, the background environment in the Oil industry are very supportive of all 3 revenue segments in their focus. The current price of $2.39 is 30% lower than the recent anticipatory spike at the last earnings call. The next earnings call (anticipated on or about 9 August) offers another opportunity in my opinion for such a jump. IN CONTRAST to being a spec play, should the quarter's results meet the required criteria provided in the debt reduction requirements, there is strong support for pricing to bounce higher and continue higher to levels previously supported by industry conditions. The key consideration is to look at the ""rollover"" of investors when this stock had to suspend dividends as a part of the debt restructure. We see huge sales of stock from funds that require dividends.....as the price crashed down, we saw value funds replacing dividend funds with heavy investment. They see this as a play on value - why would they buy at $2.22 average levels and not expect some level of price growth. Additionally, as this stock begins the path back to dividends, you can rest assured that the price will rise significantly as $NGL will be much stronger with debt levels in line with other midstream stocks. Once dividends are restated, the price will be rewarded, and those who purchased the stock at these levels will be rewarded with 25% equivalent dividend rates. Seems to be a good opportunity - I rolled most of my IPI earnings ($9 to $25) into $NGL.....Good luck to us all! Have a great 4th weekend - I hope you and your families stay safe and well!"
"Mike, we are watching like you told us to!!!!"
"Preferred exchange doesn't make sense, and if it does happen it will be with only the preferred D's. Parity between common and preferreds are not favorable. General partner has 48% IDR's at around $2/unit that they don't want to give up. Insiders have a relatively large share of common units they don't want to dilute. Preferred D's have warrants at around $17 for 25 million units that they will get in 2028 or something. Preferred B's and C's contribute $30mm in carrying costs per year and Preferred D's $60mm. You think a company guiding $570mm per year at $460mm cash flow neutral cares about $30mm enough to dilute their own shares by several fold? After they were just awarded and purchased around 1mm units between all of management? Why would they exchange preferred B's and C's when they go to float in the next 2 years and will go from 9% carrying cost down to 7.2%, which is lower than their debt carrying costs? The preferred B's and C's are a nice way to triple your money after a year or two from appreciation and distribution in arears, and that's it guys. No get rich quick scheme. The time for all those balance sheet moves were before the refinance during the XOG bankruptcy.Could the Preferred D's pull something and massively dilute common? Maybe. You can't participate in that because it's private placement.Any EBITDA above the cash flow neutral line of $460 implies value to the common. A company does not pack up shop and declare bankruptcy because their shares/units are trading poorly. They declare bankruptcy when they can't pay their debts. Many options to address 2023's from straight debt payment to second lien on secured to a term loan to push it out 1-2 years. NGL could post a $480 EBITDA this FY and still be in good enough shape so long as the fundamentals behind water remain. The unit price is going to be challenged because people expect a distribution out of an MLP, NGL isn't in any dumb money indices, oil and gas as a whole is out of favor, and people are aware that all cashflow is going to debt and then preferred for the foreseeable future. Little reason for them to wait it out while they can make 10% somewhere else and come back to NGL in a year.If you have the compulsive need to see your value on paper increase then you should be in dumb money index funds. People are brainwashed to think that is the responsible thing to do, so substantially all savings go into those indices regardless of fundamentals. It's just the nature of the market now.If you do decide to hold NGL there's not much to do but wait. It's just going to take time to get the balance sheet back in line. Different people could justify a price all the way from $0.01 to $10.00 at current metrics, so be prepared for a bumpy ride, particularly on the low side. NGL has the unique components of being highly leveraged, vastly underestimated growth in the next 3-5 years, and very undervalued share price. So long as the fundamentals behind growth remain the holders of every class will win."
"New Insider Buying - August 26, 2021 James Collingsworth just bought 25,000 units @$1.49 each."
all pipelines up except NGL and it's dropping like a rock.
"I am at a loss as to why Mr Market is giving deeply repulsive treatment to NGL.1. On 6/1/20 the NGL stock closed at $5.73; It announced after 4Q earnings after the market close. I pulled out the following from the conference call transcript-""Pearce HammondOkay. And then, Mike, my final question is, just based upon your experience in the midstream sector and given the big change that's happened with COVID and then the Saudi-Russian market share war and likely production growth may not be as robust as what people thought a few months ago, how do you think the midstream sector looks in a few years' time? Do you think there is more M&A ahead, consolidation, that sort of thing? Just love to get your thoughts on the road map ahead.Mike KrimbillSure. I think the first part of the question was, in a couple of years, so we're watching the strips – crude price strips here for 2021 and 2022, and I think December 2021 is up to 39. Current month I believes, it is 35.60-ish, but in December of 2022, it's over 40. I think it's 41-ish. So, the basins we're in we believe that $40 is maybe the new price that gets rigs back to work because of the fall in the oil field service costs.So we do think we've probably got a one-year delay in where we thought we were going to be. ""The next day the stock closed at $5.84/sh and rose above $7/sh that week.2. Here today even after a big drop in the oil price in the past three days, the oil price today & the December'21 price are both over $2/sh higher and yet NGL is trading at half the price it was trading 4 months ago. Yes, four months have passed and we are four months closer to a vaccine and four months closer to life eventually becoming normal and oil demand getting closer to normal. So what am I missing? Aren't we getting NGL at 50% discount even after the world has come four months closer to normalcy? 3. Even more painful to note that since the first week of June NGL has dropped 50% while oil price has gone up 6% and SP500 has gone up 7%.Anyway I am holding faith and keeping my shares."
NGL is up 8.57% to 1.52
"Despite some very persuasive analyses of some analysts, the truth is Ngl won’t go down as long as oil price goes up. Krimbill has signaled that strong belief with his recent insider purchase. Some people worry about the cumulative distribution on preferred but that is not a big issue. In the worse scenario, Krimbill can just turn then into commons. Not good for common but it is not cause for bankruptcy. As upstream companies are done with strengthening their balance sheets, they will be back to spending and expanding to take advantage of the high oil price. Ngl will have a lot of work to do. So the question is whether the world economy is recovering , hence the increase in oil consumption, or COVID will kill us all. I believe COVID is no match for Pfizer and Moderna."
"Only symbolic change, she was moved up to the CFO position. Been there for a while. Knows where the skeletons are."
"Regarding Solaris going public:1. It shows that water assets in the Permian Basin are valuable.2. Will show value in NGL when investors compare valuations of Solaris and NGL and wonder why Solaris with less assets is worth 10x more. (keep in mind that NGL has 2 other divisions in addition to 3 million barrels a day in takeaway capacity.)3. Touting the environmental benefit on water recycling is something NGL PR should have been doing since they started, maybe Solaris will do NGL's job for them in that respect.4. One possible negative is that Solaris will have a larger war chest to compete for future contracts until NGL is done with deleveraging.5. I am sure that NGL has more water rights than Solaris.Lets stick with the plan of deleveraging as fast as we can and then re-instate the distribution.Hopefully we all win in the end."
NGL Preferred down a bunch today. Is it worth buying?
"I’ll go this far:Mgmt stock purchases at least indicate that they believe they will hit their indicated Ebitda range of $550 - $600. Because if they are not on track, not only will the stock flirt with the sub-dollar range, the bonds will crash forcing some very tough choices. If they do, in fact, make those numbers the pfd will trade up to par. Also, the stock purchases weigh against my prediction that an exchange is about to happen. We shall see."
If U are serious about owning I would start accumulation 2nw..And be prepared to buy at $1.50 heavy..
"I honestly don’t know what they are going to report, but it will be decisive for me either way."
Any word on how the Grand Mesa open season is going?
"I haven't read the bond covenant, but management might not even be able to sell the overpriced assets at bargain prices, even if they wanted. It's time to rid this company of the CEO and CFO. They are exceptionally bad managers."
"Couple interesting quotes buried in Exxon's Sept 7 press release regarding third party nat gas environmental certification:ExxonMobil has selected Poker Lake for certification because of the wide range of technology solutions already in place, scale advantages, proximity to nearby markets, and growth potential as production in New Mexico increases.Approximately 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day from Poker Lake will be assessed and certified. The certified natural gas could be available to customers by fourth quarter 2021."
I don’t feel comfortable giving any advice on this stock I’m down 58%. Maybe a hurricane in gulf will get a short term bounce and winter is coming ???
I have just bought 100000 units. Wish me luck!!!!
Krimball bought another 200000 shares at 1.52
"NGL Current Situation: I have been lurking lately trying to make sense of the macro environment rather than NGL's specific position in this Covid-era market. I have seen that Extraction Oil & Gas (XOG) has filed for Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. XOG's financial position, being a customer of NGL on NGL's oil pipeline, has affected NGL in a negative way these past few trading sessions. I thought I would shed some facts and my opinion on NGL's current situation.1. Chapter 11 v Chapter 7: In US bankruptcy law, filing for Chapter 7 is when a company gives up, sells all assets and pays off what it can and ceases to exist (basically). XOG has filed for Chapter 11, which is completely different. Chapter 11 is saying ""We plan to continue operations, we just need to restructure our debt as it is too much with present conditions."" So, in these cases, the company negotiates with its creditors (bond holders), debt payments are reduced to an acceptable level where the company can operate comfortably. The part that matters to NGL unit holders is that the service contracts are usually kept with, sometimes, a few altered conditions. If you look at NGL's and other midstream companies' history you will see that this has happened before. I believe in NGL's case it was with Crestwood (someone correct me on that name if I am not remembering right). Anyways, with that customer(s) of NGL that filed for Chapter 11, NGL accepted a lower minimum volume commitment and in turn received an extra two years on the contract. So it was a win/win. This will most likely happen with respect to XOG. There was a negative article on Seeking Alpha that warned of possible nullification of the contract. This does not happen (or very rarely happens). Companies succeed by building relationships and working with each other in times of distress. But here are XOG's own words for you to judge for yourselves.What does this [Chapter 11] mean for [our] midstream counterparties? • Extraction has sufficient liquidity to operate its business in the ordinary course, allowing us to maintain productive commercial relationships with the Company’s partners and counterparties. • This announcement is not expected to impact operations and normal commercial relationships are expected to continue with minimal disruption.Extraction’s operations are unchanged. The same people, relationships, operations, focus and same culture of safety are in place today. 4. How will the filing affect day-to-day operations at Extraction? • Extraction is committed to operating safely and efficiently while it maintains productive relationships with our business partners and midstream counterparties.There is a hearing for XOGs Chapter 11 on July 7th in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court. As XOG re-emerges from the restructuring, details on its effect on NGL Energy will be revealed. I am sure the business relationship will be preserved.Good luck."
Krimball buys another 100K shares
Whats up with nat gas. Hitting 5. Wonder how propane and butane look heading into winter
Any news about Grand Mesa Pipeline starting ?
"Let’s see. Almost 1M worth of common purchase by ceo and BOD. Why common, not preferred or bonds? Oh yea common are dirt cheap, voting rights as to who gets what, when and for sure no dilution down the road. This quarter is looking to be a good one for water and crude logistics"
"Industries beaten down by Covid and ceos that have put their money where there mouth is. David Simon ceo of Simon Property On March 17, Simon bought 150,000 shares of SPG stock at a weighted average share price of $60.83, for a total outlay of $9.1 million. Now 128.00 shareYou couldn’t catch me within 10 yards of a fitness facility at this point.

Patience is a virtue"
Anyone buying at $1.50?I will..
In early may institutions purchased roughly 15MM shares. That's 10% of the float.
"nice, SQ will take it to $3 today, we need patience and $5 by year end .............."
"To hit guidance 570- 600m they must perform on all cylinders going forward. Looks tough but water is there.Water 320m/ 80m per quarterCrude 150m/ 50m next 3 quarters Refine 100m/ 35 next 3 quarter. They actually did good on crude because they bought at $61/b and sold at $66 plus shipping rates. It’s the low volume on GM that’s making the stinking derivatives expensive. We have to much capacity in water and crude that NEEDS TO BE FILLED. The refine best quarters are still to come Q3,4. Can water surprise with 400m? Don’t know and probably not. patience is a virtue and everything has its price. Certainly no get rich here"
"Almost earning time. If it is bad, unit price go to $1. If it is good, we will see $4 just like last time. I think it is better to buy or hold."
"Big mike wasn’t dumb in buying more common on Thursday. Common sense prevails! If fiscal 2021 EBITDA came in at $448mm, with lockdowns, crude in negative prices, bankruptcy extraction, and uri storm, and obvious that Q1 is picking up exactly where Q4 left off. Then fiscal 2022 has to outperform with more capital inventory. Expect management buy ins are close to follow"
Can conceivably hit 1 at some point.
"There is a clear need to see some expansion of the underutilized assets at NGL - they have a huge amount of acreage that could accommodate solar, solar agriculture for carbon capture, carbon capture partnerships with new technology, etc. Give it five years and their will be more new cities like Las Vegas popping up in the desert which will support manufacturing - they will need electricity and water.....need to get ahead of the curve and leverage all of those acres."
"Drilling productivity report again very good for Permian and now the DJ basin. I think Occidental is the one adding barrels in the DJ, and unfortunately I don't think any of those will come to us. Still good to fill up the excess capacity around the whole region."
Let’s be honest. Mike is the board and on last cc you could feel the tension with them both. Mike didn’t say a word. Trey is good guy but didn’t perform up to par when it came to problem solving. He answered all the questions but never provided solutions. I believe this strategy will work. We’re at the later part of quarter and management knows how’s it looking. If the q2 is good with new cfo at the helm things should start to turn. Let’s hope!
Propane and butane futures at 2-3x historical levels. Going to require a lot of working capital in the liquids segment so I'm not expecting much debt reduction this quarter. June to December is their buying time and it will unwind by the March quarter. Let's hope it at least translates into better margins in the liquids segment.
NGL Dividend History... https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ngl/dividend-history
Ngl market cap is 193 mil. Its revenue is 5.8 bil. Unit price will double easily with any good news next Q.
"US Energy Information Administration (EIA) - Sept 8, 2021Based on our latest Drilling Productivity Report (DPR), 5,957 drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs) were in the United States in all DPR regions in July 2021, the lowest for any month since November 2017. The decline in DUCs in most major U.S. onshore oil producing regions, especially in the Permian region, reflects more well completions and, at the same time, less new well drilling activity. The completion of more wells is increasing oil production in the Permian region, but the completions are reducing the DUC inventories, which could limit oil production growth in the United States in the coming months."

Just because some big guys dump Ngl does not mean Ngl is worthless.
"Company is literally running out of cash. The move from 1.90 to 1.45 was letting everyone know: Bankruptcy is now in the cards. If it hits .90 then delisting becomes a real possibility. Still interested to see how they will solve preferred shares. 1/25 exchange into common, then 25 to 1 reverse split?"
Who would be selling it at a loss? What could be a better investment in a bear market like now? Help me out folks.
the market kept the price...wow.
The new cfo should show confidence in Ngl by buying a few hundred thousand units. Lead by example.
"After Krimbill recent insider purchase, it is likely the next Q will be good. I believe Ngl will go up very fast when investors see a solid recovery."
ngl survived the worst year last year when oil price crashed due to global lockdown.Now oil price is going up.The world is opening up.DEmand for its water service is up .I think the fear of bankrupcy is unfounded.I expect the price will double in 6 months.
"Completely off topic:As I write here occasionally, I thought it appropriate to identify a different stock I am now heavily focused on FSK. It’s an amalgamation of 6 BDC’s into what is now the second largest one out there. It’s is only now getting re-introduced to public markets. Yield is a safe 10.5%+ and growing. In an industry that usually trades at an 8% yield. Stock is at $23, should be north of $30. It’s manager, KKR, is heavily incentivized to get the stock price up. Check it out."
93 approved drilling application last week in NM. 57 were approved in Eddy County and 36 in Lea County. 54 the week before that. I guess NM likes those royalties after all
Only positive thoughts..Thx.
Interesting high volume and increase today without any new news. Patience will pay
So let me get this straight: stock drops from 3.6 to 2.2 to 1.9.to 1.5 and then pops to 1.7 and everyone was right and happy sunshine? Oh man Stockholm syndrome has gone viral.
"The stock price is trading as if near bankruptcy, while bonds are trading normally. The obvious fact is that NGL handed over complete power to the bond holders in that last move. THere is no reason to hold stock in this when you can get 7% secured. All growth will go to make bond holders more secure. All cash flows the same. Until that dark hole is filled, the stock price deservedly has no reason to trade above whatever high water mark the market sets, 2.20? 2.30?"
"It seems odd to me that grand mesa only generated $20.5mm this quarter where the previous generated $26mm with storm Uri. I wonder if some of this is a delay between when the barrel in transported and when the invoice is paid.I'm going to looking closely at that number next earnings. In the worst pandemic situation and a bankruptcy they were still able to generate $153mm for FY21. Right now they are on track for... $82mm.Water growth can power through this deficit, but if it stays anywhere close to that low the preferreds will take a couple extra quarters to be reinstated. Either way that asset will get filled eventually, but I think we all want results sooner rather than later."
3 days in the row green lets make it 4 tommorow
All the downside. None of the upside.
I believe ngl is way undervalued. They have plenty of cash and debt is not a problem. Neither are preferred shares In all in and buying more just like the insiders
Disappointed that the total produced water volume wasn't released in the earnings announcement and recycling announcement. They've released that in the past when it was optimistic. We're getting to the point where losses in non-Permian basins can't really offset the gains in the Permian anymore. They're concentrated 85% plus there and it's on the path to growth for the foreseeable future.The loss on the sawtooth sale is not a big deal to me and there wasn't anything else negative in the quarter. I think the big thing is to get a baseline on water disposal volumes and Grand Mesa volumes. If this current quarter avoids major problems we can get a much better idea of what kind of growth to expect QoQ going forward.We might start getting hints to the producer's plans for 2022 soon. NGL will pay off so long as E&Ps keep onshore CAPEX in the Permian/Delaware.
Krimbill buying $230K of common stock is probably the best news this year. Let’s see how others inside buy this up. This instills massive confidence that they are optimistic on their future!
"So, NGL has 38% institutional ownership, whereas AHT has only 8%. I guess we're supposed to feel little bit more confident about NGL now with this fact?"
"If you believe NGL will go under soon,you should sell and leave.If you believe NGL will survive for at least 2 years and bring back the distribution,you should accumulate at this price.I am accumulating a lot because I believe NGL will survive thanks to the refinancing and the favorable macro environment. Demand for NGL service can only go up as America and the world open up."
Rig Count up +9. 4 added in New Mexico and 3 in Texas. Hopefully that translates into more business for NGL.
Would sure be nice to know if the Grand Mesa open season resulted in anything. PDC energy? OXY? Some private?
More stock purchases.
"Krimbill has bought 650,000 in the last few weeks. This CEO wants to tell us something."
"They are announcing on a Monday, beginning of the week. Expect good news. last time was on a Thursday. I sold before the market closed last time and was right. I am holding this time into earnings in 20 minutes."
I know The new CFO is not that rich but it would be nice if she buys a few units.
It will go above $4.00 in few weeks .... CEO now holds huge numbers of shares...some good announcements coming soo...
"Jim I think there has been a buyer at each lower level. He goes to the level after it opens in the am and then sits and takes it in. The trading hasn’t been up and down, just steady. They are accumulating. Also the comment about Ciolek’s 30,000 units awhile back. TBW is right on. He doesn’t see bad times ahead. There is a lot of capitulation going on and throwing overboard. Think MGT is being quite. I’d like to think things are going to come around."
"Awful lot of negativity here, butAt present the bond market is not pricing in BK"
"If the management is right, as per the ER today, the stock should have bottomed out and go up from here."
NGL will survive alright. Only question is if it's worth our time to hold and wait that long.....
"Krimbill bought another 200,000 shares today"
Margin requirements change if a stock closes below 2..Alot of margin calls hitting accts.Basically forced liquidation..
In a $1.76..Will buy more.if it starts too drop.
"As more people around the world are vaccinated, Delta won’t be a problem. The world will need more oil. The US has just begged OPEC to pump more oil. Ngl will do well in the third and fourth quarters. Krimbill seems to believe that because he maintains the guidance despite a bad first quarter. That means the second Q is the time to accumulate. I expect to see at least $3 by December."
Volume is low. The unhappy investors have left. We go up from here
pity to investor..keep on loosing
Excellent report for 2022..Accumulate in weakness.If they hit those cash flow forecast $5.00
"My average purchase for B preferred is alittle over $13, so, granted it could be alot worse. My question is sell now and take my profit and put it into closed end stock yielding around 9 to 13%, or wait for management to clean up their mess and start the preferred dividends again----which would help the SP as well. Thoughts? I think it could be Mar or Ap next year before much change happens."
Chevron announced they're looking to sell their Eagle Ford assets. Big indicator that they want to high-grade to delaware basin and might be factoring in a purchase of the Shell delaware basin assets.Would be MASSIVE if NGL handles their water.
Will double down at $1.95..
"Not the best news: WaterBridge Announces Strategic Acquisition of Produced Water Assets and Expanded Dedication with Colgate Energy in the Delaware BasinWaterBridge is probably bigger than Solaris Water Midstream, but less of a direct competitor in the Delaware. This was not exactly NGL's wheelhouse, but you have to wonder what NGL is missing out on while we de-lever..."
"I wonder if any other big player would benefit from acquiring NGL … the debt is high, but a big company could leverage efficiencies especially if they have a need for midstream services and fracking water solutions. IDK, just thinking out loud."
