NCR is almost ready for a rebound! Any thoughts?

Nuti has always been about himself. That is probably true of most CEO's in modern America. It was telling in his essay on the anniversary of ATM's he neglected to mention NCR or Dayton. Had NCR not been foolish enough to hire him no one would have sought out Nuti to talk about ATMs.

Just putting a new comment on here so I can stop reading the most recent one that’s been at the top for over a month now.
and now travis 35.25. fantastic for longs.
"Look at the history, this is the top price it can’t go higher. No good reason it should. How does ncr name money? Layoff, reduction in force etc. they been laying off since the 90s and then replacing them with new lower paid people. Then outsourcing. Heck in 2016 they had 31500 employees world wide now there at 36k why? All them jobs or over seas. Layoff one hire 3 or 4 to replace them. Your board of directors can’t hire competent leaders. How did the ceo make an extra 10m last year during the pandemic slow down? There is your dividends they don’t care about the investors or their employees. I’m out"
I'm surprised the stock is up considering the sectors they serve (restaurants and retail)? Unless they make a significant impact in FinTech - they will have some challenges.

"Great news for NCR with the appointment of a President. I hope that doesn't mean that Nuti's health has degenerated to badly but this move is badly needed to have an heir apparent and a new, vibrant leader. Hopefully he is the right guy and not just a syncopant"
"As a small investor, I would like to see NCR begin paying a small dividend with a policy of reinvestment. In today's business climate EVERY company needs to be thinking and moving forward with steady cash flow from without as well as from within."
"Prediction on earnings: BLOWOUT. Betting on over 1 dollar a share.... 81 cents is called for... Stock breaks 33 bucks..... At the last conference call, Nuti sounding like he was dying but you could tell he was pleased with the numbers going forward.... Hold your shares folks... I bought NCR the first time during the 2008 crisis in the 6's.... Made a killing.... I am going to hold until 58 and then say bye bye. I see some laughter out there with the 58 number..... Do the Math... 3 bucks earnings TIMES 20 times earnings..... Simple math..."
"looked at price graph from May = Lower Highs and Lower Lows = -- i want to buy, but not until i see the 14 day going up. And closing a Higher High..."
Earnings Whisper # for NCR is .74 vs .66 consensus.
"43.3 is our pivot point.Our preference: the downside prevails as long as 43.3 is resistance.Alternative scenario: the upside breakout of 43.3 would call for 46.3 and 48.2.Comment: the RSI is below its neutrality area at 50. The MACD is negative and below its signal line. The configuration is negative. Moreover, the stock is trading under both its 20 and 50 day moving average (respectively at 42.6465 and 44.3532).This is a crypto play also...all checkout terminals need to be able to accept crypto. I keep buying these red candles."
This is very positive going onto earnings next week... I say over 1 dollar earnings this quarter which will be a big beat.... Revs are another story though... Not sure..

Good...holding 36 nicely
All top executives have salaries that are greater than 1 million dollars but they can't pay their shareholder a penny dividend. BOD needs a pay cut and to be thrown out of office so they learn to respect their shareholders.
"the agressive aquisition stance, but Cardtronics is an asset in decline; long term reveue obligations to retailers with revenue cash flow falling short based on declining ATM transaction revenue and COVID pause."
yeah baby - the downward spiral is accelerating
"I liked these guys for the low valuation, healthcare market position on the Comm side...thoughts?"
I'm thinking this stock is gonna fly into the 4th quarter.
Grand slam on earnings! Back the truck up!!
I should have listened to Philistan. The only thing NCR's transformation initiative transformed was my bank account. These companies and executives that claim hundred in millions in cost savings but cannot deliver improved earnings really need to be put behind bars.

pushing 35...low 40s here we come. ..
let's see what happens Thursday when reporting earnings...
"A vote of no confidence. Did the BoD not have confidence in Benjamin and he failed up to Nuance, Benjamin not have confidence in NCR, or a little of both. Benjamin was obviously the hand picked heir to Nuti and is supposed to be the CEO of NCR right now in the corner off in midtown Atlanta. That was obviously the plan. I had noticed that the last couple of investor calls Nuti had to get more involved as Benjamin failed to impress. If NCR is really a 50 dollar stock, which with a 32 P/E ration at 32 dollars a share I have a hard time swallowing then NCR was a sweet place to stay. Nuance is a troubled company of its own but its in the Northeast and Benjamin is a New Yorker.NCR is not an attractive company right now and they are going to have a hard time getting an A-List up and coming C-Suite candidate. If I was running the company I would go out and interview guys like Dale Grant who love and know NCR and live in Atlanta. If I was Bill, I would pick up the phone and call Mark Hurd and ask about Dale and other possible candidates. Then hire someone who loves NCR, knows its business to lead the company for the next generation.Instead it will be some flunky that kisses Nuti's #$%$. Strong sell"

NCR has their men. Coming from a banking background can't hurt the ATM business which has been struggling. Don't know anything about them except they aren't young.

Is there a dividend yet?
NCR is up 11.98% to 15.42
NCR cd special proof says do not copy. I found this disc in some of my old NCR stuff I got to keep after I went on disability at NCR (long story how I got hurt) When I try to open it it needs a password . I tried NCR and a few others but no luck. Anybody know the password ? Thanks
Folks.. Go ahead and play back the Morgan Stanley presentation at the very end. The company is unhappy with the valuation and may spin off prices to unlock their value. Hold
NCR is up 4.93% to 46.59
On what news?!?
We are going to break 42 which is the 5 year high soon..... All Aboard..
Will the new CEO put on a good show?!
"Nuti moving on is overdue. NCR adjusted price post Teradata 2007 spin was 25ish, now trading near 31ish. 6 points in 10 years is embarrassing performance for shareholders. In parallel company has less cash and more debt than when he arrived. Just go away...."
this steaming pile of ??? still has done nothing in forever - bring up the charts and change it to max time frame and notice that this dog barely doubled in 20 years with no dividend ever paid - avoid this going forward if ya wanna preserve capital - this will continue going nowhere.Ask me how I really fell :-)
has NCR paid a dividend yet?

I can not believe this is happeing with NCR (http://Experttrade.uno)

Anyone else have NCR steal your fractional shares that were being held by their transfer agent? I've contacted a Class Action Law Firm and they are looking into doing a Class Action lawsuit against NCR
Listened to the analyst call. Paul and Bob did a decent job holding down the fort but didn't impress the analysts. I liked the new CEO's input. He is not the slick salesman Nuti was but sounded very competent and has the right resume. My former colleagues are in good hands for now I think.

"Former employee here. 25+ years in the field, most with this company. I sold my position and feel thankful for doing so. This company has poor customer support as they have outsourced all phone support out of the US to Serbia. Before I left there were hardware orders on the books for over 6 months that the factory could not deliver on. When I ask the salespeople in our office why they were still selling I was informed that corporate management instructed them to keep selling and not to let the customers know. Philistan also mentioned that employees were allowed to work from home and that is true (except technicians) which are needed for the everyday hardware issues and the software issues that the foreign help desk couldn't solve. Couldn't stand working for a company that lies and covers. If your up now, great but long term I would be wary of NCR and what they say."
Fantastic rev. Love this company and this stock. Way underpriced
Better than expected results. When the economy open up fully again this this stock will fly. Many other company would like to buy NCR if it ever put on sale. Very good industry niche.

Another drop after earnings. Have to be careful as the general trend for this stock has been downward. I would certainly not be long this stock. Short term investing only
I can see this company doesn't operate in the interests of all shareholders. The release of Blackstone from their lockup cost me more than 10% in just one day--we haven't even seen the bottom yet. Blackstone and the board should be covering my losses caused by their special treatment!
Anyone think JetPay acquisition will help?
No brainer buy here
Stock price now is better. i told you all to buy at 22. those days aerr gone. if you have some dow get in at these levels. going to hit 55 to 58 within 1 Year.

NCR broke the cardinal rule - they built a new HQ which shows the arrogance of the insiders - you can bank on new HQ's or new jets as a sure fire leading indicator.
NCR reached a 52 Week low at 23.99
Back Below $25 Where It Belongs. You people are seriously whacked out of your brain if any of you think NCR is an honest company. NCR cooks their books with fake numbers and fraudulent reports.

Well Nuti staying on until a successor is named will help with stability but I see this stock as a strong sell. Benjamin was obviously brought on to succeed Nuti and chose to go somewhere else. NCR needs a strong technologist and business person who is comfortable in the south as well as on the Street.
32.25...... Even nicer..

"I thought 30.45 was a fair price per share for this stock. Looks like some people are getting a real buy at 30.00. I am okay with the buy at $30.45, I passed this stock up last year when it was down, some one wrote a negative article and I didn't buy. It went straight up the next day and never looked back. It may go down more or trade sideways for a short period of time, I am betting it don't. Good luck to the longs."

NCR is up 7.35% to 21.47
Really good article over at SA that has mirrored my concerns at NCR for a while. To me also it looks like the Blackstone deal was about lining Nuti's and Blackstone's pockets while not adding to shareholder value and leaving the company at risk if a liquidity crisis event happens which easily could in an economic downturn which can't be too far away
Bring back Jere Stead!!
"Wells Fargo (WFC) Faces Probe Over Consumer Deposit Accounts ___ Zacks Equity Research ___ 5-7-2021Per Wells Fargo & Company’s WFC regulatory filing, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is currently investigating the company’s practice of freezing consumer deposit accounts. The probe is based on suspicions of fraudulent activity by any third parties or account holders themselves.The regulator is also reviewing some historical disclosures made by Wells Fargo to customers regarding the minimum qualifying debit card usage required for them to receive a waiver of monthly service fees on certain consumer deposit accounts.Further, the United States Department of Justice is investigating certain activities in the company’s foreign exchange business, including whether customers may have received pricing inconsistent with commitments made to them.Troubles at Wells Fargo started post breakout of the bogus account openings scandal in late 2016. Wells Fargo was subjected to investigations of several departments and businesses. As a result, a cap on its asset growth was imposed by the authorities. This will remain in place until the bank is able to give a reasonable assurance of staying out of trouble. The revelation also led to several layoffs and restructuring of operations.The company continues to enhance compliance and operational risk management systems, along with timely remediation practices. Also, Wells Fargo is spending more on technology to ensure better data management and cybersecurity. These activities, along with close supervision of regulatory authorities, might help Wells Fargo move past the scandals and make way for growth.As of Mar 31, 2021, Wells Fargo expected high end of losses it could face regarding the legal actions above what has been accrued for to be $2.6 billion, up from $2.4 billion at the end of 2020."

Here is a ? I worked for them for 10 years and go hurt on the job. I get 400.00 a week and now they want me to take a settlement of 250k my lawyer wants 12 % but they only have done 11 hours work Think if I pay off my house for 42k and my car for 7k I can live off the rest . Maybe even buy some ncr stock Oh I also get 2100 for SSDI every month I was making over 74 k working for ncr .so My family had to cut back as with my problems I can ever work again.

"Doing my daily research for new stocks to add in my portfolio and found this: a company which provides solutions for restaurants, retail, travel, stadiums and venues. These sectors are hemorrhaging cash, don't for a second think that there is sizable demand for nonessential extras products/services. Unless you want to wait minimum a couple of years for it to trend upwards (that's if a company with tangible book value of -2,377,000 USD can even remain solvent that long). I would say avoid, many better opportunities out there."

Well ! there's a great POSSABLITY. NCR. may. go up! then again a great POSSABLITY it may go. down ! or stay in a short range !! imo. that's according to my charts! you can take that to the bank!

"37 to close out the week is excellent. Been a long time but i an thinking we go to 42 to 45 during next week (as long as they are good). The last time we saw 40s was when Bill Nuti was leaving and the stock went to 49 for about 2 days then dropped like a rock. That looked very fishy. Today, company doing much much better under Mike Hayford. Excellent CEO."

"Any stocks similar to NCR? I was hoping this would slow down about $45 to buy more. It's now 8% of my holdings, but I still plan to add more in the coming months. NCR is now the world-wide leader in software for POS applications.. and I think they can dominate that market."
Fact: DN ~20% since deal announced - Any views on why ?
if NCR can not command a forward pe of 10 then it needs to be sold or bought.
