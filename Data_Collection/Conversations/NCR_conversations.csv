is there a dividend yet?
NCR is down 4.92% to 39.46
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"Questions were all softballs, no challenging follow up questions. No discussion on the debt issue or rising rates."
Earnings today …and crickets around here.
"Former employee here. 25+ years in the field, most with this company. I sold my position and feel thankful for doing so. This company has poor customer support as they have outsourced all phone support out of the US to Serbia. Before I left there were hardware orders on the books for over 6 months that the factory could not deliver on. When I ask the salespeople in our office why they were still selling I was informed that corporate management instructed them to keep selling and not to let the customers know. Philistan also mentioned that employees were allowed to work from home and that is true (except technicians) which are needed for the everyday hardware issues and the software issues that the foreign help desk couldn't solve. Couldn't stand working for a company that lies and covers. If your up now, great but long term I would be wary of NCR and what they say."
woohoo - it's now been 15 years (2006) without any gain in sharp price and no dividend and NO HOPEhave a nice daylets go brandon
"14 years and nothing - no dividend, no capital gains - pooooof"
"Do not sell. Here is why: if you listened to the conference call Mike mentioned investor day two times. This is where they will talk about their forward strategy. I will bet the farm they will be talking about the break up of the company into 3 parts to maximize shareholder value He wants 20 times earnings but the street is not willing to give it to him. so. he does an end run around the street and does this break up which will surely drive the ""sum of the parts"" much higher than 40. By the way, who is in charge of the ""sum of the parts""?? Correct..Mike Hayford CEO. After today's drop in the stock price its almost a sure thing."
Just putting a new comment on here so I can stop reading the most recent one that’s been at the top for over a month now.
"43.3 is our pivot point.Our preference: the downside prevails as long as 43.3 is resistance.Alternative scenario: the upside breakout of 43.3 would call for 46.3 and 48.2.Comment: the RSI is below its neutrality area at 50. The MACD is negative and below its signal line. The configuration is negative. Moreover, the stock is trading under both its 20 and 50 day moving average (respectively at 42.6465 and 44.3532).This is a crypto play also...all checkout terminals need to be able to accept crypto. I keep buying these red candles."
I should have listened to Philistan. The only thing NCR's transformation initiative transformed was my bank account. These companies and executives that claim hundred in millions in cost savings but cannot deliver improved earnings really need to be put behind bars.
Well ! there's a great POSSABLITY. NCR. may. go up! then again a great POSSABLITY it may go. down ! or stay in a short range !! imo. that's according to my charts! you can take that to the bank!
Why is this stock soo under the radar? I’ve been watching it forever then got punished for buying right before the EC.
De-fund the FBI
"looked at price graph from May = Lower Highs and Lower Lows = -- i want to buy, but not until i see the 14 day going up. And closing a Higher High..."
Good earnings. I love talking to myself.
"As a small investor, I would like to see NCR begin paying a small dividend with a policy of reinvestment. In today's business climate EVERY company needs to be thinking and moving forward with steady cash flow from without as well as from within."
"the agressive aquisition stance, but Cardtronics is an asset in decline; long term reveue obligations to retailers with revenue cash flow falling short based on declining ATM transaction revenue and COVID pause."
I'm surprised the stock is up considering the sectors they serve (restaurants and retail)? Unless they make a significant impact in FinTech - they will have some challenges.
