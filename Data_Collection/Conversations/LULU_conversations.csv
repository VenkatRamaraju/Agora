Lululemon Athletica reached an all time high at 448.49
"Where do some of you shorts think most people are shopping ? H & m, Forever 21 ? Gap ? No, it’s Lululemon. The store who just overtook Nike as # 1 in women’s wear. Men’s sales are skyrocketing. Have you shopped there ?If any of you think insiders only have few thousand shares, sadly mistaken. Chump change for them. If Delta smashed earnings what the heck do you think this stock is gonna do ?"
Completely smashed all expectations both in quarter and on the next quarter and full year guidance.
"Winter is coming, who is going to wear Lulu in cold weather? hyped guidance, time to sell while you still have profit!"
"Gonna be selling short LULU in a big way later today, as a Pure Earnings play, to hold Short through earnings release. This one looks excellent to the Short side, as expectations are sky-high for today's AH earnings. This means a beat of consensus estimates is already priced in. LULU should go down even if they beat consensus, and go down a LOT if they miss on either EPS or Revenue, or if Guidance going forward shows any hint of weakness. We could easily see a drop to the -$350 level tomorrow. I see 80% odds this will be Red tomorrow, and that makes a Short Sell play here, too good to pass up. Good Luck folks!"
Lulu is not going to enjoy the increased revenue in future because of 3 reasons 1.) typical lulu customers who used to get the lavish federal money is not going to be there starting this week 2.) all the unemployed/ stay home people has to go back to work for their living so bo time/ money to depend on lulu3.) general markets are at a tipping point due to tapering about to start
I’m waking up to 100 in the MONEY calls tomorrow morning
$500 a comin'
You guys should really check ATZ (Aritzia) as well. The next lululemon. Thank me later. Cheers
"Beyond my bullish expectations. Kept on running away from me in the post-market ~ but I managed to add another two long lots at $418.60 ~ so sweet. LULU is trading at its all-time high in the post-market omn magnificent volume. Looking at the weeklies, one could make an argument for a target for the $430-$450 range by the end of the year if the retail sector stays frosty. Way to go, ;ongs, especially you who kept the faith during the recent drawdown."
"Visited local store this weekend. Feel pretty good. Store was busy. From wealthy older couples to college kids. Employee said they don't have as much merch as they'd like but not too bad. Most importantly, he said the men's clothing are selling really well. Big growth opp there"
"Lululemon stock rallies more than 10% on big earnings beat, big outlook hikeLululemon hikes full-year sales outlook by about $350 million as second-quarter sales top estimates by $120 million https://www.marketwatch.com/story/lululemon-stock-rallies-more-than-10-on-big-earnings-beat-big-outlook-hike-11631132791?siteid=yhoof2"
"Been watching stocks like this. Found a service that tells me buys and sells. No, it's not free but It has been working for me and their free training resources are great. https://stockhaul.today/zkakja"
"Short 432 AH, covering 422 tomorrow and scaling in long. Will have a strong day tomorrow"
I get there's money to be made on both sides but shorting a company with numbers like this doesn't seem like the best target. There's certainly some poorly run companies in trouble right now.
"Pair of jeans: $20Pair of lulu pants: $120But gee, I'm ""cool"" if I wear the lulu pants!"
"Very nice ""Cup"" pattern...we're in the Handle now...could take off from here :)"
"For a retailer, this stock is way overvalued but people love to buy high sell lower. That's human nature."
Shorts played this one slightly wrong. Lol.
"Sold Short a lot of shares of LULU at exactly $380.00 just a few minutes ago. I just KNEW she was gonna pop up just before market close. Irrational Exuberance finally kicked in... Happy to be Short and expecting a fast market reaction here, as earnings release is set for 4:05 ET. Looking for a serious drop to the $350 level on weak and disappointing numbers, and/or weak forward Guidance. Good Luck folks!"
the mirror will not work out for lulu and will hurt there earnings
Where’s the guy who said his wife works in New York in the fashion district and LuLu is out of style now ? 
Nike in early talk to buy LULU For $ 550 per share all stock deal. Unknown Source.
Nike shares fall as supply chain havoc leads retailer to slash revenue forecast will be a industry problem
LULU: 52B Cap with 6B revenue GPS: 10B Cap with 16B RevenueAEO: 4.5B Cap with 4.5B Revenue
one of the most compelling in the growth sector.....outperform...pt 520.....says oppenheimer
Just came here to say congrats to all the longs! That may be the biggest earnings gain I’ve seen. Of course I sold months ago for financial reasons but guess I’m still a lulu believer at heart.
I have been here since $120 a rocket
"Jenny, where's your proof of CEO investigation? We're all waiting for it."
"Isn't most apparel a fad? Yes, it has grown rapidly, but what if the fad goes elsewhere? I'm not long or short, but considering a short position. I can't think of an apparel company that sustained growth over the long term."
"Here are the numbers:Lululemon Athletica (LULU) reported 2nd Quarter July 2021 earnings of $1.65 per share. The consensus earnings estimate was $1.21 per share on revenue of $1.3 billion. The company said it expects third quarter earnings of $1.33 to $1.38 per share on revenue of $1.40 billion to $1.43 billion. The current consensus earnings estimate is $1.33 per share on revenue of $1.32 billion for the quarter ending October 31, 2021. The company also said it now expects fiscal year earnings of $7.38 to $7.48 per share on revenue of $6.19 billion to $6.26 billion. The company's previous guidance was earnings of $6.73 to $6.86 per share on revenue of $5.825 billion to $5.905 billion and the current consensus earnings estimate is $7.00 per share on revenue of $5.94 billion for the year ending January 31, 2022.Small beats. This should collapse tomorrow on fears for the future and over-valuation. Happy to stay Short until later tomorrow afternoon to see how this plays out."
Lol I bought 1000 shares of this in Nov 2011 at $44…. Never would have dreamed of a 10X return! Lol this is amazing. Can’t imagine what the cap gains are gonna look like. But that’s a good problem I guess!?
Way overbought now
"I for one, having gone long on LULU last May at $244 am happy to see so many cocky retail shorts pontificating on the thread. Our core shares are intact; and we just made a long swing trade into earnings at $385.50 yesterday morning. Options straddle prices predict a 6% move from $387. Let the pre-earning trading games begin in earnest today. Good luck to the long-time LULU longs."
"I bought this about 6 years ago at $40. Parted with it at $80, thought I was a hero and that this wouldn't amount to much more. I hate to look back but today it is trending, so I looked. Congratulations to all, this is fabulous. Can I have my 5000 shares back that I really didn't mean to sell? PLEASE"
"I find LULU and NKE bears to be quite comical. Any time either one has a rare bad quarter, the bears come out to say it’s over. These two are market leaders in their respective categories with huge total addressable markets. Anyone who says the Chinese don’t want to wear sexy yoga wear is sorely mistaken. Last time I checked the only companies the Chinese government was interested in squashing like bugs were their own companies, not foreign ones except for the rare exception. China is an authoritarian country, but it is not like the Taliban who would never allow their women to dress in LULU yoga pants. The argument Jane and Shaggy make about China being a dead end couldn’t be further from the truth. This last quarter should’ve sent the bears heading for the hills. The stock price is a lagging, not a leading indicator for how well the business is doing. LULU is firing on all cylinders, is still growing earnings rapidly, and still vastly underserves the world with its products. The long pause in the stock price may have seemed like the top but here we are having taking out the old highs."
This stock is due for a 20-30 percent haircut...and it’s coming sooner than you think
This stock is way overbought..it needs a good haircut before considering opening a position in it..other stocks look more attractive in long run..
