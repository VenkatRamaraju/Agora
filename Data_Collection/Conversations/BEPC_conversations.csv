A 40% move would be nice
This is one of those toilet companies that like to release earnings on a Friday in a feeble attempt to minimize stock price damage.
"It is encouraging to see increased volume, it's more than double normal volume!"
"A lot of renewables such as csiq, fslr, plug were all going up lately, why is bep and bepc have been constantly droping?Any insights?"

Finally.
Dividend soon. Any guesses what the share price might hit?
Nice move so far today!
"Predictions on Q3 reports on Nov.6, for Sp and Dividend rate?"
"Eversince public offering in Feb 21, this stock has been in down trend from high 60th. Cdn. when is this trend will reverse? Any resonable input is welcome."
"Over around 1 yr, i noticed spread between Bep and Bepc was more than $4.00 Cnd. but lately this spread reduced around $2.00 Cnd.Does anyone have a logical explanation?"
In at $49.25
"Hello fellow BEPC holders. Just joined the club today. I did a little research and a couple of analysts I trust are recommending this stock, so I decided to buy. Im' in it for the long haul."
The manufactured energy crisis should turn this around.
Lack of trading discipline is the primary reason for intraday trading losses it is estimated that nearly 80-85% of intraday traders end up losing money in the stock market Experiencing loss is also part of the game but that don't mean you should give up.
Needs to close above 55$ for this to be considered back in an uptrend in my opinion. Either way I’m long this stock
"Can one reinvest the dividend on bEPC? I own a bit of BEP, but the dividend can’t be automatically reinvested. Thanks"
BEPC.TO is up 4.95% to 52.36
"If I were to pick one single disconnect, I would choose to point out two items from the investor day presentation. Mark Carney coming onstage and telling us the world needs over $3 trillion in annual investment to meet the stated climate goals, and yet we see a big player in the space, Brookfield Renewable, adding new capital in the single digit billions (I think they said $6 billion). If the premise of trillions is true, then to have a chance of getting anywhere, seems companies like Brookfield could safely rev up and look at deploying $60 billion. The added strain on the balance sheet could still be done safely if the underlying premise is true."
Just bought in today at 39. Buy when there's blood in the water
