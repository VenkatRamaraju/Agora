"I think we are going to see notice soon that Albert Chao and other officers have been buying units......similar to the November article published by Zacks. The last several days WLKP has been up big on 4+X normal volume. At 8% current yield and assuming the historical growth rate continues, WLKP is a very good deal. I wanted to buy but already own 3,000 shares purchased during the 2015/2016 swoon."

Stumbled across this company yesterday while reading Barron’s. The chart looks decent and the dividend has been raised consistently for 7 years. I am impressed and likely will be investing tomorrow along with DOW.
"Looks like WLK & WLKP are working pretty good together, read where they have formed Opco together which has supported a distribution increase, maybe we will see another increase in the next quarter plus more upside in in unit price, I`m long here to see what the future holds."
WLKP is up 5.43% to 24.25
"This stock has never traded higher then it's IPO price 5 years ago. it has done nothing except retreat since it has begun trading. The stock retreats as much as the dividend. You will not make money here. Think about it, not 1 single day since it's inception has this stock traded higher then its IPO price and you are down over 30%."

"Here is what Zack's said on May 21st, 2021 ""We have narrowed down our search to five such stocks. All these stocks provided higher returns than the S&P 500 in the past month. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A or B. Westlake Chemical Is one of their top 5 #1 picks. And on May 26th they said ""Here are five stocks added to the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) List today: Westlake Chemical was listed as one of them. The company had no press releases, no financial disclosures, nothing between these two dates. In 5 days it went from #1 to #5 with no additional information released."

"Today, if you took 2 positions in this stock, let's say long 1K shares and Short Sell 1K shares. In one month you will be able to sell each position with a $1000 profit every month."
This is definitely a bad risk for the dividend. My guess is this stock loses value quicker than the accumulated dividend.
Now the IRS says they are an MLP. It took about a year and 10 points off the stock. Is this a Obama's last pardon or Trumps first call.?
Ranked as a strong sell by Zacks this week - any thoughts??
i'm in here. 7% dividend while the CEO and CFO own an LLC that holds $8 million in common shares. I think the dividend should only increase. I like companies that have this structure rather than corporate buybacks. We can all own more shares rather through reinvestment buyback then scammy corporate stock buybacks these days. Price target of $94...interesting.
"I will likely be committing funds to this name next week. I don’t mind the tax implications I just want a piece of that juicy, well supported dividend. Capital gains would be a plus too but honestly the income stream is the main draw for me here."
does this stock issue k-1's for taxes?
