"oil is the #1 performing sector in the stock market this year and its going higher. There's not enough supply and demand is increasing - simple as that. Im invested in #FANG (+23%), #PXD ( +18%), AND #COP (+15%) in the past TWO WEEKS. These are three of the best oil plays and they're going to go a lot higher bc oil company's are not drilling for more oil; keeping the supply down. They are taking the massive profits and buying back billions of dollars of stock; further causing their share prices to skyrocket. By the way - inflation is good for oil stocks. Cheers!"
200+ next week
GS is advising all their elite clients to move towards overweight on ENERGYespecially NG/CRUDE exploration co's.NOTED:$CDEV $OXY $CPE $BSM $XOM $CVX $EOG $PAA $LPI $CLR $PXD $COP $USOEnjoy the ride - they're pointing to a $90+/bbl b4 yrs end & $8+/NG
"PXD price target is $245 +27%. FANG was $135 in 2018. It will match that high equaling another 22% upside. Enerygy / OIL is rolling thru March 2022. Energy is the #1 sector and is extremely undervalued compared to other stocks. Oil stocks trade 15% below the WTI value, meaning more upside is imminent. FANG n PXD are going to crush EARNINGS on 11/2 and catapult stock prices higher. Opec doesnt announce anything until 11/4. Oil is not optional - its what the world is CURRENTLY run on . Tech will suffer the most under inflation and oil the least. Investors will go to where the money is n that is oil. It doesnt happen often, but the years it does, extreme stock prices occur. When oil prices go higher - it's sales will not suffer until you get near $100 a barrel. Oil has a lot more to run. You stay short and miss the money."
"I think some have figured out that PXD is going to start printing money for the investors. When everybody figures out the truth, the long awaited value of this company is way higher."
I hope this winter  is brutal & cold as hell in the Northern Hemisphere. Oil & Gas stocks will skyrocket. Follow that with the pandemic going away in 2022 & pent up energy will have people traveling like crazy regardless of the cost to get away. $CPE $LPI $FANG $XOM $PXD
"With record earnings and hedged issues, earnings call with regards to FCF will be most interesting. The BOD began the variable dividend ahead of the 1st QTR 22 original target start. Will they look at another Variable div payout, buyback or debt payout by end of year?So many variables affect the commodity market, US Government, OPEC+, China, Storage, Covid, Inflation, Greenies, not in any particular order, truly a gambling crapshoot!"
Just reported...PXD lost $501 million dollars of hedging losses in 3rd qtr 2021.
"congrats to the longs, its been a good day!. Was there any midstream infrastructure involved in the sale of assets to LPI? Since the deal was announced LPI is up 15% this week."
"High oil prices are a direct cause of inflation. Inflation is very bad for the economy. The economy is slowing, as evidenced by the huge miss in the non-farm payrolls report Friday. A slowing economy will decrease the demand for oil, and inflation will cause the Biden administration to take action, as well as the Federal reserve. What this means is oil prices will fall dramatically in the near term, and the prices of parabolic, overextended oil names like PXD, MTDR, FANG and others will also fall. It may not be tomorrow, it may not be next week. But this will happen, as oil prices this high are not sustainable."
heather...a reasonable price yes...but who is fibonacci...a pasta dish??
"PXD has been parabolic, and extremely overbought with an RSI of 76. The stock is up from $147-$185 in about 2 weeks. That RSI metric is unsustainable. The energy companies usually track the price of oil, however the current administration will be doing whatever they can to control and bring down the price of oil. A normal Fibonacci retrace will drawdown the stock price to about $168-$170. At that point, PXD may be a buy. I'm not short, I'm just looking for energy names to buy at a reasonable price that are not overextended like PXD."
"on 10/4, PXD entered a Wave 3 Extension. New price target is $245.67. At $182, this represents a 35% upside, one of the best for all oil companies. I own Fang, DVN, n PXD. Buying a lot more PXD in the morning."

"I like the pioneer CEO, has he mentioned any sort of time frame for divesting Laredo Petroleum shares? My wild guess will be it will get done prior to the earnings call. Any thoughts?"
