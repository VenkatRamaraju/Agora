"Earnings tomorrow. Obviously not blockbuster, but this is an excellent leadership team and will likely have modest surprise. Best in US Oil! No expert, but confident the stock moves into low mid 100s."
This is Buyout Preparation By CEO. There is saying Put the Lipstick on The Pig. He is Cutting Expense and Making a Pure Permian Play for Oil Major to to buy them Out to Monetize the Basin. U.S is best energy and as matter of Fact Consumer Market in World. There energy demand is tepid but will grow a Lot with Population growth after this Low cycle they are inn. PXD Oil is Brent Crude and Best oil in U.S money can Buy. If we Go With recent buyout of similar acreage at 55k its a 34 billion company right at this moment which is low balling it giving its strong balance sheet compare to other. For me I believe at $23 Break even point and Long term Brent of $60 its oil reserve worth $25 and In that scenario it should produce 250 billion for its shareholder in 100 years life time if it has 10 billion in Oil that it can produce. I Think $250 is Fair price for this company to be bought by Exxon or one of major for its quality acreage and oil inventory near to 10 billion barrel. I hope prices fall more and I can invest 5k in it but for me Buyout is screaming over this pig looking Pretty as hell. Balance sheet looks like marriage proposal. Cutting Cost and over heads and most sticky of things firing people which may make it cherry on cake for company buying it as they do not have to do the dirty stuff. I am Exxon I say yes to this bride. anyway I am going to buy 5k stock if I can at right price for mine financial goal it has to fall a little.
Rumors continue to swirl about OXY being acquired by F making them FOXY!
"Can someone explain what PE shareholders are getting in this merger deal? Based on my calculations, at end of day Oct. 21st .1252 x Pioneer Natural Resources stock price is $9.82. Am I missing something? Does not appear there is any premium for PE shareholders."
trumps days are over unfortunately .So hang in there oil companies will probably move down but oil is going to move up a barrel spring of 2021 50.00 conservatively and the weak players will be gone
Again when compared to the rest of the Shale plays....Pioneer has some SUPERNATURAL Resources!!! Nearly 13% move!!
This is great news for PXD in after hours today:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pioneer-natural-resources-announces-increased-200500048.htmlPXD has one of the strongest balance sheets in the entire energy patch.
Oil heading to 50...PXD...135?
CVX needs inventory PXD can more than fill the gap
THIS THING IS ABOUT TO ERUPT!!!!
"I think some have figured out that PXD is going to start printing money for the investors. When everybody figures out the truth, the long awaited value of this company is way higher."
$200 by Oct.
price held up very well today. oil stocks are strong buys into weakness for the next few months imo
The difference between the 52-week high/low is roughly $110.00. That’s puts a mid—range price at $104.00. WTI is at $40.00. At $90.00 or so I’m a buyer!
Pioneer's above average margins and decent profitability make it very attractive with this oil glut in my opinion
Nice numbers in a rocky environment. Oil is not going away and the Parsley acquisition will be accretive!
"Highly Probable case of $4B Gross Profits for next year. At 10x, share price can easily move to 240+, IF crude is supportive in the next 6 months."
offering early retirement. plus selling off non perm. assets. Sounds like a CVX buyout any day.
Looks like this is a better one among all the bad.
"Potential reasons for PXD overpaying for acquisitions:A. Financial slight of hand to show better short-term free cash flow at the expense of long-term value.B. Large industry-leading acreage position isn't as large/industry-leading as they claimQuestions PXD should answer:1. Why has PXD had negative oil reserve revisions each year for the past 3 years?2. Yr end 2018, PXD had 565 million barrels of proved oil reserves. After 2 additional years of drilling and 2 major acquisitions, what are PXD's proved oil reserves? If you look at Parsley and DP, what are the $/bbl proved reserve acquisition costs.3. Why do you continue to add inventory when you have 10+ years of profitable inventory, similar to or better than the inventory you are acquiring?"
"The question is does the shale model work at all? Exxon is saying that it will only work if they scale to a level that has never been achieved yet by other companies. You just cant overcome the decline rates with cash flow. At 60% annual decline, a $3b budget would need to double in just 2-3 years to keep production flat. So zero growth while spending 100% more capex every 24 months. Spreadsheet that and see what your result is. You will not invest in shale."
So remind me again as to the Focus of this company? They explore for Oil & Gas which are at 5 year HIGHS.....and the stock doesn't move?? What is the market run by... ESG Algorithms??? While fund managers are flushing their clients money down a SPAC Hole PXD is making a fortune....with NO Stock Appreciation??
cvx buyout at $180 ?
buy at 55.00
"Scott’s recent moves within the company will increase cash flow that many potential investors don’t understand or appreciate. At Scott’s age, he is interested in current returns, and he is not waiting on the market to give us the valuation we deserve. Expect the dividend to continue increasing over time with Scott realizing the profits of his hard work over the years. I’m entering retirement age, and I will enjoy the ride. On M&A, PXD already runs the most efficient “factory” in the Midland basin, and they have some of the best “rock”. This efficient aspect doesn’t lend itself well to large synergies through M&A. The only reason I could see a major paying Scott’s price is for their water system. Yes, their water system. They have all the gray water from the municipal systems of the two largest cities in the Permian Basin. Watch the earnings explode from here with 60 to 70 dollar Brent oil prices."
"I just read a funny article talking about PXD being a ""Monster"" dividend stock. With a pathetic dividend yield of 1.5%, it's more like the mouse that roared. Try EPD with its solid financial position, dividend history, and current dividend yield of over 8%. Also, looking at the 10 year history, PXD has had a 4.26% average annual return vs. EDP's 6.2% ( both w/DRIP). So why would I choose PXD over EPD? I wouldn't."
"The losses will accelerate with this acquisition. I think this called a Ponzi scheme, when you pay dividends out of borrowed money."
this is getting way oversold
Bought more around $119 today. OPEC to announce cuts this coming week and watch for feds around the world to announce more rate cuts this weekend. Combination of these will bring price back above $140. GLTA
"POLL: Thumbs up Bullish, Thumbs down Bearish (On The Earnings release date) (today is Feb 18-19)"
Holding Long on this stock
"Curious, why buy this when hes, dvn and erf sell for much less and pay higher div?"
Nice dividend. I will hold this
This will never see 160 again
"nice consolation today , ready for the next leg up the 100's +/or- have good Memorial weekend longs remember those who took care of us in histories past... out!GLTA"
I didn't realize until today that the base portion of the dividend ($.56) the and variable portion( $1.51) are paid on different dates. Variable paid 9/17/21 and fixed paid in October 2021.
"I love anything energy the next few months. XOM, CVX, COP, PXD, PE"
"strong moves...oil, gas futures up tomorrow ""?!"
Thoughts on the Doublepoint acquisition?
Time to start nibbling. Strong support between here and $123.50. Company too strong to be at these levels.
"According to latest SHORT figures, the position is < 4%....Yet despite 2 UPGRADES and Raised profit outlook PXD ""TO DATE"" has remained pressured. It seems we are on the cusp of a price Tsunami of sorts in the coming days! Todays 2.33/sh move occurred on HEAVY VOLUME!"
Wonder if PXD would RISE if Oil FELL??? Oil is up 100+% yet PXD hasn't MOVED??
Best company in the Permian
Way below last year's numbers.
Market is up and oil is at a 6 month high so why is the stock down?
"PXD Along with the OIL markets are ridiculously MANIPULATED! Lets face it demand is high and considering the immune compromised in society are immunized, most younger have antibodies....Others...Well GET A CLUE & a VACCINE! As far as OPEC+ (Brain Blood Flow Constricting Turbans) they have increase production 400K Barrels per day or roughly somewhere between 1/5 & 1/6 of what the US swing producers were producing LAST YEAR! Net stores will continue to fall!! Today is ALGO BS!"
They have a 40% tax rate. It could go down to 20% soon. Why isn’t this flying?
"Wes said $125 by years end. PXD is half way there. When I see oil going up I don't mind paying a few cents more for a gallon of gas! I am very happy to be a shareholder, go Pioneer!"
"Analysts estimate price target $121 for PXD. Why in the world , it is currently trading $142. Anyone has an opinion???"
Funny how you don't hear from Art once the stock takes off.
"Sheffield on Bloomberg right now: ""75% of FCF going to shareholders."""
heather...a reasonable price yes...but who is fibonacci...a pasta dish??
America was able to get energy independent - what an accomplishment! Thank you PXD
only a matter of time before the shares trade under $100.then it's a compelling buy.nt
"Though typically seen as negative, this secondary offering is a way to improve balance sheet. Interest rates are low and will result in lower payments on debt. Stock will eventually rally."
Short term and short sighted profit taking. We’ll be up 30% by years end.
Pioneer's CSQO( Chief Status Quo Officer) has taken Painstaking Steps too ensure that regardless of trading 41 Dollars Below tangible Book Value and every other bottom feeding Oil stock up 5-7% today Pioneer(A CRAMSTER PICK) Goes Nowhere!
GOOD NEWS!!! Thanks to War Of The Worlds Bloombuggers....Crumpetwankers and StrudleSolar Panelists....We'll get a chance to BUY WAY CHEAPER NOW! Mutated strains (COVID) are generally weaker....But Climate Zealots like most religious believers pay little attention to facts! PXD to 150 Next year!!
"$83.00 close today. Soon this will have been a bargain price. I agree Wes, an oil giant. A lot of consolidation going on in the industry. Bought another 50 at 80 bucks yesterday. Cost basis now $90.00 on 200 shares"
https://seekingalpha.com/news/3459956-pioneer-natural-minus-6-percent-cutting-long-term-output-growth-forecast
Nice bounce today on almost average volume. I guess the road show they put on today impressed some buyers to step up. Outstanding price movement in a down market and falling oil futures contract.
Gushing cash
A lot of rumors circulating about $OXY being acquired by $PXD. All stock acquisition valued at $32 per share.
Today's perfect example of Algorithm Bias! Oil &commodity prices have risen to generational highs. At these levels companies are assured of large profits YET ALGOS sell off stocks if Copper or Gold drops .10 cents?? Apple doesn't drop if 1 person returns a charger?
PXD a #$%$ Company....The Oil Industries BOND EQUIVALENT!!!
"PXD is the best energy company in the entire space, which is why I went long today."
"Dividend day yesterday, $.55 yea! Jim Cramer said that the Permian is Saudi Arabia,(IN TEXAS) and that Pioneer’s statement about their reserves are real."
People forget they sell Brent to the market way higher then WTI
"on 10/4, PXD entered a Wave 3 Extension. New price target is $245.67. At $182, this represents a 35% upside, one of the best for all oil companies. I own Fang, DVN, n PXD. Buying a lot more PXD in the morning."
"a good tip....whatever heather says, do the opposite. she's pretty far out there."

"(Bloomberg) -- Gasoline demand surged to a a record high as Americans took to the road for the July 4th holiday weekend.Gasoline supplied, a proxy for demand, rose to 10 million barrels a day the week ended July 2, the highest in data going back to 1990, according to the Energy Information Administration.Demand has regained its footing as vaccinations and easing economic restrictions propel more Americans to resume their pre-pandemic lifestyles. Oil prices have risen almost 50% this year as U.S. refineries run close to full-bore to keep up with fuel demand. While the U.S. recovery quickens, the world’s largest oil producers can’t agree on how to supply the market with Saudi Arabia advocating for tempered supply increases given the potential headwinds that still exist.“Demand is bucking with the price spikes and summer driving, but with high gas prices and inflation, the picture in September may look different,” said Trisha Curtis, co-founder of PetroNerds.The moving average for demand also climbed higher, reaching the most since late 2019. But on a seasonal basis the figure was still about 150,000 barrels a day short of July 2019, suggesting the market still has some room to recover.U.S. motorists hit the road in large numbers despite contending with the highest gasoline prices since 2014.

be patient .. all analysts target price averages are way above $200... adding variable Dividend is great = 5-6%. Even Charles Payne bought shares this AM
"This has been a very scary day for someone long PXD...and I am. The fear can make you wonder ""can PXD make it any longer"" or ""Could they be bought and at what price?"""
Picking up PARSLEY!!!
when is there next earnings report?thanks
IT'S ALIVE!!!!! PXD Has a PULSE!
I’m currently up almost 105% since last year. Wondering if I should pull out or stay and add...thoughts on additional upside potential??
Consider the CURRENT STOCKS PRICE with oil at 72+/BRL.....In 2017 PXD traded at 209/sh with only ONLY at 67/BRL....The consider their acquisitions & INC Dividends makes this company Dirt Cheap!
"If they do take it out, it will not be at a premium. Exxon has its own reserve to manufacture. Why would they want to buy someone else in the same disappearing business?"
"PXD has been parabolic, and extremely overbought with an RSI of 76. The stock is up from $147-$185 in about 2 weeks. That RSI metric is unsustainable. The energy companies usually track the price of oil, however the current administration will be doing whatever they can to control and bring down the price of oil. A normal Fibonacci retrace will drawdown the stock price to about $168-$170. At that point, PXD may be a buy. I'm not short, I'm just looking for energy names to buy at a reasonable price that are not overextended like PXD."
"Wouldn’t it be great if your Guardian Angel whispered in your ear, “buy PXD it’s at a 52-week low”? Mine was a bit late at $89."
Garbabe-==oil stock==sell any rally==target $75
This looks like it is primed for a special dividend! How much?
"We just need to get to the mid-term elections. The GOP will put Nancy and Chuck out of business and sleepy Joe can go back to sleep. There is no chance that we Americans are going to give up our liquid gold. When people open up their wallets at the gas pump and heat their homes in winter only then will they wake up and smell the ""coffee""."
Nothing wrong with spending when you get profit from it.
CNBC reports traders say crude oil could go to $100 within 12 months....if that happens .... we fly!
up 13 bucks a share and this board is home to crickets .... I guess it will wake up when it hits 200
Paid too much - period. Stock should come back into the 140ties in which we should all buy!
Apparently FUND MANAGERS are GREEN and LACK....GREY MATTER! Should be at 180 considering oil prices!
"you know when Jim Cramer said it was headed too $110.00 a share or support he called it, and he said near term 129.00 I bought more, because Jim is usually wrong,I have found, plus the CEO wants too improve stock value plus the company owns Permian land."
On to $125. There are only going to be a few survivors. CVX and PXD!
Anyone know what percentage of their acreage is federal land? If Biden wins and bans fracking these guys could take a huge hit and be staring bankruptcy in the face!
So which way did the merger vote go?
This company seems to be carrying a lot of debt. Does anyone expect bankruptcy by 2022 if oil stays in 40s?
"Now that the Saudis have bought the PXD headquarters building in Dallas , they should buy the company."
BUY BUY New Target $200
where is the support level?
let's get this stock moving back up
"Both Exxon and Chevron and possibly Shell are looking to increase their holdings in the Permian Basin. There will be a bidding war for the two or three largest independents as soon as it appears that the pipeline imposed crude oil surplus disappears. My guess is that this will occur by the end of the year. Since acquisitions take 6-9 months to complete, it would not surprise me to see a new deal announced in the next 90 days for one of these companies."
Huge earnings even if it was a miss
ugh bit depressed about all this
AREX buyout?
Its a great time to buy PXD. I see the stock at 140.00 by June.
"Natural Gas is on """"FIRE"""""
"Incredible strong ER, and this is falling."
Oh yeah throw a little parsley in it and it makes it better! More money making too!
thats annoying to see down more after hours.............
Analyist expectations ~~ Stifel expects shares of Pioneer to more than double from their current price to reach a 12-month target at $303......even considering a flat to down market for oil as Pioneer can outperform a flat market....
"PE shareholders are worried son is going to give dad a deal, and I told them we were worried about the opposite. Do you think the Concho valuation should be the guide? PE has about 3B debt."
"Should cross 100 today, oh boy!"
"With the Biden & Pelosi Premium creeping into the oil price this ironically bodes very well for PXD.As elitist liberals destroy our oil industry those strong names will benefit as oil prices potentially sky rocket. yahoo censors most posts, it is illegal if there is no violation of terms of service."
Anyone know why we are falling? Past two days was up then down and now PM we are down…I was expecting this to climb along with all other oil stocks. If anyone knows please advise. Thanks.
"With oil rising through resistance and economies around the world REOPENING this stock,TEMPORARILY, Extraordinarily CHEAP!"
"This is hysterical! The Cramerettes are selling oil company futures because of his ALMOST ALWAYS WRONG ""Off The Reservation"" segment.....PXD will CRUSH EARNINGS.....PERIOD!!"
"“I didn’t come back to sell the company,” said Sheffield, the company founder whose previous stint as CEO ended in 2016. Chief Executive Officer Scott Sheffield remarks during a conference call on Tuesday came just 11 weeks after a boardroom shuffle that saw him replace former protege Tim Dove. Late Monday, the company disclosed plans to sell or find joint-venture partners for some oil fields, and announced the divestiture of its entire South Texas portfolio in a deal that’ll trigger a pre-tax, non-cash loss of $550 million.“I didn’t come back to sell the company,” said Sheffield, the company founder whose previous stint as CEO ended in 2016.Sheffield also dialed back the Texas shale driller’s long-range annual output-growth target to 15 percent from 20 percent, a response to investor demands across the oil industry to restrain capital outlays in favor of fattening dividends and buybacks."
PXD was in the high 150s when oil was above $60 early last year. That doesn't include any contribution from Parsley so I don't think $180 is out of the question. This is still being valued as if there's a fair chance the world will shut down again. Competitor EOG's board is alot more active than this one and the mood there is mild surprise that the share price isn't higher.

"Unfortunately, the days of a $90.00 share price are over. I am at $89.00 and change and very content to hold indefinitely. Dividends beat money markets!"
"All these Shale producers have put out $$$$$$$ billions in shares to finance huge options packages for over paid insidersand finance operations with zero value for share holders who have lost their savings buying mismanaged companies.Very little accountability in the shale industry for a decade now. Investors been scr3wed so long, maybe finally some valuein the company for the $$$$ billions that have paid salaries and operations from investors money. The debt holders and insiders have done very very well."
"(Bloomberg) -- Pioneer Natural Resources Co. is buying DoublePoint Energy LLC in a deal valued at $6.4 billion, less than three months after completing its purchase of fellow shale driller Parsley Energy Inc. as it expands in the U.S. Permian Basin. I think PXD means business!"
"Just a guess based on people, supply and demand, and OPEC's desire for higher prices to meet countries needs, I think oil is going to $80/bbl + by the end of the year and should carry over through much of 2022.The simple fact is we are not yet prepared to go off fossil fuels totally. Just research everything we use it for...the list doesn't end.Going long and holding."
"M&A coming real soon for PXD, it's the jewel of the Permian, price could be $250 per share, as XOM & CVX easily can pay cash for the best company, buying all the shares I can in the next 2 weeks"
Dividend is up..good news
"Can't watch this without buying any longer. Been eyeing this since $79, probably going long tomorrow."
glad I held off adding more. overall market doesn't look good
End of quarter window dressing. PXD is rock solid with outstanding leadership in Sheffield. This will be a $130 stock by years end.
PS My apologies if I've offended anyone! What am I saying....According to Al BILLIONAIRE Gore we've ALREADY had 3 Apocalypses by now! So sorry from ......THEGREATBEYOOOOOND!
PXD beats by .37 on Earns - and beats on Revs.
this doubles as oil prices increase later this year and in early 2021
Do I recall reading here PXD will make $30 per share if oil hits $60/bbl.?
So what do you think now?
told you: oil stocks are laggard without participating market rally!
Losing money on every barrel they pump. Will shutdown soon.
crude down just a dollar...gas down .57...! pxd strong move...!
Did great I think. Who set this high expectations
"USGS estimates 20 billion barrels of oil in Wolfcamp shale formation in TexasThis is the largest continuous oil rating USGS has ever rated in the United States.The United States estimates that the Wolfcamp shales in the Midland Valley in the Perm Basin Province of Texas contain an average of 20 billion barrels of oil, 16 trillion cubic feet of associated gas and 1.6 billion barrels of natural gas.Lilis (LLEX) focuses on delimiting the different productive horizons in the Delaware basin, focusing primarily on Wolfcamp, Bone Springs and Avalon, individually, among the most attractive resources in the United States.Pioneer Natural Resources is the largest space holder in Spraberry-Wolfcamp.If Barclays finds a causal link and expediency between Lilis and Pioneer Natural Resources, it would be very useful in the two-sided opportunity to sell your business, or find cooperation to develop conglomerative influence in the region."
Grossly over paid for double point. Big dilution with additional stock for double point stockholders and assumed billion dollars in debt. The stock should be down $50 on this deal.
"if the economy shoots along as expected, why wouldn't oil become $100?"
Optimism here is pre delusion. There is no path that allows any (predominantly) shale operator in business. No matter how large or currently well financed.Shale is a ponzi scheme from this point on. Russia and SA are not going to relent until shale is crushed and they will continue to point at each other while laughing behind the scenes.
should have bought more when it was down on the count but oh well add on a major pullback
"EXCEEDED PRODUCTION TARGETS! THE ""MOST "" IMPORTANT METRIC!"
PXD is primarily an oil company but natural gas is at a 7 year high. I haven’t looked at how much is already hedged but it should give some positive bias to the stock.
Back to $175 soon
Bad policy
"This is THE BEST ENERGY COMP{ANY IN THE WORLD and nobody follows it amazing world of sheep ... buy at 120 sell above 140,,, options are phenominal"
Why are we down so much on a nice earnings beat?

"Remember, PXD hedges against Brent pricing because they are exporting their oil. While PXD has set a 10 year production goal, Scott Sheffield is interested in making the highest returns from the assets. With low debt, he will slow production growth to maximize returns."
"With oil prices most likely remaining below $50 for quite some time, most shale companies will go bankrupt by 2021/22. I plan on shorting this wounded duck to zero. Shale oil is officially a dead investment."

Scott Sheffield of Pioneer Laggard Resources assured Jim Cramer of reduced Flaring of Gas .....They are now apparently FLARING Investors Profits as the Stock continues to Significantly Lag the market!! Again PXD is trading at 41 dollars /sh under tangible Book Value!
$80.00 a barrel is a bit much. Maybe if the present administration goes on a crushing crusade against US producers. I heard from an oil analyst on Bloomberg that USA producers have a break-even @ $35.00 a barrel. Only because they have become more efficient at getting the oil/gas out of the ground.
"KeyBanc downgraded Pioneer to ""sector weight"" and said it was ""one of the highest purchase prices we have seen in years, and it was surprising given the fact that it is largely undeveloped and a bit dilutive to PXD's average acreage quality."""

"Fortress balance sheet, break even at 35 per barrel, solid dividends, every analyst has it as STRONG BUY! This is the easiest double i’ve ever invested in."
"When oil prices rise, I here noise on this conversation board about how PXD is giving up so much money with their hedges. Now oil prices are going down, and the market is punishing PXD in a big way. Meanwhile PXD probably hedged more of their production at the higher prices, and the factory continues to run efficiently."

"Oil will be produced in the world, no matter what. If America's ability to be energy independent is taken away, besides losing pipeline jobs, oil jobs, other countries WILL pick up the slack and sell to the U.S. The world production of oil will be the same, as the world uses the same oil. We will pay more at the pump and it is more likely the oil produced elsewhere will pollute more as other countries do not have the same stringent regulations we have in our country. We should continue to be energy independent and transition to natural gas, nuclear, wind and solar. We should lead the world in these areas, but not at the expense weakening our country."
"It's days like this THAT AGAIN should have ESG Greenies questioning their Net Worth! While The Green Religious Zealots have no tolerance for what currently HEATS HOMES, STARTS CARS & What comprises their EV Batteries...They'd Better! If this market took a 20% header PXD / CVX that make Break Even at 45/BRL while Oils at 70 With FWD P/E's of 8 & 9 or EV Spac trading at 500X Next Decades SALES...NOT EARNINGS?? Again this is why we have Separation of Church & State in our Government!"
CEO said switching from growth to paying out dividends. He expects a yield of 8% next year at this stock price of oil remains above $60
trigger pulled for more at 86.25 I am lowering a 121 current cost basis. Might be ill advised but I think this will survive long term.
shares down but not all that bad imo. 6% down after being up 3% today alone. stock should dip and recover especially had oil continue higher as I feel it will be 60 by June easily. thoughts anyone??

HEY!! I'm sticking with PXD even though on a day when oil was up 2% they might have been out rallied by ENRON!
"CEO Big Liar. PXD just had big layoffs to reduce G&A costs, become single Basin producer, etc to increase shareholder value. Well, after laying off around 1000 people through VSP’s and ISP’s Pioneer is HIRING again for the very same positions eliminated. Apparently Management did not have those taking VSP’s TRAIN internal employees to replace their jobs. I am a highly skilled Geoscientist and alphabet been contacted by recruiters on behalf of Pioneer for positions held by those who took VSP and ISP. PXD obviously talks about out of the side of their mouth about reductions to increase shareholder value, then on the sly recruit to replace those who have been let go, especially over 50 and highly skilled. I shall enjoy watching this company get torn apart by TWF and EEOC and shareholders."
"High oil prices are a direct cause of inflation. Inflation is very bad for the economy. The economy is slowing, as evidenced by the huge miss in the non-farm payrolls report Friday. A slowing economy will decrease the demand for oil, and inflation will cause the Biden administration to take action, as well as the Federal reserve. What this means is oil prices will fall dramatically in the near term, and the prices of parabolic, overextended oil names like PXD, MTDR, FANG and others will also fall. It may not be tomorrow, it may not be next week. But this will happen, as oil prices this high are not sustainable."
Craig and Susan you are right.....
"The Dallas Morning News wrote, ""Pioneer will increase its position to more than 1 million net acres with the 97,000 acres from Double Point, which it said is “primarily undrilled” new land. Production is expected to begin this summer, reaching about 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Texas, the other 49 states say , ""thanks""!"
"PUT YOUR HOUSES ON PXD. THIS IS A HUGE BARGAIN AT 121 . I DONT CARE WHAT CRUDE DOES, THIS COMPANY WILL MAKE MONEY. THEY ARE THE KING OF THE PERMIAN !!!!"
"This stock is at a great price point right now. I’ve been watching it for months, and trading in and out. John Goff is an investing savant, and he’ll own about 8% of this company post-merger. David Rockecharlie has also been boasting of this roll-up strategy since at least 2017, likely even earlier (2017 was the earliest video I could find). These guys get it and have been preaching this story for years. and they’ll continue picking up the scraps from noncore holders for fractions of their value. We’re seeing today would we might call in 2/3/4 years “hindsight is 20/20” - this is the right move albeit not sexy or popular, like a $PXD or $XOM or $FANG. Those are great companies too, just an entirely different strategy. This stock will go one of two ways: 1. It’ll be the Altria of Oil & Gas - a shareholder returned focused company operating in a slowly shrinking space (depending on adoption of renewables) OR 2. Continue to acquire assets for KKR at fire sale prices and strip out costs and move on to the next. Either way we’ll be fine, I love seeing Goff stay in this for his shares. The KKR team gets a management fee of about $1million a week, I’m fine with that. P.S. Goff has (+/-)$200million in this company…"
pxd is on every buy list for 2020. $200+ by April. read the latest analyst reports!!

"technically Its a screaming buy ... its got great management , pure play , Cramer , and a potential buyout why is it so low? I have traded options on this several times and a Dead Board ... oh well ..i am buying the sept calls tomorrow"
EPIC pipeline is ready to go on line eliminating the Permian bottleneck and discount. PXD pumps wide open.
"EXXON AND CHEVRON are desperate for GROWTH both are displaying declining property yields, yet rising Dividend payments PXD clearly owns the BEST property portfolio in the Premarin Basin ...THE WRITINGS ON THE WAL!P.S. If they're going to pounce it won't be AFTER a price run....PXD is in the TARGET ZONE!"
"BOYS...WITH PXD OPERATING EXCLUSIVELY IN THE STATES THIS IS A SAFE BET. ONE OF THE BEST RUN COMPANIES IN THE INDUSTRY. STAND ALONE ITS FINE, BUT ONE OF THE BIG BOYS WILL TAKE OUT THIS COMPANY WITHIN THE YEAR. THIS IS A SOLID BET. RIDE MY COAT TAILS BOYS!!!!"
Pullback to just under $100...then on to $125 by years end. Special divi to sweeten interest?

"PXD has reserved pipeline takeaway capacity for future production. They will not only get WTI oil price, but PXD could get Brent oil price with exports. They could also buy oil at very depressed Midland basin oil prices, and PXD could sell the oil at WTI or Brent prices. Investors have to understand who has the reserved takeaway capacity."
Exxon's report highlighted strength of Permian. CVX's conference call to discuss aquistions (and missed one of course). Double whammy today should bode very well heading into earnings. Enjoy the weekend.
"At $180.00 per share, it would double my cost basis. Nope, still wouldn’t sell a share, it’s in my portfolio forever!"
love the special inaugural dividend!
"oil is the #1 performing sector in the stock market this year and its going higher. There's not enough supply and demand is increasing - simple as that. Im invested in #FANG (+23%), #PXD ( +18%), AND #COP (+15%) in the past TWO WEEKS. These are three of the best oil plays and they're going to go a lot higher bc oil company's are not drilling for more oil; keeping the supply down. They are taking the massive profits and buying back billions of dollars of stock; further causing their share prices to skyrocket. By the way - inflation is good for oil stocks. Cheers!"
"congrats to the longs, its been a good day!. Was there any midstream infrastructure involved in the sale of assets to LPI? Since the deal was announced LPI is up 15% this week."
"I found this article on 'Seeking Alpha:DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD) (“Pioneer” or “the Company”) announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash variable dividend of $1.51 per share on Pioneer’s outstanding common stock, representing approximately $370 million of capital returned to shareholders. The dividend is payable September 17, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 3, 2021."
"I'm reposting Jim's post from the SU conversation. It is extremely interesting to understanding the price movement in oil yesterday:$SU conversationShort data: March18 ,2021Today, Short sellers employed all of their tools in order to bring oil stocks and future contracts down.After failing to create a sell off in oil stocks ,they started to shorting April and May contacts for future oil.They brought WTI to 59$ from 64$.Biggest single drop since April2020.As you see in below data, compare to share price drop, the volume was extremely low.This volume does not match with share price drop.That was just a pure and irresponsible manipulation.Most media in the World censored this extraordinary event in capital market.We are talking about tens of Billions of $ contracts and options which they are trying to kill them, plus covering their short position with creating fake sell off(scaring shareholders).So far, we haven’t had sell off.Low volume.They prefer spent and burn few billion dollars and sell stocks at discount, but meanwhile save tens of billions of money in other side.Extreme and irresponsible manipulation which will have consequences in future of oil market ,especially in next OPEC+ meeting and their next policy.Explanation about below data:Vol: The total volume numbers of first hand shares which is coming into market for trading.It is different than total volume that you see in yahoo or elsewhere.Because in total volume one share can change many hands between traders.But original amount of coming shares and shorted shares are constant for day.For Canadian Stocks the volume is just for US market.SU : (Vol 2.326M shares), (Short 0.769M shares ), (33% of coming shares for trade)SU :XOM (Vol 12M ), (Short 5.715M ), (48% )CLR (Vol 1.129M ), (Short 0.703M ), (63% )CVX (Vol 3.363M ), (Short 1.784M ), (53% )OXY (Vol 8.277M ), (Short 5.32M ), (64% )CPG (Vol 0.693M ), (Short 0.314M ), (45% )CNQ (Vol 0.664M ), (Short 0.217M ), (33% )ENB (Vol 0.885M ), (Short 0.57M ), (64% )BP (Vol 3.458M ), (Short 1.265M ), (37% )CVE (Vol 1.543M ), (Short 0.978M ), (64% )CDEV (Vol 7.627M ), (Short 4.025M ), (53% )FANG (Vol 1.087M ), (Short 0.505M ), (47% )CPE (Vol 1.615M ), (Short 0.697M ), (43% )MRO (Vol 10.09M ), (Short 5.662M ), (56% )SLB (Vol 4.484M ), (Short 1.632M ), (36% )HAL (Vol 2.948M ), (Short 0.971M ), (33% )RIG (Vol 12.58M ), (Short 7.285M ), (58% )TOT (Vol 0.553M ), (Short 0.378M ), (68% )PXD (Vol 0.859M ), (Short 0.51M ), (60% )COP (Vol 2.865M ), (Short 0.808M ), (28% )BKR (Vol 1.79M ), (Short 0.659M ), (37% )LPI (Vol 0.417M ), (Short 0.181M ), (44% )PDS (Vol 0.054M ), (Short 0.02M ), (38% )#XOM, #CLR , #CVX , #OXY , #CPG , #CNQ , #ENB , #BP , #CVE , #CDEV , #FANG , #CPE, #MRO , #SLB, #HAL, #RIG , #TOT, #PXD , #COP, #BKR , #LPI , #PDS"
Why has this been dropping?
Goes to 150 after earnings today based o CXO performance today.
Pioneer's SUPERNatural resources!!!! Oh Yeah!!!
"Sheffield told analysts during the call that he was “surprised” the South Texas transaction had been negatively received. American shale drillers are pumping too much crude and need to rein it in to avoid a price-crushing glut, he added.Pioneer provided few details on the scope of the voluntary executive retirements."
$253 upgrade TP by RJ
"PXD price target is $245 +27%. FANG was $135 in 2018. It will match that high equaling another 22% upside. Enerygy / OIL is rolling thru March 2022. Energy is the #1 sector and is extremely undervalued compared to other stocks. Oil stocks trade 15% below the WTI value, meaning more upside is imminent. FANG n PXD are going to crush EARNINGS on 11/2 and catapult stock prices higher. Opec doesnt announce anything until 11/4. Oil is not optional - its what the world is CURRENTLY run on . Tech will suffer the most under inflation and oil the least. Investors will go to where the money is n that is oil. It doesnt happen often, but the years it does, extreme stock prices occur. When oil prices go higher - it's sales will not suffer until you get near $100 a barrel. Oil has a lot more to run. You stay short and miss the money."
Check out the layoff...a lot of info about $OXY $PXD & $COP merger.
What is driving this thing besides negative oil today
Wow! Ex Dividend along with an increase in share price!

This should have big gains in 2019 after trade deal gets signed..
