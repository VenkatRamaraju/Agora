"10/6: Yesterday I bought my first dip after reading the Bank of America Genius Analyst Alexander Perry, downgrade.Google US unemployment chart. This chart simple chart of US unemployment rate simply transients all supply side constraints. The same people who bought Columbia product will buy more in winter.If you want second opinion, get it from analyst Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley. SHE is 10x better at predicting the overall sector of the cyclical market: Levi, Gap, Nordstrom, etc."

"COLM is a technical buy as of now. COLM is testing support at $52-53, should it close above this with good volume. Watch for strong upside soon."

"I believe they are going to regret following the virtue signalling tactic with Bubba Wallace, outdoor company should focus on the outdoors, not politics."
"Record Q2 and 1st half, revised FY2018 up and stock gets punished. Sometimes I don't understand wall street in the short term."
"Covered my COLM Pure Earnings Short Sell at $106.85 for another outstanding profit, this time over $6k in a single day! That's the way to end a week! Immediately jumped into my next play, Sold Short ON at $39.08 with a lot of shares. I am a little bit less confident about this Pure Earnings play, and I wish I could have gotten in at a higher price point, but I still think the odds are at least 75% that ON will sell off on Monday after her PM earnings release. That Baby is STILL Bloated!Happy Weekend!"
COLM is up 5.66% to 86.74
when stock price goes down it just mirrors their book value to be less than $2.58 while the average in the industry is $12.77. Easy Money!!! Numbers don't lie.
COLM reached a new All Time High at 84.51
COLM reached a 52 Week low at 74.46
"Later tomorrow, I will be Short Selling COLM as a Pure Earnings play. COLM reports earnings after the close on Thursday, and my research shows she is poised to take a nosedive immediately after releasing what I think will be a weak and disappointing report. Why COLM?? Consider: 1: They sell clothing, specifically outerwear. And people have been hibernating indoors recently, right? Hello?! :-)2: Expecting significant Revenue declines in coming quarters.3: Stock is VERY close to a 52 week high. Why?????4: Stock is WAY over-valued.5: P/E Ratio for a clothing company is astronomical.6: Overall financials are decent, but in no way stellar enough to justify all this price frothiness.7: LOTS of Insider Selling in recent months.I'm telling you, COLM looks poised to take a nosedive upon her earnings release, and I will be very happy to Short this Bloated Baby later tomorrow. :-)Good Luck Folks! :-)"

"Earnings are out for COLM and looks quite decent at first glance. But...give it some time, lets wait for the 5:00 PM conference call, and I still think this baby will go Red for me tomorrow."
Due to their decision to sponsor a race baiter who used a hoax to incite a race war I will be dumping my shares and not buying the products ever again
Zacks Rank #1. i hour ago
COLM is up 4.91% to 101.11
Within 2 weeks this will come back to post earnings bump. Decent clothing if you’re not looking for something too stylish but way over valued.
two upgrades 118 &120
"I like COLM, great brand, quality company, small company with more exposure than UA in some areas. potential? take over target."
Any other stock recommendations similar to COLM? Thanks
COLM is up 8.50% to 61.01
"based on valuations...great takeover target, book value 2.58 while industry is 12.77, P/E is below average, and has double digit net Profit Margin....super cheap!!!"
I hate to think of what the stock would have done if it missed earnings and guided down....I guess everyone is moving their money to FAANG?

Whats the skinny on earnings this afternoon? Buy more before close?
COLM is down 6.79% to 56.25
"New Price target is $90, conservatively $87, watch for analyst upgrade PT."
"COLM is gonna sell off today, despite the ""excellent"" earnings numbers, just as it sold off 3 months ago, and despite the fact it was up big in low volume in the AH session yesterday immediately after earnings release. Fear about the future wins out here, as my Pure Earnings Short Sell trading strategy continues to be extremely successful. Happy to be a Shorty, as always!"
"Later today I will be Covering my Pure Earnings Short Sell of COLM, and then moving right on to a Short of ON, to hold through the weekend. Feeling very confident that COLM will sell off today despite delivering good earnings. It's all about valuation, folks. One of my key criteria in choosing which stocks to Short immediately ahead of earnings and hold through the release, is to find highly over-valued stocks that can be expected to sell off upon delivering even a good earnings release. That is how I achieve my 75-80% yearly win percentage. So, ON reports earnings pre-market on Monday. Not too many stocks to choose from in this particular time frame, but ON meets my strict criteria to qualify as a Pure Earnings Sell Short play. In the very crowded Semiconductor space, ON faces lots of stiff competition. The stock is significantly over-valued, and close to her 52 week high. Revenue has been declining since 2018. We have some Insider Selling just in recent weeks. Now, analyze ON financials, both stand-alone and in comparison to other Semiconductor companies. You will see this Baby is Bloated. And Bloated Babies tend to deflate upon earnings release, even if the numbers are relatively good, which I think they will be here. Financials:Debt is quite high. Compare to other Semi companies. P/E Ratio is quite high. Higher than 80+% of all Semiconductor companies. That is a direct comparison. Why so high?? This makes the stock VERY vulnerable for a sell-off even if they beat earnings expectations. Meanwhile, all other financials are essentially in-line with the sector. Nothing stands out, nothing really positive. Nothing that makes THIS company stronger than any other semi-conductor company. So, why should traders stick with this one immediately after earnings release? Most traders have profit as she is close to a 52 week high. Nope, this one is likely to sell off, 75% likely. And so I will happily sit Short on her through the weekend. Good Luck Folks!"
"If other folks are ordering as much stuff as I have in the past couple months from Columbia, they have had great revenue. Of course I buy everything on sale, so I don't know what their margins will be. Going long today as a swing earnings play ~ part of which will become a core holding if they report robustly. Nice quiet thread."
COLM is up 6.33% to 68.57
Read enough about it's political leanings to know I won't buy any more Columbia products...and now they support China more than US. Hope it goes red.
COLM is down 6.11% to 56.66
I love going against the grain....shaking the trees..Earnings surprise!!! Colder weather brings more sale.....brrrrrr
Does anyone know why it’s down 7% with a good quarter ?
Ive never understood why you would by 250mm of cash flow for 8 Billion for a company with limited growth prospect. Midnight is approaching. Head for the coach before it turns into a pumpkin
"Anticipating for $JCP Q1 report, but worried by $COLM. It has all the good figures but still having a deep red."
An old Columbia shirt I own is going in the TRASH. I will never buy anything from these hacks again. Hope the stock goes to zero.
"Well, we are suppose to have unusually cold winter. LNG and crude oil is at all time high. China is securing fuel for the upcoming winter. Why is Columbia and GAP which sells hoodies and jackets negative? These are cyclical companies. If they did stellar in summer, the same people who purchased summer clothes will buy winter clothes at similar rate.Come fall, Gap, REI, Academy stores will be barren like a grocery store in Venezuela?"
"Looking to Cover half my Short Shares of COLM at $104.01. Order in place. Hey, it's worth a shot! :-)"
Just saw your idiot CEO on CNBC. All in favor of facist Joe's mandate. What if someone had Covid already? Why should they get the vaccine as well?

"...just broke 20 day moving average...if we can break 50 day moving average, $57.39 then at the same time we will break 200 day moving average which will put this stock in a true bull mode!!!"
It is winter now. Not many will be interested to sport clothes; revenue expected to be down next quarter. Take profits now.

"There is a very negative article about Columbia in the NY Times on how it will never bring back jobs to the US. Columbia seems to engage in ""tariff engineering"". And when asked about jobs returning to the US Columbia's CEO Tim Boyle said, “There is no way,”Zero. None.” What an unpatriotic CEO, unpatriotic company. Unfortunately I could not throw out a single product they make since I have never bought any of their products. So I implore loyal, patriotic Americans to give this Benedict Arnold CEO, Mr. Doyle, the same treatment when it comes to purchasing their outsourced goods in the future, ""No way, none""! Let him sell his Parkas to the Vietnamese who make them ..."

"Sold Short a lot of shares of COLM at $113.17 about an hour ago. Earnings release is in just a few minutes and I think this is going to fall down once the numbers come out, even if they are decent beats on consensus estimates. This thing is just too expensive, the odds strongly favor a sell-off tomorrow unless they deliver grand-slam home run type numbers, and I just don't see that happening. Good Luck!"
Humm....funny the inventory is UP 28%.....WHILE SALES UP 8%.....RESULTS DON'T LOOK MANIPULATED.......

"I joined my peers and stopped buying the product after Columbia publicly attacked our 2nd amendment but I dropped them from my portfolio because I invest in organizations that focus on their core. If I want to invest in a tabloid, I’ll research tabloids that excel. Previous to their public rant, paid from stockholder dividends, I thought that Columbia was in the apparel business."
"Check out Yeti, they seem to be on the same trajectory as Columbia. About 15+% growth this year"
Nice run up since earnings release
Jumped the shark with it's political tweets. Must have a lot of factories in Mexico.
"On the proxy voting there was a line item to double the shares ( basically split), anyone know what the outcome was?"
