"While you guys are hiding under the bed, I'm taking this gift and buying JPM @ $152.99 on the dip. Where else are you going to find a 9 P/E stock yielding 2.5%. You might try those ""safe"" CDs yielding .02%, but I can take the risk for a lot more yield."

Interesting news today about JPM converting four funds to ETFs.Will mutual funds ultimately become extinct?
"JPM has a P/E of 10, growing earnings @ 3% while paying a 2.3% dividend, so there's that, Paul. ROFLMAO"

JPM does not want conservative business Conservative Purge Continues: Chase Bank Tells Gen. Michael Flynn They Are Closing His Accounts and Cancelling His Credit Cards; Claim Continuing to Allow the Decorated Veteran Access to His Accounts “Creates Reputational Risk”

Its great Banks are trading like Amazon and other tech companies. They are all up over 100% this year. At this rate JPM will be at 300 by the end of the year.
"With monthly options expiration tomorrow, they will close JPM at $155."
Did a call spread due to JPM's purge of non-leftist political figures. Paying off so far!
Feds might taper and raise interest rates would be great for banks and the rest of us. Small margins at this point with borrowing at ear zero and loaning at 3%. Borrowing at 3% sounds good but home prices are soaring with all the cheap money. So would you like high prices with cheap money or lower prices with expensive money. What people are doing is buying the payment not the house. They will all be on the hook for big debit down the road. Will the home prices remain high or sink.
"Lol I bought 4K in Sept, paid $91!!! Up 75% but the best part is they pay me $15k a year dividends while it’s going up."
This is going to 200

"The Fed just lifted a 2015 enforcement action imposed on JPMorgan after the bank pleaded guilty to attempting to manipulate the foreign exchange market. At the time, the bank attributed the misconduct principally to a single trader who had been fired."
"I favor predictions in the up to 200 range. But you must remember when dealing with the stock merket,in the words of a famous philosopher "" You don't always get what you want""."
Dimons package only pays him if the share price increases. This just ensures he will be all about JPM for the next ten years. He's a Billionaire and could easily have retired.
"Crypto Crazy - JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs are also hedging their bets for the possibility of a bankless future by funneling millions of dollars into crypto startups. BNY Mellon announced plans earlier this month to form a new team that’s developing a custody and administration platform for traditional and digital assets. An investment unit of Morgan Stanley is also in the process of considering whether to bet on Bitcoin. God Luck JPM - Stay Healthy & Wealthy!"
"It looks like a successful bounce off the 50 DMA, so fundamentally we could see $170 before too long."
"Since 2008 when it was $25 and everybody knew that investing in CD's was going to be ""dead money"", JPM has always been a great CD alternative. Even today, at $161, it's a good alternative to cash. Yielding 2.25%, with minimal risk and great capital gains potential, why would anyone leave their money sitting in a money market fund unless they really enjoy supporting the institution making money off their money. "
"Astronomical US P/E ratios and other valuation multiples are skyrocketing.US Company P/E ratios are up by 800% since March 2020, while the Earnings are down by 70%. $JPM $AAPL $TSLA"
Why Dimon let PayPal and other fin techs go unregulated? They just announced that they are going to stock trading market. PayPal might have better lobbyists in DC than all banks together! Embarrassing….from a leadership standpoint.
