$170 opening bell! Optimi$tic
Inflation numbers for consumers and producers rising fast. Fed pushing down long term bond rates using massive intervention. Anyone would be out of their mind to buy a long term bond in the face of rising inflation. Fed say inflation is temporary or transcient. Really? Have they gone to the gas pump or do they just have their drivers drive them to work? Have they been to the grocery store or do they just go out or hire an in house cook? Have they tried to buy a house or does the government give them free housing? What is going on? The credibility of the Fed is sinking as totally out of touch with real life in the USA.
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Thetraderguide.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
Dimon says earnings may disappoint. Would Jaime deliberately badmouth earnings so he can use that massive cash hoard to buyback cheap?
According to the Graham evaluation method this stock is valued just shy of it's fair value. Making it very slightly underpriced. Which in this market equates to pretty cheap for such an incredible powerhouse of a company. Graham number of 152 per share. I'm buying.
What is JPM's exposure to China finance policy change???
JPM set to buy back 10% of it stock
Interesting news today about JPM converting four funds to ETFs.Will mutual funds ultimately become extinct?
May see $155 this week!
"If Jamie gets that experimental cancer vaccine; then, I say the request for all us employees to get it is fair... But he has not, so the request is BS. They work for you, they are not your property to tell them what they can put in their body. Additionally, if something occurs will JPM bear the financial burden since it's a ""job requirement"""
With a PE of just 12 they should be buying back stock hand over fist. Do they have a buyback program?
Buy Buy Buy…. Don’t listen to these shorts heads this will be 170-180 soon
Kind looks like Jamie wants to retire. Who want to stay with a company who just screwed their shareholders. No increase in dividend or share buyback? What happen.
"Wait-- Didn't Jamie say that JPM has loaded up with cash? Then if the dollar is suddenly mooning, why is JPM down over 3%??"
do i dump or hold my calls lol i didn’t expect it to rise today to my break even
Buffett usually sell all his shares and never trims shares. He probably sold some at the end of March and the rest in April.
"It looks like a successful bounce off the 50 DMA, so fundamentally we could see $170 before too long."
(http://Pick-stocks.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
Sell the news. Q2 earning will be a correction point for market.
When this market finally crashes you can pick up JPM@ 30.00
So there was NO buyback announcement with the release of excess capital from the stress test. Are they waiting for the earnings report on July 13th to do that?
"I know the stock market is serious. We all make and lose real money. However, it’s hard to take too seriously when JPM is down today, and GME is up 18 percent."
I heard about JPM the other day on (http://Fairstox.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.

"Real successful people don’t flaunt their achievements they wait for people to see themselves what wonders they have achieved. Jamie is by far the best ceo he understands investments and the world like many fail to do. Jamie is possibly the most powerful/influential person in the world, but he has never taken the low road he has always been a humble man. this stock is to do well throughout time."
Hold this forever
Even a non-vote fed member can sink the stock market that much.
Oh man this is great! I bought 4000 shares in sept at 92! I make $15k a year in just dividends!
They had some interesting insights about JPM on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"I had a hunch it would trade lower after strong earnings. No surprise there. I love JPM long term and would love to grab more shares in the low 140’s, probably late this year."
"Chase Bank does about-face, apologizes for Gen. Flynn credit card cancellation letter, says it 'made an error'. Baloney."
It's 1 of the Biggest holding in my Portfolio
Based on 14 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for JPMorgan Chase & Co. in the last 3 months. The average price target is $171.25 with a high forecast of $200.00 and a low forecast of $135.00. The average price target represents a 12.73% change from the last price of $151.91.
"Since 2008 when it was $25 and everybody knew that investing in CD's was going to be ""dead money"", JPM has always been a great CD alternative. Even today, at $161, it's a good alternative to cash. Yielding 2.25%, with minimal risk and great capital gains potential, why would anyone leave their money sitting in a money market fund unless they really enjoy supporting the institution making money off their money. "
"HOOD is on the move….. add it to you portfolio & have fun!,"
IMO Paysafe $PSFE is a good m&a target for one of the banks like $JPM after what JP Morgan CEO said that they need exposure to fintech
I heard about JPM the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"This looks like a good report to me. There were some areas which lagged, but here are clear reasons for this...I'm holding JPM. Best in breed, really.My only concern (not related to JPM) is I have massive gains in DE, ITW, FB, MSFT etc. When do you say ""these companies are fully valued,"" and take a profit?"
"Shores bought on 11/15/90 will now yield 110%. I have owned Chase since 1989. I received shares of the NEW CHASE that was born when Chemical Bank bought Chase Manhattan Bank in 1996 and took on the Chase name. A 2/1 Split in July 1998 and a 3/2 Split in June 2000 gives the basis of those November 1990 shares, bought at 10 7/8 (stocks traded in fractions in those days) a basis of 3 5/8 or $3.625. The new $4.00 annual dividend yields the 110% yield on those old shares. A few things: 1) I am getting older, 2) selling would be almost all capital gains, 3) buying and holding good companies long term is not a bad idea."
Jpm owns over 200 million ounces of silver. The biggest silver supply in history. They run the gold market. Does that make them an unorthodox precious metals play or am I being ridiculous?
How could the pps be this low with a PE of just 12? What am I missing? Shouldn’t this be at 200?
Hey does anyone know when the big stock buy backs are happening or how to find out?
Best bank easy 180
"I'm not sure if they will get to my $155 today on options expiration, but they are pushing it pretty hard. They have to screw both the 155 call and put buyers. :-)"
Jpm will go straight to 180 after earning get them will you still can ……
This is a solid earnings beat. Will be green today.
If you look back at my post I mentioned shorting this stock on June 1 when it was $166/share. No one knows for sure where a stock is going to trade in the short term ......including me. But I think this is a good place to cover any short position and add half of your position back. GLTA
Low pre market volume. Real move after earnings call. Jamie will push this up!

Will Blockbuster disrupt itself this time? Or get swallowed up by the future? Who goes this out of their way to be bearish without a reason? Where's my JPM BTC ETF?
"Crypto Crazy - JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs are also hedging their bets for the possibility of a bankless future by funneling millions of dollars into crypto startups. BNY Mellon announced plans earlier this month to form a new team that’s developing a custody and administration platform for traditional and digital assets. An investment unit of Morgan Stanley is also in the process of considering whether to bet on Bitcoin. God Luck JPM - Stay Healthy & Wealthy!"
We are entering into a timeframe we’re Silver and gold are going to outperform everything except oil JP Morgan has been raising almost $1 trillion in cash for anticipating the next crash but silver and gold smell the risk as the big money has been buying it and the banks quiet we have been accumulating it for the last several years when the reset happens against the US dollar one silver ounce of silver will buy you one acre of land or a months worth of quality food while you will probably need $1000 to equal what that silver does.
Some will sell the news. Dont buy at the top

Imma wait until this is back to $140-ish to buy more. There is another leg down coming.
Feds might taper and raise interest rates would be great for banks and the rest of us. Small margins at this point with borrowing at ear zero and loaning at 3%. Borrowing at 3% sounds good but home prices are soaring with all the cheap money. So would you like high prices with cheap money or lower prices with expensive money. What people are doing is buying the payment not the house. They will all be on the hook for big debit down the road. Will the home prices remain high or sink.

Time to put some money into BABYF as I'm sure they will eventually work with big boys like JPM. No negative comments until you check out BABYF. If you don't find it compelling then fire away.
tomorrow gonna be a super green day you never have two blood red days with banks
Yes JPM will be surging to the peak on Monday after stress test! But we don’t want to take profit slower than others! LOL
More cash will come into crypto exchanges. Bad news for traditional consumer banking
"The Fed just lifted a 2015 enforcement action imposed on JPMorgan after the bank pleaded guilty to attempting to manipulate the foreign exchange market. At the time, the bank attributed the misconduct principally to a single trader who had been fired."
Banks seem to rally before earnings then drop right after. Even with good results. Any insight here?
If you crazy enough not to buy at these levels then you shouldn’t be in stocks. Financials especially JPM are going to lead the way for the next decade with interest rates rising they stand to benefit most from any other sector. Buy at 147-148 and you get a great dividend while waiting fir a stress test that will absolutely be a win for banks as they sit on plenty of cash and interest rates when they move higher will open up their profits to levels never seen before. Buybacks are going to push JPM higher and JPM is buying back their stock at record levels. That tells you something and you should buy if a company buys its own stock. Huge block trades will come in next week and of course the big money investors will benefit again as they took profits in the 165 range and pushed it lower with analysts to the 147 range where it so now to watch them jump back on 20 points lower. I am a buyer at this level and would feel very comfortable getting in here before they push it back up to the 165 range and then 200 in year from now. Regardless of what analysts which I call manipulators say you have to buy financials now and hold for long term if you are a long term investor.
"This T01LET JPM R!GGING GE Price, spread FALSE NEGATIVE NARRATIVES, MANIPULATING GE PRICE AND R0BBING GE INVESTORS, MILLIONS OF BABY-BOOMERS, WHO BUILT THIS GREATEST NATION EVER ."
"WOW. A record 12 billion in PROFIT. But as we all know folks, Wall Street is currently looking for companies that have hopes, dreams, and that promise a fluffy pie in the sky with lots and lots of rainbows surrounding it. And as long as you have those, sprinkled in with large net losses, your stock will most certainly climb higher.Unlike money printers like JPM. Who wants a company that has record profits? Oh no, not me."
Looks like new highs coming
Why Dimon let PayPal and other fin techs go unregulated? They just announced that they are going to stock trading market. PayPal might have better lobbyists in DC than all banks together! Embarrassing….from a leadership standpoint.
Very disappointed in the measly dividend increase 
LOOK AT NASDAQ REAL TIME TRADES YOUR STOCK WAS MANIPULATED THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH INFLATION OR PANDEMIC. EVERY SECOND JPM WAS SOLD AT 100 SHARES TO DROP THE STOCK THIS IS CALLED A LADDER ATTACK BETWEEN FUNDS THEY SHORT AND LADDER ATTACK ALL DAY ROBOT TRADING

JPM AAPL are buying back shares so I bought some on Friday!
Fed limiting dividends and buybacks is offset by Fed also easing the restrictions on the Volcker rule which will allow them to loan more freely and also invest in hedge funds and private equity funds. Overall this can be a good move for the economy and for at the same time JPM.
"It is all about PUMPING NASDAQ Composite #^IXIC BUBBLE as much and as quick as possible no matter what happens!

"Should be interesting report from Jp MORGUE. Huge complaints about slave driver hours and working conditions as they tell them to get different jobs. Problem is, they ruined the economy so there ARE NOT ANY other decent ones."
"Just like the 2008-2009 financial crisis, big banks like JPM will be the winners of the virus pandemic. Low cost deposits, increasing deposit base from stimulus money sloshing around, businesses in need to working capital and other loans surging, rising consumer credit card spending, business credit card spending, securities markets gains, excess reserves being deployed to pay dividends and buy back shares, M&As, and on and on."

AMAZON and FACEBOOK would be 400% up if their profits jump 150% but banks different as you can't play them every day .... Very soon ALL US BANKS shares and European banks shares will be most wanted shares on the stock market
Think about it this way......Jamie Dimon came out and said JPM has $500M sitting in cash that he doesn't want to lend out at next to zero interest rates. Well I think he's smart enough to know that every share he buys back after June 30th he is earning 2.32% net interest on (the dividend yield). So the buyback could be substantial.

"So much misguided optimism on this board, so many posters who don't realize that share price is a forward-looking number. That's why a beat in earnings (already baked into pre-report price) and a miss in revenues (which forecasts the future) results in a share price decline. Econ 101."

Its great Banks are trading like Amazon and other tech companies. They are all up over 100% this year. At this rate JPM will be at 300 by the end of the year.

"So many bots on this stock forum spamming FUD. To me, that's so telling. HOLD JPM FOR LIFE. They want to pry this from any weak hands willing to sell. The reality is that JPM long-term will never fail."
Relax folks… it will be green before AH.
Compare this stock to JPM back in 2007........... and you will see that JPM has OUTPERFORMED this loser 23x....that's 23 fold. Incredible! Sandy Weill destroyed CitiHYPE and Jamie Dimon (fired by CitiHYPE back in the 90's) took JPM to ALL TIME HIGHS. CitiHYPE is a $7 stock. It was $60 back in 2007. JPM has soared off its highs back when.

Where is the buyback announcement? JPM lost its edge to MS and GS in deal making...All the new IPOs are coming to market via GS and MS....Why is JPM lagging behind? Jamie Dimon got his billions from JPM....its time to reward the shareholder with 50B buyback and $1.25 a share Dividend....At least

JPM will be the new meme stock and this thread is the new Reddit
"JPM paid ONE BILLION for manipulation of precious metals.Basel III would hold Banks to account for the now legal selling of 1oz of gold 20x if it is labeled unallocated, 70% of gold market. (paper gold).Britain just announced banks in London will not be held to the Basel III agreement on gold. Guess the bankers told them it would be worse than Lehman for them. JPM really needs to get out of the gold manipulation business ASAP. Some big Hedge Funds could simply ask for gold in their account to be held in as allocated. This is a too big to fail situation. This is also a commodities problem that can't simply be papered over. Hedge Funds will want blood money to keep from crashing this problem."
"Today JPM hiked, tomorrow it may be risky."
