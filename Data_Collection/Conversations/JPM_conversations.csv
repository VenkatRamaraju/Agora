"Got my puts secured for this week i think it will reach around 160 then fly back up like it’s been doing, remember, buy the rumors and sell the news, I’ve been trading jpm for over a year and they always go down during earnings, get your calls by the end of the week of next week for another 170+ run  in this for the long term"
"JPM ... a simply amazing investment!! Far and above their bank peers, in a class of it's own! 1 yr, 3 yr, 5 yr, 10 yr. However you look at it, Long-term or short, just amazing returns plus nice divys! Plus, a rosy future with rising rates and profit margins. Very well run bank with great leadership and little bagge, unlike it's competitor WFC$"
Banks always take a hit after delivering solid earnings. Wait a week and get in. You should know the game by now

I bought 4000 in sept 20 at $91. Including dividends I’m only $8 a share away from a double!!! You go Jamie Diamond!!!
JPM beats earnings yet the stock in down big. I guess they didn't beat it enough.
Shorts when JPM beats earnings.
"JPM was out with earnings this week and the only takeaway is that they are still on track to being a $200 stock, with a nice dividend as we wait."
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
Why would this year’s estimated EPS be over $14. And next year’s est $11.83????

Time for a split? Been expecting this for a couple years.
The only way to stop this Fraudulent Artificial Stock Price PUMPING is REJECTING the US Dollar. The World Countries must REJECT The US Dollar as international reserve currency to Stop the Fraudulent US Government from PUMPING the Price of everything. $JPM $TSLA $AAPL
"I've been long in JPM since I was a young investor for almost 30 yrs. I made a large addition into JPM at a price of 31, ten yrs ago, and periodic additions since then. I have gains of 438% on the 10-yr invmt in JPM. An average annual return of about 44%, which excludes a nice, healthy dividend! Amazing long-term returns, and a great outlook, as banks are favorable right now in a rising rate future."
"I deposited 3,000 usd into my bitcoin wallet and contacted Mrs Evelyn .T. hills to trade it for me and i got my first payout of 60,000 usd...I can now understand why they’re so many recommendations about her and i am also recommending her services to you reading this post..Don’t miss out !!!Contact her on whats::app:+1 (309) 466-6406"
"loaded up on calls, we will either see green at today’s close, tomorrow or next week!!!"
"It appears Eco is short on JPM, or sold early. Big mistake! Financials will be the big beneficiary of rising Treasurys, and of increasing Fed Funds rates in 2022. The market is FWD looking, so the time to be in, is now! Banks will outperform the market! Jobs report was disappointing, but always lags! Previous months were revised upwards! Still many on the public dole, producing nothing. A burden on society."
Have you guys ever heard of http://alert-sounds.com/? The picks on there are way better than JPM
