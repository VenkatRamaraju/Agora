How will the tapering affect JPM stock?
This is disturbing: Chase Bank cancels Michael Flynn's accounts because of reputational risk? Is this really true? I thought cc companies only cared about the interest they can make off the dollar. What is going on here?
Traditional banking headed for the ice age. crypto exchanges more upside and liquidity options

"I thought about an earnings play, but honestly with the economy so screwed, how can the banks flaunt anything good at earnings, the banks have to play it down because the public will hate them if they brag. Banks will all be going down this week. imo btw I'm not invested in a short position just giving my opinion in why I didnt play banks earnings and I don't trust GS"
JPM opened Monday at $153.89 and Closed today at $163.04… Wow! and who saw that coming?
"I find it hilarious that Warren finds Powell dangerous!!! Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. Warren belongs setting on Xi's lap. Nobody champions the cause of socialism/communism more than her. Her kind absolutely ""bleed"" ingenuity and creativity from this country. Talk about dangerous."
PIE IN THE SKY
"Since 2008 when it was $25 and everybody knew that investing in CD's was going to be ""dead money"", JPM has always been a great CD alternative. Even today, at $161, it's a good alternative to cash. Yielding 2.25%, with minimal risk and great capital gains potential, why would anyone leave their money sitting in a money market fund unless they really enjoy supporting the institution making money off their money. "
Its great Banks are trading like Amazon and other tech companies. They are all up over 100% this year. At this rate JPM will be at 300 by the end of the year.
Jpm not saying this again get in VRUS stock now
Why all the bank stock is getting hammered?$WFC $C $JPM $BAC
Another pump and dump.. this is the hallmark of the bear  clearly large players are liquidating shares leaving retail investors holding bag...
"For the long term, there's still a lot more this can go. At $39B it can easily be scooped up by a $V Visa which has a $500B market cap, or $MA with a $330B market cap, or $PYPL $JPM $BAC $AXP. Affirm is disrupting the space, and adding so much value. Consumer spending are reaching records - look at bank earnings this AM, and Ecommerce continues to accelerate, making this a no brainer for the long run."
"I favor predictions in the up to 200 range. But you must remember when dealing with the stock merket,in the words of a famous philosopher "" You don't always get what you want""."

Hi Jpm bag holders.
Gold and silver are on fire today
"Lol I bought 4K in Sept, paid $91!!! Up 75% but the best part is they pay me $15k a year dividends while it’s going up."
"JPM is a great investment, past and present. Strong, stable, with a ni e divy and proven returns with great leadership. 60% gain the past year. But moreso ... JPM has gained 142% for long-term investors over the past 5 yrs!! Gotta love those averge annual returns!!!"
They had some interesting insights about JPM on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
(http://Pick-stocks.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
$AMECX LARGEST holdings in addition to large bond holdings: $JPM $PM $AVGO $MSFT $PFE $2330.TN $CME $$CCI $MO
"JPM ... a simply amazing investment!! Far and above their bank peers, in a class of it's own! 1 yr, 3 yr, 5 yr, 10 yr. However you look at it, Long-term or short, just amazing returns plus nice divys! Plus, a rosy future with rising rates and profit margins. Very well run bank with great leadership and little bagge, unlike it's competitor WFC$"
JPM beats earnings yet the stock in down big. I guess they didn't beat it enough.
Time for Jamie Dimon to phaseout. Look at GE and Bob Welch....
"Still one of my favorites, another $200 stock for sure."
Does someone really believes those Fabricated US Bank revenues?All US Companies report FABRICATED Revenues!$JPM $GS $MS
Interesting news today about JPM converting four funds to ETFs.Will mutual funds ultimately become extinct?
This is going to 200
I bought 4000 in sept 20 at $91. Including dividends I’m only $8 a share away from a double!!! You go Jamie Diamond!!!
Banks stocks are going soar if interest rates start to rise. Powell is giving plenty of warning zero interest will not be forever.
"There we go, ""Magically"" All US Stock futures gets PUMPED from deep red to green within minutes, DESPITE SO MUCH TERRIBLE NEWS, Absurd Valuations, Record high number of Bankruptcies, Record High Credit default risk, Collapsing Economy, Tanking Corporate Revenues, intense international competition for each $1 revenue!

"hmmmm.....banking business?JPMorgan Chase Committing $8.4 Million to Improve Household Stability for Black, Hispanic and Latino and Other Underserved Households"
MUCH higher Wed. morning!!
Should I buy tomorrow or wait? Just sold some Chinese stocks friday
"Is JPM the poster child for what's horribly wrong with America? Villainously corrupt to the core? Floated by forever stock buy backs financed by a rogue insanely out of control Fed? Will banks will be first on the hook when the day of reckoning arrives? I see a day when banks no longer exist, replaced by a system that serves the public interest instead of a rigged system supporting a select group of privileged despots,"
Will JPM get ruined shorting BCT ?
Looks like it will turn red…
What is the price target for JPM?
WHY THE DOWNTURN ?
I wonder how many folks pulled their Chase accounts?

"when this goes down, it comes right back up."
"loaded up on calls, we will either see green at today’s close, tomorrow or next week!!!"
"I'm doing to declare this a respectable 4-day move in JPM. $170 is looking more like a certainty now, more than ever. ;-)"
shorts will cover and jpm will rocket to the moon when the market opens
"Very bullish on this for the Long term , amazing stock, but after trading with it for over a year I expect a drop around the earnings date most likely after"
"does JPM have exposure to SHANGHAI, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Bonds issued by indebted developer China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) slumped on Monday after a ratings downgrade led to restrictions on their use as collateral, prompting China's stock exchanges to halt trade.The Shanghai Stock Exchange said in a statement that it had temporarily suspended trading in China Evergrande Group's 6.98% July 2022 corporate bond following ""abnormal fluctuations."" The exchange had also suspended trading in the bond on Friday.Shanghai exchange data showed the bonds sliding more than 25% to a low of 40.18 yuan after the resumption of trade on Monday afternoon. The company's 5.9% May 2023 Shenzhen-traded bond , which was also suspended, fell more than 35% after trading resumed.The slump in bond prices comes after a ratings downgrade erased the bonds' value for use in pledged repo trading."
"Chase Bank says it gave 'coaching' to employee who canceled account of Lt. Gen. Flynn's wife. Chase previously told the Daily Mail that ""we made an error"" with the letter and had contacted Lori Flynn to apologize ""for any inconvenience this caused.""""We have never and would never close an account due to political affiliation,"" the spokesperson told Just the News, emphasizing that Lori Flynn's account was never closed."
"If there are fears of a global slowdown, why would the Federal Reserve need to raise interest rates?"
Chase has the worst customer service I have ever seen.It cost me a ton of fees and five months of wasted time applying for a mortgage.Even though I was conditionally approved.That kind of service has got to effect their earnings.
At least the 172.5 calls I wrote will expire worthless on Friday. Hopefully a rebound next week so I can write more.
Did a call spread due to JPM's purge of non-leftist political figures. Paying off so far!
"With monthly options expiration tomorrow, they will close JPM at $155."
"Lumber is way up from $320 during last year, now to $790 this year. Price is surging strongly."
Averaged down
"JPMorgan received almost 50,000 applications for about 400 internship positions at its investment banking program this year, The acceptance rate was less than 1% . Interns typically return as first-year analysts making $200K/yr after they graduate."
"4 JPM employees sent to prison for racketeering and spoofing of previous metal market’s. Finally, some proper justice coming into place for these bankster criminals.Link can be found in Reuters"
How can you short bonds?

"I disagree with Jamie maybe the U.S. Govt Should Default, Just Maybe the FED Govt should start paying 15% interest rate on it's DEBT!

So why allow the FEDS to continue to Print and give investors near zero percent return! in a 10% Inflation environment. There has to be double digit interest rates to offset the double digit inflation! The FEDS just rob people give them nothing for their borrowings and then just Rig and Price Fix Interest Rates in a 10% Inflation Environment. Best to Default now before the debt goes to $50 Trillion by the time Biden is out of office.!"

"It's not that the Federal Government will not default on the $28.4 Trillion U.S. it's when. The Fed's Tapering is just communication. Tapering is actually required because nobody but the Federal Govt is buying the U.S. Debt. You think in a 7% Inflation environment that U.S. investors are buying U.S. Debt for less then 1%? No only the FEDS. If S&P was doing its job here they would download U.S. Debt down to Triple B where it belongs and the FEDS like anyone else in the situation needs to start paying between 5% to 7% interest on it's debt like starting next week. Likewise all the Debt Ridden Tech Companies need to be refinancing there Debt not at 3% but at 15% or higher. The Interest rates after the 2008 Financial crises should have never been allowed to go so low. The Feds Failure to act is the major cause of the increased inflation we are all seeing now. Those low rates caused housing prices in the U.S. to rise 35% in just 10 years. Those increased housing prices put the entire Financial System at risk sine the debt ratio of new home buyers has never been higher! Additionally, in some states 1/3rd of the 55 million Americans living on Social Security now pay their entire Social Security income just on there property taxes. The Local and State Governments are great at taxing home value appreciation. The U.S. Govt needs to get the $28.4 Trillion Debt under control. The Social Security Medicare System basically goes Bankrupt in less then three years at a time when the ranks of the Aged Social Security recipients will hit record highs. This U.S. Government is ready to default on $28.4 Trillion in debt, at the same time we see over 1.9 million people tax our welfare and health systems as they pour in from Mexico, Haiti, Afghanization. We have 25,000 American U.S. Veterans living on the streets in LA and San Francisco and we have 1.2 Million Mexican Illegal Immigrants living in Hotels paid by the U.S. Taxpayer. We have towns in the U.S. whose U.S. Demographic backgrounds have been 99% U.S. Born Americans, no supporting elementary school systems made up of 40% non American born students being paid by U.S. Taxpayers many who ae U.S. Senior Citizens who have not seen a COLA adjustment to there social security checks greater then 1% in nearly 20 years, this in a 7% Inflation Environment, with many in northeast cities seeing property tax increases nearing 200% in the last 10 Years. It needs to stop. U.S. American Citizens need to take America back from the wacko's running this country into the the ground! The U.S debt is unsustainable!"

Weak price action. If Q3 was supposed to be such good numbers why is the SPY already rolling over? Ha ha ha
"Even after being up 28% so far this year, JPM still has about another 20% to go. A nice dividend to boot."
"$SPY bouncing there is NO JUSTIFICATION for $MSFT to have crashed down 3.62% or $GOOGL down 3.72%!!! These 2 will be gobbled up by hedgefunds and savy value investors, Traders are already getting their shopping cart  ready to load these bloodied giants up. $MSFT was a great...Sign that today's selloff was NOT about the treasury yields at all, just like last week evergrande was not the reason the market crashed either. Traders are going to be LOADING $AAPL $MSFT $GOOG $GOOGL $AMZN $HD $JPM $NVDA down at these levels, even if for just a swing. $SPY $447"

JPM does not want conservative business Conservative Purge Continues: Chase Bank Tells Gen. Michael Flynn They Are Closing His Accounts and Cancelling His Credit Cards; Claim Continuing to Allow the Decorated Veteran Access to His Accounts “Creates Reputational Risk”
"I've been long in JPM since I was a young investor for almost 30 yrs. I made a large addition into JPM at a price of 31, ten yrs ago, and periodic additions since then. I have gains of 438% on the 10-yr invmt in JPM. An average annual return of about 44%, which excludes a nice, healthy dividend! Amazing long-term returns, and a great outlook, as banks are favorable right now in a rising rate future."
"What world we live in? Gamblers are paying $61K to Gamble for quick 1-2% Capital Gains, risking to lose all money! Fraudulent Pyramid Scheme Bitcoin will soon FALL to $0 in a blink of an eye! Remember, that SCAM was $0.00000000001 not long time ago!$JPM $TSLA $AAPL"

"well, the wall street whining little babies weren't satisfied by a solid earnings report. Tanking the stock for no reason. Analysts have no credibility. who really listens to them?"
"Crypto Crazy - JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs are also hedging their bets for the possibility of a bankless future by funneling millions of dollars into crypto startups. BNY Mellon announced plans earlier this month to form a new team that’s developing a custody and administration platform for traditional and digital assets. An investment unit of Morgan Stanley is also in the process of considering whether to bet on Bitcoin. God Luck JPM - Stay Healthy & Wealthy!"

"increased spreads as fed tapers will be a plus for banks, also consumer borrowing should pick up now that all the govt goodies are drying up."
"I love days like today when JPM gives investors who have missed out on the 25% share gain so far this year, a chance to get in at a discount. Even though shares prices are up nicely over the past few years, they still have about 20% more left in them. JPM is a nice risk adverse stock with a nice dividend for those with looking for a low beta holding."
"JPM will trade 12 to 13x, 2 years from today."
"While you guys are hiding under the bed, I'm taking this gift and buying JPM @ $152.99 on the dip. Where else are you going to find a 9 P/E stock yielding 2.5%. You might try those ""safe"" CDs yielding .02%, but I can take the risk for a lot more yield."
So JPM beats and gets crushed.....other banks beat and go UP.......why????
So how does JPM actually make money again?

"Yahoo only has the one year target on JPM @ $168. Call me an optimist, but $192 certainly seems doable, looking at the numbers. :-)"
"It appears Eco is short on JPM, or sold early. Big mistake! Financials will be the big beneficiary of rising Treasurys, and of increasing Fed Funds rates in 2022. The market is FWD looking, so the time to be in, is now! Banks will outperform the market! Jobs report was disappointing, but always lags! Previous months were revised upwards! Still many on the public dole, producing nothing. A burden on society."
