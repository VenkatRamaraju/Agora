This is insane. Luckily my shares are tied up in calls. Just bought more at $16 gap.
HBI has almost 20% of its shares shorted. I think the price will go down a little while longer maybe to 13 to l et the shorts cover and then will head up to 18. Yes they are losing Target as a customer but they have other areas of revenue that are making up for that loss. Their online sales are growing at substantial pace. They are continuing to expand their market internationally. One of the concerns would be if other big box stores follow target and produce their own brand underwear. The Dividend is safe and they will continue to pay down debt. I am long and will add to my position with anything under 13Good luck
lots of negativity around this stock but one thing I've noticed.. hanes is one of the only brands you can currently walk in a store and buy. walmart and target carry it. the rest of the stores who carry the competition are closed for the foreseeable future.
Investment funds sell it in down markets to raise cash for redemptions and sell it in up markets to invest in momentum stocks ….hbi does well in flat markets as long as they meet their quarterly earnings forecast …if not an abrupt sell down occurs 
My guess is someone has information we don't and is getting out of the stock. I've still got half my original position. Will just hold for the div. If it hits say a 52 week low I might buy back in my other half for the div. I think the problem HBI has is that they have to continue to strengthen their balance sheet and restore some steady growth. They might be able to do that of course. But this might be the type of stock that trades in a range for a few years. Glad they have the div.
Is there a reason why this stock is down 6% lol?
"Why the stock is tanking today, 9/30? Any news?"
"Having a hard time deciding to pull the trigger on HBI and buy 4,500 shares... I always buy the same $ amount and kids laugh about it...two reasons why I do it...First I can immediately look at my investments as know exactly where I stand on each of them...Secondly, by investing the same $ amount it forces me to diversify my portfolio with the capital gains from each sale...HBI meets all of my basic criteria low PE ratio, Profits are covering dividends etc...Typically I don’t invest in consumable goods...Any thoughts?"
"I posted this message 10 days back:""HBI is dragged into the pit by shorts and it's only a matter of time before this stock with bump up to $14. All the financials look solid, new addition to the marketing team from walmart is a bonus. Hold on tight and it will pay off. Long here"".I hope folks who got in around $13 are reaping some benefits. With new additions to the marketing team, now I can see this baby past $17 by Christmas. I am being very reasonable because PFE vaccine will be approved by Dec 12 or so, and there will be lot of optimism for stocks. Please don't sell and hold for few more weeks and Santa will reward you. Happy Thanksgiving folks!!!!!"
"Another thing from the ER I found interesting. ""The company repurchased approximately 14.5 million shares in the first quarter and has suspended share repurchases for the remainder of the year. The average diluted shares outstanding for the first quarter were 359 million."" ---- 14.5 million shares retired in less than a qtr. They had to have been buying fast as the share price collapsed. Even if they got the shares for an average of 8.00 that would still be over half of their 200million dollar for the year buyback. I think they knew once they furloughed employees it would be a PR nightmare to continue the buyback so they bought aggressively before. Outstanding shares are at their lowest level ever since 2006.https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/HBI/hanesbrands/shares-outstanding"
"Folks, if you want the dividend from HBI, the ex-div date is Nov 9th. Lots of investors get confused about ex-div date. If you want 15 Cents from HBI as dividend then you must hold by Nov 8th. The markets are closed on sat and Sun, which means you have to buy HBI today. I was lucky to get in yesterday @ 13 and I own 3447 on huge discount. I am a happy HBI investor and I wear Hanes brand clothing. Michael Jordan used to wear it too, just saying!!!!!"
Cotton futures price going up
"Even after the 40% run, still massively undervalued according to Morningstar (fair value of $23 per share). Not sure about $23, but agree there's still a lot of room to run upward."
"I have held this stock and accumulated on dips for several years and just recently got into the green. I hold it for its low PE, high dividend and the fact it actually has a product I can understand and use. When everything else collapses, I know this stock will become that much more popular with those looking for a safe harbor and steady income. On the other hand, getting a 20% bounce is a real tonic for this old guy."
HBI UP OVER 5% today on impressive volume. Delivered over 320 million cloth face masks ahead of schedule; also announced contract today to make 20 million “reusable” hospital gowns for FEMA. Love this stock; am proud to own it. GLTA involved; stay safe.
This trades like its an indebted discount airline with side businesses in amusement parks and oil drilling equipment.
"As an investor in Hanes (for the past decade) these are my personal opinions. After listening to the conference call each quarter for the past 10-12 quarters, unfortunately it seems the company is stale. Every quarterly conference call is the same with the same comments regarding the overall business results. ""We are very pleased with our results"". ""1-3% growth"".""Were well on our way to our achieving our annual goals""""Inner-wear sales continue to be soft as we planned""""Active-wear sales continue to outperform our expectations minus C9"".""Currency Headwinds""Challenging retail environment"" ""On pace to pay down debt""""On pace to achieve our mid to upper level guidance""""Input/raw material cost challenges""""Inventory challenges""While all this may be true (and some of it good) every quarter for the past 3 years, their does not seem to be an exciting vision with innovating product/plans to generate investor value or create excitement to drive investors to purchase more stock. There are many companies facing similar challenges however some of them are continuously changing and adapting in an attempt to say ahead of the competition and to increase shareholder value. Hanes has many well known great brands. Brand names carry a lot of weight however many of today's consumers are more quality, service and price conscious then they have been in the past. This type of consumer environment requires companies to innovate, adapt, and change in order to continuously achieve improving results and stay ahead of the competition weather it be brand or private label. Quarterly results continue to be ""ok"" but nothing to get excited about which results in the share price continuously declining. Lower Highs and lower lows. Unfortunately the stock is down over 50% the past 3 years while the stock market is up 50% over the same time period. The company has a good dividend yield but unfortunately that is the only excitement for shareholders over the past 3 years. A 3.5% - 5% dividend yield is good but gets lost when the share price is declining 10-20% per year. Favorite quote: Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different result. Strategic creativity, product innovation, marketing, and change are needed to improve results increasing shareholder excitement to drive the share price. As we have seen the past couple years, Champions explosive growth by its self is not increasing share price and getting investors excited. It will take other business segment to contribute substantial growth as well as Champion. Today's price decline could partially be contributed to the market being down 280 points however if investors were impressed with the results today then most likely the stock would not be down 6.5% today. Hopefully some short term investors were exiting today and the next few weeks will see an upside. There should be somewhat of an upside due to the dividend in the next couple weeks. Moving forward it appears there needs to be additional changes and improved overall performance from other business segments for the stock price to reverse the down trend. As a decade long investor, it would be good to see some changes and improved performance for all investors. Hanes did it from 2010 - 2016 and it would be great to see it again."
Any market headwinds this stock falls 4x the S & P 500 …….by percentage 
Credit Suisse ups HBI FROM “neutral” to “outperform”; lifts PT from $13 to $15.
Looks like a another new 52 week low may be on the horizon. There seems to be a big disconnect between management and shareholders. Management is very happy and proud of the results the past 5 years. It doesn't appear shareholders have the same perception as management. Hopefully management will wake up and start focusing on shareholder value.
"I’m also very surprised by how much this stock is getting beat up - is it concern over future earnings? Well that’s not being reflected in the analyst’s numbers (of course - we all know analysts are always wrong...) Is it concerns over potential slowing of Champion brand growth and waiting to see the full impact of the Target change? (Rob - I would not describe it as a Champion “decline” - the decline is only happening at Target.) Once again - not being reflected in future earnings numbers... The only real concern that I have is debt which they are actively working on. Will this get into a safe range before any potential future recession? What else is out there that I’m missing? I got shares last Dec and I have picked up some more shares today. The report this time last year was good and there was a nice pop - sold calls and buffered the drop that followed. I’ll do the same again if needed. At some point I think that others will see the value in this consistent performer. Are they going to have explosive growth - no, but they are consistent and there is value in that beyond what the current price is reflecting."
"From Reuters report on Kohl's earnings release: ""Kohl’s is also betting on the rise in demand for activewears such as running shoes and workout clothes as more people turn to health and wellness during the pandemic. The company is planning to increase the space for such products in its outlets by adding brands such as Eddie Bauer and expanding those offered from HanesBrands Inc’s Champion."""
Value investors will start showing up at this level.
So much to like in that report. Constant-currency organic sales increased slightly. Okay thats not great but sales did increase. The rest of the report was exactly what I wanted to see. Total International constant currency organic sales increased 10% in the fourth quarter and 12% for 2019. Net debt reduced to 2.9 times adjusted EBITDA with debt reduction of $460 million in 4Q (it ended 2018 with an EBITDA of 3.3). Expectations of $200 million in share repurchases in 2020.
This is not a stock you sell here. It is a stock you buy on the dips.
What's wrong with a 4.07% dividend (easily covered) while waiting for much better earnings. The 10-year T note is paying .53%.
Is it the end of year loss of the Target contract what is holding this thing down? Growth seems healthy and the Champion brand is showing up at more and more specialty stores and department stores with greater floor space.
"Zacks rating this week of 4 or to sell when just last week they were rated 1 for a strong buy........this can’t be correct“Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. HBI is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).”Any comments"
will someone explain to me why this stock continues to drop after repeated times of surpassing earnings. The stock looks good -
Every time the stock starts to move the market as a whole stalls or declines and funds sell off taking away its gain 
"This was the most informative conference call I have listened to from Hanes in 13 years. Listening to the conference call, in my opinion, they made the correct decision to hire Steve Bratspries. I would encourage you to listen to the conference call or read the transcript when it becomes available. He provided detailed information regarding the ""Full Potential Plan,"" It's obvious he has experience in operation efficiency, productivity, and brand management. He was very impressive in providing details on the future strategic plan which included reducing poor-performing SKU's, supply chain efficiency, improving product mix, marketing to the younger generation, and focusing on consumer wants and needs. It is obvious; he understands marketing and brand management. Hanes has many iconic brands, but it has to be what the consumer wants, at the right price, at the right time, when the consumer wants it which will be part of his strategy. It appears he is action-orientated verse talking the talk. He has brought in new talent to assist in executing strategy. They have formed 20 teams to focus on 20 strategic initiatives to fuel future growth through a cost-saving self-funded growth. He provided more details on the current business status and future growth strategies. He stated Hanes will provide additional detailed information regarding the strategic plan at the May investors conference. I'm looking forward to additional details! Good Luck!"
"Value Line seems bullish on HBIThere are some cost pressures, but improving customer trends are boosting Hanesbrands’ performance. Theapparel sector is benefiting from the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, as restrictions are starting to ease. Overall, as the economy recovers and businesses reopen, consumer spending on apparel items is picking up. Demand for Innerwear and Activewear categories has stayed strong, driven by the Hanes and Championbrands. Sports and college licensing businesses are also experiencing improving sales, as institutions reopen. Moreover, e-commerce operations have been doing well. Still, SG&A expenses related to the ongoing Full Potential plan (more below)will likely remain elevated. Also, disruptions in supply chains globally have inflated costs. But, overall trends are encouraging, giving the top line a good boost.The Full Potential plan appears to beprogressing well. Investors may recallthat management began implementing thethree-year strategy in the fourth quarterof last year to streamline operations.Divestiture of the European Innerwearbusiness and exit of the PPE businesswere according to the plan. The strategyhas four pillars: to grow the Championbrand globally, drive growth in Innerwearby attracting younger consumers, deliverinnovative products, and improve brandawareness through marketing, digital capabilities, and restructuring operations.The company aspires to achieve incremental revenues of $1.2 billion by 2024 androughly $160 million in cost savings tocounterbalance increased investments. Alltold, the Full Potential plan looks promising and will likely help the company focuson high-growth opportunities. We notethat charges related to the ongoing strategy will probably pressure the bottomline, to some extent. Still, solid digitalsales and the upcoming holiday seasonshould counterbalance these headwinds.In all, the company has a promisinggrowth plan in place. For now, share netfor 2021 and 2022 will probably advance17% and 9%, respectively.Shares of Hanesbrands are ranked tomirror the broader market averages.However, at present, HBI has above average long-term upside potential."

In addition, the company is supplying the U.S. government with more than 320 million reusable cloth face coverings and more than 20 million reusable long-sleeve medical gowns."
While market has created a huge market for day traders and shorts. I hope this volatility slows down. Make 2k here then lose 3-4K next day
I had a cost bases of $14.40 and just sold this morning at $19.11. This stock is now much closer to fairly valued and its time to find another underappreciated company. Thank you hanes for the great performance!
Congrats to all longs who stayed it - looks like a good quarterly result.
