"Hanes needs to invest in advertising. They have no image the public can latch on to as being tough, cool or whatever. And I am not talking about flooding peoples email with bothersome advertising like Jockey does."
"HBI hiked the dividend 20%, from .15/Q to .18/Q. Works for me.."
"Average Joes are buying lots of Hanes brand products from Walmart, Target, Kohls, etc. There is demand for daily wear products but not for sports and we know the reason why! Pandemic has not been kind to many companies like JCP, J Crew, etc but HBI has been flexible in manufacturing pandemic accessories also. High schools and major sports are slowly starting and we can expect Champion brand to be in demand again. Folks, we have guaranteed dividend as of now, the future looks optimistic and we can see some profits. I am long and holding."
"I don't understand the downgrade of price on this stock. I have pointed out their weaknesses, however they also have strengths. Their ratios are performing well and this stock trades much lower than the competition. I don't get it."
"I don't understand why they continually beat up this stock. Their numbers are good and they can afford their debt while they work hard at reducing it. They are innovating, expanding globally, and have an impressive customer base. I just don't get it especially since institutions are in large part who own and trade it - seems like a rigged game to me."
"If you go to the Target website and search C9, you can still find items there (some on discount so I assume these are being phased out?!?!?, some full price...) So was the plan to stop selling all C9 items or just C9 underwear?"
"Loading up here. Not many stocks in this market with a PE under 8 and PEG under 3, coupled with positive metrics across the board - i.e. ROA, ROE, Earnings growth and LFC of ~ $500M and Div of 4.39%Any continued improvements to the fundamentals/financials will add further value to an overly beaten down stock."
I'd be shocked if they didn't blow Q4 estimates away. I work with highschool students on a a weekly basis and right after winter break it was like boom. One out of 10 students was wearing Champion. Before these past few weeks I never noticed students in my state (mid West) wearing Champion.This past week I browsed through the mall checking every store that sold champion and popular sizes like medium and large were out of stock from Zumiezs to JCP to Champs. Slim pickings everywhere especially for the higher dollar merchandise. Virtually every store was sold out of Champion sweatpants. Only Champion product fully stock was $11 pajama pants nobody seemed to want. Online I came across countless products on Amazon and Champion .com that also we're missing various sizes. Long Hanes.
"Up >12% in 14 trading days, not too shabby. In a raging bull market doesn't sound like much, but consider: it's more than a 10yrT will yield in 4 years! It pays more div. than the 10yr, and increases the div yearly, > than inflation. I'll be holding my stones inside Hanes long term.."
CNBC Carter Worth ...HBI a breakout stock ....laggards but now match the S&P long term ...outperformed during the correction ...value and dividend
These guys still have Jordan...Hahahaha that’s got to account for something.
"95% of the Hanesbrands products sold on Amazon get at least a 4.5 star rating. Of the 32 top products in Amazon's men's fashion best sellers, 7 are products from Hanesbrands."
HBI has almost 20% of its shares shorted. I think the price will go down a little while longer maybe to 13 to l et the shorts cover and then will head up to 18. Yes they are losing Target as a customer but they have other areas of revenue that are making up for that loss. Their online sales are growing at substantial pace. They are continuing to expand their market internationally. One of the concerns would be if other big box stores follow target and produce their own brand underwear. The Dividend is safe and they will continue to pay down debt. I am long and will add to my position with anything under 13Good luck
At 13.80 it's a major buy
"My underwear feels much more comfortable up here over $14. Now I have plenty of ball room. Thanks, Hanes!"
Tomorrow is the last day you can buy the stock and get the dividend.
Buying @ 17.31
"The Champion Brand is having it's moment as a fashion brand with the youth. More fashion forward product being released, gaining floorspace at Zuimiez, Lord and Taylor , Boscov's etc and more importantly more SKU's for women. The downside is that their does appear to be a cap on this stock due to the contract with target ending December 31st this year. Because of that it almost looks like a trade for the next 7 months and then possibly an investment after the C9 product is pulled from Target."
Why would anyone sell for few cents of profit when you can gain few dollars in few weeks per share???? Hold it and you will see profits. Vaccines are almost there in few weeks and most folks will get vaccinated and close the lid on Corona. 2021 will be remembered as the year that changed the world with vaccination and back to normal life without a mask. HBI will be around $25 by the end of 2021.
Congrats to all longs who stayed it - looks like a good quarterly result.
Why aren’t they making N95 masks for the last 8 months. Supply is not keeping up with demand and won’t be for a long time.
Today is Div payment day. I mean you really have to look at the bright side but its one of few times a lower price is a good thing. That and the 200 million in buybacks in 2020 can retire extra shares. At $12.00 average they can knock out over 4.1 million shares this QTR alone over the 3.3 million they would retire at if it was at $15.00. Like I said Mr.Brightside
"$HBI $TSLA $PLTR $NCLH $EB $LUV buy your favorite stocks at today's lows. Market is going to rocket come Monday. Mark my words and check my previous posts, I'm usually right."
"I still have some hanes, sold some because I wanted to throw it into tech. I'm genuinely suprised that Hanes did not move more. You figure a stay at home economy would love cheap affordable hanes now focusing on E commerce"
Only one of their 5 manufacturing plants in Asia is in China so this cant all be about tariffs. Oh well looks like I bought to early yesterday but unless something is going on behind the scene it still looks like a solid stock with steady earnings and low valuation. What is going on?
"The new products, face shields and hospital gowns are going to be with us for a long time. HBI is global, and there is a huge demand of reusable masks and gowns from developing countries, where they can't afford to dispose these things after a single use. HBI is undervalued at this point! Still chance to get in..."
Do they have much left in their buy back plan?
My guess is someone has information we don't and is getting out of the stock. I've still got half my original position. Will just hold for the div. If it hits say a 52 week low I might buy back in my other half for the div. I think the problem HBI has is that they have to continue to strengthen their balance sheet and restore some steady growth. They might be able to do that of course. But this might be the type of stock that trades in a range for a few years. Glad they have the div.
Who to believe? Morningstar has a PT OF $27 while Argus has a PT of $16.00 - so no credibility then within the ANALysts? How much do they get paid? Who has the more accurate crystal ball?
I'm in here 20k shares. Value is my bread and butter. 4.7% is just meh but I think there's some mid-term upside where I could re-position.
"The way this trades people must stop wearing underwear when sheltering in place. Well, not me, so it must be you. That would explain the low share price."
"Value investors, hedge funds , in for low PE and dividend forcing a short squeeze ..watch volumes !"
"Levi's just had a great quarter. Maybe HBI should be purchased by them since they know how to increase sales, profit, and margins. HBI has spent billions on acquisitions and they still can't perform."
"Gotta admit... I didn't think a new low was in the cards, even with the market trending down this week. I own my shares mid-$14's and sitting tight for now, but nothing has changed for the company since I bought so will consider buying more if it drops much further."
great earnings due to sales of comfort brands. PPE made revenue exceptional!
"Eventually when Hanes finds a new CEO and new permanent CFO, they will have a lot of damage to repair ahead of them with investors from the current management and leadership team. Based on the attached article, the stock short position is currently 17.2% which is 3rd highest in the S&P 500. In April it was shorted over 20%. Hanes stock has maintained a fairly high short interest the past few years as the stock price dropped from $34 to the current levels due to a lack of confidence by investors. https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-investors-dont-trust-these-stocks-rallies-coronavirus-covid/?src=A00220&yptr=yahooIf the company can identify and hire a competent CEO who has the leadership skills and authority to implement transformational leadership changes in the company, it could eventually result in a short covering in the stock price. I'm looking forward and hoping at some point we see a major short covering with some new transformational leadership not only for the future of Hanes but investors as well! Good Luck."
There goes about 1 BB in market cap. It would take > 4 years of dividends to get today back. :/
"HBI is dragged into the pit by shorts and its only a matter of time before this stock with bump up to $14. All the financial look solid, new addition to the marketing team from walmart is a bonus. Hold on tight and it will pay off. Long here."
"I posted this message 10 days back:""HBI is dragged into the pit by shorts and it's only a matter of time before this stock with bump up to $14. All the financials look solid, new addition to the marketing team from walmart is a bonus. Hold on tight and it will pay off. Long here"".I hope folks who got in around $13 are reaping some benefits. With new additions to the marketing team, now I can see this baby past $17 by Christmas. I am being very reasonable because PFE vaccine will be approved by Dec 12 or so, and there will be lot of optimism for stocks. Please don't sell and hold for few more weeks and Santa will reward you. Happy Thanksgiving folks!!!!!"
I wish Shareholders would have been included in the Evans poll/survey
"Be patient. They have great brands at good prices, make money, and pay a nice dividend. Their products are quality, regardless of what anyone says. It will be in the 20’s soon unless you are a day trader."
"t one day market advance in history ..and HBI ....with a low PE , high dividend and now a product with global disparate demand did ...Nothing !"
have kids and you will know that every kid is wearing champion
"P/E below 10, they crush earnings and down 18%. I grabbed 1k shares at $13.43 while sitting in my Hanes boxer briefs!"
Is HBI a good stock to buy today
Free consumer mask with each package of briefs ..Champion brand !
"I have held this stock and accumulated on dips for several years and just recently got into the green. I hold it for its low PE, high dividend and the fact it actually has a product I can understand and use. When everything else collapses, I know this stock will become that much more popular with those looking for a safe harbor and steady income. On the other hand, getting a 20% bounce is a real tonic for this old guy."
"The Goldman Sachs presentation is worth a listen -https://event.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1258663&tp_key=6458cbf7e9After listening, hard to believe this is a $14 stock"
"So I have a decent amount of Hanes shares so I was glad to see the pop today, but I’m not sure if the whole storyline from Credit Suisse is credible - specifically for Hanes brand (read the note from them if you have not). That being said I do believe that Champion brand is going to do very good this fall - tonight I googled “most popular brands” and Champion is still moving up the list AND when you go on Amazon and search “best selling clothes for teens” (and even for men) Champion items are at the top of the lists. I look forward to hearing the earnings call and outlook - esp for the Ecom channel."
Hey guys! This is getting to the point where we can put together all our bus money and buy the company. Who’s in?
"I would like a serious exchange / discussion here... so everyone is calling for a huge surprise. I have ~5k shares so I would love a spike in price, but if Hanes / Champion is selling like hot cakes then why has (is) most of the items on Amazon selling at such a discount? I’m optimistic about the back to school season and the fact that Champion is a lower priced popular brand (cost conscious parents during these uncertain times), but I’m not sure sure that this past quarterbacked been a blow-out. If it was, why sell inventory at a discount? Help me understand what others are seeing that I’m missing."
"Any idea how this adds to revenue....This should be a huger this sounds genius...Hanes takes a fresh look at the $11 billion U.S. babywear category, launches Ultimate Baby line exclusively in Amazon’s online and mobile storesFlexy and Zippin collections designed to grow with babies, differentiated by four simple sizes"
"this stock never moves. 2 small steps forward, one big step back. Just wasting money that could be used for other opportunities"
I'm a Hanes buyer. I enjoy their cheaper products. They get the job done.I have a question moving foward. When jobs move from more remote distance. How will Hane or any clothing industry do? How is Hanes online sales? Maybe they could focus on more subscription based sales or online sales for essentials.Here's another thing. The durability of clothes won't be going down as fast if people move towards working at home and jobs become less physically demanding. Remote work and less labor = less need for the repurchasing of clothes in general. Less need for extravagant clothing. Hell. Perhaps even an underwear that wouldve lasted 2 years now lasts 3 years or a t shirt for 5.How will Hanes adjust moving foward? I may buy more but I want to know. I suppose I should read some investors relations. I didn't buy enough as of yet but may read that. Any opinions? Thank you.
"Someone sold 2.8 million shares at $14.59 in after hours trading last night. My guess is that those shares are what has pulled the price down this morning. 2.5 million shares have been traded so far today, so it will be interesting to see what happens once we pass the 2.8 million shares level"
Target may want to rethink their supply contract with HBI. Champion is a fast trending brand and will gain momentum as more endorsement deals are signed. Investors are blind to the potential. What if Target comes back knowing Champion can boost their own bottom line. Sellers are weak handed.
I still don't understand why this stock is going lower and lower...
"From Reuters report on Kohl's earnings release: ""Kohl’s is also betting on the rise in demand for activewears such as running shoes and workout clothes as more people turn to health and wellness during the pandemic. The company is planning to increase the space for such products in its outlets by adding brands such as Eddie Bauer and expanding those offered from HanesBrands Inc’s Champion."""
Investment funds sell it in down markets to raise cash for redemptions and sell it in up markets to invest in momentum stocks ….hbi does well in flat markets as long as they meet their quarterly earnings forecast …if not an abrupt sell down occurs 
I had a cost bases of $14.40 and just sold this morning at $19.11. This stock is now much closer to fairly valued and its time to find another underappreciated company. Thank you hanes for the great performance!
"If it's not growing, market's not interested. If they start to get some visibility into sustainable growth in 2021 and beyond, maybe the stock can start moving in the right direction. It should be possible compared to 2020 numbers, but that also assumes no big market shock. With 5% growth to say 1.8 for 2021 and a modest multiple expansion, to say 10, this could be an 18 stock in early 2021. That's a lot of ifs for a relatively modest return though."
What's up with the pre-market dip of -6.65%?
"Seems oversold and very high volume could signal capitulation. This might go below $13 briefly, but HBI should be above $15 within a week...maybe $18 by end of year."
will someone explain to me why this stock continues to drop after repeated times of surpassing earnings. The stock looks good -
"This stock will come back, great buying opportunity at this price!"
"I have been picking up more shares as this has dropped - although the ~5 P/E is based on pre-virus estimates, relative to its peers and other stocks - that is just unbelievably cheap. I wonder what it is that I may be missing (the market does not see the same value that I’m seeing here) or maybe this is truly a case of the pendulum swinging too far the other direction? Assuming that things do not go terribly south with the virus/economy, I don’t see the dividend being cut. Management may choose to hold it steady for longer then I expected so that they can keep paying down more debt in this questionable environment, but I’m ok with that. My personal view about C9 (and all Hanes brands for that matter) being sold on amazon is that it could provide downside protection with this current “social distancing” mentality and its impact on retail."
"Impossible to call a bottom after years of going down but this looks really good at this price. Low F&TTM PE, boring but fairly predictable earnings reports and a decent(4%) and safe DIV. I guess only the 4B debt and a dropping overall market is keeping it down. CEO bought last week at 14.74 and few would know better when it reaches a buy range. Could easily be an 18.00 stock."
"An apparel company making a comebackHanesbrands was able to offset tumbling sales of innerwear and activewear during the worst of the pandemic in 2020 by spinning up a personal protective equipment business. The company depends heavily on brick-and-mortar retailers, so pandemic restrictions and consumers' shifting to e-commerce did Hanesbrands no favors.Things are now starting to look up for the apparel manufacturer, and the stock market has taken notice. The stock surged nearly 25% last Tuesday in reaction to a fourth-quarter report that checked all the boxes. U.S. innerwear sales soared 13% excluding PPE, and activewear sales were up 7% excluding the impact of business exits.Notably, Hanesbrands no longer sees PPE as a long-term growth opportunity. Instead, the company will focus on growing its thriving Champion brand, going after younger consumers, simplifying its portfolio of products, and building out a bigger e-commerce business.Hanesbrands stock has been trending downward for the past five years or so, and it would still need to rise another 50% to come close to its all-time high. The new strategy could deliver those gains, especially considering the beaten-down valuation. With analysts expecting adjusted earnings per share of $1.60 this year, Hanesbrands stock trades for just 11.5 times earnings.If Hanesbrands can successfully grow earnings and convince investors that there's a real long-term growth story, the stock could easily deliver market-beating returns. Now's the time to invest in this value stock on the rise.0"
Sold my 20k shares at avx 13.38. The vaccine will hurt HBIs bottom line. I got the dividend and made about 10k total on the trade. not bad for a day. I like HBI but there is def some downside here I'm not willing to weather.
Just dipped my toe into the water boys. This stock is too cheap!!!
"I’m also very surprised by how much this stock is getting beat up - is it concern over future earnings? Well that’s not being reflected in the analyst’s numbers (of course - we all know analysts are always wrong...) Is it concerns over potential slowing of Champion brand growth and waiting to see the full impact of the Target change? (Rob - I would not describe it as a Champion “decline” - the decline is only happening at Target.) Once again - not being reflected in future earnings numbers... The only real concern that I have is debt which they are actively working on. Will this get into a safe range before any potential future recession? What else is out there that I’m missing? I got shares last Dec and I have picked up some more shares today. The report this time last year was good and there was a nice pop - sold calls and buffered the drop that followed. I’ll do the same again if needed. At some point I think that others will see the value in this consistent performer. Are they going to have explosive growth - no, but they are consistent and there is value in that beyond what the current price is reflecting."
"Let's get this party started!!!Next stop, inevitable indeed, is the pivot point at $16.52.Happy New Year to all."
"Very nice quarter, beat estimates, raised guidance, and paid off some debt. Margins could’ve been better but I’m a happy shareholder!"
"Will be interesting after settling. Direct to customer sales up over 20% Champion up over 20%, Cotton prices going through the roof due to US heatwave which usually leads to over planting the next year makes this interesting a year or 2 out. Last time cotton popped Gildan was a better play due to growing distribution and Gold toe, this time it might be Hanesbrand."
"This stock is a screaming buy. At the end of the third quarter HBI had $400 million in cash. Pay off the accounts payable with the receivables.,take what is left over and add to cash and you get around $500 million. HBI has $2 billion in inventory. Take the $6.75 billion in sales and apply a 12.5 % operating margin. From that amount take out $240 million in interest expense. Then deduct 20% for taxes and you get $483 million. Take from the $483 million $216 paid in dividends and you get $267 million.Depreciation for the year is $132 million while PPE expenditures are around $80 million so add $52 million to the $267 million and you get over $300 million in free cash at the end of the day. That money will very quickly make an impact on debt balances.People don't put off buying underwear. The put off buying a new car or suit. Hanesbrands underwear is the best value for your money by far. I used to wear Jockey - what a ripoff that underwear is. Hanesbrands are manufacturing wizards. You can't beat them on cost. Champion is exploding. Everywhere I look there is someone wearing Champion clothing. Go to Footlocker, go to Macy's and see a section for Champion clothing. You never saw that before. This stock is a screaming buy. The debt load is easily manageable and underwear sales will come back strong. Insiders are buying the stock for good reason."
At this price… HBI officially will be on some companies radar as a possible takeover target
This trades like its an indebted discount airline with side businesses in amusement parks and oil drilling equipment.
"This stock will slowly churn higher as it has so many times in past years, the champion brand is selling well for men & ladies"
"I've held positions in HBI a few times prior, typically picking up shares in the $18-19 range and selling between $24-25. I'm typically a long term holder of stocks, but trading this has rewarded me well... Considering a new position, but I'mconcerned with the eroding profitability metrics. ROA = .90 (typically in the 8ish), ROE = 6.5 (typically 30+) and ROIC = 1.29 (typically 12ish). Huge erosion! Is this due to the one time repatriation tax hit or is there something else going on? Good luck HBI longs..."
Hope everyone got in on the dip. Moving on up!
Over 5% of the float shorted. Why would people be interested in shorting this thing? Seems like there are a lot more other opportunities out there...
"Long term investor, sold yesterday. Reason: not sure I understand how they built up $400M in PPE inventory (cash spent) to now write it off. Should have determined it was not a long term opportunity before spending the shareholders money on the inventory.... Left me skeptical they can tell what are good businesses versus not..."
Can’t decide between buying one share of their stock or getting a club pack of their T-shirts? Thoughts. I’m leaning toward buying the share.
While market has created a huge market for day traders and shorts. I hope this volatility slows down. Make 2k here then lose 3-4K next day
Should see a dividend announcement any day now. Hanes announced an increase the past 4 years in the 1st quarter therefore we should expect to see another increase this year. Last year's increase was a .05 / share increase.
"Let's hope Zacks apparent non-quant press is the beginning of the street touting the name. PE 11, growth forecasted by CEO, they own their own supply stream, 3% div while you wait, etc."
"I’d like to get some other’s perspectives on how this quarterly report will pan-out. I had my shares called away right before the last report (which worked out well), I then bought back in after the drop and just recently sold those after this latest run-up to $16. I’m now trying to decide what I want to do going into earnings again (I’m thinking about sitting on the sidelines). My hunch is that earnings will disappoint again (I use the “sales” prices on Amazon as my litmus test for this and both Champion and Hanes are heavily discounted right now), but I also wonder what the new CEO will have to say about the future since they have this study going on - that could provide a nice pop. Wanted to see what some of you other folks are planning to do..."
"This market baffles me (my comment is not specific to HBI since it is one of the few names which is not over valued). As a parent, I’m paying much more for child care because of the school schedule - I’m blessed to be in a position where I’m able to do this without negative impacts, but most families are not in that situation and so their spending on other things will need to be cut. My employer is spending more on PPE to protect us and obviously they were impacted by the virus and some of those impacts are still there so they will not make as much money. They have cut back on spending - specifically IT type spending so as some point I would expect that the tech companies will also feel this. Other than the extra money being dumped in the economy by the government - I don’t see why the markets are still rising and now at all time highs..."
"Another thing from the ER I found interesting. ""The company repurchased approximately 14.5 million shares in the first quarter and has suspended share repurchases for the remainder of the year. The average diluted shares outstanding for the first quarter were 359 million."" ---- 14.5 million shares retired in less than a qtr. They had to have been buying fast as the share price collapsed. Even if they got the shares for an average of 8.00 that would still be over half of their 200million dollar for the year buyback. I think they knew once they furloughed employees it would be a PR nightmare to continue the buyback so they bought aggressively before. Outstanding shares are at their lowest level ever since 2006.https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/HBI/hanesbrands/shares-outstanding"
Champion Instagram page is up to 4.9 million followers up from 4.2 million on Jan 1st of this year.

I don't see why they would hire this guy for a minute longer:https://www.journalnow.com/business/the-briefcase-hanesbrands-ceo-plans-to-serve-as-consultant-in-2021/article_007810e3-6a79-525a-96a2-148c923a11fc.html
Perhaps that $1 million inside buyer knew more than we did?
"I disagree. Good company with quality products at a reasonable price. One store does not sell 6 billion dollars of its sales. Their underwear was sold out at My local Sam’s Club and Walmart just before Christmas. In addition, they pay a great dividend!"
Now dividend is 5 percent.... solid cash on hand. Overweight /buy rating in my book .
Healthy dividend. Champion brand solid name I am still buying here
"The challenge with this company is over relying on Champion. This is like a company that survives on one large customer, until they don't"
cotton prices going lower. input costs falling . margins should improve.
"I'm up 17% in <2 months. About to lock down a divy, most likely with an increase of 8 to 10% over current div. Already got premium from an APR$18 sold put. Not too shabby!"
"Parnassus Endeavor Funds holds 11 mil shares as of 10/31. Here's what they write in their August report (may it be so): ""The company’s turnaround is gaining traction, with global athletic wear brand Champion growing double digits, and online revenue growing over 20%. Management also hosted its first analyst day in four years, where the team reaffirmed profit targets and committed to pay down debt. The event energized investors who stocked up on Hanes’s discounted shares."""
"I just bought shares At $19, with 3+% divy, sold a LEAP $15 put equal to 3x the dividend rate. Buy low, nobody here is going to stop wearing drawers, despite what the economy/market does. In fact consumer defensive does better in a down market."
Closed at $14.90 in After Hours Trading....if they beat their earnings as expected we may see $15.50 to $16 tomorrow￼
cotton prices down 38% since peak in June. margins should look great!!

"Underwear, inner wear, action wear , when the market is los8ng it’s shirts everyone will want new basic investments , sales , earnings and dividends !"
Have to think Nike's gamble on Capernick will help the Champion brand. It's already becoming hot with Gen Y all by itself.
"Hello HBI board...what happened today?no info from my normal feeds..nothing here on yahoo after hours.thanks,dan"
Looks like a another new 52 week low may be on the horizon. There seems to be a big disconnect between management and shareholders. Management is very happy and proud of the results the past 5 years. It doesn't appear shareholders have the same perception as management. Hopefully management will wake up and start focusing on shareholder value.
"Just bought in recently. I work with 12-14 year olds and Champion is a hot brand with that group right now. With a solid EPS low PE, and nice dividend this seems like a no brainer...."
"Champion now has more items listed on Urban Outfitters than any other brand with a 170 different items. Followed by Adidas with 168, and Nike with 162. Three months ago this was not the case. $URBN"
warren buffet should buy this company.
"Even after the 40% run, still massively undervalued according to Morningstar (fair value of $23 per share). Not sure about $23, but agree there's still a lot of room to run upward."
Is it the end of year loss of the Target contract what is holding this thing down? Growth seems healthy and the Champion brand is showing up at more and more specialty stores and department stores with greater floor space.
"There's just not a lot of good here and hasn't been for several years. Missing projected revenue estimate for next quarter by up to 160 MM is pretty terrible. I guess I'm not alone not guessing how hard lockdowns would hit Champion. Also, why would a ""business review"" on a midcap apparel company take ""several years"" not several days or weeks? I'm out; waiting for a dead cat bounce, permanent loss of capital. : ("
"We'll be poppin today. Very nice 1Q, 2018 looks good. I'd like to see a dividend increase announce, to show real shareholder support. They have the cash flow to make it happen."
"Lululemon is starting to look like an excellent short.Few reasons:1. Expensive valuation. Market Cap is more than the COMBINED value of $GPS $HBI $AEO EV/Sales > 62. limited growth prospects especially if they don't lower prices. Also seem like a Longshot for them to successfully launch in other product like shoes.3. At risk of becoming too 'cool and rich' for a public backlash it happen before think A&F, Victoria Secrets.4. Increasimg competition in the yoga space. Big brands like Nike are just now getting more serious about stealing lulu's customer. 5. Brands like ATHLETA are successfully growing as they concentrate marketing to all woman. They use models of all sizes, Lululemon uses just female models that under idk under 115lbs maybe, check Instagram. Isn't this the reason Victoria Secret is getting public shame over?6. International Growth won't be enough to keep premium valuation with any weakness domestically (North America).Go ahead please tell me I'm wrong, I don't follow Lulu very close but if it goes to $200 before $100 I'll be having a closer look."
I actually thought about wearing a pair on my face to work as a joke a few months ago. I didn't think then it was a good idea though.
"Shorty’s trying to create churn. Facts—HanesBrands (HBI) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.39 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.26 per share."
"HBI dropped about 19%, now it's back up about 2%. Old company with no record of reverse splits in it's past, well-known and trusted brand, making face masks, has a nice dividend. I should be able to sell when it climbs 10% from here and if that takes some time, did I mention it has a nice dividend?This fits with my simple strategy of ""Buy low and sell high"". I know, most of you chart freaks laugh, but my trades this year have me up by almost $45k!I try to find good stocks that have dropped 15-30%, seem to have more of an over-reaction than any real problem. They all have risks, so I don't put a huge amount in any single stock. Then I wait for them to recover about 10% at which point I try to keep my greed down and sell. Sometimes it takes a few days like with Tilray, Pitney Bowes, and Microvision. Other times it can take 100-200 days when having some dividend helps to ease the pain of waiting and worrying. GE and SDC are two of those."

Holding this stock for the past 5 years you would be losing money. That is not consistent performance by management. too much debt and not enough performance by all brands purchased. What happens if Champion stumbles? Risky stock.
So much to like in that report. Constant-currency organic sales increased slightly. Okay thats not great but sales did increase. The rest of the report was exactly what I wanted to see. Total International constant currency organic sales increased 10% in the fourth quarter and 12% for 2019. Net debt reduced to 2.9 times adjusted EBITDA with debt reduction of $460 million in 4Q (it ended 2018 with an EBITDA of 3.3). Expectations of $200 million in share repurchases in 2020.

What's wrong with a 4.07% dividend (easily covered) while waiting for much better earnings. The 10-year T note is paying .53%.
"After listening to the strategic plan, quarter results, and increased annual projections on the conference call, it's amazing the difference between the old management team and new management team. The new management team is action and results-oriented beginning to drive growth through innovation, marketing, and eliminating low-profit skews. The old Hanes management leadership believed in cost-cutting and acquisitions to generate free cash flow including very little marketing. They felt they didn't have to market their brands. They believed their brands were strong enough that everyone would just buy them, which is the ultimate mistake some large mature, stagnant companies make. It appears they have the right talent in place to accelerate product, revenue, and profit growth. I encourage everyone to listen to the conference call. Looking forward to the new future with the new management team! Good luck."
"You’ve heard the old saying “some people are great at giving advice but bad at taking it...Apparently I am one of those people...An old friend called last year about this time and asked for a few pointers on investing. I don’t like giving advice to friends because I have very few...However, I finally gave him about a dozen stocks that I thought that would recover from the market down turn...I never expected him to invest...he invested in all 12 equally...he just texted me and said the portfolio is up 75% from a year ago...HBI was in the group...Perhaps, I should have taken my own advice!"

Questions for long time Hanes Investors. Does anyone know why there is an 18% short interest in shares outstanding. This seems pretty high for a company that as far as I know has no controversies are any sign of impending doom. Then I see the price action this week. Wonder if someone wanting to buy out the company is pushing share priced down by shorting it so they can buy the company and buyback the shorted shares at a lower price.
I like the negativity on this board. Sounds like a good time to get in.
Champion was listed as one of the highest selling brands on Amazon this Christmas season. Longs have gotta like that.
Unusually high volume the last couple of days.......something is up
Finally great face masks:https://www.hanes.com/masks/shop-masks.html
Hbi will go higher and higher as we approach the holidays. Does every year for the past 20 years
"I am loving how HBI is running up to a brand new 52 week high right now, the day before earnings release. I think this looks like an OUTSTANDING Pure Earnings Short Sell play. I plan to go Short in a big way, lots of shares, late this afternoon, so please folks, keep up with the Irrational Exuberance, keep on pushing this up higher and higher all day long! Underwear For Life! :-)"
$17’s soon...
My teenage son and all his friends are starting to wear Champion instead of Adidas. I work at Disney and the sweatshirts they sell at Feature animation are champion brand. I want to buy some HBI! Has there been talk about cutting the dividend?
"The stock is jumping up in after hours. Any ideas? Lower support is at around $14.50. Their is no resistance above which could mean a major breakout is around the corner. Shorts may have finally decided they need to cover. A few months ago this was the most shorted stock in the S&P 500. With a new CEO on board, it would be great to head back to $30 plus although right now I would settle for $20 plus to start with. Good luck."
"They are projected to make $1.75 this year, and more next - all with positive cash flow & dividend. There is no reason for this to go any lower - oversold short term on the panic / stops getting triggered / maybe even margin calls.I say we level out around $19 - still a HUGE haircut from the $22 range it was at, but up from here."
"Glad to see the significant debt reduction, hope this continues. Looks like interest and dividends are well covered. Earnings disruptions from the new tax regime seem to be in the rear view..."
"This was the most informative conference call I have listened to from Hanes in 13 years. Listening to the conference call, in my opinion, they made the correct decision to hire Steve Bratspries. I would encourage you to listen to the conference call or read the transcript when it becomes available. He provided detailed information regarding the ""Full Potential Plan,"" It's obvious he has experience in operation efficiency, productivity, and brand management. He was very impressive in providing details on the future strategic plan which included reducing poor-performing SKU's, supply chain efficiency, improving product mix, marketing to the younger generation, and focusing on consumer wants and needs. It is obvious; he understands marketing and brand management. Hanes has many iconic brands, but it has to be what the consumer wants, at the right price, at the right time, when the consumer wants it which will be part of his strategy. It appears he is action-orientated verse talking the talk. He has brought in new talent to assist in executing strategy. They have formed 20 teams to focus on 20 strategic initiatives to fuel future growth through a cost-saving self-funded growth. He provided more details on the current business status and future growth strategies. He stated Hanes will provide additional detailed information regarding the strategic plan at the May investors conference. I'm looking forward to additional details! Good Luck!"

"This was the innovation I was hoping for ""Designed with HanesBrands’ innovative SmoothTec fabric technology, the collection offers ultra-thin fabric that makes the garments virtually invisible under clothing and delivers 360-degree stretch and recovery that allow garments to flex to fit women’s unique bodies, maintain their shape and eliminate ride-up. The addition of the company’s Cool Comfort technology means that the fabric also wicks moisture for added comfort."""
"Folks, if you want the dividend from HBI, the ex-div date is Nov 9th. Lots of investors get confused about ex-div date. If you want 15 Cents from HBI as dividend then you must hold by Nov 8th. The markets are closed on sat and Sun, which means you have to buy HBI today. I was lucky to get in yesterday @ 13 and I own 3447 on huge discount. I am a happy HBI investor and I wear Hanes brand clothing. Michael Jordan used to wear it too, just saying!!!!!"
I’m hoping the market overreacts to the GAAP numbers. This is a quality company with good margins and average growth. I’m adding on any pullbacks here!
"HanesBrands expects to launch sales of Hanes face masks to consumers online and in leading retail stores within the next several weeks. In addition, the company is supplying the U.S. government with more than 320 million reusable cloth face coverings and more than 20 million reusable long-sleeve medical gowns."
HBI UP OVER 5% today on impressive volume. Delivered over 320 million cloth face masks ahead of schedule; also announced contract today to make 20 million “reusable” hospital gowns for FEMA. Love this stock; am proud to own it. GLTA involved; stay safe.
HBI do not seem to be growing business fast enough for amount of debt. What happens if a perfect storm hits with a correcting market and sales / margin declines for HBI? This stock was just over $2.00 in 2009.
HBI has very little resistance on the charts before $30
"I believe JC Penny filing bankruptcy came at a good time for Hanes and shareholders. Unfortunately, it is not good for JC Penny shareholders or employees. Hanes has a large exposure of Brands in JC Penny. Due to the bankruptcy occurring at the same time as the pandemic, the lost sales and revenue can be ""camouflaged"" into what looks like will be a terrible quarter for most companies which everyone is expecting for the second quarter. Many stocks PPS have taken a hit including Hanes due to the pandemic which may be already built into the current share price. (Not saying I can't go much lower and also not saying it can't go much higher). Had the stock started to recover after the pandemic and JC Penny filed bankruptcy in the next year to two years during a ""potential PPS recovery the stock would have probably taken a fairly significant hit in PPS. That is why I believe it is good JC Penny filed for bankruptcy now verse in another year or two when the stock” might” be recovering. Unfortunately, the JC Penny bankruptcy is not a surprise and should not be a surprise to anyone. For the past two years, many analyst (and myself) anticipated they would file for bankruptcy in 2021 or 2022 when they had large debt coming due. The pandemic sped up the bankruptcy to sooner rather than later for the company. When Sears filed bankruptcy, Hanes took a $15 million hit to sales and a $5 million hit to profits in the fourth quarter of 2018. At the time, Sears had 700 stores open when they filled the bankruptcy. JC Penny currently has 850 stores open of which 200-250 will close under the current bankruptcy. I believe Hanes has more exposure of brands and product in JC Penny then they had at Sears. I'm curious as to how large of an impact this this will have on revenue and profits this quarter/year. As previously mentioned, I think the bankruptcy came a good time now during the pandemic verse in the next year or two during a “potential” stock price recovery. We should find out the impact on earnings and sales during the second quarter report. I’m also curious if Hanes has been constructing a plan for the lost revenue and profits. They have had at least two years to construct and implement and plan in anticipation of JC Penny filing bankruptcy. Good luck to everyone!"

"Why the stock is tanking today, 9/30? Any news?"
"Having a hard time deciding to pull the trigger on HBI and buy 4,500 shares... I always buy the same $ amount and kids laugh about it...two reasons why I do it...First I can immediately look at my investments as know exactly where I stand on each of them...Secondly, by investing the same $ amount it forces me to diversify my portfolio with the capital gains from each sale...HBI meets all of my basic criteria low PE ratio, Profits are covering dividends etc...Typically I don’t invest in consumable goods...Any thoughts?"
"Guidance is pretty weak, basically flat even with a bonus 53rd week/ 40 MM sales. A couple of years ago 2020 estimates were well > 2.00, now 1.60-1.68. Explains a lot. Still, it's profitable and you'd think at SOME point bad news is price in. Till then, bear market enters year 6."

PE around 8 and PS at 3.1 with a good dividend .... good value when the broad market is in recession ....if they continue to support and raise the dividend ...long term play through the next recession as investors and traders lose their shorts on the way down !
This stock seems significantly undervalued! Is this not a defensive stock??
"Yes, we're right in the sweet spot I'm looking for. Bought at $18, sold a Jan$18 put when it started rising. After no div increase, sold a $21Jul CC. Income from the puts/calls, as well as a 3%+ dividend. This is how you work 'stagnant' stocks without div increases. This ain't FB (before the fiasco), youre not going to get a big jump from a high debt textile co. with sub investment grade financials. Unless there's a takeover."
In @ $19.01!
Nice report. Upgrades will come and back over 20 we go.
Value investors will start showing up at this level.

"As an investor in Hanes (for the past decade) these are my personal opinions. After listening to the conference call each quarter for the past 10-12 quarters, unfortunately it seems the company is stale. Every quarterly conference call is the same with the same comments regarding the overall business results. ""We are very pleased with our results"". ""1-3% growth"".""Were well on our way to our achieving our annual goals""""Inner-wear sales continue to be soft as we planned""""Active-wear sales continue to outperform our expectations minus C9"".""Currency Headwinds""Challenging retail environment"" ""On pace to pay down debt""""On pace to achieve our mid to upper level guidance""""Input/raw material cost challenges""""Inventory challenges""While all this may be true (and some of it good) every quarter for the past 3 years, their does not seem to be an exciting vision with innovating product/plans to generate investor value or create excitement to drive investors to purchase more stock. There are many companies facing similar challenges however some of them are continuously changing and adapting in an attempt to say ahead of the competition and to increase shareholder value. Hanes has many well known great brands. Brand names carry a lot of weight however many of today's consumers are more quality, service and price conscious then they have been in the past. This type of consumer environment requires companies to innovate, adapt, and change in order to continuously achieve improving results and stay ahead of the competition weather it be brand or private label. Quarterly results continue to be ""ok"" but nothing to get excited about which results in the share price continuously declining. Lower Highs and lower lows. Unfortunately the stock is down over 50% the past 3 years while the stock market is up 50% over the same time period. The company has a good dividend yield but unfortunately that is the only excitement for shareholders over the past 3 years. A 3.5% - 5% dividend yield is good but gets lost when the share price is declining 10-20% per year. Favorite quote: Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different result. Strategic creativity, product innovation, marketing, and change are needed to improve results increasing shareholder excitement to drive the share price. As we have seen the past couple years, Champions explosive growth by its self is not increasing share price and getting investors excited. It will take other business segment to contribute substantial growth as well as Champion. Today's price decline could partially be contributed to the market being down 280 points however if investors were impressed with the results today then most likely the stock would not be down 6.5% today. Hopefully some short term investors were exiting today and the next few weeks will see an upside. There should be somewhat of an upside due to the dividend in the next couple weeks. Moving forward it appears there needs to be additional changes and improved overall performance from other business segments for the stock price to reverse the down trend. As a decade long investor, it would be good to see some changes and improved performance for all investors. Hanes did it from 2010 - 2016 and it would be great to see it again."
"Lordy, we're breaking out finally. I'm sitting firm in my Hanes now."
Is there a reason why this stock is down 6% lol?
The Triad Business Journal must not be HBI shareholders:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hanesbrands-leader-gerald-evans-recognized-125500410.html
"Great stocks, great company, great dividend."
I would just like to thank ESPN for the Michael Jordan Documentary that made me look into this stock when it was $10 a share. I only wish I hadn't sold half my stake at around $22 because I think the dividend is safe. If it gets below $17 again I think I'm going to buy some more though.
lots of negativity around this stock but one thing I've noticed.. hanes is one of the only brands you can currently walk in a store and buy. walmart and target carry it. the rest of the stores who carry the competition are closed for the foreseeable future.
"Time to load up on this one, Champion brand is going to crush this quarter."
Millions of PPE generated from HBI while making their staple brands adds up to a higher share price than is currently market price. HBI is selling at a discount.
"Unless you buy into shorting or manipulation conspiracies, today wasn’t about the quarter but about guidance. I think the ceo is all about turning this around and trimming fat. If the revenue is anticipated to fall short and cost reductions commensurate to that come with it then as a fundamental play, for me it works. The market is so much about having a 90 day attention span these days, the reaction is not entirely unexpected. I think the distribution is secure and a turn around is going to take multiple quarters. While you wait, you collect about 4% which is 8x’s what you’d get with a CD. The company has some good brands and direct to consumer will come eventually."
