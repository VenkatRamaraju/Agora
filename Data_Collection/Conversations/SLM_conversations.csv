"Was it a ""blow out"" quarter....um no, but it's in the right direction. I'd say at $12 the stock is fairly valued, but unlike all the other POS stocks i've been commenting on today, SLM has INCREASING revenue and profits. That is the underlying reason, as always in the long run, why that chart is going up from left to right. No financial engineering to prop up the shares yet."

"I bought SLM several months ago and currently have a 52 percent return since investment inception. At a PE of just 8.44 this name remains incredibly cheap. I fully expect a much higher price in the future. Take advantage while it's still cheap, if the past few months is any indication this stock will be a lot more expensive in the future than it is today."
