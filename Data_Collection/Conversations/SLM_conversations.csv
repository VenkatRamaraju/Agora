"I bought SLM several months ago and currently have a 52 percent return since investment inception. At a PE of just 8.44 this name remains incredibly cheap.

Take advantage while it's still cheap, if the past few months is any indication this stock will be a lot more expensive in the future than it is today."
Very overextended. Will either 1) Gap down tomorrow or 2) Consolidate and trail-off over next 7 days.
