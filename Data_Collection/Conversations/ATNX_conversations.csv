bought some avg 3.95 so happy enough with that as last time I bought I managed to have a sell order at 5.63 and it triggered
"As a younger investor, it’s a bit discouraging to see the way the markets seem to operate. Not even talking about this particular stock but the volatility in the market where it can do 3% one way in a day then 2% the other. I’m not an expert in any sense of the word, I’m trying to invest with my vision decades down the road but just the seeming instability is concerning. Anyone with a little more experience have insight as to their views of the market’s health at this time?"
This is where officers step up and show insider buying if you really have faith in this company do you understand that?
Good report and also meeting with FDA this is juicy
The Form 8k announcement to reserve 5million shares for insider compensation should reduce the Float enough to let this climb a bit higher.
"CEO bought today at $4.55. The day before earnings release. Hmmmm, very telling."
Mcduff!!! Where are you??? Are you still here???
"This is a very interesting stock.I think the future value of this company is very high.I think this stock is deliberately maintained at a low price by someone.A wise investor would now find the price really attractive.The stock, which was bought under $5, will make me rich in 10 years."
This will go back to $14 again and pass it need some time and green market
"I may have the lowest average cost of anyone in this room; $4,90"
Extremely Oversold... DCB expected to $5.8x soon
Good to finally see Corporate rebuttal to the shorting interest reports being noted. Fly by night shorting groups need to be reigned in. Should be a law against it.
"I am shocked how this company is undervalued. Unbelievable! They have an excellent drug pipeline (already approved and expanding), scientific articles published in high-impact journals. You can check in here by typing ""Athenex"": https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/search/advanced?cond=&term=&cntry=&state=&city=&dist= They almost built a pharma plant. The min price for this is $20-$30"

"A lot of investors will jump in today in anticipation for the 6th May. I predict a steady rise to 5.5p before the call, then a massive spike back up to 12p just after the call. Gg all"
Yahoo seems to be deleting good news posts on this stock. Go check the ATNX news release website. They have very good news on a phase 1 study they're doing.
My average is $5.34 can’t wait to see $14 or higher
Will truly continue to move up now this week is behind and over with. I'm really looking forward to coming weeks. Have a great weekend folks.
https://www.esmo.org/ atnx will be good? bad?
Having trouble seeing the silver lining here at this point.
"During the May CC and financial discussion, the Company said it had enough cash/equivalent to get to the 2nd half of 2022 ... does anyone know whether this estimate INCLUDED the $70mm payment for KUUR? (and where is that at this point, anyway?). Sales estimate given at that call was for a flat 2021. Not sure how much growth opportunity there is for 501 group products ... but they must have something in mind for this huge new facility? Everything else seems in early development stages and a long way and a lot of $$ from commercialization. Is a BO a possibility for ATNX?"

"Planning a CC before market open on Monday March 1st. To me, that is promising."
"Isn't the Russell rebalance happening tomorrow? If so, tomorrow could be a very interesting day."
More buying by insiders today...Kim Cambell reporr buying an additional 1750 shares.
I've been holding 350 shares since this stock went down. What a nice surprise this morning! Waiting for the short squeeze to kick in!
Over a million traded AH seems oddly high given the day's volume?
Management needs to come out and tell us what they will be doing to win over the FDA. Speak up and defend the company and its prospects.
Never sell look at the chart big day run. It was a set up run
We need to break and hold 5.15 to 5.20 and beyond then!
I bought at 3.73 yesterday....looks like I will make money on it today....that deal must be good for the shares to spike like that
Could it hit 8$ by Friday assuming positive Q1 results? I am bag holding since last 3 months
Chance to pick up another 50% potential rise in $SHIP. check BDI shipping rate breaking new high each day.
"When you believe this company as your investment and you should know investment is not gamble, it take time to growth, don’t play by day trader who use you money to make money by short, this is good potential company but small cap, we can make very significant return at least above 100% in months, if you can’t tolerate value going high up and down, you should not invest small cap, it will turns out very attractive return eventually if you take it easy, which I believe"
"Great day, yesterday! Today, we go to next stage, ¥7."
"Management needs to speak up and detail a plan, else more of the same as folks unwind positions in the face of major uncertainty. (Lesson to Johnson Lau - never use the word surprise on an earnings call. It shows you don't know what to do. Be ready for anything.)"
"well, that is just about the 52 week low ..."
"also let me add low float with over 50% institutional ownership and we have hit bottom, this company already has good revenue, already has an FDA approved product, has a ton more in the pipeline, oh and this approval is just delayed its not a no lol this is a SUPER BUY"
Love when they announce a lawsuit & price goes up. What a upside down world we are in!
"Good bye to pps growth. ATM for $100M in shares. Maybe for a new phase 3?Oh, and Randy Suzey the CFO who quit…is now hired as a special consultant to both athenex and axis. What a joke. Just hire a new cfo."
Earnings call August 5 should tell us a lot - and be the pivot point for a slow turnaround.
"Athenex to Acquire Kuur Therapeutics to Expand Cell Therapy Development with Off-the-Shelf Engineered CAR-NKT Platform GlobeNewswire ""Press Releases""Transformative, leading allogeneic NKT cell platform technology expands Athenexs cell therapy development capabilityPlatform has broad applications based on transducing NKT cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and T cell receptors (TCRs) to target hematological and solid cancers, respectively Total potential consideration of $185 million , comprising $70 million upfront primarily in Athenex common stock, and $115 million in development milestones"
"If Athenex didn't have any FDA approved drug then it would explain why this is at $4. However they have got an FDA approved drug... and are building a massive 400,000square foot production facility. They are clearly aiming to build a multi billion dollar company here. About 10 drugs in the pipeline, many are at stage 2, close to FDA approval. This one needs to be at $11 at current position."
"Financial and clinical update appears solid, nothing spectacular and nothing to disappoint.The next 6 months may prove interesting for us longs."
"Chris. It seems as retail investors, we are kept in the dark on an FDA decision until the Jack in the Box jumps out and gives us a yes or no. Its like waiting for the lotto numbers to be called out. Well, its not like that at all. Management is in the loop during the review process. Unfortunately, a company isn't required to reveal this info."" Strategic Information to protect the company"". A company paying a lot of dollars to file for this review, say Millions, is involved or has access to the progress of their application. Maybe ATNX got out gunned. Now, to reveal this info during the app. time period has almost always been kind of secret or don't let the neighbors know type of deal. Unfortunately, this will not change any time soon. To think that corporations that are making a lot of money with IV drugs and such see a new kid on the block with a better mouse trap, do feel threatened and could pull some strings? say a trip to the south sea's, Switzerland or Lichtenstein to check on your accounts...possible. Did it happen? Not in that loop but, with the very good phase III results with Oral Paclitaxel, was anybody making this decision actually thinking of the benefits to the patients this drug could serve? Not even on a humanitarian level to help someone survive a little bit longer? I don't think so. China, Europe are 2 areas they are in the process of gaining approval for O. They will get it, and this company will grow and expand its reach in cancer treatment. Unfortunately, here in the USA, we will have to wait to have access to this treatment. I don't have all the info the FDA has access to for this drug, but I hope they can live with that decision, like all the people who could have benefited from this drug have to live with this decision. Just the way it is."
This stock is a great ...company with lots of potential it should be trading 20.
"It's called a ""trading range"". Use it to your advantage until a catalyst emerges."
"I'll sell this stock for $30 a share.Before that, the company holds out even if it goes bankrupt."
"I must admit I am frustrated by the price action with this, and other, biotechs. Never ever is having a NEJM article a bad thing. It is without question the premier medical journal in the World and read by and referenced by the majority of all physicians. To have an article about your drug means to instantly have global recognition of its importance and its impact on the health of people. It means it is bordering on shoddy medicine to not know about or act upon such information on behalf of your patients. So, a NEJM article comes out about your drug, and in an otherwise boring news day, your stock goes down?What?"
Going back up $14 soon
"Earnings are good. By the end of May they'll apply for FDA meeting. By the end of the next quarter (30th of June) they plan to actually have this meeting. Both events will boost the price. It's not going up to 12 in mid-term but up to 6 probably yes. The healthiest sign would be slow recovering. So, let's hope, 4.30 is the new bottom."
"One would hope that ANY intelligent person on the Board of this Company if there is one, would see the stock price movement and realize that until ATNX is sold as a viable up and coming Pharma Co to the Market, that the loyal shareholders of this stock will continue to see shorting interests control the price or possible someone with an agenda against this Co. No Company in my 35 yrs of investing has seen this kind of playing and manipulation of the shareholder value as ATNX shows. Yet the Chairman and the rest of the Board are complicit in the lack of any caring for the shareholders. They got their money and have shown time and time again they don't give a hoot about shareholders. Where are the non-deal roadshows to sell yourself to the Analysts? Where are the general Presentations to the markets of the ongoing Company? We get a Press Release here and there yet with no back up support and again the stock price drops. The handling of the latest FDA filing was just another example that showed that this Board and especially this So-called Chairman obviously didn't have enough faith in their product to bang the drums on its filing. That's how the Market takes it and can only believe uncertainty on the part of Mngt exists. Instead we hear crickets. Possibly the biggest day in this Company's history and we hear squat about it over the news wire. This is complete mismanagement of shareholders money and trust. I know the Chairman couldn't care less about someone like me spouting off about his complete lack of understanding as to how to run an American Co. The street sees this as a Chinese driven one and that is not widely accepted especially now. I could only imagine where our stock price would be with a real Board running it and not lemmings. Shame, so much potential, yet the Village Idiot can't or won't read the tea leaves. So now we wait and hold on to a losing biz until at least end of the first qrtr 2021. Where are the Institutional Shareholders?"
Impressive pipe line with large percentage of insider ownership. Major over reaction. I’m in for 6000 shares.
Its obvious where Mapan is at right now...... He tried but like his short It didnt work!
This stock is setting a great base. Any good news and this stock will go up quick
I don't understand what is going on here ... Didn't investors listen to webcast
Good to see uptick and positive volume on another bad day in market. Going to have a beer!!
"Bill, this is a much better investment at $4 than it was at $14 and there is plenty to look forward to. Nobody builds a $400m manufacturing facility unless they know their prospects are promising."
there is probably one hedge fund manager bringing the price down all day and gobbling up shares at end of day. there is always huge buy at 4:00pm here.
"Hmmm, 2 days in a row of large end of day buys. Next week could be interesting."
"Anyone have experience with this company? Is this a big thing for the company? Kuur Therapeutics For $70M Cash, $115M Milestone Payments"
Mapan is hiding right now
"Negative FDA decision. Seems like an overreaction, as the company can always do a new study and file a new report. The FDA did not find that the drug did not work. They only found that they have some questions regarding safety and felt that the initial study had some statistical flaws. The FDA wants a new study, and a new study they will get. Search wikipedia for Paclitaxel. The intravenous version has been in use for a long time. Athenex is working on an oral version."
Any positive announcement from the bod will send this one flying high. $12 price target on this one
"can we see a push for EU, if yes then back to 10."
Any comments on the liquid cyclophosphamide deal? I wonder how these sorts of deals may increase earnings reports going forward. We focus on the major developments but “behind the scenes” the business model is also advancing.Thoughts?
it really seems as if this will rise with any positive news. SP was very stable at 12
Real Shareholders if you EVER want to know who someone really is click their name and see their previous posts. You will know if they are a shareholder or a paid basher Its easy

I think its the whole market selling off. A lot of Investors lost money when they announced the FDA Status during pre market. Biden is going to crash this market.
No one needs Steve. It’s like reading the public toilet stall wall. Jeez. We need news and updates from Lau and co.
it is dead definitely?
It will go up as soon as you sell.
we should see $5 Monday. Today is very good day all.
$1+ bounce eminent
Well guys how do you think earnings will be??? positive on SP or negative??

I just bought shares of this company. I think its really undervalued right now and i expect it to grow like crazy. Simplywallst showing its stock price 92% under its fair value. I did some due diligence and found that in the past 12 months insiders bought 2.3 million worth of shares and didnt sold a single share. I hope we reach 175 stock price soon as mentioned in simplywall.st. GLTA.
has anyone checked in on Mapen? Im worried
"I guess is very clear now, the market maker is making money in marginal range between high $5.20 and low $4.50 Well, shall start sell half of my position at the high and rebuy at the low, guarantee $0.70 every 3 days is great  and repeat "
on to the $4 
here my price targets 6.30 . 7.94 than 9.25. hourly and 4 hours charts starting to turn bullish guys good luck
"Shorts are covering, it wont be long till this is back up to $6 then $10 then $15. Back to where we originally were"
News of requesting a FDA A meeting should come this week. And then hopefully we are back to 5+.
Updated company presentation posted on Athenex's investor relations website covering all of their technologies...https://ir.athenex.com/static-files/cad334b3-c5c7-407c-8565-b0e6b8946f02
Well guys...worth buying yet or is it going to drop further?? not sure on cash on hand or up coming news flow but share price under $4 is tempting on a historical chart basis
I don't get it. should be up on this recent news

well I have to thanks who sold shares 4.57 lol bought my first 1000 shares and I will buy more if it goes lower
"This is at least an $8 stock. Whether it fluctuates up or down doesn't matter. If you wait, you'll get paid."
I appreciate the opportunity to add under 12We all know this stock can move both ways with or without news.Long term the value is now greater. Period.
"athenex with Obamacare,It will go up to 30 dollars."
"let's see do I want to go in for IV treatment or take a pill with less side effects and better adherence and more even dosing release than a toxic shock from IV. Let's see if I am an insurance company what would I want? let's get real and recognize that this improves peoples lives, I have seen cancer IV treatment before and it is not a pleasant experience. Hoping for new highs and quick approval to get in the hands of patients who suffer."
Why isn’t IR or public affairs sharing any information? Who is in PR and how much are they paid?How about updates on FDA and new phase 3 trials?How about updates on Kurr acquisition and integration?How about updates on klyresi sales efforts and results?How about updates on a CFO search?How about an update on Lau’s boil?
"Mcduff... I am bull until final approval, but due to the complex administration schedule (10-12 pills along with long fasting), I am unsure how much oraxol will invade iv market once approved. May I ask your exit plan? Will you wait until a big pharma buys out or the market cap goes up (maybe to 5-10B)?"
ATNX just picked up another revenue stream and thus increasingly derisked as a commercial stage biotech.
"Atnx has FDA approval for a skin cancer ointment. Summer is incoming, everyone will be out. Millions will need skin treatments. Think about how undervalued this is. This should be at 10p just with that. With a further plan soon to be announced about how Atnx will gain an additional breast cancer drug FDA, this should send this flying to 15p on hype. Once FDA approval is granted (in around 6 months) i expect 30p here"
Sigh. This could be headed back to new lows now.

Regardless of today's market reaction the data are solid. This has the potential to compete with the Abraxane franchise which was bought by Celgene for 2.9 bn in 2010. Just to give an idea of the magnitude.Future trials comparing oral paclitaxel vs. Abraxane will be highly relevant...

"So, the price is down almost 10% today and is below its IPO price; did one of its institutional investors dump a big portion of their holdings? All the clinical trials look good; can anyone decipher what is going on? Thank you."
"just got in, hopeful for the future, plan on holding for 1-2 years"
Bought 4600 at 5.29 and glad I didn’t panic lol staying long and strong on this one
"Don't underestimate the value of Klisyri, and notice that they estimate sales next year to equal those of this year WITHOUT the license royalties from sale of K. Those could prove to be substantial. AK affects millions of Americans, let alone the rest of the world. This is still a good Company to own and shares will rebound as well from this setback - similar to ZSAN. Take a look at that chart for a morale boost."
Very good news. This was presented at ASGCT on 05/14. very promising. This stock is gonna to the roof on monday.https://www.onclive.com/view/car-nkt-cell-therapy-can-induce-complete-remissions-in-pediatric-neuroblastoma
What happened to Mapan?
"I’m a little confused here. Company clearly stated they would have a CC at 8am to discuss results. Therefore, if these trades are based upon real information then that is illegal insider trading, pure and simple. It doesn’t matter what the FDA does with other companies, and certainly ATNX already knows result...but again...8am and no official news otherwise.People placing bets here I guess."
What a bargain! In at 5.76
Finally it is alive anyway let us march to 6 plus by Friday
Im really worried about Mapan. He would be here on a day like today.
I’ll buy in at 3 next week or 2 depends how risky am feeling. Then leave till I hear the good news from FDA. If you selling now you’re going to regret it. Hold!
GREAT NEWS FOR ATNX!!!! Wow
"Hopefully today After Hours we will hear about the FDA approval! Stock will skyrocket, it been highly undervalued right now."
"Up 20% in premarket to down 20% 18 minutes into the trading day. Wow. Haven't seen this level of manipulation in, like, ever."
This is a radicicolous valuation for a CAR technology company. It is trading at major discount to similiar companies with less revenue. The expanded pipeline from the Kuur acquisition and the activity around the Type A meeting with the FDA could generate headlines that could drive significant upside. There is no risk reward being short this name. It is worth being long only for a speculative pop. I am pretty sure we will have some very serious rallies in the very near future and I am positioned to take advantage of them.
"Could someone explain why MRTX (Mirati Therapeutics) in ""clinical stage"" with 0 drug approved, spends 382 M with a 369 loss and 13 M revenue has a share price at 169 a pop...!? When ATNX has 220 M in the bank, makes 100M, has at least one good drug approved and has a share price at 4.0 and both are in the oncology business....!?"

What is up with this stock?!?! Just dropping off steadily over the last few months...
Back on the rise

"BUFFALO, N.Y., Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Athenex (ATNX), a global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies for the treatment of cancer and related conditions, today announced that the Phase II clinical study data for KX2-391 for the treatment of actinic keratosis was presented by Dr. Seth Forman of Forward Clinical Trials, Tampa, at the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting on February 17, 2018 in San Diego, California (abstract ID 6134)."
"Acein, I believe that given the choice of having an IV or taking pills with less neuropathy that patients will make the clear choice especially with the results of the Trials showing greater benefits. That and the combo trials being done with other Pharma giving further potential options for usage of oraxol gives me pause about selling out quickly upon approval by end of February being honest. They have a stable of others in trials which I feel makes them, if both approvals come through for oraxol and the ointment, a prime target for takeover, which I feel would be positive for their Investors as this Sr Board Mngt is very lacking in running this Company. The Street has absolutely no faith in backing this Chairman which is seen played out everyday for the past 3 yrs in the stock. I want to see him gone but since that won't happen we need to see a sale. They do seem to now have a Plan about getting the stage set for oraxol in spite of him. I think we will need to show acceptance by the medical groups out there first before any chance of a buyout but if it is accepted as it should be based on the Trials, I would expect to have to hold until after 2nd qrtr in 2021 results are given for the juices to flow for anyone to take them over. Do I think the shareprice will take a spike up upon approvals, you bet, but the real brass ring would be with a sale. After being here since the IPO, I am willing to wait for that especially if we do see my anticipated spike upon approval. $13 average for me so not hurting much here so can wait. Good luck with your investment."

"Yes, but for some reason the last Q report specifically states that their guidance for this next Q (or was it year?) does NOT include sales of Klysiri? Wonder why?"
"Klisyri is a novel topical, best-in-class microtubule inhibitor indicated for the topical treatment of actinic keratosis of the face or scar. In two Phase III clinical trials, Klisyri demonstrated both efficacy and a favorable side profile. The short treatment protocol is unique as Klisyri requires once-daily application for only five days. These demonstrated efficacy and safety profile positions Klisyri as a compelling new treatment option for patients with actinic keratosis, the second most common condition by dermatologists in the United States. Athenex has another 60 products in the pipeline and plans to work with the FDA to fix the problems just experienced with its latest drug (so just a temporary set back here). Overall Revenue for Athenex is up by more than 30% in 2020. Looks like a nice opportunity to me!"
"Well, not sure if 180k shares in three separate purchases constitutes a ""big rally"" but it's better than being poked in the eye with a stick. Slowly but surely, this is coming back. Still a good time to buy."
"I read the press release and I do not see it as failure. Read the whole thing. I see it as Athenex has some more work to do but there are significant advantages of the oral formulation can be easily dismissed by the FDA. The developers of an oral formulation of paclitaxel will have to revisit efficacy and safety data in order to provide sufficient evidence for FDA approval.A complete response letter (CRL) was issued by the FDA to Athenex, Inc. for the company’s new drug application (NDA) for a novel formulation of paclitaxel that allows for oral administration in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.1The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date for this application was originally set for February 28, 2021.The agency indicated that there are concerns regarding safety of the drug due to high rates of neutropenia-related sequalae with the oral formulation versus its intravenous counterpart. Issuance of a CLR is indicative of the end of the application’s review cycle as the FDA does not believe it can be approved in its present form.“Our clinical and regulatory teams are disappointed by the complete response letter,” Rudolf Kwan, MBBS, chief medical officer of Athenex, said in a press release. “We plan to work with the agency to resolve the issues raised in the CRL and to obtain approval for oral paclitaxel plus encequidar in metastatic breast cancer.”According to the FDA, there were also concerns about the results of the primary end point of objective response rate (ORR) at 19 weeks by blinded independent central review (BICR) in the supporting clinical trial. BICR reconciliation and re-read process may have allowed for unmeasured bias to influence these results.To compensate for the current weaknesses in the application, the FDA recommended that Athenex conduct a new clinical trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer, adding that risk-mitigation strategies–such as dose optimization or exclusion of patients considered to be at high risk of toxicities–be implemented to improve the safety profile.The NDA was initially supported by data from the randomized, multinational phase 3 KX-ORAX-001study (NCT02594371), which evaluated oral paclitaxel plus encequidar versus intravenous (IV) paclitaxel in women with metastatic breast cancer.2 Results from this study were presented in December 2019 at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). Updated progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) analyses comprising an additional 14 additional months of follow-up data were presented in December 2020 at SABCS.3,4In the study, participants were randomized 2:1 to receive either oral paclitaxel at a dose of 205 mg/m2 and encequidar at a dose of 15 mg for 3 consecutive days per week for 3 weeks or IV paclitaxel at a dose of 175 mg/m2 over 3-hour infusion periods every 3 weeks. Treatment continued until disease progression or toxicity.A total of 402 patients were enrolled in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, including 265 in the combination arm and 137 in the IV paclitaxel arm, of whom 399 received treatment. Investigators also evaluated a modified ITT patient population (mITT; N = 360), in which participants received at least 7 days of oral paclitaxel plus encequidar (n = 235) or 1 dose of IV paclitaxel (n = 125).The dual primary end points of the study were confirmed tumor response per blinded independent central review (BICR) among the mITT population on 2 consecutive evaluations as well as safety and tolerability. Key secondary end points included duration of response, PFS, and OS.In the mITT population, the combination of oral paclitaxel and encequidar met the study’s primary end point of a superior radiologic response rate at the dose and schedule approved for patients with metastatic breast cancer. The centrally confirmed overall response rate increased from 25.6% with IV paclitaxel to 40.4% with oral paclitaxel and encequidar (P = .005).Among those treated with oral paclitaxel and encequidar in the ITT population at the updated analysis, the median PFS was 8.4 months compared with 7.4 months for those treated with IV paclitaxel (HR, 0.768; 95% CI, 0.584-1.010; P = .046). Moreover, patients in the oral paclitaxel and encequidar arm had a median OS of 22.7 months versus 16.5 months in the IV paclitaxel arm (HR, 0.794; 95% CI, 0.607-1.037; P = .082). Survival results were similar in the mITT population.Regarding safety, combination treatment with oral paclitaxel and encequidar was found to be associated with a lower incidence of neuropathy and alopecia, but a higher incidence of low-grade gastrointestinal adverse events compared with IV paclitaxel.Ultimately, the investigators indicated the study findings suggest oral paclitaxel plus encequidar provides an important oral therapeutic option for patients with metastatic breast cancer.“We remain committed to the breast cancer community and will explore the best path forward to obtain..."

A company that has existed for years and is now trading lower then covid lowpoint. Minor setback for fda approval of 1 drug yet the company has others already approved. I don't see the company leaving anytime soon. See short and longterm appeal
CEO and a few Chairmans all bought quite a bit of shares around $14 range. Something must be good coming.
insider just purchased 50k shares. you know wat that means.
ATNX's FDA approved drug treats the 2nd most diagnosed skin issue in America.... atnx cures it in 5 days.... competitors drug takes around 2months to cure.... massive massive massive. Atnx should be getting bulk orders for this one in the summer. $11 inbound by next friday

"I think we may be overlooking or at least underestimating the potential impact of the new manufacturing facility expected to go online in Q4. The 503 B market is significant (several $B) and CAGR expected growth is 8% through 2027. Dr. Lau mentioned 8 shipping bays becoming active, I believe. A lot of product will be shipped from this facility and the revenue from it should grow steadily, and help fund the ongoing development of various drugs and therapies in or soon to be in trials. Yes, this is a longer term play but will have periodic spurts on ""good news"" IMO without having to dilute significantly."
Guys should I sell it if it hits 8 or 9? I bought it around 5.2. Not sure if I should aim for quick money or will it reach price target of 15 as per some of the trends?
are you kidding me a market cap of only $1 billion. No foreseeable dilution to raise funds. A game changing delivery system for chemo therapy that improves outcomes and quality of life. manufacturing capacity ready to go. pipeline of revenue. if i had more money i would buy more

The updated trial data was to be presented at the ASGCT Friday. I would have hoped for a post-4pm PR with that info. Anyone here a ASGCT member who can register online for the info ( membership cost $300). Maybe the end-of-day sell-off was related to the ATNX conference presentation. Hopefully not. But waiting for a company PR. Absence of same perhaps not a good sign.
Patience is a great advice here
"Paclitaxel IV is sometimes used on a different schedule from the one tested in the clinical trial, and it seems to be superior, which may explain some of the selloff. The oral regimen also requires 11 capsules be taken per dose."

"Some biopharma company have zero dollar revenue, this company have 20more millions revenue..... "
Ok Longssss What are the resistance levels you see??
"This is a great company out of Buffalo NY. Well known in the town. This company has a novel drug (first ever) called Klisyri just approved by FDA and starting to sell in early 2021. And has other robust drugs in the pipeline with FDA approval pending near term. Klisyri is a 5-day cream that helps resolve pre-cancerous lesions, commonly caused by indoor tanning and sun. Read up about it, but this highly effective cream will save millions of lives. The company is ""net cash minus debt"" (positive) with a current ratio of over 4 (so plenty of working capital to carry it over several years, and just solidified a large credit arrangement with a financial institution (refer to 8K), so balance sheet look pretty. Look at insiders report over last 6 months: 20 purchases for over $2 million and no sells. What I like about this company is that they just got FDA approval, consistent revenue growth over the last four years and just got their first novel drug approved by FDA. They also just established a partnership to sell and distribute the cream to doctors in the US. Only around $11 per share! 1y Target Est $27.41. My belief is that this is an undervalued stock because analysts are overlooking it due to its small size."
"SEC FROM FILLED: $ATNX no placing news in the vote which is great news, no dilution needed. $220million in the bank, and more revenues to be generated from increased production of FDA approved Klisyri (turbanibulin) from the new 400,000 foot facility. Big rerate tomorrow."
"Wow. What a mess!! while the company valuation is cheap, cash burn is out of control. The the CFO has departed for whatever reason while the company is in dire need to raise more cash. Most to all new drugs are in early testing and will not produce revenue for quite some time while requiring significant cash investment. This mess will require quite some time to sort out. The oral paclitaxel debacle with the FDA raises some real concerns regarding management ability. I think more management shakeouts are in the works. For me it means it is not quite the time to be in the stock for sometime."
Slow steady accumulation this stock is headed in the right direction
Slowly moving up then suddenly one morning we get up and fly to moooooon.
Its important to note that a company director bought over 8000 shares on the 5th April. This is a good indication of where the company thinks they are heading in terms of share price. Up up up. A rerate will come here soon imo
"Good CC, I thought. A lot of irons in the fire and candidate products seem to be nicely on track. There's a lot of binary outcomes in biotech, so a lot of risk. But I'd say this company has an excellent platform of opportunities. Would like to see a little better share performance!"
"this company already has good revenue, already has an FDA approved product, has a ton more in the pipeline, oh and this approval is just delayed its not a no lol this is a SUPER BUY"
slow and steady
600 shares @ 5.25....Thoughts?
"We flying back to $6, shorts haven't even done their research on this company"
"Directors said they are still confident in their initial trial. This was said on the conference call, for all those who missed this massive piece of news. The only way is up from here, and smart money is buying up shares at this record low level"

"From clinical trial enrollment Q1 2022 to FDA submission: 18 months plus FDA review 6 months = 24 months. It could be a good idea to set up (now) a Compassionate Use Program and gather data through that as well. In 24 months: Class Action is dismissed, the insurance settles with some investors and the skies clear up. In the interval: new technologies come forward, the pipeline matures and some sales maintain the company afloat. But the question is: How much cash will it take to conduct this 2 year-journey? If this path is clear until then, with a decent amount of PR (around scientific meetings), we should be rewarded."
Week after week no news.
This would be a great stock for the Reddit WallStreetBets folks. Company trying to get pharmaceutical products to market that saves lives and it has a huge Short position.
Just look at their pipeline and the fact that they are growing with good revenue. Insiders have invested millions in December of 2020. This is a goldmine at this price. If it drops I will buy more!!

@Mapan got this one wrong. Here it is trading above 5.

"These lawsuits do not affect the company since it's the Officers' insurance which is involved in these cases. Furthermore, most of these suits end up dismissed by the courts unless there was a deliberate falsification or illegal activity. The issue is that they go on for 3 or 4 years before dismissal. Then, possibly, a settlement, that's when the insurance comes in. From that local newspaper article, the FDA meeting was apparently a good one..."

Don’t sell yet...wait...earnings around Feb 5 or 8; pdufa on or before Feb 28. Earnings report should include updates on the ointment rollout and the China partnerships. And don’t forget they have an existing pharmacy that already sells a range of products; it just doesn’t receive much air time.

Dilution time.
"2020 annual revenue $144M. 2021 revenue also would be around $144M per management said in Q4 call and this doesn't include Klisyri revenue. This annual revenue without Klisyri is worth of $400M$224M in Cash and Investments$150M in DebtKlisyri alone is worth of $700M assuming $100M revenue per year and FDA approved. Not easy to get the FDA approval. Takes many years of pain and cost.Without Paclitexel, the enterprise value looks too be around $400+Net Cash $84M + $700M = $1184M which comes around $13 per share currently. This biotech is way too cheap at this price."
"This is copied directly from their last Q report and is guidance for 2021: In terms of product sales guidance, the Company is limiting financial guidance to only the existing product portfolio, which excludes any proprietary products, until meaningful sales data from the proprietary product Klisyri becomes available. In 2020, the Company recorded a significant amount of revenues from international customers as a result of the global pandemic. However, the Company does not see these revenues as recurring in nature, while it has been continuing to expand its product portfolio. The Company currently expects its product sales in 2021, excluding any royalties from Klisyri, to be in line with 2020 levels.Can anyone comment intelligently on the ""significant revenue from international customers as a result of the global pandemic"" .... which will not recur in 2021 ... ie why don't they expect this to recur, at least in part?Also, why would they NOT include ANY revenue expectation from Klisyri in 2021 when logically there will be sales and royalties from it this year?"
"my option up 50% today haha, if we see another 0.50 up tomorrow, I am heading to buy a new car."
"Regarding filing of the NDA this is the relevant bit of information:Company Press Release on January 16, 2018: “the FDA indicated that if the study meets the primary endpoint with an acceptable Benefit/Risk profile, it could be adequate as a single comparative trial to support registration of Oraxol for a metastatic breast cancer indication in the United States”"
"@ ahawk I think you mean ""with Klisyri"" below, but you are spot on. Frankly, we should have taken the clue given when the stock didn't have that normal ""run up to FDA"" week prior to decision day. This is now simply a ""longer investment"" but now, perhaps more than ever, a good one."
"Sentiment will change soon, as investors start to realise that the FDA didn't outright decline the drug, but simply asked ATNX to tweak the toxicity levels to reduce the effects on patients white blood cells count. I expect these tweaks will take less than a month to make and a further 5 months to test on patients to gain the FDA approval. Once this gets approved expect $20+ per share at a minimum. Lets not forget about the other 10+ products in the pipeline. Plenty of good news to come. I'm adding to my holding. Good luck all"
Slow rise and steady. Good.
No doubt another 52 weeks low is coming
"3 separate hedge funds bought up millions of shares worth of ATNX in the $11 range leading up to FDA decision. Insiders bought heavily as well. I would watch SEC filings very closely over the next week to see if insiders or hedge funds take advantage of this dip. Back in March, insiders bought heavy on Covid dip. One insider purchase in this range would be a great catalyst. Holding tight!!"
"News release: ""Under the terms of the arrangement with Dr. Lau, as approved by the board of directors (the “Board”) of the Company, Dr. Lau has elected toreduce his base salary for the remainder of fiscal 2020 to $40,000 and to receive in exchange for his remaining base salary, a stock option to purchase55,045 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $7.32 per share (the “Option”) pursuant to the Company’s 2017 OmnibusIncentive Plan.

"Small and medium sell, small investors are cashing at the entry point ???"
"No retrial needed here, FDA just require more data to approve the breast cancer drug. Shorts are having their short term fun. This will run way past $10 once more data is presented to the FDA and a potential approval comes to fruition. ATNX had cash on hand to operate till 2022"
for those who laughted at me when i bought 40000 shares since than i added additional 20000 shares total of 60 k shares at cost of 4.12 still wont sell at 5 or 5.50 i am looking at 10 or better before i even think about selling
Need some positive PR

"The selloff is accelerated by the report that director Jinn Wu sold 98,000 shares at 4.75 on 3/3/21. Way to go Wu. Bought at above 11 and sold at 3.75. As they say buy high sell low."
This continued drop isn't just completely from the FDA decision. Look at what is happening to other biotechs right now.
