YTD comparison chart vs S&P500 and Nasdaq just brutal for this company.

lowest price target is 25 a share. average is 28. there has also been significant insider buying over the last few months among leadership. Also all buy ratings and no sell. this is headed back to 20 in the next month
Its a shame what has happened since the takeover of DNB. Lack of competent top management.
i bought 2 shares just to see how performs
I bought DNB 10 years ago and made some money when they exited the public market. I can't remember why they left and I don't know why they came back.

A dog with fleas...The market is up 20% from the IPO and the stock is down 20%. The leadership needs overhauled.
I heard about DNB the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
steady rise from here :)
"Guys, avoid IPOs of traditional companies like DNB and ACI. They never perform well because private equity vultures are behind them who will cash out most of the funds raised and they already have excessive overpriced book values. Focus on young nascent companies in biotech, tech, and green energy."
#DNB in action. Buy rating: 6.5 at 9trading. A break of 146.4 could move it up to 182.3.
"The Market continues to go up, this stock is in the toilet and swirling around the bowl..."
"This company is seen as a stalworth in the financial world. Good times or bad times the banks used a payday score to make key decisions. If they come out with a better solutions for faster credit decisions, DNB could be an option for smaller companies looking to sell product. Credit capacity has grown within the market, and this could be a large player."
"When the company was taken private, I think the market cap was around 6 B. Now, that the company is once again, public, the market cap is around 10b. But the annual revenues then, and now, are still around 1.7 bill usd. Value, is a subjective notion - what you think something is worth, may not be what another thinks it is worth. But whether value is increasing or not, may be objectively determined. Revenues/profits on an annual basis seem to be unchanged. Unless there are massive share buybacks on the horizon, is value per share increasing ? Also note that the majority of the shares are not being traded, held by insiders, who may be waiting for higher prices, to ""unload"".
