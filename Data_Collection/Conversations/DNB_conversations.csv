Almost flat since started their IPO. Will hold longer and see.
bought @ 24 and hoping to see some midterm lift here-starting to see it
I like sneaking into names like this one while everyone is focussing on the hot trades like AMC. This is a nice business at a reasonable price. Insiders think so as they bought shares with their own money!
Buying more!
I heard about DNB the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
I was expecting so movement by now!!! I will hold for a few more months.

Avention OneSource was a solid acquisition by Dun & Bradstreet. This will create a nice revenue stream for the future DNB stock price.
"while the market rises, this stock sinks.....The the executives are just sucking the life out of this company."
Just bought a little at open.

Equifax and Trans Union way out performing. What is D&B doing to impress stockholders?
This will be 15.00 in a month Pure Fraudulent ipo
"Not a lot has changed at DNB as far as their Rube Goldberg Contraption of data collection. The ""product offerings"" are still indecipherable. The leadership, of course, has been totally flushed out from what it was just 3 years ago. But, the good news is and always has been, people need data (e.g. PAYDEX etc) to make business decisions and the DUNS Number isn't going anywhere. Hope their primary focus is the US this time. All IMHO."

Its a shame what has happened since the takeover of DNB. Lack of competent top management.

"$DNB Jabbour Anthony M, Chief Executive Officer of Dun & Bradstreet Holdings, Inc. bought 200000 shares on 2020-07-02. https://formwhispers.com/s?t=DNB"
"When the company was taken private, I think the market cap was around 6 B. Now, that the company is once again, public, the market cap is around 10b. But the annual revenues then, and now, are still around 1.7 bill usd. Value, is a subjective notion - what you think something is worth, may not be what another thinks it is worth. But whether value is increasing or not, may be objectively determined. Revenues/profits on an annual basis seem to be unchanged. Unless there are massive share buybacks on the horizon, is value per share increasing ? Also note that the majority of the shares are not being traded, held by insiders, who may be waiting for higher prices, to ""unload"". Who knows what lurks in the hears of men - The Shadow (Alec Baldwin) ?"
Looks like there’s some new management I have too much of this stock to take a loss on it.
I am still adding!!! **fingers crossed**
"This company is seen as a stalworth in the financial world. Good times or bad times the banks used a payday score to make key decisions. If they come out with a better solutions for faster credit decisions, DNB could be an option for smaller companies looking to sell product. Credit capacity has grown within the market, and this could be a large player."

Above 26 today!
The Market is up today 1.3% over 400 points and D&B Stock is down....
More insider buying with their own money!
"Guys, avoid IPOs of traditional companies like DNB and ACI. They never perform well because private equity vultures are behind them who will cash out most of the funds raised and they already have excessive overpriced book values. Focus on young nascent companies in biotech, tech, and green energy."
Nice valuation and insiders have been accumulating with their own money. Loaded up at $20.88 today!
I bought DNB 10 years ago and made some money when they exited the public market. I can't remember why they left and I don't know why they came back.
"The Market continues to go up, this stock is in the toilet and swirling around the bowl..."
It went public today and the company looks good /revenue .. but don’t know much ..Ur thought?
Okay this earnings call tomorrow will determine if I was smart to hold this one!!
"The only ppl whose making money on any IPOs are the key executives, BoD cuz their salaries are pegged for years on behest of investors. The biggest winners are the underwrites charged millions in fees. If a company is very profitable, why go public?...does it make any sense? Another reason is to raise funds for CAPEX?...again using investors money!....duh... pure n simple..."
DNB reached a new 52 Week High at 134.12
