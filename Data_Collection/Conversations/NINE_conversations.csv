"Let me help youz newbies.. here's the formula to look for present value.. not wishin in one and and cutting the other off.. (REV+EQUITY) / MARKET CAP.. This company comes up with a .02 due to the outstanding debt.. I'm into companies with over 3.5 for a figure from this formula.. and I do share.. $NINE, $BWEN, $IFMK, $NEXA.. $AYTU is even better with lots of drugs all ready on the market.. but has a 3 for the figure. hehe THE MAX"

"Well folks.. I've re-ran my little ole formula for value.. and this company came up short.. so, I had to cut ties.. my little formula I've developed when Clinton was in office tells no lies.. (like the bashers and pumpers).. it just gives you the honest lo-down on what the company has been able to accomplish in the markets with what they got.. and this little fella came in with a number of 0.8 for value.. Now don't get me wrong.. pump all you like.. and maybe you can make it into the next MEME stock for $2.. But, the numbers I use are from a fine institution and uses such things as market capital, revenue, and equity.. untill these numbers change.. there will be no more of me being here.. This companies number needs to come up to over 3.5.. before that may happen.. I've three other companies (techies) with numbers over 7.. and I've managed to find the bestest oil company with this little formula.. $NINE with a number of over 11.. Best wishes to youz awlz.. and Good luck wit awl dat jazz.. hehe THE MAX has left the building.........................."
