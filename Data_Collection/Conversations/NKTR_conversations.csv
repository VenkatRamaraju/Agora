"Just going on record for next week...(My last post today before the fun starts).1. PROPEL will be good-to-great, we know this and even the shorts do. SFJ invested $150M based on early results of PROPEL; study was steadily expanded, cohorts added, over-enrolled, etc. JZ hints on CCs earlier this year. 2. PROPEL will most likely be at SITC because that's the historical pattern. If it's not it's because of NDA in place prohibiting study results during ongoing buyout negotiations. If not at SITC, PROPEL will be later in the year as promised.3. Conference call next week will likely shed more light on PROPEL (whether or not at SITC) and will have some bullish nuggets, I suspect.4. Any further weakness on Monday should be a buying opportunity heading into Thursday conference call.5. If you still have doubts, look at the call-put ratio over next 4 months. It's like 10-1 in favor of calls. Smart money (or whatever money) knows which way it's going. These short posters are calling for $4, $6 Nektar. They'd be buying massive puts if they were on the level. They're not. In fact I'm pretty sure they are buying and covering. That's been their game. Talk about a con.6. If you still have doubts after that, look at short interest, it fell again by 200,000 shares last period. if there was really bad PROPEL expected, short interest would be rising, not falling.7. If you still have doubts even after that, look at institutional holding. Sure Fidelity rebalanced some, but what's 10%? Big deal. 30% then we talk. And not when last quarter you have uber-conservative Texas and New Jersey pension funds *adding* $4M in Nektar. At the lows. During the short and distort nonsense. Yeah. That happened.8. And finally, even if you doubt *ALL* of that, look at the Nektar option grant, the big one at $21.79 in September. Where do you think the company expects the stock to go in the near term?Okay, now I can sleep well at night knowing I did my best to edumacate those on the fence.Peace out."
The Jan $25 call is up 40% today..... TODAY! So transparent.
"Keytruda's rise into one of the highest-selling drugs in the worldBob HermanFri, October 29, 2021,Cancer drug Keytruda is on pace to generate more than $17 billion of revenue this year after reaching a record $4.5 billion of sales in the third quarter.Why it matters: Keytruda is close to becoming the highest-selling drug in the world and would be a Fortune 200 company on its own.Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for freeDriving the news: Keytruda continues to be the core of Merck, even though executives told Wall Street yesterday the company expects to collect between $5 billion and $7 billion, now through 2022, from its coronavirus pill molnupiravir.That's a lot of money, but molnupiravir still wouldn't be half as much as what Keytruda brings in annually for Merck.Keytruda represents ""the vast majority of the company's revenue growth"" and is the company's profit engine, Merck said in a filing earlier this year.How we got here: Keytruda, which is administered intravenously in a hospital or outpatient office, has been on the market since late 2014 and has shown to be extremely effective.Merck has obtained several new FDA approvals that expand the drug's label into more types of cancers.Merck is also pushing to use the drug after surgeries as a way to prevent cancers from coming back.Between the lines: Because Keytruda is given in a health care facility and not picked up at a pharmacy, the drug is billed and paid for in a different way, but still exposes cancer patients to high out-of-pocket spending regardless of their insurance.Keytruda has a list price of almost $175,000 per year (and Merck just raised that price by another 2% this month).That means insured patients who take the drug routinely hit out-of-pocket maximums, which could equal thousands of dollars every year.The bottom line: Keytruda's patent doesn't expire until 2028, and given the lack of federal drug pricing reform, Keytruda will continue to be among the highest-selling drugs."
The markets have spoken. Go back and read all of those pumpers saying shorts will cover going into SITC and that this would be in the 20s based off the optionsThe pumpers have been wrong for 4 years. Every pop was a fadeThey have run out of runway to keep hiding the data. Funds are throwing in the towel.
"I’m amused because we are done on less than 50K volume, and the shorts are crowing. Has anyone noticed that the shorts are only ever able to yank down the share price on low volume? This stock is effectively not trading ahead of news. Everyone who is going to take a position has taken one. Shorts play games in the puddles of the empty stream-bed, but price movement on these volumes is meaningless, as is, in its totality, the chart of a highly manipulated stock with >95% institutional ownership and very low effective liquidity. On next Thursday’s CC, we will find out at minimum where the PROPEL data are going to be presented before EOY, and likely some color about the data themselves. We may also see SITC abstracts on Monday, but I’m looking to Thursday’s CC for plenty of information. The shorts are going into overdrive on this board, trying to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). Their time is soon up. Don’t let them use anemic volume to sell to them before PROPEL data are released (to happen before EOY 2021 as Nektar has repeatedly indicated)."
many drugs make it to phase 3 but few get approval i think its low single digits on drugs that actually get approved in phase 3 so yes the odds are against us even if its bad news NKTR still has a billion dollars in the bank and big partners and other drugs in the pipeline im still in for no reason other than ive held it for years made a nice profit when it rocketed to over a 100 and then bought back when it dropped a bad read out will definitely kill any confidence wall street or analysts have in NKTR so it may stay down for a long while IF we do get bad news... time is near... good luck longs...........
"Why do you trust a secretary eating Howard, an uncanny option insider trader who has been tremendously and highly successful in selling his underserved options at almost every pop of the stock, who said ""NKTR-181 is a first-in-class medicine to significantly contribute to solving the national opioid crisis"" and ""We have been working closely with the FDA to make this medicine to patients ASAP."" while ignoring FDA's guidelines?"
"Reposting this CB post because is is great...'If I was Nektar, I’d be more pro-PR than they’ve been. But I think that after the 2019 setback they decided to retrench and save their PR for ironclad datasets because that’s the best way to counter the short and distort fraud — with data and facts. I think that they did his with the blessing of (perhaps the insistence of) their biggest institutional investors like Invesco, which has steadily added to its position in the dark, quiet times. PROPEL will be noticed throughout the oncology community, and I expect that this will coincide with a PR push, followed soon by p3 melanoma data (700+ patients) and a cascade of read outs thereafter. Another possibility to consider is that the quiet has had to do with buyout talks. Buyout will be much more expensive after the PROPEL results are released."""
"Good efforts by the shorts today trying to create the fear that someone leaked information before Sitc and the news is bad. I am positive that the propel data is good enough for SFJ to invest 150 millions and Merck to provide free keytruda. Nktr will release the data before the end of the year, the earliest at Sitc and the latest at ESMO. I actually acquire more shares today and will go even harder when the shorts keep playing this game before earring CC 11/4. I believe Nktr will provide the timeline and colors on earning cc. FDA melanoma approval will be in 1st quarter 2022. It's not just AA. It will be a full approval with demonstration of prolonged PFS, better CR, very similar to Pivot 2 study results. Buy when others are fearful and Be fearful when others are greedy. if you do enough research and have been practicing medicine as long as I did, you know the opportunity is there. Invesco doesn't invest to get 20% as their #1 holding with 34 plus millions shares they invest to gain 5-10 valuation. Let's watch this unfold when they release Propel before end of the year and the momentum will continue to carry into 2022 with full approval of bempeg for melanoma, followed by bladder and RCC. We are looking at a stock with potential to repeat 2017 Sitc run and 5 baggers in less than one year."
"From the 2020 World Conference on Lung Cancer Singapore:D.R. Spigel, et al. Sarah Cannon Research Institute, TN, USAThere is an unmet need for novel immunotherapy agents for patients who are unlikely to respond to CPI (with low or negative PD-L1 expression) and to provide deeper, prolonged responses in those who do respond.As of December 17, 2020, the PROPEL study has completed its enrollment in the NSCLC Dose Expansion part of the study. Expansion of this study and new study arms are planned and will be open to enrollment soon.————It appears low and negative PD-L1 groups will be highlighted in the PROPEL data readout. Could it be BTD for one or both groups? Or BTD across all three groups?"
"According to JZ, the PROPEL data will broken out into the three PD-L1 groups. And it is looking like the PD-L1 <1% data will be double or triple what single agent Keytruda is. If this is the case, it will be huge. And there would be a very good chance that the PROPEL data will be an oral presentation at SITC. This would put bempeg in a brighter spotlight.Late breaking abstract title and author will be released next Monday at 8:00am EST. I assume NKTR will have a PR sometime after 8:00am."
"Bemdivo and bemtruda for NSCLCOn Oct 31, 2019, the following was added to the PIVOT-02 detailed description: One dedicated and separate cohort in Part 2 will evaluate NKTR-214 with nivolumab in an additional 100 second-line NSCLC patients previously treated with an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 in combination with doublet platinum-containing cytotoxic chemotherapy in first-line.NKTR said the following on the 2Q20 CC: BMS has recently informed us that they will not start the Phase II study in first-line non-small cell lung cancer with bempeg plus nivo that was outlined in our amended agreement.————Compare that to a few comments HR, Wei or JZ made during the last few CCs:With pembrolizumab firmly established as the preferred standard of care, we are now in a position to move quickly on the strategy for a registrational trial in first-line non-small cell lung cancer with pembro upon successful outcomes with the PROPEL study.And there's been a significant investigator interest in this study, and as a result, we've seen a recent increase in patient enrollment.We've had great interest in the study from leading thoracic cancer centers in the U.S. and Europe. And consequently, we have surpassed our expected enrollment in the last few months.As we mentioned at the JPMorgan conference, enrollment in this trial came in well ahead of schedule with a high number of patients enrolled in November and December of last year.We look at things like doubling, for example, or more the response rate in the less than 1%, for example, tripling it. So in the 20s, the mid-20s relative to 8% historical and the less than 1%. Those are the kinds of ranges that we're looking at.And then, you also look at the whole totality of the data as well, right? We'll look at durability of the responses and we'll look at time to event, like progression and other kinds of components as well.In terms of our strategy for BEMPEG plus pembro, our first priority is to focus on the largest settings where pembro is the gold standard of care, non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer.In non-small cell lung cancer, we know that the quantity of underlying inflammation in the tumor microenvironment can impact antitumor activity of single agent checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab. This is defined by PD-L1 expression status. As we have discussed in the past, single-agent pembrolizumab has most benefit in patients in the greater than 50% subgroup given the mechanisms of BEMPEG, which targets and increases the inflammatory state of the tumor of regulation, PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment, we believe that the combination of BEMPEG and pembro in non-small cell lung cancer could improve the efficacy of the doublet in multiple PD-L1 expression subgroups.Now one of the things you can expect in that data presentation is that we will provide all of the available information that we've collected on the patients that we've been following in those cohorts. The study has three different subgroups of patients distributed between PD-L1 expression levels. Patients in the less than 1% PD-L1 category, the 1% to 49% category and the greater than 50%. And our intention is to provide the full range of observations.So that will include all of the correlations of safety readouts, all of the efficacy information including the ORR as well as the CR, the composite endpoint and any time-to-event events that have also been accumulated in the data. And we're looking forward to presenting that later this year."
"Nobody on this board but The Caffeinated One, Klaus, Corona, Lobo, Shadow, and Paul really begin to understand the opportunity sitting before Nektar.Just look at PROPEL. If great, then Merck knows that Bempeg turns $7B in annual revenue into $21B in annual revenue (unlocking 70% of cancers it can't currently touch)... *instantly*. Of course, the cost of treatment would increase, let's say by 50%. Total market (just talking Keytruda for NSCLC) would now be $32B of which NKTR let's say gets 40%. Thats $12-13B - 35% for BMY = $8B. Earnings of $7B. Drug sector P/E of 24. Be conservative, just say 10 P/E. $70B market cap.........for JUST KEYTRUDA + BEMPEG.And that's just current market size. 10% CAGR = $13-$15B by 2025 (for Nektar) for Keytruda + Bempeg.Now you know why PROPEL is big? Now you know why call options outweigh puts for next 3 months by 12-1??Come on fellas. Get with the program.Oh wait... you think PROPEL is anything but stellar with 3x study expansion of 4 years, maxed enrollment, and expanded arms?? Puleeez."
INTC up 2% following insider buying shares in the open market. What about NKTR? Nobody has bought NKTR shares in open market. I feel Howard will deliver bad data soon... Next Thursday maybe....
"Now NKTR stock price is lower than $18.51 despite a recent rise. Why? As Dr. Schimmer stated below, investors do not trust NKTR. He in essence openly stated NKTR most likely lied about reduced 214 efficacy. If you investigate NKTR's track record, you will realize he was right. Howard lied to, misled, and deceived investors for years. Recently he claimed 181 was a first class medicine to save opioid addicts and 214 was promising for COVID though they have not finished N=6 data analysis and that NKTR would not pursue 214 for COVID despite its promising clinical data. I could not believe what he said. This company has no credibility and I believe Howard should be investigated for insider trading, misleading and defrauding investors:“It’s hard to tell if there’s a legitimate issue with the NKTR 214 batches or another creative way to explain away our concerns that bempeg has not been dosed to have meaningful clinical activity,” Evercore ISI analyst Josh Schimmer wrote in a Thursday note to clients."
"I’ve figured out Shortall and his Mo Money “crew”. It’s two guys. I was wrong to think Shortall is the same as the Mind Prophets. He at least can string together a coherent sentence and has at most a junior college education. His lackey, on the other hand, is the one who runs the “crew” IDs… Kurt, Curecancer, ExNKTR, J, and the rest of the imaginary minions. This guy can hardly conjugate a verb and uses the “paid pumper” and “dummy” and “moron” jargon to spice up his gibberish.It’s a boiler room. Hired by a hedge fund or other party interested in tearing down or pumping up a stock. They operate across a number of stocks, apparently. Lobo knows which ones.They might have a couple shares here or there (at least shortall might, not sure about his gimp) and they’re fed some scraps of “intel” from whatever fund is using them. That’s how they knew FMR (Fidelity) was doing some minor fund rebalancing.They probably work out of some strip mall or other low rent digs next to a massage parlor and a Subway or something.I give them credit, though, if not for their intelligence at least for their persistence. They’ve turned this board into a dung heap, which is really the whole point.It will be tough when they become “fellow travelers” on the long side starting next week or the week after, as the fund they are working for has no doubt been accumulating NKTR at these prices pennies above the scrap value. They were long a few weeks back when the market makers and short hedge fund(s) briefly lost control of things and road the stock up to reload their shorts.They will be pumping NKTR soon, you’ll see. And that’s why their favorite term is “paid pumpers”… because that’s exactly what they do.So here’s to the Mo Money crew of two forlorn, fast-food eating losers down in backwater FL… I guess we’re gonna be neighbors for awhile."
"A singular investment firm’s own business issues have zero to do with the value of Nktr. Hedge funds are buying, that’s a fact. Hedge funds like to buy as cheap as possible, that’s a fact. Cheap shares are obtained from weak hands, that’s also a fact. I’ll take some of those cheap shares myself."
"BMY comboGilead’s $4.9 billion bet on Forty Seven has run into a delay. Weeks after Takeda’s rival drug flunked a pivotal trial, Gilead has pushed back the release of data from a phase 1b study designed to support accelerated approval.The data drop on magrolimab in the blood cancer myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which was scheduled for this year, is now penciled in (PDF) for the first quarter of 2022. Analysts at Jefferies said the delay is “in part due to GILD still talking to FDA on filing requirements, particularly after Takeda just failed a Phase III in MDS after strong Phase IB CR rates in MDS.” Takeda reported the failure of NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor pevonedistat in patients with MDS and a set of related conditions in September, despite an earlier-phase study linking it to an increased complete response rate versus the control. Talking to investors after disclosing the delay, Merdad Parsey, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer at Gilead, said “we continue to evolve our clinical programs in the context of the recent development in the MDS therapeutic landscape.” The phase 1b data continue to ""mature,” Parsey said, but will now be shared later than previously expected. RELATED: Gilead strikes $4.9B Forty Seven acquisition, paying a hefty premium for cancer drugGilead has discussed the potential to seek accelerated approval on the strength of the phase 1b data and then confirm the effect of magrolimab in MDS by delivering results from a phase 3 study that is already enrolling patients. The plan is supported by the breakthrough designation Gilead picked up after linking magrolimab plus Bristol Myers Squibb’s Vidaza to a complete response rate of 42%.The complete response rate seen at the interim analysis of the phase 1b clinical trial suggested the anti-CD47 antibody may improve outcomes in previously untreated patients with intermediate-, high- or very high-risk MDS. However, the failure of Takeda in phase 3 after its pevonedistat-Vidaza cocktail recorded a 52% complete response rate in higher-risk MDS shows how early clinical results can fail to translate into pivotal success."
"If an influential analyst openly writes this to his clients, what does it tell you about NKTR management?cr00ks!“It’s hard to tell if there’s a legitimate issue with the NKTR 214 batches or another creative way to explain away our concerns that bempeg has not been dosed to have meaningful clinical activity,” Evercore ISI analyst Josh Schimmer wrote in a Thursday note to clients."
