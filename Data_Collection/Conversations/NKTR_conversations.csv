What is Howard eating for lunch today? His own secretary?
"Mark42 minutes agoYou should know these FACTS:Nektar (NKTR) is designed to be a TREMENDOUSLY & HIGHLY (HR's favorite adjectives when he lies) & infamously INCOMPETENT & Morally bankrupt pariah in the biotech industry thanks to 1. CEO's TREMENDOUSLY & HIGHLY immoral SEXUAL affair with his OWN secretary allegedly giving her TREMENDOUSLY & HIGHLY DESIGNED special treatments including the highest annual performance review possible, 2. hiring and promoting his TREMENDOUSLY & HIGHLY unimpressive intern child to VP TREMENDOUSLY & HIGHLY shockingly fast, 3. TREMENDOUSLY & HIGHLY FRAUDULENT DUMB claim on NKTR-181 (aka NKTR-27:00) solely to increase his options value, "" a First Class Medicine to contribute significantly to SOLVING the NATIONAL opioid crisis"", ""105 is a great cancer drug candidate but we will put it on the shelf,"" ""214 is promising for COVID but we will focus on I/O."""
"I am holding my shares with lots of trepidation that this time is no different. I used to work for NKTR and I know this company has a very poor track record. But I am still holding my remnant shares (not many shares, though) hoping that this time they will surprise me with really good clinical data. We will see…."
"Guys, genuine questions here.. getting up to speed on il-2 space... looking specifically at $nltx $nktr $mdna $howlWhat are the differences you think among these players?why did you guys choose $nltx on this board?"
Volume spiked as price dropped. Very interesting
"Now NKTR stock price is lower than $18.51 despite a recent rise. Why? As Dr. Schimmer stated below, investors do not trust NKTR. He in essence openly stated NKTR most likely lied about reduced 214 efficacy. If you investigate NKTR's track record, you will realize he was right. Howard lied to, misled, and deceived investors for years. Recently he claimed 181 was a first class medicine to save opioid addicts and 214 was promising for COVID though they have not finished N=6 data analysis and that NKTR would not pursue 214 for COVID despite its promising clinical data. I could not believe what he said. This company has no credibility and I believe Howard should be investigated for insider trading, misleading and defrauding investors:“It’s hard to tell if there’s a legitimate issue with the NKTR 214 batches or another creative way to explain away our concerns that bempeg has not been dosed to have meaningful clinical activity,” Evercore ISI analyst Josh Schimmer wrote in a Thursday note to clients.""Physicians worried that the available NKTR-214 data looked “cherry-picked” to appear somewhat positive and that more critical numbers, such as progression-free survival, were long overdue. Moreover, a slowdown in new clinical trial sites “could point to loss of confidence among investigators,” Chen cited one physician as saying."""
"Howard should be in jail. TheRealBob2 days agoI have never trusted one word coming from a secretary eating Howard. 105 did not work, 214 did not work for Covid. 214 manufacturing problem is fabricated b/c 214 inventors were fired and CSO was also fired. All lie. No credibility."
"Cynthia (a true long) 3 days agoI’m bullish on NKTR, but have to say your reference to Howard’s statement, ‘We have been working closely with the FDA’, is exactly what I remember him saying - and it turned out to be 100% pure horse shirt!"
Need volume
"Facts ONLY: All NKTR analysts, starting with a very smart Jessica, have downgraded NKTR since Howard massively dumped his shares @ $90 (average price). Now 3 SB, 3 B, and 7 Hold with a one year target price of $29.91. Six analysts who rate SB and B have all reduced their NKTR target prices. Now NKTR stock price is lower than $18.51 despite a recent rise. Why? As Dr. Schimmer stated below, investors do not trust NKTR. He in essence openly stated NKTR most likely lied about reduced 214 efficacy. If you investigate NKTR's track record, you will realize he was right.

"NKTR LONGS - There are many bullish signs to be observed! Yes, we saw the call buying recently, far outpacing puts. We see the major block trades after hours. We see the expanding PROPEL cohorts and maxed out study enrollments. All goodness!But you know what is most bullish of all? The desperation of Short Troll! This is always the most reliable indicator of great news coming for Nektar. Because when the Short & Distort abomination pulls out all the stops, we know salvation is near! When it gathers the chains restraining him to his dungeon keyboard station, it DIGS DEEP with frenzied talk of lawsuits (without links or proof)! Institutional selling (only listing those who sold, not the many more who bought)! Cherry picked data (as it - the Troll - knows good data is on the horizon)! We tend to assume Short Troll is useless. But it's as reliable a barometer as one can have to indicate when good news for NKTR is at hand!Behold! Our circus gimp types and we tilt our heads ever so slightly... and appraise it with a mix of scorn and pity. [chain yanks]... you are under our heel."
"Why do you trust Howard, an outstanding option trader, who said ""NKTR-181 is a first-in-class medicine to significantly contribute to solving the national opioid crisis"" and ""We have been working closely with the FDA to make this medicine to patients ASAP."" while ignoring FDA's guidelines?"

Merck is flying today on COVID NEWS. Nktr needs two more years to analyze the data on their 6 mild patients
"We need more volume. These pennies a day is nice but we want that big pop going into SITC. If we did, we would unload the shares we nibbled on. Why take the risk? However we have more shares than anyone here and so we remain curious but we want volume and a pop. Sell offs it has volume and down 7%. We need that to the upside"
"I have a friend who used to work for NKTR. He said about 80% of what Howard says is lie, hyperbole, or misleading statement. THE NKTR WAY!"
"Mondays open was 17.07. Will this be yet another week where it closes lower than it started? The trend long term is still bearish as hell. Only JPM, GS, FDA and Shortall can change this narrative. You all should be praying to our lord and asking for his help"
"Options grants for NKTR executives today. According to the fine print on the SEC Form 4’s, these options (exercise price $21.79) were granted because Nektar’s “Board of Directors of the Company determined that the performance-based vesting requirement for these stock options was satisfied on September 15, 2021.” I suspect that we will soon hear why this performance reward was made."
"Cynthia3 days agoI’m bullish on NKTR, but have to say your reference to Howard’s statement, ‘We have been working closely with the FDA’, is exactly what I remember him saying - and it turned out to be 100% pure horse shirt!"
"kklausbecker11 hours ago214 IS NOT A PLACEBO. PLAINVIEW IS WRONG. But it does not help opdivo in a meaningful way except for the initial trial with a few patients. BMY will give up filing approval for the combo. Mark my words. BMY will walk away and sell NKTR shares, which will crash NKTR below $4."
The no data should be concerning. You don’t hold positive data when stock is near all time lows
Fact #2: Howard hired his own unimpressive son as an intern at Sirna. He hired the child as an intern at NKTR after he was hired as CEO. The child initially worked in Business Development but was transferred to Project Development and promoted to VP at a speed you have never seen before. This enormity of Nepotism is unprecedented not only at NKTR but also at any biotech company in USA.
"Long7 days agoNKTR is now very busy analyzing phase 2 data on NSCLC. The company is also busy analyzing promising 214 phase 1 data on Covid (N = 6). Based on the Covid data analysis speed, it is projected that NKTR will fully complete the phase 2 data analysis (aka data cherry-picking ) only after at least one positive phase 3 outcome not requiring data cherry picking, potentially Q 1 2023."
I think NKTR can't fully understand communications from the FDA. That is why the FDA publicly chastised NKTR in the NKTR-181 ADCOM for having not followed the FDA guideline.
A good starting point for understanding NKTR and the avalanche of nonsense posts on this board https://seekingalpha.com/article/4452234-manipulation-meets-opportunity-at-nektar-cocktail-party
"Someone bought 100,000 shares at about 1:00pm and it has been up since. Still noise. Data will decide."
I gave FLXN months ago at 5 dollars a share. It was just bought out! Congrats to Mo Money for bagging another massive gain
"My personal story. Some might wonder I, as a pumper ID, bashes NKTR. Initially I was a long (my average buy price was about $74 per share) and pumped NKTR a lot believing 214 might almost cure cancer, especially melanoma. Then I came to realize I had been defrauded when Howard dumped his options on average of $90 -$94 and released poorer data and spun it in several CC with analysts. I was mad as hell after Jessica confirmed my suspicion about a lying Howard. So I studied Howard and NKTR and found ""THE NKTR WAY."" I had sold all of my shares at a loss and shorted lots of shares. I have recovered all of my loss and made a killing. I was lazy and did not change my ID, which should be ""Shorter."" I was also shocked to find out his several year sexual affair with his own secretary and the enormity of nepotism to hire/promoted his own UNQUALIFIED son to VP at lightning speed. It is a mystery to me why Howard and his son still keep their jobs and receive more money/options every year. This is the MOST CORRUPT COMPANY in USA!"
A fact is that NKTR PPS is $17.07 from the high of $114. The street has discounted 214 is a fluke.
Show the phase 2 data on NSCLC without cherry-picking! I think they are busy cherry-picking data to tell investors it is promising but we will focus on I/O using Opdivo/214!
UPST is at all time highs. To those that bought when we advised at 88 congrats as it is now almost 400 in a few months. Shortall has so many of these types of calls. So much money being made in the markets.
"Notice how Short Troll is now saying PROPEL data will be ""cherry picked"". It knows PROPEL will show great results. After all, that is the data SFJ got to see before they did their investment of $150M. You see, Short Troll is shifting it's narrative every so subtly. From saying PROPEL will be horrible to cherry picked. It's all part of the short & distort game. It actually is so transparent, it provides even more ammunition for longs to buy or hold. You see, Troll? You are losing."
"Manipulators posting about a price change on minuscule volume. This is nothing but market makers helping their short buddies cover at low prices (which is easy to do at low volume). A barrage of very high frequency 100 share trades to walk the price down, interspersed with and followed by covering."
"We were able to sell out of our FLXN position today for massive gains. We love the buyout premiums. Our winners were humongous so far this QTR. UPST, LLY, FLXN, MRTX"
Daily Chart ?So little action that I have to zoom in to see the nubs on the bottomRobot trading.
Let’s see how this closes. Volume and price matters more today than most
We would feel better about our position if there was volume. You can't have low volumes on green days and high volume on red days and feel good. It needs to be reversed or this will never move
"Anyone see after hours action? 110,000 shares. Huge blocks."
Only low-IQ pumpers think the data to be released will be great. But look at the current stock price. Mr. Market has discounted 214 is a #$%$

"A partnership between Bristol Myers Squibb and BeiGene on the chemotherapy Abraxane in China has quickly deteriorated since a manufacturing-related marketing hold last March. Now, the U.S. pharma is scrapping the deal—much to the Chinese partner’s disagreement.BMS and its Celgene unit alerted BeiGene last week that they are withdrawing Abraxane’s China rights from a basket licensing deal Celgene signed in 2017, BeiGene said in a securities filing Wednesday. The termination will take effect 180 days from the notice, a BMS spokesperson told Fierce Pharma.To justify its move, BMS pointed to its inability to make Abraxane from two manufacturing sites, one in Illinois operated by CDMO Fresenius Kabi and another in Phoenix owned by BMS. But as BeiGene sees it, the notice is a “tactical maneuver” BMS is using to reduce its damages in an ongoing legal fight between the two. The Chinese drugmaker said it “intends to contest the purported termination vigorously.”SVB Leerink analyst Andrew Berens, M.D., said he believes what’s at play here is actually the immuno-oncology rivalry between BMS’ Opdivo and BeiGene’s Novartis-partnered tislelizumab. The BeiGene PD-1 inhibitor is one of many homegrown drugs already squeezing the breathing room of Western players in China—and eyeing the U.S. market, too.RELATED: BeiGene's supply of Bristol Myers Squibb's Abraxane freezes in China amid Fresenius Kabi plant woesBerens previously projected BeiGene could collect $100 million from Abraxane sales in China in 2022 after it resolves the marketing hold. Now, he’s erasing the drug’s contribution to BeiGene’s top line. But he argues Abraxane—along with other legacy Celgene products BeiGene licenses—are less relevant to BeiGene’s story now that the company has transitioned to the commercial stage and has bagged a much more important deal with Amgen.Things were different back in 2017, when BeiGene vaulted to the commercial stage by acquiring Celgene’s entire commercial operations in China, including rights to the marketed drugs Abraxane, Revlimid and Vidaza. At that time, Celgene also in-licensed tislelizumab, which it returned with the BMS merger thanks to conflict with Opdivo.Abraxane was a major part of that portfolio, making up half of BeiGene’s 2019 revenues. But in March 2020, China’s drug regulators slammed the brakes on Abraxane’s marketing, citing manufacturing breaches at the Fresenius facility in Illinois. The suspension remains in place as generics players are dividing the market.BMS continues to work with China’s health authorities to explore options, including switching to a different manufacturing site, to restore the Abraxane supply, the BMS spokesperson said. According to BeiGene, BMS in August said it had planned to file an application with China’s National Medical Products Administration for approval of another facility as the manufacturing site for Abraxane for the China market.RELATED: What do Novartis deal, PD-1 competition in China mean for tislelizumab? Here's what BeiGene's CEO has to sayJust as BMS planned to lean on its Phoenix facility for supply, that site hit its own problems in July with a failure in “media fill testing,” according to BeiGene’s quote of the BMS notice. The New York pharma tried to remedy the issue but hasn’t been successful. As a result of Abraxane production hold at the site, BMS has reported a shortage of the drug to the FDA.“Current inventory and distribution are being allocated to minimize potential impact to patient supply,” the BMS spokesperson said of the Abraxane situation in the U.S.In the meantime, BeiGene is accusing BMS of breaching their contract—and demanding damages—in an arbitration process at the International Chamber of Commerce.“We disagree with any assertion that we have breached our contract with BeiGene and will defend our position through the arbitration process,” the BMS spokesperson said."
$114 to $17.3. That's a fact. What has caused the epic crash? No reproducible clinical data! 214 batches? Easy to treat initial patients? Just statistical fluke in phase 1/2? Only CB knows!
The FDA might have put NKTR on its black list following the infamous and unprecedented disaster of nktr 27:00. The agency publicly severely criticized nktr for not having followed its guidelines. So I believe the agency will ask nktr if they have read and understood their guidelines whenever nktr interacts with it.
"ATTENTION ANYONE NEW TO NEKTAR: Welcome to the Yahoo Message board for Nektar Therapeutics. The sane and reasonable participants of this board would like to apologize in advance to you. As you can see there is a “short & distort” troll who lives on this board pretty much all day and all night, polluting the premises with a nonstop stream of drivel and garbage, all intended to scare you away. Away from what, you might ask? A tremendous opportunity, that’s what. In short, Nektar makes a cancer immunotherapy drug (Bempeg) that works in combination with the leading cancer drugs from Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, and others to make those drugs exponentially more effective. Just Opdivo (BMY) and Keytruda (MRK) alone combine for well over $20B in annual revenue. Now think about Nektar-214 (Bempeg) being PAIRED with both those drugs as the new standard of care (SOC) when treating many different types of cancer. There’s no reason Nektar couldn’t command that same kind of revenue (and much more), and with a Drug Sector P/E of 24, you can do the math. So your next question is, “Well, why is Nektar stock so cheap, then?” Good question. A combination of bad luck and bad actors, and yes, some bad quality control, have combined to create one of the biggest opportunities ever.Here’s the history. Back in late 2017 the stock exploded to over $100 when the Bempeg human studies showed incredible results. BMY invested $2B in Nektar. But then everything fell apart. A short attack was launched, based on the fraudulent “Plainview” report that fooled even some scientists. It was eventually disputed and exposed as fraud, but the damage was done. Nektar also announced a manufacturing error with some “bad batches” of Bempeg that impacted one or more studies. Not good. And finally, Nektar had to withdraw Nektar 181 (a non-addictive opioid candidate) from the market due to the anti-opioid political climate. Ouch. All of these things combined to bring down the stock over the next couple of years to where it sits today, with many retail investors now feeling “burned” by what happened. None of this changed the underlying promise of Bempeg, however, and all the human studies continued unabated with good lots of the drug. Meanwhile, major institutional investors swooped in and picked up the discounted shares, pried free from weak-kneed retailers with the help of the ongoing short and distort campaign that you are witnessing on this very board. These institutions (for example Invesco, whose largest holding is - you guessed it - Nektar) now own over 92% of the total float, which means it’s even easier for the shorts to manipulate the stock. Go to Seeking Alpha for articles containing detailed explanations of all of this.Where we sit now is that a major Nektar study - PROPEL - which combines Bempeg plus Keytruda, is about to be “read out” with results in the next 1-4 weeks. All the big investment banks and everyone else for that matter is awaiting those results. All the previous Bempeg human studies - with the exception of those impacted by the bad lot Bempeg - have all read out positively so far, so there’s no valid reason to expect anything different this time. There are still 15M+ shares short which means a big short squeeze is coming on any positive news. The stock is low because all the institutional investors have their massive holdings in place and the retailers are nervous because, well, their feelings were hurt when they sold too early. Sniff. If they had just stopped to research the science, they would have doubled down. Anyway, that’s the major opportunity with Nektar. Good luck."

NKTR is down today because Nancy Pelosi is asking the SEC to investigate NKTR for not having any minorities in senior positions.

"History: These rulings are no different than the Hoby lobby lawsuits where Obama faceplanted on the Obamacare mandate(s)The ball is rolling .....Judge Orders United Airlines Not to Put Workers Seeking Vaccine Mandate Exception on LeaveBy Zachary Stieber October 13, 2021 Updated: October 13, 2021biggersmaller PrintA federal judge on Tuesday ordered United Airlines not to place workers seeking an exemption to the company’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate on unpaid leave.The temporary ruling was issued by U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman so workers who filed for an exemption aren’t unduly harmed before he can hear oral arguments in the case.Six United workers sued the company last month over its plans to put on leave any employees who requested religious or medical exemptions. The suit said the employees were effectively told they’d be terminated if they sought exemptions and alleged that the company was violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA.“United’s actions have left Plaintiffs with the impossible choice of either taking the COVID-19 vaccine, at the expense of their religious beliefs and their health, or losing their livelihoods. In doing so, United has violated Title VII and the ADA by failing to engage in the interactive process and provide reasonable accommodations, and also by retaliating against employees who engaged in protected activity,” the suit states.United and the plaintiffs reached an agreement that the company would not place exempted employees on leave during a Sept. 24 hearing, Pittman said, obviating the need for an immediate ruling. He planned to hear arguments on a motion for a preliminary injunction on Oct. 8 but United the day before the hearing filed a partial motion to dismiss, alleging the court lacked jurisdiction over some of the claims.The hearing was reset to Oct. 13. Ahead of the arguments, Pittman said he concluded it was necessary to issue a temporary restraining order that is effective through Oct. 31.Absent entry of the order, “the parties’ stipulation will expire before the Court can rule on whether a preliminary injunction is warranted,” the Trump nominee wrote.“If the parties’ stipulation were to expire without temporary injunctive relief in place, nothing would prevent hundreds of workers from ostensibly either: (1) being compelled to take a vaccination in violation of their religious beliefs or medical restrictions, or (2) being placed on indefinite unpaid leave by United,” he added.United said earlier this month that 320 workers in the United States, or 0.5 percent of the U.S. workforce, were not in compliance with its COVID-19 vaccine mandate.United told news outlets after Pittman’s order that “vaccine requirements work and nearly all of United’s U.S. employees have chosen to get a shot.”“For a number of our employees who were approved for an accommodation, we’re working to put options in place that reduce the risk to their health and safety, including new testing regimens, temporary job reassignments, and masking protocols,” the airline said."
Volume is up today and go figure it is to the red. The sellers love to dump after a mini run on this. I guess the pros see this nothing more than a trade. Funny that is how shortall has been saying for a long time. I bet they read this and his posts to decide their next moves. As you all should
"FACT #8: Howard pumped NKTR-118 so much that he claimed it would be 2 to 3 billion dollar blockbuster thanks to AZ and so many opioid-related cases. That was another pumping by Howard to sell his options at higher prices. It turned out that the revenue is so miniscule that NKTR gets almost nothing from NKTR-118. And NKTR has never developed NKTR-119. Howard is the king of pumping, misleading and lying to investors just to line his pockets!"

When will Howard admit 214 is a more or less placebo when combined with Opdivo?Coming soon!!! And NKTR tanks below $8....

Robin - President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't call it a restart of Propel, I think we unfortunately lot 5 was used in all the PROPEL patients and we are now using other lots which are comparable to lots 1 and 3 and we will be moving forward particularly in first-line non-small cell lung cancer in combination with pembro.From the 3Q19 CC:Jonathan Zalevsky - Chief Research & Development OfficerBut we will be evaluating the doublet of Bempeg plus pembrolizumab in three different PD-L1 expresser populations in the PD-L1 low less than 1% and in the PD-L1 intermediate and 1% to 49% and the PD-L1 high the greater than 50% in populations.HR from the 3Q20 CC:We are well ahead of our enrollment projections for the PROPEL study.JZ from the 4Q20 CC:So the reason why we targeted the second half of the year was really to provide the most comprehensive and complete and mature data set that we can.JZ from the 1Q21 CC:We -- you could really transform that tumor to increase the efficacy of the combination. So when we look at those benchmarks, we look at things like doubling, for example, or more the response rate in the less than 1%, for example, tripling it. So in the 20s, the mid-20s relative to 8% historical and the less than 1%. Those are the kinds of ranges that we're looking at.JZ from the 2Q21 CC:So as we explained earlier, the enrollment in the PROPEL study has been going very well.And our intention is to provide the full range of observations. So that will include all of the correlations of safety readouts, all of the efficacy information including the ORR as well as the CR, the composite endpoint and any time-to-event events that have also been accumulated in the data.Maybe what you were also asking is that when we look at the data, in the future, we may see a greater signal in one of the subgroups, for example, over another.So like here are some benchmarks. We know that single agent pembro has about an 8% response rate in the less than 1% population and about a 15% to 17% response rate in the 1% to 49% population. So those are two areas where single agent pembro has a lot less activity, much, much less than it has in the greater than 50% population.So it's quite reasonable based on the mechanism of action of BEMPEG that we may see greater activity in those lower PD-L1 expression subgroups.————I am looking forward to the 3Q21 CC questions and the answers from JZ, if the PROPEL data does not come out before the CC."
"My bashing is based on facts: Howard has screwed his own secretary for years, hired/promoted his so so intern child to VP at lightning speed, lied too often (140, 181, 118, 102, 105, 214 COVID, 214 batches, revenues, et ac.), traded his options too perfect (at almost every pop)."
Longs and shorts. The price is pegged to this area until SITC. HR will not release any news before and if the news at SITC is the same old stale data we have come to expect. Get ready for it.
The bashers never provide any proof that 214 doesn't convert PDL1 from negative to positive.
"The whole basis of fraud, lying, cheating about a low level il-2 is it is too low to work. No way it is super superior. Yet Bempeg low level is beyond super superior. Which is a bigger drug. Keyturda or Opdivo. Why? Keyturda is super superior over Opdivo. Why is. Bempeg super superior, Bempeg is in combo with PDL1s. If others are 44% CRs for melanoma, then good for them. If they are 30%. Well. Not a dime for them."
"FACT #7: Howard said 102 was too good to ""give it to a big pharma"" and declared ""GO IT ALONE!"" as if he got an offer from a big pharma. NKTR had spent so many years to get an approval but it was not good enough to submit NDA to the FDA. The secretary-screwing CEO has been pumping every single drug candidate just to sell his options at higher prices. He should be in jail for defrauding investors by lying to, misleading investors so many times."
NKTR is infamous for cherry-picking data as analysts openly say they creatively explained ORR and CR drops with Wrong Batches while firing head of research and 214 inventors.
Klausyesterday102 was marginally effective and NKTR gave up filing an approval application after many years of pumping it and misleading investors. 214 is no different than 102. How come is Howard still a CEO? That is mind boggling! Is he sleeping with board members?
"Also chances are with a stock like NKTR, when you place a buy/sell order, the Market Maker is the one selling or buying it, not some other party on the bid/ask. They maintain a huge inventory of NKTR stock. So, take yesterday. They probably were steadily shorting on the steady price increase throughout the day, as retailers and traders nibbled on the stock. Then today they pulled the rug, and maybe it was the MM themselves covering the 30k-40k shares at average price of $17.15. They just rinse and repeat this and make a cool $75k per week doing it. All the while, the stock can still be in an upward trend, or downward trend. They really don't care. Only when there is VOLUME will these Jedi mind tricks completely fail, and that's when the MM can get burned on the upside or downside. That volume will be coming soon enough. ;-)"
"Facts Matter: All NKTR analysts, starting with a very smart Jessica, have downgraded NKTR since Howard massively dumped his shares @ $90 (average price). Now 3 SB, 3 B, and 7 Hold with a one year target price of $29.91. Six analysts who rate SB and B have all reduced their NKTR target prices. Now NKTR stock price is lower than $18.51 despite a recent rise. Why? As Dr. Schimmer stated below, investors do not trust NKTR. He in essence openly stated NKTR most likely lied about reduced 214 efficacy. If you investigate NKTR's track record, you will realize he was right. Howard lied to, misled, and deceived investors for years. Recently he claimed 181 was a first class medicine to save opioid addicts and 214 was promising for COVID though they have not finished N=6 data analysis and that NKTR would not pursue 214 for COVID despite its promising clinical data. I could not believe what he said. This company has no credibility and I believe Howard should be investigated for insider trading, misleading and defrauding investors:“It’s hard to tell if there’s a legitimate issue with the NKTR 214 batches or another creative way to explain away our concerns that bempeg has not been dosed to have meaningful clinical activity,” Evercore ISI analyst Josh Schimmer wrote in a Thursday note to clients."
Remember we are still in MRTX. We sold UPST and LLY at massive gains awhile ago Go check the history. We are building more cash.
Puts just tanked also...
"Henry2 days agoHow much longer will Howard lie to investors like “214 is promising though N=6 data are not fully analyzed, but we will give it a pass”?"
"Fact # 3: Howard said ""We have been CLOSELY working with the FDA to make NKTR-181, a first in class medicine available to opioid patients ASAP."" But the agency publicly and severely scolded NKTR for not having followed their guidelines at the ADCOM of NKTR-181 (aka NKTR-27:00)."
"214 IS NOT A PLACEBO. PLAINVIEW IS WRONG. But it does not help opdivo in a meaningful way except for the initial trial with a few patients. BMY will give up filing approval for the combo. Mark my words. BMY will walk away and sell NKTR shares, which will crash NKTR below $4."
We are advising to take profits now. You know it will sell off end of day per the norm
"If Howard and NKTR had credibility and good track record, NKTR stock would not be trading below $40. This company has never delivered anything sustainable. BMY was a godsend to NKTR. Maybe BMY was deceived (doubt it) or very desperate (more likely) to have a deal b/c MRK's Keytruda is generally better than Opdivo."
$112 to $17.34! Why? Investors believe what influential analysts and Oncology KOLS's think: 214 is not as good as it was initially with a few patients and NKTR's explanation is based on data cherry-picking.We will know for sure within 6 months how good 214 is in helping Opdivo. But most likely not so good and BMY will give up filing for approval just like 102!
What does a secretary-eating Howard have for lunch everyday?
"As my ID suggests, I used to be long NKTR. But I sold my shares at $86 and turned around to go short NKTR. The catalyst was Howard's massive selling his options just above $90 and Jessica at JPM also expressed her dismay. I am still short NKTR after covering most of my shorted shares. I might cover and buy shares if NKTR releases great phase 2 data everyone is eager to see.......... This is a casino stock......"
Yahoo User1 hour agoNKTR is down today because Nancy Pelosi is asking the SEC to investigate NKTR for not having any minorities in senior positions. The last and only minority employed by NKTR was Dr. Lin who was sexually harassed by the CEO to the point of quitting out of shame for taking his clothes off and doing ungodly acts to keep his options.NKTR looks down on minorities. Dr Lin please write a book
"NKTR is a fraud based on my experience. Nothing has worked despite a secretary eating Howard pumping every experimental drug. All have failed in phase 2, 3, or 4. I believe he should be in jail for misleading investors and committing the enormity of nepotism, corruption, and morally bankrupt sexual affairs with his own secretary and possibly more reports.214 is just another 102."
MRK can now buy another company thanks to a Covid pill. The company should buy NKTR at the range of $40 to 50 and advance 214 to phase 2 for Covid b/c Howard said 214 is promising.
"Until news this is in a close range. We need news to drive volume. HR get out of your secretary and release the data. Also apologize to Dr. Lin for harassing him. In these times, you can't do that stuff anymore"
My associate said to lock in profits at the highs of the day. Yes we are that good. We have software the analyzes volume and price when factoring in dilution.
"below $17 thanks to just one basher here. He must be GOD, ALMIGHTY GOD."
They have to settle the lawsuit soonest with Dr. Lin and hire some minorities. The stock is not nearly strong enough to handle this head wind.
"TheRealBob12 hours agoI have never trusted one word coming from a secretary eating Howard. 105 did not work, 214 did not work for Covid. 214 manufacturing problem is fabricated b/c 214 inventors were fired and CSO was also fired. All lie. No credibility."
"Fact #4: Howard said ""NKTR-181 is a first-in-class medicine to significantly contribute to solving the national opioid crisis."" after he set up a subsidiary, Inheris, to market NKTR-181 no pharma wanted to market."
No volume. Rainman couldn't have been more wrong if he tried. We need much more volume. It is bearish to have crazy volume on down days and tiny volume on up days. You will not break out of this range trading like this. We need volume
"Curecancer3 days agoWhy Insider Transactions Are ImportantInsider transactions shouldn't be used primarily to make an investing decision, however, they can be an important factor for an investor to consider.In legal terms, an ""insider"" refers to any shareholder who owns at least 10% of a company. This can include executives in the c-suite and large hedge funds.When a company insider makes a new purchase, that is an indication that they expect the stock to rise.Insider sells, on the other hand, can be made for a variety of reasons, and may not necessarily mean that the seller thinks the stock will go down. However our greatest and most recent example of insiders selling on bad news were the insiders at Nektar Therapeutics. Prior to horrendous results at ASCO 2017 the CEO sold almost 20 million shares of the stock before the horrendous news was released. Upon release, the stock lost 50% of its value in a day. The CEO lied during a previous CC and said those sales had nothing to do with his inside knowledge of their main drug (NKTR 214) being nothing more than a placebo."
The days are getting Shorter and the year is almost over. We need the damn data released. Let us know if 214 works. CC will be upcoming and they better stop giving fluff. We are curious if the actual analysts will show up this time. Probably not if no news before hand.
"Wow - you guys - big options grant shown today needs to be spelled out...""performance based vesting requirement met"" = positive study results.$21.75 exercise price = 100% expectation of price at least exceeding that shortly.How many more signs you all need?"
"When NKTR can's fully analyze a phase 1 covid trial of 6 (N = 6, six) participants in two months, how can they fully analyze a phase 2 data (N >> 6)?CHERRY-PICKING!"
NKTR will tank below $4 thanks to bad phase 2 data to show 214 is MORE OR LESS a placebo.
NKTR comments show exactly what is wrong about social media.. Most of the comments are insults petty remarks about others and untruths.. Impossible to tell what is truth and what isnt on this board.. I feel like Im on facebook or twitter most days.. Hopefully NKTR will release some good real news soon and settle some of the debate.. Will we rocket higher or drop like a rock ? time will tell....
Robot .... calculations.So if ya look you'll find the robot pulling the share price down at about 9:30 am ea morning ..some times big some not so much.10:20 ish3:40 ish are bigger ...Like clockwork = baked inLet's watch ....
BMY is going to sell their shares and sue NKTR if 214 is shown to be not much better than a placebo in P3. $2 stock!
Bashers bash NKTR and Howard based on facts not conspiracy theories not deflect/distort.Fact #1: Howard has screwed his own secretary for years while giving her the highest annual performance review possible every year.
tanking hard toward $13... No data? Cherry-picking is going on?
"Look at that six month chart of MRTX. If you bought the dip like we said, you are sitting on massive gains."
"I agree with another poster. The fact we are near nov and no data is very alarming. They still haven’t even given the COVID 19 data on six patients. Folks any data about 214 is being hidden like they do with national security. There is a very real possibility 214 does not work at all. If that statement is wrong, why have they been hiding this data for such a very long time? The data on COVID 19 would be interesting. I am thinking it shows 214 does nothing for anything."
102 was marginally effective and NKTR gave up filing an approval application after many years of pumping it and misleading investors. 214 is no different than 102. How come is Howard still a CEO? That is mind boggling! Is he sleeping with board members?
"NKTR is now very busy ""analyzing"" (aka cherry-picking) phase 2 data on NSCLC. The company is also busy ""analyzing"" (aka cherry-picking) promising 214 phase 1 data on Covid (N = 6). Based on the Covid data analysis speed, it is projected that NKTR will fully complete the phase 2 data analysis (aka data cherry-picking ) only after at least one positive phase 3 outcome not requiring data cherry picking, potentially Q 1 2023."
"ATTENTION ANYONE NEW TO NEKTAR: Welcome to the Yahoo Message board for Nektar Therapeutics. The sane and reasonable participants of this board would like to apologize to you in advance. As you can see there is a “short & distort” troll who lives on this board pretty much all day and all night, using 21+ “fake” IDs to pollute the premises with a nonstop stream of drivel and garbage, all intended to scare you away. Away from what, you might ask? A tremendous opportunity, that’s what.In short, Nektar makes a cancer immunotherapy drug (Bempeg) that works in combination with the leading cancer drugs from Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, and others to make those drugs exponentially more effective. Just Opdivo (BMY) and Keytruda (MRK) alone combine for well over $20B in annual revenue. Now think about Nektar-214 (Bempeg) being PAIRED with both those drugs as the new standard of care (SOC) when treating many different types of cancers. Bempeg, once approved, would be paired with these drugs in as much as 50% of treatment plans for the existing SOC, so $10B in revenue based on run rate of Keytruda and Opdivo alone. But get this: Bempeg unlocks the potential of these two drugs for cancer types for which they are NOT FDA-approved today. By some estimates, this is 60% of all cancers. Doing the math, that’s an additional $24B IN REVENUE unlocked by Bempeg. Add these markets together and you get $34B in annual revenue. The total cost of a treatment plan would naturally increase with Bempeg added to the SOC. By how much? Let’s be conservative and say Bempeg only commands 30% of the combined treatment plan revenue, since it’s just the “kicker”. That’s still $10B in annual revenue. Let’s be SUPER conservative and cut this in half, just for fun. At $5B in annual revenue you get earnings of say $3.5B, and with a Drug Sector P/E of 24, the math works out to an $84B market cap, or roughly $450 per share. That’s the CONSERVATIVE view. As a gut check, Merck’s P/E ratio is 26. You will see folks on this board laughed at by the shorts when they say “$1000 per share NKTR”. As you can see, this isn’t all that unreasonable. So your next question is, “Well then, why is Nektar stock so cheap, then?” Good question. A combination of bad luck and bad actors, and yes, some bad quality control, have combined to create one of the biggest opportunities in the history of mankind. Here’s the history. Back in late 2017 the stock exploded to over $100 when the Bempeg human studies showed incredible results. BMY invested $2B in Nektar. But then everything fell apart. A short attack was launched, based on the fraudulent “Plainview” report that fooled even some scientists. It was eventually disputed and exposed as fraud, but the damage was done. Nektar also announced a manufacturing error with some “bad batches” of Bempeg that impacted one or more studies. Not good. And finally, Nektar had to withdraw Nektar-181 (a non-addictive opioid candidate) from the market due to the anti-opioid political climate. Ouch. All of these things combined to bring down the stock over the next couple of years to where it sits today, with many retail investors now feeling “burned” by what happened, vowing never to touch Nektar stock again. None of this changed the underlying promise of Bempeg, however, and all the human studies continued unabated with good lots of the drug, and showing outstanding results. Enrollment in all of the studies has exploded. Meanwhile, major institutional investors swooped in and picked up the discounted shares, pried free from weak-kneed retailers with the help of the ongoing short and distort campaign that you are witnessing on this very board. These institutions (for example Invesco, whose largest holding is - you guessed it - Nektar) now own over 92% of the total float, which means it’s even easier for the shorts to manipulate the stock. Go to Seeking Alpha for articles containing detailed explanations of all of this.Where we sit now is that a major Nektar study - PROPEL - which combines Bempeg plus Keytruda, is about to be “read out” with results in the next 1-4 weeks. All the big brokerage houses and everyone else for that matter are awaiting those results. All the previous Bempeg human studies - with the exception of those impacted by the bad lot Bempeg - have all read out positively so far, so there’s no valid reason to expect anything different this time. There are still 15M+ shares short, which means a big short squeeze is coming on any positive news. The stock is low because all the institutional investors have their massive holdings in place, and the retailers are still nervous because, as mentioned earlier, they feel burned. We get it. But if they had just stopped to research the science and do the revenue math, they would have doubled or even tripled down, let alone kept their shares. Anyway, that’s the major opportunity with Nektar. The facts are the facts. Good luck."

I am also pessimistic about NKTR's delivering excellent phase 3 data next year. But I am a little more optimistic about NKTR's delivering great phase 2 data (NSCLC) b/c NKTR has clearly delivered much better data for phase 2 than phase 3. We will see. CB has no idea though she acts as if she were a know-all. She sounds like a paid pumping troll.

"CaffeinatedBioBullish9/29/21, 06:39 PM$NKTR One interesting if not earth-shattering observation is that the hedge funds and market makers are only able to manipulate the share price down when volume is extraordinarily low. Whenever there are real buyers, as we saw for the preceding 2 weeks, the 100-share algo trades differing in price by 1 cent are unable to ""adjust"" the share price sufficiently. Volume was likely low the last few days due to overall market and sector volatility. I think this is a pause en route higher. Of note -- the RCC trial updated today. 600+ patients fully enrolled with readout in the first half of 2022.

Fact #5: Howard lied about NKTR-105. He said he put it on the shelf despite its wonderful promising cancer drug b/c of insufficient fund AND he would advance NKTR-105 for further clinical development. Howard has been boasting cash position for a few years but he has not even mentioned 105!

And they will sell their NKTR sharers, which will also contribute to the crash of NKTR shares you have never seen before. Lower than $4!!!"
"Bemdivo for melanoma.The Phase 2 PIVOT-02 melanoma cohort data had 53% ORR, 34% CR, with 42% achieving 100% reduction in their target lesions.BMS took this data to the FDA and requested BTD. The FDA granted BTD.The 764 patient Phase 3 melanoma trial is ongoing and nearing the initial data readout (due in early 2022). This trial is open label and BMS knows the data. It appears BMS took this data to the FDA and said they felt this early data was good enough to support full approval.It appears the FDA reviewed this early data and told BMS to present the initial data and request full approval. It appears this data will be totally awesome and the trial could be stopped.In the last CC, JZ said that BMS is planning on filing for full approval. The September 2021 Corporate Presentation, slide number 7, shows the initial Phase 3 melanoma data is planned for ""early"" 2022. Slide number 7 also shows the RCC data and the Cis-ineligible Bladder data are planned for 1H22. This would indicate the initial Phase 3 melanoma data is planned for 1Q22.The FDA already knows the early Phase 3 melanoma data. If the FDA grants full approval based on the initial Phase 3 melanoma data, could the FDA grant it within 30 days of receiving the the initial Phase 3 melanoma data?"

"If you want to understand why the price can drop $.80 in one hour, you have to understand the role of the Market Maker(s). They want to maximize volume as that's how they are paid. Let's say they see a big order come in to buy/cover at $17.10, say 50,000 shares, when the stock is at $17.90. With a relatively illiquid stock like Nektar, all they have to do is ""work the order"" by naked shorting or selling short their own inventory and ""walk down"" the price in 100 share increments. If you look at the tape, like 25,000-30,000 shares got covered/bought in the 17.05-17.15 range within a 30 minute period. The MM doesn't care about retail investors, all they care about is filling the big orders. Are they ""in"" with the big shorts? perhaps, but really all they want to do is fill orders and they will manipulate a low float stock up or down to do it. Retail investors can capitalize on this by snatching up discounted shares."
"TheRealKlausbeckerman3 days agoIf an influential analyst openly writes this to his clients, what does it tell you about NKTR management?cr00ks!“It’s hard to tell if there’s a legitimate issue with the NKTR 214 batches or another creative way to explain away our concerns that bempeg has not been dosed to have meaningful clinical activity,” Evercore ISI analyst Josh Schimmer wrote in a Thursday note to clients."
"How much longer will Howard lie to investors like “214 is promising though N=6 data are not fully analyzed, but we will give it a pass”?"
There will be no run into SITC. I guess funds are listening to Bank of America and De-risking.
The market is telling us that Wall Street thinks this stock is fairly valued and needs to be de risked. XBI up almost 3% and NKTR is red and has been. This will be another week will it close lower than it started. Might be time to ring the register for the few that are actually having profits in this one
NKTR is delaying phase 2 data hoping that they can release the bad data hopefully with the first good phase 3 data…. All should be bad. The nktr way!
Robot clockwork ...All ya can say about today's chart..And I didn't even have to pay attention to know the results.Cheers
"Blokes, This ship can't take on more passengers, right?And the shore is not visible any longer...No one gets saved OR It's going to make it to Fantacy Island."
"Big sellers at the close on EsPR, down 10% on huge volume. Lots of sellers, everybody selling, not bagholder shortall. He bought at $43, it almost 8’s. Going to $3?"
A rumor circulating trading desks is the data would be disastrous without cherry-picking.
Close at LOD. Not good. All these posts about lawsuits and racism. Dr Lin good luck in your lawsuit
NKTRPOSyesterday$112 to $17.34! Why? Investors believe what influential analysts and Oncology KOLS's think: 214 is not as good as it was initially with a few patients and NKTR's explanation is based on data cherry-picking.We will know for sure within 6 months how good 214 is in helping Opdivo. But most likely not so good and BMY will give up filing for approval just like 102!
"FACT: $112 to $16.84! What a disaster for investors! Howard, an uncanny option trader, has sold his options at every pop starting above $90. Howard is laughing all the way to the bank."
Resistance is strong until lawsuits are settled and or new data is released.
"Why Insider Transactions Are ImportantInsider transactions shouldn't be used primarily to make an investing decision, however, they can be an important factor for an investor to consider.In legal terms, an ""insider"" refers to any shareholder who owns at least 10% of a company. This can include executives in the c-suite and large hedge funds. When a company insider makes a new purchase, that is an indication that they expect the stock to rise.Insider sells, on the other hand, can be made for a variety of reasons, and may not necessarily mean that the seller thinks the stock will go down. However our greatest and most recent example of insiders selling on bad news were the insiders at Nektar Therapeutics. Prior to horrendous results at ASCO 2017 the CEO sold almost 20 million shares of the stock before the horrendous news was released. Upon release, the stock lost 50% of its value in a day. The CEO lied during a previous CC and said those sales had nothing to do with his inside knowledge of their main drug (NKTR 214) being nothing more than a placebo."
"Placebo:Now NKTR stock price is lower than $18.51 despite a recent rise. Why? As Dr. Schimmer stated below, investors do not trust NKTR. He in essence openly stated NKTR most likely lied about reduced 214 efficacy. If you investigate NKTR's track record, you will realize he was right. Howard lied to, misled, and deceived investors for years. Recently he claimed 181 was a first class medicine to save opioid addicts and 214 was promising for COVID though they have not finished N=6 data analysis and that NKTR would not pursue 214 for COVID despite its promising clinical data. I could not believe what he said. This company has no credibility and I believe Howard should be investigated for insider trading, misleading and defrauding investors:“It’s hard to tell if there’s a legitimate issue with the NKTR 214 batches or another creative way to explain away our concerns that bempeg has not been dosed to have meaningful clinical activity,” Evercore ISI analyst Josh Schimmer wrote in a Thursday note to clients.""Physicians worried that the available NKTR-214 data looked “cherry-picked” to appear somewhat positive and that more critical numbers, such as progression-free survival, were long overdue. Moreover, a slowdown in new clinical trial sites “could point to loss of confidence among investigators,” Chen cited one physician as saying."""
NKTR appears to be hiding the P2 data....... until they get good P3 data next year
"ATTENTION ANYONE NEW TO NEKTAR (updated): Welcome to the Yahoo Message board for Nektar Therapeutics. The sane and reasonable participants of this board would like to apologize to you in advance. As you can see there is a “short & distort” troll who lives on this board pretty much all day and all night, using 21+ “fake” IDs to pollute the premises with a nonstop stream of drivel and garbage, all intended to scare you away. Away from what, you might ask? A tremendous opportunity, that’s what.In short, Nektar makes a cancer immunotherapy drug (Bempeg) that works in combination with the leading cancer drugs from Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, and others to make those drugs exponentially more effective. Just Opdivo (BMY) and Keytruda (MRK) alone combine for well over $20B in annual revenue. Now think about Nektar-214 (Bempeg) being PAIRED with both those drugs as the new standard of care (SOC) when treating many different types of cancers.Bempeg, once approved, would be paired with these drugs in as much as 50% of treatment plans for the existing SOC, so $10B in revenue based on run rate of Keytruda and Opdivo alone. But get this: Bempeg unlocks the potential of these two drugs for cancer types for which they are NOT FDA-approved today. By some estimates, this is 60% of all cancers. Doing the math, that’s an additional $24B IN REVENUE unlocked by Bempeg. Add these markets together and you get $34B in annual revenue. The total cost of a treatment plan would naturally increase with Bempeg added to the SOC. By how much? Let’s be conservative and say Bempeg only commands 30% of the combined treatment plan revenue, since it’s just the “kicker”. That’s still $10B in annual revenue. Let’s be SUPER conservative and cut this in half, just for fun. At $5B in annual revenue you get earnings of say $3.5B, and with a Drug Sector P/E of 24, the math works out to an $84B market cap, or roughly $450 per share. That’s the CONSERVATIVE view. As a gut check, Merck’s P/E ratio is 26. You will see folks on this board laughed at by the shorts when they say “$1000 per share NKTR”. As you can see, this isn’t all that unreasonable. There’s also potential for Bempeg to unlock entirely new approvals that aren’t even yet monetized by immunotherapy drugs. Not to mention $$ from Nektar's other exciting compounds.So your next question is, “Well then, why is Nektar stock so cheap, then?” Good question. A combination of bad luck and bad actors, and yes, some bad quality control, have combined to create one of the biggest opportunities in the history of mankind. Here’s the history. Back in late 2017 the stock exploded to over $100 when the Bempeg human studies showed incredible results. BMY invested $2B in Nektar. But then everything fell apart. A short attack was launched, based on the fraudulent “Plainview” report that fooled even some scientists. It was eventually exposed as fraud, but the damage was done. Nektar also announced a manufacturing error with some “bad batches” of Bempeg that impacted one or more studies. Not good. And finally, Nektar had to withdraw Nektar-181 (a non-addictive opioid candidate) from the market due to the anti-opioid political climate. Ouch. All of these things combined to bring down the stock over the next couple of years to where it sits today, with many retail investors now feeling “burned” by what happened, vowing never to touch Nektar stock again. None of this changed the underlying promise of Bempeg, however, and all the human studies continued unabated with good lots of the drug, and showing outstanding results. Enrollment in all of the studies has exploded. Meanwhile, major institutional investors swooped in and picked up the discounted shares, pried free from weak-kneed retailers with the help of the ongoing short and distort campaign that you are witnessing on this very board. These institutions (for example Invesco, whose largest holding is - you guessed it - Nektar) now own over 92% of the total float. Go to Seeking Alpha for articles containing detailed explanations of all of this.Where we sit now is that a major Nektar study - PROPEL - which combines Bempeg plus Keytruda, is about to be “read out” with results in the next 1-4 weeks. All the big brokerage houses and everyone else for that matter are awaiting those results. All the previous Bempeg human studies - with the exception of those impacted by the bad lot Bempeg - have all read out positively so far, so there’s no valid reason to expect anything different this time. There are still 15M+ shares short, which means a big short squeeze is coming on any positive news. The stock is low because all the institutional investors have their massive holdings in place, and the retailers are still nervous because, as mentioned earlier, they feel burned. We get it. But if they had just stopped to research the science and do the revenue math, they would have doubled or even tripled down, let alone kept their shares. Anyway, see you all at $250+."
Why is the one basher in the basement trying so hard?A. Fired from NKTR in 2013 or 2014 and has a severe grudgeB. Making 25 cents per post - should have graduated 8th gradeC. Short & distort fund masters whipping basher into shapeD. Bad OCD - doctor was smart to drop her as a patientE. Medications just don't work on dooooschbags F. Just being her usual $%^% selfG. All of the Above
"Someone help me here, is this new or not? Combos, duh. All it needs is 214 added to it."
"And can the short troll at least supply the name of the hedgie for whom he prostitutes himself, so that I can thank someone for this predictable trading that pays for some nice dinners this weekend? Is it Ken G. from Citadel? (Many years ago he got a $35 judgement against me for some Fedex fee when I sued his fund for trading shenanigans in a security I took a position in). Actually had to resolve that $35 judgement when selling a property years later."
"Henry6 hours agoWhen NKTR can's fully analyze a phase 1 covid trial of 6 (N = 6, six) participants in two months, how can they fully analyze a phase 2 data (N >> 6)? (it will take a few years unless the data are great w/o cherry-picking.)"
"We have started to nibble again. Nothing crazy just picking up some shares for personal account and not the Mo Money Big Baller Accts. I personally would like to get 30K shares before SITC. So if you see nibbling. Know that it is I, Nword looking to make some cash"
Our lord made another great call getting out yesterday. He is great at reading the charts and knowing which way the wind is blowing
They are waiting as long as possible to release bad 214 news hoping good 358 news
"Nktr 181 the cure,U.S. Drug Overdoses Reached Record High amid Pandemic ShutdownsBy CAROLINE DOWNEYCataldo Ambulance medics Timothy Stahl (left) and Derek Travers (right), with the help of a firefighter tend to a 38-year-old man who was found unresponsive after an opioid overdose in the Boston suburb of Mafrid.Amid a pandemic that has persisted for nearly a year and a half, reported U.S. drug overdose deaths reached a new high of 96,779 in the 12-month period that concluded in March 2021.From March 2020 to March 2021, the country experienced a surge of 29.6 percent in drug overdose fatalities, predominantly caused by opioids and secondarily caused by synthetic opioids excluding methadone, according to data published by the CDC. Before the results were released, the agency projected over 99,000 reported drug overdose deaths for this period.This past July, preliminary data from the CDC revealed that more than 93,000 people in the United States died of drug overdoses in 2020, a spike of 30 percent from 2019, when the CDC reported that 71,000 people died of an overdose.Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said then that the statistics were “chilling,” and that the pandemic “created a devastating collision of health crises in America.”Almost all 50 states saw their drug overdose death count rise significantly, with the exception of New Hampshire, New Jersey, and South Dakota, which had declines in this number. South Dakota, a Republican-controlled states that did not impose lockdowns as a COVID mitigation measure under the auspices of Governor Kristi Noem, saw a drop of 16.3 percent in its reported drug overdose deaths, the highest of any state.Meanwhile, Vermont had the steepest increase in drug overdose deaths of any state, climbing 85.1 percent from March 2020 to March 2021"
No sense looking at futures anymore if you are long NKTR. It is at an impossible resistance point and will not push through without news.
"If an influential analyst openly writes this to his clients, what does it tell you about NKTR management?cr00ks!“It’s hard to tell if there’s a legitimate issue with the NKTR 214 batches or another creative way to explain away our concerns that bempeg has not been dosed to have meaningful clinical activity,” Evercore ISI analyst Josh Schimmer wrote in a Thursday note to clients."
Howard Is Up Again Today
"Futures are flying and this turd is red. I feel until either news is released or the lawsuit by Dr. Lin is resolved, this is going nowhere.HR resign and release some good news on anything."

"What bogus trading! As others have pointed out, the 100 share walk down that occurs almost daily is so predictable. In fact today, the walk down occurred in a carbon copy pattern to Wednesday's, almost to the minute. This does allow for some ""silly"" little trading, while we're waiting for the pipeline reveals. The trading involves buying 100 share lots near the LOD (watching the walk down) and then selling a call against that 100 share purchase near the HOD (occurs with fair degree of predictability). For example buying 100@ 16.95 and either selling a call simultaneous with the purchase, a Nov. 18 strike or waiting for an intraday rise and selling a Nov 19 strike, if/when given the opportunity. Obviously, this is not the reason to hold this security, but does provide some opportunity along the way!"
