"Why in the world would some stores be open till 1am? Geez, total disregard for safety of staff relative to the minuscule dollars/sales that occur. Assuming any sale occurs! Think about about, doubt there is a beak even if cost to keep store open along with liability insurance to that of the small sales during ungodly hours! It’s not a Walmart for goodness sake’s!! I wonder if the company has any regard to the safety of the employees due to the fact they are driving home at 1-2am with all the other unsafe safe drivers (bar closers)! Seriously why would they do this???"
Pre market numbers are all over the place ...why?
In at 158.77
strong buy at this level
"hoping to reach that premarket high again before open , great ER report Rev up, Earnings up, solid guidance"
Huge beat today w great great EPS earning 120% increased...
"Great retailer with the same models as much bigger rivals TJX & Ross Stores. With only 600 and some odd stores Burl has so much more room to expand Store count. Still under developed in housewares and other home decor areas that will also increase the companies value as Store count grows. They test products in small volume not to over extend themselves and if successful they forecast those items into a basic discounted plan. Only discount retailers and on line retailers are doing well today and there will always be a hands on shopper looking for deep discount in a treasure hunt forum to keep retailers like Burl, TKX and Ross going and the proof of it is in their profits and stock performance. Not to mention that many retailers are opening discount locations in realization that these retailers are strong and doing well. Even Macy’s ( a struggling department store chain for years already like most all department store chains) are opening discount treasures hunt locations. Burl will be around and do well for many years to come as is maturer discounters like TJX and Ross.This stock needs to split. Ross has split in the 90’s many times and it has served them well for the stock goes back to the 90’s and splits again so Burl needs to do the same."
"Burlington Stores Earnings Mixed, But Stock Signals Breakout...Going to $240 soon, at least up by $230 today.."
Burlington Stores is up .37% to 298.61
I guess shareholders really don't like the current CEO.
Earnings should beat but it's the corona-virus guidance that is scary. Look at Ross. Hold or sell?
"Even after the massive run BURL has had, plenty of upside still remains. Cost headwinds may persist over the rest of this year, but the simple fact is that sales and earnings growth potential are remarkable. In addition to that BURL is decreasing the size of its stores, and currently plans to expand the store count from 784 to 2000. Higher sales per square foot will increase margins dramatically. Inventory currently is flying off the shelves. The debt the company carries on its books is concerning, but leverage is an acceptable 3.08. Overall with the economy reopening BURL should fare quite well. My price target is $400, implying 25 percent upside from here. The company's margins for the quarter outranked its peers, and on a chart BURL has had superior performance to ROST as well. I believe that shrinking their stores, the project titled Burlington 2.0, is a massive tailwind. There really isn't a bear case to be made here."
"BURL shorts' only hopes for ever making serious money again is if Burlington 2.0 blows up in the company's face, which is extremely unlikely is this strategy has succeeded with other companies. Other scenarios in which shorts would do well would be if there is another economic shutdown, also which is incredibly unlikely. To cement my case that BURL is a great investment despite a lofty multiple, which will contract over time as earnings growth catches up with the price, BURL has better gross margins than the competition and also great free cash flow return on investment. I know I'm going to get attacked for all this but at this point there is literally almost no hope of the bears winning the battle here."
"Virtually no comments on an ER day? 3 comments in a month? No one cares about this stock, it would seem."
Not a lot of conversations about this stock
Trying to process the increase in share price and having no success...
above 227 is a good sell ..it might reach 230 ......so put stop limit 226.50
Every time I walk into the store it is packed. This will blow out expectations in the next 2 quarters. Go to a store and see for urself. Still at pre COVID levels.
"I fail to understand BURL shorts. THey were calling for this to crash in the 170s and clearly they were wrong. I also saw claims that there are no customers in Burlington's stores, yet I drove by the Burlington's near where I live the other day and saw customers in there. Clearly people on here are misinformed. Now that vaccines are on the way shorts are sitting ducks for pain. Betting against this market in general is suicide right now. About the only thing that can send it down is incompetent Washington politicians but even then the decline is short lived and it was up today anyway. You shorts need to move onto other stocks. BURL isn't going down the toilet like you all are claiming."
"My next major Earnings play is going to be GES. Yes, she is overvalued technically. But all of my research shows that she SHOULD beat the consensus on both EPS and Revenue. If that happens, she SHOULD go up. This is the best time for Consumer Discretionary stocks. Trends are very good for GES. Growth is a concern, but the stock is being heavily shorted right now, which is a positive when EPS and Revenue consensus are beaten. If things work out as I think they will, this baby SHOULD go up. PS: Notice all of my SHOULDS, because I am unfortunately only right about 70-75% of the time. :-)"
"Burl doesn't have an online presence; the stores have been closed for more than 3 months, how is it possible that it's trading at this level? Stock must be trading using AI algorithm."
When is their earnings.. anyone
Executives have been selling their stock Non-Stop... not one exec has bought a stock this year.. they started the quarter with no inventory I seen it with my own eyes... store traffic seems slow.. and they have no online presence because they had no inventory
Visited several Burlington locations. Things are going down hill. Empty store. Low staffing. Low customer traffic. Have a look: https://imgur.com/gallery/bYX3n13
"BURL's debt is large but it's not a danger to the company. With revenue, EBITDA, and FCF all on the way back to normal levels and for growth in all of those expected to resume, BURL should easily be able to pay off any debt that would be coming due. Leverage will decline as the years pass assuming no more pandemics or economic shutdowns. The current concerns bears have are basically outdated. The pandemic is coming close to its conclusion, the economy is largely open again, most of BURL's stores are open with plenty of foot traffic, etc. You should've been buying in May of 2020, not liquidating your positions. I bought a large number of shares of BURL recently. The company is headed in the right direction with plans to open many new stores and reduce its square foot per sales per store. Overall this company should do extremely well going forward and anyone with a brain likes the company here."
"LOL, looking at the comments from the beginning of the pandemic, I see so many people saying BURL was finished. After today's report I would beg to differ. Discount retailers will do will on economic reopening. This stock is far from finished. I bought in the 170s and those who want to say that was a bad idea are now finding themselves backed into a corner. Great company, great story. Going above 300 soon."
Burlington Stores is down 8.50% to 320.37
"Just bought $10k worth of shares, and $2500 in Calls. Looking for this to pop after Earnings in the morning."
sold 126.50 ......now hunting for new er stock ..well done guys ..
Results: Burlington Stores earnings per share rose 28% to $1.55 with revenue up nearly 9% to $1.77 billion. Same-store sales climbed 2.7%
Massive equity dilution coming for this stock. A ton of convertible notes and bonds issued for this company. It’s the only way they’re staying afloat. This is the future of bankruptcy: companies default on their bonds and the market cap for their stock increases even though its losing value!!!
"As they said in the last Q report:Share Repurchase..... The Company’s Board of Directors recently authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of common stock, which is authorized to be executed through August 2023."
"The first 15 minutes of the regular session should be interesting. Expecting lots of volume, lots of interested buyers, but also some profit-taking, especially since this should open at a brand new 52 week high. Add to that the fact that the shopping season starts this week and lots of investors are drawn to this sector right about now, and add the fact that the actual earnings results are absolutely bullish, and you get a recipe for a lot of potential volatility, much higher volume than normal, and a very good chance of a serious pop up at some point during the day, that MAYBE will not hold all the way to the close. I'm sticking with my $120.00 Limit Sell."
increased stop limit to 225 ...as it is more than 10 percent rise .....lets see
"135 is the bottom, this thing is going to go up. really slow buy may touch 150 regardless of the market movement. This thing is prime and ready. If i had 100k I would buy at 135 and hold it for a month or two and make 10% return off this thing."
"The analysts supporting this BURL should probably do some of their own due diligence. Every retailer is hurting - even those with online and product to sell. This is not a tech stock, it should be valued on its earnings potential. If you walk into a store, you can feel the potential (or lack)"
"Time to unload,get short on this one for next few wks"
UPDATE: Burlington Stores (BURL) saw its price target increased to $242 from $237 by notable retail analyst Matthew Boss of J.P. Morgan.
"In 1980, the DJIA peaked on Feb. 12/13, dove 8 - 10% into late-Feb., and experienced an overall 20+% plunge into March ’80 - when it spiked to new multi-year lows before setting a March ’80 low. In 2020, the DJIA peaked on Feb. 12/13, dove 8 - 10% into late-Feb., and experienced an overall 20+% plunge into March ’20 - when it spiked to new multi-year lows on March 12/13.The Dow Industrial s and S+P 500 plunged toward their corresponding levels (19,989/DJIA & 2360/ESM) but bottomed slightly higher after the DJIA encountered multi-year support at the Dec. 2018 low (~21,700). That means they have fulfilled most/all of their downside potential for this time period."
"Just put a Limit Buy on GES, 2400 shares at $19.00. Looks like I will have to get lucky to be filled at that price, but we still have 2 hours and she is acting strong, so a dip far below $19.00 is now unlikely to occur, IMO."
