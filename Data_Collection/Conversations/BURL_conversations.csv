Long and strong lets hope im right.
"""no inventory"" is jumping off the shelves"
"BURL shorts' only hopes for ever making serious money again is if Burlington 2.0 blows up in the company's face, which is extremely unlikely is this strategy has succeeded with other companies. Other scenarios in which shorts would do well would be if there is another economic shutdown, also which is incredibly unlikely. To cement my case that BURL is a great investment despite a lofty multiple, which will contract over time as earnings growth catches up with the price, BURL has better gross margins than the competition and also great free cash flow return on investment. I know I'm going to get attacked for all this but at this point there is literally almost no hope of the bears winning the battle here."
Burlington has no merchandise to sell and no restocking goods. Corporate is closing the stores all over USA. The stock price is over 200. It is a Joke stock. I believe that there is a scam going on Burlington to steal investors' money. ZACK is fooling people to buy the stock. They are trying to help their big guys to come out with their money by selling the stock to the retail investors.
"I sold my shares yesterday,what keeps this stock up?Is someone going after its empty stores,i know we have one in a nice location."
"135 is the bottom, this thing is going to go up. really slow buy may touch 150 regardless of the market movement. This thing is prime and ready. If i had 100k I would buy at 135 and hold it for a month or two and make 10% return off this thing."
230 soon
Results: Burlington Stores earnings per share rose 28% to $1.55 with revenue up nearly 9% to $1.77 billion. Same-store sales climbed 2.7%
Do people normally take profits at the open ?
"It's interesting how DKS has also trended up strongly for the entire day. Anybody who played that one in the pre-market or right at the open, would be in great shape right now too. It opened at $43.91 and is now just off the high for the day, at $47.49, up almost 21% from the 4 PM close yesterday."

"As they said in the last Q report:Share Repurchase..... The Company’s Board of Directors recently authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of common stock, which is authorized to be executed through August 2023."
Would back away and buy later in $140s
"The analysts supporting this BURL should probably do some of their own due diligence. Every retailer is hurting - even those with online and product to sell. This is not a tech stock, it should be valued on its earnings potential. If you walk into a store, you can feel the potential (or lack)"
BURL is down 6.17% to 201.02
think it goes down Monday
above 227 is a good sell ..it might reach 230 ......so put stop limit 226.50
multiple upgrades target price 239 ........
"Continuing to break to the upside, lots of buyers bidding it up pre-market. Looking very strong! I think the outstanding earnings report by DKS today, is really helping BURL a lot. Think about it: DKS is sporting goods. 100% consumer discretionary. Nobody HAS to have new golf clubs or a weightlifting machine. On the other hand, BURL sells consumer NECESSITIES like coats. You NEED a coat in the winter! If the consumer is so strong on discretionaries, you can bet he will be nuying a LOT of necessities. So, the great numbers for DKS directly influence the bullish forecast for BURL. I think $120+ is now looking likely for today."
Anyone know why the jump today?
Why is this dropping ?
"Look at BURL, trying to push back up to $228, impressive day for the company..."
When is their earnings.. anyone

Every time I walk into the store it is packed. This will blow out expectations in the next 2 quarters. Go to a store and see for urself. Still at pre COVID levels.

"Out at $220 with a very nice gain on 300 shares. Good luck folks, could go higher still. :-)"
Horrible earnings
is today's selloff an indication of the insider info that just might be spreading through the market...someplace?
what happened
Burlington Stores is down 4.92% to 313.01
"EPS was $2.83, above the FactSet consensus of $2.77. Total revenue rose 2.8% to $2.00 billion. Seems like a good buying opportunity here."
Back up the truck for this baby...strong buy!
i lived in NJ for 2 years and everyone and their mothers shop here. Always packed
time to call?
UVXY is a go at $24.20.. GOLD higher from yesterday
Own options for first time. Need a good report. 
Going to bounce. That was the bottom
160 is support for Burl when markets take a breather.
Burlington Stores is up 6.01% to 267.39
I guess shareholders really don't like the current CEO.
stop limit 126.50
"Burlington is going to file bankruptcy... they are closing down their store. I went to the store, I don't see any merchandise or planing to restocking at all. They have already closed a number of stores. it is another Htz."
"My next major Earnings play is going to be GES. Yes, she is overvalued technically. But all of my research shows that she SHOULD beat the consensus on both EPS and Revenue. If that happens, she SHOULD go up. This is the best time for Consumer Discretionary stocks. Trends are very good for GES. Growth is a concern, but the stock is being heavily shorted right now, which is a positive when EPS and Revenue consensus are beaten. If things work out as I think they will, this baby SHOULD go up. PS: Notice all of my SHOULDS, because I am unfortunately only right about 70-75% of the time. :-)"
congrats for all .......bought 300 at 207.85 yesterday and 200 at 203 in dip morning ......
Let the upgrades commence!!
Tanking tomorrow so be ready We will see below 130 tomorrow

"BURL's debt is large but it's not a danger to the company. With revenue, EBITDA, and FCF all on the way back to normal levels and for growth in all of those expected to resume, BURL should easily be able to pay off any debt that would be coming due. Leverage will decline as the years pass assuming no more pandemics or economic shutdowns. The current concerns bears have are basically outdated. The pandemic is coming close to its conclusion, the economy is largely open again, most of BURL's stores are open with plenty of foot traffic, etc. You should've been buying in May of 2020, not liquidating your positions. I bought a large number of shares of BURL recently. The company is headed in the right direction with plans to open many new stores and reduce its square foot per sales per store. Overall this company should do extremely well going forward and anyone with a brain likes the company here."
"Just bought $10k worth of shares, and $2500 in Calls. Looking for this to pop after Earnings in the morning."
"Also long 100 shares of DELL at $53.35, a small hedge against my heavy position in GES. Well, I'm outta here for good, might post over at the GES board later. Good luck to all! :-)"

"As I told you guys yesterday, this stock is primed for a breakout, all the technicals looked good, the ER is solid, look for this to hit $220. Don't get greedy."
Huge beat today w great great EPS earning 120% increased...
"Meanwhile, DELL is down over 2% for the day and I like her a lot, only SLIGHTLY Less than GES. I think she WILL easily beat on EPS, and even if Revenue only comes in-line with the consensus, a pop up in stock price is likely...So...Still waiting for GES to settle down, and honestly I do not want to pay more than $19.00 for her... I want that fill at $19.00. Gonna be patient for one more hour."
"I am going to hold, they paid out earnings, made a profit and the market took them to the cleaners, lol, what a country, looking at the balance sheet for the last three years they are a win win win, YOY this company is a buy in my book, to me it is the retail of Amazon, it took a beating yesterday, but I am buying more and holding tight"
"Still no fill on GES, and now comes a difficult decision. Should I pay more for GES than I want to pay? Only 10-15 cents a share? No, it adds up, it increases my loss if I'm wrong on the play, and limits my profits if I'm right on the play. Meanwhile, DELL is still down 2+% and offers a better-looking possibility, if I'm right, more upside potential, if I'm wrong, less downside risk...So, I have to decide...Maybe adjust my percentage and still play both..."
BURL reached a 52 Week low at 120.45
"Great retailer with the same models as much bigger rivals TJX & Ross Stores. With only 600 and some odd stores Burl has so much more room to expand Store count. Still under developed in housewares and other home decor areas that will also increase the companies value as Store count grows. They test products in small volume not to over extend themselves and if successful they forecast those items into a basic discounted plan. Only discount retailers and on line retailers are doing well today and there will always be a hands on shopper looking for deep discount in a treasure hunt forum to keep retailers like Burl, TKX and Ross going and the proof of it is in their profits and stock performance. Not to mention that many retailers are opening discount locations in realization that these retailers are strong and doing well. Even Macy’s ( a struggling department store chain for years already like most all department store chains) are opening discount treasures hunt locations. Burl will be around and do well for many years to come as is maturer discounters like TJX and Ross.This stock needs to split. Ross has split in the 90’s many times and it has served them well for the stock goes back to the 90’s and splits again so Burl needs to do the same."
BURL is up 6.35% to 145.20

"I wonder who's a more reliable source to listen to, StockGuru or Zacks? I'm sure he'll downplay Zacks but the real experts are very bullish on BURL. BURL 2.0 is executing fantastically, and the smaller stores will dramatically increase revenue per square foot among other metrics. You want invest in TJX, which has had practically no growth for a long time, or ROST, which has had much more modest growth than BURL be my guest. BURL has better margins than either of those names. I am glad I bought in recently. Those who think BURL can't do well with the economy open don't get that the economy being closed is actually what is bad for them, not an open economy. I know I'll get thumbs downed like mad but only a fool dislikes this company. The bear case is growing weaker by the day. The time to be bearish was May 2020. That has long since passed. People who have been short since 177 are bleeding from the rectum. It's only going to get worse if they don't cover. I have access to research the vast majority of people on here do not have. Sure it has a PE of 70, however earnings growth over the next year is expected to be in excess of 400 percent. Somebody is going to have to lay out a convincing thesis that BURL is a ticking time bomb for longs because nothing I'm reading shows that. It does however show that BURL still remains a time bomb for the shorts."
"Still looks very solid, just consolidating a little. My $223.00 Limit Buy failed to fill. I'm tempted to chase her with a $126 limit buy here, but not gonna do it. Gonna try $225, get back in only if she pulls back to that price..."

"Trying to get back in at $221.00 for some icing on the cake, but might not get a fill..."

"Why in the world would some stores be open till 1am? Geez, total disregard for safety of staff relative to the minuscule dollars/sales that occur. Assuming any sale occurs! Think about about, doubt there is a beak even if cost to keep store open along with liability insurance to that of the small sales during ungodly hours! It’s not a Walmart for goodness sake’s!! I wonder if the company has any regard to the safety of the employees due to the fact they are driving home at 1-2am with all the other unsafe safe drivers (bar closers)! Seriously why would they do this???"

"hoping to reach that premarket high again before open , great ER report Rev up, Earnings up, solid guidance"
Pre market numbers are all over the place ...why?
This stock continues to roar higher despite Doug's protests. Maybe one day he'll pack his bags and head for home. I expect this stock to hit 400 long term. Economic reopening is on the horizon and that is extremely fertile soil for BURL.
We may see $200+ after earnings ...BURL is going to beat by a wide margin .The market cap is only $11B compared to TJX ROSt etc lots of runway ...buy before earnings and after too.
"yikes, whats up with the pre market drop?"
buying opportunity.
"In 1980, the DJIA peaked on Feb. 12/13, dove 8 - 10% into late-Feb., and experienced an overall 20+% plunge into March ’80 - when it spiked to new multi-year lows before setting a March ’80 low. In 2020, the DJIA peaked on Feb. 12/13, dove 8 - 10% into late-Feb., and experienced an overall 20+% plunge into March ’20 - when it spiked to new multi-year lows on March 12/13.The Dow Industrial s and S+P 500 plunged toward their corresponding levels (19,989/DJIA & 2360/ESM) but bottomed slightly higher after the DJIA encountered multi-year support at the Dec. 2018 low (~21,700). That means they have fulfilled most/all of their downside potential for this time period."
Earnings should beat but it's the corona-virus guidance that is scary. Look at Ross. Hold or sell?

"nothing, someone's with alot of shares trying to influence the market"
Guys - I hope that you are not losing your money. This thieves CEO and executives are out there to steal people's money. I decided to short and get some money out from them.
"I fail to understand BURL shorts. THey were calling for this to crash in the 170s and clearly they were wrong. I also saw claims that there are no customers in Burlington's stores, yet I drove by the Burlington's near where I live the other day and saw customers in there. Clearly people on here are misinformed. Now that vaccines are on the way shorts are sitting ducks for pain. Betting against this market in general is suicide right now. About the only thing that can send it down is incompetent Washington politicians but even then the decline is short lived and it was up today anyway. You shorts need to move onto other stocks. BURL isn't going down the toilet like you all are claiming."
"In normal times during an economic downturn, discount stores like TJ, Burl and Walmart thrive. Add Covid to the situation, those with online are going to thrive more. How many people are going to want to jam into a brick and mortar store"
Burlington Stores is down 4.95% to 197.71
BURL has so much potential it's not even funny. Bought this a few days ago and have been rewarded with 20 percent plus gains. This stock will soar once consumers come flooding back in.
Taking my profits now.
Trying to process the increase in share price and having no success...
"I just spent $1000 on macy online sale. Its flash sale is 60 to 70% off, cheaper than Burlington.."
BURL is down 5.75% to $147.59
Bought this at the market bottom of the pandemic. I hope the shorts have enjoyed this massive rally lol there's more pain ahead.
1million shares right after close.
Looks like we sold too soon
Executives have been selling their stock Non-Stop... not one exec has bought a stock this year.. they started the quarter with no inventory I seen it with my own eyes... store traffic seems slow.. and they have no online presence because they had no inventory
well done ER woooow ...
"Here we go, popping up now, lots of bullish buyers in on this one, breaking out to a new 52 week high at the open..."
"Consolidating here at $217, still looks fine, more upside likely..."
well thats some #%#%@&@& bul#%@$
a zombi stock.
I believe Burlington is the next retail store to go bankrupt. Amazon is king
Stock sure is doing well but was in one last week. Seemed like a Kmart to me.
Do not you think the selling is over extended ?
"Already hit $217, trying to break higher...."

BURL reached a new All Time High at 151.86
"Even after the massive run BURL has had, plenty of upside still remains. Cost headwinds may persist over the rest of this year, but the simple fact is that sales and earnings growth potential are remarkable. In addition to that BURL is decreasing the size of its stores, and currently plans to expand the store count from 784 to 2000. Higher sales per square foot will increase margins dramatically. Inventory currently is flying off the shelves. The debt the company carries on its books is concerning, but leverage is an acceptable 3.08. Overall with the economy reopening BURL should fare quite well. My price target is $400, implying 25 percent upside from here. The company's margins for the quarter outranked its peers, and on a chart BURL has had superior performance to ROST as well. I believe that shrinking their stores, the project titled Burlington 2.0, is a massive tailwind. There really isn't a bear case to be made here."
Waiting for 220 
the other discounters that can be compared to burl have seemed to hit a soft patch and have reported just average numbers. that will likely happen here tomorrow and the result from that is unknown. Don't think it will move up much.
BURL reached a new All Time High at 145.20
"Coming to $220 now, it will hit! :-)"
"The first 15 minutes of the regular session should be interesting. Expecting lots of volume, lots of interested buyers, but also some profit-taking, especially since this should open at a brand new 52 week high. Add to that the fact that the shopping season starts this week and lots of investors are drawn to this sector right about now, and add the fact that the actual earnings results are absolutely bullish, and you get a recipe for a lot of potential volatility, much higher volume than normal, and a very good chance of a serious pop up at some point during the day, that MAYBE will not hold all the way to the close. I'm sticking with my $120.00 Limit Sell."
"Looking good...Down a little at the open, a few profit-takers, but now come a surge of buyers, bidding it up..."
1 day chart on GOLD looks amazing if it bottoms here. Jumping in with both feet. 30 day trade
Not a lot of conversations about this stock
Good for u harringo that u bought BURL to balance out loss. Too scared to buy Dell now as much as I want to. Watching for now.
Not safe It broke the support level The next support level is 120It’s will keep bleeding
"If she can break $228.00 here, there might be enough momentum to push her to $230.00..."

"Went long in the pre-market at $111.00. A little late for the party, but put a $120.00 Limit Sell on her for the day. I think she should trend up as the day progresses, so will get out with some profit at 3:30 Eastern, even if she doesn't pop all the way to $220."
"LOL, looking at the comments from the beginning of the pandemic, I see so many people saying BURL was finished. After today's report I would beg to differ. Discount retailers will do will on economic reopening. This stock is far from finished. I bought in the 170s and those who want to say that was a bad idea are now finding themselves backed into a corner. Great company, great story. Going above 300 soon."

BURL Price Target with these Great Blow Out earnings is at least $220. So really the share price should be closer to $210 at this point.
Chart looks solid. Looking for breakout at 167.40.
Massive equity dilution coming for this stock. A ton of convertible notes and bonds issued for this company. It’s the only way they’re staying afloat. This is the future of bankruptcy: companies default on their bonds and the market cap for their stock increases even though its losing value!!!

"BURL is planning to file bankruptcy guys. I am not lying at all. Go to their store, they are selling merchandise cheaper than manufacturing cost. They don't want to pay their supplier and store rent. They want to eat the investor's money. Please visit the there, literally there is no merchandise."
