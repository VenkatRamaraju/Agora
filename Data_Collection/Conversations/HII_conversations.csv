First time buyer today at $143. I have been watching this one for a long time.
Holding GD KTOS LMT RTX HII for defense stocks
Glad I decided to buy at $160 even though it had just climbed from $140. Lol
"HII is a great company. One of the safest, undervalue and good potential stocks I can see."
Why are analysts predicting a 50% drop in earnings next year? HII has a huge backlog and the same analyst are predicting a slight increase in revenue. Why would expenses be so much higher?
Huntington Ingalls Industries is down 4.93% to 202.01
"Have beliefs, with $4.56/share and more dividend, And more backlog defense contracts to build ships and carrier and maintenance, the defense will fly to new higher"
Would prefer they take their cash and reinvest in development and growth rather than dividends.
Feeling good about this stock. The current administration is modernizing the military. Earnings beat on Thursday and $280 by the end of the year.
"Big day SO FAR for us suffering Longs. Let's hope we keep the gains and advance going forward. This is the ONLY company in the country that can make Carriers, PERIOD!"
"Load up on real companies at reasonable PE ‘s, HII, LMT,NOC,LMT,for the future of America security and defense, added to my holdings on Veterans Day for a tight hold ."
Finished building my position today. Average price $152. Glad to be aboard with you longs. Can’t believe it is down here. This is a wide moat company and the G pays their bills- maybe late sometimes- but they always pay. Been around job contracting for 30 years and HII is about as good as you get. Honored to finally own this directly as opposed thru ITA which is how I owned it previously. Best value in this entire market I believe.
"I was asking just that yesterday. There are some revised price targets that put this UP TO $225, but there are some also that have us at the analyst price targets right now. When I checked earnings estimates per share for 2021 ($12.29/share) and 2022 ($14.63/share) they are lower than they were in 2020 ($17.14/share). We are also above the 5yr average for PE Currently at 16x forward earnings and the average is 10x. Which in part is due to the broad based value rotation. In the medium to long term price of this stock, I wonder if the continued upside is limited. Unless we get some big earnings estimates revisions for this year and next I don't know what the catalyst would be to keep us trending higher? Increasing bond yields and inflation expectations?"
"Insider selling took this down before earnings, and insiders keep selling it now. How do I know? The stock was way down even though analysts had great expectations!"
"Good Q3 report, but the stock goes down. What is going on?"
Boom! Huge earnings beat: +28.27%. I wish I would have picked up more shares earlier this week. $280 before the end of the year.
Whisper GD wants HII ?
"Time to buy more today, I think :)"
good quarter for HII considering impacts of Covid! going to be even better in the upcoming ones. looking for price target upgrades soon. big backlog of work ahead! Go HII!
Under 200$ this is a steal
