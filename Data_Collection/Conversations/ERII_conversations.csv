Merry Xmas to all the longs!!!
New trademark: Modular Vorteqhttps://trademark.trademarkia.com/modular-vorteq-88402632.html
"Very good call with some caveats.Projecting 20% revenue growth for 2020. Margins will be reduced due to China tariffs. Supply chain OK for now. They use some parts from China, but so far no disruption. No disruption from virus as yet.Expect Vorteq testing at live well with Liberty. Seems they are trying to test at Liberty customer's well.Here's the big one. They expect to complete M1 this year. I'll believe it when I see it, but Mr. Mao stated it. They apparently have made a lot of progress in thisNo news on CEO"
Correct me if I'm wrong. Market cap is about $500 million. Cash is approx. $100 million. That means the market is valuating the company at $400 million or about $7.50 a share. I would think the water business is worth at least that much as it continues to make money and generate cash
"Interesting thought... If there's any Liberty investor's out there, get on Liberty's CC's and ask about the Vorteq on those calls. Would probably be more insightful as they aren't handcuffed by the Schlumberger deal and can talk more openly."
Looks to me like good entry today. Been watching for a while. Long.
Actually a good conference call today. The VorTeq works. Testing (so far) exceeded pre-set parameters. The issue soundslike one with an easy fix. Stock price should move to over $10.00 soon. This was a very good place for the short sellers tocover. Mr Joel Gay handled this very well.
Look good. Who care about Vorteq and Mteq. Water business alone had already work lot more than the current price.
that's one bullish presentation. they finally shed light on what has been done with vorteq. looks like mteq could be a monster too and they own 100% of that. stock is a no-brainer from here.
At least now I won't need a thesaurus for the earning calls
"Looks like good news. No real disruptions in their manufacturing. Wonder why big drop the past 2 days.https://ir.energyrecovery.com/download/companies/energyrecover/AnnualMeetingPresentations/COVID-19%20Investor%20and%20Analyst%20Update%20-%20May%2027,%202020.pdf"
New investor presentation was posted today. I did not notice anything new but a very good presentation for potential new investors: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1421517/000142151720000093/ex991-investorpresentati.htm
"Great news today, apparently not the news ( Milestone 1 ) that people were hoping for. Very nice to have these contracts to take care of the bills. Usually they have a water announcement just before the earnings report, maybe this qtr they will have some other news : )"

"I have no investment here at the moment, just came to check it out. Mostly because water is the one commodity that every one is missing as the world's number one need going forward - especially clean water (potable). Oil is not a big issue right now, nor is natural gas, nuclear energy, and solar. There is plenty of energy opportunities available to everyone, but water that presents a thirsty planet with real problems and it is getting worst near term and will only worsen long term. Already many sources are becoming suspect due to pollution and with many glacial melts no longer able to sustain future sourcing, it gives me pause to suspect any company that holds patents on deriving water from the oceans probably is in bargain territory right now, but won't stay there for long. This company seems to be in that category. If anyone who reads this post knows others please leave replies, I plan on investing heavily in this overlooked landscape. I could care less if their Vorteq works or not, I see lots of upside in the clean water business period. I think they should pay attention to their core business it seems to be doing quite well without deviating and wasting shareholder equity in dubious technology that the oil companies really don't need. The only reason prices have risen in the oil patch is players controlling supply. If they keep doing that then solar, wind and nuclear will be getting a subsidy from their actions, simply because they will be cheaper alternatives."
I know they have a buyback plan in place. I can’t imagine that is causing this kind of increase.
"""News"" this morning, announcement of Annual Meeting. That is not really news, but, having received an ""A"" in Psychology I found the very first line of the announcement very interesting: ""The Annual Meeting will include an update on the development of Energy Recovery's VorTeq technology"". Yes maybe I am reading to much into this because I own way to much of ERII from a ""portfolio"" view. But why would you have that line as your very first statement unless you had positive news? https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-recovery-announces-2021-annual-120000334.html"
"""Energy Recovery (NASDAQ:ERII) Price Target Increased to $23.00 by Analysts at Raymond James "". My guess would be that Raymond James would be the firm with the closest ties to ERII, and to potential Vorteq news. The Annual Meeting, June 10th, will be here before you know it. My guess is that it will be good news on Vorteq. I think the only reason that they are extending it the couple of months like they have done is because of very favorable test results on the prior fracks."
Annual Meeting tomorrow. I wonder if they will have any news for us. Time will tell.
"Aside from obviously hoping everyone's safe and well, hopefully the hurricane didn't damage the new Katy facility. The last time there was a big storm the MTeq development in Houston experienced delays."
Any day now...
"Yesterday I spoke to IR. My hope is that ERII receives that $25 million from SLB this year. That would re-ignite confidence that SLB is fully on board and committed to the VorTeq. The second $25 million would be in 2018. Keep in mind that it is SLB that pulls the trigger on getting the VorTeq into the field and those units would have to be built first. The sooner that ERII gets the $50 million the sooner SLB can get the units built. The M-Teq is still in the testing phase. I wonder if anyone on this boardcan estimate when it will go commercial? If ERII can get SLB to begin using the VorTeq in 2018, the stock price should moveup into the low 20's. If ERII can get sales rolling in their other areas we should hit the high 20's."
"Here is what is going on with Vorteq...What already happened: ERII attempted M1 testing at SLB's facility. They exerienced some wear on the carbide caps of the pressure exchanger cartridges. That carbide was a softer alloy because ERII was worried about system vibration cracking harder alloys. The vibration issue was eliminated so ERII moved to a harder carbide cap (as well as other components) but machining the compenents took time.During that time SLB closed the facility for rennovation & moved much of the equipment/personnel to revenue generating field work (this was not communicated by ERII mgmt, but, trust me).New info: ERII/SLB had a steering committee meeting regarding Vorteq. During that meeting ERII expressed a desire to move ahead with M1 testing and SLB demurred (because the people are elsewhere, the equipment is elsewhere). ERII said, 'What can we do to pull the schedule back?' SLB said, 'Well, between M1 and M2 you have to do A,B, & C. Between M2 and full commercialization you have to do X & Y. Why don't you do A,B,C,X & Y now while we pretend we're getting the facility ready for M1 testing?'So ERII are implementing those changes now. They will not communicate what those changes are, when they will be implemented, or even if they have been implemented.In the meantime, ERII have moved the Vorteq missile out of the SLB facility and onto an LBRT facility. ERII would like to continue testing on a well but so far have not found a partner that wants to accept the time and risk of testing a new technology.Bottom line: my observation that SLB has turned tepid on the Vorteq technology only seems to be reinforced by SLB's recent behaviour. Seems like SLB have decided a bird in hand is worth some integer multiple of bird in the field generating certain revenue.Now, GOOD NEWS!, sounds like things are going to slow down in the Permian because there won't be enough pipeline capacity in 1h19. That may be ERII best shot at finding a partner willing to help them continue testing the Vorteq missile. Or day we say verify the Vorteq missile? Unfortunately, sounds like M1/M2 payments are off the table for 2018 for sure & probably for the 'foreseeable future' in reality. Based on what I hear, SLB is unlikely to provide any further support for Vorteq testing...M1, M2 or otherwise. Of course, that can be subject to change depending on market conditions...but let's face facts: SLB took down the site, moved out the equipment, and re-assigned the people."
"In early March, we deployed the VorTeq at a live well with one of the largest independent oil producers in the U.S., a key step towards demonstrating the value proposition of the product and ensuring readiness for commercial deployment. We continue to work on the other critical hurdle for profitable commercialization - extending the service life of the VorTeq cartridges."""
I think the shelf is good news.The company doesn't need the cash and large holders can sell at this time if they want.I believe that the shelf is being put into place so the company and large holders can do a secondary AFTER the vorteq gets 1st or 2nd milestone payments. You can bet that the stock will bolt into the 20s shortly after that happens. The stock will close near 27 at some point and afterhours it will dip two points on the news that the company and selling stockholders did a 2mm secondary in which the company only gets 10% and selling stockholders get 90%.I my opinion... this means that a successful vorteq test is in the near future.Thank You Mr. Market
"To this end, Ron Gusek, President of Liberty, graciously offered to allow me to share his thoughts on the recent testing: “We are excited about the results we’ve seen in Texas and we are working with Energy Recovery and our customers to move the VorTeq to a live well. During the most recent field tests we have been able to better appreciate the potential of the VorTeq and its ability to be integrated into the existing frac spreads. Notably, the VorTeq demonstrated it will not interrupt operations and can continue to perform if faced with upset conditions such as the stopping and restarting of an individual frac pump in the system.”"
"I wouldn't go as far as Jan, when he said in his Seeking Alpha article, that the Schlum deal falling apart was the best thing that could have happened. But, I'm sort of seeing his side now. Initially when the announcement was made, I was really bummed as that licensing deal, if nothing else, would have validated the technology. Seeing how poorly Schlum is doing now, even if they followed thru with the M1/M2 payments, Schlum could have literally just sat on the Vorteq with no intention of ever deploying it. That would have been a worst case scenario as Liberty's carve out was only 20 Vorteq units and that would be it. ERII would then have to pay a pretty penny, potentially even more than the combined $50 mil M1/M2 payments, to buy out of the exclusivity to bring it to the broader market. Maybe that is what Mao was eluding to when we said they had differing visions of how to move forward with the Vorteq and that walking away was the best case. Earlier in the year, I believe Mao said the goal was to commercialize by end of 2020. Let's hope this time next week during the conference call, ERII reports that they found some candidate wells to do the frack test on.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-shrinking-staff-lowest-since-115450224.html"
"Mteq yard test is going well, sounds like.Look for an announcement regarding field testing partner/location later this year. That will also be a big thing although the market hasn't contemplated it yet."
"TTEK is buying into water engineering business, maybe desalination?"
"Milestone 1 aside, seems like a lot of the recent buzz centers around Liberty rather than Schlumberger."
"From the earning script: "" In terms of Oil & Gas, yes, we established our Katy facility specifically to manufacture our Pressure Exchangers, the core to the VorTeq technology in Katy, Texas. So that's the facility -- I think when you saw -- when you were there, you were seeing it being built or it was very, very far along there, and we're going to turn that on in terms of manufacturing very shortly ""Look like loaf of money will be coming in to ERII soon."
"Here's the competition. Intuitively, it makes sense. In practice, like many things, can be different story. Unfortunately, Vorteq is the perfect example. Time will tell whether this solar dome will bear fruit.https://interestingengineering.com/solar-domes-could-desalinate-seawater-at-a-commercial-scale"
"Well, the quarterly report didn't really show much progress, but at least in conference call management seems like they have a grip on what they are doing and are taking proactive steps to ensure they can test vorteq in a more timely fashion on the way to commercialization. They didn't really give a clear answer on whether there still needs to be significant design or material improvements to get the vorteq operational. other than to say they need log more mileage in testing under real world conditions. To my mind, and completely subjective thing, at least the management sounds like they speak confidently and pragmatically about plans and progress, unlike under previous CEO management."
"New 8k out after the close, ""Harder grade showed no signs of material degredation despite being on the high-pressure out or 'dirty' side of PX"". should get a bounce tomorrow. Huge selling today into the close, somebody wanted out big time."
"Tried posting this 3 times, VP of operations sold 78,000 over the last few days, he still has roughly 95,000. Surprised he could sell with the qtr just closing. With the company allowing him to sell I would assume there is no bad news with the qtr. On the other hand with him selling people figure there is no good news for a while, thus the price keeps dropping."
"New presentation: http://archive.fast-edgar.com//20190808/AAZ26G2CZC225ZZN222Q2ZZZ2IIDG6W7Z2B2/I really didn't notice anything new but it was a real nice summary, great for somebody new to stock.On another subject I think it would be a good time to be buying back some stock. $96 million in cash, no debt, cash increasing last qtr even with all the R&D expense. At this price ERII could use 10% of their cash to buy back 1 million shares, roughly 2.4% of the float. ERII has had this large amount of cash for years, and it has held fairly steady at close to $100 million, why not put it to use. With that cash getting next to nothing buying back shares would also give a nice boost to EPS."
I did not realize they are in the waste water treatment business too.
"Opening trade this morning had a block of over 90,000 shares which was up 8 cents from yesterday's close, a very good sign."
"Attended the Annual Meeting and was very happy I bought during the morning panic. I asked a few specific questions in regards to the Vorteq. The first one was just to clarify the statement from the presentation that Vorteq was ready. I asked if it passed all of the test that were previously done where it had failed due to wear. I was told it passed and did not have the wear issue. I then asked if the Missile is ready can it be given to Liberty. They said they are looking at many options and that is one of them. Liberty does not have a testing facility like SLB though. Also it was mentioned that to build a new Missile would be about 9 months. They are working with SLB to come up with some other testing facility to obtain Milestone 1 ( that test would involve about a 10 hour frac. Either way the Vorteq is ready to go, they seemed very confident.In regards to Mteq they had done previous testing and tweaked it and they are ready to do another test. With Mteq it is a closed system with less pressure so they can do the test themselves. Sidewinder was going to do the test but all of their equipment is being utilized now.After the meeting we did a tour of the factory and I was very happy to see all of the orders being worked on, many water orders. Very happy to see all of the Vorteq and Mteq parts. For you accountants out there it was very nice to see the huge amount of freight ready to go out the door, that magical door when a sale is recorded. Hopefully the picture I have attempted to post gives it justice..Looks like it is part of the large Saudi order for shipment this qtr.For me being a long term holder I am quite happy and I feel very confident that we will have a home run...at some point."
"Hhhmmm, so quite, I will break the silence. 2 weeks from this Thursday is the Annual Meeting and some more interesting option activity today. As most, if not all of us know on the 10th is when we find out the yea or nay on Vorteq. Somebody is betting big. My optimistic side is saying that the person buying the options is Bullish because they are paying twice as much for the June $17.50 Calls ($1.65) as they are for the puts ( $.85 to .90). But my pessimistic side is saying it is Bearish because they have bought just over twice the amount of Puts. 478 Calls and 1280 Puts. I would have expected more volume on the common with that kind of volume on the options (maybe it will be posted at the close). I will let you know which side wins on the 10th."
"The numbers look good looking forward to the call: Mr. Mao continued, ""Today we are advancing new products built on our pressure exchanger technology platform: the VorTeq, as well as incubation initiatives including a solution to improve the energy efficiency of wastewater treatment.""In regards to the live well test, Liberty announced that 2 days ago, that is why ERII got hammered on the opening yesterday."
"Read thru the lawsuit. Although I disagree with the spirit of it, I must admit they make fairly convincing points. Esp the period where Gay was at the helm.http://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1074/ERI2100_20/2020721_f01c_20CV05647.pdf"

In nine months the water segment had 32mm gross profit and 25mm operating profit.If this were a stand alone company and it traded at 10x operating earnings the unit would be worth 250mm or about $5.00 a share.That was only for nine months. If we assume that that were normal annual earnings instead of cycle peak earnings the stock should trade at a minimum of $5.00 for the water add another $2.00 for cash and you get $7.00 nearly the price it trades at today. I believe the option value for M-teq and Vorteq is worth much more than the 70 cents the market puts on the company at this time. The three month 7.50 Feb option trades nearly at a buck. I would believe that a 7-10 year (long run) option value for the oil segment would be worth at least 4-5 bucks today.Bottom line the fair value of this stock is nearer $12.00 than the current price of 7.77Buy on any dip

"Chairman Mao sold some shares on the 11th, reported yesterday. Normally I would think &%$#, but not this time. He sold 9,500 shares while he exercised 45,708. On the Form 4 it said the sale was to pay the taxes on the gain. He sold 20% of the amount he exercised so the numbers match. The shares were going to expire on 8/15/22. Why exercise now when you have almost 2 years left on the option? Maybe somebody can come up with another reason why he would do this but the only reason I can come up with is he thinks the stock will have substantial upside (buyout?) over the next 12 months so he can sell the stock he just exercised as a long term gain."
What the heck happened after hours? 6% drop?
"No major price change in well over 3 years on this stock. I'm finally done. Have fun with the Vorteq if it ever magically appears. I don't believe anything in this company until I see it at this point. How many CEOs have been swapped out, anyway??"
"Having had time to reflect on the presentation it seems to me that ERII is setting itself up tocapitalize on the PX technology in other areas of endeavor. Seemingly, they are not estimatinga significant impact until 2023. Even moderate success along with stable earnings from watershould give earnings a nice boost. Should the PE ratio expand during that time this could endbeing a $60-$90 stock within 3-5 years. The CEO Mao seems to be a competent executive andthe same goes for the CFO who gave the presentation. (Very Well Done!) Management is criticalto the success or failure of a company. Right now, I like what I see. Maybe this team will manageto bring in results better than expectations."
This is great news! In essence ERII hasn't really lost Schlum at all. Mao must have known this. That's why he exited the exclusive. Liberty up big today on the news. Surprised ERII hasn't gotten any action on the announcement.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-contribute-north-american-pressure-105000195.html

Does anyone else find it odd that the earnings reports are so close together? Not even 2 months apart.

"ERII is doing a number of projects, not just the VorTeq. The Milestone 1 Perfomance Test is just that...a test. The only fault I find is that the company did its own internal testing before the SLB event and did not pick up on the problem, however, conditions are different in the lab and real world testing (or actual operation) is what counts. Right now this appears to be aminor problem and easily fixed. Will this make the VorTeq good to go? More testing will tell. I hope SLB continues to be on board with the technology. For SLB there could be a big payoff. Actually, I am encouraged that the VorTeq works."
"11% down with nothing but good news, UFB!When the stock got down to $10.40 yesterday I thought this is crazy.

"Earnings call just announced for May 3rd. If Joel was still there, we could look for some desal project announcements which always seem to precede the calls, which turned out to be more delays and excuses on Vorteq. I hope this will be different"
"It's a bit ironic, this earnings report was their highest Q2 ever ... (the only past periods they exceeded $20M in revenue in their history was Q4) ... it was mostly based upon their water desalination business that nobody cares about. I felt the conference call was a tremendous shift from the past , i.e., the new management is now apparently taking the approach of under-promise, over-deliver, if you read between the lines.Although they are no longer giving clear commitments to benchmarks on their vorteq and Mteq, I think the conference call pretty much killed the short case on this stock; at least below the $10 level. It seems like any surprise at this point is more likely to be a positive surprise."

"To me, the report shows just how great the company could be if they jettisoned Vorteq years ago. How many millions have they spent developing it since SLB showed that they really had no interest?I've been out for years at around current price and have no skin in the game, but I like to lurk on my former holdings. Every quarter they come out with great water report and minor or make believe progress on Vorteq. Where would they be without Vorteq?"

As Gannon said ""We are now back working with our product licensee""."
The first Vorteq milestone test will happen some time in 2nd Quarter 2018. Basically the schedule is unchanged.Listen to the last 4 minutes of the JMP securities conference call for more details.

"It looks like Vorteq is still being tested with no final decision, that is a disappointment. But Mao must beleive in it or why would he drag it on. The rest of the written statement looks to be inline."
"Can anyone verify this? This is off the Seeking Alpha comment board. This commenter said that Schlumberger ""lost its exclusivity"" and that's the reason they pulled out of the licensing deal? Can't be that simple... ERII can just give Schlumberger exclusive rights again. Way more to the story than that... But this is the first time I'm seeing this. I thought Schlumberger was exclusive for 15 years, at the time the deal was made. Listening to Mao answering the questions on the call was just as maddening as Gay and Gannon. Answered the questions without answering. Mao was just as evasive with his answers as his 2 predecessors. I had high hopes for Mao, seeing that he was a legit CEO for a ""real"" company prior to this role, but looks like I was wrong... ""Both companies decided to walk away..."" Uh.... yeah.... And I got a bridge to sell..."

"Evercore ISI report dated May 7, 2018:Conservative, but solid messaging is crucial to investor perception for this “biotechesque” OFS innovator – Maintain Outperform and $20 PT. We are revising estimates to capture more robust water segment growth and margins in the out-years of our DCF. Our price target of $20 reflects a $10 VorTeq opportunity, $1.50 cash/ST investments, and $7-8 desalination segment (in addition to the cash/share adjustment for the announced buyback). We reiterate our Outperform rating, and point to a successful M1 in 3Q18 (conservatively behind ERII’s current target) as a catalyst not only for the VorTeq, but also for the MTeq and future O&G related PX derivatives. Despite the change at CEO, the focus and strategy remains very much intact."

"I swore I would never buy another share of ERII after Ganon leaving, tired of the BS. I sold 1/3 of my stock on the move above $9 to my highest sale of $11.05. Now I am loading up again. With the conference call and the stock down to $7 this is a great opportunity. It was so refreshing hearing an answer from the chairman, a simple answer to a direct question: ""Are you committing to get to at least M1 before the year is out?"" ""Yes"" was the answer. Yes, of course we had heard that from previous CEOs. I also liked how Mao described how M1 was completed during test and they surpassed it. There was more on the call that I appreciated but what really got me going was the post from Ryan (thank you Ryan) that had the video from Liberty. I was thinking this could be an old video, somebody did ask for the date, so I went looking for the date and it was Feb 11, 2020. A week later the stock hit the recent high. I loaded up this morning from 6.85 to 7.10. Here is a link to where the Liberty video has the date: https://www.libertyfrac.com/technical-library/"

Hopefully more concrete news on M1 progress will be announced here. Possibly that the have finished building the testing facility and can start on M1. Sounded from the conference call last week that M1 testing was ready to go, but they couldn't get time at either Liberty or Schlumberger to test at."
"I was going to say it is going to be another nail biter waiting 8 weeks to the 1st qtr conference call in reference to Vorteq but with all of the other opportunities I don't think the ya or nay is as important. But, if they can get the cartridge issues resolved it will be some nice icing on the cake. If Vorteq does prove viable then I would think MTeq is a given. From Chairman Mao's tone I got the impression he is going to get it done. Great news on ZLD and MLD, so many applications and the timing could not be more perfect."
"Someone please help me understand how the ESG report will act as a catalyst. Mao said on the CC that they are throwing together an ESG report (to be released soon), but I don't see how the report will speed any R&D up/sell anything.

any rumor on ERII? must be something very good on the way. Investors tend to buy on rumor as well.
I am thinking ERII could be part of the CO2 sequestration business? Perhaps injecting CO2 deep underground? Use this as a fracking method at the same time?
I've been in an out of this stock. Watched the big move up from the sidelines. Thinking of getting back in but one question comes to mind. Might they have to sell shares to finance the prolonged development period for the new product?

"After hours is showing a $9.38 bid, nice. Very good call ZLD, order already on the books. In regards to Vorteq I found the answer to one of the questions very interesting, they said they have multiple single skid Vorteqs available. They must be very confident that it works. On the Liberty call they are already to go on a test when a well is available. I also like that cash build. Also thank you ERII for getting the written prepared remarks out on the website, I will read them this evening. They sure know how to bait us with the new use."

"We have a new Sheriff in town and Ed I could not agree with you more in regards to why would anybody short ERII. In regards to the new Sheriff comment, Chris learned a lesson from his two predecessors, don't over promise and under deliver. Only business that he hyped was water: "" backlog and pipeline for mega projects is extremely robust""; ""looking at more of a 5% to 8% growth""; ""on the mega projects side, we’re seeing really nice growth in – into 2019 into 2020. So, when I think about our business – our base business right now or the water, I’m very bullish on where things are headed for us. I really are. When I think about mega projects, the OEM segment, even aftermarket, the – that business is doing wonderful."". As opposed to prior CEO's Chris is going to let the results speak for themselves and not put out a press release every time a new contract is signed.The great part is that the water business is fully funding the other projects. He must be very bullish on oil and gas to be committing ""$6 million to $10 million over time"" with $3 million spent already.He was definitely cagey in regards to Vorteq, again he is going to let the results speak for themselves. But ""I’m not going to comment specifically on our product partner or our product licensee and their positions on it. What I can tell you is that, both are – have been very supportive of us. Obviously, we are in their – one of their facilities right now, so hopefully, that speaks to their support."" SLB or Liberty is testing the product! The question is what product, Vorteq or Mteq? We know there is a completed Vorteq ready to be tested, Mteq is probably ready for testing so which one? With the slow down in drilling and rigs available we could have a press release this qtr, or then again we might not. Which brings us back to Ed's point, why would anybody stay short this."
"Price action fells different this time no? There was usually some run up before an earnings report, only to be met with disappointment. But this price strength feels kind of prolonged relative to previous...will probably drop $1 tomorrow now that I posted this, but just wondering other people's thoughts..."

"I am traveling now and limited to searching for info from just my phone, so if someone can answer this for me I would appreciate it. From what I can remember ERII needs to perform 2 milestones to get the two $25 million payments, we all know that. But do they need to be performed at an SLB facility or well? I couldn't find anything in regards to this in previous press releases.If I remember correctly they ""just"" need to complete the milestones and they get the payments and SLB has to implement the Vorteq on all their wells over a period of several years. If SLB does not put the Vorteq to use at their wells they still owe the money to ERII for every well that's pumping. Liberty has the rights to a certain amount of Vorteqs so SLB might as well let Liberty due the test."
"Three newly issued patents:http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.htmlEnter ""Energy Recovery, Inc."" into the search field. Yahoo will not let me post the link."
"Early this year I would have said the Milestone payments were just a matter of time. They were definitely going to happen.Now I am forced to admit there is a non-zero chance that SLB will never award a milestone payment to ERII. I'm not saying it's as bad as a coin flip, but there is definitely a real possibility that SLB just loses interest and drifts away from the deal. Although ERII will assure investors that there are committees and regular communication with SLB management chain and technical people...uh-uh...I'm mean, yeah, all those logistics are still in place but SLB are just going through the motions. Just fulfilling contractual requirements, nothing more.If ERII are going to make Vorteq a commercial success it seems most likely it will be with Liberty. Which means they'll have to manufacture the whole apparatus themselves. So we'll see how that goes."

It’s just devastating to look at.”This year, wildfires have consumed land that is home to members of the Klamath, Modoc and Yahooskin tribes, devouring both forests and structures. To be sure, extreme drought and oppressive heat waves born of climate change bear much of the blame for this season’s conflagrations.But experts also note another reason: the abandonment of Native American practices designed to help manage and protect the forest.“The fires are much more dangerous than ever before, because we have interrupted that long-standing practice of cultural burning by Native peoples, which kept things in check,” said Kari Norgaard, a sociologist at the University of Oregon who has been working with the Karuk Tribe for the last 15 years. “I think there’s no question that what we’re seeing now has to do with the changing climate, as well as a combination of [the] failed management of fire suppression............”"" This, above, along with the ""Code Talkers""/Navajo and other tribes/Indigenous Peoples/..., that were extremely great assets (due to the very thing some ""lawmakers""/... were trying to eliminate, their languages, land ownership, ....) during both World Wars.

"B.Riley FBR analyst Tom Curran assigned a Buy rating to Energy Recovery (NASDAQ: ERII) yesterday and set a price target of $20. The company’s shares closed yesterday at $7.50.Curran noted:“After the close, ERII filed an investor presentation, providing the first VorTeq system update since 12/18/17, when the company announced that it had temporarily suspended the system’s Milestone 1 (M1) test and revealed that the pause was taken to upgrade the tungsten carbide grade of the cartridge’s end covers, which were eroding faster-than-expected. At that time, management said the cessation could last 10-to-15 weeks in total — 8-12 weeks for delivery of the rough machined components and then 2-3 weeks for final grind and testing — but that it hoped to receive the components in “far less time” by leaning on ERII’s supply chain. Consequently, for the timing of when M1 would resume, an optimistic camp formed, with expectations ranging from late January through mid February.”"

Within wastewater treatment ERII identifies a $120m total addressable market (TAM) for lithium batteries, on top of already identified $200m in India and China within wastewater treatment. This is probably not the final market that ERII manages to carve out within the wastewater treatment industry. In addition, ERII sees a TAM of $1bn by 2030 in commercial refrigeration (analyst deep-dive on HVAC), with even higher growth materializing post 2030 due to regulation on HFC gases.

"Yahoo won't let me attach the link about the refrigeration, so here is the article. The key nugget is “We are very close to going to market.”Energy Recovery, Inc., a San Leandro, California (U.S.)-based manufacturer of pressure-exchanger devices, is “very close” to marketing a pressure exchanger designed to significantly improve the efficiency of transcritical CO2 refrigeration systems in high-ambient-temperature locations.The transcritical CO2 pressure exchanger device, model PX G1300, uses high-pressure gas from the gas cooler to boost the pressure of low-pressure flash bypass gas, explained K.C. Chen, vice president of engineering for Energy Recovery. The now higher pressure gas can then be channeled back to the gas cooler rather than to the medium-temperature compressor, thereby saving energy.Energy Recovery has determined that the PX G1300 can boost the efficiency (COP) of a standard transcritical CO2 system by up to 50% at 90°F (32.2°C).The device consists of only four pieces, a rotor and three stators containing an array of channels arranged around the axis of the rotor.With the design of the system in place, the company is in “the early stages of engagement” with potential commercial partners – CO2 refrigeration OEMs,” said Chen. “We are very close to going to market.” He added that the PX G1300 will be “competitively priced.”Energy Recovery has marketed its pressure exchanger technology over the past 30 years in the desalination industry. The device can recover up to 60% of otherwise wasted energy in the seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination process, noted Chen.Approached by national labEnergy Recovery decided to develop the refrigeration application after being approached by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which had done research into using a pressure exchanger to improve the efficiency of a CO2 refrigeration system.Chen describes the PX G1300 as “almost like a revolving door” facilitating a direct pressure-to-pressure exchange of energy, with a high pressure stream elevating the pressure of a low-pressure stream. “And you can adjust how fast the door turns to accommodate different cooling capacities,” he said.At the same time, high-pressure gas is also allowed to become low-pressure coolant channeled to the liquid receiver.The PX G1300 would be an alternative to existing technologies that enhance the efficiency of transcritical CO2 systems in warm climates, such as an ejector or a parallel compressor. According to Efficient Energy, ejector technology typically manages “less than 200psi (14bar) of pressure differential boost,” the PX G1300 “is able to manage an unlimited differential boost as required by the system, and therefore continues to perform as temperatures rise.”Chen said that the PX G1300, by reducing energy use on transcritical CO2 refrigeration, “aligns with our ESG [environmental, social and governance] initiative completely.” Energy Recovery’s inaugural ESG report was recently shortlisted shortlisted for “Best 1st Time Sustainability Report” by Corporate Register Reporting Awards, along with eight other corporations."

I'm in a $6.00. Held for a long time. I'm considering taking profits.
"Raymond James lowers to Market Perform. Also Ole sold 161,431 shares on the 1st at around $22.67. I had an order in to sell 1,000 at 22.70, the high was 22.69. I wondered who that big seller was that stepped in front of me, LOL. I bet when Ole sells the shorts hear about it and jump on board with his selling."
LOL... Their earnings call shed more light on the Vorteq than our own earnings call. Look at the Q&A section.
"Here is my take away, or summary, from yesterday’s call: Looking at the numbers and reading the prepared notes what jumps out to me is that they are expecting a great 4th qtr. They said they reaffirmed 2021 guidance of 10% growth over 2020. While doing that they expect 3rd qtr to have similar numbers as the second qtr. If so that would mean that at the end of September sales would be around $70 million. With the year expected to be 10% over 2020 that would mean that 4th qtr sales of around $31.5 million and would be a substantial increase, 13%, over 3rd qtr 2020 which was a record for a qtr (these numbers leave out the SLB lic. Revenue). They seemed very confident of the 10% and I assume that is because they have some mega orders on the books that are easy to time. Also I liked that they said they bought another new kiln, demand must be there.Desalination looks real good and they are seeing a rebound in OEM sales, China looking to increase Desal 75%. “Backlog strong..growth remains robust at 10% this year and 25% in 2022”…“bullish on the potential of the desalination not only for the next two years, but for many years to come” that is much different than prior years when they were looking for 2 year cycles.Industrial Wastewater looks very promising but significant revenue is probably at least a year out.Vorteq reminds me of a relative with a substance problem, it will get better, patience. At least, I guess, they are keeping the patient alive, and as with many relationships, diamonds (Kobe) can help.Refrigeration could be the diamond in the rough. With the “bolt on” option not much expense or risk for customers and sounds like it is ready to go. “building our first commercial ready system as we speak.” Looks to be a 2022 product that could get some real good PR. They bought back 657,000 shares for an average price of $17.60, could be a floor in the stock going forward. Share count went up with all the stock options being exercised.Being a long term investor I am ok with the call, refrigeration looks like the area where we could get some excitement but we could have a couple of sloppy months ahead. Always the tease: “As we look to next quarter’s update…”."
"Big article in the New York Times yesterday on a growing interest in the financial industry in investing in water rights in the Western U.S. ""Wall Street Eyes Billions in the Colorado's Water"". Not directly linked to desal, but just part of overall trend of commodification of water, and meaning that pricing is sure to go higher as it becomes a scarcer resource."
"""Analyst Thomas Curran says with the termination, Energy Recovery has lost the technology that is key to its ongoing effort to advance the VorTeq into commercialization.""I'm a bit perplexed by this comment. What ""technology"" did they lose? They just lost the licensing deal. As far as I'm aware, ERII owns all the tech and IP 100%."
"Seeking Alpha stories are usually pretty good, but this one completely misses the mark. No mention of Vorteq at all."
"Refrigeration could be huge. As I understand it, refrigeration is not all that different than Air Conditioning.""Air conditioning and refrigeration are similar in several ways. Both mechanisms involve the expansion of gases, adequately designed chemicals, and the conversion of gas to liquid."" Do a Google search and you can find out all kinds of info. In AC, freon and chlorofluorocarbons were the most commonly used gasses, which destroy the Ozone layer and have been replaced by hydrochlorofluorocarbons, which also destroy the ozone layer. Think of all those big sky scrappers, hotels, airports, big box stores, etc. I am sure it doesn't make sense for houses or cars but the market would be could be huge. What a story for ESG investors! I hope this potential market gets addressed on Thursday but Mao keeps his cards close to his vest as opposed to prior CEOs. I still think we hit new highs Friday with a positive Vorteq announcement."
Milestone 1 could already be achieved and can announced as soon as Monday (assume Curran is right about the 12/11-12/25 window). It'll be an exciting couple of weeks coming up.
Anyone want to guess when ERII is bot for Catie Wood's ARK Innovation Fund? This seems like an ideal choice to me!
Good luck to all longs. Sounds like we will all get early Christmas present if he correct.
"EriiWe expect revenue growth of up to 25% this year in our Water segment, and the opening of our Tracy facility gives us confidence in fulfilling our strong backlog of orders while creating critical redundancy of our manufactured components,"" said Robert Mao, Energy Recovery Chairman of the Board and President and Chief Executive Officer. ""https://ir.energyrecovery.com/websites/energyrecover/English/2400/us-press-release.html?airportNewsID=ce8f463d-4fb9-4cfa-84c6-5ae5e43d9a84"
"There's a new article up on Seeking Alpha by Michael Fitzsimmons. To each their own, but I think his view point of the company as whole, way too pessimesstic. As much as I hate to admit it, but I sort of agree with him on the Vorteq. But I think he's unfairly beating up the ZLD and the refrigeration segment when they have great potential. I think he's still judging the current company thru the failures of the past CEO's. Unfortunately, I think a lot of us long haulers still have a bitter taste in our mouths from Gay and Gannon. But Mao seems to be the real deal. No #$%$ so far. We will find out soon enough, in 1 week, at the quarterly call, what the status of the Vorteq is. Hopefully there's also an announcement that the first refrigeration units have shipped."
Location of Commercial Development Center. Map is a little dated.https://goo.gl/maps/wgkhMr9TAY7688JD7
Is this due to some sort of pending news? Could be a JV for refrigeration PX. This could also be a nicebolt on acquisition for a larger company involved in refrigeration technology. Interesting stock action forsure.
"Not the news I was looking for, no more SLB, tomorrow's call should be interesting: https://ir.energyrecovery.com/websites/energyrecover/English/2400/us-press-release.html?airportNewsID=48d3b02b-3e12-4dfc-94e5-eaa5466a8679"
"Shorts trying to keep a lid on the upward momentum, new Seeking Alpha article out this morning. Very weak argument. Good to see the stock only down 1 cent on pretty good volume as I write this post."
"Article in the San Fran Chronicle about new desalination plants. Many new plants being built to deal with brackish water and sea water in California. Grateful that we have desalination as our backbone to ERII, good steady reliable business that grows at a good pace (and keeps the price from hitting multi year lows): https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/10-million-coming-to-Bay-Area-desalination-12759970.php?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=newsletter&utm_campaign=sfc_morningreport"
"Here's the business of the shareholders meeting that will take place in June. Of note, one of the more concerning things in my mind was satisfying California's equity quota. ERII needs 2 *female* directors to join their board. If the best candidate happens to be female, great, welcome on board. But if there are 20 more qualified candidates over a female, this could have a detrimental effect. I'm all for diversity, but a forced move like this can potentially hurt the company if they are adding a director simply to fulfill their state mandated quota."
"From the May 2018 ERII investor presentation:""Liberty has rights for up to 20 VorTeq units• ERII provides full missile and cartridges – vendors have been qualified• Pricing based on contractual ROIC• Performance standards differ and thus speed to market may be faster""Pressure/Frac fluid volume requirements are different for Liberty than for SLB. SLB requirements are much more demanding. Although SLB M1 is kind of 'in the bag' even in the face of more stringent requirements ERII is still at the mercy of SLB bureacratic idiosyncrasies and timing.Less so with Liberty. Plus, ERII have contracted ROIC under the terms of the Liberty agreement & ERII provide the entire manufactured missile. So it would be good for them to get some industry cred for delivering the full assembly."
"Annual Meeting is Thursday, as previously mentioned. If you plan on participating you will need your control number from your proxy. I am paperless with my brokerage account and found the number while voting the proxy. Speaking of voting, take a look at the Incentive Plan. They want to increase the number of shares by 4,954,723 shares to a total ""limited"" number of 10,849,450 (roughly 20% delusion). I voted no because they keep on giving away our shares, diluting us, and the stock price has basically gone nowhere. Also make sure you look at Director Compensation, which I also voted no on, cash of $50 to $90,000 per year and options valued at $85,000 to $135,000 per year. FOR WHAT, incompetence? We can blame Gay, Gannon and other CEO's over the years but it is the Directors that keep on putting them in place. All they seem to do these days is sell stock. IMHO options should not be awarded, especially to Directors, when their bad decisions cause the price to decrease. They should have an exercise price 30% more than the stock price when awarded."
Guess we have to wait for the earnings release/update/conference call to find out if the M1 testing timeline has slipped backor stays on schedule. I wonder if Gay is gone for good or if he will remain as as a BOD member. (My sense is he is gonefor good.) I like the fact that the new interim CEO has an engineering degree from the University of Michigan.
"I've been long ERII prob more than I should have been, so I'm obviously not complaining about today's price action. However, I'm somewhat perplexed how the ESG report blew up the price today. It's not like it was a surprise that they were doing a new ESG report. One would think this would all be baked into the price by now. Sounds like someone got wind of this early as it went up a lot after hours yesterday already."
"It is SO NICE to be a long here!! I have been here for 6 years, from low single digit prices! Survived the ""Beatum, Cheatum, and BowWOW"" lawyers & all of the rest of the Drama!"

"I was doing research on other investments today and I came across something that fits into the ERII story that I was not aware of. As you probably remember from the recent call and Press release China has signed a deal with ERII for Zero Liquid Discharge for their expanding Lithium dominance. Currently they control about 90% of the Lithium market (processing, not mining). To mine and process Lithium it takes about 500,000 gallons per 1 ton, a EV has about 22 pounds of Lithium in it. A mine is trying to open in Nevada (would be owned by a Chinese company) and they anticipate that they would need 3,224 gallons of water a minute! If untreated that water would pollute the ground water. Another area where the market could be huge if all these EV mandates come about."

"Sold, 1.5 Million shares by prospectus. I kept on looking at SEC filings wondering why the stock got hammered the other day on big volume. Ole sold via Raymond James. It was a block sale so they just dumped it. Looks like the boys across the pond need to generate cash with the margin call a few weeks ago. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1421517/000143774920010616/erii20200512_424b3.htm"
"New presentation filed today: Looks to be the same except for the update on the Vorteq. The following has been added: ""Timing of comprehensive field testing, up to and including milestone 1 testing could be affected by: Current field test on missile to optimize flow; Project review with product licensee upon completion of all internal testing"". Reading between the lines, would this mean that they will try to work it out with SLB that M2 test is not needed?"
Looks like a great report to me. Look forward to hearing conference call.
Great quarter from the legacy water biz!! This will serve to relieve the anxiety of those nervous investors who were concerned about Joel's departure. His departure was unrelated to the underlying business. The business is fine.And we are probably only some several weeks away from achieving Milestone #1.
"We are now in early Q4. What's the odds you longs think that todays big move was word of live frack being successful? Last earnings call, Mao said live well would happen end of Q3, at the very latest, early Q4. Guess we'll find out in a couple of weeks."
Still keeping hope of Curran's 12/11-25 window Milestone 1 announcement. First week went by without a peep. Hopefully it happens this coming week.
"Huge buyer came in at the end of the day! One block of 365,376 shares on the close at the high, $9.14. Stock was very quiet until the the last 20 minutes and then it when on a big run with something like 500,000 shares. Strange, but nice. ""Volume proceeds price"""
another 3.3mil for water in Asia
"8k just filed, the 8k discusses ""Change in Control Severance Plan"", this has been mentioned several times recently. The only logical explanation I can come up for this is that somebody is sniffing around in buying the company."
"Form 4 filed yesterday from Arve Hanstveit, he had to sell 46,067 shares due to a margin call. I guess that is why they filed that shelf offering months ago, at least one of the Directors is leveraged to the hilt. Apparently he put the shares in a margin account, borrowed against the shares and did not come up with the cash or additional stock. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1421517/000143774920007352/xslF345X03/rdgdoc.xml"
"Apparently the deadline for finding lead plaintiffs for the lawsuit ends within the next week or so, anybody else looking forward to not seeing all those adds that pop up under ERII news? I wonder how much this one will cost ERII to payoff all the grease ball lawyers lining up."
"For the CC transcript: "" The pace at which we are testing and the progression reduction in technical complexity we have achieved gives me further confidence we'll be able to meet M1 requirements prior to yearend"" Hopefully this thing goes boom soon! Lord knows the longs have been very patient with this company."
"For Sale! UFB, I have not heard the conference call from this morning but from the written announcement it looks like they are going to put the company up for sale, referring to Mao ""where he completed the sale of 3Com to Hewlett-Packard in 2010."" also with "" Mr. Arve Hanstveit as the Lead Independent Director"" he wants out (shelf offering) they will be shopping it. They can have mine also, I am tired of owning it like other posters. Congratulations to the people who bailed on the opening after the EPS announcement I thought the stock acted strange after the good EPS report, now we know why it did not go up. I am going to hang in there because now I thing a sale is a sure thing.Enterprise value is only $447 mill with all of that cash."

another 2.7 mil. for desalination system. 
I can't tell if this press release is 2 yr old news or whether it means MTeq is finally a finished product. You guys interpreting any differently than me?
I bought some shares this morning with the dip. The oil services business was not the reason for my investment and challenges with the oil services industry explain why I was able to buy it at this price. I have always been more interested in the water side and looking at their last financials--this is where their futures lies. Whatever they can get with oil services if just a bonus for me. I don't mind the dip but the call from B. Riley kind of ticked me off. These analysts are worthless. Downgrade after the event does me no good.
"New article about where to invest in the Desalination market, ERII mentioned as one of the seven: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-desalination-stocks-to-fix-californias-once-in-1000-years-drought-2021-08-01"
Wow... earnings report on 11/1. We literally had to wait from 1 earnings cycle to the next for any kind of report on the Vorteq. That's if they say anything at all. Bring Joel back! At least he gave us something! Whether it was accurate or not is a different story...

"Since they announced the Vorteq contract with Schlumberger, this stock has never really been a buy and hold, but more something to sell at $10 and buy back mid-8s or less. I was always worried while holding the shares that there would be an official announcement that Schlumberger is backing out of the deal. I imagine the shorts also run the risk that they will suddenly announce another milestone payment. Seems like a 50/50 gamble."
"Motley Fool came out with a new article recommending ERII, ""Climate Change Stock to Consider Buying: Energy RecoveryThis desalination stock has a long runway for growth in this era of megadroughts and water scarcity.""https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/27/climate-change-stocks-to-consider-buying-desalinat/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article"
"Somebody started dumping the shares big time in the last hour, I hope they don't know something that we don't."
anybody see the article on financial futures related to water as a commodity started trading for the first time ever in the world on the CME? Probably speaks to future of the scarcity of water and the need for desalination to provide supply.
"https://sportsperspectives.com/2017/12/06/energy-recovery-erii-trading-down-5-6-after-insider-selling.html An insider sold about 7000 shares for $11 on November 30, which I believe would be the last day for insiders to sell before the blackout period.

"From Liberty's earnings call.OperatorOur next question is from Thomas Curran from B. Riley FBR. Go ahead.Thomas Curran -- B. Riley FBR -- AnalystThe morning, thanks for taking my questions. On Liberty's YouTube channel, I noticed that you posted a series of promo videos to introduce and explain various completion technologies that you can or expect to offer. The set included a video on which Ron took a turn as the star, providing an overview of Energy Recovery's VorTeq system. Would you update us on your latest thinking on and expectations for VorTeq. What's the earliest we might see you commercially introduce the first system? And then how many VorTeq units do you ultimately plan to deploy?Ron Gusek -- PresidentOh, that's a good question. We're always a little careful about what we say there. Of course, Energy Recovery is a public company as well, and they have not reported yet this quarter, so I have not provided any updated commentary. I will go so far as to say that, that testing is ongoing. We continue to pump sand through the VorTeq assembly in their test facility in Katy. And we continue to be happy with the progress that they are making there. So at this point in time, I'm not going to comment on a potential time for commercialization, but certainly I would go so far as to say that when and if we get to a point where we're happy with that technology commercially, we'll deploy it rapidly across our fleets, starting with those areas where we feel that benefit is going to be realized as quickly as possible.https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/02/06/liberty-oilfield-services-inc-lbrt-q4-2019-earning.aspx"

"I am traveling with terrible internet and will download the prospectus when I can. With close to $93 Mill in the bank the only explanation I can come up with is that a strategic partner, possible SLB, wants to buy some equity with all the business they might do. A first step towards a buy out"
"The information is very easy to find from the ERII home page, look for Refrigeration under Industries. Also while looking at the website it has changed a little bit, kind of like they are getting ready for something. Under ""Industries"" there is a new title ""Hydraulic Fracturing"", click on it and it takes you to Vorteq ""The VorTeq hydraulic pumping system re-routes abrasive proppants away from high pressure pumps, saving them from frequent failures."" Click on ""Learn More"" and it takes you back to the same page. Maybe nothing, but I think a week from now I think it will take you to a new page. Some times it's the little things, like that link' that give clues to the bigger things, like new highs by next Friday, IMHO."
"Why do you think Mao keeps bringing up that they could shelf the Vorteq technology if it doesn't meet future requirements. Do you think he's being more careful about his words to avoid any legal stuff going on in case it doesn't work out, or do you think he's trying to give the company an off-ramp. It's kind of new language that they never said before, makes me wonder if there's more doubts now about the technology than they had in the past."
"August call will discuss how to go to market with Vorteq. Call just cut me off, looks like it ended. HOW ABOUT A PRESS RELEASE!"
Why is ERII dropping today?
Stock has been behaving fairly well lately. Maybe some water announcements soon.
"Classical breakout move today - up early on high volume, then drifts lower as profit is taken. Expect it to move higher in the next few weeks."
"Finally received a call back from Brian, ERII IR guy. He indicated parts have to be machined and tested before theyproceed with performance tests. I think he said that they should begin testing in 3-5 weeks and the testing shouldtake 2-3 weeks. So, mid March-early April. We should get a better update when earnings come out."
Slowly creeping up. Is it the water business or is news coming on Vorteq/Mtec?
Should have been fired a year ago. Good to see we are moving forward now.
"From Liberty's earnings call this weekTom CurranOkay. And then since last quarter's call, energy recovery has really dramatically overhauled its commercialization plan to the board tax system, exiting exclusivity agreement with Schlumberger and converting the mistletoe to a modular single key execute design.Ron, you sound an encouraged by this new skit models technical performance in a recent sea related well test with the Liberty crew and equipment spread. Have you resumed actively trying to secure a customer who be open to conducting a live well test with this new skit design and what’s the earliest we might see that happen?Ron GusekCertainly, Tom, we're back in those conversations. We were on the verge of doing that before the world turned upside down. And so we are back on that path today. The testing that we did do in the simulator, well conditions identified some further opportunities for improvement.So, those improvements are underway at energy recovery right now. But that said, we are back in dialogue with the same customers we had been talking with in the past. And I think when things have stabilized and they've got their feet back underneath them, we'll be back looking at a live field test. And so, I hope that happens, maybe sometime in Q3 if we find the right opportunity, but I certainly think no later than early Q4."
"""What I can tell you is that both are -- have been very supportive of us. Obviously, we are in their -- one of their facilities right now. So hopefully that speaks to their support."" From the last qtr conference call referring to SLB and Liberty. With the huge drop in oil prices, as I type, this could be setting up pretty good for ERII. With the lower prices people are going to be looking for ways to cut cost and increase margins, hopefully they will think Vorteq is their answer. Bloomberg had an article yesterday mentioning that there having been many wells that have been drilled but not fracked. They are waiting for new pipelines to be completed in the Permian over the next 3 to 12 months. Could be a great time to test some new fracking technology with the idle wells."
"New article in an engineering publication: ""Companies like Australia’s Fluence Corp, Xylem of Rye Brook, New York, and Energy Recovery in San Leandro, California. are also well-positioned to grow revenue and earnings by providing equipment that can process and treat water"" http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/rising-drought-risk-spurs-most-cash-into-water-funds-in-a-decade-2019-10-23/rep_id:4136"
It took years to get the SW PX right. Smart guys at ERI. The Vortek will go commercial too. Patience.
ERII has been shortlisted for Best 1st Time Sustainability Report by the Corporate Register Reporting Awards (CRRA) along with eight other corporations across the globe.
"New presentation, but this is only about the water desal. No info on the Vorteq.https://ir.energyrecovery.com/download/companies/energyrecover/AnnualMeetingPresentations/Fearnleys_Renewable_Energy_Seminar_Presentation.pdf"
"the statement read: "" The specific terms of any potential future offerings, if any, along with the intended use of proceeds of any such securities, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement at the time of any such offering."" It doesn't meant they are putting new offering."
"Well, clearly someone(s) were trading on the DuPont news before the general public was made aware. Unfortunate."
"Nice and interesting trading in ERII lately, I like it. Getting new buying possible from the news a few days ago but also probably from some presentations they have been doing. I can not find anything on the presentations other than that they are being done: ""Nov 18, 2020 Fearnley Securities Renewable Virtual Conference in Oslo"". There was also another virtual presentation since the Conference Call."
Seems like we've formed a nice base right around the $20 mark. Resistance right around the $22/23 area. Lets bust thru there next week!
I believe that this is the largest water project that they ever received.16.6mm with 77% gross margins will give them nearly 13mm in gross profit. If you assume marginable SG&A of 3mm then you get 10mm to the bottom line. 50mm shares or 20 cents a share marginable income. 20x earnings and this stock could rise quite a bit just on this contract.Company is priced just on the water business and cash. The oil business is a free option at these prices (8.68 as of posting).Added more shares this morning good luck
Can anyone post the key points from the share holder meeting? Wasn't able to listen in and the replay isn't available until tomorrow. Thanks in advance.

Great price action today! Hopefully word has leaked that they completely live well frack. ESG report also lifted the price the day it came out.
"I was trying to see if I could find any news to justify the sell off today, other than just some profit taking. I came across the following press release that is dated March 10th ( ERII post the price of the stock on their website but I could not find where it will be on the 10th or where it closed on the 9th). The press release says one of the speakers is Tina Arrowood who was featured in the video I posted earlier today. I appreciate her enthusiasam and I hope it comes through on the 10th during the presentation. This also could be why the stock was up after hours on 5 trades amounting to about 1,400 shares. http://www.energyrecovery.com/media/filmtec-fortilife-membranes-matched-with-energy-recovery-ultra-px-provide-breakthrough-in-minimal-liquid-discharge-affordability/"
What's the deal with this new lawsuit? Is it related to the Dupont news leaking? The stock ran up significantly prior to the official announcement.
Hope to have a commercial Vorteq rig operating in the field by the end of this year. Sounds like a 'stretch goal' though.
"Strong revenue/earnings growth, high margins, low price and a great product. What isn’t to like here"
Well that was a wild 3 minute opening! Low $17.94 high and where it is now $20.40!

Seaport Global Securities currently has a “Buy” rating and a $17.00 target price on the stock. Seaport Global Securities also issued estimates for Energy Recovery’s Q4 2017 earnings at $0.01 EPS, Q1 2018 earnings at $0.45 EPS and FY2018 earnings at $0.85 EPS. ""With the new tax law going into effect, and California having a ridiculous tax rate, I would bet that ERII will be moving to Texas. In a conference call, earlier this year I believe, a question about moving to the Houston area was asked. Joel said they were looking at that but they wanted to concentrate on Vorteq and not a move. I would think this would be a very good long term plan."
"Under CEO Mao ERII seems to be in competent hands. This could become one of those high growthtechnology stocks that trades at PE ranges of 60-80 as ""Green"" investment funds discover ERII. Wouldbe ironic if the newer, smaller, less expensive, super durable VorTec were to gain acceptance as THE fracking technology that saves significant dollars for the oil & gas industry as production comes back.For the patient this may be a $60-80 a share stock. In time this may be a solid takeover candidatefor a large number of contenders for their technology and technological expertise. Maybe some newindustries will begin to use PX Technology...Mining? Pulp & Paper Production? Chemical Production?"
