WRE is up 5.29% to 25.30
"Reloaded today. Earnings report showed very little impact of COVID, which is amazing given their concentration in MFAM now. Also, divi left unchanged. If they had any material concerns, the divi would have been cut. Screaming buy IMHO."

Geez. I would think the stock should have gone up a bit with all the cash and new strategy.
I have owned this stock for many years and it never disappoints.
Washington REIT is down 7.92% to 21.97
Just wonderful. About a 52 week low while the no dividend tech stocks keep getting records highs. The old people who were told to put some reits in your portfolio to get income are paying a big price. Unfortunate.
Well just wonderful again.
What is going on with the recent drops ?
WRE cannot seem to gain any ground. It goes up a bit then goes down. Reit's usually do not have this type of buying and selling. More of a divi play. Wonder what's up.

"Ok..so they’re going to make us figure out if they sold at a loss? Office is actually going to do well long term as companies need to space employees out. Remote work is not for everyone. Apparently, it wasn’t a good deal based on the SP."

"Washington DC and MD is boarding up, boarding up a lot of empty buildings at that.Things are not looking up around here."
SOLD
Colleagues: We are going to own multi-family properties. New markets such as Charlottte NC. Does WRE have nice properties? Apparently we will be a multi-family residential REIT. Good luck to all. May the Lord watch over us.
Why are so many of the reits down so much today?
$WRE is going to get the big money from the new $AMZN HQ:https://www.twst.com/news/can-profit-knowing-new-amazon-amzn-headquarters-will/
Any ideas why down on such a big up day?

WRE is one of my dividend stocks I can truly count on. very steady.
"I am still long on this stock, but I don't see how they can sustain that high dividend while they are transitioning such a large percent of their asset base, unless they will pay it from their cash, but that will shrink their new asset base. I do like the multi-family housing strategy, and was looking for a good REIT in that, and was happy to see the REIT I already owned become a pureplay one."

This dog can not even go up on a huge day.
"The new plans to go in to middle income apartments in Washington D.C., Virginia, Raleigh-Durham, Charlotte, Charleston are fabulous plans. i'm in all the way."

"Who picked up some shares under $23? That should be the floor. Time to ride it back up to $30 (again) over the next two quarters. Wash, rinse, repeat. Don’t fight the chart. WRE is predictable...the only wild card is the fed, and if they hold rates we’re good...and if they cut as 50% now th8nk they might, look out above! Happy Holidays and good luck in 2019!"

Almost there....$30.00 this week? Gotta love this stock.
"Real estate in the Washington DC area is in bad shape people. To make matters worse, they keep building. All the cheap money (printing/lending rates) will create a Chinese moment if they aren't careful."

Why is wre suddenly going down so much? Is it just following the market or were there bad reports?
Whats wrong with this dog today? Down 3.5%
"Solid earnings report! Little disappointed that the divi was unchanged, but at least it didn't go down. Perhaps a share buyback in 2021 to buy back the 2019 issuance? Would like to see more improvement in the FFO in 2020 but seems 2020 is still a transitional year with the change in assets classes with 2021 getting back to ""steady as she goes Captain"" results we all expect from WRE. Hopefully, WS appreciates these results, but if not, I'll be buying again after any material drop below $27. Wash, rinse, repeat."

I hope I’m not the only one sitting on a nice 20% gain in a mere 3 months. Still holding...I’ll reevaluate around $33.
Close to a 7% hit on Friday was a big deal. What is going to happen this week with the stimulus.
Don’t buy just yet. Between the Fed and WS mike be able to pick up below $30 this time. Five trading days left!
"Hold out for under $20 for tax loss selling before 12/31. Load up then. Not before. After 12/31, this goes back to $25 by 3/31 for patient investors. Over the years, Buy under $20 and sell over $30....maybe $25 in 2021. Wash, Rinse, Repeat."
Hope everyone loaded up when they could under $26....I’ll be checking out now and won’t be back until they are back above $30. And I’ll be sleeping soundly knowing WRE is a great long term investment and has been for me for over 20 years now.

"From the earnings call...2020 is going to be an inflection year...rough 1Q20 with increases in 2H20...net-net FFO will be down slightly. Looks like 2021 should be better as units are rehabbed and leased and commercial vacancies are filled. So, if you're in this long-term...no need to panic with the quarter-to-quarter earnings...because they are doing the right things for the long run...just collect the divi for your patience. Short-term, the stock will probably experience some pressure. I'll be waiting with my limit orders again if the drop is unreasonable! Good luck all."
If it breaks through $26 then my buys will start to trigger from 26-25. Fingers crossed! I can’t remember the last time this stock dropped this much this fast. Below $25 and I’ll start liquidating other positions to load up! Good luck to all.

Anyone have any news on WRE. Looks like about $22 is where it is going to stay. I thought the stimulus
You're looking at a 20 year low and commercial RE is not looking good. Its that simple.

"The escalator is going UP. Perhaps this time it’ll hold $30 and establish a higher low. Great earnings report and great job of repositioning the portfolio over the past two years. Unfortunately, few read them anymore and just invest passively. So, it often takes this stock some time for good news to translate to a higher price. But for those that invest, not trade, we will be rewarded for our patience all while holding a lower risk stock."

Any reasons for the 3.8% drop so far today.
I have great faith in wre and am holding on.

Commercial Realestate is empty. Enough said!
Who’s laughing now! Oh yeah. $30 here we come...
Now what. -4% for no apparent reason.
WRE is down 5.03% to 28.16
Why the big drop. Dividend related?
"There we go again. Lots of selling pressure at $30. This time though, they may challenge the $33-$35 range given finally realizing the benefits of the portfolio reallocation into mfam. So, just hold tight while this dips back below $30 and don’t walk away from at least another 10% gain over the next quarter...hopefully!"
I can't believe its holding up this well. Everything is looking softer. Just look for yourself. https://ir.washreit.com/Cache/1500122183.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=1500122183&iid=103036
Excluding the Obama blip it's a 17 year low.
Earnings tomorrow after close! One more day to add to your positions. Should be some forward looking info on the expected increase to FFO for the new properties....hopefully.

Wow. This is close to a STRONG buy IMHO. It’s down to the ‘92 and ‘08 recession levels. Time to start nibbling for long term investors. Buy low and sleep soundly.
Why such a drop today. Should be good news about the multi family change?
Nice 5% run to start 2020! Higher lows bodes well...for higher highs. Can we hit $35 this cycle?
5 year low https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WRE?p=WRE and only a 5% divi.
Why is this dropping on such a big day. Was up .20 a few minutes ago and now down .15.

"Have owned this stock for over 20 years...trimming here...buying there. It’s one of my core holdings that I NEVER worry about long term. It gets pushed around by index funds, so when it dips below $28 or the divi is over 5%, that’s when I place the buy orders. Their portfolio changed last year...but that’s good news. Also being pushed around because of fears about rising rates...but most of their debt is fixed! Time to place some buy orders! This is a pleasant and unexpected surprise."

This is index fund selling not specific to WRE. We already took the hit from earnings. Screaming buy the closer this gets to $25.

Triple bottom in place after testing $30.00 three times over the past month. New floor is in place.

God I love this stock....been an investor off and on for 20 years. $30 here we come again!
Insider BUYS! Just 147 shares...but it’s still a buy and shows management believe its undervalued.
"Here we go again. Been bleeding down since the divi was announced 12/5. Clearly, the Street didn't like the flat divi."
anyone have a comment on future share price. The mall owners are not doing well. WRE showing a negative profit.

Say good bye to the $20’s...soon.
If you missed it...pretty good investor update just posted.https://www.snl.com/IRW/Presentations/103036
July 29 WRE announced dividend cut from .30 per share to .17 payable 10/05/21. Surprised WRE stock price didn’t drop more than it has even though it’s still trending downwards.
Just stop the clock please. If the market stayed open another 15 minutes WRE would be down another 2%
Nice 15% run...hopefully it’ll hold $30 as the new floor and leg up from there! Long term holders know though to watch $30-$33 carefully.
Anybody else see value here?

Wow...assuming this holds...this has been one of the most shallow corrections in WRE history! Higher lows bottoming just under $29 portends wells for the trend line to $33+. WRE is one stock I don't worry about long-term...its real estate after all...in Washington. And D.C. is isn't going to shrink any time soon. Portfolio shift essentially completed in 2019 into red-hot MFAM should bode well for FFO in 2020. Mid-single digit dividends plus mid-single digit price appreciation equals double digit returns. Highly recommend divi reinvestment. Best wishes to all longs in 2020.
"Got most of my orders filled. Hope other longs were able to add to their positions during he ""sale"" this past week also. This stock is getting punished because of interest rate fears. Buy when others are selling. Looking forward to the next run up to $30."

Backing up the truck! Finally broke below $26. Don’t be a lemming...be an investor! WRE under $26 is a great entry price.
Seems to be stuck in place. I think investors are concerned about the too quick strategy move. No reason to rush things in the real estate market. They should have taken their time and moved into the apartment market as good deal popped up.
"This is a low volume stock that historically has had violent market driven corrections (unrelated to its earnings) followed by nice gradual recoveries. I’ll be nibbling around the $26 floor to see if it holds and if not will be getting ready to buy heavy around $23. Hoping history doesn’t repeat itself, but if it does, I’ll be ready...again. I am not a short nor a pumper. I have a long term holding and will double the shares on corrections and sell off half again after my targets are achieved."
