"The Coca-Cola Company currently owns about 18% of Monster. And Monster could not survive without the Coca-Cola manufacturing and distribution systems. So I choose to own Coca-Cola stock so I can benefit from Monsters growth and Coca-Cola's 3% dividend. After all, it's only a matter of time before Coca-Cola owns Monster outright anyway."
Love MNST. Long term growth including Asia. Anyone can make energy drinks but MNST established and has consumer loyalty.
rode the train from 49.00. sold at 62.00 today. see you guys after earnings!
"MNST needs KO alot more than KO needs MNST. That's for damn sure! I'm long KO and don't own any MNST outright. Don't need to because I own KO. I'm looking forward to KO completing the BodyArmor acquisition. MNST can wait. KO is busy with Topo Chico, BodyArmor, and Costa Coffee."
KonaGold hemp energy drinks are going to be the next Monster / Red Bull.
"Monster is making it REIGN into my portfolio today. I was down 2k in my core position, now up 922.99."
"I was thinking about a possible buyout/merger with Coke and Pepsi, but perhaps an even better one would be with Keruig Dr Pepper (KDP). They are both 48B dollar companies with strong brands, strong growth, and a 100B dollar combined company would give KO and PEP a run for their money."
MNST is a great Company with outstanding long term growth prospects. Now selling at bargain prices. Would not be surprised if KO purchases the remaining interest very soon
"kgkg will make you a millionair in lest than three years. they have very good company plans for the future. i just got 32,700 shares. i will retire happy. JIM"
Investor meeting makes everyone anticipate what news could be revealed. Gotta love the action this morning huh? Not sure there will be anything announced. Remember that we had the same investor meeting last Jan. 12 so this is not a new thing.
I wouldn’t buy this stock. It’s a dinosaur and we all know what happened to them! Stay ahead of the curve and buy Kona Gold energy drinks!
"Kevin apparently you do not follow MNST close enough. Yesterday afternoon management conducted a webcast of a investor meeting / business up date. This was announced 1-2-20. I found the details in a multi page report on my Schwab feed after the market close. It was all reasonably positive and met with some analyst upgrades, for starters, Jefferies ups to $74.00 per share. MNST immediately popped in the afterhours trading. Just like todays news, you have to dig a litter deeper or you are going to be stuck with the fake news...………..God bless all...……….."
News: Coca-Cola to aquire controlling intrest in BodyArmor. Great news for KO longs.
"This board is quiet, isn't it?"
"I'm surprised by the December action. Over the years we tend to give back some of the gains at the end of a year like this when MNST has outperformed so dramatically. I believe this is due to fund managers locking in their gains as well as year end tax moves. I was just certain we would see that this year. Of course, I've also been watching long enough that I would never short this stock. LOL. That's for people bolder than I. Any opinions out there on this observation and why it's not happening this year? Implications for January action?"
Love the pricing power here. Addiction pays
Heading to 70's No demand.
"So I never looked into Monster stock but I just did a calculation that says $10k invested in 1998 would have become $34M in 2018, in just 20 years. That is the highest any stock could ever give you in return."
not sure why they havent bought out rockstar perfect fit. run both labels under one umbrella
You guys have any thoughts on these recent upgrades or are you to busy counting your money...........God bless all...
got a 1k shares at 65
What ever happened to Coke at one time buying Monster when it was a $30 stock. What a steal that would have been. Now I’m wondering who going to smarten up first Coke or Pepsi and buy the Monster Brand. People can’t even tell you what Pepsi and Cokes energy drinks are called. It’s the most recognized brand name on the planet. I see everybody buying Monsters at the Register not either of their brands. It’s a win win cause it wouldn’t them Hugh profits right out of the gate. Coke had its chance in the past. I know they be had ten years of kicking themself in the butt but it not too late. Pepsi can have chips and dips Id rather own Monster any day. This stock is going higher. You can see with your own eyes how many they sell. Add alcohol to it and they d double their profits. God this company is such a growth story. Buy and hold it and you will be rich.
Closing in on $100...this name has dramatically slowed its price growth persistence nonetheless the trend is still upward. MNST will either continue to thrive on its own or it will get acquired. Either a way is a win for longs.
I bought some Reign energy drinks today. I thought MNST was going to introduce Reign to the market but it says absolutely nothing about MNST on the can.
"KO climbing, MNST droppingat this rate KO can soon acquire MNST for a 1 to 1 share basis!"
"Thankful for the movement up today,,Cramer may not like MNST but, looks like investors do.Perhaps it is buyback funds but either way I'm happy to see 55+."
"Cramer says ""stay away from Monster Beverage"" a sign to buy?"
"A new 52 week high today,,looking forward to more highs in the near future..."
We have move up by about $10 from 47 to 56+ since Dec 2018. That is excellent progress and if we could just keep moving up at $10 per month we would soon be back to $70. Am trusting in our Management to do the best they can!
"Hmmm, good news for MNST and perhaps for today's jump!Coca-Cola discontinues energy drink in N.America11:35am ET, 05/14/2021 - ReutersBy Nivedita BaluMay 14 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co said on Friday it would discontinue its energy drink in North America, a product it launched with flare last year as it pushed into new beverage categories.The decision comes as a part of the company's move to streamline products and focus on its fast-moving beverages as consumers pick up more of its traditional sodas and flavored sparkling waters as they come out of the pandemic.""Our strategy is focused on scaling big bets across a streamlined portfolio ... As we scale our best innovations quickly and effectively like AHA and Coca-Cola with Coffee, we need to be?disciplined with those that don't get the traction required for further investment,"" a company spokeswoman said.Coca-Cola Energy will remain on shelves in other parts of the world, the company said.Coca-Cola still holds a majority stake in Monster Beverage Corp, one of the top energy drink makers in the United States.Rival PepsiCo, in the meantime, has ramped up its presence in the category with the purchase of Rockstar Energy, launch of fruity flavors of Mountain Dew and a new version targeting morning consumers.On Thursday, PepsiCo unveiled an advertisement to promote its new drink Mtn Dew Rise Energy featuring NBA star LeBron James, a former Coca-Cola endorser for nearly two decades.Coke Energy, made with guarana extracts and B-vitamins, was launched in the United States early last year in different flavors, packed in a sleep case to attract its young clientele. It had a higher caffeine dose and cost more than a regular can of soda.Chief Executive Officer James Quincey has earlier said the company is focused on actively transitioning brands to more ""powerful"" trademarks using a phased approach and is maximizing shelf space with new product launches to drive growth.

RTX just said Jet Engine parts are going better than expected. What about the almost 5 Billion in contracts from defense side of the business. Amazing how they don’t notice a Billion doll or contract or three or four 250 -300 million contracts. But Uber picked up a extra rider and now they love the stock. Can’t figure out their thinking or is this whole game is Rigged. Just don’t get it when RTX is doing everything right and can’t get over $90 a share. Unbelievable
Anybody here wish they could have bought Monster @ .10. You can buy Kona Gold (KGKG) for .10 now. They will be a CONTENDER.
Disappointed in the lead up to earnings. Wish we could see better interest in a great company that is producing lots of of cash for the company. I would also love to see a dividend from this fablous inventment
"What are the views of the long timers here as to the recent downward pressure on MNST, given the recent good quarterly report and bullish upward forecasts by most analysts? In general, volume seems to be low on these dips, so I'm thinking these are mostly individual investors taking profits, vice riding it upward to $100+."
kona is expanding like wild fire. hemp infused energy drinks are way better for anyone.
"Started averaging into this yesterday, planning on holding at least a year!"
"OK. Same as last Monday. Good vaccine news sends markets higher, but MNST very clearly goes the other way. I'm not hung up on daily movements, but this one still puzzles me. Anyone have thoughts on why?"
Sure am excited that we may see the $100 threshold today!!What a wonderful company!!
Final support will be $68 . wait till next feb. 2022.
a virtually debt free cash machine that sells caffeine water.... its a mini coca cola .. the real thing.. a money printer. and defensive stock to boot... no fear buying here.
