"CDP group, which JOBS owns 20%, has filed for IPO. So, although JOBS' Q3 financial performance was poor, there will be a boost or at least support of JOBS' stock price in the near term."

"judging from the recent performance of WDAY and other Human Resource Mgt software / SaaS stocks, China's CDP Group's IPO listing in the US is likely to be a dud. That won't help JOBS, whose own main business has been underperforming and needs some good news (such as CDP Group -- which JOBS owns 20% -- have a good IPO) to support its share price."
JOBS is down -6.90% to 67.50

"Mohamed A. El-Erian#Markets right to respond enthusiastically to the jobs report. On a stand-alone basis, it’s more than “Goldilocks”. Points to both higher growth and stronger potential.
