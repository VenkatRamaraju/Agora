I'm with Rich. Love the dividend.....and that it's up several dollars this year.
Higher interest rates should benefit bank stocks like NWBI. Now might be the time to jump in. I added to my position today.
Are there any thoughts on the safety of the dividend? I've been a long term holder but an now down after clearly a large drop in the share price. Still holding...good luck to all.
I believe this bank is one of the most underappreciated regional banks in the country.

"In my opinion,this stock should be fine,because after keep buying other bank, one day, it would be bought by the other company.just didnâ€™t know when."

"Tell you what.... The dividend is nice when there is low inflation but this stock has underproduce since they went public more than ten years ago. We have been fortunate to have a low rate of inflation after the 2008 collapse and quantitative easing and tax cuts have made the market skyrocket. Now we have enormous quantitative easing, not to mention ten fold of money through fractional reserve banking. Today is the day foreclosures start for both banks and evictions as renters. The liberals are continuing to reward lazy people. My prediction..... There is a shortage of real estate and a bubble for a reason. Bums are not getting kicked out and don't want to work. Tomorrow starts the evictions! Real estate to crash and market in general too. Do your self a favor and hedge a highly stock leveraged portfolio with a SP500 short. It is what I am doing while still holding strong onto my stocks. Be diversified up and down. Good luck to everyone. #$%$ gonna get crazy."

NWBI has a nice dividend coming next week. You get a good return with banking sector exposure.
"PNC, same region as Northwest, is closing 52 banks.https://www.wpxi.com/news/business/pnc-closing-52-more-branches-biggest-mass-pruning-so-far-2020/Q4PVX4OHJJBV7EDZNQV7PNCTMM/"
"NWBI is one of the best regional banks, and it has not come back to anywhere near its pre-pandemic level like many other banks. I view it as a hidden gem and have made it a big portion of my holdings. Just my opinion. Good luck!"
Nobody interested in NWBI?? Moving accounts from a major bank to NW as they are offering a better deal and have much better customer service. Impressed enough that I bought some shares Moody's has a better rating for them then the major bank I am leaving. Banks out of favor as they are from time to time but it is a cycle and aith a nice dividend I can wait. Going to buy some more.

"I have said it for years ""Banks don't know what they want to be !"" It is even worse in the present environment. Customers want to know & trust the people they deal with when it comes to their money relationships. Technology might help the bank cut their biggest overhead ..... employees & salaries, but does nothing for reaching out in their communitiesto be known & promote business. No matter what their is no substitute for personal interaction ! There is still and will be during and following the pandemic a tremendous need for ""true community banking"". People do not trust the likes of Bank of America, Wells Fargo, etc for their everyday monetary needs. If you need a great model long time bank look at Jonestown Bank and Trust in Lebanon County as a community bank. They have operated successfully for a century and a half ...... why, because they understand what a bank is ...... people to people interaction on a daily basis. Northwest was that way. It was like family both working there and dealing with them. Bigger & keeping up with the Jones's and technology with less employee training has run the train off the tracks."

NWBI is selling it insurance business. That should bring in a sizeable chunk. I imagine they could buyback a lot of shares.

Bank consolidation will happen rapidly. I consider NWBI a very attractive takeover target. ESBK just north of the PA border got taken out at a high premium by CBU. Many potential buyers. Any thoughts?

"I hope someone buys NWBI, needs new management to create shareholder value."
"NWBI is a great regional bank with a super dividend, and at under $13 I believe it is a very good buy. I added 1K shares on last week's dip. Good luck!"

"Still one of the most underappreciated regional banks out there. Most others are selling above their 52 week highs, but NWBI is still a bargain with good earnings and a great dividend as I see it."

Higher rates will make NWBI move upward. It is a good thing.
I think NWBI is the most reasonably priced regional bank out there. I could see it jumping a couple of dollars in the not so distant future.

"The bank closings were easy to see. Earlier in the Spring, Northwest closed the lobbies of their banks (by appointment only) and shifted customers over to the drive-thru's and online banking. With the simplicity of their online banking there really isn't any reason to go to lobby teller. It's not good for the tellers getting laid-off but it's the way things are heading. The Coronavirus did the bank a favor by getting the customers familiar with online banking."
"Barron's had an article that said the weakening dollar is a good sign for banks because it usually leads to a measure of inflation, NWBI is still down considerably since the pandemic started, so it hopefully has a ways to run when things start to calm down. Good luck!"
UP 6% since my last post and still pays near 6% dividend while you wait and looks like trying to break resistance at 12.76. Still no one interested. I love these out of favor stocks and sectors that have decent financials. Did same thing end of 08 Great Recession. Bought 45 calls on an out of favor stock in an out of favor sector. At one time so out of favor I a small fry owned ALL the 45 calls a year out! But company both solid and a well known US brand for many years. Stock now is more than tripled and I bet you can't guess which one it was. Paid a dividend too.
"Just ran a comparative chart for banks 1yr and found following RF +68%, JPM +57%, C +28%, WFC +6%, and NWBI -15%. Talk about poor under performance. Management must be very inept."
anybody have any idea what is going on?
5 years of a wasted investment in this bank.
any of the branches I go to are very very busy. Love that dividend. I keep buying more.!
"NWBI is taking off. It is one of the few strong regional banks that has not shot up to pre-pandemic levels. I expect it is getting noticed now. It's strong dividend is another attractive feature. You never know, it could also be an acquisition target due to its modest stock price. Good luck!"

Thx for the insights. I will be buying shares for my retirement income plan given the nice yield.
Banks have been really slaughtered. The selling seems way overdone.
"Looks like tax loss selling is hurting NWBI. It has lagged the banking sector this year, and it is only a few cents over last Dec.'s low. Hopefully, next year will see a rebound."

"hey guys what do you think about this bank? mostly I'm looking for divided$ , however searching for a good company that can growth over time"
Horrible! This stock price is the same as its initial IPO ten years ago! Sure it pays a dividend but holy #$%$
i think this bank could do great things.
Keep on keeping on!
My mom passed away in Jan. Going through her files I found a certificate for some shares of Regal Financial Bank which was purchased by Northwest bank in 2014-2015. Can I convert the shares of Regal into NWBI? What's the ratio?

"With the corp tax reduced to 21% this year, it's reasonable to expect a greater div increase. However, most corps are not passing on much of their windfall . Disappointing, I thought there would be more across the board."
Nice dividend makes NWBI very attractive at these levels.

"NWBI was doing fine until the yields dropped and the virus popped. It pays a solid dividend, but will it be able to continue to do that. I have also heard politicians say that banks should cut dividends to preserve capital. I would expect a cut, but I still think the banks will pay a solid dividend. I sold my couple of thousand shares when the market started to tank, but banks have been the one sector that has not started to rebound to any degree."
