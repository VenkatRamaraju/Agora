"Little bit of up movement, huh??? Looking at chart, looks good.!"
"I have said it for years ""Banks don't know what they want to be !"" It is even worse in the present environment. Customers want to know & trust the people they deal with when it comes to their money relationships. Technology might help the bank cut their biggest overhead ..... employees & salaries, but does nothing for reaching out in their communitiesto be known & promote business. No matter what their is no substitute for personal interaction ! There is still and will be during and following the pandemic a tremendous need for ""true community banking"". People do not trust the likes of Bank of America, Wells Fargo, etc for their everyday monetary needs. If you need a great model long time bank look at Jonestown Bank and Trust in Lebanon County as a community bank. They have operated successfully for a century and a half ...... why, because they understand what a bank is ...... people to people interaction on a daily basis. Northwest was that way. It was like family both working there and dealing with them. Bigger & keeping up with the Jones's and technology with less employee training has run the train off the tracks."
"Not concerned with takeovers, unlees a high dollar, Just very happy w/ price appreciation and DIVY.!!!!"
My mom passed away in Jan. Going through her files I found a certificate for some shares of Regal Financial Bank which was purchased by Northwest bank in 2014-2015. Can I convert the shares of Regal into NWBI? What's the ratio?
Thx for the insights. I will be buying shares for my retirement income plan given the nice yield.
I'm with Rich. Love the dividend.....and that it's up several dollars this year.
"NWBI was doing fine until the yields dropped and the virus popped. It pays a solid dividend, but will it be able to continue to do that. I have also heard politicians say that banks should cut dividends to preserve capital. I would expect a cut, but I still think the banks will pay a solid dividend. I sold my couple of thousand shares when the market started to tank, but banks have been the one sector that has not started to rebound to any degree."
"hey guys what do you think about this bank? mostly I'm looking for divided$ , however searching for a good company that can growth over time"
UP 6% since my last post and still pays near 6% dividend while you wait and looks like trying to break resistance at 12.76. Still no one interested. I love these out of favor stocks and sectors that have decent financials. Did same thing end of 08 Great Recession. Bought 45 calls on an out of favor stock in an out of favor sector. At one time so out of favor I a small fry owned ALL the 45 calls a year out! But company both solid and a well known US brand for many years. Stock now is more than tripled and I bet you can't guess which one it was. Paid a dividend too.
"NWBI is taking off. It is one of the few strong regional banks that has not shot up to pre-pandemic levels. I expect it is getting noticed now. It's strong dividend is another attractive feature. You never know, it could also be an acquisition target due to its modest stock price. Good luck!"
Higher interest rates should benefit bank stocks like NWBI. Now might be the time to jump in. I added to my position today.
"I hope someone buys NWBI, needs new management to create shareholder value."
"Looks like tax loss selling is hurting NWBI. It has lagged the banking sector this year, and it is only a few cents over last Dec.'s low. Hopefully, next year will see a rebound."
Are there any thoughts on the safety of the dividend? I've been a long term holder but an now down after clearly a large drop in the share price. Still holding...good luck to all.
Another Northwest acquisition.36 more branches in Indiana coming April 27th.https://www.northwest.bank/welcome-mutualbank
I think NWBI is the most reasonably priced regional bank out there. I could see it jumping a couple of dollars in the not so distant future.

Bank consolidation will happen rapidly. I consider NWBI a very attractive takeover target. ESBK just north of the PA border got taken out at a high premium by CBU. Many potential buyers. Any thoughts?
NWBI is selling it insurance business. That should bring in a sizeable chunk. I imagine they could buyback a lot of shares.
"Still one of the most underappreciated regional banks out there. Most others are selling above their 52 week highs, but NWBI is still a bargain with good earnings and a great dividend as I see it."
