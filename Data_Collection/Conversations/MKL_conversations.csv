"I expect MKL will report a very solid Q1 2021. I expect insurance pricing has improved, equities have obviously improved pricing, bonds have improved pricing and the economy is opening up in a major way, which will help Markel Ventures. If not for inflation, it would almost be a goldilocks economy. We'll know soon. I'll just hold."
"Any chance this company will pay a dividend? If I’m going to pay thousands of dollars to purchase the shares, shouldn’t I get some yield?"
"Management is underperforming, S&P500 beat MKL by 25% this year and we are lower now than we were back in 2017. The worst 3 year performance in their history, what is going on???"
"Markel reports Q1, very solid results, as expected. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/markel-reports-2021-first-quarter-204800003.html"
"MKl is my largest holding, by far, in my IRA. I've owned it for several years, with my initial purchases in the $500s and $600s. I looked at the financials, they had (at 12.31.19) $22 billion in ""cash, bonds, cash equivalents and stocks"". $7.5 billion of that was stocks. Assume the stock portfolio has taken a 50% hit, so it's now worth $3.75 billion. Cash and bonds didn't change much. Assume that all other holdings dropped another $3 billion. So, now, MKL has roughly $15 billion in ""cash, bonds, cash equivalents and stocks"". At today's closing price, the market value of MKL is about $11 billion. Obviously, this doesn't account for any insurance losses MKL may incur during this awful downturn, but I'm happy to add to my holdings at these prices. I've added about 20% to my holdings, and bought some for my 3 sons in their accounts, mostly in the $800s. Now, I'll hold for a few decades (my sons can hold for 40-60 years) and see what happens. If history is any guide, the price may/could go lower, but the long term should prove profitable."
"I just picked up my first few shares of MKL and hope to add more in the dips. This is a long term hold for me (really, for my kids). This is a great company. I wish I found it several years ago. The stock is basically trading at the same level it was 5 years ago. I think the future looks very bright for MKL. Anyone agree? Disagree?"
BLOCK & LEVITON LLP? Ambulance chasers? Never heard of a law firm going after a company.
"Buffett: “Last year we demonstrated our enthusiasm for Berkshire’s spread of properties by repurchasing the equivalent of 80,998 ‘A’ shares, spending $24.7 billion in the process. That action increased your ownership in all of Berkshire’s businesses by 5.2% without requiring you to so much as touch your wallet.”"
Markel reached a 52 Week high at 1313.44
"Hmmm - I am not sure, I get the idea of time in the market not timing the market. I understand what Markel is trying to do and it is one of my major shareholding and has been for years. But I have been selling it down for the past year or so. I just don't understand when the market is doing well and other stocks like BRK-B is doing well how can Markel be flat for approx 4 years? Why - what are we missing here that the market is seeing?It this a long term trend and if so why is it underperforming so much?I know there was talk of the share underperformance in the annual shareholder letter but I do think I will be selling more MKL over the couple of months."
Book value went from $820 to $885 in the quarter.

I'm not happy with the stock's short term performance - but I am happy with the company's performance. I think that the stock price will eventually reflect the long-term value of this company.
"Well, I am taking this as a buying opportunity to add to one of my core portfolio positions. Solid company...tough quarter. In 10 years, a purchase today will look very wise. Good luck to all!"
Set it and forget it! A blowout quarter! This is a long term hold! A real gem! Go MKL!!
"Insider sold 1000 shares, no wonder it went down."
"What’s with all of this flat talk? Markel is outperforming S&P 500 on the 1mo, 6mo, YTD, and 1Y charts!"
Another great quarter. I like the note on Gaynor's letter - company has grown at a compounded rate of 10% the last 5 years and the stock has increased at a compounded rate of 3%. I guess that tells us something.
I think the high stock price keeps the average retail buyer on the sidelines. I'm not advocating for a split; I think the price will slowly catch up to the real value.
"Any one else getting nervous about the exposure to MKL from the class action law suit brought by Anytime Fitness? Sure its only a couple locations in the suit now, but all +4,000 locations had the same policy from MKL. They can join the suit. And this isn't even on yahoo's news thread. Have to google it."

MKL investing in the Hagerty PIPE (ADF being the parent SPAC)? MKL has lost all sense of buying at the right price. Short ADF at will. And MKL will be taking future write downs on this investment.
"Interesting that MKL changed the format of its press release. I think it had a great quarter, but they sort of downplayed it in the press release. I like that."
"If Berkshire was selling for 1.2x book, Buffett would be stepping up and buying his stock which he has. How about Merkel management? Are they interested in buying back share or maybe they don't have the confidence that Buffett has in his company."
Why -10% after hour
What is going on with this stock? No momentum whatsoever despite putting up good numbers last quarter.
Markel restarted buying back shares in today's filing. They stopped in March 2020 due to COVID. Good sign.
"Yes, we are on a roll. 1,200 is next target"
Bought this stock at $1209 :) Any advice from the other shareholders here ?
"Just out from Markel:""As the Company previously disclosed, it retained outside counsel to conduct an internal review of CATCo's loss reserving in late 2017 and early 2018. The internal review has recently been completed. The internal review conducted by outside counsel found no evidence that CATCo personnel acted in bad faith in exercising business judgment in the setting of reserves and making related disclosures during late 2017 and early 2018. The Company's outside counsel has met with the Governmental Authorities and reported the findings from the internal review."""
I’ll bet Gaynor and his team picked up a lot of really good companies at a discount during March and April. They should blow away estimates next quarter. Anyone agree? Disagree?
Hagerty is going to be marketed by State Farm insurance
Is it too late to invest in this company? Even if you can buy one share?
"Annual letter has a pretty good summary of how the ILS market works, and how the potential for Nephila and Catco (notwithstanding Catco's current problems) makes these acquisitions quite interesting for future earnings."
What is going on with Markel - why are the shares so flat for soooo long?Any hope of run or is time to cut bait?
"Why is MKL at 65 p/e? Are there some events in the earnings, write downs etc. that have resulted in that number? BRK-A has a p/e of 23. Just trying to evaluate MKL and determine appropriate entry price."
"Anyone think MKL hits $2,000 by the end of next year?"
Comments on the earnings release?
"By my rough calculations (roughly 6 billion of stock investment at beginning of 4th Q earning earning a rough guess estimate of 12% without dividends), it looks like MKL will have over $50/share of mark to market gain from its stock portfolio for the fourth Quarter of 2020. I would think this might be beneficial to the stock price. Any thoughts?"
"Is this the stock being advertised as ""the next Berkshire Hathaway?"""
