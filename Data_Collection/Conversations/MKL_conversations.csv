We're still 34% behind the S&P500 for the year. Luckily this is my number 2 holding and S&P500 is my biggest. It's time to play catch-up.
"Annual letter has a pretty good summary of how the ILS market works, and how the potential for Nephila and Catco (notwithstanding Catco's current problems) makes these acquisitions quite interesting for future earnings."
Tired of holding out. Time to throw in the towel and start buying in! Damn you Markel!
anyone have any comments on the low insider ownership ??
a nice 10 for 1 split would be nice
This’ll be a good earnings call
I’ll bet Gaynor and his team picked up a lot of really good companies at a discount during March and April. They should blow away estimates next quarter. Anyone agree? Disagree?
"Derecho, hurricanes and fires = sell off. I think that's short sighted, but we'll see."
I'm not happy with the stock's short term performance - but I am happy with the company's performance. I think that the stock price will eventually reflect the long-term value of this company.
"Any one else getting nervous about the exposure to MKL from the class action law suit brought by Anytime Fitness? Sure its only a couple locations in the suit now, but all +4,000 locations had the same policy from MKL. They can join the suit. And this isn't even on yahoo's news thread. Have to google it."
MKL reached a new All Time High at 1176.92

Something happened to UP. Another example of the rapidity of descent. Lost all of it's exceptionalism...fast.
Will they ever do a stock split?
MKL is down 5.02% to $1090.31
Is MKL the new Berkshire Hathaway? That's why I invested.
"MKl is my largest holding, by far, in my IRA. I've owned it for several years, with my initial purchases in the $500s and $600s. I looked at the financials, they had (at 12.31.19) $22 billion in ""cash, bonds, cash equivalents and stocks"". $7.5 billion of that was stocks. Assume the stock portfolio has taken a 50% hit, so it's now worth $3.75 billion. Cash and bonds didn't change much. Assume that all other holdings dropped another $3 billion. So, now, MKL has roughly $15 billion in ""cash, bonds, cash equivalents and stocks"". At today's closing price, the market value of MKL is about $11 billion. Obviously, this doesn't account for any insurance losses MKL may incur during this awful downturn, but I'm happy to add to my holdings at these prices. I've added about 20% to my holdings, and bought some for my 3 sons in their accounts, mostly in the $800s. Now, I'll hold for a few decades (my sons can hold for 40-60 years) and see what happens. If history is any guide, the price may/could go lower, but the long term should prove profitable."

Comments on the earnings release?
"If Berkshire was selling for 1.2x book, Buffett would be stepping up and buying his stock which he has. How about Merkel management? Are they interested in buying back share or maybe they don't have the confidence that Buffett has in his company."
Markel is up 4.93% to 996.00
Looks like Chloroquine will save us. This is the floor.
"Management is underperforming, S&P500 beat MKL by 25% this year and we are lower now than we were back in 2017. The worst 3 year performance in their history, what is going on???"
Will this Dog ever rise again? This is supposed to be the next Berkshire Hathaway.
Is MKL oversold?

"I sold a May 800 put to collect premiums and then have the stock put to me at a lower price...my net would be $780...never did I think that this stock would be able to be purchased under $1000, much less $850good luck to longs. I'd be curious as to which 2-3 institutions sold this...because of the high price it is so illiquid that whoever provides a bid is going to only buy on his/her terms for the person who wants to get out."
Well that dump today was interesting.....because of the AM Best ratings???
sell this stock overhyped and overpriced
Bought this stock at $1209 :) Any advice from the other shareholders here ?

Just bought a bunch of OPTI because they landed Kevin Harrington on their advisory board yesterday...He's worth 450 million and a marketing genius.... already green....They have a patent on using UVC lights in cell phones to sterilize or decontaminate items and once they enter talks with Android or Apple.... IGNITION. Get some!
why is MKL selling off so much?
MKL reached a 52 Week low at 925.00
"MKL is up a whole $6 for the year. Yah, you're on a real roll!"
Set it and forget it! A blowout quarter! This is a long term hold! A real gem! Go MKL!!
I’m mildly interested in MKL but I’m not crazy about Gayner’s portfolio - there’s a lot of junk in there that is characterized as “value stocks”
"I just picked up my first few shares of MKL and hope to add more in the dips. This is a long term hold for me (really, for my kids). This is a great company. I wish I found it several years ago. The stock is basically trading at the same level it was 5 years ago. I think the future looks very bright for MKL. Anyone agree? Disagree?"
Company should say something or announce buyback. This is in free fall.

"Interesting filing this morning to issue first class of preferred shares that will be priced at $1,000 each and not be listed for trading. Is Warren putting some $$ in to fund something big?"
I bought some MKL today. Never owned it before. Plan to hold for a good long time.

Best boring stonk ever!
Price action in advance of earnings isn't encouraging. Looks like we might have a stinker coming up. Hope not.
Ads say the stock that is the next Berkshire is 1/30 the market cap of Berkshire. 1/30 of 500 Billion is about 16 Billion. MKL is 15.5 Billion Market Cap.

A great time to have a split like BRKB did a few years back
Almost beat amzn to $1000 LOL
Getting slammed after hours on Catco reserves issue.
Any info about mkl market stakes?
MKL is down 8.91% to 990.00
Lemonade has a market cap of 9 billion while we're at 14 billion. I think that's ridiculous.
750$ target by mid April It is very weak on the charts Shorting will be the key of making money here
Woo! Buybacks!!!
I want to see $1000 as the base instead of the unbreakable ceiling. Will $1000 become the base?

"Just out from Markel:""As the Company previously disclosed, it retained outside counsel to conduct an internal review of CATCo's loss reserving in late 2017 and early 2018. The internal review has recently been completed. The internal review conducted by outside counsel found no evidence that CATCo personnel acted in bad faith in exercising business judgment in the setting of reserves and making related disclosures during late 2017 and early 2018. The Company's outside counsel has met with the Governmental Authorities and reported the findings from the internal review."""
What is going on with Markel - why are the shares so flat for soooo long?Any hope of run or is time to cut bait?

"Buffett: “Last year we demonstrated our enthusiasm for Berkshire’s spread of properties by repurchasing the equivalent of 80,998 ‘A’ shares, spending $24.7 billion in the process. That action increased your ownership in all of Berkshire’s businesses by 5.2% without requiring you to so much as touch your wallet.”"
Stock's up 6% pre-market. Anyone know why?
Another great quarter. I like the note on Gaynor's letter - company has grown at a compounded rate of 10% the last 5 years and the stock has increased at a compounded rate of 3%. I guess that tells us something.
MKL reached a new 52 Week Low at $1035.41
whats happening with MKL?
MKL is down 4.91% to 1165.52
thank you for the conference call very interesting like to be positive. this is a $2.568.00 stock soon .you have a very good working crew working for you .
What is going on with this stock? No momentum whatsoever despite putting up good numbers last quarter.
Book value went from $820 to $885 in the quarter.
Down over $30 in post-market? Why?
"Why is MKL at 65 p/e? Are there some events in the earnings, write downs etc. that have resulted in that number? BRK-A has a p/e of 23. Just trying to evaluate MKL and determine appropriate entry price."
Here's hoping the DOJ comes knocking on Markel's door!http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/04/doj-warning-to-us-companies-dont-put-american-workers-at-disadvantage.html
Markel is down 5.21% to 1104.10
new 52-week high
"I think the quarterly report was pretty positive. This is a long term holding - not a quick buck play, but a very solid company that seems to be doing quite well during a very difficult period in the economy."
"Well, if there's a silver lining here, it's that property and casualty premiums are going to finally start going up - and, I suspect, some marginal players will leave the market. Unless there's fraud involved, I think MKL recovers from this rather quickly. Since it's only Catco, it's imperative that the lawyers conduct their investigation ASAP and address any regulatory concerns. It's going to be a down quarter, but maybe this problem won't be long term. If stock recovers in the short term, those lawsuits will probably be settled for bupkus."
MKL reached a 52 Week low at 718.03
What is mkl expense
"Hmmm - I am not sure, I get the idea of time in the market not timing the market. I understand what Markel is trying to do and it is one of my major shareholding and has been for years. But I have been selling it down for the past year or so. I just don't understand when the market is doing well and other stocks like BRK-B is doing well how can Markel be flat for approx 4 years? Why - what are we missing here that the market is seeing?It this a long term trend and if so why is it underperforming so much?I know there was talk of the share underperformance in the annual shareholder letter but I do think I will be selling more MKL over the couple of months."
"50 years from now, we'll all be happy we bought mkl. Mkl will make U happy."
"Slight pullback probably tied to hurricane season, likely temporary"
"Markel reports Q1, very solid results, as expected. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/markel-reports-2021-first-quarter-204800003.html"
Markel is down 10.76% to 934.00
One should not fish off the company pier.
What happened today? Not much news out there about MKL these days. Thoughts?
"I expect MKL will report a very solid Q1 2021. I expect insurance pricing has improved, equities have obviously improved pricing, bonds have improved pricing and the economy is opening up in a major way, which will help Markel Ventures. If not for inflation, it would almost be a goldilocks economy. We'll know soon. I'll just hold."
MKL is down 7.64% to 774.98
I think the high stock price keeps the average retail buyer on the sidelines. I'm not advocating for a split; I think the price will slowly catch up to the real value.
"while Amazon dips, Markel keeps rising"
"Interesting that MKL changed the format of its press release. I think it had a great quarter, but they sort of downplayed it in the press release. I like that."
"Solid company, solid leadership, low debt, consistent growth. There is no reason this shouldn't hit $2000 by end of year."
More vultures have joined the feast.
How high can mkl go?
Is it too late to invest in this company? Even if you can buy one share?
"Any chance this company will pay a dividend? If I’m going to pay thousands of dollars to purchase the shares, shouldn’t I get some yield?"
$1300 Who loves you baby
"By my rough calculations (roughly 6 billion of stock investment at beginning of 4th Q earning earning a rough guess estimate of 12% without dividends), it looks like MKL will have over $50/share of mark to market gain from its stock portfolio for the fourth Quarter of 2020. I would think this might be beneficial to the stock price. Any thoughts?"
We love Markel
MKL reached a 52 Week low at 760.00
Anyone buying shares going into earnings?
"Well, I am taking this as a buying opportunity to add to one of my core portfolio positions. Solid company...tough quarter. In 10 years, a purchase today will look very wise. Good luck to all!"
what type of ambulance chasers want to sue Markel?
Well at least we don’t hafto read class action reminders in the news feed anymore
MKL reached a 52 Week low at $980.00
"Yes, we are on a roll. 1,200 is next target"
Quick question.... is MKL exposed at all to the hurricane stuff??? I owned years ago when it was in the mid $300's & sold in the $500's... so been a while since I have followed.
I think we get back to $1300 price soon...
"I'm not sure the spike in rates is here to stay. We'll see. We may have some pressure on all stocks if rates continue to rise. In the relatively short term, higher rates are good for MKL."
Markel is up 5.94% to 1034.97
Dang that was a good one there.
Markel restarted buying back shares in today's filing. They stopped in March 2020 due to COVID. Good sign.
