"Hmmmmm...earnings look decent enough...apparent some concern over resignation of one of the ""co-ceos""...something I think is likely good in the long run...at strong support...good dividend...think I'll probably throw a little cash it way."
"No one paying attention? That's good. In any case, stock looks like it's in an area of strong support and yields almost 5%...trading at 40 only 7 months ago...might be good for a few bucks looking for a relatively safe haven."
