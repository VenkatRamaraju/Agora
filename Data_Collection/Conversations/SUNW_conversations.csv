Way too low of a valuation. One PR release and this thing is going to run up with the rest of the solar stocks! Load up on this dip!
Red on low volume its just Evergrande drama nothing is wrong with the company.Buy now great potential.I have seen couple article about it lately as well
"Wow this party really died. Volume is in the gutter, earnings were semi-positive, no chatter on the board. I guess everybody knows something I don't. Somebody says 3.00 by Novermber but at this rate it'll be 3 by end of the month. Where is everybody?"
"Heare2dare14m$SUNW ..... Are You Keeping Those Sell Limit Target Price Orders High? .. Mine Are At Over 8, 9, 10 Dollars. .. May It Aid Enhancing Prosperity For The Bulls. .. Cheers!"
"These past weeks has been tough for the solar sector. A lot of small investor are selling scare while big investor are creeping up behind. Guess, there’s a reason behind mother nature. However, I am not worry about these reds in my portfolio. As I know solar will climb back. Its inevitable. Who will stand in the herd with me so we don’t get pick off one by one."
Absolutely no volume. This is a good stock. All signs point to go unless I'm missing something.
"Stock rebounding here is encouraging, instead of collapsing for what seems an eternity like it used to do. Good luck, longs."
"Big opportunity starting with Q2 results. California has an aggressive goal to switch all power over to renewables, which is really just solar! Huge market and SUNW will see vast gains in contracts and revenues."
Wanna add 2000 more shares next week 21 Mars earning it’s gonna fly to 30$
"yesterday was brutal for the whole market, hopefully can regain the $7 and then upward over the next couple sessions."
Analyst Recommendation MSN Money8/6/2019Buy1 Year Price Target1.40Analysts2EPS Estimate0.03
"The next 4 years will be a very optimistic and positive for renewable energy! The governments political opinions is to invest trillion$ into renewable energy and will rejoin the Paris accord soon.. buy and hold and be patient, this stock should reach go much higher soon by the end of month.. glta"
Don't get fooled.... This needs to $16 now... ASAP ( 5X of revenue minimum considering upcoming green friendly dem. term)Thus can even get to $50 in short term if revenue starts to balloon....in California electrification ahead...
"$90 Million market cap for this company is extremely low! This low float stock with multiple contract wins is going to explode higher. This should easily be valued at $250M. That is more than a double up from the current price. Solar is the future and nothing is holding this company down. If you’re in the market to make money, this is your opportunity. Even though it has had a nice run up lately, the valuation is still too low. Load up!"
the CEO is an ethical CEO..people will realize this soon and the stock will soar
infrastructure bill should be passed by the Senate this week. I suspect that it's great for all clean energy SUNW 
"The next SUNW: ENKS is the most undervalued solar company in the market IMO.Market Cap - ENKS $18 milOutstanding shares – 65 milFloat - 15 milAssets - $96 milLiabilities - $56 milRevenue $120 milNet income $21 milCash $24 milShare price $0.50Also, per CEO the plan to apply to NASADQ!!!Now let that sink for a bit and compare it to other Solar and energy stocks with no rev, no cash, losses, and only hopes. I think once the market will catch up to ENKS it will rum to $30-$40 in a few months. Long hold for sure! This is my own research and opinion and you should always do your own DD. GLTA"
"Solar has taken a hard hit in Feb. Hopefully, it recovers and brings new highs in April."
Sunw time to shine !!
Imagine what this stock price would be if there were more gov support for solar?
6.1-6.3 is a good buying zone.
"OK now, back to $25. as in Jan 2021. Infrastructure !!"
something big is coming. solid company with actual numbers and great projection and great future in green energy
Second Qrt Rev. almost as much as all of 2020. I hope this is a good sign
"Does that mean, regardless of what your current cost average is, every Sunw share is 0.1851 share of peck?"
"Market cap only 400Millions, they can achieve 1b revenue in 2022 after government future investment in renewable energy. This should be $50 stock at least around 1B market cap."
Only $1.93 more and I'll break even! Let's gooooooo!
what is wrong with this stock ? anyone has any idea?
The worst stock ever u seen just telling u !I stuck in this garbage with a lot of money so don’t know what to do ?sell or keep losing
The best company to invest your money  It will be 30$ Next week.Just add more if you can .
I will go in at the @16Do you guys think they’ll do a stock offering anytime soon?
Every single day these day traders pump and dump at the end of dayLosing so much on this
"Green energy week! World’s awareness of climate change is increasing. China and USA are agreeing to work together too!! Solar,wind and other clean energies...."
this is the best under a dollar stock put there. great business and soon to be profitable..tons of cash and a huge backlog of business
"IMO, people accumulating for the infrastructure bill passing."
very solid company with solid numbers and solid future. it will go back up to the thirties soon.
bargain price right now
…(ILUS)……(SUNW)…

Thank goodness I sold this months ago I actually think today I would have lost everything if I held onto this lol.
"The U.S. Congress on Monday passed a massive spending bill that includes $35 billion in energy research and development programs, a two-year extension of the Investment Tax Credit for solar power, a one-year extension of the Production Tax Credit for wind power projects, and an extension through 2025 for offshore wind tax credits — a significant last-minute boost for clean energy industries."
Its funny how people write off a stock after a 3 or 4% drop in a week. That is a normal correction and necessary for the stock to perform well going forward.
Very easy to reach $30 in upcoming days! Strong buy
I bought 2300 today at 5.90 and 600 at $6.50 the other day
"the Bullish Report on Sunworks, Inc. https://chart-analysis.tools/SUNW"
"Like I’ve been saying. SOL is holding at a large $1.5B market cap, with fewer revenues than SUNW... at only $300M market cap for SUNW, this stock can easily run to $25-$28 per share and still not even be close to that valuation! Load up here guys!"
"Stocks making the biggest moves in the premarket: Tesla, Bank of America, solar companies & more"
"I could be wrong, but we have a low float and over 20% sold short. This thing has short-squeeze potential."
will be 12 $ tomorrow .
A lot more upside than downside.
Like people have been mentioning. Other peers are trading at $1B valuations with the same revenues! Will easily run to $25/s. Watch!
"I have been bashing SUNW for the last few months due to their lack of ability to hold gains. However, something tells me that after the holiday is over. This stock will hit 15 fast. Maybe in 2weeks"
For some that are stuck do not sell from fear this is happening to other stocks too not every day is a good day in trading! This stock has plenty of potential and do not forget for investment that is being sold to make money do not forget they will reposition too do not let others take your money i am down by a lot ! But buying dips and averaging until the stock gives that W shape and we will take off ! No bad news just people selling from fear and some to make profit and reposition!
Average of $13.98 with 1500 shares 
Solar power announced to be the cheapest source of energy to homes and businesses in the future. This and others solar stocks will soar. Get in now before they do. GLTA
Who’s adding here before potential rally?
There was some great news on Peck today..... expect similar news with Sunw....Sunw revenues are much higher and with no debt....so expect explosive moves ahead....
Don’t worry all energy stocks is down It’s gonna go back to 17 again Just added 400 more shares
Frankie is right. I went to the website and clicked solar for a home and they are a certified TSLA installer. I tried to post the link 4 times.
"started a position today. couple calls, couple shares."
Interesting open.
Whats happening to this stock? This is just going down and down and down ??? 
Is it just rising because of Monday's addition to the index?Because volume is normal.I have been holding since months now.What is your price target guys?
"Some profit-taking at Friday's close as usual. This undervalued stock with a ridiculously small MC is in an uptrend right now... Business is beginning to accelerate, and 4Q is going to be a record quarter. All solar firms are entering a secular growth trend... sooner or later shorts will have to cover!"
Picked up another 500 shares - averaging down. Upside looks good. Will buy more if it goes lower. If it goes higher - stay long.
Top Gainers for U.S. Stocks | June 2021https://chart-analysis.tools/Top-Market-Gainers
Stimulus is here in morning it will be signed!!!!!!!! lets get it this is a one of the most popular solar stocks it is predicted that this stock will be near $47  it takes patience and buying dips to average look at Tesla it was a $60 before look at the price now this company has no debt ! The company is running all on profit so no worries on its earnings!!!! I have been studying this stock for months and have been given predictable outcome on the day and Wednesday i will predict it also pulling past $14 second day of bond shopping so woohoo 
I’m down 50k today !I feel like i need some vodka what about u guys ?
"finally going in right direction. If I'm patient enough, looking for 10-11."
"Max chart.it had 2 huge,huge, spikes in march.expext it again"
who did not BUY today?..... green stimulus ahead......$16
"Will until $3.50, then I will be all in"
Momentum has been really strong. on SUNW in recent days. Given the low float I believe this should cross 12$ today
During the time SUNW dip. Some people on this forum encouraged to sell off. So many misguided info of where SUNW was heading. A few even said it was going to crash back to near lows. I caught it at 15.90. Now look at the rebound. All solar will be great once summer kicks in. Just hold strong.
It’s not overbought yet. RSI shows 47 for today. Average for a year 51. So it has much room to buy.
"""The company noted that more than 40 new ACI contracts were signed in December bringing the fourth quarter new bookings total to more than $20 million – marking the highest level of new project wins in seven quarters."""
Make sure you guys BUY more today if you can and HOLD !Buy the DIPS !They're loving the $10 strike  Just remember June 18th is coming.. This is a solid company and big/positive things are happening with the company. No reason why the stock price shouldn't be in the $20ish price range. Just my opinion.
Buy the dip
strong today
One of my best friend Sanjay works at SUNW. He said business is booming and they are expanding to built new capacity.
8$ please!
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/08/business/energy-environment/biden-solar-energy-climate-change.html
Bye bye 7$?
"All New California homes must include Solar, PECK tried to acquire SUNW on the cheap for that rule alone. Now through in a new Biden GREEN administration that has pledged Trillions towards clean energy and solar and you have what I call a PERFECT STORM!GO SUNW!"
This stock is truly a good opportunity when its time for the sunshine more money 
patience pays off. investors who took advantage of rock bottom prices for the shares of this stock is finally rewarding us.
"California enacted legislation in 2020 all new home construction has to Be built with solar panels, it is a big deal for SUNW based in California.. the next 4 years renewable energy could be a big investment ever.."
"Conspiracy Theory for the week:On June 17, 18 there were 10M shares traded on a 16M float company. Very rough estimate of aggregate transaction: $6.5MPossibilities:1. random act of small speculators & investors (less than 5% of float be any individual or entity)2. insider purchases3. a company -or- hedge fund acquired a controlling stake in SUNW.... 4. company buying back stock Schedule 13GThere are several filing deadlines for Schedule 13G. For institutional investors, they are required to file within 45 days of the end of the year in which they finish above 5%, or within 10 days of first finishing a month above 10% if the initial filing has not yet been completed. Passive investors are required to file within 10 days of acquiring 5% or more of a security. Finally, exempt investors (as defined by Section 13(d)(6)(A) or (B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) must file within 45 days of the end of the year in which they become obligated to file."
The drop is probably cuz of the winter storm. All of the solar stocks are down. Nothing to worry about if you're holding long.
I love all solar. ASTI news today nasa selected their photovoltaic solar panels
"So we have $82MM in cash, $20MM in total liabilities, only 1/2 of the approved $100MM stock sale utilized and spend on the acquisition of Solcius. Revenues are 1/2 of what they were last year due to delays caused by government agencies and utility companies. No info on what Solcius is adding to the books other than more residential market share and stock options that start to vest after 12 months at 12.95/share and the rest over the following 2 years"
Then there's this: https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/sen-sanders-e2-80-98there-is-a-real-danger-e2-80-99-infrastructure-reconciliation-bills-will-fail-over-dem-infighting/ar-AAOmtRe?ocid=uxbndlbing
"We've lost 80% of gains coming off the January high. Does anybody have any indication of where it will land? Is it possible that we go all the way back to 4.00??? Volume is in the gutter but this is not a bad company, and is in a position to short squeeze if we could get buyers. News seems good, the earnings was great... what gives???"
"Oh, so now everyone's on board with this stock, huh? It's even defying the general stock market sentiment, talk about turnabout. See if it lasts, though, is this a spike or a real sustainable gain?"
"just came across some interesting stats here, on WeBull it shows that the average prices for shareholders are 8.11 making it 0% of people are profitable rn."
Look. All I know is that this thing has big upside potential. Sales are booming because California has a new law that all new construction must have solar and these guys are swamped plus they are in the process of expanding beyond California. So I am optimistic. Maybe I’m wrong but the potential is there.
"Share Dilution Explains why this kept dropping. I was thinking something was wrong. But Yahoo and others still only reporting 5.2 million shares, so I trusted that. It seems that it grossly innacurate and we have been dilluted by 200%, which would align with the share dustruction. Frackers. Sunworks cancelled the “At the Market” equity sales (ATM) after having sold 2.9 million shares in 2019 for $6.8 million, net of fees and 9.8 million shares in 2020 for $7.7 million, net of fees."
"Much better to go up 3 or 4 cents a day for 10 days versus 30 or 40 cents in one day. Keeps the day traders out! They only buy in when there are big gains to be made. After they coordinate the price up to unsustainable levels, they make their money by coordinated selling of every share they bought and drive down the price."
Just stop selling simple as that
Omg this stock is freaking joke I should ever never bought it #biggest mistake ever !
"$4.00 before we see a reversal. But personally, I think $3.00 is more likely."

Sunworks to the moon great news from the president about clean energy 
"Close over $1! My call today was ""the next bullrun will lead to $1!"" So next station should be $2+"
SunBroke stock is the worst investment ever
"nice close on Friday. Not a lot of volume in this stock, so just a little action can move big. IMO, If can clear and hold 7, I see next points of R/S at 8, 9, and 11."
this stock symbol reminds me of the sunmicro system LOLI guess the yr.2000....
"$50 a share represents $1B of market cap! SOL ran late $1B and has held there and they made even less revenues last quarter than SUNW did, and they have more shares outstanding! This thing is going to continue to run higher and higher! Load up!"
can anyone explain how the Evergdande situation affects sunworks? I dont see the connection 
we will see 12$ very soon
short squeeze is very close .
Folks I wish to tell you that among all solar stocks SUNW is highly undervalued. It should be trading at around $ 8 at this time. However please don't be disappointed if you are holding it. If you have $$ buy more. This stock could go to 16/share by April.
https://dbtnews.com/2020/12/01/sunworks-inc-sunw-revenue-clocked-in-at-43-70-million-up-348-00-ytd-whats-next/
"BIG NEWS, Sunworks pays off debt and strengthens balance sheet."
sitting around 6 month support. Can easily move a few dollars up if given the right catalyst and attention by retailers.
Certainly feel like we can see $22 some time soon?
$30 a share gap up! Move now! Big gains!
Alot more upside then downside at these levels
"Today, I caught SUNW at 13.65. After hour news jumped and tomorrow will be in 15."
Opportunities are never lost; others grab what you don't! The stock market goes up and down. Patience is the key with a great company like SUNW! I will buy more!
Look at Sunworks news yes yes !!!! Easy $20 this company is amazing it truly works like the sun after it rains !
"I just started trading my self because I think I can do better than a broker that would be eating me alive with costs so I open an account with Chase and I get 100 free trade and thereafter $3.95 a trade and it’s paying off ! I took $22,000 and I am reading everything I can on the companies I’m buying and I’m no loading up I’m creating a portfolio and I added this one at $0.47 and I won’t sell till it’s at minimum a quad and then I’ll only sell 1/2 cause I believe it’ll be a double digit in 3-5 years after reading up on it."
"have to admit, this is stock requires patience to the nth degree"
Sunworks is entering 2021 in a strong position with a cash balance of approximately $39.4 million which positions the Company to fulfill its near-term and long-term growth initiatives and strategic plans.I'm here for the long term (:
Check out ASTI - Ascent Solar. It is on a rebound and making a comeback. Has been climbing steadily.
This is a 10-15 dollar stock At the end of the year
Even at $50 a share this is not a 1 Bil market cap yet. So much upside!
"My prediction is, the solar sector may take a slight fall since it jumped well last week but will curve fast as it moves towards April."
"Heh, stock performing same as ever. Disappointment after disappointment. Hey, management, get your act together, do something to bring a glimmer of hope to the poor folks who bought in above $10. I decided to get back in at $7, whoever said to wait until $6 may have been right, but we'll see. It might go below that. This is something to own long term, like 5 years and hopefully management will have figured out how to bid projects that get them a positive profit margin. Palm to forehead, guys!"
Bought 100 shares at .44 cents!!!!!!
Earnings already out guys!!!!
"From the Motley Fool: The biggest problem for Sunworks is that it isn't even close to making money. Revenue in the first nine months of 2020 was just $29.3 million and losses were $11.1 million, or $0.75 per share. Those trends look like they'll continue, and with bigger, more established solar stocks available, this isn't a gamble I would be taking today."
By Friday $20. buy buy buy
I believe the news is cost of solar is rising
"These shorts really trying to make this stock plummet, we only going to the moon"
SUNW is set to join the Russell Microcap Index effective July 1. Any guesses what this would mean to stock price if anything?
What happened! please tell me
What do you think it will be 15-20-25$ again?
5.65 by Sept. 23
"$SUNWA Future, International Giant...ALL Ratings Are Strong-BUYS w/ Excellent, Growth Potential."
50 $s soon
"If tomorrow is another red day, I might be done trading forever. I worked so hard to get up to $130k and I’m down to $85 in two days."
"While people was panicking, I made two great plays these past two weeks. I waited patiently and caught SOL and SUNW at a wonderful position. Although, price is still relatively low. With stimulus and summer around the corner this baby will catch up to her peers in high 30-50 soon."
Good thing about SUNW is that it's heavily shorted. A good recipe for a short squeeze on April 22. Just saying.
"don't get fooled, the infrastructure bill will not be voted on today, nor tomorrow, nor next week. We're going to $4.00 through the end of the year."
where's the news?
"The whole market took a downturn, glad to see SUNW will still end to close to 10% gain. Here's hope for $12.00 before the end of the year."
"$1.2 Trillion infrastructure vote CANCELED by Pill-o-see. The green energy hype is going down in flames. Couldn't get it done, not even in a dem majority house. Worthless."
PT for this beauty is $62 short term . Higher long term
I think we've got a long ways to go before good profit hits. I have 270 shares average of 20.30. I dont plan on starting to sell until we reach 30. I'm down over 1200 and keep buying. Been rough this week.
Been a holder since near the end of September at $4.30. Decided to cash out sell all my stock at $20 today
Can someone explain how come they are expected to have revenue of 33 million which is much higher than under 10 million previously??If that's the case market cap of 242M is just the base.
Very Low Float : 26M shares.21% of Float is shorted.
If we break $6 on high volume we are shooting for $16.....This can't stay this low... too long...
Average down or take a fat L is the question 
I doubled up on my investment yesterday on this... and I guess that’s why it dropped this morning. Sorry y’all.... go figure 
patiently holding for now....
Buy alot more at 8.10 today
why are shorts keeping this down ? nothing but good news from SUNW
Many solar stocks are overvalued and I think this is fair value. 259M Market Cap and 38M sales
Target: $25 by June month end. Buy Buy & Just Buy. Reddit behind this now.
"Sadly, as much I would be excited to see this company recover, it seems forsaken to this slow bleed-out. The PG&E permit and licensing complications will be a major hit to a Q4 that would have been an otherwise positive turn with regards to earnings and EBITDA. Following this with the inevitably seasonally challenging Q1 is going to have this company struggling for longer than it may be able to. To make matters worse, as the share price has now dipped below 1$, the NASDAQ de-listing countdown has now started back up again, and this time, it won't be as easy as simply reverse stock-splitting to solve the problem (due the market cap being < 5 million). So although it may be good that they have access to additional emergency liquidity through the ATM (to the detriment of current shareholders), getting de-listed from the NASDAQ is going to limit how effective that recourse will become."
Accumulation continues and this will be followed with a strong upward move.. I’m accumulating as well.. any price under $6 is a steal
Quick update I’m now down 45% how’s everyone else doing 
"5 million USD cash, 9.8 million market cap, rising revenues (Q1 2020 vs Q1 2019 +33%) - we have a real opportunity here!"
need interesting news...
Big solar companies are moving higher today. I think SUNW will follow the trend. I am long!!
"What does this mean?https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1172631/000149315220012843/formdef14-a.htm3. To approve an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to reduce the amount of shares of authorized common stock to 50,000,000"
Unusual options activities positive sentiments and high potential for growing….. SUNW is moving higher!!I am long!
Guys stay strong I’m down 30K ! The whole market is down just stay patient. You never lose til you sell
I just followed this stock since like months and never got in to buy... always like now it will be dip and I will get in.... never happened....not sure but is this still a buy at this price ?
We have new CEO in place.......huge backlog...... things can move at warp speed now in 2021...expect new collaborations for solar battery charging stations installations.....capacity expansions.....no debt....sweet....
What’s everyone thoughts on earnings & price prediction
Another fun for sun works... gonna surpass $24 today.. just be patient guys
Short sale interest is down to 7.65% . Today’s pull back is a market event. It has to do more with inflation and new market rules and restrictions so don’t let today worry you. I just bought 200 more shares 5 minutes ago
Be prepared for $12......supercharged green stimulus this year....more surprises ahead....
"This is a $3 stock currently. Low float, solid revenues that will only continue to grow as time passes and states adapt to changing to Solar. Waiting for some big moves from this company."
"Watch out of new CEO announcment in early Jan....They just have to run and grow as Sunrun is doing... there will be a huge market for both..in Cali, and else where.... MC explosion is imminent. Happy Holidays !"
"If you noticed, SUNW rebound higher than most of her peers today. She isn’t giving up without a fight. That shows this baby going to the moon once stimulus arrives."
Going back to the support at 5.
Chick Carlisle is a great guy. He is 100 percent trying to make this company financially strong. I am confident he will do it. I am on board and not selling..
trading like for sure it won't be around in a year
This chart looks like our dictators approval ratings.
seed has a 3.7 million share float.hard to believe.what will happen when meme people start on it.$50 a share?
"Worthless money losing company, imo !!!!"
Can't wait for this stock to get back in the $22-25 range
Any news on earnings?? Lovely day
Just bought 950 shares. $20+ a share by end of July
I really have to just shake my head and ponder how it is i'm down 60% on this #$%$ !!!!
"$SUNW beginning ascent to the 3 digit summit! Predicting $50 by the end of this year with new government solar mandates, contracts coupled with analysts upgrades and solar boom! taking this low float 200 million company to atleast $50 by the end of this year. $50 will make it to a mere 1 billion company whivh compared to its peers would still be very cheap!"
So many day traders in this stock
"Hi all, does anybody have positive spin on the stock? Holding on with avg of 22 but down almost 67% from its high. GLTA"
If its gets below 17 this week its bearish but if it holds above 18. This will be bullish to 30$ in a month time.
"Sunworks is entering 2021 in a strong position with a cash balance of approximately $39.4 million and backlog of $42.6 million, which positions the Company to fulfill its near-term and long-term growth initiatives and strategic plans."
Big news is coming!!
The whole market is down just take a deep breath it’s gonna be ok When nasdaq correction is done !We gonna fly to 30$ again ! I wanna add 1000 more shares if it’s gonna go to 9 or 8 !
"I started a position today for SUNW, my reasons to buy:1. Insiders are buying SUNW.2. Short interest at 3.9%, very low short interest, a bullish sign.3. SUNW is trading near book value4. Energy stocks should outperform in 2018 due to crypto farming, invest in energy is like invest in crypto without the risk and volatility.The best stocks to buy are the stocks with low institutional ownership, once the fund managers starts to accumulate, you will lose the massive upside potential."
$SUNW back to 10 soon !!
"Last year, I refused to hold SPWR. The financial balance was in a struggle mode. Many prediction stated that it would hit 40s. I regret doubting the power of solar. SUNW is in the same position as SPWR. I believe that it will hit 40s. If ISUN is able to turnaround all the solar will."
Huge move today. Broke the downtrend. $8 is next resistance zone. LOAD THE BOAT> 30% upside.
this stock certainly teaches you patience...
The solar stocks are 70% off their highs. Any idea if they’ll ever go back there. I need some help with the outlook on solar. The infra bill seems to be doing no good to solar
"Good evening, from the east coast. Could anyone provide me a compelling reason to invest in this company? I’ve read about the disappointment/fabrication on the 3D cell which is in the past. California appears to endorse solar for new residential construction, which is great, I’m just not sure how Sunworks benefits as they appear to be more aligned with agriculture. Their multi office locations worries me because of the overhead nut. From a financial perspective, everything looks negative and my fear is that March 12th earnings report may reduce the share price to new lows. Am I missing anything?"
Looks like it does not want to dip today  well money coming in and its recovery. Could it be on its way to $18 or $20 
"This is a good time to buy. Mondays markets generally drop in all stocks. It has already started going up. When prices are low, that is the best time to buy. I just bought 350 more."
Whoever is selling their shares before the earnings call are being bought thanks! ￼
Major uptick today. Up 7% this morning.
"Got taken to the woodshed today. Thought about moving on, but saw it was 24% down. I not taking that loss. Now just gotta wait for Uncle Joe and the Green Brigade to save the day."
Remove this joke from the Market!
Perfect stock to buy on the dip. This one has a lot of growth ahead!!!
"Scroll down to see, but on Wednesday, Sept 1st, I predicted we'd be below $6.00 by the end of the month."
the higher prices from raw materials ( to build the solar cells ) will drive the pps even more down
"just added 500 more shares, definitely see this company breaking the 30's in the next 3 months"
