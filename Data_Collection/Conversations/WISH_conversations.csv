"36.8 million volume. 8.5$/ tomorrow, hoping for 20$+ in 2022"
"I’m holding 30,000 shares long. I’ll consider selling it around 150-200.00, estimate timeline, 2/3 years"
Hopefully this holds 7 today and says goodbye to the 6's...have to start building higher supports
what the? tutes are accumulating today many over $1 million buys
Morgan Stanley purchased 1.85 million shares of Wish yesterday..that should tell you something ;)
Leo is the kind of guy who orders something online with a 4 week delivery window and complains about it every day within that 4 week period.
If this stock ever moons I’m treating all longs here to the Sizzler.
Have you people actually bought anything on wish?
somethings brewing again
Amazon 2.0!
Reses mother of dragons CPO Tarun Jain and CTO Farhang Kassaei
Just bought some stuff from wish that I could have bought on Amazon for double the price. It is worth the shipping delay to me to be able to buy more on WISH. I have to admit it was kind of fun using the app too. It’s a little like bargaining at a flea market looking for the best price and shipping cost lol
"Seems pretty obvious that the bottom has been found and tutes are loading again. In Jackie, Peter, Tarun and Farhang we trust"
Do Not Panic~!
It's funny when people complain about the delivery time of items bought on Wish. Wayfair takes just as much time if not longer but their stock price is flying. What do you expect when you buy items from merchants from all over the world? Teleport the items?
massive Gap to fill all the way up to $10 once we pass 750 it's smooth sailing with no resistance
I ‘ve been using wish app for a couple years. Happy with the products. “You paid for what you get “ No complaint!
So amazon buys out affirm with partial payment system and wish already has this option lol.
"If AMC and GME can rise with massive debt and no revenue, we have nothing to worry about ......Hold and you will be rewarded !"
"hi, we can use one of those 30-40 cent bursts again right now, thank you"
"it takes balls of steel to buy at the lows and when companies struggle early on, but that's how you make the big profits!! good luck longs!"
"Everyone, this morning we say ""Goodbye"" to $6.00, we will never see this number again. Any new investors that brought in at $6 you're about to be rich very soon."
here we go  8s this week
Insiders reported acquiring stock yesterday￼. sec.report
Someone knows something
Up 0.50% on no volume not bad
Going to 8 tomorrow
"Buy all of your shares before management busts out with a fat press release that will ignite another huge run like last time.Wish is trading at less than 2 times sales again and is in 3rd place behind Amazon and Ebay as one of the largest online global e-commerce companies operating out of the US that sells to over 100 countries with the most downloads in the Google Play Store than Amazon,Ebay and Alibaba.Jackie Reses is going to turn Wish into a homerun grand slam from these manipulated undervalued prices like she did with Square.This is a manipulated double bottle.Compare Etsy's and Snap's market capital valuation and their annual revenues to Wish.And look at their max charts and you will know where Wish is going in the future because those 2 companies are a joke compared to Wish.BOOM!WISH IS A DIAMOND!!!!"
Can’t wait for Monday
"Linkedin yesterday new PAYMENTS DEPT being created. ""This is a very high visibility role with the opportunity to strike strategic partnerships to help solve some unique & challenging problems faced by billions of underbanked & unbanked shoppers across the globe."""
Just as a reminder Etsy traded at like 6 dollars a share now trading near 200 with only like 2 billion in revenue that’s less than wish…
"Famous recipe for a month. In the last half hour, shorts have lowered our price and devalued the all-day price."
"34k call options waiting to be hedge if the price goes above $7.50, if that happened OH DEAR, Monday."
"Bought stocks of wish , starting to buy through wish app way more cheaper than amazon for same item."
Just 1 share ok! It’s not about qty it’s about locking the orders up at this point. Just buy 1 share all longs and watch what happens!!!
Squeeze yet?
"This is Ground Control, we are clear for lift off!"
Squeeze near beware
If it goes down I'll add more
just keep buyin fomo will drive this up to 20$+
Jackie has been tweeting about WISH for the first time - 2x this week. She's trying to reassure bulls and say #$%$ to the doubting bears that she's there for us.
"Looking good, longs!"
Wish creating in house Fintech according to new job listed yesterday on LinkedIn. Makes sense as ex Square Jackie Reses joined in mid May
I think next quarter results will beat analysts. Do not sell and keep it for good returns
Swing traders under 7.00 are fine now. Now we focus on the 8s
"Wish is looking to hire our first team member to lead the business development efforts for the payments team. You will work closely alongside leadership, product managers, data science, finance, legal & compliance to identify new payment & fintech partnership opportunities, influence our regional payment partnerships strategy, as well as manage existing global strategic partnerships."
We flying
"Buy for the new management (new CPO, CTO, Exec Chair/co-head) and hold. Chipotle is classic example of how new mgmt can completely change the story. Stock went up 400% since new CEO came to Chipotle from Taco Bell and completely overhauled the logistics, advertising and brought in new staff much like WISH is doing. It will be faster than you think and those getting in now will be hugely rewarded."
Staying on course for long term investors reward is great  be patience the best is yet to come. 
"If big boys wanted to make real money, they'd LET this thing fly!"
"Wish is the 3rd largest online e-commerce company in the US and one of the largest online shopping e-commerce companies in the entire world.It's Amazon,Ebay and Wish.Jackie Reese is on board and do you have any idea of her experience level?She helped make Square into a massive company and she also worked for Alibaba and Yahoo.Look at Etsy's revenues l,market capital valuation and Etsy's max chart and you will know where Wish is headed."
"MACD of the daily is converging, showing price action is getting ready to go bullish. Last time this happened, during a dip also, five days later we opened at $7.90 and closed at $11.63. Will history repeat itself?"
Fair price is 50ish..
Wish seems to be becoming EU’s new darling with the payment license approval and also Reses is on the board of both Affirm and Wish! Wish is so undervalued and unappreciated in stock price for the amount of business it generates
"$WISH that’s all you have to do family is buy 1 share a day, let the computers see all the buy orders. Big movement let’s keep it going."
Wish has a dream team with Reses making fintech deals all over and more insiders buying stock today along with software engineers and other jobs being filled with silicone valley talent. This is a no brainer in the long term. In 2-3 years we will be trading at 60+ a share
"Just got off the phone with Justin Trudeau, wish is heading to 12.75 by 2pm EST"
"How many people here are trapped in Wish,Clov, Sklz, FSR, Didi. I bet over 50 percent of us are bag holders . The good news , one day we will ride space shuttle to the moon ."
"Just bought 100 more shares!! 5,100 and rising"
I don’t know what the.. short doing but WISH going to be like BBIG soon. Warning 
"Sept 10, $8 massive call volume. We will see $16 call in September!"
I worked when Amazon started out and many of my fellow workers bought Amazon but gave up and dumped. Have seen lot's of these kinds of stocks start. This is one of them believe me.
Don't think too much.. Just buy and hold. Do you really believe wish is really trading at these prices? This is a discount.. Very cheap and you're dilusional to not add these prices in your porfolio.. This is a triple digit stock in the making.. Fair valuation now is 50ish.. Stop bashing this stock and start buying at these very cheap prices.. Christmas comes will have you by surprise..
Leo is the kind of guy who wipes from back to front and doesnt stop until he hits his outie bellybutton.
"I know that every new company has growing pains,in this case sales and marketing. I am sure the professionals running this company will figure ways to tackle this. So patience is the key. Worry not."
"Again I'm going to repeat, for those who think they can get in later or want to buy at a lower share price news of a new CFO or a buyout (M&Q Queen Reses at the helm) can come at any time. Also don't forget nobody expected a new CTO or CPO. Many surprises"
this spring is ready to blow
"only a matter of time before that gap up to $9.34 from Aug 12th is filled. they tend to do that like 95% of the time for some reason. i will take those odds any day except Sundays, a day of rest."
"Down a lot, looking for a big rebound!"
Keep calm & buy wish
Linkedin shows over a dozen new jobs listed the past week for 1Sansome in product design. The label while only a few months old must be doing well for them to want to continue expansion
Time to fill the gap to $9.34 from Aug 12th
Gary Gensler said they are going after dark pool trading I wonder if the new regulations are about to take hold
looking good
Should I buy in at 7.10?
The news is out!!! AFRM to partnership with WISH!! Buy all you can and hold 8k shares 6.85 Lets go WISH!!
There is a chance to explode and start seeing Bloomberg posts etc. it’s a very risky bet but what are we doing here?
Galileo fund went from holding 100 million shares to only 3 million.
"so U think it's worth putting $100k on this , so tempted to see at this price ! ?"
"I think 1sansome can be the real deal and compete with shein. Once they brand it properly and have good customer service. They already have a logistics advantage. I looked at some of shein’s criticisms on App Store. And most comments were about shipping, using kids in their warehouses etc. wish needs to find a way and capitalize.what do you guys think of 1sansome? Still very new."
Hang on fam going triple digits!!!
"Wish's sales are 2.2b.The total market capitalization is 4.1b.Psr 2 only.The most surprising thing is that there are 500 million app downloads.With this scalability and outstanding technology, it will become a platform company."
8.5 is the real stock price for today
"alot of bashing, I use to do that too, when I missed the ride "
if this hits 30 i can actually buy land and build a home for me and my family.
Dreamt about 52$ tonight
I bought lordstown motors a week ago and they just announced a new cfo. rocketed 35% this morning. that stock was heavily shorted like wish. once wishes new cfo is announced which could be any day you bet your but this is going to fly
People saying low volume for WISH but it's the 16th most active stock in the NYSE today and has been top 20 most active volume for 3 months now
I wouldn’t mind a gamma squeeze today 
Payment for Order Flow should ABSOLUTELY be banned by the SEC.
By the looks of things Affirm made a deal with Amazon...Wish next?
"Management is keeping quiet but we can all see huge developments behind the scenes. Shipping issues have been resolved by implementing Wish Express, Wish Local, several postal deals so now they are focusing on adding higher quality merchants, cracking down on low quality merchants and going after brands. They are also hiring over a dozen Product Mgrs for their new women's fast fashion 1Sansome. Payments and adding Fintech are also new areas of focus. At $7 I'm happy to get in early before this explodes. For those who think they can get in later news of a new CFO can come at any time as well as a buyout esp with M&Q queen Reses."
Monday we will see 8 to 9. Based in valuation of other ecommerce business not even making a dime this is way way undervalued. I see it at 25 minimum in few months.Good part is they have the platform for sellers and not a supply chain which can cause huge issues.
"The HF's and Market Makers are delta hedging the $7.00 call options, if we can get the price above $7.50 that's another 18k call options the HF's needs to delta hedge. WISH price will be above $8.00 by Friday."
is the wish squeeze happening this week?
Can’t really average down from my 12$ cuz i got already like 10k shares and no money left . But I’m holding and believing the potential. Sell price limit set at 100$
Who else thinks WISH will be sky rocketing soon?
Wish could become a baby Mercolibre e-commerce coupled with Fintech for their 90M users in 100 countries
Premarket 
"Woot woot good news on the way, load more before it explodes. Woot woot "
We know that Wish will increase over time and go up to 30 $. so do not sell at a loss. HOLD and Wait.
Buy now when you can. No different $6.30 or $7.30 or even $8 when this stock goes to $100/share in future.
SHORT Squeeze COMING TOMORROW WISH $ 15-30
HOLD and buy if you can…..
"I'll take small, steady gains. We don't need pump and dumps.Also, I ordered an outdoor solar light. Came in 3 weeks and works great. Packaging was decent and even had a personalized thank you note. Hopefully quality assurance picks up so that every transaction is as smooth as mine was."
"The Czech Republic national post office signed a contract with Wish for fast delivery, Wish will manage all taxes and customs fees for their customers. Nice..."
"Monday but today is a good day, seems so."
Reses is on the board of both Affirm and Wish! Affirm Holdings is starting the week strong after announcing a pivotal partnership. The fintech firm that's best known for its buy-now-pay-later services announced Friday evening that it's teaming up with Amazon to bring its services to the platform. The company said its testing its payment services on Amazon and plans to widely debut the option within the coming months. The company plans to offer monthly payments for purchases of $50 or more. AFRM is starting the week strong after the late Friday announcement. It's up 42.8% in today's premarket.
I have no idea what will happen tomorrow any thoughts??
Have a nice day my WISHBULLS
Rocket time
$WISH is combination of AMZN and AFRM in the making!

Ohh shorts daddy is here

Ohh baby! Leo the lion tongue
buyout?
Exec Chair Jackie Reses negotiated Alibaa's IPO. The CEO new CTO and CPO all last worked for Google. Amazon and Baba tried to buy WISH for 10 billion in 2015. Meanwhile Reses the queen of M&A is working for bonus shares that fully vest if the stick is $25-36 range about the same as a 15-20 billion buyout
Slow rise 50....
Thank god I covered my short position at around $6.50.. looks like it’s heading to $10.
Look for some big trades at the end of the day... people are pushing this up.The $8 and 8.50 Sep. 24th options are big volume
Reses is not only responsible for creating Fintech at Square but a board member of Affirm. Get ready
"Wish is doing and lots of progress faster orders more products less complicated web . Orders￼￼ pick up at the same day, you can find all the products you need and these worldwide￼￼￼￼￼"
"I ordered an L.E.D light 16 days ago and they arrived today. Tracking took a couple days but I am very happy with the lights,price, and delivery time."
Price prediction next week?
"Not a matter of IF but of WHEN. In Jackie, Peter, Tarun and Farhang I trust"
Picked up a wish order recently and they had a mountain of wish packages. I couldn’t believe it. It was such a small store. It looked like they had 100 packages piled up lol 
Muted Leo today. Never said a useful thing here. You eat it.
"I wonder if this has something to do with the Amazon news partnering with Affirm. Hot sector, baby! Let's do this."
If Tim line is wish will be a successful business. I’m holding long and strong. I will be buying 1 share tomorrow to support the cause. Everyone should buy just 1 share everyday to support the cause here
I sold all my shares just now. Should rocket tomorrow or see a random spike just about now.
Anything under 50.00 this year is unacceptable
Lets go wish!
Dont sell keep buying !!!
Slowly but surely $30.00 by the end of September
got my item from wish a week early and it's exactly what I wanted. good quality too
There's been news almost every day if you pay attention but they are too busy making changes and deals vs trying to pump the stock up. Newest deal was with Czech post office a couple of days ago which allows tax exemption on EU sales. Baba has the same deal
"Exec Chair Jackie Reses just posted her second tweet giving a shout out to Wish Shopping. She's been quietly working behind the scenes. This female billionaire powerhouse from Square, Yahoo, Goldman Sachs Alibaba will send us"
bashers may be working for either a hedge fund or someone wanting to drive the price down for a buyout. they also pay off analysts or analysts are pressured by the banks they work for. lot's of games and manipulation on Wall Street
"Still holding. Increased my position. 30,000 shares. I exited Ai, affirm, posh, sumo. Added 10,000 more wish. Added back 1000 Bigc 5.60 cheaper a share. Added back ozon x 1000 shares 3.50 cheaper. I’ll look at ai and sumo on end of sept after earnings. Wish is a long term millionaire making stock for me. Look to see wish around 100.00 in 2/3 years. Perfect time when I need a house out of this jurisdiction, son Will go to a different middle school. Free house. I want to thank you short sellers and weak hands for making this happen for me. ;)"
Just buy 1 share today in this movement that’s all it will take!!! Just 1 share orders!!
"Today, Reses is an active fintech angel investor through her family office, Post House Capital, and serves on the board of notable industry players including digital bank Nubank and buy-now-pay-later company Affirm. In May, she was appointed executive chairman of e-commerce marketplace Wish.https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2021/08/25/jackie-reses-square-fintech-becomes-billionaire/?sh=7c02dfa13b68"
I WISH this was $10 
"Download WISH app and use it. If u bought WISH stock but still buy in amazon or ebay, please check you logic."
I did my kart I bought 3 shares 9 times today!!! ;)

"145,264 Acquired by Just Brett,145,264 acquired by Oliver Jennifer￼,581.057 by Shah Devang,581,057 by Lou pai Vice President"
Wish will be my weaner this weekend
I went from short position to long on $Wish. Something big is brewing.. some kind of partnership with major e-commerce players or take out bid.. this is going back to $20 in next couple of months.
"guess what, If it pops tomorrow. 10- 15 % don't sell. They want you to take money off the table so they can grab the cheap shares and drive the stock up even higher. Too many retail Investor's, they're trying to shake us off. To the moon "
"WISH is a Silicon Valley baby (American company) that had it's IPO less than 1 year ago 12/20. CEO from Google with unique AI technology. Jackie Reses joined 5/12 as co-head/Exec Chair - ran Fintech at Square, Finance at Yahoo and shepherded Alibaba IPO. CTO Farhang Kassaei joined 7/12 from Google and Ebay Marketplace, CPO Tarun Jain from Google, Flipkart joined 8/2. 650 new hires mandated by Reses including new CFO who will be another big poach"
Cannot WAITTTTT to break through 7.20. This is annoying
Best items to buy on Wish.....Go!
funny to see bears trying to bash when the stocks up 5 to 8 percent
wish on a steady ride up..let's keep it going
"very nice price 7,29 , buy and hold may be the sky "
oversold and way undervalued. holding long on this bull
8 today
Dollar Tree of e-commerce is a huge market in over 100 countries to serve low income many of whom rely on their cells and people wonder why it had 2.5 billion in revenues last year and was the 3rd most downloaded shopping app in the world
WISH is filling up job positions fast and just as quickly adding new jobs. Today I see over a dozen new jobs in different US cities posted for Product Designers for their new 1Sansome women's fast fashion label and app.
No squeeze. I will take 8$+ for today
WISH has a potential in the future for 5G retail internet business. It will bounce back very fast when school starts and Christmas shopping. The best is yet to come. Staying on course for long term investors reward is great.
"Certain things in life you just can’t stop, death, taxes and wish to 100.00, ohh and Olegs constant annoyance"
Come on longs let’s allBuy 1 share today as a commitment to this stand! Just 1 share let’s add. I’m not charged a brokage fee and what will it cost us! 7.00??? . That’s nothing even if you paid mess in average just buy one share in support of this movement!!!
this might fill that gap up to 9.34 today if squeezed hard enough. so far so good!
Shorts will not wait for some big news to hit the wire that everybody knows is coming anyway. Hence they may take profits here instead of covering at double digits. Should be back above $10 by September/October.
Weekly reminder that I’m never selling this stock and I’m holding until $100
$8 end of week LOL
Wish seems to be becoming EU’s new darling with the payment license approval and also Reses is on the board of both Affirm and Wish! Wish is so undervalued and unappreciated in stock price for the amount of business it generates. Only a matter of time before Wish become's America's new darling.
AMZN - outWISH - in
100$ soon !!!
"I”d been in this situation before, SNAP and GME, its not always about the profit, its how the business will do in the future, a business that will excel. Longs know that this stock is undervalued. See you at the top to all that believes."
Me and my shares after the new CFO is named.
"Wish app.very addictive. I am putting together my third order. My sense is as more merchants from other countries discover wish and latch on,the customer base will grow.Nothing but upside. Do download the app and order. Its ok to be addicted."
"For people who are looking to reduce cost basis and are patience, look for a Green Day and sell covered call close to your buy price. If buy price is too far from the current price, I feel 9 dollar is a good mark on a weekly basis to sell covered calls against on a Green Day. I made 20 cents per share in last 2 weeks selling covered calls. That’s 12,000 dollars on my 61,000 shares."
For the cause just 1 share family. This movement will be huge. Just 1 share please
Buying my Halloween costume on WISH app
Low volume and low interest in this sinking ship. The only interest is from the 20 or so dreamers on this Yahoo page. Truth is customers are leaving WISH in record numbers. I had better order some Christmas light now if I want to get them by December. lmao
Everyone buy just 1 share tomorrow that’s all it will take!! Just 1 share! We will get another bump!! We are all in this together let’s do this!!
10 by Friday ?
Gm family! Everyone just buy 1 share today just one!!!! If we all just buy 1 share it will go up!!!

Again huge news. WISH is looking to create a business development team for PAYMENTS according to Linkedin today. Fintech dream team being led by ex Square head of Fintech and Finance Jackie Reses. She is also on the board of Affirm. Get ready
Wall Street Bets is all over this
"For ppl that don't know, obviously wish stock price is manipulated by Hedge fund lol all u need to do is buying it cheap, hold until they no longer able to control it. When the demand flushing in. thats how u make money in stock market, transfer the money from impatient to patient. And you investing a company on their revenue, income, growth and their asset: cash, etc."
Link for job listed yesterday Senior Business Development Manager - Payments that states this is a new department being created. Looks like success of Affirm and our begging made Jackie re-evaluate and want to make us into another MercoLibre. Great leaders have open and flexible minds. The people have spoken. https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/searchkeywords=Contextlogic&location=United%2BStates&geoId=103644278&sortBy=DD&currentJobId=2584063688&position=10&pageNum=0

She is currently an Executive Chair at Wish and serves on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.I wonder what she has in store for WISH"
Not much juice for shorts at this level.. Hedgies are trying to shake out retailer investors with their stocks is like stealing in broad daylight!
I made a wish and it came true. It will be the winner of 2021-22
Brick and mortar dead for now during Delta variant. online shopping to make a comeback.

"Not holding daily gain suprise suprise...up 10% in 5 days but just wish it hold it's gains for once...just sad to see..always a struggle...long and strong 5,000 shares"
I went to my Wish Local today to pick up my order (saved on shipping) and asked the guy behind the counter if they got a lot of Wish packages. He said they had 100-200 packages waiting. As he spoke a mailman walked in with another huge package from Wish
"I feel like a genius for having bought 10k shares at 7.05$ Holding for the next 10 years to retire with it, this is the next Amazon"
Staying long till the wheels fall off or the  hits the moooon!
there is nothing left to short. i dont understand why all just jump on board and lets all ride to the moon all win. its so simple. its like LA traffic if everyone would stay in there lane and stop switch lanes traffic would go smoother but no you sit in traffic for 2 hrs to get a mile
"Ohh Leo, roll my dough"
Just the beginning Friends. HOLD!
Will it be $ 10 tomorrow and $ 33 on Friday?
I got 20 shares average cost of 12.27! Not much I know but hey it all adds up
Amazon eyes on this 
Checkout what Jackie Reese just tweeted on Twitter in the Wish Stock Group on Facebook.Wish will soon have news.Let's not forget ContextLogic is the parent company of Wish.
Something is brewing and I like it……Just Sayn’

Leo is the kind of guy who orders stuff online but puts in the wrong address so he never gets what he ordered.
"I just bought 4 more shares. Had an extra 30 bucks cash sitting in the account. I figured .... why not ... let's do this, WISH!!!!"
Posted up 0.50% on no volume not to bad just at the right time now up 1.75% hahaha
Loading!
"I just realized where I saw this business model before, DC Comic's in the 1970's, back of the magazine they had this section where you could order stuff, send 9.99 get an rc car or what have you, I remember as a kid living in those pages they made everything looks so big and cool, that's what wish reminds me of."
Over 1.4 million shares bought from insiders yesterday$$$$$)$$)))))￼
Amazon getting so scared they are trying to copy Wish with the buy now pay later service
Just buy 1 share a day!!!! OverLoad the computers let themProcess the orders!!!

CORPORATE NEWS I WISH
Shorts did their thing this morning
"eBay charges both buyers and sellers fee and vig on every transaction. Wish connect customers to merchants directly cutting out the middle person. eBay is obsolete. Wish is aligning itself with fintech and crypto and like all good things, in time we will reach the moon. Still have my limit sell order at 69.69. Contextlogic isn’t just about wish it will become a more of a conglomerate soon."
"I looked at the WISH site with the wardrobe. 1Sansome is a very bad name. But if customers shorten it and remember it as 1S? It is already short, strong and easy to remember. And Wish is part of ContextLogic so no one calls it that. It is important that new ideas are launched. WISH will go to heaven either quickly with a short squeeze or only next year without a short squeeze but it will go over $ 50."
Best time to buy is when a stock is oversold. RSI for WISH under 30. Buy low sell high
Many of you will be surprised when they will see the short squeeze up to $40￼￼
Tomorrow 8+?
tomorrow would be the perfect day for news
Lunch time coming
we love wish

oleg you continue to show up only when this is going up and continue to complain about brotie like a scorned girl. You even went over to the digital ally page to spam that and him. I have followed dgly for years and neither of you were on it. I am starting to think you are one. what is your purpose other than being that fly that lands on your food when your trying to eat outside. nothing you say will influence people to buy or sell especially wish. post facts or go away already.

Leo I just took a number to sit in you’re face
The former Google executives that were just hired will most likely turn things around. The best is yet to come
shorts stop getting greedy and cover. you made your money and this is the bottom. move on before you lose all your gains
LeBron's jersey has wish logo.
"Whats the point to come here and cry? Just close ur positsions and move on if you dont believe nor like the company. Think if you come cry on this board avout ur 3k investment then it will go back up?IPO price seems way too high but rather than that, im chilling. All or nothing, gonna wait and let this one sit, made the investment, made the decision, not crying!NB! Never invest or trade what you cant afford to lose and keep the feelings as far as possible."
I bought 15 orders of 1 share today
Definitely going to 50-90.00 this year we are buying everyday 5 shares 5 times
Wish reported 5 billion dollars in cash in their account!!!
"I said it would hit 7, look at me now"
Squeeze it to $50!
winning ....
Etsy made 1.7 billion 2020 in revenue. Has a 25.6 billion market cap. Trading 15x forward revenues. Wish has a 4.3 billion market cap with a revenue of 2.5 billion in 2020. It's Trading around 2x forward revenues. Mind boggling stuff. At 15x forward revenues Wish would trading at just over $50 a share. This is a rocketship waiting for lift off.
it will close green 7.15

If we break $7.50 the next area of resistance is around $8.20
Options Traders are saying this is going up in the short term.
I'm an investor not a gambler. WISH is oversold and has fantastic new hires driving it. This is the time to get in. Be patient and watch your investment grow over time. I have no doubt that a year from now we will be at $15 a share if not sooner if a buyout or other big news comes
"Finished green, I like it!"
"I am holding shares. Used WISH app recently, ordered the stuff, amazing improvements over the time. I will hold long term, Not worrying about the short term earning noise. The price will correct to the better earning and improved revenue in future."
Everyone who sold WISH going to regret this
Guy on this board says he bought wish at 28. I feel if he’s patient enough he will triple his money in a couple of years. Etsy trades 15x forward earnings and made less revenue than WISH if wish trades at 15x forward earnings WISH would be at over $50 a share right now. Buy and HOLD
The best is yet to come for long term investors. Staying on course. Be patience. It will bounce back very fast when the business pick up.
Headphones came in. Work great and pretty happy with the whole process
1. any e-commerce giants take over of WISH is the best wishes of us holders. 2. we can help ourselves by visiting the WISH site and shopping to our best capacities. what say??
Wish is going to 100.00 in the snap of a eye!
Leo is the kind of guy who's face makes onions cry.
stop watching this it is in consolidation. set it and forget it. this is a long term hold. relax
"I have and will continue to be long on AcuityAds. The research shows that the potential here is great. In 5-10 years we really could be looking at another Trade Desk type company. However, at this time I see some other excellent opportunities. Although I find some of the recent postings a little obnoxious (less so with Akiko but more so with Isabelle and Loren, no offence) I did do my due diligence and investigated the other companies being promoted here in greater detail. Up to this point, I have simply ignored them. They appear though upon greater analysis to be the real deal. As a result, I have decided to sell 20% of my AcuityAds position and replace it with Wishpond. I have sold another 20% of my position of AcuityAds and have replaced it with Adcore. I will keep 60% of my AcuityAds position for the long haul. Given the low entry price for Wishpond and Adcore right now I feel confident that these moves will pay off. As a long term buy and hold investor all three look good and should make shareholders a lot of money. GLTA. #wish.v #adco.ca"
