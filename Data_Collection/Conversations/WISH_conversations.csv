"Wish is doing and lots of progress faster orders more products less complicated web . Orders￼￼ pick up at the same day, you can find all the products you need and these worldwide￼￼￼￼￼"
We know that Wish will increase over time and go up to 30 $. so do not sell at a loss. HOLD and Wait.
"I'll take small, steady gains. We don't need pump and dumps.Also, I ordered an outdoor solar light. Came in 3 weeks and works great. Packaging was decent and even had a personalized thank you note. Hopefully quality assurance picks up so that every transaction is as smooth as mine was."
Wish seems to be becoming EU’s new darling with the payment license approval and also Reses is on the board of both Affirm and Wish! Wish is so undervalued and unappreciated in stock price for the amount of business it generates. Only a matter of time before Wish become's America's new darling.
Guy on this board says he bought wish at 28. I feel if he’s patient enough he will triple his money in a couple of years. Etsy trades 15x forward earnings and made less revenue than WISH if wish trades at 15x forward earnings WISH would be at over $50 a share right now. Buy and HOLD
Going to 8 tomorrow
"I have and will continue to be long on AcuityAds. The research shows that the potential here is great. In 5-10 years we really could be looking at another Trade Desk type company. However, at this time I see some other excellent opportunities. Although I find some of the recent postings a little obnoxious (less so with Akiko but more so with Isabelle and Loren, no offence) I did do my due diligence and investigated the other companies being promoted here in greater detail. Up to this point, I have simply ignored them. They appear though upon greater analysis to be the real deal. As a result, I have decided to sell 20% of my AcuityAds position and replace it with Wishpond. I have sold another 20% of my position of AcuityAds and have replaced it with Adcore. I will keep 60% of my AcuityAds position for the long haul. Given the low entry price for Wishpond and Adcore right now I feel confident that these moves will pay off. As a long term buy and hold investor all three look good and should make shareholders a lot of money. GLTA. #wish.v #adco.ca"
"Not holding daily gain suprise suprise...up 10% in 5 days but just wish it hold it's gains for once...just sad to see..always a struggle...long and strong 5,000 shares"

"Everyone, this morning we say ""Goodbye"" to $6.00, we will never see this number again. Any new investors that brought in at $6 you're about to be rich very soon."
Reses is on the board of both Affirm and Wish! Affirm Holdings is starting the week strong after announcing a pivotal partnership. The fintech firm that's best known for its buy-now-pay-later services announced Friday evening that it's teaming up with Amazon to bring its services to the platform. The company said its testing its payment services on Amazon and plans to widely debut the option within the coming months. The company plans to offer monthly payments for purchases of $50 or more. AFRM is starting the week strong after the late Friday announcement. It's up 42.8% in today's premarket.

Should I buy in at 7.10?
Family just buy one share today!!! Support the movement!
I'm an investor not a gambler. WISH is oversold and has fantastic new hires driving it. This is the time to get in. Be patient and watch your investment grow over time. I have no doubt that a year from now we will be at $15 a share if not sooner if a buyout or other big news comes

"If AMC and GME can rise with massive debt and no revenue, we have nothing to worry about ......Hold and you will be rewarded !"

"MACD of the daily is converging, showing price action is getting ready to go bullish. Last time this happened, during a dip also, five days later we opened at $7.90 and closed at $11.63. Will history repeat itself?"

It's funny when people complain about the delivery time of items bought on Wish. Wayfair takes just as much time if not longer but their stock price is flying. What do you expect when you buy items from merchants from all over the world? Teleport the items?
Thank god I covered my short position at around $6.50.. looks like it’s heading to $10.
Amazon getting so scared they are trying to copy Wish with the buy now pay later service
Fair price is 50ish..
My son asked me where do I see the price heading for wish? I showed him shopify price and sipped on my coffee.. My little man was shocked. Patience is key my friends. I will add more shares by Friday... Happy investing my friends and please stay rich..
