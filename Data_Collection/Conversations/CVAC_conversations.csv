"why Bayer matters: CVAC saw Bayer as its regulatory and manufacturing saviour, more so than GSK. With Bayer gone there is only GSK left as its only major industry partner. The loss of the first vaccine wasn't a worry, but major strategic partnerships matter. GSK has invested into CVAC so they at least are more likely to stick around. Does CVAC have a future? Definitely. But the road ahead will be more challenging now than before. Also we and they have to be honest, they've said things which only a few weeks later they contradict. Loss of confidence is a major problem. The only way out for them is a new deadly variant.."
"Amazing how people still believe in this company..,approval for the 3rd booster and 4th generation variant…it is such a shame, as CVAC was the frontrunner not so long ago…incompetent management ruined all scientific and technology achievements…"
I am staying far away from CVAC - It looks like it is going to drop off a cliff. I actually get way better stocks at http://alert-sounds.com/
mix 'n match approval from FDA anticipated this week. Expect a boost to NVAX and $CVAC as well:https://www.barrons.com/articles/fda-may-approve-mix-match-booster-shots-this-week-51634640350
This is going to below $10

"2 mini bits of good news. (1) German government has confirmed it has no plans to reduce its holding. (2) news reports in the UK of a greater need for a 3rd (booster) shot given higher infection rates compared to Europe (probably due to people having had their jabs earlier). ie 6-9month booster programme is all but certain. ie as much as the market wants to ""move on"" from covid, this virus is sticking around for a the foreseeable future in a big way. CVAC is very late to the party but it still has a chance in 2022"
"“New Vaccines Might Be Needed in 2022, BioNTech CEO Says”Hope CVAC is still working on the 2nd Gen. We keep hope in this…Last call for CVAC to my opinion…anyone else thinking same?"
"Lol, can anyone explain to me why Curevac is not dropping like a knife? Does Curevac have some kind of revenue? Thanks in advance, good luck with a zombie company."
Come to novavax before it happens.
"the termination of the bayer contract was obvious as GSK wants to produce it and keep the technology for their future success. As billionaires (SAP founder, Bill gates, Elon Musk) and GSK are highly invested, they will try to bring this vaccine to success. Furthermore Cvac is one of 4 mRNA companies worldwide, which have a mRNA-pipeline and experience in the field. Additionally germany had released in july that they are open to funding biontechs and cvacs vaccine production for next 8 years to keep the facilities and know how in germany. This company has more future than nvax for example. But it is a hard time until q1 2022 when this should go up again."
Will go to $9. Sell ASAP

Should I sell my cvac and buy arct?
They had some interesting insights about CVAC on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
overreaction. It was clear the original vaccine candidate wasn't going to go anywhere and that all companies would be focusing on 2nd gen vaccine. Phase 1 results of the trial is expect soon so an uplift is expectect especially at this level.
"If 2nd gen works, this will go back to $120 in a heartbeat."
"Pfizer showed that it has an extremely agile and swift management that is capable of flawless execution, with their COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Where other companies like $NVAX and $CVAC faltered, and where even $MRNA’s vaccine had been affected by Sweden and Denmark recently, Pfizer alone came out unscathed. Pfizer’s vaccine requires ultra low temperatures, lower than that of any other COVID-19 vaccine; but that did not slow down the rollout one bit. Pfizer’s vaccine is the first one to get emergency use authorization from FDA and is the first one to get full FDA approval. In May 2021, Pfizer’s vaccine was the first to get emergency use authorization for ages 12 to 15. Pfizer is currently working on a vaccine for ages 5 to 11 and already submitted trial data to FDA. What an awesome management!!!! I am impressed by them. Wish the stock reflected that…."
