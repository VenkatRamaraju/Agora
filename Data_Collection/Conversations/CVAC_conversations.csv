"A large part of the recent price increases of Biontech and Moderna seem to come from the increasing importance that market participants are granting the mrna technology and not the corona vaccine. Well, on this point, CureVac is also a leading company in this field and has a large development pipeline, researching the mrna technology for years. If it's this technology that is making Biontech and Moderna soar, then I don't understand why Curevac's share price isn't benefiting from it."

Nobody know why Spanish make better car but is true $li $xoev $nkla $cvac
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
This stock is a great opportunity. It was wrongly evaluated with first gen vaccine. Now first gen vaccine is going to be approved soon. Ceo of curevac Haas during last curevac video said that the vaccine will be approved for sure. Other collaborating companies are preparing for production. Soon stock will be back 150$

Anyone who buys Curevac now is gambling not investing.. stay away

The CVAC will get approval within a month. The rocket will fire at 120!
"CVAC goes up on a day with 1/4 volume than usual. I'm assuming most people here are not selling and just waiting to see what this can become. On my side, I was betting on better results from the first generation vaccine, and then I just stayed and bought more around 44. we'll see where this goes but I'm bullish on mrna (not moderna, the actual technology), so I'll stick around for some more, covid or no covid"
Will mrna bntx buyout cvac I think it’s possible?
still falling behind???
Curevac vaccine will be approved faster than Novavax.
Even this scam at 48% efficacy is up 7%. I’m done
We keep on Praying  that CVAC still will enter the market…that would be superb!
"Pfizer showed that it has an extremely agile and swift management that is capable of flawless execution, with their COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Where other companies like $NVAX and $CVAC faltered, and where even $MRNA’s vaccine had been affected by Sweden and Denmark recently, Pfizer alone came out unscathed. Pfizer’s vaccine requires ultra low temperatures, lower than that of any other COVID-19 vaccine; but that did not slow down the rollout one bit. Pfizer’s vaccine is the first one to get emergency use authorization from FDA and is the first one to get full FDA approval. In May 2021, Pfizer’s vaccine was the first to get emergency use authorization for ages 12 to 15. Pfizer is currently working on a vaccine for ages 5 to 11 and already submitted trial data to FDA. What an awesome management!!!! I am impressed by them. Wish the stock reflected that…."
I quit. Good luck guys
Couple of bucks per day….Confidence is coming back….variants will have a new soldier to consider soon…I started at 65$ a long time ago….didn’t sell at 130$ so let’s smile and wait….

The sec gen vaccine showed clearance of the virus in the lungs and nasal passages! Very effective vaccine.
fortunately all this BS with vaccination of a total population is going to the end.
They don't have a working vaccine yet and now they try to go to version 2.0 . Lol. Joke
What is bad news anyone can confirm please
"FYI --->>>> $NVAX ""Applications for conditional approval are pending before regulatory agencies of India, Indonesia and the Philippines, while the company has initiated filing for a rolling review of applications with the U.K. EU, Canada, Australia and New Zealand....."
"What is the meaning of a cancellation? Why do they need to cancel at this time before even getting the approval for their vaccine? Here are the probable reasons.1) They had a deadline to start the manufacturing, as the vaccine is not approved, they have to pay compensation for the period when they do not start manufacturing. Better to stop cost.2) Why they did not cancel the other contracts? Probably those contracts do not have a strict clause on when to start the production.I think if we ignore these manufacturing contracts, what is the probability that their vaccine will be approved? Any timelines to get it approved?"
Cvac is on track to get its vaccine approved. Time to buy!
Wow. Congrats everyone. I took my eye off of CVAC and boom . Congrats
Oefffff nice percentage uppp…whatsuppp 
People are still considering this stock a Covid play? There is much more beyond Covid!
"Curevac will have approval for sure. You should read some german press. Ceo of curevac Haas said last time that he is sure that they will have approval, main investor Dietmar Hopp said that he is sure, their main cso Splawski said that without doubt they will have approval for age group 18-60 and some others. And finally EMA said that they have nothing like the 50% efficacy threshold and they understsnd that new variants has emerged during curevac trials. The overall efficacy of curevac 1 gen vaccine for this age group was 53% but 100% efficacy against death and hospitalization. They will have authorization probably faster than Novavax!"
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Rightpicker.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
Back to $65 again and potentially buyout???
"“Lambda COVID variant, behind 1,000 cases in U.S., shows vaccine resistance”"
"The only way CVAC would compete and would be taken seriously is if their efficacy goes up to 90% Other than that is just illusion you’re playing with! Yeah it may go up, no doubt but it could drop easily too! So, do anybody knows if CVAC is running new trials or working on getting the efficacy higher?!"
strange JNJ booster shot made all vaccine stocks go down
"Lol, can anyone explain to me why Curevac is not dropping like a knife? Does Curevac have some kind of revenue? Thanks in advance, good luck with a zombie company."
Positive signs finally
"The preprint says: ""High antibody neutralizing capacity was observed with second generation vaccine across ALL VARIANTS, including the BETA, DELTA and LAMBDA variants.""This is great news, finally the vaccine will be efficient against all variants!!!"
We have a Ferrari which is parked in the garage. Can we think about this?
"It just come to my memory, Bancel (Moderna CEO) words regarding Covid vaccine: we don't want to have the first vaccine, we want to have the best vaccine. Will it happen with 2nd CVac vaccine? It would be really funny."
What’s keeping this up? Seriously why is this above ten bucks?
"Starting today, it's going to be a big jump."
Have they finalised their application with EMA?
Does anyone know what are they waiting for to apply with EMA?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT7TVEdxHVE&t=1202s
"Do you guys realize that this is only a monkey study? They are years away from approval, lol! BioNtech and Moderna is working for months already on new variants. Novavax will be approved soon, Inovio is doing Phase 2/3, And even Vaxart with important mucosal immunity and easy oral formulation is starting Phase II. CVAC lost the CoViD race!!!"
Current trading pattern for CVAC is similar to BNTX in July.
"i will hold til 5 bucks. if you don't know, i shorted this pump"

"Not only curevac have second gen vaccine, they will have soon approval of first gen. Curevac first gen vaccine is better in protecting against death-100% than Pfizer -93%."

"Two women in their 20s hit by Pfizer, brain bleeds one after another 2021.09.17. 4:38 PM JoongAng Ilbo Two women in their 20s have been receiving a series of petitions from the Blue House, claiming that two women in their 20s suffered brain hemorrhage after being vaccinated against the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19). view original Medical staff are busy at Bakae Hospital, Pyeongtaek-si, Gyeonggi-do, on the 4th, where the spread of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in Korea has increased by 1,725, and the cumulative number is 203,926. . yunhap news Petitioner A said on the 16th with the title, “Healthy 21-year-old daughter, cerebral hemorrhage after Pfizer vaccination. He complained of nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath, and collapsed from a cerebral hemorrhage in the emergency room of a university hospital.” ""Looking back, I resent myself for not being able to stop her daughter from being proactive in responding to the vaccine policy and giving her the remaining vaccine first,"" he said. Cheongwon-in's daughter is recovering from her successful surgery. However, concerns about her prognosis remain. Mr. A said, “Her daughter improved without major side effects and was discharged from the hospital. However, she still feels dizzy and complains of vomiting and headaches whenever she drives through uneven sections in her car."" Mr. A said, ""The government, focused only on improving the vaccination rate, said that it would take all responsibility, but practically there are few cases of authenticating side effects of vaccines."" On the same day, an article titled “Cerebral haemorrhage in 25-year-old woman after Pfizer vaccine was posted on the Blue House petition bulletin board.” “My nephew was a beautiful and healthy 25-year-old woman,” said the author of the article. “After administering the Pfizer vaccine at the age to bloom, she complained of a headache for several days, and eventually suffered a brain hemorrhage and was now unconscious in the intensive care unit of a university hospital. lying down,” he said. Mr. B said, ""I thought of a severe headache as a headache caused by a vaccine, and I only took a headache medicine for a few days and it got to this point."" ” he exclaimed.

What is the catalyst?
EMA will review Curevac clinical data in the coming weeks (see below link - 26:40).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RonCekqjXIg
We have great news about an mRNA therapy and this is down?
Another blow for Mr.Bill Gates fortunes. It has not been very lucky with Novavax so far. They want to save face with Novartis etc. but its vaccine efforts has been in vain and its future is written in the wall. Sorry lads
"Are we still waiting for 1st generation approval? Thousands of deaths can be avoided everyday. In Western countries, we are comfortably seated since we are almost all vaccinated. But, can we think on what's happening in India, Africa, South and Central America? EMA and FDA, please do your work in the fast and reliable way. Don't play corporate/country politics."
Nice move today hope it stays above 70….slowly we getting back 
Curevac soon will have approval of first generation vaccine! South American countries will buy all doses of their vaccine. The stock will explode.
"Sanofi will buy Translate Bio, pay $38 per share in cash ($3.2 billion). Translate Bio has mRNA technology and I think this is the reason why Curevac is up today"
"It's worth reading the cancellation release carefully. The reassessment for short-term demand is expected and on that basis alone shouldn't be a reason to be bearish. But there is also the kicker in the last sentence ""The parties agreed not to disclose financial details of the cancellation"". Ie maybe CVAC has had to pay to come out of the agreement, so a future loss on the horizon. Ouch. We'll find out when Q3 financials have been released. Having said that these are short-term concerns only, technology and longer term prospects are unchanged."
"haha There still testing on Monkeys. And they have to share their profits with GSK, just reinforces how much of a bargain Novavax is"
Moderna and Pfizer has lots of side effects with their big doses. Curevac has small dose with great tolerance and immune response lasting longer.
somebody knows something...
I think move to NVAX and come back can be a good idea - GLHope we all make the right choice
overreaction. It was clear the original vaccine candidate wasn't going to go anywhere and that all companies would be focusing on 2nd gen vaccine. Phase 1 results of the trial is expect soon so an uplift is expectect especially at this level.
Calm before the drop!
Old news! Another great way for the powers above to bring down the value
Curevac soon 500$!
Even lower then it dropped initially. #$%$
Curevac first gen vaccine immune response is lasting longer than moderna and antibody level don't drop after months.
Perhaps closing at 75 
No worries about these short term hickups. 2nd gen will be better and should generate income. If you’re invested in this company you shouldn’t have done it only as a Covid play anyway. This is a longterm hold.
Come to novavax before it happens.
It is clear that their first gen vaccine will not be authorized in the US. But this is far less clear for the EMA. I thought a bit more about it and to me this is too much of a gamble to hold a position for or against CVAC. I am planning to exit my position against CVAC in the next few days.
so let us buy also GSK to aggregate the profit
"CureVac Announces Contracts With WACKER And Celonic Terminated, Rentschler Biopharma And Novartis Unaffected; Says 'The decision was made in response to the reduced short-term peak demand for vaccines'Still waiting for EMA."
"Of note: institutional ownership is now almost 79%. 6 months ago it was barely 60%. Any thoughts here? Usually 80% institutional ownership or more is a very strong signal, unless I am missing something. Thanks."
"Let's compare Curevac to Biontech. Does an approved corona vaccine from Biontech, which will probably only ensure very high sales, as we have now, in the short to medium term, really justify a more than 7 times higher market capitalization? Regarding the valuable MRNA technology, I wouldn't say that Biontech is far behind Curevac because Curevac is a pioneer in this field."
Cooked and done. Failed with first and it will take another 2-3 yrs for the second which can fail too.This is worth around 10 only because of cash they have.
Back to 75$
CureVac is down 12.89% to 39.61
Abandon this stock now - mrna tech is coming to an end
"If MRNA and BNTX have the gold and the silver, this may take the bronze?Worth a gamble I think"

"The European Medicines Agency (""EMA"") said that it likely won't be until the end of the year that it will be in a position to determine the ""next step"" for CureVac's (CVAC +2.8%) COVID-19 vaccine. During a press briefing today, Marco Cavaleri, EMA's head of biological health threats and vaccines strategy, said the company has filed data that is ""quite important for us as a starting point to see where we are with this application,"" adding he expects that the agency will be in a better position by year end to determine the next step for the vaccine. Seeking Alpha contributor Chetan Woodun, who has a neutral rating on CureVac shares, says that investors should wait for concrete news about the company before investing."
How does a company with a vaccine that objectively failed maintain a 13b cap
The best company to invest money now. Soon the stock will explode because of 1gen vaccine approval and sec gen going into phase 1! MEGA BULLISH!!!!!!!!

"Why I am bearish (if people would have listened to my previous bearish predictions they would have made lot's of money, I made a little bit of money but was too cautious to make a big impact on my portfolio, based on uncertainties of EMA approval):1. CureVac dropped their 1st gen. efforts2. The company is still overvalued when comparing their market cap to similar companies with lagging mRNA vaccines 3. Their 2nd generation vaccine is nothing special. It doesn't include any amino acid modifications to adapt to current or upcoming variants. It uses the same full length spike as BioNtech/Pfizer"

"Great article about CVAC, their supply chain and raw materials reserve."
Curevac ceo sure that 1 gen vaccine will be approved!
"no news other than an mRNA printer engineer job opening at CVAC. Application for an EUA for CVnCoV is still pending and that would be a major catalyst if it happens. CVAC say they'll be applying but I just don't see it happening personally. Then there is 2nd gen vaccine CV2CoV. Preclinical is done. CVAC with GSK's help is planning to start clinical testing by the end of September. I expect the SP will improve somewhat when that happens (there's no ""if"" IMO). Judging by the timelines from last year it took 4 months to get P1 results in, so we should expect to have P1 announced by the end of Jan. That's 3 months later than it was for CVnCoV. So given we got P3 for CVnCoV in June, expect CV2CoV by Sep 2022. Personally I expect P1 for CV2CoV to go well. We know the technology works. So buying now with an investment horizon to Jan seems like a good move. And you have the sweetener of the bonus of an EUA for CVnCoV if it happens. BNTX and MRNA look very expensive in my mind. A massive part of their SP is the assumption that they will hit optimistic revenue forecasts in 2022 (eg $15-30bn for MRNA) and progress on other items in their pipeline. Even if 2022 is a bumper year for them, other companies will have completed trials for their covid vaccines by then so 2023 and onwards must surely be a lot more crowded. We also are waiting to see the outcome from the UK's mix 'n match trial. So all in entering at the current price for CVAC doesn't seem like a bad move. The concerns I have with CVAC is their being late and the limited pipeline compared to MRNA and CVAC outside of Covid. Oh, and next to no revenue... My 2 cents.."

Whats up with this dip?
"I ve seen preprint of sec gen vaccine. Its amazing! It produces 50x more antibody titers than first gen and it still uses only 12mg the smallest dose of all vaccines (moderna 100mg, Pfizer 30mg).Sec gen vaccine is designed with Harvard University and is much better and cheaper (only 12mg) than moderna or Pfizer."
"CVAC mess upNo one messed up a great opportunity to successfully bring one of the best mRNA vaccine like CVAC. It has probably one of the best mRNA technology. But, probably the worst ever management."
"First of all, I'm an investor in CureVac and Moderna. In my opinion it is a crime against humanity if the 1st generation of CureVac vaccines is not authorized for at least 18-60 years old. The results that should be compared are the number of deaths and hospitalizations as the virus continually mutates. How many people will die waiting for a vaccine just because the correct comparisons are not made, namely in Africa, India, South and Central America?"
I told you guys curevac vaccine will have approval faster than Novavax.
"Even in case Curevac would get their vaccine approved, no one would want it, because better choices are available."
They had some interesting insights about CVAC on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"If 2nd gen works, this will go back to $120 in a heartbeat."

An article in Financial times has suggested that curevac would get EU EUA fairly soon even if its effectiveness is 48 % .As curevac can be stored at room temp and would be useful in many developing countries with cold chain issues.

am I the only regular one here who knows how to search for new press releases? CVAC and Rentschler Biopharma are increasing production of CVnCoV (1st gen vaccine). Looks like they are confident to get their EUA and judging by the expiry data of the vaccine the news implies the application is going in soon.
Or 20%
Curevac soon will have vaccine approval. The stock will go back to 150$ !!!
They will have approval soon and sell all the doses to South American countries. Then they will secure money for sec gen vaccine and this is gonna be the blockbuster. Every country will buy their sec vaccine because it will protect against all variants. This stock will go to 500$ easily.
best short this year. I have been shorting from $100. hope this bill gates poison goes to single digits soon.

Will go to $9. Sell ASAP
WHY?????
"“New Vaccines Might Be Needed in 2022, BioNTech CEO Says”Hope CVAC is still working on the 2nd Gen. We keep hope in this…Last call for CVAC to my opinion…anyone else thinking same?"
buuy more now!!
They do it on purpuse to lower stock price and buy just before a jump. Do not sell! We will see curevac going up soon.
$41 Target
They had some interesting insights about CVAC on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
