Strong growth ahead that can streamline operations. Smaller company can execute much faster with cheap GE subsidiary purchase
I have one share of WAB I was holding 200 Ge shares. I might sell it and order a pizza.
"Wabtec is a key player and leader in the rail industry worldwide. I understand the GE integration has created major challenges, but I also believe the GE products give Wabtec more competitive advantages than they had prior to the merger. Still researching the company, but I like the idea of buying industry leaders when they're dealing with short term challenges. That's where I see Wabtec today. Not buying yet, but definitely under consideration in the low $60's. Once the GE integration is wrapped, wouldn't mind seeing WAB bring GBX into the fold as well. There isn't any replacement for rail, so the long term looks great in my opinion."
"I got 6 ""free"" shares of WAB this morning! I'm RICH!"
"Look into future, industry leader, all forms of current rail transport must and will expand. Think big - existing rails logically have space above, below and adjacent to current tracks. Just bought 100 shares to learn and track progress."
"the stock is the best buy on the board, after the GE deal a double or more"
I just got wabtec shares through Ge spinoff is this is good company should I keep shares or sell it
I like this stock for the long term but with a ton of it likely to hit the market in near term from GE and the GE stockholders see no reason to step up at this time.
I had a whopping 4 shares from the GE sale to WAB. I bought 96 shares in the dip in April. I sold a covered call this month for an $85 strike price. I'll let it go if the call is in the money.
"$35 an hour is $70,000 a year, plus benefits, plus overtime results in real cost of over $120,000 per labor employee. That's way too high for a factory worker. $22 an hour is in line with the rest of the world. The union is way out of line on this one and their workforce is going to find itself out of work. I dont blame management for standing firm on this one. Another golden goose killed by unions."
"Are there any longtime WAB holders on this board? If so, please share your reasons for holding the stock, and your evaluation of management. TIA"
GE selling shares messed up a solid quarter for shareholders. That's my take on this swift decline.
A screaming buy. No way this is not 75. Greatat PE. Dividens. They have little competitive in the locomotive industry
Hello $90 !!! So glad I bought this one!
Great earnings report. Good to see $76 per share. It will go higher.
"Way oversold, rail freights has a bright future with all the oil pipe projects being canceled."
"We are reaching a 3 year low for WAB with a top range of 113 and nominal price from the high 70’s to low 80’s. This is prior to the GE acquisition. Pressure on the stock is due to a second round of negotiations with the union and some risk as GE may need proceeds from WAB stock to continue operations. On 6/3 a strike may occur if agreements with the Union are not made. The drop in stock price reflects this event and once the trade deal is set I would expect a 2-3% rise in share price. WAB last quarter was strong, but its too early to tell how long it will take WAB to gain efficiencies of the combined companies. GE transportation was a customer of WAB and there are saving to be expected and redundancies to shave cost. Long term and at these levels WAB is a good buy. Technology in Rail have lagged other areas of transportation such as autonomy but eventually this will have to change and WAB is the leader in train control with products like PTC."
I took the free shares as a sign after losing with GE and added to my position. It's turning out to be my best performer. Wish I had more money to buy buy buy.lol
"I've 200 shares of WAB. Can't remember when bought.Also, have had GE for a long disappointingly time. Couldn't understand why advisor told me to HOLD."
"i received 48 shares, will this be taxable?"
Anybody know the cost basis that is recorded on the shares I received in the spinoff?

"I agree 100% regarding top management's pay being very high. I only hope it's tied to performance. If it is then I'm fine with that.I do have a concern regarding strikes. When I left the service and had no job my brother talked me into his job with a roofing company. It was a union shop, paying dues.I never had to work getting dirty but I did. A job is a job while living with my spouse's parents. I had a union card for roofing and sheet metal. In my town the Ford plant, a container plant and GE was on strike. As i went to work daily the workers would be getting warm next to a 55 gallon container keeping warm for over 16 months without pay.The container company closed, then the Ford plant next and finally the GE plant. All due to workers demanding a pay raise during a recession. It was bad timing on their part. Then came our company demanding higher hourly wages. I was happy just to have a damn job to pay my bills. No, I decided along with my brother, to continue working during our strike. I don't regret for a minute crossing lines to keep the company, with it's obligations to complete projects, on time. My dad was a loyal union electrical member all his life. He could work side jobs due to his expertise while on strike.My bottom line is, you have to choose what is right for your families well being. You can stand with your signs and burn wood when it's cold in that 55 gallon metal container. But in the end the company closes shop or moves to another location.The roofing company I worked for, after 75 years of business, folded. End of story"

"Am just reading about WABTEC, learning about the GE TRANS sale/merger? I have been offered to sell my less than 100 shares for a $7/share processing fee! Sounds a bit much to me. Also doesn’t sound beneficial to any stockholders with under 100 shares. Can anyone enlighten me to why the company is doing this?"
This is the ONLY company I can find that's working on a battery powered locomotives (if anyone knows of others let me know)..... The time has come to merge the most efficient form of ground transportation on earth with most efficient form of energy on earth!! I've seen that many North American railways (I own shares in 2 of them) are promoting their goals in reduction of Co2!!!! There isn't a better or more visible way to do this than adding a few electrified/hybrid consists into their operations!!!
Anyone else bullish about battery powered locomotives? Hook up a hydrogen fuel cell car for power behind the locomotive and create the cleanest free running long distance consist in the world!!!
"Is this company same as Westinghouse Air Break technologies, I got this Puppy due to GE."
Hows bout some dividend love...
"I'm new to this stock. I hold GE and after the spinoff decided that WAB got the better end of the deal, so I added to my spin-off shares of WAB.As far as I can tell, the Q1 numbers good like a beat. So what am I missing with the market reaction?"
Green light buy. Dividends. Low pe. Major parts market with little competition. All foods and industrial products come by train. That is never going away
"Wabtec(WAB) was excited to announce this that it had completed its merger with GE Transportation, immediately following GE Transportation’s spinoff from GE(GE). GE shareholders will see small amounts of Wabtec in their portfolios. The final ratio is a bit lower than what had been estimated. For each share of GE stock owned, shareholders received 0.005371 shares of Wabtec stock, approximately one share of Wabtec stock for every 186 shares of GE stock. Many small shareholders will receive cash in lieu of shares. Shareholders should be aware that this spinoff is taxable. People should ask their tax advisor what this means, but our understanding is that the full amount of the distribution is taxable, but it also reduces the basis on their GE shares by the value received. As mentioned previously, Wabtec has joined the S&P 500."
do GE shareholders get shares of WAB?
"Joy! I got 2 whole shares from the GE merger - easy street, here I come!!!"
OK Ok So what is the problem with this company? Am I missing something from the past? I only got into this from the Ge spin off and decided to watch and see what it does after. Future looks great for increased revenue so what is the problem?Bad taste from the past or management?
.12 cents dividend per share. What do you think the Max per share price can be this year?
"Earnings a couple weeks back took WAB to the high-$70's. GE then announced they were selling their shares for $72.50. The stock now trades at $67 or a 14-15% decline. Nothing has changed for WAB since earnings except this GE stock sale. Doesn't make a lot of sense, but that's the market sometimes. Just have to decide if this is the new reality or is this in fact an opportunity."
