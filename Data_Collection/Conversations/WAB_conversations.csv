Rafael Santana served as president and CEO of GE Transportation and is now president and CEO of Wabtec’s Freight segment. Is there a connection with GE's horrible numbers and this guy. Im starting to think so especially with what you have pointed out @Gator.
OK Ok So what is the problem with this company? Am I missing something from the past? I only got into this from the Ge spin off and decided to watch and see what it does after. Future looks great for increased revenue so what is the problem?Bad taste from the past or management?
go baby go

"Wabtec and GE Transportation to Merge, Creating Global Leader for Rail Equipment, Services and Software"
"We are reaching a 3 year low for WAB with a top range of 113 and nominal price from the high 70’s to low 80’s. This is prior to the GE acquisition. Pressure on the stock is due to a second round of negotiations with the union and some risk as GE may need proceeds from WAB stock to continue operations. On 6/3 a strike may occur if agreements with the Union are not made. The drop in stock price reflects this event and once the trade deal is set I would expect a 2-3% rise in share price. WAB last quarter was strong, but its too early to tell how long it will take WAB to gain efficiencies of the combined companies. GE transportation was a customer of WAB and there are saving to be expected and redundancies to shave cost. Long term and at these levels WAB is a good buy. Technology in Rail have lagged other areas of transportation such as autonomy but eventually this will have to change and WAB is the leader in train control with products like PTC."

WAB is up 5.21% to 57.60
The company wants you to sell you one share. That's why they gave it to you.....
Wonder if Wab has looked into relationship with CalAmp (camp) and their strengths in the transportation field hmm?
World reaction to Trump’s tariffs will hit US industries hard.
"Where is WAB applying the ""brakes"" on the stock, or railcars? Low $62-ish a share is the 5-year low for WAB. Why buy now? Railroads are cutting back."
"FROM ORIGINAL AGREEMENTUnder the agreement, which has been approved by the Boards of Directors of Wabtec and GE, GE will receive $2.9 billion in cash at closing and GE and its shareholders will receive a 50.1% ownership interest in the combined company, with Wabtec shareholders retaining 49.9% of the combined company. The transaction is expected to be tax free to the companies' respective shareholders."

WAB is up 4.91% to 78.27
Just sold my entire position............-1- share.............:o)

80$ stock all day......
"Must have been GE selling about 3 million shares of WAB. Started at $77 this morning, ended at $71."
Way too much for the job he's done.BRIEF-Wabtec Says CEO Rafael Santana's FY 2019 Total Compensation Was $7.5 Million - SEC FilingBY Reuters— 2:42 PM ET 04/03/2020
on the rise
sold and going to buy a big juicy steak for lunch
"Way oversold, rail freights has a bright future with all the oil pipe projects being canceled."
"Is this company same as Westinghouse Air Break technologies, I got this Puppy due to GE."
"Wow, 500 shares of GE and I too got 2 freakin shares of WAB. Is this even worth holding onto?"
"Look into future, industry leader, all forms of current rail transport must and will expand. Think big - existing rails logically have space above, below and adjacent to current tracks. Just bought 100 shares to learn and track progress."
"$60 waiting to buy, but not today. may be next week"
no bad news today. dropped is good to buy buy
I got 1.611 shares of WAB!!!! BOOM!!!
Westinghouse Air Brake reached a 52 Week low at 49.00
"BS... This decline is controlled by the more than 90% holdings by WAB itself. They're going after the small investors that paid into the stock. It's so obviously unnatural price movement, I'm surprised we don't start an SEC investigation... As soon as they get more control of the stock by killing the small investors, then the price will spike as usual... Sounds fraudulent to make it go to record lows..."
I like this stock for the long term but with a ton of it likely to hit the market in near term from GE and the GE stockholders see no reason to step up at this time.
buy buy
I see we have a tentative labor contract Maybe we will have some relief
WAB is down 7.05% to 57.18

low volume today!
WAB reached a 52 Week low at 47.05
Looks like WAB is somehow still linked w GE formally or informally AND GE will continue to sell WAB stock as needed to raise cash and avoid Bankruptcy. The GE insurance arm is a 10 yr black hole that simply can’t be fixed. I fell into that trap when I sold GE and bought WAB
Does WAB pay a dividend? Looks like it was dropped last year.
"I added today, I thought it was good opportunity to buy under $70.00. I hope it stays under that price for a while and that I can come up with more funds to keep adding."
Why WAB is going down
Welcome to the TOXIC GE family.
Any progress over the ‘strike’ at the locomotive plant in Pa ?

A good company but the chart is still negative for now.
just got wabtec shares through GE merger also ..doing some DD here
1 share was wondering how I got it! Thanks GE!
WAB is down 4.96% to 71.57
GE selling shares messed up a solid quarter for shareholders. That's my take on this swift decline.
Great earnings report. Good to see $76 per share. It will go higher.
Green light buy. Dividends. Low pe. Major parts market with little competition. All foods and industrial products come by train. That is never going away
$60 is the bottom?. I think so
This is the ONLY company I can find that's working on a battery powered locomotives (if anyone knows of others let me know)..... The time has come to merge the most efficient form of ground transportation on earth with most efficient form of energy on earth!! I've seen that many North American railways (I own shares in 2 of them) are promoting their goals in reduction of Co2!!!! There isn't a better or more visible way to do this than adding a few electrified/hybrid consists into their operations!!!
"I've 200 shares of WAB. Can't remember when bought.Also, have had GE for a long disappointingly time. Couldn't understand why advisor told me to HOLD."
"I have 229 shares of GE, shouldn't I received 10 shares of Wabtec?"
WAB is up 6.22% to 43.57
Train crash in Joisey may accelerate adoption of PTC which would be a plus for WAB.
So what is the problem here?
oversold retracing to 73.5...jmo

Anyone else bullish about battery powered locomotives? Hook up a hydrogen fuel cell car for power behind the locomotive and create the cleanest free running long distance consist in the world!!!
I see a merger between Siemens rail and WABTEC giving the world 3 railroad manufacturers. And if not that WAB should look at buying TRN.
I just got wabtec shares through Ge spinoff is this is good company should I keep shares or sell it
What’s the deal with the sell off today??
"keeping this one in the core holdings, dividend solid"
"Anonymous, are u saying u have 12,000 shares of GE? If so, nice."
WAB is down 5.09% to 56.92
dog days are over...buy now...
"Am just reading about WABTEC, learning about the GE TRANS sale/merger? I have been offered to sell my less than 100 shares for a $7/share processing fee! Sounds a bit much to me. Also doesn’t sound beneficial to any stockholders with under 100 shares. Can anyone enlighten me to why the company is doing this?"
"the stock is the best buy on the board, after the GE deal a double or more"
Large insider purchase yesterday 05/13/20. Someone has confidence in their company.
are we buying yet
WHAT IS THE REAL CONVERTION RATE OF THE SPIN OFFFOR EVERY GE STOCK YOU GET HOW MANY WAB?
WAB reached a new 52 Week High at 97.63
"Well I'm banking this goes up, up, and away once they come to an agreement. Fingers crossed."
is it better now to purchase GE or WAB? for about 6-12 months horizon
"$35 an hour is $70,000 a year, plus benefits, plus overtime results in real cost of over $120,000 per labor employee. That's way too high for a factory worker. $22 an hour is in line with the rest of the world. The union is way out of line on this one and their workforce is going to find itself out of work. I dont blame management for standing firm on this one. Another golden goose killed by unions."
A screaming buy. No way this is not 75. Greatat PE. Dividens. They have little competitive in the locomotive industry
WAB is down -4.91% to 77.27
Looks like a short squeeze this morning! Ouch.
I got spin-off of WAB why it is going down what I am missing any long time investor should I buy more Wabtec or Ge
Anybody know the cost basis that is recorded on the shares I received in the spinoff?
WAB is up 4.99% to 103.11
"Wabtec is a key player and leader in the rail industry worldwide. I understand the GE integration has created major challenges, but I also believe the GE products give Wabtec more competitive advantages than they had prior to the merger. Still researching the company, but I like the idea of buying industry leaders when they're dealing with short term challenges. That's where I see Wabtec today. Not buying yet, but definitely under consideration in the low $60's. Once the GE integration is wrapped, wouldn't mind seeing WAB bring GBX into the fold as well. There isn't any replacement for rail, so the long term looks great in my opinion."
Westinghouse Air Brake reached a 52 Week low at 52.19
"I got 6 ""free"" shares of WAB this morning! I'm RICH!"
I have 2000 GE shares. But I received only 10 wabtec shares? It’s 1 wabtec for 25 GE right. Thanks in advance.
Whoa. Quite a pop.
I swear it's almost impossible to get new info on anything I own. Nobody is even talking on here. Would be nice to know how things are going.
Is there any cash in lieu of fractional shares paid?
Collaboration with GM for batteries for the rail industry a plus for Stockholders....
Bearish cover story on RR's in Barron'sSo why is WAB UP?
Does this pig do anything except dive and pay a ridiculously low dividend?
WAB is down 5.27% to 69.20
Hello $90 !!! So glad I bought this one!
I just got my 214 also. It's part of a acquisition. 1 for every 25 shares of GE you had I believe.
buy buy buy
WAB seems to be catching fire! Anyone have any insight into what’s going on?
Earnings were great and the future looks great.
"I've got soooo much money now from WAB that I've got enough to splurge today on Happy Hour.......Sonic half off slushes Happy Hour. If I got 10 free shares, I could afford REAL happy hour."
"GE investors and GE just made $400,000,000 on the Wabtec merger. Of darn!"
WAB reached a 52 Week low at $67.91
"4th qtr miss was predictable due to merger transaction expenses, strong US dollar, and RR postponing implementation expense of positive train control. Hopefully mgt put all the bad news in this quarter so they can beat 2017 estimates. Stock will likely be dead money until WAB can report a beat on 2017 quarterly earnings reports."
"Are there any longtime WAB holders on this board? If so, please share your reasons for holding the stock, and your evaluation of management. TIA"
"i received 48 shares, will this be taxable?"
"I'm guessing the stock price is dropping due to everyone dumping their 1-25 shares. In my opinion, what GE did to minor share holder is a joke. Planning to hold my huge 9 share investment until the dumping is over. May save about $40!!!!!!!!"
This stock is money.....
Bought a train load this morning...way oversold
WAB reached a new 52 Week High at 95.27
is this worth keeping ?
Is it down because the new locomotive factory they just bought went on strike Tuesday?
Westinghouse Air Brake is up 5.00% to 82.05
"Earnings a couple weeks back took WAB to the high-$70's. GE then announced they were selling their shares for $72.50. The stock now trades at $67 or a 14-15% decline. Nothing has changed for WAB since earnings except this GE stock sale. Doesn't make a lot of sense, but that's the market sometimes. Just have to decide if this is the new reality or is this in fact an opportunity."
Think we hit bottom finally market down 200 and we are up 1%. We will see.
I was owner of record of GE stock on Feb 14. I still have yet to receive stock???

"WABTEC is shuttering the wholly owned subsidiary - Motive Power - stating they are moving the operation to Pennsylvania. With low costs of engine refurbishing that was provided in Boise Idaho (in comparison to the GE operation in Pennsylvania) - this is a questionable move at best. This company is scrambling after the GE merger (transportation component) and utilizing cannibalization techniques (first indication of trouble) in order to ""keep up appearances"" to investors. ""Danger Will Robinson""..."

"am looking to buy this in the mid 60's. The GE shareholders just got bits and pieces, as GE grabbed 2 billion dollars worth of stock for themselves. They are the big seller."
Management just did not seem prepared for conference call following earnings. I think it may be time to exit.
"Interesting...I sawsome WAB in my portfolio yrsterday, and this morning it disappeared...."
Stock is beginning to trade like Bitcoin. High short interest +/- 16%. Management what is going on here? Comments appreciated.

Strong growth ahead that can streamline operations. Smaller company can execute much faster with cheap GE subsidiary purchase
Too much upside. From here pe. Dividends and growth
"Okay, I'm pretty dumb here. Negative news on GE this morning drops GE stock price 13%. So why is WAB down? What is the present day correlation between GE's woes and WAB? I thought that GE had already sold off the WAB stock they received. Is there a connection between the two companies beyond that?"

"I agree 100% regarding top management's pay being very high. I only hope it's tied to performance. If it is then I'm fine with that.I do have a concern regarding strikes. When I left the service and had no job my brother talked me into his job with a roofing company. It was a union shop, paying dues.I never had to work getting dirty but I did. A job is a job while living with my spouse's parents. I had a union card for roofing and sheet metal. In my town the Ford plant, a container plant and GE was on strike. As i went to work daily the workers would be getting warm next to a 55 gallon container keeping warm for over 16 months without pay.The container company closed, then the Ford plant next and finally the GE plant. All due to workers demanding a pay raise during a recession. It was bad timing on their part. Then came our company demanding higher hourly wages. I was happy just to have a damn job to pay my bills. No, I decided along with my brother, to continue working during our strike. I don't regret for a minute crossing lines to keep the company, with it's obligations to complete projects, on time. My dad was a loyal union electrical member all his life. He could work side jobs due to his expertise while on strike.My bottom line is, you have to choose what is right for your families well being. You can stand with your signs and burn wood when it's cold in that 55 gallon metal container. But in the end the company closes shop or moves to another location.The roofing company I worked for, after 75 years of business, folded. End of story"
Tried selling it...smart..not allowing that!
Bought when the pandemic hit...loving finally make a right move in these crazy markets....sold Ge to buy Webtec

WAB is up 5.21% to $74.73
"Wabtec(WAB) was excited to announce this that it had completed its merger with GE Transportation, immediately following GE Transportation’s spinoff from GE(GE). GE shareholders will see small amounts of Wabtec in their portfolios. The final ratio is a bit lower than what had been estimated. For each share of GE stock owned, shareholders received 0.005371 shares of Wabtec stock, approximately one share of Wabtec stock for every 186 shares of GE stock. Many small shareholders will receive cash in lieu of shares. Shareholders should be aware that this spinoff is taxable. People should ask their tax advisor what this means, but our understanding is that the full amount of the distribution is taxable, but it also reduces the basis on their GE shares by the value received. As mentioned previously, Wabtec has joined the S&P 500."
still so cheap to buy buy
I'm trying to help a few family members--How can I determine the cost basis of the spin-off non-covered $WAB shares my relatives received from GE on February 25th? How do they find the share price of WAB when they took possession?
$3 more to drop
I have one share of WAB I was holding 200 Ge shares. I might sell it and order a pizza.

I took the free shares as a sign after losing with GE and added to my position. It's turning out to be my best performer. Wish I had more money to buy buy buy.lol
OUCH! Has this merger overweighted this company. Looks like it's taking on water and sinking fast. We're going to need some life rafts and boats soon. We're hearing a lot of negative feedback concerning the GE spinoff. How much will this new firm impact earnings? We can't find any good answers.

"One other thing regarding union leaders. They do not want lower paying jobs for former employees and new employees due to the lower income from these employees to the unions pockets. Stay on strike they may say, but in the long run it's union dues.As I said earlier, the job loses at the container company, Ford plant and the local GE plant never recovered and many hundreds of jobs were gone forever. No one saw the trees beyond the forest and these employees lost much, much more in the long term."

Sad 2 shares showed up on my brokerage account. Guess I own these shares forever.
