Better dividend over at LEG?
Tempur Sealy reached an all time high at 33.74
Nice report.
"#TPX Indicators MACD, Stochastic oscillator and RSI are turning up at stoxline. A break of 53.30 could move it up to 62.25."
Let's go !
Those who held for the last 6 months have to be happy. Hoping the selling after the split were profit takers. We bought a Cocoon online and it has worked out well so far. After the stock came up on a fundamental stock screen search I had to go for it.
TPX is down -4.97% to 46.11
Very nice company. Good and secure future for my investment.
"Yeah, none of this lawsuit stuff matters here. Look at Trump. Everyday lawsuits are part of major companies’ business. This stock is WAY underpriced and will keep climbing back in line to a 45 degree Line on the price chart. Don’t miss out on profits."

"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
Who thinks this goes back to 100?
Merrill price target to $68 from $61.
Merrill increases TPX price target to $61. Was $46. Cheers!
"Good news today! TPX posted a significant earnings beat. Share buy-back, dividend increase and a four for one stock split coming for this previously sleepy stock. Cheers!"

"I am interested in TPX, but (a) Mattress Firm filed suit in TX, (b) a purported class action suit was filed federally in Atlanta, with class certification not yet ruled on, (c) TPX focuses on high end customers and thus might be in danger more than other consumer goods companies if the main tax cuts get delayed a year, as the Senate now proposes, and (d) Mattress Firm claims in ads that a majority of those surveyed prefer the comfort of its self-branded lux mattres to a Tempur Pedic Luxe mattress."
I’m thinking about loading up some more either tomorrow or Monday 
Will this stock go back to 100? I hope so
I have owned TPX since the early 2000's---glad to experience how the company has grown into the #1 bedding retailer--now they have also moved this brand to Europe--the current management team has done an excellent job--will continue to see profits as we move to the future-Good Luck to allthat have invested with this company
"Three cheers for our President ""jeye""David Einhorn's Greenlight disclosed that his fund has gained 18% in the 1st half of 2019, which is at least on par w/ $SPY's 18.2% YTD return. $TPX $AER $ATUS $VOYA $GM recovered nicely and helped performance. We estimated its stock only portfolio gained 16% YTD."
How do you guys think earnings is gonna look tomorrow?
"An amazing amazing company all round. Hats off too to management, even buying back their shares to put the icing on the cake. Who says you need to re-invent the wheel? (Looking at you PRPL)."
TPX is down -4.96% to 59.72
Why would they buy and operate a bankrupt retail chain – Innovative Mattress Solutions - when they are now are back in business with Mattress Firm which was one of the reasons for the IMS Chapter 11? To further add insult to injury now they sell to a chain like Big Lots. Makes no sense in Lex.
"Let’s get back to $100 , I say in a year it will be back at that level. 4k shares owned long term 1 year plus."
This is my best performer over the last few months.
Is it a stock split that the price went down ??

"Great ER ! Go long, go strong"
I know someone who works for Mattress Firm and they have told their employees not to discard the protective head and foot mattress protectors with Tempur and Sterms labeling as they might be able to repurpose them. Don't know if it means anything but why would they want to keep them if they weren't maybe negotiating a truce? Just speculating.....
4k shares bought let’s do this
"The purported class action in (b) below included causes of action for breach of privacy, failure to timely notify consumers of breach, breach of contract, etc. Separate from the Mattress Firm suit, of course, as the Atlanta one seeks relief for individual consumers from purported conduct by Tempur."
TPX had a great earnings report and the future looks great as well! I'm buying a lot here in the 31's!
Sleep love
Everybody wana make money in the stock market but don’t want to go big
