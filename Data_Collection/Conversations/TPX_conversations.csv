The real problem is for sure not enough buyers paying attention to this stock. Manipulation is clear.This company has very strong fundamentals. Things will get better.
There are rumors circulating around the trading floor that TPX and Mattress Firm are close to a deal. That's why the volume spike. I wouldn't doubt if it's true. They need each other.

"The sales are over at MF--they are screwed as traffic will drop. Sealy is the number one mattress in the U.S.and orders are pouring from Costco, Department stores and independent retailers. They are filling the void left by MF. In the face of massive sales at MF, TPX orders are up dramatically. TPX sales will rusume pre MF sales levels and with much higher margins. They should not return to MF."

I know someone who works for Mattress Firm and they have told their employees not to discard the protective head and foot mattress protectors with Tempur and Sterms labeling as they might be able to repurpose them. Don't know if it means anything but why would they want to keep them if they weren't maybe negotiating a truce? Just speculating.....

Idiots at UBS put a sell rating on TPX after it's down 25 points and they adopt a shareholder plan. You think that thief analyst at UBS is trying to get a lower price so he can buy? What a bunch of thieves on Wall St. Guy should be fired and then castrated for such a stupid downgrade.
"It's getting hammered today, down 2.5% as I type this on relatively low volume. Almost 25% short interest so with some kind of good news, we could see a good pop. Someone posted that TPX gave positive guidance regarding their upcoming earnings release? Anyone know?"

"Okay. Furniture sales are up in the last week. They will continue to be up as people are waiting for money to rebuild, etc. They all need mattresses.Not to mention sales were good before the storms."
"The purported class action in (b) below included causes of action for breach of privacy, failure to timely notify consumers of breach, breach of contract, etc. Separate from the Mattress Firm suit, of course, as the Atlanta one seeks relief for individual consumers from purported conduct by Tempur."
This company has unethical business practices and terrible mattresses that are overpriced. I would love to see them go out of business.
"being in the industry from what I see, SEALY, Stearns, and Tempur are all doing well. Business is strong and should be going up in the next QTR."
It is a buy. MF cannot afford to be without TPX products including Sealy. They just got bought by private equity and cannot afford a cash flow drop becuse of their massive debt. TPX can go to the other dozen mattress retailers and hurt MF.
We may see 90 in a few days!

When the easy money is all gone and everyone has to pay back their high interest debt— who will be spending $1200-2500 for a mattress? Those cheap IKEA mattresses won’t look so bad.

"Roomstogo sells a ton of their product. For the last 3-4 years, Mattressfirm has been popping up all around Roomstogo & other furniture companies hoping to steal some sales from them. Roomstogo will make up for those lost sales. Tempurpedic, Sealy and Beautyrest(under the Tempursealy group) are sold at RTG.The stock will recover.... Just heard from a BeautyRest and Sealy rep and new lines are coming out in the next couple of months"

Just called a Mattress Firm in my state. The guy who answered the phone said that the current plan was to carry Tempur & Sealy brands until April. He said he wish that the companies could work things out as he loves their beds and they are 2 of his best sellers. Stock at a 52 week low and believe pressure will build to come back to the table to negotiate terms that work...
"TPX just shorted by famous short seller. The reason was cash shortages will prevent stock buy backs. Here's a link. This is actually a link to the story. But I'll also paste below because I know I don't like to click on links. The discussion is at the bottom of the story. Good luck everyone. http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/A-veteran-short-seller-gives-us-2-names-on-his-radar-1001485474Marc Cohodes is well known among those brave enough to consider shorting the market. After making a name for himself as a General Partner at hedge fund Rocker Partners around the dotcom boom and bust, he's dedicated himself to running his own money.: ""Some people like to spend their money on publicists. I spend my money on lawyers.""Grant's Interest Rate Observer conferenceThat doesn't stop him from getting into scrapes, though. As he told the crowd at this year'sSo we asked him some questions.You've seen a bunch of them - what makes a good short?Linette Lopez: Marc Cohodes:I always say ""Bet the jockey not the horse."" So I look for inept and/or dishonest, management that has a track record of running companies into the ground. Telling a lie or two along the way also helps. I also look for balance sheet stress, and financial engineering to make the business’ look stronger than it truly is. Low quality activists involved in the name, along with a ""strategic review"" in process is also a plus in my book.Can you us a little bit about the investment landscape as you see it now? Are you having a hard time finding shorts in Lopez:this market? Have you ever seen an environment like this before? Cohodes:I think the investment landscape is a ""landmine."" Low rates have kept a lot of marginal companies around and that’s not a good thing for investors. It's easy to find shorts, but harder to find ones that will not blow your arm off before they blow up. Its an art as to timing and in this speculative time, you have to be very diligent and focused.I have seen a lot over the years. Investors seem drunk on very cheap money, and are in the market because ""where else can you put your money?"" My answer is THE BANK… Unusual times to be sure. Somewhat 1987-like with a mix of 2000 sprinkled on top. Kevin O' Leary as a stock market commentator should make people very very nervous.2016 is almost over, is there anything you regret doing (or not doing) as an investor?Lopez:Cohodes: I regret not buying any stocks this year, but I never own stocks, and looking back oil was a bit overdone in January-February. It's been a lot of fun for me this year. I never have regrets, just have learned not to underestimate people’s stupidity or greed.You've been around the market for quite a while. Are there any classic mistakes you're seeing these days that seem to be making a comeback?Lopez:Cohodes: Thesis drift seems alive and well and that’s a mistake that people are making. Folks are buying bad companies because they think the outfit will get bought out. You can only go to the well so often for that. Way too many ""activists"" who have confused a Bull Market for brains and that’s not really that surprising with the market at all-time highs, but something to be wary of.Do you have any post-election plays in the works? Or will you be watching anything specific at the start of 2017?Lopez: Cohodes:I view the election as a non-event. Hillary will win and it will be more of the same. I am sure Christmas will be ""disappointing"" for the eighth year in a row and either cold weather or Christmas falling in December will be to blame. I do think rates will have to and should go up and people will probably throw a fit. I think next year my focus will continue to be on those financial engineers who will no longer have the money for their silly buybacks. Tempur Pedic and Signet come to mind. I think Vancouver and Toronto mortgages go into the soup next year and this bears careful watching."
