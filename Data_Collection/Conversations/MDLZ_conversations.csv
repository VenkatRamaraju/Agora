No clue if this is true but some things floating around with Mondelez disclosing to creditors a purchase up to $2.5B USD $MDLZ.... growth segment... $ACB.
buy more oreos
Mondelez employees have been on strike since August 16th. Still no lines are running in any of there facilities stateside. I miss the smell of vanilla in the air. At some point it is going to be hard for Mondelez to catch up on their orders and you have a pandemic that is getting worse. If they shut down the Mexican border for exports it would be a wrap for Mondelez. The plants in Mexico the food doesn't have to be and is not inspected before released to the public. The water used has to be delivered because the water in their new facilities is contaminated. Just saying.
"Anyone here follow Christine Poole, a regular guest on Market Call? She is a fan of this stock and has been for some time. I only wish I bought it on her recommendation earlier lol. I still haven't bit the bullet and opened a position."
How confident do u feel a Aurora and Mondelez partnership will happen.
"Total sleeper large cap stock. Lots of debt but plenty of cash on hand, revenue and strong fundamentals to keep that in check. All the institutions are marking this as overweight.. even Ray Dalio is buying. Definitely looks ready to bust into the $60 range soon."
How long do you think this company can go without any product being made.
Mondelez is on Strike. Nothing is being produced and no ingredients are being delivered. Store shelves are empty. Don't know how long they may be on strike. Mondelez does not want to negotiate a fair contract with employees.
"My Ritz Cracker box says made in Mexico. My Honey Maid grahams box says made in Mexico. My Oreo box says made in Mexico. My Triscuits box is unspecified, though it indicates ""our white winter wheat starts its journey in the thumb of Michigan."" Is that believable? Doesn't say how many countries it went through on its way into the box and on to California. You want a company that invests in its employees? Buy Costco, though shares are a little pricey. Took me awhile to realize the wisdom. But extremely few items on the shelves are products of USA."
"Let us not forget about the bakeries that were recently shut down in the US because, in words of a Mondelez spokesperson, they were old and worn down. Yet! Years before! They pumped millions upon millions into creating the worlds biggest bakery in Salinas Mexico. Bet you shareholders loved that!"
Decent earnings during this pandemic. 11% increase in dividend. Management team continues to excel.
keep voting Demorat
watch those shelf prices go sky hi. There is no free lunch. In the end the consumer pays.and pays and pays.
Another down day
"Covid is NOT going to go away suddently so demand for MDLZ products will be strong for awhile. It is wishful thinking that we are going back to ""normal"" for quite some time. Also, some food manufacturers did not see a huge sale spike until later in the Q1. April has apparently been very strong for the food industry so this will be a better indication of how much MDLZ is benefiting from Covid."
Anyone buying at these levels?

How many billions has company used buying back its shares in the 10 years? Anyone?! But for what ever reason 2000 US employees are a burden on this company and itâ€™s shareholders. Lol
I'm worried about the strike
This stock is going down. Why? Is it because of the strike.?
"What's going on? The strike has been settled, product is shipping and the stock continues to sink? Something is wrong with this picture!"
This is becoming so sad. The workers are on strike and now the people they do have in the building do not know how to run the lines. This is not looking good.
"They shut down the largest Oreo manufacturer which was in NJ with insane profits. Shows to you how quick a great producing bakery can be shut down.. Paying 300 pesos a day for an employee in Mexico to do the same work. Unfortunately, Mexico DOESNT have labor laws in place and the quality control sucks big time. Quantity over quality is the objective, but the products quality will continue to decline. I have noticed the products such as Oreos and crackers do not taste the same anymore. More like cardboard and sweet clay."
The strike is still going strong. None of the plants stateside are fully operational. The shelves are extremely bare. These employees are adamant about fighting against Corporate greed. They are tired of being used and told they are irrelevant. Corporate is trying to save face because they know the strikers have them in a bad position right now. They need to give these workers what they want and stop stealing from them so they can appease themselves and others. Face it the real heroes are the workers or the employees. No contract No snacks.
I heard there is a boycott on Nabisco snakes. Looks bad
Just remember you guys that are complaining about those greedy workers on strike. They DID work through Covid so that you shareholders can make yo money! Right?
Pepsi Buyout of MDLZ ....you heard it first here !!!!
how is this up since strike news?
"If the Mondez employees were to accept the contract that Mondelez has outlined for them they would end up losing $40,000.00 a year. This includes their weekend overtime. The CEO takes as much as 24 million a year. They are treating their employees like they work for keebler. They treat their employees like they are the enemy. A happy employee is a productive employee. I can't see these employees taking that much of a pay cut and Mondelies is not fully operational."
MDLZ down on close
Buying at $55
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bixP5Q9Igy4 .... ............."" MDLZ + ALPP + AABB = Top 2021 Gainers..??"
New 52 week high. Last CC was bullish. New CEO is doing a great job. Making changes and focusing on snacks. It is one of my core holdings.
"Mondelez gave each supervisor a $10,000.00 bonus and gave the employees a $300.00 bonus for working during the pandemic. That did not sit well with the employees. Now Mondelez is fighting to keep their shelf space. Please don't bite the hands that feed you."
Started a position at 60. Been looking at it for some time and it finally went on sale. Buy low but not all at once.
Enjoy that increase in your dividend while the workers lose their pension!
Downturn soon in MDLZ
