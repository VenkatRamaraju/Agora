"a short squeeze is inevitable, now, if I were a short I'd cover now before it's too late"
I'm in!
Follow the volume is key
if Kaixin auto was 13 dollar this should be 25
12/15 big deal is coming! Else hedge as the shorts. Build up your portfolio little by little. Be patient for a bounce!
What does this company do again?
These stocks are good just for day traders. Buy and sell fast
they made 414 m of US dollar revenue in 2019 and profit of 38 M. Oversold too much because of covid 19 started in China this year. Well I am speculating the company should continue to generate decent revenue from its lending business due to quick recovery of COVID 19. This should be a $6 stock.
whohoho anybody there?
$JT is next
And halted
One last run?
"No stock is trading like WEI in today’s trading, just think what might possibly happen soon!!!!!!!!!!! Any ONE holding WEI can become a reacher Investor/Trader. Glta"
Get in now.. wild ride ahead!!!
IT was fun! Now we go buy NIO STOCK again
Company from China? lol get out now if you have profits

"This stock is way oversold, so undervalued."
To the moon 
Halted
"Not yet, normally when KXIN run is over, it gives way to WEI run to commence. People pumping KXIN and RENN are the same pumping WEI, thus prepare for a two day run of WEI starting from today."
finally! lets go!

Also on a spike go in small 100 shares follow the trend when pulled back add 100 more etc..sell profit blocks at a time on the up
MICAH HAVING A TOUGH DAY 
2$ Breaking out
How can you possibly go from +55% AH to -20% PM?
I know it was halted last night at after hours but why is it showing nothing now? Can anyone explain?
Last support $1.36 after that all the to under $1
Wow
On a spike that is not too far off under $3 is an entry if it's spiked up over $5 wait for the pull back..you will notice the drop then resistance that shows you an up trend is near..don't panic sell you will lose your position and beat yourself up for selling early
Loading zone.
anyone here?
rule of thumb: a stock that goes up 3x in one day is a sell at the end of the dayit's not complicated
As per simply wall st the fair value is $15.77 wow
Could go much much Higher
Its 35% up AH
well I sold too soon lol  good luck all with skin in the game!  I love stocks like this! go make money friends!
"50 days moving average is $1.56, 20 days moving average is $1.62,,,,, lets see close above any of them"
did I see double bottom at 1.48? Not sure why this is up in the premarket.
any experts here pl advice if WEI is a hold for overnight?
SOOOO happy I shorted at 4.70
"seeing a color other than red, wow, but the day is young will see if it holds"
in at 1.5....out 5.31...I'm happy with my profit 
$WEI Drop a PR like $SNMP let’s get $10 this week 
I love you day traders today. Your pumps profited me about $2000 in a couple hours.
Is it worth buying now?
Back to $10
sorry typo 2.50

In @1.49
If this dips to 2.18 I will be loading up
This will climb up again like yesterday... load up...
Wait for the rocket I think it’s the time
Not alot of shares being traded here with this percentage increase. I will look to get in in the am premarket with a better idea of where were heading and the volume.
I was almost right it will buffer around $4-$5
Let's see if we see two green days for the first time in about 2 months.... $doyu $yy $huya $iq $momo $qtt $wei $qd $lx $jfu
great all the whimps about to exit collecting pennies volume speaks for itself back up we go
$ITP is the stock of the day... $WEI will go up by late Thursday and Friday...
Wow. What a score that was. Shorted at $9.25 before the halt yesterday after hours. I was hoping it would go back into the 2's after it started trading again. Still haven't closed my short position. Not being greedy but won't it go back below $2 soon?
Don't sell at two bucks but sell it at a buck....
It needs only a 50% drop to make you sad!
Here comes 5
Going to fly tomorrow
WEI HALTED AGAIN!!!
Made a move from .75 to $10 the other day. Can it do it again? I believe it can 
Lol. After hour Halt ! Anything can happen in 2020
Halted?
WEI is up 13.44% to 1.34
What’s the catalyst?
welcome to the most boring stock in the world
why so little interest on such a low PE stock with positive earnings?
Yesterday I bought this at 10:45 AM @1.45 N sold at 11:34 @4.20 5000 shares...do u math....
"The nos are wrong. How can a company with mc less than 100 mil,but produces revenue of a billion+ with a gross profit margin of 660mil+?"
This stepchild is going for a run soon
Why is it going down so much ..where is the 6$ plus everyone was saying
100k order just went in something about to happen !!?????? HUGE
This has potential to reach back to $13...
"Yesterday WEI projected growth for 2021. This should soon be going back up in the green again: Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company revises earnings guidance for the full year 2021. For the period, the company expects full-year 2021 net sales to range between $2.75 billion and $2.85 billion, updated from the previous range of $2.70 billion and $2.80 billion."
"86 million shares traded today, can’t wait to see what tomorrow brings!"
This thing may cross 20 in after hours....I truly can't believe my eyes.
5.30 I was close hope you all sold and didn't hold over night this is going down hard
Listen to the news China stocks are in ...one at a time hold for 2 day runs don't panic sell...follow the volume follow the trend...tomorrow xyf...aihs...uxin. Timing is everything..follow me as I follow the charts unless you follow your own charts..

Very niceClosing above 3.5 $
This is probably the strangest stock i have ever watched.
been holding 640 shares at 1.82.I have a feeling tomorrow will be an amazing day
A lot of buying. Needed to pull back but watch for the second run on this one today. Could push above 6.
Was there any indication this was going to skyrocket today? Or do only the inside traders get to profit?
we can do it $jt!!! $wei
once we break 2.50 we are clear
GOING DOWN!!!!!

Stock go vroom
What gonna happen on monday 
how should those investors who are still holding wei @ 8 or 9 $ play this once trade resume??
Well I have only lost 500 of the 2500 I made yesterday. Still holding a small position. Hoping for that dead cat bounce.
I guess the party is over. $WEI to go
Weidai is up 12.59% to 1.52
is it too late to get in at 8am tomorrow?
This week the week we spike hope so!!
"Anything can happen, upside potential weighs more than going downhill!!"
Do your own due diligence.http://weidai.investorroom.com/
If you did not hold like I told you to please do not chase in the morning wait for the dip after 10am is your entry point
$WEI $2.25 That’s your bottom!!! $WEI $BIMI $NAKD Current portfolio.
This is really gambling...

When is ER?
This will PLUMMET once trading resumes. We all know it 
Can someone explain to me what just happened with this stock today? Literally finding zero news!!
Well i was able to short at $9.34. These opportunities seem to present themselves every week or two. I would not be surprised at all if this is back to $2 by the end of the week. Unless some news comes out and then I am screwed.
P&D
UXIN>>>WEI
"was 11 dollars last year, should go back up"
Well it's a little after 6am in Bejing. I wonder what time this news will be out and what the news is.
"ASTC is having a run/short squeeze, they have real news from yesterday’s after hours, smaller float and this might jump to new highs."
Load up this is going to 6 !!!
"Just saw news today that China gov is going to push spending including cars so NIO, XPEV and LI will benefit from. Tomorrow big UP!!!""National Standing Committee: Deploy to boost bulk consumption, key consumption and promote the release of rural consumption potential. According to news from the government network, the meeting pointed out that first, we must expand automobile consumption. Second, we must promote the consumption of home appliances, furniture and decoration. Encourage local governments to subsidize the elimination of old home appliances and furniture and purchase of green smart home appliances and environmentally friendly furniture. Third, we must boost catering consumption. Fourth, we must use the expansion of county and township consumption as a starting point to drive rural consumption.""Less. tekst from forum Nio was this. Weidai will profit too of this"

Isn't it just undervauled ?
Could it be a halt for a run up?
$4.75 close today
look like it will this follow the SPI? $40.00
43 million shares traded already today. I can’t imagine there being this much volume and this thing not hitting $5+ a share
I missed this ... no point in buying now unfortunately
Dead stock no hope back to $0.0000000
How exactly do you find these stocks before they blow ? What's the secret ? Seriously I don't understand how so many people just know about a random cheap stock within 24 hours of it blowing up over 300%I'd like to get rich too lol Wwr was my lucky shot
pubc next
Whos sold WEI @3 and bought UXIN today??? You are very welcome!
All is well ends well No worries No hurries Island Time Patience
"3:00 ==== BUY,BUY,BUY!!!!"
Should i Sell or its gonna open higher
It's a Gamble
It’s was a great party. Got in @6.50 cash out @ 8.00. Million thanks to Chinese pumpers. 
Remember when I said sell now cuz it’ll be $2 in the morning??? 
If you look at the 3 year chart this thing used to be $13 a share. Not saying that’s going to happen but there is the potential for a big run
There is a news i dont know what does it mean
Very stressfull
Tanteh starting as well $TANH
Can we run to 8 again?
"Peeping MRIN's 5 day chart for the past few days in comparison to Wei's, MRIN is slightly ahead of WEI and was down 32 percent as well but later bounced back and is up 52 % today. Be patient y'all, shorts will be dissenting back into the deep dark abyss of their mama's basement very soon"
What is the next resistance ?
We will see another big jump by 1pm till EOD...
Wow!
Run to the hills!
"Got awfully silent here, either because I muted so many $5/h stock bashers or they have bailed themselves. $doyu $huya $baba $iq $qtt $pdd $momo $uxin $kxin $lx $yy $bili $jd $jt $wei $jfu $aihs $qd $bidu"
Could see 10 dollars here today GLTA don't sell
buy 1000 USD and wait and see
I was in at .80 and bailed at 2.10... some regret there but meh. I think it’s the same pump that hid dogz and ipc yesterday . There was no news to justify the jump which screams manipulation
eated well? oke let's go again
oh my god surely this can't continue
BUY BUY BUY !!!!
here comes 2.20$
wait until HGSH is done...patience is key
"Don't forget about yesterdays eod dip, that recovered above the day's high."
Not a pump and dump scene here today this beast is going to stabilize tomorrow for a continued run and settle end of day around $5-$6...
"Accumulating today, will start running later this week. Bought big today"
20 day moving average support at $1.62 wish it hold
5 day RMI is looking good! Hopefully once we hit $2 this thing takes off again
"things are picking up alright, these next few days will be big."
With any stock people find your way out always have a plan. Today make a plan execute and walk away to live another day in trading Good luck
Shorts are betting all adr will eventually be delisted. This plus china and usa behaviour have made the VIE's practically unprotected and uninvestible. I would urge the SEC to prohibit any short selling of chinese ADR until US and CHINA have come up with a solution in order to protect investors. $baba $jd $kweb $pdd $bili $huya $doyu $momo $qtt $qd $lx $cciv $iq $yy $nio $qfin $wei $aihs $uxin $jt
HEADED NEAR $3 STRONG VOLUME
I have seen the 1 dollar range so often last months. Time to get back for 1.30 at least
now hold it till 10$ lol
think it will hit or clear the 52 week high of 6.5 today or tomorrow?
Finally. Seems like its been years since this thing moved. Maybe it will do an XYF 2.25 to 17.88 Fingers crossed. Congrats longs.
..THERE ARE NO TRADING HALTS IN AFTER HOURS. This could go to 20!!!!!!!!!! Wish I owned shares... But am so happy that I am not holding any short positions.
PLIN is next. I missed this one I won’t miss that
why is the stock still up 400% off recent lows if CEO has no clue why?
"Not good chart, break the 20 days moving average, unless go over $1.62 we are going to $1.31"
is it a buy now ?
buy now great company!!!
"no news and up 23% whats going on, is there any news coming out?"
So this was .88 in the morning and now is more than $8?
it is the day to go upppp
"May go high like KXIN, LYL - 1-2wk play"
Just broke $2 resistance
Bought this at 10:45 AM @1.45 N sold at 11:34 @4.20 5000 shares...do u math....
General Meeting was held today. Any news?
PLIN the next mover !!
"IT IS NOT halted in the sense you think.The dealer... simply closed table..See. Stocks like this in AH.. have allotments so to speak..Once filled.. they can without reason.Push ask and bid to nadq.See once stock is off the hours ..AH and pre trade..They the dealer... (and believe it that is what they call them) can play or go home... Think"" jc somgan"" .as dealer..In ah and pre trade..This is how it has been and will be doneWith stocks held by investors institutions rather than entirely on the street itself..This is why Chinese co.s. unadudited ..Use jc sorgan and others like them to go public...There. Happy learning"
$GHSI $NAKD $NOK $CTRM $WEI
"People just want too much, it was 0.80$ few days ago and now they are angry When it touch 4$ in premarket"
$MKD ($1.56) IPO less than a year ago at $6.. 52 week high $12 I expect at least that.. last earnings were great. This is THE NEXT CHINA NAME. $KXIN $WEI
All this without news ?
Will there be an EOD Power Hour?
Will it be ok?
Who is next??
I feel so sorry for anyone holding a short position here.
$WEI bottom on the hourly increasing volume and massive PreMarket bid support like we had before the run that started yesterday at 9:30 $NAKD $SNMP
QD is a Chinese Fintech similar to WEI... Hopefully QD is ready for a move tomorrow. QD is up a bit today.
New breakout is begining. Time to start buying
What a nice close
Hey Tony did you say 5 ?
Some lucky insiders will be feasting on bat soup tonight.
Anyone not taking profits today is off their rocker!!!!! AMAZING
Warning for next rally
never hold a clear pump over night Rule 1
AMC is on the move up. Time to get me some
Next leg up?
how high can it go ?......$3.50.....
PUBC IS picking up in volume
"Weidai has the best P/E ever seen 1,24, This has so much potential, better than any other stock. Go Weidai up to $35 or more"
NO HURRIES NO WORRIES I will let it ride overnight and add in the morning swing
Any day the sleeping dragon will wake again !! Load up !
On our way to 3.00 GLTA
"4$ opening tomorrow, just watch"
Don't be surprised to you see the chinese internet companies become the next pump. Investors will reposition for the coming 6 months and have few other places to go. Today's sell off is a bullish signal for $kweb $baba $jd $iq $doyu $huya $momo $qtt $yy $qd $lx $pdd $tuya $didi $nio $wei $aihs $jfu $jt $uxin $cciv
Get in now if you haven’t already!
Weldal has a $1.55 loss per share and may be going under. WEI !!!!!!!!!
This is going to go go go and then just tank at 12
Shorting at these levels would be financial suicide. Any positive news will boost $kweb and chinese inet shares by at least 15%. Also seeing a bottom forming. Today's action is pretty bullish for the sector. $baba $iq $doyu $momo $huya $yy $pdd $bili $jd $jfu $wei $lx $qd $bili $qtt $mkd
Can it go any lower
In @ $1.87 YESTERDAY cause anyone that can read a chart could tell you this was coming today... shorts are panicking!!!
I was going to cover at $2.00 from $4.07...but $1.80 sound better!
$WEI WEIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!! Hope nobody sold to the bears!!! $10+ by Friday??? Let’s make it even sooner!!!
