5 day RMI is looking good! Hopefully once we hit $2 this thing takes off again
GOING DOWN!!!!!
"wei will crashbelow 35 to 50 cent soon ,be very careful in investing in chinese fintech companies and finacial instition . ALL CHINESE TUTOR COMPANIESALL CRASHING OVER 55 TO 60 PERCENT TODAY by CHINESE GOVERNMENT afterthem because they chargingtoo much money for tutoring ,next chinese government will go after chinese big bank, fintech .and finacial instition .because finiaial instition over charging chinese for service charges"
What is the next resistance ?
$WEI Drop a PR like $SNMP let’s get $10 this week 
Weidai is up 14.53% to 1.10
Will be same as Futu or not?
$WEI Turning up  $NAKD $SNMP
Hold or sell ?
"No stock is trading like WEI in today’s trading, just think what might possibly happen soon!!!!!!!!!!! Any ONE holding WEI can become a reacher Investor/Trader. Glta"
"Hold until after wall street lunch, see if it take a run but make sure you don’t hold overnight!!!"
they made 414 m of US dollar revenue in 2019 and profit of 38 M. Oversold too much because of covid 19 started in China this year. Well I am speculating the company should continue to generate decent revenue from its lending business due to quick recovery of COVID 19. This should be a $6 stock.
"Accumulating today, will start running later this week. Bought big today"
Weidai is up 14.10% to 0.89
big news coming up...buy as much as u can guys
This is really gambling...
$WEI $2.25 That’s your bottom!!! $WEI $BIMI $NAKD Current portfolio.
is it a buy now ?
Only a matter of time until this rebounds!
"3:00 ==== BUY,BUY,BUY!!!!"
Any news as to why this is tanking to near 52 week low?
I was going to cover at $2.00 from $4.07...but $1.80 sound better!
GOING AGAIN
I love you day traders today. Your pumps profited me about $2000 in a couple hours.
Let's see if we see two green days for the first time in about 2 months.... $doyu $yy $huya $iq $momo $qtt $wei $qd $lx $jfu
look like it will this follow the SPI? $40.00
HEADED NEAR $3 STRONG VOLUME
In @ $1.87 YESTERDAY cause anyone that can read a chart could tell you this was coming today... shorts are panicking!!!
if Kaixin auto was 13 dollar this should be 25
"86 million shares traded today, can’t wait to see what tomorrow brings!"
"Not yet, normally when KXIN run is over, it gives way to WEI run to commence. People pumping KXIN and RENN are the same pumping WEI, thus prepare for a two day run of WEI starting from today."
As per simply wall st the fair value is $15.77 wow
What’s the catalyst?
"Got awfully silent here, either because I muted so many $5/h stock bashers or they have bailed themselves. $doyu $huya $baba $iq $qtt $pdd $momo $uxin $kxin $lx $yy $bili $jd $jt $wei $jfu $aihs $qd $bidu"
Not a pump and dump scene here today this beast is going to stabilize tomorrow for a continued run and settle end of day around $5-$6...
To the moon 
Whos sold WEI @3 and bought UXIN today??? You are very welcome!
Wei .92
"Just saw news today that China gov is going to push spending including cars so NIO, XPEV and LI will benefit from. Tomorrow big UP!!!""National Standing Committee: Deploy to boost bulk consumption, key consumption and promote the release of rural consumption potential. According to news from the government network, the meeting pointed out that first, we must expand automobile consumption. Second, we must promote the consumption of home appliances, furniture and decoration. Encourage local governments to subsidize the elimination of old home appliances and furniture and purchase of green smart home appliances and environmentally friendly furniture. Third, we must boost catering consumption. Fourth, we must use the expansion of county and township consumption as a starting point to drive rural consumption.""Less. tekst from forum Nio was this. Weidai will profit too of this"
Just broke $2 resistance
General Meeting was held today. Any news?

Do your own due diligence.http://weidai.investorroom.com/
"P/E. 1,18 this stock has potential to 35"
Tanteh starting as well $TANH
All this without news ?
Wow
any experts here pl advice if WEI is a hold for overnight?
Once we hit $2 a share I think this will take off...
Yesterday I bought this at 10:45 AM @1.45 N sold at 11:34 @4.20 5000 shares...do u math....
People better move to weidai #WEI. This one is about to run soon.
will close above 3 today. Consolidating before the run
BUY BUY BUY !!!!
How exactly do you find these stocks before they blow ? What's the secret ? Seriously I don't understand how so many people just know about a random cheap stock within 24 hours of it blowing up over 300%I'd like to get rich too lol Wwr was my lucky shot
Get in now if you haven’t already!
$JT is next
A lot of buying. Needed to pull back but watch for the second run on this one today. Could push above 6.
"Spike the $3 mark, spike it!!!"
When will trading resume ?
Its 35% up AH
rule of thumb: a stock that goes up 3x in one day is a sell at the end of the dayit's not complicated
finally! lets go!
Can we run to 8 again?
Don't be surprised to you see the chinese internet companies become the next pump. Investors will reposition for the coming 6 months and have few other places to go. Today's sell off is a bullish signal for $kweb $baba $jd $iq $doyu $huya $momo $qtt $yy $qd $lx $pdd $tuya $didi $nio $wei $aihs $jfu $jt $uxin $cciv
This is going to go go go and then just tank at 12
What does this company do again?
Why is it going down so much ..where is the 6$ plus everyone was saying
Made a move from .75 to $10 the other day. Can it do it again? I believe it can 
buy now more!!!
I know it was halted last night at after hours but why is it showing nothing now? Can anyone explain?
why so little interest on such a low PE stock with positive earnings?
Am glad I sold before close 
Power hour is coming
Listen to the news China stocks are in ...one at a time hold for 2 day runs don't panic sell...follow the volume follow the trend...tomorrow xyf...aihs...uxin. Timing is everything..follow me as I follow the charts unless you follow your own charts..
Shorting at these levels would be financial suicide. Any positive news will boost $kweb and chinese inet shares by at least 15%. Also seeing a bottom forming. Today's action is pretty bullish for the sector. $baba $iq $doyu $momo $huya $yy $pdd $bili $jd $jfu $wei $lx $qd $bili $qtt $mkd
Remember when I said sell now cuz it’ll be $2 in the morning??? 
$4.75 close today
Very niceClosing above 3.5 $
These stocks are good just for day traders. Buy and sell fast
Going to fly tomorrow
Are they still alive?
I feel so sorry for anyone holding a short position here.
whohoho anybody there?
it is the day to go upppp
SOOOO happy I shorted at 4.70
$WEI bottom on the hourly increasing volume and massive PreMarket bid support like we had before the run that started yesterday at 9:30 $NAKD $SNMP
43 million shares traded already today. I can’t imagine there being this much volume and this thing not hitting $5+ a share
"no news and up 23% whats going on, is there any news coming out?"
"4$ opening tomorrow, just watch"
been holding 640 shares at 1.82.I have a feeling tomorrow will be an amazing day
If you look at the 3 year chart this thing used to be $13 a share. Not saying that’s going to happen but there is the potential for a big run
$MKD ($1.56) IPO less than a year ago at $6.. 52 week high $12 I expect at least that.. last earnings were great. This is THE NEXT CHINA NAME. $KXIN $WEI
Shorts are betting all adr will eventually be delisted. This plus china and usa behaviour have made the VIE's practically unprotected and uninvestible. I would urge the SEC to prohibit any short selling of chinese ADR until US and CHINA have come up with a solution in order to protect investors. $baba $jd $kweb $pdd $bili $huya $doyu $momo $qtt $qd $lx $cciv $iq $yy $nio $qfin $wei $aihs $uxin $jt
Some lucky insiders will be feasting on bat soup tonight.
