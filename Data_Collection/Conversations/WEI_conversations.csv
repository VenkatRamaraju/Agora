Yes !!! Told.yall burn m to the ground !!!!
"Chinese stocks are getting bludgeoned today,WEI included.Hopefully this will pass"
"Peeping MRIN's 5 day chart for the past few days in comparison to Wei's, MRIN is slightly ahead of WEI and was down 32 percent as well but later bounced back and is up 52 % today. Be patient y'all, shorts will be dissenting back into the deep dark abyss of their mama's basement very soon"
"Don't forget about yesterdays eod dip, that recovered above the day's high."
I love you day traders today. Your pumps profited me about $2000 in a couple hours.
UXIN>>>WEI
This is probably the strangest stock i have ever watched.
Thanks for the 2.41's
"Spike the $3 mark, spike it!!!"
To the moon 
buy 1000 USD and wait and see
Why the big move up ?
Told ya. They got your shares first before pushing it up. BUY now and HODL.
20 day moving average support at $1.62 wish it hold
In @1.49
In @ $1.87 YESTERDAY cause anyone that can read a chart could tell you this was coming today... shorts are panicking!!!
If this dips to 2.18 I will be loading up
Bag holders
oh my god surely this can't continue
Are they still alive?
We will see another big jump by 1pm till EOD...
Just holding tight
Let's see if we see two green days for the first time in about 2 months.... $doyu $yy $huya $iq $momo $qtt $wei $qd $lx $jfu
Ebon nept right awayThe Magnificent One
"If you still have the shares, think about taking profits, will go down further AH."
welcome to the most boring stock in the world
Remember when I said sell now cuz it’ll be $2 in the morning??? 
Follow the volume is key
A lot of buying. Needed to pull back but watch for the second run on this one today. Could push above 6.
"3:00 ==== BUY,BUY,BUY!!!!"
it is the day to go upppp
"Got awfully silent here, either because I muted so many $5/h stock bashers or they have bailed themselves. $doyu $huya $baba $iq $qtt $pdd $momo $uxin $kxin $lx $yy $bili $jd $jt $wei $jfu $aihs $qd $bidu"
Very niceClosing above 3.5 $
5 day RMI is looking good! Hopefully once we hit $2 this thing takes off again
"Oh yea! This thing is just flyin high! All of you, especially ""thepriceisright"" were on point!"
Sold it! will go back to $1ish later.
So this was .88 in the morning and now is more than $8?
Any day the sleeping dragon will wake again !! Load up !
Why is it going down so much ..where is the 6$ plus everyone was saying
"Accumulating today, will start running later this week. Bought big today"
Rocket ready for launch
Bought this at 10:45 AM @1.45 N sold at 11:34 @4.20 5000 shares...do u math....
BUY BUY BUY !!!!
This will climb up again like yesterday... load up...
"Take it easy guys, this will come back to 3 today no worries"
great all the whimps about to exit collecting pennies volume speaks for itself back up we go
expect $5 tomorrow . Will close above 3 today
Shorting at these levels would be financial suicide. Any positive news will boost $kweb and chinese inet shares by at least 15%. Also seeing a bottom forming. Today's action is pretty bullish for the sector. $baba $iq $doyu $momo $huya $yy $pdd $bili $jd $jfu $wei $lx $qd $bili $qtt $mkd
And halted
Back to $10
Weidai is up 10.19% to 1.19
Last support $1.36 after that all the to under $1
Sell sell sell
I have seen the 1 dollar range so often last months. Time to get back for 1.30 at least
once we break 2.50 we are clear
"This stock is way oversold, so undervalued."
Any news as to why this is tanking to near 52 week low?
GOING AGAIN
look like it will this follow the SPI? $40.00
I feel so sorry for anyone holding a short position here.
Total cash per share is $ 13. With all the shorts this is going to easily run up to two digits
"Appears to be a classic pump and dump!!! Hope not, but looks like lots their could be lots of new future bag holders here. If that is true but yours still a believing long, just ride it out and be patient. WEI has a lot to fix, but they're getting there."
This has potential to reach back to $13...
Power hour is coming
Shorts are betting all adr will eventually be delisted. This plus china and usa behaviour have made the VIE's practically unprotected and uninvestible. I would urge the SEC to prohibit any short selling of chinese ADR until US and CHINA have come up with a solution in order to protect investors. $baba $jd $kweb $pdd $bili $huya $doyu $momo $qtt $qd $lx $cciv $iq $yy $nio $qfin $wei $aihs $uxin $jt
2$ Breaking out
$JT is next
they made 414 m of US dollar revenue in 2019 and profit of 38 M. Oversold too much because of covid 19 started in China this year. Well I am speculating the company should continue to generate decent revenue from its lending business due to quick recovery of COVID 19. This should be a $6 stock.
P&D
On our way to 3.00 GLTA
is it a buy now ?
All this without news ?
Buying opportunity
how high can it go ?......$3.50.....
Some lucky insiders will be feasting on bat soup tonight.
"was 11 dollars last year, should go back up"
Weidai is up 15.16% to 1.87
"Just saw news today that China gov is going to push spending including cars so NIO, XPEV and LI will benefit from. Tomorrow big UP!!!""National Standing Committee: Deploy to boost bulk consumption, key consumption and promote the release of rural consumption potential. According to news from the government network, the meeting pointed out that first, we must expand automobile consumption. Second, we must promote the consumption of home appliances, furniture and decoration. Encourage local governments to subsidize the elimination of old home appliances and furniture and purchase of green smart home appliances and environmentally friendly furniture. Third, we must boost catering consumption. Fourth, we must use the expansion of county and township consumption as a starting point to drive rural consumption.""Less. tekst from forum Nio was this. Weidai will profit too of this"
Hi guys. What is happening?
If you did not hold like I told you to please do not chase in the morning wait for the dip after 10am is your entry point
Wow. What a score that was. Shorted at $9.25 before the halt yesterday after hours. I was hoping it would go back into the 2's after it started trading again. Still haven't closed my short position. Not being greedy but won't it go back below $2 soon?
How exactly do you find these stocks before they blow ? What's the secret ? Seriously I don't understand how so many people just know about a random cheap stock within 24 hours of it blowing up over 300%I'd like to get rich too lol Wwr was my lucky shot
Don't forget AIHS
"A post from smart money on ihubWEI 7.96 HALT T-1 ***NEWS PENDING if they drop news its going $15+ if they drop offering watch out below 10/20/2020 17:43:06 WEI Weidai Ltd.

"This pull a little today. run up in after hours. pull before open tomorrow and hit a hit of $7.50 tomorrow before this party gets done.I will wait till tomorrow high before shorting, you short now, you lose big time"
Volume is extraordinary huge...buying by institutionals ??
NO HURRIES NO WORRIES I will let it ride overnight and add in the morning swing
"no news and up 23% whats going on, is there any news coming out?"
..THERE ARE NO TRADING HALTS IN AFTER HOURS. This could go to 20!!!!!!!!!! Wish I owned shares... But am so happy that I am not holding any short positions.
Going to fly tomorrow
Should be $ 5 by tomorrow
Well I have only lost 500 of the 2500 I made yesterday. Still holding a small position. Hoping for that dead cat bounce.
Just broke $2 resistance
Was there any indication this was going to skyrocket today? Or do only the inside traders get to profit?
Load up this is going to 6 !!!
Do your own due diligence.http://weidai.investorroom.com/
It’s still halted ....
"50 days moving average is $1.56, 20 days moving average is $1.62,,,,, lets see close above any of them"
"Yesterday WEI projected growth for 2021. This should soon be going back up in the green again: Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company revises earnings guidance for the full year 2021. For the period, the company expects full-year 2021 net sales to range between $2.75 billion and $2.85 billion, updated from the previous range of $2.70 billion and $2.80 billion."
"Anything can happen, upside potential weighs more than going downhill!!"
DUO is moving. Will run like WEI up 100% very soon
"wei will crashbelow 35 to 50 cent soon ,be very careful in investing in chinese fintech companies and finacial instition .

Yesterday I bought this at 10:45 AM @1.45 N sold at 11:34 @4.20 5000 shares...do u math....
Don't be surprised to you see the chinese internet companies become the next pump. Investors will reposition for the coming 6 months and have few other places to go. Today's sell off is a bullish signal for $kweb $baba $jd $iq $doyu $huya $momo $qtt $yy $qd $lx $pdd $tuya $didi $nio $wei $aihs $jfu $jt $uxin $cciv
I know it was halted last night at after hours but why is it showing nothing now? Can anyone explain?

Hmm Hit 3.00
wait until HGSH is done...patience is key
Weidai is down 15.09% to 0.95
Could see 10 dollars here today GLTA don't sell
Not a pump and dump scene here today this beast is going to stabilize tomorrow for a continued run and settle end of day around $5-$6...
rule of thumb: a stock that goes up 3x in one day is a sell at the end of the dayit's not complicated
"86 million shares traded today, can’t wait to see what tomorrow brings!"
will close@3.25
Get in now.. wild ride ahead!!!
Up up and a $WEI...
Made a move from .75 to $10 the other day. Can it do it again? I believe it can 
SOOOO happy I shorted at 4.70
How can you possibly go from +55% AH to -20% PM?
This stepchild is going for a run soon
"IT IS NOT halted in the sense you think.The dealer... simply closed table..See. Stocks like this in AH.. have allotments so to speak..Once filled.. they can without reason.Push ask and bid to nadq.See once stock is off the hours ..AH and pre trade..They the dealer... (and believe it that is what they call them) can play or go home... Think"" jc somgan"" .as dealer..In ah and pre trade..This is how it has been and will be doneWith stocks held by investors institutions rather than entirely on the street itself..This is why Chinese co.s. unadudited ..Use jc sorgan and others like them to go public...There. Happy learning"
It’s was a great party. Got in @6.50 cash out @ 8.00. Million thanks to Chinese pumpers. 
Once we hit $2 a share I think this will take off...
$MKD ($1.56) IPO less than a year ago at $6.. 52 week high $12 I expect at least that.. last earnings were great. This is THE NEXT CHINA NAME. $KXIN $WEI
"ASTC is having a run/short squeeze, they have real news from yesterday’s after hours, smaller float and this might jump to new highs."
Sell and come to CPOP
Weidai is up 14.55% to 1.25
Below $3 is still cheap. Everyone's back from lunch. This will rip anytime now.
buy now more!!!
The question is how they are doing in post-Covid environment.
Keep in mind stock was 10$ a few days ago This can Reverse Hard and Fast
I was going to cover at $2.00 from $4.07...but $1.80 sound better!
$WEI bottom on the hourly increasing volume and massive PreMarket bid support like we had before the run that started yesterday at 9:30 $NAKD $SNMP
Should i Sell or its gonna open higher
Whos sold WEI @3 and bought UXIN today??? You are very welcome!
Its 35% up AH
What is the next resistance ?
"Not yet, normally when KXIN run is over, it gives way to WEI run to commence. People pumping KXIN and RENN are the same pumping WEI, thus prepare for a two day run of WEI starting from today."
"this will have ascaryscary crash crash back below 60 cent that is the usual pattern it alway alway does that , get what you can now or get alotlot less then 60 cent soon beveryvery afraid to lossalotlot moremoney"
43 million shares traded already today. I can’t imagine there being this much volume and this thing not hitting $5+ a share
Halted?
Who bought at +3 today???
This is going to go go go and then just tank at 12
Finally. Seems like its been years since this thing moved. Maybe it will do an XYF 2.25 to 17.88 Fingers crossed. Congrats longs.
2.5 soon again 
Wow!
QD is a Chinese Fintech similar to WEI... Hopefully QD is ready for a move tomorrow. QD is up a bit today.
Tanteh starting as well $TANH
If you look at the 3 year chart this thing used to be $13 a share. Not saying that’s going to happen but there is the potential for a big run
Here we go again. Clear your stop loss posts.
HEADED NEAR $3 STRONG VOLUME
Can we run to 8 again?
going to $6 hold!!

"Waiting for 0,90~$. After that 3 months waiting and to 10$. Mao Tse Tung said"

"I was hoping for a half decent day today! It was at 2.65 when I got in the bath last night and at 1.90 when I got out, I thought I was seeing things!"
"People just want too much, it was 0.80$ few days ago and now they are angry When it touch 4$ in premarket"
This will fly AH
Company from China? lol get out now if you have profits
"The nos are wrong. How can a company with mc less than 100 mil,but produces revenue of a billion+ with a gross profit margin of 660mil+?"
will close above 3 today. Consolidating before the run
"No stock is trading like WEI in today’s trading, just think what might possibly happen soon!!!!!!!!!!! Any ONE holding WEI can become a reacher Investor/Trader. Glta"

"things are picking up alright, these next few days will be big."
Could it be a halt for a run up?
Bullish now !! Incredible !!
think it will hit or clear the 52 week high of 6.5 today or tomorrow?
This thing may cross 20 in after hours....I truly can't believe my eyes.
"Warned everybody 1000 times yesterday. When do you people finally learn? Chinese are all SCAMMERS. All of them! Always look if they are Chinese or Israëli based. If so, DONT BUY them. Its 99/100 pump and dump. I lost so much money on these pumps before, but now i short them. When i see things like this running out of nowhere, no news, 50x normal volume and Chinese, its a pump and dump. Every single time. Short it as soon as it becomes 2-3 hours before close and your golden. Short at 2,54 covert at 2,04. Should have waited longer but i am fine with that."
any experts here pl advice if WEI is a hold for overnight?
This is really gambling...
why so little interest on such a low PE stock with positive earnings?
