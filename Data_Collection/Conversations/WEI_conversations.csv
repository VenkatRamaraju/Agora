Weidai is up 14.44% to 1.03
Very niceClosing above 3.5 $
Shorting at these levels would be financial suicide. Any positive news will boost $kweb and chinese inet shares by at least 15%. Also seeing a bottom forming. Today's action is pretty bullish for the sector. $baba $iq $doyu $momo $huya $yy $pdd $bili $jd $jfu $wei $lx $qd $bili $qtt $mkd
Listen to the news China stocks are in ...one at a time hold for 2 day runs don't panic sell...follow the volume follow the trend...tomorrow xyf...aihs...uxin. Timing is everything..follow me as I follow the charts unless you follow your own charts..
43 million shares traded already today. I canâ€™t imagine there being this much volume and this thing not hitting $5+ a share
How exactly do you find these stocks before they blow ? What's the secret ? Seriously I don't understand how so many people just know about a random cheap stock within 24 hours of it blowing up over 300%I'd like to get rich too lol Wwr was my lucky shot
Any news as to why this is tanking to near 52 week low?
Hold or sell ?
Why is it going down so much ..where is the 6$ plus everyone was saying
Wei .92
Will be same as Futu or not?
People better move to weidai #WEI. This one is about to run soon.
"Not yet, normally when KXIN run is over, it gives way to WEI run to commence. People pumping KXIN and RENN are the same pumping WEI, thus prepare for a two day run of WEI starting from today."
Weidai is up 14.10% to 0.89
What does this company do again?
