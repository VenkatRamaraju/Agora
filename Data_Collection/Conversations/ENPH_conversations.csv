Solar on fire! $ENPH $CSIQ
"Why is there upside early in the day, then always red at end?"
Where do you see if once the infrastructure bill passes?
I guess all the ENPH traders are on vacation! Incredibly low volume. Summer doldrums?
"From a major new Washington Post story.. Hoping that with the factory on the Mexican border, we can skirt many of these issues as they deal with goods coming from China:The commercial pipeline that each year brings $1 trillion worth of toys, clothing, electronics and furniture from Asia to the United States is clogged and no one knows how to unclog it.This month, the median cost of shipping a standard rectangular metal container from China to the West Coast of the United States hit a record $20,586, almost twice what it cost in July, which was twice what it cost in January, according to the Freightos index. Essential freight-handling equipment too often is not where it’s needed, and when it is, there aren’t enough truckers or warehouse workers to operate it.As Americans fume, supply headaches that were viewed as temporary when the coronavirus pandemic began now are expected to last through 2022.Dozens of cargo vessels stuck at anchor off the California coast illustrate the delivery disruptions that have become the signature feature of the recovery, fueling inflation, sapping growth and calling into question the global economic model that has prevailed for three decades."
New to ENPH - question ? How does Enphase match with TESLA Solar ( does it integrate ) - Am sure it has been discussed.
Welcome to the micro market Generac. https://www.pv-tech.org/generac-launches-line-of-simplified-microinverters/
$175 before OCT???
Wow! make no mistake!
"Yahoo seems to have increased the number of ads lately. When I open Yahoo Finance I get 17-18 separate processes running, which is slowing down my laptop. Has anyone else noticed this over the last week or so?"
Seems like a great time to buy some calls. How much does ENPH have left to buy back their own stock?
the small buys and sells are the manipulation of the big holders hoping you sell.... dont bite.
I bought tons of ENPH Nov 19 2021 150 Call yesterday guys!
TOTAL manipulation . Lets go for $190
Time to load up on the dip!
"I've a feeling that 161.36 , is the proverbial bottom, but with this 'Solar Coaster"" and the hedge fund 'players' you never know. I'm in it long. They have the patents, the network, the best product in a highly sought after field, they beat estimates, and show almost unlimited potential to continue to do so. In spite of that, stock prices go down after success. Big players here, I believe, on the cusp of buying the hell out of this one. Want security? Go with the Solar Coaster. ENPH. No one knows..."
"Came across this from a utility dive December 2019 article. Pretty amazing. Shows the the power of VPP's to support the grid. Tesla and Australia currently lead the world in the use of this technology, but Enphase is coming on strong. Expect far more emphasis on using Enphase solar + storage in VPP's. You get paid for it and it can drastically increase your ROI:Dive Brief:The 50,000-home virtual power plant (VPP) Tesla is developing in South Australia helped maintain grid stability when a coal-fired unit in Queensland tripped offline and reduced system supply by 748 MW in October.According to the Australian Energy Market Operator, the outage caused power system frequency to drop below normal levels but Tesla's VPP was able to inject power from hundreds of individual residential batteries to help return the system frequency back to stable levels.This is not the first time a Tesla battery project has benefited the South Australian electric grid. Last year the Hornsdale Power Reserve project, which includes a 100 MW/129 MWh battery facility, twice stepped in when coal units went down.Dive Insight:The October incident, reported by the South Australian government last month, is an example of how battery storage can benefit the grid. And it is even more impressive given that the VPP project is still some ways from completion.""Although the Virtual Power Plant is in its early days, it is already demonstrating how it can provide the network support traditionally performed by large conventional generators,"" South Australia Minister for Energy and Mining Dan van Holst Pellekaan said in a statement.Once complete, the VPP will include 50,000 houses fitted with 5 kW rooftop solar systems and 13.5 kWh Tesla batteries. Together, they will be capable of delivering up to 250 MW of solar power and 650 MWh of energy storage.So far, less than 1,000 homes have been completed. Still, the aggregated storage was able to make a difference."
Wolfe Research Starts Enphase Energy at Outperform With $222 Price Target
IF enph follows its recent pattern it will start to rise into 3rd quarter earnings. They should be impressive.
"For those who follow Enphase, this recent tech brief is very good news for generator support with Ensemble... https://www4.enphase.com/sites/default/files/downloads/support/Enphase-Tech-Brief-Why-Larger-EN-US_0.pdf?utm_source=community&utm_medium=answer_links&utm_campaign=internal_reference"
Low volume . Wait n see timeStill I like this price point to buy more shares.
maxn panels and enph inverters recipie for money 
European and Middle Eastern energy prices have spiraled to levels that are out of control. There is National Guard driving British fuel trucks. Lebanon lights went off for days. Germany is going to finally pay Russian natural gas prices. This will drive solar outside the U.S. That is the growth story here.
~$175 seems to be the resistance. Could really do to see that get obliterated
"• Sunrun (RUN +0.8%) and Enphase Energy (ENPH +3.3%) push higher after BMO Capital initiates overage with Outperform ratings and respective $200 and $65 price target, forecasting a multiyear boom in U.S. residential solar in the U.S.• Noting that Sunrun is the largest U.S. residential solar provider, BMO's Ameet Thakkar says the company continues to drive down its cost of capital, which could results in more free cash flow to equity.• On Enphase, Thakker expects ""meaningful"" earnings growth thanks to higher solar adoption rates, increased revenue and entry into small commercial markets.• SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG +2.5%) and Sunnova Energy (NOVA +1.5%) also win Buy ratings at BMO, with respective $357 and $50 stock price targets."
Should I buy here or wait for further drop. Based on replys I will look to buy 1K shares before the closing bell.
Wolfe! Wolfe! Up we go....
"Other tax credits would go toward spurring American business investment in the clean energy sector, which Granholm said is on its way to being a $23 trillion market in the years ahead. (According to the World Bank, the Paris Climate Accords opened up ""nearly $23 trillion in opportunities for climate-smart investments in emerging markets between now and 2030."")"
A Zolly post would be the cherry on top of today!

"Well, Zacks came out yesterday and listed ENPH as a ""toxic stock"". That means it is time to load up. Zacks seems to be an inverted indicator. Of course, they'll have another piece next week touting the ""growing strength"" and recommend it as a buy. Glad I never paid for Z's advice. It's like trading in a rear view mirror. I prefer a crystal ball. If congress can get it together, this will be remembered as a nervous jitter."
"I love the company, but, this stock is just not cutting it. Too many other options out there that are actually performing (stocks)."
"ENPH on a downward trend. Irrefutable.Today down 3.34%1 month down 6.38%YTD down 4.05%That’s a bad trend folks.Analysts are neutral to bearish.Am going to hold thru this Q, expect another good ER, a bounce, hear how microchip shortage capped sales and I sell before PPS again erodes.Until the P/E gets to 75 (still high) we can’t reasonably expect share price to rise. The glamour period is past.IMO"
"Happy to see the move today, good news regarding solar and enph. May this be a positive turning point for us guys."
MANIPULATION
Janet Yellen aka old battlelax is speaking now. Expect the market to tank.
"Shares of several solar stocks are trading higher amid energy supply shortages, causing a potential increase in demand for alternative energy sources."
Markets are getting hammer because of the in-fighting and bickering brought on by our elected officials. Deal done? We’re back up and more
"Zach’s should be sued...Nevertheless, y’all are right. Do the opposite of what they say and you’re golden!"
"evergrande's possible inability to pay their loans caused a massive sell-off today which may follow by this weeks fed talk about possibly tapering before years end, be careful & prepare some cash if need be. bc opportunities like these won't come around often.. I am buying everything I firmly believe in & holding long term. specially enphase."
This seems to me to be a good time to add a bit to your ENPH holdings
"Next 20 years, people! ..... Solar is baked into Government mandates and energy source of choice"
"toal overreaction. FED WONT tap now for many reasons . CHEAP shares before New highs, i think"
Totally being manipulated by big bad boys guys! Down over $10 yesterday was outrageous
I hold stocks from around $40. I might need some money for an investment in couple months. Should I take out some profits or just hold on. worried if there will be pull back after fed meeting. Suggestions?
"The type of winds we saw there would push a solar racking system to its limits. That was seen in Puerto Rico several years ago when their grid was devastated. At that time Tesla powerwall sales jumped, but that was before Encharge. The situation is now different and Enph has a product it can sell. Yes, people think of generators in these types of situations but a storage-only system (even without PV) would still provide backup in these circumstances. The battery can charge from the grid, and be set in a particular mode by the customer (it could still provide peak shaving if desired, or not under normal circumstances) and in an off-grid situation it could still have around 10kWh of stored energy (assuming 1 Encharge10). With load shedding, the customer can disconnect non-essential loads from the already limited number of backed-up loads and can make that 10kWh last a lot longer, for uses like cpap machines or medical equipment. Without PV the battery won't recharge in an extended off-grid scenario but with load shedding that 10kWh can be easily and conveniently stretched out. Existing Encharge owners can also do that manually."
"From CNBC: Extreme weather events across the U.S. — from wildfires and drought in the West, to deep freezes and floods in the South and Southeast — have disrupted the electric grid this year. As a result, homeowners are buying solar and energy storage systems at rates never before seen, according to data from solar website SolarReviews.com.As California faces devastating wildfires and record drought, the website saw a 358% year-over-year jump in solar estimate quotes requested by California residents between June 30 and Aug. 6.￼The state has also faced numerous power outages over the past year. PG&E has cut the power on several occasions when dry conditions and high winds increase the risk of sparking a fire. The state has also had trouble on the power supply side, and the California Independent System Operator has issued flex alerts, calling on customers to cut usage when demand is expected to peak. In some cases, rolling blackouts have taken place when power availability comes up short."
"Does anyone know when Ensemble in a Box will be available for consumer purchase in the US? I have a great ENPH system for my home (IQ7s on the roof, Encharge 10 in the basement), but I'm looking to power up some stuff in the field. I'm pricing out a 30 watt panel, charge controller, and a 12v deep cycle marine battery, and I just thought I better try to get an update on the ""in a box"" product. If it's less than 2 months away, I'd like that!"
Buying in AH
SPWR made an acquisition using 1M ENPH shares netting $178M. https://investors.sunpower.com/node/26756/html
come on Green close !!
Bought (much) more Expect the SP to soar on news from next conf call and quarterly reports for several years d thereafter. Time to fasten the seatbelt.
"Will the management team announce any news about IQ8 before the end of Q3? Have they put out any pre-order numbers? Are they taking pre-orders for the IQ8 or IQ8D? They have been talking about this product for several years now and how impactful it is going to be.Very happy to see the new release about the marketing hire. Enphase averages about 2-3 news releases a quarter. They are not big on keeping their products in relevant conversations. You can make the best burger in the world but, you can only sell it to the people who know how to get it. The impact of the Allison hire has been underwhelming to date, let's hope this last move redeems her glory of past."
sell volume is too low..... buy the heck out of this over sold gem.
long term people!
Buying little by little
come on lets close GREEN
I dont believe it . Why now the drop???
"Not directly related to Enphase, but exciting news by Plug Power today. Air travel and maritime travel are ripe for innovation and hydrogen and Fuel Cells are the obvious way to get there. I'm long PLUG and BE and also have a small position in HYZN, which was a SPAC and just reported its first quarter. If you care about green energy, definitely get literate on what is going on with the hydrogen sector. Reminds me of solar around 5-6 years ago before prices really came down and the economics changed. We are not there yet with hydrogen - but it's coming:“We’ve already revolutionized electric trucks and industrial fleets on the ground, so now we’re turning our sights to the skies,” says Andy Marsh, CEO for Plug Power. “And we’re thrilled to start this journey with Airbus. Not only do we envision a future where aircraft everywhere are powered by green hydrogen, but the airports that serve them as well, including ground support equipment, forklifts, and vehicles that shuttle consumers around airports, and to gates. In aggregate, this should go a long way toward building a more sustainable future for the global aviation industry.”Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus Vice-President, Zero-Emission Aircraft, adds: “We at Airbus see huge potential for green hydrogen to power our future zero-emission aircraft. This partnership with Plug Power – a true pioneer in developing green hydrogen infrastructure across the United States, and key points across Europe and Asia – will enable us to leverage their expertise to decarbonize airports while preparing them for the arrival of hydrogen aircraft by 2035.”Today, the aviation industry represents between 2-3% of global human-induced CO2 emissions. Airports are large cargo hubs that traditionally rely on fossil fuels to power a wide array of ground transport and equipment, and to heat buildings and terminals. Green hydrogen, which is produced through the electrolysis of water with electricity generated from renewable energy sources, has been earmarked by a variety of industries as a potential means to achieve their decarbonization targets, and the aviation industry is no exception."
"$ENPH $SPWR From Barron’s :Of the various niches within solar, SunPower clearly sees the most opportunity in residential sales. The company gets its best margins from residential, and sees the potential for the market to grow from about 3 million homes to 100 million in the U.S. Plus, it seems clear investors want the company to focus more on that niche. We agree with the company’s tightening of its focus and look forward to additional strategic strokes to strengthen the company’s direction,” wrote Baird analyst Ben Kallo, who rates the stock at Outperform with a $34 price targetThe move offers investors another pure-play bet on rooftop solar, along with Sunrun and Sunnova Energy International (NOVA). But it makes it more clear that novice investors won’t have one dominant player to bet on."
Closing price today will be around 167 before it pops again. Big pop at the open but being dragged down by the general market. Nice run the last 2 days.
Momentum building to earnings. Small deal in Australia? Multiply all the small deals in all the countries Enphase is I getting to and I’m thinking big..... 180 at earnings 220 after
I’m pretty sure that hedge funds just use this to swing for easy profits. Eventually the fundamentals of the company will overcome the manipulation.
"A recent report from the Department of Energy laid out a plan for 100% “decarbonization” of the electric grid by 2030, fueled by massive advances in industries like solar energy. A report this summer from the Rhodium group, an independent research group, said that a strategic implementation of new tax credits could be key in order to get the U.S. “closer to a 100% clean electric grid.”"
Brazil! here we come
"man , i cant understand this stock. Can anyone please explain what factors are holding it down??"
Not sure how they can sell anything without chips...you’re not going to try and sell something you can’t build... like the IQ8..they should start an iq8 preorder discount with a delivery guarantee to get the ball rolling .
"Hard to image that the solar stocks are going to avoid supply chain issues. got a huge pop today but these are pretty pricey up here. https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/14/solar-prices-jump-as-supply-chain-issues-and-raw-material-costs-weigh.html Long term bullish on solar but - have to get in at good prices and get rid of the headwinds interest rates, supply chains - no real infrastructure support for solar."
Is there a solar farm REIT or solar farm company stock?
"Does ENP have a semiconductor shortage ? Dont think so. If it was the case, they would not have made their entry into Brasil, Italy etc now."
"Good PR this morning. These kinds of incentives make it a no brainer to buy storage The program offers a new incentive for homeowners on the island of Oahu who install a new home battery. The first customers accepted by Hawaiian Electric into the Battery Bonus program will be eligible to receive $850 per kW that they commit to make available to Hawaiian Electric during a fixed two-hour period each day — for example, qualified new Encharge 10 battery owners may be eligible to earn up to $3,264.Existing Hawaiian Electric net energy metering (NEM) customers enrolling in the Battery Bonus program are also eligible to add up to 5 kW of new solar capacity to their roofs without losing their existing NEM rate agreement, resulting in even more savings."

Curious to see if there is going to be upper movement in the SP as the ER nears?!
support at 152.enphase will hit 400 summer nest year
Gonna fly Soon
I still think that this hits 140 something one more time before it climbs again. Whole market crashed yesterday because of China. Cramer is right to say avoid China Stocks. He just needs to remind himself that.
"Residential solar pricing down 6.3%, hints of greater drops comingResidential solar installation price declines have accelerated over the past year. However, energy storage pricing has gone up, with Enphase taking an increasingly larger share of the market.From a new PV Magazine story. Of course, when I try to post the link Yahoo just deletes it. So frustrating. I hate this platform. Impossible to share information. You'll have to google it.Energy storage pricing is mixed, and on average it went up across the nation. However, in key markets like Florida, California, and Texas, pricing is down. Furthermore, we’re seeing Enphase take an increasingly larger share of the home storage market, passing by Tesla to become the number one supplier.Interestingly, Enphase is tied with Sonnen as the most expensive home battery product tracked, at roughly 50% more than Tesla’s Powerwall. Enphase’s product success probably has something to do with the increase in energy storage pricing overall."
Nice volume on an up day.
"News Flash: String DC wiring on roof tops is dying. Fire depts. , Insurance companies and quality controllers want AC micro inverter's. Safer and much more efficient.Enphase is best in breed with years ahead of the chasers. Not to mention a growing international presence.A double at these levels in a year."
"Accumulation day, fellas. Get greedy when others get scared."
come on man . Why such a sell off ??? What happened from Friday???
"The Yahoo fair value indicator thingy on the Summary page is meaningless to me, but I think for the first time in the many years I've held this stock it doesn't show it pegged on the overvalued side of the slider"
Where do you think the price will be after earnings?
Nice pop today but used to it then pull back through the rest of the week. I do have a question. Anybody know what kind of components and how many come from Taiwan? I know about India and Mexico but does Taiwan fit into that equation.
Perhaps when Hurricane weather finishes removing roofs some may re-roof with solar cells and a converter so the next time some of the lights might stay on. With enough distributed roof top solar most of the lights will stay on.
Back in the 150’s next stop 140.
"Hurricane season, no power, will be good for renewable and self sufficient systems"

Honeywell to bid: 40B. They know utility scale solar is about to explode.
"Did I hear TJ Rodgers correctly today on CNBC that ENPH has fixed its chip issue? He said they now have three suppliers. If so, shouldn't Q3 earnings see a nice beat?"
"Every 5 points down, we add 5000 shares. 30k accumulated shares and counting."
Feel like I'm seeing major deja vu from last year. The price is being held down like a beach ball under water.

any news about the infrastracture bill?
Holy shirt

when the drop will stop?? One month falling now...
where's Zolly now?????
Can’t wait to see what the top notch new advertising firm does with ENPH. Such a great company to market.
Starting the day off with another analyst giving ENPH an overweight rating. Where’s Zolly?… just as predicted… follow the money. Large institutional investors are “invested” in the success of the share price.
This stock has held back by component shortages. I expect those to be gone by the end of the year. Buy now to position yourself for a strong 2022.
Solar industry is coiling for a giant blowup. Setbacks with chips/pandemic/ infrastructure bill is keeping us down but sit tight my friends ... this will pass
"Badri sold a lot of shares recently, what are your thoughts"

"A good breakdown of what is in the bi partisan infrastructure bill - if it can pass :(The legislation agreed to in the Senate authorizes $550 billion in new spending. Some lawmakers like to refer to the bill as a $1.1 trillion or $1.2 trillion package because it also includes funding for highways and other projects that are allotted every year.In the end, 19 Republican senators voted in favor of the package, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), along with all 50 Democrats."
Come on lets go Green! Hom many red days will have
gooooo 177$ by tomorrow come on byers! Huge upside
ib bi di abba da180 folks! do I hear 180 .... abba da going once ....
Where are you Guy! We need youuuu
"Sometimes I have to laugh at the ""cause and effects"" put together by analysts. MF sez Enph popped today because of news about a little community project in Australia. Right. If that's truly the reason, we need to seriously reevaluate our holdings as a feather floating on the wind as opposed to a juggernaught on a long run."
This will be a solid swing into next earnings
"Dropping today. Not sure why. But, I gots a bad feeling. One would think Elon pointing out the need to double electricity output would move this. Nothing can move this for a little while."
I see this dropping to 140 range before next move up. Still saying that it will not hit 200 again this year. 12/31 closing price 175. It will close over 200 sometime in 2022.
Typical Enphase... goes down( when it should be up)Typical Me ... I buy more below 168....

"From a new Seeking Alpha article. It's pretty clear that Tesla is no threat to ENPH or to many other solar companies. In fact, it's been a millstone:TSLA: Inside The Deterioration Of Tesla's Solar Business 5:04 pm, Mon, Aug. 23, 2021, by John Engle • Summary • Tesla's $670 billion market cap is based in part on the belief that it is ""more than a car company""; Tesla's solar energy business has fed this narrative.• While treated like a value-add by Tesla's boosters, its solar unit has in practice been a costly millstone; margins remain deeply negative.• Tesla's solar deployments have fallen far from highs set years ago, with little prospect of a reversal.• Hopes that Tesla's Solar Roof could reinvigorate deployment rates have faded amid multi-year delays and persistent installation bottlenecks.• As Tesla's solar business fades, it may threaten the company's broader growth narrative, as well as its vaunted share price."
Doubled my position yesterday. AMD CEO said the chip problem will be solved next year plus the demand of energy is rising.

India Group Starts on $10 Billion Plan for Solar PowerA subsidiary of one of India’s largest conglomerates announced two deals as part of its plan to invest more than $10 billion in renewable energy assets over the next few years.
"Hope y'all are buying ENPH now ... The ""tell"" is that ENPH just bounced off its 200 day moving average of 160.84 (fell a few PENNIES below, actually, to 160.27). ENPH will - at least - re-take its falling off target, which was circa $184. If Mr. Market recovers (once AGAIN), then ENPH rises to ca. $200+."
"The entire solar industry getting hammered. Despite some posters claiming that ENPH is not affected by the universal microchip shortage, apparently Wall Street believes otherwise.A copy and paste….The global semiconductor shortage is affecting numerous industries, and the solar industry is no exception. Investors are familiar with the impact on Enphase Energy as the company's CEO, Badri Kothandaraman, addressed the issue on the company's Q2 2021 conference call in July. Kothandaraman said that the company expected to add another semiconductor supplier in the third quarter to alleviate the supply crunch. The concern is likely weighing heavily on investors' minds. On the July call, for example, Kothandaraman said that although he expects to add the new supplier, ""Still, the semi-supply chain is stressed, though, which is why I cannot meet all my demand."" With the company failing to make an announcement, however, investors, may have speculated that the company failed to add the new supplier. Additionally, they may be worried that the company will fail"
It's approaching oversold territory..
"Looks like we're getting ready for the quarterly "" before earnings climb"" .... will be 180 plus soon.anyone have info on what Cramer might have said about Enphase the other day?"
Like I said month or so ago…. Congress inaction / actions not helping solar
enphase is entirely too sensitive to the ups and downs of the stimulus bill progress.
crammer says to not buy on the dip ..... listen and lose out
go the bill is going to pass soon / $170$ easy
"ENPH will be stuck in this channel not going anywhere until management can show they are ready to go back to hypergrowth mode next year. So maybe Q4 gets more interesting if they can give strong guidance. Otherwise, it's more of the same ""rest in place"""

"the question is not if this is a $1000 stock, its when this is a $1000 stock"
Liz Young of SOFI said to buy renewable energy stocks. I bought in with 1K shares at 150 earlier this morning and sold out at 154. Thanks Liz.
"From the last ER. Q3 will continue to see inverter constraints so I don't expect the share price to do much unless there is really great and unexpected good news on storage sales and demand. ENPH is looking more like a 2022 story, although of course the market looks out 3-6 months in the future so we could see movement later this year IF the news is good:""Let's now talk about manufacturing. As we have discussed in the past earnings calls, the demand for our microinverter systems continues to be well ahead of supply. In Q2, we experienced component constraints on the supply of AC FET drivers, which resulted in our microinverter shipment volumes slightly lower as compared to Q1. We had three AC FET driver suppliers qualified by the end of the second quarter compared to two in the first quarter.For the third quarter, we continue to remain constrained on microinverters. But the supply situation is better than what it was in the second quarter. We expect to have four suppliers qualified by the end of the third quarter.Regarding the fourth quarter, we are cautiously optimistic that the situation will be significantly better compared to the third quarter. On the ASIC used in our microinverters, we have sufficient supply. So that has not been a big constraint so far.As previously discussed, we are expanding our microinverter manufacturing capacity in Mexico and India. At our facility in India, we installed a second fully automated line in Q2 with production beginning at the end of the quarter. This brings our quarterly capacity to 1.5 million microinverters from India. In Mexico, we expect to add a fully automated manufacturing line in Q4. This will bring quarterly capacity to approximately 2.2 million microinverters in Mexico. With our existing capacity in China, we expect to easily achieve our target capacity of 5 million microinverters per quarter by the end of 2021."""
Planning to sell 1/4th of my holding to buy back again. Good Idea? Do you see a pull back coming the market overall.
This is more of a roller coaster than Bitcoin.
here it comes..... the drop..... sell then buy back in 150s
ENPH should be a starting guard in the NBA with the level of head fakes it can produce.
Oversold stock! Looks like it’s gonna fly soon.
preparing for a huge move to 175$ soon
Yeah buddy!
Come on!!!
Saw Senator Manchin on Meet the Press yesterday. It is clear he will not be voting on any major $3.5 trillion package anytime soon. He said that there must be changes in the tax code to pay for any major new legislation and that it was prudent to wait and see what happens with inflation. Given his remarks I think it’s highly unlikely any major new bill gets passed this fall.￼￼
"Been buying, holding and watching (some forced selling) since pre IPO. Never…., yes NEVER been a better time to buy."
Normally I would be happy to pick up more cheap shares... it’s the waiting that’s the hardest part...
Do you see price going up when infrastructure bill gets passed? Or it is already priced in?
"Of interest for longs. Recent study from the US Dept. of Energy and highlighted by Bloomberg News today says ""solar energy has the potential to power 40% of the nation’s electricity and employ as many as 1.5 million people by 2035"" “The study illuminates the fact that solar, our cheapest and fastest-growing source of clean energy, could produce enough electricity to power all of the homes in the U.S.,” Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm said in a statement.https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-09/Solar%20Futures%20Study.pdfhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/solar-needs-to-quadruple-for-u-s-to-achieve-carbon-free-grid?srnd=premium"
this is why money on the sidelines is your best friend ...
How does Generac micoinverter stack up against ENPH?
Hydroelectric power sources going offline due to climate change driven drought. The elimination of fossil fuel powered electric production sources is inevitable.

Load the boat!!
Does anybody here 69? It's my favorite
$160 is my target for NOV/DEC
May see $160-$170 again in OCT. IMO
Be smart. Sell those profits from the vaccine stocks and buy renewable energy.
At last ... Any green is great after the consecutive losses.
This has to climb up soon. It’s been trading down for months now.
Predictions for Q3 EPS? I'll start the bidding at $0.59. A nice beat.
"I wonder if the nice turn around in some green stocks today is tied to the debt ceiling compromise that gives the Dems until December to pass their legislation via reconciliation? This will give the Dems enough time pass both infrastructure bills as well, so maybe market thinks odds are getting better? From WAPO:Senate Democrats signaled Wednesday that they would be open to approving a Republican-offered deal that addresses the debt ceiling into early December, yet critical details about the path forward still threaten to scuttle the new attempt to stave off default.The wrangling stemmed from a proposal put forward earlier in the day by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky). The top GOP lawmaker said his party would accept what could be a two-month extension of the country's borrowing cap, which would give Democrats more time to complete a process by which they could raise the debt ceiling further without relying on Republican votes."
All I can say it is a good thing oil prices are also going up as far as a hedge on solar. Still keeps us cost competitive to oil energy resources
"Popping big on very low volume. Not sure this will hold but I'll take it! Green stocks popping all over the place today. Check out SEDG, MAXN, CWEN etc. The news from India could be driving this action by algos. Ambani has just made a massive $2B investment in solar."
Keybanc has just initiated coverage with overweight. Says it has a solid core business and expanding opportunities.
al news points to Solar doing well for the next 20 years.
"Reliance in June said it would invest $10.1 billion in clean energy over three years.Owned by Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, the company plans to build solar capacity of at least 100 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, accounting for over a fifth of India's target of installing 450 GW by the end of this decade."
Surprised that ENPH stock price and solar stock prices in general are not much higher because oil and gas prices are near or at 7 year highs. High oil and gas prices should be great for solar in general. As for SPWR great product but dysfunctional financials.
"I’m not sure about you all, but ENPH is my one stock that I circle back to…When my other investments pop, if ENPH is even slightly down (as it is now), I take profits and pile into ENPH. I love it! This investment is a huge part of what will drive the next generation of the U.S. and global economies. I hope to triple my investment here in the months to come."
$165 - $170 before OCT!!!
its going over 165 before the EoW
Yesterday full bullish action for all solars today the sky is falling . What a farse...
"Growth tech is getting hammered because of rising bond yields. ENPH still has incredible fundamentals, we will be fine."

Anyone out there selling calls against some of their shares? I think most know I am a long-term holder and have been in this thing since $1.24. For about the past 6 months I've been generating a bit of income by selling calls against a portion of my shares....usually 2 to 3 weeks out and fairly far out of the money as I want to keep my shares. My most recent one was 9/17 $200 calls I was able to sell for $1.20 last Monday....don't think I have to worry about losing those ;-) Curious if others are doing this? Have a good weekend everyone.
glad to see enphase doing what it does best. recover lost ground in a few days. dips to me are must buy for a company with such strong fundamentals as this one. I don't care what it does now or in 6 months gotta think long term with this one.
How is this not at 180
