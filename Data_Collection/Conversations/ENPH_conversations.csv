Not invested here but I am in RUN & SPWR so thank you enphase for the sector boost! Go solar longs!
This stock is still hugely undervalued. Why? IQ8 inverter will be what the IPhone was to Blackberry and Nokia phones.
"Wow! Enphase minting lots of new millionaires today I'm sure. So THIS is how the rich get richer!! Biggest single day gain in my portfolio ever. Have to say, I did not see this coming. Was hoping for a solid ER and no big sell off. Got a rocket blast off instead! Never know with the market which is why you have to be in it to win it."
"Awesome move ENPH. If this keeps going up, I hope I can install a solar system at my house by selling some of the stock. How much does it cost to install for a 1200 sq ft house?"
"Barclays analyst Moses Sutton raised the PT to $273 from $213, indicating a 26% upside, and maintained an Overweight.With chip shortage concerns ""solved for now,"" Enphase is ""now unfettered and likely returns to being investors' blank canvas for modeling a leading TAM-conquering solar/storage play,"" Sutton notes.Citi analyst J.B. Lowe raised the PT to $231 from $214, indicating a 7% upside, and affirmed a Buy.With its solid Q3 results, Enphase has now strung together 18 straight quarters of meeting or exceeding its revenue and gross margin guidance, Lowe notes."
"Strongest breakout since 10 to 1 IPO reverse split in 2012. Been holding and buying ever since. Seems as if the value of the new products are resonating beyond those of us in the know. “Sunlight back-up” Badri’s new slogan explains IQ8 best (yet). Next up, Ensemble-in-a-box: another low key solar disruptive product. 220 will be a common entry point for the new savy investment crew. Welcome to the machine.. where have you bern?"
"CFRA buy opinion:“ Our 12-month target price of $249, raised $62, reflects a 70x multiple applied to projected '22 EPS. While this is a premium to ENPH's historical forward average, we think a premium is merited by IQ8 what we see as a significant improvement in the value proposition that ENPH can offer its customers going forward. We lift our '21 EPS estimate by $0.13 to $2.52, and '22's by $0.15 to$3.55. Q3 EPS of $0.60, vs. $0.30, beat the consensus view by $0.30. While theQ3 performance was solid, the outlook is remarkable, as the newly-unveiled IQ8energy system should be disruptive to the solar energy market in our opinion enabling solar power even in the event of a grid outage. ENPH has guided to anIQ8 ramp-up of 4-6 quarters, which should help in '22 and accelerate in '23.Supply chain issues are likely to remain for the time being, but ENPH is pushing through price hikes to help offset those headwinds, and margin performance was still good in Q3.”Game changer"
Can we see $300 in near future?
"I want to congratulate the brilliant Enphase engineers for today’s announcement which has probably been over a decade in the making. This was always the vision of the company and it’s finally here. Most people apart from Enphase fanboys won’t realize this, but the IQ8 is a game changer with radical implications for energy generation around the world. It’s a product of human reason and ingenuity and the main reason I stayed invested here all of these years. It will help usher in a new age of cheap clean energy for millions around the world."
No profit taking for me yesterday. So happy to see it find support above 200 without a significant pullback -- and now taking off again. $225 is a key level for me. I'm holding long!
"Congrats BE longs. This is a HUGE validation of the company and its technology and operational know how. This is very early innings in the hydrogen economy. Another long term John Doerr investment that is paying off. Hoping that $AMRS does the same. Certainly $ENPH has! Big news out today at Enphase - the long awaited IQ8 inverter is finally announced. It's a game changer in solar. For the first time ever, your solar panels will still generate electricity and automatically create a micro grid if the main grid goes down instead of shutting off - if you don't own a battery. The implications are radical - especially in poor countries with a weak or non existent grid."
"Financial highlights for the third quarter of 2021 are listed below. • Record revenue of $351.5 million • GAAP gross margin of 39.9%; non-GAAP gross margin of 40.8% • GAAP operating income of $37.4 million; non-GAAP operating income of $85.9 million • GAAP net income of $21.8 million, non-GAAP net income of $84.2 million • GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.15; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.60 • Cash flow from operations of $113.4 million • Ending cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $1.4 billion"
"Still holding onto 500 shares, wishing I had the 15,000 I was up to in 2019. Ah well, probably hold on to these for many more years, cost basis $4.85."
"I am surprised Enphase holding that good, because especially this stock was always tanking hard in the past after earnings and past earnings were all great. It was not unusual for this stock to tank 10% and more in a blink after earnings, but now even after an unbelievable 25% gain yesterday the stock is holding like a rock. Seems to be this time different, enphase really looking good."
"October 25, 2021 8:00 AM EDTEnphase Energy Launches IQ8, the Industry’s First Microgrid-Forming MicroinverterPre-orders begin today, with production shipments expected in December for North American customersFREMONT, Calif., Oct. 25, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: ENPH), a global energy technology company and the world's leading supplier of microinverter-based solar and battery systems, today announced the all-new, all-in-one Enphase Energy System with IQ8 solar microinverters for customers in North America. IQ8 is Enphase’s smartest microinverter yet. Unlike competing devices, IQ8 is capable of forming a microgrid during a power outage using only sunlight, providing backup power even without a battery.“Since the company’s inception, we invested in custom application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips for our microinverters, and today we see the payoff with a software-defined microinverter smart enough to form a microgrid, unlocking value for homeowners,” said Badri Kothandaraman, president and CEO of Enphase. “Many homeowners often assume their solar systems will function if the sun is shining, even during a power outage. This has unfortunately not been true until today. Now, with IQ8, homeowners can realize the true promise of solar — to make and use their own power. IQ8 solar microinverters can provide Sunlight Backup during an outage, even without a battery.”The Enphase Energy System with IQ8 comes in four different configurations: the first is “Solar Only”; the second is “Sunlight Backup” with no battery; the third is “Home Essentials Backup” with a small battery; and the fourth is “Full Energy Independence” with a large battery. While the first configuration is a standard grid-tied system, the remaining configurations are grid-agnostic systems which need an Enphase System Controller (formerly called Enpower smart switch) to island the home during an outage. For homeowners who want a battery, there are no sizing restrictions on pairing an Enphase battery with the solar system. And all configurations can be customized for homeowners with the help of Enphase installer partners.“The IQ8 microinverter, being a true microgrid microinverter, is going to be a gamechanger for this industry,” said Aimee Carpenter, CEO of Washington-based Solterra Solar and Texas-based Good Energy Solar. “Until IQ8, it was challenging to properly manage customer expectations of battery design and sizing limitations and to explain different options. Enabling a customer to start with any size Enphase battery and grow over time is going to make battery backup with solar a possibility for many more of our customers.”“We’re all in on IQ8. Over the past years, we’ve watched as batteries become part of every conversation we have with homeowners, and now we can provide more options for any configuration of energy system because of the new IQ8 technology,” said Mike Thompson, founder of California-based Golden Bear Solar. “We know our customers love Enphase products from the Enphase App to batteries and microinverters, and with increased grid outages in Northern California, we’re excited to provide more backup for more customers.”The IQ8 family includes five types of software-defined microinverters, IQ8, IQ8+, IQ8M, IQ8A and IQ8H, with peak output AC power of 245VA, 300VA, 330VA, 366VA and 384VA, respectively. The IQ8H microinverter is Enphase’s most powerful microinverter to date and has a California Energy Commission (CEC) efficiency of 97 percent. The multiple types of IQ8 enable seamless pairing with a full range of solar modules, even up to 540W DC.IQ8 pilot installations began in Q3 with select installer partners. Distributor and installer partners in North America can pre-order IQ8 starting today, with production shipments expected in December.

They now have solar, storage, load control, generator ability - they will remain laser focused on the digital platform to have the best consumer experience possible.Investor day - November 16th"
"Badri on the IQ8. No surprise to us fanboys!Why will the IQ8 make a huge difference? Because most homeowners still think that when the grid is down they will still get energy from their panels. Only a few understand that is not the case. IQ8 changes the paradigm. It does not require any particular storage size to be paired with it. The IQ8 is blazing fast and can adjust to any grid conditions. We think that a small cheap battery will ensure that you have enough resilience. Don't need to buy a big battery, especially with places with reliable grids. Enphase will provide the entire range needed. The homeowner education process will take some time. This product will be a GAME CHANGER. Who would buy a grid tied product? We think it will make a HUGE difference for our business going forward."
I think very few understand the growth potential with this company. Today's value is just the beginning.
"What a glorious week, fellow longs! Please celebrate your ownership in this amazing company by going out with friends and drinking some excellent spirits! (Good wine is my pleasure.) And don't forget to raise a glass to Badri and the team!"
