If this company is such a failure why has institutional ownership gone from 70+% to 96% and insiders are buying instead of selling their options for the first time ever. The truth is in what happens. Short sellers need to go find another company with all the SPATS you have plenty of choices.
"no where to go but up, conversion coming sooner than expected, in the long run a M&A deal around $50.. ceo is as loose as a GOOSE!!!,he's no operator a deal maker"
"$97 to $18 in a 7.5 year period - a reall wnner here, regardless the name."
Mandia would be better managing a 7-11.
"Should be at least a $40 stock now with FireEye out of the picture. Possibly higher once the financials reflect Mandiant's growth. MNDT's revenue hit $400M in 2020, up 20% from 2019. Sales were up 25%. They expect to hit $1B in revenue by 2025. That's a 20%+ CAGR."
Nice price movement today. Get ready to see 20+
MNDT should be acquired by the likes of Deloitte or Accenture as it is now consulting pureplay. That should give some respite to the shareholders!
"The new Mandiant will now focus on its cyber digital forencis and its incident response arm. This format will have less debt on its balance sheet. In this past second quarter Mandiant Consulting Services grew 26%, while the overall Mandiant Solution's billings surged 44%."
"deal will close faster than previously thought, meaning $500 million spent faster on stock buyback, easily over $50 in a month"
"On oct 4th will anyone owning FEYE stock be automatically moved to owning the Mandiant stock, anyone happen to know?"
"""Mandian Threat Intelligence Unit"" getting some air time on CNBC today but I wonder how many people connect the dots to FEYE? I bet not many... I sold some other stuff to buy more FEYE today, I got conviction but I am impatient concerning this break-up. After the break-up I feel like I will be able to breathe so to speak. I got a lots of chips placed here now."
"T-mobile partners with Cybersecurity experts at Mandiant, KPMG after hack.."
"Go Firefly Go. As PANW goes past $500 intraday, Firefly aims at a new all time low."
Very cheap cybersecurity stock.....worth to buy....will shoot up $50-$72 range
"only way out with cash and a ceo like current one ,!!!!sell out with M&A deal"
"2.2 million dollars of insider buying in the past 3 months , interesting......."
Isnâ€™t this supposed to be going up in price or is that just for all other cybr companies?
"I just watched George Kurtz, CEO of Crowdstrike being interviewed on MSNBC. If you really want to shake your head, compare his total compensation package of less than 1.5 million against Kevin Mandia's $7 million package for 2020. Then look at the stock performance of these two stocks the past 2 years. Shameful that FEYE compensates their CEO so highly despite the stock's performance."
This is down about 20% ytd while sector leaders like PANW are more than doubling. Still looks like ol Firefly to me!
"Cybersecurity company FireEye Inc. FEYE, +0.45% said Monday it will officially change its name to Mandiant Inc. and trade under the new ticker symbol 'MNDT' from Tuesday. The decision to rename itself reflects ""the company's strategy to focus on Mandiant's security controls-agnostic solutions delivered through the Mandiant Advantage cloud-based platform."" As part of that strategy, the company agreed in June to sell its FireEye Products business, including the FireEye name, to a consortium led by Symphony Technology Group."
"We need some PR and CNBC pumping to move this stock. With Mandiant stand-alone business, the analysts would definitely raise the price target."
I hope we see a well deserved 35+ this week with the news.
The share price should double from here if Management Plays it right .
"lots of cash coming to a reduced size company, and a pure play cyber security, plus a $500 dollar buy back,do you really think the stock will stay under $40 very long, or simply a m&a deal over $50"
"Kevin Mandia interviewed on CNBC stated that MNDT is breaching the gap in cyber security, there have been recent increases in zero day cyberattacks happening now. They are agnostic and can work now with any cyber companies. November 4 next earnings announcement."
The number of data breaches in 2021 have already surpassed 2020. Should be a huge opportunity for MNDT's premier Incident Response capability.
Good news putting FEYE behind us .. what a waste of time and money spent trying to salvage that company.
Finally it's about to go down. Been patiently waiting for a while. This is the bottom. Time for Mandiant to shine again. No better Incident Response and Threat Intelligence in the market!
"I researched and it's not clear if Fireeye is completely owned - soon - by STG. Also Mandiant doesn't have a ticker. It falls under (FEYE).Then there's the buyback. Wonder if they'll pull the RKT disappearing no buyback.Aside from that appears Fireeye will step into the background as STG take forefront. Love to hear intelligent replies on what's going on. Why? I'm?ready to buy 10,000 shares if I can get some feedback on protocol."
"Same ol Firefly. Going to the moon, if its buried in the Marianna Trench!"
Mndt partnering with Splunk.
Loaded up on FEYE. Mandiant is really cool.
"This is just one of those stocks that is tough to hold. It will pay off IMO but the way it trades allows one to average down for what feels like forever... I've shot all my bullets so to speak and am ready for the conversion from FEYE to Mandiant. Can't come soon enough for me, just venting... GL longs."
"Although initially disappointed, I think the transition to cloud and services is positive for MNDT going forward. The management was unable to utilize its legacy products and all original stakeholders are now gone."
"With the sell of Feye Mndt gets rid of 637,669 of liabilities and $500,000 of assets. This should give them 2billion in cash and debt of 412,331 million. With partnerships of Microsoft and Splunk we shall see big increase in sales and of course our local and unlocal hackers are marketing the product as well. Our long suffering wait should pay off."
"Kevin Mandia has an abundance of experience in cybersecurity around the world. He was made CEO of the combined company with FireEye. His company had strong fundamentals. FireEye was a work in progress. His years as CEO could not make the combination work. Could anyone? History shows that FireEye loses was an anchor while Mandia was making progress. Mandia is showing a strong increase in revenue. Without FireEye I believe Mandiant with its quality technology will have a fast accent. Despite the past, I am not selling now."
"FEYE reaches $30 very quickly ,watch the $500 million in cash with the buyback"
Seems like we had this same pattern before the last earnings. Down a little most every day and then bad news and it tanked.
Mandia will probably say he needs another yr or two to turn this loser around at earnings. He has already had 7. Should have been fired long ago!
When Susquehanna International closes their short this should really start to climb.
