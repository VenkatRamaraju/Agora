"Here we go, FEYE has just broken down to a brand new LOD. Patience paying off on this one.... A bearish article from Barron's published about an hour ago seems to be putting more pressure on the stock...."
msft buyout still possible?
"don't forget these characters are going to get $1.5billion cash for buybacks and developing cyber security,probably a m&a deal likely easily a $45 dollar even a knuckle head like this ceo will double the stock $$price"
"FEYE delivered a terrible earnings report with extreme uncertainty going forward. And she was already highly over-valued at the $20 closing level. I am overjoyed to be Short a lot of shares at $20.08 as a Pure Earnings Short Sell play. Question is, how low does she go today? What is a reasonable Cover price to aim for? I think this will not even touch $18.00 all day long. I am looking for a regular session open at the $17.50 level, with an early drop to under $17, likely followed by stabilization as a few bargain hunters come in...But then a likely slow sell-off to continue later in the day. Gonna run with an initial $16.01 Buy Cover in an attempt to maximize profit, before I move on a DISH Short Sell before market close today."

"OMG if that Kevin Mandia interview with Cramer didn't scare the Living Daylights out of you, I don't know what will.Mandia: Building software is a lot more complex than people realize...more complex than building a bridge...with software you have no idea how people intend to use it. Software works and integrates with other software to be - really - just usable. And because of that, you just introduce vulnerabilities......we're just playing defense in cyberspace right now as a nation. We are giving offense the opportunity to hack us with no risks or repercussions, Jim. So when you're playing goalie, the puck's gonna get in the net from time to time.Cramer: Has anyone from the new Administration called you about what happened with Solar Winds?Mandia: Absolutely - we've talked to the government routinely. And what you can can feel - the line of toleration has been surpassed..we've got Solar Winds, we've got the Accellion breach that was also unfortunate - and by the way it's not the fault of these companies - they're doing their best. But with no risks or repercussions to the threat actors, we're kind of like a tackling dummy getting hit over and over again. This Administration - I can tell we've kind of crossed the line of tolerance. Were going to make improvements to the federal government security into the nations security.Cramer: Well we've known your company for a long time so we know you're hands on. So what happened? Someone comes to you and says 'listen we've got a real problem.' And you start looking at it and realize how huge it is and you blow the whistle. I mean - what happens? Gme the sequence of what happens at FireEye.Mandia: I was just getting a Friday afternoon security update from our security leader...and we had a small incident-somebody logging in to our network successfully but it wasn't one of our people. They were using one of our accounts. The thing is - from 1996 to 1999 - somewhere in that time frame - I think I responded to the exact intruder that we were dealing with - a foreign intelligence sevice from Russia. We recognized the TTPs and even though it was a tiny wisp of smoke, we kind of went right from there to 'Call a board meeting, 'This is the one we're worried about' and we are built to do investigations, Jim - that's what we doSo it's kind of like a fireman responding to a fire in their own house - they know how to put it out. So we - we just mobilized - we just said it's time to go -let's do forensics on every machine at FireEye and when we were done we still didn't know how they broke into FireEye. So what we did is we looked at the earliest evidence of compromise it was our Solar Winds server We said there's got to be some thing wrong with it so rip it apart, de-compile it, and that's how we found it We exhausted every investigative lead before We finally said there's got to be something wrong with software you trust. So let's tear it apart and find the problem.[end of my included interview excerpt with Cramer and FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia]This is war. Plain and simple. And it's been going on for decades.G / L everyone."

SYMC beat earnings and revenue. FEYE could knock us out of the park on Tuesday with their new cloud email and other services. I’m not sure why the analysts think they will make less in Q4 than Q3. It makes no sense. They are gaining momentum. I’m thinking .08 cents and as long as they beat revenue we should be back in the 20s soon
Facebook looking to buy major cybersecurity company. wonder which one
bizarre action there
"lots of cash coming to a reduced size company, and a pure play cyber security, plus a $500 dollar buy back,do you really think the stock will stay under $40 very long, or simply a m&a deal over $50"
"$500 million going to buy back shares in this Cybersecurity company that ranks #1 in the field, just shares and put away , under $30 a steal"
"Private equity firm Blackstone and San Francisco venture capital firm ClearSky are buying $400 million in FireEye convertible preferred stock for $1,000 a share. The preferred stock will be convertible into FireEye’s common stock at $18 per share, the price it flirted with after the deal was announced."
"About 200 US businesses have been hit by a ""colossal"" ransomware attack, according to a cyber-security firm.Friday afternoon, just as people were going off for the July 4 weekend..."
"Again, I am confident stock will see $20 this year and become a real acquisition target with $30 a minimum."
They been outperforming quaterly estimates they on the bounce back it seems
"Just speculating but it really does look like they're setting themselves up for a buyout in the future. SPLUNK just beefed up their security with one. With soo many BIG cloud companies, I wouldn't be surprised if others follow the same path."
"the last month chart is a ragged cup and handle, and today is nice confirmation of it . It has put in a lot of work down here and back to $30 could come fast-"
"FEYE reaches $30 very quickly ,watch the $500 million in cash with the buyback"
"Pattern beginning to formalize. Typically, Feye, begins to rise going into earnings, about a month before. $18 to $19 leading up to what I feel will be positive earnings."
"If you are honest about what has transpired here it's simple. FireEye a failing company bought ""Mandiant"" a successful start up and put Mandiant CEO in charge of the entire enterprise. The CEO cashed in on his company and then unsuccessfully tried to turn FEYE around. Now he's selling off the company that bought his company and is essentially back to square one. Wasted time, energy and money .. I'm frustrated and so is Wall Street technically the chart is broken and unless there is some news to turn it around the stock will be at 14 by eoy."
Goldman Sachs analyst Brian Essex upgraded FireEye to a buy from neutral with a price target of $18 given the stock’s outsized pullback relative to its peers and expectations for revenue to “reaccelerate.”
Too much attention on FEYE for much of a pullback. Cyber security is red hot and will continue. FEYE will keep climbing along with their revenue or they will get bought before reaching their potential. Either way good for longs>
Looking to at a position right now. Thoughts on what will move this stock in the next year?
"I understand that Palantir is kicking the tires on this one, anyone else hear this."
One last word. Mandia has been ceo since 2015. 6 yrs and he can’t turn it around!! And now they will name the company after him? I guess if you could fool the people to vote for the current president then you can think mandia is doing a good job.
Feye is being setup for a merger. Mark my word. $25 in sight.
you should have bought CWRD instead
And here comes 18 !!! Cheers !!!!!

"Been a long time on news from FE. Hopefully, earnings will show some positive developments on all the new clients they have supposedly signed up."
I work in cybersecurity and can tell you everybody is buying FireEye HX. Couple their products with their services and this is a great mid to long term play.
"On December 8, 2020, concurrently with the filing of this Current Report on Form 8-K, FireEye, Inc. (""FireEye"", “we”, “our” or “us”) is announcing on our corporate blog that FireEye recently was attacked by a highly sophisticated cyber threat actor, one whose discipline, operational security, and techniques lead us to believe it was a state-sponsored attack. Based on his 25 years in cyber security and responding to incidents, Kevin Mandia, our Chief Executive Officer, concluded we are witnessing an attack by a nation with top-tier offensive capabilities. This attack is different from the tens of thousands of incidents we have responded to throughout the years. The attackers tailored their world-class capabilities specifically to target and attack FireEye. They are highly trained in operational security and executed with discipline and focus. They operated clandestinely, using methods that counter security tools and forensic examination. They used a novel combination of techniques not witnessed by us or our partners in the past. We are actively investigating in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other key partners, including Microsoft. Their initial analysis supports our conclusion that this was the work of a highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques."
Once a joke- always a joke. Wrong management team - wrong structure- the street despises this company- a 3rd grader can see that at this point. Only option is a sale but who wants it and more importantly who is willing to pay a massive premium?? Answer… NOONE! Good job messing up what was once the darling of the cyber space
Seeking Alpha :FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) has jumped 5% amid chatter that Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) could make an offer for the cybersecurity company.A number of rumors suggest Cisco will engage with Goldman Sachs on a deal for FireEye.
Are they doing that big buyback anytime soon?
"Internet traffic is up 900 %, FEYE can only benefit. Glad to have opened up a position and still buying on dips."
As I earlier posted FireEye’s market cap as compared to sales is by far the best value in this space. PANW had $550 Million in quarterly revenues and has a $18 Billion Market Cap. That means they are valued more than double FEYE. ZS which reported this week had $49 Million in revenue (1/4 of FEYE) but has a Market Cap of $4.6 Billion more than 25% larger than FEYE. Another example is Fortinet (FTNT) With sales roughly double FEYE it has a market cap almost quadruple ($11B vs. $3 B).Eventually these things will even out. FEYE longs are in a good position based on market valuation. Very little downside and lots of room to the upside.
Saw update on Respond purchases. Since this new addition to Feye ‘s platform offers quick detection of whether a hack is a real threat it assist the cybersecurity experts to quickly detect and move on. This should speed up their process and be appealing to all cyber companies. Their growth rate will start to increase by second half of year this should be a $30.00 stock once short sellers move on a good squeeze would be motivational.
See recent filings more insider buying of fire eye. This is first time since going public that there has been several insiders buying a large number of shares.
They never answer any shareholders questions. Dose anyone works in the office or just taking a salary from shareholders money.

"with $1.5 billion in cash,no debt, and Cyber Security solutions ,give me a break .straight to $55 or a sell out ,hopefully one of the giants better than cash. Buying every day"
someone help me understand. been in this for about 6 years. the fireye product being sold for 1.1 billion. i read that its 2/3rds of current revenue on a market cap of 5 billion. Is it me or does the sale price of this segment seem extremely low???? I was finally relieved to see this moving in the right direction and completely threw me off with the sale announcement.
"Insider buying is always a vote of confidence. The Executive VP & Chief Revenue Officer, William Robbins, recently paid US$16.92 per share to buy US$440k worth of the stock. That's a very decent purchase and it grew their holding by a solid 13%."
"Its always funny to read some of the posts here. Apparently some of you will be ""loading up"" at 12 and 13. I'm curious to know what supports this stock finding that price point. A lot has happened over the past year and the low is right around low 14s. I bought in a bit early at very low 15s and feel this dip will be temporary. Look at the chart -- we are oversold right now by all measures. Can it go down more? Sure. At the same time, high institutional investor percentage and low shorts. On the flip side, I see predictions of 20. Again... why? This stock seems to travel comfortably between 14s to 17s, which is why I'm fine holding it with a buy price of 15.06. The only thing that does concern me here is the talk of endless dilution of the stock. If that is accurate, that can lead to a continuing drop in price. Might be worth a phone call to their IR department to get the scoop. Good luck to those holding. I doubt we will be here for very long (on a technical basis)."

"William Turton and Kartikay Mehrotra - Tue, December 15, 2020, 5:18 PM CST (Bloomberg) -- When FireEye Inc. discovered that it was hacked this month, the cybersecurity firm’s investigators immediately set about trying to figure out how attackers got past its defenses.It wasn’t just FireEye that got attacked, they quickly found out. Investigators discovered a vulnerability in a product made by one of its software providers, Texas-based SolarWinds Corp.“We looked through 50,000 lines of source code, which we were able to determine there was a backdoor within SolarWinds,” said Charles Carmakal, senior vice president and chief technical officer at Mandiant, FireEye’s incident response arm. After discovering the backdoor, FireEye contacted SolarWinds and law enforcement, Carmakal said.Hackers, suspected to be part of an elite Russian group, took advantage of the vulnerability to implant malware, which then found its way into the systems of SolarWinds customers when they updated their software. So far, more than 25 entities have been victimized by the attack, according to people familiar with the investigations. But SolarWinds says as many as 18,000 entities may have downloaded the malicious TrojanThe hackers who attacked FireEye stole sensitive tools that the company uses to find vulnerabilities in clients’ computer networks. While the hack on FireEye was embarrassing for a cybersecurity firm, Carmakal argued that it may prove to be a crucial mistake for the hackers.“If this actor didn’t hit FireEye, there is a chance that this campaign could have gone on for much, much longer,” Carmakal said. “One silver lining is that we learned so much about how this threat actor works and shared it with our law enforcement, intelligence community and security partners.” Carmakal said there is no evidence FireEye’s stolen hacking tools were used against U.S. government agencies."
WSJ -Dec. 29 -- FireEye specializes in hack investigations. FireEye is often the first call from other companies who suffer from being hacked. FireEye is one of the cheapest pure-play cybersecurity companies. Its price is trading at only 5.4 times forward sales. Higher priced Palo Alto Networks and Check Point Networks are trading at 9.0 times forward sales.
Looks like nothing is happening today! Give us some action.
I have shares however I would like to see a pullback so I can pick up more shares. FEYE IMHO is undervalued and will do well.

this rally is amazing however no real news. anyone seeing anything out there regarding possible acquisition/merger? hate to speculate but only thing that makes sense. living the run for sure.
"Being the only company with expertise ( per Mandia ) and solicited by companies and government to solve the cyber crime, this company is the lowest price per share than all of the IT players and gets no respect. I think all this PR and, media pumping, Mandia at all, is part of the Comedy Central or Saturday Night Live from DC and we don't know it. In the end they will said "" common guy we were just joking "" can't you take a joke."
"Not nervous at all. Feye will beat top and bottom estimates. The only question is by how much. Then comes the spin.... or as some will call it ""the earnings conference call"" and here it's time to shine. Looking forward to growth and prosperity for Feye and us shareholders."
Bouncy bouncy! But not very high....
I just don't see how this should be any sort of surprise to anyone. There's no way they can posibly make money till the deal closes which is the one thing I don't understand why it had to drag out so long. Sticking with it unless the CC is a complete disaster.
"With all the recent cyber attacks, this company is in great position for growth! Solid growth and balance sheet and valuation is much cheaper than peers. If a buyout occurred, it would need to be a massive premium. Be patient. This will be inching towards the $20s!"

"Just opened a position. FEYE is no more. Soon this will be Mandiant stock, an already extremely profitable company without all of FEYE's debt holding it down. The valuation should be completely different, revealing, imo, a very undervalued money making top tier cyber security company."

"Several people have commented on FEYE’s being undervalued. Yes it is. Just to recap FireEye opened trading in September 2013 at $20 and closed its first day at $36. Shares stayed around $40 through late 2013. The early January 2014 announcement of a $1 billion merger with privately held security software firm Mandiant was well received, and FEYE stock shot as high as $86 by February. It came down because of missteps and because it wasn’t becoming profitable. But now it is. Good times ahead."

"Russia-Linked SolarWinds Hack Ensnares Widening List of Victims -Michael Riley, Kartikay Mehrotra and William TurtonThu, December 17, 2020, 10:21 PM CST...The Russian attack was uncovered this month after cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc. discovered that its computers had been rifled. Microsoft executives said Thursday that a number of cybersecurity companies were among those hacked. That matches a government assessment that such firms were high on the alleged Russia hackers’ priority list, according to a person familiar with the inquiry. The U.S. is examining the possibility that the hackers were hoping to use their access inside cybersecurity firms to pull off operations similar to SolarWinds -- that is, adding manipulated code to the updates those companies regularly send to clients, according to a person familiar with the government’s investigation. Those probes are in early stages, however, and it’s unclear whether the hackers were successful in any of the cases."
Steven buy some more. 16.60 15.70. now 15.20
"FEYE is a buy, Yeah I'm pumping. 3 months from now, you'll be happy. Thundersnow says so..."
Earnings call is a positive alternate reality to announcement.
"Remember, buying FEYE now is for the much more profitable, much less debt, Mandiant. The current FEYE valuation on this stock is no longer relevant. New valuation for Mandiant will be completely different and reveal this to be highly undervalued. Currently trading at a big discount considering this will soon become Mandiant and have nothing to do with FEYE."
This strange gut feeling that today we fill the gap to $19.5-$20 irrespective of QQQ’s direction
FireEye converting to Mandiant with its cloud and consulting business is the right move. Cloud subscriptions yield exceptionally high yields. Cybersecurity management is estimated to be a $65 billion business by 2023.
"FEYE is acting exactly as I anticipated. Barely touched $18, only to drop on a wave of selling pressure. Will not be able to gain any forward momentum today, not after that terrible ER, + huge uncertainty going forward, + analyst downgrades, + it is Friday. I see a much greater chance FEYE drops below $17, rather than getting above $18, as her next move, even though she is already down a lot and is above $17.50 right now... Patience to the Short side is a virtue here...."
"Nobody wants to buy this today, tons of selling pressure pushing her down... Facts are facts, just look at the L2 action..."
FireEye converting to Mandiant with its cloud and consulting business will be very profitable. Cloud subscriptions yield exceptionally high yields. Cyber security management is estimated to be a $65 billion business by 2023
FEYE is the first cyber security to call when companies are in real trouble - share price should be at least $40 - very surprised it has not been bought out - premium name.

Dave is correct. FEYE offers tripwire technology and service that the competion has yet to match.
Don't waste your money on this stock. I was a bag holder with this stock for over 5 years. Lousy management and a clueless CEO runs this company. I sold all my shares 2 months ago and never looked back...

"I wonder how the share price would react next quarter if our CEO took a page out of Goldman Sachs playbook?Goldman Sachs cut its benefits and compensation this past quarter. Here are the basics: The bank cut compensation and benefits set aside for employees in the first quarter by 20% to $3.26 billion, outstripping the decline in companywide revenue. Goldman posted first-quarter revenue that missed analysts’ expectations, dropping 13% to $8.81 billion amid a tougher market for trading and investing. The drop in pay helped the bank BEAT analysts’ expectations for profit, however.Could FEYE consider focusing on the shareholders this year? Not likely... just dreaming."
FireEye is up 6.59% to 17.78
This is going to $28+ easily. It was a good week but still this should be up to the $21 - $23 by now.
"FEYE willcontinue straight up until a M&A deal near $50, best in class CYBER TECHNOLGY"
"The security software firm is well armed to make this transition. It ended June with $1.25 billion in cash and short-term investments and only $440 million in short-term convertible debt. The stock is likely to remain volatile for now until FireEye's financials stabilize, but the sale of its products division bodes well for its growth trajectory. Shares have declined 27% so far this year after the post-earnings plunge. If FireEye can demonstrate consistently higher growth and work its way back to profitability, this short-term tumble could present a long-term value since FireEye is actually profitable on a free cash flow basis ($30.8 million generated in the quarter)."
"With all the PR and the resurgence of IT piracy this stock should be in the $ 300 range easy but it will not happen due to the mismanagement, personal agendas and bad BOD. I heard all kind of great stories for 7 years and no positive results. I is too tempting for shorts due to lo price per share."
"Longtimers... doesn't BlackStone have 2 BOD seats & $400mm in preferreds that are convertible to common @ $17.25? They were clearly involved in guiding this deal & must be convinced their share interest will greatly benefit. May take time , but I doubt they'd be content with even 100% ROI & probably expect multiple of that. Won't all the balance sheet cash now available to Mandiant allow it to build out & refine it's services business ? If that's case doesn't Mandiant become an intriguing bolt on acquisition for larger player? I see Blackstone/Mandia dressing up a more security service focused business for premium sale going forward . Hardware/product side previously prevented that strategic move. Stock in $18s here appears to discount quite a bit of risk that they fail to drive forward results sufficiently in a very bullish macro environment enough to generate strategic buy interest. Think last night's move was only step 1 in a multi faceted strategic process leading to a liquidity event."
"ceo simply has to be fired,directors should remember they have a fiduciary"
"1) For the people who are confused by the headlines, and don't read the content - It was NOT FEYE that infected their clients. They're the ones that exposed the hack after they had been hacked. Solarwinds screwed up big time by letting Cozy Bear introduce a trojanized Solarwinds update as a legit update, which most of their clients installed. Solarwinds is the one that should have gone a lot lower than 16% today. 2) Only reason I was thinking of buying FEYE today is because at the moment, they're the company with the best intel into this security risk. Even CISA's alert today included the link to the FIREEYE website as reference. Solarwinds just said to install the HF1 patch, and wait for the HF2 patch on Tuesday. No other information on what may have been compromised. Granted FEYE got hacked, but another way to see this is that they're the ones that caught and exposed it... No other cyber security company did... they probably learnt a lot more in the process... And I'm sure they got quite a few contracts from other companies that got hacked. Also - Just because Feye reported the hack, doesn't mean other cyber-security companies didn't get hacked... Bottom line - All I know - If CISA is pointing to FEYE for guidance and many of the parties affected are govt ones, they'll make a killing in breach management, and security assessments. I could be very wrong... but to me they're the Pfizer of this cyberpandemic..."
"Today started with 400 shares of FireEye, after some research I became enthusiastic about this company:Social importance:There is certainly demand for this company,The digital transformation in our society is leading to exponentially more data that is generated and shared. This makes us sensitive to threats in the business and social ecosystem.Revenue company:- Turnover increases with the years. Through more contracts and income.- Still not profitable through growth and development. Still, debts are declining.Rating:Buy and hold. (yahoo finance).Stock market:-90% Institutional investors (these funds do not invest without research, good measurement)-Volume is increasing.Company:many and good customers.expected growth return 2021 is 5% according to the presentation of February 2.I participate! see you again in a year when the amount has doubled! Bullish! (Google Translate Dutch- English)."
Just bought for the very first time. Thank you Vova (that's Vladimir Putin to y'll) for the buying opportunity!
I thought 17.50 was the bottom considering where it was. Boy was I wrong.
"Kaseya want Feye to help and the stock gets an amazing .84 cents increase but Palo Alto Networks stock up 15 dollars, go figure"
Great time to buy before earnings. Will be going higher. Their change that they did before to a more subscription based recurring revenue model will produce a great earnings report. Also a ton of call options have and are being bought. (And always the outside possibility that another company will buy FEYE)
This stock shouldn't be slowing down
FireEye is on acquisition target by big cyber security company after their acquisition of threat analysis software. This helps them to attract more customers with competitive price to evaluate the incidents they are facing. Banks spends billions of $$$ to analyze cyber incidents.
"simply BUY all you can and put away, maybe trade a few at $55 or wait for a take out. this CEO has been waiting a long time for this $1.5 billion cash in Cyber Security ,so grow the company or sell we shareholders will make a ton"
While you waited for the buyout PANW is near 500 bucks! 5xer in a few years
"My sympathy to current shareholders. I owned shares in this company from Dec 2015 to Dec 2020. I sold as soon as I could break even, but ended up with a small profit after tying up my funds for 5 years. As others have stated, management seems to have no idea on how to generate a profit in this high demand environement for cyber security companies. Too bad !"
No growth in a growth industry. Toast.
FINALLY!https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/technology/fireeye-facebook-disinformation.html
"After working with their advisors, they came to the realization that there was not one natural buyer for the entire company given the disparate businesses and declining legacy business. They were most likely advised to split the companies up, so they can generate more shareholder value over time by selling them separately. My guess is that they already have another company in mind to acquire, which they will fund with the proceeds from the sale, continue to build this business and sell at a higher multiple to those buyers who want this business but did not want legacy business. It is a known fact that suitors have been looking at this for years and it was the legacy business that kept them away."
"I guess you can sell the name of the horse but its still a dead horse? Disappointing to say the least, prob wish they had saved some powder for the buyback now. No excuses really for this report."
long time shareholder when cyber was a big deal...went with this over fortinet what a mistake...never sold any....wish we could end our misery of this clunker..hoping with all the hype recently on security some larger comp buys and this company fades away into oblivion
"5,000 shares long since 2014 at an average of $28 so to say the least I could use a little love tomorrow with positive earnings and guidance. Profitability would be a nice surprise. GL"
something is wrong with my monitor. Next to the symbol FEYE are some green numbers? What are those?
"I've not been in this stock, but cyber security is huge. does FEYE know what they're doing?"
I’ll wait for Mandiant ticker.
Take a look at what happened after the big red volume day of June 3rd. Immediately bounced back and rallied hard on the next market day. Analysts are telling you they’re unsure of future prospects but I guarantee you their employers like Morgan Stanley are the ones buying this gap down like crazy today from all the dummies who had their stop losses take them out. 1.2 billion dollars for a name and some bad portions of the business is going to set up for either 2.4 billion cash hoard to seek massive growth or pay off all debt. Either way this stock will go double soon enough.
"Company has underperformed estimates every quarter for the past five years. If they couldn't post a single profitable quarter during the boom in cybersecurity services, while their reputation was still semi-intact, how are they going to turn a GAAP profit now, with this failure hanging around their neck?"
We have to look at where this company is going and they are focusing on a SaaS based solution much like Crowdstrike . They are realizing cyber threats have to be dealt with in real time . Also you need a cloud based software so updates can run seamlessly without shutting down. FireEye got hacked by “darkside” in the solar winds hack the same as colonial pipeline and I’m going to assume JBS foods . This means FireEye has data on how these hackers function and have dealt with the government . FireEye also worked on the colonial pipeline case . I won’t be surprised if FireEye signs some contracts soon or well Mandiant we call them now . They have money for growth and buybacks now. Deposing on the amount of buybacks will give us somewhat of an idea how undervalued they think the stock is . New insider buying was already a good sign of this .
"In direct response to yesterday's ER, Five star analyst from Baird downgraded FEYE to a Hold with a $20.00 12 months out price target. Not gonna help this stuck piggy to move up today...."
"""Mandian Threat Intelligence Unit"" getting some air time on CNBC today but I wonder how many people connect the dots to FEYE? I bet not many... I sold some other stuff to buy more FEYE today, I got conviction but I am impatient concerning this break-up. After the break-up I feel like I will be able to breathe so to speak. I got a lots of chips placed here now."
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SHAP
Bought back my September $20 puts about 30 mins before close. Sure glad I did. Yikes. I'll take my small profit and find some other sandbox to play in.
"Panic sellers lost 4 points on this one a few days ago when it went South after it falsely went down after the company sold it's hardware business, then a Director steps up and buys this disappointing stock at the low 18 + and buys it with conviction. Lowell and behold it does a turn around trying to get to pre buyout prices. Corruption at its finest? Im keeping mine as this will be making annual highs shortly because that makes more sense than when it went South. Longs we're fighting the battle and we will eventually win the war. Stay long and more importantly stay well."
They hired Erin Joe from FBI and nothing happened. This company can hire God and still a loser for investors and milking cow for the upper management and BOD. SEC needs to take a closer look to this company.
"All that noise after the close was on low volume with a lot of retail exuberance. I don't believe anyone knows where this is going included those most closely involved in the negotiation to sell. This is risky long,short or sideways IMHO."
"This vehicle is stuck in reverse. The most outrageous PR and masters manipulators kipping many investors with hope and promises. They got connection in media as they pump them regardless of performance. I am hopeful every announcement of best company, many rewards, managers rewarded and praised. Best tools in the business etc. then I look at the other IT companies and a feeling of something is fishy shattered my hopes of the stock to move up after 7 years faithfull. I gess live and learn and the I ask myself why is nobody in the regulatory and government oversites are not checking this company to see the level of kosher if any."
"So they couldn’t stop the hack, but now the market thinks they can fix it, okey dokey I’ll roll with it I’m long now"
"Market seems undecided; products made up 2/3 of revenue. Management has some 'splaining to do so shareholders understand how this benefits us? $500M share buyback fine, what's the plan for OUR other $700M?"
"Big boost in FEYE revenues will be driven mostly by their incident response professional services. However, their business model like most other PS teams, does not recognize revenue until the end of the engagement. The timing of the attack (mid December) will not allow FEYE to recognize any of the revenue boost in the past quarter. They might meet targets but the outlook for the next quarter will definitely get a pump. Hoping the e/r and high targets for next quarter drives this stock to $30! Good luck all! Riding $25.5 out of the money calls for 2/5"
good chance this hits $40 sometime within the next 12 months.
"A $500 million buyback could start anytime,I just keep averaging down, no problem at all, only goes in one direction"
Best looking stock chart in the market .. could make a run to 35 if it ever closes over 21.
They need growth with PANW having minus earnings at + 200 they have growth.
"a deal has asset value even without closing, perhaps modest but still lendable"
"2.2 million dollars of insider buying in the past 3 months , interesting......."
Once again rejected at $18.3... need more volume to break through the resistance.
$20 end of week anyone?
FEYE was downgraded Friday and the chart just made a death cross.
"About time I am waiting over 3 years already ,hopefully it’s going up then I am out."
Holding strong today is a great sign
I was excited for a few minutes after the deal was announced until I saw some of the trading action and realized the 7.7% short position was gonna have their way with FEYE before things get sorted out. What a frustrating & disappointing experience. Not that many of us longer-term bulls are used to much anything else. It's not over til it's over and today should be a wild ride as they can pretty much do what they will with it. Just look at the post-marker yesterday for a taste of what today will be like. Who among us can really determine what our shares are actually worth now. I am open to any cogent explanations.
"$1.5 billion in cash, CyberSecurity, and a creative CEO this stock has one direction and fast $55 or a m& a deal"
"Looks like your technical charts are about to be adjusted upwards, BabyJocko, and your earlier arrogantly stayed predictions proven wrong:FireEye call volume above normal and directionally bullish — 1:05 PM ET 01/18/2019Bullish option flow detected in FireEye with 9,642 calls trading, 3x expected, and implied vol increasing over 1 point to 54.59%. 1/25 weekly 16 calls and 1/25 weekly 16.5 calls are the most active options, with total volume in those strikes near 5,500 contracts. The Put/Call Ratio is 0.17. Earnings are expected on February 6th."
Over reaction. Will be back to $20 in no time.
"All I could say is wow, I never thought I would be starting in at these levels. Will add everyday we get a big market drop"
"In Feb 2016 the high almost touched $14 and the low was a bit under $12. 53 months later, same, and that is a trading range if there ever was one. Stocks down that long from $98 a few years earlier never get our of the ditch and roaring back. A buyout is still the best hope here."
"does the sale of FireEye have to be voted on by the shareholders? STG wants to close the deal by October, but I haven't seen any communication about a vote."
"Kevin Mandia on the breach:I've been in cybersecurity for 25 years. And for all those years, we're constantly being attacked all the time, from groups out of Iran, out of China, out of a bunch of different locations. What happened recently and what made us proactively disclose is different, because of who did it, what they did and, quite frankly, how they did it.But what they did was, somebody broke into our network in ways and means that we intend to share and we're working hard on that ongoing investigation. And we had to do something that I don't usually advise our customers, is that during an ongoing investigation we chose to come out, right, in the middle of the investigation and say, we know we lost our red team tools and we don't want to be responsible for anybody being in harm's way based on our red team tools.And for those folks that are unfamiliar with red team tools, this is stuff that we've done. When I was in the military in the '90s, we always thought about blue teams and red teams. Red team is offense, blue team is defense and you do drills, live fire drills, as we call it, to make sure you're better.So we have a whole bunch of red team tools that allow us to emulate threat groups from around the world, period. So our customers get genuine feedback how good is our security. Well, a lot of our tools were publicly available, but a lot weren't. And for the ones that weren't publicly available, what I decided to do and what we as a company felt was the most responsible thing to do, is make sure that they don't work anywhere.And these are tools that are primarily, quite frankly, as we respond to breaches, we're responding to other nations red teams, people that do offense. And we're taking their tools and we'd study them and say ""hey listen, if they just did it this way, our forensics may not have found it as easily.""So we adopted a lot of things. And this is no different than other industries. Like, for example, if you're in the virus industry, you're trying to think what is the next strain of flu going to look like. We've always done it for malware and we've always had an innovation cycle of making sure our products could detect what's happening today and in many ways detect tomorrow, because we'd adjust these tools.We haven't seen those tools being used by anybody. We believe that the threat group that took them may not dump them. We don't know if they'll even use them. But what we did is, we went public and told the world here's how you stop our red team tools, so that if, by chance, they leak out in some way, they are tools that would take an average person to make them above average and we don't want that to happen.I'm very thankful to other security vendors that have worked with us to do, what I call, shields up, to make sure our tools will not be that effective or effective at all. And then, of course, our products can detect them as well. But this is, by the way, again, a shared thing.Every company when targeted by a modern nation with resources and money, usually nation beats company when it comes from offense to defense, the asymmetry is there and I think we did go up against the nation with the time, the effort, skills, and capabilities that over time the bullet was going to hit the mark. We're going to do everything we can and operate on the principles of integrity and that everybody gets more secure from what happens to us.And I'll leave you with this thought Saket that's no different than our normal innovation cycle. We're going to respond to over 1000 breaches this year. FireEye tends -- is going to be one of them. But we got to take what we learned from all those breaches, plug them into our products, and plug them into other people's products to make sure all of us raise the tide and raise the cost for the folks that are breaking into our networks and invading our privacy.So, again, a proactive disclosure. Who did it is different than the norm, how they did it is different than the norm, what they did is different than the norm just because we happen to do these red teaming exercises and they took those tools. But we're still in the middle of this. We're still in an ongoing investigation, but we're helping our customers and other vendors to react to this."
It is not good if anyone is banking on a buyout
"Only way I can figure this sale is that it amounts to another cash infusion. They just raised a billion dollars selling stock to a private equity firm and now they need another billion to remain afloat. Shareholders get nothing for the sale of FireEye. The pitch is that separating the companies will benefit sales for both, since there will be no conflict of interest between services and sales. This argument was true 8 years ago when FireEye (Dave Dewalt, corp. raider) overpaid for Mandiant in the first place. Mismanagement goes way back and continues. At least the FireEye products will cease to be a cash cow supporting the Mandiant services group, which has been siphoning money away from R&D on the products side. We will see if the Mandiant ""baby"" has been bottle fed long enough to survive and grow, following this additional 1 billion dollar milk bottle... I have my doubts, though."
2nd quarter results should be interesting. Mandia needs to get this puppy up. Languishing is not a good business model.
"Would you look at that, FEYE finally broke down to another new LOD. Few more dollars in paper profit right now, very soon to be converted into MANY thousands of dollars of real profit. :-)"
bought 10000 today we will be $20 soon...
Next target is 15.Unusual activity in $FEYE calls should also be mentioned on CNBC later on.
https://www.itwire.com/security/is-fireeye-geting-ready-to-put-mandiant-on-the-block.html
Long since 2014 with an average of $28. I can honestly say that I’m actually becoming optimistic that this will wind up being a profitable investment. GL
"massive option volume spike on 20.5, 21 and 21.50 in the last 30 mins expiring tomorrow.Headfake or something up?"
"Imagine QQQ was green today, we could have seen at least 5%. Still outperforming the sector, I can see $19.5-$20 by the end of the week. Sellers have dried up."
"MSFT announced that their 40+ customers got hit across multiple countries and was hit as well, just as FEYE was. SWI was the root. MSFT is working with FEYE on the investigations to prevent the damage from the attack. Does it mean FEYE may have an upside to their top/bottom lines for this and next qtr?"
Good day today. Lets see $19+ tomorrow. Ideally a gap fill to $19.5 although QQQ has been unpredictable.
Dec. 7 -- Investor Business Daily : Cybersecurity Stocks -- The cloud has disrupted everything. There is accelerated growth for cloud-based network security. Cloud services will grow by 33% in 2020. The cyber market is riper than ever for ongoing consolidation.
"$25 this month,just before closing of deal in Oct."
Q1 Non-GAAP EPS of -$0.03 in-line; GAAP EPS of -$0.38.Revenue of $210.54M (+5.7% Y/Y) beats by $0.32M.
"ceo needs to go, plus the deal must close as soon as possible, so they can buy shares under $20"
We’re going to be hearing a lot more good stuff about this company in the coming days. 20+ on the near horizon.
"$2014 - $88 share price, today $18 share price"
"Third major test right now, she is gonna break down, I do predict in the next few minutes...."
"This is a bet on a new IPO called Mandiant coming out when FEYE is finally gone and good riddance to it imo .. end of story. That's just how you have to think about it, and IPO's are volatile in this market."
can someone explain why CRWD is 15x market cap of FEYE?
"I just looked back the past 7 quarters and FEYE beat the estimate each time by an average of .09 cents. The least they have beat by is .03 cents the most is .17 cents, So If they continue this pattern I would be surprised if they don’t report a profit. Revenue on the other hand, they have missed 3 times and beat 4, but have beat 3 in a row by an average of 7 million. It will be interesting to see how much short covering happens the afternoon before the announcement."
"reading the report they actually met consensus estimates, i think the numbers look liek a miss because they also have the continuing ops listed as well. I think the main point is 17% increased revenue. So sell off is unwarranted imo, expecting it to recover tomorrow when people actually read the release and digest the call"
I see share price doubles from here before next quarter ER.
"A buyout could be sooner than we think. Microsoft, IBM and Cisco possible Suiters according to published reports. Hopefully earnings are strong. I love Mandia but I still believe he was brought in to streamline the company and position it for Sale."
what are Board thoughts on Buyout candidates?.... a lot of interesting possible suiters besides private equity and consolidation in Cybersecurity space. msft orcl csco to name a few
Loaded up on FEYE. Mandiant is really cool.
"Tough call on what will happen. When the market slides - I mean really slides, everything goes down. A lot of negativity going on right now. Who knows? Good luck on your timing."
$50/share buyout target possible.
This will be in the 14s before the next report ..... don't be in a hurry to add more shares.
"only way out with cash and a ceo like current one ,!!!!sell out with M&A deal"
"Look at that, more selling pressure just before the open...A lot of holders are looking to get out and willing to take a 10+% loss, just because they fear an even bigger downside move. Plus marginn callsare starting to come in on some long holders..."
earnings tomorrow should finally reflect the still ongoing response to solarwinds’ breach.. thinking about possibly buying more today
"$97 to $18 in a 7.5 year period - a reall wnner here, regardless the name."
"Covered my FEYE Pure Earnings Short Sell at $16.78 for an outstanding single day profit. Shorted yesterday at $20.08, covered 24 hours later at $16.78, with a LOT of shares. This one worked out just about perfeKt. :-) Time to move on to DISH, good luck folks and maybe I see you again here in three months time to do another Pure Earnings Short Sell if this baby bloats back up... :-)"
"Been long about 4 years now with 5,000 shares at $28 average. I’m patient but we need some major catalyst to provide upward momentum. I’m encouraged by our new management and relatively pleased with our performance and future guidance, but yet our share price languishes. Just venting. GL"
"I researched and it's not clear if Fireeye is completely owned - soon - by STG. Also Mandiant doesn't have a ticker. It falls under (FEYE).Then there's the buyback. Wonder if they'll pull the RKT disappearing no buyback.Aside from that appears Fireeye will step into the background as STG take forefront. Love to hear intelligent replies on what's going on. Why? I'm?ready to buy 10,000 shares if I can get some feedback on protocol."
"17% Revenue growth, $65m stock buyback, realigning focus, constructive long term charts, hyperinflation... overreactions in illiquid markets are gifts. These one time transaction charges are noise"
"Mandiant's cloud and consulting business revenue grew 26% last quarter. Legacy business revenue declined 8%. Removing the legacy business allows FireEye to focus on its vary profitability Mandiant business - best in cyber space. With most of revenue coming from Mandiant and eliminating the huge operating costs of legacy, profits will increase substantially. And there will also be less debt on the balance sheet."
The share price should double from here if Management Plays it right .
"Wow a full .41 cents, going to the sky, I think all the other IT'ers are jealous"
Looking good for today. Sweet 16 possibly.
FEYE in great position now to help with problems like TMUS hack this morning.Long on FEYE as future looks great for growth.
"For me this is the perfect time to invest for 3 reasons.1. The share is at a fair price2. The company is shifting to the right thing to do (services with there impressive knowledge on forensics and malware)3. Don't forget, that, when there is a data breach or a cyber attack. The people we are calling is Fireeye.I dont know a price target, but clearly for me, more above 50, at end of 2022, when the spin off will have been done and, at current time, the era of cyber threat, this is the company to call."
"FEYE needs to announce a super blowout earnings for it to be treated like the rest of the high flying Cybersecurity companies. We the LONGS have lost incredible opportunities (at a minimum of 2x or more) on other similar companies over the past few months. I have been holding this for way too long and have seen others go up so much while holding onto this one. Board has not done much to replace the CEO who has consistently underperformed for years, as they got compensated well. I hope it can cross $17 or $18, so I can get my money and run.. Hopefully I will be able to find a better one that will give better return to compensate for what we have lost (real money) and the opportunity loss while holding this stock.. Just my opinion. I am an accidental LONG!!"
"Just connecting some dots... Symphony Technology Group bought the name FireEye and the software portion of the company for 1.2B, leaving Mandiant and the higher growth portion of the company with a focus on breach response (good place to be). This same company symphony tech bought MCFE's enterprise business so MCFE can focus on its fastest growing segment... Is Symphony done buying portions of companies. I think now that they bought the name FEYE they can take the portion of the MCFE and just re-brand it under FEYE and emerge on the other side. We will have a ticker change IMO to MDNT or something like that. The real ? is whether or not FEYE ie. MNDT emerges after this deal is done with a much higher multiple... I truly think so, 2x, 3x??? I can't wait to get this deal done and move on and talk about where this company really wants to go. I know the stock price has been difficult to stomach for some longer term holders but I think shareholders will be rewarded in the coming months/years."
Folks- their current quarter will be huge. Customers are not only buying their IR services but also their managed defense sass service. From the conversations i have had- companies are wanting feye to manage their environment for them ca building it on their own. There is no question this stock is going higher in the short term.
This stock needs to get some respect. All other cyber stocks are over $100. Common show us the money after 6 years of nothing.
Mandiant working with kaseya on the vsa hack.
"T-mobile partners with Cybersecurity experts at Mandiant, KPMG after hack.."
"A little perspective. FEYE is cheap. FireEye opened trading in September 2013 at $20 and closed its first day at $36. Shares stayed around $40 through late 2013. The early January 2014 announcement of a $1 billion merger with privately held security software firm Mandiant was well received, and FEYE stock shot as high as $86 by February. It came down because of missteps and because it wasn’t becoming profitable. But now it is. Good times and much higher prices ahead."
Can someone show me the 200 dollar difference a share between feye and CRWD neither have positive earnings yet CRWD is treated like it is the ultimate leader and they just recently went public. I can see they are growing faster but next 5 years feye is according to analyst growing 91% annually.
"Today Mandiant announced the acquisition of Intrigue, a leader in emerging attack surface market and will be integrated into Mandiant Advantage platform, enabling organizations to discover, monitor, and manage risk across entire attack surfaces. ------- This message is over my head, but I trust Mandiant."
"starting up with constant buyers,late afternoon large solid buyer started buying 1000 share pieces, over $22 in the next 2 weeks"
new 52 week high! I think we're going to get a series of days like this for a while
John Najarian likes feye. Mentioned it during the fast money halftime CNBC. He said he saw upside call buying in May and June. He is waiting for institutional support to get back in. ￼
any interest in legacy mssp companies looking to acquire an MDR like mandiant?
i think big news coming. trading very nicely
