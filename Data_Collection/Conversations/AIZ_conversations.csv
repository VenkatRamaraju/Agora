"this company is basically a group of criminals who scam people into insurance policies they don't want or need or even know they are paying. look at the ppi scandal in England, or balance protector premiums at RBC, or PPP at TD. it's all the same. trick people over phone or in a little tick box on a contract and they pay for a useless premium for years without knowing. made illegal in England, out over 40 billion in damages, this should be made illegal in Canada and USA, and these crooks should go banrupt. take your profits and don't support this unethical model"
