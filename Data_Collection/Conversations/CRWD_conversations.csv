"We saw what happened to PANW when they reported, tomorrow in the $300's for CRWD"
"I bought 17 months ago 100 shares at 46.02, I vowed that this investment would pay for the last two years of my Sons college costs. With his scholarships and the cost of his state university, I estimated I would need $300 a share. He just entered his freshman year of college this week and believe it or not he’s a cyber security major. I’ve already paid for his freshman semester 1 and have enough for this year. If crowd continues I may have enough to pay his sophomore and junior and senior year all On a $4600 investment￼￼￼. How ironic his junior year of high school in March he tells me to buy a company called crowd strike. Knowing he was going to be a cyber security major and here we are 17 months later. I thought I wasn’t going to have to use crowd strike for at least another two years but I may end up using it for the last three years of his four year degree. CRowdstrike in essence is creating the next wave of cyber security experts. I think I’ll reach out to crowd strike and let them know they sponsored my son my sons education and future. Killian, my son, sponsored by crowd strike. It’s just an amazing story that’s all real.￼￼￼￼￼￼ Thank you Crowdstrike for protecting the world and sponsoring Killian. My hope when he graduates, he works for the vary company who made it all possible, Crowdstrike!! Nothing would be more amazing to this story than that ending. Who knows. It could happen."
it seems 300 $ will be soon today even I guess
Usually upgrades come in after ER. Why are they coming right before ER?
"CrowdStrike will also join two other lesser-known indexes. The Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted Index aims to avoid the distortions that result from the biggest Nasdaq companies having disproportionately large market capitalizations. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq-100 Technology Index focuses squarely on companies in the tech sector."
"Crowdstrike price target raised to $335 from $277 at NeedhamNeedham analyst Alex Henderson raised the firm's price target on Crowdstrike to $335 from $277 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The expectations for the company's Q2 earnings expected this Tuesday are ""high"" but the forecasts are also ""beatable"", the analyst tells investors in a research note. Henderson adds Crowdstrike should benefit from strong demand while the out-year forecasts suggest a much faster deceleration than he believes to be likely given the company's strong execution, aggressive growth management style, superb architecture, and opportunities in Kubernetes."
is there something wrong with after market price.. drop 30%?
Glad I got into this a few weeks ago.
"CRWD price target is 335$ , still 50$ more to go this week Beating earnings and 50$ increase wow!!"
Salamander don't cry
"CRWD Joining NASDAQ 100 INDEX, make it reach up to 300$ this week !!Well done   "
Its all just a headfake to sell off at highest possible price before earnings are released. Be very careful here
If you had 1K shares you had to be willing to hold through a $25K loss to make a $25K gain.
"Palo Alto' ear ings were not only great, they chalked up the growth to cloud-based...that's CRWD's game...they rule there.Going to be some serious numbers next Tues when CRWD reports.Remember all those hacks in zmay and June... Those fixes will be reflected on This quarter's earnings for CRWD."
Needham analyst Alex Henderson maintains CrowdStrike Holdings with a Buy and raises the price target from $277 to $335.
Options slowing this down today (Huge calls at $280 and $285) otherwise would be up further like ZS and DOCU. Will be $300 by ER Tuesday. Buy the stock or the September 17 calls.
"look like no stopping on all cybersecurity stocks, US missiles"
"5 Research firms raised price target just 2 days ahead of CRWD EARNINGS, CrWD will reach 320$ this week"
"Breaking Crowdstrike news: CRWD to join the Nasdaq 100 before market opens on August 26. Oh my goodness. Along with the Palo Alto beat... to the moon, Alice! LOL"
"Will surpass 52 week high, then heading into $300s"
Bought @271. Hope I will make some $
Look at the volume we are going to the moon soon!
This will fly next week 300$ because of earnings
Another week to $300/share?
CRWD will beat earnings with back again to its price at 270$ 
"Earnings on Monday, we should see $300's on Tuesday."
So when will we reach 400?
Wow!!! CRWD will reach 300$ this week All news on CRWD Beating earnings
Why not $300 to get it over with. It will be there anyway sooner or later.
COB on Tuesday CRWD’s earnings per share will significantly exceed analysts’ expectations by over 30%.
"300 short term, 450-500 2 years. IMO"

"Three index ETFs and funds are buying CRWD.CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) will join the NASDAQ-100 Index, the NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index, and the NASDAQ-100 Technology Index before the market opens on Aug. 26."
"this ll be 300 this week, and by earnings will cross 350$"
Crwd just added to NAS 100. Official starts Thursday !
Is it a buy at this price?
"This is the best stock to own until ER... This sector is hot, they got added to 3 indexes (so institutions need to buy) and they will surely destroy estimate.Buy whenever it drops again to the low $270s... $300 coming soon then some more. $500 by year end."
