at this P/E everything had to be beyond stellar
Why not $300 to get it over with. It will be there anyway sooner or later.
Crashing SO it has to rise $10 after earnings to get back to where it was yesterday 
Might be a few days before any real upmove. I think the rule is about 3 days.
beat earnings CRWD by the early news !Aftermarket will jump upto 290 $
"Crowdstrike initiated with an Outperform at Wolfe ResearchWolfe Research analyst Alex Zukin initiated coverage of Crowdstrike with an Outperform rating and $305 price target. Crowdstrike has been the best performing hypergrowth security stock he covers, rising 20% year-to-date ""as investors reward the highest quality name within the sector,"" Zukin said in his initiation note."
Beat guidance and it’s down… don’t get it. Hoping it’s green tomorrow.
Earnings for CS=Earnings for shareholders be smart hold and buy dip
"I bought 17 months ago 100 shares at 46.02, I vowed that this investment would pay for the last two years of my Sons college costs. With his scholarships and the cost of his state university, I estimated I would need $300 a share. He just entered his freshman year of college this week and believe it or not he’s a cyber security major. I’ve already paid for his freshman semester 1 and have enough for this year. If crowd continues I may have enough to pay his sophomore and junior and senior year all On a $4600 investment￼￼￼. How ironic his junior year of high school in March he tells me to buy a company called crowd strike. Knowing he was going to be a cyber security major and here we are 17 months later. I thought I wasn’t going to have to use crowd strike for at least another two years but I may end up using it for the last three years of his four year degree. CRowdstrike in essence is creating the next wave of cyber security experts. I think I’ll reach out to crowd strike and let them know they sponsored my son my sons education and future. Killian, my son, sponsored by crowd strike. It’s just an amazing story that’s all real.￼￼￼￼￼￼ Thank you Crowdstrike for protecting the world and sponsoring Killian. My hope when he graduates, he works for the vary company who made it all possible, Crowdstrike!! Nothing would be more amazing to this story than that ending. Who knows. It could happen."
At one point tomorrow CRWD will be under 250 or down 30+ save this brilliance
"CRWD price target is 335$ , still 50$ more to go this week Beating earnings and 50$ increase wow!!"
I read all the executive and board sell off this week that why yesterday. I suggested everyone review it. Hope it goes up but placing a stop loss just in case.
It’s going to get worse not better
I call this little stock named CrowdPUKE  “Zoom 2”.
Yes!!!!!!
What a ride it's been
Not after what happened to ZM. Shouldn't correlate but it is what it is.
Could touch $300 by the end of today?
You should load the truck on this dip
314 by end of week
"Three index ETFs and funds are buying CRWD.CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) will join the NASDAQ-100 Index, the NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index, and the NASDAQ-100 Technology Index before the market opens on Aug. 26."
Another week to $300/share?

"look like no stopping on all cybersecurity stocks, US missiles"
Look at the volume we are going to the moon soon!
"Insider selling going on looks like. What do you think, why the stock is going down without any news? Market manipulation by MMs?"
A best in class company in a growing field + A beat and raise quarter = buy the dip.
Shorted more around 289 should I cover here at 279 or short more?
"My prediction. Earnings out tonight and they destroy estimates. Stock tanks tomorrow for no reason whatsoever, BUT THIS WILL BE A BUYING OPPORTUNITY!! Within one month stock goes to $350."
I guess down $10 from the highs yesterday then down $6 today then down $15 in after hours wasn’t enough LOL 
Wow!!! CRWD will reach 300$ this week All news on CRWD Beating earnings
"Another stellar quarter, raised guidance, not much more we could ask for. We ran hot into earnings, nothing more than profit taking. We should see 300+ soon."
Anyone who isn’t short into earnings is absolutely an amateur and going to lose a lot of money 
It will be in the green tomorrow.
"Palo Alto' ear ings were not only great, they chalked up the growth to cloud-based...that's CRWD's game...they rule there.Going to be some serious numbers next Tues when CRWD reports.Remember all those hacks in zmay and June... Those fixes will be reflected on This quarter's earnings for CRWD."
The trend is your friend: crashes into earnings means it goes much lower after earnings
"@SalamanderJohnson You saw $220 today. Look now, around $232, $12 in one day, no news. In your elementary school they teach that this is 15% up. +15% in one day, no news. Wow!"
"Not near a PC, is CRWD also up $60 like PANW after earnings????"
Last chance under 279 right now
The drop is bad. I don't get it.
Has any stock ever gone up after earnings in the past two years amazing  people haven’t caught on to the pattern yet of every stonk crashing
is there something wrong with after market price.. drop 30%?
"this ll be 300 this week, and by earnings will cross 350$"
What do you bet we get a sell the news situation post market?
Tough Crowd
Bought the dip...thx for the discount!
It's really hilarious when shorts asking you to sell off !!!WE WILL gain more todayBeats Earnings is confirmed 
buying more tomorrow
Ok guys. Merry Christmas! Fill up the truck.
"I sold my all shares, as I expected more dip, loss is high however they achieved revenues, but with higher loss!!"
Where’s KPuke/Sally Salamander? LOL
279 to 278 now before earnings means “ZOOM 2.” Save this brilliance
"Indeed a huge drop today. But that's okay, if you believe in this incredible company, then hold. I do believe in crowdstrike"
"Looks like it's going to do what I was afraid of on earnings day: Drag it way down and the weak hands bail, wrongly thinking earnings must be terrible. Then when it pops after earnings it will end up being from a much lower level. I hope I'm wrong and it rises ahead of earnings."
"Big beat by Palo Alto just now, so we're seeing a nice pop."
Geese...I hope we are not looking at disappointing earnings and its leaked out
"The first price target raise of many to come:Crowdstrike price target raised to $325 from $275 at Summit Insights, BUYSummit Insights analyst Srini Nandury raised the firm's price target on Crowdstrike to $325 from $275 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares after its ""solid"" Q2 results. The company should remain a will remain the leader in Endpoint Detection and Response space, and while multiple players to exhibit strong share gains from legacy vendors, Crowdstrike looks ""well positioned"", the analyst tells investors in a research note. Nandury adds that Crowdstrike continues to add new customers rapidly, having increased its customer count by 1,660 to a total of 13,080 in Q2."
"Serious question, though they are 2 different sectors, which one do you like the best and why, “Docu or crwd”? Appreciate it."
any news on their earnings??!
Like I said 1000x today: ZOOM  2
Don't worry kids. Uncle Joe has gotten REAL tough on those cyber criminals. U don't need Crowdstrike
What's a good entry?
$290 by eod tomorrow!
Where is the Salamander Now???

"Be honest, anyone in here old enough to remember $289?"
I am told $CRWD is losing out on solid sales to $S...Let's see what the blowout earnings takes this stock to! I am hoping for a $60+. HODL
Where are all my congratulations  for begging you all to sell and short at the exact gap filler $286.37 to the penny top???
Anyone see the -$89 last night in after hours 2 more hours until you see it again! Earnings leaked
CROWDSTRIKE is the next NVADIA
CRWD impact will follow PANW tomorrow

There are a lot of competitors in this area. This company is not the only game in town. Especially when this company doesn't make any real money.
"I bought on 252, should I sell or hold guys?!!!"
"woooow, these earnings are muuuch less than forecasted!!! closing now my position"
"Will surpass 52 week high, then heading into $300s"
"Loaded up 50,000 PROG .92 for tomorrow Huge breakout and ALLTIME lows"
"Crwd had a huge run last 3 weeks, pretty normal drop even with good earnings"
Keep selling 
"Earnings on Monday, we should see $300's on Tuesday."
"Before ER, mostly dropping 20% to $212.5This seems preparing to wait the earning report.I will wait and don't buy at this point.Dropping in the beginning."
Earnings were once again excellent and great guidance BUT that doesn’t matter anymore in this market you all had to know that
It’s fine guys - add more tomorrow 
65b valuation on 300m revenues quarterly?...seems way overvalued
ARR 70% YOY and 2022 guidance raised
"$CRWD launched CrowdStrike Falcon for GovCloud for government agencies, protecting through AI comprehensive threat intelligence and 24/7/365 support."
Sorry guys I just bought some shares that's why it's going down
"This is the best stock to own until ER... This sector is hot, they got added to 3 indexes (so institutions need to buy) and they will surely destroy estimate.Buy whenever it drops again to the low $270s... $300 coming soon then some more. $500 by year end."
Tanking after earnings. Crashing tomorrow. Buying opportunity this week. Nothing but good news to report.
State Dept. hit by Cyberattck.
Fly baby fly To $300
I still say buyout offer coming
the next Zoom
"Sooner or later, the Fed will have to raise rates. These tech stocks with no PE, high debt, no dividend, losing money, will no longer have the same value. And, they're currently WAY over valued. I would be very cautious."
"may drop during the day, but no way we are dropping after earnings. Very doubtful. I see up 30+ points for the remainder of the week"
Shorties lost so much money during the last weeks and now they are out in full force to scare us …what is your point?! Strong figures are strong figures :D ..
What happened?
This will be $250+ in 2-3 years. Same as $crwd grew
So when will we reach 400?
It's not even an option for companies now...they NEED to invest in cyber security...it's pennies on the dollar compared to the cost of a data breach.
"A Strong Stock and company, while the market all declined, CRWD is stable "
HOLD and wait for the raise after earnings announce
Another scared tactics before earnings?
"Smart money dumping this stock after taking this to the moon , earnings beating estimates is already factored in the stock price"
"LMAO CRWD has to post investor conference right after earnings because they bombed, no wonder insiders sold"
Like I said earlier. Stock will dip after release. BUY NOW AT A DISCOUNT. $350 within 30 days.
"250 tomorrow, overvalued"
"Way ahead of itself, good company, I'm a buyer at $72.50."
"Hold on, folks. CC coming up. Things will change."
if there selling crowd what are they buying.Its a manipulation game again and again and again
"Crowdstrike price target raised to $335 from $277 at NeedhamNeedham analyst Alex Henderson raised the firm's price target on Crowdstrike to $335 from $277 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The expectations for the company's Q2 earnings expected this Tuesday are ""high"" but the forecasts are also ""beatable"", the analyst tells investors in a research note. Henderson adds Crowdstrike should benefit from strong demand while the out-year forecasts suggest a much faster deceleration than he believes to be likely given the company's strong execution, aggressive growth management style, superb architecture, and opportunities in Kubernetes."
Is it a buy at this price?
Long term investors should not worry one single bit from this earnings. Long.
Anyone selling this evening will be greatly regretting it in the coming weeks.
Just getting fried on this. Throw it on the pile
Options slowing this down today (Huge calls at $280 and $285) otherwise would be up further like ZS and DOCU. Will be $300 by ER Tuesday. Buy the stock or the September 17 calls.
now this! is interesting
Eps came it at 0.11 vs analysts 0.09. That’s a beat!!
"$375 by September 27, 2021"

"Well, per my prediction a couple of hours ago, as expected, numbers were through the roof and, as I predicted (almost), the stock would drop to $265 after hours. (It hit $268). This isn't my first rodeo..."
Let me summarize what I see before earnings:1) 5 price targets ahead of earnings (unusual)2) Nasdaq-100 inclusion3) Stock has been going up 6-7 days in a row4) PANW strong earnings on Prisma cloud product5) Strong volume 6 days in a row (3-6M each day)Lets destroy earnings now.
beat and raise. Buy the dip.
"Those who think that the society opening, and decrease in online purchases, will decrease the need for raising cybersecurity standards, are greatly mistaken.Don't forget that the most devastating cyberattacks these days target supply chain. Gasoline shortage in East US this May, 5 day closure of Coop supermarkets in Sweden, disruption of Cape Town port operations in July - all caused by cyber attcks, nothing to do with online trading, pure supply chain."

...CRWD...cloudstrike 288 a share
tomorrow we go green
RIP SALAMANDERJOHNSON! Can’t wait for your new alias.
This will do a Moderna after earnings.
When Zoom  fell $7 last night into earnings everyone there was saying “$400 easily.” Well how do they like $200 now????
Huge BEAT!!!!!! 
Glad I got into this a few weeks ago.
manderguy is puking today
If I weren't maxxed out on this I'd add more after hours. Great numbers.
"Revenue rose to $337.3 million from $199 million in the year-ago quarter. That's nearly 70% growth.Annual recurring revenue, a software-as-a-service metric that shows how much revenue the company can expect based on subscriptions, increased 70% to $1.34 billion for the quarter."
"Company results is what matters. Insiders are TOP This company is working for the future of cybercrime so is all of us,I Believe and I will hold for my grandchildren"
Being added to indexes means it cannot be that easily manipulated anymore. Just buy any dip... ER will be great.
My prediction: Great earnings but will dip below $265.00 after hours.
Beat Earnings CRWD and ll be seeing big jumping
Like I said 1000x no stock falls $7 into good earnings then traded higher wouldn’t you like that -$7 now? Remember it’s really down $20 today now
Get ready to fill up the truck.
Salamander don't cry
Trivia question: WHAT FALLS FASTER ZOOM OR CROWDPUKE
"great report after great report, long."
289 to 260 by tomorrow not bad cha Ching game is so easy
No stock falls $40 or 20% into earnings if they are going to be good REAL bad news coming
US economy falling apart 20 to 30% correction coming sell while you can

this is a great company
insiders sold big time
Still 4% of the float short. And I see I got a thumb's down from one of them. Pity...
I think ER beat is already priced in. There can be a pullback before heading higher. I will hold for long.
Alright I'm in. Have been watching the company for a while and should have pulled the trigger sooner.
"ok ok I'm getting tired day after day to tell u to short these tech stocks before earnings,,,,its like taking candy from a baby"
This has always been the habit of crwd after strong earnings. It will bounce back in a day or two.
Earnings per share: exceeded expectations by 20%Revenue: exceeded expectations by 10%Guidance and outlook for the fiscal year: raisedSubscription number: steady growthSounds like a picture perfect earnings report!
If you use the chart and use the 1 year comparison with paypay and apple and other stocks CRWD is set to beat big
LOVE  everyone saying it would be up like PANW +60 LOL close only down $25
If you had 1K shares you had to be willing to hold through a $25K loss to make a $25K gain.
Down $25 on huge volume earnings leaked R.I.P.
Just sold all and short 280 seems like the logical trade good luck all
CrowdStrike is up 6.11% to 260.83
"Not a problem, I am cool, buying more."
Based on today’s news this should get to $300 quite quickly.
Rumor is earnings leaked and they are real bad; good luck  to all
It’s the new clients Google and the other 2 they named and whoever else they get. for next earnings report Right to $285 by next earnings. No brainer
my guess is it will tank on earnings. if it does im selling my PMCCs ans buying another LEAP.
$273 to $230 in what two days on no news LOL 
Holding 90 shares since $39.52! Waiting for 350
"CrowdStrike raises full-year guidance for second time this year“In the second quarter we once again achieved strong growth at scale and delivered exceptional unit economics, drove leverage and remained capital efficient, generating strong operating and free cash flow. Given our strong performance and growing momentum in the market, and reflecting our view of a continued robust demand environment, we are raising our guidance for fiscal year 2022,” says Chief Financial Officer Burt Podbere.For the third quarter, the company guides for sales of $358 million to $365.3 million with adjusted EPS of $0.08 to $0.10. Analysts expected the company to forecast $351.72 million in revenue and $0.09 EPS.The full-year revenue outlook raises to $1.39 billion to $1.41 billion from the prior $1.35 billion to $1.37 billion and adjusted EPS to $0.43 to $0.49, up from $0.35 to $0.41.

Has anyone looked over the beneficial ownership (SC 13D/G)? Is that normal?
Congratulations to the hard working and innovative people in Crowdstrike for being added to Nasdaq 100. A formidable and well deserved achievement
I will be 100% correct short CRWD into earnings 0% chance it goes higher
Anyone see Zoom???? This will fall $89
Tomorrow CrowdPUKE puke will be $250. GUARANTEED or I never post ever again. R.I.P. 
it seems 300 $ will be soon today even I guess
anyone knows the news ??!
https://discord.gg/nEs3H6W
How is CrowdPUKE  only down $21 since yesterday i said $89!
"that salamander guy is everywhere, muted him months ago from some other board"
At least it’s not down $60 like Zoom  How many times did I call CrowdPUKE  “Zoom 2” today?
"Just stay long, let them sell srs."
Call dropping this.
Bought @271. Hope I will make some $
MFool just recommened this..
"Upon earnings, does CRWD act significantly different from PANW, in the same sector? PANW had blowout earnings a week ago and good forecast and popped around $70."
Needham analyst Alex Henderson maintains CrowdStrike Holdings with a Buy and raises the price target from $277 to $335.
"Tomorrow will drop likely, as earning result already priced in earlier. After some pullbacks, the bull continues! Just IMHO"
tell us now if you are holding or notdon't brag in an hour when its 310 (or 240).lol
"Move on for beating earnings as usual,CRWD will reach 260-270$ when beat earnings next week definitely"
"take a bet......I am hodl, not buying but certainly not selling"
"ZM effect. If Crwd has anything less than stellar guidance, this drops big. Hope it pulls it off"
GS increased their position long by 2 million shares. Makes me wonder?
Thankfully I bought at the highs. Pretty good at this
"Beats Earnings, reaching 300$ TODAY"
CRWD stock sinks as market gains: what u should know = Utter jibberish. Buy
$272+ to $220 LOL  and longs are still holding on? Why?
This the BIG earnings you have all been dreaming of? PANW up $60. Did CRWD go up $60 too? Let me check. Anyone see ZM or ADSK after earnings? Both R.I.P.
"Holds will win today, Holds guys"
"On Earnings whisper now, CRWD Beating Wow!!!"
"No worries, institutional ownership of CRWD is over 70 percent. They will be scooping up CRWD with gratitude. The demand for CrowdStrike products and services growing; the future looks bright."
"tomorrow will go up by 10 per to 300 plus. Huge scope to service govt, Google, msft etc"
Seen no real time evidence for the falling price trend has anyone seen or knows why this stock is falling ? Is it a general predicted miss influence on the price ? Or is this fall usual before earnings ?
"looks like shorts covering, squeeze hard guys"
"Tomorrow, CRWD will be trading on NASDAX 100, I expect the fluctuation trading as usual. Be patient, I expect CRWD will break out and hit new high, 300 is my goal."
Crwd just added to NAS 100. Official starts Thursday !
Locked in my profits. Sold all shares except two.. Now it does not matter. If it goes up that's okay. Sold to protect my hard earned money. If it goes down Oh well . Either way I'm happy. Still made money..
Ladies & Gentlemen welcome to Zoom  2

"Breaking Crowdstrike news: CRWD to join the Nasdaq 100 before market opens on August 26. Oh my goodness. Along with the Palo Alto beat... to the moon, Alice! LOL"
Its all just a headfake to sell off at highest possible price before earnings are released. Be very careful here
"Load up guys, we're going up big time"
I hope this blows away earnings and guidance and kicks everyone in the teeth who is selling.
"CNBC's Josh at 12:45 stated to not purchase any stock in CRWD ahead of the close, You do the math!"
"Moving up Now, Moving to beat 300$ tomorrow"
No stock goes from 289 to 280 right before earnings if they are going to be good 
"Great Earnings report tonight, it will skyrocket just like $PANW"
CrowdPUKE  $269 now was 289+ yesterday LOL almost in correction mode
ZS is now higher than CRWD…never in a million years did I think I would see that!
267 now LOL  just wait until tomorrow down $30 minimum
Welcome to Nasdaq boys.Earning next week will take us above 300!
"I'm bullish, but wouldnt be suprised if we see a drop after beating earnings. could be priced in"
$240 today b4 the market closed
Any guesses for whats causing the drop? Crwd has be en traditionally 30-40 pts ahead of ZS and now only 6pts. My guess is a secondary or they are buying out another company. Just my guess
Discount prices
CRWD will beat earnings with back again to its price at 270$ 
I am waiting $200 to buy.Let's it sell
Been here since 3/20 @$57.88.Sold some @$159.50 early this year. All profits riding at this point.
"Buy Buy Buy....hedge funds playing as if its all bad, so they can buy cheap"
PANW +$60CRWD -$20They do the same thing You chose POORLY
"44.4% surprise, or higher"
People complaining about CRWD going up and down day by day. Yet clearly it’s page tells you 52 week price range has been $93-275 ish. So the stock within one year has jumped almost 200%. Really you all are jump whining. Stocks take a break. Even Tesla was stuck at 275-375 for more than 2 years. Calm down.
"everyone will short tomorrow, at least we can get a better price in a week"
"We saw what happened to PANW when they reported, tomorrow in the $300's for CRWD"
"The options charts are showing $250 at the high end, and $225 (where it was last week) as the low end. Please trade CrowdPUKE  accordingly. Thank you ."
"Beated revenue and EPS + raised 2022 guidelines, added over 1600 new customers and existing customers keep increasing their modules, really excellent news! Therefore this stock is gonna drop big times AH and the next days "
I am done holding stocks through earnings.
This will fly next week 300$ because of earnings
All volumes now towards buying... Great News 
"Stifel raised PT, add that to the list"
"Behavior of CRWD stock after earnings is just like MRVL stock. Both stocks went down after handily beating estimates. Oh well, time to buy more."
Loving the panic sell before close 
CRWD analysis coming up on CNBC now!
"Great numbers but this stock is incredibly overpriced per CNBC, will dip back but we all know this will come back up by the end of the year."
The whale is moving
I got puts just in case something like this would happen :D
FLUNKED EARNINGS!!!!!!!
"I'm gonna load it if it sell off to 175$ again. PE is like 600, so anything can happen."

I am still looking for 380 on this.
What does Josh Brown say about the report? Seems a good buy on a pull back here.
AH volume is very low....thankfully
CRWD LFG!
"Lousy trader here. So going to hold through earnings and hope for a decent pull back to add more. Everytime I took profit, I regretted it a few months later"
Bought 500 shares at 279.26
I say $250 tomorrow after earnings is pretty much a lock 
I don’t understand why would it go down with such of great numbers 
Predictions for tomorrow?? I guess we have a blowout and sent the stock up 30points at least. Do not underestimate the direction of crwd. Thats my guess for the remainder of the week
"Crowdy probably dove because of a hack at Accenture. However, the hack exploited something in Fortinet's coverage, not Crowdstrike. When the street finds out this was not a CRWD problem, I think we'll be back on track again."
I am hearing clear and loud from the many companies that $S has won against $CRWD hands down.
"Seems like every company that releases earnings these days go down. And for the companies that miss the expectations, stock goes down -25% in one day. Just goes to show how overvalued the market is right now."
It’s rigged
What a disappointment; should have sold 2 days ago. Came so close
272 months ago going back to 225 tomorrow R.I.P. CrowdPUKE 
Enough with the discord site spams
"Love how all haters celebrated too soon, brick wall at 267. t00 eZ. Dope quarter"

I honestly don’t understand why anyone in the world would hold into earnings when the stock was $289? What were you hoping for?
$310 tomorrow.
Buy the dip. You will not regret it
This stock CrowdPUKE  was $272 months ago never moved tanked to $225 then fake added to NASDAQ100 or this slop would be $180 now!!!
"Analysis came now, beating earnings, congratulations "
"Just shorted a block of CRWD, word is tomorrow is going to be bloodbath"
I need to know where the guy is who bought 500 shares at $183 or so today before earnings LOL 
I love u crowdstike.
Cybersecurity is more important now than ever before.

No bother - sticking with it.
"They report loss per share, double loss than last quarter. Yes they beat REVENUES, GROSS MARGIN But not Loss!! that's an issue"
Salamander/Kevin you good man?
"300 short term, 450-500 2 years. IMO"
Great numbers yet again! It’s fine if people want to sell it off. I’ll happily buy it if I see some sort of weakness in this stock.

"Now that CRWD is part of Nasdaq-100, several fund managers will be forced to accumulate for their clients. This will drive the price higher"
Huge beat stock popped on the algo. Now is it guidance dropping it back?
"CrowdStrike will also join two other lesser-known indexes. The Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted Index aims to avoid the distortions that result from the biggest Nasdaq companies having disproportionately large market capitalizations. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq-100 Technology Index focuses squarely on companies in the tech sector."

not seen results but can't be that bad looking at price action...great time to have investor presentations just after earnings...expect to be up tomorrow..new horizons beckon
Usually upgrades come in after ER. Why are they coming right before ER?
"surprised to see crwd down after that report. I still strongly believe that we will see green tomorrow. Simply a guessing game from day to day. I am surprised that zs is more per share than crwd especially after the earnings. Okta reports tomorrow and I am guessing that we will rally the whole sector. Its like a trick, just wait til Thursday"
anyone in here listen to me and make 100% on the weekly options?
"I still believe that we open up barley down tomorrow. We should see green tomorrow is my guess. Wait til Okta reports tomorrow, that will bump up crwd."
OK now down $20 today 6 during regular trading $14 now in after hours YES where is the guy who bought 500 shares before the close?
"This is one of the best run, fastest growing, highest confidence companies you can own. They are #1 in an industry that is not only desired, but necessary. Their AI technology is killer good. You should never worry about Crowdstrike, even at its valuation. It will grow into it. It will come back."
Please sell off today boys
