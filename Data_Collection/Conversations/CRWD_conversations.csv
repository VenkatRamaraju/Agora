"Guys, time to mute salamander"
CrowdPUKE  289 in January 285 now almost November LOL 
"Sold 1,943 shares @ $290.00 per share. Nice RG of $20,851.00. GLTAL's"
"Is Amazon financing the Crowd strike ? Buy out ? $500+ . I Will be $500 either way like Palo Alto. Your welcome. Ther are ETFs That have CRWD plus other cyber security companies. BUG ,WCBR ,ect."
"$DDOG was hinted a few weeks before official PR. Look closely into PR. Who is hinted?? $CRWDTruContext ingests ANY data in its raw and native format, including PCAP, Netflow, Nessus, Splunk data, Crowdstrike, etc., making it easier for users to see machine data and find new insights - Users can now leverage TruContext to understand cyber threat data in real-time, enabling decisions to be made with confidence."
This is one of the best ten stocks to hold for the next ten years. Cyber is a major GLOBAL problem for almost all businesses.
Today’s special: Smoked Salamander
CrowdStrike is up 5.28% to 294.90
Orange Capital Invest did a deep dive on CRWD
Probably the most gorgeous perfectly formed double top 288 formation in the history of trading
Picked by panelist on HALFTIME REPORT (CNBC) on final trade today. Says will make new ALL TIME HIGH (perhaps today).
Willam Shatner wasn't the only one that took off to space today CRWD and TWLO were right there with them yahoooooo .Great day
"CRWD is the best SAAS stock out there, why is its valuation so much lower than all the others?Its growth is higher than the rest and they make actually money and FCF?Why do NET ASAN BILL trade at 70-100x revs, when CRWD trades at 45x revs?People think NET with its low 50% growth and major cash burn is better than CRWD? Can't see how that's possible.If you are looking out 2 years the valuation discrepancy becomes even worse because CRWD has very high growth while the others are slower?Stocks are crazy that's all I know. I'm worried that the SAAS sector has become the SPAC sector of a few months ago. Still going to hold CRWD because its valuation isn't terrible for the sector."
2nd leg up had started. 
$300 today
I Took profits in $CRWD invested from last year and bought $BB 
We’re going to see a strong run heading into earnings. PT = $350
Remembering all the complainers in the $240s last week. What did I tell you…. $350 soon.
"Analysts meeting scheduled today, hope gets some Mo"
solid buy. Love it
Putin is helping my retirement account grow.
Need this to come down a bit as I missed the boat.......... Great company.
If tomorrow and Friday market is positive it will hopefully jump 20 points up till Friday Since couldn’t go up enough with positive news yesterday
Another load of cyber attacks happening in the US. ZS also hitting new heights as getting close to earnings call.
heading back to 250 after earnings
 on its way to $300/share.
"350 coming soon,Russia helping"
Little cup and handle action going on here. One press release should do it..
"CRWD has a 360 PE going forward This assumes $.78 in EPS in 2022, which is around 60% eps growth from the $.47 eps analyst estimates in 2021- according to Yahoo Finance under the analysis tab. So if CRWD grew by 60% for the next 4 years, and the stock price didn't go up, the PE would be only 90 going forward !"
Here we go boys. On its way to 300
Today's special: Charred Salamander
CYRN is a much cheaper cyber security play that will ROCKET!!!!
Sold at 242...I think I timed the bottom. Next stop is 300+
Orange Capital Invest has a deep dive on CRWD
Strong buy!
Will it come back and go fo 300?
added my first shares yesterday! I hope it drops short term so I can add more
$280 by Friday!
smart buy at this time?
This stock is getting a little pricey for average retail buyer. Hope it splits so that I can buy a big chunk. This stock hopefully will make a whole bunch of small investors rich. What's your take?
