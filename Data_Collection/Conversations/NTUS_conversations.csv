"Interesting price action the last couple of days. I keep waiting for this company to be bought out. Have held since 2005, and it's done well, but the business seems to have stalled the past 3-5 years, and it's time for a change."

"I sold out @ $37.25 back in September, simply out of frustration with the stock doing little to nothing over the prior fews years. Wish I could say I timed things well, but I just got lucky. At sub-$30, I'm starting to get intrigued again. I still like the niche areas of healthcare they serve. Thoughts appreciated."

Seems the market likes BABY's acquisition of Integra's Neurosurgery business. Looks like $50M in cash for a business generating nearly that in revenue annually. Supposedly accretive to earnings immediately. Sounds solid to me. Been riding this for a while and haven't gone anywhere (after a ride up and back down). Here's hoping this good news takes us up towards $40 again. Best of luck BABY longs.

I though it can't get much lower but it is still moving. -15.54 in a year is a lot. The loss of $11.6 Mill in Q4 is not surprising after the accounting problems that appeared in media. RSI is obly 26.58 but who would be buying with the current predictions - https://wallmine.com/nasdaq/baby/charts SMA is moving like crazy

"BABY has me baffled... Over the past 10 years, revenue has increased from a bit over $100M to an expected $450M+/- this coming year. That's impressive! They've done this without burdening the balance sheet with unsustainable debt levels. I think the acquisitions have been thoughtful, done at good prices and made sense to their overall business goals. BABY trades at less than a market multiple in regards to P/E where you'd expect a smaller cap growing healthcare company would trade at a premium, So what's the deal? - I think BABY may have been too conservative to appease wall street's feed me now mindset. - I think BABY's forecasts may have been a bit confusing resulting in reduced confidence in management.- There's never really been a 'potential acquisition premium' tied to this stock, which is rare for a company this size.- While BABY provides crucial services with their products, it's not a sexy business (kinda under the radar).My take - I'm currently underwater on my investment with my average price right around $36 per share (all owned for a couple years now). I have a smallish position, which I could add to but have held off as I felt there were better places to invest new money. With all that said, I like BABY's position over the longer term. They've found a couple good underserved niches in healthcare, which is rare. They run a fairly conservative operation, so we'll never see hyper growth but that's OK as I have spaces in my portfolio for small cap conservative growth. I've considered selling, but ultimately decided to hold and can see myself even adding to the position if it drops below $30 at some point. I'd prefer not to go there though. Best of luck longs!"

"$40. Nice to see some price movement in a positive direction. These next earnings will be important, given the recent acquisitions."
going to $20 today
"just sell long, go short and hold short for few days, cover at $3"
"Curious to hear others thoughts on if BABY would make a good acquisition target for anyone? If yes, who and why? I have a fairly small position which I've been holding for a couple years (slightly up right now) and am trying to decide what I should do with my shares (hold, sell or add more)."
