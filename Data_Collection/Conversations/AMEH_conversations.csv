Well it held above 79 and this could mean a strong run into the 90's and above!
Yea I’d be interested in understanding the slump.
This thing is ready for an 15% jump in the next few days!!!!
Why is co-CEO Warren Hosseinion selling his shares almost every day?

"Grab your DRAMAMINE and HOLD ON! Volume is ALREADY about 100,000 after only twenty MINUTES! Where will it STOP -- NOBODY knows!"
Anyone have insight on this? Outlook is strong but seems to be getting messed with.
"Very weird ""The After Hours"" every day there is always 1 or 2 shares sold for 21. 95 or 21. 65 but always 21 and change!?"
"EXCELLENT new earnings report! Cash/securities around $4 of debt net of debt. Large increase in revenues. Still trades awfully thin, so set limit orders."
10-Q should be out in about a week -- should begin to finally see real results after digesting merger effects.

"Where are those stock watchers, this one is going up recently, who are the buyers, insiders, or something else happening???"
(http://Rightpicker.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
Very low volume on this down turn. Profit taking
Very much undervalued but incredibly thin trading forces limit orders.
Getting poised to jump back into Triple Digits again...
"Damn, over 2 million shares traded."
"Argus following AMEH price closely. Just upgraded from Hold to Buy, but dropped target from $104 to $96. It was funny watching them up price target up every few days on the last run."
"Insiders selling this #$%$,,,, news black out mafia company"
"Good earnings, should move back up to triple digits fairly soon!!!"
"Per Ameritrade, 2,847,799 shares traded! Up TEN BUCKS! Been YEARS since I've had this much FUN! I'm guessing some buyout or merger at this point!"
Not bad at all. In at $5.75 back in May. Can't complain.
How many purchased this in the Triple Digit's?
"MAYBE this has something to do the stock movement........On December 8, 2017, Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc. (the ""Company"") completed a merger (the ""Merger"") with Network Medical Management, Inc., a California corporation (""NMM""). As a result of the Merger, NMM became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and immediately following the consummation of the Merger, the former NMM shareholders owned more than 80% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock as previously disclosed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.As a condition to the closing of the Merger, all of the former NMM shareholders entered into Lock-Up Agreements with the Company, each dated December 6, 2017 (the ""Lock-Up Agreements""). Under the terms of each Lock-Up Agreement, the former NMM shareholders agreed not to, without the prior written consent of the Company and except in limited circumstances, (i) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase or otherwise transfer or dispose of Company common stock they received from the Merger (the ""Covered Securities""), or (ii) enter into any swap or other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Covered Securities. The lock-up restrictions terminate with respect to one-third of the Covered Securities immediately following each of (i) the 18th month anniversary of the effective time of the Merger (the ""First Lock Up Period""), (ii) the 30th month anniversary of the effective time of the Merger (the ""Second Lock Up Period""), and (iii) the 42nd month anniversary of the effective time of the Merger (the “Third Lock Up Period”). Pursuant to certain amendments to the Lock-Up Agreements, the former NMM shareholders agreed to extend the expiration date on the First Lock-Up Period from June 7, 2019 to September 30, 2019, and thereafter, to further extend the expiration date of the First Lock-Up Period from September 30, 2019 to January 31, 2020. The other terms of the Lock-Up Agreements remain unchanged.The Third Lock Up Period ended on June 9, 2021. As a result, the Company estimates that approximately 10,482,764 shares of the Company’s common stock became eligible for sale on the public market at the open of trading on June 9, 2021, subject to restrictions set forth in the Company’s insider trading policy and under applicable law."
Wheeeeeee! Talk about a roller coaster ride from a stock! I wonder what's going on? I'm still inclined to believe some brokerage is about to issue some sort of positive research report.
FYIApollo Medical Hlgs (NASDAQ:AMEH) shares declined by 13.88% to $74.5. Trading volume for Apollo Medical Hlgs's stock is 480.9K as of 12:30 EST. This is 120.39% of its average full-day volume over the last 100 days. The market value of their outstanding shares is at $4.0 billion.
"The only thing i found was the number of ""Shorts"" went from 497k last month to 1.53M this month.ZACKS TD and Fidelity all rate AMEH #1 or strong buy.,"
MAFIA owned scam company.
Earnings out:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apollo-medical-holdings-reports-51-200500529.htmlSteady progress...finally getting past the difficulties of the merger...over 100 mil in cash and only 13 mil in a long term credit line -- easily the strongest balance sheet of any health care company out there.
"34,000 shares in the first half hour! It used to take 2-3 WEEKS to ACCUMULATE that much volume! Perhaps more important is that the spread has narrowed to what I would consider normal. Watching it drop 5 bucks isn't particularly pleasant but when you consider it went up TEN on Friday, it's hard to complain!"
please tell me what’s going on with this stock.
"Would you just LOOK at this puppy go! Been a while since I had this much fun here! Made a bundle with that last major rally, looking to do it AGAIN!"
good buying opportunity
Amazing! Gets added to an index and goes up $10.00
Easily the craziest behaving stock I've ever watched.

"From $112 to $76 , a loss of $36 in 14 days. That comes to $2.57 per day.This stock is rated a STRONG BUY everywhere I look. I think once this stock gets going the up trend will be long and steady because the selling volume has been on the light side. The base is formed, the train will be leaving soon, until then , go STEELERS tonight."

"PE and PEG look a bit high. Might be a bit of irrational optimism here, or some big inside news."
"Finally some volume coming back, spread narrowing -- that's what I like to see."
Can anyone explain this late Friday dip?
I added in 90's avg up but this can swing
8 down days in the last 10 days. This is getting old.
Barclays initiates coverage with a $92 price target!!! Should help move the stock!!
Up $4 on an overall down market day? I'll take it.
This is a bad joke
Now today is more like it---excellent volume...big move...spreads staying tight.

Not even sure what is driving this fall???
Should post really good earnings!!! Looking for a big jump!!!
"FYI........RECOMMENDATIONWe rate APOLLO MEDICAL HOLDING INC (AMEH) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positiveinvestment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. Thecompany's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financialposition with reasonable debt levels by most measures, impressive record of earnings per share growth,compelling growth in net income and good cash flow from operations. We feel its strengths outweigh thefact that the company shows low profit margins.HIGHLIGHTSAMEH's revenue growth has slightly outpaced the subsector average of 6.6%. Since the same quarter oneyear prior, revenues slightly increased by 6.6%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helpedboost the earnings per share.The debt-to-equity ratio is somewhat low, currently at 0.74, and is less than that of the subsector average,implying that there has been a relatively successful effort in the management of debt levels. Along with this,the company maintains a quick ratio of 2.85, which clearly demonstrates the ability to cover short-term cashneeds.APOLLO MEDICAL HOLDING INC reported significant earnings per share improvement in the most recentquarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positiveearnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the pastfiscal year, APOLLO MEDICAL HOLDING INC increased its bottom line by earning $1.01 versus $0.37 in theprior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($1.28 versus $1.01).The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the AmbulatoryHealth Care Services subsector average, but is less than that of the S&P 500. The net income increased by224.6% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $4.05 million to $13.15 million.Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 207.09% to $9.95 million when compared to the samequarter last year. In addition, APOLLO MEDICAL HOLDING INC has also vastly surpassed the subsectoraverage cash flow growth rate of 61.12%"
"Basically AMEH is a new company that resulted from a reverse merger with Network Medical Management back in December....120 million in cash with only 5 million in debt...likely upwards to 400 mil revenues this year...I expect at least 80-90 mil plus gross earnings...38 million shares with almost 50% owned by insiders...and:""We believe that there will be no further material investments necessary to support the new contracts in Q2 and expect that post-merger integration costs will be less in Q2 than in Q1 and the integration will be substantially completed by the end of Q2.""Traded as high as $29 immediately after the merger and fell into the doldrums likely due to lack of analyst coverage and lack of liquidity. I expect a rally back towards $30 between now and December."
Riding the 50 spot on
Some nice volume with narrowing of spread -- only 9 cents as of about noon...positive technical signs.
"AMEH is grossly undervalued compared with HCA, etc. Breakout soon: looking for $45 target!"
In at $5.75. Waiting for it to hit $30 again so I can take my profits to the bank. Have left too much on the table in the past by holding on too long.
"Yeah buddy! Finally coming back to LIFE!!! Thin trading makes it annoying but for those willing to nibble and hold, I think there'll be PROFITS ahead!"
Back to the 90's
Damn! Up almost $10? Sweet!
Looking for $83-$84 EOD!!!;
A RATING & a STRONG!! BUY!! :)

Getting Hammered
"Wow! 272,000 shares traded! For those familiar with this stock, that's about the equivalent of MSFT trading about 24 BILLION shares. Especially impressive was after enduring the painful correction, volume started to pick up towards the close and provided a $1.00 rally in the last 20 minutes of trading. I have NO idea what's going on behind the scenes, but I'm suspecting some analyst will come out with favorable coverage in the not too distant future."
"Nice rally with increasing volume and, as important, improving spreads suggesting better liquidity. Take a look at the recent buyout of Envision Heathcare (EVHC) and compare."
I have never seen a stock being so manipulated and controlled by MAFIA
"The good news is you want a light volume on a down day, its 1300hrs and the vol is only 163k."
Earnings than back to triple digits
Liquidity is much improved over what it was a month ago -- spreads are narrowed but still pretty much demand limit orders to be safe.
"Note that institutional ownership stands at only 1.63%:https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ameh/ownership-summaryAs can be seen from Friday's session, it wouldn't take much fund buying to push it towards $40."
Come back kid 10%+
Jeez! I blink a couple of times and now it's up $7???
"Very interesting news:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apollo-medical-holdings-announces-acquisition-201500123.htmlThe partner, AHMC, was founded by Jonathan Wu, M.D., PHD. That guy has done a heckuva job acquiring LA properties and making them profitable."
the option is shotting for $95
"Nobody talks here even there is a blood bath , is the stock owned only by dead computer's?"
"Sweet move on decent volume, but really needs a big increase in volume to insure liquidity and help push it higher."
AMEH is down this morning but it will not be down for long you can count on that.
