"Same story, following ellito wave perfectly. "
"anyone know whats up with the Q1 balance sheet where it states LONG TERM DEBT OF: 1,367,400 cant seem to find anything of sort in the 10-Q regarding this.. anyone know?"
This is looking promising with upcoming earnings! I do think a 38 estimated EOY is POSSIBLE!
3 upgrades !!!! $40 $38 $38
"Has anyone noticed that DBX beat earnings and raised guidance? There are hundreds of stocks with negative earnings and no guidance. Why is DBX is not getting rewarded for awesome performance? I use Dropbox everyday and love it. I feel DBX is worth much more than current levels. I'm surprised this isn't moving with the Work at Home stocks. Strong buy, I say."
"Dropbox options imply 12.9% move in share price post-earnings - TheFly""Pre-earnings options volume in Dropbox is 1.4x normal with calls leading puts 8:3. Implied volatility suggests the market is anticipating a move near 12.9%, or $3.16, after results are released. Median move over the past eight quarters is 7.0%."""
Feeling dizzy !!!
Any news for this upward push??
When can this start jumping 10 dollars at a time. :)
Steven RBC Capital Mkts resumed coverage of Dropbox with a rating of Outperform and set a new price target of $35.00 from $28.00 previouslyRgds
"So steady, Edi. Time to go, Ho! Keep believin’ Steven! Feeling goodie, woodie!"
"Reckon the stock would be at 38 level soon so the 1.3b cash note that they have got become full gain as in buy back at lower prices ie 24-30 but when payback time the stock already 38-43 and much earlier than 2024 - 25. Loan free with gain of purchase much lower.Wth, now is just expanding the product and make Links and grow and receive big cash only globally …. Actually I was thinking if china is locking down on their tech tightly, it may mean future there would be a level playing ground for the local and oversea company going forward and it would be a solid market for dbx which haven’t been in there even for a day. There are many area that Dropbox can be promoted and or expansion of the product type and bearing in mind they are not 100pct green energy already after 9month they actually act very very swiftly."
"Steven we have the upgrades from Morgan and Jefferies that's good. I don't know what's up with Goldman?...The RSI is getting overbought but not horrible, still above the 13 ema that I love. we are still in the uptrend, I'm not crazy about today's candle so we have to see how the week plays out. However, next stop 35.19ish...full speed ahead my brother..."
"Milestone another high of 32. Steven with love. Edi with wine, bald with steak and woodie with dessert. Hurrah. Can go zzzzz."
"Dropbox - This Tech Stock Is Way Too Cheap - The Motley Fool""t's overlooked, but Dropbox continues to rake in cash at an impressive rate. ... Despite the negative market sentiment, Dropbox's most recent earnings report points to a brighter future. """"With all of the cost savings, management has been left with more cash than it needs. And if a below-market valuation wasn't intriguing enough, the Dropbox board of directors just approved a $1 billion share repurchase program. This is in addition to $600 million in planned stock repurchases it announced last year but has yet to make. While stock-based compensation will offset some of these buybacks, shareholders should still benefit from some of this excess cash flow as the share count continues to drop.""""Building on a great financial year, Dropbox is also looking for new ways to grow. One of these is a new product currently in beta called Spaces. It's an attempt to become a one-stop-shop for all things involved in remote work. With virtual workforces using so many different tools and services, Spaces is hoping to be a hub where users can go to find anything and everything.""""While Spaces was initially intended to be a new feature for the traditional Dropbox workspace, management was optimistic enough to make it a totally independent product. Dropbox currently has more than 540,000 businesses using its platform, which should help speed up adoption for Spaces since so many users are already acclimated to Dropbox.""""Management also said it expects to grow through acquisitions, like its purchase of HelloSign for $230 million in cash in early 2019. CEO Drew Houston has mentioned the success this acquisition is already generating and said the company plans investments to help make HelloSign the go-to software for e-signatures.""""To wrap up 2020 Dropbox reported $491 million in free cash flow, yet only trades at a market cap of $9.3 billion or an enterprise value (market cap minus net cash) of $8.2 billion. At an enterprise value of roughly 17 times its annual cash flow, Dropbox trades at a steep discount to its cloud storage peers like Microsoft and Alphabet who both trade well above 25 times free cash flow. All in all, Dropbox is a business that's operating well and trades at an enticing price. """
First my Didi and now video games....ho what's going on?
Bald PLTR good report ?? Should break out
Woodie when are u saying this ???
Down !!! Bs
"I am going to buy this stock Monday morning. It looks solid with a lot of upside potential. I don't understand the price being where it is? This looks like an excellent value investment with limited downside risk. The cash flow of the company is second to none. Plus, they use some of the cash to buy back shares. This looks like a potential sleeping giant."
Revolve group had amazing earnings and tanked 20%.. Hope Dropbox investors will be more wise
Dbx a big deal which not so big yet.
"This situation reminds me of my experience of Twilio, I spent the entire time I was invested down. I ended up selling to put my money in Square so I made some money, but I sold around July of 2017. It is trading just under 200% higher than what I sold at a year and a half later."
Dropbox partnering with Amazon Web Services could be massive.
Dropbox is now on its inflection point with a steep rise.Let's go. $200.
"the chart looks fantastic, beautiful triangle forming... consolidation... looks llike breakout to the upside in a couple of days... higher lowes etc."

"Congratulations longs. We deserve this more than anything. Personally, I have waited 2 years for this stock to move. Technical analysis says we could see $60 this year. Maybe even $80 thanks to the purchase of docsend."
What are the odds DBX buys Box ???With Elliot and Starboard involved you never know !!!! Short term negative for DBX long term positive
"As i have been researching this company for a past couple of days, here is my point. Two things i look for a company if its gonna be successful or not? First is their business model. Dropbox is a stable company with revenue retention rate nearly record low. Their average recurring revenue is increasing every quarter alongside ARPU which is average revenue per paying user. They have a huge potential growth ahead. And after their acquisition of Hello sign and in recent quarter its upgrade towards Hello sign , the prospective toward company's management is certainly to be great.As i see every quarter, management which is my second lookout are trying their best to upgrade and innovate their design of product. In the meantime, company is investing every penny in the business. In the long run, i believe with already positive cashflow and no true non-current liabilities, they will stand out any difficult circumstances and thrive. Feel free to discuss if i miss any point."
"Ho we're back above the 50, good sign. But we have to stay here."
"Nice Earnings Report. I believe big banks will start buying DBX. This company is some of the few that is actually making money and gives guidance above estimates when many are not even giving guidance. I'm a buyer and holding till next earnings. Again, awesome earnings!"

Look like they hitting free cash flow 1 billion next year already at this rate
If Hellosign does give a 100% uptick this coming quarter and Docsend profit are in and Dropbox is Expanding once again. We are in for something...Elliot giving some news as well..... so many things to look out for. only thing is no more resignation during reporting.
Just want to clear this up for people. They wrote off goodwill of headquarters lease. They did not lose money and will save money money in the future by moving to a more work from home business model. $50 Million more over the next 12 months. The buyback will be great and with lower stock prices the better. Free cash flow was also up $100 Million YoY. Lots of tech stocks are bound for 80% corrections so it could hurt the overall market including Dropbox but this is far from a cash burner with constant shareholder dilution.
"DBX is adapting fast to remote work, excited for earnings."
"This year we will be looking for a profitable year with increasing/top line guidance, all the new or existing service improving/maturing financially ie hellosign, docsend etc , rental out premises reducing or improving profits, fcf increase substantially near to hitting 2024 target, buying or adding new services going forward to support growth, share buys back if required.One lacking is what the next vision apart from storage and collaboration. Ie other business storage and sharing energy electrical?, advert ? Engage in the front line for work with fun in combination with work collaboration and etc ? In essence something that lead the way better forward as create hype.Seems this year is riding the up only unless inflation up or market crash which unlikely."

"Dropbox Stock Looking For First Post-Earnings Pop in a Year - Schaeffer's Research""There's been a penchant for bullish bets in the options pits. The equity sports a 50-day call/put volume ratio of 5.71 at the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), which stands higher than 82% of all other readings in its annual range. This shows long calls are being picked up at a faster-than-usual pace in the past 10 weeks.""""The security averages a 8% swing, regardless of direction, the day after its last eight quarterly reports, and this time around the options pits are pricing in a much larger 14.8% shift.""""So, it's no surprise then that there's optimism among the brokerage bunch, with five of seven rating DBX a ""strong buy.""

"i've had many youtubers and podcast people talking about dropbox. i was sceptical at first, because you get free storage so why pay for it. even google drive and microsoft does it.but then i see TAM and the companies they want are buying.if the growth is growing with paid subscribers because of some feature such as docusign. dropbox might really become a giant, also the ceo wanted to buy SLACK for 1bil a few years ago but the board declined the proposition .The CEO is also the founder of dropbox and historically founder CEOs are much better than a promoted employer or a CEO from another company.im thinking of putting some money in DBX.they are butloaded on cash, and once they see a nice growth company they can buy it before the bigger companies catch their eyes on it."
Good Morning
Darn hellosign had 60 pct increase for api transaction. That is money making ones.
"100,000 shares were bought by an insider @ 24.59. Good news."
"Steven i check your point and is wrong. Google 1B users only 1M paying. Microsoft 1B users 18M paid, Dropbox 700M users almost 16M paid. But ARRP is much much higher for Dropbox and by reviews they are the best. Facts. I love to proff @steven wrong and make HO happy. =D Love you guys"
Buying for hellosign. Confident this part of the company will get noticed more. Very happy momentum is continuing.
"Dropbox is an amazing stock to buy, in my opinion, for these reasons:1. Strong revenue growth with an expected growth of 10.1% for 20212. Low forward P/E ratio of 183. The stock appears to be a much better value compared to competitor Box which trades at a forward P/E ratio of 22.94. The market for clouding computing, file sharing, remote team collaboration software and electronic signing of documents will continue to grow even after the lockdowns end, in my opinion5. Dropbox has 15.48 million paying customers so there is no customer concentration6. Both average revenue per paying user increased to $128.50 in 2020 from $123.07 in 2019 and paying users increased to 15.48 million in 2020 from 14.31 million in 20197. The Board of Directors authorized Dropbox to repurchase an additional $1 billion of its Class A common stockThe biggest issue I have with Dropbox is the companies inability to turn a profit, but I believe they will report a very nice profit in 2021. Check out my full analysis here:https://youtu.be/B1IOr9e1_-4"
"Let me read it, ho, steven here lets talk after "
"$DBX has 9 buy ratings, 1 hold rating and 1 sell rating with a consensus buy target price of $28.22. The lowest price target is $22 and the highest price target is $35. This stock is extremely undervalued. If Biden wins this stock will be worth even more. FAIR VALUE IS $26... EOY VALUE IS $30.50. Get in before warnings make this stock skyrocket. Cheers!"
Goldman’s the reason DBX pulled back Maintains Sell rating price target $29 lol
"Some analysts who looked at Dropbox late last year saw an opportunity for gains, which, even with today’s drop, have so far been realized. Today, several analysts maintained rosy outlooks in the wake of the company’s quarterly results.Macquarie analyst Sarah Hindlian reiterated an Overweight rating and a $31 price target that is just below FactSet’s average near $33. Wall Street’s consensus price target has roughly held steady since April; the company went public in March amid optimism for the demand for cloud storage services.“While the top-line upside flowed through to 2019 revenue, the profitability outlook somewhat disappointed,” wrote KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Rob Owens, who has an Overweight rating on the stock, as well as a $35 price target.And at JPMorgan, analyst Mark Murphy reiterated an Overweight rating and a $35 price target following the results. “If the company begins to convey a sustainable multiyear compounding growth rate exiting 2019, the narrative could improve materially,” he wrote."
People completely miss the growth DBX is having. Forget the cloud storage and look at hellosign. It’s going to be HUGE. I pray they don’t get bought. This company has way to much growth ahead!! $60 easy within a couple years if not sooner!!!
"Looks like we double topped and may, may! hit 29.56 ish. But it's okay because then then the new run-up will begin. "
"Down very fast, up very slowly"
Whaooo top volume at 1.8 mil. Lowest of the whole decade
Ho my new stock is going up tok fast. Didnt bought enough after i sold AMD.
Nothing to worry about. Fundamentals are stronger then ever and ticker price is going low. Maybe it makes no sense. But in a long run the ticker price will catch up the fundamentals. All you can do now is buy more shares of this undervalued company and thank me later
strong close 
Future is today !!!
"Company has no debt and outstanding balance sheet. US companies are built on debt. Fiscally responsible companies should be rewarded but are instead overlooked, symbolic of the American People as a whole it seems. Why is Docusign worth billions? this company owns Hellosign, a competitor. This is more than just cloud service.This will one day in 10-20 years after growth ends be a cash cow subscription workspace service. Highly undervalued."
"Great news for stockholders, because as a ""Virtual First"" company Dropbox can now hire better and cheaper talent outside the USA to create better services and products! In this new reality (= Gig Economy) you can also pay someone for the results, you don't have to hire him or her -> via Upwork or Fiverr. So as a result , Dropbox can make now more money and profits with better products and services and also reduce fix costs by laying off the workforce that is not needed anymore or that's to costly."
SoftBank accumulating DBX shares ??? Ho any Rumors in Asia
A couple of days like today and investor will take notice. It's amazing how a company with 4 consecutive positive earning is struggling. maintaining 20$
"Dropbox analyst commentary at William Blair (via TheFly)""Dropbox's latest moves improve risk/reward profile, says William Blair. Shares of Dropbox ""have wallowed while other software stocks have soared"" because of lingering questions around the company's competitive differentiation, and uncertainty about the success of its three recent moves: the 20% price increase for its largest subscriber tier, the New Dropbox launch on June 11, and the policy change in March creating a three-device limit for its free/basic accounts, William Blair analyst Jason Ader tells investors in a research note. The analyst, however, believes the moves, ""at the very least,"" will provide Dropbox with ""enhanced optionality"" to sales reacceleration, and thus improves the risk/reward profile of the stock. He says Dropbox trades at a ""hefty discount"" to software-as-a-service peers and keeps an Outperform rating on the name."""
Nothing but short tards here ejaculating at a 5-10% gain. My gains much higher and subject to much better tax rates lol. Might buy more at $25 if it goes there.
"DBX short interest is 7.2%. I think, shorts covering combined with the new cloud hype, e-signature buying will put this stock at $35 soon. Hold/BuyMore Longs!!"
"I mean amazing, i have nothing else to say. Amazing!!!"
Good sector to be in...will lighten up my position after our new 52 week high....and roll into verb...both have room for growth. Glta
I gonna be buying desserts soon it seems!
"I just added another few hundred shares here. My company entirely runs on Dropbox and is essential to our operations. We have the unlimited plan and are adding a couple new seats every month at this point. The fear of competition and lack of a defined moat has been overblown for too long. The reality is people who need good and efficient cloud storage for their work want to use Dropbox, and the competition (which I've tried all of at this point) doesn't come close. Good luck to all tomorrow, but if we drop I will gladly average done in bulks, as this is a clear long term winner."
"Dropbox shares look undervalued after 'good' Q3, says JPMorgan - TheFlyJPMorgan keeps an Overweight rating on the shares with a $29 price target.""JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy views Dropbox shares as undervalued following the company's ""good"" Q3 results. The stock can work as Dropbox remains on its targeted path of greater than $1B free cash flow by 2024, Murphy tells investors in a research note. He keeps an Overweight rating on the shares with a $29 price target."""

HO Hurry Up
"Between the strength of the core Dropbox customers and the remarkable growth in profitability that the company has been able to demonstrate, Dropbox's current valuation of less than 18 times its trailing-12-month free cash flow presents plenty of potential upside for shareholders. ....Ho 18 times!!!! Upside!!!!!! Steven I'm ready to break out "
Sup guys how is goinf. Soon earnings lets see that tasty FCF and buyback status.
Hope I don’t need to say bye bye to this soon.
Super speed ahead dbx !!!

DBX. Stands strong !
"So we just need next Q 250m in FCF per Q and we have 1B FCF. I dont know what to say, everything is written DBX is massive FCF machine. That is what you need from company, perfection, amazing guidance, huge cash position, growth i dont see many good deals but this is no brain. I am saying with my bodys here HO, steven, woddy, that this will be 60 dollar stock next year. Trust the process and you will be rewarded, my bigfwst mistake is i didnt bought more."
"ho, Steven, edi.... have a good weekend "
Oh Boy
"congrats on new $32 intraday high DBX and my friends Ho, Edi, Bald, Steven"
"Many stocks gained this year irrespective of the valuations and fundamentals and this did not get the appreciation that it deserves. It has been in resting phase quite for some time. I see a beautiful Falling Wedge Pattern forming since May. It could further go down to 17 range, but boy this will break out of that pattern to the upside. When overvalues stocks are sold they look for value and growth bargains. That will kick off this breakout . Forget what is happening now. I see a bright upside. This has all the fundamentals and growth potentials, cash flows lined up."
this is a stock to check once a year
"Ho you remember when i told you not to worry. 6 months ago it was only me and you here. Promoting, steven was bear but he change. Look at this beuty, on half way to the goal. This kind of stocks makw you rich. Boring stock, with big FCF, growth and all together."
"Like i said, this was expected perfectly. Consilidation to 27-28 ans then boom again towards 35-40 until end of the year. So nothing to worry. I love community here having fun eith you guys. Even nokia will corect and we will have a blast soon. Now is good time to add any of your position which you think is to low. Risk management and you will do fine. I am looking at Disca right noe, cant wait for earnings really low valuation and discvoery plus could be a bingo for this stock in next 2 years. I am happy with DBX one of my best performing stock after ET"
$33 seems impossible at this rate !!! No news No new products No New innovation oh Boy !!!!!
Ho another green day. Have a good weekend my brother.
"When this goes up 4% in one day, no one thinks twice about it... when it goes down 4% in a day the world is burning. This is the nature of volatility. This is a good company. It has low debt, makes great free cash flows, and is rolling out a vertically integrated small business platform. More importantly, I can wrap my head around the current valuation of the present value of these cash flows. If you think that this is a good thing, then relax..."
"Dropbox: This Forgotten Unicorn Is Worth Buying At The Current Price""While the valuation and the journey to profitability are the most important reasons to buy the company, there are other reasons why it makes a good investment. First, the company is still led by its founder, who retains a significant portion of the company. Research shows that companies that are led by their founders tend to do well. In addition, Salesforce (CRM) owns a significant portion of the company. In recent years, Salesforce has moved to acquire companies that it has stake on such as its acquisition of Quip. Recently, the company acquired Tableau, which it had a small ownership. While no deal has been announced yet, there is a possibility that CRM could make a bid for DBX.""Conclusion""Dropbox is a great asset-light company with an annual growth rate of above 20%. The company trades just 4 points above the IPO price. While the company faces a huge challenge on competition, I believe that investors should own a small part of the company. There is a strong path to profitability, it has excellent cash flow, its churn rate is low, the ARPU is increasing, and its valuation makes sense. Further, it is still led by its CEO, who owns a significant portion of the company and it could be an acquisition target by the likes of Salesforce. It also has a strong balance sheet, of almost $1 billion in cash and no debt.""https://seekingalpha.com/article/4274665-dropbox-forgotten-unicorn-worth-buying-current-price"
"DBX is buying back shares like crazy. The lower the price, the more shares they get off the market"
Better stay the course.
"Dropbox (DBX)""Investors will have to wait until February 18 for Dropbox to release its most recent earnings. However, if they’re anything like last quarter’s, there’s good reason to get on board. The company saw revenues rise by 14% to $487.4 million, it saw paying users rise from 14 million to 15.25 million and margins reach 80%. Dropbox is clearly useful for the mobile generation as we share more of our work from our phones.""""DBX stock makes sense not only for that reason, but also because it looks to be a great value stock. Average analyst targets put DBX shares at nearly $28, rising to a high of $37.""""Current share prices are around $22. The company also has strong free cash flows which allow it room to operate in ways cash strapped businesses cannot."""
"Drew said by bringing Dropbox, Hellosign, and docsend together, we'll be able to offer a full suite of secure, self serve products to help them manage critical document work flows from start to finish.... Hello hooooo!!!!"

"Tweezer bottom failed, next stop 27.47ish. The 200 is at 27.35. If we blow past that next next stop 26.18. Now we are currently oversold. People are buying more puts than call's. "
The Bottom line is there is no other stock that is as undervalued as DBX so why sell it makes no sense if you held it for this long maintain your position until company is bought out !!! They make money compete against the best companies in the world and still gaining market share !!! The worst case it goes back to $21 and test support before it takes out $24 $26 range which might happen on Monday volume has been increasing daily !!! Any Goldman or Bernstein upgrade easy $30 stock
Seeking Alpha “ The Rally has just started in DBX “ $55.71 price target 72% run coming
Rumours say DBX is going to beat q3 eps estimates by 50% and revenue by 25%. There best quarter to date thanks to cv19!
"It's going pretty effortlessly because we're sailing in open water, i.e. an area of no resistance, the next very significant one is the parallel from the support line that we bounced 7 times off of, and which now hovers around 21,8. A definite break through that 21.80 would be very significant for the move, again in pretty open territory, to 24. Normally a break will cause a recheck of of old resistance - new support. I would rather have have everything technically in good shape than to just move straight on to 24, but hey, no complaints either if it happens. I consider it absolutely out of the question to just run through 24 without any hesitation, there will be sellling of old hands who want to unload their shares after having waited for years, in vain, understandably, but time will prove them wrong. About time those poor ""analyst"" reports from fellows are ranked way down below in the gutter of the analyst rankings get the credit they deserve for predicting a drop in revenue in years to come."
Dbx will be acquiring another small company soon or get acquired. either way the stock price going up
It seemed like the good news in DBX wasn't getting traction for a long time. But this last week or so the stock stayed relatively immune to the selloff and continued upward momentum. I think the purchase of DocSend to compliment HelloSign is a good indicator DBX is growing that portion of the business rapidly. I am more bullish now than I was a few weeks ago. I see $30's in the near future. GLTAL
Apple news with Cloud storage today?? Someone knows something HO ??? why’s this stock dropping ????
Solid
"Loving the technical perfection of this stock. On 5/7 it left a hole on the chart between appr. 20.34 and 21.00, which on 6/11 was filled with a 3 day bullish reversal island. Very impressive, the rise is steady and healthy, which is what we want, to establish a solid base. The average volume has risen considerably since the last blowout earnings report. It is more and more included in the short list of 'corona shares' or 'work-from-home shares', and indeed it is the only one that is still reasonably priced AND is making money, finally also in GAAP numbers, which makes it a very attractive reversal share for hedgefunds, and we see that happening. Just compare with the other so-called peers, e.g. zoom's PE of 1500, gaming stocks at PE of 40 and more, Microsoft, Amazon (eternally high PE), online retailers etc. and we just have a very very solid green buy, growing at a healthy clip, without any sign of euphoria, well, more like healthy scepticism and we have a real winner. My 25 prediction was one of the easiest ones to make, ever, but I don't think we'll just be zooming over 25-26, I even hope we don't, again in the interest of a rock solid base, we don't want euphoria but a hidden gem. Leave the euphoria to phase 4, when we blow over 50. For now, in phase 1, please no holes, no hurries, no euphoria, just a steady rise. I will buy more on a pull-back to 21,55, upon which phase 2 should start. The longer phase 1 is, without pull-back, the higher we will go in the future.Breaching 26 is the heavy work, very heavy work, which should take some time to solidly work our way over. The good news is that three or four previous attempts failed, and the fourth usually succeeds, the chance for a fifth is very high. Also technical perfection.But then the path is completely open to 35 in the second wave, and 45 in the third, probably and hopefully for next year. This progression is warranted by current earnings growth and company projections.This is one of the best opportunities I've seen in decades in this game, a widely recognized pioneer stock with a generally recognized logo (valuable in itself), which is just in its infancy of things to come. I'm not making any predictions for phase 4, because that is euphoria, and who knows.There is a good chance that the company will be bought, as often happens to companies with good technology and good prospects. While not liking this scenario, it will also be a profitable proposal for existing shareholders.The more fundamental story is one of deep integration of Dropbox Cloud Services throughout the Microsoft Windows, IOS and Android platforms, with all the technological options of working in groups, lots of attention to privacy and security, provided by a company that is no ones competitor and is beyond any reproach as to its being subject to state bodies, like intelligence services, and hacks. All the technical capabilities are there, including the overly hyped signing service (Docusign 30 billion cap for much less intrinsic capabilities, versus Dropbox, which has a similar signing service and much more, with a market cap of under 10 billion). It doesn't matter where you look, it's all win win win... It's even hard to believe, but hidden gems do exist, and the time is ripe, never mind those 5 dollars you've missed, there's at least 25 more to come within 1 to 2 years."

Hmmm this breakout from 31-32 range is taking toooo long.
I only hold 2 stocks. One is DBX currently priced at $25 (intrinsic value $45) and SUPN $30 (intrinsic value $120). You can guess which position is the bigger one ;)
"I am reading here and i can see 95% of them have no idea what is happening with dropbox.They gona buyback tons of shares, they are adding 300k new suscribers every quarter, amount payed by user increased, they are going in remote working which will enable them to understand and improve there products becouse they will see what is the best way to use it. Revenue growing, FCF is massive, and now watch when they buy 500m in bitcoin just to show off. Tell me few opportunities like this in the market."
Ho can you give DBX a little  c’mon man you gave up !!! Or did you sell your shares

Market anticipating lockup expiration is the reason for the decline. Once that's out of the way and we see how many shares are sold then the stock will go up. Till then it's a guessing game....prob trade within a 27-29 range.

"Always been a fan of the company. Invested today. Strong revenue rises, beat 3/4 earnings so far for 2020. 2021 expects record revenue and earnings per share. Record cash at the end of 2019 annum, as well as massively increasing their total assets. Liquidity is low (meaning debt isn't a worry in the slightest). Great value too, the company has only improved and bolstered its cash position since the IPO and 2018 peak price. This is a really good value buy, especially with cloud computing hitting record numbers across all the tech companies for their recent financial releases. Why do you think it might be undervalued?"

WOW! Just bought shares this morning of Dropbox. First time I’ve ever been lucky in my life . I have the intention of keeping Dropbox until it has a market cap similar to docusign. What’s everyone’s price target for Dropbox 12 months from now?

Turning green baby.... strong close 
Boring day with Dropbox.
super solid. raises FY guidance again and a ton of buybacks still coming. $40s soon then breakout to new highs. Could see $50s EOY on short squeeze
"When I recommend Dropbox to my friends, I always get the same response: oh, it won't be able to compete with MS' Onedrive, Google Drive, Amazon aws or any other of the many contenders in the pure cloud space. My first answer is: that does not matter, what matters is whether the company is growing profits AND customer numbers and/or profits per customer, and it is doing all of that surely and steadily in hard times, while wearing COVID-armour. But of course, customers will always compare, so we don't need to sidestep the comparison issue either. Just listen to the professionals, many independent business owners and individuals, (like me) who, well aware of the alternatives, have made a positive choice for Dropbox. You can check this on many professional software sites, such as softwareadvice dot com, where dropbox gets 16633 review, and a rating of no less than 4.51/5. Enough to convince me that there is much more to the services than the average users, or the average wall street analyst, understand. Just scan through the reviews and the picture becomes clear: the users love the service and will remain faithful, essentially, for their lifetimes. And BTW there are 232 products in the so-called ""collaboration software"" space. Slack, Trello and Dropbox are the only 3 players in this league of 15K+ reviews (meaning that the many other cloud and collaboration players have not hit the professional services sector, but will remain in the eternally loss-making or not IPO'd untradeable private user section). Slack is making huge losses and trying to buy its way into profits, risky strategy. Trello is privately owned, like many other cloud companies. All three get similar scores. So why is loss-making Slack with say 15 million users , adding 100K users per quarter (say 25% growth/year), worth 17,5 billion versus the 9,5 billion for a famous world player and pioneering Dropbox with 600 millon users and a PAYING user growth of 300K users per quarter, to now 14,6 million PAYING users, out of a free using customer base of 600 million, each of which can become a subscriber at any moment. Net earnings is now well in the green and growing really fast and durable for the foreseeable future. Incomprehensible.Another thing that astounds me is Dropbox' position in some so-called dedicated funds, like the Global X Cloud Computing ETF, ticker CLOU, where it is only at ranks 20th and which turns out not be be so dedicated, as their top 10 are actually less of pure cloud players than DBX. They will need to play catch up to already big owner players with substantial positions like Blackrock, Vanguard, Renaissance etc. Finally just a quick technical note: any gaps will be closed, that is how much this share is still NOT a darling of Wall Street, and often it seems, of its own management. So I foresee a range of 23-26 for the coming months and don't expect peaks over 26 to be long lasting for now, I expect that for next year, and 35 end of next year. You don't need to be a user of Dropbox to be positioned for that. Final note: if you don't have it, get it. If you have it, think long and hard whether the other shares you own will do better and are more COVID-resistant, and later on democrats/election/politics/dictator/lockdown-resistant, if that is another thing you are afraid of and is in the card one way or another. I have done my thinking and bought well under todays price in the runup to the earning. AVG Wall Street target 27."

"This market is absolutely insane and doesn't adhere to any fundamental valuations, momentum nor technical analysis. It's almost entirely driven by ""memes"". Back in the day when I first started 24 years ago, we used to have human traders that reasoned and traded based on fundamental and technical analysis. Now it's mostly algorithmic programs that drive short-term trading decisions, and while there are still large real money investors that base their investment decisions on fundamentals, they are primarily buy and hold shops that stay pretty close to their benchmarks. But there are now a lot more levered money today than back in 1997 using algorithms via their prime brokers that seem to perpetuate these wild, nonsensical swings in the market.Yesterday I sold 80% of my position after-hours near 25.50, but the 20% that I kept wiped out a pretty big chunk of my profit. Thankfully, I was able to buy back my 80% at some ridiculously cheap level this morning and recover all of my loss and add some gain. I will say that it has gotten much more challenging to be a short-term swing trader in recent years, despite advances in technology and zero commissions because it's nearly impossible to make any sense of short-term price actions. Does anyone else that's been around the block few times like myself feel this way?"

I am anticipating a current PE based on my expectation of earnings for 2021 of 17. That seems incredibly low. I would anticipate PE's in the 40 range, which get us 52 fairly easily.

"not too far in the past, this was a $20 stock. i like these slow money  , it teaches gratitude and appreciation  to see the hard work you put in."
"Good for Dropbox - Google is killing off free unlimited storage in Google Photos next year""Google has announced that it is ending its unlimited free photo and video storage through Google Photos. On June 1, 2021, users will be capped at 15 GB of free 'high quality' photo storage per account. This change will take place alongside additional changes with Google Drive's storage programs, including counting Google Workspace documents and spreadsheets against the same cap. Google will also begin deleting data from inactive accounts (accounts that haven't logged in for at least two years).""https://blog.google/products/photos/storage-policy-update/https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"
"Dropbox: Substantial Upside Remains, Even After Rally - Seeking Alpha- Shares look undeniably cheap at just ~4.3x forward revenue.- Driving additional enthusiasm for the stock is hopes that Dropbox might be acquired- Even standalone, Dropbox is a fantastic business with growing revenue and rich cash flow margins.- Workforce reductions to improve margins and cash flow""Yet whether or not Dropbox gets acquired, I think its most recent fundamentals show an incredibly vibrant company that will improve its margins even further after it slims down its workforce. Additionally, the stock's valuation - among the cheapest in enterprise software - shouldn't be ignored.""""Over recent years, Dropbox has transformed itself from primarily a consumer-oriented tool to becoming a bona fide enterprise software platform. Teams converge on Dropbox not only to store, but to collaborate on their files - a tool that has become indispensable in the remote-work era. """"A key point I want to stress, however, is that the bullish thesis for Dropbox does not depend on an acquisition. In my view, Dropbox is performing incredibly well on its own.""""A number of potential acquirers to Dropbox have been floated, but I think Oracle (ORCL) would be one of the most likely - since both Salesforce and Oracle follow a similar grow-via-M&A playbook.""""Beyond the enterprise applicability, Dropbox's base of 15+ million retail users is also incredibly attractive - as I mentioned before, despite being a large enterprise software company, Microsoft still prizes its consumer hardware and gaming divisions. Buying Dropbox would be a good way for a primarily enterprise-driven company to instantly gain a built-in base of consumer users.""""In spite of solid standalone fundamental strength plus the possibility of an acquisition, Dropbox remains incredibly modestly valued. At current share prices near $25, Dropbox has a market cap of $10.27 billion. After netting off the $1.22 billion of cash on its most recent balance sheet, Dropbox's resulting enterprise value is $9.04 billion.""""This represents a valuation multiple of just 4.3x EV/FY21 revenue, based on Wall Street's current consensus revenue expectations of $2.11 billion (+10% y/y) for the current year. And if we assume a 24% cash flow margin on that revenue (tied to Dropbox's YTD FCF), Dropbox's resulting FCF multiple also looks cheap at 17.9x EV/FY21 expected FCF.""""All in all, this is a great value stock to pick up for your portfolio. Keep riding the upward momentum here."""
"We have still to run guys, i think next year we will have 1B FCF, not in 2024 in 2023. Why is that i was trying to get some numbers in or DBX get 2M more paid users, or they repurchase a lot of shares or they do both. I think they gona do both. My question is if they can get a huye companys to start using DBX so they can beat BOX. Becouse looking at people who use DBX they are saying is the best and is sticky, you dont wanna change it is same like buying iphone. After you have it you dont change it, this is why DBX is so good. I belive next year big catalyst will happen and stock will shoot in arround 50+ dollar. I dont know why I also have a felling meaby someone will like to buy DBX and pay huge premium for it. Imagine some company's here which are not profitable and there mutliple is so inflated and then you have FCF machine eith this valuation. This was the best pick in early 2021 it will outperfomer all the stocks in next 2 years. My 2 cents, shout out to my boys HO, steven, Mudy and bald. "
"William Blair analyst Jason Ader, remains bullish (Outperform rating) on the stock - via Barron's""William Blair analyst Jason Ader, who has an Outperform rating on Dropbox shares, said in a research note that the announcements “underscore that Dropbox’s business is in a transitional state, in that Dropbox is moving from a roughly 20% grower to a roughly 10% grower as the business prioritizes margins and free cash flow.”""But Ader remains bullish on the stock. “Our view remains that the importance and stickiness of Dropbox’s technology is underappreciated, especially as a workplace hub storing business critical content and facilitating team collaboration on that content - at a time when those capabilities are more critical than ever,” he wrote."""
Wth it just don’t get to break 33 isn’t it.
"We had a wonderful runup from 17,5 to 32,5, breaking through multi-year resistances, the long RSI is at a healthy 52, I would prefer to see it even lower, long running averages are still pointing upward, all is pointing to the next leg up to 35 after this correction, and then summiting to the all-time high at 43.5. Meanwhile, it's finally correction time, I think a pullback to 28.5 or even lower down to 27 is possible and would be absolutely healthy. Meanwhile the sublet of the Seattle property is very welcome news, haven't had much lately...I'm just holding, this is going further up and I don't see many alternatives out there, it is way my largest position and my best performer, as it should be."
Every time I want to take profit the stock goes even higher lol. I guess I will just hold at avg $19.89 or average up
I have a good feeling about earnings. I feel like a lot of colleges and universities have invested in Dropbox’s services for their students in preparation for online learning. Zoom as well.
Slow and Steady!
"Increased my options stake for the 23.5c Friday, the 15th. Thinking we will get close to 25"
Dropbox has increased their revenue each quarter for 14 straight quarters going back to Q1 2017. Not one down quarter in the past 4 years.
"Finally! My original 2017 or 18 (can’t remember) is finally in the green. Been a long time. All purchases in 2020 up with two close to 70%, would be nice to now see the original make some gains. That tested my patience!!"
Who’s ready for the squeeze
Unbelievable
Sell sell sell
Ultimate warrior say dropbox is up !!!!!
Full speed ahead.... I'll take 2 percent a day every day....up up and away 
I'll be happy with an EPS of .40 or better
"Akos asks ""Can we see 100$ a share in 3-5 years or it's too far fetched?""I think the short-term 6 m consensus (or hope) over here is 30, 40 being well within possibility in a year, 60 possible within a year or more. Few dare to dream of 100 because we would need to see serious growth acceleration, current mentality remaining the same. However, the wild card is that the market is very speculative overall and if we start applying the 40x income metrics to this share (as is done to Docusign, for less justification many of us would argue than to Dropbox) as a capitalisation estimate, then dropbox is easily worth 60 billion right now, and that would justify a price of around 180USD RIGHT NOW. However, that is far from the current mindset on Wall Street and it's going to take time, much time, before they are ready to go along with what we currently believe. We are seeing the beginning of the Robin Hood movement (read YouTubers and social media hypsters) starting to take notice and that ball can roll all the way up the mountain in a much shorter time than any of us more analytics minded investors dare hope or believe."
DBX is currently undervalued. Increased estimates are a sign of things to come. Expect the stock to approach $30 per share within the next 2-4 months.
Roku gets a downgrade and is up 12%. DBX gets multiple upgrades and drops 8%. WTH?
interesting read for cloud business
why does this stock move so slow
they raised guidance on all aspects of their business again. Buyout coming if the price doesn't increase to fair valuation. FB or ADBE please buyout
Might have to dump it today can’t hold Gaines
"Docusign is priced at $43 billion and Dropbox only $8 billion? And Dropbox has hellosign not to mention everything else? Are we missing something here about Dropbox or is the market missing many things about Dropbox? In my mind this company stock can explode at any time like a docusign, Snapchat, Pinterest, zoom, etc. It’s so undervalued and management feels that reiterating more buybacks through to Q1 2021"
Bought 400 shares today. Excited to see where this is at a year from now.
investing is easy now. I just buy what rob buys.
"Buying again when it drops to 26 region...bet we had a dead cat bounce...the stock market is very tricky now...think there will be another drop down...but that's just my gut feeling, of course :)"
"Nice run, the cheapest growth-tech stock in this hype market."
DBX is a text book buy and hold. Strong fundamentals and consistent revenue growth quarter after quarter. Only a matter of time it explodes upward if management keeps executing like this.
"Good morning folks, as I said last week ""DBX is the sleeping giant"".....$30+ by January. This company has very solid financials.....positive cash flow."
"Buyback program. They completed the 600M repurchase program approved last year in Q1 2021, and now they have a new program approved during Q1 2021 for another repurchase of 1B. Question, where do you think the share price will be after they repurchase 1B $ of value in shares? I bet not at 25 anymore.. this power will work along with the 8% short interest that will have to reduce, I would imagine, as consequence of this activity and SP spike even more. 2021 is time for DBX to shine!"
