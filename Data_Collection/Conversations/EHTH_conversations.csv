"I am first time buyer at 80This stock really does have good potential and can easily go to 120 in a month and 150 in 3-4 monthsToday, it was just targeted by short seller to buy at cheap prices"
"Nightmare stock controlled by the futures contingency... Good product, good company, good consecutivequarterlies... PPS DOES NOT reflect legitimate value in the market place... Sold my strong BFYT positionto acquire this #$%$.. Shorts are laughing all the way to the bank on this one... Can't get out soon enoughas Longs are allergic to this company."
So as I stated a target of $45 and now that it hit right on spot; why not lower it a tad and grab some shares around $40. Let’s go get em tiger…..

Why is this down so hard when revenues and income beat zack’s expectations?
They stated the retention team has been keeping 90% of the people trying to cancel (inbound call). They used to send the call to a sales team. Now the call goes to the retention team and they keep 9 out of 10 as a customer. This change will be very impactful as they go into Medicare enrollment next Q.
Analysts Barclays Buy $150 Citigroup is Buy $135 Why is down so much?
"+17% revenue expected in 2021 WITHOUT considering the positive impact of HIG $225M, so basically that increase is a very conservative guidance"
"Analyst Actions: Jefferies Raises eHealth's Price Target to $165 From $135, Maintains Outperform RatingNow...........Jefferies or Muddy Waters...........Jefferies any day!!!!!!!!!"
"My prediction: next week we will trade between $72 - $80. Then the first week of November will be a crazy week - elections then EVER and SLQT earnings in the same week. The stock could go to $65 again or to $90 by Nov. 6 - the day after SLQT earnings. For me being in at $65, that is a great risk/reward.This stock will likely trade lower as Wall Street hates uncertainty and the election is basically 50-50% at this point. The real polls showing a tight race. A blowout by Biden or Trump is better for the market - we don't need another Gore/Bush election where the results drag on into the courts. Regardless, long term, this trade will be around $100 come Jan 1, 2021 and trade at $150 by Jan, 2020. $76 is still a great entry point if you can stomach the swings."
"HIIQ and EHTH are in the same business, but where is the value?Compare revenue growth and profitability of HIIQ with EHTH -- Click Yahoo ""Financials"" tab and scroll down to the little graph...Then compare the Price/Sales ratios and the P/E ratios (Yahoo ""Statistics tab"")HIIQ is a steal, Q3 will be good, Q4 will be blow out. You know why if you follow this industry cycle.Shorts overplayed their hand on HIIQ. Short thesis was debunked by FTC.GLTA"
What a nightmare.
"The company has a total or 25 million shares and reportedly 110 percent institutionally owned. now 2 million is ""short"" interest... how will they get share to cover this in time? Do you think the institutions who bought shares for months at over $100 is going to report to their clients that they are no down $30 a share when they can easily push this up with such low float? The shorts are going to get squashed here."
Check out the Form 4 released about an hour ago.... CEO bought 50K shares in the last 3 days. Nothing shows more confidence in a stock than when the CEO lays down $3M of his own cash. I expect a gap up tomorrow and close at or above $80.
"I should have learned the last three times. I have purchased twice around 80 and twice around 67. Made fast easy money both times at 67 and at 80... weeks of frustration. As soon as I get close to even on this one I might have to close the book on this turd. When the share price is wholly controlled by shorts, and no new buyers are coming in to buy a CLEARLY valuable and growing company, something is wrong with the market."
"Not sure if action the last couple of days constitutes “blood running in the street”, but am taking advantage and still buying little by little, adding to my calls as well. Stay strong! You will be rewarded. GLTA"

"According to a company filing, HEC bought 1.5 million outstanding shares of eHealth (EHTH), and now holds a 5.8% stake in the company. This is double the 750,501 shares of eHealth, which HEC held at the end of December last year."
Hold strong guys! Third straight days of generalize losses but this stock isn’t loosing as much as some big names that have been doing well lately. We will see great upside once market rally!
"Hope the CEO buys another 50,000 shares. It helped so much the last time."
Analyst on Bloomberg just said stock should be up not down ...some people misunderstand the report ...should be green by morning
What’s the catch here?! Something is strange and I can’t find the reason for the big drop
"Earning on April 29th.Last earnings caused stocks to loose 45%, any thoughts on how this release could be ?"
what's going on?
Can someone (other than a distorting short) explain the valuation difference between $EHTH and $HIIQ. If HIIQ were valued the same it would be at $210 (not $21). 10X! Measure EHTH HIIQP/E 46 4.5Price/sales 8 0.8
"And for those blaming the drop in SP on shorts, the float is only 12.29%. This was an insider sell-off after a small increase past the resistance price. Hopefully the SEC looks into it."
Been following this stock and invested heavy past 6 months. I'm not sure why this thing pops and can't hold for more than an hour. Maybe it's new range is 60-80s and going above 100 is in my dreams. I will hold though
-7% on what?
This stock is going to be the best stock I ever bought. Going to $120 by next earnings report
"Down 3 out of the last 4 days on very low volume, looking like a good setup for a bounce. If it gets below $82 it'll be pretty hard to resist buying back in"
"We’re in a lull, so sold some of my earlier double down today at 75; as expected now the in the 72’s, rinse and repeat...keeping majority of long and calls, will keep playing the rinse and repeat cycle, don’t want to miss the inevitable spike likely coming soon. GLTA"
"The 4th quarter results were not good compared to GUIDANCE they had issued earlier in the year. They still pulled in more revenue and earnings than 2019, in a very challenging year. It may still drop next week but all in all this a good and profitable company. A near 40% drop is oversold in my view. Started my position today by adding at $52 and at the end of the day at $48. Will add more on any drops next week accordingly."
Director Dale Wolf purchased 2000 shares today at 71.06. His last purchase was on Sept 19th 2019 at 82.10. Always nice seeing the insiders buying when the price drops so low.
feel good going in to earnings.
Hahahaha. My post from 3 months ago is coming true. > $50 is a great buy…..
Zacks put out an article saying EHealth is arguably the strongest player in one of the best positioned industries 40 minutes ago... and it immediately crashes 2% lol.
. Let’s take this down to $35’ish.
Where is Benjo today as he was waiting for 20$ to buy?

"For those who worry about the COO resignation and the churn look at this: Steven Halper of Cantor Fitzgerald put price target of $185.00 6 days ago with this comment: “eHealth COO departure not cause for concern” Steven says he spoke eHealth regarding the resignation of COO David Francis and learned that the departure was entirely voluntary and is not at all related to any performance issues. While investors concern regarding elevated churn remain, management will be successful in its remediation efforts, Halper tells investors in research note. The analyst is not worried about Francis departure or eHealth’s ability to reduce churn and execute on its long-term growth strategy."
"People can say and focus on whatever they want. I see 4 successive earnings beats, upward projected forecasts and 25% CAGR. This drop is an opportunity. But it will take more than a few days to get back to where we were. $100 by 9/1. Watch this thing take off like a rocket ship after the 8/22 options expire. Shorts are gaming this. Good for them - its working. But for us, we should be averaging down. This is an OPPORTUNITY."

"Ok, I’m guessing today is again the time to buy the beginning of the “repeat” after the recent “rinse”....wish me luck, lol"
Rinse and repeat—near buy level?
"Btw, in the past this has been a powder keg to the upside, but likely due to short covering. I don’t have any numbers on current short ratio, but right now seems like a good entry point if anyone is wondering when to get in. GLTA"
Why the sudden drop?
A lot of share holders got scammed with some fake short stories in the past 6 months.
"I got in at $65 after hours yesterday and here's why I'm excited:- At $65 the market cap is $1.6 billion. 2021 revenue predictions are $1.1 billion for 2021 and $1.4 billion for 2020. The company's growing at 40-50% revenue should be at 4 times revenue. Stock price should at $150+ right now and would still have a significant upside. - I listened to the CC and the churn rate has been addressed - the numbers today are still based on significant carryover. See earlier posts for the numerous issues regarding churn that have been fixed. - $65 put the PE at 12 for 2021 and 8 for 2022. I think these are conservative numbers. The stock should be trading at a 40-50 P/E right now or 1 PEG. That tells me the stock price could be 5 times higher in two years ($300+). - Next Q is the only Q that really matters for the year - AEP. It will be a blowout Q and start the rise to $300.The risks? 1. Biden wins and the Democrats sweep the House and Senate and they push some Single-Payer program that replaces Medicare with a government-run program. This is very unlikely. What is more likely? If Biden wins, he lowers the age to 60 to get on medicare and also puts people in poverty on Medicare - a HUGE win for EHTH. Last night's debate likely sealed the election for Trump, but I see Biden at 50-50% to win. 2. Walmart. They are the elephant in the room. But EHTH has an existing partnership. I could easily see Walmart buy EHTH. We'll have to wait and see, but at this moment Walmart is a benefit to EHTH."
Does anyone know why this is taking off this morning? Was it just the Marketwatch article (conveniently not picked up by Yahoo Finance)
"EHTH CEO: ""We're looking forward to another record enrollment season in the fourth quarter,"" said eHealth CEO Scott Flanders. ""Achieving our internal agent hiring goals and rolling out our new agent compensation model makes me even more confident in our ability to meet and potentially surpass our sales and retention targets this AEP."" On September 10thhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/ehealth-achieves-internal-medicare-sales-200300353.html"
"CEO Scott Flanders buys 50,000 shares today 8-5-20 at 71.54. Director Dale Wolf bought 2,000 shares 7-31-20 at 71.06. The insiders have bought 3.75 million in stock in the last week. There have been ZERO insider sales since the last at 110.24 on 7-14-20. Shorts will burn soon."
"Up 16% since my $65 entry point after hours today. I was hoping we would close back above $80, but the future looks great. It's now time to look forward to SLQT, EVER, and GOCO to post earnings. I expect all to do extremely well. EHTH's fundamentals are the best of the four and I'm also in on SLQT because they have the best cash position. Other than that EHTH and SLQT are roughly growing the same with EHTH at a better valuation. I suspect we will see a stimulus deal next week. Stimulus then amazing earnings from the other three are what we need to drive EHTH back to $90."
eHealth is down 5.22% to 44.84
Whoever is buying this is obviously new to the stock. Anyone following this over the past year knows it goes down more than it goes up.
I hope David at MW got creamed today. But I doubt he did.Muddy started leaking their negative report on Tuesday as witnessed by the drop from the open of 136 to 116 at the close. Clearly some of Mud Waters clients were trading on advanced information Tuesday. Then David goes on CNBC early on Wednesday to say he is short. Stock drops to 95. I'm sure David and his best clients covered Wednesday morning for a $40 per share profit. He should be arrested and the Muddy Waters shut down.
"I can't understand how EHTH announces 600 million in revenue in 2020 when it made almost 200 million in the first half, does that mean it expects to make more than 400 million in the second half ??"

As a whole EHealth is generating robust revenue and as it executes process improvements, it will eliminate waste and be come more efficient with its business model execution."
Morgan Stanley just upgrade it to 110 a share gl to everyone ..we gonna see more upgrades by tomorrow
RSI is showing oversold even at the $76 bounce from $64 and we are $25 below the 50 day moving average. Just need a few analysts to come out in support of the stock and we are back to $82.
glad I nibbled this morning pre-market and got in at $68.70. The drop seems overdone.
PE at 13. very undervalued. Churn rates is fixed by changing agent comp. Not a very hard thing to do and i'm sure the company already has implemented a new comp schedule for internal agents. One that rewards renewals.

"Trading the call options has been the best way to make money on EHTH. I've been making some nice profits buying and selling the Feb 19 $90 calls the last few weeks (was trading the $85 Jan calls for a while). It's clear to me that EHTH has support at $70 and resistance at $75 - I make my entry/exits based on the RSI near these levels. We should see this range for another month until it then spikes back to $80+ into earnings. Make no mistake, earnings are going to be earth-shattering for EHTH, SLQT, GOCO, and EVER - each company did record hiring going into this year's Medicare enrollment period, and with COVID, a record number of people are buying their plans online. You will want some exposure to this sector going into Feb's earnings."

Shorts shorts where are you ?? See you again shorting when we fly past $60 this week.
"It will be interesting to see if institutional money surges into EHTH into the close...which isn't typical after a plunge like yesterday. It usually takes them 2-3 days, when the volume subsides somewhat, to make their move to bid the stock up. If we do see a spike into the close, we could see EHTH $10+ per share higher before the end of this week."
it will reach 50 $ soon
The earnings didn’t uncover anything new than was already disclosed. The focus was now how the problems were corrected and are now bearing fruit
Prediction for today?
"Just dropping in to check on sentiment, looks like a lot of folks are still believers here, IMHO I would hold out until about $40 to buy. I would only buy higher if the next two earnings are blowouts."

Not much resistance after that to the 200 day moving average at 94, but don’t see that kind of movement until after earnings, but you never know. Happy holidays to all!"
We will close above $80 this week. Mark my post
"Time to Short the Shorts: With such a large short interest in EHTH, if everyone bought 10 shares or more we can generate a short squeeze event, and drive the stock back to a more respectable price target relative to its true value. Customer churn and retention have been successfully addressed with effective policies, procedures, and training. Yes, there is no reason for a sell off. The CEO just bought 50,000 shares because he could not resist the intrinsic value of this significant organization. The shorts tried in vain to drive this stock below 70, but failed dramatically today. I think EHTH is now attracting a lot of value investors. I just bought 1000 shares earlier today."

"I owned a health insurance agency for several years and we represented many companies like E-Health does. We always tried to get our clients the best rates so we would occasionally move them from one company to another. This saved them money but it also paid us better commissions. The commission scale on many health policies for agents pays an up front commission and then annual renewal commissions. The initial commission (maybe 10%) is always a lot greater than the annual renewals (maybe 2%). Renewals sometimes only go for a a few years after signup and end so the policy is bringing no income to the agent. The CEO said that a lot of the churning was done by them. This is why they do it, to save customers cost which keeps the customer longer and to increase income. This churning happens in every health agency and other forms of insurance too."
Went down because the full year guidance but should recover guidance wasn’t that bad just keep buying while still down will recover in one hour
Strong aftermarket! Good momentum going into tomorrow
"Wow! 50% drop From $114 down to $72 in four days? We all know it's worth more than that. I'm surprised the smart money doesn't squeeze the shorts out. Ehth is Oversold for sure.

The execs should come out and address the concerns or risk more pain. I'm waiting to buy, hopefully I didn't miss out."
"No one knows what will happen at the right side of the chart. What we do know is that the EHTH is oversold on the weekly chart and the atr value is about $73.00. The stock has been trading in a tight range prior to the sell off and after the sell off again trading a tight range. That appear to be a spring. Longer the spring the better. Today the stock is up nearly 5% even with some negative news , if you want to call it that. Consensus price for the stock reduced to $78, with the analysts projecting a 27% growth in revenue, which is nearly in-line with the previous 28%. As of now the stock is up nearly 5%. I like to fish the edges. I got in a couple of days ago because I like buying at wholesale and not retail. What does Warren Buffett say, When there is blood in the streets you buy.

"Chin up! There'll be light at the end of the tunnel. So many companies whose stock is going down are facing financial trouble or even a high risk of bankruptcy.

Relax guys . all the health care related stocks are down today. Nothing wrong with Ehealth. this should be back up with the sector whenever that happens
"I'm confused, can someone bring guidance? If the $225M invested by HIG Capital represent close to 8% of eHealth's common stock (refer to Seeking Alpha news), this would imply a $2.8Billion valuation, currently is trading at close to 50% of value. Any help on where I'm missing will be appreciated."

It works BOTH ways, so the excuseof CHURN as a leading component of declining PPS is just another false conclusion to push the stocklower by the powers that be..."
"Yeah, The Cramer interview was informative. The CEO did a pretty good job of explaining how he is addressing issues. But the issues were probably new information to many, not fully informed investors. Hence the sell off. The churn is a BIG question mark going forward and will have to be reduced."

"What do you guys think of Q3 report prospects? How much do they have to reduce churn to get investors reassured? Allegedly, the management just started forming a retention team, so Q3 figures may show just a slight improvement in the churn issue. Will a few percent be enough to keep the share price on the uptrend? Guess we may only see a significant decrease in churn in Q4 report. What do you reckon?"
"Gotta say, this is absolutely bizarre. Can't remember seeing any other stock act like this after beating estimates."

I'm not gonna get too excited but this looks GREAT. Everyone who stayed in and have gotten beat up for days - congratulations. Your patience and steely resolve will be rewarded. It wasnt easy and my own confidence faltered at times. But this is the start of the rebound. I'm calling $100 by 9/1
"Great quarterly results, incredibly healthy financials, solid growth. Amazing bargain."
Load up more and more before we fly past $60 this week. Life time opportunity as it got beaten down by 50 percent last week and below 2017 price. Shorts squeeze coming in next 2 days.
"The earnings call can only be a surprise on the upside, all bad news are out now. Hopefully they say they corrected the rep sales performance and see upside already in the last month of January."
Hey! Anyone knows the reason for last year's price drop? From August to October it got slashed by 50%

Who’s shorting this??
Added more shares today with whatever was left of my PPP loan and have a total of 135700 shares. I'll take it to 150k if it falls further.
How does $HIIQ forward P/E Ratio of 3.8 make any sense?$EHTH forward P/E is 31.5 (8X more!)Shorts have oversold HIIQ.
I bought 20000 shares today
"Strong buy @ 69-70. Next open will be of importance, if you manage get in, its technical indicators are very promising. If tommorow the momentum is good, next week might make a solid recovery (>73). Currently holding @ 70 expecting to get out @ 73-74+ before elections."
"This stock is a steal at this price. Solid company with solid earnings. It is an online health insurance brokerage and they produce income like clockwork. I used to own a health agency. They receive an initial higher commission (maybe 10%) to sell you the policy and then much lower renewal commissions (maybe 2%) on your policy for a few years after that. Eventually, renewals end. This is why they move customers around from one carrier to another. To save the customer money on a policy with a lower rate and to earn that initial 10% commission again and keep renewals coming. The CEO said the churning was mainly done by them and this is why. It greatly increases income to the individual agent and the agency. The misunderstanding the public has about his comments is a great blessing for all of us who get to buy at this price. Nothing has changed with the solid financials of this company and look below at the analyst's estimates. If you want the price to go up faster, share this information with others. This is an awesome buy on a solid company.E-Health Analyst Rating ConsensusStrong BuyBased on 12 Analyst Ratings10 Buy2 Hold0 SellBased on 12 Wall Street analysts offering stock ratings for Ehealth in the last 3 months (by analysts ranked 0 to 5 stars).Analyst Price Target on EHTH$139.00▲ (103.57% Upside)Based on 12 analysts offering 12 month price targets for Ehealth in the last 3 months.

By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 52.7.

Instead selling added more@71. I think today is reversal day. Just good thinking

"What happens with health insurance recently explains:From one hand many Americans lost they health insurance when they lost they jobs, also Covid risk of insurers clam, but on the other hand there is much more good News, “online” health insurance jump to all time high, more people that never had H/I now conceder to get health insurance, many people’s didn’t go to doctors visit because the Covid which insurance companies saved a lot of money, Many Covid treatment news is coming and government help for people without insurance"
4K shares sold red drops it .40 but a 7k green buy right after only raises it .04. MAJOR manipulation.
"NO NEW MONEY coming in... This issue has been fleeced by short manipulation... Good company, greatproduct, excellent exposure, strong ascending quarterlies, and the PPS continues to decline... No explanation that is available to the public... Hence, no new money coming in to offset the ""in the know""crowd, pushing the PPS lower...

"Closing statement from CEO Southwell on Mondays conference call, ""As we mentioned on the last call, 2019 is an important transition year for us as we broaden out our product mix and diversify our offering.

Currently, we're executing on multiple growth initiatives, and we look forward to providing further updates as we continue to build and grow. ""My opinion, time to further crush $EHTH"
Typical breather....if 77 holds we march back up
Hold is the key  of success in stock market.
I inadvertently got stuck on a long option on EHTH Paid 12 for the 78 target when it was in the money at 74 back a month or so ago. Decided it was worth buying and are the loss at expiration by buying all my shares and holding to 2021. Just to cover the $12 loss on the premium but I did my studies. This could be a 140 position in a year. Glad i made the decision.
I'd like to see a close above 72 today. That would be a nice retrace to get the momentum rolling in our favor

"At ~ $65 a share, I think EHTH represents an asymmetric risk/reward opportunity and an opportunity to buy shares that are possibly artificially depressed. On April 29th, EHTH had their earnings call and had overwhelmingly positive results. On April 30th, their price jump 10% and then on that same day, see their stock price drop back down to close to its open price. I believe that the stock price didn't stay up because of lingering negative sentiment from the Muddy Waters Report (especially around the accounting, which is overblown), and possibly HIG Capital who might be pushing the stock price down so that they can convert their preferred stock to equity in more favorable terms."
"This company has more than doubled its revenue in just 2.5 years. It should be considered a growth stock! The stock price fell because the CEO made a comment that was construed as negativity during a conference call, but it was actually a positive statement. He acknowledged that management had an issue regarding retention and that they fixed it, so why on earth has the stock price fallen? This is a strong buy! The price will be back up over 100 within a year."
Bought 500 more shares. What a discount!!! Thanks shorts!
Expecting a run up before earnings. Stock is worth a minimum $70 so I'm in for 100 shares at this price.
Burned $96M in cash in the quarter -- collected a whopping $66M in actual cash commission revenues. No wonder they did the deal with HIG on such egregious terms -- they are out of money within the year if the deal doesn't close given that operations are expected to burn another $100M. Worst accounting EVER!
"weird. No SEC filing, no news, press releases."
"It looks like the past 75 minutes price is being manipulated by the mm, down volume outstripped up. Interesting enough we are near opposite this time yesterday as we are showing -33041 down volume vs. yesterday at a +33782"
"Avg of analysts price target sentiment is $78.64. High of $120+. Even if these (the avg) are high by 10%, you’re talking about a 40% return. Let’s not forget the CEO bought $3.5M worth of this stock at $71.54 in Aug. You gotta think he’s looking for a positive return on this investment..."

Another solid outting today in another red market. This thing might hit triple digits before Q3 results!
"Yesterday HIIQ announced Q4 Medicare sales of 47K. So question is: how many leads did they sell? This is short term cash and near term opportunity. Next question is, how are other sales going? We know HIIQ did not expect Medicare to be more than 35% in Q4. Regardless, HIIQ has successfully launched a sizable Medicare business straight out of the gate.$EHTH is valued at 5X Rev. Buyouts in the space are in same range. Yet HIIQ is 1X Rev. Amazingly undervalued. Glad the Board is working on this!"
Impressive bounce at the end of trading... hopefully an indicator of what’s to come!
Bought 10000 shares
HIG Capital buys at $108 per share and seizes control of the company
Bought 500 in the $70.5-72.5 range today. Have plenty of reserves to buy more if it keeps creeping down. GLTA
CFO states they count churn as people switching policies even if it is on their platform. Stop focusing on churn - SLQT does NOT count that as churn. EHTH is just counting it differently.
After thinking twice about it. Being < $50 is great but new  now is $45. Let’s go get em tiger….
"80+ on Friday, short day, but guaranteed! Congrats to all holding"
It's clear to me Wall Street has left this stock for dead until they prove the churn rate issue is resolved in the next earnings call. Could run a week before earnings but even that is in doubt.
"I’m not sure why anyone would risk buying or keeping this stock if they haven’t read their entire balance sheet. Once Muddy Waters tweeted the report on Luckin, I knew it was time to do much more research. I did my due diligence and sold that stock. Their message board on Yahoo was filled with the same type of angry comments from posters that I see here. They should have opened up their mind to the possibility that MW was right. It’s business. Treat it as such."
choppy seas ahead gentlemen. I'm still very interested to see what happens after the 8/22 options expire. Maybe we'll get a slight respite from the manipulators...

"Wow, I've been waiting to buy this stock and getting orders filled below $65 after hours! They killed earnings and heading into Medicare enrollment. Loving these prices!"
"It's been on my radar for a year. Looking at the latest quarterly, yeah... no growth and the stock has become quite expensive despite hitting new lows..."
Hold strong guys! These weak hands will regret their move just like those who left last at $60 before it went to $146 and just like those who left after last ER and saw the price jump 25% after the drop!
"Rallies tend to be long, steady and broad, sell offs tend to be quick and fierce. When we are at the top everyone is complacent and panic takes hold when not enough shares can be sold at a given price. Price action is a leading indicator. Look at the price action on the daily chart and ask your self what do see? Does it look like recently ehth price fell off a cliff or not? It does to me. And what usually happens is the weak hands surrendered their stock to the stronger group. Who come in buy at wholesale. Do you want to buy at wholesale or do you want to pay full MSRP?"
man this is a pretty drastic market sell off today. NASDAQ down 4% in first 90 mins... Hope this doesnt continue

13% drop in 24hrs with no rational basis. Someone want to try and explain that to me?
I am a first time buyer at 80. Good luck to all longs!
Puts are on the menu. Chart looks terrible for longs
"Unless I am misreading this Chief Accounting Officer (Pierantoni John) filed SEC Form 4 purchasing 5,000 and 1,332 shares in mid 80s price. Which is 13 days ago. Why would you buy nearly half a million $ shares if you weren’t confident in your earnings?"
"Absolute Garbage Stock... Look at the declining volume over the past several weeks... NO NEWMONEY coming in... Short manipulation which reeks of automated trading... Makes one wonderwhat the 4th quarter of 2020 is going to look like... Appears to me, the PPS has little correlationwith the actual performance of the company... Then again, judging by the declining/stagnatingPPS, maybe those who orchestrate DO KNOW what the 4th quarter earnings report is going tolook like and have set their PUTS accordingly... And before ANYONE accuses me of attemptingto discourage any new money from coming in, as I have stated in prior posts, this issue is thelargest I hold in a rather substantial portfolio (and my avg. PPS is $98.00) ! I hope these postsfind their way to SOMEONE in management who can generate a truthful PRESS RELEASE or forward looking statement which could make this issue appeal to MORE THAN THE OPTIONSTRADERS... Doesn't anybody INVEST ANYMORE ???"
Have to admit; was totally off on today. Thought it was gonna plunge. Please  keep it up!
"EHTH just filed with SEC to offer up to 500,000 shares as an employee benefit, with cost basis about $63 dollars for them"

IM so done. Lets get into the 60s so I can average down and get out the next time its mid 70s. My money will be used better elsewhere.
