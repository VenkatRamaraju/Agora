Can anyone explain what these guys do? I have looked at the 10-k and see the jargon but still have no idea what they have. Are they similar to Salesforce?
"I jumped in on this at $144.20, too good of a report to selloff that much."
still under radar
"270,000 employees with a market cap of 8 billion. I dont think I've ever seen that many people working together for so low a value."

This has been a fun one to trade. I can't help but give some credit to this platform though that helped me find ideal spots to buy and sell. And their free training resources are just awesome https://stockhaul.today/vrqt4x

"Dividends, repurchase program, double digit organic growth, low valuation. This is like investing wet dream"
"Board is dead, stock rocketing. Love it."
"Perhaps if they missed earnings we'd be in the green today? This market is a joke. Good results are punished, bad results get pumped."
numbers looked very good. so far very blahzay reaction. wait for CC before open and listen to that.
"$cnxc reported a good quarter and its down 7%; any interpretations of that reaction? was it already baked into the stock, and people just taking profits (makes me wonder about an entry point actually lol, i digress) in short are we in for a similar reaction with $snx ? Or do we fill the gap from $130 and march upwards? bullish but Im looking for others insight as to how the next 24hrs plays out, crystal ball anyone?"
Very very undervalued.
CNXC reached an all time high at 121.70
Perfect investment. Love both SNX and CNXC and adding some more shares. Still very undervalued
"interesting credz on this pony... awaiting 12th eyes open, glasses on"
