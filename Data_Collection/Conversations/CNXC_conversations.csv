PVHO could be the biggest growth play of the 2016. I get that this post looks like spam but do start own research and you will see. PVHO already has over 1Mil in revenue plus major contracts with huge national brands. Intel is even on board with this one â€“ just check the latest PR. Do your research before PVHO takes off.
Concentrix Corporation is down 4.95% to 149.37
"Board is dead, stock rocketing. Love it."
Are you kidding me? Stellar results
CNXC reached an all time high at 115.86
Very very undervalued.
Can anyone explain what these guys do? I have looked at the 10-k and see the jargon but still have no idea what they have. Are they similar to Salesforce?
This has been a fun one to trade. I can't help but give some credit to this platform though that helped me find ideal spots to buy and sell. And their free training resources are just awesome https://stockhaul.today/vrqt4x
"Perhaps if they missed earnings we'd be in the green today? This market is a joke. Good results are punished, bad results get pumped."
Up nicely just before earnings!
"$cnxc reported a good quarter and its down 7%; any interpretations of that reaction? was it already baked into the stock, and people just taking profits (makes me wonder about an entry point actually lol, i digress) in short are we in for a similar reaction with $snx ? Or do we fill the gap from $130 and march upwards? bullish but Im looking for others insight as to how the next 24hrs plays out, crystal ball anyone?"
numbers looked very good. so far very blahzay reaction. wait for CC before open and listen to that.
CNXC reached an all time high at 120.41
CNX Coal missed EPS by 3 cents reporting $0.21. Revenue of $69.81M was down 14.3% beating by $9.96M $CNXC
A nice dip to buy in but still an undeserving pullback for this solid company
50% gain and nobody cares. Let's go baby to my $200 PT
CNXC reached an all time high at 118.20
I honestly don't see Trump treating coal any worse than obama did and we're heading into the winter. They're already calling for some real cold winter weather in the north. The only way is up from here.

why are we in a sell off... are the shorts hitting us hard?
"interesting credz on this pony... awaiting 12th eyes open, glasses on"
"I jumped in on this at $144.20, too good of a report to selloff that much."
Concentrix is up 4.99% to 159.59
still under radar
Perfect investment. Love both SNX and CNXC and adding some more shares. Still very undervalued
"Dividends, repurchase program, double digit organic growth, low valuation. This is like investing wet dream"
This stock is like a referendum on Donald Trump's chances.
"Hi guys. Do you believe in this paper? What is your percentage of the portfolio? Who is following the changes in the state, I heard they had some disagreements with SNX?"
Concentrix is down 4.98% to 149.06
CNXC reached an all time high at 121.70

"270,000 employees with a market cap of 8 billion. I dont think I've ever seen that many people working together for so low a value."
