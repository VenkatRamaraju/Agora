EPS announced August 2. Beat Wall Street estimates. Revenues a little light.
FInally some rationality on the price of this thing. Crazy valuation even without any possible accounting trickery.
"Well not that anybody is paying attention to this stock, but at a price of $948 per share I would expect some kind of dividend. Apparently I haven't seen one. Maybe not the best investment, although of course in the last 6 months you would have made good money. Can't imagine you can do that again at this price."
