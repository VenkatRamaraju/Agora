"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"
Why are Hedge Funds afraid to short this stock? It looks like the ideal the candidate for shorting.
"Grrrr,,, $1675.... come on, increase that $9B debt and buy back more shares......."
Everybody is talking about inflation and rate hike. This means AZO will have to pay more interest for its $8 Billion debt. AZO stock will have to go down to earth.
"With unlimited QE, Fed keeps printing money and giving it to companies. Looks like this will never change as otherwise US can go bankrupt and collapse. So the only reason companies like AZO are afloat right now is Fed's relentless printing."
any insights about earnings tomorrow? tank or rise?
