Nothing new in the pipeline. Showing profit by cost-cutting and downsizing.
"Colgate ($CL) will release earnings on Friday, October 29th. Just picked up 5k worth of stock shares last week (in time for a tooth aching Halloween and holiday season lol) and I'm excited to see where this stock moves. RSI is currently in favor of a bullish two months leading up to the New Year, where their stock has peaked in almost every year of the past two decades. Peace and trade on my friends!"
Don't be fooled with the Stock price rising. It's going up as to the Dow and nothing to do Innovation. What was once a People company has transformed into a Clean House which clears out it's Older workers.
"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #4 - HR is busy with this Woke Corporate System...as Colgate is 100% on board. Video Training on new policy's this year. You Retirees would be Fired for actions of the past. Now we are dealing with today's Woke policy's that has infiltrated Corporate America . From a HR Power Point..""Our Purpose - We are Colgate, a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and out planet."""
"Why even bother with acquisitions? :“Notes: (1) The impact of the previously disclosed acquisition of the hello oral care business on as reported volume was 0.5% for North America and 0.0% for Total Company, Total CP Products and Developed Markets. “"
I think CL Mgt is buying back shares to keep the price above $75. Today both Clorox and P&G dropped more than CL
Will buy for $71 at earnings
Someone is buying a lot of calls at 80 today
"How do we interpret this repetitive comment in today’s almost non-existent inflation environment?-“Adjusted gross profit margin of 59% declined 20 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, driven by escalated raw and packaging material expenses, including foreign-currency transaction costs.”And hw is this the result of the years of restructuring? -“Operating margin was mainly impacted by a decline in gross margin and 30-bps rise in adjusted selling, general & administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales.”"
"The recent dip in share price has taken this to a price where it's about $10 less than a double over the prior 10 years. The strength and consistency in their profitability metrics tell me they're still a great company, but I think it may be time to shake things up a bit (acquisition, new product lines, anything really). I don't currently own shares, but may start a position around $59 if/when it gets there."
What a beautiful stock and great long term buy at $73
"Well ,I was listening to the annual meeting on line, and the only good thing that I heard was that the shareholder gift bags were being donated to first responders in NY and NJ.Other than that, they really screened the questions at the Q&A. I know a few shareholders who asked some hard questions on line and they passed over them. They can not do that with an on site meeting. The biggest misstatement from Nolan on the question why is Colgate Toothpaste made in Mexico. He said some toothpaste skus were made in Mexico. To be honest he should had said Most toothpaste cases are coming up from Mexico.I do not think I will waste an hour of my time on line listening to management patting themselves on the back next year Note to all the shareholders who keep wishing to a higher stock price ...Forgetaboutit ....CL is a widow stock. You buy it for the steady dividends and not for capital gains. Be happy with stock price between 60 and 65. Sell when there is a surge over $70 buy back on the dip"
Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #7: Colgate is Celebrating National Coming Out Day. CCO Paula Davis and ERG lead Andre W Marlins are kicking off this event. Colgate has a number of Videos on this subject for the Employees to take. My Question....Why does sexuality even have a platform in any workplace? Best Place to Work!!!!
"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #3 - This comes from a Retiree on the status of Colgate stores...""Confirmed the decision taken is to close permanently the store for retirees."" I can confirm Piscataway and New York stores have been removed. One of the stores at a Planet has been removed. As the Employee online ordering (with 6.50 flat rate shipping) is ONLY available for current employees. So the Retirees are viewed as #$%$"
Price up more than 1.25% but volume is low - nobody selling? CL has been a VERY good investment for me over the past 30 years.
Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #8: Today we are discussing Colgate's Path to get the employees to the office with a Email that we just got:From the Chief HR Officer: Our site will continue enhanced cleaning protocols and heath screenings. We also plan to restrict office capacity to 25% to ensure proper social distancing and will increase that percentage as COVID-19 infection rates in the community decline. BLA BLA BLA....We Strongly encourage those who can get vaccinated to do so in consultation with your doctor. Bla Bla Bla....Colgate is like a Deck of Cards..They fold easy when being challenged Legally. Once someone gets COVID...they will send everyone home. Do what J&J and Merck are doing....Those who are not Vaccinated get tested every week and you have until December 30th to get vaccinated after that you are fired.
"Just recently added these stocks to my portfolio . . . ready for big gains:$CL - Colgate (Oral Healthcare & Dental Products): $75.5- Earnings on Oct.29th, just in time to release forward-looking statements for the holiday season including Halloween when their revenue typically spikes higher.$CRON - Cronos (Cannabis & CBD) $5.8- Vote taking place in November regarding the Federal legalization of Cannabis. $CTEK - CynergisTek INC (Cyber Security) $1.79- Recent contracts including one with a US based federal credit union$DPLS - DarkPulse INC (Laser Technology and AI Systems) $0.085- More of a long-term play here, because I truly believe this stock could reach well over $1 in the next year. Riskier than my other stocks, but you've gotta risk it for the biscuit, period."
Hedge fund Alden Capital owns the Chicago Tribune! These are the desperate lengths they are going to get YOUR shares! Don’t let them win! #MSOGang Long $GTII $TRUL $CL $JUSH $PLTH $NGW
So much for matching charitable contributions from retirees. Not that what they did was a very generous list.
Stock market is up...and CP is down...I wonder what's going on??? Overvalued? No breakout products? Let's just ride the roller coaster and buy with the Dips. Still cannot find Softsoap foam.
What is going on why lower
Way over sold.
Buy at $75
Gotta be some bad news rumors about this Fri earnings
Limit order set at $75
I guess I was not the only one disappointed last Friday after Colgate's annual meeting. Stock way down today.Cook does not care. He got the board to make him very rich at the expense of shareholders
"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #6 - With Uncle Joe forcing Companies with 100 more Employees to be vaccinated...A Survey went out this Summer to ""Fish"" as to the Employee would be comfortable on returning to the office. As Colgate is a ""Woke Corporate Company"" let's see in the months how this will be handled. The return date keeps on being pushed which is fine as most are on the couch cashing Easy checks."
"""Market Watch"" Colgate-Palmolive Co. CL, +0.03% said Friday it had net income of $578 million, or 67 cents a share, in the third quarter, up from $523 million, or 60 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding a 4 cents charge relating to a cost-cutting program, the company's EPS came to 71 cents, a penny ahead of the 70 cents FactSet consensus. Sales rose 2% to $3.928 billion, just below the FactSet consensus of $3.946 billion. Chief Executive Noel Wallace said the company is focused on growth and will continue to innovate in its core businesses, pursue adjacent categories and expand into new markets. The company retained its leading share of the global toothpaste market at 41.2% in the year to date, he said. Colgate is still expecting full-year sales to be flat to up in the low single digits, and expects EPS of be down in low single digits."
$CL ...4% up in price in 5 years .....ummmm
"In line with today's events...CP is celebrating the national ""Coming Out"" Day. Two events at CP....Email sent out from Noel. In other news...CP fro YTD at 5%???"
Airlines and cruise lines are going to skyrocket. Inevitable. People are going to travel. Business will travel. Might sell off some of my slow burn tech stocks to get on this and $CL know we will see $aal at $45-50 by mid 2021 and $CCL same story.We all knew travel would be the last to rise from the grave.Double down folks
"Very brief annual meeting today. Missing the free danishes and the gift bags. Not really, but I miss not talking to the Colgate people before the meeting ,the executives and rank and file plus retirees. Noel did address my question when I asked if the CL buy back at the all time high price and if they would give the shareholders a detailed report on the buy back program on the cost basis. He promised to address the report. If not, I will remind him next year. I rather see them pay down debt instead of a buy back."
anybody thinks this goes lower
"Well Well Noel. Ian was a lousy CEO and Your not far from this. This Company is so Lost in my 30+yrs as it's sad to say this. The employees have no direction from Sr. Leadership as in pass years. Why the disconnection?....Your Leadership and your direct reports. When the Old Timers leave no transfer of knowledge takes place. We have been walking on Egg Shells in Piscataway, Park Ave, Hills for 8+yrs. We know whats in the Flash Report and the earners for 10/29....Sad to see CP as another Company that does not care for it's people....Great Place to Work Right?"
"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #5 - With this weeks past storm in NJ area...You would think CP management would have sent an Email to ask about it's employees well-being? Nope...nothing...You CP Lemmings that bleed Colgate Red in your veins...What a Joke of a Company....Oh we care, We are all together as a Company...Cry me a river.....As HR would say....Best Place to Work!!!!"
"My question at the next shareholders meeting will be: is CL is still borrowing $$$ to buy back stock now or will you wait until the stock hits $60. Since the meeting will remotely like last year, they will not address the question. WHO KNOWS, The stock may be under $60 by May."
Today's earnings call....Way to go Noel...
