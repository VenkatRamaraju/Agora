Things are looking better. I'll predict 76.75 year end. GLTA
Buy at $75
I am assuming that Cook will anone next Friday at the annual.shareholders meeting a stock buy back. That is the only option he has to bring the stock price back over $70 a share. Not a bad thing If they bring back oversea profits under the new tax code. BAD thing if they borrow the money.Yesterday a new 52 week low.Great Job Park Avenue
"Market goes up...So does CP...CP has Missed out on increasing the Production Line. Since we are cheap, having additional equipment is laughably. How about moving the gear out of Piscataway to help the supply chain?"
OK you CP Lemmings...Let's talk about the 25Yr Club. Will this continue once the Company opens up? Since the average age is 60+ and we all know Colgate works on the side of caution...I say it's done for being On-Site. Heck...No Retire Portal to order Colgate products. What a Caring Company that you were lead into believing (10-20yrs ago yes). Welcome to the New Order.
Another lovely day at CP. B.S. meetings and Service Awards for what? What's going on with Consumer Goods stock?
"As I’ve said before, all the GGEP’s are meaningless unless there are growth engines at workAnd now it SEEMS the new acquisitions might be the right approach and hopefully the new management gets it and doesn’t stop half wayFor now, good job Noel!!"
Never owned CL until today. 2019 looks like a year to be in defensive stocks. T and XOM also look good to me here. All 3 of these stocks are dividend aristocrats meaning they have increased their dividend each year for over 25 years.
"Unileaver most likely to make offer here, cash and stock valued at 95 to 100"
Also it will make it take over target.I see a merger announcement by the May annual meeting
"Hold! Buy on the dip... Trian Partners accumilating CL, something's up!"
X DIV DAY COMING
Wonder why it keeps inching higher. I would like to think that something good is actually in the works. I am a bit skeptical based on the last few years.
So much for matching charitable contributions from retirees. Not that what they did was a very generous list.
"This is a great stock to buy when it dips and hold long term. It may be boring and low growth, but it’s one of just three stocks I own that are up year to date."
"Came close to selling. Glad I did not. Soon to be in the low 90s, EOY."
"Was a blip today at $71.04....Had a call at $71 and Sold 500 shares...Another 500 set for $72. Need to cut down on this Grandma stock and move into my higher performing ETF's,"

CL should announce its annual dividend increase this week.Estimates show a two cent per Q increase to 0.42.
Limit order set at $75
CL is down 4.90% to 79.43
Were has everyone gone? I hope you investors have Proxy Voted...I have. The earnings call should be uplifting to the shareholders to how Colgate is delivering core company values to the World in this time of need. Beats listing to IT weekly rally.
"We received the quarterly results with a terrible forecast for 2019. Same excuses time after time. These Centers of Excellence that were created are not working. The company has removed and isolated itself with these centers from the consumers, the customers and from suppliers and vendors.Time for new management and a return to the way business was done under Mark. Cook and is cronies must go."
I figure with the Large Group IT Webcast yesterday...I see another VERP and GGEP in the horizon. Would also see a Cut in raises and bonuses for 2021. All companies will be reviewing it's placement of staff.
I Love these inter-office video updates....The We Care messages and all one....Check Please!!!!

Today is CP Ethical presentation call. You would think the annual Code of Conduct would cover this? But in today's environment Colgate needs to CYA and present the subject by itself. Worker Moral is don't ask and don't tell...If you do then your marked.
"Since last earnings report...Shares have lost about 1.1% in that time frame, under-performing the S&P 500. A few articles to when Colgate will ""Break-Out"" of this cycle. With the New Year soon...Maybe start ""Innovating again""??? With it's knowledgeable work force being forced out (OH...GGEP)..Life at Colgate(US anyway) is bleak."
After hours $78.22. Have a limit sell order at $80. Maybe it will hit next week
Stock is in a free fall.
Check out my analysis on $CL:https://ericthomson.substack.com/p/colgate-palmolive-company-cl?r=fgeno&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy
"The recent dip in share price has taken this to a price where it's about $10 less than a double over the prior 10 years. The strength and consistency in their profitability metrics tell me they're still a great company, but I think it may be time to shake things up a bit (acquisition, new product lines, anything really). I don't currently own shares, but may start a position around $59 if/when it gets there."
"What are roller coaster we are on. Up one day, down the next. Anyway Cook should retire this year and we will see what Justin will do with the stock and company."
I don't get how investors are paying 25 times earnings for a staples company that hardly has any growth.
May 8 is the annual meeting. Going to miss not getting a goodie bag on the way out as this year the meeting is just on line. Sad.
Funny when the Market moves CP also moves. Not today as the market is near 4%. Hey Noel...Were can I buy Softsoap Foam?
"Nice Report Noel....Brace yourself....The Titanic is here...People who work in the Labs do know what's in the Pipe Line...And it's not much. Reformations, Reformations...Add a brush here and take a oz here. Your not being told The Truth...We are being run by Time Share managers."
CL is over priced. I got out Friday at 52 week high close to high of the day. Will look to get back in lower
Cresco Labs had the Top US Brand in Q4 of 2020 as shown in source below.

"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #5 - With this weeks past storm in NJ area...You would think CP management would have sent an Email to ask about it's employees well-being? Nope...nothing...You CP Lemmings that bleed Colgate Red in your veins...What a Joke of a Company....Oh we care, We are all together as a Company...Cry me a river.....As HR would say....Best Place to Work!!!!"
I think CL Mgt is buying back shares to keep the price above $75. Today both Clorox and P&G dropped more than CL
Happy New Year you CP lemmings. Nice way to start the New Year with the stock dropping. Seems the New administration is NOT business friendly? We be to China though. Once at $78-80 then Buy.
Well...Now it's September 15th to go back into the office. I am sure HR and Management are putting a list as well as other companies to WACK people by this year. On the other hand it's been a vacation so why not.
"Reaching out to the CP Kool Aid drinkers....What was the latest ""Break Out"" product we have had in 3yrs? or even in 5yrs?"
Too bad Mgt did not split the stock at 80+.
Nearing all time TOP.....over valued and overbought.......this should below ALL the analysts targets of $68!!!!!!!!!!!!
Price up more than 1.25% but volume is low - nobody selling? CL has been a VERY good investment for me over the past 30 years.
"A publicly announcement 2/23/21 on a Board of Director at Colgate ""Dr. Helene D. Gayle"" has also been appointment to Palo Alto Networks Board of Directors. Some history at CP..In 2012 ""Nikesh Arora"" was a VP at Google and in 2018 became CEO of Palo Alto Networks. Colgate infrastructure had changed during Nikesh tender selecting Google, then additional infrastructure change using Palo Alto. Talk about ""The Fix is In""- with such close business relationships arouses suspicion of product bias when selecting our infrastructure...integrity must be foremost, not links to ""Friends and Family."""
"Colgate ($CL) will release earnings on Friday, October 29th. Just picked up 5k worth of stock shares last week (in time for a tooth aching Halloween and holiday season lol) and I'm excited to see where this stock moves. RSI is currently in favor of a bullish two months leading up to the New Year, where their stock has peaked in almost every year of the past two decades. Peace and trade on my friends!"
Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #8: Today we are discussing Colgate's Path to get the employees to the office with a Email that we just got:From the Chief HR Officer: Our site will continue enhanced cleaning protocols and heath screenings. We also plan to restrict office capacity to 25% to ensure proper social distancing and will increase that percentage as COVID-19 infection rates in the community decline. BLA BLA BLA....We Strongly encourage those who can get vaccinated to do so in consultation with your doctor. Bla Bla Bla....Colgate is like a Deck of Cards..They fold easy when being challenged Legally. Once someone gets COVID...they will send everyone home. Do what J&J and Merck are doing....Those who are not Vaccinated get tested every week and you have until December 30th to get vaccinated after that you are fired.
Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #7: Colgate is Celebrating National Coming Out Day. CCO Paula Davis and ERG lead Andre W Marlins are kicking off this event. Colgate has a number of Videos on this subject for the Employees to take. My Question....Why does sexuality even have a platform in any workplace? Best Place to Work!!!!
"Cl over $69 today. See the history. Peeks twice a year, before the annual meeting and before Christmas In December Has to be something with senior executives bonuses"
"2018 was a bad year for CL. Hopefully with new management 2019 will be better.The Jets got rid of their coach, now the time to changes coaches at CL.We do not want to see CL turn into a GE, do we???"
Colgate-Palmolive reached an all time high at 81.91
"We are a roll, a downward roll until $60 ."
What I find unfathomable is that more than 30 thou employees with no pension plan are relying on their numerous shares of CL in their 401k’s while top mgmt is helplessly watching the co’s value disappear day by day...Seems like an acquisition is foregone conclusion - no one is interested in a non-growing business
Don't be fooled with the Stock price rising. It's going up as to the Dow and nothing to do Innovation. What was once a People company has transformed into a Clean House which clears out it's Older workers.
"So today a friend called and CP sent out the end of year Retiree letter. Chief DE&I Officer..Diversity, Equity and Inclusion which we knew...But what is funny...""We are more committed then ever to strengthening our communities and our own culture, ensuring each individual at Colgate feels empowered, encouraged and inspired to be themselves and achieve their best"". Follow-up on this tomorrow. Let me get the Kleenex."
$CL ...4% up in price in 5 years .....ummmm
when will the stocks split
They need Buybacks as the only way to increase EPS YoY
This stock has not really done anything since its split 5 years ago. Maybe it's time to liquidate and move on.
"3rd Quarter Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2020 – 8:30 a.m. ET...It's show time again...The beauty is a shell game that I must listen to...I miss the 11:00AM calls we used to have. Talking with R&D...Nothing going on so let's Ride the stock market."
"""Market Watch"" Colgate-Palmolive Co. CL, +0.03% said Friday it had net income of $578 million, or 67 cents a share, in the third quarter, up from $523 million, or 60 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding a 4 cents charge relating to a cost-cutting program, the company's EPS came to 71 cents, a penny ahead of the 70 cents FactSet consensus. Sales rose 2% to $3.928 billion, just below the FactSet consensus of $3.946 billion. Chief Executive Noel Wallace said the company is focused on growth and will continue to innovate in its core businesses, pursue adjacent categories and expand into new markets. The company retained its leading share of the global toothpaste market at 41.2% in the year to date, he said. Colgate is still expecting full-year sales to be flat to up in the low single digits, and expects EPS of be down in low single digits."
The new tax code will allow CP to bring home a boat load of money to buy back stock and increase the dividends
great strategic company that is well managed. I'm buying more on the next dip!
What's going on Colgate???? How about buying a Electric toothbrush company (quip would be nice to have)? Since we cannot develop a reliable product...as with Hum being a gimmicky product to begin with. Oh BTW..that Hum cardboard display sign is of Low quality compared to P&G.
"The range on a CL share should be at $60 to $65. Any valuation North of $65 is an over reaction to a heated market. But be happy with your shares $$ as long as it does not fall below $60 and enjoy the dividends. It was a widow stock for God's sake. Now if management continues to buy high value and high margin companies and they leave these companies alone the stock true worth may increase.After all,except for Hills, the dish and other soap products are at the end of their life cycle. The deodorant business in America is almost not existing, and the oral lines in still riding the coat tales of the original Total brand that is no more.Buy high margin and innovating companies, let them alone to contribute to the bottom line and CL will do well. Integrate them into the old CL method of doing business and see them fade away like Murphy Oil Soap, Mennan and a host of other brands that CL killed off."
"Just recently added these stocks to my portfolio . . . ready for big gains:$CL - Colgate (Oral Healthcare & Dental Products): $75.5- Earnings on Oct.29th, just in time to release forward-looking statements for the holiday season including Halloween when their revenue typically spikes higher.$CRON - Cronos (Cannabis & CBD) $5.8- Vote taking place in November regarding the Federal legalization of Cannabis. $CTEK - CynergisTek INC (Cyber Security) $1.79- Recent contracts including one with a US based federal credit union$DPLS - DarkPulse INC (Laser Technology and AI Systems) $0.085- More of a long-term play here, because I truly believe this stock could reach well over $1 in the next year. Riskier than my other stocks, but you've gotta risk it for the biscuit, period."
thanks to Zack's for the 'Strong Sell' rec last week -up about 11% from the low.
Anyone watched Options Action on Friday? The analysts trounced CL Shares with target price of $62 !
"Well,third qtr results are out and the stock value is tanking in Orenmarket. Same reasoning as in past for poor performance. There's too much complacency. This is not only international company facing similar problems. They have had same problems for over 5 years and have done nothing to rectify. Maybe change is in order."
"Well Well Noel. Ian was a lousy CEO and Your not far from this. This Company is so Lost in my 30+yrs as it's sad to say this. The employees have no direction from Sr. Leadership as in pass years. Why the disconnection?....Your Leadership and your direct reports. When the Old Timers leave no transfer of knowledge takes place. We have been walking on Egg Shells in Piscataway, Park Ave, Hills for 8+yrs. We know whats in the Flash Report and the earners for 10/29....Sad to see CP as another Company that does not care for it's people....Great Place to Work Right?"
"$GTII reported beastly earnings. This week comes the other big three. $CURA $CL $TRUL. Show me the $$$$$Then there is $IAN... No mention of even releasing their Q3 earnings. Will likely take the Covid extension. Guess we won't see them until the new year, if ever. #classiciAnthus ...and they will say it's in the best interest of the shareholders "
Will buy for $71 at earnings
congrats on the 52 week low - should get the wheels turning.
"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #6 - With Uncle Joe forcing Companies with 100 more Employees to be vaccinated...A Survey went out this Summer to ""Fish"" as to the Employee would be comfortable on returning to the office. As Colgate is a ""Woke Corporate Company"" let's see in the months how this will be handled. The return date keeps on being pushed which is fine as most are on the couch cashing Easy checks."
"The only good thing to say about the stock, it is up $1.34 from the 52 week low. Good job Cook,... bazinga, as Sheldon Lee Cooper would say."
"CL is going to be bought out within a month. But remember, you didn't hear that from me."
"Well ,I was listening to the annual meeting on line, and the only good thing that I heard was that the shareholder gift bags were being donated to first responders in NY and NJ.Other than that, they really screened the questions at the Q&A. I know a few shareholders who asked some hard questions on line and they passed over them. They can not do that with an on site meeting. The biggest misstatement from Nolan on the question why is Colgate Toothpaste made in Mexico. He said some toothpaste skus were made in Mexico. To be honest he should had said Most toothpaste cases are coming up from Mexico.I do not think I will waste an hour of my time on line listening to management patting themselves on the back next year Note to all the shareholders who keep wishing to a higher stock price ...Forgetaboutit ....CL is a widow stock. You buy it for the steady dividends and not for capital gains. Be happy with stock price between 60 and 65. Sell when there is a surge over $70 buy back on the dip"
Nothing new in the pipeline. Showing profit by cost-cutting and downsizing.
Gotta be some bad news rumors about this Fri earnings
"With the news that Noel Wallace and Justin have been promoted, give me hope that Cook will soon retire. Noel and Justin can breath new life into CL and perhaps find a buyer"
"How do we interpret this repetitive comment in today’s almost non-existent inflation environment?-“Adjusted gross profit margin of 59% declined 20 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, driven by escalated raw and packaging material expenses, including foreign-currency transaction costs.”And hw is this the result of the years of restructuring? -“Operating margin was mainly impacted by a decline in gross margin and 30-bps rise in adjusted selling, general & administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales.”"
"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #2. Yesterday we received a Email on returning to the Office...This has moved to October 18, 2021. This difficult decision was made in response to the ongoing rise in COVID-19 cases and the continued spread of the more contagious Delta variant.....blah blah blah."
Stock has a lot more to fall. It yields less than US10Y. This is a terrible sign.
Not familiar with product line they just announced for purchase. Article mentioned it is a premium line.Hope they did not over pay.
Is there another downgrade?

What a beautiful stock and great long term buy at $73
"At $67.50 a share I started to sell some, not all, of my CL shares. I will be watching and I may sell some more.Just my opinion but I do not see any growth opportunities with this stock under the current leadership. They have bled this company dried"
I do not think we will see an increase in the dividend in 2019. Cl will need the money to shore up it balance sheet and pay bills.
CL is down -4.90% to 73.52
"Great Financial New From Colgate In The 4th Quarter!!!!!Now what I really can not wait to see is the first quarter of 2020 financials.If I see the continue positive numbers in April great. If I see a decline ,than I know the 4th quarter 2019 was smoke and mirrors ""mortgaging the 1st quarter"" to improve 4th quarter numbers.How do hope they have turned the corners"
In the Piscataway office this week and the Phones were taken out. Only Management has phones....Everyone else should be using Cisco PC Phone. One way to save $$$'s.

We received a Email yesterday that April 1st back to the office is now pushed to Sept. 7th. We are encouraged to consult with your DR. for getting the COVID shot. The only way Colgate or any company will have it's people back is to roll up the arm for the COVID-19 shot. It is nice to be on vacation since March 2020...And I am not the only one in the company that is milking this one out. In other News this Friday earnings report....Hey Noel...Were can I buy Softsoap foam?
I have the same bar of Palmolive soap on my sink that I've used every day for the last 10 years. The Palmolive soap that I buy now lasts maybe 2 weeks in the shower. Engineered obsolescence?

News for Today....Just got a Email on Colgate's LGBTQIA+ Network Event. As a Caring Company (Yah Right) we are divided by action communities. Trying to attended say...Asian group is awkward to the people in the Group.

Just a general trend I noticed....look at the consolidation for FIVE YEARS from 1999-2004....what happened after that? Massive capital appreciation. what’s happened the past five years?Consolidation. What’s happening afterwards?.......
What a great way to run a company - exactly a zero % stock price return in 5 years (since Feb’14) ! Way to go CL !
I wounder if the decision by Unlever to sell shares under one listing will eventually lead them to buy CL?.

I expect CL to go below $73-$70 in the next 10 days manufacturers in China will not be able to catch up to global demand also bearish on Walmart closing all those stores cannot be good news for their products.
"Colgate Colgate....Now you need to team up with Philips to develop a Electric Toothbrush. We have been trying for 10+ yrs and cannot get it right. Still no people skill set for this.

Through this collaboration, the best technology will be brought to consumers and dental professionals under a co-branded approach: Philips Colgate.The exclusive portfolio of Philips Colgate will feature various electric toothbrushes across a range of price points. The companies have a strong ambition to boost usage of oral care electric devices in Latin America, where brushing is high but electric toothbrush usage is low."""
Way over sold.
"Even with a 5 percent increase in its dividends, Cook can not keep the stock from falling. RUBIN, please come back."
Cook has GOT to go. What is wrong with those people.
Someone is buying a lot of calls at 80 today
"My question at the next shareholders meeting will be: is CL is still borrowing $$$ to buy back stock now or will you wait until the stock hits $60. Since the meeting will remotely like last year, they will not address the question. WHO KNOWS, The stock may be under $60 by May."
"Very brief annual meeting today. Missing the free danishes and the gift bags. Not really, but I miss not talking to the Colgate people before the meeting ,the executives and rank and file plus retirees. Noel did address my question when I asked if the CL buy back at the all time high price and if they would give the shareholders a detailed report on the buy back program on the cost basis. He promised to address the report. If not, I will remind him next year. I rather see them pay down debt instead of a buy back."
Colgate-Palmolive reached an all time high at 80.94
Colgate needs to start Innovating again!!!! What about all these New Smart younger people they are hiring?
Only reason to increase the dividend by any amount was for Cook to save face on the way out.I would expect Noel to be brave enough not to increase the dividend in 2019. Cl needs the mon to pay down debt and for acquisitions.
"Why even bother with acquisitions? :“Notes: (1) The impact of the previously disclosed acquisition of the hello oral care business on as reported volume was 0.5% for North America and 0.0% for Total Company, Total CP Products and Developed Markets. “"

Beautiful dividend growth stock at these levels
"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #3 - This comes from a Retiree on the status of Colgate stores...""Confirmed the decision taken is to close permanently the store for retirees."" I can confirm Piscataway and New York stores have been removed. One of the stores at a Planet has been removed. As the Employee online ordering (with 6.50 flat rate shipping) is ONLY available for current employees. So the Retirees are viewed as #$%$"
Can there be another acquisitions in the works?
Offer of $100 price tag or 27-30% premium to current share price seems more than likely. I think it's just matter of when.
No reason for today's price at $74 other then a safe haven stock. Pipe line is dry for YEARS...There so much Colgate can do with acquisitions as internal Talent is thin...PARK Ave...wake UP!!!
What is going on why lower
anybody thinks this goes lower
I guess I was not the only one disappointed last Friday after Colgate's annual meeting. Stock way down today.Cook does not care. He got the board to make him very rich at the expense of shareholders
"Instead of increasing the dividend, CL should use the money to pay down their debt and for needed acquisitions. CL must increase it margins on its portfolio and this is only thru acquisitions. They need to rebuild this company now that Cook will soon be gone."
"Just combine the 2 dam n companies and call it Colgate Phillips , maybe that’ll help the stock to start performing, lol"
"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #4 - HR is busy with this Woke Corporate System...as Colgate is 100% on board. Video Training on new policy's this year. You Retirees would be Fired for actions of the past. Now we are dealing with today's Woke policy's that has infiltrated Corporate America . From a HR Power Point..""Our Purpose - We are Colgate, a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and out planet."""
Makes you wonder what’s going on with a company that does 10x worse than the market on a day
The dividend increase was to be expected. Cl does it every year so the stock price will increase before the May annual meeting. It is a way for Cook not to have a shareholders revolt over his poor management. We need to press him for better sales and better profits. He can not get blood from stone by reducing cost. He exhumed that trick. Now he must increase sales and regain volume m
I think Noel needs to take a page out of Rubin's play book and split the stock if it hits $75.
Another $10 drop price per share may make the tender offer attractive. Cook better watch his back. Does not look good for him
"$CL - Colgate - $75.45*Quarterly dividend of $0.45 per shareReady for a jump? I think yes! Just put an options call (Exp. Nov.5) & a few k towards $CL. The stock has been getting some volume today -currently, up 1.5%- & is sitting at a strong resistance level.Earnings on October 29th-Price Targets below:-Goldman Sachs: $98 (BUY)-Deutsche Bank: $86 (BUY)-Berenberg Bank $85 (HOLD)"
"Not surprisingly, CL only increased its quarterly payment by a penny."
CL tried every effort to cut cost but the transform project result is not so good.
"I am hoping it drops to $55 as it would make CL a take over target and perhaps we will get $70 to $75 a,share in the end. From my lips, to God's ears."
Back to 2016-17 levels. 2018 was the buying opportunity.
