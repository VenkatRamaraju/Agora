"My question at the next shareholders meeting will be: is CL is still borrowing $$$ to buy back stock now or will you wait until the stock hits $60. Since the meeting will remotely like last year, they will not address the question. WHO KNOWS, The stock may be under $60 by May."

Is there another downgrade?
"Nice Report Noel....Brace yourself....The Titanic is here...People who work in the Labs do know what's in the Pipe Line...And it's not much. Reformations, Reformations...Add a brush here and take a oz here. Your not being told The Truth...We are being run by Time Share managers."
"We are a roll, a downward roll until $60 ."
The new tax code will allow CP to bring home a boat load of money to buy back stock and increase the dividends
Another lovely day at CP. B.S. meetings and Service Awards for what? What's going on with Consumer Goods stock?
Colgate-Palmolive is up 4.98% to 80.49
"I for one see little hope for CL, the mgmt is entrenched and obviously is clueless as to what to do during this crisis situation (read the latest downgrades!!!), the board appears to either not care or is incompetent, the concentration is still on cutting costs/unending restructuring, no corp activist in site to shake things up (no one sees value), no acquirer willing to spend over $50 bill on the declining business lacking any innovation - a very bleak picture and total shame for a great legacy name"
X DIV DAY COMING
"The only good thing to say about the stock, it is up $1.34 from the 52 week low. Good job Cook,... bazinga, as Sheldon Lee Cooper would say."
"Hey Colgate, A way to save LOT'S of $$'s and maybe a few employees is to keep the 11th floor in Park Ave. and Move everyone else to the empty W wing in Piscataway (Hum that should have happened 4yrs ago)."
Anyone watched Options Action on Friday? The analysts trounced CL Shares with target price of $62 !
I hope all the CP lemmings in Piscataway will be attending Pride Party next week. Sept 7th still set for return to the Office.
congrats on the lowest stock price since April '13.
I guess CL will hover between 60 and 65 for a long time. I will have to give up ever seeing it hit $70 again.
congrats on the 52 week low - should get the wheels turning.
Well I turned the drip plan on in May of 2013. Only 2Qs of drip purchases are green. And not by much. Stock price has been a laggard and appears to be getting worse. Five years of appreciation gone. Just an observation. Need to follow UL's lead to step it up. GLTA
"Since last earnings report...Shares have lost about 1.1% in that time frame, under-performing the S&P 500. A few articles to when Colgate will ""Break-Out"" of this cycle. With the New Year soon...Maybe start ""Innovating again""??? With it's knowledgeable work force being forced out (OH...GGEP)..Life at Colgate(US anyway) is bleak."
"What are roller coaster we are on. Up one day, down the next. Anyway Cook should retire this year and we will see what Justin will do with the stock and company."
great strategic company that is well managed. I'm buying more on the next dip!
CL is down 4.90% to 79.43
Stock has a lot more to fall. It yields less than US10Y. This is a terrible sign.
I think Noel needs to take a page out of Rubin's play book and split the stock if it hits $75.
Cl is a stock that will trade between $ 60 and 65 most of the time. It Is a widow's stock.So buy when it goes below $ 60 and sell at $66 is my personal opinion.
"CL management, please sell the company."
The chart for CL is clearly rolling over. Watch out below. Over-priced. Shaky market and due to a correction.
CL reached a new 52 Week Low at $60.63
"Colgate is Changing it's S&I again....Little by Little these changes are LESS for the worker and More for Management. Currently, under the Colgate-Palmolive Company Savings & Investment Plan (S&I Plan), you may make two separate elections for how contributions to the Plan are invested when they are initially allocated to your account — one election that applies to your contributions and Company matching contributions, and a separate election that applies to Basic Retirement Contributions* (BRCs).Effective July 15, 2021, you will have only one investment election under the Plan. A single election will control the investment of future allocations to your account attributable to your contributions, Company matching contributions and BRCs. This means that BRCs contributed after July 14, 2021 will be invested according to the investment direction in place for your employee contributions and Company matching contributions.• Note that BRCs are allocated to your S&I Plan account on or about the 10th of each month for the prior month, so this means that the first BRC allocation subject to the new rule will be the July 2021 allocation made on August 10, 2021.This will happen automatically — while no action is required on your part, we encourage you to review your investment elections for employee contributions/Company matching contributions and for BRCs. If you currently direct future employee contributions/Company matching contributions differently than BRCs, you can consider changing your election that will apply for all of these contribution types to yield a similar pattern — see Page 2 for an example. (Note that even if you are not currently making employee contributions to the S&I Plan, any election made in the past will apply.And, if you have never made employee contributions, your investment election will be set to the BlackRock LifePath Target Date Fund with the target date closest to the year in which you will reach age 65.)Note that Employer Common Stock Fund D is not available as an investment option for employee contributions/Company matching contributions/BRCs, and therefore, BRCs may no longer be directed to Employer Common Stock Fund D."
Never owned CL until today. 2019 looks like a year to be in defensive stocks. T and XOM also look good to me here. All 3 of these stocks are dividend aristocrats meaning they have increased their dividend each year for over 25 years.
"Colgate-Palmolive Company announced that it has agreed to acquire Hello Products LLC (""Hello""), one of the fastest-growing, premium oral care brands in the United States, a portfolio company of Tenth Avenue Holdings, a New York City based private, diversified holding company.Since Innovation is not happening at CP....Let's buy a company that is!!!!"
"Everyone is writing we need to buy defensive stock and they are naming Clorox, P&G and others , but no one is including CL in the mix. I wonder why? I guess so many experts have given up on CL."
Well Well...Moved to December 1st to go back into the office. Were can I Buy Softsoap? Maybe China has it all?
when will the stocks split
Were has everyone gone? I hope you investors have Proxy Voted...I have. The earnings call should be uplifting to the shareholders to how Colgate is delivering core company values to the World in this time of need. Beats listing to IT weekly rally.
CL climbing a wall of worry.
CL is one of my favorite dividend growth stocks. I talk about dividend growth stocks on my youtube channel. The channel is really focused on new and beginner investors looking to invest in dividend growth stocks and ETFs. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrg6IDPf4a7pUKTN90n6syg
What's going on Colgate???? How about buying a Electric toothbrush company (quip would be nice to have)? Since we cannot develop a reliable product...as with Hum being a gimmicky product to begin with. Oh BTW..that Hum cardboard display sign is of Low quality compared to P&G.
"Same stuff., different decade! Amazing how such stagnating business even survives in the 21st century Another decade or two and Amazon will be selling better products at lower pricesCL will be lucky to get a subcontracting deal with them"
"3rd Quarter Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2020 – 8:30 a.m. ET...It's show time again...The beauty is a shell game that I must listen to...I miss the 11:00AM calls we used to have. Talking with R&D...Nothing going on so let's Ride the stock market."
"""The shorters look like they have disappeared. The week old data shows shorts down by 50%. Likely many more have been closed. Anyone who was convincing themselves that shorters must have some inside knoweldge should rest easy now. Not only did the vast majority of shorters lose big money, but they got so wrecked they are all disappearing.It just goes to show you it is not always conspiracy theories.

"In line with today's events...CP is celebrating the national ""Coming Out"" Day. Two events at CP....Email sent out from Noel. In other news...CP fro YTD at 5%???"
Also it will make it take over target.I see a merger announcement by the May annual meeting
"Was a blip today at $71.04....Had a call at $71 and Sold 500 shares...Another 500 set for $72. Need to cut down on this Grandma stock and move into my higher performing ETF's,"
May 8 is the annual meeting. Going to miss not getting a goodie bag on the way out as this year the meeting is just on line. Sad.
"Meeting yesterday and some News (Yes I can give Good News all-thou it's not common at CP)...At 1 time we would get People on the Move, Company Actions, Products...but this stopped 8yrs ago. Shameful as the Local News is the source:Hill's Pet Nutrition Plans to Build New Factory in Tonganoxie, Kansas to Help Meet Growing Demand for its Pet Food. Colgate's Hill's Pet Nutrition Invests $250M To Build New Factory. The new state-of-the-art facility will be built on 80 acres in Tonganoxie Business Park in Tonganoxie, KS and will help Hill's Pet Nutrition meet the increasing demand for science-led pet nutrition. The new, innovative factory will feature the latest manufacturing technology and is expected to employ at least 80 people by 2025Colgate has cash and equivalents of $995 million as of March 31, 2021...Nice to see US investment but WE all know CP is on the Lower Salary list. Any YOU Management Lemmings cannot say it's the Benefits. Till next time some Action going on in Park Ave for Workforce relaunch."
CL reached a new 52 Week Low at 65.18
Stock market is up...and CP is down...I wonder what's going on??? Overvalued? No breakout products? Let's just ride the roller coaster and buy with the Dips. Still cannot find Softsoap foam.
"Went to the annual meeting. Cook almost put me to sleep. He had two funkis stand up to say he is doing a great job...ha ha what a joke. Said he will not do a buy back. No merger news. After several share holders complained about the low stock price he did a tap dance . All of his charts were pointing negative yet he told the audience he and his gang , executives and board deserve their compensation for doing a lousy job.No innovation except for the love toothpaste sold in China,with tiny heart.They kept on talking about the toothbrush they are selling in Apple for over $100 each. They may sell 200 a year to dummyI only hanged around to the end to get the gift bags.As soon as the price hits $70 some time in my life, I going to sell and run away New investors stay away. This stock is a joke and the company is,run by crooks."
CL is down -4.90% to 73.52
"This stock is still FAR from cheap. It's selling for 20x year end earnings, and that's much more expensive than some of the other consumer product companies. CL growth is slow and the PE is 20X year end. I think it could head to mid 50s."
"Well ,I was listening to the annual meeting on line, and the only good thing that I heard was that the shareholder gift bags were being donated to first responders in NY and NJ.Other than that, they really screened the questions at the Q&A. I know a few shareholders who asked some hard questions on line and they passed over them. They can not do that with an on site meeting. The biggest misstatement from Nolan on the question why is Colgate Toothpaste made in Mexico. He said some toothpaste skus were made in Mexico. To be honest he should had said Most toothpaste cases are coming up from Mexico.I do not think I will waste an hour of my time on line listening to management patting themselves on the back next year Note to all the shareholders who keep wishing to a higher stock price ...Forgetaboutit ....CL is a widow stock. You buy it for the steady dividends and not for capital gains. Be happy with stock price between 60 and 65. Sell when there is a surge over $70 buy back on the dip"
"We received the quarterly results with a terrible forecast for 2019. Same excuses time after time. These Centers of Excellence that were created are not working. The company has removed and isolated itself with these centers from the consumers, the customers and from suppliers and vendors.Time for new management and a return to the way business was done under Mark. Cook and is cronies must go."
BAM $75.50+
"Just combine the 2 dam n companies and call it Colgate Phillips , maybe that’ll help the stock to start performing, lol"
Just a general trend I noticed....look at the consolidation for FIVE YEARS from 1999-2004....what happened after that? Massive capital appreciation. what’s happened the past five years?Consolidation. What’s happening afterwards?.......

"With the news that Noel Wallace and Justin have been promoted, give me hope that Cook will soon retire. Noel and Justin can breath new life into CL and perhaps find a buyer"
I think CL Mgt is buying back shares to keep the price above $75. Today both Clorox and P&G dropped more than CL
"2018 was a bad year for CL. Hopefully with new management 2019 will be better.The Jets got rid of their coach, now the time to changes coaches at CL.We do not want to see CL turn into a GE, do we???"
"A publicly announcement 2/23/21 on a Board of Director at Colgate ""Dr. Helene D. Gayle"" has also been appointment to Palo Alto Networks Board of Directors. Some history at CP..In 2012 ""Nikesh Arora"" was a VP at Google and in 2018 became CEO of Palo Alto Networks. Colgate infrastructure had changed during Nikesh tender selecting Google, then additional infrastructure change using Palo Alto. Talk about ""The Fix is In""- with such close business relationships arouses suspicion of product bias when selecting our infrastructure...integrity must be foremost, not links to ""Friends and Family."""
Nice recovery from the pre market price. Any price over $65 is a premium
anybody thinks this goes lower
Offer of $100 price tag or 27-30% premium to current share price seems more than likely. I think it's just matter of when.
As interest rates increase the chances that Colgate will be taken over becomes remote. That is too bad becuase management could have made a bundle for us. I guess we will have to see how much more damage Cook and his anti American executive team will do before they are let go.
What a beautiful stock and great long term buy at $73
"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #2. Yesterday we received a Email on returning to the Office...This has moved to October 18, 2021. This difficult decision was made in response to the ongoing rise in COVID-19 cases and the continued spread of the more contagious Delta variant.....blah blah blah."
Wonder why it keeps inching higher. I would like to think that something good is actually in the works. I am a bit skeptical based on the last few years.
"The range on a CL share should be at $60 to $65. Any valuation North of $65 is an over reaction to a heated market. But be happy with your shares $$ as long as it does not fall below $60 and enjoy the dividends. It was a widow stock for God's sake. Now if management continues to buy high value and high margin companies and they leave these companies alone the stock true worth may increase.After all,except for Hills, the dish and other soap products are at the end of their life cycle. The deodorant business in America is almost not existing, and the oral lines in still riding the coat tales of the original Total brand that is no more.Buy high margin and innovating companies, let them alone to contribute to the bottom line and CL will do well. Integrate them into the old CL method of doing business and see them fade away like Murphy Oil Soap, Mennan and a host of other brands that CL killed off."
After hours $78.22. Have a limit sell order at $80. Maybe it will hit next week
"So today a friend called and CP sent out the end of year Retiree letter. Chief DE&I Officer..Diversity, Equity and Inclusion which we knew...But what is funny...""We are more committed then ever to strengthening our communities and our own culture, ensuring each individual at Colgate feels empowered, encouraged and inspired to be themselves and achieve their best"". Follow-up on this tomorrow. Let me get the Kleenex."
"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #3 - This comes from a Retiree on the status of Colgate stores...""Confirmed the decision taken is to close permanently the store for retirees."" I can confirm Piscataway and New York stores have been removed. One of the stores at a Planet has been removed. As the Employee online ordering (with 6.50 flat rate shipping) is ONLY available for current employees. So the Retirees are viewed as #$%$"
"""Market Watch"" Colgate-Palmolive Co. CL, +0.03% said Friday it had net income of $578 million, or 67 cents a share, in the third quarter, up from $523 million, or 60 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding a 4 cents charge relating to a cost-cutting program, the company's EPS came to 71 cents, a penny ahead of the 70 cents FactSet consensus. Sales rose 2% to $3.928 billion, just below the FactSet consensus of $3.946 billion. Chief Executive Noel Wallace said the company is focused on growth and will continue to innovate in its core businesses, pursue adjacent categories and expand into new markets. The company retained its leading share of the global toothpaste market at 41.2% in the year to date, he said. Colgate is still expecting full-year sales to be flat to up in the low single digits, and expects EPS of be down in low single digits."
Today is CP Ethical presentation call. You would think the annual Code of Conduct would cover this? But in today's environment Colgate needs to CYA and present the subject by itself. Worker Moral is don't ask and don't tell...If you do then your marked.
"Very brief annual meeting today. Missing the free danishes and the gift bags. Not really, but I miss not talking to the Colgate people before the meeting ,the executives and rank and file plus retirees. Noel did address my question when I asked if the CL buy back at the all time high price and if they would give the shareholders a detailed report on the buy back program on the cost basis. He promised to address the report. If not, I will remind him next year. I rather see them pay down debt instead of a buy back."
Happy I sold some shares at $67.50
Colgate-Palmolive reached an all time high at 84.26
News for Today....Just got a Email on Colgate's LGBTQIA+ Network Event. As a Caring Company (Yah Right) we are divided by action communities. Trying to attended say...Asian group is awkward to the people in the Group. Speaking to a friend from HR...She was saying Companies need these groups as the White person has been privileged thru-out history which set forth to why these Colgate(and other Companies) Groups exists.
"Wallace is a very bright guy, but stale behemoth seems to need an outsider or corporate activist to shake things up, with no one in sight - pretty sad when no one sees potential value in the great brands"
OK you CP Lemmings...Let's talk about the 25Yr Club. Will this continue once the Company opens up? Since the average age is 60+ and we all know Colgate works on the side of caution...I say it's done for being On-Site. Heck...No Retire Portal to order Colgate products. What a Caring Company that you were lead into believing (10-20yrs ago yes). Welcome to the New Order.
"Not surprisingly, CL only increased its quarterly payment by a penny."
Looks like more buybacks taking place - up $2 in a week
Makes you wonder what’s going on with a company that does 10x worse than the market on a day
"I'm confused, three price target cuts today and it's up? anyone know why?"
No reason for today's price at $74 other then a safe haven stock. Pipe line is dry for YEARS...There so much Colgate can do with acquisitions as internal Talent is thin...PARK Ave...wake UP!!!
"At $67.50 a share I started to sell some, not all, of my CL shares. I will be watching and I may sell some more.Just my opinion but I do not see any growth opportunities with this stock under the current leadership. They have bled this company dried"
Broken chart.Broken stock.Broken business?
Too bad Mgt did not split the stock at 80+.
Back to 2016-17 levels. 2018 was the buying opportunity.
Things are looking better. I'll predict 76.75 year end. GLTA
I Love these inter-office video updates....The We Care messages and all one....Check Please!!!!
Beautiful dividend growth stock at these levels
I figure with the Large Group IT Webcast yesterday...I see another VERP and GGEP in the horizon. Would also see a Cut in raises and bonuses for 2021. All companies will be reviewing it's placement of staff.
"Even with a 5 percent increase in its dividends, Cook can not keep the stock from falling. RUBIN, please come back."
Well...Now it's September 15th to go back into the office. I am sure HR and Management are putting a list as well as other companies to WACK people by this year. On the other hand it's been a vacation so why not.
CL should announce its annual dividend increase this week.Estimates show a two cent per Q increase to 0.42.
"Cl is up based on growth at P&G. Guess if you can not increase your share price based on your own accomplishments, do it on someone else."
Gotta be some bad news rumors about this Fri earnings
They are outsourcing jobs to Mexico. I know this first hand. They don^t care about their employees Cook does not have a clue on how to run this once great company. I have one word to say GE ran by an incompetent for years you can see what happened to that company. The majority of stock is held by large institutions if they get fed up and start dumping the stock watch out!
"The Board can pour milions to shore up CL stock price, but no one is buying it. Cook failures will continue to drive down the price. Time to follow GE example and get a better leader."
"Big deal another penny in dividend. Not a surprise, Mgt toss us a crum each year"
Happy New Year you CP lemmings. Nice way to start the New Year with the stock dropping. Seems the New administration is NOT business friendly? We be to China though. Once at $78-80 then Buy.
"They’ve mentioned rising raw material prices for so many quarters now, this is with inflation almost non-existent lately - what gives ?!!!"
"Cl over $69 today. See the history. Peeks twice a year, before the annual meeting and before Christmas In December Has to be something with senior executives bonuses"
Why is this down today? News?
"I’ve been patiently holding for the dividend, they will eventually get back on track."
Price up more than 1.25% but volume is low - nobody selling? CL has been a VERY good investment for me over the past 30 years.
"So we have a Townhall meeting 12/15...Looking for a ""kumbaya"" on-line gathering. Sad to see no Christmas party this year...30yrs to miss my 1st one. This will give Sodexo a break for a change."
"Colgate Colgate....Now you need to team up with Philips to develop a Electric Toothbrush. We have been trying for 10+ yrs and cannot get it right. Still no people skill set for this. ""Colgate is the world’s number one oral care brand, and Philips is the number one manufacturer of sonic toothbrushes globally. Through this collaboration, the best technology will be brought to consumers and dental professionals under a co-branded approach: Philips Colgate.The exclusive portfolio of Philips Colgate will feature various electric toothbrushes across a range of price points. The companies have a strong ambition to boost usage of oral care electric devices in Latin America, where brushing is high but electric toothbrush usage is low."""
Funny when the Market moves CP also moves. Not today as the market is near 4%. Hey Noel...Were can I buy Softsoap Foam?
"I believethat CL has reached the point of no return. Sales will continue to be flat and there is no growth potential. Only growth can come from aquiring companies in growing businesses. Unfortunately CL has a reputation of destroying these businesses. At this point a stock price of less than $70 is to be expected. If there is still any hope for a merger with a more respectable company like Unlever, Colgate should encourage it."
I guess I was not the only one disappointed last Friday after Colgate's annual meeting. Stock way down today.Cook does not care. He got the board to make him very rich at the expense of shareholders
What a great way to run a company - exactly a zero % stock price return in 5 years (since Feb’14) ! Way to go CL !
"Why even bother with acquisitions? :“Notes: (1) The impact of the previously disclosed acquisition of the hello oral care business on as reported volume was 0.5% for North America and 0.0% for Total Company, Total CP Products and Developed Markets. “"
CL tried every effort to cut cost but the transform project result is not so good.
"Well, the stock got some action this morning on the news that Cook was finally stepping down, but within an hour it settled in the Noel Wallace may just be as bad"
"As long as it trade within the $60-$65 band , I am happy."
Welcome to CP Fireside chat...Today we are taken 2 On-Line Ethics classes. What BS as each slide can be challenged. CP is part of the Woke Crowd so all you Retires can pat your-self's on the back (Oh...can't do that now) and count your blessings (can't verbally say that also). You Old Timers would never make it in today's Colgate world. Till next time....
"$3 x PE15 = $45, not worth more than that. This stock has been overvalued forever and it's going to take time for reality to set in."
$CL Upgraded by Credit Suisse Underperform » Neutral USD 70 » USD 80
This is the greatest SHORT of all time....everyone says it is a sell and over valued!
CL is over priced. I got out Friday at 52 week high close to high of the day. Will look to get back in lower
Don't be fooled with the Stock price rising. It's going up as to the Dow and nothing to do Innovation. What was once a People company has transformed into a Clean House which clears out it's Older workers.
So anyone sees any hope for this once great co?It seem like the mgmt is running a cost cutting business with some consumer prods mfg on the side
Not familiar with product line they just announced for purchase. Article mentioned it is a premium line.Hope they did not over pay.
I wounder if the decision by Unlever to sell shares under one listing will eventually lead them to buy CL?.
In the Piscataway office this week and the Phones were taken out. Only Management has phones....Everyone else should be using Cisco PC Phone. One way to save $$$'s.
Hedge funds are being forced to unwind their long positions on MSOs. I got lucky and took profits right before and will be looking for better entry points on $GTII $CL $CURA
What is reason for pop today?
Well...Colgate-Palmolive Honored as one of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies of 2021..It's nice to see we are a Recycling Innovator BUT not a Product Innovator. A Trophy is a Trophy I guess?

"I wonder if Ruben sold off all of his millions of CL shares , he obviously has no input/interest in the current business situation unfortunately"
"Came close to selling. Glad I did not. Soon to be in the low 90s, EOY."
Stock is in a free fall.
"Not much from the earning report....The stock has lost 6.7% year to date through Thursday, while the S&P 500 has gained 12.1%. I would like to see things improve here...The Labs in Piscataway...from the R&D folks nothing is going on for a Break Out product. Still being told Sept to be back into the office...Hope you CP Lemmings have filled out your survey."
So much for matching charitable contributions from retirees. Not that what they did was a very generous list.
Someone is buying a lot of calls at 80 today
"$GTII reported beastly earnings. This week comes the other big three. $CURA $CL $TRUL. Show me the $$$$$Then there is $IAN... No mention of even releasing their Q3 earnings.

They need Buybacks as the only way to increase EPS YoY
We received a Email yesterday that April 1st back to the office is now pushed to Sept. 7th. We are encouraged to consult with your DR. for getting the COVID shot. The only way Colgate or any company will have it's people back is to roll up the arm for the COVID-19 shot. It is nice to be on vacation since March 2020...And I am not the only one in the company that is milking this one out. In other News this Friday earnings report....Hey Noel...Were can I buy Softsoap foam?
I hope Park. Ave(Noel) is writing to Comrade De Blasio as to the violence in Manhattan. No way should employees be subjected to the kaos in the city. Safety to the Colgate employee should be #1. Maybe start moving people to Piscataway as there is plenty of space.
"Instead of increasing the dividend, CL should use the money to pay down their debt and for needed acquisitions. CL must increase it margins on its portfolio and this is only thru acquisitions. They need to rebuild this company now that Cook will soon be gone."
Nothing new in the pipeline. Showing profit by cost-cutting and downsizing.
Another $10 drop price per share may make the tender offer attractive. Cook better watch his back. Does not look good for him
"CL has been open to any take over offer but there are no takers. After reviewing the latest presentation, I would wait for CL to trade lower. The company is very limited in its products to attract any interest. In addition the 10 day truckers strike in Brazil will take a toll on the quarterly earnings."
"Unileaver most likely to make offer here, cash and stock valued at 95 to 100"
I hope you CP kool aid drinkers are BUYING at $62-64...It's time to make $$'s on this Granny Stock. After 30yrs I am finally putting in calls to cover this temporarily lost.
what's the story behind the high valuation? any plans
"This is a great stock to buy when it dips and hold long term. It may be boring and low growth, but it’s one of just three stocks I own that are up year to date."
"I am hoping it drops to $55 as it would make CL a take over target and perhaps we will get $70 to $75 a,share in the end. From my lips, to God's ears."
"If the CL price stays flat, Feb.1st will mark 6 yrs of zero appreciation- does it say something about the whole industry or CL mgmt?"
I have the same bar of Palmolive soap on my sink that I've used every day for the last 10 years. The Palmolive soap that I buy now lasts maybe 2 weeks in the shower. Engineered obsolescence?
Wish J&J would take over CL and end its recent lackluster history.
CL reached a new 52 Week Low at 66.08
$61 - $62 y end of the week. imho
Let’s rally to 85  new ALL TIME HIGHS
I expect this stock to decline to the $60-$65 range after the annual meeting on May 10 th.A consistent price of over $70 is possible only in an overheated bull market.
CL is down 5.29% to 72.24
"Well,third qtr results are out and the stock value is tanking in Orenmarket. Same reasoning as in past for poor performance. There's too much complacency. This is not only international company facing similar problems. They have had same problems for over 5 years and have done nothing to rectify. Maybe change is in order."
Unileaver selling off divisions is making them more attractive takeover target again to Kraft-Heinz who needs an acquisition very soon before the market crushes them on earnings growth and then they are done in using stock/ cash to do any deal. Unileaver needs to buy Colgate to permanently make them unattractive to Kraft-Heinz and can Center on consolidating their two companies international sales to be a powerhouse.
"The recent dip in share price has taken this to a price where it's about $10 less than a double over the prior 10 years. The strength and consistency in their profitability metrics tell me they're still a great company, but I think it may be time to shake things up a bit (acquisition, new product lines, anything really). I don't currently own shares, but may start a position around $59 if/when it gets there."
Limit order set at $75
MADGE DON'T PLAY!!!

Colgate-Palmolive reached a 52 Week low at 64.06
"Happy New Year to all!Any predictions for CL in a year from now?I say no buy out, $71 price ..."
China business need effective management.
"CL is going to be bought out within a month. But remember, you didn't hear that from me."
Let's see what Noel is working on today. Were is Soft Soap as I cannot find any?
New low record.
Took some profits at $80. Waiting now for the dip.
"A buy back rewards two classes of people. The Wall Street Bankers and the key executives at the expense of the company and its shareholders. See the damage the GE buy back did. The buy back Will rob Colgate of the much needed money for R&D, new plants, and aquisations. A class action Iaw suite is needed against the board to stop this madness."
The dividend increase was to be expected. Cl does it every year so the stock price will increase before the May annual meeting. It is a way for Cook not to have a shareholders revolt over his poor management. We need to press him for better sales and better profits. He can not get blood from stone by reducing cost. He exhumed that trick. Now he must increase sales and regain volume m
thanks to Zack's for the 'Strong Sell' rec last week -up about 11% from the low.

Colgate-Palmolive reached an all time high at 81.91
"So, this thing has basically went nowhere for five years, omg. The graph is embarrasing..."
CL reached a 52 Week low at 64.06
"Can not wait until May to hear the double talk Cook is going to spit out at the annual meeting. Enough with the smoke and mirrors about organic growth. I want to see more sales and profit and bigger dividends. If he can not deliver, it is time to send this anti American Brit back to England ."
"Great case for a short, declining sales, no profit growth, share price skyrocketing. $50 by year end ..."
"Cl is dropping tricolsan from Total toothpaste.So its flagship product will no longer be uniqued. Do not buy the argument it was a health concern but more like a cost saving option. How foolish. As a consumer why should I buy Total at its premium price over another brand.Not going to say the current management under Cook are dump, as I said it before."
The Day They go to using CBD we will see a BIG Bump...
"Great Financial New From Colgate In The 4th Quarter!!!!!Now what I really can not wait to see is the first quarter of 2020 financials.If I see the continue positive numbers in April great. If I see a decline ,than I know the 4th quarter 2019 was smoke and mirrors ""mortgaging the 1st quarter"" to improve 4th quarter numbers.How do hope they have turned the corners"
Colgate-Palmolive reached an all time high at 80.94
"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #6 - With Uncle Joe forcing Companies with 100 more Employees to be vaccinated...A Survey went out this Summer to ""Fish"" as to the Employee would be comfortable on returning to the office. As Colgate is a ""Woke Corporate Company"" let's see in the months how this will be handled. The return date keeps on being pushed which is fine as most are on the couch cashing Easy checks."
Can there be another acquisitions in the works?
All eye's/ear's on Noel for 3rd Quarter Earnings call...I still cannot find Softsoap Foam. The ordering of items on the Portal sinks...shipping charge of Dog/Cat food is crazy. Talking with CP Retires on ordering products is not there...C'Mon man let's take care of these people who took care of you!!!!
Only reason to increase the dividend by any amount was for Cook to save face on the way out.I would expect Noel to be brave enough not to increase the dividend in 2019. Cl needs the mon to pay down debt and for acquisitions.
Cresco Labs had the Top US Brand in Q4 of 2020 as shown in source below. Huge news for Cresco Labs $CL $CRLBF as well as Green Thumb Industries $GTII $GTBIF (who is in close 2nd place) as this shows that these companies know what they are doing with regards to CPG strategy.https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/llhvmo/top_il_cannabis_brand_rankings_cresco_1/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
I am assuming that Cook will anone next Friday at the annual.shareholders meeting a stock buy back. That is the only option he has to bring the stock price back over $70 a share. Not a bad thing If they bring back oversea profits under the new tax code. BAD thing if they borrow the money.Yesterday a new 52 week low.Great Job Park Avenue
"First level of support comes around $74.70; if broken, the next level down is $70.70, which looks like a stronger support"
Colgate needs to start Innovating again!!!! What about all these New Smart younger people they are hiring?
"So we send off 2020 into the Pit's of Colgate. Nothing in the Pipe Line and what a shame. Reformations, few ingredients changes and Acquisitions. I am waiting for 2021 GGEP ...Everyone else has done this...and we know Colgate is a Follower. The smarties are leaving this once awesome company and not by there choice. I look forward to 2021..maybe back in office April 1st. Till then Merry Christmas!!!!"
"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #4 - HR is busy with this Woke Corporate System...as Colgate is 100% on board. Video Training on new policy's this year. You Retirees would be Fired for actions of the past. Now we are dealing with today's Woke policy's that has infiltrated Corporate America . From a HR Power Point..""Our Purpose - We are Colgate, a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and out planet."""
"As I always say...CP stock only rides the Market. Hey, Anthony....Nice sell at $80....Let's do it again on the Low."
"How do we interpret this repetitive comment in today’s almost non-existent inflation environment?-“Adjusted gross profit margin of 59% declined 20 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, driven by escalated raw and packaging material expenses, including foreign-currency transaction costs.”And hw is this the result of the years of restructuring? -“Operating margin was mainly impacted by a decline in gross margin and 30-bps rise in adjusted selling, general & administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales.”"
CL reached a 52 Week high at 77.37

Perfect example of why I hate Wall Street. The small investors don’t have a chance.
Was told last week of Mask requirements for going back into the Office. Will be a Hybrid model. Mean while nothing going on in the Labs...Typical now a day's. Till next update.
"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #5 - With this weeks past storm in NJ area...You would think CP management would have sent an Email to ask about it's employees well-being? Nope...nothing...You CP Lemmings that bleed Colgate Red in your veins...What a Joke of a Company....Oh we care, We are all together as a Company...Cry me a river.....As HR would say....Best Place to Work!!!!"
"If history is a prediction of the future, CL.should peek right before Christmas as the bonuses for senior manag is based on the stock price."
"Reaching out to the CP Kool Aid drinkers....What was the latest ""Break Out"" product we have had in 3yrs? or even in 5yrs?"
"Bank of America Securities downgraded Colgate from Buy to Neutral. The BofA analyst also wrote she is concerned ""conditions will be more challenging next year"" for Colgate-Palmolive, ""necessitating another year of out-sized investment."" Analyst Olivia Tong also cut her price target on Colgate-Palmolive to $74 a share from $77, Bloomberg reported.More good news....Hopefully these analyst are catching on."
What I find unfathomable is that more than 30 thou employees with no pension plan are relying on their numerous shares of CL in their 401k’s while top mgmt is helplessly watching the co’s value disappear day by day...Seems like an acquisition is foregone conclusion - no one is interested in a non-growing business
"one bright spot for CL is Zack's marked it a 'strong sell', which means it will be going up short term."
lot of troubles in Pacific Region.
Nearing all time TOP.....over valued and overbought.......this should below ALL the analysts targets of $68!!!!!!!!!!!!
"So we had the weekly CIO IT meeting (last week)...The Big shocker was that being told IT will be promoting the African American employees first. Now someone asked CIO about ""reverse discrimination"" as we should be promoting on merit. There was silents from our CIO."
This stock has not really done anything since its split 5 years ago. Maybe it's time to liquidate and move on.
Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #7: Colgate is Celebrating National Coming Out Day. CCO Paula Davis and ERG lead Andre W Marlins are kicking off this event. Colgate has a number of Videos on this subject for the Employees to take. My Question....Why does sexuality even have a platform in any workplace? Best Place to Work!!!!
CL reached a new 52 Week Low at $58.66
Q4 Friday....I am sure the trucks are riding around the warehouse....Just like to Good Old Day's. One thing we have learned at Colgate...Slow and Steady wins to see another day.
Buy at $75
Cook has GOT to go. What is wrong with those people.
"How does a co like CL lose character? Keeps running below the middle of the pack, the stock Is stuck in a 7 yr range, no acquirer/Corp activist sees potential value, milkin launches of existing sku’s, for years complains about raw material inflation in every release (by that logic a tube of TP should cost over $10 to produce), never issues any news to the press, finally buys couple of decent businesses albeit at the wrong time (no one cares about their skin right now), all of this at the time when the good old Clorox is killing it, sad..."
"Market goes up...So does CP...CP has Missed out on increasing the Production Line. Since we are cheap, having additional equipment is laughably. How about moving the gear out of Piscataway to help the supply chain?"
"As I’ve said before, all the GGEP’s are meaningless unless there are growth engines at workAnd now it SEEMS the new acquisitions might be the right approach and hopefully the new management gets it and doesn’t stop half wayFor now, good job Noel!!"
This company is FAILING. Not only is it WAY behind the general market but it is now just plain going to pieces. I cannot sell because I have held it for decades but I am might upset. They better figure out the millennials don't give a sweet damn about brand names.
Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #8: Today we are discussing Colgate's Path to get the employees to the office with a Email that we just got:From the Chief HR Officer: Our site will continue enhanced cleaning protocols and heath screenings. We also plan to restrict office capacity to 25% to ensure proper social distancing and will increase that percentage as COVID-19 infection rates in the community decline. BLA BLA BLA....We Strongly encourage those who can get vaccinated to do so in consultation with your doctor. Bla Bla Bla....Colgate is like a Deck of Cards..They fold easy when being challenged Legally. Once someone gets COVID...they will send everyone home. Do what J&J and Merck are doing....Those who are not Vaccinated get tested every week and you have until December 30th to get vaccinated after that you are fired.
Today's News...Colgate-Palmolive and Procter & Gamble pair IT and R&D staffers to work on new products. Since we cannot develop a Auto Brush (Oral-B #1). Software provided by CP and P&G...Brush P&G. More gimmicky products. Hey Mike...Your Retiree's would like to know what is going on with the Retiree Portal?https://www.wsj.com/articles/smart-device-push-brings-it-and-r-d-teams-together-11615832184
"From Forbes:The most highly leveraged S&P 500 company in 2019––by far––was none other than Colgate-Palmolive, maker of such household brands as Irish Spring, Ajax, Cuddly, Speed Stick and, of course, Colgate toothpaste and Palmolive dish detergent. For every $1 the New York-based company has, it owes $72.50 in debt."
Airlines and cruise lines are going to skyrocket. Inevitable. People are going to travel. Business will travel. Might sell off some of my slow burn tech stocks to get on this and $CL know we will see $aal at $45-50 by mid 2021 and $CCL same story.We all knew travel would be the last to rise from the grave.Double down folks
I don't get how investors are paying 25 times earnings for a staples company that hardly has any growth.

Tim is Out and Alex is in...CP has a New CISO..Good Luck!!!
Consumer staple stocks should be soaring right now.
Nice way to start the New Year with no inspiration weekly message from our CIO. Still nothing on when we get back into the office...April 1st but we know it's going to be Mandatory to get the Vaccine shot for companies to bring back people into the building. In other Colgate news...ZZZ
I expect CL to go below $73-$70 in the next 10 days manufacturers in China will not be able to catch up to global demand also bearish on Walmart closing all those stores cannot be good news for their products.
Way over sold.
"Hold! Buy on the dip... Trian Partners accumilating CL, something's up!"
I do not think we will see an increase in the dividend in 2019. Cl will need the money to shore up it balance sheet and pay bills.
"April 1st 2021 for Piscataway Tec Center to open up. Some of the Lab workers and few IT is currently there. Let's see what happens. Still waiting for a Re-Org after ""WuhanVirus"" passes but it's going to take a Vaccine that will Open up Companies."
"The comeback will not be a V curve regardless what Washington wants. It will be a U curve.If CL drops lower than $60, I will buy more as I believe its range should be between 60 to 65.As I said before any price over $65 is great but I have it for the dividends not the capital gains."
