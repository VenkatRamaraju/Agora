Price up more than 1.25% but volume is low - nobody selling? CL has been a VERY good investment for me over the past 30 years.
Why is this down today? News?
So much for matching charitable contributions from retirees. Not that what they did was a very generous list.
"Meeting yesterday and some News (Yes I can give Good News all-thou it's not common at CP)...At 1 time we would get People on the Move, Company Actions, Products...but this stopped 8yrs ago. Shameful as the Local News is the source:Hill's Pet Nutrition Plans to Build New Factory in Tonganoxie, Kansas to Help Meet Growing Demand for its Pet Food. Colgate's Hill's Pet Nutrition Invests $250M To Build New Factory. The new state-of-the-art facility will be built on 80 acres in Tonganoxie Business Park in Tonganoxie, KS and will help Hill's Pet Nutrition meet the increasing demand for science-led pet nutrition. The new, innovative factory will feature the latest manufacturing technology and is expected to employ at least 80 people by 2025Colgate has cash and equivalents of $995 million as of March 31, 2021...Nice to see US investment but WE all know CP is on the Lower Salary list. Any YOU Management Lemmings cannot say it's the Benefits. Till next time some Action going on in Park Ave for Workforce relaunch."
"Cl over $69 today. See the history. Peeks twice a year, before the annual meeting and before Christmas In December Has to be something with senior executives bonuses"
"Nice Report Noel....Brace yourself....The Titanic is here...People who work in the Labs do know what's in the Pipe Line...And it's not much. Reformations, Reformations...Add a brush here and take a oz here. Your not being told The Truth...We are being run by Time Share managers."
Hey Colgate...As you support BLM....News Flash....Black Lives Matter Utah chapter calls American flag 'symbol of hatred'. Next Board meeting how about REMOVING this Marxist Trash moment as Investors and Employees will not stand for this. I do not like working for a Company that supports Hate!!!!
Beautiful dividend growth stock at these levels
"Well ,I was listening to the annual meeting on line, and the only good thing that I heard was that the shareholder gift bags were being donated to first responders in NY and NJ.Other than that, they really screened the questions at the Q&A. I know a few shareholders who asked some hard questions on line and they passed over them. They can not do that with an on site meeting. The biggest misstatement from Nolan on the question why is Colgate Toothpaste made in Mexico. He said some toothpaste skus were made in Mexico. To be honest he should had said Most toothpaste cases are coming up from Mexico.I do not think I will waste an hour of my time on line listening to management patting themselves on the back next year Note to all the shareholders who keep wishing to a higher stock price ...Forgetaboutit ....CL is a widow stock. You buy it for the steady dividends and not for capital gains. Be happy with stock price between 60 and 65. Sell when there is a surge over $70 buy back on the dip"
News for Today....Just got a Email on Colgate's LGBTQIA+ Network Event. As a Caring Company (Yah Right) we are divided by action communities. Trying to attended say...Asian group is awkward to the people in the Group. Speaking to a friend from HR...She was saying Companies need these groups as the White person has been privileged thru-out history which set forth to why these Colgate(and other Companies) Groups exists.

"In line with today's events...CP is celebrating the national ""Coming Out"" Day. Two events at CP....Email sent out from Noel. In other news...CP fro YTD at 5%???"
"Why even bother with acquisitions? :“Notes: (1) The impact of the previously disclosed acquisition of the hello oral care business on as reported volume was 0.5% for North America and 0.0% for Total Company, Total CP Products and Developed Markets. “"
Stock market is up...and CP is down...I wonder what's going on??? Overvalued? No breakout products? Let's just ride the roller coaster and buy with the Dips. Still cannot find Softsoap foam.
CL is down 4.90% to 79.43
Broken chart.Broken stock.Broken business?
"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #2. Yesterday we received a Email on returning to the Office...This has moved to October 18, 2021. This difficult decision was made in response to the ongoing rise in COVID-19 cases and the continued spread of the more contagious Delta variant.....blah blah blah."
"Colgate is Changing it's S&I again....Little by Little these changes are LESS for the worker and More for Management. Currently, under the Colgate-Palmolive Company Savings & Investment Plan (S&I Plan), you may make two separate elections for how contributions to the Plan are invested when they are initially allocated to your account — one election that applies to your contributions and Company matching contributions, and a separate election that applies to Basic Retirement Contributions* (BRCs).Effective July 15, 2021, you will have only one investment election under the Plan. A single election will control the investment of future allocations to your account attributable to your contributions, Company matching contributions and BRCs. This means that BRCs contributed after July 14, 2021 will be invested according to the investment direction in place for your employee contributions and Company matching contributions.• Note that BRCs are allocated to your S&I Plan account on or about the 10th of each month for the prior month, so this means that the first BRC allocation subject to the new rule will be the July 2021 allocation made on August 10, 2021.This will happen automatically — while no action is required on your part, we encourage you to review your investment elections for employee contributions/Company matching contributions and for BRCs. If you currently direct future employee contributions/Company matching contributions differently than BRCs, you can consider changing your election that will apply for all of these contribution types to yield a similar pattern — see Page 2 for an example. (Note that even if you are not currently making employee contributions to the S&I Plan, any election made in the past will apply.And, if you have never made employee contributions, your investment election will be set to the BlackRock LifePath Target Date Fund with the target date closest to the year in which you will reach age 65.)Note that Employer Common Stock Fund D is not available as an investment option for employee contributions/Company matching contributions/BRCs, and therefore, BRCs may no longer be directed to Employer Common Stock Fund D."
"The recent dip in share price has taken this to a price where it's about $10 less than a double over the prior 10 years. The strength and consistency in their profitability metrics tell me they're still a great company, but I think it may be time to shake things up a bit (acquisition, new product lines, anything really). I don't currently own shares, but may start a position around $59 if/when it gets there."
Someone is buying a lot of calls at 80 today
"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #3 - This comes from a Retiree on the status of Colgate stores...""Confirmed the decision taken is to close permanently the store for retirees."" I can confirm Piscataway and New York stores have been removed. One of the stores at a Planet has been removed. As the Employee online ordering (with 6.50 flat rate shipping) is ONLY available for current employees. So the Retirees are viewed as #$%$"
Welcome to CP Fireside chat...Today we are taken 2 On-Line Ethics classes. What BS as each slide can be challenged. CP is part of the Woke Crowd so all you Retires can pat your-self's on the back (Oh...can't do that now) and count your blessings (can't verbally say that also). You Old Timers would never make it in today's Colgate world. Till next time....
Check out my analysis on $CL:https://ericthomson.substack.com/p/colgate-palmolive-company-cl?r=fgeno&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy
Perfect example of why I hate Wall Street. The small investors don’t have a chance.
"Very brief annual meeting today. Missing the free danishes and the gift bags. Not really, but I miss not talking to the Colgate people before the meeting ,the executives and rank and file plus retirees. Noel did address my question when I asked if the CL buy back at the all time high price and if they would give the shareholders a detailed report on the buy back program on the cost basis. He promised to address the report. If not, I will remind him next year. I rather see them pay down debt instead of a buy back."
Offer of $100 price tag or 27-30% premium to current share price seems more than likely. I think it's just matter of when.
"How do we interpret this repetitive comment in today’s almost non-existent inflation environment?-“Adjusted gross profit margin of 59% declined 20 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, driven by escalated raw and packaging material expenses, including foreign-currency transaction costs.”And hw is this the result of the years of restructuring? -“Operating margin was mainly impacted by a decline in gross margin and 30-bps rise in adjusted selling, general & administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales.”"
anybody thinks this goes lower
CL tried every effort to cut cost but the transform project result is not so good.
I guess I was not the only one disappointed last Friday after Colgate's annual meeting. Stock way down today.Cook does not care. He got the board to make him very rich at the expense of shareholders
MADGE DON'T PLAY!!!
I hope all the CP lemmings in Piscataway will be attending Pride Party next week. Sept 7th still set for return to the Office.
"My question at the next shareholders meeting will be: is CL is still borrowing $$$ to buy back stock now or will you wait until the stock hits $60. Since the meeting will remotely like last year, they will not address the question. WHO KNOWS, The stock may be under $60 by May."
"""Market Watch"" Colgate-Palmolive Co. CL, +0.03% said Friday it had net income of $578 million, or 67 cents a share, in the third quarter, up from $523 million, or 60 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding a 4 cents charge relating to a cost-cutting program, the company's EPS came to 71 cents, a penny ahead of the 70 cents FactSet consensus. Sales rose 2% to $3.928 billion, just below the FactSet consensus of $3.946 billion. Chief Executive Noel Wallace said the company is focused on growth and will continue to innovate in its core businesses, pursue adjacent categories and expand into new markets. The company retained its leading share of the global toothpaste market at 41.2% in the year to date, he said. Colgate is still expecting full-year sales to be flat to up in the low single digits, and expects EPS of be down in low single digits."
Gotta be some bad news rumors about this Fri earnings
Don't be fooled with the Stock price rising. It's going up as to the Dow and nothing to do Innovation. What was once a People company has transformed into a Clean House which clears out it's Older workers.
"Came close to selling. Glad I did not. Soon to be in the low 90s, EOY."
