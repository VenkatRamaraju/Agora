"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #6 - With Uncle Joe forcing Companies with 100 more Employees to be vaccinated...A Survey went out this Summer to ""Fish"" as to the Employee would be comfortable on returning to the office. As Colgate is a ""Woke Corporate Company"" let's see in the months how this will be handled. The return date keeps on being pushed which is fine as most are on the couch cashing Easy checks."
What a beautiful stock and great long term buy at $73
Limit order set at $75
Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #8: Today we are discussing Colgate's Path to get the employees to the office with a Email that we just got:From the Chief HR Officer: Our site will continue enhanced cleaning protocols and heath screenings. We also plan to restrict office capacity to 25% to ensure proper social distancing and will increase that percentage as COVID-19 infection rates in the community decline. BLA BLA BLA....We Strongly encourage those who can get vaccinated to do so in consultation with your doctor. Bla Bla Bla....Colgate is like a Deck of Cards..They fold easy when being challenged Legally. Once someone gets COVID...they will send everyone home. Do what J&J and Merck are doing....Those who are not Vaccinated get tested every week and you have until December 30th to get vaccinated after that you are fired.
"Colgate ($CL) will release earnings on Friday, October 29th. Just picked up 5k worth of stock shares last week (in time for a tooth aching Halloween and holiday season lol) and I'm excited to see where this stock moves. RSI is currently in favor of a bullish two months leading up to the New Year, where their stock has peaked in almost every year of the past two decades. Peace and trade on my friends!"
What is going on why lower
Will buy for $71 at earnings
Nothing new in the pipeline. Showing profit by cost-cutting and downsizing.
I think CL Mgt is buying back shares to keep the price above $75. Today both Clorox and P&G dropped more than CL
So much for matching charitable contributions from retirees. Not that what they did was a very generous list.
Way over sold.
Today's earnings call....Way to go Noel...
"Just recently added these stocks to my portfolio . . . ready for big gains:$CL - Colgate (Oral Healthcare & Dental Products): $75.5- Earnings on Oct.29th, just in time to release forward-looking statements for the holiday season including Halloween when their revenue typically spikes higher.$CRON - Cronos (Cannabis & CBD) $5.8- Vote taking place in November regarding the Federal legalization of Cannabis. $CTEK - CynergisTek INC (Cyber Security) $1.79- Recent contracts including one with a US based federal credit union$DPLS - DarkPulse INC (Laser Technology and AI Systems) $0.085- More of a long-term play here, because I truly believe this stock could reach well over $1 in the next year. Riskier than my other stocks, but you've gotta risk it for the biscuit, period."
Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #7: Colgate is Celebrating National Coming Out Day. CCO Paula Davis and ERG lead Andre W Marlins are kicking off this event. Colgate has a number of Videos on this subject for the Employees to take. My Question....Why does sexuality even have a platform in any workplace? Best Place to Work!!!!
"Welcome to CP Fireside Chat #4 - HR is busy with this Woke Corporate System...as Colgate is 100% on board. Video Training on new policy's this year. You Retirees would be Fired for actions of the past. Now we are dealing with today's Woke policy's that has infiltrated Corporate America . From a HR Power Point..""Our Purpose - We are Colgate, a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and out planet."""
"Well Well Noel. Ian was a lousy CEO and Your not far from this. This Company is so Lost in my 30+yrs as it's sad to say this. The employees have no direction from Sr. Leadership as in pass years. Why the disconnection?....Your Leadership and your direct reports. When the Old Timers leave no transfer of knowledge takes place. We have been walking on Egg Shells in Piscataway, Park Ave, Hills for 8+yrs. We know whats in the Flash Report and the earners for 10/29....Sad to see CP as another Company that does not care for it's people....Great Place to Work Right?"
