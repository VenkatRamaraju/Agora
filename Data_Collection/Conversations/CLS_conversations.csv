should get back to $12 range by earnings
Celestica reached a 52 Week high at 10.06
"Thanks to buyback the stock is back to where it was before Q4 announcement. Now that buyback is almost over we can take a look again at a disaster that Q4 and 2018 really was for CLS.The operation and balance sheet are clearly in shambles.$93M less in cash$183M more in receivables, $195M more in payables,$87M more in current liabilities$484M more in LT debt$51M less in non-current (pension-related assets)and$175M more in goodwill + $262M more in ""intangible assets"" (due to poor acquisitions)That's additional $437M in eventual write-downs of company tangible book value in a quarter of management's choosing to do a ""kitchen sink"" write-off.Company is suffering not just from a negative cash-flow (i.e., not profitable, no matter what the ""adjusted earnings"" say, but also a obvious cash flow problem - they had to increase sales of receivables to 2 third-party banks from $200M to $250M, to expedite the payment, which means they need cash turnover faster and that amount of receivables should be also decreased to account for a discount given to banks.Even conservatively, without amortization and depreciation prior to Q4 disaster filing the tangible book value of company was around $8.40 - $8.60 on a 140.6M diluted shares basis. Now it's below $5 per share. Buying back more expensive shares is not going to help.The management should be replaced before what happened to FLEX or GE happens to CLS shareholders."
Low multiple and profitable unlike so many other tech stocks.
So Celestica beats the earnings estimates and then it drops 10%. Go figure.
"Very downbeat analysis from highly respected *independent* research firm doesn't inspire confidence in CLS management and stock:Jeffrey HirtMarch 29, 2019Celestica has posted disappointing results of late. In the fourth quarter, the top line increased 11%, to $1.73 billion, bolstered by acquisitions. Most recently, CLS bought Impakt, a manufacturer of highly specialized, large-format semiconductor and organic light emitting diode (OLED) display capital equipment in a $329 million deal. However, news was less favorable on the profitability front.The Advanced Technology Solutions (ATS) segment provides manufacturing products and services to a diverse set of end markets, including capital equipment. Performance in that industry has become particularly soft, due to slower semiconductor capital equipment demand. Segment operating profitability dropped150 basis points, year over year, to 3.7%. Lower semiconductor capital equipment needs are now anticipated throughout 2019, in contrast to a prior demand surge.The company plans to better align the ATS business to the current revenue environment. In other words, more restructuring efforts are on the way. Indeed, restructuring has been common at this electronics manufacturer, largely due to the cyclical nature of its end markets.There will likely be considerable choppiness in the near term. CLS issued first-quarter operating-margin guidance of 2.6%, far softer than its longer-term goal of 3.75%-4.5%. We are shaving a nickel off our March-quarter earnings estimate, to $0.10 per share.Restructuring expenses are running high, and the efforts are taking longer than expected. In addition to the ATS work, the company has been reducing storage and server capacity and headcount. That plan is expected to wrap up in late 2019, about half a year later than originally anticipated. Also, revenues are likely to be impacted by the voluntary departure from lower-margin jobs, so we estimate very modest top-line growth in the near future. Capital appreciation potential out to 2022-2024 is below average."
47K more bids moved in the queue. We are looking good for a reversal.

"Debt downgrade after piling up more debt. Full panic mode.TORONTO Nov. 1, 2018-- S&P Global Ratings today said it has lowered its issue-level rating and revised its recovery rating on Celestica Inc. (CLS)' s senior secured debt. Celestica (CLS) is proposing to issue an incremental US $350 million add-on to the existing term loan that lowers the recovery prospects for the senior secured lenders. As a result, we are lowering our issue-level rating on the senior secured debt to' BB' from' BB+' and revising our recovery rating on the debt to '3' from '2'. The '3' recoveryreflects our expectation of meaningful (50%-70%) recovery in a default scenario.We expect the company will use the proceeds to fund the US$329 millionacquisition of Impakt Holdings LLC.10/30/2018 Zacks Investment Research, Inc. downgrades CELESTICA INC from HOLD to SELL. 11/05/2018 Thomson Reuters/Verus downgraded CELESTICA INC (CLS) from BUY to HOLD.11/09/2018 Jefferson Research downgraded CELESTICA INC (CLS) from BUY to HOLD.What a mess."

"Market reaction to a strong quarter is not what I expected, but I think we are going to bounce off the previous resistance and continue upward momentum. The company has a well diversified business, including defence and government contracts, as well as global reach. Quite glad having it in my portfolio."
Time to climb to $20 where it’s PE and revenue would be better aligned with the industry.
