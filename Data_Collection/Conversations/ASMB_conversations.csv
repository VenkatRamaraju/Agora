Don't direct me to do d and d...copy and paste the evidence of your claim that the ATM is proof management thinks it has NOTHING. Lol of getting more than a vague response."

Since mid 2019 it appears like a group of ex-Gilead folks have taken over ASMB--That seems to me to be a good enough reason to be buying this issue at or below cash level.Plus they've been hiring and still have 10 spots open according to their website.
"Google, and this was just three months ago i July. There are others: ""Assembly will receive an upfront cash payment of $40 million and is eligible to receive up to approximately $500 million in potential development, regulatory and net sales milestone payments pending successful development and commercialization of the licensed candidates. In addition, Assembly is eligible to receive tiered royalties of net sales. BeiGene will contribute initial funding for clinical development in China, after which the development costs for the territory will be shared equally by the parties."""
"News about a poster session (a poster for a poster session is something every graduate student at every university will make) sent this stock up? A poster session, about not even clinical trial level data, is not newsworthy. Market cap of ~350 Million. These gains, for this cause, shouldn't stick. This shouldn't even be happening."

So they added 2.2 million shares to the float underwritten at $ 27 when the stock was 28. Then the same underwriters Jeffries and Blair start coverage and give it a $50 price target. Then they exercise their option for an additional 330k shares at 27and the stock goes to 50. No conflict of interest here.

Why would anyone want to invest in this company or use its product (if successful) if they do get infected with the Hepatitis B Virus?
