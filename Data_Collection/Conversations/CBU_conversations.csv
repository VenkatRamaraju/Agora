Could there be a stock split coming for CBU? What do you think!

"People like Jonathan can have their splits; I could care less if I have X shares or 3X, since I realize the number of shares I own is not really very relevant (in a vacuum), but the VALUE of a position sure is! In the long run, a company's valuation is based on its fundamentals that are interpreted via several different metrics. The number of outstanding shares is not one of them.Another thing that helps support a stock is its dividend.I'll take a dividend increase, like CBU's recent 11.76% increase any day, since I will be receiving more cash per share; splits? like I wrote, I'll leave them for the likes of the ""Jonathans"" of the world."

Insider selling is very encouraging. They want to sell us more or their shares. Thanks.
The insiders selling speaks for it self. Their none banking benefits administration business just went through a complete reshuffle as they are loosing significant market share. The bank has been making acquisitions over the past three years that have not worked out due to company culture. This is very similar to what happened with FNFG. Take your profit and get out while you can. This stock will trade in the $50 range by May 2020.

"While expected, it was nice to see the recent dividend announcement. Two cent increase rather than a penny, as was the case for the past two years.I'm a former MBVT shareholder and it had been, I believe, over ten years, since it had increased its dividend."

"Well, a penny is better than nothing. If there was no streak, I doubt there would have been an increase."

"CBU ""closed"" its deal with MBVT 5/12, but MBVT shareholders have yet to receive their compensation.I spoke with a rep from my brokerage firm and he stated the delay is due to the various payout options (even though the deadline for MBVT shareholders to make their election was a few weeks before the closing date).What year is it???I'd think a basic Excel spreadsheet would be able to provide the data quite easily and quickly."
"Boy, I started following UultiamteSstoockAalerrts - and they are better than anyone else."
Overpriced.
Pretty small dividend increase compared to some of the prior years. Yes we do notice these things.
