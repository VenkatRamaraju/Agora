I was getting tired of losing all my cash to the markets so I found these guys that produce one solid stock pick a week. So far their plays have been awesome. Just go to https://investingstrategiesnow.blogspot.com/ .
I have been pounding the table looking for a good place to park this cash and I finally found a website that send out income producing plays once a week. If you are like me and are interested in strong dividend plays just go to https://stockdorkalerts.blogspot.com/ .
The insiders selling speaks for it self. Their none banking benefits administration business just went through a complete reshuffle as they are loosing significant market share. The bank has been making acquisitions over the past three years that have not worked out due to company culture. This is very similar to what happened with FNFG. Take your profit and get out while you can. This stock will trade in the $50 range by May 2020.

Insider selling is very encouraging. They want to sell us more or their shares. Thanks.

"C'mon Trytulski, SPLIT the stock for cryin' out loud!!!!!!Last one was 13 years ago."
Pretty small dividend increase compared to some of the prior years. Yes we do notice these things.
"It's just about time for CBU to announce its annual dividend (increase).Recently expectations have been reduced, from a 2 cent per Q hike to a penny per Q increase--per (subscription) Bloomberg."

"People like Jonathan can have their splits; I could care less if I have X shares or 3X, since I realize the number of shares I own is not really very relevant (in a vacuum), but the VALUE of a position sure is! In the long run, a company's valuation is based on its fundamentals that are interpreted via several different metrics. The number of outstanding shares is not one of them.Another thing that helps support a stock is its dividend.I'll take a dividend increase, like CBU's recent 11.76% increase any day, since I will be receiving more cash per share; splits? like I wrote, I'll leave them for the likes of the ""Jonathans"" of the world."
"Is this stock ever gonna SPLIT? Last one was 2004 when it was around 45$Bought it the 20's,good dividend BUT WHEN????"
