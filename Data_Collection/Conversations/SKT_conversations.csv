"I did find long term close fit to retail REIT etf over the last 5 years stock price is heading down hill at nearly identical slope. Its not as bad as it looks because SKY and retail REITS in general pay good dividend. Looks to me that for SKT it's more than baked in. They do seem to be at risk if cost of loans went up substantially from 3.5% they are paying. From what I have seen management knows how to balance dividend, stock buyback, loan pay down and asset sales. The way I see it is if they can keep affo steady then it's about a 10% return from here but I really would be happy with with any total return over 5% with the overall market so overvalued."
Switching over to SPG to get the better dividend. GLTA
"Simon properties just raised its dividend back up recently having lowerd it due to covid, Tanger did the same thing lowerd the dividend due to Covid,look for Tanger to Start rasing the dividend sooner then latwer back up to the dividend avg. of 7-8% range!opinion only g luck"
"Shorty and Very Low Volume on SKT, this stock is just waiting to Blast off, Once the BIG Sustained BUYING Volume Starts , Shorty will need to Start Buying Back Shares, all equals Skt Target of 20-22 PLUS, with a Compounding Dividend of 4% plus ,and Motley Fool thinks Tanger Will Raise dividend to Pre covid levels of 7-8%, Yahoo Finance has some good Current articles on SKT, so Lock in on this LOW price Point Plus Dividends, opinion only g luck"
SPG bought Taubman Realty Group late 2020. I believe Tanger could be next on their radar. New Tanger CEO (while at spg) probably helped work on that deal. Taubman family kept 20% interest. I can see old man Tanger looking for similar arrangement. Do your own research and comment what you think buyout price could be.
"Well we’ll well…..wouldn’t want to be short SktIt’s going to 18-20 very soon, this time it might hit 22-25 with momentum, with the Big Short position, this stock could gain Huge momentum at 22 level, at that pointShorts will have to bail or get burned hard for the first time in a long time Skt could tame shorts slowly or Rocket style….So go long, enjoy the Compounding dividend and watch this stock hit 20s soon and pop as shorts bolt fasterOpinion only g luck"
"Current SKT market cap is $626 million. Here’s info:“A portfolio of 39 upscale outlet shopping centers. Tanger's operating properties are located in 20 states and in Canada, totaling approximately 14.3 million square feet, leased to over 2,800 stores which are operated by more than 510 different brand name companies. The Company has more than 39 years of experience in the outlet industry.”That’s $16 million per outlet center. $223,000 per store, land & building & common areas. Try to duplicate that. This won’t last forever. Outlet centers are important distribution channels."
"Worry will continue to weigh this down.....worry that more shoes will drop and there will be more vacancy than they have baked into forecast. So far they have run fast enough on the treadmill to replace tenants which have left. But, next year they already have 187,000 sq ft to fill when Dress Barn leaves as of December 31. They are working to fill that empty space now. So, by the time December 31 rolls around they may have some of that space already leased. Also, they are keeping the vacancies at a minimum by putting pop ups in place. Some of these pop ups are temporary and some may morph into long term tenants. This is a war. It always has been a war and will always be a war. As they said on the conference call they have seen their mix of tenants change dramatically. The prominent tenants 10 years ago are not prominent now. The prominent tenants now probably won't prominent in 10 years. They have to keep fighting, keep adapting, keep innovating and curating new tenants. Vineyard Vines was a pop up trial. Now it is a successful long term tenant. This is all part of the game. All the changes in tenants over the 10 year period and they are still 96% leased. The short term reward me now millennials that are now analysts and are writing the algos don't understand that time heals lots of wounds. It takes time to adjust, adapt and work out problems. But, problems do get worked out. Eventually these young reward me know people will grow and mature and understand how patience pays off."
"Hello…..Skt just completed a offering on notes of $400 millionThey are using that to redeem Sr. Notes equaling like $390 mAll to be completed by middle of September 2021 this yr!!!Skt just had blowout earnings,..Skt at 98% occupancy and 98% current on all back rent from Covid Skt pays a 4% Compounding dividend, they cut it in half for Covid But they average 7-8% , so with earnings up up look for a dividend raise sooner then later Tanger Outdoor malls are hugely thriving and expanding plus diversification in tenets The trade range pre and post Covid if ruffly 15-20, at 17.25 Skt is a huge buy…..Opinion only Gluck"
I went through the numbers to determine whether to sell before the earnings report comes out. Best I can tell the report will be a beat with revenue and FFO exceeding expections. So I will be holding onto ally shares. Best I can tell FFO will be $1.63 - $1.64 for the year. Not bad for what we went thru with the virus.
"Hi Folks, Bob here. I am thinking to make a purchase on SKT shares. I just left wal mart, it is the only place I can currently get a pair of shoes. I had to settle for a pair of cheap loafers. While i was buying, everyone around me seemed to be infected with the covid 19 coronavirus. Kids crawling over the shopping carts sniffling and sneezing. I was glad to get out of there to say the least. I hope that I dont catch the coronavirus and that I live to shop at Tanger’s open air shopping centers soon. I will buy SKT stock shares with my next $1,200 stipend."
"FYI....Shortys added about a million shares from aug to sept to ruffly 24% float!!!Someone was betting on Delta and shortys holding DOWN SKT, at 16 range, BUT........Delta Bump almost passing now, GOVT is Staying Open for now, Market Volumes picking up, Everyone IS Recommending and LOVING SKT Currently, just rasied dividend and it looks like its going to around 8%, COMPOUNDING Dividend soon possibly.....So if your a SHORTYS , you got to be WORRYING about that FLOAT 24%, and if this Market turns up Fast, Shortys will take weeks to cover in a Shorty Squeeze coming soon, look for 20-22 range , with momentum 25to 35 plus where it was in 2016-17, BUY BUY BUY, opinion only g luck folks.."
"No need to buy or sell here if long term investor. It's reasonably priced. If we go into recession, you can pick up shares on sale."

Bond rates go up ; dividend rates go up.
Management is pleased with beyond expectations results. Ocupancy rate has gone up to impressive 97 percent. Rent increase over 2.7 percent.
They will start opening some locations again in the next few weeks. Most governors are ready to open and get the economy in their state moving again. Lots of free money handed out to people ready to go shopping. Lots of retailers with outdated merchandise to sell through outlets. The shorts won’t let go of this one easily. Most have doubled down on the ride up to $8 and want to push it down to at least $5 before covering. Long term this is one of the best values in the market. GLTA
Sell the news..but not tomorrow. Will close even higher Thurs or Friday based on recent patterns. Patience will be rewarded.
Steven and the SKT board should consider designing an electric truck. Fill any vacant store fronts as showrooms.
Tanger Factory outlet malls were record crowds this weekend This company has turned the corner and is headed back to its all time highs It has a lot to do with people moving from NYC when they go to the Tanger shopping centers they fall in love the place because it is such a wonderful change from the grungy run down shopping centers in NYS and the people who work at the Tanger Malls are the friendliest most professional people at of any other Business .
"If skt is so great, how come the share price has been on a steady decline for years?"
"All the hated stocks are down today in tandem, there is a big velocity trade going on to short stocks that have underperformed and buy large cap stocks that have over performed. Not sure when this will stop, but if you can find the bottom you will make a bunch of money when values return to normal."
Brad has been high on this stock for years and it has done nouthing but go down ! Huge dividend because it has fallen so far! Nobody invests to lose money. Why is there such an enormous short position in a stock that is expensive to short? I wanna buy because it’s gone down so much and looks like a good value but it keeps going down ! Where is the bottom?
"Take Big Advantage of any dips, Lock IN on 4% dividend and LOW Stock Price ... 20-22 Target, Motley Fool is now liking TANGER OUTLETS, and RAISING the Dividend BACK UP to Pre Covid levels , of 7-8%opinion only g luck folks"
"My emotions tell me to buy here. But like a pilot who is trained to rely on his instruments when no visibility, my brain repeats: 1. Don't try to catch a falling knife, 2. Don't chase yield, 3. Don't bottom fish."
"If shorts are driving stock price lower and lower, what is the end game ZERO? I am really amazed that this stock just can't get any king of traction at all. Dividend is great but not if we just keep loosing principle. I continue to try and research this stock but come across nothing but praise for low debt, good FFO, easily covered div etc.."
The wife and I will be driving to DC this weekend. Just heard the money trees are in bloom.
"Congrats all. Please don’t forget to analyze fundamentals. Again, SKT is not GME. Solid business, but how many times FFO do you want to pay for it? It will be very volatile in the short term if there is no div increase for several quarters."
"short squeeze can easily drive it to $25/share getting it to a proper yield for a safe, high dividend, REIT."
Nice article today on the short position and upcoming squeeze. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4289529-tanger-short-squeeze-waiting-happen
Just left Tanger in Myrtle Beach. Bought myself 2 pairs of crocs buy one get one free. Tuesday 1pm and a constant stream of foot traffic. The only store I saw vacant was the old Justice store. Ann and Loft open. Izod has 80% off sale. By my calculations this location is basically at full occupancy. And here’s the kicker folks: The bag to feet ratio is a solid 2 to 1.
Thank you SKT for answering my question about Nashville!
I'm going to give some advice from 30 years experience on Wall Street working for all the big Banks in the equity divisions. when you have a lot of debt on the balance sheet and your stock goes on a rocket launch you have to be ready to do an offering to share up the balance sheet if you listen to the earnings call this company had in February their cash flow burn rate is higher than what they're taking in as far as rents go it's a no-brainer that when the stock spikes they're going to do an equity offering that's going to put a cap on the stock my bet is that comes at 18 plus 20.
"FYI...had to post again here today, its noon est, and SKT has traded only 83,000 shares......ouchhhh, it averages abot 850,000 plus per day!!! Can we all say THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM, for SHORTYS, with a HUGE SHORTY positions, and Float.......hummmmmm it will take weeks to BAIL OUT of shortys positions, Shortys already have Huge profits in SKT, BUT they Best be Taking there Profits while the getting is good , THIS TIME, because when the BUYERS Start Flooding into SKT soon, BIG BUYING VOLUME days are coming very very soon, and SKT is Highly recommended these days with the Dividend increase and 8% dividend is very possible COMPOUNDING dividendes, plus Great Earnings blowout coming AGAIN soon... look for a run into 20s soon, by x-mas, with momentum up to 30 plus in 2022, SKT was near 40 in 2016-17, and its a Far bigger better Company today, opinion only g luck folks"
"The more important number to monitor as short interest declines isn't the # of shares shorted, but the total dollars shorted. That has been rising drastically since September (of course due to the rising share price) and is indicative of the increasing loss and pain the shorts are experiencing even as their total share interest declines. While this trend keeps increasing, we are still progressing towards a likely short squeeze."
"This is complex. Stores/companies are getting bailout money also. It may take a month or two but it seems geared towards helping with employee expenses and utilities possibly. No rent/lease considerations from what I understand. It does take away the I can't pay rent because of employee costs excuse. So it really boils down to the lease, considerations and/or enforcement of lease terms. SKT should release a statement on where they stand with current tenants. ie... no payment, deferred payment, partial payment, full payment, enforcement of full lease terms. SKT should indicate if they are going to still buy back shares. Every share repurchased at $5 saves 1.43 annually or 25-30% of the current share price and can greatly reduce the annual divi payout commitment. Would like to hear from SKT where they stand. It would make it much easier to commit more money because I think they can still make full divi payments if they are committed to shareholders. I also believe stores can continue to make lease payments because there will be enough stimulus relief in other areas to continue making payments."
4 VERY good reasons to buy this stock:1)Vaccine is here2) Stimulus Package Coming...cash flow already improving...big time 3) Divedends will return soon...within months4) Simon is most likely going to aquire them* (better than 50% chance)its all good news:~)
They beat estimates EARNING 2 cents a share instead of the estimated LOSS of 6 cents per share
"Delta is beginning to rollover. It did the same thing in Israel and England, etc. CNN will need to find something else to try to frighten the lemmings.Remember, wear your masks. I wear mine and have it covering my bald spot so I don't get sunburned when fishing."
"To be exact; this is a classic short squeeze candidate. Shares short, 45,000,000. Float: 90,000,000. Days to cover: 17 days at the average daily volume. This is the reason I bought a ton of this, in addition to the improving numbers and the solid financial position."
Hey Guys I just got Larrys Book. Chapter 3: The main way retail investors lost money in 2020: Selling their Tanger shares at all time lows after listening to people on yahoo message boards. #OCD4life
"Let it be known, there’s an Billy impersonater on here. Heretofore referred to as negative Billy. Do not confuse him with me, Bullish Billy. Long SKT. #fakeBilly"
At what point does Management step in advantageously? Where are the buybacks? The insider buying? The positive press releases? This is a very weak Investor Relations department.
Cash flow supports dividend long-term. I'm not a fan of the stock but dividend is fine.
"A thread of interesting notes from SPG earnings call:- “outlet tenants have recovered 90+% of sales”- unwilling to breakdown their outstanding rent by property type, even when pressed by analysts- did everything they could to avoid touting outlet performanceI was not in the “Simon makes an offer for Tanger” camp, but SPG’s earnings call sure seemed to point int hat direction."
"Today's HR Head announcement is interesting.I have over 40 years of major coorporation experience, but this is the first time i see HR reports to General Council (Legal).This can mean company has personnel issues. Or company is grooming the general council for better things."
"omg...fear...delta.....folks take HUGE advantage of this drop in price, delta is not going to shut down outdoor shopping, mask or no mask areas people are sick of being inside, and love to shop at OUTDOOR malls like TANGER , Back the truck up and, BUY BUY BUY opinion only g luck"
"Hold on tight, Monday morning earnings release. Isn't it strange the company waited until the market closed today to announce earnings before it opens again ? The shorts just got caught in a trap."
"Folks, there will be no lockdowns, at worst masking in certain areas, but not OUTDOOR MALLS, people are fed up with the government bs, people want to be out and about , and outdoor shopping is Thriving, Tanger outlets are Packed, so don?t buy into #$%$ down bs, DONT LET SHORTS BEAT SKT Down, off shutdown fears,Skt is a Buy here, it?s trade range is ruffly 15-20, with a 22 upside with momentum, so lock in on the Compounding dividend, and load up on any dips! Opinion only g luck"
"consumer spending held up thru the Delta speed bump, FOLKS go BUY a Truck load of SKT, outdoor shopping malls are thriving expanding, great dividend, BUY with a near term 20-22 target...forget the negitive Shortys that post on here BUY BUY BUY, opinion only g luck"
"I am very impressed with Tanger getting themselves prepared for the unknowable future. Less debt. Lower cost financing of debt, selling stock at good price and paying off debt are long term plays. Good chance this was peak retail spending year as stimulus winds down. A little rich to purchase at this price, but if you bought cheaper it's nothing wrong with holding."
"Shorts are struggling to keep SKT down, trying to FOOL Investors into thinking Skt wont POP into 20s soon,lock in on the 4% compounding dividend that should be raised back up to PRE Covid range of 7-8% divBUY and LOAD UP on SKT with a 19-22 Targetopinion only g luck"
Mr Market is thinking there will not be any goods in discount market this Christmas.
Simon property group just raised its dividend Look for Tanger to possibly raise it dividend back up from dividend cut thru pandemic back to dividend avg of 7-8%Skt is a huge Buy moving forward big earnings ahead…Opinion only g luck
"Extremely common these days to draw down credit lines. Fear is the cash may not be there if banks cut back in the future. Indeed, many banks have quietly asked customers not to do this. But since net cash is $594 million, they could repay all but $6 million from cash on hand. And the deferral of rents is another cash drain.Two years of cash on hand is very good. Makes no sense to borrow $45 million per quarter to pay dividend. Tough times for sure and losing the dividend is painful, but no doom and gloom. Occupancy remains high even with horrible conditions. Store openings are improving. Dispels notion of raising equity at distressed prices. This company will survive. The road will be bumpy, but that’s how you make big money - ie, buying real estate in down markets."
"I read that Brad Thomas article over the weekend. I think he has a good point that I personally haven’t seen expressed elsewhere - that the issues in the retail environment are forcing retailers to rethink their business, esp distribution. Outlet malls are essentially an alternative distribution option. So, just like trying to expand online sales, getting traffic via having a presence in a good outlet mall has to be one of the options they try. My thinking is that Tanger has and will have more retailers knocking on the door. Eg TJX. That can only be a good thing for SKT."
"Just bought more. at $13.37. If it keeps going down, I'll keep buying more until it's 10% of my IRA. Haven't seen this quality an investment with this type of return since the 70's."
"Hmmm…Visited the Tanger outlet in CT shore this Saturday. Never saw the grounds / atmosphere looking so dingy and cheap. I’ve been keeping my thumb on foot traffic with an eye on investing, but not now. Anyone else seeing what I’m seeing?"
they can buy all outstanding stock with their line of credit. Way undervalued!
"New Covid cases down 16% nationwide and the death rate growth is plateauing, give it a few weeks and optimism will emerge. Then investors will stop plowing money into Zoom and other pandemic stocks and focus on those overly punished, like retail stocks. I think this is a no brainer from here for an easy double within 6-9 months."
If you think about it this is currently a sweet real estate investment. If you have a rental house I think in most areas of the country you would be hard pressed to get a return after expenses and taxes anywhere close to 9%. Holding this in a Roth is really a good deal. You can hold a rental house in a Roth but I don't think it is practical. There has been a big swing in value comparison as many stocks have boomed this year while SKT has went down. Got to be bold if your are a value investor and buy quality when out of favor based on future cash flows. Tesla is $300 and this $15. There are lot of bagholders that just don't know it yet.
The latest short data for SKT is in from Yahoo. As of July 30 there is now 42 million shares that are short. An increase of 3.5 million shares from July 14. The shorts are very determined! I am long and looking forward to reinvesting all my dividends into more shares on August 15th.
"What do the shorts know? Why are they encouraged to and comfortable holding a short position that 1) costs them $1.42 per year per share they are short which at this price is a 7.8% carrying cost. 2) on a stock that is trading at a 40% discount to other retail REITs 3) That is trading at a 40% discount to its historic valuation 4) that is already trading 20% below its 200 day moving average 5) That is already sold short at an extreme level with 30% of the outstanding shares sold short 6) To make that even more extreme it comes in the face of the company having authorized a buyback of up to 5% of the outstanding shares at this price. This is just going to be an interesting year to see how this plays out. Will we see these 40 remaining outlet centers crater and somehow lose more tenants than expected? Will we see these remaining outlets have to give more extreme rent concessions on the 10% of expiring leases? Will we see a dramatic drop in FFO so that dividend will have to be cut? For this stock to have a justified drop from here these will have to come true. But, from reading the companies comments that sure isn't what they expect. This earnings report is critical. Can't wait to hear their outlook. Also would love to not only see the company buying back stock aggressively, but some of the insiders buying as well. If they believe what they are telling us we should see them buying personally."
"From ""Anthony"" 11 days ago: ""There’s an article out there from the Terrell Tribune in Texas saying Tanger sold an outlet center this August , I wonder how this would affect this quarters numbers ? You can google it I’m trying to post a link""I forgot this post for a few days but now looked at the balance sheet 2019: Terrell build for 24.044 M$ - Depreciation 19.154 M$ = 4.9 M$ book value for 177.800 square feet means per square feet = 27,5 $.I don´t know the selling price but it must be a multiple of that.The last three quarter earnings were impacted each by a huge impairment charge to write down earnings and save cash flow. If there will be no other impairment charge, good rent collections and this extraordinary gain from selling terrell the numbers will be great.Your comment is appreciated :-)"
One thing the shorts never point out is the long-term bonds in Tanger aren't showing any stress. The 2026 bonds yield 2.61%. If there were worries about Tanger long-term it would show up in the bond market.
"Steven Tanger[...] I mean let's put it into perspective. In the third quarter, we only bought back $10 million worth of stock. And at the end of the second quarter, we only bought back $10 million worth of stock. So at the same time, we paid down $140 million in debt. We -- it is a balanced approach, and I don't want to get into our internal calculations of asset value, but you can assume since we bought back our stock that we thought it was undervalued."
I might have the record of having bought shares at $4.10 and sold shares at $20.25. But I have bought many shares at end of 2019 too high and and sold some at depressed pricing. Its been a modest gain in total about 20 -25% on a little over a year holding the stock. All of the gains have been this week basically.
"I am actually surprised how the shorts are hanging on with this one. Being short a company that has the financial optimism to reinstate its dividend sounds like a losing game to me. And in fact, a short is responsible for paying any dividends on stock they effectively ""create"", making it unpleasant to short dividend paying stocks for the long term. Unless you see a train wreck on the horizon, shorting a high dividend REIT with this much confidence in their earnings stream, before a possible reopening boom, just seems like playing Russian Roulette."
"Check out those on Wallstreetbets talking about SKT. ""SKT Possible short squeeze"" I have a long position but if someone wants to impact the shorts I am good with that. Tanger's operations will only improve as individuals get to the outlets and stores sell their products. Tanger's balance sheet is solid and the properties are in good condition. I am glad this is being discussed on Wallstreetbets. I hope this short interest gets hammered. Good luck to all."
"Reddit crowd is starting to list stocks there liking after earnings, SKT after BLOWOUT earnings Should make that next list after earnings, and if SKT decides to raise the dividend, look out folks, Buy into the EARNINGS, opinion only g luck"
"Just keep ADDING shares, PLUS HIGHER Dividend at this price point, BUY BUY BUY, opinion only g luck"
All of us longs are waiting for a short squeeze but it may never happen. Could be that it just plays itself out as the stock flat lines for an extended period and/or the shorts get bored and move on. The thing is - Management needs to do something aggressive to combat the shorts or nothing will happen!
"With a short ratio of 10 and ~16 million shares short of a ~100 million shares float, I'd be nervous with a short position if the reddit crowd got this back on their radar."
Forward dividend is 4.4 %. Worth considering.
"SKT valuation is rising as interest rate is lowered. It is recruiting new tenants to replace the old. Short sellers were assuming it cannot get new tenants is totally wrong. While I shorted Pier 1 Imports, I am long SKT as it offers great value propositions for retailers and consumers"
I am going to dig into results more. I liked they upped guidance. I liked that they paid down debt and improved equity to debt ratio. I like dividend payout to FFO and FAD is about 50%. Dividend looks secure with room for increases. They sold stock at just under $19 to raise cash. Guidance at $1.57 FFO x 10 gives $15.70. Maybe $15.70 - $18.75 is correct range.
"Why would Tanger make any statements!! They clearly stated in their yearly report that they had another $80 million in funds they intent to use to by back the stock. The De-listing from a main RIET index is perfect for them to get as many shares as possible at low cost. Once they have fully repurchased they may make more announcements.Tanger has reduced its outstanding consolidated debt by $143.1 million since December 31, 2018.During 2019, the Company repurchased approximately 1,209,000 common shares for total consideration of approximately $20.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, $80.0 million remains under the current repurchase authorization, which is valid through May 2021."
SKT just exceeded yahoo prise point
"Tanger just said that their malls are at 90% of pre-coronavirus levels, but the stock is still on sale at 50% off. This is truly a unique opportunity, Americans will travel by car this year right where SKT outlets are located, people need the bargain's Tanger's outlets offers, and shopping for clothes online remains difficult. Easy 50% to 100% return from here."
"SKT undervalued imho.""The pandemic isn't over yet, but shoppers at Tanger Factory Outlet Centers' (NYSE: SKT) properties are acting like it is. The outlet center operator's fourth-quarter report was full of good news and signs that the company is on a clear path to recovery."""
"The way I see it, this movement will not stop until the SEC start regulating the hedge funds shorting. At which point that’s also a win for us retail investors. Until then they cannot stop us from discussing about stocks and investing. People will use other brokerage firms to continue this movement. Look for a bounce back this upcoming week. We won’t be muted and our freedom restricted! $AMC $GME $BBBY $NOK $KOSS $SKT"
Stanley Tanger said it best...Inflation will drive people to places like tangers to look for bargins from top companies. Stock could rise to 40 dollars very easy!!!!!!!!!
"Will be looking at the numbers tonight, but I am mostly interested in current foot traffic. That is the foundation everything is built on as foot traffic leads to sales leads to rent payments leads to free cash flow."
Unbelievable that Robinhood is going to trade the whole float volume today. For a company conceived to allow hedge funds to front run how beautiful to front run the whole float in one day. Somebody is going to get fleeced and the robber will be living on an island somewhere.
"Screaming buy down here. 1. Outdoor discount retailer, not an enclosed mall or Dept Store. Think TJ Maxx or Ross. 2. Assets trading for below replacement cost at these levels. 3. Dividend is only 60 million a quarter, so likely stays.4. Texas peak deaths were on 30 people a day. Stores already opening next week. 5. 50% of the float short. Too much negativity.6. trading way below its trendlines. 7. Balance sheet is strong and many tenants are paying rents8. Any tenants who put off paying rent is already baked into these pricesTook a large position yesterday and today. Expecting a massive massive squeeze whenif they announce the dividend stays in tact."
"Just left Tanger outlets, I performed the monthly foot traffic investigation the dirty myrtle location. Traffic is heavy. Even the dogs have bags in their hands. Parking lot is 3/4 full. Lines to get in several stores, including under armor. New Champion store Is up and running (go HBI!!). Also a new store that sells salsa and hot sauces and bbq sauce, looks like it could be a winner. It is high season right now at the beach. Hopefully the trend continues. There’s your insider info folks. Signing off, Bob. Senior Foot Traffic Investigator."

"just curious, have they ever cut dividends before? if not, I love the 7%+ payout..."
"Folks I’ve been buying and loading up on SKT since 12-13 range , and I continue to add to my positions on the Shorty dips , Now HUGE dividend increases COMPOUNDED , load up buy buy buy to the  moon shot… lol upset like shorty, kids…."
1.46 billion debt. why not pay that off first. why even pay a dividend if you owe money.
"Panic down day, I bought more as you sell. Tanger total market cap is ~$600 million. Cash on hand is $443 million. So, you could buy this company for a net of $150 million, after using SKT cash on balance sheet. This is for a company that produced $223 million in FFO last year. Yes revenues and FFO flatish to slightly down the last few years, been a tough market for retail obviously, but not majorly so. This company is priced like its headed to bankruptcy, if you don't believe it is, then this is an incredible buying opportunity. SPG or a big player will buy up this company or sanity will return and the stock will recover as pure valuation now comes into play. Lastly, those who talk about ""book value"" on a REIT like this have no idea what they are talking about, book value under GAAP is meaningless. Asset are valued in use, as a going concern, not GAAP historical book value."
longs are going to get hosed. not much has improved about scat since before the pandemic. it's the slow drip of a dying business model.
"This is the last day to buy the stock and be entitled to the dividend.Should be a bad day for anyone short. watch the 2 to 4 PM period, when anyone short PEI gets a lot of incentive to cover. Margin calls come in about 2 pm, and if still short after the close - the short seller owes the dividend amount for all the shorted shares.Could be fun to be long and watch the tape! Maybe $18.00/share is touched later this afternoon and all us who are long SKT get at least an evening to bask in our glory."
"MAC has a new line of credit commitment. Even with the dilution, it is still worth $23 based on the 2021 FFO estimate"
Recent decline is attributable to tax loss selling. I believe we will see a big step up in early Jan as investors want to get in for 2020 ride up.
"I think you are correct long term. I am in the CRE industry, and 2 months ago, all retail owners were focused on being ""experience centers"" where they had stores you couldnt replace online (i.e. restaurants.) Frankly 60 days ago, there wasnt a better tenant than cheesecake factory, etc. I agree with the sentiment that these centers are well positioned to see an influx of shoppers relative to malls. The key issue in the short term is the percentage of collected rent. I actually dont think they will have a waive of defaults, but I do think they will have a significant percentage of their tenants that simply dont pay april, may, june, etc. or enter into some sort of financing arrangement (i.e. we wont pay rent for the next 4 months, and then we will pay 1.5 rent for the next 8 months.) The good news for SKT is that they seems to have a tremendous debt coverage ratio (meaning they cover the debt by a long way), and I can say from experience that any lender right now is offering to help keep loan afloat if they can. Depending on the loan type, they can go interest only or possibly reconfigure the payment stream. My guess... short term hit to dividend due to very low cash flow, followed by a medium recovery in Q3 and a pretty strong recovery in Q4 as people go out to shop and retailers start paying rent. To show you where I really feel, I am long 100 call options at an 8 strike for January."
"Statement released near the close from Tanger: Nashville project is delayed, most mall sites shut down, company to pay this coming dividend, has drawn done line of credit.....excerpt "" As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the stores in the Company's outlet centers are currently closed, with many having already been so for two full weeks. Operations in more than half of Tanger Outlet Centers are restricted by order of the local and state authorities, and additional orders are expected. The situation continues to evolve rapidly, and the Company has limited visibility into the duration and magnitude of the pandemic. Given this level of uncertainty regarding the impact to its business, Tanger is withdrawing its 2020 guidance."""
This new refinancing just save us 1% on about $400 million.Plus extend maturity date by about 8 years.Nice work.
Bad week to be Champ.
"Just read the ER conference call transcript. Love how much attention management pays to the sales-per-sq ft metric. Good indicator of the Outlet mall value prop to retailers. Also, recapturing the space of underperforming retailers like Kitchen Collection and tired brands like Dress Barn ($140 sales per sq ft vs SKT avg of close to $400) only means good things ahead. Now they can bring in fresh, relevant brands with more appeal to today’s consumer. I can’t wait to hear who they are working with!"
"70,000 put options on March 10,11&12 contracts. That’s a large belief this stock is heading that way. Long SKT. Not really a stock trader but bought a couple thousand shares last fall. Company looked solid financially and I drive by a couple outlets regularly. GLTA"
"18,800,000 shares shorted during this past wednesday and thursday. Short position for SKT is getting larger. Reddit people are probably looking at this."
"Wow, Tanger is my only stock in the red today. I guess I am diversified!"
"Barron's wrote an article yesterday stating the positive news of SKT re-instating the dividend a couple of days ago. This will catch the eye of many who want to invest in SKT now that it is paying a dividend again. This, combined with all the positives for SKT now, combined with the extremely high short interest which will take many days for the shorts to cover should send the stock continually upward. We could even see a short squeeze this upcoming week to a price in the mid teen's."
"I’m buying more here @$13.76. Divvy is 10.4%, well covered and just raised. Short interest way too high. If o have to hold long term that’s ok. I realize 2020 there are unknowns, feel like they were conservative and will work to find new tenants. Price/AFFO is too low"
"Any time SKT DIPS, BUY BUY BUY, if you Bought the RECENT dips as i posted, your up nice already, HEADING up to 20-22 PLUS, Skt.... JUST RAISED COMPOUNDING DIVIDEND$$$$BUY ANY DIPS, opinion only, g luck folks"
Tanger should forget the dividend and purchase shares as fast as possible. It would be much better for us all in the long run. Repurchasing shares at this price might even be better than developing Nashville.
"""With retailers now allowed to reopen, customers traffic is back to 80% of pre-pandemic levels at properties in the state that are owned by Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc., according to Chief Executive Officer Steven Tanger."""
"In a long reply post I gave the following reasons I think in person retail looks good going forward:1. Shopping at outlet malls is as much a social activity as it is resource gathering so post pandemic pent up demand will spike traffic; particularly out outlet malls where there are outdoor spaces and spring is here. 2. Most people prefer to judge color, fit, feel and smell of shoes, clothes, accessories and perfumes (which constitute most of Tanger's outlet stores) in person not via a small low res picture on a web page. 3. Online retail works well for known quantities or commodities that are repurchased repeatedly but most people only want one of a particular apparel item and fashions change every year whether we want them to or not. Another thought is that with construction resources and materials so tight that new houses can't be built fast enough to satisfy demand how hard will it be to build or refurbish retail space to meet the increased demand that is inevitable as the pandemic loses its grip? I don't see a lot of new retail space popping up to compete with Tanger Outlets over the next year or so. I see a lot more potential upsides for STK than downsides and recent events indicate that the people running this company know what they are doing and are far from reckless when it comes to resource and financial management. Max L.Max L."
Rumor has it the vaccines side effects includes uncontrollable shopping. I would imagine this is good news for us.
Physical outlet retail sales numbers have been great the last few reports. Christmas shopping season is right around the corner. Short squeeze is inevitable.
"I don’t get the negative sentiment pushing this stock down. Company beats on earnings, comes up with creative ways to fill empty space, brings in major growth name (TJX), raises outlook, reaffirms very generous dividend, very little China exposure, and stock goes down."

"It’s hard to foresee where this virus shutdown goes over next few weeks or months. But if grocery stores, drug stores, post offices and home improvement stores etc can stay open and adopt some common sense guidelines (distancing, face masks, etc) and the numbers continue going down, then I think there will be increasing pressure from various constituencies to open (in some limited fashion) other types of stores and establishments. Somebody somewhere is going to start a ruckus about why they are being treated unfairly and being forced out of business. I’m leaning towards an earlier opening than most people... Thoughts?"

"I think are are several factors as to why this SKT has been an under the radar stock.First, the name recognition, AMC, GameStop, BlackBerry, Express; All these companies have some degree of nostalgia for the Reddit crowd.Second, SKT has only monthly options, a lot of the squeeze with AMC, BB and GME, was the fact that out of money weekly call options were being bought by the millions, so when share price exceeded the strike price of these once-out-of-money options, market makers were forced to buy stock to cover those calls, increasing demand even more.If you look at the SKT option chain for the Feb call options, there is quite a bit of open interest at the previous most out of money strikes @$20, and folks have started to buy the new highest @25. If this short sqeeze mania is still in vogue in a couple weeks, we could see a big short sqeeze the week of Feb 15th. But this would require a lot more buying of both out of money call options and pushing the stock price above those strike prices."

Tried to find some comparisons. Seems like since around Dec 10 the riskier part of the market like Tesla and junk bonds have outperformed where Tanger and long term treasuries have underperformed. That might be a good sign as I think most of us would doubt if Tesla is worth $420 losing money and Tanger is worth $14 making $2.28 affo. Fed adding new liquidity makes markets more risk on. If div goes to 10% you would think that stock can't go thru all of next year at $14 price. I am pretty sure SKT div is secure for next year at least.
"Don't know about the other locations but near me the lines to get into Nike, UA, Adidas, AE, and Asics were 25-40 people deep at each store all weekend. The entire place was crowded...."
"It's all about price and growth. Tanger has built a good brand. With decline of bricks and mortar long term trend is against Tanger, but that seems more than priced in. They are in the discount space which is a positive. I think one of their strengths is their portfolio of locations. I think most are excellent but if bricks and mortar continue to decline they can prune their portfolio to their top performing assets and continue to buy back shares to shrink shares outstanding and make a smaller company with high performing assets. As long as returns on equity are 24% and price to book is 3.0 or less then they have a lot of options."
Myrtle Beach outlet was packed yesterday.
"Why buy a Retail related REIT that is showing flat to slightly declining revenues, the potential for rising vacancies and an industry that doesn't have organic growth? Here are some things to consider: 1) The price has declined to reflect these facts and thus it trades at 7.9 times FFO and it yields 7.5% 2) The dividend is a small percentage of FFO compared to most REITs that pay out 75% to 85% of their FFO, SKT pays out only 60% of its FFO, so the dividend is safe and has room to grow even in the face of an industry with little growth. 3) The balance sheet is very strong. Total debt to Total Assets of only 50%. 4) Company has a $100 million authorization to buy back stock and ample resources to follow through on it. They haven't bought a share in this downturn yet because of the blackout period. So, there is huge buying power waiting in the wings once the earnings reporting period is over. 5) At these low prices they can buy back enough stock to really effect FFO in the future which may provide upside to what is expected. 6) The current cycle of highly leveraged retailers which was caused by greedy Private Equity buyouts will eventually run its course and there are a host of well operated retailers with ample capital that will emerge and stabilize the future of retail. 7) Online shopping will continue to grow and the factory outlet model will have its place in the retail food chain, since Factory Outlet malls are inexpensive sources to present inventory to the public and since Factory Outlet stores don't have large boxes with anchor tenants to worry about and since the stores are easy to turnover with small leasehold improvement expenses they have a future. 8) Management is focusing on the right things in this downturn. Managing costs, managing vacancies, managing the balance sheet in a conservative way, managing the payout in a disciplined way, pruning and weeding the portfolio and just being patient and not trying to be the hero. Let the market settle and stabilize and be able to deal from strength when the timing is right."
Today's moves show Tanger is subject to fall with the market. Save some money in case SKT gets cut in half if the market tanks. We know they can pay out $0.71 even in a horrible downturn.
"I visited Tanger Outlets in Branson MO this past weekend. It Was Bustling with traffic. There was no where to park. From what I could tell all stores were open and I saw no empty store fronts. I was shocked it was packed, Alot of People were out shopping. It's True online shopping has surged and hurt this segment but people will always want to get out of the house and physically shop! I Like the open air store set up with all that's going on (Covid) as opposed to traditional indoor mall shopping. I see SKT over time bouncing back. It will take time but over the long run this stock will be profitable again."
Volume is so light on these big moves...anyone have an insight as to why?
"Stimulus passes next week. House and Senate passed. Tanger will go higher, shopping season. Popped to 21 a month ago, popped to 24 on high volume in premarket. Next pop will be even higher next week with stimulus. 6 month trend looking to go up. The pull back this week was needed in the uptrend."
"Tanger has a fantastic track record of strong performance. From 1993 through 2019, Tanger's year-end occupancy rate never dropped below 96%.At the end of the second quarter, Tanger's properties had a respectable-sounding 93.8% occupancy rate.The good news is that the worst of the pandemic is over. Tanger once again became cash-flow positive early in the third quarter of 2020 thanks to a decent 72% rent collection rate and smart expense management. As of July 31, 95% of Tanger's occupied stores had reopened.Throughout its history, Tanger has been a solid income stock, producing impressive results for investors. From 1993 through 2019, Tanger increased its dividend every year. From the 1993 IPO through the end of 2019, Tanger generated a 1,030% total return for investors (about 9.8% annualized). Even after the devastating impact of the pandemic, an investor who got into Tanger's IPO would be sitting on a 384% gain, assuming dividends were reinvested along the way.[pieced these tidbits together from an article on MillionAcres by Matt Frankel, dated August 29, 2020]"

I think the results are good - and the presentation was quality - the new outlet proposed also demonstrates confidence.
Fidelity loaned out my shares again today but this time I am only getting 2.375%
Can these outlet stores make enough money off the Christmas season to stay open for the remainder of the year? Or are the margins so thin now that they'd rather close up sooner rather than later. It's the survival between Christmas seasons I'm worried about.
I bought big this morning because the company is actually great and I truly want to keep outlets open for the awesome discounts and shopping experience. I'm just confused why the RHs / Wall street bets folks are not jumping on this way overshorted stock

"ahhhh, here we are back in 19 range , about where SKT sold shares at 19 level a few mths back, yes it bounces up to 20 recently, even 22 in last 52 weeks, BUT its been 5 years since SKT has actually RUN up substantially, 38-40 Range, you may ask why, its very simple, SHORTS own and control the stock and in some ways the company, hard to build market cap and company, when it can ONLY give investors a 3.5-4% dividend ruffly, but no real Dollar Apprication in the stock, unless you want to day trade it, or Bi weekly or Bi Mthly trade Skt in its Trade Range Which is, basically 15 on the low side , 17 mid, and 20-22 top range last few yearsso unless you by SKT at say 15 with a 4% dividend, and sell it at around 20, thats what it is , not bad , 5 dollar return with 4% dividendthe BIG QUESTION is, will SKT EVER EVER actually RUN UP again to the 30s much less 40 Range, Anyone and EVERYONE that knowns SKT and stocks, KNOWS SKTs HUGE SHORT situation for years now, PRE and POST VIRUS, SKT has been RUN CONTROLLED by SHORTS, try as the BUYERS and LONGS may, the shorts let it run alittle then beat it back down like clock work, Skt tiers up sometimes because Buyers start Trying to come in and see it run up, to have it Knocked down by shorts etcIF there is EVER EVER a time for SKT to make that run to 30s 40 range its NOW, next 2-6 quarters, SKT with EVERYTHING opening, RENTS are paided at 94% ruffly or better now, EXPANDING OUTDOOR OUTLETS at EXACTLY the right time POST Virus, the 3.76% dividend at this price is enticing when COMPOUNDED, Earnings are going UP UP next few quarters with so much OPENING up, Tanger MALLS are packed i will say from personal exp. everywhere,this stocks made alot of money for me long and short, IM LONG now and i think its worth the Respectable dividend compounded for the next 6-8 qtrs, and see if FINALLY enough BUYERS might come in for a sustained period of time , and in MY OPINION a Slow Squeeze would have to happen at worst, at best a Rocket Squeeze, eitherway , DONT depend on what Shorts might do, Go In on SKT, LONG ,,for the dividendthe Growth, the Opening coming full circle as JULY approaches etc and GOOD Things Come with Time, now MIGHT be the time for a SKT RUN UP, OPINION ONLY good luck folks..."

"So with today’s share price you can purchase Tanger at the june 2001 price. Since just 2001 a lot has happened. Real estate appreciation was huge from 2001 to 2007. And again from 2009 to today. Commercial space per sq foot and real estate values are up 100 to 200% since 2001 depending on where you are. Construction costs as well are up 100% over this time frame. Over the same time period tanger has opened new malls in NC, Texas, and canada, among others. And they have also sold several non core malls including 5 in 2015 and 4 last year using the proceeds to pay down debt. Tangier's share price has averaged over $20 bucks over this 20 year time frame as well. Just one way of looking at it, but I would say to buy prime commercial real estate at a 2001 price, today in 2020, is a pretty good deal."
It used to be a great business about $2 free cash on $5 of revenue. Hopefully 2022 we can be at $1 free cash on $4 sales. Not great but in zero rate environment might be worth $15 - $20/ share.

"Went back reviewing my accounts and saw where my first purchase was a big chunk of SKT in November at $14.32. so far worst purchase I have ever made in a stock. Remember thinking about $2 free cash and $1.42 dividend, seems like a good buy, especially since it was local and I had visited their headquarters and a couple of outlet malls.Bought many shares down all the way to $4.10. Sold 2/3 shares at $6.18 for vacation place. So far that's been ok as I have bought back some under $6. The last three years I have basically broke even investing, as I just got off my game when stocks got expensive and value went out of favor. We will see how it goes. Still feel good about Tanger at these prices, but with the future uncertain not sure I will ever get back to the number of shares I had, but probably will keep picking them up at sub $5.50 level."

I think we are at a point of capitulation. Company could borrow money and buy back shares and make a better return than the business. Would be a great buy for Kimco at this point.
"Looking for some crowd confirmation. Q3 CF Ops was $77m. That's probably a little high from a continuing basis perspective as they are recovering back rent from Q2. That said, Q4 will probably be similar or better as tenants repay back rent. Q3 P/L shows a 318m loss, almost entirely due to a paydown of mortgages to the tune of $400m. The balance is investing costs like upkeep, TI, commissions, etc.I am assuming that financing cash flow is discretionary as long as you have sufficient liquidity. Lets knock long term FCF Ops down to $65m/q and investing to 5m/q. You still get FCF of $60m/q or 240m/yr. There are 93.5m shares outstanding. Therefore, I am coming up with FCF/share of $2.57 per share. When you translate earning into a real estate company where you get massive depreciation in addition to non-booked appreciation, i am focused entirely on FCF, not earnings. Therefore, what would you pay for $2.57 per share of earnings? 10x? 15x? 5x? Its currently trading for 4.5x. AM I MISSING SOMETHING?Please, reasoned arguments preferred backed by numbers and logic."
Great earnings report and nice pop after hours. Things are improving.
"78% institution ownership. 46% short. Some serious institutional money is betting against this stock.

It is one of the best short squeeze candidates on the market. I am wondering why it is so subdued so far
"Since mr. retail loves this stock, the big shorters and hedge funds are keeping this down, manipulated for sure, no reason to be down after the great Q results. Company is SOLID. I'll take my 9% yield and hold"
"Hard to find a more illogically priced stock. SKT will undoubtedly (imo) be a huge beneficiary in a post covid world. Surviving retailers will clamor for an open air shopping experience to complement their digital presence. Quality of tenants should improve. Shorts( machines) have leaned on this, with much success, for several years. The tide is turning."
"Don't think the big move up in SKT has even happened yet! If the fast money crowd decides to come in, it will be at $50 very quickly. Considering the short percentage and trading float this would seem to be one of the best short squeeze stocks."

They should use the excess $$ from the new notes and from FFO to buy back the shares they issued this past year... anytime the price is less than the issue price.It's time they start returning capital to shareholders and put the short sellers in their place!!
"Eventually when the covod virus vaccinating regime plays out in the coming months....women who love these outlets will want to get out of the house and Tanger outlets are already seeing a return to active shopping...Tanger Factory Outlet's fourth quarter results for 2020 though show an impressive bounce back. Traffic during the quarter represented approximately 90% of prior year levels and increased to approximately 96% in January.Rent collections for the quarter improved to 95% of billed rents as of the end of January.""Our liquidity position is strong, with $84 million of cash and $600 million in unsecured lines of credit that were undrawn at the end of January,"" according to CEO Stephen Yalof."
looks like dividend increase after Thanksgiving and Christmas...
As of today I am now being paid 24.375% interest to loan out my 2000 shares. Together with the dividend this is an awesome investment return and will make me a very patient holder of this stock.
"Tried to find info on how many retailers we're paying rent. Only survey I could find was showing 50%.Tried to adjust Tanger's forecast with following assumption on revenue: first qtr no change, second qtr down 50%, third and fourth qtr down 25%. If you plug these numbers in you get a operating income loss of about $0.80 for the year and ffo of around +$0.40. First quarter dividend wipes out most of the free cash flow. Second quarter would be cash flow negative, but they have enough cash on hand to weather that. I suspect they will pay token dividend rest of year or suspend it altogether after first quarter payout.Since Fed has backstopped debt markets, I think Tanger will be able to continue to roll debt at current rates. Don't see the need for additional equity raise. It will be a tough year, but the world stopped functioning normally for a while. GLTA."
Even if they get the low-ball of 93-95% occupancy. Is it really that bad so the stock price has to go to all-time low? Check out the malls around you and see the rate of occupancy (They will be so happy with those figures). The fact is we know they are not cutting dividend (actually increase per the latest announcement). We also know SDY unloaded 22% of SKT before Feb 3 (And now is all done). Why people are panic selling at this price is beyond me. I starting buying yesterday and my average is now $13.81 and will enough the 10+% dividend until the panic selling is over. Will add more if it drops more (relatively risk free at this price range). Good Luck SKT Investors!
"Most likely economy is going to open in two months, stimulus will pass, inflation and economy coming back strong, outlet mall will be in better position"
"Cash pile is growing, current rental collection is 92%, there is no due debt till 2023. I didnt see any negative, SKT's position is much better than expected. In this pandemic, retailer was hit , not mall owners. We will see 7 dollars very soon."
"For SKT it's been a rapidly moving 2021 so far. What do we know?1) The dividend has been reinstated at $0.71 annualized. At the current price that is 5.4%2) The company has continued to be FFO-positive through the pandemic3) The $1.15 billion debt viewable via FINRA is trading above par, so the bond market is not nervous4) There was volatility in price around the excitement of the other ""to the moon"" stocks5) Price could not eclipse the 2017, 2018 highs and is back at 2019 lows6) There are 70,000 puts in the March contract in the $10, $11, $12 range. That's a lot, and if there are hedges against that, could explain some of the selling pressure. Max pain for March options is right at $13 given current OI7) Earnings come out on Feb 178) Another week before we get a peek at end of Jan short interest9) There will be no share repurchases until July 2021 at the earliest10) Foot traffic is good, but not greatIf you are a speculator, you probably should have moved on by now. If you are an investor, I think it is back to waiting to see how management does maneuvering economic reopening and managing leases. Personally, I think fundamentals support a low of $10 and $20 is too high.My guess is in the next six months the dividend is raised to around $1.00 annualized, as FFO stabilizes, before resuming FFO growth in 2022. Just my guess. My lame brain analysis for short term is buy below $12 and sell above $15 if those opportunities arise.Luck to you all"

"I was at the beach all day, and didn't even check the markets till after 6:00PM. if this opens down tomorrow,I'm going to nibble at a few hundred shares more,so i can lower my cost basis and collect some more of that yield. Maybe I'm wrong or I'm totally missing something,but i just don't see this company in trouble. they have strong cash flow,manageable debt,and they are investing in the business. I'm willing to roll the dice"

"Third Quarter ResultsNet income available to common shareholders was $0.14 per share, or $12.9 million, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $0.25 per share, or $23.2 million, for the prior year period. The current year period was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and is inclusive of a $0.02 per share, or $2.3 million, gain on the sale of a non-core outlet center located in Terrell, Texas.Funds From Operations (""FFO"") available to common shareholders and Core Funds From Operations (""Core FFO"") were $0.44 per share, or $42.6 million, compared to $0.58 per share, or $56.8 million, for the prior year period. Core FFO excludes certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance"
"Oh buy the way, us who hold the stock long are getting the dividend on February 12 and looking forward to growth once people are happy to get out without the government telling us there is a lock down. And we will spend the checks most of us will be getting soon."
Reviewed the per share numbers. $5.12 revenue left about $2.00 free cash and $1.43 dividend. A loss of just under 20% revenue would take $1.00 off all of those numbers which would leave $0.43 for dividend or around 7% at current price.Loss of nearly 30% revenue would be about max they could withstand without radical changes to company. That would leave about $0.50 free cash flow and not enough left over for a decent dividend. They might could make it work since financing cost should be less and therefore they could operate with more leverage or pare down property portfolio.
"Fyi, its time to state the obvious, TIME FOR THE SHORTS TO START BOLTING, BUY BACK SHARES, SKT is going to start to climb to 20s range, with a UPSIDE to 40, with a 4% COMPOUNDING dividend, that could and should be raised back to Pre Covid levels of 7-8% divOUTDOOR MALLS OPEN and THATS WHERE ITS AT NOW and FORWARD, public likes on line shopping, BUT the public LOVES OUTDOOR MALLS, brick and mortar , SKT has like 94% rentals now and everything basically current in rent now, so moving forward, ill say it nowSKT will BLOWOUT EARNINGS next FEW quarters, so BUY BUY BUY, SQUEEZE SQUEEZE SQUEEZE SHORTS BABY!!opinion only g luck"
Her reasoning is:Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (NYSE:SKT) slides 6.5% in premarket trading after Goldman Sachs analyst Caitlin Burrows downgrades the stock to Sell and as the mall REIT's P/E is now higher than pre-COVID times.”Ballsy to downgrade to sell right as people are receiving $1400+ free money to spend.
"I like this stock.I like the new management.We should try to fix the debt to equity ratio. Try to keep dividend on the lower end. Then use stock as currency to buy more business.We really can grow this business,"
Don't forget that 7.5 million people get kicked off unemployment in a couple of weeks.
"I have 30% of my portfolio in SKT at $15, and have never had a lost nights sleep, unique business with demand and shareholder friendly management, I have a 10 year window, I’ll be more than whole, to short this takes a huge sack"
"Nice job longs, occupancy up, FFO beats expectations, same store sales up, traffic up, and nearly 9% yield? Undervalued big time"
Good conference call. The management team is high quality and doesn't try to bs like some companies do. In some ways they have benefitted from so many other entertainment areas being locked down. Tanger is still a place you can get out of the house. Like Steve Tanger said if they have retailer going bankrupt they were an underperformer and it's better to get a fresh brand into the space.
I own a lot of skt and want to buy more. I have read on the board about getting interest on shares which are loaned to short sellers. I asked my TDAmeritrade about this option and was told they do not share the interest earned on the shorted shares. Can anybody tell me which firms do share interest earned? I am a real estate investor long term and would like to increase my yield.
"I apologize if I have said this before. I picked SKT from the most shorted list. I understand company is out of favor, but I believe that there is asymmetric risk because of heavy short interest. I did well on PETS which got as high as 19 days to cover. We are at 18 on SKT. I probably will accumulate more shares if price drops below $16. We need a catalyst to #$%$ shorts which could be overall improvement in consumer spending, but I suspect we may have to wait til next quarter when Tanger is going to give full year guidance. If it is good I expect a big pop as shorts try to get thru the skinny door. For PETS it was 30% pop in one day. If dividend of $1.42 can continue to be paid I think SKT is worth around $30. If price drops $14.20 that is 10% dividend and I probably will triple my commitment to the stock."
Blackrock owns 16 million shares of this. I'm holding and added another 500 just now.
"Even if this stock never moves off of it's current price (unlikely), then the equivalent of a 9% coupon bond is a wonderful investment!"
What about Nashville? Are they still planning for its completion?
CEO bought 10k shares today. A director bought 7k shares yesterday
"Took some of the $$$ I made in ASNA today and drove to Tanger outlets in Myrtle Beach. There’s great deals at the nautica store. Prices half off. Shoppers in and out mid day, even though it’s 42 and pouring rain. Polo Store not as crowded, some good deals but higher price points. Did a walk by of LOFT outlets, shoppers inside, business as usual. There’s your update. P.S. i walked the whole mall and did not see a vacant store."
"Went through the quarterly earnings report again. It's clear to me that Tanger has caught up by skipping one dividend payment and has the financial ability to pay a dividend at end of November. They could pay at the old rate but that looks like that might not be sustainable if the new average FFO is going to be in the $0.44 range per quarter. They may be concerned that Covid is going to cause more problems this quarter and the prudent thing to do is skip another month. If they do then they could end the year with about $50 - 65 million unless they pay off some debt early. Again a spike in Covid could screw things up, but don't believe they will shut down retail sales throughout country this quarter."
Great move.Company used ATM to sell stock at about $19.00 a share in past months.Great management. Great timing.Proceed is used to reduce debt. I think future dividend rate will go up now.$19 will be within reach again when the dividend rate is increased.
"just got back from Tangers black Friday sale , not any parking, lines out the doors, retail alive for the holidays."
"My approach is different.I spend my time looking forward.This company is one of the few which actually can make decent GAAP book income.I estimate GAAP income in 2021 to be about 80 cents.So, I expect dividends of at least 80 cents. It will probably be higher because cash generated by non cash depreciation of about $1 a share.I expect the base line stock price to be about $15, within the next 6 months, when dividend is raised to 20 cents a quarter.Just my opionion."
"No dividend cut ever, fundamentals are strong with 95% occupancy."
important: the pre covid SKT maximum was 16.50.now I would like to understand with you if this increase can reach pre covid values or there is the possibility of reaching 20 as in last January.
"I see that the paid posters from Melvin are still posting up false information on here. Don't fall for it. They're trying to manipulate the price down. Do your own research, SKT is profitable real estate company that collects rent from its tenants. Also, expanding to new locations (Nashville)! Pays a nice dividend too!"
"I'm not always a fan of share buy-backs and I would like to see SKT's long-term debt be lower, but if SKT is paying out 3.6% interest on it's debt and paying out 9.71% dividends...the move now to have more cash in the future would be to take some of the free cash currently available and reduce the share count. A dollar spent on share buy-back pays for itself in 10 years."
HOLD THE LINE. Don't listen the the disinformation posted on here. Tanger actually earns a profit and pays a nice dividend. The shorts are scared because they're going to have to cover their positions eventually!!! I'm not selling mine until $50 or more! HOLD HOLD HOLD
"BUY BUY BUY, Heading towards 20-22 range soon, with momentum 25plus, and if the Shortys start to BUY BACK shares, you could see a SQUEEZE up to 35-40 range folks...SKT was near 40 in 2016-17...SKT just raised dividend, there at 96-98 full rentals, with like 95% current now post Covid Delta BS,Skt Expanding in future, diversifying tenets and might bring Food and restruants to the outdoor experienceas well, Shop, Eat, makes a Happy Shopper!! BUY BUY BUY SKT Plus Compounding dividend, opinion only g luck folks"
Retail sales up nicely. SPG up nicely also.
"Did Schwab quit lending out SKT shares? Hi, I have SKT shares that have been loaned out in both Fidelity and Schwab. For the past 3 months - Fidelity has loaned out the shares 100% of the time. Where Schwab only loaned out the shares in early February. Does anyone have a Schwab account were the SKT shares are loaned out now?"
It is beginning to look like Restart of dividend.New CEO. Lots of free cash. I would do it.
"Folks, LOCK IN on any DIPS like today, .30 DOWN TODAY, JUMP on it with this GREAT COMPOUNDING , RAISED Dividend !!! Back the Truck up, LOAD UP, with a 20-22 Target next few weeks, opinion only g luck to all...."
"Short interest has declined a little more than 1% per week for the last two weeks after holding flat for a while. If that trend continues, it would appear to indicate that gradual and orderly covering is desired in the 6.50-7 range.Gambling that SKT will re-institute a solid dividend in the not-too-distant future, I've been trying to acquire shares via options (which is harder to do without weekly options) with a 6 strike. If short-covering is putting a floor on this at around 6.50, it doesn't seem as though I'm going to get many shares.Would welcome some cautious acquisition strategies."
"I think the big short hedge funds are playing a game here. Every time Brad Thomas posts another positive article on Seeking Alpha, the hedgie shorts drive it down. Easy stock to manipulate. With about zero chance of any divvy cut, take your 9% yield and rest easy. Solid quarter, solid company, growing, good management. REITS have outperformed the S&P for the last 40 years and will continue to do so."
"Shorty Stevey, The reason Skt is at 16-20 range NOw , is SHORTY is getting SLOW SQUEEZED, Shorty steve wants you to think SKT is a 12 or less dollar stockDONT BE FOOLED BY SHORTY, BUY BUY BUY, plus 4% compounding dividend , that should start getting RAISED BACK UP to eventually the Pre Covid dividend of 7-8%........Simon Properties just Raised there dividend back UP from Pre covid levels, in SAME SECTOROUTDOOR MALLS are THRIVING, especially TANGER OUTLETS, i have 3 in my area and they are PACKED no PARKING spots so busy...Tanger has 98% rentals, and Most back rent Current now, 4% Compounding dividend, just had HUGE EARNINGS and OUTLOOK forward, DELTA is NOT STOPPING TANGER OR SIMON OUTDOOR shopping and HUGE property HOLDINGS...BUY as MUCH TANGER, with a 19-22 Target , opinion only g luck"
"Backing the truck up on any dips adding to positions, plus SKT Just Raised THE COMPOUNDING DIVIDEND… 20-22 target into next Blowout earnings, opinion only g luck"
"Volume on skt has been dropping to next to nothing. Looks like even the short interest is going down. But at the current enterprise value the price per sq foot of retail space is at under $140. Retail interest is down in this stock, but Don’t think there aren’t some eyes on this for a buy out ."
With 10 year Treasury so low I SKT at $15.78 and below. Can't see anyway they can't pay out $0.71 from now on if they did that in 2020. Big cushion with FFO adjusted projected at $156.
Short Squeeze could be forming here.I bought low but plan on staying long.. Hoping to ride the squeeze up and then sit comfortably in a bullish trend
"FolksLoad up on Skt at this gift price and dividend Delta will not cause closing or shutdowns especially outdoor mallsMasking or no masking Outdoor shopping and Skt are thriving and packed, buy buy buy"
Started SKT small two weeks ago and adding small every 50 cent drop. So heavily shorted it must go lower until it bottoms. Will add more heavily at some point with the goal of 3-4 thousand shares in income portfolio. Don’t want to interfere with you professional trading experts. Merry Christmas to all.
"Report reads well, no doom and gloom as some expected. No big surprises considering the current economic environment."
I have some orders in at $6.85 and below. I am going to read the transcript of the call and the numbers in detail and plug new numbers into my estimates. My initial impression is whatever the stock was worth before the report it should be substantially more than before. I tried to be conservative in my estimates and had it pegged as at least worth $10 before the call. First pass through the numbers I was getting that it was worth at least $13 just based on 15% revenue decline year over for this quarter.Anyway saying all of that to say I am going to review everything again and if I still think it still looks strong I might buy some shares even at the $7 price.
"Just look at how many institutional buyers have Raised their positions Several hedge funds have recently modified their holdings of SKT. Norges Bank bought a new stake in shares of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers in the 4th quarter valued at about $11,752,000. Royce & Associates LP raised its holdings in shares of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers by 381.0% in the 4th quarter. Royce & Associates LP now owns 1,010,162 shares of the real estate investment trust’s stock valued at $10,061,000 after purchasing an additional 800,162 shares during the period. BlackRock Inc. raised its holdings in shares of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers by 5.0% in the 4th quarter. BlackRock Inc. now owns 16,438,383 shares of the real estate investment trust’s stock valued at $163,726,000 after purchasing an additional 782,284 shares"
Must be be frustrating to do all the hard work to put in a great quarter and buyers are all over at Robin hood running the price up 67% for a front running stock scam.
"Ultimately you cannot force a company to cut their dividend simply by driving the stock price lower. Also, there is only so much fuel in the form of available shares to short so this will run its course eventually."
"i am open to hear the short thesis, there is nothing in the companies operations or financials that warrant such a short, given that a 9% yield has been confirmed and an increase each year, what Armageddon event are they expecting ? I'm in deep with SKT, if I'm missing something, I'd appreciate their logic"
Just people buying forward. Dumping dollars. Only 2 ways out of debt. Default or inflate it away. 2 % monthly inflation is what powel is orchestrating if you are lucky.
It looks like. they paid back everything taken out on that loan and are now living comfortably on cash flow.
"According to Yahoo's stats - seems like the shorts are adding 2+ million shares every 15 days:Shares Short (15 days ago) May 30 - 34.82MShares Short (30 days ago) May 15 - 32.9MShares Short (45 days ago) Apr 29 - 30.21MEither this will be a gigantic short squeeze - or a gigantic value trap, Time will tell - I think it will be the former."
The positive story from yesterday and short squeeze premarket yesterday was all designed by hedge funds to sell out.
"Don’t invest in businesses in the hopes of a short squeeze. SKT isn’t GME it actually is a sound business that will return capital to shareholders. If there is a squeeze, great. Regardless they will be returning 12-15% to shareholders via increase divs and buybacks over the next 5 years."
I am in Myrtle Beach South Carolina right now I just went to the Tanger outlets I have not been there in two years they are absolutely mobbed they’ve been remodeled every stores fall they look greatJust my two cents and what I observe I also go to the Tanger outlets at Foxwoods casino in Connecticut and they’re always busy￼￼
"I like the action of a small increase in the dividend.First, it shows that the company is aware that dividend is important to shareholders.Secondly, it shows that the Company has financial disciple. The excess can be used to reduce debt, Or..... allow the company to expand without using excessive leverage.This stock is a long term hold for good dividend and value."
"To all those who seek to short SKT: the fundamentals of the business are against you. Simple math shows the serious flaws in your “logic”. The facts: large competitors like Pennsylvania REIT and CBL filed for bankruptcy around November of last year. In contrast, SKT didn’t. They repaid their 600m revolver in full, turned cash flow positive, reinstated dividend, used the ATM to generate more cash and pay down more debt. Occupancy levels and collection of rents in 90% range. Aside from the facts, the other following positives are: The “physical retail is dead” theory has proven to be wrong and overdone. In fact, SKT is in a great position to be part of the Omni channel process. Weak retailers fell prey to natural selection. And lastly, the yield on treasuries is barely above 1%. For retirees and pension funds needing income, investing in treasuries is a terrible idea. All paths lead back to SKT with around a 4% yield. My “opinion” BACKED by real facts. Good luck fellow longs although more luck is needed for the shorties."
"Seems like Tanger management should get an A for handling the crisis well. Stopping dividend, deferring rents, grabbing cash from credit line, retaining employees, cutting costs, getting new CEO, adding virtual shopper, paying back credit line and getting back to cash flow positive were all correct actions. Now it's time to get the malls fully occupied and ready for holiday sales. Best I can tell we are going to be in a zero rate environment for as far out as one can see, so dividend payers are going to be very desireable. Plus it's obvious that growth stocks have had their run which can't go forever."
"Tue, 11:30 amThis is a response I received 30 mins ago from IR department at SKT:""As you mention in your e-mail below, Tanger has not put out any information that would be impacting the way the shares are trading today. Currently, our entire sector is currently trading down, ranging from -1.5% to -7.2% at the moment. We release our first quarter earnings in less than 3 weeks on Monday, May 6th and our earnings call is scheduled for 8:30 AM EDT on May 7th. Below is a link to the announcement of our earnings details. I encourage you to read the release and listen to the call. """
Re the Q2 numbers my take away for what it is worth is that ltd there was a sing of $125m v same period in 19 but the ltd loss of $50m was almost all down to Canadian JV write down of $48m. July billing was up on the prior quarter so some optimism for me. I think (hope!) after hours price fall is overdone. Game changer obviously would be a Q3 earnings where div is reinstated
Nashville News should call in a few Shorts.
"Honestly can’t believe it broke $16. How low can it even go? Low debt, covered dividend, and great yield. I don’t get it."
SKT is still a very good short squeeze candidate with over 16M shares short.
"Covid or not, SKT has a declining business model where the only reason it’s gone over $12 is due to catching “meme fame” back earlier this year."
Management should announce their next dividend and protect shareholder capital. This is not a cheap stock to short and hold. It would squeeze the shorts if the dividend were announced and protected.
"Is there an accounting person in the house? My understanding of depreciation is that each year a around 3% of an asset is deducted from income statement which lowers income, but does not affect cash flow. When the property is sold if the sell price is greater than the depreciated price the depreciation allowance must be paid back. So when the Texas property sale is recognized as a $2.3 million dollar gain, how is that handled on the income, cash flow and balance sheet statements?I am curious because I know FFO is a good measure to value a REIT, but it's not the only thing you should look at."
"I placed five sell orders between $16 - $17 for just under 30% of my shares on just a fundamental valuation level. That's about fair value best I can tell. Not a trader, maybe it goes to $40 on a short squeeze. If we bust through $17 I will probably sell some more."
"Simon just raised the bar, being short ahead of SKT earnings takes a big sack"
Read the 10K. Saw Tanger was still selling stock after quarter end at 18.85 average price. They are using sells to pay down debt. I am thinking they want to make sure credit rating does not fall again. Maybe they want to get credit rating back to where they were. Looks like their able to cover debt payments 4:1 and are far exceed covenant requirements on all measures.
"I am thinking for long term investor it's just time to wait. Too much greed in the system. It was a once in a decade kind of chance to pick up stocks on sale in March. SKT was a steal at $4.05, but that brief moment has passed. It might be fair value around $15, but certainly not a great price."
