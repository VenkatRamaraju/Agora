Crazy Joe won't raise my taxes. I just paid $3.49/gal for regular.
Buying 17.50 calls that expire next week! Come along for the ride :)
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers is up 4.95% to 18.23
Good day to sell at the close and buy back tomorrow AM if there's a little dip. Stock didn't go up based on anything they did. Just got sucked up higher with the market.
"folks, just so you understand the price action on SKT, you have a Huge shortys float in SKT, everyday they let the stock trade early, then start to beat it down thru the day to make investors think the stock is going down or sideways etc, BUT look at the charts, other then the Covid/delta bump, SKT trade range is basically 15-22, and everytime Skt makes a run to 20 plus, shortys beat it back down to 15-17 range, then Buyers come in, skt runs up to 19-20, then boom shortys beat it back down, in fact like clock work with so many shorts, you can if fact Buy at 15-16 range , sell at 20-22 range, go short back down to 15-16 range then double down and BUY BACK up to 20 plus, back forth and make great money off skt, long, short, long, short etc etc, so BUY any dips or when stock is in the 15-16 range its a HUGE BUY PLUS COMPOUNDING CLIMBING DIVIDENDS.... BUY BUY BUY , BLOW OUT EARNINGS coming PLUS Huge Forward outlook and dividends, opinion only g luck"

SKT is still a very good short squeeze candidate with over 16M shares short.
"BUY BUY BUY, Heading towards 20-22 range soon, with momentum 25plus, and if the Shortys start to BUY BACK shares, you could see a SQUEEZE up to 35-40 range folks...SKT was near 40 in 2016-17...SKT just raised dividend, there at 96-98 full rentals, with like 95% current now post Covid Delta BS,Skt Expanding in future, diversifying tenets and might bring Food and restruants to the outdoor experienceas well, Shop, Eat, makes a Happy Shopper!!

Good news for longs. Looks like SKT finally has enough lease commitments to proceed with their Nashville development. Construction is scheduled to begin in March 2022. I would guess opening in 2023.
"My analysis (far from infallible, I admit) is that earnings will be good, but Wednesday's jump to 18+ wasn't likely due to an earnings leak and there wasn't a sudden change in fundamentals that I'm aware of. I think a few big players (or maybe just one) decided they didn't want to pay the upcoming dividend and decided to try to get ahead of the curve by being among the first to start covering and not wait until closer to next Wednesday. Don't be surprised if a lot of other shorts start following suit fairly soon. I expect this reversal to be brief and an upward surge to resume. It only makes sense to try to be among the first shorts to cover in a highly shorted stock that is rising with increasing dividends to be paying in the future, along with interest charges. The bear argument is that rising inflation and interest rates will be bad for reits, but I don't buy that argument at this time and current price levels, with more than sufficient dividend coverage to permit future rising payouts. It's time for shorts to start cutting their losses imo."
Mr Market is thinking there will not be any goods in discount market this Christmas.
"Moonshot is out of his romper room, Big profit off his 10 shares of SKT, kids.....lolfolks , as ive been posting for months, keep BUYING SKT. lock in on Compounding dividend$opinion only g luck"
Physical outlet retail sales numbers have been great the last few reports. Christmas shopping season is right around the corner. Short squeeze is inevitable.
A lot of day traders who shorted buying back in the last minute at 3:59pm? Surprising there hasn't been more short covering in the last week. I would expect 3rd qtr results to be good.
"Hmmm…Visited the Tanger outlet in CT shore this Saturday. Never saw the grounds / atmosphere looking so dingy and cheap. I’ve been keeping my thumb on foot traffic with an eye on investing, but not now. Anyone else seeing what I’m seeing?"
Some one yelled to shorts and said X Div coming up.
SKT just exceeded yahoo prise point
Suspect this is likely to dip back down well into the 17's soon but how far or for how long isn't easy to say yet.
"Folks, SKT tenets have plenty of supply chains to pull and fill inventories from , very diversified tenets with multi suppliers with or without some shipping issues…Tanger outdoor shopping, Christmas coming, blowout earnings coming, higher dividend coming, expansion and growth coming….. Highly recommended stock these days plenty of current BUY articles out on Skt , to back up my opinion only g luck folks  $$"
Good time to sell covered calls perhaps..
"I like the action of a small increase in the dividend.First, it shows that the company is aware that dividend is important to shareholders.Secondly, it shows that the Company has financial disciple. The excess can be used to reduce debt, Or..... allow the company to expand without using excessive leverage.This stock is a long term hold for good dividend and value."
What about Nashville? Are they still planning for its completion?
Nashville News should call in a few Shorts.
"Sure glad I took my profit yesterday. Champ, did you get out or did you give back yesterday's gain?"
Whats got to be uncomfortable are 16M short shares between now and after market close Monday.
My SKT shares in fidelity were borrowed again (ie some short seller borrowed them) - that has not happened at least for 6 months now. Something is brewing I guess!
"Skt Shortys looking like Deer in headlights, somethings coming and they can’t see or make it out, it’s Big Buyers coming into Skt very soon as volumes pick up, Shortys in Skt holding on for life, so many other stocks out there to short, Shortys have Owned/Run Skt too long, time to take profits and Buy Back shares while the getting is good, don’t get Greedy, Skt earnings blowout coming Again, Compounding dividends up and going higher, expanding and diversification of tenets, might start adding restaurants to outdoor shopping sites, all positive returns to shareholders coming, Buy buy buy , opinion only g luck"
"Folks.. continue to buy the dips lock in on rising Compounding Dividend, big blowout earnings coming again, and Forward outlook, Skt continues there to expand and looks to start adding restaurants as tenets and more diversified tenets all coming to Tenn Vol country soon…Look for Skt to test 19-22 range by x mas , Plus healthy dividend, opinion only g luck"
"Folks I’ve been buying and loading up on SKT since 12-13 range , and I continue to add to my positions on the Shorty dips , Now HUGE dividend increases COMPOUNDED , load up buy buy buy to the  moon shot… lol upset like shorty, kids…."
"Very surprising that SKT is selling off. Could be concern about the costs of building Nashville (A lot of debt to add) and will they be able to continue the dividend. Also, retailers are beginning to forecast reduced sales due to supply chain log jam.JMG"
"Wow, even Target announced supply chain issues will affect holiday sales. And I thought Pete Booty Judge was going to straighten it out."
