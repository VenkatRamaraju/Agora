"Again, volume is low so don’t panic.. I do not think this has anything to do with Intel chip issue and more to do with their 8% growth guide, their PE and their current yield."
Bought back my 500 shares today at 114.66. Great discount on decent ER. What an overreaction. Glad I sold them at 120 when I needed the cash.
"""Digital Realty Trust, L.P., priced an offering of #$%$1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.625% Guaranteed Notes due 2031 at a price of 99.515% of the principal amount."" When you have the credit power to re-finance your 2.75% debt at 0.625% . . . do it!Wow! Brilliant."
Bought at 127+. Sold at 116+. Been a bad investment since 3Q announcement.
"This has now dropped back to pre-Covid levels. Let that sink in. I have no idea why people are selling, even if thought this was a ""covid play"" and their time in the sun has gone, this doesn't make sense. It's back to January highs! Needless to say, it's been oversold which provides a fantastic entry point for new buyers. For those of you just entering, welcome, 2021 will be a great year for this company and this stock. Just be patient."
bought after hours for 101.50
"Best stock to buy during work from home scenario. Companies like Digital realty provide IT Solutions to many including IBM, AT&T, banks... If you are looking to invest in the IT Sector. It is a definite buy and hold it till we find a cure to covid."
"Great quarter, still growing like crazy, added more."
"What's the board's take on Yahoo Finance's Past and Future 5 year EPS numbers. I take these numbers with a grain of salt, since FFO is what really matters for a REIT. I think they will grow faster than the Data Center REIT space, or even the S&P, but 30.98% annually for 5 years straight? I peg FFO growth per year over 5 years at 15%+. thoughts?"
"I had an order in for DLR Preferred, just placed yesterday, and today got an email said it was being cancelled due to pending news by/about DLR. It could be as simple as a dividend announcement, but could be a merger, or a purchase."
"This is a steady earner, decent dividend, but return on new investments is relatively low. I’m long and will hang around for the dividend. It is in a great sector with the wind in their sails."
strange price action. I still like it long term and will look to buy more if it drops from here.
"Any opinions on DLR’s 6 million share offering? It dilutes eps, does not generate increased revenues..does refinance debt on the cheap, but I see it as a negative for existing shareholders. Am I missing something here?"
Help! Can anyone tell me where/how I can obtain my DLR K-1 for 2020?
Still no reason for price drop. This company will continue to put up excellent numbers well into 2022. It’s at a as 6 month low today and represents a great buying opportunity
Pull up a 15 year chart. How many other similar corporate actions occurred in this time frame? Nervous Nancies always knee-jerk panic sold. Stock price $13.50 to $155. Div from 15 cents to $1.16. Thank you for the short term discount!
I’m glad I bought a bunch of shares below $115 when everyone else was panicking.
"DLR has a very consistent pattern over the past 5 years of starting an up-trend in December, halting and holding in place for the two to three weeks around the holidays, then continuing the up-trend into February earnings. So far, we are seeing a repeat of that pattern.Starting in early January, the move up toward ~$150 resumes. This pattern is so easy to track . . . and so easy to stop-loss if it breaks. Looking forward to enjoying the ride.Steve"
Any opinions on DLR
You need to see what the cap rate was. That is how you value real estate. I have owned this company in the 40's and they haven't made a single mistake yet.
"The company will not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of its common stock by the forward sellers. The company intends to use the net proceeds, if any, received upon the settlement of the forward sale agreements (and from the sale of any shares of common stock sold by the company to the underwriters in connection with this offering) to temporarily repay borrowings."
This is a development business right now because the space has gotten crowded. Organic growth will be pinched until excess supply is absorbed.
Just bought some at $133.05. :)
wood dale is the super heros of the market stream 
"I would just like to say “thank you” to those of you taking profits. I appreciate the buying opportunity. COVID has expedited the IoT & this REIT, w/ it’s $180 target price is going to the moon. Cheers . Let’s enjoy the ride."
"AUSTIN, Texas, June 30, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital Realty (NYSE: DLR), the largest global provider of cloud- and carrier-neutral data center, colocation and interconnection solutions, announced today that it will release financial results for the second quarter of 2021 after the market closes on Thursday, July 29, 2021. The company will host a conference call to discuss these results at 5:30 p.m. EDT / 2:30 p.m. PDT on Thursday, July 29, 2021."
Forward PE over 100. Looks expensive. But a great company. Down $7 pre-market on Stock offering.
Pretty good price level to buy some DLR for some quick cash - a no-brainer if you plan to hold long term
What the H is wrong with this stock? Can’t be just interest rate scares...
Far too rich for me. Trading like its AMZN.... lol but its not. It is just real estate.
DLR now trading below 20% fair value with an earnings growth of around 18% for next year. Almost all of their major cloud and big data customers are expanding their data centers this year. Plus a 3%+ dividend. The future seems bright for DLR. The stock price is yet to reflect this.
why no love for DLR????? data center REIT with nice Div????
anyone have more detail on this? https://uspto.report/TM/90175148
"To all of you wonder why this stock is down. It's because there are more dynamic companies out there where you can make quick bucks. Look at MSFT, Google, Apple and Amazon. Once 8n a while down 2-3% then up 5% or more and again the same thing. Also, people sell to move to Tesla or crypto hopeing to make a quick profit. DLR is just... too boring. No action here, no bang bang."
"Great ride up, and all with a handsome dividend as icing on the cake."
Yahoo summary at this moment shows PE Ratio (TTM) at 81.03; all other websites have it under 20?? How can it be this wrong?
Today I doubled down at 112.51 following the recent decline from the 120s that was a substantial correction and created an oversold condition. Great value at this level!
"Hate to say I was right, but clearly 11 days ago we were not at $154"
Buying the dip. Starting to look cheap with average analyst price targets being much higher.
"No reason this should be going down. Great buying opportunity. The shift to digitization is here to stay, covid was just the start of it"
