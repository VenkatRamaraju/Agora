Any opinions on DLR
Why the down turn today?
DLR-PC is up 6.41% to 25.81
DLR-PL is down 7.40% to 18.90
I am finally going to buy some down here. I have tracked it and like that it is an income and growth stock. Rate increases make all the REITs trade down but I think its a good entry point around 107. I am a buy and hold investor so I like how they have increased div year over year. I wish I grabbed it at 105. I will add as it may go below 107 again.
$130 was the floor. Looks like it's starting to climb. Should be $138 next week. Should setup nicely as it prepares for earnings report.
Bought at 127+. Sold at 116+. Been a bad investment since 3Q announcement.
I think this will bounce back after earnings report

What are we thinking of this stock? Should still see an increase while everyone is hunkered down?

"All DC REITs seem like bad investments right now. Have been long DLR and COR for over a year now, which seems like a bad decision in hindsight."
@Perry...You need to stop posting just to pump DLR.. Offer some reason or insight other than trying to halt the decline which you have no way of doing.... Just because the stock is 17% off its high doesn’t mean it can’t go lower..

being called 4/1/19. anything else out there that's good?
Although this stock moves up and down a bit during the day it has managed to end green 10 days in a row.
"This has now dropped back to pre-Covid levels. Let that sink in. I have no idea why people are selling, even if thought this was a ""covid play"" and their time in the sun has gone, this doesn't make sense. It's back to January highs! Needless to say, it's been oversold which provides a fantastic entry point for new buyers. For those of you just entering, welcome, 2021 will be a great year for this company and this stock. Just be patient."
"The company will not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of its common stock by the forward sellers. The company intends to use the net proceeds, if any, received upon the settlement of the forward sale agreements (and from the sale of any shares of common stock sold by the company to the underwriters in connection with this offering) to temporarily repay borrowings."
Shorts are really trying to force this down aren’t they? I bought some today and will buy more after the dividend x-date.

Whoa ! What happened today? -$6.61 (4.18%)
no reason for the drop. I bought more at close 132.
DLR-PC is up 5.45% to 21.17
"Just sold a third of my position for a 21% gain in around 3 months, not bad. I'm concerned that valuation here is getting steep, and I needed the funds to pay Uncle Sam. April is always the worst month for me because of income tax filing."

Earnings Growth is slow and now with the massively non-accretive INXN acquisition growth will stagnate. It’s just math.
Buying the dip. Starting to look cheap with average analyst price targets being much higher.
Help! Can anyone tell me where/how I can obtain my DLR K-1 for 2020?
have not added but may at the dip here. I hate buying up since I have a cost basis of 102.85 but think this should get back to 130's. Data Center reits should do well going forward. Nice div payer as well. Buy and hold for me here.
This company does shady accounting
DLR-PI is down 5.11% to 24.15
"Under $130, suddenly my interest is piqued. Under $125, pre-ex-dividend . . . and it would be ""Love""."
DLR-PI is down 5.94% to 23.60
Do they get hit with the CEO payroll tax just passed in San Francisco? Would not be too surprised to see it hit.
You need to see what the cap rate was. That is how you value real estate. I have owned this company in the 40's and they haven't made a single mistake yet.
DLR-PJ is down 7.93% to 22.00
Today I doubled down at 112.51 following the recent decline from the 120s that was a substantial correction and created an oversold condition. Great value at this level!
Digital Realty Trust is down 4.90% to 139.49
"They are going to issue shares to finance the transaction, total mistake and implies mgmt thinks the equity shares are high instead of using cash. Also no disclosures on potential synergy or forward p/e on ascenty, terrible moves by mgmt"

What the H is wrong with this stock? Can’t be just interest rate scares...
DLR-PC reached an all time low at $25.07
A close above the 200 day moving average and it will be a buy
"It will be interesting how this reacts tomorrow. Some people like to see both beat on eps and revs. In this case DLR missed eps but beat the revs. Some analysts prefer beating the revs to show growth, eps is nice to have. I will not be surprised if this pops tomorrow. It is easier to fix the eps as long as you have revenue growth. Take a look at Amazon's AWS."
poor guidanceEQIX didn't have the same issues
Still no reason for price drop. This company will continue to put up excellent numbers well into 2022. It’s at a as 6 month low today and represents a great buying opportunity
strange price action. I still like it long term and will look to buy more if it drops from here.
call me crazy. got more today at 97.99
Stock near a 52 week low and 2 vice presidents leave. Wonder if there will be any more actions taken.
Pretty good price level to buy some DLR for some quick cash - a no-brainer if you plan to hold long term

Does someone know something we don't?
good job boys
"DLR has a very consistent pattern over the past 5 years of starting an up-trend in December, halting and holding in place for the two to three weeks around the holidays, then continuing the up-trend into February earnings. So far, we are seeing a repeat of that pattern.Starting in early January, the move up toward ~$150 resumes. This pattern is so easy to track . . . and so easy to stop-loss if it breaks. Looking forward to enjoying the ride.Steve"
anyone have more detail on this? https://uspto.report/TM/90175148
Just bought Oct puts today. Looks like this is headed back down to test support $117.
I wonder why Cramer turned his back on DLR and now in bed with CyrusOne? DLR has been decent since I bought it back at $102. I plan on holding long term.
"The CEO needs to clarify things. First, was the whistleblower correct in describing the misbehavior? Second, why was he fired and by whom? If he does not come clean he may find me at his annual meeting asking the same questions. I am not amused by the effect on the stock."

"What's the board's take on Yahoo Finance's Past and Future 5 year EPS numbers. I take these numbers with a grain of salt, since FFO is what really matters for a REIT. I think they will grow faster than the Data Center REIT space, or even the S&P, but 30.98% annually for 5 years straight? I peg FFO growth per year over 5 years at 15%+. thoughts?"
"Hi, does anyone know if any of the Intel chips are in their data centers? Is that why the stock fell today?"

Don’t think it is unreasonable to see $450 by eoy
DLR-PL is down 13.16% to 20.39
I like the stock and have a sizable position. Challenge is the slow EBITDA growth relative to the multiple. Lower ROI / ROE than in the past.
Yahoo summary at this moment shows PE Ratio (TTM) at 81.03; all other websites have it under 20?? How can it be this wrong?
The market is not responding positively to to DLR buying Ascenty for $1.8 B.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/digital-realty-to-buy-ascenty-in-a-18-billion-deal-to-sell-85-million-shares-to-the-public-2018-09-24?
This is a development business right now because the space has gotten crowded. Organic growth will be pinched until excess supply is absorbed.
Digital Realty Trust reached an all time high at 149.88
Bit more volume with the Friday drop.. Could be a combination of 8% forward guidance and a general rotation out of dividend stocks used as a fixed income proxy.. Hopefully things settle down on Tuesday!
Is the yield so good because this will be getting called next year?
Pull up a 15 year chart. How many other similar corporate actions occurred in this time frame? Nervous Nancies always knee-jerk panic sold. Stock price $13.50 to $155. Div from 15 cents to $1.16. Thank you for the short term discount!
DLR-PC is up 7.95% to 24.00
"Again, volume is low so don’t panic.. I do not think this has anything to do with Intel chip issue and more to do with their 8% growth guide, their PE and their current yield."
I see another 3.5% down but nothing to fear about.
DLR-PC is up 8.88% to 23.41
"Any opinions on DLR’s 6 million share offering? It dilutes eps, does not generate increased revenues..does refinance debt on the cheap, but I see it as a negative for existing shareholders. Am I missing something here?"
bought after hours for 101.50
"Hate to say I was right, but clearly 11 days ago we were not at $154"
I bought @ 118
I bought some 115 puts. It will stop dropping now. You can thank me later.

Oh Man...That says it all.
I got in on the pull back from 164. I think it will be back to that level in the not to distant future and continue to grow.

very suspicious tanking the few minutes before an earnings call
Just bought some at $133.05. :)
seems like reits drop 1-2 % on rumors of interest rate hikes then drop 1-2% on the actual hike. getting tired of this for sure.
DLR has called this preferred stock. call date is May 17th.
it looks like we are headed towards $146
a great company but with only 3% yield I cant bring myself to add more to my position.
DLR reached a new 52 Week Low at 100.08
The latest sale of Europe properties is head scratching. The assets sold for only 15.6 times net operating income when the company stock trades at a much higher multiple even after adjusting for SG&A. No wonder the stock is dropping.
Is DLR being short squeezed?
"I had an order in for DLR Preferred, just placed yesterday, and today got an email said it was being cancelled due to pending news by/about DLR. It could be as simple as a dividend announcement, but could be a merger, or a purchase."
quite here This is gonna be a good one earnings report wise
DLR-PC reached an all time low at 23.51
DLR now trading below 20% fair value with an earnings growth of around 18% for next year. Almost all of their major cloud and big data customers are expanding their data centers this year. Plus a 3%+ dividend. The future seems bright for DLR. The stock price is yet to reflect this.
DLR-PG reached a new 52 Week Low at $23.39
"expensive, but generous dividend (still small relative to price)"
DLR-PC is down 6.32% to 23.51

"AUSTIN, Texas, June 30, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital Realty (NYSE: DLR), the largest global provider of cloud- and carrier-neutral data center, colocation and interconnection solutions, announced today that it will release financial results for the second quarter of 2021 after the market closes on Thursday, July 29, 2021. The company will host a conference call to discuss these results at 5:30 p.m. EDT / 2:30 p.m. PDT on Thursday, July 29, 2021."
REITS great yield but when they sell off you better have a good spread if not kerblunk.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/supreme-court-wary-widening-whistleblower-211440740.htmlWhy am I not suprised at this? Has the company disclosed all the facts of the case? At a miniumum it is a little embarassing for them.....
DLR-PK is down 6.73% to 23.85

Down again in huge up market.. Is CEO asleep at the wheel. Concerned they do this huge deal and no press release on synergies or eps accretion!
"I would just like to say “thank you” to those of you taking profits. I appreciate the buying opportunity. COVID has expedited the IoT & this REIT, w/ it’s $180 target price is going to the moon. Cheers . Let’s enjoy the ride."
"Well my cost base is 129 is forward x20. Is it expensive depends how you look at it if it goes under 100 is a huge buy and even now is a buy. Is selling of like everything in the market. My recommendation to all of you save a little bit more cash for nice buying opportunities but still avarage the market just reduce your buying for 30%. If you are long DLR is safe, plus dividend is very very safe."
"Seems a bit much today.... can't see reasons for a 5% drop, 2-3% maybe"
why no love for DLR????? data center REIT with nice Div????
Mr Market doesn't like this move.

Far too rich for me. Trading like its AMZN.... lol but its not. It is just real estate.
"I still have more shares to buy. I realize people like to trade and short stocks, but I plan to hold this one until I retire. This is a stock you should own."
mucho correction going on elsewhere. Not needed here!
Bizarre trading on this company. 10 percent swings constantly
"This is a steady earner, decent dividend, but return on new investments is relatively low. I’m long and will hang around for the dividend. It is in a great sector with the wind in their sails."

anyone else looking at this? I missed getting more. Shot too low.
Yes. That is telling us that they are refinancing at a significantly lower rate. Look at the May calls. The 150's and 145's are going crazy. This stock is going much higher

"Great quarter, still growing like crazy, added more."
"Holding the remainder of position long as 6.4% of the float has been sold short, and those who sold lower have a big loss that's getting bigger as this price moves higher. Those with short positions are getting squeezed in a big way and will be heading for the exit soon forced to admit defeat."
"Great ride up, and all with a handsome dividend as icing on the cake."
Bought back my 500 shares today at 114.66. Great discount on decent ER. What an overreaction. Glad I sold them at 120 when I needed the cash.

"Makes no sense. Yes there is an active lawsuit/court ruling. HOWEVER, the Surpreme Court ruling is more about Dodd-Frank and not about DLR, but if you had to say the ruling was for or against DLR, it would be for DLR. I think the bots got this one wrong, some autosells (flash crash) kicked in, maybe some shorts are terming. I don't know, but unless there is something super shady going on that hasn't hit the bigger news markets yet... This just doesn't make any sense."

I bought some but hopefully it goes a bit more. I doubt it will go down dramatically after this ~10% move but I am a willing buyer.
