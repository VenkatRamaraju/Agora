Ford Equity Research rates LCI Strong Buy.
"Sales are down for all generics at least 20-30%. Competition, price erosion and lower contract volumes hitting all generics. It will be difficult for LCI to survive without branded products"
"in addition to my previous note; one more point note from these sentences-""Moreover, we have a pool of over 20 generic products from owned or partner sources that are currently pending approval from the FDA.Several of which we believe could receive final approval and be launched in FY'19.These include generic CONCENTRA(clarithromycin) and LEVOTHYROXINE ER."" - it means levothyroxine come back in products list(in future)."
Adderall XR launch coming shortly.(March/April) 1.3 billion market currently on FDA shortage list
Levo is back in mix. Let's get that 200 M$ yearly revenue back! It will be easy to ramp the revenue on this one as they already have the network. We'll have to see if the terms are the same than with JSP.
"Excellent ER, lots in the works, but lack of clarity on CC led to the selloff. Should return to $20s soon though, as it always does, on analyst reiterations once they get more 1:1 clarity with mgt. Like stealing candy at these prices..."
"In the last 10 trading days (8/26 to 9/9 Monday) total volume for LCI is 62,697,100 of which 13,755,322 are attributed to short volume. Wouldn't this clearly mean that people are accumulating long positions even as the shorts do their thing? granted a part of the long trades could be shorts covering desperately looking at the 9/20 expiration date - the $15 strike calls are beginning to show good volume interest (>700 right now and today's volume >300). With 10 days to option expiry, will we be seeing the stock hit $15 by end of this week or mid next week? interesting 2 weeks ahead. DO NOT SELL CHEAP and MAKE SURE YOUR BROKER DOES NOT LOAN YOUR LONG POSITION TO HELP SHORTS COVER"
"I don't think we should be totally surprised by the competition for generics. I am surprised this news was just released today and had less volume then when there was no news on Friday. Something not right in that. But that only influences the short term price of LCI. If LCI can meet the projections they just gave a couple months ago, and then show a path to growth.. we should be fine...but not in the 1-6 month window but in the 3-5 year window when the Term B loan is less of a factor. It will be nice losing the Term A loan this year. I have confidence the management is acting correctly. They are not responding as much to investors as they are trying to protect and then grow the business."
"Back in May, it was in the news that ""Lannett is working with Chinese partner YiChang HEC ChangJiang Pharmaceutical #$%$ an inexpensive version of insulin that, when it?s ready, could cut prices in half""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-13/diabetes-crisis-draws-challengers-for-22-billion-insulin-marketNow is confirmed:Lannett enters new insulin glargine deal with HEChttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3522265-lannett-enters-new-insulin-glargine-deal-hecThe US insulin market is expected to register a CAGR of 5.64% during the forecast period of 2019?2024, and the market is estimated to reach a value of USD 11.6 billion in 2019. If Lannett could get just 1% of this market and at 1/2 of the current price why not, that is 116 M revenue. When insulin related revenue start showing up in the reports, the price will jump exponentially.I'm just wondering what is keeping back the PE's or hedge funds. The risk/reward in this company is huge, why they ar not willing to risk a few millions and start squeezing the shorts?Very bullish and patient investor here!"
The downward trend is going on since 2015. Management talked about strategies which failed every time. The cost saving steps taken have not put company on positive earning. Wait for news which can bring improvement in revenues and earnings
"JP Morgan just filed a 13G with Lannett. Bought in for 2,765,513 shares.....6.8%. ALL ABOARD!!!"
"Longs over the past two days have been taken to the wood shed!! However, this is very overdone. This price fixing stuff has been going on for years and it's just wrong. After reading more about these issues, I do believe LCI will come out of this just fine. Guess the best thing to do is stop watching the day to day stuff. The numbers were pretty good this quarter and next quarter will be Levo-free so no more distractions on that issue. I hope LCI launches several new products in the next couple months. Nothing like more sales to help aching stock price!!! Good luck longs!!"
New 13G was filed for 5227912 shares (13% of total number) owned by BlackRock
$LCI Setting up to break $4 soon. $7 target for this bio. Full of shorts! FireFireFire
"Did anybody see this rebound and bought at the bottom yesterday? I was thinking about but decided against it, wasn't sure where the bottom was.We know now, it was all driven by the leaks and shorts jumped on it. Some covering today, good volume."
Its rising after hours. Something’s up? Anybody know anything?
"My posts disappearing but I will try to complete. Calculation of fines for levo is flawed. First, they took 2011 as base instead of 2012. Their alleged price increase in 2013. Second, they consider 3-3.5% per year price increase is excessive. They have to add this small adjustment for the years that price was flat and will see that price of over $300 is normal. Third, they have not adjusted the base for volume. There was dramatic increase in volume between 2013 and 2015. Considering these points, the fines, if any, will be a fraction of described in article."
"Bought this at mid 5's and really regret it. This seems headed towards zero if it can't at least hold $4.70. It fell almost 5% today when most everything else was green, so it looks like the bears are in control for now."
"More deals like this are expected: ""We look forward to expanding this relationship and launching more products over time. We believe Elite and SunGen selected Lannett as the distributor of the product because of our team's ability to launch products swiftly and execute launch plans well."""

Seems like that was a decent Q overall. Are the shorts ruling the roost on today's price or is this due to the overall market drop... The drop is way overdone but perhaps I am missing something.
there was suppose to be a meeting today June 9 2020 with FDA regarding Generic LantusDoes anybody know that got postponed or is still happening todayany updates from fly on the wall
Insider brought 5.51 yesterday http://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=101533&ref=12435347&type=HTML&symbol=LCI&companyName=Lannett+Co+Inc&formType=4&dateFiled=2018-08-30
"LCI is not doing well, but I went ahead and bought 1000 shares at $5.60. Can't see it going much lower."
"Long term debt was reduced from 784,689k to 772,425k. Anyway 12M debt was reduced last quarter. It is a good news."
"I've gotta believe private equity is looking at this name. They could certainly lower both operating and capital costs, increase cash flow and capture all the upside of the pipeline. At this point, a $6 -$7 cash bid could get it done.And Lepore is a dealmaker, so watch out When you make up one morning and we are trading @ $6.48 , you'll be kicking yourself for not adding here."
"While this price action is incredibly irritating, and there are some very real concerns about the Oxy litigation, who believes that LCI is on a good path. And why? I have some shares and I am thinking about adding some during this dip. I have some opinions about management and strategy which are favorable, but would be delighted to hear what others have to say about LCI. I believe they have a long way to go to turn it around as they got pummeled with the loss of a key contract(s). Perhaps shame on them for putting that many eggs in a basket."
I would not want to be short going into earnings AND JUNE 9th meeting with FDA.
Incredible really
"IMO, he is one of the better analyst following generics. No one thought LCI would have lost Levo. Probably more to the story than we will ever know, and I suspect ex CEO had something to do with it. Because price decline was so fast, many analyst reacted with ""hold"" but not much to back it up, except for this guy. I imagine they also felt very misled and lost trust. IMIO, the most interesting aspects to story are 1) Management has reduced cost and increased focus to preserve cash, which has built substantially, especially with the $50 mm pre-payment made by JSP to get LEVO early. Of course, the $50 was going to come over time, but to accelerate it was brilliant. 2) The margins quoted by management are higher than what the street are currently quoting -- they are more 30 - 35%. Concerns me if management is wrong, but I'm going to believe them until proven wrong, especially since the industry tends to be in low 40's. The new management team seems to be smart and capable. If you read the rest of his report (not sure you have it) but he used very assumptions AND multiples to come up with a $6.50 - 9.50 value and hold."
"The share price fluctuation makes no sense. Just look at the 5 day chart - it is irrational. Looks like day traders run it up and down every few days to make 5 to 10% on trades - buy below 8.50 and sell over 9.Fundamentals are very good, LCI is on the way up in the long run."
"Only thing thats been consistent is if you buy at the bottom you'll recuperate your losses. But it has also been consistent that if you hold on thinking they've turned the corner, it goes right back down again. lol"
"This stock really baffles me. Good company with excellent prospects, an excellent management and ever decreasing long term debt; still the stock languishes."
Looks like the fact that LCI generics are mfg in the USA rather than China is boosting the price today.
We had some crazy shortcovering until $15 mark but stock is overreacting in the other direction.Every uptick is now a chance to start a short.
"News Release Issued: Jan 13, 2020 (6:52am EST)To view this release online and get more information about Lannett Company: IR Room visit: http://lannett.investorroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=370Lannett Announces FDA Approval Of NDA For Branded Anesthetic Product, Cocaine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution 4%"
"Lannett's partner, Elite Pharma, reported earnings last week and Adderall ER and IR sales were very strong. Big contract with Walgreens and two new contracts on the way according to Elite's CEO. Looking good."
"Up to this point, I've been very positive on Lannett. I must say that I am a bit unhappy with the 100K+ shares granted. That's a lot of shares plus for the other executives. I also don't like the press about Trump wanting to bring in international generic players. Although I think it's just hot air in this political climate...it still is a negative for LCI. Mylan deal is not a slam dunk and I don't like what I read about it as well. So...what I'm saying is that I see a potential for a pull back on LCI even through what I think will be a good earnings. Shorts need to create a big sell off to cover and I'm concerned they just might be able to manufacture one. I'm less bullish today than I was a couple months ago."
why lci paying $84m per year in interest while debts is around $850m at 10%am I missing something ?
"If you a long term, semi long term, holder of LCI. Use these dips to your advantage. The shorts are always going to do what the do. I look to buy at lower prices with multiple buy orders. If they trigger great, if the don't, that's ok too, I have a decent position. Put in a stop loss. As well. I look at it as shorts are helping me long term and their day of reckoning will come. Just my thoughts"
"Goodwill acquired with Kremers purchase was $333 million. Only $141 thousand goodwill existed before Kremers. Asking all expert accountants out there, what would be the impairment charge be to Goodwill from loss of JSP contract?"
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235285
"Another launch of a new offering at Lannett this morning. Seems to me they are working very hard to drive sales higher. We know they have 140M on their balance sheet from their release of the Levo deal. Some may start saying the executive orders that Trump signed will hurt the pricing of LCI's generic drugs but I read the 4 orders and don't see this to be the case. Brand name drugs have a threat to their pricing not generics as I read it. Overall it could hurt generic sales if the brand name prices drop significantly however, these executive orders are far from being implemented and the phama industry is meeting in DC this week to perhaps suggest a better path forward. All and all, the generic industry is very key to the US health care system and I don't think DC will try and destroy it....the industry has paid in full it dues for the questionable behavior during the time frame of the price fixing lawsuit. Let's see how the generics react today."
honest advice cover margin calls stressing short big players and they must close position today
Doubled my position today to approximately 4000 shares; averaging my cost basis down. Call me crazy but I believe in LCI and it’s management
Large volume of sales. Seems irrational to me. Does anyone know if the sellers are the institutional holders or retail holders ?
"More important than the new agreement, they’re still on track got the filing of Advair by the end of the year. They will probably be first to file, which gives them fast track with the FDA. That means, approval could be 9-12 months from submission. Also, a six month exclusive marketing on a three billon dollar branded item"
"Feb. 27th>>>Lannett Company, Inc. (LCI): This manufacturer of generic versions of brand pharmaceutical products has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings rising 1.9% over the last 60 days. Now, Mar.4h, Zacks says no increased earnings in the last 60 days, so which is it???????????"
"Anyone see the 5%+ filing by Highbridge Capital? Over 2 million shares! Large firm. Was NOT a 13F filing, but a 13G which is for mutual funds etc. Not a 13 ""D"" just yet, but would not be surprised it comes soon from them or someone else. Company very vulnerable to takeover at these levels IMO. In 2017, LCI did over $250 M in sales of LEVO alone. Now with a new LEVO partner who is much stronger with a much lower cost of manufacturing, LCI will go back after old customers with a competitive price, and, will take over accounts from existing distributor. Add $250 m plus to current run rate of $550 m (minimum) for total of $800 m revenue run rate. Total enterprise value today is about $800m give or take. One times sales. Pathetic. Deals ""were"" getting done for at least 5 and up to 10 X sales revenue. Market price is so bad, everyone waiting for another shoe to drop I guess. Just can't imagine. Mr Crew is top notch. PR not so much."
"LEVOTHYROXINE sodium only asks $2000 / kilogram on market as a chemical. The major problem is how to stabilize it and aliquoted into small stable tablets. There are already lots of reports about how to stabilize it, so it should be fine for LCI to get a license soon although its CEO used ""potential"" to describe LEVOTHYROXINE."
"Looking at the CFRA report on LCI: Estimated EPS are $1.20 for 2020, and $1.50 for 2021. New drug deals will likely push those figures higher. They compare closely with EPS in 2014 when the share price was in the $40's, and 2016 when the share price was in the $20's. Debt is higher than it was then, but management continues to do a great job moving this company forward. Hang in there longs, buy the dips if you can. Share price will rise over time."
"From Zacks, rare 180 degrees turn from sell:Lannett Company, Inc. (LCI): This manufacturer of generic versions of brand pharmaceutical products has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy),"
Every business looses accounts from time to time and they replace them with new accounts.That is just normal for every business.For instance when a construction company completes a large project that account is gone and then they get another one and continue on .Less
who is buying? some fund manager or institutions?
"Generic Adderall XR is jointly owned and the second product approval for our Elite and SunGen Pharma LLC (""SunGen"") collaboration. Elite will manufacture and package the product on a cost-plus basis. Lannett Company, Inc. will be the exclusive U.S. distributor.""We are pleased to have received approval of this second product co-developed with our partner, SunGen,"" said Nasrat Hakim, President and CEO of Elite. ""Launch of this product is our top priority.""""We are very pleased to have another ANDA approval through our partnership with Elite and achieve a significant milestone for Sungen as we work on the launch of the recently approved generic Adderall XR,"" said Dr. Jim Huang, Co-CEO of SunGen."
"Stock goes down on revealed blockbuster news. Yeah because there are 6 million short shares that are stranded on the beach like jellyfish at high tide. Squeeze will be coming, This news is announced and is blockbuster."
"Been in this business too long. Stocks like this still get to me. All I know is:- Management is new but seem to have great creds. - Bedrosa was paid way too much in severance (3 years of salary) PLUS an incentive to get some deals done. Once can only assume one such deal was JSP. Now, he should be fired and I would figure out a way to not pay the three years. Something more than meets the eye with him anyway. - Obviously, there are a lot of warrants, stock options, etc. that are now worthless. Restructure them for the employees to give them proper incentive. -- I dont see where JSP disclosed sale of the 1.5 million share award to sign the last extension. Closely related party probably should make such disclosures. -- Was the deal that good with JSP? These were all finished goods, and a sharing of ""profits""......assuming a 5% ""profit margin"" and split 50/50? Might be $5 million if net eps? Yes, sales numbers impressive, but who knows the real impact?-- Debt is with Morgan Stanley .......they will work with them although will not be easy. -- Could it be, the deal offered by JSP was just not good and the new management declined? -- Because LCI bought finished goods from JSP, is there any real impact on operations of LCI? I understand LCI could probably pass through some SGA costs, but will there be any huge plant write offs or capacity issues?"
"OK, with this additional purchase of Term A loans, I am convinced that LCI has a good plan of moving forward. Term A loan is at 168M and LCI would not be repurchasing early unless it was very certain of being able to keep generating cash. I like the apporach they are taking. If they can just keep sales above the 120M mark this quarter I think that shorts will finally depart. The lawsuit is hanging out there but it has been for many years. The deep pockets of this lawsuit in not Lannett. Teva is the main target. So, my guess is that we stall in the $6-$7 range until the next report in August. However, if shorts see the writing on the wall, they may try and exit sooner causing some increase in stock price since I just don't see the reason for institutions to sell down here. Good luck longs!!"
"How in the world did this company , maker of generic drugs with no edge, end up with such a massive debt?"
"Without a catalyst this stock will likely drift down. From the September 14 short data, there is no short covering going on but the short interest increased. Stock is broken more than the company at this point. Patience is required for longs and hope must be placed that the management will control costs, fill the gap that will be created by the lost of JSP and find better solutions to manage their debt. I might add more if this drifts below $4.25 but don't think I'll sell unless it breaks $10 by December. We have a company with a history of knowing how to navagate this marketplace that made a terrible acquisition. I think they will dig out."
"OVER REACTIONS YESTERDAY FROM MARKET GURUS, IT SHOULD GO BACK TO $8 OR $9."
"FYI - some information on LCI's deal with Elite and SunGen to market/distribute general Adderall: Elite announced FDA approval of the immediate release (IR) Adderall generic on December 10, 2018. Distribution of this could begin in the very near future which is why LCI CEO Tim Crew stated they expect to launch this near term.The second drug in this deal is an extended release (ER) version of a generic equivalent to Adderall. The ANDA was submitted to the FDA in May 2018. FDA approval of the IR version took about 10 months, so approval of the ER version could be coming very soon. All this means more $$$ income and revenue as LCI continues to move forward and execute the business plan."
"If you are looking for a good long term investment and not a quick trade, then LCI has some real appeal. All the recent news has been very good and I like they took the full impairment..for now.. and are moving forward. I am sure they are looking at how to address the debt situation. Sales are good and they are doing what they said they would do about replacing lost JSP sales. Not a perfect situation but also not a situation that warrants a $5 stock price. Al least that is my opinion and I will avoid the daily swings up and down and only make decisions to add or decrease my holdings on the current news. Right now I am holding since I still am concerned about how they go about handling the debt. I like their aggressive launches and deals but the debt must be addressed in a way that makes sense. Now the shorts obviously think this company is heading lower and clearly they are currently in control of the stock price. I am encouraged that the large holders of this stock are not selling and I think in 6-12 months, the short position will be much lower as they will look for better opportunities to grow their profits."
"Looks oversold. 3.5 times daily volume today - lot of investors jump the boat. Probably not a bad time to add some. Forward P/E is less than 6 now, much lower than market average."
Annual Shareholder meeting in West Palm on Jan 17thEarnings out Feb 8th.
"I'm absolutely amazed that people don't see the value in LCI. Raymond James just noted -1) LCI's mgmt. projects adjusted EDBITDA for fiscal 2020 ""significantly ahead of Street estimates"".2) The company ""plans to launch another 15-17 products by the end of fiscal 2019. These would mostly be internally developed products with equally high margins and a market value exceeding $5 billion"".My Analysis:1) LCI only has 38.95M shares outstanding. If the mkt value exceeds $5B, then the value of these products will exceed $128/share (5,000M / 38.95M shares).2) LCI is only selling @ $5/share.My Conclusion:Assuming the article did not contain a typo for the $5B, then this stock will be a real home run for longs. I just bought more shares and will wait out all the current selling. If you compute the present value of $128/share 2 years out @ 10% growth rate, you'll come up with $105/share in today's dollars, which is 21x today's share price. The short position of 16.78M shares alone will take 9.7 days to cover based on 16.78M shares / 1.729M share avg daily volume.LCI today is a value stock that trades with Price/Book = 0.61 and earned $60M or $1.54/share for Q1 2019 (qtr ending 09/2018) after backing out the Goodwill and Intangible Assets that were expensed in the quarter. The company will likely become a growth stock by Yr-End 2019 that will trade @ several times book value.Good luck with your investing.Is there something I'm missing here?"
"@anonimous, irrespective of litigation, dismissal or not, the upgrades and option trading calls, and basic history and legacy, since 1942 are all factors in stock price climb.

So despite and pending litigation, the price went up, and obviously investors, amd the market could care less, given the overall value of LCI.

"today's news are not good et all. It is a ""polite"" form of the same semi-disaster situation as a well-known QE ""quantity easing"". A market reaction was very expected. What puzzles me a bit why insiders bought recently shares for the price 40% higher than today's one. Debt is pretty high vs current market cap though the debt was taken when market cap was 10-15 fold vs current SP. Disclosure: sold out today 4.71 all the position taken for 5.24 average. Took a loss. Now I'm watching closely a bottom to compensate my loss. From now on the only way to play LCI is a fast trading."
Market cap is getting to the point we can all chip in and buy LCI
"About the $15.29 conversion price: LC management has been executing beautifully as reflected in the fantastic improvements in the company product line, operations, financials and stock price. I think the 15.29 conversion price besides enabling better debt terms, does something much more important - namely, bring a steady but upward direction to the stock. after jumping > 100% in 5 weeks, and then falling some - it is just too much rough and tumble which can turn of certain type of employees and even investors. If we have to keep guessing whether the next stop is + 100% or - 50%, obviously it makes the job of company management that much more difficult. The outstanding product line aggregations that Tim Crew & team have done within such a challenging past year should not be allowed to be submerged by tipsy up/down trading action, especially by the shorts that have been very active these years. the 15.29 price point provides that assurance and stability to hold and accumulate LCI , while management can focus on getting the products to market and create and execute their streagy."
Good report as previously announced. Very positive imo. Let's go back up to at least $8's again and later higher. Thanks management for keeping their words and good job!

I see good news in the near future. I don't see the price fixing suit biting us this year. I also see better than expected earnings this quarter. Lack of chatter is also a positive to me. Time for Tim and crew to come though with a decent quarter.
"With this stock price action, it's easy to question ones belief in Lannett's future. However, I've looked again and again at the numbers and forecasts and even with the margin erosion from loosing levo, LCI is better than a $10 stock. They have the experinece and good leadership team to get through the next two years of rough waters. Once the debt overhang is gone...it will be off to the races. The market will see this much before it happens...shorts can do as they may but if the next several quarters show good progress, the stock will soar. But, I'm investing today to reap my returns in a 5 year time frame...I will add more this week if the stock lands in the 6's. I will sell only if the price jumps more than 100% in a six month period or any new news comes out that makes me loose confidence in the leadship team. Until then, I really don't care if the shorts drive this down to 5 again...it can't stay there if our management team performs!!"
New Short Interest figures releasedLCI short interest increased from 14.7M shares on 1/31 to 17.7M shares on 2/15.66% of float is short.Wow!.....I thought we would see it go down some after the last earnings call.
lannett company: Any Hope Left- nice article on seeking alpha.
"Good arguments from the call yesterday to go back to higher levelGross Margins to remain in low 40% range after JSP. New products and licensing remain strong - 25+ products which most are FDA approved, just need operational readiness for launch JSP impact is not going to be as material as first though, their products were high margin but also high expense cost, which they will no longer have. Owned Products will be launched through end of 2018 and continue through 2019 New Product Pool is $2B No issues at currently liquidity meeting the 2019 needs for Debt, Interest or Equity Payments."
"The short case states that several Lannett directors were involved in price fixing. Yes, they are correct, but also wrong. They were with other companies when this happened:""Maureen Cavanaugh, former senior vice president at Teva's U.S. subsidiary, currently at Lannett Co., is named as a defendant in the lawsuit""https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/40-u-s-states-sue-teva-generic-prescription-drugs-multi-billion-dollar-fraud-on-the-american-people-1.7222390Maureen was hired by Lannett in April 2018"
"All generic pharma stocks are trading at a fraction of their valuation. VRX or ENDP is even worse than LCI. I just finished an analysis of the generic pharma shares, and LCI is the best value. On the Return on Assets, Return on Equity, Revenue per Share bases, LCI is the best among all of them. The only red flag is the huge short position and I can’t really explain the short thesis.The shorts must have an info that is not available for us, small investors and the management is aware of this and with inaction validating the thesis. Otherwise they should find a way to bring in new investors, buy back shares or anything to relieve the pressure on the share price…"
so is this going back to $16?
Someone on this blog advised we should sell 5 April Puts. Glad I didn’t take that advice !!
"It trades like Lannett's only hope was CV treatment with Kaletra. However Tim already confirmed that they do not rely on it ""We will notice in terms of helping the other direction, we have the only ANDA of a lopinavir/ritonavir solution in the market, but it's a fairly small market. We have a partner considering it for import. But on a global stage, there are obviously numerous forms of these actives available globally. And so I wouldn't expect to see any material change to our opportunities from this outbreak. We're more interested in supporting our partners and continuing to supply the products we have in the market."""
"I'm slowly accumulating a position in LCI. A risk , yes, but I have confidence in the management team and LCIs pipieline. I bought Tandem Diabetes at 3 and change, it was worth the risk, I'm much more confident in LCI"

Rich Gorodesky of Colliers International arranged the transaction. The buildings, which had prior lives as warehouses, had later been converted and used by the IRS for its administrative offices until the agency consolidated and relocated in 2010 to a renovated former post office building across from 30th Street Station in Philadelphia.They bought in 2013 for 9M$. Any idea what they sold it for?"
I like to hear Roger's opinion since he is a shorter
Looks like recent stimulus package provides opportunity for Lannett to refinance its debt at better terms.
"interesting, just found this stock before market close, looks like strong institution holdings to many shorts which could cause a short squeeze... and just looks like fun. Bought in 1K shares. have fun all"
Does anyone know why we're up? does anybody know about levo start of Levo distribution or any kind of improvement of Q results
Ready to recover Way way oversold over NadA Add if you can
"Tim Crew and team have got the company into a virtuous cycle now - frequent new products, new kinds of products (like the latest fda approval for cocaine nasal spray involves clinical tests that the company will handle I think - for Numbrino branded which means higher margins; and the Moody's upgrade confirmation to stable should mean lower costs. In effect top line growing, costs reducing."
I listened to the entire conference call. The CEO said that we should see 25% revenue growth for THIS quarter. The short and long term prospects look very bright.is that TT
"Currently shorts and optional traders are keeping price low , this will fly soon Director have bought in month of May and Chief Executive Officer bought in month of June 1: recent price target @6+ from top rated analysts 2: They are commercializing new product 3: And it in oversold area"
"Seems like LCI has a fair bit of work to do on their revenues, costs and debt. I'm thinking LCI has the potential to be much greater than $8 but it is going to take a fair amount of work and time. I realize that a couple good deals and things can change overnight. However, LCI is not likely the best candidate for higher margin deals at the moment and it is known by prospective clients. The loss of Jerome Stevens deal was a major blow and it is no secret.We will see, but I am looking at this as a pretty long hold at the moment with the potential to get out sooner if they don't show more progress. Incremental progress is fine, but solid progress is key. Revenue, margins, costs and debt all need to improve and quite a bit. They are in enough of a pickle that they have announced retention bonuses which generally is not a good thing. Ultimately, I believe that LCI will likely figure it out, but they have a lot of figurin' to do. Finally, what do you believe LCI has over, for example, Amneal Pharma who took over the Jerome Stevens deal. Amneal won that deal and for certain reasons. How does LCI win it back or win similar deals? What is their advantage in your mind?"
A lot of insider buys including top management
Lannett stopped payment of principal. With current rate of sales decline eventually they will not be able to cover interest. Too many insider sales recently at these low prices is not a good sign.
Make sure to put high limit orders on your shares to protect them from shorting
"AHHH YESSSS !!!!!!!! Great news below.. Buckle up longs we are getting ready to "" B O O M "" GLTA TRUE LONGS...https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lannett-purchases-24-million-term-105400765.html"
From latest announcement: ...we expect to launch as many as 12 products in the coming six months. Sounds impressive. That’s minimum $60m/year excluding heavyweights.
"We almost held 6 today. I’m pleased with our management at Lannett. They are clearly doing their best on all fronts. Debt, new product, increasing revenue and earnings. They have my respect."
"It's been some months since I've posted and quite a bit has changed but one thing that has yet to change is that the shorts are still in control of the stock price. Regardless of the news, the shorts are able to contain the share price. If I were not long I'd be quite impressed!! However, the facts about this stock remain positive. Only 2 headwinds I see and then clear sailing...there is the debt issue that still needs some attention and second the generic market in general has been beaten down pretty bad. Teva and Amneal have both been hammered. So, looks like a 6 month time horizon to see the short interest to get down below 40% of float. If the debt issue gets a better resolution...this information in my opinion would cause the long awaited squeeze."
"The range in which this stock trades has baffled me since I first took a position. I think LCI has excellent management and given the events surrounding the last 1.5 years, they’ve done an incredible job. I only hope my optimism isn’t just wishful thinking. But I believe management when it says several new products are in the pipeline."
"January 28, 2019 - D. E. Shaw & Co, L.p. has filed an SC 13G form with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosing new ownership of 1,999,250 shares of Lannett Co., Inc. (NYSE:LCI). This represents 5.1 percent ownership of the company."
Great moment for Lannett to buy back shares. I understand they need to build their cash reserves; nevertheless.
why is this stock shorted so much??
CEO has bought more shares now. good accumulation opportunity - I'm in.
"Why shorts don't like to cover?The ones that shorted at much higher prices have big capital gains the moment they cover - it creates tax liability. The ideal situation for them is for the company they have short position in to go under. Then they never cover and keep tax free profit. In LCI case big time shorting started north of 50 about 4 years ago.This latest overblown episode with Purdue and Oxycodone dropped the stock by 2 bucks. I think it is over and $7.50 is a great buying price. One more time guys - check youtube video by Guy Gentile on $LCI Lannett Company.Insiders are holding 29% of shares and institutions about 86% for the total of 115% not counting small investors. Insiders and institutions will not be scared into selling - so the shorts can't cover even if they wanted to.This is 20 bucks stock or better in 12 to 18 months for a nice 300% profit.All in my opinion, do your own DD."
"From today’s press release “...we had expected pricing pressure in fiscal 2021 on certain key products, including generic Fluphenazine, currently our largest revenue product and one that has higher than average gross margins. A competitor has recently received approval for this product and we believe will launch shortly. We implemented the restructuring and cost savings plan, in part, to mitigate the impact of competitive pricing pressure."""
"10 reasons to consider LCI shares ( from recent earning CC)LCI has about 25 products entering later stages of the launch process LCI is currently planning to launch approved products that have an IMS market value of more than 2 billion.LCI has a pool of over 20 generic products from owned or partner sources that are currently pending approval from the FDA. This pool of products have a combined IMS value of over 4 billion. LCI we continue to work on its internal development portfolio. LCI filed 5 new ANDAs and they are targeting more than 10 following this fiscal year.LCI continues to work on new in-licensing deals to bring new products to market in the short term.With cost containments LCI will ensure that it has sufficient cash flow from operations to provide liquidity to fund obligations through this fiscal year.CEO says that LCI will be in compliance with the covenants through the end of the fiscal year. They have 15 months by end of 2019 and they're evaluating all options.In this economy it is relatively easy to refinance debt. It doesn't make sense to sell shares at $5 level.It makes sense to run the stock to $10 and then sell shares to reduce debtIn the past 3 months, insiders purchased 1.4M sharesAt $190M cap, LCI could be buyout target"
"From recent investopedia articleIf the stock does break out, traders should look for near-term resistance at R2 levels of $10.45. Closing the long-term gap from August of last year would involve a move to $13.00."
"VERY GOOD NEWS: ""Lannett Launches Five New Products In Fiscal 2019 First QuarterPR Newswire PR NewswireOctober 1, 2018PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Lannett Company, Inc. (LCI) today announced that it commenced marketing five new products in its recently completed fiscal 2019 first quarter, bringing to 12 the total number of products launched since January 1, 2018. Lannett Logo (PRNewsFoto/Lannett Company, Inc.)Lannett Logo (PRNewsFoto/Lannett Company, Inc.)MoreThe five products, all launched in the quarter ended September 30, 2018, include Methylphenidate ER Capsules (the authorized generic equivalent of Metadate CD), Esomeprazole DR Capsules, Buprenorphine plus Naloxone Sublingual Tablets and two pain management products. The five products have an estimated IMS market value of approximately $1.6 billion, although actual generic market values are expected to be lower. From January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018, the company launched seven new products.""Adding products to our offering is a key component of our growth plan,"" said Tim Crew, chief executive officer of Lannett. ""We still have as many as 20 products, of which eight have already received FDA approval, that we anticipate we will launch over the next 12 months. In addition, we are in active discussions to acquire and/or in-license products from various partners. Thus, our goal is to maintain this recent cadence of product launches for the foreseeable future.""Earlier this year, the company acquired Metadate CD from UCB, S.A."""
"OK fellow longs the time is coming and dare I say is close when a decision on our conviction will be tested. Clearly the shorts still have an upper hand on controlling LCI stock price but with the drop in volume, they are finding themselves in a more dangerous situation. So, if they can not scare longs into selling more shares, the next best option is to allow for a spike in the stock price to force longs to decide at what profit they should exit. If the stick doesn't work...and us longs have been beaten with that stick since August...then they may try a carrot. This next report which will be the last to include sales from Levo, will be a turning point for LCI. If the numbers look good, good meaning the debt is under control, then shorts should get hammered...if the numbers don't look good, then we are looking at dilution and a pretty sharp move down. However, at this point, with the low volumes over the past week or two, they sentiment is not one of wild selling...nor are shorts covering in large numbers...so I suggest that shorts might allow this stock to spike to 10 before the May 6 earning report. Yes I did say allow since they are going to stay in control until there is more confidence that the debt is able to be handled minus Levo. So, be prepared for a move up in the stock over the next three weeks, if for no other reason to get Guy Gentile to dump his 3 million shares for a 100% gain."
"Highest volume in the history of LCI without news. Sure there was a short squeeze, but someone appears to know something positive that will be released in the near future."
8% up day could certainly mean earnings leaked. Decent numbers with good guidance will start some possible major short covering.
I don't see any specific news with the company in last few days just wonder what was that big upwards news about?? Anybody here ? Any inputs?
"If you're a shareholder this has got to scare the bejesus out of you. Just the fact that they can only say that they'll be able to meet their debt covenants through fiscal 2019 is a huge problem. Of course they can meet their debt covenants through fiscal 2019, it's after that that's the problem. Add to that the fact that they announce that they've engaged someone to look at their debt and capital structure, that's only admitting that you're in huge trouble. Because obviously they've already been looking at the debt and capital structure, so now they're simply admitting that they haven't got a clue about how they're going to fix it.Face it folks, Lannett is looking like it's toast.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lannett-engages-advisors-explore-evaluate-133100921.html"
"Seeking Alpha Hit Piece: the author calculated a potential $250 million fine based on a VERY misleading chart he/she developed internally. First, the author assumed a fixed 5% price escalator without consideration for cost. With LCI, the cost came from JSP, which INCLUDED the cost of issuing them stock to do their deal to the tune of $25 million or more, plus the cost of product. Yes, margins were higher on LEVO than others in the portfolio, but BEFORE amortizing cost of capital/equity. MOST importantly, the $700 million ""gouging"" calculation did not recognize increases in volume, only price. Volumes rose 17% in 2016, 12% in 2017 and 30% in 2018. Finally, although there is no disputing price increases were substantial in 2014 and 2015, prices actually declined in 2016 and 2017. I don't believe there is a case here, but if there is, the ""gouge"" would be a fraction of the authors calculation, IMO. PS: Where is JSP in all this? mmmm,"
Horrible results.
"Crew went on to say, ""Adding Levothyroxine tablets to our offering comes on the heels of six new product launches in our most recently completed quarter. We also recently took actions to improve our working capital and strengthen our balance sheet, which have increased our cash position to more than $140 million at our fiscal year end."""
"Over 30% of that almost 7 million shares were sold short today. Easy to see why the $7 premarket price was pushed down to the mid $5 range, and why it popped to almost $6 by the close with some short covering. Expecting more short pressure tomorrow, but this Levo deal should eventually negate them shorts."
It's been a while since I last posted on this board. I follow LCI closely and am very happy with the progress that has been made with the current management. I see this dip as an opportunity to accumulate shares and just let things work through. The big picture is that the ship is turned from the path of massive debt and declining sales to stability and some very good launches going forward. Maybe LCI is not a stock to flip quickly since shorts have so much control here...but over time...longs will be rewarded in my opinion.
"Hang in there longs, this drop is temporary. Shorts playing games again, don't let them have your shares for cheap. Company is right on track with expanding the business and paying down debt. I'll be adding more, just waiting for a bottom."
"CFRA issued an new report for LCI on 12/27/19, has them as a strong buy. Added more shares this morning at $8.53."
The lopinivar/Ritonavir is Kaletra made by Lannett. This could be bigger than huge https://www.tbsnews.net/coronavirus-chronicle/chinese-medical-experts-share-knowledge-effective-drugs-against-covid-19-us
It is incredible how fast they are paying down the debt. I am not sure the market realize it fully. Their interest payments will be reduced greatly. They might even have a credit upgrade sooner than we think. That might explain all these insider purchases.
Do you people think there could be buyout speculation surrounding LCI now that Celgene is being acquired by Bristol Myer Squibb? The LCI stock price is certainly cheap enough. It wouldn't shock me if an offer comes in the next month or so for around $10/share. What are your thoughts?
Bought all I can. Cash reserves are going up. With levo and lower interest expenses the term B will be reduced to $300 mln before maturity
"well I guess the $15.29 cap is actually a protection for current investors as follows (my understanding)* if the loan is repaid by 2026, this cap doesn't matter; pro for LCI investors as better terms for the debt (4.5%)* if the loan is not repaid and the market price is > $15.29, the lender is compensated for taking the long bet plus LCI benefits in terms of lesser debt to service* if the loan is not repaid and the market price is <$15.29 in 2026, the lender simply will not convert, but LCI would hav enjoyed better debt terms till 2026"
Haven't been in this stock for a minute. Typical pre-earnings slump seems like a good enough time to jump back inWe'll see in an hour.....
No reason this shouldn't go immediately to at least $15. This was when the Jsp Contract non extension was announced. Then C - Topical and recent developments should push it over.
"See that volume? Smart shorts (not really, the smart ones got out at $3) see the writing on the wall. The stampede to cover is now slowly starting. $30, here we come."
the advair market was $3.5B in 12 months! this deal for generic advair is quite significant. Even a 10% market share should take LCI to another level. How soon can they start seeing revenues?

"@A. Luis They need to decide what they want to be. When they acquured KU for $1.3B they bought them because they thought they were going to be a mfg company. So if they are going to pivot to be a lower margin marketing/ distribution company they dont need all that debt. However now they are stuck with it. And they still have all the costs associated with a mfg company. Allot of CapEx and people cost. So there is a huge mismatch in what they actually are vs what tbey wanna be. Margins on Internal R&D can be 70% vs 20% for partner products. They can still make money being a distributor type company BUT the debt tbey took doesnt align with that strategy is. Bank was not lending them $1,3B to buy a big mfg facility only to turn around write off all the assets and now spin a story about being a good partner for products. None of which are near term and never have been. I dont have the answer to solve that puzzle. i just try to make some money on them"
the stock is 150% under control. Every day we see the same situation: as soon as buying pressure starting to increase some entity sells a big block of shares to bring the price down. At the very last minute we also see big block/s come through near the day bottom. It looks like a slow short covering/accumulation. Holding a price below 5 makes those who bought on margin in a very nervous position. This pattern can last for many months and ...suddenly the stock makes 50-70% within 1 day and then goes 50-100% more almost with no stop. Several days and 150-180% made. but even you missed a first move you still have a lot of time to jump in because it means a turn around. As for now be prepared for torture.

All the progresses will bring UP the PPS to $7's again short term..- Cash Increased to Over $93 Million at June 30 from $81M per yahoo finance.""With the recently signed agreement to be the exclusive U.S. distributor of a generic Spiriva Handihaler, we now have disclosed at least five large, durable assets in our pipeline,"" said Tim Crew, chief executive officer of Lannett. ""Each of these products has the potential to both be a significant contributor to our financial performance and to do so for an extended period of time. Combined, these products have the potential to transform our company. Currently, we believe all five products could be approved, or tentatively approved, by 2025, with the product closest to commercialization, generic ADVAIR DISKUS, potentially launching next calendar year, followed by generic Flovent Diskus in 2023, biosimilar Insulin Glargine in 2024 and biosimilar Insulin Aspart in 2025.""Let's go UP to $5's again soon."
"Cash is up debt is down, interest reducedCash and cash equivalents $119,176Long-term debt, net $606,073"
"this is great! revenue growing, earnings growing, stock price favoring accumulation. If they manage to bring in one or more of the pipeline deals already announced into revenue stream, next quarter could be even better."
There are only a few approved generic manufacturer of Levothyroxine Sodium. One of them is Vintage Pharmaceutical which is own by Par Pharmaceutical a division of Endo. The same company they started buying distubtion rights from. Hopefully we will see a deal soon....
"Extremely poor performance. Missed revenue by $4 mln. Loosing sales almost for all indications. Interest increased by nearly $20 mln. Debt increased. No new ANDA submission. Relying only to advair and insulin, which may not materialize. I am not sure why everybody in this board is so encouraged?"
"It will be another big day tomorrow. After Hours trades: 113,120 shares, last price $5.4Very unusual."
squeezing some juice?
"Lannett is going from strength to strength. Well done Tim and Crew! I wish someone who understands how the world of shorting works elaborate how the shorts manage to keep this stock from belie $25 for this long - not asking why, but how do they do it? Doesn't it cost them ?"
"I'm a 72 yr old pharmacist that has made money on LCI for years. This stock has a pattern that you can easily research. Next quarter sales will be huge. They now have more products in MCK, ABC and CAH than at any point in there long history. And because of WMT being able to market generic insulin, the floodgates for LCI to get their glargine insulin in market were just opened. This stock will be $7.50 by AUG 20"
"Big News!!! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raymond-james-lannett-emerges-levothyroxine-202604317.htmlPlease focus on this line ""Lannett’s management projects the company’s adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2020, or the 12 months ending September 2020, significantly ahead of Street estimates.Raymond James: Lannett Emerges From Levothyroxine WoesLannett Company, Inc. (NYSE: LCI) announced the amendment of its Senior Secured Credit Facility Term A loan of $275 million, which takes the company a step closer to emerging from debt following the loss of generic levothyroxine, according to Raymond James.The AnalystAnalyst Elliot Wilbur maintains a Market Perform rating on Lannett.The ThesisAlthough the modification of the original Term A loan doesn’t change the cash outflow profile of principal obligations related to the loan, it “slightly loosen the shackles on the company” and “should afford ample ceiling well through loan maturity in 2020,” Wilbur said in a note. (See his track record here.) Lannett’s management projects the company’s adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2020, or the 12 months ending September 2020, significantly ahead of Street estimates.The company expects the 16 products that it has launched so far in 2018 to generate $75 million in revenue with margins of 35-40 percent through June 2019. the analyst said.Further, the company plans to launch another 15-17 products by the end of fiscal 2019. These would mostly be internally developed products with equally high margins and a market value exceeding $5 billion, according to Raymond James. The drug gConcerta is likely to be a near-term catalyst, with a GDUFA date of Feb. 1, 2019, Wilbur said.Sometime next year, more news should arrive from the FDA and the management on Numbrino — topical cocaine — which received a CRL in July, the analyst said."
is it not surprising that no analyst recommends LCI for sell?
"Short interest is 57%?! That's a lot of cash betting Lannett is in trouble. On the other hand, if some good news does come this way, that is going to be one tight squeeze, man, a rocket to $30."
there is no bad news here. no earnings surprises per share and just a slight positive surprise in revenue. Extremely great news for launching new products and FDA approvals for what sounds like big growth potential. I think this stock just might fly tomorrow on that news.
It is about time for this company to close the door and shut the lights off for good.
Is anyone else as baffled as I am about all the trading and the lack of price movement?
Such great earnings report and future prospects. Strong management team that has done so well in earning new business. This should go back to 7's short term. Sellers will definitely regret. Long and strong here.
Down on more good news. Might just pick up a few more shares at these sales prices.
"rare gift although they come every week if you pay attention. for me purely a trade on the upwards retracement back to 9 as its oversold. it's probably what it's worth at this time, but for a company that's been around thos long, and is making more deals to replace lost business, albeit much smaller mix of total revenue, they are putting more eggs in the basket now. shorts played it well and most are covering today and moving on. I'm here for 3 weeks max, and will make a very nice profit. may revisit later for a slightly longer term position in a few months as this company will be around for the long haul."
"Market cap now $175. If I would have money LOL I would pay 100% premium, pay off the debt and would own a company generating 400M+ is sales for 1.2B"
Cause of the first major drop was the loss of Levo. I think LCI is in far better shape now than at that time. Can someone explain this downward pressure on the stock price ? Is it really the shorts
"Once the CEO of LCI was asked, after a big rise in the stock price, why it had risen so fast. He responded, “I don’t know” my confidence in management soared after that honest response."
"It seems $LCI, one of the heaviest shorted stock, is being squeezed. Hope to see it with $TXMD, it's beyond my comprehension why would shorts not cover at 5 years low, let aside shorting now"
"Excellent quarter and new products lineup. Debt is going down. Interest and principal payments will drop significantly after closing Term A. As usual, shorts are turning on with every progress. Now they are trying to scare with aftermarket reds by dumping 1-2 shares. Will go back to $15s."
"Amazing, one of my posts yesterday I said I expected a $1.50 drop today and I'd buy more. I put a buy at $11.00 ($1.51 drop) and missed it by a penny. Still might fill it Nothing but good news on that CC."
"Lannett Company, Inc. (NYSE: LCI) today announced that it has commenced marketing Venlafaxine Extended Release (ER) Tablets, 150 mg and 225 mg, USP, and Lidocaine Topical Solution 4%. The estimated IQVIA market values of Venlafaxine ER Tablets, 150 mg and 225 mg, USP, and Lidocaine Topical Solution 4% are approximately $150 million and $17 million, respectively"
"Experience with opioids case shows that affordable deals will be possible. Even if fined, the companies will negotiate flexible ways of payment extended over time and partially with free medicine."
Good News!!! - Tim Crew (LCI's CEO) purchased 4k shares today of LCI @ $8.48/share - please see the link below to the SEC Form 4 announcing his purchase -http://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=101533&ref=12692864&type=PDF&symbol=LCI&companyName=Lannett+Co+Inc&formType=4&dateFiled=2019-02-11
"The entire generic drug sector is under pressure. I don't think there is anything to do but to just dig in and wait. It may take a few quarters for this to work through but I don't see a better value in the market today. As long as LCI hits their targets and debt keeps dropping...I'm still waiting. I think many institutions share my opinions. However, those pesky shorts are pretty stubborn. Good luck all."
Even with the successful competition of current offering LCI will need at least additional $200M to close the term B loan.
"If believe to previous CC, Q3 sales will be disastrous Tim: “Meanwhile, our near term competitive environment remains challenging in part due to reduce sales from particularly profitable products. For example, Numbrino is affected by fewer elective surgeries during the pandemic. And we experienced an API disruption on the product called Metaxalone. We expect both products to contribute significantly more in each quarters than they will have the balance of this fiscal year. More significantly, we now also expect the new competitive for both Posaconazole and Fluphenazine to occur in this third quarter.”"
"Despite the Down market LCI closed up much to the dismay of the shorts. They are losing and need to consider the changing positive events around Lannett. Frankly they risk a takeover bid exceeding $10 a share,"
"KODK deal just the beginning for the generic industry. In order to be reliable, US based generic companies must have a reasonable margin/profit. Loans, incentives, maybe subsidies (hope not) may become prevalent. Consolidation/mergers likely to come. LCI should be benefactor."
Great close to the week. As the company inks more deals and brings new drugs to market the good news will launch the stock upward. Then the shorts start covering in mass and $30 here we come.
"By 2025 towards 1 bln company goal LCI will have $200 M from insulin, $65 M from Advair and considering declining sales may be $35 M from levo. The rest of products have to generate around $700 M. Assuming 2021 will end with $535 M, from 2022 to 2025 yearly growth should be $55 M excluding levo, insulin and advair. Is that possible?"
I expect the target price will be reached next week.
"Latest offering indicates1 - that without new ANDA approvals current Q1 sales may not be as good as anticipated. 2 - finances are tight and therefore LCI is more vulnerable to any additional spending, including penalty from investigations. 3 - expected levo sales are 1/3 of peak sales by LCI. Too risky to buy even after today's drop."
"This company is like radiation, never go closer it."
A Great pharmaceutical company. New products in the pipeline
"CEO purchased 2,000 shares at market price."
"Rosy future is impossible to catch. During the past two years it was pushed from 2023 to 2025. Most the CC statements were contradictory, especially “Made in US”. As we see, it doesn’t work in preventing competition. In addition, all major partners are from Mexico and China."
"New Form 4 filed. Director purchased 25,000 shares on 2/12 for 8.93.We going higher folks."
I was on the belief that we would have a lot more posting as the recent drop in price has made this ticker really attractive considering that there are a lot of future growth prospects and earnings being reported. Would appreciate if any pundits on this blog can share their honest thoughts.
"One quick comment on 2021 guidance: net sales 520 to 545 millionQ4 sales of 137.9 * 4 = 551.6 million which is higher than the guidance top number - makes no sense. They have levo again plus new drugs in the pipeline. Quarterly sales should go up.Q4 results are in line with expectation, cash situation and debt management OK, problem is low guidance.Looks to me Tim is deliberately predicting lower net sales numbers so he can beat it easily. Comment welcome"

Moody's stable rating today is huge as many more funds and institutions are apt to buy. Finally a good management team is in place. I am twice as positive as last week now--and I was super positive last week. First shorts to cover win.
another upgrade this morning! Let see how high this will go today ... options seems to indicate a price higher than 15 by friday
"Relax...this one will be fine and will be a huge money maker, when new partner news is released and over 20 new products launched this year and next."
I guess some sanity is restored....would hoover around 14-15 till earnings.
"Short interest, barely moved as I predicted and previously stated "" in previous runups years ago it barely budged"". I still have a theory."
Look at the trading last 5 days. Huge volume including short sales.www.shortvolumedotcom/?t=lciYahoo won't let me post the real link. Change dot with .

Other financial terms were not disclosed."
"I just bought shares of LCI for the first time. It's one of the most heavily shorted stocks, and those who are selling today or have stop losses going off are giving the shorts the opportunity to cover at much lower levels. There is absolutely no reason to sell this stock, as this report was stellar, and it caught the market somewhat by surprise. Stay the course, and you'll be rewarded. I know I will be."
Tax loss selling begins today
It will be just like the last time after the earnings. Down after earnings and then about 30% up gradually over the next three months. OK to buy here or better yet if it drops another 40 to 50 cents. It will be $7+ in next 2 to 3 months.
Just checked the data and it appears that the short position in LCI is close to 25% of the float.....are we in for a short squeeze.....as this appears to be the perfect candidate....among many others.
Should be getting a bounce
"For us that are long LCI, the current trends in the trading of this stock are not pleasant. It appears there are always a group of sellers ready to pounce on this stock whenever there looks to be some positive movement and they like to start our day by plunging the share price 4-8% just as their way of saying good morning longs. Well, I am not one that looks at the stock action to determine what I believe in a company. I look at the fundementals like debt, sales, deals, PE ratios, recent management decisions, cash-flow, etc. Since November, these have been very good so now I just wait for the market to catch up. This may take weeks, months or possible I am wrong. But I just want to encourage other longs to stay resolved...our day will come!! Until then...I find a Jack and Coke at night helps.."
"LCI can sell sale force for levo business to JSP for 200M easily. If LCI does not want to do cooperation, JSP will meet big trouble and lose big market. It needs time to regain the market share of levo. LCI can use 200M to reduce its debt. It is good for both of them. Why not?"
"Roller-coaster today. What was this all about, GME and AMC traders moving over to trade LCI?"

This is coming back again. Too big of a drop.Adjusted earnings are practically the same.
Lannett will never again have such a good opportunity to buy back its shares.
Levothyroxine is a multi billion dollar market and the stock barely moves with 6.2 million shares traded. Who in their right mind would sell at 5-6 dollars per share?
Anyone getting margin calls.
Down 8% without any change in fundamentals. Shorts must be shorting more driving the price down. After today LCI may be trading in $8-9 range till the next CC.
"A good poker player needs to consider the hand of his opponent as well as his own cards. So us longs know what we are holding but what is the case for the shorts?? I think before the loss of the JSP contract there was more of a case to short when the stock was in the 20s rather than now when the stock sits at 8 and change and a portion of the JSP contract has already been replaced. I also think it would be better to short when the term A loans looked to cause LCI to break their loan convenants rather than now when they have some breathing room. So what are shorts thinking. Best I can figure is that they are buying time. Many shorts have been holding for years and ultimately think this stock will plunge again after the levo works out of earnings. Other than that, I just feel they don't appear nervous since volumes are low and they don't perceive any type of buy out or debt restructure. I'd almost say that they know something longs don't about any new player other than mint broker and black rock buying up shares at these levels making a squeeze all the more severe if one were to be triggered. Can anyone else share their ideas of why the shorts seem so stubborn in their conviction on this stock???"
First significant insider purchase in years - Farber Jeffrey 30K shares in May.
"At over 52% short interest, this is a top 5 most shorted stocks on NYSE. Prediction: Price drops at opening bell as shorts try as hard as possible to drive the price down before covering. This thing wants to explode as you can see in the pre-market trading up 18%. Watch for a quick drop at the bell, load up all you can, and you'll have a 5-20% return on that investment in a matter of minutes after the shorts cover and buyers flood in."
"Somebody pls explain why the stock is down today ? If anything the news for past month has been products coming to market as pipeline outlined, fda approvals and now pipeline itself expanding (Levo). Shorts are doing something sinister that should be investigated"
"The shorts are hanging on to the following from the earnings call:""(...) And then just the last one is on generic collusion and the cases in which Lannett is involved. Do you anticipate any movement in those cases in the near to medium term.Tim CrewYes. We on the litigation side don’t make public commentary beyond saying we cooperate and we believe we’ve acted within the confines of the law. This process has been slow as it relates to things actually in the courts, a little bit more noise in the areas of public opinion. So I defer to what you read and what you hear. We remain focused on doing the right thing, working with demands for information as they occur and continue to believe we’ve acted appropriately.""Same old, same old, but new reason to short the stock..."
Booooom!! Finally some decent news!!!!!https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2018/10/22/lannett-enters-into-distribution-deal-for-adhd.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahoo
"So many may wonder why if the news on the debt amendment was positive would the stock be dropping. My explanation is that long term the news is good but short term it is not as great as one would hope. The most important message from the entire release in my opinion is that management sees no issues with staying compliant with the amended debt agreement though thier maturity. So for me, this is great news and I will hold and not let the stock price now affect what I know is long term good news for LCI."
"Average volume for the last 10 days is 4.7 million shares. That is almost 12% of outstanding and 15% of float traded every day. Somebody is here with an agenda churning those shares. This time I am not complaining - like the price action. Option volatility increased a lot, so the covered calls sellers and naked put sellers are doing OK too."
"Posted by Lisa Matthews in Fairfield Current.com 8/13/2018:Heartfield Advisors increased their position in LCI by 32.8% in Q2Factorial Partners LLC lifted its stake in shares of Lannett by 17.0%BlackRock Inc. increased its position in Lannett by 2.8% during the first quarter. Wells Fargo, Rhumbine, NY State Teachers' Retirement system all have increased their holdings.It is an interesting situation. Shorts obviously get nervous and keep playing up the need for JSP agreement renewal; meanwhile Lannett is steadily adding other products and agreements."
"They will have 2/3 their market cap in cash by the end of the fiscal year. They have Insulin coming, now this. This stock has always had a large short interest, they won't want to be squeezed. But they can't change reality. This isn't going bankrupt. It's going back to a fully healthy company. This should be 3x its current market cap at least. They can't hold it down forever."
"Short interest up againIn the data published today, short interest is now 20.9M shares, up from 19.4M shares short just two weeks earlier.Wall Street Journal now has it as 75.4% of float is short, the highest of any stock on the NYSE. Shorts are losing the battle and won't be able to continue manipulating the share price lower by more shorting. Short squeeze is imminent. Now we need LCI management to light the fuse with some new product announcements."
"After hours after the last quarterly report, LCI stock did touch $10/share and since then there has been a relentless push down to where we are this morning..$5.66. Close to a 50% drop after reporting a better than expected quarter, paying down more debt and executing as proposed. Either there are non public things I just don't know about or this stock will return to double digits sooner rather than later. I read the institution ownership weekly and I don't see this as being the cause of the decline as there is not a mass dumping of this stock. My guess is that shorts will continue to pound until the next report and then...I just don't know. They seem to not want to let go of this one...yet."
"Very high volume today. Who the heck is selling now and why? It will be just like last 3 times after the CC., down and then up 30% going into the next CC in May. Time to sell stock or sell covered calls was two weeks ago when it was trading above 10 bucks, not now. It will most likely hit 8 to 9 bucks before the CC in May, just like last three times. 4 x 30% = 120% yearly gain just by buying after the CC and selling before the next one. Maybe sell some covered calls one month out to lower the purchase price. Easy money on LCI if yo do it right.."
"I expect higher than usual volatility for LCI for the next month. Here's why.Half the float is short. Most shorts have been created by hedge funds...who are assisted in their efforts by the Wall Street brokerage community....soSome unexpected/surprising good news has recently emerged for LCI causing the shorts some much-deserved pain. Now they have to cover as the fundamentals have taken a positive turn after a couple of years in which being short was a smart move. So, who do they call?The same guys who helped them go short---their ""friends on Wall Street.""The Wall Street guys want to help their hedge fund shorts (because they like the commissions they throw their way and the dollars earned from borrowing stock to ""lend"" to the shorts.So they create some much-needed volatility in order to scare some longs into panic selling their shares thereby enabling the shorts to cover. They figure if they can drive the price of LCI down through some well-placed sells, they will enable the shorts to minimize their losses on what looks to be a now advancing stock....and the Wall Street guys will be rewarded (again) with more commission business....and a call on furure action by the hedge fund crowd.That's how the game is played....here with LCI and elsewhere."
LCI needs couple ANDA approvals to reverse current trend.
"Do you people have an update on the short interest in LCI? Shortsqueeze.com shows the same figure (16,885,700) as Yahoo Finance. The Yahoo figure though is as of 11/29/18.http://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=lci&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2I get the feeling that there are other big entities besides Guy Gentile who are currently buying shares in LCI. What are your thoughts?"
"News Today Lannett To Begin Marketing Generic Adderall XR 12/12/19, 5:24 AM 08:24 AM EST, 12/12/2019 (MT Newswires) -- Lannett Co Inc. (LCI), a pharmaceutical company, said Thursday it expects to begin marketing a generic version of Adderall XR in the coming months. The company said Adderall XR, including generic versions, has an estimated market value of about $1.3 billion for the 12 months ending October 2019, although actual generic market values are expected to be lower.
