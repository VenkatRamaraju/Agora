here comes the move to 70
I was in around 8 averaged down to around 5. Disaster and no dividends. Money just sitting there; made money last year gave 2/3 back. Losing my faith
"Good enough earnings report for $4's stock. All the progresses will bring UP the PPS to $7's again short term..- Cash Increased to Over $93 Million at June 30 from $81M per yahoo finance.""With the recently signed agreement to be the exclusive U.S. distributor of a generic Spiriva Handihaler, we now have disclosed at least five large, durable assets in our pipeline,"" said Tim Crew, chief executive officer of Lannett. ""Each of these products has the potential to both be a significant contributor to our financial performance and to do so for an extended period of time. Combined, these products have the potential to transform our company. Currently, we believe all five products could be approved, or tentatively approved, by 2025, with the product closest to commercialization, generic ADVAIR DISKUS, potentially launching next calendar year, followed by generic Flovent Diskus in 2023, biosimilar Insulin Glargine in 2024 and biosimilar Insulin Aspart in 2025.""Let's go UP to $5's again soon."
"VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / October 12, 2021 / Komo Plant Based Foods Inc. (CSE:YUM)(OTCQB:KOMOF)(FRA:9HB) (""Komo""), a premium frozen plant-based food company, announces that TransCold Distribution Ltd., a leading frozen food distributor, has added Komo Plant Based Foods to its portfolio of products that it distributes across Canada."
All time low set today. The struggle is real.
No end in sight of this bleeding.
Lannett Company is up 5.56% to 2.66
Great moment for Lannett to buy back shares. I understand they need to build their cash reserves; nevertheless.
"LCI in the list of downgraded stocks.New Strong Sell Stocks for August 30thZacks Equity ResearchMon, August 30, 2021, 10:56 AM"
That buyout of Kremers Urban was a real deal.
Collapsed. Philadelphia's burning. They should just try giving their drugs away now. Those on Kensington and Allegheny Station would love it. Might help sales.
Gone  the Yeeellloow maaaaaan 
Incredible really
"Rosy future is impossible to catch. During the past two years it was pushed from 2023 to 2025. Most the CC statements were contradictory, especially “Made in US”. As we see, it doesn’t work in preventing competition. In addition, all major partners are from Mexico and China."
Lannett Company is up 5.41% to 2.73
"Well, yahoo keeps deleting my post regarding probenecid appearing to be effective against covid. Seems like something that would be discussed here and news that would move the SP upward. Sorry if this is old news, but I just heard about it today."
not too bad company. i added more. their report around the corner.
Lannett stopped payment of principal. With current rate of sales decline eventually they will not be able to cover interest. Too many insider sales recently at these low prices is not a good sign.
"New to this board. I bought LCI around 3.5 and added more today. Not a day trader. Going to ignore all the noise and just wait this out. Been at this a long time. It's virtually impossible to buy a stock at its lowest low and sell at its highest high. No doubt, this has been terrible for most longs- However, anything below $4 I see as a good risk/reward. Holding well into next year. - By the way- no hype intended. For those short- go ahead and short away. D"
"Currently shorts and optional traders are keeping price low , this will fly soon Director have bought in month of May and Chief Executive Officer bought in month of June 1: recent price target @6+ from top rated analysts 2: They are commercializing new product 3: And it in oversold area"
Eternal optimist!
"No longer Marginal, glad I stopped doing that."
Anyone still holding this from the 70's?
"This company is like radiation, never go closer it."
too much debit and raising interest rates. not good . ..
Is Lannett going to survive this down trend????
Market cap is getting to the point we can all chip in and buy LCI
Lannett Company reached a 52 Week low at 2.57
How low is going to be.
"in case you find it difficult to read yahoo's earning news here is the summary:Quarterly ResultsEarnings per share fell 161.29% over the past year to ($0.19), which missed the estimate of ($0.12).Revenue of $106,009,000 declined by 23.14% from the same period last year, which missed the estimate of $110,630,000.Looking AheadLannett hasn't issued any earnings guidance for the time being.The upcoming fiscal year's revenue expected to be between $400,0"
Doubled my position today to approximately 4000 shares; averaging my cost basis down. Call me crazy but I believe in LCI and it’s management
"The stock is in some danger of getting delisted from the NYSE. If that happens, it will fall like a rock. I'm not clear how long they have, but they're already below the the share price minimum and barely above the market cap minimum. They can solve the first problem with a reverse split, and the second by selling more shares and buying a good product with the proceeds, but who would buy those shares?"
"$LCI todays pull back is bec of weekend lock expire and this current price is undervalued as per top analyst. Insider are holding at @7 with fair price is @6.5 . Lots of news are pending in pile line , I'm In"
Tax loss selling begins today

Tempted to increase stake at these prices.

"An insider sold around 3.18, what a smart asx"
Lannett will never again have such a good opportunity to buy back its shares.
