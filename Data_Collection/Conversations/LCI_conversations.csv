is it not surprising that no analyst recommends LCI for sell?
All time low set today. The struggle is real.
"About the $15.29 conversion price: LC management has been executing beautifully as reflected in the fantastic improvements in the company product line, operations, financials and stock price. I think the 15.29 conversion price besides enabling better debt terms, does something much more important - namely, bring a steady but upward direction to the stock. after jumping > 100% in 5 weeks, and then falling some - it is just too much rough and tumble which can turn of certain type of employees and even investors. If we have to keep guessing whether the next stop is + 100% or - 50%, obviously it makes the job of company management that much more difficult. The outstanding product line aggregations that Tim Crew & team have done within such a challenging past year should not be allowed to be submerged by tipsy up/down trading action, especially by the shorts that have been very active these years. the 15.29 price point provides that assurance and stability to hold and accumulate LCI , while management can focus on getting the products to market and create and execute their streagy."

"More important than the new agreement, they’re still on track got the filing of Advair by the end of the year. They will probably be first to file, which gives them fast track with the FDA. That means, approval could be 9-12 months from submission. Also, a six month exclusive marketing on a three billon dollar branded item"

I don't see any specific news with the company in last few days just wonder what was that big upwards news about?? Anybody here ? Any inputs?
There are only a few approved generic manufacturer of Levothyroxine Sodium. One of them is Vintage Pharmaceutical which is own by Par Pharmaceutical a division of Endo. The same company they started buying distubtion rights from. Hopefully we will see a deal soon....
"Good arguments from the call yesterday to go back to higher levelGross Margins to remain in low 40% range after JSP. New products and licensing remain strong - 25+ products which most are FDA approved, just need operational readiness for launch JSP impact is not going to be as material as first though, their products were high margin but also high expense cost, which they will no longer have. Owned Products will be launched through end of 2018 and continue through 2019 New Product Pool is $2B No issues at currently liquidity meeting the 2019 needs for Debt, Interest or Equity Payments."
"This stock really baffles me. Good company with excellent prospects, an excellent management and ever decreasing long term debt; still the stock languishes."
i bought at 2.70 i am happu
I expect the target price will be reached next week.
"LCI is not doing well, but I went ahead and bought 1000 shares at $5.60. Can't see it going much lower."
"This company is interesting at this price (mcap 300 mil$), considering revenues are in the 500 mil$.Debt is quite high but is decreasing.I've seen though about those class actions. But at this price, I think it is worth to try buy some."
First significant insider purchase in years - Farber Jeffrey 30K shares in May.
LCI needs couple ANDA approvals to reverse current trend.
"OK fellow longs the time is coming and dare I say is close when a decision on our conviction will be tested. Clearly the shorts still have an upper hand on controlling LCI stock price but with the drop in volume, they are finding themselves in a more dangerous situation. So, if they can not scare longs into selling more shares, the next best option is to allow for a spike in the stock price to force longs to decide at what profit they should exit. If the stick doesn't work...and us longs have been beaten with that stick since August...then they may try a carrot. This next report which will be the last to include sales from Levo, will be a turning point for LCI. If the numbers look good, good meaning the debt is under control, then shorts should get hammered...if the numbers don't look good, then we are looking at dilution and a pretty sharp move down. However, at this point, with the low volumes over the past week or two, they sentiment is not one of wild selling...nor are shorts covering in large numbers...so I suggest that shorts might allow this stock to spike to 10 before the May 6 earning report. Yes I did say allow since they are going to stay in control until there is more confidence that the debt is able to be handled minus Levo. So, be prepared for a move up in the stock over the next three weeks, if for no other reason to get Guy Gentile to dump his 3 million shares for a 100% gain."
"News Today Lannett To Begin Marketing Generic Adderall XR 12/12/19, 5:24 AM 08:24 AM EST, 12/12/2019 (MT Newswires) -- Lannett Co Inc. (LCI), a pharmaceutical company, said Thursday it expects to begin marketing a generic version of Adderall XR in the coming months. The company said Adderall XR, including generic versions, has an estimated market value of about $1.3 billion for the 12 months ending October 2019, although actual generic market values are expected to be lower. Lannett in March became the exclusive US distributor of generic Adderall IR and generic Adderall XR under an agreement with Elite Pharmaceuticals and SunGen Pharma. It receives a share of profits by overseeing sales and marketing support, among other related services.

Great close to the week. As the company inks more deals and brings new drugs to market the good news will launch the stock upward. Then the shorts start covering in mass and $30 here we come.
A lot of insider buys including top management
"Lannett Company, Inc. (NYSE: LCI) today announced that it has commenced marketing Venlafaxine Extended Release (ER) Tablets, 150 mg and 225 mg, USP, and Lidocaine Topical Solution 4%. The estimated IQVIA market values of Venlafaxine ER Tablets, 150 mg and 225 mg, USP, and Lidocaine Topical Solution 4% are approximately $150 million and $17 million, respectively"
"Short interest is 57%?! That's a lot of cash betting Lannett is in trouble. On the other hand, if some good news does come this way, that is going to be one tight squeeze, man, a rocket to $30."
From latest announcement: ...we expect to launch as many as 12 products in the coming six months. Sounds impressive. That’s minimum $60m/year excluding heavyweights.
Tempted to increase stake at these prices.
"Seeking Alpha Hit Piece: the author calculated a potential $250 million fine based on a VERY misleading chart he/she developed internally. First, the author assumed a fixed 5% price escalator without consideration for cost. With LCI, the cost came from JSP, which INCLUDED the cost of issuing them stock to do their deal to the tune of $25 million or more, plus the cost of product. Yes, margins were higher on LEVO than others in the portfolio, but BEFORE amortizing cost of capital/equity. MOST importantly, the $700 million ""gouging"" calculation did not recognize increases in volume, only price. Volumes rose 17% in 2016, 12% in 2017 and 30% in 2018. Finally, although there is no disputing price increases were substantial in 2014 and 2015, prices actually declined in 2016 and 2017. I don't believe there is a case here, but if there is, the ""gouge"" would be a fraction of the authors calculation, IMO. PS: Where is JSP in all this? mmmm,"
Looks like the fact that LCI generics are mfg in the USA rather than China is boosting the price today.
Ford Equity Research rates LCI Strong Buy.
"rare gift although they come every week if you pay attention. for me purely a trade on the upwards retracement back to 9 as its oversold. it's probably what it's worth at this time, but for a company that's been around thos long, and is making more deals to replace lost business, albeit much smaller mix of total revenue, they are putting more eggs in the basket now. shorts played it well and most are covering today and moving on. I'm here for 3 weeks max, and will make a very nice profit. may revisit later for a slightly longer term position in a few months as this company will be around for the long haul."
"New to this board. I bought LCI around 3.5 and added more today. Not a day trader. Going to ignore all the noise and just wait this out. Been at this a long time. It's virtually impossible to buy a stock at its lowest low and sell at its highest high. No doubt, this has been terrible for most longs- However, anything below $4 I see as a good risk/reward. Holding well into next year. - By the way- no hype intended. For those short- go ahead and short away. D"
"If you are looking for a good long term investment and not a quick trade, then LCI has some real appeal. All the recent news has been very good and I like they took the full impairment..for now.. and are moving forward. I am sure they are looking at how to address the debt situation. Sales are good and they are doing what they said they would do about replacing lost JSP sales. Not a perfect situation but also not a situation that warrants a $5 stock price. Al least that is my opinion and I will avoid the daily swings up and down and only make decisions to add or decrease my holdings on the current news. Right now I am holding since I still am concerned about how they go about handling the debt. I like their aggressive launches and deals but the debt must be addressed in a way that makes sense. Now the shorts obviously think this company is heading lower and clearly they are currently in control of the stock price. I am encouraged that the large holders of this stock are not selling and I think in 6-12 months, the short position will be much lower as they will look for better opportunities to grow their profits."
"Tim Crew and team have got the company into a virtuous cycle now - frequent new products, new kinds of products (like the latest fda approval for cocaine nasal spray involves clinical tests that the company will handle I think - for Numbrino branded which means higher margins; and the Moody's upgrade confirmation to stable should mean lower costs. In effect top line growing, costs reducing."
"today's news are not good et all. It is a ""polite"" form of the same semi-disaster situation as a well-known QE ""quantity easing"". A market reaction was very expected. What puzzles me a bit why insiders bought recently shares for the price 40% higher than today's one. Debt is pretty high vs current market cap though the debt was taken when market cap was 10-15 fold vs current SP. Disclosure: sold out today 4.71 all the position taken for 5.24 average. Took a loss. Now I'm watching closely a bottom to compensate my loss. From now on the only way to play LCI is a fast trading."
"If you a long term, semi long term, holder of LCI. Use these dips to your advantage. The shorts are always going to do what the do. I look to buy at lower prices with multiple buy orders. If they trigger great, if the don't, that's ok too, I have a decent position. Put in a stop loss. As well. I look at it as shorts are helping me long term and their day of reckoning will come. Just my thoughts"
"How in the world did this company , maker of generic drugs with no edge, end up with such a massive debt?"
"Experience with opioids case shows that affordable deals will be possible. Even if fined, the companies will negotiate flexible ways of payment extended over time and partially with free medicine."
"Seems like LCI has a fair bit of work to do on their revenues, costs and debt. I'm thinking LCI has the potential to be much greater than $8 but it is going to take a fair amount of work and time. I realize that a couple good deals and things can change overnight. However, LCI is not likely the best candidate for higher margin deals at the moment and it is known by prospective clients. The loss of Jerome Stevens deal was a major blow and it is no secret.We will see, but I am looking at this as a pretty long hold at the moment with the potential to get out sooner if they don't show more progress. Incremental progress is fine, but solid progress is key. Revenue, margins, costs and debt all need to improve and quite a bit. They are in enough of a pickle that they have announced retention bonuses which generally is not a good thing. Ultimately, I believe that LCI will likely figure it out, but they have a lot of figurin' to do. Finally, what do you believe LCI has over, for example, Amneal Pharma who took over the Jerome Stevens deal. Amneal won that deal and for certain reasons. How does LCI win it back or win similar deals? What is their advantage in your mind?"
Seems like that was a decent Q overall. Are the shorts ruling the roost on today's price or is this due to the overall market drop... The drop is way overdone but perhaps I am missing something.
Good News!!! - Tim Crew (LCI's CEO) purchased 4k shares today of LCI @ $8.48/share - please see the link below to the SEC Form 4 announcing his purchase -http://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=101533&ref=12692864&type=PDF&symbol=LCI&companyName=Lannett+Co+Inc&formType=4&dateFiled=2019-02-11
Great moment for Lannett to buy back shares. I understand they need to build their cash reserves; nevertheless.
squeezing some juice?
"IMO, he is one of the better analyst following generics. No one thought LCI would have lost Levo. Probably more to the story than we will ever know, and I suspect ex CEO had something to do with it. Because price decline was so fast, many analyst reacted with ""hold"" but not much to back it up, except for this guy. I imagine they also felt very misled and lost trust. IMIO, the most interesting aspects to story are 1) Management has reduced cost and increased focus to preserve cash, which has built substantially, especially with the $50 mm pre-payment made by JSP to get LEVO early. Of course, the $50 was going to come over time, but to accelerate it was brilliant. 2) The margins quoted by management are higher than what the street are currently quoting -- they are more 30 - 35%. Concerns me if management is wrong, but I'm going to believe them until proven wrong, especially since the industry tends to be in low 40's. The new management team seems to be smart and capable. If you read the rest of his report (not sure you have it) but he used very assumptions AND multiples to come up with a $6.50 - 9.50 value and hold."
Doubled my position today to approximately 4000 shares; averaging my cost basis down. Call me crazy but I believe in LCI and it’s management
Mr.Crew Timothy bought 2000 share at 5.51 on august 29/2018- insider bought.
"Looking at the CFRA report on LCI: Estimated EPS are $1.20 for 2020, and $1.50 for 2021. New drug deals will likely push those figures higher. They compare closely with EPS in 2014 when the share price was in the $40's, and 2016 when the share price was in the $20's. Debt is higher than it was then, but management continues to do a great job moving this company forward. Hang in there longs, buy the dips if you can. Share price will rise over time."
Large volume of sales. Seems irrational to me. Does anyone know if the sellers are the institutional holders or retail holders ?
Horrible results.
"Short Interest (Shares Short) 16,355,700http://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=lci&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2Why there are only 16M shares shorted? Much lower than I expected."
Market cap is getting to the point we can all chip in and buy LCI
lannett company: Any Hope Left- nice article on seeking alpha.
"It's been some months since I've posted and quite a bit has changed but one thing that has yet to change is that the shorts are still in control of the stock price. Regardless of the news, the shorts are able to contain the share price. If I were not long I'd be quite impressed!! However, the facts about this stock remain positive. Only 2 headwinds I see and then clear sailing...there is the debt issue that still needs some attention and second the generic market in general has been beaten down pretty bad. Teva and Amneal have both been hammered. So, looks like a 6 month time horizon to see the short interest to get down below 40% of float. If the debt issue gets a better resolution...this information in my opinion would cause the long awaited squeeze."
It's been a while since I last posted on this board. I follow LCI closely and am very happy with the progress that has been made with the current management. I see this dip as an opportunity to accumulate shares and just let things work through. The big picture is that the ship is turned from the path of massive debt and declining sales to stability and some very good launches going forward. Maybe LCI is not a stock to flip quickly since shorts have so much control here...but over time...longs will be rewarded in my opinion.
"OK, with this additional purchase of Term A loans, I am convinced that LCI has a good plan of moving forward. Term A loan is at 168M and LCI would not be repurchasing early unless it was very certain of being able to keep generating cash. I like the apporach they are taking. If they can just keep sales above the 120M mark this quarter I think that shorts will finally depart. The lawsuit is hanging out there but it has been for many years. The deep pockets of this lawsuit in not Lannett. Teva is the main target. So, my guess is that we stall in the $6-$7 range until the next report in August. However, if shorts see the writing on the wall, they may try and exit sooner causing some increase in stock price since I just don't see the reason for institutions to sell down here. Good luck longs!!"

How low is going to be.
"Anyone see the 5%+ filing by Highbridge Capital? Over 2 million shares! Large firm. Was NOT a 13F filing, but a 13G which is for mutual funds etc. Not a 13 ""D"" just yet, but would not be surprised it comes soon from them or someone else. Company very vulnerable to takeover at these levels IMO. In 2017, LCI did over $250 M in sales of LEVO alone. Now with a new LEVO partner who is much stronger with a much lower cost of manufacturing, LCI will go back after old customers with a competitive price, and, will take over accounts from existing distributor. Add $250 m plus to current run rate of $550 m (minimum) for total of $800 m revenue run rate. Total enterprise value today is about $800m give or take. One times sales. Pathetic. Deals ""were"" getting done for at least 5 and up to 10 X sales revenue. Market price is so bad, everyone waiting for another shoe to drop I guess. Just can't imagine. Mr Crew is top notch. PR not so much."
"A good poker player needs to consider the hand of his opponent as well as his own cards. So us longs know what we are holding but what is the case for the shorts?? I think before the loss of the JSP contract there was more of a case to short when the stock was in the 20s rather than now when the stock sits at 8 and change and a portion of the JSP contract has already been replaced. I also think it would be better to short when the term A loans looked to cause LCI to break their loan convenants rather than now when they have some breathing room. So what are shorts thinking. Best I can figure is that they are buying time. Many shorts have been holding for years and ultimately think this stock will plunge again after the levo works out of earnings. Other than that, I just feel they don't appear nervous since volumes are low and they don't perceive any type of buy out or debt restructure. I'd almost say that they know something longs don't about any new player other than mint broker and black rock buying up shares at these levels making a squeeze all the more severe if one were to be triggered. Can anyone else share their ideas of why the shorts seem so stubborn in their conviction on this stock???"
Collapsed. Philadelphia's burning. They should just try giving their drugs away now. Those on Kensington and Allegheny Station would love it. Might help sales.
CEO has bought more shares now. good accumulation opportunity - I'm in.
"Market cap now $175. If I would have money LOL I would pay 100% premium, pay off the debt and would own a company generating 400M+ is sales for 1.2B"
"LEVOTHYROXINE sodium only asks $2000 / kilogram on market as a chemical. The major problem is how to stabilize it and aliquoted into small stable tablets. There are already lots of reports about how to stabilize it, so it should be fine for LCI to get a license soon although its CEO used ""potential"" to describe LEVOTHYROXINE."
Someone on this blog advised we should sell 5 April Puts. Glad I didn’t take that advice !!
who is buying? some fund manager or institutions?
"Rosy future is impossible to catch. During the past two years it was pushed from 2023 to 2025. Most the CC statements were contradictory, especially “Made in US”. As we see, it doesn’t work in preventing competition. In addition, all major partners are from Mexico and China."
"well I guess the $15.29 cap is actually a protection for current investors as follows (my understanding)* if the loan is repaid by 2026, this cap doesn't matter; pro for LCI investors as better terms for the debt (4.5%)* if the loan is not repaid and the market price is > $15.29, the lender is compensated for taking the long bet plus LCI benefits in terms of lesser debt to service* if the loan is not repaid and the market price is <$15.29 in 2026, the lender simply will not convert, but LCI would hav enjoyed better debt terms till 2026"
Levo is back in mix. Let's get that 200 M$ yearly revenue back! It will be easy to ramp the revenue on this one as they already have the network. We'll have to see if the terms are the same than with JSP.
"CEO purchased 2,000 shares at market price."

"Only thing thats been consistent is if you buy at the bottom you'll recuperate your losses. But it has also been consistent that if you hold on thinking they've turned the corner, it goes right back down again. lol"
I was on the belief that we would have a lot more posting as the recent drop in price has made this ticker really attractive considering that there are a lot of future growth prospects and earnings being reported. Would appreciate if any pundits on this blog can share their honest thoughts.

"I've gotta believe private equity is looking at this name. They could certainly lower both operating and capital costs, increase cash flow and capture all the upside of the pipeline. At this point, a $6 -$7 cash bid could get it done.And Lepore is a dealmaker, so watch out When you make up one morning and we are trading @ $6.48 , you'll be kicking yourself for not adding here."

"Looks oversold. 3.5 times daily volume today - lot of investors jump the boat. Probably not a bad time to add some. Forward P/E is less than 6 now, much lower than market average."
$LCI Setting up to break $4 soon. $7 target for this bio. Full of shorts! FireFireFire
We had some crazy shortcovering until $15 mark but stock is overreacting in the other direction.Every uptick is now a chance to start a short.
Tax loss selling begins today
Very few longs who own LCI at this point are up. probably less than 1%. The chart speaks for itself.
It is incredible how fast they are paying down the debt. I am not sure the market realize it fully. Their interest payments will be reduced greatly. They might even have a credit upgrade sooner than we think. That might explain all these insider purchases.
"Sales are down for all generics at least 20-30%. Competition, price erosion and lower contract volumes hitting all generics. It will be difficult for LCI to survive without branded products"
"After hours after the last quarterly report, LCI stock did touch $10/share and since then there has been a relentless push down to where we are this morning..$5.66. Close to a 50% drop after reporting a better than expected quarter, paying down more debt and executing as proposed. Either there are non public things I just don't know about or this stock will return to double digits sooner rather than later. I read the institution ownership weekly and I don't see this as being the cause of the decline as there is not a mass dumping of this stock. My guess is that shorts will continue to pound until the next report and then...I just don't know. They seem to not want to let go of this one...yet."
"Long term debt was reduced from 784,689k to 772,425k. Anyway 12M debt was reduced last quarter. It is a good news."

""Launch of this product is our top priority.""""We are very pleased to have another ANDA approval through our partnership with Elite and achieve a significant milestone for Sungen as we work on the launch of the recently approved generic Adderall XR,"" said Dr. Jim Huang, Co-CEO of SunGen."
Anyone still holding this from the 70's?
"The short case states that several Lannett directors were involved in price fixing. Yes, they are correct, but also wrong. They were with other companies when this happened:""Maureen Cavanaugh, former senior vice president at Teva's U.S. subsidiary, currently at Lannett Co., is named as a defendant in the lawsuit""https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/40-u-s-states-sue-teva-generic-prescription-drugs-multi-billion-dollar-fraud-on-the-american-people-1.7222390Maureen was hired by Lannett in April 2018"
"FYI - some information on LCI's deal with Elite and SunGen to market/distribute general Adderall: Elite announced FDA approval of the immediate release (IR) Adderall generic on December 10, 2018. Distribution of this could begin in the very near future which is why LCI CEO Tim Crew stated they expect to launch this near term.The second drug in this deal is an extended release (ER) version of a generic equivalent to Adderall. The ANDA was submitted to the FDA in May 2018. FDA approval of the IR version took about 10 months, so approval of the ER version could be coming very soon. All this means more $$$ income and revenue as LCI continues to move forward and execute the business plan."
"With this stock price action, it's easy to question ones belief in Lannett's future. However, I've looked again and again at the numbers and forecasts and even with the margin erosion from loosing levo, LCI is better than a $10 stock. They have the experinece and good leadership team to get through the next two years of rough waters. Once the debt overhang is gone...it will be off to the races. The market will see this much before it happens...shorts can do as they may but if the next several quarters show good progress, the stock will soar. But, I'm investing today to reap my returns in a 5 year time frame...I will add more this week if the stock lands in the 6's. I will sell only if the price jumps more than 100% in a six month period or any new news comes out that makes me loose confidence in the leadship team. Until then, I really don't care if the shorts drive this down to 5 again...it can't stay there if our management team performs!!"
I see good news in the near future. I don't see the price fixing suit biting us this year. I also see better than expected earnings this quarter. Lack of chatter is also a positive to me. Time for Tim and crew to come though with a decent quarter.
"this is great! revenue growing, earnings growing, stock price favoring accumulation. If they manage to bring in one or more of the pipeline deals already announced into revenue stream, next quarter could be even better."
"The share price fluctuation makes no sense. Just look at the 5 day chart - it is irrational. Looks like day traders run it up and down every few days to make 5 to 10% on trades - buy below 8.50 and sell over 9.Fundamentals are very good, LCI is on the way up in the long run."
New Short Interest figures releasedLCI short interest increased from 14.7M shares on 1/31 to 17.7M shares on 2/15.66% of float is short.Wow!.....I thought we would see it go down some after the last earnings call.
"For us that are long LCI, the current trends in the trading of this stock are not pleasant. It appears there are always a group of sellers ready to pounce on this stock whenever there looks to be some positive movement and they like to start our day by plunging the share price 4-8% just as their way of saying good morning longs. Well, I am not one that looks at the stock action to determine what I believe in a company. I look at the fundementals like debt, sales, deals, PE ratios, recent management decisions, cash-flow, etc. Since November, these have been very good so now I just wait for the market to catch up. This may take weeks, months or possible I am wrong. But I just want to encourage other longs to stay resolved...our day will come!! Until then...I find a Jack and Coke at night helps.."
Levothyroxine is a multi billion dollar market and the stock barely moves with 6.2 million shares traded. Who in their right mind would sell at 5-6 dollars per share?
"Lannett is going from strength to strength. Well done Tim and Crew! I wish someone who understands how the world of shorting works elaborate how the shorts manage to keep this stock from belie $25 for this long - not asking why, but how do they do it? Doesn't it cost them ?"
"More Good News Again!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lannett-enters-distribution-agreement-trientine-115200460.html Company Has Begun Marketing Entacapone IR TabletsPHILADELPHIA, Jan. 22, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Lannett Company, Inc. (LCI) today announced that it has entered into an agreement with a strategic alliance partner to be the exclusive U.S. distributor of Trientine Hydrochloride Capsules, 250 mg, which is the AB-rated generic equivalent to Syprine of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (now Bausch Health Companies Inc.). Under the agreement, Lannett will primarily provide sales, marketing and distribution support for the product, for which it will receive a percentage of net profits. Other financial terms were not disclosed. Lannett Logo (PRNewsFoto/Lannett Company, Inc.)More""We expect to commence shipping Trientine soon and believe we will be one of only a few suppliers,"" said Tim Crew, chief executive officer of Lannett. ""We are focused and remain on track to launch a sizeable number of products in the near term. These include internally developed as well as in-licensed products. Our ongoing goal is to add products to our growing portfolio, increasing and further diversifying our revenue base.""Crew added that Lannett has begun marketing Entacapone Immediate Release (IR) Tablets 200 mg, the therapeutic equivalent to the reference listed drug, Comtan, of Novartis International AG. The company previously announced that it had expanded its agreement with Sunshine Lake LLC, the U.S. subsidiary of the HEC Pharm Group of China, to be the exclusive distributor in the U.S. of Entacapone IR Tablets 200 mg.Trientine Hydrochloride Oral Capsules and Entacapone IR Tablets have estimated IQVIA market values of approximately $140 million and $23 million, respectively, for the 12-month period ending November 2018, although actual generic market values are expected to be lower."
No end in sight of this bleeding.
"10 reasons to consider LCI shares ( from recent earning CC)LCI has about 25 products entering later stages of the launch process LCI is currently planning to launch approved products that have an IMS market value of more than 2 billion.LCI has a pool of over 20 generic products from owned or partner sources that are currently pending approval from the FDA. This pool of products have a combined IMS value of over 4 billion. LCI we continue to work on its internal development portfolio. LCI filed 5 new ANDAs and they are targeting more than 10 following this fiscal year.LCI continues to work on new in-licensing deals to bring new products to market in the short term.With cost containments LCI will ensure that it has sufficient cash flow from operations to provide liquidity to fund obligations through this fiscal year.CEO says that LCI will be in compliance with the covenants through the end of the fiscal year. They have 15 months by end of 2019 and they're evaluating all options.In this economy it is relatively easy to refinance debt. It doesn't make sense to sell shares at $5 level.It makes sense to run the stock to $10 and then sell shares to reduce debtIn the past 3 months, insiders purchased 1.4M sharesAt $190M cap, LCI could be buyout target"
Does anyone know why we're up? does anybody know about levo start of Levo distribution or any kind of improvement of Q results

I'm looking for better than expected earnings and much better than expected guidance. Smart shorts will start coverong.
Incredible really
I listened to the entire conference call. The CEO said that we should see 25% revenue growth for THIS quarter. The short and long term prospects look very bright.is that TT
"My posts disappearing but I will try to complete. Calculation of fines for levo is flawed. First, they took 2011 as base instead of 2012. Their alleged price increase in 2013. Second, they consider 3-3.5% per year price increase is excessive. They have to add this small adjustment for the years that price was flat and will see that price of over $300 is normal. Third, they have not adjusted the base for volume. There was dramatic increase in volume between 2013 and 2015. Considering these points, the fines, if any, will be a fraction of described in article."
Lannett will never again have such a good opportunity to buy back its shares.
"Good enough earnings report for $4's stock. All the progresses will bring UP the PPS to $7's again short term..- Cash Increased to Over $93 Million at June 30 from $81M per yahoo finance.""With the recently signed agreement to be the exclusive U.S. distributor of a generic Spiriva Handihaler, we now have disclosed at least five large, durable assets in our pipeline,"" said Tim Crew, chief executive officer of Lannett. ""Each of these products has the potential to both be a significant contributor to our financial performance and to do so for an extended period of time. Combined, these products have the potential to transform our company. Currently, we believe all five products could be approved, or tentatively approved, by 2025, with the product closest to commercialization, generic ADVAIR DISKUS, potentially launching next calendar year, followed by generic Flovent Diskus in 2023, biosimilar Insulin Glargine in 2024 and biosimilar Insulin Aspart in 2025.""Let's go UP to $5's again soon."

"@anonimous, irrespective of litigation, dismissal or not, the upgrades and option trading calls, and basic history and legacy, since 1942 are all factors in stock price climb. All amjor corporations contend with some matter of suit or other, every single major corporation is being sued for something or other. So despite and pending litigation, the price went up, and obviously investors, amd the market could care less, given the overall value of LCI.

"At over 52% short interest, this is a top 5 most shorted stocks on NYSE. Prediction: Price drops at opening bell as shorts try as hard as possible to drive the price down before covering. This thing wants to explode as you can see in the pre-market trading up 18%. Watch for a quick drop at the bell, load up all you can, and you'll have a 5-20% return on that investment in a matter of minutes after the shorts cover and buyers flood in."
"It trades like Lannett's only hope was CV treatment with Kaletra. However Tim already confirmed that they do not rely on it ""We will notice in terms of helping the other direction, we have the only ANDA of a lopinavir/ritonavir solution in the market, but it's a fairly small market. We have a partner considering it for import. But on a global stage, there are obviously numerous forms of these actives available globally. And so I wouldn't expect to see any material change to our opportunities from this outbreak. We're more interested in supporting our partners and continuing to supply the products we have in the market."""
there is no bad news here. no earnings surprises per share and just a slight positive surprise in revenue. Extremely great news for launching new products and FDA approvals for what sounds like big growth potential. I think this stock just might fly tomorrow on that news.

"@A. Luis They need to decide what they want to be. When they acquured KU for $1.3B they bought them because they thought they were going to be a mfg company. So if they are going to pivot to be a lower margin marketing/ distribution company they dont need all that debt. However now they are stuck with it. And they still have all the costs associated with a mfg company. Allot of CapEx and people cost. So there is a huge mismatch in what they actually are vs what tbey wanna be. Margins on Internal R&D can be 70% vs 20% for partner products. They can still make money being a distributor type company BUT the debt tbey took doesnt align with that strategy is. Bank was not lending them $1,3B to buy a big mfg facility only to turn around write off all the assets and now spin a story about being a good partner for products. None of which are near term and never have been. I dont have the answer to solve that puzzle. i just try to make some money on them"

Do you anticipate any movement in those cases in the near to medium term.Tim CrewYes. We on the litigation side don’t make public commentary beyond saying we cooperate and we believe we’ve acted within the confines of the law. This process has been slow as it relates to things actually in the courts, a little bit more noise in the areas of public opinion. So I defer to what you read and what you hear. We remain focused on doing the right thing, working with demands for information as they occur and continue to believe we’ve acted appropriately.""Same old, same old, but new reason to short the stock..."
I guess some sanity is restored....would hoover around 14-15 till earnings.
No reason this shouldn't go immediately to at least $15. This was when the Jsp Contract non extension was announced. Then C - Topical and recent developments should push it over.
"From today’s press release “...we had expected pricing pressure in fiscal 2021 on certain key products, including generic Fluphenazine, currently our largest revenue product and one that has higher than average gross margins. A competitor has recently received approval for this product and we believe will launch shortly. We implemented the restructuring and cost savings plan, in part, to mitigate the impact of competitive pricing pressure."""
"Excellent quarter and new products lineup. Debt is going down. Interest and principal payments will drop significantly after closing Term A. As usual, shorts are turning on with every progress. Now they are trying to scare with aftermarket reds by dumping 1-2 shares. Will go back to $15s."
Cash flow is nice. How about torture shorts by introducing dividends?

"I don't think we should be totally surprised by the competition for generics. I am surprised this news was just released today and had less volume then when there was no news on Friday. Something not right in that. But that only influences the short term price of LCI. If LCI can meet the projections they just gave a couple months ago, and then show a path to growth.. we should be fine...but not in the 1-6 month window but in the 3-5 year window when the Term B loan is less of a factor. It will be nice losing the Term A loan this year. I have confidence the management is acting correctly. They are not responding as much to investors as they are trying to protect and then grow the business."
Bought all I can. Cash reserves are going up. With levo and lower interest expenses the term B will be reduced to $300 mln before maturity
"This company is like radiation, never go closer it."
"They will have 2/3 their market cap in cash by the end of the fiscal year. They have Insulin coming, now this. This stock has always had a large short interest, they won't want to be squeezed.

(NYSE: LCI) today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Adare Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to be the exclusive U.S. distributor of Dexmethylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended Release (ER) Capsules USP (CII), 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 30 mg, 35 mg and 40 mg. Lannett expects to commence marketing within a few months.""This transaction reinforces a key element of our growth plan and complements our internal product development efforts with ready-now products,"" said Tim Crew, chief executive officer of Lannett. ""We are delighted to be working with Adare and impressed with their proprietary technologies and product development capabilities. Our agreement with Adare initially includes one product; we will look to expand the relationship over time. We also continue to evaluate a number of transactions, all of which are intended to further expand our product offering, enhance our top and bottom lines and fortify our cash position.""Ajay Damani, Vice President, Pharmaceutical Technologies at Adare, added, ""We are proud to bring our proven product development capabilities to this important partnership with Lannett. This agreement allows us to capture additional value from our generic product portfolio, while also expanding our operational capabilities to include compliant manufacturing of controlled substances. Together with Lannett, we look forward to making this treatment available in a full range of dosage strengths to patients in the U.S.""Dexmethylphenidate Hydrochloride ER Capsules has an estimated IMS market value of approximately $620 million, although actual generic market values are expected to be lower.Under the agreement, Lannett will primarily provide sales, marketing and distribution support for the product, for which it will receive a percentage of the net profits. Other financial terms were not disclosed."
"Up to this point, I've been very positive on Lannett. I must say that I am a bit unhappy with the 100K+ shares granted. That's a lot of shares plus for the other executives. I also don't like the press about Trump wanting to bring in international generic players. Although I think it's just hot air in this political climate...it still is a negative for LCI. Mylan deal is not a slam dunk and I don't like what I read about it as well. So...what I'm saying is that I see a potential for a pull back on LCI even through what I think will be a good earnings. Shorts need to create a big sell off to cover and I'm concerned they just might be able to manufacture one. I'm less bullish today than I was a couple months ago."
"Once the CEO of LCI was asked, after a big rise in the stock price, why it had risen so fast. He responded, “I don’t know” my confidence in management soared after that honest response."
"I'm absolutely amazed that people don't see the value in LCI. Raymond James just noted -1) LCI's mgmt. projects adjusted EDBITDA for fiscal 2020 ""significantly ahead of Street estimates"".2) The company ""plans to launch another 15-17 products by the end of fiscal 2019. These would mostly be internally developed products with equally high margins and a market value exceeding $5 billion"".My Analysis:1) LCI only has 38.95M shares outstanding. If the mkt value exceeds $5B, then the value of these products will exceed $128/share (5,000M / 38.95M shares).2) LCI is only selling @ $5/share.My Conclusion:Assuming the article did not contain a typo for the $5B, then this stock will be a real home run for longs. I just bought more shares and will wait out all the current selling. If you compute the present value of $128/share 2 years out @ 10% growth rate, you'll come up with $105/share in today's dollars, which is 21x today's share price. The short position of 16.78M shares alone will take 9.7 days to cover based on 16.78M shares / 1.729M share avg daily volume.LCI today is a value stock that trades with Price/Book = 0.61 and earned $60M or $1.54/share for Q1 2019 (qtr ending 09/2018) after backing out the Goodwill and Intangible Assets that were expensed in the quarter. The company will likely become a growth stock by Yr-End 2019 that will trade @ several times book value.Good luck with your investing.Is there something I'm missing here?"
"All generic pharma stocks are trading at a fraction of their valuation. VRX or ENDP is even worse than LCI. I just finished an analysis of the generic pharma shares, and LCI is the best value. On the Return on Assets, Return on Equity, Revenue per Share bases, LCI is the best among all of them. The only red flag is the huge short position and I can’t really explain the short thesis.The shorts must have an info that is not available for us, small investors and the management is aware of this and with inaction validating the thesis. Otherwise they should find a way to bring in new investors, buy back shares or anything to relieve the pressure on the share price…"
Down on more good news. Might just pick up a few more shares at these sales prices.
"Just before loss of JSP contract PPS was $13.5, long-term debt $772M, cash $98M, and sales $685M.Now long-term debt $600M, cash $140M, sales about $542M. For next year expect -$70M from the loss of fluphenazine exclusivity and price erosion plus $220M from levo, Numbrino and other product launches. PPS have to go over $20."
"Somebody pls explain why the stock is down today ? If anything the news for past month has been products coming to market as pipeline outlined, fda approvals and now pipeline itself expanding (Levo). Shorts are doing something sinister that should be investigated"

"I just bought shares of LCI for the first time. It's one of the most heavily shorted stocks, and those who are selling today or have stop losses going off are giving the shorts the opportunity to cover at much lower levels.

This is coming back again. Too big of a drop.Adjusted earnings are practically the same.
"Why shorts don't like to cover?The ones that shorted at much higher prices have big capital gains the moment they cover - it creates tax liability. The ideal situation for them is for the company they have short position in to go under. Then they never cover and keep tax free profit. In LCI case big time shorting started north of 50 about 4 years ago.This latest overblown episode with Purdue and Oxycodone dropped the stock by 2 bucks. I think it is over and $7.50 is a great buying price. One more time guys - check youtube video by Guy Gentile on $LCI Lannett Company.Insiders are holding 29% of shares and institutions about 86% for the total of 115% not counting small investors. Insiders and institutions will not be scared into selling - so the shorts can't cover even if they wanted to.This is 20 bucks stock or better in 12 to 18 months for a nice 300% profit.All in my opinion, do your own DD."
"If believe to previous CC, Q3 sales will be disastrous Tim: “Meanwhile, our near term competitive environment remains challenging in part due to reduce sales from particularly profitable products. For example, Numbrino is affected by fewer elective surgeries during the pandemic. And we experienced an API disruption on the product called Metaxalone. We expect both products to contribute significantly more in each quarters than they will have the balance of this fiscal year. More significantly, we now also expect the new competitive for both Posaconazole and Fluphenazine to occur in this third quarter.”"
Down 8% without any change in fundamentals. Shorts must be shorting more driving the price down. After today LCI may be trading in $8-9 range till the next CC.
"Cash is up debt is down, interest reducedCash and cash equivalents $119,176Long-term debt, net $606,073"
"While this price action is incredibly irritating, and there are some very real concerns about the Oxy litigation, who believes that LCI is on a good path. And why? I have some shares and I am thinking about adding some during this dip. I have some opinions about management and strategy which are favorable, but would be delighted to hear what others have to say about LCI. I believe they have a long way to go to turn it around as they got pummeled with the loss of a key contract(s). Perhaps shame on them for putting that many eggs in a basket."
It is about time for this company to close the door and shut the lights off for good.
"New Form 4 filed. Director purchased 25,000 shares on 2/12 for 8.93.We going higher folks."
"It seems $LCI, one of the heaviest shorted stock, is being squeezed. Hope to see it with $TXMD, it's beyond my comprehension why would shorts not cover at 5 years low, let aside shorting now"
Looks like recent stimulus package provides opportunity for Lannett to refinance its debt at better terms.
"Crew went on to say, ""Adding Levothyroxine tablets to our offering comes on the heels of six new product launches in our most recently completed quarter. We also recently took actions to improve our working capital and strengthen our balance sheet, which have increased our cash position to more than $140 million at our fiscal year end."""

"Longs over the past two days have been taken to the wood shed!! However, this is very overdone. This price fixing stuff has been going on for years and it's just wrong. After reading more about these issues, I do believe LCI will come out of this just fine. Guess the best thing to do is stop watching the day to day stuff. The numbers were pretty good this quarter and next quarter will be Levo-free so no more distractions on that issue. I hope LCI launches several new products in the next couple months. Nothing like more sales to help aching stock price!!! Good luck longs!!"
Anyone getting margin calls.
"CFRA issued an new report for LCI on 12/27/19, has them as a strong buy. Added more shares this morning at $8.53."
"Over 30% of that almost 7 million shares were sold short today. Easy to see why the $7 premarket price was pushed down to the mid $5 range, and why it popped to almost $6 by the close with some short covering. Expecting more short pressure tomorrow, but this Levo deal should eventually negate them shorts."

"Another launch of a new offering at Lannett this morning. Seems to me they are working very hard to drive sales higher. We know they have 140M on their balance sheet from their release of the Levo deal. Some may start saying the executive orders that Trump signed will hurt the pricing of LCI's generic drugs but I read the 4 orders and don't see this to be the case. Brand name drugs have a threat to their pricing not generics as I read it. Overall it could hurt generic sales if the brand name prices drop significantly however, these executive orders are far from being implemented and the phama industry is meeting in DC this week to perhaps suggest a better path forward. All and all, the generic industry is very key to the US health care system and I don't think DC will try and destroy it....the industry has paid in full it dues for the questionable behavior during the time frame of the price fixing lawsuit. Let's see how the generics react today."

"I posted this Raymond James article about LCI 27 days ago on this site. What are your thoughts?https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raymond-james-lannett-emerges-levothyroxine-202604317.htmlHow do you interpret these points the analyst noted in the article?1) ""Lannett’s management projects the company’s adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2020, or the 12 months ending September 2020, significantly ahead of Street estimates.""2) ""Further, the company plans to launch another 15-17 products by the end of fiscal 2019. These would mostly be internally developed products with equally high margins and a market value exceeding $5 billion.""3) ""The drug gConcerta is likely to be a near-term catalyst, with a GDUFA date of Feb. 1, 2019.""4) ""Sometime next year, more news should arrive from the FDA and the management on Numbrino — topical cocaine — which received a CRL in July.""I think the news on Concerta along with LCI's next earnings release around 2/8, will propel the LCI share price much higher. What are your thoughts?"
"Feb. 27th>>>Lannett Company, Inc. (LCI): This manufacturer of generic versions of brand pharmaceutical products has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings rising 1.9% over the last 60 days. Now, Mar.4h, Zacks says no increased earnings in the last 60 days, so which is it???????????"
"Posted by Lisa Matthews in Fairfield Current.com 8/13/2018:Heartfield Advisors increased their position in LCI by 32.8% in Q2Factorial Partners LLC lifted its stake in shares of Lannett by 17.0%BlackRock Inc. increased its position in Lannett by 2.8% during the first quarter. Wells Fargo, Rhumbine, NY State Teachers' Retirement system all have increased their holdings.It is an interesting situation. Shorts obviously get nervous and keep playing up the need for JSP agreement renewal; meanwhile Lannett is steadily adding other products and agreements."
"Lannett Announces Positive Results From Human Clinical Trial Of Biosimilar Insulin Glargine Versus US LantusPR NewswireDecember 4, 2019, 3:52 AM PST--Study Achieves All Primary Endpoints; Company to Set Meeting with FDA Regarding Pivotal Trial Design--PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 4, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Lannett Company, Inc. (NYSE: LCI) today announced positive results from the first human study evaluating insulin glargine that Lannett is developing with its strategic alliance partners within the HEC Group of companies (HEC). Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin used to treat adults with Type 2 diabetes, as well as adults and pediatric patients with Type 1 diabetes, for the control of high blood sugar.Lannett Logo (PRNewsFoto/Lannett Company, Inc.)"
"Latest offering indicates1 - that without new ANDA approvals current Q1 sales may not be as good as anticipated. 2 - finances are tight and therefore LCI is more vulnerable to any additional spending, including penalty from investigations. 3 - expected levo sales are 1/3 of peak sales by LCI. Too risky to buy even after today's drop."
"Currently shorts and optional traders are keeping price low , this will fly soon Director have bought in month of May and Chief Executive Officer bought in month of June 1: recent price target @6+ from top rated analysts 2: They are commercializing new product 3: And it in oversold area"
"One quick comment on 2021 guidance: net sales 520 to 545 millionQ4 sales of 137.9 * 4 = 551.6 million which is higher than the guidance top number - makes no sense. They have levo again plus new drugs in the pipeline. Quarterly sales should go up.Q4 results are in line with expectation, cash situation and debt management OK, problem is low guidance.Looks to me Tim is deliberately predicting lower net sales numbers so he can beat it easily. Comment welcome"
"More deals like this are expected: ""We look forward to expanding this relationship and launching more products over time. We believe Elite and SunGen selected Lannett as the distributor of the product because of our team's ability to launch products swiftly and execute launch plans well."""
"Back in May, it was in the news that ""Lannett is working with Chinese partner YiChang HEC ChangJiang Pharmaceutical #$%$ an inexpensive version of insulin that, when it?s ready, could cut prices in half""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-13/diabetes-crisis-draws-challengers-for-22-billion-insulin-marketNow is confirmed:Lannett enters new insulin glargine deal with HEChttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3522265-lannett-enters-new-insulin-glargine-deal-hecThe US insulin market is expected to register a CAGR of 5.64% during the forecast period of 2019?2024, and the market is estimated to reach a value of USD 11.6 billion in 2019. If Lannett could get just 1% of this market and at 1/2 of the current price why not, that is 116 M revenue. When insulin related revenue start showing up in the reports, the price will jump exponentially.I'm just wondering what is keeping back the PE's or hedge funds. The risk/reward in this company is huge, why they ar not willing to risk a few millions and start squeezing the shorts?Very bullish and patient investor here!"
"From Zacks, rare 180 degrees turn from sell:Lannett Company, Inc. (LCI): This manufacturer of generic versions of brand pharmaceutical products has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy),"
"See that volume? Smart shorts (not really, the smart ones got out at $3) see the writing on the wall. The stampede to cover is now slowly starting. $30, here we come."
The downward trend is going on since 2015. Management talked about strategies which failed every time. The cost saving steps taken have not put company on positive earning. Wait for news which can bring improvement in revenues and earnings
Lannett stopped payment of principal. With current rate of sales decline eventually they will not be able to cover interest. Too many insider sales recently at these low prices is not a good sign.
"in addition to my previous note; one more point note from these sentences-""Moreover, we have a pool of over 20 generic products from owned or partner sources that are currently pending approval from the FDA.Several of which we believe could receive final approval and be launched in FY'19.These include generic CONCENTRA(clarithromycin) and LEVOTHYROXINE ER."" - it means levothyroxine come back in products list(in future)."
"It will be another big day tomorrow. After Hours trades: 113,120 shares, last price $5.4Very unusual."

That buyout of Kremers Urban was a real deal.
Moody's stable rating today is huge as many more funds and institutions are apt to buy. Finally a good management team is in place. I am twice as positive as last week now--and I was super positive last week. First shorts to cover win.
"Despite the Down market LCI closed up much to the dismay of the shorts. They are losing and need to consider the changing positive events around Lannett. Frankly they risk a takeover bid exceeding $10 a share,"
Is it the next gamestop short squeeze? LCI could be a very good target ... and fundamentals are much better than GME.

(NYSE: LCI) announced the amendment of its Senior Secured Credit Facility Term A loan of $275 million, which takes the company a step closer to emerging from debt following the loss of generic levothyroxine, according to Raymond James.The AnalystAnalyst Elliot Wilbur maintains a Market Perform rating on Lannett.The ThesisAlthough the modification of the original Term A loan doesn’t change the cash outflow profile of principal obligations related to the loan, it “slightly loosen the shackles on the company” and “should afford ample ceiling well through loan maturity in 2020,” Wilbur said in a note.

"Average volume for the last 10 days is 4.7 million shares. That is almost 12% of outstanding and 15% of float traded every day. Somebody is here with an agenda churning those shares. This time I am not complaining - like the price action. Option volatility increased a lot, so the covered calls sellers and naked put sellers are doing OK too."
