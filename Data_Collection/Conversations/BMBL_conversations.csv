"The only reason I invested is because I believe the drug works and I believe that HGEN has taken the right steps to get past the Regulatory Gatekeepers and to the sick that need it. That hasn't changed, except to say that the REG G's have taken a lot longer than I expected. When the stock goes down so much with so little volume, I take it as a comfort. I might be sick, but I was just in the same boat with $BMBL, $EBAY, and $LOW as well. If the stock was shooting sky high without the EUA, that's the time to be on guard.. $SESN is the ultimate example of that for generations of investors for all time.But when the SP is trickling down on low volume with virtually every analyst saying buy- I'll wait it out. I can but then again, I don't tend to invest in these out of the money options, WHICH by the way, is what I believe is the catalyst of today's SP, and probably tomorrow. If you're sitting on a Call with a Strike Price of 15, I think you're on the menu. Sorry about that..."
"How do you all feel about the upcoming earnings? I'm thinking that since covid was over for a while, there should be an uptick in dating, which hopefully gives BMBL a nudge up."
straight to zero. many man are learning daily about the scam of online dating. 95% of men are left in the cold while the rest of the women rotate between the other 5%.
Since everyone seems to agree that this stock is going down I think I might buy some.
"BMBL, someday, has to evolve into e-commerce. Would be a significant corporate transformation, and real SP upside from that."
This company is ran into the ditch by a dizzy CEO.You have been warned.

— I sold my shares here a while back (made a little). I’ve been wanting to get back in -just need it to drop a bit first…may not happen. Maybe she won’t choose me -as it were…￼
"This company is extremely undervalued. Good price for it at the moment, since it is a growth stock/company. Founder-led CEO, great mission, solid business model, diverse team of executives and board members Bumble has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next couple of years."
For a good time...hop on Bumble...
Gonna see a 15B dollar market cap
HoldHoldHold this stock will be in the seventies by year end.
Red tomorrow. Don't worry people
"wow, I'm not complaining, but can anyone tell me why this jumped up so much? Almost looks like a takeover. Are they paying apple store that much in terms of App store Rev? Is that the factor?"
Gonna see $125 pretty soon
"From what I've heard, the 80/20 rule is now the 90/10 rule. If true, how is the average man supposed to do well on these dating apps, and what will compel these average men to continue paying for premium dating app services? How will dating apps generate revenue if the demand for premium services goes down due to average men not getting the results they want?"
"Lol, imagine buying a dating app stock"
Shorted 1000 shares at 57.8
Bumble is a bubble
https://discord.gg/fpcmUZQ
Bumble is up 7.28% to 52.59
Look what happened to DASH and that’s food delivery. This is poon delivery worth way more.
Going to $60 after ER
Too many emotional people here being too bearish. Never show negative emotions or attachment to this stock. Just buy and wait. No one cares about your feelings- it does not affect the price of the stock.
What is happening this stock? I need to see upside. Things are opening up and Covid is under control so this stock should be upward.
BEAT!!
Why is it down 
Earnings will be a massacre. 50% drop to under 15 !!!
lol I'm starting to think the stock isn't going to go up right away just because a bunch of dudes here can't get dates.
Staying away for next 6months fairly certain it’ll be cheaper by then
"12.5 million users with more being added everyday. Also expanding into India, Germany and a host of other countries. A lot of potential for growth here, especially as COVID lifts and we deal with... um... ""pent up demand"" lol."
100$ soon
Wow back to 500 shares. I bought 500 shares 3 times on ah trading by accident!!!! The order said dropped and that was it so I kept submitting the order and next thing I know I look up and I own 2000 shares?!!????? Has anyone ever seen this??? I fixed it I sold them and made 20.00 per lot of 500 but omg this was and is very unsettling!!!
"""Our first quarter results reflect significant growth in paying users as well as improved monetization, positioning us to raise full year 2021 guidance,"" added Anu Subramanian, CFO of Bumble. ""Our high flow through rates, efficient marketing strategy, and shared technology platform are driving operating leverage in the business. In the first quarter, we successfully completed our IPO, enabling us to pay down $200 million in debt and in further strengthening our balance sheet. We are making strategic investments in product and technology to continue growing our community and capitalizing on the large market opportunity in front of us."""
"Any dude able to get a successful date yet, that this stock ipo'd and trading at 75 bucks?"
What is causing the surge?
"Bumble is doing more than just a dating app, it is doing great things for the society.It's boom time"
"If you look at the statistics most men don't even meet women from these apps 80% of the matches don't even respond back and from the 20% that do only 1-2% chance of it turning into a date, and Bumble is one of the worst ones because you have to wait for the woman to respond first, within a 24HR timeframe. Anyways feel free to down vote me, i just think there are better uses for your money."
Youngest female bringing a company public. It will not fail on that alone. No technical analysis needed. Give society what it wants. Invest in that principal alone and you will do better than any analyst.
15 or 30% drop tomorrow ??
Looking forward to earnings. I expect we’ll get a nice pop.
Give it a couple of weeks and this could be close to 80$ a share
So guys I did the math with match groups valuation and Bumbles valuation in comparison match is leveraged at 17 times its valuation and Bumble is 13 times its valuation. Therefore it is likely that this stock should hit 88-92 range to be fairly valued thus Monday will be very green. I can conclude that much of the pullback came from the tech sector.
$20 dollars by 2022.
why is tech down while market is exploding makes no sense the ER is gonna be higher than they originally predicted so I would say that has to raise this stock some at least in the short term.
And IPO lockup is lifted today!
All the negative news on market in July is not helpful. Big losses for this stock lately. The leadership will step up and proof that this stock could be like match. It should be!
Looking at last one month chart30% UP SILENTLY
Awaiting options to begin trading to set a price target of 10 dollars for 2023.
isnt it malpractice to buy your own stock before an earning report major insider trading
Everyone that invested here since the IPO is under water.
"Really nice, I like how they are giving 2 weeks paid vacation to every employee, unlimited time off, 6 months maternity leave. If they need more money they will just issue more shares. Nice little 50% drop in share price so we the shareholders can fund their little mental health fest over at Bumble."
Looking forward to hearing more from CEO David Foulkes on Mad Money tonight
Whole app of Karen's as well as investors
"At some point the market will recognize this as a next-gen tech/retail stock, and with its low float, combine to move the SP North quickly … likely not till Q4, once Covid is more contained … JMHO"
How do you think Bumble compares to Match Group?
any ideas why the big drop today ?
This stock has been 45% down from the high. Why can it be going up even though making profit last report. What is your thoughts?
Good time to get in this stock? I already own MTCH but want a piece of all the action 
"given this is a hard-to-valuate social media stock, I'm polarized ... it could a) break $100 in a week, or b) fall below $50 ... but the irrational run-up of DoorDash makes me lean to 'a' ... I'm closing my eyes and jumping-in"
Just like any IPO this will step down to 10 dollars.. Facebook did it to 19 . Sure this will too..
Love is expensive
12% of the float short? Bumble bears are in the house of pain & many of them apparently still do not get it. And then there is the huge open interest in the $55 calls expiring next week with a 6:1 ration of the 55 calls versus the 50 puts. Whoops!
$40 soon
$10 by next week. Bumblechickceo pretty sensitive on weight remarks. Easy... please dont ban me.LOL
Stay strong fellow bumble’s ... don’t let the bashers put doubt or fear in your investment. Wasn’t that long ago door dash & Airbnb ipo’d and people were screaming that is was falling !!! It’s doubled since .. food for thought
Motley Fool recommended today
One of the best post pandemic opening up stocks yet !
This can go down to 55 easily
"There's nothing about this app that will change how 90% of the women chase after the top 10% of the guys. Same old situation: disappointed ladies, and lonely dudes . No amount of ""woman-centered engineering"" can change basic evolutionary biology. Also, for all the talk of ""female empowerment"" since they have to ""make the first move"", this is generally NOT something women actually want. Why work for attention when, as a woman, you already feel this is basically your birthright?"
Success is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration. Lets hold firmly to our patience which will be greatly rewarded. There will be many green days and by year end we will safetly be in the sixties if not seventiesHold on tight and stay strong
What do you guys predict? $90 by Tuesday?
going to cross 100 soon.
buy below $54 the second offer price.
time to load up for coming earnings. people go out for dating and meet.
Positive results! I think we may see some buying tomorrow on the open :)
Gonna fly as more reopens
BMBL is up 8.92% to 69.69
Any chance Match wouldMerge with BMBL?
Just remember.....Bumble has more upside than Match so where do you think Match investors will go?!?! RIGHT HERE!!
Sold 1000 made 330.00 I’ll try to buy it again. You margin more is risky
Market cap $8bn. Should be $1bn max. It’s that simple. This app has been existing for years and it’s still losing huge money every quarter.
me and this stock have an odd relationship I shorted this thing 4 times during the ipo and then like 4 times after that overall I have never held this stock for a longer period than 4 days and it has treated me well we dont have a long term relationship i feel really good about shorting this particular stock pumping then dumping. overall thos stock also seems really easy to do that with. anyway best of luck to longs.
110 by next friday
"This is a well managed company in a hot market, stagnant competition, and huge room for growth. How anyone looks at this under $50 and decides to pass is beyond me."
stocks making plays late day dont jinx me but I still have faith this will hit 90$ end of month

"To the misogynists on this board, please go away. And you might consider getting some help.Bumble is a well run, well conceived, well backed company (as shown by yesterday's quarterly and annual report)"
"Match/Tinder getting added to S&P500. That is not good for BMBL because mutual funds will be required to shift their allocation to the new addition. Feels like short term BMBL is a sell given its run in past 10 days. Anyway, the earnings are coming for another couple of months, so no real catalyst for upside in my opinion."
Even if they did 200 million in EBITDA....So maybe they push 3 billion market cap. The company is valued at 8 billion!! More than a 50% drop is anticipated.
dating app at 75 dollars per share??? i can't understand it. how overvalued it is
"My understanding is that there is no dilution… no new shares are being issued, and none of the money is going to Bumble. Simply investors offering their existing shares to the public."
This is gaining after hours expect 75-79$ range Monday just a bad week for tech including match buy the dip right now hold till 100$
Bought at 76 
I expect the stock to go down about 50% short term and then go back up long-term very slowly to about 150 or $170 a share over the course of a year
Bumble is up 8.71% to 51.77
Bumble is up 7.60% to 49.99
still buy and date. wow
Enjoy shorting BMBL! 39 on Friday!

At 50M shares outstanding... that's about a 3.5 BILLION dollar market cap for a dating company that's losing money... in a pandemic environment. Hmmm...
Technical bounce or more to come?
$20 by next week. huge short position 150%.
the trend is up after a great quarter report. hold tighly to move up to the IPO price.
"Huge turnaround: Net earnings were $323.4 million, or 189.5% of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to Net loss of $55.8 million, or (70.5)% of revenue for the period from January 29, 2020 to March 31, 2020 and Net loss of $32.6 million, or (81.4)% of revenue for the period from January 1, 2020 to January 28, 2020."
Easy short and day trade

Everyone laughed at airbnb ipo.. now look at them. Bumble isnt overpriced

Very impressive

I’m out good luck. Had to sell 500 shares entire position margin call on other positions. Made a few dollars was not worth it.
Don't care what the earnings are. Would not buy this.
Short this and take your 50% by the next week
through 1000 into we'll see where it ends up in 1 year

I'm stuck with 2000 shares at 69. No end in sight. Going to under 30
Well guys tomorrow will be another day of shorting this stock may the best man win BOYS have some fun lol
Will fly tomorrow user base is growing
Their app is extremely biased against men. One report from a female and they block the males account. Overly feminist company. Bearish
"Where is this company going to get their growth from? From what I see in society, it seems like 80% of the women are chasing after the same top 10-20% of men, so where does that leave the average man looking for a date? On top of that, since women are the ones making the initial contact on this particular app, how does the average man even get in the game?"

"Etrade gave me an ipo offer of 37-39 i missed it by a day. Bumble is the best dating app out there for males and females. The woman gets to make the first move eliminating 100s of #$%$ messages to the female, it enables better matches and lasting relationships."
How is this stock popular? Lol Throughly confused
Next week this hits $90.
"The daily chart though .. Market was red today, and BMBL was resisting.. a slight push on Monday will take it to the moon... entered at 67.. hold!!"
Hold Hold Hold this stock is moving into the sixties next week and by the release of Q3 reports of immense profit it will zoom into the seventies easy peasy. So guys hold hold hold and by year end it will be huge leap forward.

"Why don't you buy such a cheap stock as soon as possible? The intrinsic valuation is 70B, the reasonable stock price should be 140, the discount is 30%, and it is worth 98 shares.

"Wow, BMBL is listed top 100 most influential company."
https://discord.gg/VFAa4xGZ
Mkt Cap of $8B.. There is still room to grow. This stock should be around 130-140 which would put overall mkt cap at $13B
why is this down by so much today lol
well guys 5 days in a row RED LETS GOOOOOOO!!!!
Anyone see what full year guidance is? I heard it was increased but wondering how high.
Ok usually I give doom and gloom prophecys but Monday will be green however the long term future may be bleak expect a 75-81 range Monday considering how much it moved in its last few hours.
I don’t see what is so special about this app. Women make the first move?? Most women I know like the guy to start the conversation. I see this app continuing to go downward especially after earnings. Too many free dating apps out there.
"BMBL is a good company, only question is when will the stock reflect that. Right now the soil for the stock price to grow in is extremely sterile. I think this company will eventually find its footing but it has been extremely painful to hold since the IPO thus far. I have faith the stock will eventually perform though as reopening will skyrocket their revenues as more people begin to date again."
shorted 2000 shares at 47.8. Will cover at 40. Eaasy 15k !!
120 by next Friday
im stuck with 4000 shares bought at 71. Completely hosed...this looks like its going back to 50
NOOOOOO !!!! WHY DIDNT I COVER AT 45 !!! DONT WORRY IT WILL BE BACK TO 40 BY TOMORRIW
Technology and multiple streams of revenue!! Looks good to me!
Don't expect 100$ Monday but expect 77$ like if you are trying to short and get out don't sell below 77
Smashed through the expectation and the stock falls. I am outrageous.
"So this fad company doubled their operating loss to 11 million, but all they show you is positive metrics that led to a doubling of an operating loss. Buy Buy Buy......people that do not understand accounting love companies that lose money !!!!"
stop blessing needs company PR to announce some good news. under water too long.
"At Q1, they had a significant top and bottom beat, but they give soft guidance for Q2, and the SP has languished ... did they actually believe that, or were they overly conservative, or were they sandbagging for Q2? ... we will know on Aug 3, but it seems to me that Q2 should be good and they have a strong story around int'l and new initiatives that go beyond just dating ... so I'm betting on a SP rise into Q2 ... JMHO and GL!"
As long as user keep growing they’ll have more add rev growth and Ofcourse users will pay for profile perks
"If I was $MTCH or $BMBL management, I would buy 20% of $MOMO company ($600m now) ... as a hedge in case they miss the biggest world market... and... as long term cash management... with the 4% dividend... and all the upside if growth is back as suspected... this is a no brainer... While Momo has nearly has much cash on its account as its own market cap...Daimler had 10% of $TSLA not so long ago... was a clever move to keep it... but nice to take it in the past... it is just a hedge..."
There's a lot of buzz around this one.
Nice move today. Next stop is $55.

Short Squeeze army is opening up voting for the next target tickers of a big squeeze.https://qrco.de/shortsqueezearmy Bulls are voting on Short Squeeze Targets this weekend. Here is the example poll: https://shortsqueeze.army/target-ticker-poll-example/
UP?????
Bumble will be more of a Facebook/LinkedIn hybridized social network app than a dating app in 5 years. You guys understand that right? 
bumble will bungle but before that it will stumble
$MOMO earnings should be next week. $Momo = Tantan in China (Chinese Tinder)... Current PE is 9... yes 9... check it now?
Current market cap after today’s move is about $17B - sitting back and holding this breaks $100 so I can short.
Thought I’d share a fun fact with the board here- I met my fiancée on bumble in 2018.
"No job , no money for dates . No problem,"
Bumble smashes earnings expectations and crashes? What gives?
Not a value play. I be buyer around 20-25.
BMBL EPS beats!!!

Isn’t bumbl opening its first restaurant/bar later this year?
I'm actually very surprised that Bumble didn't fall more tech companies took a huge hit both Thursday and Friday it did rise after hours on a Friday it may be overvalued but I wouldn't be surprise if it 85$ or 78$ by next week
This stock truly is unloved
Told you this early morning! Who missed out shorting BMBL all day today?
"hyped, overvalued. IPO at 43$ but immediately jumped to 70$ right off the bat. So much for retail investor. Wait and get it at 5 bucks soon."

"Research study: Like: if you've used this app and invested in BMBL, Dislike if you've never used this app but are invested. Don't be shy, this serves a purpose."

"Bumble is the best platform for women to pursue the top 20% caliber of men, without the ‘harassment’ from the bottom 80% tier. Too bad most of the women will just get run through by those top tier men before being tossed back to the pool. Most of the women will wind up old with cats and wonder ‘where did all the Good men go’? It’s a hilarious but sad state of affairs."
Let's be honest. This is a $2 stock.
It was over $60 two days ago and today is $52.60. Unbelievable.
It has been difficult to date and to find love during the lock down and social distancing. BMBL was high $84 when it went IPO the first day. Its earning says this is only the beginning of a strong uptrend. I met my husband on line during 2011 and we are still very happily married today. I see BMBL goes over $100 before summer.
$200 before the end of February.
Should tick 75.00 by friday.
I bought 1 share as a token thats where I met my girl
"Seems a bit over priced, could see a better entry point around $30"
bumble will stumble
Lockup
My email from E-trade said the IPO last filed price would be $37-$39. I would think that's what the expected price would start at. It looks like it started at $76 the first day (feb 11). How can that be such a big difference? Can someone tell me if my numbers are right/wrong? any info.
OVERVALUED TIMES FOUR!!!

I heard about BMBL the other day on (http://Thetraderguide.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
The system really is rigged. They just went IPO. Institutions bought in first and immediately started lending their shares out to shorts. Employees aren't selling because they have a lock up period. Do you think retail investors bought and then immediately sold at a loss? The demand is the same. All they did was flood the supply side temporarily but those shares still need to be accounted for. I honestly don't know why we allow shorted shares to affect the value of a stock. It's just creates a system that allows for market manipulation. What's worse is if the price drops enough people will panic and sell a little lost which in my opinion isn't fair to them.
Will go down to $35 in few days then it's good to buy. I wouldn't touch until bleeding stops
Highly oversold. Bought in at $40 and rising everyday.
"Bumble is ticking up and nicely moving in the positive trend with increasing after-hour volumes. That is a good thing, right?"
this could triple for no reason 2021 is wack this stock is very popular for no reason.
If you’re holding you’re going to suffer some losses I would just forget about the stock and look at it in a year from now when it’s tripled
Crashing
"I use it, I like it!"
green
"I'd like to know the frequency in which the majority of men on the app receive matches. In my opinion, that's a crucial metric that provides insight as to whether or not this is a good business model and if this company can have success long-term."
This stock keeps dropping where can I speak to the manager?
When Airbnb went IPO it dropped from 143. Everyone said it will go to 40.Now it went upto 219 today
it is dating time after reopening
"Overpriced and overhyped. Love it, glad I bought in!"
HOW DO YOU BUY AT THE IPO PRICE !??! ?!?!? Why do i keep seeing IPO's start at some low price in the day and then suddenly the line goes up. I tried to put an order right at 6am PST today and nothing happend. #$%$
I saw 8% up after results and then it fizzled out .. sad 
Well guys I'm sorry to tell you all this but I'm thinking 48$-64$ by end of week this is way overvalued and lacks anyway to justify its price tag of 16 billion dollars all the financials are bad it will be quite fun for option traders this week so buckle up this stock is going for a ride. Currently the company lost 30m in its last quarter after revenue of 45m so they are currently burning through cash and have no way to make up for it other then firing personnel. The dating app game is overpopulated by a million apps if you are actually considering this stock as a long term investment you haven't invested very long everything is bad here except the media attention.
"At a time when entrepreneurial women are the diamond of society, Bumble is humbly a great potential to fill a niche in the social networking and dating applications' sphere.The concept is original and so it will be part of my portfolio for the long term. It is important to follow and know the numbers of customers who subscribe and the financial results at the end of each quarter."
Bumble - lets goooooo!!!! 30% up to get me out of this!
will be better after covid end. dating business will rebound strongly after no dating so long. and go above $100
"$BMBL growing revenue at 50%...compared to $MTCH at 21%. Match's brands just cannibalize each other, and they bog down their expenses on so many different apps. Bumble, on the other hand, places all of their energy into one, limiting their costs and avoids competing it's brands against one another.$BMBL is the future of dating. Women love it...it's as safe as they can get in a dating app."
Happy to officially have a position in $BMBL. 50% revenue growth and the ways of dating moving forward!
"I can see the hate on this board. The same hate and bad comments I saw when AIRBNB & DOORDASH had their IPO. Everyone was like Sell Sell, and see today....within a month or two, their stock price is too high. Even SNOWFLAKE. The same will happen to Bumble too, keep hating, the stock price will be near $200"
When the Market crashes you will be able to scoop this up for $4.00.
This is one of MANY dating aps. They are brand new. To survive and be profitable their growth in the early days needs to be sky high. IT was dismil. And as a result of just a very slight increase......Their operating loss DOUBLED. This company will be gone and not survive in this lousy market for desperate people.
"$bmbl , a dating app is trading at over $70 and now palantir is tanking . Lol"
"Is Trevor Milton, joining the board?"
CNBC had this on yesterday. Growing faster than Match and more profitable and better upside.
where are the single people at?haha
So bumble is worth 8 B now?
"""Net earnings were $323.4 million, or 189.5% of revenue"". That's mathematically impossible."
"I said this yesterday regarding Bumble - It's going to do very well long-term, as everyone wants Whitney and team to succeed. We're going to see institutional buyers and ESG funds also get into this. Match did well and this is going to do even better. It's a growth play and should be part of your portfolio."
