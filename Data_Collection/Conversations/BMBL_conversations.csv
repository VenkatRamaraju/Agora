Their app is extremely biased against men. One report from a female and they block the males account. Overly feminist company. Bearish
Why is it down 
"Bumble is ticking up and nicely moving in the positive trend with increasing after-hour volumes. That is a good thing, right?"
"At Q1, they had a significant top and bottom beat, but they give soft guidance for Q2, and the SP has languished ... did they actually believe that, or were they overly conservative, or were they sandbagging for Q2? ... we will know on Aug 3, but it seems to me that Q2 should be good and they have a strong story around int'l and new initiatives that go beyond just dating ... so I'm betting on a SP rise into Q2 ... JMHO and GL!"
BMBL is up 8.92% to 69.69
the trend is up after a great quarter report. hold tighly to move up to the IPO price.
"No job , no money for dates . No problem,"
One of the best post pandemic opening up stocks yet !
I don’t see what is so special about this app. Women make the first move?? Most women I know like the guy to start the conversation. I see this app continuing to go downward especially after earnings. Too many free dating apps out there.
Highly oversold. Bought in at $40 and rising everyday.
Looking forward to hearing more from CEO David Foulkes on Mad Money tonight
any ideas why the big drop today ?
Easy short and day trade
I heard about BMBL the other day on (http://Thetraderguide.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Earnings will be a massacre. 50% drop to under 15 !!!
And IPO lockup is lifted today!
Going to $60 after ER
"Strong buy because, you know online dating always works out so well lmao."
$200 before the end of February.
Positive results! I think we may see some buying tomorrow on the open :)
"So this fad company doubled their operating loss to 11 million, but all they show you is positive metrics that led to a doubling of an operating loss. Buy Buy Buy......people that do not understand accounting love companies that lose money !!!!"
Mkt Cap of $8B.. There is still room to grow. This stock should be around 130-140 which would put overall mkt cap at $13B
"Seems a bit over priced, could see a better entry point around $30"
Bumble is up 7.60% to 49.99
"Bumble is the best platform for women to pursue the top 20% caliber of men, without the ‘harassment’ from the bottom 80% tier. Too bad most of the women will just get run through by those top tier men before being tossed back to the pool. Most of the women will wind up old with cats and wonder ‘where did all the Good men go’? It’s a hilarious but sad state of affairs."
At 50M shares outstanding... that's about a 3.5 BILLION dollar market cap for a dating company that's losing money... in a pandemic environment. Hmmm...
My email from E-trade said the IPO last filed price would be $37-$39. I would think that's what the expected price would start at. It looks like it started at $76 the first day (feb 11). How can that be such a big difference? Can someone tell me if my numbers are right/wrong? any info.

"""Our first quarter results reflect significant growth in paying users as well as improved monetization, positioning us to raise full year 2021 guidance,"" added Anu Subramanian, CFO of Bumble. ""Our high flow through rates, efficient marketing strategy, and shared technology platform are driving operating leverage in the business. In the first quarter, we successfully completed our IPO, enabling us to pay down $200 million in debt and in further strengthening our balance sheet. We are making strategic investments in product and technology to continue growing our community and capitalizing on the large market opportunity in front of us."""
— I sold my shares here a while back (made a little). I’ve been wanting to get back in -just need it to drop a bit first…may not happen. Maybe she won’t choose me -as it were…￼

shorted 2000 shares at 47.8. Will cover at 40. Eaasy 15k !!
bumble will bungle but before that it will stumble
"I can see the hate on this board. The same hate and bad comments I saw when AIRBNB & DOORDASH had their IPO. Everyone was like Sell Sell, and see today....within a month or two, their stock price is too high. Even SNOWFLAKE. The same will happen to Bumble too, keep hating, the stock price will be near $200"
Taking off now the deal is done
Told you this early morning! Who missed out shorting BMBL all day today?
The system really is rigged. They just went IPO. Institutions bought in first and immediately started lending their shares out to shorts. Employees aren't selling because they have a lock up period. Do you think retail investors bought and then immediately sold at a loss? The demand is the same. All they did was flood the supply side temporarily but those shares still need to be accounted for. I honestly don't know why we allow shorted shares to affect the value of a stock. It's just creates a system that allows for market manipulation. What's worse is if the price drops enough people will panic and sell a little lost which in my opinion isn't fair to them.
"Will this stonk go to 100? If so, when?"
Enjoy shorting BMBL! 39 on Friday!
Short Squeeze army is opening up voting for the next target tickers of a big squeeze.https://qrco.de/shortsqueezearmy Bulls are voting on Short Squeeze Targets this weekend. Here is the example poll: https://shortsqueeze.army/target-ticker-poll-example/
I shorted another 2000 shares at 48. Guaranteed drop to at least 45
Crashing
buy below $54 the second offer price.
"I bought a 1K shares at $47, thinking that it would spike up after earnings. But this thing turned out to be a dud! With earnings solid for last quarter, the projections seems light for next quarter and rest of the year. I sold it at $48 and pocketed $1K for an hour's work. Not sure if this will go up tomorrow."
Everyone that invested here since the IPO is under water.
Staying away for next 6months fairly certain it’ll be cheaper by then
This stock has been 45% down from the high. Why can it be going up even though making profit last report. What is your thoughts?

It was over $60 two days ago and today is $52.60. Unbelievable.
"The only reason I invested is because I believe the drug works and I believe that HGEN has taken the right steps to get past the Regulatory Gatekeepers and to the sick that need it. That hasn't changed, except to say that the REG G's have taken a lot longer than I expected. When the stock goes down so much with so little volume, I take it as a comfort. I might be sick, but I was just in the same boat with $BMBL, $EBAY, and $LOW as well. If the stock was shooting sky high without the EUA, that's the time to be on guard.. $SESN is the ultimate example of that for generations of investors for all time.But when the SP is trickling down on low volume with virtually every analyst saying buy- I'll wait it out. I can but then again, I don't tend to invest in these out of the money options, WHICH by the way, is what I believe is the catalyst of today's SP, and probably tomorrow. If you're sitting on a Call with a Strike Price of 15, I think you're on the menu. Sorry about that..."
"given this is a hard-to-valuate social media stock, I'm polarized ... it could a) break $100 in a week, or b) fall below $50 ... but the irrational run-up of DoorDash makes me lean to 'a' ... I'm closing my eyes and jumping-in"
$20 by next week. huge short position 150%.
green
Coming down now
"$bmbl , a dating app is trading at over $70 and now palantir is tanking . Lol"
"Lol, imagine buying a dating app stock"
I expect the stock to go down about 50% short term and then go back up long-term very slowly to about 150 or $170 a share over the course of a year
"Bumble is doing more than just a dating app, it is doing great things for the society.It's boom time"
JOSH BROWN LOVED BMBL AT $70.18 ON MARCH 11 2021...
Current market cap after today’s move is about $17B - sitting back and holding this breaks $100 so I can short.
Bumble will Stumble then crash and burn.
Picked up 1000 more at 70.36 gonna play with 500 and keep 1000 long term.
Gonna fly as more reopens
100$ soon
"Match/Tinder getting added to S&P500. That is not good for BMBL because mutual funds will be required to shift their allocation to the new addition. Feels like short term BMBL is a sell given its run in past 10 days. Anyway, the earnings are coming for another couple of months, so no real catalyst for upside in my opinion."
Anyone see what full year guidance is? I heard it was increased but wondering how high.
"This company is extremely undervalued. Good price for it at the moment, since it is a growth stock/company. Founder-led CEO, great mission, solid business model, diverse team of executives and board members Bumble has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next couple of years."
This stock keeps dropping where can I speak to the manager?
im stuck with 4000 shares bought at 71. Completely hosed...this looks like its going back to 50
It has been difficult to date and to find love during the lock down and social distancing. BMBL was high $84 when it went IPO the first day. Its earning says this is only the beginning of a strong uptrend. I met my husband on line during 2011 and we are still very happily married today. I see BMBL goes over $100 before summer.
time to load up for coming earnings. people go out for dating and meet.
"I use it, I like it!"
dating app at 75 dollars per share??? i can't understand it. how overvalued it is
Awaiting options to begin trading to set a price target of 10 dollars for 2023.
sold all my 4000 shares at 71.3
Give it a couple of weeks and this could be close to 80$ a share
Not a value play. I be buyer around 20-25.
https://traders-ideas.com/aifinance
So guys I did the math with match groups valuation and Bumbles valuation in comparison match is leveraged at 17 times its valuation and Bumble is 13 times its valuation. Therefore it is likely that this stock should hit 88-92 range to be fairly valued thus Monday will be very green. I can conclude that much of the pullback came from the tech sector.
15 or 30% drop tomorrow ??
This can go down to 55 easily
"Keeps on giving. Rode this sub-40 last time but sold in the high 40s, missed 1/2 my profits. Not this time."
This company is ran into the ditch by a dizzy CEO.You have been warned.
where are the single people at?haha
Whole app of Karen's as well as investors
As long as user keep growing they’ll have more add rev growth and Ofcourse users will pay for profile perks
Over 70 tomorrow enjoy
Bumble - lets goooooo!!!! 30% up to get me out of this!
$70?!!!!!! This is way over priced. I would rather buy $CCIV
"Is Trevor Milton, joining the board?"
BMBL EPS beats!!!

"Research study: Like: if you've used this app and invested in BMBL, Dislike if you've never used this app but are invested. Don't be shy, this serves a purpose."
What is happening this stock? I need to see upside. Things are opening up and Covid is under control so this stock should be upward.
What do you guys predict? $90 by Tuesday?
bought some today
Red tomorrow. Don't worry people
why is tech down while market is exploding makes no sense the ER is gonna be higher than they originally predicted so I would say that has to raise this stock some at least in the short term.
this is not a 70$ stock overvalued on hype
Hold Hold Hold Bumble wil doon penetrate into the seventies
Since everyone seems to agree that this stock is going down I think I might buy some.
DONT WORRY PEOPLE ! this is a classic short term short squeeze. WIll go to 42 next week. SHORT AND STRONG PEOPLE ! HOLD
"My understanding is that there is no dilution… no new shares are being issued, and none of the money is going to Bumble. Simply investors offering their existing shares to the public."
Wow back to 500 shares. I bought 500 shares 3 times on ah trading by accident!!!! The order said dropped and that was it so I kept submitting the order and next thing I know I look up and I own 2000 shares?!!????? Has anyone ever seen this??? I fixed it I sold them and made 20.00 per lot of 500 but omg this was and is very unsettling!!!
why is this down by so much today lol
https://discord.gg/VFAa4xGZ
Just like any IPO this will step down to 10 dollars.. Facebook did it to 19 . Sure this will too..
Looking forward to earnings. I expect we’ll get a nice pop.
HOW DO YOU BUY AT THE IPO PRICE !??! ?!?!? Why do i keep seeing IPO's start at some low price in the day and then suddenly the line goes up. I tried to put an order right at 6am PST today and nothing happend. #$%$
Happy to officially have a position in $BMBL. 50% revenue growth and the ways of dating moving forward!
This stock truly is unloved
12% of the float short? Bumble bears are in the house of pain & many of them apparently still do not get it. And then there is the huge open interest in the $55 calls expiring next week with a 6:1 ration of the 55 calls versus the 50 puts. Whoops!
Hold Hold Hold this stock is moving into the sixties next week and by the release of Q3 reports of immense profit it will zoom into the seventies easy peasy. So guys hold hold hold and by year end it will be huge leap forward.
Technical bounce or more to come?
How is this stock popular? Lol Throughly confused
The results look very good . What do you think ?
Scam company going to bankruptcy
Look what happened to DASH and that’s food delivery. This is poon delivery worth way more.
Market cap $8bn. Should be $1bn max. It’s that simple. This app has been existing for years and it’s still losing huge money every quarter.
"Really nice, I like how they are giving 2 weeks paid vacation to every employee, unlimited time off, 6 months maternity leave. If they need more money they will just issue more shares. Nice little 50% drop in share price so we the shareholders can fund their little mental health fest over at Bumble."
When the Market crashes you will be able to scoop this up for $4.00.
me and this stock have an odd relationship I shorted this thing 4 times during the ipo and then like 4 times after that overall I have never held this stock for a longer period than 4 days and it has treated me well we dont have a long term relationship i feel really good about shorting this particular stock pumping then dumping. overall thos stock also seems really easy to do that with. anyway best of luck to longs.
Well guys tomorrow will be another day of shorting this stock may the best man win BOYS have some fun lol

"At a time when entrepreneurial women are the diamond of society, Bumble is humbly a great potential to fill a niche in the social networking and dating applications' sphere.The concept is original and so it will be part of my portfolio for the long term. It is important to follow and know the numbers of customers who subscribe and the financial results at the end of each quarter."

looking forward to rise back to $80 :-)
This is one of MANY dating aps. They are brand new. To survive and be profitable their growth in the early days needs to be sky high. IT was dismil. And as a result of just a very slight increase......Their operating loss DOUBLED. This company will be gone and not survive in this lousy market for desperate people.

"From what I've heard, the 80/20 rule is now the 90/10 rule. If true, how is the average man supposed to do well on these dating apps, and what will compel these average men to continue paying for premium dating app services? How will dating apps generate revenue if the demand for premium services goes down due to average men not getting the results they want?"
"This is a well managed company in a hot market, stagnant competition, and huge room for growth. How anyone looks at this under $50 and decides to pass is beyond me."

"$BMBL growing revenue at 50%...compared to $MTCH at 21%. Match's brands just cannibalize each other, and they bog down their expenses on so many different apps. Bumble, on the other hand, places all of their energy into one, limiting their costs and avoids competing it's brands against one another.$BMBL is the future of dating. Women love it...it's as safe as they can get in a dating app."
"If I was $MTCH or $BMBL management, I would buy 20% of $MOMO company ($600m now) ... as a hedge in case they miss the biggest world market... and... as long term cash management... with the 4% dividend... and all the upside if growth is back as suspected... this is a no brainer... While Momo has nearly has much cash on its account as its own market cap...Daimler had 10% of $TSLA not so long ago... was a clever move to keep it... but nice to take it in the past... it is just a hedge..."
"""Net earnings were $323.4 million, or 189.5% of revenue"". That's mathematically impossible."
straight to zero. many man are learning daily about the scam of online dating. 95% of men are left in the cold while the rest of the women rotate between the other 5%.
If you’re holding you’re going to suffer some losses I would just forget about the stock and look at it in a year from now when it’s tripled
All the negative news on market in July is not helpful. Big losses for this stock lately. The leadership will step up and proof that this stock could be like match. It should be!
"""Total Revenue Increased 38% to $186 million Bumble App Revenue Increased 55% to $127 million Raising Full Year 2021 Outlook"""
"How do you all feel about the upcoming earnings? I'm thinking that since covid was over for a while, there should be an uptick in dating, which hopefully gives BMBL a nudge up."
CNBC had this on yesterday. Growing faster than Match and more profitable and better upside.
How do you think Bumble compares to Match Group?

"Where is this company going to get their growth from? From what I see in society, it seems like 80% of the women are chasing after the same top 10-20% of men, so where does that leave the average man looking for a date? On top of that, since women are the ones making the initial contact on this particular app, how does the average man even get in the game?"

Let's be honest. This is a $2 stock.
When Airbnb went IPO it dropped from 143. Everyone said it will go to 40.Now it went upto 219 today
Don't care what the earnings are. Would not buy this.
"12.5 million users with more being added everyday. Also expanding into India, Germany and a host of other countries. A lot of potential for growth here, especially as COVID lifts and we deal with... um... ""pent up demand"" lol."
Motley Fool recommended today
Even if they did 200 million in EBITDA....So maybe they push 3 billion market cap. The company is valued at 8 billion!! More than a 50% drop is anticipated.
Good time to get in this stock? I already own MTCH but want a piece of all the action
