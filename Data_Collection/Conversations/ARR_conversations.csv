"This site states that book value per share is $23.83. That includes the preferred shares. A common share owner needs to value it off book value excluding the preferred shares. That figure is $22.42. So if this site states that the stock is trading at 0.9x book value than the implied value is actually $22.42 x 0.9x = $20.17A case can be made that the 0.9x should be lower as the spread continues to be pressured lower and book value continues to decline.In the meantime, the market seems to be sending a message. The stock yields 10.5% yet the short float is 12.5% and rising. On a high yielding stock that is alot of conviction."
Insiders exercise stock options. May hold for a month or so. Then their selling with resume.
"In Motley F.'s recent article, they highlighted ARR net income as $0.32 only for her 1st qrt. whereas according to ARR official report that her 1st qrt. net income was $1.03 which is much more and thus can afford the monthly payment of C$0.10 per share. MF. further stated that millions of American people are out of jobs and thus can't afford to pay the mortgage loan. If this Is the case, how come the house prices keep climbing higher and higher. There is no doubt that some people are out of jobs, but those with higher incomes are getting more which is the end result of why houses prices are getting higher and higher. Those low-income people will never know how to buy a house since they never have the down payment. The REIT co. will never deal with them and thus have no impact on what they are suffering. The 2008 bank crisis will never happen again as our government has introduced lots of regulations to govern them since then. Certainly, we need to keep an eye on the ARR 2nd qrt. report. have a nice day."
Correction: dividend decrease. The dividend is decreasing.
All this management team wants is collect as much money as they can with no respect at all for the shareholders.
Should I just sell this for a 50% loss or just hold forever? I’m certainly never going to buy more of this POS.
"I bought ARR 20k @$10.- and would sell them at about $16.- in about 2 months. If the price stays at $12.- or less, I will hold them for their monthly dividends of about C$1,800.- monthly which is much better than those given by the banks. There is no dobut that ARR is a good co.. good luck to all. Peter 2020.6.9"
"This may not have an impact, but write to IR anyway to express your frustration about this management team."
"Actually GAAP does matter. ARR's business model is built on a severely leveraged business with razor thin profit margins. So management requires a large derivative book to protect against disaster. When the derivative books declines that translates to lower GAAP values or book value. That is their business model. Also, FYI higher asset yields is a result of declining assets in the portfolio. That is not a good thing. Horrific research report."
The company has updated its common share book value as at 11/30/18. It has decreased again to $21.86. If you take this sites Price/Book value multiple of 0.87x the implied value of the common shares is $21.86 x 0.87 = $19.02. Keep in mind this is of end of November and does not include the Powell hike and credit carnage in December.In the meantime the short interest continues to increase despite the current yield.
Big share buyback plan announced today!
"ARR +23% since Oct 14 and 1% per mo. divvy. A real life real estate broker frowned on my entry, what was she thinking about? ARR good for decade?"
30% of the B shares are being redeemed Feb. 12 at $25/share plus monthly dividend
"at least they bought back some shares$35.9 million ($0.55 per Common share) Core Income including “Drop Income” (as defined below), which represents an annualized return of 10.4% based on stockholders’ equity at the beginning of the quarter$0.51 per Common share dividends for Q3 at the rate of $0.17 per monthCore Income exceeded dividends paid for the thirteenth straight quarter330,000 Common shares repurchased; current remaining repurchase authorization of 8,295,000 shares"
I'm loving the cycle. I keep using the high yield dividend to buy more and more at a lower price. This in turn gets me more and more dividend income which I continue to buy more shares at a lower price. The yield on this process is amazing.The only people that get hurt in the end are quick buck artists and short sellers.
Has their been a dividend cut? (Asking in case I missed news of one)
The 5 year chart looks great. I'm not sure what chart you are reading. The dividend is solid for the rest of 2019. This was the 1st divi cut in 2 1/2 years
Earnings came in above the avg analysts estimates.. rock and rolll meanwhile the dividend is holding up fine
That only shows how bad this management team is and they are cashing moneny for running this corporation. Write to IR express how you feel.
"My understanding the 2 qtr was $0.33 per share, whereas the chart by Yahoo shows it as $0.19 per share. it is a huge difference. Would someone come out to correct it the soonest. Thank you. 2020/7/23"
Ex-Dividend day... so sellers are here... actually not a bad time to buy on this dip.
"Nice move up today on strong volume. Don't see any news other than that the dividend will stay the same, which waspretty much expected. Maybe an upgrade?"
Maybe heading back to $27?
"just luv it now ,2 y worth of dividends and now even above purchased price :)"
JonesTrading reiterated ARR with Buy and raised price target to $22.50 from $20.
Looks like firm footing after EX-Div today. Perhaps this will continue. It's nice to see for a change ... :)
Go ARR!!!
"OMG ... now they make someone Manager of Risk Analysis? You don't need a Manager for that ... I can tell you quite well who is at risk ... it's the Investor, you and I, who is at risk. Just more money thrown out for something we already know ... ARR again at its finest ... !!!"
"Tue, 02/26/2019 - 09:05 - US Home Price Growth Weakest Since 2012 - US home price growth has slowed for nine straight months - up just 4.18% YoY - the weakest since Sept 2012, according to S&P Case-Shiller's 20-City Composite index. But forget the fundamentals. Its the corporate governance that has now created a real problem for the underwriters and the ETFs that are stuffing retail clients with this stock."
Maybe they raise the dividend. Need too !
Hopefully the company will use some of that cash to buy back stock today...ha ha!!!
How Low Can it Go ??
"I don't understand why this preferred isn't trading higher, especially since everyone is seeking yield. The preferred C pays 7% at the call price of $25.00. Unless the company goes bankrupt, the preferred will get paid and the dividend is cumulative. If it gets called, the shares are paid off at $25 each. So at the current $18.87 closing price, there is tons of upside. So why not buy this up and enjoy the dividends. I own over 15,000 shares."
I have made much more dividend money than I have lost in share price. In fact the lower the share price the better the DRIP is. I will keep this stock as long as that is the case.
This held up pretty well today all things considered. Eventually traders will begin to realize that higher interest because of a booming economy is also good for REIT's providing that the yield spread begins to widen a bit. I'm looking for the 30 year treasuries to climb.
probably not...your loss is in the drop in share price. I have a hard time understanding why they would offer millions of shares at an approximately 15% discount to book.
near 20% down in 8 weeks.
Quite bearish for the stock to be down on a big up day for market. The underwriters still have 11 million shares to offload post financing.
"I just got a return email from investor relations. they stated read the April 2, 2020 press release. they are going to quarterly dividend for the 2nd quarter of 2020 and will decide whether to continue. also in the press release they stated they will announce dividend amount toward the end of june. my guess is anything up to .51 (2 * .17). they are an rmbs. I guess it will depend on how much people will default on their mortgage because of lost wages during the corona virus. i've had them since before they did their reverse split. that really hurt. ever since they changed ceo's back then they have been going down. I stayed in and bought on lows trying to recover, but they keep lowering their dividend payout. it helped hearing that up lift from Zack's. but you never know. good luck and let's see what happens in June (?)."
"Interesting indeed: Insider ULM SCOTT reports buying 80,000 shares of $ARR for a total cost of $1,434,600.00 https://fintel.io/n/us/arr"
"They issued lot of stocks at higher prices and share price went down. Now cutting common share dividends again, it may go down by further diluting price. Is this reason for repurchase of common shares? Will SEC look into this company? Any idea?"
I guess management was listening and restored the monthly dividend. Reduced yield is fine. It allows a margin of safety in case the crisis takes a turn for the worse. Management can always increase dividend over time as the economy improves.
"For those of you newbys...the only reason you get into reits like ARR is because of the 10% dividends. One day, it will return to a better price. Sit tight... Collect regular dividends."
You must have been paying for the stock with all the IR fees the company has been paying you.
some more book value growth will bring the value hunters back
Several REITs have raised their monthly dividends recently and their shares prices are then raised in the market. Hope that ARR will follow.Hope that ARR will follow
"Dear Investors,The trolls are going to try and discredit the information I posted earlier. Other than my current ARR position, which is protected by my broker (so you'll have to take my word for it), the information on dividend changes and stock splits is publicly available. Remember that dividend information already takes into account the reverse split. You don't have to calculate it. I downloaded the information from my broker's web site, but you can find it anywhere. I'm done for the day. Thank you for your time."
We really must applaud ARR management for a job brilliantly well done!
"While the market soars to new records, mREITs tank.Very disheartening."
RED ALERT - In the latest monthly corporate update the company stopped disclosing its NIM (net interest margin). A massive red flag. That is a critical figure in the business model. What has happened in markets recently? Why 3-month treasury yields have jumped above 5-year treasuries. They must be getting killed on NIM which means cash flow is dropping like a stone which means the dividend is at red alert status. Would you put it past this management? The stock chart says no.
Nice move up this week on moderate volume. Meanwhile those dividends just keep rolling in and the housing market is doing well to boot.
A mighty fine chart last few months. What do you guys think of earnings just in?
"The new effective vaccine, a new high record house sold plus a reliable management team of this co. I have faith that ARR will be back to $17.- in about 6 months."
Dividend maintained!
"According to Yahoo, ARR’s book value is $23.48. That’s a 17% discount! Income investors need to pay attention."
"ARR PEAKED IN mAY AND oCT 23 THEY WILL MISS EARNINGS FOR THE 4TH TIME IN A ROW. They are paying 10 cent dividends out of thin air. ARR is down 9.08% since feb 17, 2021. Do your diligence. $REML"
Talk about over sold. I am in.
"Monthly report just out! As suspected it's a disaster. Book value dropped again and now at an annual run rate of 30% decline. That is why the Price/Book multiple will continue to be rated downward to at least 0.5x. Also, they re-instituted NIM disclosure. Thank you to the IR folks for alerting management that we caught them. Just like we thought NIM is getting killed. Counter parties are raising the cost of financing aggressively. But here is the kicker. They are now at 9.2x levered. Basically management has gone all in with the house in order to salvage the dividend which should have been cut last year. The house always wins."
"Quarterly loss $2.21 as per news-- 4/24/2019. Still pays 19 cents/mo., 11.32%. Another stock offering will come as usual? Need to check history. Can anyone explain how they do ?"
Today was Ex-Div date for ARR. So that is 19 cents of the 53 cent decline today.
Looking at ARR history and records we can see that this management team is amongt the worst of the entire REITs.
Did ARR just skip August Dividends?
Just announced that the dividend is maintained at the present level! Go ARR!
Looks like it was a program buy at a critical technical level i.e. before the trap door opens. Better indicator is all the D code transactions in 2019. D code is insider sells to the company. Wasn't the stock good value then? Unthinkable that management raised capital and yet were using some of that cash to fund their insider sales.
great a div cut. from .19 to .17. I absolutely hate div. cuts. they do share buybacks and cut our div s. not happy!
Monthly report out. Cost of funding has increased again. Canary in the coal mine especially for a business that has 80% of assets tied to short terms repo financing agreements. We have seen this movie before. Higher funding costs eventually lead to forced repo unwind which then leads to distressed selling and forced sales of the mortgage bond portfolio. The canary is heaving.
ARMOUR Residential REIT (NYSE:ARR) reported quarterly earnings of $0.64 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $0.60 by 6.67 percent. This is a 7.25 percent decrease over earnings of $0.69 per share from the same period last year.
"I wonder if the Balyasny analyst still has his job.............tick tock.When Hemingway was asked how he went broke he replied ""At first slowly. Then rapidly"""
ARR went from 78 in 2009 to 10 in 2021. Not a good longterm record.
my average on this stock which I have owned for 4+ years is right we are now and I have made over $7000 i'm not sure I would call it crud.
"Buying AGNC....better, safer REIT....also pays monthly"
"These guys should all be fired. How can they still be running this REIT?James Robert MountainARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. - CFO, Treasurer & Secretary* Jeffrey J. ZimmerARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. - Co-CEO, Co-Vice Chairman & President* Scott J. UlmARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. - Co-CEO, Co-Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer"
A very bullish chart here with some insider buying. High dividend yield. All you have to do is pay attention to the intermediate range charts.. a real money maker.
"According to MarketBeat "" investor purchased 10 times more put options in ARR than a typical day "" . This means that they are anticipating a price drop , but i don't know why !!!! Any opinions ?"
Now if management could start moving the dividend up to where it was we are cooking with grease!
Started building my position today. All agency backed is the place to be in the REIT world imho. Holding AGNC and ARR now. Waiting for NLY to come down a little more and I will consider buying them.
does this mean the dividend will be lowered?
The day after dividends... Low prices and in a month you get large dividends and growth.
ARR on a nice uptrend! Let's hope it continues!
Great buy in opportunity.
buy back starting after x dividend move up time to buy in. 
Hold on guys the ARR is not the play not yet. I think it will be a buy under $17 but the ARR was at $20 or higher it has taken a hard fall. The climb it has had lately is offset by big days of drops. I am looking to buy under $17 that way it would be worth the risk with a .17 dividend but dividends on common stock can be stopped at anytime. The ARR-PB should be repurchased as well and then issue new shares at 6%.
"ARR A GREAT PLACE TO BE IN REITs NEW HIGH TODAY SINCE MARCH 27, 2020."
"I missed the earnings call, have to listen to replay. was there any good news or outlook?"
"Now I understand. Only the common shareholders are getting f^@#&#. The preferred's are doing just fine. So it seems both the positive and negative comments here are spot on, depending on which you own. If the current price near $16.90 does not hold, look for support at $16.65. If price falls thru $16.65, look out below cause we heading to $16.30 or lower."
The core income was $0.19 per share whereas the comprehensive income was $0.33 per share. I believe its 2nd quarter total income was $0.33 per share. And it should be shown in the chart as $0.33 Would someone adjust it the soonest. thank you very much 2020./7/23
This management team is a joke amd the dont seem to realize it! Not Professional enough to resign and let someone who knows how to run un REIT take over.
"Although it took a huge hit in March 2020, this REIT has been steadily climbing and paying good dividends for many months now. I see no reason for this to stop. Getting a 10+% dividend while the share price keeps climbing back towards 20 seems like a no brainer. But with my luck, now that I posted this, it will start trending back down. lol"
I want my monthly dividends back
"Um, this is a really, really bad stock, in case anyone needed a reminder."
Anyone have thoughts on why the larger than usual drop? Looks like large volume also so far. Thank you in advance
"According to Yahoo, ARR’s book value is now $24.40 after latest earnings report."
Great stock I read an article where it says the company is gonna break even soon and on the path to profitability again. Financial statements look good. Healthy book value with talented management. These are good news even after COVID.
"Different sector but I absolutely hated ring energy oil swaps because even if everything went right and it did with oil prices, they gave away all the up side. Moral of the story is all these people care about is simply protecting their wealth and their own jobs."
As far as the dividend goes they should soon be able to afford to bump it up with new investment returns. In the meantime we continue to collect .19. Enough with the gloom and doom Ponzi postings.
AAR - the vehicle of choice for destroying your wealth. Don't be deceived by its dividend yield.
"Dividend players each month? Lots of price & volume action month to month lately. Aug 14th was ex-dividend date, so not quitesure why such a substantial move today on high volume. Anyone know if there was other news of some kind..."
earnings today? where's the link to the conference call
Interesting how the price spiked up with the 1pm Treasury auction. Several other reits did as well.
"$ARR GRUBER MARK, CIO of Armour Residential REIT, Inc. bought 3000 shares on 2020-06-15. https://formwhispers.com/s?t=ARR"
Anything below 18 is a screaming buy. Way oversold here. Huge % return on dividend.
Can we reach $11.00 today
Is the dividend safe at this level? I am planing to buy 200 shares tomorrow. Comments?
Wow I see the Wolf of Wall Street IR boys were prepared ahead of time for this one.This disaster gets bigger. GAAP income a massive loss which shows business model hanging on the edge. Dividend propped up by increasing leverage even further. Now at 9.7x!
Wow great results stock popping after hours
"This management team did a reverse split 8:1 on August 4, 2015. They never, never got anything good for shareholders and it will continue the same way for years. They are at the bottom of REIT management team."
why is ZACKs Still saying its a good stock
Stock price will not rebound to pre crisis levels if monthly dividend is not reinstated.
what a surprise. It is up for a part of the day. Not use to seeing green with ARR
Core income exceed dividend paid for the last 12 quarters. Repurchase of shares on schedule. Officers buying and stock reacting with value still over $20.50 per share. THIS BABY IS WORTH RIDDING.  The short sellers are 
Look at history. Another reverse is possible along more dilution.So many in its history. Why so many financial gurus are telling us to buy? Look at the price today. Any thoughts?
Today's 8-k gives a book value of roughly 11.09. How does that seem to long time holders. Also seems to show an increase in net interest margin coming. Anything else of note?
what about April and may dividend??? just like when they did the 4 to 1 split a while back. that money for those 2 months just didn't disappear. the covid damage shouldn't be felt until months later when they see who's paying the mortgages.
Buypack 25$. And no more dividend ! Need to sell in July
"As a shareholder of ARR, I am much confused with co""s recent declaration. It claimed that for the 1st quarter of 2021, the comprehensive income is $0.40 per share, the core income is $0.23 whereas the total net income is $1.03 per share. What a big difference and misleading! Can our CEO come out to clarify it?If the net income is C$1.03 per share, then the share price would be much different then. 2012/4/24 peter"
With $0.09 div per month ($1.08 p.yr) @ $8.20 we get 13%. Should ARR regain confidence perhaps 8% could be sufficient==> which gives $13-$13.50 as a target.When 10% yield is wanted==> $10.80 is the target.Not selling this... maybe buy more in weakness....
"is there anyone knows why the stock is declining? I don't hear any news, neither good nor bad."
"Comprehensive income over $0.90 per share, and net income over $0.30 per share. It is great news for all shares holders. When the dividend is increased next year, the price will likely exceed $11.-congrats. to all longs. 2020/10/28"
Book value is over $21 a share right now. Trading at a good discount to that.
"APLE seems far better Reit with less share price , predictable, non gimick agenda, rising earnings and good management in my opinion - unlike others who issue more shares to pay same dividends, dilute existing share values months after months."
"number6 has a history of bashing stocks - ARR, NRZ, AGNC, WMC, plenty of others. Looks like another troll with nothing positive to provide / no factual data."
"Meanwhile, ARR is paying $190 a month on 1,000 shares. Next dividend: January 28"
"New 52 week low, and I think new all-time low. Good job, ARR management."
They just bullshitted the stockholders and robbed everyone of us of the April and May dividends. They knew if they would announce suspension of the dividends the stock would crashed. Well it crashed anyway. I’m waiting for my breakeven point then I’m out of here
Suspect ARR will do buy back at these prices. Dividend look good for rest of 2019. At these $ it's a buy. 
same dividend .17 per share payable Sept 27.
ARR sufferer here . Happy back to monthly dividend but my avg is $15. I don’t own much. Hope to hear from fellow investors if it’s looking good moving Fwd
Looking at investing. Can anyone tell me if ARR stands to gain from the rising 10 year yield? I know their share price fell as rates fell.
bt 3000 @9.59.........with yield burn in 12 days will get 9.95 next week now have 11000.....
Wow arent they getting ready for a class action soon?
Moving up nicely 
Pre market looks good
"not a problem with quarterly dividend. problem will be how much is the dividend. need to payout 90% earning to keep REIT status, but what if no earnings?"
"Near one year low. Reminds me episode of Al Bundy's wife, spent more and more on credit cards to give 2% rewards to poor Al in return. Keep collecting monthly dividends while original invested principle keep going down. There are so many like this in market, hard to figure out good one"
"Keep your eyes on shares outstanding in the next release. Did management and the board massively dilute shareholders (many who booked their losses) only to buy back stock in an attempt to staunch their self-made fiasco. If so, the legal case gets even stronger."
"Why would I buy this stock, that has lost more than 10% recently, when it only gets that back in a year in dividends... and will probably continue to decline, as it has in the past?"
Omg. Closed $11.00.
very thoughtful of the manager to reduce their fees! this allows them to get through this tough time and possibly grow the investment book. probably be moving to 11 cent monthly dividend first half of next year. its trending in the right direction. GLTA
Another great buying opportunity. Silly BZ put out the GAAP earnings and not the publicly accepted core earnings. Scared the lambs out and helped the MM push it down. I bought more at a current yield of 11.5%. Easy investing. I like the $.10 per share dividend every month.
"Still see a lot of ARR trolls here. I'm going to keep my eye on this, so that innocent people don't get duped. My position is 895 shares at $29.78. Why is it so hard for people to look up data on their own? No matter. Here's some information for you, which you could have easily found on your own. I merely copied and pasted the monthly dividend amount, starting in 2011, showing each time that ARR changed its dividend. Someone posted that the dividend has not been reduced in 2 years. That statement will not be true until January 2019. Let's see what happens ...Year Pay Date Dividend Amount Dividend Type 2017 1/30/2017 0.19 Regular2016 5/27/2016 0.22 Regular2016 4/27/2016 0.27 Regular2015 8/27/2015 0.33 Regular2015 1/27/2015 0.32 Regular2013 10/28/2013 0.4 Regular2013 4/29/2013 0.56 Regular2013 1/30/2013 0.64 Regular2012 10/30/2012 0.72 Regular2012 4/27/2012 0.8 Regular2011 10/28/2011 0.88 Regular2011 1/28/2011 0.96 Regular"
This thing is about to fly
REIT shares are coming back to their highs soon. Hold them tightly especially ARR.2020/12/4
ARR is up 4.90% to 10.48
Lets hope the uptrend continues into Earnings (2/13) GLTA
I love it. I keep buying more at any price below 12. You get a 10% yield on your investment with a lot of upside potential as the economy opens up. This is easy investing.
Why the clocking today? Down sharply for it
FED starting new program called PDCF (Primary Dealer Credit Facility) on Friday which buys all types of paper including mortgage backed securities that mREITs leverage to make money. mREITs should begin to move back up.

More people are coming out and business is getting better these days. Hope that dividend can beraised next month.
Hope that the price keeps rising.
I just purchased 1000 more of ARR and it took ages. They were going through 1 share at a time at current price. I pushed price to 2 cents above ask and it still took 10 minutes and three separate transactions. Not a lot for sale I think
Thinking about jumping in on the IRA and holding long term. Dividend still paying out monthly? Thoughts on price at this point..
Substantial stock buyback program by ARR board... We're still well below book value which is around $20
"in 2009, the equivalent price of ARR was $801. in 2010, it had dropped to $56/share. That is quite a haircut. in 2014 it was $34/ share. Another haircut. Now it is $12.26. Haircut again. Proceed with caution. As long as interest rates stay low, this company will be fine. When they rise, the value of the mortgages will drop, and the price below book discount will disappear.. Good current income, but you cannot put this in a safe and walk away."
Book value is still over $20 a share..
anyone like this new look? I don't care for it…
The greed risk is very high for stocks like this. The stock price will continue to erode corporate greed rises. It is ashame. Use to be a much higher price. New offering after new offering after new offering then reverse stock split after reverse stock split. Consumer Protection Bureau where ard you?
It looks like they are trying to do some good things. They got rid of some debt the A class Pref. I know the books dont show it now but they were paying 19 cents a month per share every month. When your dealing with a lot of money 2% makes a big difference. This is not a big Capital Gains stock. I have said before under 17 I believe is a good entry point if they keep paying dividends.
At the very bottom of the press release they disclose the monthly dividend has been reduced to $0.17 from $0.19. It's started. Only a matter of time before the entire dividend is wiped out.Why redeem the Series A prefs? Because those prefs have activist rights and can force liquidation to protect their capital. Hard to say which side initiated this move but for management it seems to be a temporary stay of execution.Corporate governance wise another disgrace. Raise common share equity to make the prefs whole. What a fabulous use of proceeds for all those common shares investors that bought the deals. Disgraceful.
Whoever it was that gave ARR a shot of Tequila today ... thank you ... !! :)
"This LQQKS (eyes rolling) 2 good 2 be 4 real. Will study this while loading up on a couple of solid 8 percenters (OCSL,OHI). I expect the dividend to be cut 'round 13%. 2 tempted 2 buy 2 much. Hopefully (as in impending DOOM), this will work out OK and I'll learn a thing or 2 or 3 or 4."
"LOVE my $MAIN dividend - but I also have bought $ARR, I get about 4 shares of ARR for evey share of MAIN in relative dollars; both pay monthly dividends; so every month for 1 share of MAUN I get 20 cents - but for Four shares of ARR I get 40 cents - so new cash right now is going into ARR - gla"
ARR announced improved January Book Value of $21.04 vs $20.84 for December 2019 even after paying out $0.17 dividend!http://www.armourreit.com/Cache/1001260815.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=1001260815&iid=4238544
25% shareholder dilution in one month! On top of destruction of book value. This has to be a first. No wonder the discussion on class action lawsuits. Check out the exchange with the Ladenburg Thalmann analyst on the Q4 conference call. What a disgrace. There is no non-ETF investor that would buy this stock. At this point it is safe to say that anyone talking up the dividend angle is either company IR or outsourced IR paid to try and prop up the stock for more exercise and sale option activity.
"Big selling today just a day after the CEO bought 5,000 shares. Interesting. Still happy with it and in the money as longas we stay above $19. If it falls below, I'm out."
Got my monthly Dividend Today. No Liquidity Issues Here.
"Looking around, we notice that some REIT companies are giving more money/dividend to their shareholders.Would our CEO do the same? I am hoping..... 2021/2/4"
"Happy One Year Anniversary. July 29, 2018 ARR stock price was $23.66. After lower interest rates and a new stock buyback program that the stock went up, right? No. Down 23.7%. If that is how it performs in the good times what should we expect for July 29, 2020?"
"“We’re in the business that we’re in, we aren’t going to completely stop buying mortgages, we understand the need to pay out that dividend.” Really the way this was said on the call was like a punch in the gut."
How can ARR have negative revenue? Does anyone look at the financials?
"Due to the TRUMP tax cuts ARR now gets a Section 199A dividend. They may also be listed as ""qualified"" dividends. This means that some of your dividends may be considered tax free. Check your brokerage statements."
Can anyone hold management responsible?
There’s +6% short interest in this stock. Am I reading this right? Seems like a lousy bet on a stock to go down when it pays an 11% divy every month that you will be responsible for.
"ARR is a ponzi scheme. Stay away from this stock. Their so call dividend are mostly return of capital; the actual yield is less than 2%. This is why price continue to erode while management charge ridiculous fee and dilute share with periodic stock offering. So many long got burned on the last reverse split.Here is how this ponzi scheme works for the newbies.Fake high yield prop up by Return of Capital to lure in newbies> Public offering of millions shares > price decay > reverse split to prop up and price and reduce share > common holder get destroyed > Rinse and repeat step one.Look at the chart people, look at the chart. This stock used to be 80$ less than a decade ago. Too many shrews and paid pumpers on here. They will undoubted try to get this post remove as well."
ARR's price target raised to $22 from $18.
Were results actually released? I'm struggling to find any info including on their website.
It's quite rare to see a management team raise equity off a severely beaten down stock price and further dilute equity common equity holders.A very negative signal about the future.Cashing up to try and protect the dividend?
"$200 bucks in dividends a month, cost basis of $19. Will gladly hold this until it drops back to break even."
Any new thoughts?
Moving up nicely
How HIGH can it go ?
RED ALERT: Monthly report just out. Leverage increases to 9.3x Book value drops even further to $20.50. June was supposed to be a stabilizing month. The business is broken. Evidence by the dividend increase. Continue to rely on non-arms length entity for 40% or mortgage business. What accounting are they using?
Dividend maintained at current level. Yawn.
"I must say I am confused. ARR has Preferred A and B shares paying a great dividend. Plus, you get more protection with the preferred. The company should be buying back the Preferred instead of issuing more stock. So, you sell more stock to pay the dividend on the stock and Preferred you then pay more dividends on the new issue of stock. Makes no sense at all, if you want to be in this stock at least get into the Prefferreds."
"So ARR in essence skipped the April & May dividends and will pay a June dividend that is about half of the previous (jan - march) monthly dividends. Is that about right? If so, that is not very good."
"If you want to have a really hearty laugh, take a look at a 10 year chart of ARR."
I'm glad I didn't let my broker talk me out of buying this when it was 16.35/sh.. I'm in for the long term and will enjoy the income this produces...no worries...
Looking back at the monthly presentations 2011 to 2020 - it looks like the company bought back 250 million shares of stock taking us to the 83 million currently outstanding - buying that much stock - is a great thing. What am I missing?? Why are some negitive besides the pps drop down of 2009 and 2013?
Loving the price climb since May. Hope that climb continues and maybe we will also get lucky and get a dividend increase sometime this year. But 10% not too bad in today's environment.
Share price drops 50%. Company suspends two dividends - then cuts the dividend almost in half (17 cents to 9 cents). Management fees receive no cut. Did I get all that right? This company's thievery continues.
Bought 1000 shares to start my first dividend Income investment ￼
Going back to $21.
"National Home Price Index rolling over. Approximately 50% of repo transactions are with a non-arms length entity, Buckler Securities. What is underneath that hood? Can't be good if the street has no desire to be a counterparty to ARR. Maybe its the 8.8x leverage. The market seems to finally be sniffing this out. Hitting all time lows!"
2022 will dividends increase?
"Same underwriters, brokerages , banks, who are in dealing with public offering with more shares month after month, are giving high bullish ranking of 7.3 on equity summary score for years. Go figure. No wonder people are losing trusts on such company. History is lesson. Look 10 years"
July 2009 stock was around $80 share . The dividend has been a trick for managers to take your $$$$ . Nobody prosecuted nothing said .
Does anyone know when they will make the decision on the divi?I didn't see anything in the earnings report.
Held this during the financial crisis of '08. Did very well. Bought a nice position at 8.88 yesterday at the close. Look for some rockstar gains from this beast. GLTA.
"On August 1st, 2009, ARR was trading at $78.96."
"ARR's strategy has never changed. I found out back in 2013.1. Issue more secondary stock offerings: * Feb. 19, 2019 public offering of 7,200,000 shares of common * June 26, 2017 public offering of 4,500,000 shares of common stock * January 10, 2012 secondary offering of 9 million shares.2. Lose money3. Cut the dividend4. Do a reverse stock split.5. repeat the process"
24% dividend. nobody thinks it will hold.
If you want out of ARR check out PEI. You can get 3 shares for every 1 of ARR. That would give you 63 cents every 3 months instead of 51 cents for ARR. They seem to know how to get it done
OMG ... didn't ARR just complete an offering of 6 mil shares last month? And here comes another one for another 6 mil? What kind of BS company is this? I guess we now have a good idea why management keeps selling shares ... just a matter of time before ARR implodes ... !!
"Thanks to the inventory of the vaccine. We are now closed to the end of the tunnel.Hold on your ARR, it will run fast and high pretty soon."
"Insiders have purchased 67,000 in the last 6 months of which half was in Feb 2019"
"ARMOUR Residential REIT resumes monthly dividend of $0.09.ARMOUR Residential REIT (NYSE:ARR) declares $0.09/share monthly dividend, -47.1% decrease from prior dividend of $0.17."
Dividend INCREASE of 11%!!!
Time to dilute the shares ... was just a matter of time ... !!
Same games they (ARR and ORC) are playing with issuing more and more stocks (diluting) every year and paying dividends from cash they generate from share sells. History is guide.
"I'm here to update my last response from 5 months ago. Here's a summary if you don't want to look. I bought a bunch of shares, foolishly chasing the dividend. The dividend hasn't kept up with management fees. I've got less money today after reinvesting dividends. My two pig stocks are ARR and PSEC. Both will provide me with some tax relief for the capital gains I have earned from other positions. I left out XRX because I only own a few shares and will likely lose less than $100 when it finally tanks as Icahn digs his heels even further. Back to ARR. I received 5 thumbs up (and two positive comments) and 9 thumbs down. Do you care to take another poll? It's okay to change your vote. Trollers -- please stop pumping ARR. You're lying to the rest of us. Didn't your mother teach you not to lie?"
"ARR 1st quarter net income was $1.03. It greatly does good to its PE and others and has a positive impact on its market price. As inflation is now on the horizon, there is no doubt that the interest rate will be raised, consequently, its net income will be much improved. I am holding ARR long and expect that its market price will soon be over $15.- Watch out. 2021/5/21"
keep buy and get that dividend every month
I have been swapping out my speculative stocks for monthly dividend payers since January as a way to take cash out of the market and its working very well. Cash pile is growing but I am still in the game lol
"On March 27, 2020, the Company paid the previously declared cash dividends of $0.17 per share of its common stock and $0.14583 per share of its Series C Preferred Stock.ARMOUR today also announced the declaration of the April 2020 dividend on its Series C Preferred Stock at the rate of $0.14583 per share to holders of record on April 15, 2020, payable on April 27, 2020.ARMOUR will move to a quarterly dividend on its common stock for the second quarter of 2020. ARMOUR’s Board of Directors will evaluate the Company’s results, financial position, real estate investment trust (“REIT”) tax requirements, and overall market conditions as the quarter progresses. The Company expects to announce its decision regarding the amount of second quarter dividends on common stock in the latter part of June 2020 as well as whether the Company will return to its prior monthly dividend policy. By adopting the more conventional policy of announcing quarterly dividends towards the end of the quarter, the Company believes it can maintain greater flexibility and generate increased liquidity. In order to maintain ARMOUR’s tax status as a REIT, the Company is required to timely distribute substantially all of its ordinary REIT taxable income for the tax year."
hope they hold $.10 per mo just bought 5000 more bet 9.29 - 9.35
Nice discounted shares today…load up…this will be back at $25 soon…remember where you saw it first
"Fred is right , insider selling by CEO jeffry Zimmer . The CEO of the company ARR sold 400000 shates at an average price of $10.57 . This is 25% of his total shares which is major . But in spite of that it did not cause the share price to go down but it actually went up ........!!!!!!!!!!! and that is a good sign !!I believe we are heading back to $20 , i only hope that they will increase the dividend gradually back to 19 cents ...............Merry holidays and may it be a good new year for ARR and its dividend ."
