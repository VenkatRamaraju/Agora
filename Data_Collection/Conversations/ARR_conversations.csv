ANH now 12 per cent dividend moving up.
Ex-Dividend day... so sellers are here... actually not a bad time to buy on this dip.
"They issued lot of stocks at higher prices and share price went down. Now cutting common share dividends again, it may go down by further diluting price. Is this reason for repurchase of common shares? Will SEC look into this company? Any idea?"
"Nice move up today on strong volume. Don't see any news other than that the dividend will stay the same, which waspretty much expected. Maybe an upgrade?"
when are the earnings out?
Any new thoughts?
Not really an indicator of a dividend change. It does mean they are continuing to invest aggressively. We'll see how the shares look in a week or two...
6 month low. Time to load up!
"Thanks to the inventory of the vaccine. We are now closed to the end of the tunnel.Hold on your ARR, it will run fast and high pretty soon."
Book Value per 23rd-JULY-2019 was $.20.73. Yeah Sure...
"Keep your eyes on shares outstanding in the next release. Did management and the board massively dilute shareholders (many who booked their losses) only to buy back stock in an attempt to staunch their self-made fiasco. If so, the legal case gets even stronger."
"In Motley F.'s recent article, they highlighted ARR net income as $0.32 only for her 1st qrt. whereas according to ARR official report that her 1st qrt. net income was $1.03 which is much more and thus can afford the monthly payment of C$0.10 per share. MF. further stated that millions of American people are out of jobs and thus can't afford to pay the mortgage loan. If this Is the case, how come the house prices keep climbing higher and higher. There is no doubt that some people are out of jobs, but those with higher incomes are getting more which is the end result of why houses prices are getting higher and higher. Those low-income people will never know how to buy a house since they never have the down payment. The REIT co. will never deal with them and thus have no impact on what they are suffering. The 2008 bank crisis will never happen again as our government has introduced lots of regulations to govern them since then. Certainly, we need to keep an eye on the ARR 2nd qrt. report. have a nice day."

24% dividend. nobody thinks it will hold.
Bought in at 18.05. I'm not complaining.
"This LQQKS (eyes rolling) 2 good 2 be 4 real. Will study this while loading up on a couple of solid 8 percenters (OCSL,OHI). I expect the dividend to be cut 'round 13%. 2 tempted 2 buy 2 much. Hopefully (as in impending DOOM), this will work out OK and I'll learn a thing or 2 or 3 or 4."
Monthly report out. Cost of funding has increased again. Canary in the coal mine especially for a business that has 80% of assets tied to short terms repo financing agreements. We have seen this movie before. Higher funding costs eventually lead to forced repo unwind which then leads to distressed selling and forced sales of the mortgage bond portfolio. The canary is heaving.
"Um, this is a really, really bad stock, in case anyone needed a reminder."
I'm glad I didn't let my broker talk me out of buying this when it was 16.35/sh.. I'm in for the long term and will enjoy the income this produces...no worries...
10.5 percent cut in dividends announced says it all about pps
"Management has been a seller of stock despite an ""optimistic future"" and despite stuffing ETF retail investors on the deal. Now with implied leverage of 8.1x and a broken derivatives book. What could wrong?"
Why has the dividend dropped throughout the years?
Same games they (ARR and ORC) are playing with issuing more and more stocks (diluting) every year and paying dividends from cash they generate from share sells. History is guide.
"I don't understand why this preferred isn't trading higher, especially since everyone is seeking yield. The preferred C pays 7% at the call price of $25.00. Unless the company goes bankrupt, the preferred will get paid and the dividend is cumulative. If it gets called, the shares are paid off at $25 each. So at the current $18.87 closing price, there is tons of upside. So why not buy this up and enjoy the dividends. I own over 15,000 shares."
This held up pretty well today all things considered. Eventually traders will begin to realize that higher interest because of a booming economy is also good for REIT's providing that the yield spread begins to widen a bit. I'm looking for the 30 year treasuries to climb.
I'm soaking up the the 19's. Its been a great ride for 6 years now
You would think with the possiably of lower Fed rates REITS would be doing better with the spread better. 
Suspect ARR will do buy back at these prices. Dividend look good for rest of 2019. At these $ it's a buy. 
Which is better ? AGNC or ARR ?
Is the dividend safe at this level? I am planing to buy 200 shares tomorrow. Comments?
Pre market looks good
ARR HAS MORE TO GO
A mighty fine chart last few months. What do you guys think of earnings just in?
Almost at the 52-week low.Ugh.
buy back starting after x dividend move up time to buy in. 
Hope that the price keeps rising.
How HIGH can it go ?
Now strongly oversold with an 11% dividend. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/armour-residential-reit-enters-oversold-102410554.html
"Happy One Year Anniversary. July 29, 2018 ARR stock price was $23.66. After lower interest rates and a new stock buyback program that the stock went up, right? No. Down 23.7%. If that is how it performs in the good times what should we expect for July 29, 2020?"
well this dividend cut sucks
Outsider Buying!
when will the SP for this REIT rise into the $16 -$18 RANGE?
Stock keeps going up ?
I predict that AGNC will buy ARR..With only 36 million share outstanding ARR is a BUY...especially now that they own JMI...
Wow great results stock popping after hours
"So ARR in essence skipped the April & May dividends and will pay a June dividend that is about half of the previous (jan - march) monthly dividends. Is that about right? If so, that is not very good."
ARR is up 4.90% to 10.48
probably not...your loss is in the drop in share price. I have a hard time understanding why they would offer millions of shares at an approximately 15% discount to book.
"Minutes after Pulte Homes' CEO warning that 2019 will be a ""challenging year"" for homebuilders, Case-Shiller reports its 20-City Composite price index rose just 4.68% YoY in November (dramatically below the 4.89% expected and the 5.02% October print).This is the weakest home price growth since January 2015..."
When is the next dividend and how much? Did not get April dividend? Any thoughts.
Book value is over $21 a share right now. Trading at a good discount to that.
"Down here near all time lows, dividend yield is now over 12%."

"This management team did a reverse split 8:1 on August 4, 2015. They never, never got anything good for shareholders and it will continue the same way for years. They are at the bottom of REIT management team."
"Fred is right , insider selling by CEO jeffry Zimmer . The CEO of the company ARR sold 400000 shates at an average price of $10.57 . This is 25% of his total shares which is major . But in spite of that it did not cause the share price to go down but it actually went up ........!!!!!!!!!!! and that is a good sign !!I believe we are heading back to $20 , i only hope that they will increase the dividend gradually back to 19 cents ...............Merry holidays and may it be a good new year for ARR and its dividend ."
Can we reach $11.00 today
near 20% down in 8 weeks.
this weakness when the market is up big is worrisome.
Earnings tomorrow? Anyone know for sure?
why is ZACKs Still saying its a good stock
"“We’re in the business that we’re in, we aren’t going to completely stop buying mortgages, we understand the need to pay out that dividend.” Really the way this was said on the call was like a punch in the gut."
Quite bearish for the stock to be down on a big up day for market. The underwriters still have 11 million shares to offload post financing.
buy it now before it's not affordable!
Dividend maintained at current level. Yawn.
Dividend maintained!
some more book value growth will bring the value hunters back
Has their been a dividend cut? (Asking in case I missed news of one)
Held this during the financial crisis of '08. Did very well. Bought a nice position at 8.88 yesterday at the close. Look for some rockstar gains from this beast. GLTA.
I have made much more dividend money than I have lost in share price. In fact the lower the share price the better the DRIP is. I will keep this stock as long as that is the case.

"Reverse split again within 6 months? No positive earning, issuing more shares diluting other holders is routine?"
ARR on a nice uptrend! Let's hope it continues!
NLY had a decent report as well. Up after hours. Let's hope this bodes well for ARR which is releasing earnings tomorrow.
Did all the insider buying buoy ARR inspute of the 10% plus dividend cut?
ARR reached a 52 Week high at 21.08
Whoever it was that gave ARR a shot of Tequila today ... thank you ... !! :)
FED starting new program called PDCF (Primary Dealer Credit Facility) on Friday which buys all types of paper including mortgage backed securities that mREITs leverage to make money. mREITs should begin to move back up.
"APLE seems far better Reit with less share price , predictable, non gimick agenda, rising earnings and good management in my opinion - unlike others who issue more shares to pay same dividends, dilute existing share values months after months."
Will ARR be able to maintain its divi?
"Home sales in the U.S. slumped in December, while prices inched up slightly, marking the smallest annual increase since the end of the last housing crash in 2012, according to data from brokerage Redfin. The median home price rose to $289,800 in December, a gain of 1.2%, the slowest monthly pace since March 2012. Sales dropped by almost 11%, the biggest decline for any month since 2016, Redfin said."
Wow arent they getting ready for a class action soon?
"Biggest volume spikes today were buyers, not sellers. They'll have no difficulty moving this share offering quickly."
"I missed the earnings call, have to listen to replay. was there any good news or outlook?"
ARR is down 4.93% to 10.21
ARMOUR Residential REIT (NYSE:ARR) reported quarterly earnings of $0.64 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $0.60 by 6.67 percent. This is a 7.25 percent decrease over earnings of $0.69 per share from the same period last year.
"ARR A GREAT PLACE TO BE IN REITs NEW HIGH TODAY SINCE MARCH 27, 2020."
Nice move up this week on moderate volume. Meanwhile those dividends just keep rolling in and the housing market is doing well to boot.
Great stock I read an article where it says the company is gonna break even soon and on the path to profitability again. Financial statements look good. Healthy book value with talented management. These are good news even after COVID.
"Last dividend declaration ARR mentioned that there could be a larger distribution in dividends prior to record date to meet some Real Estate Reit tax criteria. This could also come as a supplemental distribution any time during the year. However given that this was announced right on the declaration date of 11/3/16, we could get a pleasant surprise before next week. Those short, watch out. I noticed some of the buys today and there were some big purchases made today including end of day. The privileged few get advance notice of this."
"According to MarketBeat "" investor purchased 10 times more put options in ARR than a typical day "" . This means that they are anticipating a price drop , but i don't know why !!!! Any opinions ?"
"ARR is a Ponzie scheme. They keep their management fees high, while eroding the PPS. I own 1,000 shares. Don't repeat my mistake."
"If you buy the stock today, the 13th will you get the dividend with the ex date being tomorrow."
Nice discounted shares today…load up…this will be back at $25 soon…remember where you saw it first
Yes exactly the same underwriting cast of characters. None of them wanted to be lead underwriter either. Just joint bookrunners.......meaning no one wanted to the be the key target in the event of litigation.
This management team is a joke amd the dont seem to realize it! Not Professional enough to resign and let someone who knows how to run un REIT take over.
anyone like this new look? I don't care for it…
More people are coming out and business is getting better these days. Hope that dividend can beraised next month.
"Same underwriters, brokerages , banks, who are in dealing with public offering with more shares month after month, are giving high bullish ranking of 7.3 on equity summary score for years. Go figure. No wonder people are losing trusts on such company. History is lesson. Look 10 years"
"I'm here to update my last response from 5 months ago. Here's a summary if you don't want to look. I bought a bunch of shares, foolishly chasing the dividend. The dividend hasn't kept up with management fees. I've got less money today after reinvesting dividends. My two pig stocks are ARR and PSEC. Both will provide me with some tax relief for the capital gains I have earned from other positions. I left out XRX because I only own a few shares and will likely lose less than $100 when it finally tanks as Icahn digs his heels even further. Back to ARR. I received 5 thumbs up (and two positive comments) and 9 thumbs down. Do you care to take another poll? It's okay to change your vote. Trollers -- please stop pumping ARR. You're lying to the rest of us. Didn't your mother teach you not to lie?"
Substantial stock buyback program by ARR board... We're still well below book value which is around $20
OMG ... didn't ARR just complete an offering of 6 mil shares last month? And here comes another one for another 6 mil? What kind of BS company is this? I guess we now have a good idea why management keeps selling shares ... just a matter of time before ARR implodes ... !!
"Near one year low. Reminds me episode of Al Bundy's wife, spent more and more on credit cards to give 2% rewards to poor Al in return. Keep collecting monthly dividends while original invested principle keep going down. There are so many like this in market, hard to figure out good one"
Has a dividend for January been announced?
"I must say I am confused. ARR has Preferred A and B shares paying a great dividend. Plus, you get more protection with the preferred. The company should be buying back the Preferred instead of issuing more stock. So, you sell more stock to pay the dividend on the stock and Preferred you then pay more dividends on the new issue of stock. Makes no sense at all, if you want to be in this stock at least get into the Prefferreds."
I last traded and look at thus MB in 2014. How many reverse splits have they had in that time?
"This may not have an impact, but write to IR anyway to express your frustration about this management team."
Looking at ARR history and records we can see that this management team is amongt the worst of the entire REITs.
Citigroup trades at 0.83x book and it has a global franchise with increasing shareholder value. ARR should be trading for far less. No more than 0.70x and that's being generous. 0.70 x $21.06 = $14.74
At the very bottom of the press release they disclose the monthly dividend has been reduced to $0.17 from $0.19. It's started. Only a matter of time before the entire dividend is wiped out.Why redeem the Series A prefs? Because those prefs have activist rights and can force liquidation to protect their capital. Hard to say which side initiated this move but for management it seems to be a temporary stay of execution.Corporate governance wise another disgrace. Raise common share equity to make the prefs whole. What a fabulous use of proceeds for all those common shares investors that bought the deals. Disgraceful.

I want my monthly dividends back
Loving the price climb since May. Hope that climb continues and maybe we will also get lucky and get a dividend increase sometime this year. But 10% not too bad in today's environment.
Were results actually released? I'm struggling to find any info including on their website.
Lets hope the uptrend continues into Earnings (2/13) GLTA
10 % Divi and the price slowly chugging along . What's not to like
Hold on guys the ARR is not the play not yet. I think it will be a buy under $17 but the ARR was at $20 or higher it has taken a hard fall. The climb it has had lately is offset by big days of drops. I am looking to buy under $17 that way it would be worth the risk with a .17 dividend but dividends on common stock can be stopped at anytime. The ARR-PB should be repurchased as well and then issue new shares at 6%.
"Still see a lot of ARR trolls here. I'm going to keep my eye on this, so that innocent people don't get duped. My position is 895 shares at $29.78. Why is it so hard for people to look up data on their own? No matter. Here's some information for you, which you could have easily found on your own. I merely copied and pasted the monthly dividend amount, starting in 2011, showing each time that ARR changed its dividend. Someone posted that the dividend has not been reduced in 2 years. That statement will not be true until January 2019. Let's see what happens ...Year Pay Date Dividend Amount Dividend Type 2017 1/30/2017 0.19 Regular2016 5/27/2016 0.22 Regular2016 4/27/2016 0.27 Regular2015 8/27/2015 0.33 Regular2015 1/27/2015 0.32 Regular2013 10/28/2013 0.4 Regular2013 4/29/2013 0.56 Regular2013 1/30/2013 0.64 Regular2012 10/30/2012 0.72 Regular2012 4/27/2012 0.8 Regular2011 10/28/2011 0.88 Regular2011 1/28/2011 0.96 Regular"
"number6 has a history of bashing stocks - ARR, NRZ, AGNC, WMC, plenty of others. Looks like another troll with nothing positive to provide / no factual data."
No earnings report. Armour REIT is scrambling in circles. They are too busy trying to dilute the shareholders by another 7 million shares: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428205/000142820520000145/0001428205-20-000145-index.htm
Wow I see the Wolf of Wall Street IR boys were prepared ahead of time for this one.This disaster gets bigger. GAAP income a massive loss which shows business model hanging on the edge. Dividend propped up by increasing leverage even further. Now at 9.7x!
"It is now 100% of the B shares being called! Feb 27, 2020"
July 2009 stock was around $80 share . The dividend has been a trick for managers to take your $$$$ . Nobody prosecuted nothing said .
Anything below 18 is a screaming buy. Way oversold here. Huge % return on dividend.
If you but a few days after dividend the price usually falls more than the divi. Sell a few days before divi and get more upside than the divi amount.
"Quarterly loss $2.21 as per news-- 4/24/2019. Still pays 19 cents/mo., 11.32%. Another stock offering will come as usual? Need to check history. Can anyone explain how they do ?"
"ARMOUR Residential REIT resumes monthly dividend of $0.09.ARMOUR Residential REIT (NYSE:ARR) declares $0.09/share monthly dividend, -47.1% decrease from prior dividend of $0.17."
Looks like firm footing after EX-Div today. Perhaps this will continue. It's nice to see for a change ... :)
"Buying AGNC....better, safer REIT....also pays monthly"
"New all-time low hit today.Thank you, ARR management!;"
Time to dilute the shares ... was just a matter of time ... !!
"Is ARR a buy right now? Already own some,,, any thoughts"
"Looking around, we notice that some REIT companies are giving more money/dividend to their shareholders.Would our CEO do the same? I am hoping..... 2021/2/4"
"once 10 yr goes back to 1.5% or more, book value will go back over 11. they have alot of dry powder. they will invest when it's a good time. they playing it smart."
The greed risk is very high for stocks like this. The stock price will continue to erode corporate greed rises. It is ashame. Use to be a much higher price. New offering after new offering after new offering then reverse stock split after reverse stock split. Consumer Protection Bureau where ard you?
Great buy in opportunity.
"Tue, 02/26/2019 - 09:05 - US Home Price Growth Weakest Since 2012 - US home price growth has slowed for nine straight months - up just 4.18% YoY - the weakest since Sept 2012, according to S&P Case-Shiller's 20-City Composite index. But forget the fundamentals. Its the corporate governance that has now created a real problem for the underwriters and the ETFs that are stuffing retail clients with this stock."
Buy back and officers buying looks like a good entry point. 
"Bought in a few days ago right at the $20 mark. Then of course, right after my buy order it plummets more. Started to look like the downward slide was stopping but obviously not."
Why would the managing firm still be waving their fees since Q2 of 2020. How is that at all a good sign.
Dividend INCREASE of 11%!!!
Did ARR just skip August Dividends?
Look at history. Another reverse is possible along more dilution.So many in its history. Why so many financial gurus are telling us to buy? Look at the price today. Any thoughts?
AAR - the vehicle of choice for destroying your wealth. Don't be deceived by its dividend yield.
great a div cut. from .19 to .17. I absolutely hate div. cuts. they do share buybacks and cut our div s. not happy!
With $0.09 div per month ($1.08 p.yr) @ $8.20 we get 13%. Should ARR regain confidence perhaps 8% could be sufficient==> which gives $13-$13.50 as a target.When 10% yield is wanted==> $10.80 is the target.Not selling this... maybe buy more in weakness....
A very bullish chart here with some insider buying. High dividend yield. All you have to do is pay attention to the intermediate range charts.. a real money maker.
what about April and may dividend??? just like when they did the 4 to 1 split a while back. that money for those 2 months just didn't disappear. the covid damage shouldn't be felt until months later when they see who's paying the mortgages.
Two days. The underwriters provided two days of market support. Some nice top ticking at the market closes too. But support volume is drying up. Retails clients have been stuffed. Commission cheques are in the mail. Classic Wall Street. What next? Now they are sitting on 12 million shares of inventory and they are just waiting to offload.
Just announced that the dividend is maintained at the present level! Go ARR!
"New 52 week low, and I think new all-time low. Good job, ARR management."
Today was Ex-Div date for ARR. So that is 19 cents of the 53 cent decline today.
Book value is still over $20 a share..
Anyone have thoughts on why the larger than usual drop? Looks like large volume also so far. Thank you in advance
Now they will do another RS removing thousands of shares off the market. Another way to steel money from the shareholders.
Should I just sell this for a 50% loss or just hold forever? I’m certainly never going to buy more of this POS.
The 5 year chart looks great. I'm not sure what chart you are reading. The dividend is solid for the rest of 2019. This was the 1st divi cut in 2 1/2 years
"Anyone have a clue as to why we're getting hammered today, and yesterday, and...? Is it because of the impending interest rate hikes? Almost 10% in the last couple of days. Maybe time to let go of this drain on finances."
25% shareholder dilution in one month! On top of destruction of book value. This has to be a first. No wonder the discussion on class action lawsuits. Check out the exchange with the Ladenburg Thalmann analyst on the Q4 conference call. What a disgrace. There is no non-ETF investor that would buy this stock. At this point it is safe to say that anyone talking up the dividend angle is either company IR or outsourced IR paid to try and prop up the stock for more exercise and sale option activity.
"Waiting for the next Reverse Split ... has been almost 4 years since the last one .. 1 for 8, July 2015 ... sometimes we get unlucky and pick dogs for an investment ... :("
"is there anyone knows why the stock is declining? I don't hear any news, neither good nor bad."

Maybe heading back to $27?
JonesTrading reiterated ARR with Buy and raised price target to $22.50 from $20.
"On March 27, 2020, the Company paid the previously declared cash dividends of $0.17 per share of its common stock and $0.14583 per share of its Series C Preferred Stock.ARMOUR today also announced the declaration of the April 2020 dividend on its Series C Preferred Stock at the rate of $0.14583 per share to holders of record on April 15, 2020, payable on April 27, 2020.ARMOUR will move to a quarterly dividend on its common stock for the second quarter of 2020. ARMOUR’s Board of Directors will evaluate the Company’s results, financial position, real estate investment trust (“REIT”) tax requirements, and overall market conditions as the quarter progresses. The Company expects to announce its decision regarding the amount of second quarter dividends on common stock in the latter part of June 2020 as well as whether the Company will return to its prior monthly dividend policy. By adopting the more conventional policy of announcing quarterly dividends towards the end of the quarter, the Company believes it can maintain greater flexibility and generate increased liquidity. In order to maintain ARMOUR’s tax status as a REIT, the Company is required to timely distribute substantially all of its ordinary REIT taxable income for the tax year."
"ARR 1st quarter net income was $1.03. It greatly does good to its PE and others and has a positive impact on its market price. As inflation is now on the horizon, there is no doubt that the interest rate will be raised, consequently, its net income will be much improved. I am holding ARR long and expect that its market price will soon be over $15.- Watch out. 2021/5/21"
"Comprehensive income over $0.90 per share, and net income over $0.30 per share. It is great news for all shares holders. When the dividend is increased next year, the price will likely exceed $11.-congrats. to all longs. 2020/10/28"
"ARR is a ponzi scheme. Stay away from this stock. Their so call dividend are mostly return of capital; the actual yield is less than 2%. This is why price continue to erode while management charge ridiculous fee and dilute share with periodic stock offering. So many long got burned on the last reverse split.Here is how this ponzi scheme works for the newbies.Fake high yield prop up by Return of Capital to lure in newbies> Public offering of millions shares > price decay > reverse split to prop up and price and reduce share > common holder get destroyed > Rinse and repeat step one.Look at the chart people, look at the chart. This stock used to be 80$ less than a decade ago. Too many shrews and paid pumpers on here. They will undoubted try to get this post remove as well."
Dividend maintained at same level!
That only shows how bad this management team is and they are cashing moneny for running this corporation. Write to IR express how you feel.
How can ARR have negative revenue? Does anyone look at the financials?
RED ALERT - In the latest monthly corporate update the company stopped disclosing its NIM (net interest margin). A massive red flag. That is a critical figure in the business model. What has happened in markets recently? Why 3-month treasury yields have jumped above 5-year treasuries. They must be getting killed on NIM which means cash flow is dropping like a stone which means the dividend is at red alert status. Would you put it past this management? The stock chart says no.
does this mean the dividend will be lowered?
"According to Yahoo, ARR’s book value is $23.48. That’s a 17% discount! Income investors need to pay attention."
"ARR's strategy has never changed. I found out back in 2013.1.

You must have been paying for the stock with all the IR fees the company has been paying you.
"My understanding the 2 qtr was $0.33 per share, whereas the chart by Yahoo shows it as $0.19 per share. it is a huge difference. Would someone come out to correct it the soonest. Thank you. 2020/7/23"
I just purchased 1000 more of ARR and it took ages. They were going through 1 share at a time at current price. I pushed price to 2 cents above ask and it still took 10 minutes and three separate transactions. Not a lot for sale I think
what a surprise. It is up for a part of the day. Not use to seeing green with ARR
Interesting how the price spiked up with the 1pm Treasury auction. Several other reits did as well.
Anyone foresee problems for ARR dividends with the pending home sales dropping 2.2% report today?
"Interesting indeed: Insider ULM SCOTT reports buying 80,000 shares of $ARR for a total cost of $1,434,600.00 https://fintel.io/n/us/arr"
Why did yahoo change their finance site ? every time a website is upgraded it is usually for the worst !
"Everyone seems to forget about March when we were all sure that humanity was gonna be wiped out by Covid. Of course they suspended the Div because who knew if anyone was gonna be able to pay a mortgage. We were all supposed to be dead by now. Now that we’re not...we can get back to normal operations. If you add now and lower your cost basis, you’re gonna get paid 1% a month in a dividend on the new money and if you subscribe to the thought that people will be able to continue to pay their mortgages....the price and the dividend will get back to Pre Corona Virus levels and those of us invested can all retire on some island."
every day arr is having an earnings call. when are they reporting?
"I bought 4000 shares two years back and this stock has been trading within a two dollar range for the most part. I don't even look anymore, just checking it once a month as a sanity check. The 19 cents a month dividend comes in every month so as long as that happens I'm good."
"Meanwhile, ARR is paying $190 a month on 1,000 shares. Next dividend: January 28"
ARR has been a catastrophe for the past 7 years. Today is no different.
"Just did my 5 year numbers. Bought ARR in 2011. Total in at that time, was 500 shares for $3387. The reverse split took that to 62 shares. with 5 years of dividends and based on todays value of $22.67, I am in the red for $396 representing an 11.7% loss over 5 years. That does not take into consideration taxes and reinvestment of dividend elsewhere. This is a purse made of a sows ear."
Is there any chance one of larger institutional holders like BlackRock could take out ARR?Every day headline is NEW 52 WEEK LOW!!!!!!
Share price drops 50%. Company suspends two dividends - then cuts the dividend almost in half (17 cents to 9 cents). Management fees receive no cut. Did I get all that right? This company's thievery continues.
"Insiders have purchased 67,000 in the last 6 months of which half was in Feb 2019"
"Why would I buy this stock, that has lost more than 10% recently, when it only gets that back in a year in dividends... and will probably continue to decline, as it has in the past?"
Handy site for tracking dividends in ARR https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/arr/dividend-history
Book value $20 plus.
Stock price will not rebound to pre crisis levels if monthly dividend is not reinstated.
Can anyone hold management responsible?
All this management team wants is collect as much money as they can with no respect at all for the shareholders.
"in 2009, the equivalent price of ARR was $801. in 2010, it had dropped to $56/share. That is quite a haircut. in 2014 it was $34/ share. Another haircut. Now it is $12.26. Haircut again. Proceed with caution. As long as interest rates stay low, this company will be fine. When they rise, the value of the mortgages will drop, and the price below book discount will disappear.. Good current income, but you cannot put this in a safe and walk away."
We really must applaud ARR management for a job brilliantly well done!
"I day traded my 1k shares for about 100 buck gain, it is not much but hey that is a month worth of dividend "
same dividend .17 per share payable Sept 27.
ARR went from 78 in 2009 to 10 in 2021. Not a good longterm record.
"Due to the TRUMP tax cuts ARR now gets a Section 199A dividend. They may also be listed as ""qualified"" dividends. This means that some of your dividends may be considered tax free. Check your brokerage statements."
Core income exceed dividend paid for the last 12 quarters. Repurchase of shares on schedule. Officers buying and stock reacting with value still over $20.50 per share. THIS BABY IS WORTH RIDDING.  The short sellers are 
Got my monthly Dividend Today. No Liquidity Issues Here.
That was an earnings beat by what.. 4 cents? Not bad.
30% of the B shares are being redeemed Feb. 12 at $25/share plus monthly dividend
Big share buyback plan announced today!
The core income was $0.19 per share whereas the comprehensive income was $0.33 per share. I believe its 2nd quarter total income was $0.33 per share. And it should be shown in the chart as $0.33 Would someone adjust it the soonest. thank you very much 2020./7/23
Moving up nicely
ARR announced improved January Book Value of $21.04 vs $20.84 for December 2019 even after paying out $0.17 dividend!http://www.armourreit.com/Cache/1001260815.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=1001260815&iid=4238544
"On August 1st, 2009, ARR was trading at $78.96."
I guess management was listening and restored the monthly dividend. Reduced yield is fine. It allows a margin of safety in case the crisis takes a turn for the worse. Management can always increase dividend over time as the economy improves.
x date tomorrow
Nice price surge over the past month. Shares still climbing despite the 2-cent dividend cut. Meanwhile still getting a hugepercentage return over bank accounts. Will hold this unless it drops below 18. Then will sell and continue to watch for a move back above 18. Wash rinse repeat. Huge money maker if you pay attention.
keep buy and get that dividend every month
my average on this stock which I have owned for 4+ years is right we are now and I have made over $7000 i'm not sure I would call it crud.
"Funding markets are freezing up. We are about to see what happens to 9.0x levered ARR business that relies on such markets.FYI - Argentina suffered the second largest stock market crash of all time this past week. Their currency is crashing too. It is Latin America so contagion is the historical standard. An interesting way to play this contagion is Brazil and the ultrashort etf BZQ. As of market close today the chart looks technically phenomenal. The stock is at $26 with no resistance until $34.90, $38.04 and $55.76."
"$200 bucks in dividends a month, cost basis of $19. Will gladly hold this until it drops back to break even."
ARR sufferer here . Happy back to monthly dividend but my avg is $15. I don’t own much. Hope to hear from fellow investors if it’s looking good moving Fwd
"Dividend players each month? Lots of price & volume action month to month lately. Aug 14th was ex-dividend date, so not quitesure why such a substantial move today on high volume. Anyone know if there was other news of some kind..."
RED ALERT: Monthly report just out. Leverage increases to 9.3x Book value drops even further to $20.50. June was supposed to be a stabilizing month. The business is broken. Evidence by the dividend increase. Continue to rely on non-arms length entity for 40% or mortgage business. What accounting are they using?
Insiders exercise stock options. May hold for a month or so. Then their selling with resume.
Go ARR!!!
Did ARR not say they were to due buy back? Great Tim to do it and book value over $20 a Share. 
Balyasny will have to blow it out soon. Too much reputation risk having a company that could/likely blow up on the books. Some analyst is getting fired.
Looks like it was a program buy at a critical technical level i.e. before the trap door opens. Better indicator is all the D code transactions in 2019. D code is insider sells to the company. Wasn't the stock good value then? Unthinkable that management raised capital and yet were using some of that cash to fund their insider sales.
"Big selling today just a day after the CEO bought 5,000 shares. Interesting. Still happy with it and in the money as longas we stay above $19. If it falls below, I'm out."
Dividend maintained at .10Good news!
If you want out of ARR check out PEI. You can get 3 shares for every 1 of ARR. That would give you 63 cents every 3 months instead of 51 cents for ARR. They seem to know how to get it done
"I wonder if the Balyasny analyst still has his job.............tick tock.When Hemingway was asked how he went broke he replied ""At first slowly. Then rapidly"""
"Fantastic earnings report!!! ARR can only go way, way up from here."
How Low Can it Go ??
The day after dividends... Low prices and in a month you get large dividends and growth.
"Monthly report just out! As suspected it's a disaster. Book value dropped again and now at an annual run rate of 30% decline. That is why the Price/Book multiple will continue to be rated downward to at least 0.5x. Also, they re-instituted NIM disclosure. Thank you to the IR folks for alerting management that we caught them. Just like we thought NIM is getting killed. Counter parties are raising the cost of financing aggressively. But here is the kicker. They are now at 9.2x levered. Basically management has gone all in with the house in order to salvage the dividend which should have been cut last year. The house always wins."
Going back to $21.
Earnings came in above the avg analysts estimates.. rock and rolll meanwhile the dividend is holding up fine
Is this real estate stock not reflective of real estate prices?
"Different sector but I absolutely hated ring energy oil swaps because even if everything went right and it did with oil prices, they gave away all the up side. Moral of the story is all these people care about is simply protecting their wealth and their own jobs."
"Now I understand. Only the common shareholders are getting f^@#&#. The preferred's are doing just fine. So it seems both the positive and negative comments here are spot on, depending on which you own. If the current price near $16.90 does not hold, look for support at $16.65. If price falls thru $16.65, look out below cause we heading to $16.30 or lower."
Moving up nicely 
"ARR earnings after the close today, conference call tomorrow morning. November dividend will hold steady at .19"
"OMG ... now they make someone Manager of Risk Analysis? You don't need a Manager for that ... I can tell you quite well who is at risk ... it's the Investor, you and I, who is at risk. Just more money thrown out for something we already know ... ARR again at its finest ... !!!"
ARR's price target raised to $22 from $18.
They just bullshitted the stockholders and robbed everyone of us of the April and May dividends. They knew if they would announce suspension of the dividends the stock would crashed. Well it crashed anyway. I’m waiting for my breakeven point then I’m out of here
mREITs obviously not the place to be these days.
earnings today? where's the link to the conference call
"The new effective vaccine, a new high record house sold plus a reliable management team of this co. I have faith that ARR will be back to $17.- in about 6 months."
"not a problem with quarterly dividend. problem will be how much is the dividend. need to payout 90% earning to keep REIT status, but what if no earnings?"
I love it. I keep buying more at any price below 12. You get a 10% yield on your investment with a lot of upside potential as the economy opens up. This is easy investing.
It looks like they are trying to do some good things. They got rid of some debt the A class Pref. I know the books dont show it now but they were paying 19 cents a month per share every month. When your dealing with a lot of money 2% makes a big difference. This is not a big Capital Gains stock. I have said before under 17 I believe is a good entry point if they keep paying dividends.
ARR has announced that its February divis are 10 cents per share......i was hopling for better !!!!!
I'm loving the cycle. I keep using the high yield dividend to buy more and more at a lower price. This in turn gets me more and more dividend income which I continue to buy more shares at a lower price. The yield on this process is amazing.The only people that get hurt in the end are quick buck artists and short sellers.
The company has updated its common share book value as at 11/30/18. It has decreased again to $21.86. If you take this sites Price/Book value multiple of 0.87x the implied value of the common shares is $21.86 x 0.87 = $19.02. Keep in mind this is of end of November and does not include the Powell hike and credit carnage in December.In the meantime the short interest continues to increase despite the current yield.
"While the market soars to new records, mREITs tank.Very disheartening."
"I just got a return email from investor relations. they stated read the April 2, 2020 press release. they are going to quarterly dividend for the 2nd quarter of 2020 and will decide whether to continue. also in the press release they stated they will announce dividend amount toward the end of june. my guess is anything up to .51 (2 * .17). they are an rmbs. I guess it will depend on how much people will default on their mortgage because of lost wages during the corona virus. i've had them since before they did their reverse split. that really hurt. ever since they changed ceo's back then they have been going down. I stayed in and bought on lows trying to recover, but they keep lowering their dividend payout. it helped hearing that up lift from Zack's. but you never know. good luck and let's see what happens in June (?)."
Talk about over sold. I am in.
As far as the dividend goes they should soon be able to afford to bump it up with new investment returns. In the meantime we continue to collect .19. Enough with the gloom and doom Ponzi postings.
will they hold the yield @.10 for nov........smells bad because of the selling and they are doing it a little at a time hit 9.58......check the t and c the last 3 months at the same dates...........
Started building my position today. All agency backed is the place to be in the REIT world imho. Holding AGNC and ARR now. Waiting for NLY to come down a little more and I will consider buying them.
Ex-div date is tomorrow. Why is it dropping like a stone today?
Several REITs have raised their monthly dividends recently and their shares prices are then raised in the market. Hope that ARR will follow.Hope that ARR will follow
"I bought ARR 20k @$10.- and would sell them at about $16.- in about 2 months. If the price stays at $12.- or less, I will hold them for their monthly dividends of about C$1,800.- monthly which is much better than those given by the banks. There is no dobut that ARR is a good co.. good luck to all. Peter 2020.6.9"
"If you want to have a really hearty laugh, take a look at a 10 year chart of ARR."
"For those of you newbys...the only reason you get into reits like ARR is because of the 10% dividends. One day, it will return to a better price. Sit tight... Collect regular dividends."
"ARR +23% since Oct 14 and 1% per mo. divvy. A real life real estate broker frowned on my entry, what was she thinking about? ARR good for decade?"
very thoughtful of the manager to reduce their fees! this allows them to get through this tough time and possibly grow the investment book. probably be moving to 11 cent monthly dividend first half of next year. its trending in the right direction. GLTA
"just luv it now ,2 y worth of dividends and now even above purchased price :)"
What is behind this selloff today?
Now if management could start moving the dividend up to where it was we are cooking with grease!
will they be paying common share dividend for May?
hope they hold $.10 per mo just bought 5000 more bet 9.29 - 9.35
Another great buying opportunity. Silly BZ put out the GAAP earnings and not the publicly accepted core earnings. Scared the lambs out and helped the MM push it down. I bought more at a current yield of 11.5%. Easy investing. I like the $.10 per share dividend every month.
"According to Yahoo, ARR’s book value is now $24.40 after latest earnings report."
Bought 1000 shares to start my first dividend Income investment ￼
Buypack 25$. And no more dividend ! Need to sell in July
"Dear Investors,The trolls are going to try and discredit the information I posted earlier. Other than my current ARR position, which is protected by my broker (so you'll have to take my word for it), the information on dividend changes and stock splits is publicly available. Remember that dividend information already takes into account the reverse split. You don't have to calculate it. I downloaded the information from my broker's web site, but you can find it anywhere. I'm done for the day. Thank you for your time."
Why the clocking today? Down sharply for it
Too many negative posters on here makes me believe they are shorting ARR.
"Although it took a huge hit in March 2020, this REIT has been steadily climbing and paying good dividends for many months now. I see no reason for this to stop. Getting a 10+% dividend while the share price keeps climbing back towards 20 seems like a no brainer. But with my luck, now that I posted this, it will start trending back down. lol"
"Great stock? Are you kidding me? You look for stock price and dividend appreciation and you get neither from this stock or from pretty much every REIT for that matter, check NLY and AGNC. They've all been through bulls and bears, yet nothing goes up. If you tell me REITs will start appreciating in price and dividends from now on, I won't believe you. You're better off dripping MO or XOM or T for long term."
I think they need to pay us .09/sh. for April and May then. What are they trying to pull here? Don't get me wrong I would rather have a monthly dividend rather than quarterly even at a reduced rate but 0 for the last 2 months doesn't fly either.
"This site states that book value per share is $23.83. That includes the preferred shares. A common share owner needs to value it off book value excluding the preferred shares. That figure is $22.42. So if this site states that the stock is trading at 0.9x book value than the implied value is actually $22.42 x 0.9x = $20.17A case can be made that the 0.9x should be lower as the spread continues to be pressured lower and book value continues to decline.In the meantime, the market seems to be sending a message. The stock yields 10.5% yet the short float is 12.5% and rising. On a high yielding stock that is alot of conviction."
Does anyone know when they will make the decision on the divi?I didn't see anything in the earnings report.
Correction: dividend decrease. The dividend is decreasing.
"National Home Price Index rolling over. Approximately 50% of repo transactions are with a non-arms length entity, Buckler Securities. What is underneath that hood? Can't be good if the street has no desire to be a counterparty to ARR. Maybe its the 8.8x leverage. The market seems to finally be sniffing this out. Hitting all time lows!"
REIT shares are coming back to their highs soon. Hold them tightly especially ARR.2020/12/4
Issue stock one month. Repurchase stock next month. An absolute s...show. Insider purchases in the last month equate to a cup of coffee and subway ticket. Big sellers of the years. The big story is that the cash they raised is not being used to purchase mortgage bond assets. No good opportunities. So what does that say about the prospects of their current book? Very troubling considering that weak book is 8.8x levered!
"Actually GAAP does matter. ARR's business model is built on a severely leveraged business with razor thin profit margins. So management requires a large derivative book to protect against disaster. When the derivative books declines that translates to lower GAAP values or book value. That is their business model. Also, FYI higher asset yields is a result of declining assets in the portfolio. That is not a good thing. Horrific research report."
"As a shareholder of ARR, I am much confused with co""s recent declaration. It claimed that for the 1st quarter of 2021, the comprehensive income is $0.40 per share, the core income is $0.23 whereas the total net income is $1.03 per share. What a big difference and misleading! Can our CEO come out to clarify it?If the net income is C$1.03 per share, then the share price would be much different then. 2012/4/24 peter"
Maybe they raise the dividend. Need too !
It's quite rare to see a management team raise equity off a severely beaten down stock price and further dilute equity common equity holders.A very negative signal about the future.Cashing up to try and protect the dividend?
I have been swapping out my speculative stocks for monthly dividend payers since January as a way to take cash out of the market and its working very well. Cash pile is growing but I am still in the game lol
Thinking about jumping in on the IRA and holding long term. Dividend still paying out monthly? Thoughts on price at this point..
"ARMOUR's stockholders' equity totaled $1,109 million, including:Common stock outstanding of 83,098,691 shares, and7.00% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred C Stock (""Series C Preferred Stock"") with liquidation preference totaling approximately $171 million.ARMOUR's book value per common share was $11.28 per share.ARMOUR's liquidity, including cash and unencumbered agency and U.S. government securities, was $832 million.ARMOUR's portfolio composition was 100% Agency mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), including To Be Announced (""TBA"") Securities.ARMOUR's debt to equity ratio was 3.6 to 1 (based on repurchase agreements divided by stockholders’ equity).

Hopefully the company will use some of that cash to buy back stock today...ha ha!!!
This thing is about to fly
