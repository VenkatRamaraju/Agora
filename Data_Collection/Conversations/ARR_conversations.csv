"Earnings are out, the earnings seem to be in line with the expectations ($0.25 per share), but let's wait for conference call tomorrow."
You lost 13% since April 26th. How is that for wise investing? 
"ARR PEAKED IN mAY AND oCT 23 THEY WILL MISS EARNINGS FOR THE 4TH TIME IN A ROW. They are paying 10 cent dividends out of thin air. ARR is down 9.08% since feb 17, 2021. Do your diligence. $REML"
Thereâ€™s +6% short interest in this stock. Am I reading this right? Seems like a lousy bet on a stock to go down when it pays an 11% divy every month that you will be responsible for.
buy it now before it's not affordable!
it is at a loss Q3?
Any thoughts as to why this is tanking today?
2022 will dividends increase?
Pre market looks good
what a surprise. It is up for a part of the day. Not use to seeing green with ARR
"This LQQKS (eyes rolling) 2 good 2 be 4 real. Will study this while loading up on a couple of solid 8 percenters (OCSL,OHI). I expect the dividend to be cut 'round 13%. 2 tempted 2 buy 2 much. Hopefully (as in impending DOOM), this will work out OK and I'll learn a thing or 2 or 3 or 4."
"Comprehensive income over $0.90 per share, and net income over $0.30 per share. It is great news for all shares holders. When the dividend is increased next year, the price will likely exceed $11.-congrats. to all longs. 2020/10/28"
how is this compard to say nymt.mfa irv or wmc thanks
Can we reach $11.00 today
Today's 8-k gives a book value of roughly 11.09. How does that seem to long time holders. Also seems to show an increase in net interest margin coming. Anything else of note?
"Beating earnings is not important. Sure, it is all that matters to technology companies,etc. But this is a income stock. A cash cow giving off that delicious dividend milk each month. Income stocks get graded PASS / FAIL . As long as income covers expenses and our dividends, they pass! NO money to pay us? That is a FAIL, When I go looking for new income stocks, first thing I look at are earnings and the dividend amount. If they earn more than their dividend, I keep reading. If not, look elsewhere."
Looking at investing. Can anyone tell me if ARR stands to gain from the rising 10 year yield? I know their share price fell as rates fell.
What does this pay monthly per share?
Picked up 170 more !
when the Q3 report comes
