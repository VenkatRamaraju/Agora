Bought 1000 shares to start my first dividend Income investment ￼
when the Q3 report comes
Going back to $21.
Can anyone hold management responsible?
"ARMOUR Residential REIT resumes monthly dividend of $0.09.ARMOUR Residential REIT (NYSE:ARR) declares $0.09/share monthly dividend, -47.1% decrease from prior dividend of $0.17."
"Same underwriters, brokerages , banks, who are in dealing with public offering with more shares month after month, are giving high bullish ranking of 7.3 on equity summary score for years. Go figure. No wonder people are losing trusts on such company. History is lesson. Look 10 years"
Pre market looks good
Share price drops 50%. Company suspends two dividends - then cuts the dividend almost in half (17 cents to 9 cents). Management fees receive no cut. Did I get all that right? This company's thievery continues.
Interesting how the price spiked up with the 1pm Treasury auction. Several other reits did as well.
Is the dividend safe at this level? I am planing to buy 200 shares tomorrow. Comments?
ARR on a nice uptrend! Let's hope it continues!
Core income exceed dividend paid for the last 12 quarters. Repurchase of shares on schedule. Officers buying and stock reacting with value still over $20.50 per share. THIS BABY IS WORTH RIDDING.  The short sellers are 
With $0.09 div per month ($1.08 p.yr) @ $8.20 we get 13%. Should ARR regain confidence perhaps 8% could be sufficient==> which gives $13-$13.50 as a target.When 10% yield is wanted==> $10.80 is the target.Not selling this... maybe buy more in weakness....
"Actually GAAP does matter. ARR's business model is built on a severely leveraged business with razor thin profit margins. So management requires a large derivative book to protect against disaster. When the derivative books declines that translates to lower GAAP values or book value. That is their business model. Also, FYI higher asset yields is a result of declining assets in the portfolio. That is not a good thing. Horrific research report."
ARR went from 78 in 2009 to 10 in 2021. Not a good longterm record.
"Earnings are out, the earnings seem to be in line with the expectations ($0.25 per share), but let's wait for conference call tomorrow."
Why the clocking today? Down sharply for it
"Thanks to the inventory of the vaccine. We are now closed to the end of the tunnel.Hold on your ARR, it will run fast and high pretty soon."
"This may not have an impact, but write to IR anyway to express your frustration about this management team."
ARR sufferer here . Happy back to monthly dividend but my avg is $15. I don’t own much. Hope to hear from fellow investors if it’s looking good moving Fwd
Picked up 170 more !
buy it now before it's not affordable!
"On August 1st, 2009, ARR was trading at $78.96."
"ARR PEAKED IN mAY AND oCT 23 THEY WILL MISS EARNINGS FOR THE 4TH TIME IN A ROW. They are paying 10 cent dividends out of thin air. ARR is down 9.08% since feb 17, 2021. Do your diligence. $REML"
"I don't understand why this preferred isn't trading higher, especially since everyone is seeking yield. The preferred C pays 7% at the call price of $25.00. Unless the company goes bankrupt, the preferred will get paid and the dividend is cumulative. If it gets called, the shares are paid off at $25 each. So at the current $18.87 closing price, there is tons of upside. So why not buy this up and enjoy the dividends. I own over 15,000 shares."
"not a problem with quarterly dividend. problem will be how much is the dividend. need to payout 90% earning to keep REIT status, but what if no earnings?"
I love it. I keep buying more at any price below 12. You get a 10% yield on your investment with a lot of upside potential as the economy opens up. This is easy investing.
A mighty fine chart last few months. What do you guys think of earnings just in?
2022 will dividends increase?
"Dear Investors,The trolls are going to try and discredit the information I posted earlier. Other than my current ARR position, which is protected by my broker (so you'll have to take my word for it), the information on dividend changes and stock splits is publicly available. Remember that dividend information already takes into account the reverse split. You don't have to calculate it. I downloaded the information from my broker's web site, but you can find it anywhere. I'm done for the day. Thank you for your time."
"I wonder if the Balyasny analyst still has his job.............tick tock.When Hemingway was asked how he went broke he replied ""At first slowly. Then rapidly"""
"Fred is right , insider selling by CEO jeffry Zimmer . The CEO of the company ARR sold 400000 shates at an average price of $10.57 . This is 25% of his total shares which is major . But in spite of that it did not cause the share price to go down but it actually went up ........!!!!!!!!!!! and that is a good sign !!I believe we are heading back to $20 , i only hope that they will increase the dividend gradually back to 19 cents ...............Merry holidays and may it be a good new year for ARR and its dividend ."
RED ALERT - In the latest monthly corporate update the company stopped disclosing its NIM (net interest margin). A massive red flag. That is a critical figure in the business model. What has happened in markets recently? Why 3-month treasury yields have jumped above 5-year treasuries. They must be getting killed on NIM which means cash flow is dropping like a stone which means the dividend is at red alert status. Would you put it past this management? The stock chart says no.
"Interesting indeed: Insider ULM SCOTT reports buying 80,000 shares of $ARR for a total cost of $1,434,600.00 https://fintel.io/n/us/arr"
We really must applaud ARR management for a job brilliantly well done!
"This LQQKS (eyes rolling) 2 good 2 be 4 real. Will study this while loading up on a couple of solid 8 percenters (OCSL,OHI). I expect the dividend to be cut 'round 13%. 2 tempted 2 buy 2 much. Hopefully (as in impending DOOM), this will work out OK and I'll learn a thing or 2 or 3 or 4."
Another great buying opportunity. Silly BZ put out the GAAP earnings and not the publicly accepted core earnings. Scared the lambs out and helped the MM push it down. I bought more at a current yield of 11.5%. Easy investing. I like the $.10 per share dividend every month.
"For those of you newbys...the only reason you get into reits like ARR is because of the 10% dividends. One day, it will return to a better price. Sit tight... Collect regular dividends."
Thinking about jumping in on the IRA and holding long term. Dividend still paying out monthly? Thoughts on price at this point..
"ARR 1st quarter net income was $1.03. It greatly does good to its PE and others and has a positive impact on its market price. As inflation is now on the horizon, there is no doubt that the interest rate will be raised, consequently, its net income will be much improved. I am holding ARR long and expect that its market price will soon be over $15.- Watch out. 2021/5/21"
Hopefully the company will use some of that cash to buy back stock today...ha ha!!!
ARR's price target raised to $22 from $18.
They just bullshitted the stockholders and robbed everyone of us of the April and May dividends. They knew if they would announce suspension of the dividends the stock would crashed. Well it crashed anyway. I’m waiting for my breakeven point then I’m out of here
JonesTrading reiterated ARR with Buy and raised price target to $22.50 from $20.
Has their been a dividend cut? (Asking in case I missed news of one)
ARR announced improved January Book Value of $21.04 vs $20.84 for December 2019 even after paying out $0.17 dividend!http://www.armourreit.com/Cache/1001260815.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=1001260815&iid=4238544
Looking at investing. Can anyone tell me if ARR stands to gain from the rising 10 year yield? I know their share price fell as rates fell.
it is at a loss Q3?
Were results actually released? I'm struggling to find any info including on their website.
Just announced that the dividend is maintained at the present level! Go ARR!
Wow I see the Wolf of Wall Street IR boys were prepared ahead of time for this one.This disaster gets bigger. GAAP income a massive loss which shows business model hanging on the edge. Dividend propped up by increasing leverage even further. Now at 9.7x!
Substantial stock buyback program by ARR board... We're still well below book value which is around $20
some more book value growth will bring the value hunters back
"Insiders have purchased 67,000 in the last 6 months of which half was in Feb 2019"
Earnings came in above the avg analysts estimates.. rock and rolll meanwhile the dividend is holding up fine
"in 2009, the equivalent price of ARR was $801. in 2010, it had dropped to $56/share. That is quite a haircut. in 2014 it was $34/ share. Another haircut. Now it is $12.26. Haircut again. Proceed with caution. As long as interest rates stay low, this company will be fine. When they rise, the value of the mortgages will drop, and the price below book discount will disappear.. Good current income, but you cannot put this in a safe and walk away."
"ARMOUR's stockholders' equity totaled $1,109 million, including:Common stock outstanding of 83,098,691 shares, and7.00% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred C Stock (""Series C Preferred Stock"") with liquidation preference totaling approximately $171 million.ARMOUR's book value per common share was $11.28 per share.ARMOUR's liquidity, including cash and unencumbered agency and U.S. government securities, was $832 million.ARMOUR's portfolio composition was 100% Agency mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), including To Be Announced (""TBA"") Securities.ARMOUR's debt to equity ratio was 3.6 to 1 (based on repurchase agreements divided by stockholders’ equity). Leverage, including TBA Securities, was approximately 6.7 to 1.Q2 2021 HighlightsARMOUR issued 13,290,759 shares of its common stock through its at the market offering programs, raising $159.3 million of capital after fees and expenses, which was accretive to book value.ARMOUR Comprehensive loss of $(61.3) million, or $(0.85) per common share, which represents an annualized return of (24)% based on stockholders' equity at the beginning of the quarter.ARMOUR Net interest income of $16.7 million.ARMOUR Core Income (see explanation of non-GAAP measures on page 2) of $18.9 million which represents $0.21 per common share.ARMOUR paid common stock dividends of $0.10 per share per month."
I want my monthly dividends back
Today was Ex-Div date for ARR. So that is 19 cents of the 53 cent decline today.
"So ARR in essence skipped the April & May dividends and will pay a June dividend that is about half of the previous (jan - march) monthly dividends. Is that about right? If so, that is not very good."
"Dividend players each month? Lots of price & volume action month to month lately. Aug 14th was ex-dividend date, so not quitesure why such a substantial move today on high volume. Anyone know if there was other news of some kind..."
"I bought ARR 20k @$10.- and would sell them at about $16.- in about 2 months. If the price stays at $12.- or less, I will hold them for their monthly dividends of about C$1,800.- monthly which is much better than those given by the banks. There is no dobut that ARR is a good co.. good luck to all. Peter 2020.6.9"
"Monthly report just out! As suspected it's a disaster. Book value dropped again and now at an annual run rate of 30% decline. That is why the Price/Book multiple will continue to be rated downward to at least 0.5x. Also, they re-instituted NIM disclosure. Thank you to the IR folks for alerting management that we caught them. Just like we thought NIM is getting killed. Counter parties are raising the cost of financing aggressively. But here is the kicker. They are now at 9.2x levered. Basically management has gone all in with the house in order to salvage the dividend which should have been cut last year. The house always wins."
The core income was $0.19 per share whereas the comprehensive income was $0.33 per share. I believe its 2nd quarter total income was $0.33 per share. And it should be shown in the chart as $0.33 Would someone adjust it the soonest. thank you very much 2020./7/23
"Happy One Year Anniversary. July 29, 2018 ARR stock price was $23.66. After lower interest rates and a new stock buyback program that the stock went up, right? No. Down 23.7%. If that is how it performs in the good times what should we expect for July 29, 2020?"
"The new effective vaccine, a new high record house sold plus a reliable management team of this co. I have faith that ARR will be back to $17.- in about 6 months."
Nice move up this week on moderate volume. Meanwhile those dividends just keep rolling in and the housing market is doing well to boot.
very thoughtful of the manager to reduce their fees! this allows them to get through this tough time and possibly grow the investment book. probably be moving to 11 cent monthly dividend first half of next year. its trending in the right direction. GLTA
"Big selling today just a day after the CEO bought 5,000 shares. Interesting. Still happy with it and in the money as longas we stay above $19. If it falls below, I'm out."
Started building my position today. All agency backed is the place to be in the REIT world imho. Holding AGNC and ARR now. Waiting for NLY to come down a little more and I will consider buying them.
"at least they bought back some shares$35.9 million ($0.55 per Common share) Core Income including “Drop Income” (as defined below), which represents an annualized return of 10.4% based on stockholders’ equity at the beginning of the quarter$0.51 per Common share dividends for Q3 at the rate of $0.17 per monthCore Income exceeded dividends paid for the thirteenth straight quarter330,000 Common shares repurchased; current remaining repurchase authorization of 8,295,000 shares"
"I must say I am confused. ARR has Preferred A and B shares paying a great dividend. Plus, you get more protection with the preferred. The company should be buying back the Preferred instead of issuing more stock. So, you sell more stock to pay the dividend on the stock and Preferred you then pay more dividends on the new issue of stock. Makes no sense at all, if you want to be in this stock at least get into the Prefferreds."
Today's 8-k gives a book value of roughly 11.09. How does that seem to long time holders. Also seems to show an increase in net interest margin coming. Anything else of note?
I have been swapping out my speculative stocks for monthly dividend payers since January as a way to take cash out of the market and its working very well. Cash pile is growing but I am still in the game lol
Loving the price climb since May. Hope that climb continues and maybe we will also get lucky and get a dividend increase sometime this year. But 10% not too bad in today's environment.
"As a shareholder of ARR, I am much confused with co""s recent declaration. It claimed that for the 1st quarter of 2021, the comprehensive income is $0.40 per share, the core income is $0.23 whereas the total net income is $1.03 per share. What a big difference and misleading! Can our CEO come out to clarify it?If the net income is C$1.03 per share, then the share price would be much different then. 2012/4/24 peter"
"Although it took a huge hit in March 2020, this REIT has been steadily climbing and paying good dividends for many months now. I see no reason for this to stop. Getting a 10+% dividend while the share price keeps climbing back towards 20 seems like a no brainer. But with my luck, now that I posted this, it will start trending back down. lol"
"If you want to have a really hearty laugh, take a look at a 10 year chart of ARR."
That only shows how bad this management team is and they are cashing moneny for running this corporation. Write to IR express how you feel.
25% shareholder dilution in one month! On top of destruction of book value. This has to be a first. No wonder the discussion on class action lawsuits. Check out the exchange with the Ladenburg Thalmann analyst on the Q4 conference call. What a disgrace. There is no non-ETF investor that would buy this stock. At this point it is safe to say that anyone talking up the dividend angle is either company IR or outsourced IR paid to try and prop up the stock for more exercise and sale option activity.
how is this compard to say nymt.mfa irv or wmc thanks
All this management team wants is collect as much money as they can with no respect at all for the shareholders.
You lost 13% since April 26th. How is that for wise investing? 
Whoever it was that gave ARR a shot of Tequila today ... thank you ... !! :)
July 2009 stock was around $80 share . The dividend has been a trick for managers to take your $$$$ . Nobody prosecuted nothing said .
Can we reach $11.00 today
At the very bottom of the press release they disclose the monthly dividend has been reduced to $0.17 from $0.19. It's started. Only a matter of time before the entire dividend is wiped out.Why redeem the Series A prefs? Because those prefs have activist rights and can force liquidation to protect their capital. Hard to say which side initiated this move but for management it seems to be a temporary stay of execution.Corporate governance wise another disgrace. Raise common share equity to make the prefs whole. What a fabulous use of proceeds for all those common shares investors that bought the deals. Disgraceful.
OMG ... didn't ARR just complete an offering of 6 mil shares last month? And here comes another one for another 6 mil? What kind of BS company is this? I guess we now have a good idea why management keeps selling shares ... just a matter of time before ARR implodes ... !!
"just luv it now ,2 y worth of dividends and now even above purchased price :)"
"They issued lot of stocks at higher prices and share price went down. Now cutting common share dividends again, it may go down by further diluting price. Is this reason for repurchase of common shares? Will SEC look into this company? Any idea?"
Ex-Dividend day... so sellers are here... actually not a bad time to buy on this dip.
"New 52 week low, and I think new all-time low. Good job, ARR management."
Moving up nicely 
Wow great results stock popping after hours
30% of the B shares are being redeemed Feb. 12 at $25/share plus monthly dividend
"Quarterly loss $2.21 as per news-- 4/24/2019. Still pays 19 cents/mo., 11.32%. Another stock offering will come as usual? Need to check history. Can anyone explain how they do ?"
Should I just sell this for a 50% loss or just hold forever? I’m certainly never going to buy more of this POS.
"These guys should all be fired. How can they still be running this REIT?James Robert MountainARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. - CFO, Treasurer & Secretary* Jeffrey J. ZimmerARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. - Co-CEO, Co-Vice Chairman & President* Scott J. UlmARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. - Co-CEO, Co-Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer"
"ARR +23% since Oct 14 and 1% per mo. divvy. A real life real estate broker frowned on my entry, what was she thinking about? ARR good for decade?"
"According to Yahoo, ARR’s book value is now $24.40 after latest earnings report."
Several REITs have raised their monthly dividends recently and their shares prices are then raised in the market. Hope that ARR will follow.Hope that ARR will follow
"Due to the TRUMP tax cuts ARR now gets a Section 199A dividend. They may also be listed as ""qualified"" dividends. This means that some of your dividends may be considered tax free. Check your brokerage statements."
"“We’re in the business that we’re in, we aren’t going to completely stop buying mortgages, we understand the need to pay out that dividend.” Really the way this was said on the call was like a punch in the gut."
Omg. Closed $11.00.
Looks like firm footing after EX-Div today. Perhaps this will continue. It's nice to see for a change ... :)
Looks like it was a program buy at a critical technical level i.e. before the trap door opens. Better indicator is all the D code transactions in 2019. D code is insider sells to the company. Wasn't the stock good value then? Unthinkable that management raised capital and yet were using some of that cash to fund their insider sales.
I'm glad I didn't let my broker talk me out of buying this when it was 16.35/sh.. I'm in for the long term and will enjoy the income this produces...no worries...
"Beating earnings is not important. Sure, it is all that matters to technology companies,etc. But this is a income stock. A cash cow giving off that delicious dividend milk each month. Income stocks get graded PASS / FAIL . As long as income covers expenses and our dividends, they pass! NO money to pay us? That is a FAIL, When I go looking for new income stocks, first thing I look at are earnings and the dividend amount. If they earn more than their dividend, I keep reading. If not, look elsewhere."
It looks like they are trying to do some good things. They got rid of some debt the A class Pref. I know the books dont show it now but they were paying 19 cents a month per share every month. When your dealing with a lot of money 2% makes a big difference. This is not a big Capital Gains stock. I have said before under 17 I believe is a good entry point if they keep paying dividends.
If you want out of ARR check out PEI. You can get 3 shares for every 1 of ARR. That would give you 63 cents every 3 months instead of 51 cents for ARR. They seem to know how to get it done
"Comprehensive income over $0.90 per share, and net income over $0.30 per share. It is great news for all shares holders. When the dividend is increased next year, the price will likely exceed $11.-congrats. to all longs. 2020/10/28"
keep buy and get that dividend every month
hope they hold $.10 per mo just bought 5000 more bet 9.29 - 9.35
"I just got a return email from investor relations. they stated read the April 2, 2020 press release. they are going to quarterly dividend for the 2nd quarter of 2020 and will decide whether to continue. also in the press release they stated they will announce dividend amount toward the end of june. my guess is anything up to .51 (2 * .17). they are an rmbs. I guess it will depend on how much people will default on their mortgage because of lost wages during the corona virus. i've had them since before they did their reverse split. that really hurt. ever since they changed ceo's back then they have been going down. I stayed in and bought on lows trying to recover, but they keep lowering their dividend payout. it helped hearing that up lift from Zack's. but you never know. good luck and let's see what happens in June (?)."
This held up pretty well today all things considered. Eventually traders will begin to realize that higher interest because of a booming economy is also good for REIT's providing that the yield spread begins to widen a bit. I'm looking for the 30 year treasuries to climb.
"Meanwhile, ARR is paying $190 a month on 1,000 shares. Next dividend: January 28"
"According to Yahoo, ARR’s book value is $23.48. That’s a 17% discount! Income investors need to pay attention."
"Um, this is a really, really bad stock, in case anyone needed a reminder."
I guess management was listening and restored the monthly dividend. Reduced yield is fine. It allows a margin of safety in case the crisis takes a turn for the worse. Management can always increase dividend over time as the economy improves.
why is ZACKs Still saying its a good stock
what a surprise. It is up for a part of the day. Not use to seeing green with ARR
How HIGH can it go ?
What does this pay monthly per share?
"On March 27, 2020, the Company paid the previously declared cash dividends of $0.17 per share of its common stock and $0.14583 per share of its Series C Preferred Stock.ARMOUR today also announced the declaration of the April 2020 dividend on its Series C Preferred Stock at the rate of $0.14583 per share to holders of record on April 15, 2020, payable on April 27, 2020.ARMOUR will move to a quarterly dividend on its common stock for the second quarter of 2020. ARMOUR’s Board of Directors will evaluate the Company’s results, financial position, real estate investment trust (“REIT”) tax requirements, and overall market conditions as the quarter progresses. The Company expects to announce its decision regarding the amount of second quarter dividends on common stock in the latter part of June 2020 as well as whether the Company will return to its prior monthly dividend policy. By adopting the more conventional policy of announcing quarterly dividends towards the end of the quarter, the Company believes it can maintain greater flexibility and generate increased liquidity. In order to maintain ARMOUR’s tax status as a REIT, the Company is required to timely distribute substantially all of its ordinary REIT taxable income for the tax year."
"ARR's strategy has never changed. I found out back in 2013.1. Issue more secondary stock offerings: * Feb. 19, 2019 public offering of 7,200,000 shares of common * June 26, 2017 public offering of 4,500,000 shares of common stock * January 10, 2012 secondary offering of 9 million shares.2. Lose money3. Cut the dividend4. Do a reverse stock split.5. repeat the process"
Maybe they raise the dividend. Need too !
There’s +6% short interest in this stock. Am I reading this right? Seems like a lousy bet on a stock to go down when it pays an 11% divy every month that you will be responsible for.
Any thoughts as to why this is tanking today?
The 5 year chart looks great. I'm not sure what chart you are reading. The dividend is solid for the rest of 2019. This was the 1st divi cut in 2 1/2 years
This thing is about to fly
"Tue, 02/26/2019 - 09:05 - US Home Price Growth Weakest Since 2012 - US home price growth has slowed for nine straight months - up just 4.18% YoY - the weakest since Sept 2012, according to S&P Case-Shiller's 20-City Composite index. But forget the fundamentals. Its the corporate governance that has now created a real problem for the underwriters and the ETFs that are stuffing retail clients with this stock."
Dividend INCREASE of 11%!!!
what about April and may dividend??? just like when they did the 4 to 1 split a while back. that money for those 2 months just didn't disappear. the covid damage shouldn't be felt until months later when they see who's paying the mortgages.
Monthly report out. Cost of funding has increased again. Canary in the coal mine especially for a business that has 80% of assets tied to short terms repo financing agreements. We have seen this movie before. Higher funding costs eventually lead to forced repo unwind which then leads to distressed selling and forced sales of the mortgage bond portfolio. The canary is heaving.
Quite bearish for the stock to be down on a big up day for market. The underwriters still have 11 million shares to offload post financing.
I'm loving the cycle. I keep using the high yield dividend to buy more and more at a lower price. This in turn gets me more and more dividend income which I continue to buy more shares at a lower price. The yield on this process is amazing.The only people that get hurt in the end are quick buck artists and short sellers.
FED starting new program called PDCF (Primary Dealer Credit Facility) on Friday which buys all types of paper including mortgage backed securities that mREITs leverage to make money. mREITs should begin to move back up.
Now if management could start moving the dividend up to where it was we are cooking with grease!
More people are coming out and business is getting better these days. Hope that dividend can beraised next month.
Maybe heading back to $27?
