So many bullish articles about SOFI have been written lately.
Thoughts of weekly $15.50 call?
Way more upside than down....You can never catch the bottom exactly....In for 1500 more shares at $14.00
Biggest run up starting now!
In one year's time people will realize this is selling at bargain price
Buckle up
Institutions have been loading up. They dont all buy at once. This is not a meme. Bank charter will surge it to 30+ it is not priced in.
"If we go back to high 13's, I am doubling my position. This is like buying Paypal at 14. This will make a lot of people very wealthy."
"Should see gains for the next few months , up to the 17's. then we wait for all the great news that Sofi delivers after that!"
"Hope all Sofi investors are customers, I am. I made money by joining. Now I'm waiting to transfer my Robinhood investments to Sofi, Can't do it til I make big, using Margin. Sofi is working on that also! Just a matter of time this becomes one of the biggest companies on earth!"
Hey SOFI Fam.insider transaction form 4 filed with SEC. purchased 7500 shares on 8/19
A lot of 14.5 and 15 call options expire today so don’t expect much movement. Price is being managed.
"Run SoFi, RUN!"
"Noto IS BUYING TO SAVE HIS CONSCIENCE!! He knows the insiders are destroying the unconnected, in the way they all jumped ship from a spac process that kept everything hidden. Could never get info on lockup periods, This was theft by a system rigged against the casual investor. only saving grace now is that they succeed before the world ends or the stock market plunges. TIME is the only saving grace for us now, they manipulated and stole\cheated the average stock holder and believers in their company like has happened very few times in the way it has happened to us this time!! This isn't just a bad pick in stock, this was a system that allowed a company to hook then sink a lot of people!!"
When individuals sell in fearInstitutional ownership jumped from 3% to almost 8%.(Source – Fintel)
well I missed the big dip but this is still a dip I'm in for 20k
I am a member and I like the stock. If only half of the Sofi members invest approximately $10k (600 shares)each in this stock and hold long term the price will double in less than a week.
It's comical people bashing SoFi for not moving daily. Just wait for milestone markers like the bank charter to come through or not. Day to day is just sentiment that can go either way... and I'll second Wall St that I saw the exact same bashing of square for months before it became a darling... it's amazing how identical the story is leading up to the charter.
Some day this will be added to the S&P 500
Just curious cause does anyone do their investing through Sofi?
"I've been very bullish on $AFRM and $SOFI for a few months as they both have been gaining market share at various websites I'd visit. So the $AMZN partnership announcement on Friday was no surprise. I sold my $AFRM over $100 this morning for over 45% gain and moving it to $SOFI and adding even more shares of $JWN under 29....Nordstrom will be back above 38 in the short term in no time. I have also added more shares to $ADSK, which I expect to be back above 340 also in the short term.Keep buying $JWN, $ADSK, $SOFI. Keep holding."
"THE most frustrating stock in my portfolio. Better off putting my money into an old fashioned savings account making 0.05%. At least I'd be making money each day. Instead I bought into this turd and the hype and continue to bleed out slowly day after day. Would be really nice to see strong green momentum, rather than being down 1-3% on a no news day when the market is green."
"Finally green, alright!"
We are up 0.01 
Being copied by PayPal. Will need to merge to compete. Takeout candidate.
"When market green we are red, eventually when market is red we are more red"
Take a look at $ARKF holdings SOFI shareholders will see a nice surprise!
Noto has bought 7150 shares 3 days in a row. Will tomorrow be number 4?
Added another $4k at $14.17 today. Can see past the short term volatility.
Can’t wait too see the OG’s in the chat in a few years making Bank 
The warrant is approaching the October exercise date. The warrant is indicating the stock should be trading above $16 today. The stock needs to be trading above $18 by October 14 for the company to call the warrants.
Lower volume on a down tape. I am guessing this will hang around $14.50 all day.
Institutions currently own 14.31%. Institutional ownership in SoFi quadrupled after Q2 ER.
"After use sofi, I am in process to change my bank account to sofi. Good app"
"Today could be the last days for buying shares below $14. Per Fidelity, ~40% of the shares being held by institutions and 15% by insiders. Less volatility and panic selling by weak hands in the days ahead. Do not sweat the daily moves, stick with the long-term picture here. GL."
Buy and you shall be rewarded 
SoFi selling at 50% of peak price and its growth story hasn't changed. Buy!
Guys guys guys...this was expected that Sofi will have rough week as lock up period ended this week. Relax. Wait few more weeks.
Sofi or $PSFE it's hard to decide which to splurge on more.
I’m still upside down but holding strong.
"Ok I’m sitting on 10,000 shares of sofi, and 30,000 shares of wish. Down 20 percent or so on both but my opinion not bad. Looking for 150-200 sofi 100.00 wish, timeline, 2/3/4/5 years. Opinions? Is this possible? I’m not a expert trader full disclosure, but the growth potential to me sounds amazing"
"SOFI has the momentum to keep pushing, small fish selling big fish buying, this is almost ready to pop"
"According Ortex, short interest change +74.92% today Shorts are coming in hard! Dont let them scare you!"
Just another day of a transitory dip. I’m still happy with my $15 position.See you guys tomorrow for a greener day. Cheers.
Doubled my position today. Looking forward to a boost in stock price soon.
Options manipulation?
The lockup is washed out at this level..... it is ready to wash more out at a higher price now! With some growth news.... this thing will blow up! Not if... Just when?
"Technicals looking good, moving into strength. We are on our way to fill the gap from earnings. Stay long my friends...."
One morning we're all going to wake up and this baby is going to be 25+....
"Here is a clue for you Vansmack. If the insiders are buying in mass news is coming and they all know something you don't LOL,LOL,LOL . Tell you are now running out of time to cover than short position and the last thing you want to be is short when the news come out"
GROUND FLOOR OPPURTUNITY!
"Although I think SOFI has carved out a good market niche, I am disappointed by the SP -I expected much more ... might be best if they get taken out by one of the big banks"
Anthony Noto just bought the dip again today.
"Bank charter would take it instantly to 45-48 range and then as they capture market share from other banks, 100 is easily doable in 2 quarters"
"Bank Charter, will reduce the cost 9f loans originations. Will increase, thereby profit margins.Will also increase deposits. Bank Charter will be a huge boost in profitability. Those ,who are buying at this level will be hugely rewarded, in time.Those who are selling will be kicking themselves lol"
"I believe in Sofi’s future, will hold my shares for 2 years."

Last chance to get in under $15 starts today!
"SoFi Technologies CEO buys 7,150 shares of common stockIn a regulatory filing, SoFi Technologies disclosed that its CEO Anthony Noto bought 7,150 share of common stock on August 17th"
I don't plan to sell my shares until the 2028 Olympics. People who have done their research know which stadium this will be played in.
"Did anyone watch the golf match yesterday? Awesome!! Millions did!! SOFI WAS MAJOR SPONSOR! SOFI,SOFI,SOFI EVERYWHERE!!"
"Tried to warn those who followed Dan Nathan over the cliff. If he says buy, you sell. There is a reason why they make fun of him on the shows Mr negative and always on the wrong side of the trade."
"Current price does not factor in charter, potential buy by a large bank like Wells Fargo, new features etc. so much upside… only con is the amount of float that has allowed the shorts to keep it down. They will soon pay the price like they are doing for SPRT today !"
"SoFi is an investment. This will take time for them to grow into a giant.Big players manipulating this stock, which in the long term will be beneficial. Bank charter or options next milestone, whichever comes 1st. See you longs on the up."
One day we will look back and wish we could buy at 12-14 level
Lmao many stocks were up 1-2 percent today and people crying saying SOFI should of been up 5 percent - what hole do these people crawl from! SOFI was up almost 3 percent on no news! A gain is a gain.
"Some big names who bought SOFI yesterday are: Goldman Sachs, FMR LLC, HSBC, UBS Group, Franklin Templeton, Durable Capital, Senator Investment Gp, Macquarie Group and Accel. All of them either started a new position or increased their position by multi-million shares on Friday - All for good as we need stable stockholder base rather than weak hands or day traders. Be patient folks, Rome was not built in one day! Very few investors understand what to take away from latest earnings. DYODD Data Source - Fintel"
This is amazing! We have an executive team that are buying their own shares! I’m so use to seeing Karp dumping palantir shares! This is amazing
Bought SoFi over AFFM mainly because of the CEO but I surely do regret that decision.

Nice little run up today. My little sleeping giant.
She’s been looking like a queen in sailor’s dream and she don’t always say what she really means…little Lightfoot ;)
I smell something good cooking on the stove...Time to load up!! $$!
"insider buying just the beginning of the stock moving above $25, NOTO will get bank charter any day"
"Who else actually uses the SoFi platform? You get points just for logging in everyday. You get points for referring someone, for just signing up, these points add up to free money! Get your money right!"
Mooning after hours!
ANTHONY NOTO JUST BOUGHT 399844 shares at 14.22/share. FORM 4 JUST FILED WITH SEC. So many people made fun of him for buying 7k shares for 3 days in a row so he just bought 400k shares LOL WHAT NOW SHORTS AND NAYSAYERS
This thing is going to get unleashed soon!!!! It will challenge 22.50 within 15 trading days! At some point in September $32 is not far fetched! Have your plan ready..... because it will be wild!!!!!
Noto buying 300k worth of stock last week is encouraging. I bought 15k more why not. GL.
"As long as executives are buying, I’m buying. They know something that you don’t know… hint hint."
"First game in SoFi Stadium tonight, get that brand exposure baby"
Analysts have SOFI at the target price of $26.50. Excellent opportunity to own this stock.

Down on heavy volume is never good
KING NOTO  ALL HAIL ANTHONY NOTO HE IE EINSTEIN REINCARNATED  SOFI $100 BY 2026 
Green by 10am
Took a position in my IRA at $16.14. Long term hold. Hopefully better days ahead.
Pete CNBC mentioned about buying calls as he see a potential upside!
"Got a little more buying to get under 18, then it's hold on and hope we are all picking a winner!! 30 BUCKS PER isn't too much to ask is it?"
Love the article today excited about my investment here
Can it go down so I can buy some shares?

Getting close to where the risk is to the upside.
"Ok, everyone get out and push."
PM red means EOD green. You heard it here first
My Average is 15.71 is that high?
Somebody bought 1.5M shares on open
SoFi will put you in a lower tax bracket.
loads of this at a 20% loss.... ouch.... sadly this share will not move until a new catalyst comes about..... still high hopes and not selling.... but diamond hands with this is what you need if you are going to return a profit
When will Noto be on CNBC?
"Brought another $2,000 more $SOFI is going to be an absolute BEAST $50+ within 3 years I have no doubt the company does everything Elon Musk wanted to achieve when he was at PayPal! Anthony Noto and management at the wheel"
Why is this not at 20?? I bought at 18.50
"SOFI growing so fast ,that one of the ""big guys"" BAC,JPM,C"" will be looking for a M&A deal years ahead of planned, 50 years on wall street tells me the buy of a life time ,buying every share possible under $20"
Too bad we are not over 15$ but another Green Day …. What is that 4-5 in a row now? I’ll take it
40% institutional ownership right now. They must be bagholders too
"When $SQ went public, it was disrespected, by wall street. It went below $9. Now, few years later, it is in stratosphere.I predict the same outcome, for $SOFI. Before, they build a skyscraper. They need to build the basement first. SoFi, before it becomes a skyscraper, is at the basement build up, metaphorically speaking,$14.30 price is a gift "
This stock is like Groundhog Day.
Institutional ownership is 19.74% today. It was 8% last Friday.
Buying with everything that isn’t nailed down. Averaged in at $14.50.
Could test 14.99.... with intra high of 15.11???
SoFi to $100
Exciting …. $14.18 is now officially your resistance …. Who would have ever predicted $14.00 by Friday
"Lending: Student loan refinancing, personal and home loans Financial services: Cash management accounts, credit cards, online brokerage SoFi Money: Once the bank charter is obtained, SoFi could offer better rates and generate more revenue off the interest. At the moment, it primarily generates revenue in interchange. SoFi Invest: This allows users to invest in stocks and crypto, and in the future options trading could become available. Users get rewards by interacting with the platform more and depositing money into their accounts. Galileo: This performs the front- and back-end functions for other fintech platforms such as Robinhood, Chime, and Revolut. SoFi could leverage this advantage to cross-sell the other products it offers. With Galileo, SoFi can expand its reach globally much more easily because of the nature of this product.Just as with Square's business, one of the main goals of both companies is for the users to deposit more money on the platform and use as many products as it offers. And lastly, it's all about data at the end of the day. The more data, the better the service the company could offer its users, whether it's loans, rates, or getting a paycheck two days in advance. But for me what makes SoFi stand out is Galileo. As more and more neo-banks emerge, Galileo and SoFi will benefit. You could say that competition is their friend."
Adding more :)
Institutions now own 28.66% in SoFi.
"As long as the Russell moves up, so will this stock."
Where’s the guy who said this would go from $15-20$ in minutes…. Lmao
JPM needs to buy SoFi
https://www.reddit.com/r/sofistock/
Pretty cool Noto gave us the nod. Smart guy!
"UPST at a staggering $218 and SOFI $14.48. Even if you want to look at market cap, income etc etc we are so undervalued it isnt even funny. See what happened, their CEO came from Google and WS needed another darling to pump since the others are at nose bleed levels. Im just going to hand around for a few years and let my money multiply, eventually we will get our day in the sun."
"Brace yourselves, message board complaints about manipulation are coming..."
just close at 15 or above today.
SoFi: Transfer of money from average to the rich
Im adding Monday whilst $SOFI is in the very low 14’s absolute STEAL at these prices I’ve been in since $IPOE 300 shares at an average price of $18ish so looking to lower my dollar cost average. $50+ within 2-3 years all going to plan!
Get ready to say OH NO up SOFI goes. Remember the rules on trading stocks and investment they are treated differently . SOFI's new up cycle has started and if you are not in you will now always be waiting to get in
"Everyone always thinks they can get the last penny and they will know when to buy , 99% of the time they miss and are waiting for the pull back to buy so they always end up not buying and miss a great move higher . Just the way it has always worked"
This drop is nothing. However it is painful to see all the growth stock up 3%.
The best way is to buy... This is the future.
"I think NOTO & team are scooping up shares because bank charter will be closing very soon, just my opinion. Something big is brewing"
Tells you that SOFI is just running out of sellers that want to just give their shares away . It always happens
"Hey Dips $,H,I,T Vansmack I would bet money that you don't have one stock trading way under value like VTRS and for a fact all your stocks are WAY , WAY over priced LOL,LOL,LOL . VTRS is trading under book value and going to make around $3.80 this year for a stock trading at $14 and change . For a fact you will still need to learn investing is about the future and not the past ."
"Next year: ""I can't believe SOFI was at $14..."""
I’m happy about this sell off. I wanted to buy more but it ran up on me. Now that it’s back in the $15 range I will pick up another couple hundred shares.
ANTHONY NOTO IS A GENIUS AND WE WILL BE REWARDED FOR OUR PATIENCE 
Noto and his executive team are putting money where their mouth is! They are very confident in their ability to execute their agenda! This shows buy them buying up their own stock! Just hold or add to your position; we’ll be at that 30 dollar price target this time next year!
$15.60 is the resistance we need to break to fly to $18
Next year do you really think Sofi will be cheap? Me neither.
Back to business after we pass 14.42
"$LC was struggling for years. They bought digital bank, started saving on the loan originations. Stock took off. I am certain, when $Sofi gets its Bank charter, and starts saving on cost of loans originations and getting deposits. Social Finance will be in stratosphere. They're doing everything correctly. Do not panic. Accurate, NOW!!!"
Eviction ban lifted.
Resistance levels $14.80 $15.00$15.46$16.25
If SoFi did a true IPO instead of the SPAC route they would already be 50 per share… this spac selling craze is so temporary
Soon you will be able to buy this stock for $4 per share. Risky loans and cancelled student debt bring about the perfect storm.
Lmao @ the people complaining SOFI not being up - its up over 2 percent. if that’s not up what is? It could be red!
Looks like there was a pretty stiff push off 14. Good news!!
break 15 today!
CFO buying shares with Noto now. Good enough for me !
Good to see retail selling while institutions are buying.
SOFI WILL RISE TOMORROW MORNING JUST LIKE MY MORNING WOOD  WE WILL REACH THE 15'S ONCE AGAIN  
30 bucks by end of year possible?
"SoFi CEO Anthony Noto BOUGHT 7150 shares of SoFi on August 17, 2021"
Sharks are trying so hard to steal your shares at 14 today option exp. next week they will bring it up to a fomo situation so those who lost their shares to sharks today can kick themselves in the head!
if we can close at 15 or above good things to come
"Everyone will get fed up with lack of price movement, sell, then they will have a major news come out later that week. Seen it too many times. Paper hands go ahead and sell me your shares."
"Sept 1 is coming and you will see money flowing back in to a lot of stocks that have been slaughtered , just like SOFI. It's the move for Q4 and the end of the year"
I bought into SOFI early morning of the day of the ER. I was shocked that I’m down 15% out of the gate but I’m very happy I’m in under 20….This is in its infant stages still. 50-60 per share in 2 years easily.
in 10 years i think this stock will be $140- 10 fold up- once this get approved for charter bank . no one can stop this stock. everyone will jump in at that time. so early investors are winner.
"I think we all need to think about a market correction or a disaster that tanks the whole market in the next year in our calculations, I read how people think long term, long term, long term who cares what happens day to day, Well if this stock don't start showing life and something does happen, it brings a world of hurt for a very long time to people that have backed this stock at 22,23,24. So just keep in mind when you give your speeches about who cares about day to day and just wait 2,3,4,5 years- that can turn into 6,7,8,9 with a bear market and prolonged recession. some of don't want 30,000, 40 , 50 grand tied up on a loser for a decade!!! So progress at this point becomes more needed!!"
I shifted funds around and added more SoFi today.
I give up
Will the bank charter make it SoFi valued based on the banking industry or tech? Multiples might be too high to be valued as a bank? Not bashing just wondering.
Look I can't be the only one buying here. People need to step up.
Dan Loeb added bigly to his hedge fund; CEO Noto added a few weeks ago. Buy now or forever hold your peace
"the chatter on this board has died down quite a bit. that alone is pretty bullish. looking for a good week next week as the insider buying news gets out. Moreover, the insider selling looks like it is finally coming to an end. we will have a new shareholder base and investors will be looking to buy a company that is growing at 100%. the expectations reset will be behind us now and we can look forward to the banking license and continued very very strong growth. i also expect more analysts to pick up coverage of the stock as it is a trading monster. wall street banks don't like to leave money on the table even if this came public via spac."
"Get ready for the bounce higher , Why because they are just running out of sellers at this price that want to just give away their shares you always just run out of sellers wanting to just give away their shares it always happens"

No “real” catalyst for the market drop. Green by EOD
Green is green! Lets get it
There is absolutely no reason for this to be down at this point.
Just a matter of time for this thing to explode
"My top 3 stocks, in this order...SOFITLRYSKLZ"
Stop going down.
"I'm now 10k in at $14, boys and girls. This is going to be another one of those long drama-filled journeys to the promise land as this company slowly starts to move mountains. Going long on this and will buy this along with TSLA as I ride the disruptors to mars."
It’ll move soon
Thumbs up  if you think this will be $100+ by 2025!
This will be back over 15.00 this week.
Wow this price action is so predictable. Same pattern every friggen day.
The chart work is clearly saying the price should drop. There is no manipulation. Traders working the charts. It is very clear why it is down. Yesterday last hour trading said it will be down today. How far?? The charts do say $13.60 area is a target. Does it get there??
I'm officially a bag holder.
Can u imagine how many shares they own they are still happy selling at 14. Shady deal
When they get the bank certificate I wonder if they change their name
"Crushing AH, up .01"
"How many of you so called “buy and hold” investors have thrown in the towel, raised the white flag?"
"As I shared many times before, I've been buying $CLOV shares under $8 hand over fist. I hope you've been doing the same. This has proven to be a support area for weeks.Same goes for $SOFI, which I've been saying to keep buying under $15.The market pullback over the past 2 weeks was an overreaction caused by fearmongering. With Pfizer vaccine being FDA approved now, normalcy will only continue to be the optimistic outlook on the horizon. Recovery is happening and continuing to improve. Even with Delta variant, markets will not see another lockdown like last year. We only need vaccine approval for under 12 children now. Keep buying CLOV and SOFI at their current levels at $8.xx and $14.xx while you can. Both will double within 3 months. But your target should be long term.Keep buying. Keep holding."
Ask yourself and let me know ...What could possible move this stock besides a blow out earnings?? hmmmm
You might have noticed the CEO (Anthony Noto) buying multiple days in a row. Every single day he bought exactly 7150 shares. Maybe he is telling us something. Please look up the meaning of 7150 yourself.
Nice Premarket moves
oh Menn where would this rocket be in 5 years?..we only need the fuel!
"Altimeter capital(Brad Gerstner) added 2.5 million shares. Third Point added 28 Million shares! 7th biggest holding behind 6th Disney and ahead of Intuit, Google, Amazon. T Rowe price added 40.2 million shares in q2. Silver lake 38 million in q2"
It’s a buy under 15.00 accumulate
"SOFI is going through the same kind of frustration and very similar year-long price action I went through with SCR.TO before cashing out on its buy out this month. Huge spike in Feb, second surge in June/July and then a settling back down to pre-run up prices. The shorts and bears were super annoying in the chat but were eventually silenced forever because the company is just solid. The longs that held their conviction through all the crazy downward pressure were all rewarded and so too will all SOFI longs be rewarded. Today's little dip is mickey mouse #$%$ in the long run."
If upstart is over $200 what’s your reason sofi shouldn’t be over $ 100 in year !! I have 3500 shares holding till at least $100!!
"I just love the banking industry.Cheers, fellow shareholders."
whoever sold Sofi didn't understand earnings call. without student loans they did great. when student loans forbearance will be over in Jan 31 and Bank charter will be done in Nov this will be untouchable. next year Sofi will be around 50 to 60.thanks for selling. more its going down more I will buy.
Another great week here for SOFI shareholders
"whoever is selling SOFI after Q2FY21 earnings, thank you :)"
should retest the $13.60 area over the next week. 1st upside target after that is about $16.75. 4th quarter this year is when this will become a very interesting stock. MA deals will be heavy then and this should be in play. I value this at $25+. Merge with?? I have ideas as to who would be a buyer.
"a steal under$20, bank charter will come in a month or 2 stock will be $25 end of year"
We are back !!!
This stock will jump once bank charter approval news is released. It can happen any day now.
"Just curious, but why has SoFi not been added to ARK or ARKF? Literally Woods has mentioned SoFi many times before as a disruptor and innovator...but yet, months later, still no addition?"

4 out of the last 5 days money flow in is more than out....including today!!
down-18%. have to hope for better days folks.
Anyone else love HUGE growth? Yep - me too !
"Just my opinion - don't overthink this. Big lockup expiration, retail shorters pushing it down oh-so slightly, scared new investors trying to figure out *the* reason for the drop while selling at a loss after an earnings report that had some large one-time costs, the CARES act extension pressuring the student loans market. Posting on message boards like this one don't do SQUAT to the share price - only to your own emotional reaction to price flux. LOTS of recent institutional buying going on that can be verified at the nasdaq site. You didn't buy a standard IPO - you bought a weird version of a venture capital investment. Things happen and will sort themselves out. Stop trying to turn this into a GME or AMC - it's not going to happen and you certainly aren't going to influence the share price of SOFI on a message board. CALM DOWN. GO OUTSIDE. PET A CAT. Use your panic to buy more shares - a teensy amount at a time. Chances are we have 4-8 funky weeks of seasonality in the market that will whipsaw everything. If you can't handle the pressure, this isn't for you. If need be, sell a TEENSY amount of shares and see how that feels. Maybe you just need to taste a slight bit of selling action to find some peace without losing a ton. I'll be there buying some of your shares."
"If only most of you know how to read Sofi’s earnings you would understand how profitable they are. Next quarter we should see good profits and hopefully a bank charter. Then we will have some great catalysts,"
"Shareholders, why has NOTO not come forward to explain the SPAC shareholders are unloading every share they own, this stock is a steal at these prices $25 before end of year"
"ladies and gentleman, we are returning to the bullish trend before earnings report...or not"
So what's the reason for this dip?
Going to add 20K more shares by October. This is a hold till 2025 minimum.
"Got to get the Sofi early investors to quit selling their investment at this low price, I understand they want to cash in but until they run out of shares momentum is almost impossible!"
"When the SPAC era is eventually chronicled, $BGRY, $SOFI and $SKIN will be the investment opportunities people talk about missing out on."
We are still up over 3% for the week! Lets finish this week strong.
Noto bought againAnother $100K last week.They buy on the open market for only one reason. . .
Touched $14.91 three times today. Let’s dip that toe above $15!
"A strong finish today would be wonderful, maybe it could lead to real bounce back this week?"
They are trying to hold it down to rake in all the option money cash and cause max pain to the option traders . Think or it as monthly dividend cash through option money rake
"14.93 by 3:30, sells off to 14.80 by 3:50 and then crawls back up to 14.85 by close"
"Third Point, SoftBank, Altimeter, QIA, Blackrock, Chamath, Noto et al. Done and done…forever hold."
I just grabbed 2000 more shares of sofi to hold 9000 shares total. I sold 1000 shares of Bigc to free up some buying power. I’m down on sofi but I think sofi is a better play??
"Once you adjust for one-time accounting issues that have no impact on ongoing operations (Galilelo and warrant tax treatments) to match the estimates estimates used by analysts excluding these accounting adjustments, SOFI was profitable this quarter for the first time and topped estimates."
"So close to takeoff, just needs a pinch of heavy buying"
SOFI WILL BE A GAME CHANGER COME 2026. ANTHONY NOTO IS THE MODERN DAY KING HENRY  ANTHONY NOTO IS EINSTEIN REINCARNATED  HOLD HOLD HOLD.. DONT GIVE INTO THE FEAR MONGERING! STAY STRONG 
Almost green come on!!!
"Guys, SoFi has a price to book ratio of 2.65. Compare this ratio to all other growth stocks you know! SoFi is not an overvalued stock!!!!! Value investors typically look voor a price to book ratio under 3. Almost all growth companies have a way higher PB ratio. Take a look at some examples:SQ: 46NIO: 15APPL: 38FB: 8GOOG: 8TTD: 32SHOP: 19Z: 4PLTR: 24NVDA: 27NFLX: 18The list goes on and on!SoFi is undervalued. PERIOD."
Keeps bouncing up against 14.23. Knock enough times and it’s bound to bust through. Looking for a strong run soon.
"From June 8:How a bank charter impacts earningsIn SoFi's investor presentation, it estimated that without a bank charter its adjusted EBITDA (base case) would be $254 million in 2022 but that it would be $447 million with the bank charter. The 76 percent jump in EBITDA due to the bank charter is estimated due to the lower expected cost of capital and increased lending growth. Similarly, the company has estimated the incremental EBITDA until 2025 and the cumulative incremental EBITDA comes out to be $1,005 million until 2025.Bank charter (final) oval around the corner, sounds like October (?), likely will pop on that news when it does hit"
"I was 50\50 MTTR OR SOFI. I CHOOSE SOFI. I HAVE HOPE ONE DAY I WILL BE PROVEN NOT TO BE THE DUMBEST\UNLUCKIEST PERSON ALIVE FOR THAT DECISION. MADE $2,000 ON GHVI and changed horses! down 20 percent Sofi, bigger company, way more earnings, market 4 times, yet 8 percent gain today, 2 dollars more a share. Whatever funk is on this Sofi stock, I sure wish they wash it off and let it breathe. This doesn't make sense"
no real change in the last week(8/20-8/27) with regard to SP or RSIonly real notable is money in was more than money out...quiet accumulation
Very bullish. Glad I bought the dip along with ceo Anthony Noto. By next year? Def over 20. By olympics 2028 which will be held in sofi stadium? $100+ easily. And those are conservative estimates. Been here since IPOE and I will keep buying dips for years.
this could become a meme stock and have a life of its own. shorts should be cautious here. this is not a good stock to short going forward...................................
Soooo….Gensler going to push everyone towards the SOFI model ? Citadel cannot be happy with their men in tights relationship. No conflict BTW ;)
"Until all the Sofi investors locked up shares have been liquidated , the gains and positive direction will be impossible to build on, they just sell when it gets mo"
"SPAC sellers near the end, bank charter in 30+- days, tp by analyst $30+. sept will show huge volume as large mutual funds start to buy, buying every share possible $35 soon"
"Glad to have this time in the dip to accumulate more. A while ago I was hoping to get to 3000 shares, and as of today i'm at 5400."
Do I see green 
I honestly don’t really care if the price drops further. I will keep accumulating more shares! I recommend watching some interviews with Anthony Noto. I will never sell my shares unless Anthony steps down. This CEO is amazing.
But Stock Moe from Youtube said this is good stock that will trade in the 30's
"Bought at the bottom of the barrow on tesla and sold literally at the peak at high $800s, bought at the bottom of the barrow on many charging EV companies and sold at the top before February and I am buying at the bottom of the barrow on SoFI and I am loading BIG"
When do companies if ever stop being referred as SPACs when they use that vehicle to go public
just close at 15 or above all I ask.
$VENA $SOFI $GOOG Trust your vision
This is a 5 year hold easy a 5 bagger. I would say good luck but wont need luck with that stock.
"Wow, who knew $15 was possible this week ?!?"
Anybody else buy that dip at 5:15am? Asking for a friend...
"Have you ever seen this before?Insiders are buying High revenue growth Cheap considering PS ratio High quality CEOGrowing website traffic Upcoming bank charterYet the stock is dropping. SoFi is a company I am extremely bullish on, however it is one of the weirdest behaving stocks in the whole market."
"good 14.50 today- 15.50 by the end of the week. It's time. this stock has to get to a point that reflects it's worth again, the market will moderate this stock and it will start to gain steam!"
So tired of this down trend. There is no reason
Institutional ownership jumped from < 3% (yesterday) to almost 8% today. Clear exchange of shares from weak hands to smart money. Source - Fintel
"If you want to learn you can see the cycle is now changing , by making a 3 month chart of MACD , Slow Stochastic and money flow , you can see on the MACD the red bars are now getting smaller and rolled over going to green , The slow stochastic has now cross and the money has stopped flowing out"
Why didn't anyone here tell me to get UPST instead of SOFI?
This price action is so artificial and manipulated. There is no way retailers making it so perfect at $14
food for thought with football season in session and concerts coming back sofi stadium will see increased usage since they offer 25% off if you use sofi in the stadium this will both increase users and profitability
Such a nice day. Wouldn’t mind to have another one in a row.
"Charts suggest a rising wedge pattern that potentially suggests a ""small-ish"" break out to the downside by Thursday/Friday. I feel that's the last bit of accumulation needed by the longs to break past $15:10 temporary holding cell and use it as support. Next week we may see some more accumulation before a gradual gap up to $17's, but this slug is moving!"

Meanwhile Upstart has basically been a 10 bagger in less than 9 months. Incredible.
Manipulators not letting this turn green today. No chance we turn green by EOD
Clearly manipulated stock. Down for no reason. Let’s see if we can turn green by EOD
"SoFi CEO Anthony Noto.BOUGHT 7150 shares of SoFi on August 17, 2021and~!BOUGHT 7150 shares MORE on 8/18/2021 (BOUGHT 14300 SHARES in TWO DAYS)"
CNBC just said sofi is a better managed company than Robinhood
Can we spark up a debate on why SoFi would or would not add buy now pay later service?
"I started a position in sofi a couple weeks back @ 15 pre DD, after doing my research I’m coming to the conclusion this is super overvalued. Price wouldn’t be justified until 2023 if growth continues at same rate. Not gonna add anymore into my position. What are your thoughts?"

Hundreds of winning stocks other than this one
They had some interesting insights about SOFI on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Guys, open your eyes - If Noto is buying, why would you not?"
13.8 this disappointment even rivals BABA
"If you aren't tied up in other positions, anything under 14 is an amazing entry. Bank charter is on the horizon."
Slow and steady.
"@Yanz yes I was bearish Every sense SOFI was almost $25 when I told you to sell and now the charts are telling you SOFI is going higher. If you really want to learn make a 3 month chart of MACD, Slow Stochastic and money Flow. You can see that the new up cycle has started as the Slow Stochastic has cross. The money Flow stop lowing out and The MACD red bars are getting smaller and turning green"
Another week of accumulation and think we’ll be all set!
Holding at 18.. tempted to avg down here.. Great company…
Market is dipping because of the ￼ Afghanistan situation! Just hold! It’s about to be bumpy.
Transfer cash from Sofi invest to Sofi money takes 2-3 days. Isn’t this the same company? This is a real solid “fintech”
Its 2030 and you look into your brokerage account. How much would a SoFi share be worth by that time?
Buying the dips. We'll be rocketing higher soon!Best to my fellow longs!
I bought in too early but here for long haul. 2845 shares at 17.32 avg cost baby. let's goo
A small insider buy by aaron webster
"When I order to buy on Schwab, I get ""SOFI has a special maintenance requirement of 70%. (AC157)"". Can anyone explain this charge? I'm not buying on margin."
Watch 15.11 today!
"Keep buying under 14. Long term is where institutions focused. I believe SOFI has a very good chance of being be acquired by one of the big banking institutions. And SOFI's CEO could make it happen.As I've mentioned before, CEO Anthony Noto has friends on Wall Street with his work experience. -COO and CFO of Twitter-Partner at Goldman Sachs And his network of relationships are holding long:26.10% - Shares Held by All Insider25.27% - Shares Held by Institutions34.19% - Float Held by InstitutionsKeep buying. Keep HODL'ing."
"bought 5,000 shares."
"Institutions holding and buying even more shares of SOFI are controlling the price, not you....especially you shorts. $14 range continues consolidating and a bounce up is inevitable from this support. Keep buying. Keep holding."
"Noto added another 7150 shares last week. If he is buying, I am buying."
"I've seen the investor call deck, but realistically, how much do the banking charter and options trading add to SoFi stock price in the near term?"
Shorts…. I can smell your fear!
When do you see SOFI at $15 plus a share?
