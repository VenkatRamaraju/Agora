“This Analyst Positive on SoFi Stock as Bank Charter Comes Within Reach”https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-analyst-positive-on-sofi-stock-as-bank-charter-comes-within-reach-2021-08-27%3famp
Im adding Monday whilst $SOFI is in the very low 14’s absolute STEAL at these prices I’ve been in since $IPOE 300 shares at an average price of $18ish so looking to lower my dollar cost average. $50+ within 2-3 years all going to plan!
"When $SQ went public, it was disrespected, by wall street. It went below $9. Now, few years later, it is in stratosphere.I predict the same outcome, for $SOFI. Before, they build a skyscraper. They need to build the basement first. SoFi, before it becomes a skyscraper, is at the basement build up, metaphorically speaking,$14.30 price is a gift "
CNBC just said sofi is a better managed company than Robinhood
well I missed the big dip but this is still a dip I'm in for 20k
Being copied by PayPal. Will need to merge to compete. Takeout candidate.
If SoFi did a true IPO instead of the SPAC route they would already be 50 per share… this spac selling craze is so temporary
One morning we're all going to wake up and this baby is going to be 25+....
"Guys, SoFi has a price to book ratio of 2.65. Compare this ratio to all other growth stocks you know! SoFi is not an overvalued stock!!!!! Value investors typically look voor a price to book ratio under 3. Almost all growth companies have a way higher PB ratio. Take a look at some examples:SQ: 46NIO: 15APPL: 38FB: 8GOOG: 8TTD: 32SHOP: 19Z: 4PLTR: 24NVDA: 27NFLX: 18The list goes on and on!SoFi is undervalued. PERIOD."
"Sept 1 is coming and you will see money flowing back in to a lot of stocks that have been slaughtered , just like SOFI. It's the move for Q4 and the end of the year"
"Lending: Student loan refinancing, personal and home loans Financial services: Cash management accounts, credit cards, online brokerage SoFi Money: Once the bank charter is obtained, SoFi could offer better rates and generate more revenue off the interest. At the moment, it primarily generates revenue in interchange. SoFi Invest: This allows users to invest in stocks and crypto, and in the future options trading could become available. Users get rewards by interacting with the platform more and depositing money into their accounts. Galileo: This performs the front- and back-end functions for other fintech platforms such as Robinhood, Chime, and Revolut. SoFi could leverage this advantage to cross-sell the other products it offers. With Galileo, SoFi can expand its reach globally much more easily because of the nature of this product.Just as with Square's business, one of the main goals of both companies is for the users to deposit more money on the platform and use as many products as it offers. And lastly, it's all about data at the end of the day. The more data, the better the service the company could offer its users, whether it's loans, rates, or getting a paycheck two days in advance. But for me what makes SoFi stand out is Galileo. As more and more neo-banks emerge, Galileo and SoFi will benefit. You could say that competition is their friend."
"Until all the Sofi investors locked up shares have been liquidated , the gains and positive direction will be impossible to build on, they just sell when it gets mo"
food for thought with football season in session and concerts coming back sofi stadium will see increased usage since they offer 25% off if you use sofi in the stadium this will both increase users and profitability
"Third Point, SoftBank, Altimeter, QIA, Blackrock, Chamath, Noto et al. Done and done…forever hold."
"Everyone will get fed up with lack of price movement, sell, then they will have a major news come out later that week. Seen it too many times. Paper hands go ahead and sell me your shares."
Transfer cash from Sofi invest to Sofi money takes 2-3 days. Isn’t this the same company? This is a real solid “fintech”
"I've been very bullish on $AFRM and $SOFI for a few months as they both have been gaining market share at various websites I'd visit. So the $AMZN partnership announcement on Friday was no surprise. I sold my $AFRM over $100 this morning for over 45% gain and moving it to $SOFI and adding even more shares of $JWN under 29....Nordstrom will be back above 38 in the short term in no time. I have also added more shares to $ADSK, which I expect to be back above 340 also in the short term.Keep buying $JWN, $ADSK, $SOFI. Keep holding."
"Here is a clue for you Vansmack. If the insiders are buying in mass news is coming and they all know something you don't LOL,LOL,LOL . Tell you are now running out of time to cover than short position and the last thing you want to be is short when the news come out"
"Bank Charter, will reduce the cost 9f loans originations. Will increase, thereby profit margins.Will also increase deposits. Bank Charter will be a huge boost in profitability. Those ,who are buying at this level will be hugely rewarded, in time.Those who are selling will be kicking themselves lol"
"SoFi is an investment. This will take time for them to grow into a giant.Big players manipulating this stock, which in the long term will be beneficial. Bank charter or options next milestone, whichever comes 1st. See you longs on the up."
You might have noticed the CEO (Anthony Noto) buying multiple days in a row. Every single day he bought exactly 7150 shares. Maybe he is telling us something. Please look up the meaning of 7150 yourself.
"a steal under$20, bank charter will come in a month or 2 stock will be $25 end of year"
Added another $4k at $14.17 today. Can see past the short term volatility.
"When I order to buy on Schwab, I get ""SOFI has a special maintenance requirement of 70%. (AC157)"". Can anyone explain this charge? I'm not buying on margin."
When they get the bank certificate I wonder if they change their name
"SPAC sellers near the end, bank charter in 30+- days, tp by analyst $30+. sept will show huge volume as large mutual funds start to buy, buying every share possible $35 soon"
Tells you that SOFI is just running out of sellers that want to just give their shares away . It always happens
"Have you ever seen this before?Insiders are buying High revenue growth Cheap considering PS ratio High quality CEOGrowing website traffic Upcoming bank charterYet the stock is dropping. SoFi is a company I am extremely bullish on, however it is one of the weirdest behaving stocks in the whole market."
Using sofi app to buy sofi stock :)
"8/26/2021Anthony NotoCEOBuy7,150$14.31$102,316.50With NOTO buying shares this shows he has confidence in his business! Big things are about to happen."
Its 2030 and you look into your brokerage account. How much would a SoFi share be worth by that time?
13.8 this disappointment even rivals BABA

"Who else actually uses the SoFi platform? You get points just for logging in everyday. You get points for referring someone, for just signing up, these points add up to free money! Get your money right!"
"I think NOTO & team are scooping up shares because bank charter will be closing very soon, just my opinion. Something big is brewing"
