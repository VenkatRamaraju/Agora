"Are banks a good investment to hedge against inflation?Banks are inflation hedges because inflation usually produces margin expansion for banks. If the rate for an auto loan right now is 3%, and then a year from now, it's 4%, banks are going to be making more money off auto loans. The only time inflation hurts banks is when it causes prices to rise so fast it reduces demand and leads to a recession. With the pent up demand we see in today's economy I would doubt we see a recession in the next 12-18 months a rates rise. Not a guarantee but a good bet."
5 and 10 yr Treasury yields dropped back. 2 yr auction yesterday shows nervousness over short term rates. Canada looking to raise rates.Longer term direction for rates is still higher. Expense inflation and price increases the main theme from earnings calls. Look at UPS for an example.
Could be on track to break the all time high for CFG share price today.
"Added a little more to my position this week. I knew CFG was going to do well, but didn't expect this well so fast. Awesome!"
Folks... What's the impact of adding about 73.5 million shares to already existing about 426 million?
Does anyone have any insight into CFG's dividend policy? It's been 8 quarters at $0.39 - the longest period without an increase since breaking away from RBS and initiating their own IOP... With inflation the effective dividend rate at about 3% no longer makes CFG a value-added standout financial or banking stock... Just curious what others are thinking...
Interest rates rises! Maybe it’ll be in the double digits like the 1980s and gold tumbled below $1000!!!! Inflation at the highest! Food rising the most!! CFG will cross $50+ by Friday!! Maybe Wells Fargo will buy CFG at $70!!!
5yr Treasury yield at the highest level since March 2020 when COVID hit. Up almost 100bps since the middle of 2020 and 70bps since the start of 2021. 10Treasury yield at the highest level since April. Asset yields respond to interest rate increases faster than retail deposits so this can only mean good things for CFG net interest margins going forward.
"I was buying this hand over fist in May-June of 2020, been investing over 15 years and never bought a bank stock. However, when I saw even Warren Buffett running scared from banks, I knew it was time to jump in ;)"
"Analyst price targets for CFG being adjusted UP, UP and UP.Goldman $59Wedbush $58"
CFG will finish the year at over 60.00$. Banking sector is getting hot and CFG is as good and as undervalued as it gets. People will be leaving the FAANG stocks and piling into banks.
I’m new to this chat/board. I’m a long time holder of ISBC stock so I’ve started buying a small amount of CFG in anticipation of the acquisition next year. At first I was disappointed in the sale price but as I’ve been researching and following CFG I’m becoming more pleased and see the long term benefits of the purchase. Question: What is driving the current jump in the price of this stock?
"CNBC talking heads telling investors BUY Banks, Insurance companies, financials in general who will all benefit from rising rates."
"CFG is issuing 73,565,202 shares of stock."
"Treasury yields are up again this morning. Market seems to be taking a different view of inflation than the Fed. Earnings reports from companies show employment cost pressures and revenue increases driven by price increases. Chipotle is a good example.What does this mean for CFG? Higher net interest margins over time as assets reprice and retail deposit pricing increases lag. Home equity loans, adjustable rate mortgages, and new loan originations priced to medium term treasuries will all be seeing increases in yields in 2022/23 while banks that are flush with deposits will not raise deposit rates until outflows require a response. That usually takes quite awhile and banks have been overfunded with deposits for awhile so they may lag even longer in this cycle.A 10 basis point increase in NIM% equals about $170 million in increased annual revenue with very little expense offset. About $42 million per quarter which would be a 6.5% increase in pre-tax, pre-provision income. This is before the impact of acquisitions."
On Sale Today and Today Only!
Let's see $50 !!!!!!!!!! With Treasury yields at 1.64% and the new acquisitions the value of deposit funding and growing non interest income is going to push CFG into the $60 to $70 range before long. Selling at barely 10X earnings and paying a great dividend yield.
Goldman pushes up CFG price target to $57 from $51. Seeing the $50's this week would be great.
I have been unable to find the answer to this question on the web. Does Citizens Financial Group offer a DRIP?
"If this dips to 43.00$ again, I will load the boat!"
