SHORT SQUEEZE OF CENTURY? THANK U SHORTY BIGGER DIPS BIGGER RIPS
Share this stock over the weekend. Let them know about the squeeze and how this is linked with $dwac and $phun
wow... strong red... and i am still holding baby...
If you got in at 4.50 you will be holding for years 
I learned one thing again today don’t buy at the open
"I cant buy pre Market, is it still smart to buy when this opens?"
"380 million shares traded today, on a float of 105 million"
"Currently, Remark Holdings is the #1 trending stock on Yahoo! Finance"
check out $MARK
Strong last 5 minutes of after-hours. Good sign for premarket
"As of today, MARK is #16 out of hundredson the fintel short squeeze list with ascore of 90.17I'm not sharing this because I believe MARK couldactually squeeze. That concept is tossed around waytoo liberally by us retail investors. But it's worth sharingbecause these heavily shorted, high squeeze potentialplays generally tend see big momentum swings.Sentiment changes almost weekly and volumeincreases and we see big spikes followed by big dips.This is all very good news for us bag holders that justwant to make our money back and get the hell out ofthis trade! It's definitely a glimmer of hope and evenmore reason to hold as opposed to selling for a loss.We will eventually make our money back."
Massive volume price rises at end of the day looking very interesting I'll be buying premarket
Time to Buy folks look at the chart. This is going way up.
Mark sold...3000 EUR net profit ;-)
$MARK 10$ TP
I really hope it goes to $13 a shar me or higher
"Friends...watch for the pop during AH today. Insider's in China will make it happen and we will gap up at the bell on Monday, a.m. Peter"
MARK ready for another run for sure!
"Great move up, hourly chart looks great!"
already 2.25 .....sure 25 today
Bought another 5000 stocks
don't care what people are saying. just bought more worth 3k
Sold all my shares 29k loss
glad to get out at $7.32 at the pre-market.
Freshly minted bagholder here. Hope this recovers soon.
this is one of the first stocks I invested in when I first started investing. very nice
"Mark on Monday will be top gainer , allas for people who sold today"
I'm trying to recoup my losses at PROG. Chart looks much better and looks to break to new highs. Hopefully MARK will make a comeback soon.
"Well, at least I found one thing I'm good at, Buying high and Selling low. Did that yesterday and then again today. Bought at $2.27 on the open. Sure looked like it would pop up big, just like PHUN opened and quickly was up 25%."
everyday I set sell limit of $20 pre post and live market 
"if you guys listen to me you will make money. very simple, it's not a short squeeze but it can eventually lead to a short squeeze if you buy and Hold. The short ratio should be 1 or less to initiate a squeeze which can only happen by holding this price. also, Shorts will try to harass you in coming days as they will build their positions and if don't get harassed the squeeze will happen."
Hold your shares it will go back up. Don’t panic and sell.
The strong will rise and the weak will fall like winter wheat
I say we langs will hit 7 to 9 USD tomorrow or Wednesday latest. Let's go.
"Short interest is only 11% as of Sep 30 and short borrow interest rate is 4% on Interactive Broker as of today. However, if we can sky rocket the share price, the borrow interest rate will increase rapidly and put pressure on the shorts to cover. Short % of Float (Sep. 30, 2021) 11.03%"
"Big deal with mark to develop trump network, monday will hit 40$"
Very rare I see no bashers here. Must be a great sign for things to come.. so there must be some truth to the rumors to partners with truth media.. Phun touched $24 this should touch there as well.
Daily cup and handle?
$phun to the moon
"people optimistic about MARK, saying sectors are down etc making me laugh haha. yeah, a meme stock will perform with correlation to the market"
back to 6 next week
is it chinese company?
I'll have over $1 Million profit when he hit $10 a share!!
10X stock PR will release everything at Earning call
Outstanding volume
"got in at 8.21 pre market, what should I do?"
Pre markets gonna be up around 5-6.. Bought a whole bunch at 3.50. Easy money. Let’s hope for the best
Looks like $MARK might meet us before the day’s over with.
"super squeeze imminent, MARK loading... 3.00 pps in the blink of an eye"
Still people don't get it people are still selling shares for cheap I laugh at that.
Held it for 2 years at 1.25$ - 3000 shares
I put a sell limit of $25
"Tell me board, why is a stock with no news ever up 600% in two days? Looking forward to your input."
3 days in a row i take dwac 12.5 sold 131 phun bought 1.5 sold 13 now this buy 1.73 and rocketing
I’m panic  i lost more than 60 % of my saving
strong buy! let's take it to 10$ again!
"I bought 10,000 for $8. Is mark hopeful? "
Why can’t I buy any options on this?
$5-6 Monday is within reason based on volume today.
after 5$ we put it 10$
this is gonna be huge... not selling until 15$.
30$ monday
Opened at 6.65 and under 3.50 now don’t make any sense.
I was hoping to sell my 1K shares at least at $5. I let go at $4.07. Learnt a lesson (on $WISH & $MTCR).
"$Mark is the next $Phun. I PROMISE, $Mark has connections with $Dwac, do your own research. We have lift off on Monday."
Why did I not pull the trigger to buy at $1.8 on Friday?
something cooking. Roth Capital lifted their price target to .....$20.50
Based on what is Mark going up again today ?? Anybody ??
Can I get a 1400% gain for once in my life. Thanks
Up 476% in Frankfurt right now!
"Cryptocurrency /forex trading is a big chance to make money nowadays, if you can't see that at this point is time you learn more about it"
Pre market is going to be insane $Phun and $Mark (mark is connected with $dwac)
Mark will bounce back up . We all seen the potential here. This stock rockets to 9 dollars soon enough .
These deals are just gambling. Put in a few hundred or few thousand in the event MARK announces that Elon Musk has joined them in their future endeavors
how is this not exploding!!!!!!!
"i am not able to buy myself in the pre market, due to my broker. Should i still buy when the market opens? Where will this stock go?"
"People start getting out from PHUN and get in to MARK , smart move folks , doubling thier profit"
Frankfurt is up an astonishing 855%!!!!!!Their day is about half over.I guess we're opening around at least 500%??!?!?
man I wish if I had waited till the market open.. I chased it but that's OK. I know what I invested in. I just I'm a bit behind
"If you own mark share then you are lucky, premarket will surprise you as inflow will be high volume tomorrow and i am expecting 40$ tomorrow premarket, consider my post as financial advice."
Good ol bull flag.. Cup and handle pattern with boom boom candles.. SHORT SQUEEZE AND MARGIN CALLS INCOMING!
Next time listen to me. I told you all it will pull back to 2 then 90 cents. The pump by meme crowd is over. Just like PHUN and DWAC.
Lets see $30
$agfy just entered another deal benefiting if $23M. So far the company has added over $60M in partnerships alone and increased revenues quarterly. This stock has a bright future. Only $300M market cap and growing revenue over $60M this year alone. $bimi $bkkt $spi $mark
Blessings. Start the day in the word of GOD. John 3:16. 
Will see 5$ again today!! End of day and after hours will spark again ️
$6+ Monday
"If news is fake then market watch ,zacks,reddits,and other similar should be all banned from reporting any news. Market Watch stated we will see 8 fold. Gain on Mark stock tomorrow. If false news then we need to censor all false news."
"Remark Bag Holdings, Inc,....the stock where you're left holding the bag"
$MARK GOING TO $13 ON MONDAY
"i boight at 7,3? Smart?"
"Stop selling, buy and hold."
"I’m in 3365 shares at 2.63, it keeps dropping but should have a nice pump soon, although I have to admit the drop in volume is a bit concerning"
"Why it wouldn't let buy more than 4,000 shares?"
no company with volumes this huge trade at $2 this being held down massively. Will be a $70 dollar squeeze in no time at all
Is it best to buy at open or wait for a hour or so till it drops a bit? Seems like this is usually the pattern with stocks.
$Trka and $Mark lets go to the moon $Phun
we gonna run back to $9.00
"Hold for tomorrow,,, will move the same as BKKT"
Pre-market shake out. We are heading to 4 guys. Load up.
My boy swore this was gonna blow up today so we went in $500 each. Last time I follow his financial advice.  It blew up alright just in the wrong direction.
"This heading for a BKKT type of day,massive short squeeze coming...hold tight it is gonna be a wild ride."
"If the retail meme investors get a hold of this stock as rumored with a short squeeze, this is going to be bigger than AMC.Don't sell Monday unless you want to risk one of the biggest profit takings for yourself in your life. And thank Donald Trump, even if you don't agree with his politics. It's gonna be one wild week."
"I know better than this, why did I try chasing a few bucks"
I am holding a heavy bag .. very heavy
Monday os great day for holders to celebrate
Wow $BRPM acquisition of FAZE CLAN valuation 1 billion currently X5 current share price… once $DWAC $PHUN $MARK run this will be next
BKKT The trend we've seen in After Hours with $phun $dwac $mark $bene will continue here tonight
"Supersrong Buy! 2500% upside potencial, news on the way, this is sqeeze time!$phun $dwac $mark $prog $ater"

King Kong out of the gate today.

How about the OFFering?LINK----http://ir.remarkholdings.com/static-files/2206a447-63ba-4b67-9e8a-461c430d231fHelloooooooooooooooooooooooo?
"For those wondering, this is running because of the CEO’s relationship with the DWAC CEO. The chart here is also identical to PHUN’s chart from yesterday before it ran to $20 today."
Back to 9$
Will close around 9 $
Hold strong guys. More market buys. Only a few cents difference.
last chance to enter before 5$+
good idea to buy pre market?
"OMG, like, my friends' brother's niece just said that she saw on TicTok that this is like totally going to $120 per share like tomorrow."
Come to $PROG. Next squeeze
Holding
"Always go with the gut. Gut said ""place order to buy at market close"". Finger said buy ""Market"". Now I'm giving myself a double barrel middle finger."
"Only 105.11 mil shares are supposed to exist of this company. On OCT 22 187,454,200 shares traded. Oct25 386,168,400, OCT26 83,832,600 and Oct27 52,905,088. Today alone Ortex Short Interest Change is +18.54%, Estimated Current SI % of FF 25.69%. I am not in this play, but there's a reason there are so many bashers in here trying to get people to walk away. Anything short over 10% of a company is high. IN MY OPINION, if people truly looked at the numbers and realized that they just need to hold because they sold more shares than exist the price of the stock will have to go up because they need people to sell. The problem is people get emotional and watch the stock all day go down with manipulative tactics and they bail for thousand plus loss after just buying in a few days earlier, totally disregarding their initial reason for buying and forgetting that if more positive news comes out that it could send it back to their very buy in price. The problem is people forget this and fold at a loss and the vicious hf cycle continues. If only blockchain would be incorporated on the market to truly keep it fair."
Don’t listen to Bashers or Shorts  Trying to Scare everyone to Sell Patience is a Virtue Stay Strong 
Should I buy pre-market or at open?
Minimum will be 9 $
"Buy the dip and diamond hands hold. This is gonna be not only a meme stock play, but also huge short squeeze potential! MARK my words!"
do you think $10 today ?
BUY or HOLD. These are your options. No more selling. No more shares left to sell. Shorts are toast.Simply Buy or Hold and watch this stock go up.
"Now that I sold it and took a loss of 5K , it’s going up."
this is frozen now... still holding strong... will hold for next 3 months to reach 6$ back..
"$frsx has hit $2,9-2.8 multiple times and found a clear bottom at this level. Yesterday $fncmx, a fund managing $14B bought 24500 shares of $frsx. Combine this with the fact that $frsx 1y pattern looks exactly the same as $mark indicates that something is going on. This stock might boom or it might go up some double digits. Ether way this is a winner"
12$ coming
Pre market monday 4$+
"Mark will surprise everybody in premarket, massive run ready to fly to the moon Thanks trumpy"
What’s a good entry point tomorrow?
