Time to Buy folks look at the chart. This is going way up.
Come to $PROG. Next squeeze
"If you own mark share then you are lucky, premarket will surprise you as inflow will be high volume tomorrow and i am expecting 40$ tomorrow premarket, consider my post as financial advice."
everyday I set sell limit of $20 pre post and live market 
"got in at 8.21 pre market, what should I do?"
Strong last 5 minutes of after-hours. Good sign for premarket
Could bounce to two digits soon!
no company with volumes this huge trade at $2 this being held down massively. Will be a $70 dollar squeeze in no time at all
"I cant buy pre Market, is it still smart to buy when this opens?"
"Buy the dip and diamond hands hold. This is gonna be not only a meme stock play, but also huge short squeeze potential! MARK my words!"
"I bought 10,000 for $8. Is mark hopeful? "
"Currently, Remark Holdings is the #1 trending stock on Yahoo! Finance"
we gonna run back to $9.00
good idea to buy pre market?
Blessings. Start the day in the word of GOD. John 3:16. 
something cooking. Roth Capital lifted their price target to .....$20.50
I'll have over $1 Million profit when he hit $10 a share!!
Why is it up? I have 3000 shares at 1$ held it for 2 years lol.... up to 8$ in pre Market
Opened at 6.65 and under 3.50 now don’t make any sense.
I feel like all stocks just got shorted across all board $PHUN $DWAC $MARK $BENE $CEI
Daily cup and handle?
Frankfurt is up an astonishing 855%!!!!!!Their day is about half over.I guess we're opening around at least 500%??!?!?
"Well, at least I found one thing I'm good at, Buying high and Selling low. Did that yesterday and then again today. Bought at $2.27 on the open. Sure looked like it would pop up big, just like PHUN opened and quickly was up 25%."
"Friends, the reason its' been relatively quiet during AH is that it's Saturday in China. Keep an eye on pre-market on Monday. We should gap up at the bell. Peter"
"If the retail meme investors get a hold of this stock as rumored with a short squeeze, this is going to be bigger than AMC.Don't sell Monday unless you want to risk one of the biggest profit takings for yourself in your life. And thank Donald Trump, even if you don't agree with his politics. It's gonna be one wild week."
"Tell me board, why is a stock with no news ever up 600% in two days? Looking forward to your input."
25 today
"03:18 PM EDT, 10/22/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Remark Holdings (MARK) shares skyrocketed 127% to $2.06 in Friday afternoon trading with volume at nearly 84 million shares against a daily average of about 1.2 million.The company on Thursday filed a registration statement for a potential offering of securities, including common stock, with an aggregate initial price of up to $50 million."
$Trka and $Mark lets go to the moon $Phun
I say we langs will hit 7 to 9 USD tomorrow or Wednesday latest. Let's go.
Good ol bull flag.. Cup and handle pattern with boom boom candles.. SHORT SQUEEZE AND MARGIN CALLS INCOMING!
"Great move up, hourly chart looks great!"
"Friends...watch for the pop during AH today. Insider's in China will make it happen and we will gap up at the bell on Monday, a.m. Peter"
Is it best to buy at open or wait for a hour or so till it drops a bit? Seems like this is usually the pattern with stocks.
already 2.25 .....sure 25 today
$MARK GOING TO $13 ON MONDAY
I'm trying to recoup my losses at PROG. Chart looks much better and looks to break to new highs. Hopefully MARK will make a comeback soon.
If I don’t see eight fold tomorrow then I will not believe any stock news.
Hold strong guys. More market buys. Only a few cents difference.
"Only 105.11 mil shares are supposed to exist of this company. On OCT 22 187,454,200 shares traded. Oct25 386,168,400, OCT26 83,832,600 and Oct27 52,905,088. Today alone Ortex Short Interest Change is +18.54%, Estimated Current SI % of FF 25.69%. I am not in this play, but there's a reason there are so many bashers in here trying to get people to walk away. Anything short over 10% of a company is high. IN MY OPINION, if people truly looked at the numbers and realized that they just need to hold because they sold more shares than exist the price of the stock will have to go up because they need people to sell. The problem is people get emotional and watch the stock all day go down with manipulative tactics and they bail for thousand plus loss after just buying in a few days earlier, totally disregarding their initial reason for buying and forgetting that if more positive news comes out that it could send it back to their very buy in price. The problem is people forget this and fold at a loss and the vicious hf cycle continues. If only blockchain would be incorporated on the market to truly keep it fair."
"As of today, MARK is #16 out of hundredson the fintel short squeeze list with ascore of 90.17I'm not sharing this because I believe MARK couldactually squeeze. That concept is tossed around waytoo liberally by us retail investors. But it's worth sharingbecause these heavily shorted, high squeeze potentialplays generally tend see big momentum swings.Sentiment changes almost weekly and volumeincreases and we see big spikes followed by big dips.This is all very good news for us bag holders that justwant to make our money back and get the hell out ofthis trade! It's definitely a glimmer of hope and evenmore reason to hold as opposed to selling for a loss.We will eventually make our money back."
Pre market monday 4$+
back to 6 next week
30 $ target today
Averaged down my position this morning from 4.3 to 2.72Holding long.
how is this not exploding!!!!!!!
"If news is fake then market watch ,zacks,reddits,and other similar should be all banned from reporting any news. Market Watch stated we will see 8 fold. Gain on Mark stock tomorrow. If false news then we need to censor all false news."
Should I buy pre-market or at open?
"For those wondering, this is running because of the CEO’s relationship with the DWAC CEO. The chart here is also identical to PHUN’s chart from yesterday before it ran to $20 today."
Wow $BRPM acquisition of FAZE CLAN valuation 1 billion currently X5 current share price… once $DWAC $PHUN $MARK run this will be next
