"Everyone is talking about temperature detection and masks. Who is one of the market leader, with big names as Wynn resorts and China Mobile, in making sure that rules are followed? That’s mark. Sharecare’s stake of 5% is more than their current marketcap. Everyone is talking about the health services platform. See the big merger between the 2 companies today valued closer to 20 billion. Mark was at 4 usd few weeks ago it’s going to cross 2 digits within weeks. Cheers"
"hi honey Jonathan, we are ok with loosing money."
"Anyone knows why few months ago the Sharecare valuation was $3.9 billion, therefore MARK's 4% of that was about $160 mil... but now that SHCR is trading, it has Market cap of $350 mil only? Even if SHCR share was $15 (double what is now) market cap would be $700 mil for SHCR. What happened to the $3.9 bil valuation of Sharecare analysts were estimating ? Am I missing something ?"
"Remark is doing great, although I think it is still well under the radar. Iit is unfortunate that there is only one analyst that follows Remark with a rating of ""Buy"". I think that is a problem.I think it safe to say that Remark's earnings per share will be in the 'plus' side of the ledger for 2020. 3rd quarter net income of $4.4 million.. earnings of $.04 a share which beat the projected earnings of -$04 by $.08 The 4th quarter income (pre- announcement) of $4.7 million.. the projected earnings for the 4th is for a -$.03. Total projected revenue for fiscal year 2020 is +$10.0 million. Of note, Remark's total cash/ total debt are a wash.. other Yahoo ""Statistics"", miniscule #'s.With all this, current business is robust & growing well in China & with hitching a ride with Hewlett Packard marketing AI, & Remark is on record for stock repurchasing of up to $30 million. I am thinking 2021 will be a great year.This is the interesting 2021 Remark scenario that will present. In Ton's prior post.. ""MARK should be able to cash out their 4.5% stake for around 180 million"". I find Ton's post to be $ factually correct.But does one realize that 4.5% ShareCare IPO $numbers, $180 million, completely shatter everything/ anything I posted above.What am I missing here? Is my simple correlation in error? Or, Is this a rocket? Only one analyst on board with a token ""Buy"" rating!"
"Wow, just waiting for this slope to end and I'm in. The slope is creating a perfect opportunity to buy when it ends. Watch carefully! Remark has remarkable A.I. developments in store."
SEC is aware and is looking into stock manipulation for a coordinated short attack on Remark.
Hopefully now that options calls are done Remark will put out good announcements to drive stock values up to next Monday June 29th earnings call. I would only hope what others have stated on sales forecasts is true if not better. With covid spikes I would think there would be many sales opportunities
Mark is going to slowely go up. You will not get it much lower than this. This is a steal right now. Going up soon.
"Remark’s CEO was seen at the Washington national stadium taking selfie. On this Thursday MLB baseball game is about to commence there and Dr. Fauci will be there too. Players are required to do temp screening regularly. Our CEO’s presence there makes me speculate that Remark cameras will be installed there. If that is the case, we’ll get huge coverage on this Thursday! 5 usd per share is just weeks away! Cheers"

This stock is worth more than the current share price based on the ownership of Sharecare alone.
"I believe people underestimate this company. It’s mostly because they don’t understand how to perceive it — it isn’t some thermal camera maker.It’s KanKan AI (2017 #1 tech award) that can be applied to Any and All cameras, not just thermal. They’re selling about 1.6billion $ of their equity in Sharecare (why would they do this ). Think. Purchase Orders? Contracts? Workforce? Programming development? How is it beneficial to sell a for-sure investment versus issuing more shares or borrowing from bank?What ReMARK is, is an AI learning machine that’s implemented into any camera devices. Facial, thermal, ID recognition. Cars, Robots, Buildings, Homes, Phones.... Think of Terminator 1 where he has that Computer Programming vision. That’s ReMARKs end game. "

"The revaluation of ReMark Holdings that is underway is appropriate in the context of the changed business landscape/opportunity arising from COVID-19. The value of MARK’s 4% interest in ShareCare has appreciated; perhaps dramatically, if one takes note of the 80% appreciation in publically traded TelaDoc Health (TDOC) since January as consumers move (perhaps permanently) to more of an on-line experience for a larger portion of their medical needs. ShareCare wouldn’t release MARK from its lock-up and sell its interest in a private transaction last fall and that will likely end up being a good thing for MARK even though it has resulted in additional MARK share dilution in the last six months.MARK’s thermal imaging equipment (temperature monitoring and facial recognition systems used for much of the last year in selected Chinese schools) appears to have found a home in the U.S. based o MARK’s press release earlier this week (finally) and images of its equipment on the Company’s Twitter page. Recent photos of and articles in the local press regarding what the Company states is MARK’s equipment in the Haywood Mall in Greenville, SC provide anecdotal evidence of the interest in MARK’s equipment. This afternoon, it was reported by trading site https://twitter.com/StanTradingMan/status/1258078596750606337 that a Wynn representative confirmed that they were working with ReMark Holdings, at least in its Las Vegas casinos. It is worth noting that the Haywood Mall in SC belongs to Simon Property Group (SPG), the largest shopping mall and retail center owner in the US. MARK’s valuation YTD gives particular weight to its ability to remain a going concern and does not reflect the upside associated with MARK striking contracts with leading US enterprises like Wynn and Simon Property that presumably are so concerned about making their venues safer for their clientele that they probably willing to put up the cash that MARK requires to build and deploy the systems. This outcome would be even more beneficial to the perpetually cash-strapped MARK. COVID-19 has made certain of MARK’s products relevant to a far larger commercial audience with great immediacy that is difficult to ignore. Similarly, the value of its investment in ShareCare has been re-priced in a very favorable way in the last quarter and the level of investor and strategic interest in telemedicine has also increased….which leads me to believe that the timetable for a ShareCare’s IPO or strategic sale has been or will be pushed up to capitalize on the favorable valuation."
The video released on Twitter this morning clearly shows REMARK AI at 54-55 seconds. The casino deals are 100% legit.
good question. Why doesn't the street know about Remarks Business untethered to Sharecare. Weak answer.This has been a problem since I bought in 2017. Can you say CEO?
I won't sell even if earnings miss. The AI is still in VERY early stages. AI is also one of the hottest upcoming markets...up there with electric vehicles. Strong Buy for $MARK.Spread the word on Discord!
I expect Sharecare to double over the next year to an $8 Billion market cap. That will give Remark access to $360 million in liquid assets. They will never need to raise more thus no dilution.
"Interesting action the past few trading days. The future looks strong, with Sharecare and their AI cameras gaining traction this can hit over $3 in a couple months."
"Compare this Ambarella, simailar tech massive potential an wasy multi bagger"
management expects KanKan to generate more than $50 million in net revenue. Raised guidance good job management almost doubled previous guidance. That is what we were looking for
"Earnings around the corner with more and more hard evidence that $MARK is partnering with some big companies. I like the price action and pullback from $2.50ish, all signs point to a healthy situation and a lot of positive new about to come out on the 28th of May"
"The lack of specificity regarding the identity of, and contract terms associated with, MARK’s new AI clients notwithstanding, the single most important piece of information on last evening’s call was that MARK has paid off the MGG loan and that all liens against its ShareCare investment have been eliminated. ShareCare is the basis of MARK’s intrinsic value and supports a share price well in excess of MARK’s current share price, without assigning any value to its AI business. There is insufficient public information to accurately quantify the value of ShareCare per MARK share owing to limited current data on ShareCare’s valuation and we not know an accurate share count for MARK until they release Q2 2020 results (presumably in August), if the deal with MGG was completed yesterday, as stated on the call. I am assuming that MARK’s current share count is currently closer to 75MM shares rather than the 55MM shares last reported in September. Telehealth valuations have exploded (+50-70%) in the wake of the Covid pandemic and it is reasonable to expect that ShareCare’s valuation is now a lot closer to the $10B valuation that Jeff Arnold, CEO, identified last year as his targeted valuation for an IPO. A ShareCare valuation of $8B and MARK’s last reported 4.5% interest in ShareCare against an assumed current MARK share count of 75MM shares suggests that MARK’s ShareCare interest is worth $4.80 per MARK share. A lower valuation for ShareCare will result in a lower MARK valuation….. but in any realistic scenario….. given ShareCare’s sales, growth and last year’s VC rounds, MARK’s investment in ShareCare more than covers its current share price of $2.50. MARK’s AI business clearly has more tangible near-term value in the wake of Covid and MARK’s recent and prospective new business wins…but the Company’s disconcerting lack of detail on these issues last night continues to make it difficult to value this opportunity …but one cannot ignore its potential and some of the endorsements it has received to date. Future announcements of contract wins (like Wynn) should shed additional light on this opportunity, which can be viewed as more of a high and recurring margin software business rather than a hardware business). As we await the release of the 10K, it is worth noting that the historical information (ie: cash balances at 12.31.19 and 2019 revenues, etc) is now very outdated and not informative in terms of evaluating MARK on a go-forward basis. Hopefully there will be a substantive MDA discussion for material events since the end of the year which will provide more useful commentary in evaluating MARK’s investment potential. In the near-term, MARK has several positive catalysts now that the MGG debt and lien issue has been resolved. Specifically, (i) it might now be able to sell its ShareCare interest to a third party (MARK purportedly had multiple bidders last September but couldn’t complete a full or partial sale because of MGG’s liens on the asset), (ii) ShareCare is undoubtedly a lot closer to doing an IPO given much higher valuations and a robust IPO environment for businesses with ShareCare’s characteristics and addressable market, and (iii) announcements or even MARK’s confounding Tweets regarding new AI contract wins…..will support higher MARK share prices."

"Market cap per Yahoo is incorrect. It is based on the old shares outstanding number. The shares outstanding number as per the most recent MARK’s SEC filing is 99 million. So, the market cap now is about 210 million. Once retail investors start to realize that and once Aspire start selling their shares (probably already started) it will drop another 20-30% easily."

Not holding any shares but awesome job for you long time Mark investors. Its been a tough 7 months but its looking good. I wish you all wealth and good luck. Way too hold strong
Well that was disappointing
Just being honest here. I’ve put a lot of money in this stock cuz I believed that this will go up more than expected and I realize everyone wants to make a quick buck here and there but just look at the potential if you just let it go higher so we could all make a substantial profit. I invested so much and I’m not willing to lose all my money. I believe that this company will be the next big thing. Time to buy the dip and make thousand of dollars this month. Just read what company will do to protect the public at the same time we make lots of money. God bless and good luck!
why the diwnfall today?? Anybody ??
Huge news coming up especially positive earnings GET IN OR GET LEFT BEHIND
"Observations on MARK: Resolution of Near-Term Challenges open Path to Higher Valuation.MARK remains in default on $11.9MM of debt owed to MGG which delivered its notice of acceleration to the Company on March 16. The 30 day period to cure the default ends tomorrow. MARK is likely able to meet this obligation under the terms of its $30MM Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital Fund (signed April 9, 2020); however, it comes at the cost of additional dilution for shareholders, particularly in the context of MARK’s intrinsic value. MARK is also in the process of resolving the risk that it is delisted from the NASDAQ for failure to maintain a $1.00 per share valuation for a ninety day period. The requirement for curing the notice of delisting is for MARK’s shares to close above $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive trading days, before, by my estimate, the 22nd of May. The resolution of these two controversies remove two important catalysts which have been central to the short seller thesis and is likely to contribute to short covering. The Company still has to finish its 2019 audit and it is unclear to me; Covid notwithstanding, why this has taken so long since the sale of the Company’s Vegas.com was completed in May 2019. The good news is that MARK’s auditor has not resigned and the Company’s past audits have been qualified with “going concern” risk language, so at this point the auditor’s opinion letter can’t get much worse….unless they refuse to provide an opinion…which should already have been announced if it was going to happen. As we get closer to MARK’s restated Q4 and FY 2019 10-K filing and update call on Thursday, May 28….market focus will shift to the contents and substance of the Company’s narrative regarding the status of its KanKan AI business with particular emphasis on names of clients and the size of contacts and the implications for twelve month revenues and cash flow. There has been a lot of speculation on these issues in the past three weeks, much of it informed by the Company’s own tweets, which is a business practice that many appropriately believe hurts the organization’s credibility. MARK management needs to be clear and precise on their call on the 28th about the status, size, and duration of contracts (even if NDAs prevent them from naming clients) and provide investors with 12 month revenue and margin guidance, Open-ended statements about the scope of the thermal imaging and AI opportunity (as they have done on past calls when talking about the China business) without reference to real contracts is insufficient given the Company’s Twitter teases about Wynn, Simon Property Group, (Disney or was there a different source?) et al. The call needs to expand upon, not regurgitate, the substance of the Company’s rare and effective official statement of April 30. It is hard to know the number of outstanding MARK shares at the moment but reasonable to assume that it is markedly higher than the 55.1MM last reported on September 30, 2019. Nevertheless, the value of MARK’s investment in ShareCare (which remains impaired by MarK’s default on the MGG loan) has appreciated by more (based on the revaluation of the telehealth sector which is up 60-80% with the outbreak of Covid-19) than the increase in MARK’s share count (which has a share cap of 20% under the Aspire Agreement). The value of the ShareCare investment (once unencumbered by MGG’s lien) likely supports a MARK share price that is 2-3X MARK’s current share price. The value on the KanKan AI business and any contracts that the Company has secured in the last six months (or will secure in the next six months) is all incremental to the value of MARK. Uncertainties remain over the next several days; however, their resolution and the fact that MARK will own the narrative thereafter (and may actually announce contracts), creates an attractive set-up and demands attention."
I thought sharecare was taking this stock to $16???? The CEO has scammed all the share holders for years. Why are you people giving him your money? At this point you all deserve to lose your money. Its sad but comical at this point. The CEO IS LAUGHING at you all.

"Let's see if we can do a quick back-of-the-napkin calc for fair value of MARK, in light of recent news. Keep in mind that the current market cap for MARK is around 350 million.1) Sharecare IPO. They are in talks to go public via a merger with SPAC named FCAC, at a preliminary valuation of 4B. However, given how SPACs have been trading recently, I believe when all is said and done it will be closer to 5B. Meaning MARK's 4.5% stake will be worth around 200M. That leaves us with 150M - that's how much the market is currently valuing MARK's business after excluding the cash pile they'll get when they sell their stake in Sharecare. Is 150M a lot? Let's see...b) Fourth quarter revenues came in at almost 5 million. If we assume similar growth trajectory in 2021 that would give us projected 2021 revenues of roughly 20-25 million, meaning MARK's AI business is currently trading at 5-6X revenues, which is pretty cheap, imho. High-growth companies in an industry like this should be trading at minimum 10X revenues, and possibly as high as 20X. Hence, conservatively I would estimate FV of MARK to be at least 450-500 million, i.e. roughly 40% upside from here."
"Looks like most people here are either completely delusional, or don’t know what 10-K is and where to find it, or just can’t think logically. Over the past couple months the company sold 45 million shares for $30 million. Think about it. They only needed 11 million to pay down their debt, and another 5 million or so for their working capital needs. But what did they do instead? They sold all the shares they could per the agreement with Aspire! All $30 million worth of shares. Why do that?! If they had all those contracts they claim they have, and if the monetization of Sharecare is pretty much a done deal, why sell all those shares now at an average price of 70 cents?! Why not hold onto them and sell later at a much higher price? The answer is simple: because they know something you don’t. They know what the true situation with contracts is, and they know what their chances are to monetize Sharecare. Think about it. Management’s actions speak for themselves. You’ve been warned. Disclosure: no position."
"Mark this post. Confirmed through my source that Sharecare IPO is being fast tracked for late 2020-early 2021. This is huge for Mark. Earnings is exciting, but the IPO is where the real value is finally unlocked!!!"
Slowly making its way up !

"DIRECT QUOTE FROM DISNEYLAND NEWS SOURCE: ""Disney recently added a new company to their vendor list, Remark Holdings. The company makes AI thermal scanners that are being purchased by Las Vegas casinos, large corporations, and event venues.""Link: https://www.micechat.com/258995-disneyland-update-weeks-not-months/"
"First-hand confirmation the MARK thermal technology is being used in the One Hotel and Residences in South Beach. Management of the premises stated they are very satisfied with the technology which has been in position for more than two weeks. Most importantly, the decision to use MARK was not made at the property level. Instead, the decision was made at the “corporate” level by either Host Hotels and Resorts, the $9.3B REIT run by owner of the Richard Marriott (former Chairman of Marriott Corp.) or by Barry Sternlicht’s, Starwood Property Trust (STWD, $4.5B market cap) which was described as the manager of the property. Recall that Sternlicht’s HOT was acquired by Marriott (MAR) in 2016 so there may be synergies between the two entities. All of these organizations own or manage a large number of hotel and resort-related properties with a far larger physical footprint than the Wynn or the LV gaming companies that have been the object of speculation of late. HST, MAR and STWD all presumably have need of thermal technology like that employed in the One Hotel and the One provides an important basis for evaluating the efficacy of MARK’s product offering. I have not yet seen any of these companies mentioned as potential MARK clients. Malls owned by Simon Property Group also appear to be a potentially fertile area for on the ground due diligence for those that are interested in MARK. Although disappointed by the significant increase in outstanding shares from September 2019 (55MM shs) to present (99MM shs), it is not surprising given the lack financial flexibility and cash crunch that has defined MARK for the last three years, and particularly the last six months. There was little new information in the 10-K that had not been previously reported so recent alarm regarding the Company’s financial condition reflects a lack of familiarity with MARK. Mark’s intrinsic value continues to be supported by its 4.5% ownership interest in Sharecare, which is now unencumbered by McCourt. The announcement of a Sharecare IPO (an increasingly probable and proximate event for a number of reasons) represents perhaps the single most important catalyst for MARK’s valuation. A lot of attention has been paid of late to thermal announcements regarding individual properties (ie: the LV Raiders) potentially using MARK’s thermal technology. The announcement of an S-1 filing with the SEC for a Sharecare IPO will have a far larger effect on MARK’s share price, as will the announcement of a contract with a group list HST or SPG.Like many, I was disappointed by the lack of substantive management commentary regarding clients on the conference call and I was not persuaded by the NDA rationale. I expect them to do a better job on the Q2 earnings call. Bottom-line MARK has more value today than it has at any point in the last decade and COVID has given a Company that was in an extremely vulnerable financial position and singularly dependent on its Sharecare investment a new lease on life as a going concern with a potential path to ultimately becoming profitable or of interest to a better capitalized strategic partner."
"NewInvestor has a proper name at least. Why would anyone listen to anyone's advice with a screen name like that? I think it's a joke, right?"
Here is the letter from Wynn Casinos. It specifically mentions Remark. Note the date. It's Q2https://www.casino.org/news/remark-holdings-emerges-from-obscurity-on-wynn-deal-rumors/
"Two ways to play this, and basically you need to decide in the next 24 hours. At this point, if you came for a quick buck of youre risk tolerance is low, it’s time to sell. Strong possibility of a sell off into earnings call tomorrow. If this company has been hyping this up and doesn’t have anything real, this is gonna tank. However, if this is real, if they are ahead of the game with their tech. If they do have some of these contracts.... any price you get in at today will look like pennies in a few weeks. I don’t have the answer. No one on this board does. But that’s where we are "
"Good quarterly call. Great participation by investors on Q&A. I counted the CEO mentioning 3 times about purchasing stock back. The stock is so undervalued. They talked about if it was private they would likely have a $billion dollar valuation. You can clearly see they are at an inflection point. They also made it crystal clear they can't sell their stock in Share Care for a year or after it holds $12.00 for 30 days, but most importantly they don't want the sell their stock because Sharecare has a tremendous future. (I bought Sharecare during the call also) They are working with several financial institutions to borrow against their stock. That will help them shore up their balance sheet and give them plenty of operating capital. In my opinion, this company is on the verge of finally breaking out. I bought more during the conference call and it's already up 12%. I am in this one for the long haul. It should easily be a $5 dollar stock now and on its way to $10-$30. When they kick into rat gear lookout, I love this technology because it is so adaptable to every market opportunity. This is a stock to own during these unpredictable times. If you haven't listened to the conference call, take the time to listen to the replay. You can hear the enthusiasm in their voices. Toll-Free Replay Number: 844.512.2921. Good luck everybody. A little more chatter on this thread would be nice."
"A few things that stuck out during call and bothers me: (1) CEO said they are under strict NDAs and can't reveal installation clients, however, when asked about social media strategy, CEO admitted they purposely make posts to keep shareholders informed. So he admitted he violated the very NDAs he hinds behind. (2) Wouldn't reveal current cash position or total number of outstanding shares. (3) Clearly stated he is only salesman and they rely on unrealistic referrals from other clients. This is a tiny company with little in the way of resources or assets to scale. It's value is in whatever Sharecare stake it holds, but even Sharecare is in litigation with them and doesn't want to issue shares to a Remark subsidiary. This team doesn't pass musturd and the 10-k tomorrow should be revealing."
Finally bought my 750 shares. Great price after bottoming now. This is going to be fun. Watch and see. Huge sales and revenue growth last few months. Only good news lately. I am betting next quarter EPS will beat expectations. We will see $2 in no time.
July 6th conference call .. they will release Q1 earnings which I think it will be the highest profit in the MARK history.. and what they expect for Q2 ....Q2 almost finish they knows the numbers At least $6 on MondayThumps up if u agree 
around 70 million when Sharecare shares are materialized or am i wrong??should bring this to the moon. i am in for the long run.
Does anyone know if they are reporting earnings tomorrow?I have been looking around but can’t really find anything.Thanks!
NEWS JUST IN: governor states casinos cannot open until THEY HAVE STRICT SAFELY PROTOCOLS which means MARK. Wynn leading the way meaning way more business.

"Finally, I am very pleased to announce Board approval for a stock repurchase program. The buyback plan demonstrates the Board's confidence in our future and commitment to delivering value to all of our shareholders. We do not believe the current share price reflects the underlying value of Remark's assets or the progress made in our core AI business."" $mark"
"MARK is trading down because of all the day traders being disappointed that the annual report and news didn't come this week. The company is releasing news and annual report on May 28th. Therefore, as the day and swing traders take their funds out to trade elsewhere, the shorts can take charge for a little while and make money. Anyone trying to time stock price by the minute or hour or day will always be killed if they are wrong or get trapped in a bad trade. The bottom line with this stock is to buy for the momentum going into the 28th and hopefully great news on several fronts. First, maybe an update on the current valuation of its golden asset - the 4.5 to 5% stake in the private digital healthcare company Sharecare. I fully expect the annual report will show a valuation of the holding in Sharecare as of Dec 31, 2019, in the $164 million to $188 million at approximately 4.7% share of the estimated Sharecare value of $3.5 to $4 billion based on the most recent (2018) private transaction values of investments made by big-time players into Sharecare. It's fairly easy to believe that Sharecare is now valued in the $6 billion range now, especially after Covid-19. That would put MARK's stake at $288 million. Secondly, I expect the Therma and Security business to disclose some major wins and a significant increase in revenue projections for this division. All this means the stock is severely undervalued and must correct to the appropriate valuation of the company. This stock should double or triple in value from today's close on or shortly after may 28th...IMO"
Awesome day. we are on our way. congrats longs.
Earnings look to beat expectations I believe with much higher revenue. The stock price is at a huge discount right now.Here's news today.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/remark-holdings-delays-10-q-expects-significantly-higher-revenue-271629139565
"For all the uninformed and lazy day traders that don't bother with doing any homework, the AI technology system offered is not simply about an infrared camera. Remark's Smart Monitor technology was upgraded in February and rolled out in early March 2020. The existing KanKanAI technology added thermal detection, including body temperature detection, and improved its facial recognition capability to include compliance with public sanitary regulations such as the wearing of protective masks. In essence, as confirmed in its presentation to the Las Vegas Police Department, the facial recognition can work on people even if they are wearing a mask. This is a big deal for effective monitoring. Also, a company may use an infrared camera with Mark's technology. Including FLIR cameras. That is also a big deal. ""Remark Holdings' Tao said that their technology is accurate at reading someone's body temperature in a crowd within 0.3 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite claiming such high levels of accuracy, Tao also added that Remark is ""hardware agnostic"" and customers can use any kind of thermal imaging camera they'd like."" Moreover, for all those who are trying to guess what contracts have been added....let's just say that all providers in this space have seen a significant increase in business and demand for clients from small to large. Moreover, many of the systems may be installed without a long-term commitment or contract. It could be no contract usage or subscription-based arrangement that is not worthy of mention until the report and installations are revealed. Finally, and most important, is no matter what is happening with the KanKan AI business, this stock is severely undervalued because it's holding of Sharecare is worth more the double to triple the current share price. These are the reasons you buy and hold through the May 28th annual report and update on the business."
"I was long too, but dreaming and wishing is not an investment strategy. This company is way overvalued now that we know the real number of shares outstanding and market cap it's trading at now. The company is small time with very limited resources to capitalize on this opportunity, no sales team, can't fulfill orders according to its own CEO, and a management team and CEO who hides information about dilution and lawsuits. Sorry, but I'm going short and MARK is going down."
"Just a reminder...Companies that have Mark listed as a supplier: Wynn, MGM, Disney, Hilton, Ford, Caesar’s, Avis, American Airlines, delta, anheuser Busch, United,Southwest, Marriot, Harrahs... all confirmed, and these aren’t small companies. Gotta be somethin to it"

(Not counting any contracts due to COVId19)2.- 2,000 camaras expected to be installed thsi Q1 based on size of contracts with China mobile and schools. That represents 2,000 x 20,000 (Selling it at a discount because of volume) = 40M in Rev 8X all 2019 Rev. 3.- Share Price will explode in two weeks. "
"Remark Holdings Inc. reported that they could start their shipping and deploying of products from its family of AI thermal solutions. For more updates, check this out: http://psce.pw/UnderTheRadarStocks"

"How did you vote?3.Approve an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock to 300,000,000.BOARD RECOMMENDATION: FORFORAGAINSTABSTAIN"
"Remark Holdings, Inc. primarily focuses on the development and deployment of AI-based solutions for businesses and software developers. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved 60.4% north over the past 60 days. The company’s shares have gained a superb 515.3% over the past three months. It’s expected earnings growth rate for the next quarter is 50%. Most recent article about MARK. Covid-19 cases have risen in 27 states so far. New York, Connecticut, New Jersey begin to quarantine people visiting from high risk states such as the 27 listed. Disney world pushed back open date again. Europe open for travel but bans American travel currently. MARK is a strong play towards opening in the future for many businesses. This technology will continue to grow and help with Covid-19 resurfacing. Earnings will be better then expected due to high volume of orders of this tech. just my opinion do your DD to see if you see value."
50 day moving average is 2.07. 200 day moving average is .95.... 1.30 has been a strong bottom so buy with confidence that after conference call in early Aug this is back over $2 and depending how good the call is we could be looking to push to $3.

MARK It’s not a sophisticated stock . Real ones know Mark will be worth double digits . Bunch of so called penny collector’s are in it for few hundred bucks . This is a real investment. It’s a rare opportunity. Don’t get to excited and Don’t panic 
"I was long MARK until several primary concerns from the call and 8-K filed yesterday. The filing made it clear that the company expects massive dilution and needs to authorize 300 million shares to cover outstanding warrants that are exercisable. So we know it's over 100 million shares because that's the number of current shares authorized. Just read the 8k. The statement is clear: ""(y) the effective date of an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock to 300,000,000, and (ii) the exercise price of the CBG Financing Warrants will be reduced by $0.30 per share."" Despite the standstill agreement with CBG, the company MARK acquired, we still don't know how many new warrants and shares may have been issued to pay off the MGG debt and to raise cash to complete that acquisition. These CBG warrants are warrants issued to acquire CBG. Old CBG owners, all in china, want to get paid for the assets they sold. So they want to exercise the warrants now that the Covid-19 opportunity has lifted MARK stock price. The CEO also claimed they have enough cash to last the remainder of the year. Well, where did it come from? From what type of transactions? Debt, Equity, Warrants? They offered zero details. Instead, they referred us to 10-k supposedly coming out today. More importantly, the CEO refused to provide straight answers, including when asked about the Sharecare stake. Again, the CEO referred us to 10-k which he said will show their percentage stake. However, this will not provide us an update for any 2020 transactions affecting the Sharecare stake. They tried to make it sound as if the company is debt-free, however, they failed to mention the recent $1,050,000 judgment entered against the company in Clark County District Court, Nevada, which resulted in a foreign judgment in Delaware. The judgment creditors (all sophisticated politicians and investors in Vegas) are trying to block Sharecare from issuing MARK its shares. Check out the lawsuit filed by ""Remark Holdings SPV, Inc."" a subsidiary of Remark Holdings, Inc., formally Remark Media, Inc. under which name the company actually earned the Sharecare stake. Remark Holdings SPV, Inc. is suing Sharecare to have Sharecare recognize an alleged assignment and transfer of all its Sharecare shares from back in 2015 as it related to the MGG financing agreement. Sharecare and its transfer agent claim it never received any such transfer request and Sharecare has refused to issue these shares to MARK's sub. The judgment creditors are seeking to block the transfer to preserve the only asset that can possibly pay off their judgment. So, the company is not debt-free. The CEO also made clear that they have no sales team or channel development team. He said they are seeking to add a biz dev director. He said that he relies on his personal relationships and an unbelievable 10-15 referrals from each new client. This proves the company has no resources to scale the AI business. CEO also said they have 20 installs of the AI kit and the company is a Saas software company. However, he failed to provide any details on how many paid seats or subscriptions were sold or at what price or terms. Investors need this info to help us understand the actual value of a sale of MARK's AI software. The only value we know is the $25,000 per kit price. With only 20 installs, that is just $500,000 in sales. He seems to pull numbers out of the air to respond to backlog question. He claimed 70-90 but made sure to caution that many do not turn into clients because ""they need to make sure they can fulfill the order."" Again, showing inability to scale and win business. So the AI business is negligible at best. Finally, the China Mobile business is very suspicious as the CEO indicated a lot of the alleged revenue will be written off. This questionable business is one of the reasons behind the annual report filing delay. I don't like the fact that the CEO wouldn't answer questions with straight answers. I don't like them hiding behind late filings. Nobody knows what has gone on behind the scenes or what type of transactions or dilution has occurred in 2020 yet. For all these reasons, I'm out and don't believe this valuation will last long. This company value rests solely on the value of any Sharecare stake the company has left. However, we don't know what that is and won't be able to go off old information like the 10-k. We need the CEO to tell us and make real press releases instead of playing games with NDAs yet posting all over the internet that they are in places allegedly before the NDA is signed. This stock will be a penny stock again...very soon...unless they have maintained a significant stake in Sharecare. Sorry longs, but this CEO and company has to show their true business and prospects. They seem to be propping up the stock to get all their legacy buddies out."
"Unlike most other commenting I'll try to give my clear and sober thoughts on the MARK-stock today.Exciting thing is that the market is closed monday, so it might be a little more volatile today. I still expect a similar day again, just like yesterday and the day before that. A little up, at little down, might close in green, might close in red, but it's not going to blast neither up or down.It would be nice to see the MARK-stock test the 1.92-1.93 again today. It seemed like it met a lot of resistance around that point yesterday. Next week Tuesday and Wednesday is the only two days before ER. I believe the trading will be massive. Remark Holdings might smash out positive signs during the weekend.They might be siltent. It could go either way. I still believe this stock is above 2 dollars before thursday. Note that I have been in since 0.400 and I sold most of my stocks with great profit and kept some to gamble, so I am home safe."
"Looking for share buyback deal, announcement from collaboration with HP, additional revenue growth announcements, more AI developments on the Twitter page...there's a lot to look forward to!"

"From an Investor's Place article today: ""Remark currently has about 9.5 million shares of Sharecare (NASDAQ:SHCR), a telehealth company. According to my calculations, that stake is worth over $71 million as of the morning of Aug. 30. With MARK stock trading at a market capitalization of $130 million, investors are valuing its business at just (roughly) $60 million. Remark has not specified when it plans to monetize some or all of its stake in Sharecare."""
Not sure people here understand. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH 2019 EARNINGS. It has everything to do with the contracts they signed for thermal AI tech THIS YEAR for Covid reopenings. It’s not rocket science. Rofl this is hilarious watching some comments
Is this a dead stock?
This is a $6 Stock with just the ownership in Sharecare. Easily a $100 Stock in two years.
"So let me get this straight, the market is tanking because of Corona virus fear, and Mark follows the market down with a product positioned to keep the consumer safe from Covid? Is this the twilight zone ?"
This went up 22% in German stock market Monday - Frankfurt. It will bounce way up thru earnings. I’m buying more in the AM for sure. Anything under $10 will be looked on as a steal in the near future
cheapest AI share hold for long term
Any contracts on their way? any info on that?
"Who are commenting or spreading negativity on MARK shares, they are the first persons to buy the shares when market start."
Read the conference call. What encourages me are the possibilities of their sells and the volume on their options.
"Remark Holdings shown at 28 seconds in for Wynn Las Vegas reopening on June 4, 2020"

$MARK @RemarkHoldings may be releasing some preliminary news on deployments of mass thermal scanning throughout USA after close. Could see surge in extended trading as we learn more details on new clients. Rumor of 85 new clients (unconfirmed/to be verified by 5/28). #research
Beat EPS expectations by 1¢. Not bad with revenue steadily increasing. A company that can win from a pandemic is a good stock to own!
"Sacramento CA news just reported on the Hard Rock Casino in Wheatland reopening tomorrow and showed similar equipment taking temperatures and pictures of customers. Remark or not more and more companies will be using similar equipment - and there is so much Govt $ being handed out that there will be plenty to go around. I sold half my holdings today but will buy back tomorrow and hold for a few months - will add on any pullbacks but I can see this as a $5 or even $10 stock on speculation alone, with more upside potential than downside risk at this level..."
Expected this to be at $ 5 or 6 at this point. however it went down again. It is time this company meets its expectations.
"Think about this logically. Their AI tech for thermal scans is the way of the covid future. Businesses like Wynn resorts won't have someone at the door checking everyone's temperature. But with this tech they can, and can check masses of people easily. Look forward not just to this quarter or the next. Look much forward like all the robinhood investors are doing with Tesla right now. Covid cases are on the rise. Logically our world will need technology like this to detect infected people quickly and effectively. Invest with the future in mind."
So right now you can by Remark at 50% less than CP Group worth 40 billion. Since CP Group bought Remark has announced many new contracts. During this conference call management addressed many if not all questions or concerns. Management gave insight into how revenue is generated and how it will it will be recurring income. Management also raised guidance on the Kankan by 60% going from $30 million to $50 million and also raised guidance for VDC. They also said they expect the Kankan to do $150 million in revenue over next 2 years. How is this stock down? Current market cap is around value of Sharecare and cash. Management you did a great call today.

"The fundamentals are still quite strong. Unlimited potential for this company. It is the future of the security system. I believe Remark will defeat all the obstacles and make us shareholders happy again. The CEO is a smart business man, he knows what he is doing."
"Just saw Mark cameras and system set-up at Hudson Yard's office on CNBC, and they mentioned over 30 devices at the office."
Is MARK under pressure because its a Chinese company?
"Looking at ambrella, MARK can easily do a 10 to 20X and still be cheap"
"Disney recently added a new company to their vendor list, Remark Holdings. The company makes AI thermal scanners that are being purchased by Las Vegas casinos, large corporations, and event venues.Remark’s website states: “Traditional thermal imagers and temperature devices require a human operator to scan each patron as they walk through a security point. The close proximity creates an uncomfortable intrusive experience for customers and employees in addition to causing delays at point of entry.” The site further describes their product as solving that problem: “Our solutions provide touch-free access control and monitoring, as well as accurate temperature measurement and the ability to scan as many as 120 people per minute, a rate that is approximately 10 times faster than manual checks. Our solutions also filter out non-human heat sources and provide security personnel with real-time alerts with photo identification.”The Remark scanners would make the process largely invisible to guests. Only those who show a high temperature would be pulled aside for additional screening. With enough of these scanners, guests entering the resort wouldn’t need to stop at all, except for baggage check, which we hope will be speeded up with the use of conveyor belt scanners (as Universal Studios uses) rather than manual checking by hand."
Why does the stock continue to lose value?
"Besides the obvious exploding demand for infared therma imaging solutions that will benefit MARK if it is capturing marketshare, the real news that everyone should be looking for is the potential announcement of the monitization by sale of all or part of its Sharecare interest. Based on the last transcript after Q-3 2019, management answered extensive questions from analyasts regarding the potential sale of its interest in Sharecare. Management stated it had identified a buyer interested in buying its position before the Quest Diagnostics led round of financing and Wlamart deals in the works at Sharecare. This led to even more parties interested that must be vetted. Now, with the Covid-19 year of change in the world, I expect that interest and possibly a buyer has been ideinfied and deal may be close to definitive agreement by now. That will be the best news coming after the market close on May 28th. The MARK stake in Sharecare is likely worth anywhere between $150 million to $250,000 alone. Don't worry about all the negative unfounded and baseless comments and posts made my short interest parties on this board, other boards, and tweeter. They take peices of information and turn it into misinformation and false claims to solict a panic sell response to profit from it. Don't fall for this weak hands. As a lifelong researcher and paralegal, I've reviewed all the transactions regarding MARK's Sharecare transactions and all claims found in corporation filings in Delaware and court filings in Clark County District Court in Nevada. Yes, I can confirm that a judgment was enter in a case by some powerful investors, politicians, etc...for $1,050,000 in favor of the investors. However, it was an administrative deafult for failure to respond to the lawsuit timely. It was not won on the merits of the case. Nevertheless, this judgement is nothing in comparision to the value of the company based solely on its Sharecare equity. As for the lawsuit mentioned by fake news shorters, MARK did file suit in Delaware against Sharecare to force the transfer agent to issue share certificates to Remark Holdings SPV, Inc. a subsidiary of Remark Holdings, Inc., as per the assignment made back in 2015 as part of the financing agreement entered in Septemeber 2015. The judgement for $1 million is filed as foreign judgement in Delaware and the investors are trying to stop the transfer from 2015 to preserve assets to force payment of the judgement in that case. Again, even if an agreement is reach whereby the Sharecare shares are valued and $1 million is set-aside to pay this default judgment, no big deal as its small patotoes in comparison to the value of the Sharecare shares held by MARK. MARK also has right to appeal or ask for rehearing of the judgment case on the merits if it can show good cause as to why it failed to respond to the suit timely. So, don't beleive these fake news guys bending the facts and truth in their favor. This lawsuit is fairly standard stuff. None of this changes the fact that MARK holds a significant stake in Sharecare and likely has found a buyer for it or is close to closing a sale of part or all of it. Maybe we hear somehting on it during the upcoming scheduled call this Thursday after the market. I remain bullish. The Sharecare stake places a solid foundation and floor on the value or MARK despite whatever the KanKan and thermal technolgoy division does or doesn't announce."
"FROM MAY TRANSCRIPT: While the COVID-19 virus has certainly affected the world economy in a very dramatic fashion, the RemarkAI platform that we have built over the last 7 years have allowed us to be positioned favorably against a terrible situation. As they say, we never let a good crisis go to waste. We have a very strong demand and are experiencing quick closings on systems to manage CD-19 issues. While we are under strict NDAs with our customers in terms of disclosing who they are, I can assure you that they are the best-in-class in their industry. And in fact, they are our biggest sales lead generators."
"If this stays under $2 by mid month, I'm buying a lot more...."
"the amount of stupld things shorts say to scare off the little guys. This holds strong above 2,50 because when the news comes before or after market close it will go to 5 USD and you will miss it all. I add every time it goes below 2,60! because soon is the last time we will ever see it again. Just be patient and the reward will come."
Look at the volume; it is double..someone is buying at this price! Hold on to your shares people. We are looking at $5 in next 3 months
"The value of Sharecare that Remark has is upwards of 600 millions dollarsRight now and growing. The stock should be priced at 12 to 15 dollars,almost 10 more the the closing price"
"Stock fam whatever happens from now til $mark announces some news. Just remember my Rain Man analysis:1) $mark has been in the AI software business for years. This is not a random COVID play. 2) They have demonstrated that it's technology is quickly adaptable to unforeseen global security issues like COVID. This is only a COVID play right now because it's software helps with monitoring COVID. 3) This is not just a ""thermal camera"" play. It is for now, but remember it's more than a hot thermal camera stock. 4) I don't personally know the CEO but he's been putting in his time in Vegas presenting marks work to Casinos as a security system. He knows the crowd. The fact that the company was able to quickly adapt to the needs of the pandemic using thermal means the team is brilliant.5) The US got hit hard. No one had COVID lockdown in their 2020 business plans/ financial predictions. Most people are not meeting their 2020 deadlines that they set in 2019. 6) It's been over $10 even before it was a COVID play and the technology has had 2 years to progress.7) I keep seeing ""non invasive temperature checks"" being mentioned in news articles. This means some form of non-human activity. Perhaps some AI/camera action ?8) Imagine they somehow got in with other 7 eleven stores outside Thailand"
"Folks, you need to remove the emotions. This stock was $1.04 TWO days ago. That would be the equivalent of a $50 stock now being at $81. It's had a heck of a run and is simply pausing with some profit-taking. What it is doing today (sideways to slightly lower) is normal for any stock on earnings day. Buy in if you want in and go do something else. Stop watching it. In my opinion, being in Wynn and being on Disney's vendor list, things will be good."
Huge buying opportunity today as remark ticks lower along with broader market. $6 price target coming on next news release.
"I told you early morning; Shorters trying to push, so use the dip to get in if you have faith. Close to breaking 1.92 today, but pushed down again. I hope you used the dip to get it, if you have high hopes.I expect tomorrow to be the same or a little bit better. The closer we get to the 28th, the less shorting we will see.To those of you who is confused by the tweets and no real PR.It might very well be nondisclosures preventing MARK from real PR. We'll find out in a week.My expectations for next week is a steady climb from Monday to Wednesday to around 2-2.25. What happens on the 28th is going to be exciting."
"Facial recognition will be used to detect a fever. this is big for MARK in the age of covid-19 . All public locations will need facial recognition globally, think of the revenue MARK will have."
"I have contacted MARK yesterday with regards to the 200m dilution. The following is their reply;Good morning Mubarak.As we discussed extensively on our recent conference call, we have asked shareholders to AUTHORIZE an additional 200 million shares since we are currently very close to our authorized cap of 100 million shares. This does not mean that we will be ISSUING 200 million shares any time soon. In fact, it took us over 10 years to reach our current authorization of 100 million shares.I hope this clears up any of your confusion.Brian-----------------------------------------------------------------E.

"Today from Brian Harvey re NDA's and MARK...Thank you for reaching out.Yes, I receive calls and emails from investors all day asking about NDAs.By definition, the NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) preclude us from announcing (disclosing) the names of some customers. Many companies do not wish to disclose who they use for security. Our competition generally is subject to these rules also. For instance, I haven’t seen one casino announce who they are using for thermal imaging security. We have several customers in this space and they are all diligent in not allowing their security providers to publicly announce relationships.Additionally, we are careful about saying too much for competitive reasons, but also because when we have put out information, investors (both long and short) have harassed the customers requesting information and deluging them with calls and emails demanding non public information. Since much of our business is coming in from referrals, the actions of these investors could impact our business development efforts.As we move forward with thermal imaging, we are looking to lessen NDA terms in new deals, allowing us to provide information, but we are still early in these efforts.Please let me know if you have any additional questions.Brian----------------------------------------------------------------- E.

Nice new website! https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/remark-holdings-launches-remarkthermalcom-301065938.html
Remarks A.I business is doing more in revenue than any other Ai software product company and will soon have an annual run rate of over $50 million and growing. These are real and growing long term contracts. Remark will be a $50 stock as soon as investors realize what they have.
"I’m tired of listening to ppl complain and whine about this stock. Stocks are not guaranteed to make you money, loss is part of the game sometimes. If you make decision based on emotion, you will have a short stock trading career. There is clearly a reason why they haven’t released anything yet. It’s not bc they don’t have contracts. We know they have them. When they do you will be paid, if you can’t wait go make scalp plays you’ll be much happier."
Stock goes down 1 percent and people are livid because it didn't go up 10 percent based off absolutely nothing. ER is literally 1 week away. Either close the computer or buy more. This thing probably won't do much before then unless a couple tweets with pictures drive the price
Have you seen today's Twitter page?? Big times ahead.
"LOL at panic sellers thinking this is FORD. REMARK will reach $10 within 1 month like it or not. Potential $120 stock, mile long line of investors waiting to buy YOUR share!!"
"For new investors here is the complete summary of WHY YOU SHOULD INVEST IN REMARK: Note, I said last week this will go back to $2 this week guaranteed. Next week it WILL go to $3-$5 guarenteed. Remark used to be a $120 per share company. They did silly websites, mediocre things BUT had great business minds. Fast forward to 2020, REMARK has reinvented themselves, grown up quickly and taken things very serious now. With the same great business mind, REMARK has a dip in SHARECARE which is absolutely worth investing in itself already.. but the REAL HOLY GRAIL is that they have a flagship technology KANKAN (tech winner award) and THERMAL SCANNERS that are absolutely NEEDED to reopen up the WORLD. The world is planning on opening up, every restaurant, mall, airport, factories, stadiums, concert venues you name it. REMARK has that technology that lets the WORLD open up again, so we can have a safe and normal life like before. REMARK is also backed by BLACKROCK, VANGUARD and the biggest investing companies in the world as they have MILLIONS of shares in this company. The companies who are CUSTOMERS of REMARK include: Disney, Walmart, Multiple leading Casinos in Vegas, Multiple leading airlines and the list goes on. These are some of the biggest companies in the world. You will look back at REMARK and think anything lower than $10 is an absolute steal. Great business minds that reinvented the company for an essential technology that is needed to advance the world and make everyone safer from Covid 19 and other diseases. Absolute GOD TIER goldmine stock. Don't hesitate to go all in with this one, you will not regret. MARK my words!!"
Have you guys heard anything about Trump using MARK on today’s rally? The CEO posted a pic in Washington the other day at the White house? Could they have signed a deal with Trump to implement temperature checking at all of his rallies? This could be hugee and a lot of exposure to companies that dont know MARK yet.

I bought this stock in 2017. It's the same story every quarter. I even bought some at 14. Yes $14 not $.14.I am down so much I won't sell. I really thought they had something with Sharecare and their Ai platform. Poor management. I would normally not hold something like this this long but I thought their stake in sharecare was worth more than their stock price. Wrong again. Good luck too us all!

"Do you noobs know what investing is? Stop having a short day traders mind to just look for a quick profit. Remark is NEEDED in the world to open up and become NORMAL. Buy your shares, leave the computer and come back next week or a month. THEN you will see big PROFIT. This stock will not go down, because it is NEEDED IN THE WORLD, and in demand. Patience is a virtue."

I've personally seen $mark AI being put in and installed in local government buildings especially courthouses as they remodel their entrances to filter everyone in. Might be another low day today might start to trend up as things have consolidated again. But between local government using this tech especially in their courthouses, Vegas which reopens Thursday and now a massive Chinese contract I expect the realistic 3.50 range by Friday and by Monday with new videos and PR drops and hints could be going for the 5 to 10 dollar range over in 2 to 6 weeks. Continue to bash this stock gives me more opportunity to move funds and limits around I set myself every 72 hours to put more into it. Hoping to add another 5 to 10k shares asap."

"To all my fellow longs, before you freak out due to the stuff that LegalMonster said and you dump your shares tomorrow (and if you sell them cheap I'll gladly average down) I just want to tell you why I am not panicking/stressing:1) Based on the 10K yes it's true that we issued almost 50M shares to our new partner Aspire Capital, we did raise around $35M for it, and most of it is capital that we still have in cash now and that we can use to expand our business even more. Now that brings us to 99M shares.2) There are warrants for the issue of another 6.6M shares at $2.23, yes, that's true, but the rest of stock options and warrants are at $10 and won't get executed, so at max we'll end up with around 106M shares oustanding, not 116M. (Plus those warrants can't be executed until July 31st, until when the price can increase a fair amount).3) Third and most important point, yes friends, we did get diluted and of course it sucks, BUT, A) first of all we already got discounted from $3.4 to $2.64 KEEP THAT IN MIND! As before we after we learned about Wynn ccontracts and before we learned about dilution we were hitting even $3.5. ; and B)The stock market is all about future cashflows, now if you consider all the contracts that we already have and keep getting : China Mobile, Chinese schools, Chinese super markets (each of those categories are in the thousands); plus all the Casinos, theme parks, sports stadiums, police departments, hospitals, hotels etc. just to name some, Imagine how much money can we make? Think about it, we already have the technology, we don't need to manufacture it, this means we incure ALMOST NO COST, we just need to distribute and sell it and reap our huge profits, and the CEO told us that he knows a bunch of CEO's in a lot of industries and that they're getting 10-15 referrals from each customer, EVERY SINGLE DAY they get 10 SERIOUS inquiries and EVERY week they close 1-2 LARGE deals (I don't think he'd say LARGE just about anymore).So yeah, even if we get shorted a bit tomorrow, with Vegas opening as of tomorrow, and soon we'll be hearing of more and more huge companies doing business with us, the stock price will fly to $4-5. If you're a conservative investor and don't want to lost a lot you can at least set your sell limit to somewhere between $3.5-4. Anyhow, if someone doesn't agree with me, please, after reading my comments and Legal comments, also go and read the who CC and the 10K and make your own decision instead of listening to someone who already has a short position in the stock (Legal), it is in his interest to convince you to sell because he will be making money from it as a short, also 100% he's got his shorted shares covered with call options but of course he wouldn't tell you that much :pHave a good evening everybody! See you tomorrow!Long and strong!"

"Just like yesterday I'll give my 50 cents on this. Yesterday I predicted a possibility of a dip, that I'd suggest people to buy in on. It happened. I hope you bought in on the shorters.

This and MARK dripping hype in tweets will most likely push it above 2, if the shorters won't push it down too hard. Will it go above? Yes, if we see REAL contracts, real revenue potential, real business the 28th. It will go beyond 5. There are to factors, that can push the stock down. Shorters and doubt.

That question has to be answered soon, but the answer may be negative - and that is a bearish thing. I bought in multiple times during the last 45 days. I've sold some with profit and the rest is in it for the gamble."
I think this might be a good price to jump in
"Today we shall see 1.05 and tomorrow 0.98 before it tests 1.00. If it cannot close above 1.00 tomorrow, I am afraid we might go to 0.85 on Monday."
Did anyone else notice the shares traded from about 5 minutes until it closed for the day? If I'm looking at it correctly multiple large blocks were purchased all at once to drive it to $3.40 right at the bell. Someone knows something 
I guess remark is not tell investors how much cash they got in the sharecare IPO. mark should have the money by now. So are we being scamed
What is the average amount of stock you guys are holding? I got 60.
But let's not get too forward looking with the WYNN Resorts contract. It was posted 20 hours ago and may have been factored into the price being up 25% today. I hope it's not but you never know. But the good thing is that Wynn contract is just the beginning of something very very special here. MARK has so many contracts I can't even keep track of them anymore. Wowser. To the moon.
"Some very interesting points taken out of the call yesterday...This is not just a pandemic driven system, this is a technology which will be used for various types of Artificial Intelligence! He mentioned Asia, Middle East, Europe and US. He mentioned Law enforcement, Hospitals, Retail, Schools and Stadiums. He mentioned being at 70-90 sites right now most sites have multiple entries. He hinted at not having enough employees to cover the demand. So far sales have been through relationships and referral. Which means they haven't even scratched the surface of potential clients yet. I understand investors want to buy low and sell high to make some quick money but if you are not LONG on this company you really have no idea the potential growth of this technology and company. I will not be playing the buy sell game, I will be accumulating on the dips!"
"Wow, haven't seen a premarket jump like this in months. Something is cooking."
"Facial-Recognition Tech Might Be the Real Reason to Buy Remark StockAs bigger companies shy away, Remark is doubling downBy Larry Ramer, InvestorPlace Contributor Jun 29, 2020, 8:10 am EDTWhen discussing Remark Holdings (NASDAQ:MARK), most investors and pundits have focused on the ability of the company’s cameras to quickly and easily take people’s body temperatures. This in itself should be impressive enough to move MARK stock.￼<img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1633001"" src=""https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/facial-recognition-300x169.jpg"" alt=""Facial-Recognition Tech Might Be the Real Reason to Buy Mark Stock"" width=""300"" height=""169""/>Source: ShutterstockBut Remark’s AI-enabled technology, which, as InvestorPlace columnist Josh Enomoto noted, also utilizes “optics” and “data analytics,” has so many other cool capabilities and highly useful applications. These other, largely ignored functions definitely make MARK worth buying at this point.For example, Remark’s cameras incorporate facial recognition technology. At a time when Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have halted sales of their AI-enabled facial recognition software to law enforcement entities, Remark can fill the void by selling its cameras to such entities.In general, Remark’s technology can save businesses and other enterprises a huge amount of time and money.At a time when shoplifting is becoming a huge problem, retail chains can use Remark’s technology to quickly and easily identify those who have previously stolen products.A Closer Look at MARK StockSchools in China are using Remark’s technology to quickly ensure that every child who’s supposed to be in school is indeed there.Of course, that technology would save many other types of entities a great deal of time and labor costs. For example, large factories could continuously ensure that all of their employees who are supposed to be on the floor are indeed there, and prisons could use Remark’s technology to ensure that all of the inmates are where they’re supposed to be."
all aboard
"I have held a position in ReMARK for nearly 15 months. I know almost every detail attached to it that’s been on the Internet in the last 90 days. I’m probably more optimistic heading into the week than I should be (I’m a ‘worst case scenario’ type of person). So I want to share 2 major bad points then 2 good points that have been sticking out to me ....1 - the fact it’s used for 400,000 kindergarten classes and 800,000 ‘primary campuses’ in China IS a concern for me. 2 - the fact India is using FLUKE and displayed that all over television last Friday IS also a concern.Those are my negatives1 - what has sold me more than any one point when investing is the fact Donald Trump Jr supports the CEO on social media. That’s Huge. (He also supports FLIR, but not their CEO.)2 - the #1 NASCAR driver tweeting ‘Remark’ over this weekend is Huge. This company’s market cap is 129million $.... I project 15x that very easily. Only if it has contracts. Which I’m 80% confident that it does."
"Looks like no one on this board has any clue what’s going on... Well, Sharecare is going public through a merger with #FCAC at a valuation of around 4B. MARK should be able to cash out their 4.5% stake for around 180 million."

"I bought back in april 2020. I held on to this through the highs and the lows. I had faith in this company to go places. Get ready, because I have a feeling we are going nothing but up."
"Thursday the 28th is fiscal year end 2019 annual report being released because of delay. Not anything from the Q-1 2020. That release has also been delayed. However, the company will be providing updates on inportant activities for the business this year to date. It's not going to provide any 2020 financials pre or post covid-19. Be sure what you are expesting to see. I'm hoping for update on potential sale of its Sharecare stake as mentioned in November call covering the Q-3 2019 quarter. Plus some announcment about wins in the thermal imaging business and growth expectations from the increased demand. I liked the Wynn reopening video touting all the protections in place to combat covid-19, including the clear view of the Remark technology platform on display."
24k volume in Germany That's heavy heavy volume for Germany. Usually trades about 5k a day. Waiting to see the Canadian market what happens there. USA stock futures are way way up. Should be a great day tomorrow. Lets go. I put in a limit sell order at $30. Lol nobody gonna change my mind on that sell price. Might be months before it hits that but hey you never know.
Remark $MARK Rating Increased to Buy at Zacks Investment Research $5
Since I live in Vegas and now heavily invested in Mark(not sure how that happened ) but as soon as Wynn opens I’ll Make sure I go there to look at the cameras. I’ll def let you you all know if it’s indeed Legit that the Remark Cameras are in use. Being Remark HQ is less than 1/4 mile from Wynn/Encore hopefully they are using their neighbors.
"This is really simple so I’ll make it even more simple for some people here on Yahoo Finance board. This stock is going to explode post call. The call is not about numbers from last year - ALL IT IS IS TO CONFIRM HUGE CURRENT AND FUTURE COMPANY CONTRACTS. That’s it. Confirming what so many investors have researched and found out on their own these last few months. If you want to make money, invest after the call. Of you want to make way more money - invest now. Good luck."
$MARK @@@I am 99.99 % sure we get the compliance letter from the Nasdaq on Tuesday am (aka Pr). This alone will push us over $3.00+. Make sure you get in! Don’t miss this great opportunity
"Everyone thinks this is a short squeeze but remark actually has fundamentals to fall back on and has been growing their business for the past year, eliminating debt and increasing revenues. Their business is only starting to ramp up with contracts in China, with HP, and their stake in Sharecare. Do your due diligence before buying this stock and don't just chase possible short squeezes. Strong hands only."
"Patience time is coming , everyone buying positioning !!! I’m in at .80 with 3200 shares not selling till I see 8$"
