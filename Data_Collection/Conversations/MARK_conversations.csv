25 today
no company with volumes this huge trade at $2 this being held down massively. Will be a $70 dollar squeeze in no time at all
Hold strong guys. More market buys. Only a few cents difference.
"Short interest is only 11% as of Sep 30 and short borrow interest rate is 4% on Interactive Broker as of today. However, if we can sky rocket the share price, the borrow interest rate will increase rapidly and put pressure on the shorts to cover. Short % of Float (Sep. 30, 2021) 11.03%"
If I don’t see eight fold tomorrow then I will not believe any stock news.
Great day.Took profit from $tsla $bkkt $mark and $dwac All in $mpw. Long term play.
"Mark will surprise everybody in premarket, massive run ready to fly to the moon Thanks trumpy"
30$ monday
"Hold for tomorrow,,, will move the same as BKKT"
LOL...can we build an AI to identify good AI companies?
Still people don't get it people are still selling shares for cheap I laugh at that.
"Currently, Remark Holdings is the #1 trending stock on Yahoo! Finance"
"got in at 8.21 pre market, what should I do?"
man I wish if I had waited till the market open.. I chased it but that's OK. I know what I invested in. I just I'm a bit behind
Hold your shares it will go back up. Don’t panic and sell.
don't care what people are saying. just bought more worth 3k
"Why it wouldn't let buy more than 4,000 shares?"
Mark will bounce back up . We all seen the potential here. This stock rockets to 9 dollars soon enough .
"it's back to normal, up 5 cents ah, wth. hope to see $9 like yesterday pm again."
Outstanding volume
"Well, at least I found one thing I'm good at, Buying high and Selling low. Did that yesterday and then again today. Bought at $2.27 on the open. Sure looked like it would pop up big, just like PHUN opened and quickly was up 25%."
My boy swore this was gonna blow up today so we went in $500 each. Last time I follow his financial advice.  It blew up alright just in the wrong direction.
If you got in at 4.50 you will be holding for years 
Don't know about an IT company with their website giving problems ... crashing ...
Strong last 5 minutes of after-hours. Good sign for premarket
"people optimistic about MARK, saying sectors are down etc making me laugh haha. yeah, a meme stock will perform with correlation to the market"
"If you guys keep buying and hold it for a while until the short ratio falls below 1, this will lead to a squeeze. Until then its not a squeeze and it is just hype. However, you can make the squeeze happen. Good Luck longs."
Is it best to buy at open or wait for a hour or so till it drops a bit? Seems like this is usually the pattern with stocks.
"Friends...watch for the pop during AH today. Insider's in China will make it happen and we will gap up at the bell on Monday, a.m. Peter"
I'm in at 7.46
Watch the news
Will close around 9 $
We've seen this the past week with $PHUN $DWAC $MARK $BENEShould come as no surprise at this pointIt's not stopping tomorrow
"Big deal with mark to develop trump network, monday will hit 40$"
do you think $10 today ?
Time to Buy folks look at the chart. This is going way up.
Short squeeze incoming time to load up
"Big deal with mark to develop trump network, monday will hit 50$"
Freshly minted bagholder here. Hope this recovers soon.
Sold all my shares 29k loss
Can I get a 1400% gain for once in my life. Thanks
Keep holding. This might touch 20 today!
12$ coming
"Only 105.11 mil shares are supposed to exist of this company. On OCT 22 187,454,200 shares traded. Oct25 386,168,400, OCT26 83,832,600 and Oct27 52,905,088. Today alone Ortex Short Interest Change is +18.54%, Estimated Current SI % of FF 25.69%. I am not in this play, but there's a reason there are so many bashers in here trying to get people to walk away. Anything short over 10% of a company is high. IN MY OPINION, if people truly looked at the numbers and realized that they just need to hold because they sold more shares than exist the price of the stock will have to go up because they need people to sell. The problem is people get emotional and watch the stock all day go down with manipulative tactics and they bail for thousand plus loss after just buying in a few days earlier, totally disregarding their initial reason for buying and forgetting that if more positive news comes out that it could send it back to their very buy in price. The problem is people forget this and fold at a loss and the vicious hf cycle continues. If only blockchain would be incorporated on the market to truly keep it fair."
It will touch 20 today. Wait for the real action when the market opens. Dont sell yet.
Going to fly at the open
we gonna run back to $9.00
I'll have over $1 Million profit when he hit $10 a share!!
I learned one thing again today don’t buy at the open
Wow $BRPM acquisition of FAZE CLAN valuation 1 billion currently X5 current share price… once $DWAC $PHUN $MARK run this will be next
Monday os great day for holders to celebrate
Tomorrow we will rebound. No more selling just buying!!!
Anyone know how I can buy premarket? In what trading platform?
BKKT The trend we've seen in After Hours with $phun $dwac $mark $bene will continue here tonight
I did not sell this at 4.5+ as it had momentum towards ATH and I guess we will will get to that +15 ATH on Monday. Oh that I had seen so many red days with this tech stock....have a great weekend.
"i have seen many comments , what are basis of 9$or 12 $ or just a gud feeling.any one who is expert of finance can explain here, so ppl can plan accordingly .thanks in advance ."
"03:18 PM EDT, 10/22/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Remark Holdings (MARK) shares skyrocketed 127% to $2.06 in Friday afternoon trading with volume at nearly 84 million shares against a daily average of about 1.2 million.The company on Thursday filed a registration statement for a potential offering of securities, including common stock, with an aggregate initial price of up to $50 million."
Held it for 2 years at 1.25$ - 3000 shares

"I’m in 3365 shares at 2.63, it keeps dropping but should have a nice pump soon, although I have to admit the drop in volume is a bit concerning"
Holding
Come to $PROG. Next squeeze
"Many of laugh at a $160 target. Here is an example $WNW, $7 to $160 in two days!"
"Tell me board, why is a stock with no news ever up 600% in two days? Looking forward to your input."
strong buy! let's take it to 10$ again!
"$frsx has hit $2,9-2.8 multiple times and found a clear bottom at this level. Yesterday $fncmx, a fund managing $14B bought 24500 shares of $frsx. Combine this with the fact that $frsx 1y pattern looks exactly the same as $mark indicates that something is going on. This stock might boom or it might go up some double digits. Ether way this is a winner"
Back to 9$
Should I buy pre-market or at open?
Pre-market shake out. We are heading to 4 guys. Load up.
Share this stock over the weekend. Let them know about the squeeze and how this is linked with $dwac and $phun
$4 opening ?
I put a sell limit of $25
"I bought 10,000 for $8. Is mark hopeful? "
Lets see $30
Could bounce to two digits soon!
this is gonna be huge... not selling until 15$.
Power here sit back and enjoy the show $4.50 here we come
"If the retail meme investors get a hold of this stock as rumored with a short squeeze, this is going to be bigger than AMC.Don't sell Monday unless you want to risk one of the biggest profit takings for yourself in your life. And thank Donald Trump, even if you don't agree with his politics. It's gonna be one wild week."
good idea to buy pre market?
"i boight at 7,3? Smart?"
"OMG, like, my friends' brother's niece just said that she saw on TicTok that this is like totally going to $120 per share like tomorrow."
Pre market is going to be insane $Phun and $Mark (mark is connected with $dwac)
will it pop again? what will be the volume today?
$Trka and $Mark lets go to the moon $Phun

I am sad for those who rush and sold!
Rotation to BRPM today. Don't fight it. Run with the trends.$dwac $mark $bene $phun
"Well, the pump and dump is winding down for this stock and others we’ve talked about since last Thursday. What’s up next everyone?"
Very rare I see no bashers here. Must be a great sign for things to come.. so there must be some truth to the rumors to partners with truth media.. Phun touched $24 this should touch there as well.
Will this really pump? Like AMC?
LFG! I’m holding until minimum $10
"Cryptocurrency /forex trading is a big chance to make money nowadays, if you can't see that at this point is time you learn more about it"
Looks like $MARK might meet us before the day’s over with.

"If news is fake then market watch ,zacks,reddits,and other similar should be all banned from reporting any news. Market Watch stated we will see 8 fold. Gain on Mark stock tomorrow. If false news then we need to censor all false news."
"Great move up, hourly chart looks great!"
"$Mark is the next $Phun. I PROMISE, $Mark has connections with $Dwac, do your own research. We have lift off on Monday."

God bless all my fellow longs. Jesus saves ;)
Pre market monday 4$+
after 5$ we put it 10$
"if you guys listen to me you will make money. very simple, it's not a short squeeze but it can eventually lead to a short squeeze if you buy and Hold. The short ratio should be 1 or less to initiate a squeeze which can only happen by holding this price. also, Shorts will try to harass you in coming days as they will build their positions and if don't get harassed the squeeze will happen."
"All of my profits from here are in $MARK, $DWACW! I left a small core amount here. This will go back to $30 until the ER."
MARK ready for another run for sure!
Based on what is Mark going up again today ?? Anybody ??
"I cant buy pre Market, is it still smart to buy when this opens?"
Will see 5$ again today!! End of day and after hours will spark again ️
"super squeeze imminent, MARK loading... 3.00 pps in the blink of an eye"
A YouTube video told me to buy. Should I???

Don’t listen to Bashers or Shorts  Trying to Scare everyone to Sell Patience is a Virtue Stay Strong 
"i am not able to buy myself in the pre market, due to my broker. Should i still buy when the market opens? Where will this stock go?"
something cooking. Roth Capital lifted their price target to .....$20.50
BUY or HOLD. These are your options. No more selling. No more shares left to sell. Shorts are toast.Simply Buy or Hold and watch this stock go up.

glad to get out at $7.32 at the pre-market.
I'm wondering what happens if US markets open....
"For those wondering, this is running because of the CEO’s relationship with the DWAC CEO. The chart here is also identical to PHUN’s chart from yesterday before it ran to $20 today."
$6+ Monday
Frankfurt is up an astonishing 855%!!!!!!Their day is about half over.I guess we're opening around at least 500%??!?!?
Daily cup and handle?
"Stop selling, buy and hold."
Bought another 5000 stocks

"Now that I sold it and took a loss of 5K , it’s going up."

"Remark Bag Holdings, Inc,....the stock where you're left holding the bag"
Big news this weekend
last chance to enter before 5$+
"$BENE, $MARK and $DWAC all have the same chart pattern. Somebody is getting played. I'm in $PROG for the short squeeze and if we get some crazy volume then it's going to blow! 66.87% short interest!"
"Supersrong Buy! 2500% upside potencial, news on the way, this is sqeeze time!$phun $dwac $mark $prog $ater"
The strong will rise and the weak will fall like winter wheat
I am 40k down here .. it hurts
"As of today, MARK is #16 out of hundredson the fintel short squeeze list with ascore of 90.17I'm not sharing this because I believe MARK couldactually squeeze. That concept is tossed around waytoo liberally by us retail investors. But it's worth sharingbecause these heavily shorted, high squeeze potentialplays generally tend see big momentum swings.Sentiment changes almost weekly and volumeincreases and we see big spikes followed by big dips.This is all very good news for us bag holders that justwant to make our money back and get the hell out ofthis trade! It's definitely a glimmer of hope and evenmore reason to hold as opposed to selling for a loss.We will eventually make our money back."
These deals are just gambling. Put in a few hundred or few thousand in the event MARK announces that Elon Musk has joined them in their future endeavors
"Looking quite bullish on the hourly..:heavily manipulated. Bit of a gamble, but I’m holding for a week or two. If I lose 5,000 bucks ain’t the end of the world."
Easily over 6 by open tomorrow
this is one of the first stocks I invested in when I first started investing. very nice
if you wanna make money go to phun before markets open
Massive volume price rises at end of the day looking very interesting I'll be buying premarket
Remember when the Yahoo! 1YR estimate was $7.00 just a few months ago? I never would have thought this would ever go below $1. Probably one of the worst investments I've made in the last 2 years. Feels like only another earnings surprise is going to get us back to around $1.50.
Will this reaches $12?
Is this a hold?
"People start getting out from PHUN and get in to MARK , smart move folks , doubling thier profit"
Up 800% in Frankfurt right now!
"9 out of the 11 sectors are down today, 3 of 6 MegaCap stocks are split today with Amazon, Tesla and Apple down and Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet up. Everyone take a chill-pill. Look at your portfolio and THINK..... the entire market is hurting right now....not just ur MARK stock."
$agfy just entered another deal benefiting if $23M. So far the company has added over $60M in partnerships alone and increased revenues quarterly. This stock has a bright future. Only $300M market cap and growing revenue over $60M this year alone. $bimi $bkkt $spi $mark
everyday I set sell limit of $20 pre post and live market 
MARK my word
MARK will hit $15 today and it might go as high as $20 intraday. Good luck all.
"I know better than this, why did I try chasing a few bucks"
"Always go with the gut. Gut said ""place order to buy at market close"". Finger said buy ""Market"". Now I'm giving myself a double barrel middle finger."
"Buy the dip and diamond hands hold. This is gonna be not only a meme stock play, but also huge short squeeze potential! MARK my words!"
Opened at 6.65 and under 3.50 now don’t make any sense.
I'm trying to recoup my losses at PROG. Chart looks much better and looks to break to new highs. Hopefully MARK will make a comeback soon.
3$ tomorrow easy
I feel like all stocks just got shorted across all board $PHUN $DWAC $MARK $BENE $CEI
