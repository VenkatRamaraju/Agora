"What happens to AMD when INTC release Alder lake, sapphire rapid, and ARC GPU which is ALL faster than Amd respective products… It’s really simple… Amd trolls will disappear from this board permanently and INTC will sky rocket."
Getting ready for the big rollout: https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-xtu-update-adds-full-support-for-alder-lake-chipsEven though AMD fanboys are in denial posting that it will be delayed...
"AMD, has NOW been confirmed by five credible sources, to consistently STEAL market share from Intel, over the past year￼ !!THIS,is WHY Intel, will be a $45 stock by Christmas Eve ￼!"
Does $INTC have 96 core/128 core Epyc servers on tap? If not flush.
"It was on October 9, 2020 Department of Energy Under Secretary for Science Paul Dabbar confirmed to insideHPC that $INTC Aurora was behind schedule, and that the 1.5 exaflops Frontier supercomputer will launch first. As it uses Epyc CPUs and Radeon Instinct GPUs, both from $AMD, there are no concerns about its chip roadmap.Dabbar said that the DOE was ""in discussions with Intel"" about Aurora, and was looking at ""different options,"" but claimed that he had ""a good degree of confidence"" that the one exaflops system would launch not too long after Frontier.It is unclear how severe Intel's 7nm production problems are - it previously suffered years of delay on its 10nm development, and in both cases it has provided misleading information to the media about how long delays would last."
"For those who know Elvis Presley's song 'heartbreak hotel' then that's where Intel'sfans should check in, they will find there buddies from IBM, AT&T and more."
Looks like TSMC is running into problems with 3nm. End of the line for TSMC.
"Our key takeaways from our Intel CEO/CFO Unplugged. We like how Intel is positioned today. On the manufacturing front, the company is aiming to regain leadership over multiple years and will at least narrow down the gap progressively with AMD, to eventually virtually nothing. On the architecture front, Intel continues to have superior products, unique in many aspects, and is likely to have a strong “moment” with Alder Lake and Sapphire rapids. Lastly, the IDM 2.0 strategy and Intel’s push for open standards and integration is likely to strengthen materially Intel’s relationship with strategic clients (and governments)."
Not the brightest crayon in the box. I held MSFT for 6 months... For 6 months the stock was stuck in a range. Then in 2 m I nths the stock rockets 40% from where I buy it from. I sold. That is how you make money.
$INTC (itnel inside) is changing its name to the Celeron Company. AMD does not contest the low end.
Largest position in my portfolio after my accumulation at 52. I will be buying more if it hits the 46's. I doubt that happens.
Intel stock has not raised in value in the last two years do you have any ideas is it management.
"$INTC current Rocket Lake desktop processors are based on the old 14-nanometer process, while $AMD uses the modern 7-nanometer process. As a result, AMD can pack more cores into its processor, making it more energy efficient, and at the same time producing superior performance."
Options pressure the stock. Exercised calls are sold. The stock jumps at irregular intervals. If you aren't long and patient you miss the gains. From $5 to $110 was a good investment. From $110 to who knows where will be another good investment. AMD has the chops to take all revenue from $INTC and $NVDA. AMD can put extreme pressure on $AAPL the spy phone company. AMD can become a key supplier to CSCO. AMD is the top super computer Artificial Intelligence company.
News from Israel...why did AMD fanboys take this down yesterday?https://www.timesofisrael.com/intel-previews-biggest-chip-shifts-in-generation-some-developed-in-israel/
It isn't every day an AMD fanboy makes a post with any truth to it but when they do....
I’m going to buy a new share every time an AMD fanboy makes a post!!!
$INTC was 3 years late with 10nm. Now it's over 3 years late with Sapphire Rapids. End of story.
"It is also worth noting that $AMD pricing power has increased, leading to an increase in processor ASP. On the other hand, $INTC is struggling to cope with a sharp decline in ASP. Chipzilla’s desktop processor ASP fell 5% year-on-year in the last quarter, while notebook ASPs fell 17% after taking discounts to transfer more products. On the other hand, AMD is taking advantage of the technology and performance advantages of Intel chips to charge a premium for AMD processors. In view of higher shipments, customers are obviously willing to pay."
"It is very hard to turn a tide especially with tech. Customers are sticky and its just easier to go with the flow.But once they start to leave they RARELY EVER come back.Intel has 2 Main businesses, Datacenter and PC and each is about the same size.Now we see that AMD data center servers are SO MUCH better, faster, cheaper use less power etc that customers are finally being forced more or less to make the move as painful as it may be. AMD is picking up huge market share against intels massive datacenter server business.Now in PC's Intel is much stronger in Mobile but AMD desktop is again so far superior that it is the preferred CPU now in almost all cases. Luckily for Intel AMD can't make enough Desktop CPUS to satisfy demand !But that will soon change as supply lines are corrected... So basically Intel is in huge trouble the Tide has turned and now that it has and intel has nothing in the pipeline like it did before to stop AMD Intel is in huge trouble..."
"Who would trust $INTC to keep any of their commitments? Cannon Lake, the first 10nm CPU was 3 years late. The US government just had to contract with HPE/NVDA and AMD to deliver a supercomputer called Polaris because INTC failed to deliver CPUs for Aurora as promised. They're over 3 years late so far: ""Aurora was first announced in 2015 and to be finished in 2018. It was expected to have a speed of 180 petaFLOPS[5] which would be around the speed of Summit. Aurora was meant to be the most powerful supercomputer at the time of its launch and to be built by Cray with Intel processors. Later, in 2017, Intel announced that Aurora would be delayed to 2021 but scaled up to 1 exaFLOP. In October 2020, DOE said that Aurora would be delayed again for a further 6 months and would no longer be the first exascale computer in the US.[6]"""
Intel has lost the ability to make small chips..Amazing they ate still mostly on 14 nm while amd is on 7 going to 5.

Dead money. Get use to it...Inhell behind and won't catch up.https://www.hardwaretimes.com/intel-golden-cove-core-architecture-deep-dive-comparison-against-willow-cove-and-zen-3/
Intel can't deliver on supercomputer build. Yet another EPIC FAIL for $INTC. Government won't return to Intel for future supercomputers. U.S. government extremely disappointed with false Intel promises. Invest in the real chip stocks $AMD and $NVDA.
INTC one the most undervalued semi out there and the MOST profitable .the most cash flow of any other semi and the most cash of any other semi .and the most revenue of any other semi.
"If it wasn't for buying Intel at 30 bucks a share eons ago, I wouldn't even touch it. My nvda shares blew my Intel shares off its hinges. They can't even produce the supercomputer they promised by this year. Watch Nvidia and AMD finish their computer 1st while Intel still be scratching their heads wondering what goes where"
Sold all shares at $53.85 after 1 year. Made 9% total.
"What happens to Intel antique inferior products, if undervalued AMD increases production of modern superior secure 7nm in second 1/2 of the year?"
"nextplatform has article, ""The Chip Has Hit The Fan"", commenting on the info about tsm 3nm delay and price hikes. Quotes TSM CEO ,""three-nanometer technology actually is very complicated""."
"By Stephen Nellis(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Energy is nearing a deal to purchase a supercomputer made with chips from Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc as a key lab waits for a larger supercomputer from $Intc Corp that has been delayed for months, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The Nvidia and AMD machine, to be called Polaris, will not be a replacement for the Intel-based Aurora machine slated for the Argonne National Lab near Chicago, which was poised to be the nation's fastest computer when announced in 2019."
"Intel Delays Sapphire Rapids Xeon CPU Production To Q1 2022Intel says it’s delaying production of Sapphire Rapids, the 10-nanometer Xeon Scalable successor to the recently launched Ice Lake server CPUs, because of extra time needed to validate the CPU."
"$AMD is likely to take more market share from $INTC because AMD is expected to launch the next-generation Zen 4 CPU with a 5nm-based manufacturing process next year. AMD’s current Zen 3 chips are based on the 7-nanometer node, which means that next-generation chips can provide higher computing performance and reduce power consumption."
My AMD shares are making me rich. How are you doing with $INTC?

I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
"The Geely/Zeekr relationship with Mobileye is expanding to some longer term collaboration, according to intel newsroom article, ""Mobileye and ZEEKR Expand Partnership to Enable Future of Cars"".It includes news about the q4 launch of their first Zeekr vehicle, which uses some number of the eyeq5 chips and the Mobileye's SuperVision system. The next platform will reportedly use 5 eyeq5 chips.This sounds like positive results must be coming from their collaborative testing of the Zeekr vehicles in Israel."
"Mobileye added a couple of video interviews on youtube today:""Autonomous vehicle testing in New York City: Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua on Bloomberg""""Self-driving car navigates NYC for the first time: Mobileye Exec Jack Weast on CNN""These were both about NYC, but Mobileye has a presentation next Tuesday in Munich at IAA Mobility, and Intel has also been testing there."
"I read at a lot of posts about technical advancements, not many are speaking about supply chain. Seems to me that INTC (purchased remaining 3nm capacity at TSMC and received $36b for foundry advancement) is focused on supply chain dominance with technical advancement is parallel. A shortage of chips has become more a priority than technical advancement. INTC is a big ship to turn around. I also noticed management salaries were low compared to comp., might want to consider paying up for talent."
"Considered adding INTC to my portfolio until I saw last night’s 60 Minutes report on chip shortages. INTC CEO was interviewed.$2B new Phoenix plant being built by INTC dwarfed by new TSME upcoming Taiwan plant. Absolutely no way INTC will ever compete. TSME R&D light years ahead.To add insult to injury, TSME also building a manufacturing facility in Arizona.INTC produces only 12% of chips and has to purchase the more intricate microchips from TSME.Taiwan pumping government monies into TSME to ensure they maintain their position as world leader."
