My friends have just started investing heavily on INTC and hope to see $55-$60 in 2022. Each of us put in $100K guys!
"Nasdaq down .5%... INTC up .35%... INTC is a no brainer long term investment... Even 6 month out options will probably make good profits... This was a staged drop, perfect buy time... This stock is not for the typical day trader who believes everything they read and make rash decisions.."
"INTC back to 52 week high on news ..The U.S. Senate recently passed a $52 billion bill to support domestic semiconductor manufacturing and R&D to usher more chip production onto American soil.Chang alleged Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger, who considered Taiwan, South Korea as unsafe, is driven by self-interest.""This is going to be a challenge for the Asian semiconductor industry, global semiconductor industry, including Intel.""Rethinking the supply chain will be a challenge for everyone, Chang said. Previously, Chang had said government efforts worldwide to increase chip production could boomerang without specifying which countries.Europe, Japan, and China also are preparing up to boost production at home with government aid. TSM recently talked about building its first chip facility in Japan."
"Hmm, Amazon and Intel each generate profits of about $20B per year. Amazon market cap ~ $1.8T. Intel market cap only ~ $200B (one-ninth Amazon). Sure the naysayers will claim Intel isn't growing. Fact is Intel is growing (albeit slow and steady). Intel makes more profit than AMD, Nvidia, Tesla, GM, Ford, and Netflix combined. Intel is pumping its profits into regaining tech leadership and USA mfr. Even with massive investments eating into their margins, Intel's margins will be 51-53%. AMD is hoping to get their margins up to 50% in five years. Nothing against AMD, just saying Intel is a better value, especially when Intel is beaten down like this."
I upgrade Intel from strong sell to strong buy!
"from tomhardware article, ""Intel Shares Alder Lake Pricing, Specs and Gaming Performance: $589 for 16 Cores""""Intel claims that the 12900K can deliver the same level of threaded horsepower at a mere 65W as the 11900K gives at 250W"""
A company earnings beat estimate by 60% and stock down 10% with PE of 9..You people got played by short sellers.. So sad.
"First time Intel investor here. The $48 entry was too tempting to pass up. My catalysts? U.S. foundry investment (own the fab), I see them regaining sector leadership in processors (pc and servers) in the next 18-24 months, plus they are a cash machine with a great dividend. The icing on the cake is the move into dedicated GPUs. Long overdue IMO. Could be huge upside on that alone for the stock."
We close at $50 today !! Folks buy now … many insiders bought even at higher prices and a boat load !! $58 by end of December.
"I have always used Intel as my main rig that I build but recently changed over to Threadripper Pro (16 core model 3755wx from AMD).Bought Intel stock instead of AMD even though I have a AMD system.Intel pays a divvy, AMD does not.Intel is undervalued compared to AMD. AMD P/E ratio way too high.Intel's video card may surprise the market on price/performance. Nvidia way over priced and basically have a monopoly on the video card front.Intel will do just fine come around next year and probably will so AMD and NVIDIA but decided to put my money in Intel."
"AMD’s chips are made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has surpassed Intel in production technology. TSMC also supplies Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Nvidia Corp. and many other technology companies, and the Taiwanese company is struggling to keep up with demand. In my humble opinion, this is where Intel can rebalance in the next 5 years. So chip makers are not relying on TSMC, which is a sneeze away from being Beijing owned."
""""" Intel CEO says company will regain process leadership from TSMC and Samsung by 2025 """"Pat spoiled it for the MF, SA and IP folks. What are they going to write to scare AMD investors until 2025?? I know my hearing is bad, but I seriously thought I heard 2023 was the year $intc was going to overtake AMD. This confirms investing in AMD for the rest of our lives will be a rewarding endeavor!!!"
"Pat Gelsinger, Intel CEO, joins ‘TechCheck’ from San Francisco to discuss Intel’s transformation strategy, the company’s ambitious 5-year plan and how Intel can get to the forefront of software - https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/10/28/intel-ceo-on-companys-transformation-strategy.html"
"Intel Google announcement yesterday, was X86 + Google Tensor. Intel can mix and match chips like no one else can.AMD is Done. Should be at $10 next year this time with losses piling up."
Intel Arc uses Intel integrated GPU to increase performance by 40%. Nvidia will be buried soon.
"Intel teams with Google Cloud to develop new class of data center chipIntel Corp and Alphabet Inc's Google Cloud on Wednesday said they have worked together to create a new category of chip that Intel hopes will become a major seller in the booming cloud computing market.The new chip, which is called Mount Evans and will be sold to others beyond Google, reflects the way that cloud computing providers operate. They build huge data centers full of powerful physical computers and sell virtual slices of those machines to other businesses, who in turn get better bang for the buck than building the machines themselves.For cloud providers, tasks like setting up the virtual machines and getting customer data to the right place are essentially overhead costs. The Mount Evans chip, which Google and Intel have dubbed an ""infrastructure processing unit"" (IPU), separates those tasks out from the main computing tasks and speeds them up. Doing so also helps ensure the safety of those functions against hackers and adds flexibility to the data center.- Reuters"
Wall Street focuses on quarterly profits. Manufacturing companies has long term strategy and goals.This is one of the reasons for US decline. Intel is on right track and good for US economy. But Wall Street is punishing Intel for doing the right thing. God bless America.
$10B chip plant will push INTC back to $60 in 2022 so long calls should work and INTC options are so cheap if you look at it!
"days volume by noon. on a Friday. er was over sold. I know a rival company that earned 840 million last qtr.but intc only earned 6+billion. lol, intc building fabs because they can afford to.chip shortage. the chips car makers want, are antique boards, and aren't worth making. car makers have to upgrade to AI. insider buying, we stayed 4 point above low last November. I like the new leadership. we're not a one trick pony like the little guy, that takes 2 years to earn what intc does in a qtr."
Thinking analysts were caught by surprise on how good Alder Lake is. Buy.
