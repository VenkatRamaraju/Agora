"Since we finished green today, that means tomorrow it’s the moon!"
"Intel is being manipulated by the Advisor downgrade so the retail investors would sale it and make it really cheap for Institutional Investor to buy this stock. Look at the P/E ratio, it is hovering around 9 plus you have a dividends of around 2.9%. Even if you treat Intel as industrial stock, the P/E should be around 13. Remember few years back when Apple was being treated the same way where the P/E was hovering around 11 and it was treated as a consumer stock. Well we see the results now. This is a strong buy stock."
Data Center Group Revenue of $6.5B vs. $6.65B estimate. DC revenue numbers were expected to higher. If Intel cannot maximize the potential in as large a TAM as the DC market is and when there is a chip shortage then the question to ask is why and what is Intel missing in terms of their operations/R&D/Sales channels/HR policies.... The DC market is large and growing market share must have gone to AMD?
12900k pre-orders and z690 board release day today was a total success and all sold out everywhere. Own AMD and Intel and you win
" I’m long and hurting today, but consider this: $19.2 Billion in revenue $6.8 Billion in profitIn a quarter!…!…! Find me another tech company with half of the upcoming catalysts that Intel has, trading at this evaluation. This is overdone in my opinion. Glad to hold through all the noise until evaluations matter again. Doesn’t mean I didn’t buy $56 puts for tomorrow though at the close "
Insider trading. Board member added about 5000 shares.
"Bought for the first time, wanted to invest in value stock, i don’t consider INTC as growth stock. I suppose i willHave to get used to moves like today, 0.20 cents and 24 million shares exchanged!!"
"""In conclusion, Intel is valued on the stock market like a company without growth (prospects), but I (tried to) disprove that myth - which indeed can already be seen in Intel's results over the last half a decade as the PC continued to dwindle in importance. When you're as large as Intel - which may be a luxury problem to have - you can only really grow if the market grows, if demand continues to increase over time. That is really what the Street often is missing. For cloud, the likes of AWS and Azure get all the praise. Those are powered by Intel. For 5G, Qualcomm is the obvious candidate as people are mainly familiar with the modems in smartphones. For robotaxis, Tesla and Waymo, and perhaps Amazon Zoox and Apple, are mostly put forward - and even then arguably few investors are really imagining the (silicon) opportunity millions of AVs will bring at data center-like prices, which is an inevitable future as this revolution will unfold over the coming decade (just like for example the smartphone revolution).So simply put, Intel will grow because the market will grow - not the least when cars become data centers on wheels. And yes, Intel will have the required technology to address those opportunities due to its army of over 60k engineers."" (Seeking Alpha, ""Intel Is Still Worth Investing In"")"
"My few cents…I don’t even understand the need for analysts anymore unless you are investors who doesn’t know how to read. It’s better to do your own research since analysts don’t really add anything insightful other than follow herd mentality these days. Yes, there are some exceptions, unfortunately not many… Here are some other things to think about.First, forecast EPS is lower due to expansion plan… I think that’s positive, does anyone here thinks it’s Not?Second, new products that’s coming out… Alder lake next month, Arc GPU early next year and sapphire rapids later parts of next year will have positive impact and I believe there is good possibility of beating EPS forecast especially if all or some the rumors/leaked performance of Alder lake are somewhat true. Up to 45% better than flagship Amd cpu. I also have ver positive feeling about Arc GPU since this will take market shares from Nvidia and Amd. Third, I believe it’s good old CFO is leaving…this guy was so off on recent eps $1.71 vs $1.11. If he had calculated this on prior quarter, Intel would have been flying after last quarter report. He also shouldn’t have been so conservative this time around since I believe Intel will easily beat $.90 forecast. My estimate is $1.45 with alder lake cpu effect for holiday season. Forth, people are underestimating Mobileye, I believe this division will surprise us next year.Anyway this is good time for new investors and old investors to add intel to their portfolio since it’s a good long term investment with very attractive valuation. Good luck to all longs."
"Probably we'll never see $49 again since SEPT/OCT sell off is well over, big boys start to select certain stocks for 2022 portfolio and among them is INTC."
so INTC earnings jumped to 1.79 last qtr. and that is losing market shares?OMG.. what is that?
"All the talk about Intel falling behind. Perhaps in some respects, it's true. But the company remains very profitable and keeps beating estimates. Gelsinger is committed and has the capital, cash flow and credit. It's a perfect arrangement. The stock price is a whole different issue. It has to do more with sentiment than money."
Let’s Go INTC!!!!!
"Intel beat analyst earning estimate each of the last 5 quarters. This means that the analyst, including BMO Capital, was WRONG 100% of the time in the last 1.25 years! IMO it is crazy that investors are listening to BMO with a track record of ZERO. I'm long and bought more today. Now on the other hand maybe I should be thanking BMO instead of laughing these jokes!"
"Hmm, Amazon and Intel each generate profits of about $20B per year. Amazon market cap ~ $1.8T. Intel market cap only ~ $200B (one-ninth Amazon). Sure the naysayers will claim Intel isn't growing. Fact is Intel is growing (albeit slow and steady). Intel makes more profit than AMD, Nvidia, Tesla, GM, Ford, and Netflix combined. Intel is pumping its profits into regaining tech leadership and USA mfr. Even with massive investments eating into their margins, Intel's margins will be 51-53%. AMD is hoping to get their margins up to 50% in five years. Nothing against AMD, just saying Intel is a better value, especially when Intel is beaten down like this."
"AMD’s chips are made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has surpassed Intel in production technology. TSMC also supplies Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Nvidia Corp. and many other technology companies, and the Taiwanese company is struggling to keep up with demand. In my humble opinion, this is where Intel can rebalance in the next 5 years. So chip makers are not relying on TSMC, which is a sneeze away from being Beijing owned."
"My X86 friends let me repeat again, you're welcome to load up undervalued AMD under $150s. 2027 promises the Itanium man won't be around...................Do your own DD and came down from the mountains to buy undervalued AMD the execution machine."
"Can you even imagine how bad it'll be tomorrow after AMD earnings? Oh my god, I can't wait!!"
Wall Street focuses on quarterly profits. Manufacturing companies has long term strategy and goals.This is one of the reasons for US decline. Intel is on right track and good for US economy. But Wall Street is punishing Intel for doing the right thing. God bless America.
"If Intel had 0 free cash flows for three years, 20 bn starting in three years with 8 percent growth for 5 years, 5 percent for another five years, and two percent terminal all with a discount rate of 9 percent, it is still worth $340 bn today. Wall Street is either very pessimistic, very daft, or very manipulative to trade Intel for less than $200bn. Not a speculative/short term buy, but a good long-term opportunity."
"Lot of good news about Intel roadmap today: partnership with Google to develop a new type of chips, New Alder Lake chips crushing AMD on single thread performance (at the same price). Why this hasn't reacted to the news?? is true that the stock market can be stubborn, I just keep loading.. someday will pay off."
"Good news for INTC longs - Intel director Dion Weisler bought $250,000 of the chip giant’s stock on Tuesday, after an equivalent buy on Monday. Management folks start to show how good INTC again..."
"INTC back to 52 week high on news ..The U.S. Senate recently passed a $52 billion bill to support domestic semiconductor manufacturing and R&D to usher more chip production onto American soil.Chang alleged Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger, who considered Taiwan, South Korea as unsafe, is driven by self-interest.""This is going to be a challenge for the Asian semiconductor industry, global semiconductor industry, including Intel.""Rethinking the supply chain will be a challenge for everyone, Chang said. Previously, Chang had said government efforts worldwide to increase chip production could boomerang without specifying which countries.Europe, Japan, and China also are preparing up to boost production at home with government aid. TSM recently talked about building its first chip facility in Japan."
"Back up the truck and load with INTC. I am pleased with INTC knowing that it will cover the full spectrum of chip manufacturing, i buy when analyst short term manipulation provided an excellent opportunties."
as an AMD Long i remember the days when I dreaded $INTC ER so i can understand what it must feel like for $INTC shareholders now on $INTC ER
Taiwan Pres says U.S Military trainers in Taiwan according to CNN. Wonder if Wall St knows about this development. I doubt Creamer knows.
"MORE insider buying, Dion Weisler buys another 5,147 shares."
Intel has represented anti-creativity for a long time. It used to be Microsoft. Now the herd is so used to bashing Intel it can’t admit it’s moving really quickly in the right direction. Must be easier to complain. Thanks for holding the price down so I can buy
"First time Intel investor here. The $48 entry was too tempting to pass up. My catalysts? U.S. foundry investment (own the fab), I see them regaining sector leadership in processors (pc and servers) in the next 18-24 months, plus they are a cash machine with a great dividend. The icing on the cake is the move into dedicated GPUs. Long overdue IMO. Could be huge upside on that alone for the stock."
"AMD and NVDA are sure great, but they are overhyped currently. Intel is oversold and heavily underestimated."
"Some of the talk in the Yahoo video with the Wedbush analyst touched on Intel losing market share to firms now ""making"" their own chips, i.e. Apple and Amazon. I don't hear that they are actually ""making"" them. They are sending them to Taiwan Semi to have them made because only TSM (and maybe Samsung) has the fab processes capable of making the chips Apple, Amazon, Qualcomm, AMD, Tesla, etc are designing.So although Intel Server and Desktop CPU's designs are now being pressured by AMD technologically, I suspect that the ability of TSM to service AMD and all of these other customers will be the bottleneck that saves Intel from meaningful AMD competition. Also, Intel's strategy of providing fab services to companies like QCOM, AMZN and others is absolutely the right approach, since fab capacity seems to be the issue here.Now the main issue that INTC investors have to face is how quickly can Intel execute on bringing their new fab processes into production at decent yields as well as simultaneously building new fab capacity. Thank goodness they now have an engineer in charge, and not a CPA, lawyer or salesman running the firm! Pat just has to execute (not a small task)."
"Someone is feeling bullish... mid afternoon today they bought 750k shares. Hmm, what do they know that I don't?"
"Intel will come back strong, I'm happy to accumulate shares at this low price."
"What happened if serious confrontation with China and TSM and other’s in the Far East production is affected, INTC will be the only safe bet. INTC will get the financial help it needs from the government."
It is sad Intel stock falls on Alder Lake launch day. The market knows better.
What's going on with INTC in the last 30 mins
I bought short options for .38 sold them for double today... Keeping all the long options.. Had a feeling the Analysts had this one wrong... Nice double money day...
"Intel Google announcement yesterday, was X86 + Google Tensor. Intel can mix and match chips like no one else can.AMD is Done. Should be at $10 next year this time with losses piling up."
Intel Arc uses Intel integrated GPU to increase performance by 40%. Nvidia will be buried soon.
Intel Arc GPU's + Integrated Xe's work together for higher performance. Nvidia is gonna have big trouble with Intel ARC GPU's for gaming.
Several directors and the CEO bought a lot of shares.
The wisest thing that should be on everyone mind currently should be to invest in different stream of income that doesn't depend on the govt especially with the current economic crisis around the world.
"days volume by noon. on a Friday. er was over sold. I know a rival company that earned 840 million last qtr.but intc only earned 6+billion. lol, intc building fabs because they can afford to.chip shortage. the chips car makers want, are antique boards, and aren't worth making. car makers have to upgrade to AI. insider buying, we stayed 4 point above low last November. I like the new leadership. we're not a one trick pony like the little guy, that takes 2 years to earn what intc does in a qtr."
""""" Intel CEO says company will regain process leadership from TSMC and Samsung by 2025 """"Pat spoiled it for the MF, SA and IP folks. What are they going to write to scare AMD investors until 2025?? I know my hearing is bad, but I seriously thought I heard 2023 was the year $intc was going to overtake AMD. This confirms investing in AMD for the rest of our lives will be a rewarding endeavor!!!"
Someone on the $INTC board bragged itnel is the tenth most profitable company in the world... AMD has a great future.
"guys Apple, amd, need tsm for chips. China wants Taiwan. sure they plan to build in USA over 2 year period. So in the next 2 years, yesterday 6.5 earthquake. stuff happens to disrupt supply lines. water, covid, China, lots can go wrong"
Thinking analysts were caught by surprise on how good Alder Lake is. Buy.
"I am betting INTC receives cash from the new chip bill to help build those plants. Funny how INTC lags in technology and still produces a boat load of cash. I guess consumer price points, corporate relationships, reputation for quality, and offering a complete ecosystem for chips all play a role. They say the best place to be in business is solving problems as apposed to meeting 'wants'. Solving supply chain issue is a BIG deal. Adding in advanced tech while doing it won't hurt either."
"Just buy anything under $50. Be patient for a while, THis SOB is gonna double in a few years."
"Profits matter. Intel makes more profit than AMD, Nvidia, Tesla, GM, Ford, and Nio combined."
"from tomhardware article, ""Intel Shares Alder Lake Pricing, Specs and Gaming Performance: $589 for 16 Cores""""Intel claims that the 12900K can deliver the same level of threaded horsepower at a mere 65W as the 11900K gives at 250W"""
I upgrade Intel from strong sell to strong buy!
Nasdaq is near all time high. But INTC did not participate in this rally.
"Very disappointing day for intel longs…Few things to point out. First, Intel had profit of $1.71 per share vs estimates of $1.11 which is HUGE beat. Revenue was at 19.19 billion which beat estimates of $18.24 billion. Forecast for 4th quarter was $18.3 billion slightly above Wall Street expectations of $18.25 with EPS of $.90 below estimates of $1.10.Data center revenue was $6.5 billion vs estimates of $6.6 billion …slight miss due to China change in regulation according to Pat. We shall see if this also affect Amd next week.This quarter overall was actually Pretty good.Unfortunate, We also got bunch of downgrade from analysts including Mizuho Securities, Morgan Stanley, and UBS.I am little bit skeptical with these analysts since we all knew INTEL’s spending has increased due to Foundry capital spending (over 200 Billion for next 10 years) that was announced previously. what were they expecting? With all these expenditures including Foundry spending, and cost of new products, EPS of $.90 to me was pretty good. Having said this, As a long term investment, I think its good time to buy more since I believe Intel will ultimately turnaround and valuation appears attractive. With new products like Alder lake cpu (release early next month), Sapphire Rapids next year and Arc GPU early next year, Intel will be stronger than ever.Good luck to all longs."
"Those analysts who beefed up AMD stock price as high as +$4, then their firms sold AMD and now AMD is only UP $1.50. That will tell you something, their research firms also traded stocks to make a living just like us.Those analysts ""PUMP and DUMP"" stocks too. Intel has been selling off and still sitting in the oversold area.Slowly accumulate INTC at this discount pricing. When INTC hit $52 then those analysts will start upgradingINTC again."
Gelsinger bought 10K shares 10/25 at 49.94...he has confidence!
"Nasdaq down .5%... INTC up .35%... INTC is a no brainer long term investment... Even 6 month out options will probably make good profits... This was a staged drop, perfect buy time... This stock is not for the typical day trader who believes everything they read and make rash decisions.."
fantastic entry point for a premiere company trading cheaply.Proposed changes to strategy rational and necessary-no quick fixes.Well worthwhile for non traders but investors in the long term
"For the first time, INTC will have CPU, GPU, and IPU.. into gaming PC.. and mobile PC in the future..and most secure SOC you ever have."
"I really don't know what mr market expected from Intel. One thing that seems consistent is we are still in a very changing world and Intel keeps navigating for now and the long term, all while paying a 3% yield and being profitable. Good job team Intel!"
"Even debt beat GE has PE of 24... OMG.. this is really annoying..Moses, 2021"
"About 8 years ago, these brilliant analysts were bashing Microsoft with similar narrative. At that time, MSFT was $30, now over $300. These days no one wants to wait 8 years for a 10X return. I get that, but the point is INTC is a cash-making machine (over $20B per year profit and gross margins above 50%). Buy this dip, collect dividend, and ride the stock price back up. Future is bright."
"If Apple had stayed with Intel CPU, then they would not have chip shortage problem."
Nvidia is at $650B marketcap and worth every penny of it. On to $700B. Analysts are upgrading every week now. The Same Analyst every other week.
Alder Lake = RIP amdVery Strong Buy imo
"With stock market at all-time high, it's hard to find value stocks. After dropping over 10% Fri, INTC looks like a bargain. INTC has 3 years in a row with >$70B rev and >$20B earnings. Are there any other companies making this much money with a P/E under 10?"
Next year Intel 4nm Raptor lake will be unleashed. Its over for AMD. Creamer has moved on to Microsoft now.
INTC today is in the same place where Microsoft was before they entered the cloud business. INTC is re-inventing itself and if they succeed they will make their investors wealthier just like did MSFT investors since 2016.
"As I've been saying, margins are down and down for next year as well. MIDDLE FINGER to Fluteman, Joe, Boooyah John, Jon I am, Johan, Marcos, Booobyjoe. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!1.

"Intel could soon let AMD in the dust: ""Alder Lake is coming soon, and it soundly annihilates anything AMD has in most scenarios, as well as anything Intel has. It even beats Apple's M1 Max in mobile performance. It is a new architecture, and even pre-release hardware is showing stunning single-threaded performance (the most important metric), and despite having far fewer threads, similar (sometimes better, sometimes worse) multi-threaded performance to anything AMD has even remotely in the price range.""

"I have always used Intel as my main rig that I build but recently changed over to Threadripper Pro (16 core model 3755wx from AMD).Bought Intel stock instead of AMD even though I have a AMD system.Intel pays a divvy, AMD does not.Intel is undervalued compared to AMD. AMD P/E ratio way too high.Intel's video card may surprise the market on price/performance.

"5 Intel insiders buying shares in open market. Pat bought 10,000 shares yesterday."
Alderlake Combines the Best of both X86 and ARM. The Efficiency cores were Intel's ARM equivalent chips (Atoms). They even had phones sold with it.
If you could invest $50 and get a 3% yearly dividend on that while waiting 2 years to get a 40% profit ($20) would you do it? “HELLO INTEL! This message is not met for short term investors! Sorry!
Intel will rise on AMD's average results. AMD hardly making a dent to Intel's numbers. It it all the loss of Apple and throwing more money at fabs. Intel will be just fine.
$10B chip plant will push INTC back to $60 in 2022 so long calls should work and INTC options are so cheap if you look at it!

"I am calling the bottom on Intel today after adding another 5,000 shares to my position !! This is a great company with an excellent future… still making lots of money . Intel is very cheap with a forward P/E of only 9. Buy and you will be rewarded, especially with the Chip Act around and the shortage in world  chip inventory’s."
"I use computers and the fastest I have is with Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9900K CPU @ 3.60GHz. It works very fast and I have been pleased with its quality and helping it with 64 GB of RAM. But Intel has in production faster ones. For example, chips Core i9-12900K processors—expected soon to be some of the most powerful processors in Intel’s new 12th-gen family. They are adding two new chip factories in Arizona for $20B, or fabs, Fab 52 and Fab 62. That will bring the total number of fabs on the Ocotillo campus to six, with more than 3,000 high-tech jobs as well as employ 3,000 construction jobs. Do not discount Intel! Aldi"
I wonder how much did Intel pay analysts for the ratings before reporting. This thing was portrayed as a STRONG BUY #1 before it crashed. Like to see off shore accounts
Power consumption of Alder Lake chips is very concerning. Running very very hot!
We close at $50 today !! Folks buy now … many insiders bought even at higher prices and a boat load !! $58 by end of December.
A company earnings beat estimate by 60% and stock down 10% with PE of 9..You people got played by short sellers.. So sad.
"ANOTHER DISASTER DISASTER RESULT FROM INTC. game over over for intc , amd win the battle and war chip over intc ,amd is beating intc chip at all levels price wise andtech wise .amd chip is 3plus years tech wise ahead of intcc chips. dont dont buy in yet put in a bid below $30 you get it by mid 2022 Just wait wait be very very patient patient you get it"
"Folks the bottom is in, from here we go up. Intel has many new products in the pipeline !! Read and learn:https://finance.yahoo.com/m/8225cc2f-4c66-3fd0-9ace-058c2f5fd492/3-reasons-investors-should.html"
"Dream entry point here. Earnings were solid. Everyone knew the infrastructure investment was going to cost money. Intel has signed AWS and Qualcomm for foundry services. Alder Lake CPU releasing soon with price and performance that stomps AMD to be blunt. MobileEye business growing much quicker than expected. Future looks bright, and the stock in on sale."
"Why doesn't the market care about profits? Intel is consistently making over $20B per year in profits. This is more profit than Tesla, GM, Ford, Netflix, AMD, and Nvidia COMBINED! I understand the market cares about growth, but Intel is still growing (albeit not hyper growth). And even after the Intel's expensive investment in foundries, Intel's gross margins are going to be above 50%. I wish I had waited until $48 to load up, but INTC under $50 is a winner."
Long term calls on INTC = huge profit - IMOgo INTC IONQ CLSK CRST....
"Alder Lake chips are a fire hazard. Do you have to take out additional insurance on your home if you buy one of these? Come on Intel, how about focusing a bit on power consumption?"

"The volume has subsided… the dividend date next week, I say it’s overdone and Intel has bottom. Intel is making $20,000,000,000 a year net income, has a P/E of 9 and will be building 2 huge manufacturing facilities in Arizona and one in Europe !! The Chip demand will be here to stay for decades, everything will be using a chip even a comb & brush. The USA  Chip Act, new faster chips than AMD & NVDA… -What else can you ask for. This is the safest beaten down stock in the market right now and it pays a 3% dividend while you wait a little. Back up the truck  and load up !!"
Suddenly intell looks very atractive.
I was impressed that INTC is doing $1B a quarter in IOT business.
"I'm buying without thinking. Under $50 is a no brainer. Not a get rich quick path. Intel is literally blue chip despite many recent setbacks. 80% of earth's internet, eCommerce, zoom, netflix, ... is powered by Intel chips."
Picking up a few shares here today as this is a great company and has nice upside. Also trading at 9 times earningsBuy low and sell high.
I guess AMZN margin is shrinking significantly.. So PE of 9.. Like INTC make sense?
"Based on the numbers $INTC reported last night, Q3 Datacenter Group sales in 2020 were about $3.35B in Cloud sales and $1.8B in Enterprise sales. Q3 of 2021 became $2.7B in Cloud sales and $3.05B in Enterprise.For comparison, in Q3 of last year AMD had between $475M and $525M in datacenter sales by my calculations. If they picked up most of what Intel lost, that would put them at $1.1B in datacenter for Q3 of this year, without factoring in Enterprise sales which surely increased as well. That's growth of about 120% YoY and 25% sequentially for datacenter alone--probably higher assuming the overall market also grew during the quarter. Looks good to me!"
Limited downside risk at this point- time to buy.
"sort of lost in the announcements, from ""Intel Innovation 2021"" newsroom ... ""new P4-programmable Intel Tofino 3 25Tb per second, an intelligent fabric processor, the most programmable switches in the industry.""that doubles the processing of the Tofino 2 switch they demoed last year with the co-packaged silicon photonics."
"Now that analyst at BMO is a really smart guy and is an expert on Intel. I never should have made the post about the analysts under estimating the earning over the last 1.25 years. Intel is about to file for bk, no more dividend, and the sky is falling for everyone long. Sell, Sell, Sell before it is too late!I'm such a nice guy and am willing to save everyone at $47.50. Anyway, I'm hoping! Sell, Sell, Sell!"
Intel and Apple are each earning $5 per share. INTC trades at under $50 (p/e 10). AAPL trades around $150 (p/e 30). AAPL stock has definitely outperformed INTC for years. Is INTC a value trap or hitting bottom before climbing to $100?
$INTC should lay off the R&D staff. They accomplished nothing over the past ten years.
Great buying opportunity.
"Intel's got everything that it's closest competitors have very little of. If CEO and execution is an issue - that is fixable. By shareholders. - 20 years ago these marquee American companies built their own chips (not just paper designs): IBM, Texas Instruments, DEC, Motorola, AMD, IDT and of course Intel. - Today all carry paper designs and look/beg for a fab to build their chips. Except Intel. - If Intel is shuttered, China can Annexe Taiwan in 7 hours and literally become the OPEC of Semi-World. - Intel has an installed base of 80%. Companies that process critical data (Fidelity, Goldman, MS, Chase, Citi, Oracle, Amazon) - do not have a desire to switch from something that works. - The 10 nm debacle is the only notable miss from Intel in last 50 years. And failure to act in a timely way. Yes - these are serious. But recoverable. - There are 4000 chip manufacturing super-experts in United States. They understand the Transistor in 400 different ways (diffusion, leakage, etc). Many are idling in fabless companies like AMD, Apple, TXN, NVDA - performing consulting/audit roles for what TSMC, Samsung of GF does. They are usually ignored and have a rubber stamp job. All can become Intel's assets. With the right CEO and Government's call of Duty (and of course $400K paycheck). - MobilEye - This darkhorse software acquisition is marrying automated driving algorithms with chip hardware. It will beat graphics that NVDA and AMD are offering (under guise of AI) by a mile. Need to research this one - if CEO messed this as well. I'll say Intel is still the real deal from Chip Design to Manufacturing - and SW (MobilEye). CEO could not have messed up so bad. And US Govt won't allow further erosion. There is a very high change of massive turnaround. The likes of AAPL from $1.28 and NFLX from $5 something."
$AMD market Cap $153.8 B + $XLNX market cap $44.3B = $198.1B is greater than $INTC market cap of $195.64B. Times have changed out with the old guard in with the New
"Intel's first discrete GPU in years looks to be every bit as chunky as we'd hoped for. At its InnovatiON event, where it officially unveiled details about its Alder Lake CPUs, Intel confirmed that the Arc Alchemist graphics processor will pack 32 Xe Cores. Each Xe core has 16 Vector Engines and 16 Matrix Engines, equating to 512 EUs (Execution Units) in total.Essentially, the rumours that Alchemist was going to be a big powerful GPU appear to be spot on. We may still see smaller versions of the chip, lower down the stack, but at least there is hope for a full-fat model. The promise of RTX 3070-like performance is still in the cards and a competitive graphics card market should be awaiting Alchemist at its launch at the start of 2022. Not only did Intel confirm the makeup of Alchemist, but it also used the event to show off what those Matrix Engines are capable of by demonstrating XeSS running on a launched game, specifically The Riftbreaker. While it wasn't clear what framerates we were looking at, the XeSS upscaled 4K image was clearly much sharper than a standard upscaled image.It may only be one game, but as we've seen from AMD FSR and Nvidia DLSS, getting such upscaling technology in games is vital. That Intel's XeSS is running in a launched game before the hardware is available is a good sign.Intel Arc Alchemist is due for launch in Q1 2022."
World  Chip shortage and the biggest chip maker on sale !! Folks if they pass the Chip Act Intel will go to $75 - $85 in a few months. They will build an additional building with huge government incentives and credits.
"from Intel's announcements, ""Intel Innovation: Cloud-Edge Infrastructure News""""SiPearl is designing the microprocessor used in European exascale supercomputers and has selected Intel’s Ponte Vecchio graphics processing units (GPU) as the high performance computing (HPC) accelerator within the system’s HPC node."""
"To all the intel bag holders post on AMD board. $INTC $48, AMD $121. enough said. hehehe"
Selloff staged. INTC had been telegraphing for months its intent to go big on new factories. For the street to now figure out that margins will be impacted is derelict. Buy.
"AMD is up, breaks it's all time high record today while Intel is down yet again. WHY??? Just look what Gelsinger is doing?? Instead of trying to beat AMD and competition on level field is drumming for government handouts and subsidies (what a beggars). No wonder our deficit and taxes keep increasing. I'd fire him, and hire a CEO that is focused on product improvements and making the products competitive worldwide, not just against AMD."
"Not looking good. Pat can carry on with his running commentary promising share holders a cake in 5 years times but Wall street won't have any of that , they want it now."
"INTC made 6B profit.. still the next profit of nVDA, AMD and TSM combined...Go home and think about it."
Intel will definitely benefit from the China  - Taiwan  conflict. Buy Intel now and hold.
AMZN has INTC's new server on EC2 and GOOGL is working on it..
Might actually be the most undervalued company in the world
Will be more profitable than Amazon in 1-3 years.Could see revenue hit $125-$130 billion in 3-5 years with a 50-55% margin. Sounds bullish to me at this valuation!
Latest posts on Reddit expose Intel's plot re Adler Lake launching - amazing! $intc hasn't sue on such severe accusations so... could be true!https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Technology_Bets/
"INTC sold off due to having another downgrade this morning by BMO. All analysts jump in both feet to beefup AMD and its stock rises $4 hit another new all time high. Until tonight, my projection on AMD is ok and Ithink their revenue did not meet all the consensus. INTC is in the oversold condition right now, it is not badto slowly accumulate some at this deep discount value. INTC will rebound to $52 near term, could be as early as end of Oct or early NOV the latest."
The CEO keeps touring and talking like he is running for president and not running the for profit business ..
"Intel is a buy at these low levels, it makes so much more money than AMD & NVDA put together !!"
INTC still makes more than 3x of AMD $ per share.. Nothing has changed. Really.
Nice accumulation going on
Dan Nathan on Fast Money named INTC as his Final Trade; he added some color that it could slip into the mid $40s and then it’s a Buy.
"The Itanium man Gelsinger propaganda for 2027 that will never arrive. Promises, promises, promises 5G for 2019, 7nm 2018, Aurora for 2019, built broken FABs with tax payer dollars, we're back and more delays i can list 10 pages of promises just like Itanium."
"Intel teams with Google Cloud to develop new class of data center chipIntel Corp and Alphabet Inc's Google Cloud on Wednesday said they have worked together to create a new category of chip that Intel hopes will become a major seller in the booming cloud computing market.The new chip, which is called Mount Evans and will be sold to others beyond Google, reflects the way that cloud computing providers operate. They build huge data centers full of powerful physical computers and sell virtual slices of those machines to other businesses, who in turn get better bang for the buck than building the machines themselves.For cloud providers, tasks like setting up the virtual machines and getting customer data to the right place are essentially overhead costs. The Mount Evans chip, which Google and Intel have dubbed an ""infrastructure processing unit"" (IPU), separates those tasks out from the main computing tasks and speeds them up. Doing so also helps ensure the safety of those functions against hackers and adds flexibility to the data center.- Reuters"

"Just think about it if INTC according to analyst are way behind AMD and NVDA but what everyone forgets is intel is trading at an extremely low PE and if they can buy the latest technology with their increased research and development with the CEO incharge this stock can easily double. Investors dont care how much you spend on technology, it is the growth which gives the company higher PE ratio."
"If you had bought AMD shares a while back you could sell them today and buy twice as many $INTC, BUT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO."
"I read on several comments that ""Wallstreet hates Intel"" and that's why Intel is ""supposedly "" under valued. Realty check fellas....Why would WS hate Intel??? If Intel has been making money for MM in WS, why someone would hate it's own sources of revenue??? Would you undermine a company that has been makes you tons of money??? Heck Intel stk price not only hasn't gained you a penny been losing since last year, AND You still sticking by it. So why would WS do otherwise?? Furthermore Intel is a US company and none of that Chinese vs US political manipulation that Chinese companies experiencing. THE TRUTH is reality on the ground. Inte's product performance and management execution is the cause. Denying of reality will bring you more losses. If it's cold outside, you put a jacket on. You don't wait, trembling and blaming the government for cold climate?? Or do you???"
My friends have just started investing heavily on INTC and hope to see $55-$60 in 2022. Each of us put in $100K guys!
$0.70 EPS would be good. Whatever will be less than Q4 EPS. AMD profits grow 100% per year. Customers prefer AMD products over $INTC or $NVDA products. Pat Gelsinger says he can catch up to AMD in 2024. AMD takes a longer lead every year. Pat has a big mouth but he has no idea how far ahead AMD will be in 2024. Intel fell behind because Gelsinger as VP R&D pursued an Itanium monopoly instead of improving the product. Gelsinger is personally responsible for the Intel dumpster fire.
"This a good entry point for INTC stock. This company has the skills and the knowledge to achieve what they set and plan. The problem with INTC the last 20 years has been bad management, they derailed and missed every opportunity to direct the company properly. Pat is our man now, we need to give him a change in the next 2 to 3 years for this massive turnaround. Chip and hardware makers take a lot longer to redirect their business model than software company. Once the financial help is received from Congress then INTC will be a big beneficiary of this just like Tesla was. INTC will leapfrog their competition on all front from design and cutting edge manufacturing, Pat will win Apple back as a large customer for their foundry and even supplementing Apple chip design."
Play the odds. Intel will tank after earnings like it usually does.
"I would not buy AMD and NVDA in the price and might short them. The value difference between INTC and AMD/NVDA is huge. YES, there are a lot of unknow and risks for INTC. This is why INTC P/E is so low and pay 2.5% DV/y. Yes, The Capx investment is huge, This is why only 2 -3 companies in the world can do it. INTC is one of them and US and EU governments will provide some financial aids. It is matte of national security. Let's ask how many company can design chips and how many company can make chips. AMD/NVDA margin will suffer when TSM will increase price by 15-20% next year and INTC enters in discrete GPU market and INTC 7/4 ramp up in 2023. I am a believer that better manufacture technology will generate better products and better product margin. If you want to make 2-4 times of original investment, buy INTC. INTC could be your core holding in 2023-2-25 since the risk already out. Buy INTC and write $65 in Jan. 2023 cover call. It will lower INTC price by $3-3.5 (DV + Call premium). Or sale $45 put in Jan. 2023. It will lower cost to $40. Barron's made great call 7 year ago when AMD was $2.5. Hope that you will make another call in INTC soon. also It did not feel right to ask TSM to produce chips. Does this country to produce anything?"
INTC will take share from nVDA...
