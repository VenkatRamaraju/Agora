$INTC (itnel inside) is changing its name to the Celeron Company. AMD does not contest the low end.
"tomshardware article, ""Latest Intel Driver Exposes 600-Series Chipsets For Alder Lake CPUs"", reports leaked driver list that includes info for Alder Lake, but also what appears to be Sapphire Rapids HEDT info. The source twitter link also has an old roadmap slide that shows SPR-X in q2, 2022, but I haven't seen Intel put it on a public roadmap. A SPR-X would cover users who want the avx512 and AMX Golden Cove features that are being fused off in Alder Lake. That would be a reason for making it available soon."

"A couple of reports on Alder Lake early leaked geekbench 5 benchmarks beating $AMD's 59xx parts also post the rumor that AMD will be delivering competing chips with v-cache early in 2022.A tomshardware article today, ""AMD 64-Core EPYC 'Milan-X' Listed For More Than $10,000"", is the first leak I've seen about a v-cache device. What is the source for stories talking about inexpensive v-cache desktop chips?"
"Seems to me strictly speaking about fundamentals and valuations, it's six of one, half a dozen of another when it come to INTC and AMD. AMD with a P/E of 40 can justify that high multiple because of their 32% forecast earnings growth rate. INTC, on the other hand, is just as fairly valued with an 11 P/E and a 10% earnings growth rate. So it really coming down to what one's investment objective is, growth or value. INTC will provide a 2.5% dividend while being less volatile."
The equation is simple. Chip shortage = more room for Intel to gain market shares on current and new segments.

"Intel bull here, to be honest I am not expecting our share price to go up any time soon, Probably not until a 3 next year, all I can do to my portfolio is slowly and steadily add shares every month so I won’t hurt my overall returns. Market will wake up one day and realize amd couldn’t get more than 20% market shares. And intel will run. Since GME so many toxic wsb cult hanging around. They Probably will disappear in 1 crash and ask why my stock have 20% value left"

"Intel, Qualcomm win deal to design 7 NM silicon for US defense Agencies.The United States' National Security Technology Accelerator (NXTA) has picked Qualcomm and Intel to help it develop and construct chips for use by the nation’s military.The two companies were jointly awarded work under the Rapid Assured Microelectronics Prototypes – Commercial (RAMP–C), an effort designed to ensure the Department of Defense (DoD) can source the chips it needs from a US-based fabrication facility, rather than relying on offshore plants.The scheme also seeks design capabilities for the chips to be produced onshore, which is probably where Qualcomm comes into the picture seeing as it's a fabless company."
"digitimes has article, ""TSMC to raise quotes for advanced, mature process technologies by 10-20%"", which refers to nodes smaller than 16nm."
BUY BUY BUY INTC ! Imo.
"Who would trust $INTC to keep any of their commitments? Cannon Lake, the first 10nm CPU was 3 years late. The US government just had to contract with HPE/NVDA and AMD to deliver a supercomputer called Polaris because INTC failed to deliver CPUs for Aurora as promised. They're over 3 years late so far: ""Aurora was first announced in 2015 and to be finished in 2018. It was expected to have a speed of 180 petaFLOPS[5] which would be around the speed of Summit. Aurora was meant to be the most powerful supercomputer at the time of its launch and to be built by Cray with Intel processors. Later, in 2017, Intel announced that Aurora would be delayed to 2021 but scaled up to 1 exaFLOP. In October 2020, DOE said that Aurora would be delayed again for a further 6 months and would no longer be the first exascale computer in the US.[6]"""
Looks like Intel is paying for hype $68 to $51. Hype and promises to do better.
Largest position in my portfolio after my accumulation at 52. I will be buying more if it hits the 46's. I doubt that happens.

"Read this and just shut up about Inhell 3nm at TSMC. Apple (AAPL -1.1%) has been the top customer at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM +0.4%) for years, and it's still expanding there - but fast-growing AMD (AMD -2.5%) is set to become TSM's second-largest customer, DigiTimes reports.Amid an enlarging order scale, Apple, AMD and MediaTek (OTCPK:MDTKF) have accelerated expansion - but Qualcomm (QCOM -0.6%) is embracing TSM again and pressing that No. 3 position among its customers, according to the report, which gives some insight into the order flow for TSM's next-gen 3nm chip process."
"Next Tuesday, September 7th, Pat will be a keynote speaker for IAA Mobility Day. Pat will discuss chip shortages and global ambitions towards the autonomous future."
The Architecture Day presentation says Xe-HPC has both ray-tracing and a high end media engine. They say it is expected to be used by visual graphics professionals. The presentations at SIGGRAPH stated that GPUs would soon be optionally used by Intel's rendering libraries via the oneAPI backend. The Architecture Day presentation gave the first demo of a Xe-HPG chip providing hardware ray-tracing acceleration for their oneART (Advanced Ray Tracing) library.All this is stated to be documented in a oneAPI spec 1.1 that will be released by the end of the year. The presentation also said that spec documents enhancements to support specification of ML graphs.
Just confirmed. Intel down again.
Fair value for Intel is $46 to $48/share. The stock is overpriced. Intel huckterism promoting products that they suddenly found in the back of desk drawers somewhere. The new product claims are stretching reality to new levels or said another way it is pure bat scat.

I see a brighter future investing in Beanie Babies over Intel.
"It is also worth noting that $AMD pricing power has increased, leading to an increase in processor ASP. On the other hand, $INTC is struggling to cope with a sharp decline in ASP. Chipzilla’s desktop processor ASP fell 5% year-on-year in the last quarter, while notebook ASPs fell 17% after taking discounts to transfer more products. On the other hand, AMD is taking advantage of the technology and performance advantages of Intel chips to charge a premium for AMD processors. In view of higher shipments, customers are obviously willing to pay."

AMD is picking up huge market share against intels massive datacenter server business.Now in PC's Intel is much stronger in Mobile but AMD desktop is again so far superior that it is the preferred CPU now in almost all cases. Luckily for Intel AMD can't make enough Desktop CPUS to satisfy demand !But that will soon change as supply lines are corrected...

Intel stock has not raised in value in the last two years do you have any ideas is it management.
Here are the positives from intel1. AWS included intels latest processor ( ice lake ) in its sixth generation offering. It hasnt included AMD 2. Ice lake bench mark ahead of AMDs latest EPYC3. Intel announced GPU on track for Q1 2022 release4. Intels Alder lake to be released before Oct 15. Currently in volume production5. Intels sapphire rapids on track for Q1 2022. Could be earlier. Currently in volume sampling6. AWS and qualcomm will use intel foundry services7. Mobileye growing at 100% a year and is already over 1.4 billion in revenues a year8.

"I read at a lot of posts about technical advancements, not many are speaking about supply chain. Seems to me that INTC (purchased remaining 3nm capacity at TSMC and received $36b for foundry advancement) is focused on supply chain dominance with technical advancement is parallel. A shortage of chips has become more a priority than technical advancement. INTC is a big ship to turn around. I also noticed management salaries were low compared to comp., might want to consider paying up for talent."
Now that INTC can make chips for goverment.. it should have the same PE as TSM..$150..

So Intel has too many positives going on1. Mobileye -- growing 100 % and there is a total automotive chip shortage. They will keep growing at that rate for next 2-3 years and maybe faster after that2. IOT -- growing at 50% and again there is a chip shortage and they will continue to grow3. GPU -- Arc will gain market share from AMD and NVDA. Being manufactured at TSMC first. There is huge demand for GPUs and in short supply4. Server Chips -- Again there is a shortage. ICE LAke is ahead of AMD and is in AMazon EC2 M6 while AMD is not. So they will retain the high market share and throw huge cash. Saphire rapids will increase the lead.5. Alder lake -- to be release this quarter or next . Will keep the huge Client market share and prevent any share losses. Will throw huge amounts of cash6. Foundry services. With US DOD contract. it provides for all R&D for this to catch up to any level and move ahead of TSMC. This alone can be valued at 200 billion in 2030
Yesterday Taipei based DigiTimes report reconfirmed that Apple booked all TSMC's 3nm node capacity. They said Intel booked TSMC 3nm is purely rumor.
"I have argued for the last year while I have been accumulating Intel that it’s moat (branding) is what will ultimately win out. Could you imagine a company without the brand awareness (AMD) stumbling! At those evaluations that they are currently at? It would take another company years upon year and countless amounts of money to brand themselves like Intel has done for the last 20 years. No one really cares about nanometers when buying a product. Can it get the job done is the only question the average customer asks. That’s why through all this negative market sentiment, Intel continues to print Billions!New leadership will lead Intel way higher over the next decade"

$AMD and $NVDA stock prices exploded upward after earnings. With Intel your lucky to see a ten cent move. It makes no sense to investor in Intel. My god even TXN or ADI have far outpeformed. The proof is in the chart. Don't believe the two or three Intel employees who post here trying to talk up their stock. If you are looking to invest you should look elsewhere in the sector and leave the old tired Intel dog alone.
here is why intel lost to amd.simple radeon.nvidia purchase or merged 10 years ago would have given intel a good leg up but they failed in seeing the future.amd gpus mine crypto and as a result higher crypto means higher amd prices. notice gpus sold 3-5x over msrp.not many use gpus for gaming anymore because of this. as a result chip shortage due to most likely crypto not just virus.yes I do blame crypto for chip shortages.intel failing to invest in the future drove them down this path.they need to mortgage their souls now to catch back up.perhaps start GPU production catered towards crypto and sell it cheaper than AMD and nvidia.intc will decline at this rate.only thing holding them is the fact that many OLD windows programs use intc based chips.once they lose this edge they will be destroyed.they need to start actually innovating instead of leeching off their old patents.
Intel is so old in tech that Boomers love to buy it.

Stock down on announcement of miraculous product innovations because we all know it is bogus. This company is a pure joke. Even one share is too many shares to own.
How many thumbs down can a positive Intel post get from AMD fanboys / trolls / bots...
"Currently I have been just buying options on both sides depending on what the price is. That said here is the unbiased scoop.And right now overall is making the better chips. They have much more growth as well going by percentage increases over the last couple years. Thats why the price reflects a much larger multiple, and it should.Short term AMD is better but their is a problem. The upside of AMD stock isn't a ton more. They aren't going to keep increasing the technology lead. Also the technology lead isn't as much as people think. It's funny when people keep talking about 7nm and 5nm and 3nm and so on processes. The same people laugh because Intel has a new weird naming for chips. The thing is the nm rating is just marketing and hasn't meant #$%$ for awhile. That's why an Intel 14nm is almost as good as an AMD 7nm. Not only is it NOT really only half the transistors, but Intel has better packaging (how chips are stacked and put together) than AMD does. Look up Foveros.The second problem with AMD is that they are dependent on TSMC foranufacture. Yes TSMC has the most advanced manufacturing. That said they have a ton of customers including Intel. It was a great strategic move for Intel to buyout the rest of TSMC's 3nm manufacturing capacity. That means AMD is limited on what they can produce.The third problem is the smaller they try to make everything the harder it is, the more errors come out, and therefore the slower the production and technology advances. This means Intel will catch-up. That's when the other technologies like Foveros will start Pitt Ng them ahead.Fourth, I like Intel's re-entry into video cards. This not only gives them another area to compete, it also ties up more of TSMC's capacity.The last thing Intel needs to figure out is marketing. While AMD has inched ahead you'd think from many peoples perception they are way way ahead. That's because there marketing is far more superior than the actual chips. Intel figures out how to counter AMD's marketing and they are golden.Bottom line is AMD has some upside, but they have a delay, or bad numbers, or are stuck with less production than they need and it is going to have a serious drop in stock price. Intel is a depressed stock right now. They have a solid dividend and numbers, as well as a lot of cash. They don't have much downside. Let them retake the tech lead and/or have successful video cards and they have far more upside than AMD.For these reasons I am bullish long on INTC and hesitant in AMD except maybe near term."
"Intel is cash rich and high debt. All their recent Form10-Q filings show these numbers which are available at www.intc.com.Intel management has failed to address their existing 10nm+++ issues and only changed their labels to sell these are Intel7. Under the hood these are still low performance and high power consumption fabricated chips. Intel fails to improve in quality and in it's leadership to acknowledge the issues and take appropriate steps to improve it's existing fabs.All the earlier tax benefits were used to pay lofty bonus and stock repurchases. Recently Intel opened up about outsourcing chip manufacturing to TSMC and investing in Coinbase. Intel is not capable to deliver products that meet current technological requirements for the Government, Universities and Private industries. Intel has reduced workforce and Intel's engineers have expressed their concerns in public forum regarding management's interest in any technological improvements.Failure is clearly seen with Intel's incapability to deliver Aurora Supercomputer and any new chips until 2023.Intel should not get any of tax dollars until they prove their capabilities by spending their current cash in hand and with strict conditions and restrictions on how they spend money on bonuses, stock repurchases, investments not related to fabs and partnering with other US based semiconductor based companies."

"Cramer, a AMD-NVIDIA holder will always deprecate Pat's and Intel's efforts and propagandize his portfolio. His sources are quite unbiased ' as Lisa Sou told me'. What a joke! Pat shouldn't go to his show again."
"It’s difficult to ignore the noise, but I have faith in Intel and Gelsinger to continue to innovate. I accepted when I bought in at $58 that it was for the long term. Obviously, wish I waited a little bit, but either way Intel is in for a decade full of advancement, growth, and change."
We got all the time in the world. Buying and holding is free. $VENA $INTC
Microsoft eases restrictions on Windows 11. Windows 11 will not support AMD ZEN 1 chips. Windows 11 WILL support Intel seventh Gen Core X and Xeon chips.
Intel already announced they are using TSMC N7 and N5. And why will they write their contract only till then? Anyone's guess. Confirms what I had mentioned a few days ago about INTC using latest TSMC nodes.
This stock is so paralyzed that not even pumping or help from gov. Can help it get up
Not even good can move this stock.
Interesting. I noticed INTC still trades at 1999 levels.
"why is this place full od AMD propaganda? to keep INTC down? its a joke. A low PE, high revenue will support price. cut clear. soon or later. compare a market share of 90-10% is a funny thing...when the overall market is 2-3x bigger than 10 years ago..."

TSMC told Intel $INTC not to build more fabs. TSMC is building enough fabs for AMD to supply the market.

Add GPU, 5G, IoT, Mobileye (exploding), FPGAs and IFS, there is immense potential for surge in profits along with CPUs.https://www.eetimes.com/emerging-memories-look-to-displace-nor-sram/"
Any particular reason why Intel is down so sharply at the opening when it looked like it was going to open up in pre market. Any news since??
"Raja Koduri, senior vice president of Intel's accelerated computing systems and graphics group, conceded it had been years since Intel challenged Nvidia at speeding up artificial intelligence software, a market that has powered much of the chip industry's expansion in recent years.if this person was in this role for years and admitting Intel hasn't been doing much in years, they should be fired. that is the problem with Intel, no leaders."
"New Infrastructure bill benefits Intel more than the other chip stocks because of their Fab plans, doesn't help their earnings, but solidifies their cash pile. I still view it as a no growth company but it certainly is undervalued....should be closer to 70 than 50 based on the PE's of NVDA and AMD"
Today's news shows that Intel will always be the king over AMD.
"an interesting article came out today from PC gamer with the provocative headline ""amd is crushing intel in desktop cpu sales at several popular retailers"". then it goes on to cite data from mindfactory, an online retailer, who claims that amd had as much as 91% of their sales but that has dropped to 82% in recent days. the article also goes on to state that intel has focused on a product that features reliability and power savings thus attempting to appeal to the broader market. at the end of the article it says that intels single thread alder lake benchmarked out at 22% faster than AMDs zen 3. i myself am a video gamer who owns an older AMD processer but it is VERY IMPORTANT to note that most computer users are not video gamers and therefore have no use for the high end specs. it is also important to note that benchmark(how fast the computer will actually execute commands when tested) is far more important than nm's and intels of equal nms have consistently beat AMD on the bench. the piece was written by paul lilly and if you can get past the trashy title its an interesting read."

AMD has the winning combination And it looks like INTC may never catch them again. Even Wall Street Is giving up on Intel for chasing Foundries instead of Products…………….ace"
"The amd and intel discussions crack me up. Im sure amd is taking some of intels market. But intel grew revenues by 6 billion from 2019-2020. Amd reported revenues of almost 10 billion. Intel grew revenues by about 60% of amd’s entire revenues in one year... And let’s definitely not forget intels total revenues are almost 8x that of amd’s. And DEFINITELY don’t forget intel raked in 20 billion profit. Over twice what amd made in revenue. And 10x what they profited. Amd is growing and are making some nice chips no doubt, but people act like intel is dying even though they are continually growing. And if amd was reasonably cheap id probably invest in them too. But they are currently 1/10 the company and priced at 6/10 that of intel."
When a company comes out and apologizes for failure the high to $68 and $53 and still shows weakness we have not seen the bottom just apologizing failure and promises. What does surprise me Valueline rates this #1 in their divy portfolio and the same in the Income and Growth portfolio. This is during and after 68-53 and still falling. Valueline did much the same with Boeing at $449 and did not drop it till $95.
"Manufacturing is part of the DNA of Intel and it will never become a fabless semi co.TSMC will never be able to handle the volumes that Intel needs to fulfill its deliveries.Intel lost its magic touch that it had since the Grove's days. On the other hand AMD did every thing right and gained a significant edge on Intel, same story at Microsoft when they promoted Satya to be the CEO. McCafee, Altera and Mobileye are adding nothing to Intel's technological prowess, (Mobileye belongs more with Google than Intel).The biggest threat to Intel's future is the 'brain drain', talented engineers would rather work for AMD, Nvidia or Qualcomm and more."
Intel can't deliver on supercomputer build. Yet another EPIC FAIL for $INTC. Government won't return to Intel for future supercomputers. U.S. government extremely disappointed with false Intel promises. Invest in the real chip stocks $AMD and $NVDA.
"As a shareholder of INTC, I never buy computers with AMD cpu. I like “ Intel inside”."
"The Govt contract is for Intel to create the entire semiconductor ecosystem in the Western world from Substrates to fabrication to packaging, including equipment and raw materials for the products. Thats a huge job and will require Billions in Govt money to accomplish."
Intel always promises but never delivers. Now Nvdia and AMD are being used to make super computer for US Energy Agency.
I think intel will be at all time high by next year like q2 2022The good thing is intel are in good place when it comes to ai and deep learning. If intel can make a superior AI-chip then all the big tech companies want to get it. But it’s better for intel to keep som of the chips for it self and advance their AI.Hope Mobileye gets every AI chips it need.
"GO AMD TO THE MOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AMD FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Microsoft faced flak for failing to disclose the chip compatibility.

$AMD $INTCIntel's latest Rocket Lake series processors rank 37th in Amazon's processor sales ranking. And AMD's latest Ryzen 5000 series processors almost dominated Amazon's rankings. This is a major turning point in the past few years after Intel processors are considered the gold standard for new desktops.

"AMD fanboys cannot read. Pathetic but funny they are.Intel gets the cash and the main contract.Read children.The Nvidia and AMD machine, to be called Polaris, will not be a replacement for the Intel-based Aurora machine slated for the Argonne National Lab near Chicago, which was poised to be the nation's fastest computer when announced in 2019.Instead, Polaris, which will come online this year, will be a test machine for Argonne to start readying its software for the Intel machine, the people familiar with the matter said.Argonne spokesperson Ben Schiltz did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did AMD spokesperson Aaron Grabein. Nvidia spokesperson Ken Brown declined to comment."
But they promised to do better. So we will eat crumbs while AMD investors eat steak. I noticed the Intel mgmt will eat steak either way. Do they or the gov Swamp really have to perform? No just make promises and half the investors will believe and starve
"Once Intel gets a Govt grant, its forever. So Intel will be around forever as long as the U.S and EU are around."

My AMD shares are making me rich. How are you doing with $INTC?
Keep falling so I can finally enter. This is how I caught AMD under 3 bucks
The amount of positive emotion towards AMC and Nvidia and the amount of negative emotion demonstrated towards Intel --- says everything you need to know about where to invest. History has shown that the worst long-term investments are the ones that have the most excitement/hype. The opposite is true for the best long-term investments -- they are always hated.

It beats $AMD's chips as well as the apple M1h on both single and multi-core geekbench 5 results. Note that it is beating a 16 core 32 thread Ryzen design with a 16 core 24 thread Alder Lake.the single core results are a little lower than Rocket Lake, due to Rocket Lake's avx512 lopsided high crypto score. Interesting, though that Alder Lake beats AMD's avx2 crypto single core result with only AVX2 enabled on Golden Cove and interesting that Alder Lake beats even the 16 coree AMD's crypto while using Gracemont avx2 for its multi-core, despite running 24 threads vs AMD's 32 threads. That seems to validate the theory of this hybrid design."

Why does a highly profitable company like Intel let such a large amount of long term debt accumulate?
U.S Govt contract means most of the $50B allocated by the Govt will go to Intel Foundry services. AMD gets Taiwanese BUPKISS.
Intel wins US Defense Contract to Provide Foundry Services for Commercial Semiconductor Program.

"Romance of the Three Kingdoms (三國演義)Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a 14th-century historical novel attributed to Luo Guanzhong. It is set in the turbulent years towards the end of the Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history, starting in 169 AD and ending with the reunification of the land in 280 by Western Jin.History is repeating. I see the same romance in current business relationships among the 3 big semiconductor companies:$AMD $INTC $NVDAAlthough AMD’s current stock price is twice that of Intel, it is still only half that of another competitor, NVIDIA.These three companies produce the most important chips for the vast majority of laptop and desktop computers you can buy today. But who does what and where will they be in 3 years?"
"Taking a snapshot of today and ignoring future growth this stock is a massively underpriced value pick. But it has no momentum whatsoever.If intc can deliver on their promises over the next few years it should see the growth and momentum come into its pricing, and then I don?t think a 2-3X return by 2025 would be unreasonable.Also, I think we are going to see a lot of Cold War style posturing from China around Taiwan over the next few months. That could certainly #$%$ tech companies looking for foundry space away from TSM, and towards INTC."
"Considered adding INTC to my portfolio until I saw last night’s 60 Minutes report on chip shortages. INTC CEO was interviewed.$2B new Phoenix plant being built by INTC dwarfed by new TSME upcoming Taiwan plant. Absolutely no way INTC will ever compete. TSME R&D light years ahead.To add insult to injury, TSME also building a manufacturing facility in Arizona.INTC produces only 12% of chips and has to purchase the more intricate microchips from TSME.Taiwan pumping government monies into TSME to ensure they maintain their position as world leader."

"", while the tomshardware article says xe-HPG XMX only supports BF16 and FP16.The Sapphire Rapids AMX matrix operations support int8 and bfloat16 data.The Xe-HPC XMX operations handle TF32 (19 bit), FP16, INT8 and BF16, according to multiple reports.Maybe the hotchips articles will clear up the xe-HPG XMX capabilities."

The next platform will reportedly use 5 eyeq5 chips.This sounds like positive results must be coming from their collaborative testing of the Zeekr vehicles in Israel."

"Our key takeaways from our Intel CEO/CFO Unplugged. We like how Intel is positioned today. On the manufacturing front, the company is aiming to regain leadership over multiple years and will at least narrow down the gap progressively with AMD, to eventually virtually nothing. On the architecture front, Intel continues to have superior products, unique in many aspects, and is likely to have a strong “moment” with Alder Lake and Sapphire rapids. Lastly, the IDM 2.0 strategy and Intel’s push for open standards and integration is likely to strengthen materially Intel’s relationship with strategic clients (and governments)."

"I have CONFIRMED internal information that Intel is ALREADY working on 3nm designs, big time. I am not sure why they did not disclose this earlier, would have been better for shareholders. It aligns with the leaks that Intel has gobbled up majority of 3nm capacity. That's what Wall St wanted Intel to do to stop erosion of market share. Not sure why Intel did not announce this earlier, would have been better for share price.Here is what seems to be Pat's Gamble.To prevent market erosion, use TSMC 3nm till 2023-24. Puts pressure on margins but that's that's much better than losing market share to AMD meanwhile. Squeeze out competition using 3nm GPUs, CPUs, FPGAs and 5G etc and deny entry to others while their guard is low.Simultaneously, bet on its own process technology and launch IFS. This is more than doubling down. The contract with TSMC, especially after launching its own Foundry services, will not be in perpetuity. Intel HAS to be (internal) process wise competitive by then (say 2024 0r 2025). Using package plus internal process competency, stay ahead.Not saying it will succeed 100%, but this is what I think their plan is. Or along these lines.Lately, fellow(s) from Facebook in Graphics, former Intel execs from Mellanox etc are back and such smart people wont be back unless they see some credible plan from management."

Options pressure the stock. Exercised calls are sold. The stock jumps at irregular intervals. If you aren't long and patient you miss the gains. From $5 to $110 was a good investment. From $110 to who knows where will be another good investment. AMD has the chops to take all revenue from $INTC and $NVDA. AMD can put extreme pressure on $AAPL the spy phone company. AMD can become a key supplier to CSCO. AMD is the top super computer Artificial Intelligence company.
"Jim Jeffers in interview on youtube about Intel graphics, ""oneAPI Rendering Toolkit — From Avengers: Endgame To Automotive Industry"".New is that his Intel graphics have been involved in generating multi-camera output simulations that are used for the training of automotive driving models... rather than having to drive around and collect combinations of experiences."
"anandtech has new article on SPR, ""intel-sapphire-rapids-nextgen-xeon-scalable-gets-a-tiling-upgrade"", with some extra details on the EMIB and CXL."
Why are we getting crushed today? This stock continues to disappoint in the middle of the digital transformation era.
Intel ARC graphics chip coming in Q1 next year. Should be faster than both Nvidia and AMD's chips because Intel has faster transistors in its Intel 7nm node.
Intel now is worth less than 20 years ago. Nice job management!
"The problem with Intel's chips from PC chips to data center chips is that they all run on the Pentiumarchitecture which is outdated/obsolete while AMD's abandoned the x86 design for a 'red hot'new architecture which is speedy and efficient.Intel is a dinosaur that has only mass and nothing else, it's neither nimble or innovative."
So INTC will be taking market shares from TSMC. that part will be worth 200B..Please add that to the INTC market cap.
"Motley Fool cranks out an article entitled ""Nvidia vs. AMD -- the New Oil? Which Stock Should You Buy?"" If you have to read it then you shouldn't invest at all. The answer is easy, you buy both. I've made great money owning both and both will do extremely well going forward. What you don't want to own is $INTC as it fades into the past and becomes irrelevant player. My god Intel had to bring Gelsinger out of moth balls because no one else would take the job. Just keep adding to $NVDA and AMD in whatever ratio you wish."
"Of all the boards I monitor and post on this one is by far the best. I learn from and enjoy the information shared on this board! Someone mentioned that Lisa Su stated that there is room in the market for both Intel and AMD. At present AMD is winning the performance battle for GPU's for data centers. I believe the competition is good to drive the technology. With all of that said I believe that we are currently in a golden age of technolgy and semiconductors are the DNA. There is a much bigger picture than competition for the data center. AI, 5G, self driving cars, gene sequencing are just a few of the emerging technologies all requiring semiconductors. I saw an article where semiconductor growth is projected to be $90.8 billion between 2020 and 2024. Intel (and TSMC and most likely Samsung) are building capacity to support and it will be in high demand. Intel has a strong balance sheet and PE under 12. It is well positioned to add capacity and I believe utilize some of TSMC's high tech capacity in future. Looking to the future Intel is well positioned to survive and prosper even if they don't win the performance battle with AMD for the data center. Intel and AMD are national resources!! And, given Intel's renewed focus on technology coupled with their financial strength their stock price should be up with the likes of NVDA, AMD et al!!!"
"Can't argue with this:BoA:Best EPS revisions, yet trading at 40% discount to peersWe reiterate our Buy on AMD with a $135 PO, or 25% upside to current levels. We seestrong catch-up potential (AMD up just 16% YTD vs SOX up 18%), despite the strongestupward EPS revisions in semis and with a clear path to ~doubling EPS to ~$5/sh onconsistent roadmap execution/share gains against INTC who is distracted by expandinginto non-core foundry market. We highlight five reasons to stay positive on AMD whoalong with NVDA/MRVL forms our top 3 picks in our favored area of compute semis.Rule #1, 2, and 3 in semi stock picking: follow the GMIn our view the most important metric of value capture (differentiation, pricing, coststructure) in semis. We see AMD’s GM expand ~350bps YoY to 48% in CY21E, andanother 200bps+ to 50%+ in the next two years – likely among the top 3 GM expansionin semis. AMD’s roadmap execution/TSMC partnership is providing a highly competitiveand predictable cost structure against INTC’s low 10nm yields (likely even lower 7nmyields in CY22/23E) and GMs that are unlikely to improve beyond 54-57%.Path to doubling EPS to $5/sh in next 2-3 yearsWe est. AMD will claim ~15% share of the $66bn (PC + Server) microprocessor mkt., up500bps YoY. Our current above-cons. estimates imply revenue share at 20% by CY23Egenerating around $4 in pf-EPS. However, we see no reason why AMD cannot attemptto go after 30-35% share which could push EPS towards $5+. As shown on Pg. 2, weestimate that AMD has claimed ~60% of the incremental sales growth in PC + ServerMPU over the last 3 years, an acceleration from the 40% incremental share in thetrailing 5-yr period. AMD is exposed to attractive, duopolistic compute markets withlimited exposure to more cyclical smartphone, memory, autos/industrial demand.INTC roadmap carries high execution riskINTC’s Accelerated event clarified its roadmap, but execution carries a considerable levelof risk in our view (4 node migrations planned in 3 years vs. 1 node change executed inpast 5-6yrs), enough to incentivize customers to shift more share towards AMD. INTC’sroadmap uncertainty was a key overhang on AMD stock in 1H21E in our view, and nowthat clarity provides a stronger path to AMD to plan and announce its products thatremain a generation ahead (AMD 5nm Genoa likely midCY22 ahead of INTC’s 7nmSapphire Rapids ramping in similar timeframe).PC exposure derisked for 2HWe assume AMD PC sales largely flattish HoH in 2H21 versus PC market seasonalgrowth of ~15% HoH over the last 5-6 years. Note AMD is not exposed to largeprojected falloff in Chromebooks or Apple insourcing that rival INTC is exposed to.AMD trading at 40% discount to SPX Infotech peersBased on cons., there are only 9 out of 74 stocks (inc. AMD) in the S&P 500 Infotechgroup that are projected to grow sales at a 20%+ CAGR from CY20-23. At 35x PE and7x EV/S, AMD is trading at an unjustified ~40% discount to this group, in our view....."

Enjoy AMD price rise for now.. It won't last because AMD doesn't have Big.little X86 chips and No tensor cores for AI.
"@Mantra Man, Does $intc share price appreciate for its investors? If not, FLUSH! hehehe"
Never trust intel for making money for its investors
"I think Intel is long term play, and this current price provides a great buying opportunity"

I usually dont like anything Al Gore does but he is right on Apple and on Intel going forward.Both will do very well I predict.

We believe $INTC will bankrupt in less than 5 years
TSM pe of 30. I guess that INTC can have PE of 30.. Now it has new business.
"Intel Wins Defense Department Contract for Advanced ChipsBy Max A.

$INTC was 3 years late with 10nm. Now it's over 3 years late with Sapphire Rapids. End of story.
MM must make so much money on intel selling condors.
How Intel looked when they saw they can disappoint again by delaying Aurora.
Gelsinger sounds like a sleazy used car salesman. He wants to make it sound as if Intel has suddenly leaped ahead of $NVDA and $AMD even though everyone except him knows Intel lags the competition by years. All of his smoke and mirror product talk and the stock is flat. It is laughable. Avoid this stock.
"Intel has been nothing but trash. I bought at $57. 71 and to date is just about the worst investment decision I've made. I'm an Intel fan, have been for a long time. I personally don't like AMD as much as a personal preference, but I'll think more than twice next time about my personal preference versus investing my money in something that actually has an outlook. Lesson learned."
"wccftech has article on Sapphire Rapids announcements, ""Intel Sapphire Rapids-SP Xeon Server CPU Detailed: Quad-Tile Chiplet Design With EMIB, 56 Cores, 112 Threads, CXL 1.1, DDR5, HBM & PCIe 5.0 Support"", which include info on performance increase from AMX tiled matrix operations.dual AVX512 does 256 ops/cycle/coreamx int8 does 2048 int8 ops/cycle/coreso if $AMD adds dual avx512 int8 on zen4 next year, they will still be behind by 8x ai inference processing vs Sapphire Rapids."
"another video from the youtube SNIAVideo presentations is Intel's ""CXL 2.0: A High-Speed Interconnect for Persistent Memory Challenges"". It describes how Intel is basically ready to move to Optane over CXL, without modification to the prior programs. It also opens up all the details of using Optane (or any persistant memory) , replacing Intel's proprietary NVDIMM usage.Presentation emphasizes that CXL has huge momentum.Give the impression there should be many products waiting for use with Sapphire Rapids' CXL capabilities... so it won't just be Ponte Vecchio.The NVM support in CXL memory pools is part of cxl 2.0, though. We don't have a roadmap yet with Intel's plans to put it on a chip."

"INTC reminds me of the problem most men have when they reached 50 plus, the share price just can't get or stays up."
"$AMD is likely to take more market share from $INTC because AMD is expected to launch the next-generation Zen 4 CPU with a 5nm-based manufacturing process next year. AMD’s current Zen 3 chips are based on the 7-nanometer node, which means that next-generation chips can provide higher computing performance and reduce power consumption."
"$INTC current Rocket Lake desktop processors are based on the old 14-nanometer process, while $AMD uses the modern 7-nanometer process. As a result, AMD can pack more cores into its processor, making it more energy efficient, and at the same time producing superior performance."
Why is this up 17.96% in the after hours?
just a question:why would 8 big cores and 8 little cores be better than 16 big cores?intels very own bulldozer moment is very close imo
"When WS realized Intel has to paid $2.18 billions and soon another $2-3 billions for the EU. ............ stampede in the making with 4.05 billions shares outstanding, do your own DD and win. Remember Intel doesn't have modern superior secure 7nm."
"Apparently today traders are recognizing that AMD is trading at a 40 multiple and pays no dividend. INTC on the other hand trades at an 11 multiple and pays a dividend, a nice alternative."
Not my words.... are you in denial ?“Intel's Ongoing Delays Mean AMD Is Set To Dominate x86 Server Technology Through 2023”
"My X86 friends, you add $300M to $2.18 billions and soon you need to add aprox $3B for the EU. ......... Ignore the paid toll do your own DD."

Analysts . 5 strong buys 18 buys after all the promises no upside. It’s kinda like Intel is paying for it.
I think right here at the 52's is where to add more shares. the low of 46 is way too obvious. I do not think it gets there. O am selling some FANG tomorrow to add here.
Anyone know what the short position on intc is?
