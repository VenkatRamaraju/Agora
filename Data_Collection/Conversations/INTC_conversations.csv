The 7-based products will show up as early as this year, with the already previewed Alder Lake chips coming at the end of 2021 for consumer products, and the upcoming Sapphire Rapids chips in 2022 for data centers.

Also said they will be adding more on-chip accelerators, apparently in response to Intel and Apple's on-chip ai capabilities ... sounded like that was years off, though.There was some statement that AMD wouldn't be doing anything like Gracemont, but would just focus on efficiency of their regular cores.

I feel bad for feeling good when $INTC tanks because of all the bs they did and try to do to AMD. I should not look to retribution and instead be forgiving.
Shorts on this board are getting very scared . Lol  It is crazy to have a short position on Intel before earnings !! The new CEO was conservative with his 3rd guidance on the 2nd Quarter conference call. Demand for chips has been through the roof… they are selling everything they manufacture. I think shorts will drive us back to over $60 after earnings.
Good chance to Sell intel buy AMD

BUYT BUY BUY INTC $$ !! imo.
"I took time to analyze all companies in SOX index to select those, which would fit holding during tapering (those, which are not overvalued, profitable and are set to generate good income near-term). Here's my best bets:$KLAC - my best bet and safe-haven. Unlike some other semiconductor equipment manufacturers ($LRCX, $AMAT, $TXN) this one is on the front of the chip miniaturization and its metrology equipment is used in testing and production of 3nm, 5nm and 7nm nodes. This company's further prospects and financials will be very correlated to $ASML, because smaller nodes require more metrology. But KLAC is currently 2-3 times cheaper than ASML fundamentally. Moreover, even if after EUV lithography there will emerge some alternative production equipment for sub-nm nodes and ASML loses its dominance, KLAC still should feel fine because even more metrology will be needed for smaller nodes regardless of production technology - so safe to hold like 10 years ahead.$AMKR - company is on the front of the chip shortage and engaged in production of microchips used in devices, wearables, IoT, vehicles etc. The company is extremely cheap fundamentally, even though it has grown 2x since the pandemic begun. Management comment that it will experience cyclical tailwinds at least through whole 2022 and good results has only started to show up in earnings yet. I expect at least 30% upside here yet going forward but it is not a long-term asset.$MCHP - analog and digital microchip producers, whose products are in high demand right now. Company is again relatively cheap to its peers ($MRVL, $ADI), while management reports 60 weeks lead times on new orders in some categories right now. Everything is essentially booked up 1 year ahead already. Company is about to get a 2:1 stock split too in one week.$INTC - Intel apparently is cheap fundamentally compared to its peers and overall has been beaten down for several quarters. But near-term some positive developments are about to start working. New family of processors on new chipset and new DDR5 memory is poised to be a success starting selling in November. In January Intel will finally release new videocards, which are planned to be competitive this time to $NVDA and $AMD . Also new CEO's plans to engage into fab business goes well with current chip shortage theme. Time will tell if Intel can return its lost share in processors and videocards but the possibility of it should give the stock momentum anyway."

"Do you know who has the biggest GPU market share? It’s not Nvidia, it’s not, amd but it’s INTEL. Granted it’s integrated GPU, nonetheless Intel has the expertise and experience to succeed. While back when I investing in Nvidia…I did a a lot of research on both companies and if I am not mistaken, when these companies settled on patent dispute, intel and Nvidia had cross patent agreement, meaning as long as intel invented their own discrete GPU, Nvidia can not sue for infringing Nvidia patents… When intel’s Arc GPU comes out early next year and their GPU is somewhat comparable to the performance of Nvidia or Amd, Intel has good chance to capture large percentage of discrete GPU market share.

"the MLID guy blurted out info on Intel's plans for the Granite Rapids Server chip. Info is that it will be 120 Redwood Cove cores. That's not surprising with if there is a 2.4x transistor density for Intel-4 vs Intel-7 on Sapphire Rapids, as originally planned.Granite Rapids has been mentioned as coming shortly after Meteor Lake, although I doubt Intel would introduce another server chip so soon after Emerald Rapids.A blog reporting on the MLID presentation added that Granite Rapids will have options for HBM stacks and Rambo Cache, as on Ponte Vecchio. See hardwaretimes blog ""Intel Expected to Increase Xeon-SP Core Count to 64 (Finally) w/ Emerald Rapids in 2023""A recent Intel patent app on what looks like a Ponte Vecchio GPU design depicts a base Foveros tile covered with a grid of SRAM chiplets. I suspect this is the Raja's Rambo Cache. It would be no surprise to see it used in CPUs for the same reasons as in GPUs, but I haven't seen it mentioned before.If the SRAM L2 cache is moved to the base tile, that would reduce the core area on the compute tiles, so the 120 cores would be less of a surprise."
I do think the MS price target move to 67 is fair until INTC can show some results.

I must admit I bought more Intel today. Intel is now 3.28% of my portfolio and I am willing to take it to 5%. Come on Pat Gelsinger and team. Earnings on October 21 should be interesting.
"Intel had a oneapi event presentation from Xilinx back on 6/22, ""Ronan-Keryell-Porting-SYCL-with-oneAPI-DPC-to-Xilinx-FPGA-Versal-ACAP-CGRA"". You can find the slides and the video presentation by search.The slide ""CGRA inside Xilinx Versal VC1902 (37B tr, 7nm)"" is interesting. They are using an array of 400 ARM cores, each with 512-bit VLIW SIMD. Each core can access its neighbors memory. They show example programs in SYCL, and state they are working on using the oneAPI/dpc++ compiler along with their own back-end port.It's an interesting design, and I wonder what Intel could build by substituting RISC-V tiles, adding their own 3D fabrication and FPGA IP ... PAM4, silicon photonics, cxl, ddr5..."

"So AMD had gross sales of only $13 billion a net income of $2 billion and its trading at $105 ?? While Intel’s gross is $78 billion and has a net income of $18.5 billion a year ?? So how does this work ?? Folks buy Intel this quarter earnings will be great and they are getting closer to the 7 products. The 7-based products will show up as early as this year, with the already previewed Alder Lake chips coming at the end of 2021 for consumer products, and the upcoming Sapphire Rapids chips in 2022 for data centers. Intel stock should be higher than AMD at least $125 !!!! And it’s coming."

"New $20 billion capacity expansion will bring Intel’s total Arizona investment to more than $50 billion.CHANDLER, Ariz., September 24, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--What’s New: Intel today broke ground on two new leading-edge chip factories at the company’s Ocotillo campus in Chandler, Arizona. In a groundbreaking ceremony attended by senior government officials and community leaders, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger celebrated the start of construction on the largest private investment in state history and reiterated the company’s commitment to investing in U.S. semiconductor leadership"
"Intel stock is undervalued. The replacement of Bob Swan by Pat Gelsinger is game changing for Intel. Bob Swan would be a competent CEO for a low tech company, but he did not have the skills to reorganize Intel. Pat Gelsinger does and is changing the company. He fired most of the previous executes and is starting chip fabrication services. They will be growing. Intel is now hiring the best engineers, not the most politically correct engineers.Intel has unique geopolitical advantages. Both Samsung and TSMC face threats from their neighbors while Intel is secure in the US. Intel is the preferred high tech solution for both the US and Europe. Intel is an essential company for US defense and it will be funded by the government. Chinese companies are a long term threat to Intel's prosperity, but probably both US and Europe will limit Chinese technology. Currently, Chinese CPUs and GPUs are inferior. Also, China is increasingly being challenged by its neighbors.There is currently a global chip crisis which adversely affects everyone, except chip manufactures. Intel can sell inferior chips because TMSC and Samsung can't produce enough chips. AMD is not producing low end chips to compete with Intel because there is no more available capacity at TSMC. In addition, TSMC is raising their prices by 10-20 percent. This action should increase Intel's margins by close to 20 percent, assuming they also increase prices. Intel is also increasing their CPU market share and should have nice increases in their low-end GPU market share . Intel has very little downside and a huge upside. They have a PE of 12 and debt of 35 B relative to a enterprise value of 233 B. Intel's profits and stock is on the rise."
"So there is a Chip shortage correct ?? So this is not a company to short, just saying . I see Intel propelling to $95 - $125 range very soon."

$INTC deep RED and AMD deep GREEN!!!
Intel would be wise to ask AMDto buy them out. Cut the losses.
"AMD must take 90% of $INTC business as quickly as possible. Expunge the threat. Kill the beast. Intel never played fair. Market share gains are presently limited by TSMC capacity. TSMC is building three new fabs... one in Taiwan and two in Arizona. Ground breaking to production is three years. They already broke ground on at least one fab. So Intel has two years to make a new plan, build a different business. Pat Gelsinger talks low margin auto parts and foundry service. Intel tried that and failed because they do not provide good service and they cannot be trusted with IP Intellectual property. Intel has yet to sign an auto company parts deal. TSMC warned Intel not to compete for foundry service because TSMC is building enough capacity to supply the world, including the world of x86 microprocessors. $NVDA is a similar story. Dr. Su warned long ago that Nvidia would succumb before Intel. By expanding into the thin light notebook market with integrated APU graphics powerful enough to play games AMD is cutting off Nvidia's oxygen supply. Disgrete graphics cards are what float the Nvidia boat. Discrete won't fit into thin light. Desktops are not as popular as thin light. The only people who need discrete graphics in desktops are gamers and crypto miners. Those are thin markets. AMD took the super computer market from Nvidia with Unified Memory Architecture and integrated GPU(cDNA)/CPU on a server chip. Nvidia banks on the autonomous driving market. No auto manufacturer goes to market with proprietary software that must be rented from Nvidia. AMD has open source Artificial Intelligence for autonomous driving. Soon AMD has FPGA increasing the power of the chip by 50X. Nvidia must have their own integrated ARM CPU. That won't happen. Every ARM customer complained about the merger.Nvidia and Intel must merge to be competitive. They hate each other's guts. Whichever goes down first gets bought. The merged entity would need three years to field a competitive product. Doctor Su is timing their simultaneous demise. She won't leave enough scat for a worthwhile merger."

"I think investors are underestimating Intel. During Q2 CC, Pat said they saw strong demand, they had the orders, but he said they were giving conservative guidance because Supply/Component issues were still an unknown. In the last 30 days several reports from CEO's have said supply issues were easing, we just saw that TSMC reported a blowout quarter. Expectations are very low for next Thursday's Earnings, based on what I see, I expect Intel to come in with a slight beat. What I really am looking forward too is that I think Intel will raise guidance for Q4. I think there is carried forward demand and also strong interest in Alder Lake. Don't forget, Pat said DC group was looking at 10% growth in the 2nd half. Street is way too pessimistic."
INTC rallies big today just because TSM reported record earnings and give great outlook. Yesterday after market close TSM CEO said 3nm nodes will be online in 2022 and testing samples on 2nm nodes have good quality result and high yield. Don't expect INTC will have good earnings like TSM even they are in the same sector. Don't expect INTC to produce in 3nm or 2nm nodes soon.

AMD continues to outperform INTC … 
It’s down again. Must be earnings time.
"Shorts shorting the only semiconductor stock with a PE under 20 and even lower after earnings beat next week are in for a rude awakening.
