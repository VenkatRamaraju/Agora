How can they make money when college campuses will be closed in fall and downward enrollment number ? Is still chance to short this stock ??
kids still want to be at the university even if the classes are online!
Why are salaries so extended for simple college apartments?

I go to the university of Nebraska and we are already down to a 12 week schedule for the fall semester with many classes complete online. That’s in a state with very few cases. 2nd wave of COVID could hit this stock hard in my opinion. Back to $27 range by end of the month would be my guess
