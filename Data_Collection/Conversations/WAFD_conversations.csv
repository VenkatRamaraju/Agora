"The market does not appreciate todays Rating Action of Moody. My point and figure analysis of 19 saving banks in the marked shows that WAFD ranks at the bottom. As the marked in general is heading down, the wise thing to do before it is too late is to buy protective puts as an insurance of the portfolio."
