"Only certain type of investors are attracted to this company and I call them long investors. There isn't anything too exciting about our ticker in the eyes of the market. If we get a body armor or a military Manufacturing contract then our identity might be set. I believe the identity of the company has yet to be determined. In my eyes and my suspicions, the identity will be Unifire, $UNF or $UNI, only ones not taken on the TSX Venture along with $UNIFF on the OTCMarkets. This is my guess. What do you think?"
