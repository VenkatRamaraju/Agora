AEG is down 4.94% to $5.77
"They've bought 33.33M shares of the nearly 52M shrs that they are buying...............US GDP 4q forecast seems to be high above 3.5, and Eurozone seems to be higher than forecast too so looking good."
Aegon already down 1.78%. Hopefully does not wipe out all the gain from yesterday.
"What a POS....this company can't get out of its own way....rising interest rates should boost the share price...not lower it. I have a better idea for their agenda....find out why the stock keeps going down, and fix it!!Garbage, camouflaged as a value play...UGH!"
"Italy settled down, still this is low, good opportunity to buy. They get most money from USA"
AEG stock is slowly sinking back to $3.00.
AEG reached a 52 Week low at 2.58
Today Aegon's up 2.90%. let's see how long it'll hold.

AEG reached a 52 Week low at 2.25
AEG is down 20.26% to 1.81
"Good move in replacing $1 billion in ""perpetual"" securities at 6.375% coupon with 5.1% bonds."
"Pre market trading has AEG down 5% and I have no idea why. They are not legally allowed to return full dividend yet. They just said they are lowering debt, buying back shares and increasing Divi to 8% I'm buying more of this drops that's for sure."
Comparing AEG with PFG:Most recent Quarter:AEG earned $470MPFG earned $517MWhich stock are You gonna Buy for the Biggest Bang?.......They are very similar.

Just a large institution taking some profit off the table.
AEG S&@ks. Insiders rake it. Could care less and just use their investors. I hope someone at the company sees this post. Not that they would care.
Very nice results..keep it up..
Aegon is up 7.12% to 3.84
Just saw AGN.AS featured in the daily watch list at (http://bestpix.xyz) - What do you guys think?
AEG doesn't make any money...and it hasn't made any money for a long time...earnings matter.......it is worth a nibble at these prices though. Higher interest rates will increase the value of their reserves and should help this get past $6.00.
Aegon is down 20.26% to 1.81
Hang in there since AEG should be higher than $7 at this point............I've made enough money in VOYA to buy a High-end SUV so AEG's turn will come so maybe I'll make enough in AEG to buy a House and a Yacht.
Think they have exposure enough to bankrupt them with this stock drop? Market seems to think so. Is there a list of their holdings and investments?
AEG reached a 52 Week low at 3.75
Does anyone know when the dividend checks went out?
Aegon reached a 52 Week high at 4.57
anyone find the earnings statement?
"from press-release: ""Significant increase in future recurring earnings and capital generation from US tax reform""............I guess it has to do with most of their earnings coming from USA. Up after earnings means more Buyers than Sellers so AEG stock finally headed for $10+ because of El Presidente Trump!"
"What is the News that got AEG up 3% today?We are Knocking on the 52 wk high..................Others that look good: AXAHY,AZSEY,AIG,MFC,IVZ,MET,LNC,PRU,C etc., are all ready to go UP!!!!! and thanks for the Increase in my Portfolio Xi Jingping!"
good run
Shareholders equity has increased quite a bit. AEG is growing pretty well.
AEG reached a 52 Week low at $4.70
"Profitable company, dividend paying stock, so why is it so cheap? Before the recession, AEG traded between $25 & $35."
Yahoo shows .14 dividend....did they reinstate it???
"Buy your Jan 2021 calls while they are cheap. It might take a year or even a bit longer, but this stock will climb it's way up to $7 or $8"
Aegon is down 13.04% to 3.00
"New CEO. Slightly new direction. I like that they are spending dividend on de-leveraging, but most of the value in this stock was the 6 to 8% divi. It won't break 3 or 4 again until the yield returns."
AEG reached a new 52 Week High at 7.21
this simply won't break 5.
Buy GNUS! Going to $5 !!! Potential good news next week! Don’t miss out!!! Do your own due diligence!!!
Aegon is up 6.18% to 2.92
"Unfortunately, the stock descends much more rapidly than it ascends."
I have to wonder at what point they follow in ING's footsteps and spin off all or part of Transamerica to bolster shareholder value. Dutch demographics and business environment are hurting the company. Morningstar's latest report sees strength in earnings being offset by Dutch business concerns and solvency ratio. This may be relatively dead money for the next 2-3 years.
Poor leadership across Aegon continues to fail shareholders. The US leadership has failed in staying ahead of the market and continues to lose market share. It is horrible for what has happens in the Workplace Solutions segment. US leadership has failed to invest in technology for Workplace Solutions and it has regressed backward as a result. Aegon is primed to be acquired and to clean out current leadership in the US and abroad.
I'm expecting a final push towards 3.70 in the last hour...
Yippie yippie yoopie
"AEG is ""A"" rated at Schwab. Not many companies are."
Aegon is down 12.34% to 2.70
"Stock up today, probably means they just sold something else. They want to decrease expenses by 13% this next year and increase divi to .25 euro cents"

Until cov -19 is resolved Aeg will Stay flat. Like all Insurance co The business will do well once people overcome the virus
For a large company AEG stock price should be much higher.
they need to halt trading
Maybe this stick will go up a bit so it’s not so lonely in here lol
"What is wrong with the management of this company ? They have over 12 billion of cash and the stock is selling for only .21 cents on the dollar. If they took 1.5 billion of cash and bought 500,000 shares the price of the stock would recover to $5 plus. Don't they have any confidence in their own ability to run the company ? Or, are they just incompetent ?"
Aegon is up 7.59% to 2.55
AEG reached a 52 Week low at $5.12
Just get out. I finally did. Holding company will not allow shareholders to benefit. I sold at a loss again but made up the difference with other buys. Convinced this situation will never end. Dead money. All hoping on a cheap stock but experience will finally show you that doesn’t work. Honestly if this went to 25 bucks (which it won’t in our lifetimes) I’d still be glad I sold. Just exit.
It looks like Aegon stock is going back to $3.00 per share pretty soon.
THIS DOG STOPPED BARKING MONTHS AGO
The bigger this company gets the smaller the stock price? too many empty suits taking too much juice off the top/??
Why this stock is so cheap? What are the problems?
Alex and Matt couldn't fool the analyst's! Only good news is Alex maybe on his way out the door! He will be remembered as one lousy CEO! Golden parachute?
AEG reached a 52 Week low at 2.70
For a company that has been around for over 175 years Aegon stock price should be a lot higher.
Iam surprised there are still employees at Aegon. i've nevet seen a stock slip this fast.
"Why are all of you shills here? Time to mute you all.As for AEG, doesn't the share price go up when there is a massive stock buy back? #$%$ is going on with AEG?"
Aegon is up 12.15% to 3.23
"Low PB, dividend paying , roe > 7 and profit making, revenue growth and interest rates are going up. What else you need? Is the dutch solvency ratio is the only problem? Why this stock not going up????"
Alex leaves AEG when stock hits all time low! Great job Alex you won't be getting any hand shakes for being a great leader!!!!!
Aegon reached a 52 Week low at 2.70
AEG reached a 52 Week low at 2.53
I hope this ceo delivers on the Promises!
"Dodge and Cox certainly seems to appreciate this stock. Big owner, per ""Holders."""
1/256 chance of 7 days down in a row...
This is good buying opportunity. Buy..buy..buy.. ROE over 10% dividend paying company with pb less than 0.5 and debt equity less than 40%. This is best value stock in entire market as of now.. 
"This one should be over $5, way too cheaper."
AEG is up 12.21% to 2.39
"Why such a good stock is keeping on going down, when will this one turn around towards 5-6 range where it use to be....."
"Get out, it performs the way they want it to. How long do investors want to wait while there are real investments out there. This stock has been a dog for at least 20 years or when they purchased transamerica. No hope here. If you ever get a bump I'd suggest you sell fast and get out."
AEB reached a 52 Week low at $18.80
I am guessing stalled interest rates have brought the stock down? Have they not grown their fee based business? Someone mentioned that this is an income machine for the Dutch - any specifics?
AEG ceo is gonna Prove to me in 2 days whether he's doing his Job.........The sellOff this stock suffer after reporting earnings was Weird to say the least!
"AEG gets a ""strong buy"" rating from Zacks!"
"Huge volume, looks like some big guy bought.."
"Most of AEG's earnings come from Transamerica so it should benefit from US Tax law that was recently passed..............AXA/Allianz bot up like 2%, and AEG still has room to Ascend to above $8 so I sold 3K SAN today to put into AEG because why NOT!"
"It would seem if the stock price increases back to the $5 price level, it would be an opportunity to cash out, and recognize this stock as more of a trading stocking rather than a steady long term investment"
Is there an end to this tunnel?
"Let's give those AEG Executives a raise, the Dow is up, S&P is up and AEG is down. Could AEG be a defensive stock? One that goes up when the market goes down and vice versa. Noooooo - AEG goes down in both up and down markets. You have to really work long and hard to produce subpar results for an insurance company -- something AEG executives have been able to do for the last 8 years. Congratulations"
so at this rate this stock will be free by friday
Hope new CEO can fix this broken company. So many poor management decisions took the stock from $9 to $3 over a matter of a few years. I thought they may be wanting to sell when they gutted their US Retirement money maker of all experienced staff and lost a lot of clients since.

10$ stock???
"This stock is selling for only .21 cents on the dollar. 500,000 shares would only cost the company 1.5 billion of it's $12+ billion of cash on the balance sheet. This move might bring the stock closer to where it should be and might improve the eps."
"I like this ceo so Far since he's lowered costs some, and I do hope he gets it Lower than $200M for this year and another $150M next year.......why not?"
Can someone please tell me what happened to the December dividend?
Not sell this until 2019
Interesting price.
AEB reached a 52 Week low at 18.94
Like I said: It would Trade Solidly above $5……….I am Mothra.
anyone know why the may 1st quarter earnings haven't been released??
"Hello, I have a question. I came across this stock from a friend of mine who works for AEG. So, looking at the Financials, they have a little over $12 per share of available cash. I know earnings are light, but how does that justify the pps at being only $4.90? I'm new to this stock so don't hold it against me if there's something I'm not aware of. Please share your thoughts. I'd love to hear them."
Why has this company never really recovered from 2008? Should this not mean a senior management change?
"Looking for a sustained move above $5 per share. Old priced products requiring mortality adjustments have been priced in over the years for large losses, so a sustained move above $5 could bring in buyers not allowed to invest in ""penny"" stocks."
"I am new to this AEG. In a world where yield is so hard to come by, how do folks here feel about the recent elimination of dividends? I am surprised that the stock price has held up so well."
What’s up with today’s 9 million shares traded volume ?
"I think Aegon will report great earnings in August will finally post a upside surprise. If I am right and stand to be corrected, this stock finally trends up and the PE has a lot of room to expand. I Like the dividend which is very healthy. Well in a month we will know."
AEG reached a new 52 Week High at 6.56
Just bought in. Looks solid to me. In for the haul.
Dividend????????????????? sustainable???
"Positive comments from Deutsche Bank regarding European Insurers as a momentum trade for 2017 are moving AEG today along with peers. As of noon, AEG is trading with the greatest momentum. This is a a solid value name imo and I've been patiently waiting for the market to come around on this one. AEG is continuing to improve solvency and hopefully this is the market beginning to take notice of the value/safety this name offers in a market running hot."
"Hey Alex, do a stock buy back to get this turd some respect.Better yet resign!"
AEG reached a 52 Week low at 3.86
Surprise your shareholders again Mr. Friese.............Make these sellers Pay up for selling their shares!
European Inflation is expected to Post Increases this year so AEG should keep on going so next hurdle is $6 then $7......Watch them start posting derivative gains instead of taking charges when rates were falling.
this is possible the BEST value of all Insurance co's worldwide...the DIV should go to 40 cents ..............but at 5 times earns a bookvalue above $10/share
AEB reached a 52 Week low at $18.07
Been working this stock from 5 down to 1.5 and now splitting the difference. Other than the market news did anything other than common sense move this stock trading at 4 P/E normalized?
"On June 30,2021, AEG had revenue generating Investments pegged at 969M euros or $1.137T!for comparison their revenue generating investments on 3/31/2020 was 818M euros.......I like the stock better after review the financial supplement to 2Q2021. They have those separate in pdf form at their site."
did they cancel the dividend?
Aegon stock is on a free fall. The question is how low can it go?
AEB reached a new 52 Week Low at $22.74
"First you need to understand the financials of Life Insurance Companies, they would get bailed out or bought before they go bankrupt. Second, this company grows its SalesForce in this type of market. Third, the new retirement act puts Annuities in 401ks, what do you think that will do the the performance of this company?"
"bought a ton of shares at 3.83....great dividend...I don't care if it ever moves from 4.00....as long as it stays above 3.83 and does not cut the dividend, I am happy!"
Any thoughts on why its down 4% pre-market?
What a beat. Plus great divi hike and share buy back. I've been holding for years waiting for these jokers to turn it around.
AEG reached a 52 Week low at 3.38
AEG up 12% on 3/24/2020 but I cannot understand why if they may have a surge in payments of death benefits due to Corona 'virus. Viewpoints are welcome.
In december there is a conference call. I'm guessing AEG will be $6 by June 2021. They will resume divi from previously and continue to confound everyone by trading at $3x EPS
come on get with it AEG

Aegon is up 8.00% to 4.93
2025 à 30$ price
Don’t forget during the last year they never score $5 per share.....
Aegon cannot hold increases of it's share prices for long. it's a two steps forward three steps back approach.
"I know this company has had it's share of issues including mismanagement. However, i think they are now headed in the right direction with new CEO. This stock is trading at about 20% of it's book value."
This company has had the last few years to get their profit ratios in line------and the last quarter failed miserably. If it wasn't for tax changes in the US this company would have fallen $2/share today. Leadership is nonexistant; anbd the increase in dividend is irresponsible. I just sold my 2500 shares; and took a material loss. This stock will not go up.
AEG traded around $20/shr back in 2008.............Let's see what Effect these Lower Taxes here in the USA will have on the Bottom line since most of their Earnings come from TransAmerica!

Anyone know if company is still paying a dividend? Thx
"""Our strong capital position is a clear highlight this quarter, with a significant increase in the group's Solvency II ratio to 195%, which is now at the upper end of the target range. This enables our businesses to operate from a position of strength and underpins our target to return EUR 2.1 billion of capital to shareholders over the period 2016 to 2018. ""So, what does this mean? Is AEG going to achieve parity with PRU by raising their dividend to what PRU pays(.76), as opposed to the .31 we currently receive? Or does it mean something else entirely? Anybody know?"

"Two more days to either lift off or tank. Honestly, no idea. They sold some assets which may or may not have been wise. I have zero idea about their revenue and balance sheet moving forward."
"Any idea why AEG has nearlly 31K employees?To manage money, I doubt they need more than 3K employees so for this stock to go up they would have to start cutting their workforce by like 10% every couple quarters.............A Big airliner, Bank, Gocery chain, etc., so why would AEG need 30K employees? That seems like WAY too many to me and is probably the reason this company sucks so much with stock investors."

I am reading somewhere that AEG had a solvency ratio that fell a little under 200% and it was trumpeted as bad news. Any ideas why?
I stumbled upon Awesome Stocks and haven’t looked back since. Their last Nasdaq alert delivered 33% in a few days
If Aegon's roots go back to 175 years why is the stok price so low? That means no one's interested in this company. Something's not right. Ever since they bought Transamerica stock price keep has been on a free fall.
".25 Euro divi per share, share buy backs, reduction of debt, increase cash flow. I'm buying more today."
Puzzling. Euro 1.2B in cash. Increase dividend + pay down debt. Increase sales and some one time hits. Results: Price drops 8%. This is a sweet income stock. Keep buying.
"Wow...........We finally get a Great Gain from an Earnings Report-Nice........Most of my stocks were down, except the Largest gainer-AEG..........Get on board tomorrow if it falls some because this stock has NOT done much despite other Insurers going up these past 5+ years!"

There was no dec div. AEG pays twice a year not quarterly.
huge volumne and big drop. Hope Dodge and Cox isn't unloading. highly respected fund!
The Dutch bought the trans America building via transamaerica Why can’t we buy Greenland ?
"#AEG Getting ready for the bounce back up. P/E stands at 9.05, according to stoxline. Long over 6.32 for a run up to 7.39."
Why is this stock so cheap?
Why isn’t this at 5 $
Who is running AEG or the government and politicians? Why did the AEG board cave? I bought AEG because of how it was run and managed the business not how it responds to infiltration by the government!
"After all these years, finally some traction for this dog....congrats to all long suffering longs! Looks nice with all those cheap shares bought over the years on DRIP."
"this is a gift , great company and keeps dropping in price...must be a strong buy in my eyes"
Good price around 3$.

AEG has $1.137T under management while Prudential (PRU) has $2.1T........They are very similar so the ceo needs to copy Prudential Costs........He needs to get rid of that Issuing shares for dividends and Buying those shares back. That has to be costing money. I would Stop that today. The administration of AEG costs nearly as much as 22K employees and their benefits. That is way too much money on Administration.
Another Dutch CEO more of the same! Part of the Dutch welfare system!

"This stock should over $7, why is it still sitting around $5, loosing patience"
they should stop allowing advertising on these post boards I getting irritated see a message like Kylie on every board I look at.
Looks like that stock buyback is perfect. Love the management more all the time.
Having said that their PE value remains under 10 and I'm not certain the shamdemic isn't being used as an excuse for new CEO to take a butchers cleaver to this old style management team. I'm in at 2.50 for a pound and a pence.
Why no financial statements for 2018? Normally how are they reported
Another streak of seven. Pure agony
What is going on??? Nice up tic.
This stock should be bought oyt by a US company.
"Or, someone just realized AEG is no longer providing quarterly earnings. For 2018, forward, only mid-year and year-end reporting."
Nice 1rst Quarter results leading to a big gain today. Hurray.
Oh No! Another 4yrs. of Alex! The BOD of AEG are blind! Look at the price of AEG over the last 10 yrs. Alex is not a good C.E.O.!

"This is a funny stock. For a euro based insurance company their debt load is quite low. Their P/E ratio is under 5, they posted not a shocking quarter. It wasn't great, but it was only down 6% from previous year. So why is it trading so low? It seems to be a sector bias, because EQH for example also seems criminally undervalued."
"I don't guess we apply that 842M euros to earnings since that would means eps= $0.47/shr......I think you have to use the 562M euros bringing earnings to $0.33/shr which seems huge to me, and that means that this stock can go above $10 if they do that Consistently."

IBM says their cloud administration will Reduce Costs for those 800k+ plans........I have no clue how much they told the company they can save so I'll be watching to see if they Reduce head count too.
Will they ever give AEG a p/e=10? That would get the stock above $7 ..............I sold 3K SAN shrs today and 3K NMR since both were up nicely and planning to put the money in this dog since I believe they'll post earnings greater than $500M this quarter and expect them to consistently be posting good earnings......VOYA looks good too so might add to my position there also depending on which is down when I buy.
Aegon hit $5.00.
Have had a large number of shares since 2014 hoping for anything positive while taking the dividend. Last week began to get out. Nothing and I mean nothing is ever positive to the stock price. Look at the low percentage of industry holders. Something stinks here that is designed to benefit the parent or some group of insiders. A waste of time and resources to own this stock. My opinion.
What's going on at Aegon..It's down 14 points from riding high just yestetday. Company is going down the deep end.
Just bought some more AEG after being down 12% on this.
Why are we at a 52 week low ?? When will we see $4.00 again?
Aegon is on a free fall. All the gains made the last few weeks wiped out & continue to shed with no end in sight.
tommorow what will happen ? any opinion please ?
"earnings should be released today...but I can't find anything. For a company with over a trillion dollars in assets they sure do have a #$%$ PR team. My guess is their $2B in surplus cash was invested and is now up 30% from March. Once they re-instate the divi, this stock should be at $10, but the Euro bias continues."
nice volume today. Anyone with a nice data subscription have anything on AEG activity? Or was this just a FX related move? I'm bullish long-term on AEG based on relative valuation and fundamentals but I don't really post around here I primarily lurk. GL to all you longs out there and thanks for contributions on this board.
am surprised buffet doesn't jump on this one. ..it would fit his portfolio of businesses well
Aegon is up 10.65% to 3.22
"Insurance company dividends were ""deferred"" by the govt. Hopefully this will not last long and dividends will be reinstated or even paid late if the earnings are maintained."
When you outsource 2100 jobs and say it will save money is an admission that your management team stinks.I'll bet in two years they will be doing the same job with less workers(1500).
AEG reached a new 52 Week Low at $5.49
"December 10th AEG has some kind of announcement on Capital Markets. Until then, not much to see here."
"Wheaton’s, unlikely they have much exposure and would not effect much if they did. Dividend should be safe short of a worse disaster and the Dutch would never let this company fail. The company is simply a very solid yet second tier company in their space. I’ve owned it off and on for years. Don’t expect much. Probably should be traded and not a long term holding. Best to you."
I have decided this stock is DEAD money. Too much debt in the world in our financial experiment to support rising interest rates coupled with the fact that AEG has not made a profit in a very long time and capitalization is in question.
No never buying this sh88tt
"The floating/fixed rate preferred AEB is better , but not a lot. 4% and trading at a discount of about 15% to face value."
I am hoping Aegon stock price will rise from the merger with Banco Santander.
AEG reached a 52 Week low at 3.36
I have never seen a worse stock to own that this.....even if you bought it just for the dividend you got royally screwed....
VERY happy now!!!
