"Why such a good stock is keeping on going down, when will this one turn around towards 5-6 range where it use to be....."
This company has had the last few years to get their profit ratios in line------and the last quarter failed miserably. If it wasn't for tax changes in the US this company would have fallen $2/share today. Leadership is nonexistant; anbd the increase in dividend is irresponsible. I just sold my 2500 shares; and took a material loss. This stock will not go up.
Like I said: It would Trade Solidly above $5……….I am Mothra.
AEG ceo is gonna Prove to me in 2 days whether he's doing his Job.........The sellOff this stock suffer after reporting earnings was Weird to say the least!
"I know this company has had it's share of issues including mismanagement. However, i think they are now headed in the right direction with new CEO. This stock is trading at about 20% of it's book value."
For a company that has been around for over 175 years Aegon stock price should be a lot higher.
Aegon hit $5 today. please no sell off tomorrow.
In december there is a conference call. I'm guessing AEG will be $6 by June 2021. They will resume divi from previously and continue to confound everyone by trading at $3x EPS
"First you need to understand the financials of Life Insurance Companies, they would get bailed out or bought before they go bankrupt. Second, this company grows its SalesForce in this type of market. Third, the new retirement act puts Annuities in 401ks, what do you think that will do the the performance of this company?"
For a large company AEG stock price should be much higher.
"Trading at 9 PE. Tesla among others trading at 1600PE.

What a beat. Plus great divi hike and share buy back. I've been holding for years waiting for these jokers to turn it around.
this simply won't break 5.
"This is a funny stock. For a euro based insurance company their debt load is quite low. Their P/E ratio is under 5, they posted not a shocking quarter. It wasn't great, but it was only down 6% from previous year. So why is it trading so low? It seems to be a sector bias, because EQH for example also seems criminally undervalued."
AEG has $1.137T under management while Prudential (PRU) has $2.1T........They are very similar so the ceo needs to copy Prudential Costs........He needs to get rid of that Issuing shares for dividends and Buying those shares back. That has to be costing money. I would Stop that today. The administration of AEG costs nearly as much as 22K employees and their benefits. That is way too much money on Administration.
I hope this ceo delivers on the Promises!
"I like this ceo so Far since he's lowered costs some, and I do hope he gets it Lower than $200M for this year and another $150M next year.......why not?"
"On June 30,2021, AEG had revenue generating Investments pegged at 969M euros or $1.137T!for comparison their revenue generating investments on 3/31/2020 was 818M euros.......I like the stock better after review the financial supplement to 2Q2021. They have those separate in pdf form at their site."
"Looking for a sustained move above $5 per share. Old priced products requiring mortality adjustments have been priced in over the years for large losses, so a sustained move above $5 could bring in buyers not allowed to invest in ""penny"" stocks."
"I don't guess we apply that 842M euros to earnings since that would means eps= $0.47/shr......I think you have to use the 562M euros bringing earnings to $0.33/shr which seems huge to me, and that means that this stock can go above $10 if they do that Consistently."
