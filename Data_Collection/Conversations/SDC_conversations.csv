Zero after hours reaction from Align Investor Day. Their whole presentation sounds defensive and when you look at their product portfolio and realize that they need the aligner market to sell all of their OTHER products into the doctor channel. SDC isn't trying to sell scanners and other related info.
"2B market cap, imagine if they get even half the lawsuit, instant double from here."
