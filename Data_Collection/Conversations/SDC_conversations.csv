UH ohh.... shorts shaking
"$SDC squeeze alert Ortex short squeeze alert type 1,2, AND 3 is officially in for $sdc Let’s goooooo!!First leg up Price target +$25https://twitter.com/edward_petez/status/1445987419807895552?s=21"
New baggies just got trapped.You have been REDITTED.
So much for being a meme stock? I highly doubt it!
Been a bit more activity on this forum tonight compared to the last week. Usually it's just Clarissa downvoting everything
I will never understand especially this morning when the stock was up $.18 how shorts can drive that down plus another 10 or $.12 down and yet Longs could not keep it positive I will never understand that!
Guys this manipulation to get share price under certain amount due to options is a joke IMO. The $6 strike expiring this week has huge volume and I bet we will close right underneath it of course…. I’ve been long for several years and will continue to be long. Just shocking how the share price can be so heavily influenced.
The options for next week are really cheap— hedges buy them up— Monday Tuesday we will go up the options will go up they will sell them — by Friday they will manipulate all back down so the options are worthless and they keep that cash register a rolling
Align is paying the hedgies the big bucks to make a last attempt to keep the stock down so they can close their short positions. This is a typical move on a high short stock:You will suddenly see the short interest drop like 10% overnight. Just watch. Squeeze is imminent 
I'm sensing an upcoming merger/buyout. Just my opinion.
I don’t understand how these shorties can bring the price down when I keep on buying and holding and never selling?
Not that it matters but the chart clearly shows shorts are using this opportunity to cover before the big rally

It’s going higher !1 year Target over $ 10.
Nice....was able to get some $5.98. Any other Longs here get it?
"How many patents has this company had approved in less than 2 weeks? The CEO of this company is a veteran INVESTOR. Look him up. Largest shareholder is a huge Private Equity firm who will support this company when needed I would imagine. You gotta figure management is sick & tired of the sliming and the naked shorting. Besides artificially depressing the stock price, it takes management's attention away from where it should be: running and growing the company's business. I think it is safe speculation that management is huddled around a table discussing how to blow the shorts out of the water. Just my opinion, but I don't see how they can't be at this point. This is destructive to their business and a company should not have their business adversely affected by unrestricted naked short selling. On the bright side, the shorts learned nothing from AMC/GME and it is going to possibly be a very painful lesson for them once again."
Nice finish. Those who sold yesterday and today will regret.
5M more shares traded in last 22 minutes!
Smile direct club is not going anywhere.
Adding more myself
Time for the double up!
"Very easy today! These are the moments you wait for! Don’t sell, just buy and hodl… this is possibly a huge moment! "
My broker said SDC is 60% short
Strong power hour let’s go
"Investors suddenly buying LOTS of the 7.0 calls for around $0.05. LOTS. This was not happening earlier-a good sign IMO. This is what happened last week right before someone pushed the stock up 30% over 2 days......Not a bad idea to but some cheap, OTM calls with yolo money. Money you don't mind losing of course as options are risky."
"Bought 1000 more let’s go, I’m still up almost 20%"
We buy. We hold. We smile.
Shorts must cover.
If Shorts wait until tomorrow it could get very expensive.
"*CORRECTION....my bad, ALGN down $6 not %"
Now that daily chart looks like a smile
Really?
got 6200 shares at 5.73$.be patience buy and hold
Just like clock red again. The “massive short squeeze” is on delay…again
https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/q7llxn/sdc_staying_strong_another_perfect_buying_day/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
33% short interest ratio. This will make shorts vulnerable for a squeeze.
The sdc business model is the same as what Amazon did! Capture the market and then turn on the profit valve
"@Khen Bo....me too, $6.02-$6.03...missed that $5.99"
"Buy, don't sell and watch the price increase. The Shorts are now out of ammo."
This will turn back green in an hour or so haha
60% less than Invisilign..
Where is the CEO when we need him?
Good news everyone!I sold my position so this should start mooning anytime now.
"Every LONG, call your broker and make sure you long shares are NOT available to be shorted. Instruct them that you don't want to lend your shares."
"SDC undervalued, once people start realizing how much cheaper and efficient they are, we will moon"
Am I still holding?
Gonna be a nice week
I hope some Longs are joining me in the Buys here.
is this loading week?
squeeze coming
Just get in 11420 shares See u guys next week (:
Shares to borrow decreased to from >1M to 100k
"sold CEMI and bought 2750 @6.19$, let’s go guys"
"@meanrevers - Obviously, I'm long on SDC. But....here's my complaint about SDC.....SDC's PR leadership/function is horrible. SDC may have strong leadership, but the public doesn't see them. IMO, if they would replace the current CEO with a veteran in the business that has a proven track record, the price would shoot up. I want to see the CEO, not the CFO all the time. There's a time and place for each of them."
Huge Action AMhmmmmmm??Whats going on
Just bought 100 more shares
Super consolidation today
"@M - Just mute Clarissa TS ( and his/her many other aliases). I did yesterday. I love to hear both sides of a trade, but there is not substance with his/her posts, just juvenile nonstop bashing."
SDC is all over reddit! This week will be huge for SDC
tomorrow is setting up to be a brutal day for the shorts right?
up 1 penny...I'll take it. green day.
"I says Gamma, You say Squeeze!!"
I believe it's up 30% in two days.
Adding more— love the sale
Market is mostly green and our friend is red again. Pretty frustrating…. And volume is nowhere to be seen. Seems like people have moved on. Ugh
"Buy and Hold. PT throughout Reddit is $26.00 (SDC cannot dilute until this price is reached).ORTEX100% Utilization (7 days straight now - talk about a coiled spring)Cost to Borrow 48% and increasing todaySI 46.55M Shares / SI 47%~60% of float is on loanHOLD, Buy Dips, Rinse and Repeat.Let's go!"
@d.....now how is buying at $5.88 getting squeezed ?
Wow! Investors are reluctant to pay six dollars for the stock in two years it’ll be $40!
I just bought the dip
Sdc to the moon! 50+!
"@Clarissa TS - Why has Align gone from $732 to $580/share in less than a month, and is suffering an almost $50/share loss today?"
@Clarissa TSHow much time do you spend on this board? Everyday you’re posting dozens of messages criticizing those who are playing this stock. What caused you to have a personal vendetta against SDC?
Bulls takes the steering wheel today.
I don’t know how much longer this can consolidate before the big blow up. Great company. It keeps wanting to pop. We shall see what next week brings. Huge call volume next week that would be amazing to expire in the money! Have a great weekend all.
im all in 700 shares at $5.88
We are here baby!
"YUP, I think its going to be awhile...put it on the shelf with the others.."
Short interest is up .04%—they are trying hard to keep it down
Keep buying guys
That is the logical response: That SDC is taking market share from Align and our results for Q3 will hopefully show that distribution of money spent on Aligners is shifting over to SDC!!
Tomorrow we pass 6.50$
its so hilariously shorted
No Volume again ....only 53% of the 10-Day Average and 71% of the 90-Day Average. We need to bring the Volume up next week.
This company reminds me of Amazon when it got started... lots of losses to gain massive market share... then they flipped the profit switch! Sdc will do the same
"I just bought more, who doesn't love straight teeth for an affordable price."
"According to Ortex, with the average volume over the past 3 weeks, it will take the shorts 4 days(!) to cover all their shares, if they all do it at the same time. No reason to sell on a upswing, because it will take days for shorts to cover their position, possibly up to a week (given they wont all do it at the same time). And the average cost to borrow for people who want to take a new short possition is 240%. So there you go"
"@KC....easy answer. ALGN is losing marketshare to SDC. More and more dentists are moving over here, IMO. Dr. Peter is not alone."
Top 15 short squeeze potential stocks: SDChttps://thefinanceheadline.com/top-15-short-squeeze-stocks-october-14-2021-wkhs-sdc-view-blnk-fuv-goev-ater-prog-more/
I'm good with stock price trading at the companies potential which is around $10 for now until the company really starts showing growth.....BUT if the Reddit gang wants to run this to $50 I wouldn't have any complaints!!! lol
"Something fishy seems to be going on with the Ortex/Fintel data. Can anyone explain how the Short shares have dropped 13M, SI has dropped 8% and stock continues to move downward? How does that make sense? Is there a delay of some sort? It doesn’t add up… didn’t something similar happen right before GME and AMC took off?"
Anyone have the recent Ortex data? Is it still showing a triple short squeeze indication? Just curious what the numbers are now.
Market maker magic so options can expire worthless
Shorts in for a huge surprise when sales go up going forward because of the social media blowup. You've been warned sheep.
Red again. Buying more shares Mikey?
"Will buy more. Squeeze or not, i definitely think its a great investment!"
"As a dentist $SDC is not a squeeze play for me. I have been invested for a very long time, and I’ve continuously added to my long term portfolio. This is my retirement stock. Short term target is $25+. But I definitely think in the next 5-10 years they will be +$100’s.As a dentist, I have a direct insight in how $sdc is doing in the market, as I offer sdc at all my dental offices, and I’ve seen nothing but positive feedback from all my patients and their results. You might ask yourself why I would support sdc if they are eating off my plate? Up to January 2020 Invisalign had a patent that they were the only ones allowed to work directly with dentists. As that expired, $sdc have signed up with over 1,800 dental offices only in the US! This is a mutual beneficial relationship as these patients that are referred to us dentist needs dental work and treatments prior to getting $sdc.$SDC has a strategic growth, which is why they have partnered with CVS, Walmart and other big retailers. And further expanded internationally.Their growth is in its infant stage, and this is just the beginning. Hedgefunds are unfortunately unaware of what they have shorted, and now are stuck trying to find a way to close their shorts by manipulating the stock. They will be squeezed to oblivion sooner or later. Just sit back and enjoy the ride For full transparency: I’m holding 100k shares of SDC in my long term portfolio."
"Slap yourself if you got shaken out at $6. Past two days has been low volume days, which short sellers always take advantage of to easily push the stock price down. Don’t focus on day to day fluctuation when the ultimate target is gonna be way higher from here . $sdc"
Love the stock
Looks like the shorts won the sprint but I am in for the marathon.
"Thanks Shorts and MMs. My best Buy so far today, $5.725....I hope other Longs here have been able to join me."
i'm not worried. SDC is an industry disruptor just like Wayfair did with the furniture industry.
"Going to be 7$ end of the day, 7.5$ after market"
Just checked shares available to short on Fidelity. Still at ZERO. But the really interesting thing is that the borrowing rate was at 8.5% ALL WEEK and today it is at 24.25%.
Now to see if the market makers will try to drive down below 6.50 and 6.00 for options purposes. I’m very long and been holding for some time. Great company.
Looking forward to market open. Buying more.
this is the easiest play I've ever seen
I’m buying another 750 shares at the open!
"They are walking this down with extremely low volume. It will close below 5.50 unfortunately. Not enough buying and a LOT of shorting still. We will win eventually, but we need more buyers."
"Yep, more at $5.735....rotating some gains out, like GOCO"
"4,700 shares deep. Really feel like I should get the 300 more to get to 5,000. Thumbs up if I should do it?"
i like the stock
If this reaches 70$….holly molly…can’t describe how much money I’m gonna have lol
hold
Sdc will be the Amazon of teeth!
I don't know why anyone wastes their time on this board bantering about short and long positions... this is definitely a long term wait and see stock... they are taking losses now to grow market share... just like Amazon did for years... then turn on the profit valve... just like Amazon
Backing up to the loading dock here.
"Just bought 40,000 shares a little late to the party. Cant wait for this stock to be at 15$!"
The final destination is $25+. What happens on the route doesn’t matter. Close your computer and check back in a month. 
The stock is absolutely going to rock tomorrow! At 9:30 AM I will buy another 500 shares!
I holding 1200 shares @6.6$ and I will hold. Even if it dip under 5.5$ I add next 1200 shares
I like it when someone comments on my Post and I can't see it. Some Muted Shortie.
Ater and SDC at play next week
I’m thinking about buying tomorrow in the morning? Do you guys see this running like AMC or GMe??
"Shorts haven't exited their positions yet, only 20k shares available to short. If retail would just hold we could squeeze. Honestly undervalued company as well. They really have limited competition. ALGN is distribution through orthodontist, and SDC is distribution through B2C, Telehealth, and Dentists."
lets gooo
"I muted all the bots on here, but I can see them leaving comments and downvoting everything"
"I understand shorting a mature company with deteriorating fundamentals that is severely overleveraged and which is tripping debt covenants and having to resort to high coupon debt which is horrible for the company. I get that. BUT this is NOT that type of company. This is a small cap GROWTH company which had sales of $145 million in 2017 and sales of $657 in 2020. Pretty impressive growth, hardly a deteriorating business. They also did a convertible note offering earlier this year which allowed them to pay off some of their prior debt and has a ZERO coupon and maturity in 2026. They have just under $400 MILLION in cash so this company has lots and lots of running room. YEARS. Are the shorts going to keep up their naked shorting attack for YEARS? Pretty sure they are going to get blown out of the water as the company gets traction internationally and domestically after several years of attacks from the Dentists and Orthodontist communities (just like Uber & Lyft were attacked by the taxi lobby) seem to be finally ending (because SDC is prevailing in court). The largest shareholder is a billion dollar Private Equity firm. The CEO is (or was) a Billionaire investor listed on the Forbes list. They have a $2.85 Billion lawsuit filed against NBC Media for a show that ran on TV in which Smile Direct claims they maliciously and knowingly slandered (among other things) them. One of the defendants who worked at NBC and was involved in the TV show in question had a husband who is in the dental/ortho business and competes with SDC. Gee.....how convenient. Imagine if they win this suit. Imagine if they even settle for 20% of the $2.85B? Their attorneys represented the Beef industry in a similar suit against ABC and the won. Look it up. I just don't get why the shorts would be so intent on continuing this nonsensical behavior UNLESS they are trapped. Maybe that is it. This is going to end up being under the banner of ""big mistake"". BIG mistake guys. You should have learned your lesson with AMC and Gamestop."
today is the day
Relax buy and hold
"SDC has alot of play to go especially the next few trading sessions, I'm a holder...patience is a virtue.."
Holding strong and not leaving
in at 5.87 see you at 8 next week
"@Rex.....remember the recent increases when SDC cruised up like 40% over several trading days when the stock markets were down during the same period? I remember. The major investors will come with the Q3 ER, IMO. They will see that SDC has turned the tide from the Q2 blip that resulted in SDC falling like a rock. The price can lift as quickly too, especially with all the SI that is now in place. Just a few more weeks."
Forget the squeeze this stock will be $50 within 3-5 years buy and hold!! This stock will go up naturally without squeeze in long run. Anything under $7 is a great buy!
more SDC post of WSB. The more attention to sdc the better.
"1 penny spread with 11.2 M volume this how smart money cover by controlling the spread, whole 5 minute candle is at 5.86 5.87 5.85 5.86, it’s getting on my nerves"
As a young guy if other people aren’t prepared to buy the stock as I am if it goes down to $.16 today it will be down four days in a row and I will lose $2000 and I can’t afford more than that so I will be forced to sell ! anyway good luck!
Who's got chips left for the dip????
"As a short, I am merely concerned about SDC. I could care less whether align rallies, or drops 75% in one day. This is about SDC. Bulls need to stop justifying their bags of losses holding sdc as somehow being connected to align."
Shorts already buying back hard in pre-market…
"Look at all the Bids....crazy.. And, the SDC is the most discussed....07:26 AM EDT, 10/12/2021 (MT Newswires) -- SmileDirectClub ( SDC ) , the most actively discussed stock on the meme board, was up 0.7% pre-market Tuesday following Monday's closing 7.27% lower. The stock revolves around the $6.12 level."
It’s really disheartening when I bought another 750 shares at the open and it is down again! Can the lungs all please not sell and just add a few more and this stock will skyrocket because that’s where it should be!
Is SDC showing some backbone at $5.50! Alright maybe there is some fight in there!
Buying all day.
MMs will lift the price hoping to generate a few shares for their Shorting. Don't sell and watch the price increase. Buy more and watch it increase even faster.
"Clarissa TS, the bot who neither sleeps nor slumber "
"@Daniel....not only holding, but Buying"
If you are holding shares long the chart sure looks sweet!
"put your shares up for $8 - $10, they cant short them.."
Can you smell the desperation to keep this in the red?
SDC’s ceo should do what ATER’s CEO is doing and hire an outside agency to look at the manipulation of the stock
magic time....5.48 lol
I'm in 5000 shares at 6.50
be patience jus buy and hold if u can.squeeze coming weeks
It's interesting that the news release regarding the SmileBus patent wasn't on Yahoo Finance today. I had to go to Stocktwits to see it.
"@Peter..thanks for your Post Dr. Peter. My dentist is also an investor in SDC. He says his colleagues are investors as well. They see the incredible potential with this company, growing and growing. I'm really looking forward to Q3 ER next month."
"40% after hours, I can feel it"
How is it that shorties have more money than longs? Days when the stock is up it goes right back down! But days when it goes down it stays down and goes further! Why?
can we just break through $8
"They trying hard to push it down, unfortunately algo dont help when no shares available to short"
Squeeze hasn’t even started yet
"Anyone else excited for Q3 ER and Q4 / 2021 annual guidance? 2022? Momentum is building, and the corner is turning, IMO."
"Re: the Motley Fool article: Read the disclosure at the bottom that Motley Fool ""owns shares of and recommends Align Technology"". If that is not enough, consider that they reportedly wrote similar hit pieces on GameStop as it was rising, and are rumored to have financial ties, perhaps indirect relationships but a connection nevertheless, to certain hedge funds that are likely big shorts. You can google all this and there are posters on reddit who explain in further detail the connections and why such articles may be quite biased. Remember, the big shorts still haven't covered and are obviously becoming quite concerned and probably near the edge of desperation themselves."
Ride the bumps .... I make most my money surprisingly on red days ... And I'm long !
"This is starting to feel a bit ""criminal"".....day after day.....planned hit piece after planned hit piece...."
"My msg to who buy and he’s still holding ,, don’t worry about your 30 or 50 cents loss , watch the data before and now and compare the price, reddit army on his way coming behind me they are little bet busy with this company ((progenity)) right now but they will arrive in couple hours maybe 48 hours or less (: , there’s a lot money here it’s gonna go up minimum 50% not because the company worth $9 per share but for data to be balanced Good luck every one and smile for money they are coming (:"
Stifel due diligence says Align is going to have a soft quarter. Well where do you think the sales went.
Shorts will buy.
Buying at open tomorrow.
"Come on guys, I even talked my dad into buying 500 shares when it opens this morning ! We don’t want to lose all our gains to the shorters so let’s buy and hold!"
All the shorties can do is drive this down to five bucks and I’m not selling till it’s $40.00. So how can they possibly win ? I’m a very patient man and will never sell!
Just bought another 500 shares thank you very much
"The price is going down and the amount of shares available according to I borrow desk has risen from 250k to 1.1 million this morning. Doesn’t make a lot of sense to me and is pretty frustrating…. Bears may have more strength then bulls on this one. I hope I’m wrong. Ugh, frustrated. https://iborrowdesk.com/report/SDC"
Not bad… not green but after two big days this seems like the pause before next pop.
The windows for Shorts to exit is closing.
no volume yet...... just loading up at these prices
interactive brokers is now charging 92.14% intrest rate if your short
buy on the dip. hold and wait for the pop
I’m a brand new trader on Reddit I can’t believe it but I just bought 500 shares today and it’s at 8% so happy!!
I don’t understand why the shorts are spamming this board if they are so confident the stock price is going to drop! Clarissa been on fire over the weekend!
volume is much higher than yesterday
Shorts - Time Running Out
Jumping this week?
"Does anyone know the current status of the $2.85 Billion litigation that Smile Direct filed against NBC on May 18, 2020? SmileDirectClub attorney J. Erik Connolly was one of the lead attorneys for Beef Products Inc. in its 2012 lawsuit against Walt Disney Co. ’s ABC News. That lawsuit sought $1.9 billion in damages in connection with the network’s reports on a textured beef product that critics dubbed ""pink slime,” one of the largest defamation cases to go to trial in U.S. history.The case was settled in June 2017. Disney disclosed in August 2017 that it paid a net sum of $177 million after insurance recoveries in connection with a settlement but didn’t name the plaintiff."
"In one month, Align stock dropped 19% months which is $130 whereas SDC dropped only 2% which is just $0.14. We can see a clear Winner is SDC. This clarisa bot needs to due the due diligence before spreading lies."
Looks like round 2 is about to begin…..
"@Samantha....you're not very keen are you? Where do you think those ALGN sales are going? To SDC, that's where. SDC is picking up ALGN market share. This is what the ALGN loyalists have been concerned about from the start. Don't you get it? I know you do, just can't admit it. You are being paid to say otherwise."
$5.725-$5.75 looking good. Hope some Longs joined in.
"20 bucks says if this turns red for a second , Clarissa will be back"
"Don't forget, TIME is on our side. We don't pay interest on our shares, but they do pay interest on their short. They will soon be forced to cover, and since almost 3/4 of all shares is either shorted or held by institutions, ALL of us will be able to command how much we want for our shares before selling. You want 10, you'll get 10. You want 50, you'll get 50. We must hold tight tell a fair price is reached. According to my DD, 30$ is a base target."
"Same time, same place tomorrow shorts! Oh by the way, we are bringing our friend volume tomorrow!!"
Patience will pay off my friends
The key to making money in this game is realizing when a stock has more upside than downside. Look at the growth in the company and look at the chart. The company is growing and the price has found bottom or near bottom. The more you buy now the more youll be happy when it goes to true valuation. Avg down and be patient.
"just relax, turning green soon soon, trust the process"
Time for me to buy
"My 40,000 shares are looking good. Make sure you HOLD!!!! I’ll maybe sell when it hits $100."
Clarissa where are you? It’s Tanking. Your late to post. You have to tell us we got reddited and ask about our smiles
Pulled back into the loading dock for some of that $5.7036 the last 15 minutes of trading.
30 more minutes for the crooks to get it down another .015
Can someone explain me how they bought back 10M shorted shares without significant price movement? Do we see increased number of fails to deliver?
"@Ricky.....don't be discouraged. If you can hold, do so. I picked up another 4K shares today in the $5.75 zone. I've been to the SDC Smile Shop in DC. I saw what this company is doing. Q3 is coming in a few weeks. Don't bail now."

My fav bk play for 2022.
"@Clarissa TSHey, how much you get for each post?"
I thought this was going to the moon?
Movement soon.
$SDC will rocket
Loading up long haul $12.50 target
Why is it not squeezing bulls? Thought align hack was good news Instead you’re taking another rod! Haha
Holding strong.
go look at BBIG it's the same as SDC heavily shorted stocks with squeeze potential. if you think sdc won't squeeze then dump your shares so others can buy em and hold. sdc to the moon
"CTB 78%, short sale blocked, teported SI 40%"

The stock is a favorite of bulls of late. Since dipping back near $6.50 it is lately holding upside strength just above $6.65."
"bought 5,500 more shares 6.12"
7 then 11
they reeeeeally don't want it going past 7 lmao TOO BAD! WE'RE GOING!
Anyone else Buying here with me at $5.74?
shorties can go play on a busy highway or the Hershey highway 
"ALGN is down almost $50/share today because SDC patent victory is taking customers away!!!!! Buy, Buy, Buy!!!!!"
Consolidated very strong at 5.8$ .. charts show neck pattern that means targets are big 12$+ this price u can’t get soon after
buy it all most of the float is bought up time to rise
@Wilma- what did the Ater CEO do per your earlier post? Thanks
Added. Not sure what is going on but its cheap.
"No Volume today, just the usual manipulation from the MMs in concert with Shorts. Only 58% of the 10-Day Average Volume and even under the 90-Day Average. Let's bring the Volume back up at this price. The AH price in the high $5s should be really attractive here."
Listen  SDC has only gone up 30% in 4 days. A LOT of stock does that without being talked Down by wierd articles. SDC have had 1-2 bad articles written about them every day since the not alarming 30% rise ??You must ask yourself why this is happening. To me its obvious that someone with press access is very worried and want to scare People.Hold tight …
Clarissa...I thought I was going to lose half of yesterday's gain today? What happened?
How can this not squeeze? Shares shorted and cost to barrow is so high now! I think three days to cover?Just my Bag Holder opinion.
Some financial publications were writing about how the billionaire CEO and his son were buying SDC stock a couple of years ago after a downturn and at higher prices than where we are now. Wonder if they are buying now? If so and its gets disclosed that will be a serious stamp of approval and confidence. Wall St likes when management/owners buy their own stock with their own money.
"Clarissa has over 9,400 posts , this bot never sleeps."
How can the stock drop 8% on Monday and then drop again today?
Shorts going to cover tomorrow especially the ones with more than a quarter but if we hold we will get our price
TODAY IS THE DAY
Gotta think SDC leadership will release some positive news soon. They seem to be in touch with recent performance and work to give a catalyst when one is needed.
@Daniel...'Here we go'.....Buying more today.

Buying at $5.88-$5.89. Still some cash on hand for any further dips.
700K in SDC and I’m chilling. Won’t sell a penny til I have $3M profits. Let’s go. Just the beginning.  https://twitter.com/edward_petez/status/1446540298583117825?s=21
This looks like it’ll pop. Had to get on board here in AH
It's real simple....just don't sell and the price will rise.
"Just got home now, in enough time to pick-up 2,500 shares at $5.51....Keep digging Shorts !"
"The float is high, that is why the spread is small and the volume will be much higher, every body jumps in when the swings are volatile."
Axel time again.
This stock is heading to space for sure! congrats to those who are in below 7
I have just 35 shares and looking forward to buy more in the coming weeks and months.
We’re losing the battle. We’ve lost most of the gain. Shorts driving us back down. Good thing I’m in for the long haul
$10 this week!
"$7 is the resistance, once we break through this we should see more short covering to $7.5 before the weekend. Will be interesting."
ALGN down another 6%.....I expect more investors from ALGN to realize how undervalued SDC is vs. ALGN and come and take a position here.
SDC is primed for a Gamma Squeeze … let the Call Option Payouts Begin. 
"Missed that $5.99, but did grab $6.02"
The next AMC move. This one.
