"I feel bad for all the retail shorts in this stock, when volume comes back to SDC. On November 19th their are 30,000 call options at the 10$ strike price which is more than all the other puts combined. Until then every Friday their are at least 6,000 calls executing at the 6 dollar call price. All the big players started shorting this back on 6/30 when this was trading for around 9 dollars. They are going to be fine but the retail shorts who have gotten in over the last 2 months may get blown out once the fire sell starts and big money brings this back to what they paid for it back in June."
Just bought in guys. The shorts can only hold for so long
Borrow fee - 13%
The SI has increased 2.2% through the day. A net 1 million shares increase on loan. Shorts just are willing to give up quite yet.
"@Jonathon...what spamming, other than Shorts. I'd rather call it spewing. Some actual news....SI is up. Live data from Ortex. Actual news....SDC expanding retail product offerings. Actual news.....the aligner industry is forecasted to grow. Actual news....SDC expanding internationally."
The shorts are not letting up and the paper hands are helping them.Hold your shares!
Symetrical wedge pattern forming...SDC will recover..
I feel like a stock is being manipulated when there are a steady 10K bid and ask trades one penny apart throughout the trading day. this is strange and manipulation in my opinion
@JOhn.. is that you million candle ?
Hold the line!
"Longs, look at the game that's being played. They are trying to shake you out. Hedge funds are swinging shares back and forth to each other. LolBuy and Hold."
Seems like every day is a “load up” day. Fight back SDC…. Have some pride. This is pretty frustrating…
"The Hedge firms/MMs continue to play musical chairs, passing Buys and Sells of loaned shares among each other. Someone is going to get caught Short when the music stops. And, the party is coming to an end. What shuts the party down? How about growth, expansion and improved profitability."
Need another 2.1M candle
Doubled position today. It’s coming
"I’m only down $8k, but the rewards are massive , Hold Hold can’t emphasize it enough"
"The double bottom is closing in. Short interest at all-time highs. 5$ approaching. Earnings report in just over a week. Don't make it all for nothing, don't sell."
"Looks like some Shorts want to play. Net borrowed shares have increased +237K shares this morning. Both the SI and Days to Cover are up slightly. Be ready to Buy, if you can. And if you do Buy, HOLD. Don't get into day trading. Q3 ER a week from Monday, Nov. 8th after market close."
"The jig is up for the Shorts. They made tons of $ driving SDC down from the double digits. It's now the Longs' turn, and some nice reward to those that bought some of the Shorted shares, especially here in the $5s. They're is some time left. If you have any cash sitting, it's time to Buy before it's back to the double digits again. Nov. 8th is coming."
BOOM!
Bought more!Hold!
back to $7 in no time. Load the truck and hold. Shorts will cover quickly
Net Shares Borrowed and SI both back up. A good Buying day just before the weekend.
"Management needs to sue ""Investor Place"" which is repeatedly running hit jobs with false information in them."

Why aren't they covering this headline?SmileDirectClub Sues NBC for $2.8 Billion Over Alleged Errors and Defamation.Would love to know whatever happened with that.
Strong build for Longs .. Squeeze soon Targets min 25+ am holding
"Look at daily chart and you will see the build up at the end of symmetrical wedge pattern forming at the end of bearish trend, the breakout is going to be so volatile as we get closer to ER 11/8/21"
"To my fellow LONGS, in the coming days leading to Nov. 19th and beyond, expect the attacks from the SHORTS to get more and more vicious and violent. BE READY!Buy and Hold!"
@Aseel - Is Clarissa TS still around? I muted her and her multiple personalities a while back. It was a great move!
Remember one thing Y'all. The same Hedge funds that are shorting will soon have to cover and go long. These are some amateur shorts trying to make a few cents right now. The real shorts shorted SDC in the teens not 5's.Hold. Buy the dip!
"SDC , Holding , Targets 25+ don’t miss opportunity now before Rocket on"
Some finally waking up to what the ALGN ER means for the aligner industry. It means GROWTH
I added some more

Turn off the shorts. Focus on a company that has turne the corner.HOLD!
"Wow 300,000 shares traded and it drops $.10. Talk about manipulation!"
"Ford at their 52 week low, also had people in the message boards talking about bankruptcy. Its the the go to playbook. 4.90's was there stock price during the pandemic start. Today they are approaching 7 year highs. Buying the fear works pretty good. The playbook comeback is usually ""this isnt ford"". Talk about ford and compare it to facebook. ""this isnt facebook"". Whatever you compare a stock to comes back with the same response. Drown the noise and thats how you make good investments."
"@lynn, the same way it's going down with low volume it can also go up with low volume.Hold!"
I'm loving this set-up. 48% SI and share price at $5.29. Interesting!I wonder if most of the shorts on this board are really short or are they just lonely and angry people?
solid foundation being built on this over the past several weeks...soon goldman will turn on the rally switch...
"Remember, I told you guys that the business improved, sales improved plus new products and still you paper hands sold. I too, bought a lot of shares over the past few days. ALGN proved that tonight.I'll keep buying!"
Where are the rest of my longs? I can't do it alone. Let's pull together and do this.Buy Buy Buy
Big block purchases

"Focus longs, business have improved at SDC. Buy Buy Buy!"
Monday SDC gonna fly minimum 10% take my message.. Targets big 25+ Am holding
There's nothing wrong with SDC. The business has improved. The only thing wrong here is that the SHORTS are taking advantage of this selloff to get away. Align is down big too.Check out the SI Y'all. Why is that coming down with the share price?
https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/qfziwe/sdc_undervalued/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
I have a feeling help is on the way!And I don't mean reddit. Hold!
@John....you must have owned a lot of TSLA. :)
why would anyone sell here? I don't think anyone is....
Hold your shares!Hold'em!
"@Mike Bears have probably been up all night bashing. SDC was extremely highly shorted on Friday - close to 60% of volume was shorting - reason for the price drop. Shorts really aren't that smart. They lost $40 billion shorting Tesla in 2020 and had been predicting bankruptcy for years. It took Tesla 17 years to finally be profitable recently. In comparison, SDC is a much newer startup and only lost 14 cents a share last quarter. Startups are concerned with establishing growth and market share the first few years and don't try or expect to be immediately generating profits. They are prepared for initial losses, often for many years, a point that seems to be lost on shortsellers."
SI is up! Borrowed cost is up! Shares available to short is down!Hold your shares!
Today's battle has begun!Buy Buy Buy!
Buy and hold
SI up 34M. Utilization now at 99%. CTB will increase from here. Nice setup heading into earnings.
SDC is going to pop...
Just more manipulation to make options a cash register
You know its gonna be a good day when retail shorts show up before 9am.
Just bought 100 more whos joining me
"But but but they said today was the day! Oh well, just another red day"
"Loading zone, Station $5.16"
Bought 280 @ $5.11!
"Why so many SHORTS on the board this early AM? Ah, here it is, we're red. LolDo they not understand what's about to happen to them? Sad!Stay long Y'all."
"@KC, I completely forgot about the buyout. But a buyout would not net much for many of us. Especially those who got in at $10 to $15. An Epic short squeeze would be juicier.Say something were to leak about a settlement with NBC or a partnership with a much bigger player, what do you think would happen to this stock with an SI of 38%. By the way, the SI was much higher. Stay long my friend. I've been here for awhile. I thought this thing was about to squeeze 3 weeks ago."
"It's hard for Shorts to move the needle down here. The price is at the bone now. Can't wait for upcoming Q3 ER and forward guidance. A game changer for Shorts, IMO"
Last chance to load up.
"@John...now that I have the Ortex data, I'm watching it closely. Its helpful since the reported data lags 2 weeks behind, reporting only twice per month, mid and end."
Shorts are taking advantage of the weak hands and day traders. Business have improved!HOLD!HOLD!
So glad I muted Clarissa.
The volume will come but not without news. Be patient my friends. Just buy and hold your shares and MUTE the shorts and fake LONGS.Long SDC!
"@Bond - What are you, the CFO of SDC? You have no clue and you know it.If SDC was heading into bankruptcy, I doubt they would have pages and pages of job openings around the world. They're building a brand and a multinational company. That costs money. Check out how long it took Align to become profitable. They didn't come out of the gate at $600/share."
Encouraging movement on low volume today!
3 days for the Shorts to cover now. Q3 ER only a week from this coming Monday.
Bought more again today.Can't stop now. I must keep moving forward.Hold and buy more!
"According to Ortex this morning's Live report, just over 50% of the FF is on loan with 33.9% SI. No shares have been returned, another 340K shares borrowed."
I think SDC is about to put a HOLD on my buys. lolThey'll have to add me to their board.LolBuy and Hold!
Hold your shares! Buy more!
"double bottom, triple bottom, quadruple bottom...That is nice. Still seeing below $5 next week."
As soon as this thing turns GREEN most of these names will disappear. LolBuy and Hold!
Just bought 4000 more shares!
"If I have to go down with the ship, down I will go. Buy Buy Buy!"
"We were hit by day traders at the end. Not to worry, we will prosper. More longs will be helping very soon. I mean longs that are here for the Epic squeeze and not for a quick 10 to 15 cents pop.Buy and hold."
"Keep buying, with me. We can win!Buy and Hold!"
"Yup, still buying. They moved up earnings, why? The only time a companies ever does that is when the earnings are good and have an announcement to make. Buy and hold!"
"@Mike, is it just you and I that are buying the dip?Buy and Hold!"
"How are the Shorts feeling down here? That's a deep hole, it's real dark. Looks like a longer ladder is needed to climb out now, maybe even a hydraulic lift. It's real comfy on the other side here. Time is on our side. It's only a matter of when, not if. Deep digging Shorts. D says it's safe here. Q3/2021 full year and forward guidance coming. Buckle-up."
"2B market cap, imagine if they get even half the lawsuit, instant double from here."
Looks like my fellow Longs are buying the dip. Let's go! Let's win!Buy and Hold!
"So ALGN beat it's Revenue Consensus last Q3. Growth can be also expected with SDSC for Q3, IMO"
"Sell Shorts, Sell. Let's go !"
"My fellow longs, our time is here and now. We must keep fighting and keep buying. We did it in AMC and we can do it here...If you can buy- buy. If you can't, then hold. Victory will be ours soon."
Just checked. Net borrowed shares now down -126.4K shares. Some smart(?) Shorts at turning in .
My average is 6.1 is it too high?
Zero after hours reaction from Align Investor Day. Their whole presentation sounds defensive and when you look at their product portfolio and realize that they need the aligner market to sell all of their OTHER products into the doctor channel. SDC isn't trying to sell scanners and other related info.
"Of course, here comes the negative articles just days before earnings. Rumor has it the business have improved in the past months. Ads are popping up in the US and Europe. There's even a mobile SDC bus coming. And now these outlets are trying to push the stock further down so they can cover.Buy and Hold!"
Who got the dip
