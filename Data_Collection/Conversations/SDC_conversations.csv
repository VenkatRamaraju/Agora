Dang we taking off now. I really regret not buying more the other day. :(
Congratulations fellow longs! We'll be back in double digits in a few weeks.
Everyone knows this is a double digit stock.
It did better after hrs than day .... Something good is happening !
Seems to be a lot of activity on Twitter regarding sdc this evening….
Just bought another 5000 soldiersTo increase to 43000 strong! Good luck longs !
I'm not sure there is big news. could be the company has moved the delayed orders from the hacking incident into current quarter and the acceleration of their global business as pandemic declines. the stock also sold off too much.
"A decent 5-figure position, now in the green. Today was a good day."
"According to SEC filings, 683 Capital Management bought 6.3 millions SDC shares (5.3% stake) on Aug 23z You don’t slap down that much cash if you think the price is going to plummet."
36% short interest! If bullish sentiment continues this stock will be over $20 in no time...
Anonymous.... did the volume go? How about 23 million shares in 2.5 hrs? More than 3x the 90-Day Average. And today's not over !
Short interest rose almost 4% today. last ditch efforts
Samantha…gimme a
30% SHORTED ...
"SDC rallying, is WSB in SDC?"
In a $5. Could be a 5 bagger. I see it being sold for $25
3 million shares traded in 15 minutes!!
"Break of $6.25 sends us to $7, and then after that gap fill to $9"
"Amazing company and staff, my daughter has her aligners and it's been 100% satisfaction. 24 hour support including live video support and local orthodontist 100% satisfaction and etc....."
"Orthodontist shares his view. Good podcast on Dentists Industry, Marketing....etchttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJqkadwOMTw"
Why would anyone sell right now??
Be patient and add on every dip. This is the game of the stock market.
Sweet....just touched $6
"This isn't even close to being over.....Not with ALGN some 130Xs the SDC share price. Not 10Xs, not 50Xs, not 100Xs...Yes, 130Xs !! And what's the ALGN multiple on the Revenue? Exactly."
"Wow ! look at the blocks after hrs ... continuous 40,000 share orders ..."
"holy volume batman!!Funny thing is, the shorts still have not been covered. Looking at Ortex data only 1% has covered their short position. Still 33% short interest!"
"24 million shares traded already. That's 400% above the daily norm already. Im assuming some shorts are involved, but somone is buying also. I wonder if a Fund has decided to jump in. It is starting to drop now though, a bit"
Trending up third Green Day in a row… love the huge volume. I’m sure people don’t scan for that… keep it trending up.
"Lol I’m not selling today, anyway looking for $7 then $9 this week"
"If this price movement is because of the article about Medicare might cover dental....how does that effect SDC? No way medicare going to pay for straighten senior citizens teeth?I think it is wonderful because of the cleaning, fillings etc and should have been apart of medicare a long time ago but it doesnt have anything to do with SDC and their line of work."
And why would they sell now. This company is worth at least 5 billion which is more like $15 a share.
Payday’s coming!
Volume is at 23 million and we’re up 20%. Volume goes to 28 million and we’re up 5%. Short ladder plain and simple. What manipulation keep holding

"Perhaps investors are think if Medicare is going to expand benefits, Medicaid will as well. But....the Government will not pay Invisalign prices. No way. I have excellent dental insurance and they don't. Medicaid coverage is where SDC would benefit. And.....Clarissa TS/Wendy/Mary Ann/Axelrod - Before you make some unwarranted disgusting statement about Medicaid recipients, save your key strokes. It's not appropriate, nor welcome."
Drop in price are shorts utilizing the shares they just borrowed. 1 million shares have to been taken to loan. HODL! 35% short interest!
After hrs looking good !
