It's called a squeeze.
I predict green today. trading pattern favors longs.
"Amazing company and staff, my daughter has her aligners and it's been 100% satisfaction. 24 hour support including live video support and local orthodontist 100% satisfaction and etc....."
"I mean... it is just for now, but I am almost crying SDC is green!"
30% SHORTED ...
Up up and away 
Holding this bag  for at least another 1-100 yrs haha
ok...up up&awayy
Be patient and add on every dip. This is the game of the stock market.
@Incognito....yep. I'm joining the Buying frenzy. Not Selling. All Longs should Buy more and make the Shorts pay up.
another paid shill below me
"Just sit back and relax everyone, last time it came to these low levels it blasted off to $10 within days. Extremely undervalued at these prices. $800M revenue, with a market cap of 1.8B. That’s like 2.5X!"
@D....it's quite simple when these MMs trade among themselves. Get real. Everyone knows the jig.
"@Bond - You still haven't answered by question from below. But I do see you had someone rewrite the sentence for you. For God's sake @Bond. Do you honestly believe if this company going bankrupt that the top 10 Institutional holders would still be holding 51.6 million shares of SDC? Retail investors are the last to know anything. If bankruptcy was imminent, the institutions would know and they would have sold a long time ago.Everyone should do their due diligence and perform their own analysis. ""SDC soon be file bk"" is not financial advice. It's a paid basher or disgruntled employee. Obviously!"
"@Clariss TS - You indirectly brought up a good point, that most probably don't think about. If SDC stockholders put a sell order in for say, $20/share, that would take those shares off the table for potential shorting activities. All long shareholders need to do that."
Sweet....just touched $6
Trending up third Green Day in a row… love the huge volume. I’m sure people don’t scan for that… keep it trending up.
"mileDirectClub is currently providing a doctor-directed digital end-to-end experience in teledentistry, with 24/7 access to orthodontic care and the back end of lifetime smile guarantee. The company continues to see favorable industry dynamics with broader acceptance of telehealth and specifically, teledentistry."
Let the impatient sell. Real investors have been here before and know which direction this is headed. Today just confirmed it. This is the beginning of the end for shorts. 
The S and P and Nasdaq need to do their 10 plus percent correction and get it out of the way for 2021. Then the indices resume the uptrend with very low interest rates.
Break of 6.25 will go to $7 and then we could gap fill to $9 if we pass through the4e
"Wow, I am having fun this morning!! On a serious note, to everyone on here keep your nerve, we went long for a reason do not loose your heads. Set a limit sell order on the amount of profit that will suit your own needs. Moon shots are great, but good money in your pocket is also good. Be careful not to leverage with your margin accounts too much and most of all HAVE FUN!"
7$ tomorrow please
Your wrong
"SDC rallying, is WSB in SDC?"
"If this price movement is because of the article about Medicare might cover dental....how does that effect SDC? No way medicare going to pay for straighten senior citizens teeth?I think it is wonderful because of the cleaning, fillings etc and should have been apart of medicare a long time ago but it doesnt have anything to do with SDC and their line of work."
"Sdc should hire a proven executive with expertise in growth companies, marketing, process improvement, international markets, and interaction with the investment community."
Last day to purchase under $5.50 imo once this .40 gap fills there’s nothing left in our way till we hit $7
A battle is now far from over. Shorts know they are now on thin ice going forward. This morning was just a taste.
Between yesterday and today: the pump was completely faded
"@incognito - Wendy/Clarissa TS will point you to their so called ""Top YouTube Stock Influencer,"" My Animo (obviously a short as well). But....he's multi-talented. You can also see a Ninja Foodi review from this ""expert."""
Longs you loose!
"One wins when they have time on their side, buys the dips on their long term investments, and doesnt let fear get to them. It becomes really hard to lose in this game."
Testing. Does my account work?!
The run is over...may close up 10 centa
20 thousand Open Interest $6 Calls for 9/17? Isn’t that the highest OI in the entire market?
"Everyone, I just updated ortex. They've increased their short position by three percent...."
explosive breakout to the upside coming in the next hour
@jyttredahl..I can't hear you because you muted.
I like warren buffets saying. The stock market is a tool to transfer money from the impatient investors to the patient investors. Thanks to all for the shares.
A lot of stocks have been through similar times early on in their business plan. SDC will dig in and climb their way out! $12 by 2022.
2 green days in a row. fantastic.
I forgot most of you were in diapers when amazon went public.

"@JD, This is a new company with IPO in 2019 and every new company has a debt to begin with. If not, the stock price will not be so low. ALIGN Current ration on 31/12/2011 was 4.75 with liabilities of $900 million. SDC is much better off. Remember, SDC was just 1 Quarter away from EBITDA profitability last Quarter.Bankruptcy is far off after exhausting many options (a different discussion) and you as a short is forecasting based on just last Qtr Rev miss (Cyber attack or other reasons). There are two scenarios that will determine how they decide to burn their cash. If they are able to get Revenue Growth (20%+) in the next couple of quarters at the cost of marketing spends, Wal-street is ok based on all growth companies we see. If they fail to get Rev growth - Hypothetically lets say they cannot do more than 174 million (last missed revenue), the yearly rev will still be close to $700 million. In this scenario, they can turn off/substantially reduce the Marketing Spend/ G&A expenses and show profitability. In either of these scenarios, they shouldn't have any issues refinancing their debt (a good % of it is used for SmilePay so its a debt that SDC gets a good return). They have until 2026 to do this. In the worst case scenario, we are not even accounting for any increase in non aligners product revenue from Walgreen/Walmart/CVS. Even in the worst case scenario of ~ 700 million recurring revenue each year with future marketing spends/G&A optimized, they are still a well oil machine with with 75-85% GPM. I don't see any issue in refinancing either through debt refinancing or issuing additional stocks. Your statement on bankruptcy is highly exaggerated specially from the context that the debt was refinanced just few months back (Feb 2012) with zero interest coupon and still has a few years (2026) due. Give then some time! It took ALGN 25 years to reach this level. We are comparing $ 5 Vs $700 stock price and you still want to short it #$%$ Good Luck, but don't spread mis-information."
"After my comment below, stock turned around, now up .20 from low.."
There goes that volume again. Time to bail out shorts. Let it go.........
"@Wendy, a lot of Orthodontists are already #$%$ed off after Invisalign forced them to buy their expensive custom scanners. If Invisalign copies SDC model of Smile shops and lets say they charge $1350 to Customers, why will you go to an Invisalign Orthodontists and pay $5-6k for the same outcome? There are lots of overheads on vertical integration, manufacturing, customer service..etc needed in addition to a dentists/orthodontists working remotely to check the progress, otherwise Invisalign will be sued.I am waiting for ALGN to start their Direct to consumer selling and if I was SDC management they should be waiting as well. Overall, this will be good for SDC and settle any doubts on competitive misinformation/false campaigns by ALGN on Tele dentistry/SmileShops. More than SDC, it will put price pressure on ALGN and #$%$ of their Orthodontists/Dentists who are now charging at least $5000-$7000 per aligner. With Direct to Consumer model, even if ALGN pitches to get a few hundred $ premium over SDC price of $1950 per aligner, Customers will question the morality/ethics of Orthodontists/Dentists, if they charge more than ALGN's direct to consumer aligner price, unless its a complex case which anyway are dealt by Orthodontists. Even for the complex cases due to ALGN's move, the Orthodontists will be under pressure to reduce their price. If ALGN puts facebook/Marketing Ads for Direct to Consumer model aligners, it will hurt Orthodontists/Dentists business - Catch 22 situation. Even a confirmed published news of ALGN trying to open up SmileShops will bode well for SDC."
"Will probably close negative today. Hopefully anyone close to the breakeven line sold today. If not, get ready for the $2-3 range real soon."
"Those are some good headlines......smile Direct Collapsing under increased operating cost, greater competition and an over leveraged balance sheet."
"This whole “cash flow positive” and “fundamentals must be good” charade is getting very old even for a proficient short such as myself. In fact I covered every position because novice shorts think it is getting way too easy to make money and every small cap growth stocks will go to zero. We are seeing the opposite of the hat we saw in February. Bulls capitulating for losses, lots of panic while shorts are exuberant and believe high growth stocks will go to penny land.Going to scale long positions in next week into beat up growth names. $sdc$nndm$jmia$surf$root"
Look at Volume and we are only half way through the day. Looking back to December I only see 3 other days on daily... not done yet!
SDC will never hold $5 this IS A GREAT time to add more to your short
This company is 4-5 billion Mc all day
"Last resistance at $5.50. Bottom of Bull Flag formation. Perfect time for a whale to enter here, wouldn’t be surprised if one did. This run is just getting started. $10+ EOW atleast."

how many advertising links do I have to mute now that the stock is showing some momentum?
"@Wendy - A few thoughts about your posts:1) If the SDC YouTube pod cast video would have been derogatory/defamatory against SDC, or Kyle would have done a bad job, you would have been pointing everyone to it. Did you complain about the Invisalign pod cast?2) Regarding Invisalign's cost discussion. You are way off base. Invisalign's (very successful) business model has always been selling their product through dentists. They get revenue from more than just the aligners (i.e. associated hardware). The dentists/orthodontists then apply a huge mark-up. That's how they pay themselves and the fixed costs of their business. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. It's a great business model and I hope Align and associated dentists/orthodontists continue to be very successful. IMO, that's not going to change. Dentists/orthodontists don't go to dental school, graduate with huge debt, and open practices with substantial fixed costs to make a few hundred dollars a case on Invisalign customers. They have to mark it up. Also, most will not undercut their peers pricing, because that would be disastrous. They have to all be on the same page to maximize profits. I also don't think Invisalign is salivating at the thought of going DTC. It doesn't make sense. They could have done it by now. That would be a slap in the face to their dentists/orthodontists. Align is already being sued by consumers for anti-competitive practices. It doesn't take a Rhodes Scholar to figure out the dentists/orthodontists would be less than happy and without a doubt would sue them as well.There are a lot of people in this country that don't have insurance and don't have the resources to pay 6-8K for aligners or simply don't feel it's worth it. SDC is a great fit for them. SDC is also moving into dental/orthodontists offices as well. Major insurance carriers are covering SDC costs because they are effective and less expensive. There's always going to be competition in any business. There's plenty of room for all of the aligner companies to be successful and I hope they are for their employees/stockholders. it's too bad you don't feel the same. It's actually very selfish."
"The guy who said to SELL SDC prior to earnings at $6.70, just put up a new video. Is SDC now a buy?https://youtu.be/-R77FdEkLlY"
Yep....rotation. Little by little.
Big float to squeeze. But decent SI. I’m in. Will add much more to my position after SPRT has wasted the shorts and I pull some gains
Short Squeeze

wife threw a glass vase at me for buying 4000 shares at $9
Bought 2 more shares
Everyone knows this is a double digit stock.
In a $5. Could be a 5 bagger. I see it being sold for $25
"It’s gonna go suddenly record speed.. $7,8,10 ,$15.With 40% the squeeze will be epic."
Mike....all I'm saying is the volume was OFF THE CHARTS! but then it just sort of slowed to a trickle.....so many low down games played by wall street.
@Incognito - Thanks for providing the link below. Do you know when the content became available? I've never seen it before. SDC needs to make sure of widespread availability.
Dang we taking off now. I really regret not buying more the other day. :(
Drop in price are shorts utilizing the shares they just borrowed. 1 million shares have to been taken to loan. HODL! 35% short interest!
"24 million shares traded already. That's 400% above the daily norm already. Im assuming some shorts are involved, but somone is buying also. I wonder if a Fund has decided to jump in. It is starting to drop now though, a bit"
@Anonymous....I guess you were looking for 45 million shares sold by noon. This isn't over. Many smart Shorts covered. Others are exposed.
Stock price drop->Cause panic to chase off ignorant retailers->Institutional or Insiders begin loading-> Random Major Volume spikes (we are here)-> PR or news drop-> shorts begin covering->Share price goes 10-100X
"This has become so predictable. Same coin, just opposite sides. Rinse & Repeat. Time to shut her down now. Loaded and ready for tomorrow, with both shares and cash. GLTA"

"maybe.. this co was an outgrowth of one of the Founders fave moviez?.. deliverance?... ""boy u got a purtyy mouth""... not really, but we can fix that!... lol"
Some good news from management would be nice. The “we don’t look at the stock price” comment was comical. Down 60% YTD… Woof.
Wow it’s really starting to move what’s up with This ?
notice today's chart pattern is a SMILE. how ironic.
I will share it on reddit Stock_SDC. I cant believe that they would short it an additional million shares today
4 Green Day’s in a row with a nice 9 million volume. Tik tok shorts.
Watch for a big spike last half hour today
Someone paid Zacks to put out a negative article on SDC.
$5.51 AH nervous shorty? I can tell you are from how much ur spamming our chat
What’s the news you guys think?
"Squeeze me shorts will see $15 soon soon $15 $15 $15 SDC is a viable business just like AMC, GME they can make money the shorts need their teeth fixed too after they loose their shirts"
Taking off.....
Something is happening on Monday. Watch!
1500 new watchers on Stocktwits since Friday. Trending on Reddit and Twitter. Your time is over shortie. Next $SNAP like run is here at the small d club
"Shorts and bashers are trying their best to hold this down using FUD, etc. Sign of their intelligence is that they were telling you last week to short at $5, that it would plummet under $4 the next day, and they actually think their repetitive posting on Yahoo will help force the price down (or their employer does, who probably has money to burn, but may soon get burnt if he doesn't cover). Their jabbering is always the loudest near a bottom. Doesn't really matter if this closes at low of day - as long as that low is higher than the close the day before, it's strength not weakness. Every future potentially lucrative trade carries risk, but if you wait until fundamentals clearly turn positive, the price will be many times higher. Not telling anyone whether or when to buy, but those are the facts. However, with over 30% short there is always potential of a squeeze with the right trigger, that can take a stock many dollars higher in a very short period of time with little warning. That's why the shorts are so afraid now and trying so hard to discourage. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night if I were currently short in this. They could literally lose all their profits overnight at any given time (that is, if they actually have any and didn't short at $5 - and don't believe the liars who will claim they are still holding a short from $15 - trust me, there aren't any, even if they posted a trade months ago, always after the fact after a drop. Virtually all the bashers' trades are fictitious, posted after a drop to try to make themselves look smart)."
SDC just won Alabama lawsuit. Breaking News
Someone please please confirm rumours on dark web they are being sold for 4 billion. Any announcement???

—You ask “Why would anyone invest in this?” I can’t speak to that...but the reason I’m now *trading this is: The price was too low. Easy worth $9+ soon.
"@Wendy, your comments makes everyone suspicious about you and Samantha. You are writing the reverse what Samantha posted here - to buy AMC at 60+. So many folks lost money if they listened to her. I hope you don’t want folks to think about you the same way as everyone thinks negatively about her on this board."
"Dear shorts, look at the options chains. Someone or some group is up to something and retail shorts will be the last to know. Take the money and run."
Shorts are working overtime today.
3 consecutive green days.
"Just some friendly food for thought: ALGN owned 30% of SDC which means they were basically a combined identity at one point. Wouldn’t you imagine SDC learned or even experienced ALGN’s secret sauce on a first hand basis daily? Wouldn’t you also assume SDC did everything in its power to ensure their product was on par with ALGN if not identical and indistinguishable on a subatomic level since they were literally physically sold side by side to eachother? That’s kinda like Gordan Ramsay opening up a restaurant with you, cooking with you and running the place with you for 10 years and you both accumulate 5 Michelin stars together, then once your both so rich and successful you decide to buy the other half from Ramsay and become the sole owner of a 5 star Michelin restaurant. Nothing changes and you and everyone else around you already learned, experienced, and did what it takes to run a 5 star Michelin restaurant because you learned and did it with the best on a hands on level for years. Gordan has 20 5 star Michelin restaurants he doesn’t care to sell his 2.5 to you. If anything he is happy to sell it to you and compete with you because he knows competition is what made him a master chef in the first place. #SmallDuckClub "
@A Yahoo! User....$3.70 and lower? Bring it on. I'll be your Buyer.
This is going to be a big announcement. Wouldn’t want to be short right now.
Keep buying and keep holding!

Everyone should do their due diligence and perform their own analysis. ""SDC soon be file bk"" is not financial advice. It's a paid basher or disgruntled employee. Obviously!"
Longs it is over. SDC's patents are all now in jeopardy now that precedent has been set with the ruling that Candid did not violate any patents because the judge said the patent was not valid since it is not SDC's original idea. I mean what were they thinking? They would just take Invisalign's technology and file for patents that Invisalign didn't file for?
"SDC has billed itself as a “disruptive technology,” and few could argue with that. Clayton Christensen, who coined the phrase, wrote in his book, The Innovator’s Dilemma, “The strategies and plans that managers formulate for confronting disruptive technological change . . . should be plans for learning and discovery rather than plans for execution.” What will SDC and Smile Brands learn in the coming months?"
"Lol I’m not selling today, anyway looking for $7 then $9 this week"
Nice entry point I see here. I started my position today for long term. Will add more if it goes down. The recent earning drops are very normal for growing comp. This is going to be alright.
I love the slow steady build up before a squeeze…..
my gosh whats happening :O

I have invested for over 30 years and you guys are the most dedicated investors to a company that I have encountered (since message boards). I truly hope they can turn things around over the next few quarters. Good luck and God bless.
I don’t think the Reddit apes can bring this back to $15 but $9 is possible by Friday.

Triple bottom off $4.98 check the chart shorty this was the last day to buy under $4 now we continue rising until $20+ based off the share structuring alone this should be $25+ but bears are working all the SDC chat rooms like a 9-5 scaring away any novice investors. I can’t wait until our first whale joins the party next week and we wake up to +50% 
"Smile direct club $sdc : Honest DD by a dentist! I am a dentist and this is the honest truth about smile direct club;A few years ago, 99% of dentist were against smile direct, primarily because we did not know anything about the structure of how they work. All we knew was that someone was moving patients teeth without our authorization or pre-approval.As time has passed, many dentists including myself has opened our eyes and gained a lot of knowledge about what exactly smile direct does. They move teeth that are in the mild/moderate cases. Which means that severe cases would still need traditional braces. That is totally fine by me. If a patient comes to my office with a slightly curved front tooth, then why would I not want to save her $5-6000 (the cost of Invisalign) when she can get that corrected easily with smile direct ($1900).It’s ethically wrong of me not to offer this to my patients, and greed does not belong in healthcare!Now let’s proceed to the continuous negative sentiment from my fellow dental-colleagues. Orthodontics is a VERY exclusive private sector which has for 100 years kept their work for themselves and even during dental school they did not want to teach general dentists much about it. So you can imagine the threat they felt when they suddenly see that a company is eating off their plate. (Loss of $income!). They have gone full force against smiledirect in all ways possible, including legally! Smile direct club has so far won every single legal case brought against them, with the most recent one being against the dental boards of Georgia.It’s important to understand that many dentist will claim that it’s “unsupervised”, which I can tell you first hand it is not. When patients come to my clinic, I do a full exam, including cavity and periodontally clearing my patients before possibly referring them to SDC. Now, If patients decide to go directly to a smile shop (and not through a dentist), then they would fill out paperwork where they are clearly asked if they have seen a dentist and been cleared. If patient is self neglective and chooses to lie then clearly the only one doing harm to themselves here is the patient, and not SDC. Let’s continue my thoughts about the stock; the stock with an IPO of $22 in 2019 has been slammed by short sellers (many suspecting Invisalign competitor being a big part of it). Currently there is a 28% short interest in sdc! That is huge when it comes to a potential short squeeze. Smile direct have focused on growth and expansion, so all of their income has gone back in to their business. So they have not even attempted to show profitability, since growth has been priority.In January of 2020, invisalign lost their patent to work directly with dentists in dental offices, so SDC are now growing their partnerships with dental offices directly at a high pace! In their most recent earnings they said they are signed up with 1,800 DSO dental offices. Which is huge!See link of Invisalign patent expiration below; https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/01/14/1970226/0/en/Smile-Direct-Club-Clear-Aligners-Now-Available-at-Dentist-and-Orthodontist-Offices.htmlFurthermore, smile direct has signed an exclusive partnership with Walmart to sell their products in their stores. Now also in CVS stores.See links below:https://www.cnn.com › investingWeb resultsSmileDirectClub signs exclusive deal to sell dental care at Walmart - CNNhttps://cvshealth.com/news-and-insights/press-releases/cvs-health-and-smile-direct-club-team-up-to-expand-access-andSmile direct has recently also focused on international expansion which includes US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Mexico, Austria, Spain, Netherlands, Hong Kong and Singapore. This is my DD on smile direct and short sellers will jump on here and bash it, I have no doubt. But I wanted to share my thoughts with you guys as a dentist and you can make your own decision from here.Best of luck to you all."
"Dont sell, it's long term hold"
"Us longs are always here watching. The shorts have been twisting the knife on the way down, but hey I can hold for the next 5 to 10 years without sweating. The shorts however have to sleep with an eye open."
—Yep. Smile. We’re goin’ to the promised land now- straight teeth and all! ￼
$8 by next week! Let's go. Undervalued this stock can easily be $14 by the end of the year.
"There a really only 2 viable calls for the stock to go up. After orriginally claiming that the hack cost 15 million and then reporting it was 6 million and showing a bigger revenue drop than expected the drop in the stock to the 5 dollar area made sence. the 2 arguments for a bounce are either there were some operational issues that have been addressed or that since this product is cheaper than the invisalign product that it's potential customer base was effected more by the pandemic than the invisalign base and the continued opening will help.Price looks interesting, but traders still throwing volume at the stock to see if they can break support levels. Anything 5 and below seems interest but there appears to be no rush to catch aknife unless they release some guidance early."
if cathie wood bought SDC that would give significant bullish confidence.
Breakout Above $5 bucks
"@Independent - The funniest part is Wendy/Clarissa TS think I'm a male dentist named Kevin Henry. Last I looked, I'm not a dude. I'm also not a dentist. I don't have to work. Quite frankly, wouldn't a bullish dentist be a good thing for SDC?"
"holy volume batman!!Funny thing is, the shorts still have not been covered. Looking at Ortex data only 1% has covered their short position. Still 33% short interest!"
Whats all this about Cathie wood how do we know
Why would anyone sell right now??
Everytime I see a short spreading FUD I buy more 
"@Wendy - You're on the wrong message board. None of us longs care about ALGN. We all know they're successful and I hope you've made a lot of money off of them. Actually, if you had, you wouldn't be on this board squabbling over pennies at this point."
36% short interest! If bullish sentiment continues this stock will be over $20 in no time...

"@Wendy - Good for you. Congratulations. Now, go away and enjoy your profits. The intense effort you expend bashing SDC is proof positive you have no skin in the game on either one. If you were a successful AMC investor, you wouldn't be spending your day posting junior high school level ""stuff"" on this board."
"@Chris....the Shorting selling cycle is exactly how the Shorts drove SDC down from $12 a few months ago to $5 today. Yes, there was some major recent institutional selling on their Q2 ER. Everyone knows that $5 is a now ridiculously low price. It's only a matter of time, and I don't think it will be long. I have my staircase Sell Orders in place for when it happens. Not all, about 60% of my position. I've been here before with this company."
Of course this would go up 18% and then drop all the way back down
"@A Yahoo! User...it's called rotation. I'm on the other side of the same coin. This is how I've brought my Average down from low double-digits. Shorting here is risky. You Shorts know the juice has been rung out. Not much left for you here. There's plenty left for me, now at ATLs. No one in their right mind is selling, except for you Shorts. All the major selling was done weeks ago. Everyone knows it, or should."

Post a link that David Katzman sold .
"I genuinely believe we've reached the bottom of this downslide. If I could post my SDC chart I would but for some reason, my post with the link keeps getting removed. Anyway, the technicals show that:* Price is currently bouncing off a very strong support line AND a long-standing trend line.* The stock has respected these levels for over a year.* The stock is massively oversold, with RSI at 21/22 right now. The last time it hit this level was March 202 during the COVID stock market downturn. After that, it rebounded from 3.6 to 10 in less than a month.* I'm not saying that's what will happen here but with RSI, S/R, and trend lines all converging, there's a strong probability of an imminent reversal. Added to which, the fundamentals are generally good, despite recent earnings.* There's also a small probability of the price dropping back to 3.6/3.8 (there's strong support at that level from March 2020), but in my view, it's unlikely unless there's another major stock market correction. And even if that happens, I have no doubt the stock will rebound again, just as it has after every negative earnings report in the past.* Additionally, the stock market right now is unstable, with big swings up and down and this is adding to SDC's recent decline.My advice: just hodl and ignore the FUD."
"Just over half of the regular trading day and the Volume is nothing notable.....just over 55% of the 90-Day Average and 31% of the 10-Day Average. And we are right at ATLs. Markets up, SDC down 4.13%. MM manipulation at its purest. Yep, bought here. Average in the $5s. Little by little...."
"People aren’t reading between the lines . They keep winning at court, direct sale to customers & could sell to orthodontics at same wholesale price and allow private offices to make profit (same as align). Also $3B lawsuit with NBC that will likely settle for 75% of $3B. This product is great and an outstanding long term play. The fact they are struggling only makes the case vs NBC stronger…just saying- there is value here"
SDC will be back to IPO prices in 3-5 years. Mark my word.
Where’s Wendy???????

"I am all in on this stock. it is important to understand where this company is now.

No longer relying heavily on facebooks ads for leads.

"Added more today, not one share sold."
@Incognito - So true. And as you know.....the retail investors are the last to know.
Please tell me where to see a squeeze I see nothing
Shorts have been awfully quiet the past few days...
$.12 is meaningful to me. Reloaded a portion for anymore dips. Plenty of ammo still on the side. Little by little.
Honestly a good company. Did good things during pandemic. Lowered cost for folks to feel better… this does sound like a comeback story and Reddit should support IMO
"I haven't seen any news about Cathy Woods taking stake in SDC. Even if she is not, there will be other Hedge Funds stepping up soon. If there are couple of Hedge funds or ALGN trying to pull SDC down there are hundreds of hedge funds out there who will see value or an opportunity to make money, specially with the stock price beaten down so heavily."
Are we 10 yet? 
"If SDC wants to stay engaged in the teeth straightening business, it has to reduce the price to around $1000 per patient to build up the volumes.Or it will face elimination from Algn."
"Regarding Mary Ann's stock YouTube Stock Influencer. SDC should sue him for defamation. ""In order to be actionable, a defamatory statement must be ""of and concerning"" the plaintiff. This means that a defamation plaintiff must show that a reasonable person would understand that the statement was referring to him or her. Of course, if a blog post or online article identifies the plaintiff by name, this requirement will be easily met. The plaintiff need not be specifically named, however, if there are enough identifying facts that any (but not necessarily every) person reading or hearing it would reasonably understand it to refer to the plaintiff.""https://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/who-can-sue-defamation"
"Wendy, you did not answer the question...is AXE Capital real?"
"@Clarissa TS/Wendy - Looks like you're the same person. That makes sense. You have the same logic and modus operandi of highlighting points that make people say what???? You know, as well as anybody over the age of 12, that SDC doesn't ""cater solely"" to welfare recipients. A company like SDC makes it possible for a person that may rely on aid to have the opportunity to improve their teeth and self esteem. Regarding the ""massive debt,"" here are the true facts (which can be verified via their CC presentation(s). “Deal launched at a size of $350 million and was later upsized to $650 million due to strong institutional demand. In addition, the bookrunners exercised their full greenshoe option to purchase $97.5 million convertible notes, bringing the full offering size to $747.5 million. Notes were priced with a 0% coupon, and a 40% conversion premium. Notes mature February 2026. In conjunction, SDC entered into a capped call that will fully offset any potential equity dilution from conversion of the notes. This convertible debt financing strengthens our balance sheet, with minimal equity dilution, and fortifies us against a protracted COVID environment, while also enabling to us to comfortably execute our growth strategy over the coming years, while also investing in R&D, innovation, and other business development opportunities.”"
@Clarissa TS - Most on this board have zero desire to hear your constant bashing.
"If they close out the year at 800b, then at 25% rev growth, they will hit 1bill by end of 2022. If 25% growth continues, it will hit 2 billion rev by 2025. They should be profitable by then with earnings of 350mill after taxes and interest. Since they will still be growing and be the main player in international markets (Align limited itself to USA), even if we apply half of Aligns current P/S, the market cap should be 18 bill, or a SP of 48. If we apply Aligns current P/S ratio (which makes more sense if SDC will be profitable and be the trailblazer in international markets), then the marketcap will be 34 bill, or SP of 86."
Well PRAISE THE KATZENJAMMERZ... the stock has clawed back $0.20 of its $10.00 per share loss... polish the silver ware
"Seems like the entire pack of our bashers have taken a day off today or having a meeting with their employers...LOL. I am sure, we'll see them back soon."
"@ A Yahoo! User, how many companies you heard or invested whose priority is to create shareholder value in the initial years? With the IPO in 2019, the priority is to build the brand which SDC has done successfully!ALGN is 25 years old company (they were competing with Braces) and here are the stats as of Dec 31st, 2011, even 15 years after they started.ALIGN Current ration on 31/12/2011 was 4.75 with liabilities of 900 million. SDC is still miles ahead of ALGN in terms of financials."
Sdc + Kathy wood?? Shorts better cover now
We already exceeded both the 10-Day and 90-Day Average Volumes in less than 30 minutes of trading !!
$4.50 $4.60 was a gift! If you got in at those prices you purchased the bottom good for you!

35 million shares are short..
Lift off!!
bears hiding as usual
Overall market nervousness.. another buying opportunity
After hrs looking good !
So glad I muted Wendy. KC you should do the same.
Anyone remember the days when you bought this at double digits?
Yea Daniel is right!... You are all so sure of the bk....do it...put all your money into it!...you will be rich

I saw 3 SDC commercials today on 3 different channels.

Keep buying
3 million shares traded in 15 minutes!!
Here we go. Once it breaks out of 5 it’s check mate
where are the shortards?
a beautiful green day and strong close into the bell!
@Steven...just pure Shorting. No one else selling here. The market will 'wake up'. It always does.

This could be the next AMC
Big buyers coming in. Watch pre-market news on Monday
what is there like 50k shares left for shorties to borrow? this is going to be a hilarious squeeze
What’s going on? Did someone leak the buyout?
Looks like we added some more shorts due to the fact that they saw a big rise - what they missed was a big rise on many big volume trades - these new shorts will certainly add more fuel to the FULL STEAM AHEAD that’s cookin’
"Massively oversold. Price/sales at 2.5, ALGN is in the high teens - like 17x. And SDC growing faster and has invested more in future productivity than ALGN. Makes no sense."
If you think this company will triple within the next year few years then don't listen to these nonsense posts. I own DKNG and other stocks and they said the same things. 1.5 month ago DKNG dropped to 42 when short seller came out a bomb report. Look it now! trading at 60. These guys/girls working for some hedge funds just spreading bad news to scare you.
We just getting started 
Great volume here
Y it never gets traction

Seems to be a lot of activity on Twitter regarding sdc this evening….
"I need a vote of confidence in this stock. I was long SDC before earnings, and I’m still long SDC today. Are you bullish on this stock? If yes thumbs up , and comment your price target for next year. Mine is 10$ after Q1 2022"

Something is up. Look at the volume on the calls.

Volume is at 23 million and we’re up 20%. Volume goes to 28 million and we’re up 5%. Short ladder plain and simple. What manipulation keep holding
Short squeeze is coming.
Looks like getting ready to announce. Fingers crossed.
"Retail investors are always the last to know...both impending upward and downward movement. Somebody must know something because there were some very large buys. Hopefully, we'll see some news after the bell."
I'm not sure there is big news. could be the company has moved the delayed orders from the hacking incident into current quarter and the acceleration of their global business as pandemic declines. the stock also sold off too much.
It did better after hrs than day .... Something good is happening !
This parties just getting started.
"If the Redditt crowd wants a good squeeze, this is it."
It is so nice to mute the shorts and not hear their dribble.
Wendy what in gods green earth are you talking about... as of 3:55 pm it is 5.19 so your saying it is no where near $4 right now...
Amazon was a disruptor too.
WOW .. look at the volume .. could take off any moment now
they won a court case and of course crookville yahoo doesnt mention it. instead ambulance chaser law firms fill the feed
Not sure if I should be happy it's up or mad that I didn't average down this morning
Anonymous.... did the volume go? How about 23 million shares in 2.5 hrs? More than 3x the 90-Day Average. And today's not over !
My wife uses Smile Direct aligners. She's very happy with results and the whole process.
"Actual experience here - I brought my child into a Smile Direct shop that had appointments available within two days. Another shop was closer and would have been more convenient, but their calendar had several closed days and any openings were a week out (more on this below). Long story short, the customer experience was casually-professional and, in the end, I had absolutely no problem forking over a couple thousand via credit card on the spot.As far as details go, the initial tech we met with was about as far from high-pressure sales as they come. She pointed out that my child's molars were likely still growing in and initially recommended we come back in 6-12 months for a scan. She offered to have a second lady to come in to answer questions/advise and that second person concurred, but said it was up to us whether we wanted to go through with the scan that day. My child, whose teeth really aren't that bad, wanted to go forward with the scan so we did.The technology of that produces the image model of the teeth was impressive. We were able to watch it map individual teeth, gums, and such in real-time on a screen. This was important because it really gave me confidence the process/treatment could work. As I looked back-and-forth between the monitor and my child's mouth, I saw rendered images that truly matched the physical world in great detail. Seeing that first-hand made me realize how ""easy"" it would be for them to model a program to adjust the minor spacing issues and close a gap or two. So, when the next step came and it was time to ""sign on the dotted line"" and pay for treatment, I felt much more at ease things would/will turn out okay.There was a bit of a ""cheesy"" sales pitch involving saving money by paying up front versus financing via a ""Smile Pay"" program. It went something like, ""You will save $400, how does that sound? Which option would you like to choose?"" In other words, it was framed as your only two options are to pay up front or to sign up for the financing program - not that you can just walk out and think about it. Also, the pitch was delivered in a crafty way to make you mentally agree saving money sounded like a good thing. Instead of being offended at a pseudo-manipulation technique, I made a joke of it by directly calling it out and using it as a learning opportunity for my child to understand what just happened there. The SDC staff was a little flustered by this and blushed a bit, but conversation then segued smoothly to a close with a laugh between all of us. We did end up agreeing to pay up front, including an additional $100 for retainers after the treatment program ends.At this time, we still have an appointment for a consultation at a traditional orthodontist. SDC's staff said it would take up to 72 hours for a SmileDirectClub doctor to review/approve treatment; with those molars that are still growing in being the main risk of not being approved. If approved, I just can't imagine us paying 3x the price at this point. I would probably just wait 6 months and go back for another scan.One interesting thing is that the traditional orthodontist had a 3-week wait/lead time before we could get in there for an appointment. No big deal, but it played an important factor in them most-likely losing our business. I wanted to get this taken care of before school started so we didn't have to work around the school schedule. The fact that we were able to get into a Smile Shop first/sooner contributed to our taking a leap of faith here.In summary, assuming we have a decent experience with treatment, I see this model as the future, at least for minor adjustments. If there were significant alignment/spacing issues, yes, I would only trust a traditional orthodontist and braces to do the work. However, I suspect this approach will work just fine for a large percentage of mild-to-moderate cases. Although, I cannot speak to how well the home impression kit approach works relative to the 3D modeling using a high-tech hand-held camera.I guess the lingering question I have is whether SDC can form enough brand differentiation or enough of a ""moat"" around the business model to be profitable. Or, will technology continue to advance to the point it makes it too easy for competition to enter the market. I'm thinking it could become more like Lasik - lots of players, but most are nicely profitable.As far as SDC's stock goes, at these prices, I am comfortable maintaining/adding to my initial position established in the at/below $7. Although, I will probably sell some covered calls against the additional shares while patiently waiting for SDC's management to get this company firing on all cylinders. As much as shorts might dream about it, I do not believe this company is going out of business anytime soon. To me, that means any further dips here are to be bought, not sold."
Smile direct making us all smile back up to $12
"Don’t worry so much. Just look at the chart. Price is currently in a holding pattern in a very strong support zone. It’s also bouncing off a strong trend line. Both of these levels have been respected for over a year now. Additionally, the stock is massively oversold, with RDI fluctuating between 21 and 23. If the price closes below 4.60 then that’s when you need to start worrying. If that happens, it’ll probably head towards 4 and hit the lows of March 2020. We’ll probably stay in this zone (i.e. between 4.65 and 5) for a while yet but unless something catastrophic happens, the price will rise out of this zone sooner rather than later."

"@Roe You have been singing the same tune since the mid teens. Looking at your post history, you need about a 200% move from here just to break even."
"@JD - Just to confirm. You're a dentist that has all day to sit on a message board? About a week ago, you indicated ""when a patient asks if they should use Invisalign or Smile Direct, I just show them a chart of both stock and then ask them , ""which company do you think has a better product and which would you be more comfortable with correcting your teeth?"" They pick Invisalign every time."" I laugh. First of all, you claim you're a dentist but spend most of your day bashing SDC. So...if you're a dentist, you're not a good one. Second, if my dentist held up stock charts when I'm in there for professional dental services, I'd run for the hills."
Listened to interview with cfo on wall street bets. I will hold.
So Invisalign is going to spend to open all the stores like SDC. Why would they do that. There profits would drop like a rock. Wall Street would cream the stock.
Just bought another 5000 soldiersTo increase to 43000 strong! Good luck longs !
