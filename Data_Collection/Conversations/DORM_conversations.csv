"<> Average vehicle age in the United States is expected to marginally grow between 2017 and 2019, with projections for the latter at 11.8 years.<> If a recession comes within the next few years, the age of cars in USA will increase even more, and a lot of replacement parts will be sold to maintain and keep these vehicles on the road.<> Dorman Products is a recession economy hedge company and thus will do well today and in a future economic downturn situation."

What’s up with DORM’s “Flash Crash” during the opening hour of the market (Aug 27th)?? Did an Algo react to some bogus tweet (news)? Or did an HTF get a software upgrade and go batty? Not a peep about this on Yahoo! Finance or in the news today?!
Why did this drop so much?

"Any thoughts about the really long term view on auto parts. Wonder if the increase in EVs that have much fewer moving parts will have long term effects on the auto parts companies. It will be 10 years before EVs really make up a large part of the market, but it seems to be coming."

"A “Flash Crash” in DORM stock price near open today. Stock was down over $4/share before recovering. Looks like the Algos dived on bogus news, or had a screw loose."
"This professional portfolio manager is banging the table for $DORM:https://www.twst.com/interview/identifying-small-caps-that-can-compound-capital-over-timeWhile the founding family still owns approximately 20% of the entire company, the day-to-day operations are run by Kevin Olsen and Matt Barton, who have long tenures within the company. What we really like about this business is the predictable mid- to high-single-digit organic revenue growth, modest pricing power as new products are introduced, the opportunity to further penetrate a substantially larger end market, creating a long runway for future growth and expense control."

I bought a 2001 Jeep Cherokee and did a lot of work on it last year. That’s where I first heard of Dorman. They are the cheapest parts that are decent quality. They are all over Amazon and other websites. I think this company is so overlooked and is easily worth 30% right now.

"Dorman is up for a simple reason. The average middle class Joe or Jill is not buying new cars in these uncertain times,so they instead fixing their older, used one. This in turn boosts up dorman. We middle class people all go to Autozone, O'Rileys, Napa, Advanced Auto or PepBoys for parts. A lot of the stuff is also from CHINA. Today at Dorman facilities they were broadcasting on their in Plant TV's questions to their employees...... Questions like, ""Will Dorman make getting the Vaccine MANDATORY?"" They even had a employee meeting about it. Dorman is a non-union plant as well. In my opinion, this is the kind of act that makes people go Union. Forced Vaccinations by a company can drive the average Joe or Jill to Unionize in one form or another. If I ever go for a job interview I will ask....""Does your company mandate taking the Vaccine?"" Nowadays that's a relavent question for an interview. Only 10% of American Adults have taken it. Don't let them fool YOU. Give it a year and watch the issues that are going to arise. Dorman facilities are nice, they have awesome gear and equipment, but they have huge turn over. Let's hope they don't forget that there are many real, middle class people in their company that don't agree with Dr. Fauci. Most people want to work, but at what Price? A stock Price? HMMM>"

Anyone can shed some light where might this stock go in a month?
"I can't help wondering what the short-interest is on DORM today. While the tariffs may have some effect on the earnings going forward, the number of shares held short at the end of July show that somebody thinks the bottom will fall out. I don't see that happening. If it doesn't, there will be one massive short squeeze coming up. Good luck, longs."

why is there such a drop today?
"I think move into electric cars and trucks are holding this stock back and it might continue to weaken as more and more electric vehicles come online, long term trend is a problem, company will make money but PE will compress. Stock price will be helped by buyback but that does not help in long run. does anyone know if company playing any role in EVs."

"Pretty good results on the earnings release. I rue the day I sold this several years ago at $20 per share.Wed, October 28, 2020, 6:15 PM EDTDorman Products (DORM) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.14 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.79 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.67 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items."
"Sold the call I had bought today at 14.20 after buying on 8/1 for 7.50 just got impatient with waiting on a double. I also bought a trading lot on 7/30 for 67.53 and sold it on 9/10/19 for 79.75.I still have some long lots. But at about 1/3 of the max I have held of DORM the last Year or so.The China thing combined with the simple finviz chart that this is hitting the upper line is why I sold.""scale in, scale out, online commissions are FREE"""

"DORM sees another $4/share ‘flash crash’ in price again at the opening this morning. No one is explaining this, why? Whose dumping the stock of this excellent company?"
