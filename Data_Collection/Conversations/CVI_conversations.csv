"When we own or consider owning a particular stock, we sometimes look at the price history and wonder how it is possible that a few short years ago people were able to get in so cheap; CVI has certainly been an example in the past. When we look back at the unbelievably low prices and wish there were such opportunities again, we sometimes fail to remember that the stock in question once faced a consensus belief that it is a basket case company. I believe CVI is in the middle or latter stages of one of those funks. There are ALWAYS valid reasons for the pessimism at the time. Today we have the never-ending burden of RINs along with Cathie Wood comparing petroleum to whale oil. Less than two months ago, I perceived an un-natural price dip and increased my position by 1000sh at 11.45. The plan was to do a 31day wash buy/sale to suck in some cap losses from CVI shares previously purchased at much higher prices. The problem: Do I sell now and grab that $8+ per share profit while booking a long term loss? Or do I ride it out and be happy with the averaged-down overall cost basis? Either way, 2021 taxes are gonna suck."
"So today we end the week with a powerful move upward in our share price on top of the significant gains we have enjoyed this week. We're about 3 weeks away from our third quarter earnings and I anticipate a very good report on the strength of the oil and fertilizer markets in Q3. I was pleased that Mr. Lamp decided to delay the upgrades at UAN until next year to capture the strong profits in the fertilizer sector. I know there are differing opinions regarding Mr. Lamp's performance but I, for one, think he has done a great job of navigating our ship through the difficult times of the last two years and I am hopeful that he will stay on for another term when his contract expires this December. In light of the strong markets in crude, refined products and fertilizer in Q3 I am feeling more optimistic that we will see a return of our dividends in the .40-.50 range this quarter. I know that RIN prices and requirements have been a thorn in CVI's side recently, along with volatile oil markets and demand issues but I believe the oil markets are and will continue to enjoy a much better environment in the upcoming months and the RIN issue will soon be clarified if the EPA can set aside their political bias and actually make a decision. That event alone should be very beneficial to keeping a lid on our gas prices and restore CVI's share price to pre-Covid levels. I find it obscene that CVI is trading below $20.00 with $90.00 crude prices.Hope you all have taken some positions at some great prices in the oil patch to enjoy future gains that are sure to come in our ""transitory"" inflationary environment. I finished building my position in EPD last month so its back to the drawing board to identify my next target. Currently considering MPLX,BPMP, MMP or OMP... Thoughts?? Cheers!"
Had some extra cash sitting in my account and couldn't resist the CVI sale. Bought 1000 more at $19.50
Time for serious share price correction upward! CVI is significantly undervalued. I'm sure I'll look back at this year and wish I had bought more while the price was so low.
Thanks for the drop
Need the share price to break $ 20.50! Hopefully before year end! Come on baby!
it appears to me that the upcoming earnings release has been leaked
"Just as what happened in the last four trading days, volume picked up substantially in the last 15 minutes along with our share price. In those last 15 minutes today over 220k shares traded which was about 25% of daily volume. Someone is accumulating CVI shares."
Buying today

"Is increasing Oil price the primary reason for the recent increase in CVI share price, or is there an earnings surprise expected, other? Thanks for your thoughtful responses."
"Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. refiners are expected to show higher earnings for the third quarter as margins to sell gasoline and diesel have improved despite the surging cost of crude oil, analysts said.After more than a year of depressed fuel demand, gasoline and distillate consumption is back in line with five-year averages in the United States, the world's largest fuel consumer. That has boosted margins on refined products to more than double what those companies were making at this time a year ago.The seven largest independent U.S. refining companies, including giants Marathon Petroleum (MPC.N) and Valero Energy (VLO.N), are projected to post an average earnings-per-share gain of 66 cents, versus a loss of $1.32 for the third quarter of 2020, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (GRAPHIC: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-REFINERIES/EARNINGS-OUTLOOK/mopanjqyzva/)Those gains are driven by the 3-2-1 crack spread, a proxy for refining margins, which assumes a barrel of crude oil is refined to three parts gasoline, two parts diesel and one part jet fuel. That spread is currently at $21 per barrel, compared with around $9 a year ago.Energy demand has recovered swiftly from the worst days of the pandemic in 2020, and Brent and U.S. crude oil prices have reached multi-year highs in recent days. But product demand has also increased, and that has helped boost margins.Product supplied - a proxy for U.S. refined product demand - was 21.5 million barrels per day in the most recent week, slightly higher than the same period in 2019, prior to the onset of the pandemic, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).""The market is getting back in equilibrium,"" Credit Suisse analyst Manav Gupta said in a note.Refiners are also benefiting from lower inventories of their products as recent storms and the pandemic knocked refining capacity offline. Approximately 2.5 million barrels per day of refining capacity has been shut since the start of the pandemic, which is almost four times the 10-year average, according to Credit Suisse's Gupta.Delta Air Lines' refinery in Monroe, Pennsylvania, earned nearly $100 million last quarter, its first positive results since the first quarter of 2020, according to figures released last week. Tudor Pickering Holt analysts cited strong gasoline and diesel crack spreads as helping the refiner recover.Jet fuel demand is still below pre-pandemic levels, but international flights are expected to resume to Europe in November. The spot price of U.S. Gulf Coast kerosene-type jet fuel is $2.10 dollars per gallon, the highest since October 2018, despite demand still 12% below 2018 levels, per EIA data.Analysts have also been raising estimates for refiners such as PBF Energy and Hollyfrontier due to declining costs of complying with the nation's biofuels laws. Refiners are required to blend ethanol into the nation's gasoline pool or buy credits for others who can.The cost of those credits declined sharply in the third quarter. Reuters reported in September that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to recommend reducing federal biofuel blending mandates for 2021 to below 2020 levels, according to analysts."
not worried 30 before end of year
I hope I didn't make a mistake selling 25$ puts
Broke resistance at 20 - clear sailing to 25.
Thank you shorts
Any guesses on price action the rest of the week leading up to Monday's earnings announcement?
"EPA set to propose cuts to biofuel blending in win for oil industry - ReutersSep. 22, 2021 12:25 PM ETPBF Energy Inc. (PBF), CVI,DK,HFCREGI, DAR, GPRE,ADM,PSX,VLO,MPC,CRAKBy: Carl Surran, SA News Editor94 CommentsEthanol 3Refiners rise and biofuel stocks slide after Reuters reports the Environmental Protection Agency is proposing big cuts to U.S. biofuel blending requirements for 2020, 2021 and 2022.According to the report, the EPA would lower the 2020 mandate to 17.1B gallons and the 2021 mandate to 18.6B gallons, which would be lower than the 20.1B gallons that was finalized for 2020 before COVID-19; the agency also reportedly would set the 2022 level at 20.8B gallons.Renewable Energy Group (REGI -1.2%), Darling Ingredients (DAR +0.5%), Green Plains (GPRE -0.6%) and Archer Daniels Midland (ADM -0.6%) all fell sharply before paring losses.But refiners are surging: PBF +10.8%, CVI +7.3%, DK +7.6%, HFC +6.9%, PSX +4.7%, VLO +4.6%, MPC +4.1%.ETF: CRAKToday's report basically adds details to a Reuters story last month that the EPA likely would reduce biofuel blending mandates below 2020 levels."
why the big decline today
"Changes at the top. CFO and CAO both resigned this past August. This quarterly earnings release will likely be interesting. The stock price is strengthening along with the increase in oil prices. Personally, I’ll defer increasing my position till after the earnings announcement as I’m cautiously concerned when the 2 top finance people resign and neither retired"
