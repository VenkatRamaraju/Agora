With CVI now owning CVR Refining along with the entire distribution from CVRR I'm wondering of CVI might announce a dividend increase at earnings at the month. Bumping it up to $1/shr seems reasonable and a good business move to get the share price up. Thoughts?
"Good Morning Everyone - I believe wise investors position themselves so market or sector volatility doesn't cause emotional stress. I haven't always been in that position, but today I am.The energy sector is the mother of all cyclical sectors, which I believe is part of the magic; If it was easy, then morons could be successful investing here.About legging in; I admire people who have been legging into CVI in modest amounts. It takes the pain out of mistiming a move while still improving a long term position. I believe CVI is a long term stock.It would be preferable to wait until after the next earnings call, but I may make yet another modest CVI purchase today. The argument for waiting is that the price premium to be paid after good news is probably worth it.Best of luck to everyone this week!"

Con man Carl and sidekicks please sell this tin can to the recycling market. No one at CVI has a vision for the future. Let’s convert for diesel. oh let’s not convert for diesel. please make up your mind. And stop using RIM as your excuse. You knew this head wind years ago. You don’t know how to make bio or (spend the money when you had it to ) buy a company that does.
No sell off on June 10th. Icahn owns most of the stock of this company!
"At this stock price, if they keep dividend every year, it means 20% return!"
"Mafee here,Fasten your seat belt, this is going to be a real roller-coaster ride. Sell on the highs, buy on the dips. Remember, the CEO is the cheerleader, the stock price is the number on the scoreboard."
Brutally oversold
wow we might see 30 before earnings!!!

"Oil is cheap now because the delta variant when we have more demand of gas , refineries have a lot of gains of margins better than pre pandemic"
"Based on what has transpired over the past several weeks, my gut tells me that a major institutional holder(s) wanted out and hopefully got out. The trade noise, inverted curve and overall lack of clear economic direction from white house has made it difficult to get out since it appears that no one wants to step up and fill the void especially if an economic downturn is nearing. Oil prices worldwide are reacting to reality of an oil glut combined with both the Saudis dumping oil and anticipation of surprise lifting of Russian sanctions"
"CVI gave back half of its gain today. Well, it is too soon to celebrate!!"
"Interesting observation. I bought in at $21 after announcement of dividend was made. Dividend is touted as a 20% distribution but with stock dropping to $19, I’ve effectively lost $2. Or nearly all the cash portion of the distribution. Question to myself is how long will it take for share price to rebound to $21 or above per share? Or else all I got out of this were shares of DK which will trigger tax effects when I dump."
"Interesting that Moody's still does reviews of CVR Partners LP, especially considering that that entity was absorbed and no longer trades as a separate entity. I will make sure to read it in detail to know whether I want to invest in a stock that no longer trades or not XD"
"As I mentioned earlier this week, I sold all of my investment in CVI. I had held the investment for 7 years starting with CVRR. My reason for selling. I hold significant holdings in the bigs, BP, Chevron, Total, as well as the major drillers, and pipelines. In researching and listening to the Bigs, it became clear to me that they are intent to utilize this “recession” in fossil fuel usage as a means to cripple the small and medium size players. Listening to the most recent earnings comments from Lamp it became apparent to me that he recognizes the predicament that CVI is in. The government will be no help as evidenced by its failure to resolve the RIN issue. CVI needs to desperately resolve this exposure ASAP, blending biodiesel isn’t the answer in my opinion given what is finally happening in the diesel fuel market. For the past 5 years diesel gasoline prices were comparable to premium gasoline prices, now they match regular prices. Why? Because the bigs are trying to utilize excess refining capacity with diesel. Should CVI acquire its own retail channel outlet, that could change its exposure to the Bigs.As I said in my last post, I will be watching and maybe jump back in. It took me a while to accept the macros facing the industry so I’m no longer optimistic. With that said, money can still be made investing in CVI by playing the bounces in demand for the limited float. Being that I tend to be an investor who buys and holds, I likely won’t attempt to play the bounces. Good luck to all"
"I still have not received my dividends yet, has everyone else? If I don’t have Monday who should I call? Or what should I do? I have Etrade"
CVI needs to sell its UAN shares and buy back CVI shares. At these oil prices CVI used to be around $58 per share. They can make HUGE profits by selling UAN shares.
Ok along with the DK shares we should be getting roughly $2.60 per share in cash distribution per CVI share held if my math is correct.
"@Lucifer, I am still holding a lot of DK. I never have owned any CVI. I have never seen the spread as much as today $3.00. I thinking about doing a wholesale swap 1 for 1. Any thoughts? Also, I am heavily invested in fertilizer and my mega Nitrogen fertilizer company CF, is up 50% in the last 4 months. I keep wondering if CVI has enough share of that market to move the needle with their small fertilizer operation? Why is DK doing so much better than CVI right now?"
"Speciale dividend paid tomorrow..How does ""due bills attached affect the trade in the stock?"
probably they will reestablish a regular dividend by the end of 2022
"Icahn Enterprises stockholders will be very pleased with all the Profits they will be showing in their books for this Quarter, thanks to Icahn selling as many shares as he could in the Open Market of both, CVRR & CVI, he hoped that the small holders would panic and sell their shares too."
"CORRECTION: Today's share adjusted CVI price is $22.97. (86.83 M cvi divided by 147.6 M cvrr = 0.588 x $39.08 = $22.97.Add UAN price $3.65 = $26.62, which is not far from the estimated 5 year average CVI price of $25.90"
Been averaging in on the collapse. CVR is now my largest holding. I hope management scooped up some shares on sale. We’re being paid to wait on the pendulum to swing back. Feeling good about deploying cash out at 16%. I feel a little bit like Buffet— feasting on others fears.
10 percent upward movement after hours. Interesting. Any news I missed.
Oil rising. CNBC headline is that oil is loved again. I hope the experts come on tv and say electric grid cannot possibly handle charging EV's in large numbers.
"I have followed this stock since early 2015. At my peak I owned 20,000 share. Basically, I acquired the stock because of its dividend, its location and proximity to crude at discount prices and because Carl Ican was the major shareholder and I thought I’d right his coattails. My initial avg. cost was around $13 (started out buying in at 26.50 and average cost down with purchases at $5 per share when the company got hit with the RIN effect. I rode the stock up the the conversion, up to its peak of around $55, all because the RIN exposure was gone and Ican was talking merger or acquisition. Last year I finally sold at around $21 a share as I no longer have/had faith in management. The reality is management has and will never have a strategy to address the RIN exposure. The RIN issue is purely political and no one but the farm belt cares. I wish everyone still hanging on to their investment good luck but I’m done posting, and likely following. Truly disappointed in David Lamps inability to come up with a plan or worse that maybe Ican is vetoing the plans for tax loss utilization purposes."
Hope CVI is worth something after making CVRR unit holders whole. Thats what happens when board members don't act in the best interest of all unit holders not just Uncle C. Subtract legal fees from the crack spread.

"The forced transition to clean energy, economies trying to grow out of Covid, and OPEC cashing in on it while they can is causing the lack of supply and increase in oil, gas. Putin is being accused of gouging EU for natural gas while his pipeline awaits final approval."

"OMG! I have been away for a while and there are STILL people here grouching because they are upset about not taking the exchange offer!At least for a while, there appears to be no danger of reducing our bloated dividend. This company does well in rising volatile oil markets, and I am happily staying long."
@Lucifer...Icahn’s base cost for CVI is $15.67 according to a recent article by John Vincent who follows IEP...believe you inquired about that a while back...
Was researching the 3:2:1 crack spreads for refiners and it is now at around $21. This compares to around $10 in 2020. This suggests a strong qtr. ended June and likely Sept. for all refineries given cost reduction programs previously put in place. Wouldn’t surprise me if dividend reinstated at 6/30 for both CVI and DK. (This is in spite of RIN exposure)
What im wondering is where is DK share price going? Will us CVI shareholders get interested in DK once we own shares in it and add more shares or will we see DK shares as as a windfall and sell to get the cash? Or simply hold on to new DK shares?

"Changes at the top. CFO and CAO both resigned this past August. This quarterly earnings release will likely be interesting. The stock price is strengthening along with the increase in oil prices.

Does any savvy investor know whether the stock will fall by 4.92 on the day the dividend is paid? Usually the stock price is effected and drops by the amount of the dividend. Just wondering if this will be true in this case. thanks

"When looking at the CVI website, they own a little less than 40% of UAN, a master limited partnership (MLP). They also state that they are the general partner to this MLP. Does anyone know how financially CVI will benefit from UAN considering that nitrogen type fertilizers are on the rise? I assume it will have a positive effect...but to what degree?"
"Only 83 million people dead- but the profits of oil and gas more important. The metric is based on temperature-related mortality, deaths that occur as a result of weather events like heat waves, such as heat stroke.Researchers estimate that for every 4,434 tons of CO2 released into the Earth’s atmosphere beyond the 2020 rate of emissions, one person globally will die by the end of the century.The metric assumes the Earth will experience a warming of 4.1 degrees Celsius by 2100.Many studies project that climate change can cause a significant number of excess deaths. Yet, in integrated assessment models (IAMs) that determine the social cost of carbon (SCC) and prescribe optimal climate policy, human mortality impacts are limited and not updated to the latest scientific understanding. This study extends the DICE-2016 IAM to explicitly include temperature-related mortality impacts by estimating a climate-mortality damage function. We introduce a metric, the mortality cost of carbon (MCC), that estimates the number of deaths caused by the emissions of one additional metric ton of CO2. In the baseline emissions scenario, the 2020 MCC is 2.26 × 10‒4 [low to high estimate −1.71× 10‒4 to 6.78 × 10‒4] excess deaths per metric ton of 2020 emissions. This implies that adding 4,434 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2020—equivalent to the lifetime emissions of 3.5 average Americans—causes one excess death globally in expectation between 2020-2100. Incorporating mortality costs increases the 2020 SCC from $37 to $258 [−$69 to $545] per metric ton in the baseline emissions scenario. Optimal climate policy changes from gradual emissions reductions starting in 2050 to full decarbonization by 2050 when mortality is considered."

CVI trading at double its yearly low. Still 100% down from its yearly high. Wondering if this is a good entry point.

"Gosh, just look at the premarket bludgeoning CVI is taking this morning! I can’t help but feel sorry for our dear friend and fellow YMB poster Lucy who had the opportunity to sell his considerable CVI investment in the mid-50s, but instead elected to maintain his position as CVI shares cratered in 2020. I know he felt some relief and even vindication when his Uncle Carl provided the special dividend; however, the economic windfall which we had all expected to receive is quickly being eroded by the declining share price. I am glad that our dear friend Lucy was able to get in a quick vacation to South Dakota before his portfolio deteriorated further. I don’t know whether he will have the funds to visit his son in Wisconsin later this summer and wonder if we should open a “go fund me” campaign to support his potential need for additional travel funds."
Has the company determined the final per share price for DK for the shareholders that get the distribution? Was it the price on May 24th?
"Pure Speculation...Icahn’s IEP shares are getting somewhat pressured (he owns over 90%) on the assumption that he’s doing very poorly...meanwhile CVI is tanking for no apparent reason other than Icahn has been rumored that he maybe changing his mind on selling CVI (70+% owner) and UAN (35ish% owner) because he collects the dividends and they have been profitable...Seems like the chairs could be getting rearranged, but again, just speculating..."

Read the report on the company that came out today. They estimate the share price should be between 37 and 46 per share. Energy sector decline plus fear of loss of tax wavier contributed to the decline. The company is still extraordinarily well run and we need energy. I for one look at the decline in price as a gift and I am buying more.
Earnings release this evening??
Biggest head wind for this company is the RIN exposure and managements clear lack of a true plan to address it. Waiting and hoping for the courts to reverse a ruling is not a plan
I’m actually excited about the reduction in dividend! That gives them some extra powder to buy and expand. Never thought this would be a growth opportunity but glad they are taking it. Reward for the long term investment.
"FACTS staring as Natural Gas Industry: Vistra Corp. owns 36 natural-gas power plants, one of America’s largest fleets. It doesn’t plan to buy or build any more.Instead, Vistra intends to invest more than $1 billion in solar farms and battery storage units in Texas and California as it tries to transform its business to survive in an electricity industry being reshaped by new technology.“I’m hellbent on not becoming the next Blockbuster Video, ” said Vistra Chief Executive Curt Morgan. “I’m not going to sit back and watch this legacy business dwindle and not participate.”A decade ago, natural gas displaced coal as America’s top electric-power source, as fracking unlocked cheap quantities of the fuel. Now, in quick succession, natural gas finds itself threatened with the same kind of disruption, only this time from cost-effective batteries charged with wind and solar energy.Natural-gas-fired electricity represented 38% of U.S. generation in 2019, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA, and it supplies round-the-clock electricity as well as bursts during peak demand. Wind and solar generators have gained substantial market share, and as battery costs fall, batteries paired with that green power are beginning to step into those roles by storing inexpensive green energy and discharging it after the sun falls or the wind dies.Battery storage remains less than 1% of America’s electricity market and so far draws power principally from solar generators, whose output is fairly predictable and easier to augment with storage. But the combination of batteries and renewable energy is threatening to upend billions of dollars in natural-gas investments, raising concerns about whether power plants built in the past 10 years—financed with the expectation that they would run for decades—will become “stranded assets,” facilities that retire before they pay for themselves.Across the country, much of the growth in renewable energy to date has been driven by state mandates that have required utilities to procure certain amounts of green power, and by federal tax incentives that have made wind and solar more economically competitive.But renewables have become increasingly cost-competitive without subsidies in recent years, spurring more companies to voluntarily cut carbon emissions by investing in wind and solar power at the expense of that generated from fossil fuels. And the specter of more state and federal regulations to address climate change is accelerating the trend."
"Despite the pending doomsday exchange, the exact timing of it is not known (at least not to me). No one should panic sell because of it. The longer it takes the better because until it is officially announced and implemented, both CVRR and CVI pps should go up through the summer...just my guess."

"Looking for thoughts on LT viability of a CVI investment.

In any case, some refinery assets are basically worthless in this environment and there is rapid acceleration of all EV metrics which further exacerbates the problem. I see value at some point and maybe the small independents are the net winners if the Shells, Exxons of the world shutter overcapacity- I guess that's the question I am struggling with and asking for help- what is the LT investment case for CVI?

"CVR Energy Reports Evaluation of Strategic Alternatives, Sale of Cushing Terminal4:46 pm ET May 21, 2019 (Globe Newswire) PrintCVR Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CVI) today announced that it has engaged BofA Merrill Lynch as its financial advisor to assist it in evaluating potential strategic alternatives, including a potential sale. The Company intends to evaluate alternatives in combination with its ongoing focus on accomplishing its strategic objectives, prudently managing costs and operating its businesses safely and reliably.CVR Energy also announced that its subsidiary has entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of its 1.5-million-barrel Cushing, Oklahoma, crude oil terminal and related assets to an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. for total consideration of approximately $36 million, and concurrently closed the transaction.""CVR Energy is committed to maximizing value for its stockholders,"" said Dave Lamp, CVR Energy's Chief Executive Officer. ""Both the sale of the Cushing terminal, which allowed us to derive value from an underutilized asset, and the exploration of potential strategic alternatives support this commitment. We are excited about the Company's prospects and ability to enhance stockholder value through our initiatives, regardless of the outcome of a strategic alternative process.""CVR Energy does not have a defined timeline for the exploration of strategic alternatives and makes no assurances that its evaluation will result in any transaction being announced or consummated. The Company does not currently intend to discuss or disclose further developments with respect to this process, unless and until its Board of Directors approves a specific transaction or otherwise determines that further disclosure is appropriate."
"Texas’s mistakes are common to other states. The country still relies on a far-flung system of large, remote power plants that need long-haul transmission systems to bring power to market. That’s why energy planners across the country need to implement more energy storage and microgrids close to where we need them and build a more comprehensive network of underground high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) power lines that are robust against bad weather."
"This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 57.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this diversified holding company would post a loss of $1.23 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.33, delivering a surprise of -8.13%."
Icahn put the company for sale at $55. Now selling for $20 less that 50% discount!! Too risky to be shorting here!!! Anything could happen since he decided to give the $492M to shareholders instead of keeping the cash for the company. Something might be brewing!!
any reason to stress out? is price going to stabilize? what do you learned investors think?
"Just reread the conference call script. My take aways (1). $3.00 annual dividend clearly safe for long term. (2) a “special” bump in a quarterly dividend amounts to “share” special gains from events more likely than not. Idea being to share gains with shareholders. My final thought, as the company continues to improve its manufacturing efficiencies and become the niche Permian basis refiner, thereby enhancing its acquisition value, the company intends to spin its excess cash back to shareholders. I read very little negative in the call yesterday, in fact, i found it interesting and full of optimism."

"Interesting tempered conference call. My takeaways. 1. No M&A action in 2020. 2. Cap. Expenditures in line with prior expectations. RIN exposure - cautiously optimistic unlike 2015 - 2017 time period. 3. Potential in 2020 or early 2021 for 1 time special cash dividend. At minimum, $3.20 run rate pretty secure for foreseeable future."
"As we are all painfully aware, it has been a rough few weeks so far. With April WTI down ~$10 today on failed OPEC negotiations, Monday promises to be special.Bull case: I cannot call a washout, but tomorrow is looking like it. Bear case: Unless sentiment improves a LOT, I cannot imagine people wanting to go into next weekend long if the market futures end up being correct.I MAY sell something and use that money to buy more refinery stocks including CVI tomorrow."
"My take on earnings release. Interesting positive news on RIN, especially with government earlier announcement on EPA direction. Tomorrow likely to get more info on capital expenditures plan. $0.75 dividend confirms my thought that this is the go forward ## with future upside coming from M&A activity of the future"
Sure looks GLOOMY here- SAD to lose over $40 in 2 years. Hope you recover.
"Over the years this board has been great sharing thoughts and ideas about CVI. Now it seems to be focused elsewhere on things not relevant to CVI. For example, the company is making a huge investment and leap into Diesel. I like that decision. I am also of the opinion that while GM has said it will focus on electric vehicles, hoping by 2135 to be largely electric, I personally think that the conversion to electric is a long long way further in the future given the constraints etc. the largest being the time it takes to charge up a battery. Right now, the avg life of a car on the road is 11 years. This would suggest that there are at least 175 million gas powered vehicles on the road, and this doesn’t count diesel driven trucks. So while the wheel is turning there is a future for the refinery industry."
Goldman calls for $65/bbl by summer. That's likely to help.
Something fishy going on with this recent rally. Small volumes moving the stock persistently higher. No more selling right now for me as long as it keeps moving higher.
It has rewarded in 2021 big way and will reward in 2022.
"In the immortal words of the Boy Wonder, Luis P, from four days ago: ""800 shares still short and just waiting for huge dividend cut."" You preached to the choir a few weeks ago about the short. What did you say your short position was at? $34.00? Well, lets see...last week after earnings it went up four dollars in one session...over 10% at one point if my memory is correct. Than, your own panic set in early on Friday and you claimed that there was a sell off or some nonsense about bag holders. It went up four bucks at the close on Thursday. By close of business Friday, it sold off a whopping 19 cents. Has anyone ever seen an investor with worse timing than Luis P ? I hesitate to even mention the I - word in association with him. He's clearly the worst stock investor I've ever seen.I'm looking at the close on Friday and I see $45.63. How do you feel about that Boy Wonder? What's that brown spot on your tights, Old Chum? And oh yeah, that .75 cent dividend that you claimed would get cut to .50 or zero? Well, you called that one wrong too. Nostradamus, you are not. Nostradumbass? Yeah, I think that probably fits better. This is the same guy that held on to CVRR to the bitter end, only to get forced out by Carl and his band of brothers at a whopping $10.50 a share. He could have taken the Exchange Offer like the rest of us. Heck, he could have even sold his shares north of $15 to $20 since there were months to do it. Nope...he kept his shares and was forced to fork them over for $10.50 a share. Carl, the CVI board, and shareholders like myself want to extend our thanks to you Luis P. Paying you a robust $10.50 a share to get rid of you and your brethren helped our bottom line. For this, we do thank you for your contribution!A word of advise for anyone new to the board. Do yourself a favor and just put Bozo the Clown on ignore. He's never been right about anything when it comes to this oil refinery. The only thing he's good at is losing money. Of course, if you enjoy losing money, go ahead and follow his lead. Don't say we didn't warn you. In baseball, its three strikes and you are out. For Luis P, strike one was the $10.50 a share debacle. Strike two is that infamous short position. Strike three is his call on the dividend cut . In baseball, you get designated for assignment if you get cut from the team and they can't or refuse to send you to the minor leagues. Luis P is most definitely associated with that term, designated for assignment. Time for the Boy Wonder to fly down the bat pole and say goodbye."
I believe the BOD of CVI knew that the share price would go down before they issued no dividends for this quarter and the next quarter also. The CVI is down again today is not a surprise. Millions barrels of oil Icahn got at negative price have done nothing for this company??
"Tracy Jackson had title to both positions and resigned per an 8K submission. As of today the cfo is Neumann, 37 years old and the new CAO is Conoway?? I saw something this morning about it but can’t seem to pull it up again? Strange. The rumor mill had changes coming and so the 1st to go are the CFO? 8K says no issues but this qtr release will undoubtedly tell the story. All about cash."
"Just sold my position in CVI today. Never a bad thing to take a profit, but I'm mindful of management's desire for a sale later this year. I'm a little anxious about being out of the stock when (if) the announcement comes. It would be interesting to hear opinions/insights on timing, prospective buyers, and possible premiums. Anybody out there want to share some ""pearls of wisdom"" on the subject? Thanks in advance - Gold"
Is it a good entry point?
"Earnings Call HighlightsHere are some excerpts from the Earnings Call that are of notable interest. Quotes from Dave Lamp, CEO:- ""The Brent TI differential remains healthy, driven by ever growing domestic shale oil production and decline in crude oil.""- ""Safety is our number one priority and safe operations result in reliable operations; profitable growth of our crude gathering and logistic systems by purchasing local crude in our backyard and building out our pipeline system to supply our refinery operations.""- ""Continue to increase our internally generated RINs and reduce our RIN exposure, this includes increasing bio diesel blending as well as continuing to explore building a wholesale and retail business; increase the liquid yield at our refineries, execute our turnarounds on time and on or under budget; and prudently manage or costs.""Projects:- ""Increased liquid yield at Wynnewood by completing the design and evaluation of a new isomerization unit and which will increase our production of premium gasoline and improve capture rate""- :Started to schedule a process design to replace our hydrofluoric acid catalyst and our Wynnewood operation with solid catalyst. This project is also expected to increase production of premium gasoline at Wynnewood.""- ""Increase our natural gasoline processing and WCS capacity to 40,000 barrels per day through phase projects at Coffeeville refinery.""- ""...projects listed if approved by our board will have expected returns of 30% or higher."" Tank Farm Update:- ""Complete the sale of our Cushing, Oklahoma tank farm as it is an underutilized asset for us...""On the question of future Mergers and Acquisitions:- ""Well, I think we've stated before that we are probably not a consolidator, but a consolidatee, and I think we are a classic case of refining system that has 100% exposure to Brent-WTI and we would be an excellent fit for somebody that needs to manage that risk and I think that there in the lies the attraction to these assets that and commands a premium that we get today in the marketplace. Nothing's changed on that front or we have not started a process yet or don't know if we will, but we'll see what happens here in the future.""The future of the .75 cent dividend payout which is currently yielding a robust 7%:- ""Well, I think we're very comfortable with the $3 dividend. I think we generate enough cash to support it for a long time as well as grow our business in some of these profit improvement projects that I think is a good way to reward our shareholders as it is for the increase in the dividend. So I think depending on how we do and what the Board approves that will determine what happens I think with the dividend going forward."""
"Listened to yesterday’s Barclay’s presentation. My takeaways. (1) Dividend going forward is very, very safe. Paying the dividend is a priority of current management. (2). Buyback of outstanding shares is not an item on the companies strategic strategy list. Would increase dividend before they start buying back shares. (3). 1st qtr of 2020 should be interesting industry wide as refineries work to extract more sulphur from mix while maintaining octane. (4). Looking to squeeze out an additional 1% in efficiency during the 4th qtr. (5) RIN exposure is still out there but belief is that impact will be minimal at least through 2020. I see the stock price recovering into mid 40’s by 12/31."
"Gang - Here we are, one minute to the deadline to increase tariffs in Chinese goods. Nymex and Rbob are up in overnight trading.I am not for tariffs, but am VERY glad that (for the first time in my life) we have an administration that stands up to the Chicoms' IP and other economic thefts."
"The court case is clearly a negative issue, as are the biofuel waivers and overall weakness in the sector. The price has plummeted 30% in the past 6 months. A buyout appears completely off the table. Hardly something to applaud. Is a dividend cut next? Any positive trends?"
"The refining subsector is getting clobbered today, and CVI is right in there getting beaten up too; Is this an opportunity?The market did not seem to warmly embrace the raising of $1B. Different people can offer their philosophies about company debt (I hate debt), BUT money even at corp bond rates is very cheap right now. Half the money going to retiring costlier near term debt is good by any reasonable person's standards. People can argue about the intent for the balance.I PERCEIVE that CVI has a habit of responding well to earnings reports and earnings calls, and have no reason to expect otherwise for the upcoming report. The market seems to forget about our favorable path a while after the report, and I expect that is happening to us right now.Without ignoring the challenging nature of the refining biz, I am treating this price action as an opportunity to add to my already excessive position; hopefully will buy another 500 to 1000 shares this week."
"With all the upward movement and the fact that CVI production capacity is somewhat at max production, I suspect 1 or both of the following to occur before 7/10. 1. Announcement of normal $0.75 Dividend along with an additional special dividend to reflect net proceeds from sale of storage tankers. 2. Definitive LOA with prospective buyer of CVI. There are no other reasons for stock to be moving up as it is."
"Dramatic Dividend Increase to entice CVRR holders to Tender their shares, well planned by CVI management. Kudos to them"
"It's hard to see a bright future for oil refineries in the USA. Renewable fuel and EV use is now the official policy of the government, and industry seems on board with it."
"CVR Energy Explores Possible Sale, Hires BofA Merrill Lynch as Adviser5:09 pm ET May 21, 2019 (Dow Jones) PrintBy Bowdeya TwehCVR Energy Inc.

"6 separate insiders selling shares recently. When multiple insiders are selling, that is almost always a warning signal. Still like the dividend and prospects, but one cannot ignore this data."
"i entered yesterday at 15.40 usd following a buy recommendation for 100-200% in 1 year 180 shares, not much, but... : )"
Time for serious share price correction upward! CVI is significantly undervalued. I'm sure I'll look back at this year and wish I had bought more while the price was so low.
To those who want to sue CVI because they didn't accept the CVI offer:Do you sue the burger joint because they ran a limited time offer that you were too clever to take advantage of during the offer period because you thought you could do better?
@RV. Do you have anything relevant regarding CVI? Appreciate your political concerns but was hoping to read more comments relative to financial prospects/risks to investors of CVI
"Gosh, it seems like a week or two ago that Lucy was strutting around like a peacock bragging how he snagged additional shares below 17.30. Unfortunately, that was not the bottom and soon we might be below 15.00. Lucy has over 8000 shares. Let’s hope for a quick recovery in the share price before October so he can go deer hunting with a clear mind"
An institution or two has apparently lost faith in the company. Effectively anyone who bought for the great dividend and is still holding has lost the value of the dividend and still owes taxes on the dividend.
It is hilarious cvrr holders are so happy they got an extra 43 cent dividend. They went from being worth 63% of cvi to 47% or well over 7 bucks a share.
Stock price will continue to lag until the RIN exposure is totally addressed and the company can reinstate a solid quarterly dividend. The last earnings call suggested to me that either management is totally frustrated and severely limited in its ability to effectively address the RIN matter OR that it has a plan it’s about ready to execute and did not want to tip it’s had just yet. Hoping it’s the later.
Gotta love the Supreme Court. gave us some relief on RIN issues.
Lucy Lucifer-do you hear what your Papa Carl is telling you. It’s not looking good for you.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/icahn-says-stocks-overvalued-virus-160022091.html
Any word on how Company is going to respond to RIN exposure. Biodiesel project is one year away and only addresses 1/4 of issue. Dividend is tied to outlook for future free cash flow. Right now there does not appear to be any.
"Kerry is off the rails with climate hysteria. He now says 9 years left to avoid catastrophic climate conditions and the plan to accomplish this is what ?How in the hell is the world going to have all EVs, mainly wind and solar, drastic changes in industrial and agricultural methods all up and running in 9 years ? The whole thing is a scare tactic, like the corona virus, to put Americans under government pollution dictatorship."
"My GUESS is that today's price action is the result of tied-up exchange shares of CVI landing in people's accounts yesterday and being ready for sale.It would have been better if CVI processed the offer exchange acceptances as they came in. I am top heavy with CVI, but must have the discipline to wait a while to sell."

Biodiesel investment on hold, Delek attempted acquisition merger died, RIN solution actions merely crying into a towel. Ican used to be a wizard, now we have Hertz and CVI. Ouch."
"I wonder if Ron knows the SEC has more interest in him and his one man puppet show, then Carl Icahn. I almost kept my shares of cvrr at his and Bob's urging. How many of you suffered real losses because of those Ron's posts. I had contacted SEC months ago, you should too. This internet thing is like the early days of the wild west."
"I am staying long, but for those thinking about taking some profit, this quarter's results are not so different than the results reported October 24, 2018. I remember delayed price action that may or may not have been caused by external forces. Here are some closing prices retrieved from Yahoo:10/23 38.0410/24 35.61 (earnings released after close. I believe call was the next day mid morning - not sure)10/25 40.5010/26 40.8310/29 40.7510/30 42.3410/31 43.0011/01 42.1611/02 42.11 (ex div)11/03 42.0511/06 39.76Possible explanations:1. External marked activity, and the relative price actually was strongest on 10/25 (didn't check this)2. CVI is a bit under the radar of the big money and maybe some investors didn't analyze results quickly (hard to believe)3. Confirmation from competitors' results was needed.4. Larger competitors also with good results drew drew money their direction?5. (Your idea here)Right or wrong, if I was thinking about profit taking, I would probably wait a couple of days."
"I was a little surprised yesterday that we and other refining companies seemed immune from the market's overall downward move.I did not realize that yesterday morning in El Dorado, KS the HollyFrontier plant had a section blow up. Happily nobody was killed and I believe there were no serious injuries. This event (though we never wish for a fire to happen at a competitor) naturally can provide upward pressure on peer stocks.Unfortunately explosions do happen in this business, and it can be a good hedge to own more than one refinery stock; the resulting upset in the product flows can shift the retail market enough that the smoothly running plants see a boost in profit."
"Just as what happened in the last four trading days, volume picked up substantially in the last 15 minutes along with our share price. In those last 15 minutes today over 220k shares traded which was about 25% of daily volume. Someone is accumulating CVI shares."
"This smells like stench from putrid sweage- they have money for polluters but not for green energy to create jobs and transform energy to less polluting tech: Exclusive: U.S. Congress launches probe into multibillion-dollar 'clean coal' tax creditBy Tim McLaughlin1. The multibillion-dollar subsidy has gone to numerous major firms over the years, including financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs Group, drugmaker Mylan, and DTE Energy Co, the main utility for Detroit, according to Reuters. The Internal Revenue Service awards the subsidy based on lab results rather than real-world emissions, according to the news service.2. A 2018 Reuters special report found that Duke Energy, another recipient of the tax credit, produced nitrogen oxide emission rates between 33 percent and 76 percent higher at a North Carolina facility from 2012 to 2014, the first three years it received the subsidy.3."

"Some Hedge Funds and Institutions actually got it right. Refer to HITE Hedge Fund and this announcement that came out in December. For the Millennial mentality that exists in keeping an eye on this board for any hope that a law suit will miraculously save your incompetence in the $10.50 a share credit that you rightfully deserved, this only serves as further proof that some institutions actually ""got it right"". Investment managers or firms who sat on the sidelines paying no attention to what eventually happened should truly get fired. For that matter, those of you that got your $10.50 a share were also as incompetent as them. Read on. Note something in the bullet points that leans towards what Lucifer has been saying all along..that being Mr. Lamp's juxtaposition and that this Hedge Fund basically has their crap together and they too foresee CVI getting sold to the highest bidder. The old saying ""patience will reward"" will most assuredly hold true here. QUINCY, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mr. Lamp and Members of the Board of CVI Energy:We applaud your Regulation FD Disclosure of November 29, 2018, whereby “in light of current conditions” you have begun to consider exercising your call right on the remaining 23 million publicly-traded CVRR units not owned by Icahn affiliates.We believe that exercising the call right will be highly accretive to CVI’s free cash flow, as per the Exhibit that follows this letter.However, we do encourage you to wait for a period of time before exercising that call right, until after you have cut the CVRR distribution to zero.Our reasoning is as follows:(1) Cutting the CVRR distribution to zero will allow CVI to move toward zero consolidated debt, making CVI a more attractive acquisition target should Mr. Icahn decide to exit his position.(2) Your team’s operating and strategic talents could make better, higher return use of this cash than simply returning it to CVI ahead of when it would be required for CVI’s continued dividend.(3) This move would have limited (or no) near-term impact on the CVI share price, since CVI has sufficient cash on the balance sheet to pay its dividend for the next 3 quarters.(4) Simply put, continuing to pay CVRR unitholders is a waste of money.(5) The call price for the remaining units is based on the 20 days preceding the three days prior to your exercise of the call right. That price is currently about $16.74, which is far above today’s price of $14.36. Given the recent downward trajectory of the CVRR unit price, we believe that the call price will decline as time passes – especially if CVRR’s unit price continues declining. Per the Exhibit, CVI Energy can save over $150 million should it wait to exercise the call until CVRR’s unit price has reached $10.00.We are heartened that your interpretation (as per your SEC filings) of the CVRR Partnership Agreement is the same as ours – that the general partner (CVI) is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the common units of CVRR to be repurchased by it upon exercise of the call right, and that CVI may use its own discretion, free of fiduciary duty restrictions, in determining whether to exercise the call right.In fact, we believe that CVI Energy has a fiduciary duty to its own shareholders (including ourselves) to execute the call right at the lowest possible call price.We appreciate your consideration and look forward to our ongoing dialogue.Highest regards,James Jampel and Matt NiblackHITE Hedge Asset Management LLC"
I called CVI they stated they were taking call but when I selected to asked questions they said it was no one wanting to asked questions. They them went on to end the earning call. They CVI and CVRR are avoiding questions about the tender by any means necessary.
"Waiting for earnings release, I believe it will be good! Icahn got million of barrels when oil price went negative! Also we will get dividends!"
Tesla ignites in garage while being charged overnight. Fire spreads to the Tesla parked next to it burning everything to the ground. Warning goes out to all EV owners: don't charge overnight in the garage or unattended in unsafe conditions. Do not park a full charged EV in the garage.

"When we own or consider owning a particular stock, we sometimes look at the price history and wonder how it is possible that a few short years ago people were able to get in so cheap; CVI has certainly been an example in the past. When we look back at the unbelievably low prices and wish there were such opportunities again, we sometimes fail to remember that the stock in question once faced a consensus belief that it is a basket case company. I believe CVI is in the middle or latter stages of one of those funks. There are ALWAYS valid reasons for the pessimism at the time. Today we have the never-ending burden of RINs along with Cathie Wood comparing petroleum to whale oil. Less than two months ago, I perceived an un-natural price dip and increased my position by 1000sh at 11.45. The plan was to do a 31day wash buy/sale to suck in some cap losses from CVI shares previously purchased at much higher prices. The problem: Do I sell now and grab that $8+ per share profit while booking a long term loss? Or do I ride it out and be happy with the averaged-down overall cost basis? Either way, 2021 taxes are gonna suck."
On 2/17 CVI will report earnings. I think it will be better than last quarter. I don’t think dividends will resume after first quarter of 2021. I do hope stock price will go back to $40.
"@Gold & Lucifer, I’ll also be happy with either decision, sell or hold...I think the one wild card of course is Uncle Carl. He’s reached his objectives with CVI and he has other irons in the fire, CZR NWL, that are counting of him to turn his full attention to...and added to that his also his Tax Situation with IEP. One thing we do know, he won’t drag his heels on it and he knows his options, we’re just beneficiary’s..."

Watch CVI. Nitrogen prices soaring
"Good afternoon Lucifer, and congratulations on doing some profit taking! Nobody ever went broke because they took profits.CVI is almost 20% of my portfolio with my last purchase being 1K shares in mid December. I was thinking about trimming, but see the volatility in the oil markets as being good for refining margins.A few other speculative plays I am in are:AMD: They are on track to dominate the high margin part of the processor business while Intel is playing catch-up and price erosion. Price is hard to enter at right now; hoping for a market decline to drag this down.CLF: Iron Ore. Looks like a value trap, but is it? The CEO is a bulldog. This one seems to be in a trading range of ~9.50 to ~10.5. I expect a break-out so will probably not trade out of this cycle.BHC: Formerly Valeant Pharma and ICN before that. It seems that they periodically have to change their name to shed some bad-will. A turnaround story; hopefully CEO Joseph Papa can be disciplined about cleaning up a terrible balance sheet.GRMN: Garmin has a pristine balance sheet. Price is high now, but IFF we have a December 24 style washout this can be a solid buy.NOV: I rode this one down horrifically. If they have another bad quarter, will be time to cut/run unless it looks like drilling is looking at a turnaround."
All I know is that Lucy’s back on the YMB articulating his insights regarding the RIN situation and it’s likely impact on the small oil refiners like CVI. I’m confident now that his presence suggests that the future will be positive and the share price will continue to rise. Welcome back ole friend! Gosh I’m thirsty!
"Please, CVI, come back to life!"
"The elimination of the quarterly dividend was very disappointing given what Lamp said during the 1st qtr earnings press release conference call when he said that the Company could have easily paid the $0.80 per share but decided not to because the company felt that the stock price wouldn’t benefit from paying the full dividend. I took his further comments to mean that the 2nd qtr dividend of $0.40 was safe in that conditions in the market have been steady to improving since he made his comments. This 2nd qtr press release was a SHOCK to me for multiple reasons starting with the, Oh by the way, we had a $41 mil asset impairment. Where were the auditors with this adjustment at year end? This all smacks of Accounting irregularities and it will not surprise me if a lawsuit doesn’t come out of this. Where was future guidance? I will be closely listening to the call today. Lastly, while the elimination of the dividend is disheartening, it’s not life threatening to me personally. However, what is threatening to me is the fact that I feel this company has fallen into the “GE” model of making up results etc hoping that the insiders can get off the merry go round before the music stops."
"DK shares were posted in my account ,but no cash dividend ?? Anyone has received the cash dividend ???"
"Trump to deny pending retroactive biofuel waivers - ReutersSep. 9, 2020 12:59 PM ET|About: Valero Energy Corporation (VLO)|By: Carl Surran, SA News Editor Pres. Trump has ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to deny dozens of requests from oil refineries for retroactive waivers from U.S. biofuel laws, amid worries that the issue could cut into his Farm Belt support in the upcoming election, Reuters reports.The decision would mark the end of an attempt by the U.S. refining industry to comply with a January court ruling that said the Trump administration should not have issued some waivers in previous years.The Trump administration has quadrupled the number of exemptions given to refiners, causing outrage in farm states such as Iowa; biofuel advocates say the waivers hurt demand for corn-based ethanol, while the oil industry criticizes the costs of the obligations.Potentially relevant tickers include VLO, MPC, PSX, PBF, HFC, CVI, ADM, GPRE, GPP, PEIX, REGI, REX, ANDE"
"If the stock price drops basically the same amount as what we get paid in DK and cash dividend, then we're back to zero basically and they cancel each other out right? So, where is the upside of this payout to us? Am I missing something?"

"Anyone on this board follow VLO closely? My quick look indicates that CVI almost mirrors it as far as stock price movement. From what I understand, VLO is move in direct relationship to the movement in crack spreads. VLO is down sharply as are crack spreads these past 3 months. The wild card for CVI may be the shift in products that Lamp has been talking about during the last 3 quarterly press releases wherein CVI was starting to focus on lower sulfur premium octane blends. I don’t know enough either way so reaching out to see if anyone else can add comments."
Occasionally watch this board to read the meltdowns and temper tantrums of those who blame others for their own short sightedness. Yes CVRR will be sold.. Yes CVI will be sold. I have made a lot of month on all of the 3 stocks since 2007 and held during the down years of Fire and Flood of CVRR and CVI. Everyone is eyeing the Mid Continent play here. If you hold CVI then you will get a share. If you read the buyout offer for your CVRR shares then you know you wont get anything. Its all there whether you think its fair or not. Good luck to all. make as much as you can with CVRR before its gone. my best guess is 1 year. good luck to all.
"I have witness every market crash in the past 50 years, each time, the market has come back stronger. I expect we will all recover from this one as well. Yes there will be great pain and suffering in the oil patch as the world sorts out the survivors (there will be NO winner) in the oil patch just survivors. Refineries should do fine provided they were properly hedged relative to oil purchase agreements sine a refinery is merely a value added process. I suspect when the dust settles and the Coronavirus scare is behind us, Americans will come out of there houses and rev up the cars for summer vacations. Planes will suffer as pocket books will be filled with coins and less paper. Hang tight, and unless you feel that you are the Houdini of stock picking, simply hold and wait er out"
Surprise earnings waooo
"This is a tough one! Clearly we are seeing at this moment a parabolic move. Surprisingly CVI is an outlier in this move. Why?I have my finger on the sell button, but am only going to sell a small amount - Probably at the same $50 Ken mentioned."
RIN situation is so dire that the company will struggle to be cash flow positive in 2021. without adjustment to RIN process will struggle well into 2022. there will be no money for dividends. please read up since management is in denial regarding discussing the issue. yes its political. corn states vs Texas with Texas out gunned
"Amazingly, I am considering taking a position in CVRR as a hedge against some legal challenge, though I expect such a challenge would most likely be doomed."
"CVI 10/22 had (5 again) AH 45,997 trades? That’s $2.7m???!!!What going on past week?Inside?Hedge?"
A clear case of market manipulation. No reason for the stock to be down when everything else is up.
Great CC. Tough business with the EPA choking off any possible profit. Lamp had some great ideas that were win-win (even politically) but I don't have high hopes that RIN relief is near.
Serious talks about RINS removal from the administration!!! Imagine if this consolidates we could see $30 next week!!!
"""we believe there are better shareholder return opportunities in the current market environment, including the potential for industry consolidation,” Lamp said""Hmmm.... So does that mean he's hunting for a company to acquire? Or is he looking to find a suitor to buy CVI? Hard to tell from such a broad statement... Guess we'll get more clarity from the conference call. -Gold"
"When I initially invested in CVI and CVRR, they could be seen by many as Dividend Traps. This most recent quarter adds additional support to the idea that CVI is NOT a dividend trap, but is an undervalued growing cyclic stock with a board that likes to deliver an amazing 7% annual return that seems pretty reliable. That 7% will be hard to maintain once the broader market realizes what a gem CVI is. I am so happy with the dividend, I WANT the stock price to plunge so I can accumulate some more. Unfortunately (or fortunately) if the price drops with normal market turbulence, I will be competing with CVI to buy those shares.This is looking more and more like a stock that deserves to be one component of widows' and orphan's accounts, except OUR widows and orphans get to ride in the front of the airplane.About the possibility of a sale; I am not discouraged, and prefer that a company doesn't declare that they want to be purchased. If anything, our marketability has gone up with this most recent earnings release and narrative. My opinion.Have a great rest of the week everyone!"
"When oil prices hit $60 and above per barrel, this company becomes a huge cash cow."
"Conference call takeaway. Deja Vu. No dividend for next 3 qtr. trying to conserve cash, in a wait and see what the world is going to be “demand” wise. depressing, bleak outlook. Company not in danger of going out of business like many of its competitors. Rather, company is in a survivor mode, head down, keep refining crude hoping for demand to recover and crude to go up, so crack spreads can improve to levels where excess cash becomes available. Acquisitions will require cash to make or result in significant dilution to existing shareholders. IMO, it will take long term thinking and stomach to hold onto this stock."
Biden may cancel Keystone pipeline permit on first day. So much for support for the oil and gas industry. Makes one wonder what drives the American voter. 8 years of anti-oil followed by 4 years of pro-oil immediately reversed by another U-turn. Going in circles are we ? Even California oil/environment experts agree that the oil sent to the US refineries by the Keystone pipeline can be cleaned up sufficiently to meet current standards.
Need the share price to break $ 20.50! Hopefully before year end! Come on baby!
Saudis have indicated that they will increase supply to keep the price of oil from going too high. Saw an article that said that a growing number of lawsuits against big oil will be made on the basis of climate change and big oils knowledge of it for years while covering it up. They want to treat big oil like they treated tobacco companies.
"NEW YORK, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to recommend to the White House reducing federal biofuel blending mandates for 2021 to below 2020 levels in what would be a blow to the biofuels industry, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday."

i love this but when will it pull back?? maybe take some of the table?
"I Love Luci and his mansplaining his prediction of a CVRR divy cut... Surprise, an actual divy increase!Ta ta"
A small pop this AM. Rather nice to see. Hope it is a trend .
"ALTM natural gas midstream company in Texas has been a good buy for me thus far. Got in at 53 and now at 68 with a 9% dividend yield. It is a corp, not a MLP. Who cares about clean energy when there is still money to be made in oil and gas."
I'll take that 12% dividend on the shares I bought yesterday and the Biden bounce today for the win.
"Questions for everyone: Congrat's to CVI shareholders for a good and improving quarter. For those who are invested in CVI a lot longer and are more knowledgeable, how much return(benefit) does CVI get investing in the vertically integrated renewable biofuel project? This projected has been talked about extensively in their presentations with projected capital expenditures into $140 million, but there is no talk about what kind of benefit in dollar amounts or annual rate of returns, we can expect CVI to get out of these projects. How is that going to help the turnaround of CVI from current quarterly losses to a return of positive cashflow and net income, in addition to the turnaround and rising higher oil prices? Right now CVI is generating losses and liabilities mainly due to the Federal Law that require them to buy more RINS credit each quarter."
"Saudis are truly not a friend to America given recent acknowledgment of lowering crude prices. Totally understand their need to raise cash but their actions are greatly suppressing gasoline futures refining crack spreads. Also, everything I’m reading suggests China is no longer buying US crude. These 2 global actions are going to hurt small/medium sized refineries in US. We need administration to waive RIN exposure immediately/permanently to help refineries get through winter months that begin shortly."
Up $1.30 today. Possible dividend reinstatement?
ill take 200 shares of DK worth $4400 for my 2 k shares of CVIInvestors don't even realize the 1/4 Billion of CVR holdingsThe gift that keeps giving Wait until they initiate their own div based on income Ka Ching!
"Jesus, did you see analyst EPS estimates 70% lower yoy with higher sales ?"
"Within a few hours, we will have the quarterly earnings. More than usual, I am not stressed about what the numbers will be or how much cheese the mice get.What is not clear to me is how the RIN situation affects us; We have gone from having no good solution path for the RIN debacle to having two paths with the surprise SCOTUS ruling and management's efforts to vertically integrate a RIN solution. Would we have been better off with only one RIN solution?Our recent giant special dividend was encouraging, but I am not using that to read too much into regular dividends this quarter.The call tomorrow is more important than the numbers (numbers could prove me wrong), and I will be happy with either a very positive or a very negative market reaction. Two quarters out seems more interesting and important."
"Take aways from today’s conference call. (a) CVI clearly wants a consolidation within the industry. Expect noise by end of year. Sooner if economy roars back which I give a 10% chance of. (b). Lamp said that CVI could have paid $0.80 but didn’t because share price wouldn’t have responded. Depending on M&A action, expect dividend to move upward each of next 3 quarters. All bets are off if economy tanks due to Covid-19. (c). Underlying feeling that Ican has something big about to pop. Only think is it’s at a 2x or 3x multiple"
"Good Afternoon Gang! For most of a lifetime, I laughed at people who looked at squiggly lines and made by/sell decisions based on them (The ouija board doesn't have the correct markings to guide trading decisions).Today, I use technical analysis to confirm and time trades with pretty good improvement in trade performance.My quick look at the YAHOO daily chart seems to show that CVI is now trading above the highest close since 2015, or if you consider dividends, 2013. We are in an extraordinary situation with crude and rbob prices based on discrete events, but that is a statement that is always true.I am not a skilled technician, but my read is that barring the retirement of temporary conditions (Iran, Refinery difficulties and don't forget Venezuela), the market needs to contend with this ~$50 range before it can break-out; some of those 2015 people just want their money back. If a breakout happens, the next stop is approaching $70 (2013) minus cumulative divs at which time I will pull all my chips off the table.My plan is to hold strong even though I assume that breakout will fail - for now. Maybe will buy some protection puts at some point if the IV drops to a sane level.Have a great day!"
Upgraded
Someone knows some good news somewhere.
"Hey folks I'm confused by this in their most recent quarterly report:"" CVR Energy will not pay a cash dividend for the 2021 second quarter.Today, CVR Partners announced that the Board of Directors of its general partner declared a second quarter 2021 cash distribution of $1.72 per common unit, which will be paid on August 23, 2021, to common unitholders of record as of August 13, 2021. ""... So there's a difference between a cash dividend vs a cash distribution?And I know I only have to wait less than 24 hours, but I'm hoping this means I wake up to more cash by $1.72 x Number of shares amount?... Thanks."
Next quarter will even better than this extraordinary report
As soon as they get the cost of #RIN down then there will be dividends again. It won’t be long now it will be back $60./shares. Carl Icahn has 71 millions shares. Maybe he will sell CVI.
"So are these guys going to do what they can to suppress CVI value during exchange period to get CVRR shares cheap on the .6335 exchange rate? As you can see, I don’t trust anyone in this game."
"Good cvi newsBy Jennifer A. Dlouhy and Michael HirtzerFive American governors are asking the Trump administration to waive U.S. biofuel-blending requirements, arguing the cost of complying with the mandates on top of coronavirus-spurred lockdowns pose a “severe economic harm” to the country.￼SPONSORED CONTENTTake controlTransform WG insecticide puts you in controlThe governors, including Greg Abbott of Texas and Gary Herbert of Utah, made their plea in letters to the Environmental Protection Agency, which now has 90 days to decide on the matter. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards lodged his request earlier, on April 7. Governors Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma and Mark Gordon of Wyoming also are pushing for relief."
"So today we end the week with a powerful move upward in our share price on top of the significant gains we have enjoyed this week. We're about 3 weeks away from our third quarter earnings and I anticipate a very good report on the strength of the oil and fertilizer markets in Q3. I was pleased that Mr. Lamp decided to delay the upgrades at UAN until next year to capture the strong profits in the fertilizer sector. I know there are differing opinions regarding Mr. Lamp's performance but I, for one, think he has done a great job of navigating our ship through the difficult times of the last two years and I am hopeful that he will stay on for another term when his contract expires this December. In light of the strong markets in crude, refined products and fertilizer in Q3 I am feeling more optimistic that we will see a return of our dividends in the .40-.50 range this quarter. I know that RIN prices and requirements have been a thorn in CVI's side recently, along with volatile oil markets and demand issues but I believe the oil markets are and will continue to enjoy a much better environment in the upcoming months and the RIN issue will soon be clarified if the EPA can set aside their political bias and actually make a decision. That event alone should be very beneficial to keeping a lid on our gas prices and restore CVI's share price to pre-Covid levels. I find it obscene that CVI is trading below $20.00 with $90.00 crude prices.Hope you all have taken some positions at some great prices in the oil patch to enjoy future gains that are sure to come in our ""transitory"" inflationary environment. I finished building my position in EPD last month so its back to the drawing board to identify my next target. Currently considering MPLX,BPMP, MMP or OMP... Thoughts?? Cheers!"
I told you about ALTM. I actually bought for the yield as much as the return earlier this year at $53.Today it sits at $76.
"Completely out of my investment. Refining sector is in for a long hard grind against the big boys now and the big boys control all the key ingredients for the sector. With that said, I will be watching, listening with cash in hand to jump back in at any time. I suspect the stock price in the short term will test $10 per share before it tests $20 per share"
ERCOT report confirms gas- and coal-fired plant outages played big role in June grid woes
Hey how come I didn't get my $1.72 cash Distribution on the 23rd of August?
"How much of the UAN (the master limited partner) does CVI own..If substantial, then CVI is looking good with UAN, in the nitrogen fertilizer business, a part of its major holdings"
Just bought in here. What is not to like as business model is growing and highly profitable. And nice dividends.
Can someone confirm or correct my understanding about dividend? I believe to get dividend you needed to own CVI shares on or before May 24th and hold on to them until June 10th. The amount of dividend is 492M divided by 100.53M shares outstanding =$4.89 per share.
ALTM now at $84 wi' $6 dividend that is being paid.Just for you MB
"From Nasdaq.com, as of 9/30/18. Carl Icahn C owning 71,198,718 shares of CVI. Carl Icahn C still own 5,750,000 shares of CVRR. Why he is not exchanging CVRR?https://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/institutional-portfolio/icahn-carl-c-18190"

"NICE!A new study found that technological advancements and the cost of batteries could support all vehicles being sold in the United States to be electric-powered by 2035.Currently, only 1.8 percent of people in the U.S. have electric vehicles, with cost being a major factor, as well as the availability of charging ports. However, the study states the initial cost of electric vehicles should be on par with gasoline vehicles in approximately five years.study’s estimates, this will be driven by a drop in the cost of batteries and advancements in efficiency. In relation to the availability and cost of charging ports, it found that “the plummeting cost of wind and solar power have enabled a rapid and cost-effective expansion of a clean electricity grid, a cost-effective pathway” to expanding and establishing a public network of said stations.“The upfront price of electric vehicles is coming down rapidly, which is very exciting. Because of battery technology improvements, most models now have a range of 250 miles, higher than the daily driving distance of most people, and now come with pretty astonishing fast-charging capabilities,” said Amol Phadke, co-author of the report"
cvi should expand fertilizer business and move toward oil refining for industrial use; move away from transportation fuel refining as the Biden-Harris regime will be taking us into the EV age.
Renewable fuel at Wynnewood OK plant put off because of high soybean oil prices. I suppose everybody has seen that. It appears CVI is losing out on the renewable fuels business to more flexible and specialized companies.

A strong letter sent to the EPA today signed by 16 senators. Looking up for CVI share holders. Hopefully we'll all get our break and get the stock prices up.https://www.toomey.senate.gov/download/epa-letter-8-23-21

"Can someone explain to me why this stock is down 18% in the last month, while KMI is up 10% ...? I bought in at 40 thinking it was a good price. Guess I bought a little early"
CVI looking great with steady UP.Let’s have a good confirmation of increased Divi !
"cvi's 34% holdings of uan are worth close to 2 bucks per cvi share today versus just twenty cents at the november 2020 lows when cvi bottomed at 9.96. lowest cvi CLOSING price that week was 10.41. with the cvi renewables projects near completion and hopefully some relief from past RIN obligations, low debt, and the current attractive crack spread, cvi would seem to appear ""a birds nest on the ground"" . i am heavily long for better or worse and bought more today at 12.89. any serious constructive information to enhance my bullish outlook would be appreciated as well as any bearish thoughts which might dim my enthusiasm and possibly result in my lightening up substantially."
So the wild card here is if Carl sells this dog. Can he get at least $45/share for this company? They have done a lot of upgrades to the refineries. The stock is supposedly 37% undervalued.
"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/us-has-multiple-affordable-paths-to-net-zero-emissions-by-2050-california/594317/Achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 could be ""surprisingly feasible,"" with costs running $1 per day per person or just 0.4% of the U.S GDP, according to a new report from the University of San Francisco, the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and consulting firm Evolved Energy Research."
EPA finally under enough pressure that sone relief for RINs is in sight.
When can cvi go back to 20? I think 6 months later is possible.
They are giving a $492.000.000 million dollar dividend and stock down!!! The company is strong and doing great!!
"I am liking this price action, though a falling price doesn't suit everyone.If we are down below 40 tomorrow, I will most likely pick up another 500 to 1000 shares."
"Been accumulating CVI. Now, 41,165 shares. Next to Oxy, Dk, Kim, and Frt this is my 5th largest holdings. Very undervalued given the oil prices."
