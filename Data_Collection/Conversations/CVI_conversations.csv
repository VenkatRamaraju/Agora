Thank you shorts
"Based on what has transpired over the past several weeks, my gut tells me that a major institutional holder(s) wanted out and hopefully got out. The trade noise, inverted curve and overall lack of clear economic direction from white house has made it difficult to get out since it appears that no one wants to step up and fill the void especially if an economic downturn is nearing. Oil prices worldwide are reacting to reality of an oil glut combined with both the Saudis dumping oil and anticipation of surprise lifting of Russian sanctions"
RIN situation is so dire that the company will struggle to be cash flow positive in 2021. without adjustment to RIN process will struggle well into 2022. there will be no money for dividends. please read up since management is in denial regarding discussing the issue. yes its political. corn states vs Texas with Texas out gunned
"Tracy Jackson had title to both positions and resigned per an 8K submission. As of today the cfo is Neumann, 37 years old and the new CAO is Conoway?? I saw something this morning about it but can’t seem to pull it up again? Strange. The rumor mill had changes coming and so the 1st to go are the CFO? 8K says no issues but this qtr release will undoubtedly tell the story. All about cash."
"When I initially invested in CVI and CVRR, they could be seen by many as Dividend Traps. This most recent quarter adds additional support to the idea that CVI is NOT a dividend trap, but is an undervalued growing cyclic stock with a board that likes to deliver an amazing 7% annual return that seems pretty reliable. That 7% will be hard to maintain once the broader market realizes what a gem CVI is. I am so happy with the dividend, I WANT the stock price to plunge so I can accumulate some more. Unfortunately (or fortunately) if the price drops with normal market turbulence, I will be competing with CVI to buy those shares.This is looking more and more like a stock that deserves to be one component of widows' and orphan's accounts, except OUR widows and orphans get to ride in the front of the airplane.About the possibility of a sale; I am not discouraged, and prefer that a company doesn't declare that they want to be purchased. If anything, our marketability has gone up with this most recent earnings release and narrative. My opinion.Have a great rest of the week everyone!"
"Been accumulating CVI. Now, 41,165 shares. Next to Oxy, Dk, Kim, and Frt this is my 5th largest holdings. Very undervalued given the oil prices."
"People are talking about electric cars for the future where there won’t need crude oil. Will we have electric airplanes or electric boat, ship, submarines?I know we can use solar to heat houses and what else?"
"Texas’s mistakes are common to other states. The country still relies on a far-flung system of large, remote power plants that need long-haul transmission systems to bring power to market. That’s why energy planners across the country need to implement more energy storage and microgrids close to where we need them and build a more comprehensive network of underground high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) power lines that are robust against bad weather."
"Mafee here,Thank you Uncle Carl for sharing the DK price gain with the shareholders."

"EPA set to propose cuts to biofuel blending in win for oil industry - ReutersSep. 22, 2021 12:25 PM ETPBF Energy Inc. (PBF), CVI,DK,HFCREGI, DAR, GPRE,ADM,PSX,VLO,MPC,CRAKBy: Carl Surran, SA News Editor94 CommentsEthanol 3Refiners rise and biofuel stocks slide after Reuters reports the Environmental Protection Agency is proposing big cuts to U.S. biofuel blending requirements for 2020, 2021 and 2022.According to the report, the EPA would lower the 2020 mandate to 17.1B gallons and the 2021 mandate to 18.6B gallons, which would be lower than the 20.1B gallons that was finalized for 2020 before COVID-19; the agency also reportedly would set the 2022 level at 20.8B gallons.Renewable Energy Group (REGI -1.2%), Darling Ingredients (DAR +0.5%), Green Plains (GPRE -0.6%) and Archer Daniels Midland (ADM -0.6%) all fell sharply before paring losses.But refiners are surging: PBF +10.8%, CVI +7.3%, DK +7.6%, HFC +6.9%, PSX +4.7%, VLO +4.6%, MPC +4.1%.ETF: CRAKToday's report basically adds details to a Reuters story last month that the EPA likely would reduce biofuel blending mandates below 2020 levels."

"Some Hedge Funds and Institutions actually got it right. Refer to HITE Hedge Fund and this announcement that came out in December. For the Millennial mentality that exists in keeping an eye on this board for any hope that a law suit will miraculously save your incompetence in the $10.50 a share credit that you rightfully deserved, this only serves as further proof that some institutions actually ""got it right"". Investment managers or firms who sat on the sidelines paying no attention to what eventually happened should truly get fired. For that matter, those of you that got your $10.50 a share were also as incompetent as them. Read on. Note something in the bullet points that leans towards what Lucifer has been saying all along..that being Mr. Lamp's juxtaposition and that this Hedge Fund basically has their crap together and they too foresee CVI getting sold to the highest bidder. The old saying ""patience will reward"" will most assuredly hold true here. QUINCY, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mr. Lamp and Members of the Board of CVI Energy:We applaud your Regulation FD Disclosure of November 29, 2018, whereby “in light of current conditions” you have begun to consider exercising your call right on the remaining 23 million publicly-traded CVRR units not owned by Icahn affiliates.We believe that exercising the call right will be highly accretive to CVI’s free cash flow, as per the Exhibit that follows this letter.However, we do encourage you to wait for a period of time before exercising that call right, until after you have cut the CVRR distribution to zero.Our reasoning is as follows:(1) Cutting the CVRR distribution to zero will allow CVI to move toward zero consolidated debt, making CVI a more attractive acquisition target should Mr. Icahn decide to exit his position.(2) Your team’s operating and strategic talents could make better, higher return use of this cash than simply returning it to CVI ahead of when it would be required for CVI’s continued dividend.(3) This move would have limited (or no) near-term impact on the CVI share price, since CVI has sufficient cash on the balance sheet to pay its dividend for the next 3 quarters.(4) Simply put, continuing to pay CVRR unitholders is a waste of money.(5) The call price for the remaining units is based on the 20 days preceding the three days prior to your exercise of the call right. That price is currently about $16.74, which is far above today’s price of $14.36. Given the recent downward trajectory of the CVRR unit price, we believe that the call price will decline as time passes – especially if CVRR’s unit price continues declining. Per the Exhibit, CVI Energy can save over $150 million should it wait to exercise the call until CVRR’s unit price has reached $10.00.We are heartened that your interpretation (as per your SEC filings) of the CVRR Partnership Agreement is the same as ours – that the general partner (CVI) is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the common units of CVRR to be repurchased by it upon exercise of the call right, and that CVI may use its own discretion, free of fiduciary duty restrictions, in determining whether to exercise the call right.In fact, we believe that CVI Energy has a fiduciary duty to its own shareholders (including ourselves) to execute the call right at the lowest possible call price.We appreciate your consideration and look forward to our ongoing dialogue.Highest regards,James Jampel and Matt NiblackHITE Hedge Asset Management LLC"
"Kerry is off the rails with climate hysteria. He now says 9 years left to avoid catastrophic climate conditions and the plan to accomplish this is what ?How in the hell is the world going to have all EVs, mainly wind and solar, drastic changes in industrial and agricultural methods all up and running in 9 years ? The whole thing is a scare tactic, like the corona virus, to put Americans under government pollution dictatorship."
"Is increasing Oil price the primary reason for the recent increase in CVI share price, or is there an earnings surprise expected, other? Thanks for your thoughtful responses."
"As I mentioned earlier this week, I sold all of my investment in CVI. I had held the investment for 7 years starting with CVRR. My reason for selling. I hold significant holdings in the bigs, BP, Chevron, Total, as well as the major drillers, and pipelines. In researching and listening to the Bigs, it became clear to me that they are intent to utilize this “recession” in fossil fuel usage as a means to cripple the small and medium size players. Listening to the most recent earnings comments from Lamp it became apparent to me that he recognizes the predicament that CVI is in. The government will be no help as evidenced by its failure to resolve the RIN issue. CVI needs to desperately resolve this exposure ASAP, blending biodiesel isn’t the answer in my opinion given what is finally happening in the diesel fuel market. For the past 5 years diesel gasoline prices were comparable to premium gasoline prices, now they match regular prices. Why? Because the bigs are trying to utilize excess refining capacity with diesel. Should CVI acquire its own retail channel outlet, that could change its exposure to the Bigs.As I said in my last post, I will be watching and maybe jump back in. It took me a while to accept the macros facing the industry so I’m no longer optimistic. With that said, money can still be made investing in CVI by playing the bounces in demand for the limited float. Being that I tend to be an investor who buys and holds, I likely won’t attempt to play the bounces. Good luck to all"
probably they will reestablish a regular dividend by the end of 2022
"Listened to yesterday’s Barclay’s presentation. My takeaways. (1) Dividend going forward is very, very safe. Paying the dividend is a priority of current management. (2). Buyback of outstanding shares is not an item on the companies strategic strategy list. Would increase dividend before they start buying back shares. (3). 1st qtr of 2020 should be interesting industry wide as refineries work to extract more sulphur from mix while maintaining octane. (4). Looking to squeeze out an additional 1% in efficiency during the 4th qtr. (5) RIN exposure is still out there but belief is that impact will be minimal at least through 2020. I see the stock price recovering into mid 40’s by 12/31."
"cvi's 34% holdings of uan are worth close to 2 bucks per cvi share today versus just twenty cents at the november 2020 lows when cvi bottomed at 9.96. lowest cvi CLOSING price that week was 10.41. with the cvi renewables projects near completion and hopefully some relief from past RIN obligations, low debt, and the current attractive crack spread, cvi would seem to appear ""a birds nest on the ground"" . i am heavily long for better or worse and bought more today at 12.89. any serious constructive information to enhance my bullish outlook would be appreciated as well as any bearish thoughts which might dim my enthusiasm and possibly result in my lightening up substantially."
Need the share price to break $ 20.50! Hopefully before year end! Come on baby!
i love this but when will it pull back?? maybe take some of the table?
"NEW YORK, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to recommend to the White House reducing federal biofuel blending mandates for 2021 to below 2020 levels in what would be a blow to the biofuels industry, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday."
"With all the upward movement and the fact that CVI production capacity is somewhat at max production, I suspect 1 or both of the following to occur before 7/10. 1. Announcement of normal $0.75 Dividend along with an additional special dividend to reflect net proceeds from sale of storage tankers. 2. Definitive LOA with prospective buyer of CVI. There are no other reasons for stock to be moving up as it is."
Does any savvy investor know whether the stock will fall by 4.92 on the day the dividend is paid? Usually the stock price is effected and drops by the amount of the dividend. Just wondering if this will be true in this case. thanks
Con man Carl and sidekicks please sell this tin can to the recycling market. No one at CVI has a vision for the future. Let’s convert for diesel. oh let’s not convert for diesel. please make up your mind. And stop using RIM as your excuse. You knew this head wind years ago. You don’t know how to make bio or (spend the money when you had it to ) buy a company that does.
"Can someone explain to me why this stock is down 18% in the last month, while KMI is up 10% ...? I bought in at 40 thinking it was a good price. Guess I bought a little early"
"Just sold my position in CVI today. Never a bad thing to take a profit, but I'm mindful of management's desire for a sale later this year. I'm a little anxious about being out of the stock when (if) the announcement comes. It would be interesting to hear opinions/insights on timing, prospective buyers, and possible premiums. Anybody out there want to share some ""pearls of wisdom"" on the subject? Thanks in advance - Gold"
"I Love Luci and his mansplaining his prediction of a CVRR divy cut... Surprise, an actual divy increase!Ta ta"
"LUCY WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING OLD FELLOW. YOUR SYCOPHANTS ARE CRAVING YOUR OPTIMISTIC CVI COMMENTARY. WE YEARN FOR YOUR RANTS ABOUT WOKE DEMOCRATS AND MAGA 2022/2024! WE KNOW YOU’VE LOST A TON OF MONEY ON CVI, BUT IT’S ONLY A PAPER LOSS UNTIL YOU SELL. PLEASE DON’T ABANDON US NOW. GOSH A CAN OF ICE COLD PETE’s WICKED ALE WOULD TASTE GREAT RIGHT NOW."
"@Lucifer, I am still holding a lot of DK. I never have owned any CVI. I have never seen the spread as much as today $3.00. I thinking about doing a wholesale swap 1 for 1. Any thoughts? Also, I am heavily invested in fertilizer and my mega Nitrogen fertilizer company CF, is up 50% in the last 4 months. I keep wondering if CVI has enough share of that market to move the needle with their small fertilizer operation? Why is DK doing so much better than CVI right now?"
What are folks going to do with DK shares? Hold or Sell? Stock's been rangebound last several months.
Is it a good entry point?
"Only 83 million people dead- but the profits of oil and gas more important. The metric is based on temperature-related mortality, deaths that occur as a result of weather events like heat waves, such as heat stroke.Researchers estimate that for every 4,434 tons of CO2 released into the Earth’s atmosphere beyond the 2020 rate of emissions, one person globally will die by the end of the century.The metric assumes the Earth will experience a warming of 4.1 degrees Celsius by 2100.Many studies project that climate change can cause a significant number of excess deaths. Yet, in integrated assessment models (IAMs) that determine the social cost of carbon (SCC) and prescribe optimal climate policy, human mortality impacts are limited and not updated to the latest scientific understanding. This study extends the DICE-2016 IAM to explicitly include temperature-related mortality impacts by estimating a climate-mortality damage function. We introduce a metric, the mortality cost of carbon (MCC), that estimates the number of deaths caused by the emissions of one additional metric ton of CO2. In the baseline emissions scenario, the 2020 MCC is 2.26 × 10‒4 [low to high estimate −1.71× 10‒4 to 6.78 × 10‒4] excess deaths per metric ton of 2020 emissions. This implies that adding 4,434 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2020—equivalent to the lifetime emissions of 3.5 average Americans—causes one excess death globally in expectation between 2020-2100. Incorporating mortality costs increases the 2020 SCC from $37 to $258 [−$69 to $545] per metric ton in the baseline emissions scenario. Optimal climate policy changes from gradual emissions reductions starting in 2050 to full decarbonization by 2050 when mortality is considered."
Any guesses on price action the rest of the week leading up to Monday's earnings announcement?
"Earnings Call HighlightsHere are some excerpts from the Earnings Call that are of notable interest. Quotes from Dave Lamp, CEO:- ""The Brent TI differential remains healthy, driven by ever growing domestic shale oil production and decline in crude oil.""- ""Safety is our number one priority and safe operations result in reliable operations; profitable growth of our crude gathering and logistic systems by purchasing local crude in our backyard and building out our pipeline system to supply our refinery operations.""- ""Continue to increase our internally generated RINs and reduce our RIN exposure, this includes increasing bio diesel blending as well as continuing to explore building a wholesale and retail business; increase the liquid yield at our refineries, execute our turnarounds on time and on or under budget; and prudently manage or costs.""Projects:- ""Increased liquid yield at Wynnewood by completing the design and evaluation of a new isomerization unit and which will increase our production of premium gasoline and improve capture rate""- :Started to schedule a process design to replace our hydrofluoric acid catalyst and our Wynnewood operation with solid catalyst. This project is also expected to increase production of premium gasoline at Wynnewood.""- ""Increase our natural gasoline processing and WCS capacity to 40,000 barrels per day through phase projects at Coffeeville refinery.""- ""...projects listed if approved by our board will have expected returns of 30% or higher."" Tank Farm Update:- ""Complete the sale of our Cushing, Oklahoma tank farm as it is an underutilized asset for us...""On the question of future Mergers and Acquisitions:- ""Well, I think we've stated before that we are probably not a consolidator, but a consolidatee, and I think we are a classic case of refining system that has 100% exposure to Brent-WTI and we would be an excellent fit for somebody that needs to manage that risk and I think that there in the lies the attraction to these assets that and commands a premium that we get today in the marketplace. Nothing's changed on that front or we have not started a process yet or don't know if we will, but we'll see what happens here in the future.""The future of the .75 cent dividend payout which is currently yielding a robust 7%:- ""Well, I think we're very comfortable with the $3 dividend. I think we generate enough cash to support it for a long time as well as grow our business in some of these profit improvement projects that I think is a good way to reward our shareholders as it is for the increase in the dividend. So I think depending on how we do and what the Board approves that will determine what happens I think with the dividend going forward."""
"6 separate insiders selling shares recently. When multiple insiders are selling, that is almost always a warning signal. Still like the dividend and prospects, but one cannot ignore this data."
"As we are all painfully aware, it has been a rough few weeks so far. With April WTI down ~$10 today on failed OPEC negotiations, Monday promises to be special.Bull case: I cannot call a washout, but tomorrow is looking like it. Bear case: Unless sentiment improves a LOT, I cannot imagine people wanting to go into next weekend long if the market futures end up being correct.I MAY sell something and use that money to buy more refinery stocks including CVI tomorrow."
"From Nasdaq.com, as of 9/30/18. Carl Icahn C owning 71,198,718 shares of CVI. Carl Icahn C still own 5,750,000 shares of CVRR. Why he is not exchanging CVRR?https://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/institutional-portfolio/icahn-carl-c-18190"
@RV. Do you have anything relevant regarding CVI? Appreciate your political concerns but was hoping to read more comments relative to financial prospects/risks to investors of CVI
"Good afternoon Lucifer, and congratulations on doing some profit taking! Nobody ever went broke because they took profits.CVI is almost 20% of my portfolio with my last purchase being 1K shares in mid December. I was thinking about trimming, but see the volatility in the oil markets as being good for refining margins.A few other speculative plays I am in are:AMD: They are on track to dominate the high margin part of the processor business while Intel is playing catch-up and price erosion. Price is hard to enter at right now; hoping for a market decline to drag this down.CLF: Iron Ore. Looks like a value trap, but is it? The CEO is a bulldog. This one seems to be in a trading range of ~9.50 to ~10.5. I expect a break-out so will probably not trade out of this cycle.BHC: Formerly Valeant Pharma and ICN before that. It seems that they periodically have to change their name to shed some bad-will. A turnaround story; hopefully CEO Joseph Papa can be disciplined about cleaning up a terrible balance sheet.GRMN: Garmin has a pristine balance sheet. Price is high now, but IFF we have a December 24 style washout this can be a solid buy.NOV: I rode this one down horrifically. If they have another bad quarter, will be time to cut/run unless it looks like drilling is looking at a turnaround."
"Questions for everyone: Congrat's to CVI shareholders for a good and improving quarter. For those who are invested in CVI a lot longer and are more knowledgeable, how much return(benefit) does CVI get investing in the vertically integrated renewable biofuel project? This projected has been talked about extensively in their presentations with projected capital expenditures into $140 million, but there is no talk about what kind of benefit in dollar amounts or annual rate of returns, we can expect CVI to get out of these projects. How is that going to help the turnaround of CVI from current quarterly losses to a return of positive cashflow and net income, in addition to the turnaround and rising higher oil prices? Right now CVI is generating losses and liabilities mainly due to the Federal Law that require them to buy more RINS credit each quarter."
"Good Afternoon Gang! For most of a lifetime, I laughed at people who looked at squiggly lines and made by/sell decisions based on them (The ouija board doesn't have the correct markings to guide trading decisions).Today, I use technical analysis to confirm and time trades with pretty good improvement in trade performance.My quick look at the YAHOO daily chart seems to show that CVI is now trading above the highest close since 2015, or if you consider dividends, 2013. We are in an extraordinary situation with crude and rbob prices based on discrete events, but that is a statement that is always true.I am not a skilled technician, but my read is that barring the retirement of temporary conditions (Iran, Refinery difficulties and don't forget Venezuela), the market needs to contend with this ~$50 range before it can break-out; some of those 2015 people just want their money back. If a breakout happens, the next stop is approaching $70 (2013) minus cumulative divs at which time I will pull all my chips off the table.My plan is to hold strong even though I assume that breakout will fail - for now. Maybe will buy some protection puts at some point if the IV drops to a sane level.Have a great day!"
"Completely out of my investment. Refining sector is in for a long hard grind against the big boys now and the big boys control all the key ingredients for the sector. With that said, I will be watching, listening with cash in hand to jump back in at any time. I suspect the stock price in the short term will test $10 per share before it tests $20 per share"
"When we own or consider owning a particular stock, we sometimes look at the price history and wonder how it is possible that a few short years ago people were able to get in so cheap; CVI has certainly been an example in the past. When we look back at the unbelievably low prices and wish there were such opportunities again, we sometimes fail to remember that the stock in question once faced a consensus belief that it is a basket case company. I believe CVI is in the middle or latter stages of one of those funks. There are ALWAYS valid reasons for the pessimism at the time. Today we have the never-ending burden of RINs along with Cathie Wood comparing petroleum to whale oil. Less than two months ago, I perceived an un-natural price dip and increased my position by 1000sh at 11.45. The plan was to do a 31day wash buy/sale to suck in some cap losses from CVI shares previously purchased at much higher prices. The problem: Do I sell now and grab that $8+ per share profit while booking a long term loss? Or do I ride it out and be happy with the averaged-down overall cost basis? Either way, 2021 taxes are gonna suck."
It has rewarded in 2021 big way and will reward in 2022.
"Within a few hours, we will have the quarterly earnings. More than usual, I am not stressed about what the numbers will be or how much cheese the mice get.What is not clear to me is how the RIN situation affects us; We have gone from having no good solution path for the RIN debacle to having two paths with the surprise SCOTUS ruling and management's efforts to vertically integrate a RIN solution. Would we have been better off with only one RIN solution?Our recent giant special dividend was encouraging, but I am not using that to read too much into regular dividends this quarter.The call tomorrow is more important than the numbers (numbers could prove me wrong), and I will be happy with either a very positive or a very negative market reaction. Two quarters out seems more interesting and important."
When can cvi go back to 20? I think 6 months later is possible.
"""we believe there are better shareholder return opportunities in the current market environment, including the potential for industry consolidation,” Lamp said""Hmmm.... So does that mean he's hunting for a company to acquire? Or is he looking to find a suitor to buy CVI? Hard to tell from such a broad statement... Guess we'll get more clarity from the conference call. -Gold"
"So are these guys going to do what they can to suppress CVI value during exchange period to get CVRR shares cheap on the .6335 exchange rate? As you can see, I don’t trust anyone in this game."
Any word on how Company is going to respond to RIN exposure. Biodiesel project is one year away and only addresses 1/4 of issue. Dividend is tied to outlook for future free cash flow. Right now there does not appear to be any.
Upgraded
Been averaging in on the collapse. CVR is now my largest holding. I hope management scooped up some shares on sale. We’re being paid to wait on the pendulum to swing back. Feeling good about deploying cash out at 16%. I feel a little bit like Buffet— feasting on others fears.
"My take on earnings release. Interesting positive news on RIN, especially with government earlier announcement on EPA direction. Tomorrow likely to get more info on capital expenditures plan. $0.75 dividend confirms my thought that this is the go forward ## with future upside coming from M&A activity of the future"
"Hey folks I'm confused by this in their most recent quarterly report:"" CVR Energy will not pay a cash dividend for the 2021 second quarter.Today, CVR Partners announced that the Board of Directors of its general partner declared a second quarter 2021 cash distribution of $1.72 per common unit, which will be paid on August 23, 2021, to common unitholders of record as of August 13, 2021. ""... So there's a difference between a cash dividend vs a cash distribution?And I know I only have to wait less than 24 hours, but I'm hoping this means I wake up to more cash by $1.72 x Number of shares amount?... Thanks."
"Saudis are truly not a friend to America given recent acknowledgment of lowering crude prices. Totally understand their need to raise cash but their actions are greatly suppressing gasoline futures refining crack spreads. Also, everything I’m reading suggests China is no longer buying US crude. These 2 global actions are going to hurt small/medium sized refineries in US. We need administration to waive RIN exposure immediately/permanently to help refineries get through winter months that begin shortly."
Something fishy going on with this recent rally. Small volumes moving the stock persistently higher. No more selling right now for me as long as it keeps moving higher.
it appears to me that the upcoming earnings release has been leaked
Watch CVI. Nitrogen prices soaring
I hope I didn't make a mistake selling 25$ puts
All I know is that Lucy’s back on the YMB articulating his insights regarding the RIN situation and it’s likely impact on the small oil refiners like CVI. I’m confident now that his presence suggests that the future will be positive and the share price will continue to rise. Welcome back ole friend! Gosh I’m thirsty!
"This is a tough one! Clearly we are seeing at this moment a parabolic move. Surprisingly CVI is an outlier in this move. Why?I have my finger on the sell button, but am only going to sell a small amount - Probably at the same $50 Ken mentioned."
"Interesting tempered conference call. My takeaways. 1. No M&A action in 2020. 2. Cap. Expenditures in line with prior expectations. RIN exposure - cautiously optimistic unlike 2015 - 2017 time period. 3. Potential in 2020 or early 2021 for 1 time special cash dividend. At minimum, $3.20 run rate pretty secure for foreseeable future."
EPA finally under enough pressure that sone relief for RINs is in sight.
"Speciale dividend paid tomorrow..How does ""due bills attached affect the trade in the stock?"
"There are some variant perceptions on CVR Energy, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$25.03"

"FACTS staring as Natural Gas Industry: Vistra Corp. owns 36 natural-gas power plants, one of America’s largest fleets. It doesn’t plan to buy or build any more.Instead, Vistra intends to invest more than $1 billion in solar farms and battery storage units in Texas and California as it tries to transform its business to survive in an electricity industry being reshaped by new technology.“I’m hellbent on not becoming the next Blockbuster Video, ” said Vistra Chief Executive Curt Morgan. “I’m not going to sit back and watch this legacy business dwindle and not participate.”A decade ago, natural gas displaced coal as America’s top electric-power source, as fracking unlocked cheap quantities of the fuel. Now, in quick succession, natural gas finds itself threatened with the same kind of disruption, only this time from cost-effective batteries charged with wind and solar energy.Natural-gas-fired electricity represented 38% of U.S. generation in 2019, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA, and it supplies round-the-clock electricity as well as bursts during peak demand. Wind and solar generators have gained substantial market share, and as battery costs fall, batteries paired with that green power are beginning to step into those roles by storing inexpensive green energy and discharging it after the sun falls or the wind dies.Battery storage remains less than 1% of America’s electricity market and so far draws power principally from solar generators, whose output is fairly predictable and easier to augment with storage. But the combination of batteries and renewable energy is threatening to upend billions of dollars in natural-gas investments, raising concerns about whether power plants built in the past 10 years—financed with the expectation that they would run for decades—will become “stranded assets,” facilities that retire before they pay for themselves.Across the country, much of the growth in renewable energy to date has been driven by state mandates that have required utilities to procure certain amounts of green power, and by federal tax incentives that have made wind and solar more economically competitive.But renewables have become increasingly cost-competitive without subsidies in recent years, spurring more companies to voluntarily cut carbon emissions by investing in wind and solar power at the expense of that generated from fossil fuels. And the specter of more state and federal regulations to address climate change is accelerating the trend."
"I have followed this stock since early 2015. At my peak I owned 20,000 share. Basically, I acquired the stock because of its dividend, its location and proximity to crude at discount prices and because Carl Ican was the major shareholder and I thought I’d right his coattails. My initial avg. cost was around $13 (started out buying in at 26.50 and average cost down with purchases at $5 per share when the company got hit with the RIN effect. I rode the stock up the the conversion, up to its peak of around $55, all because the RIN exposure was gone and Ican was talking merger or acquisition. Last year I finally sold at around $21 a share as I no longer have/had faith in management. The reality is management has and will never have a strategy to address the RIN exposure. The RIN issue is purely political and no one but the farm belt cares. I wish everyone still hanging on to their investment good luck but I’m done posting, and likely following. Truly disappointed in David Lamps inability to come up with a plan or worse that maybe Ican is vetoing the plans for tax loss utilization purposes."
"Pure Speculation...Icahn’s IEP shares are getting somewhat pressured (he owns over 90%) on the assumption that he’s doing very poorly...meanwhile CVI is tanking for no apparent reason other than Icahn has been rumored that he maybe changing his mind on selling CVI (70+% owner) and UAN (35ish% owner) because he collects the dividends and they have been profitable...Seems like the chairs could be getting rearranged, but again, just speculating..."
"Looking for thoughts on LT viability of a CVI investment. Why would they be buying any refinery now, whether a PADD 4 refinery or merging with DK WHEN we are at the brink of a massive rationalization in the refining space. Who bites the bullet and closes refineries lake MPC did with Gallup and Martinez? In any case, some refinery assets are basically worthless in this environment and there is rapid acceleration of all EV metrics which further exacerbates the problem. I see value at some point and maybe the small independents are the net winners if the Shells, Exxons of the world shutter overcapacity- I guess that's the question I am struggling with and asking for help- what is the LT investment case for CVI? Thanks in advance."
An institution or two has apparently lost faith in the company. Effectively anyone who bought for the great dividend and is still holding has lost the value of the dividend and still owes taxes on the dividend.
Had some extra cash sitting in my account and couldn't resist the CVI sale. Bought 1000 more at $19.50

Biggest head wind for this company is the RIN exposure and managements clear lack of a true plan to address it. Waiting and hoping for the courts to reverse a ruling is not a plan
"I am staying long, but for those thinking about taking some profit, this quarter's results are not so different than the results reported October 24, 2018. I remember delayed price action that may or may not have been caused by external forces. Here are some closing prices retrieved from Yahoo:10/23 38.0410/24 35.61 (earnings released after close.

External marked activity, and the relative price actually was strongest on 10/25 (didn't check this)2. CVI is a bit under the radar of the big money and maybe some investors didn't analyze results quickly (hard to believe)3. Confirmation from competitors' results was needed.4. Larger competitors also with good results drew drew money their direction?5. (Your idea here)Right or wrong, if I was thinking about profit taking, I would probably wait a couple of days."
CVI needs to sell its UAN shares and buy back CVI shares. At these oil prices CVI used to be around $58 per share. They can make HUGE profits by selling UAN shares.
Can someone confirm or correct my understanding about dividend? I believe to get dividend you needed to own CVI shares on or before May 24th and hold on to them until June 10th. The amount of dividend is 492M divided by 100.53M shares outstanding =$4.89 per share.
Read the report on the company that came out today. They estimate the share price should be between 37 and 46 per share. Energy sector decline plus fear of loss of tax wavier contributed to the decline. The company is still extraordinarily well run and we need energy. I for one look at the decline in price as a gift and I am buying more.
"Gang - Here we are, one minute to the deadline to increase tariffs in Chinese goods. Nymex and Rbob are up in overnight trading.I am not for tariffs, but am VERY glad that (for the first time in my life) we have an administration that stands up to the Chicoms' IP and other economic thefts."
Icahn put the company for sale at $55. Now selling for $20 less that 50% discount!! Too risky to be shorting here!!! Anything could happen since he decided to give the $492M to shareholders instead of keeping the cash for the company. Something might be brewing!!

"Dramatic Dividend Increase to entice CVRR holders to Tender their shares, well planned by CVI management. Kudos to them"
"Just reread the conference call script. My take aways (1). $3.00 annual dividend clearly safe for long term. (2) a “special” bump in a quarterly dividend amounts to “share” special gains from events more likely than not. Idea being to share gains with shareholders. My final thought, as the company continues to improve its manufacturing efficiencies and become the niche Permian basis refiner, thereby enhancing its acquisition value, the company intends to spin its excess cash back to shareholders. I read very little negative in the call yesterday, in fact, i found it interesting and full of optimism."

What im wondering is where is DK share price going? Will us CVI shareholders get interested in DK once we own shares in it and add more shares or will we see DK shares as as a windfall and sell to get the cash? Or simply hold on to new DK shares?
Accumulating
"I wouldn’t be surprised if we see an announcement of Management changes. Based on public information, key decisions of current management team have proved to be less than beneficial to shareholders. Biodiesel investment on hold, Delek attempted acquisition merger died, RIN solution actions merely crying into a towel. Ican used to be a wizard, now we have Hertz and CVI. Ouch."

not worried 30 before end of year
Time for serious share price correction upward! CVI is significantly undervalued. I'm sure I'll look back at this year and wish I had bought more while the price was so low.
Jesus Christ
On 2/17 CVI will report earnings. I think it will be better than last quarter. I don’t think dividends will resume after first quarter of 2021. I do hope stock price will go back to $40.
"NICE!A new study found that technological advancements and the cost of batteries could support all vehicles being sold in the United States to be electric-powered by 2035.Currently, only 1.8 percent of people in the U.S. have electric vehicles, with cost being a major factor, as well as the availability of charging ports. However, the study states the initial cost of electric vehicles should be on par with gasoline vehicles in approximately five years.study’s estimates, this will be driven by a drop in the cost of batteries and advancements in efficiency. In relation to the availability and cost of charging ports, it found that “the plummeting cost of wind and solar power have enabled a rapid and cost-effective expansion of a clean electricity grid, a cost-effective pathway” to expanding and establishing a public network of said stations.“The upfront price of electric vehicles is coming down rapidly, which is very exciting.

Stock price will continue to lag until the RIN exposure is totally addressed and the company can reinstate a solid quarterly dividend. The last earnings call suggested to me that either management is totally frustrated and severely limited in its ability to effectively address the RIN matter OR that it has a plan it’s about ready to execute and did not want to tip it’s had just yet. Hoping it’s the later.
@Lucifer...Icahn’s base cost for CVI is $15.67 according to a recent article by John Vincent who follows IEP...believe you inquired about that a while back...
I’m actually excited about the reduction in dividend! That gives them some extra powder to buy and expand. Never thought this would be a growth opportunity but glad they are taking it. Reward for the long term investment.
Dk shares deposited to my account this AM. Nice. But no cash yet. fyi
"Interesting observation. I bought in at $21 after announcement of dividend was made. Dividend is touted as a 20% distribution but with stock dropping to $19, I’ve effectively lost $2. Or nearly all the cash portion of the distribution. Question to myself is how long will it take for share price to rebound to $21 or above per share? Or else all I got out of this were shares of DK which will trigger tax effects when I dump."

"In the immortal words of the Boy Wonder, Luis P, from four days ago: ""800 shares still short and just waiting for huge dividend cut."" You preached to the choir a few weeks ago about the short. What did you say your short position was at? $34.00? Well, lets see...last week after earnings it went up four dollars in one session...over 10% at one point if my memory is correct. Than, your own panic set in early on Friday and you claimed that there was a sell off or some nonsense about bag holders. It went up four bucks at the close on Thursday. By close of business Friday, it sold off a whopping 19 cents. Has anyone ever seen an investor with worse timing than Luis P ? I hesitate to even mention the I - word in association with him. He's clearly the worst stock investor I've ever seen.I'm looking at the close on Friday and I see $45.63. How do you feel about that Boy Wonder? What's that brown spot on your tights, Old Chum? And oh yeah, that .75 cent dividend that you claimed would get cut to .50 or zero? Well, you called that one wrong too. Nostradamus, you are not. Nostradumbass? Yeah, I think that probably fits better. This is the same guy that held on to CVRR to the bitter end, only to get forced out by Carl and his band of brothers at a whopping $10.50 a share. He could have taken the Exchange Offer like the rest of us. Heck, he could have even sold his shares north of $15 to $20 since there were months to do it. Nope...he kept his shares and was forced to fork them over for $10.50 a share. Carl, the CVI board, and shareholders like myself want to extend our thanks to you Luis P. Paying you a robust $10.50 a share to get rid of you and your brethren helped our bottom line. For this, we do thank you for your contribution!A word of advise for anyone new to the board. Do yourself a favor and just put Bozo the Clown on ignore. He's never been right about anything when it comes to this oil refinery. The only thing he's good at is losing money. Of course, if you enjoy losing money, go ahead and follow his lead. Don't say we didn't warn you. In baseball, its three strikes and you are out. For Luis P, strike one was the $10.50 a share debacle. Strike two is that infamous short position. Strike three is his call on the dividend cut . In baseball, you get designated for assignment if you get cut from the team and they can't or refuse to send you to the minor leagues. Luis P is most definitely associated with that term, designated for assignment. Time for the Boy Wonder to fly down the bat pole and say goodbye."
wow we might see 30 before earnings!!!
"It's hard to see a bright future for oil refineries in the USA. Renewable fuel and EV use is now the official policy of the government, and industry seems on board with it."

"How much of the UAN (the master limited partner) does CVI own..If substantial, then CVI is looking good with UAN, in the nitrogen fertilizer business, a part of its major holdings"
Hey how come I didn't get my $1.72 cash Distribution on the 23rd of August?
I told you about ALTM. I actually bought for the yield as much as the return earlier this year at $53.Today it sits at $76.
"You are on a roll, RV, posting 15 times in the first 2 hours of trading today, and arguing with others all weekend on the $CVI, $PACB, $GLP, and $EDIT boards. Why you so sensitive?"
I believe the BOD of CVI knew that the share price would go down before they issued no dividends for this quarter and the next quarter also. The CVI is down again today is not a surprise. Millions barrels of oil Icahn got at negative price have done nothing for this company??
"So today we end the week with a powerful move upward in our share price on top of the significant gains we have enjoyed this week. We're about 3 weeks away from our third quarter earnings and I anticipate a very good report on the strength of the oil and fertilizer markets in Q3. I was pleased that Mr. Lamp decided to delay the upgrades at UAN until next year to capture the strong profits in the fertilizer sector. I know there are differing opinions regarding Mr. Lamp's performance but I, for one, think he has done a great job of navigating our ship through the difficult times of the last two years and I am hopeful that he will stay on for another term when his contract expires this December. In light of the strong markets in crude, refined products and fertilizer in Q3 I am feeling more optimistic that we will see a return of our dividends in the .40-.50 range this quarter. I know that RIN prices and requirements have been a thorn in CVI's side recently, along with volatile oil markets and demand issues but I believe the oil markets are and will continue to enjoy a much better environment in the upcoming months and the RIN issue will soon be clarified if the EPA can set aside their political bias and actually make a decision. That event alone should be very beneficial to keeping a lid on our gas prices and restore CVI's share price to pre-Covid levels. I find it obscene that CVI is trading below $20.00 with $90.00 crude prices.Hope you all have taken some positions at some great prices in the oil patch to enjoy future gains that are sure to come in our ""transitory"" inflationary environment. I finished building my position in EPD last month so its back to the drawing board to identify my next target. Currently considering MPLX,BPMP, MMP or OMP... Thoughts?? Cheers!"
"Just as what happened in the last four trading days, volume picked up substantially in the last 15 minutes along with our share price. In those last 15 minutes today over 220k shares traded which was about 25% of daily volume. Someone is accumulating CVI shares."
why the big decline today

Was researching the 3:2:1 crack spreads for refiners and it is now at around $21. This compares to around $10 in 2020. This suggests a strong qtr. ended June and likely Sept. for all refineries given cost reduction programs previously put in place. Wouldn’t surprise me if dividend reinstated at 6/30 for both CVI and DK. (This is in spite of RIN exposure)
As soon as they get the cost of #RIN down then there will be dividends again. It won’t be long now it will be back $60./shares. Carl Icahn has 71 millions shares. Maybe he will sell CVI.
"Democrats want to fund the national build-out of electric charging stations for vehicles. Multi-Trillions of taxpayer dollars being thrown around like there's no tomorrow.I can't wait until they tell you it costs $100-200 per ""fill up"" at the ""electric pump""."
"Perhaps I'm wrong, its possible...but, somehow I don't believe that CVI has received the 37 Millions units they were hoping would be tendered to them....if they had, where is the announcement,,,why the delay? JMHO"
"I have witness every market crash in the past 50 years, each time, the market has come back stronger. I expect we will all recover from this one as well. Yes there will be great pain and suffering in the oil patch as the world sorts out the survivors (there will be NO winner) in the oil patch just survivors. Refineries should do fine provided they were properly hedged relative to oil purchase agreements sine a refinery is merely a value added process. I suspect when the dust settles and the Coronavirus scare is behind us, Americans will come out of there houses and rev up the cars for summer vacations. Planes will suffer as pocket books will be filled with coins and less paper. Hang tight, and unless you feel that you are the Houdini of stock picking, simply hold and wait er out"
"Over the years this board has been great sharing thoughts and ideas about CVI. Now it seems to be focused elsewhere on things not relevant to CVI. For example, the company is making a huge investment and leap into Diesel. I like that decision. I am also of the opinion that while GM has said it will focus on electric vehicles, hoping by 2135 to be largely electric, I personally think that the conversion to electric is a long long way further in the future given the constraints etc. the largest being the time it takes to charge up a battery. Right now, the avg life of a car on the road is 11 years. This would suggest that there are at least 175 million gas powered vehicles on the road, and this doesn’t count diesel driven trucks. So while the wheel is turning there is a future for the refinery industry."
Gotta love the Supreme Court. gave us some relief on RIN issues.
They are giving a $492.000.000 million dollar dividend and stock down!!! The company is strong and doing great!!
Brutally oversold
Upgraded by Goldman (PT $47) due to exposure to mid continent refining fundamentals
"I was a little surprised yesterday that we and other refining companies seemed immune from the market's overall downward move.I did not realize that yesterday morning in El Dorado, KS the HollyFrontier plant had a section blow up. Happily nobody was killed and I believe there were no serious injuries. This event (though we never wish for a fire to happen at a competitor) naturally can provide upward pressure on peer stocks.Unfortunately explosions do happen in this business, and it can be a good hedge to own more than one refinery stock; the resulting upset in the product flows can shift the retail market enough that the smoothly running plants see a boost in profit."
So the wild card here is if Carl sells this dog. Can he get at least $45/share for this company? They have done a lot of upgrades to the refineries. The stock is supposedly 37% undervalued.
"When looking at the CVI website, they own a little less than 40% of UAN, a master limited partnership (MLP). They also state that they are the general partner to this MLP. Does anyone know how financially CVI will benefit from UAN considering that nitrogen type fertilizers are on the rise? I assume it will have a positive effect...but to what degree?"
Thanks for the drop
"Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. refiners are expected to show higher earnings for the third quarter as margins to sell gasoline and diesel have improved despite the surging cost of crude oil, analysts said.After more than a year of depressed fuel demand, gasoline and distillate consumption is back in line with five-year averages in the United States, the world's largest fuel consumer. That has boosted margins on refined products to more than double what those companies were making at this time a year ago.The seven largest independent U.S. refining companies, including giants Marathon Petroleum (MPC.N) and Valero Energy (VLO.N), are projected to post an average earnings-per-share gain of 66 cents, versus a loss of $1.32 for the third quarter of 2020, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (GRAPHIC: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-REFINERIES/EARNINGS-OUTLOOK/mopanjqyzva/)Those gains are driven by the 3-2-1 crack spread, a proxy for refining margins, which assumes a barrel of crude oil is refined to three parts gasoline, two parts diesel and one part jet fuel. That spread is currently at $21 per barrel, compared with around $9 a year ago.Energy demand has recovered swiftly from the worst days of the pandemic in 2020, and Brent and U.S. crude oil prices have reached multi-year highs in recent days. But product demand has also increased, and that has helped boost margins.Product supplied - a proxy for U.S. refined product demand - was 21.5 million barrels per day in the most recent week, slightly higher than the same period in 2019, prior to the onset of the pandemic, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).""The market is getting back in equilibrium,"" Credit Suisse analyst Manav Gupta said in a note.Refiners are also benefiting from lower inventories of their products as recent storms and the pandemic knocked refining capacity offline. Approximately 2.5 million barrels per day of refining capacity has been shut since the start of the pandemic, which is almost four times the 10-year average, according to Credit Suisse's Gupta.Delta Air Lines' refinery in Monroe, Pennsylvania, earned nearly $100 million last quarter, its first positive results since the first quarter of 2020, according to figures released last week. Tudor Pickering Holt analysts cited strong gasoline and diesel crack spreads as helping the refiner recover.Jet fuel demand is still below pre-pandemic levels, but international flights are expected to resume to Europe in November. The spot price of U.S. Gulf Coast kerosene-type jet fuel is $2.10 dollars per gallon, the highest since October 2018, despite demand still 12% below 2018 levels, per EIA data.Analysts have also been raising estimates for refiners such as PBF Energy and Hollyfrontier due to declining costs of complying with the nation's biofuels laws. Refiners are required to blend ethanol into the nation's gasoline pool or buy credits for others who can.The cost of those credits declined sharply in the third quarter. Reuters reported in September that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to recommend reducing federal biofuel blending mandates for 2021 to below 2020 levels, according to analysts."
"Trump to deny pending retroactive biofuel waivers - ReutersSep. 9, 2020 12:59 PM ET|About: Valero Energy Corporation (VLO)|By: Carl Surran, SA News Editor Pres. Trump has ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to deny dozens of requests from oil refineries for retroactive waivers from U.S. biofuel laws, amid worries that the issue could cut into his Farm Belt support in the upcoming election, Reuters reports.The decision would mark the end of an attempt by the U.S. refining industry to comply with a January court ruling that said the Trump administration should not have issued some waivers in previous years.The Trump administration has quadrupled the number of exemptions given to refiners, causing outrage in farm states such as Iowa; biofuel advocates say the waivers hurt demand for corn-based ethanol, while the oil industry criticizes the costs of the obligations.Potentially relevant tickers include VLO, MPC, PSX, PBF, HFC, CVI, ADM, GPRE, GPP, PEIX, REGI, REX, ANDE"

Biden may cancel Keystone pipeline permit on first day. So much for support for the oil and gas industry. Makes one wonder what drives the American voter. 8 years of anti-oil followed by 4 years of pro-oil immediately reversed by another U-turn. Going in circles are we ? Even California oil/environment experts agree that the oil sent to the US refineries by the Keystone pipeline can be cleaned up sufficiently to meet current standards.
"The refining subsector is getting clobbered today, and CVI is right in there getting beaten up too; Is this an opportunity?The market did not seem to warmly embrace the raising of $1B. Different people can offer their philosophies about company debt (I hate debt), BUT money even at corp bond rates is very cheap right now. Half the money going to retiring costlier near term debt is good by any reasonable person's standards. People can argue about the intent for the balance.I PERCEIVE that CVI has a habit of responding well to earnings reports and earnings calls, and have no reason to expect otherwise for the upcoming report. The market seems to forget about our favorable path a while after the report, and I expect that is happening to us right now.Without ignoring the challenging nature of the refining biz, I am treating this price action as an opportunity to add to my already excessive position; hopefully will buy another 500 to 1000 shares this week."
Buying today
"Changes at the top. CFO and CAO both resigned this past August. This quarterly earnings release will likely be interesting. The stock price is strengthening along with the increase in oil prices.

"OMG! I have been away for a while and there are STILL people here grouching because they are upset about not taking the exchange offer!At least for a while, there appears to be no danger of reducing our bloated dividend. This company does well in rising volatile oil markets, and I am happily staying long."
"The court case is clearly a negative issue, as are the biofuel waivers and overall weakness in the sector. The price has plummeted 30% in the past 6 months. A buyout appears completely off the table. Hardly something to applaud. Is a dividend cut next? Any positive trends?"
