"Earnings report looks quite good at first glance. But that does not mean this Bloated Baby is going to go up today. We must factor in valuation, market uncertainty for the future, profit-taking by shareholders, etc... I will be holding all my Short shares until at least early afternoon to see how this plays out."

"This stock is poised to pop up on a good earnings report. Currently it is undervalued and flying under the radar of investors and traders. Retail is hot, clothing is hot, consumer cyclicals are hot, and GIII is both a wholesaler and a retailer. They design, manufacture, and also directly sell through retail stores, a whole bunch of different types of clothing. Granted, their execution has not been great, management of the company might not be as good as it should be...but they are in an excellent position to beat on EPS and Revenue, and get a significant pop up from the abnormally depressed level she is at right now. I'm in with 2000 shares and feeling very bullish. I might get out briefly to do an earlier earnings play on CRM, but even if so, I plan to get back into GIII in a big way, on Tuesday, before the earnings release in the pre-market on Wednesday."

"Really, so so oversold Mucho upside to go"
"The hardest time period to find good Pure Earnings Short Sell plays is definitely AH Friday/PM Monday. This is because no companies ever report after market close Friday, and the pickings are often very slim for Monday PM. In such cases I simply skip this day and make my next play for the Monday AH/Tuesday PM time period. But this week I got lucky, because GIII reports PM on Monday and she definitely does qualify as my next Pure Earnings Short Sell Play of the Day. Later today I will be Covering my WORK Short Sell, I still think WORK will go down during the regular session today, and will throw all my money into a Short of GIII. Why?? Because GIII has at least a 75% of dropping significantly in price on Monday, directly in response to her earnings release. Let's look at the reasons why:1: GIII is significantly over-valued. 2: Stock is close to her 52 week high. 3: This sector is over-heated and due for a general pullback. How much clothing does a person need, anyway?? :-) 4: Charts indicate a Bearish short and medium-term bias for the stock. 5: Analysts are extremely lukewarm on GIII. The AVERAGE price target TWELVE months out is only $32.33. GIII closed yesterday at $32.14. Can anybody say: ZERO upside potential?? :-) 6: A comprehensive financial analysis shows the company is simply average in its sector, with a bloated P/E Ratio. No reason for this to go up even if they beat EPS and Revenue consensus estimates. 7: GIII has MISSED on either EPS or REvenue consensus estimates EIGHT out of the past NINE quarters! Do your own research if you don't believe me, but it is a fact: 8 out of the past 9 quarters, they failed to meet consensus estimates on at least one of these two vital measures. To be honest, many of these misses were small. But, a miss is a miss, and I think given her valuation and current market sentiment, the chances of GIII going up in price if they miss consensus estimates on Monday, are VERY slim. For all these reasons and more, I will be eagerly throwing a lot of money into a Short Sell of GIII this afternoon, to hold through earnings release on Monday. Good Luck Folks!"
Buy as much as you can below $34. In 6 months this will be above $42 again. Expectations are too low now and their brands are performing better now than the past few quarters.

Out now quickly️...... tomorrow all LAVA will come-out.
Funny retail sector is up with every earnings release. Bubble is forming and this one time stimulus will fade away. Back to 20s soon.
"The June 4th quarterly report is going to be bad but it is expected with the COVID19 shut down. This clothing and accessories maker is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -304%.Revenues are expected to be $446.60 million, down 29.5% from the year-ago quarter.I just hope the stock won’t take a huge hit right before and right after the reporting. It will rebound if it does take a hit. GLTA"
looking at the financials looking good need to read sec fillings but definitely manageable debt

"Just went long 2000 shares of GIII at $29.45. This is an Earnings play, GIII reports earnings next Wednesday, before the regular market session. I am expecting both EPS and Revenue beats, to drive this stock up to the $32.00+ level. This sector, Consumer Cyclical, is performing exceptionally well this earnings season, with clothing doing the best. This stock is undervalued from a technical analysis perspective. It has beaten it's EPS consensus estimates for the past four quarters. Stock is cheap because it got downgraded two months ago over ""tariff concerns"". Overblown worry, IMO. This baby should trend up over the next few days, heading into earnings release, and then go even higher IF, as I expect, the Earnings Report is very good. Do your own Due Diligence because I am NOT always right. :-)"

Bought 600 shares at $9.70 a share today after reviewing GIII's financial numbers. I am very hopeful that this company will come out of this COVID19 stuff like gangbusters. We should see teens if not 20s soon our country is opening back up for business.
What's the expectation for tomorrow?
GIII is down 11.85% to 9.30
"So, a lot of states are opening up their economies today with more coming soon.

"Still Short all of my GIII shares, and it looks like I will be taking a huge loss on this trade in just an hour or so. Around $12k in hard cash lost, unless the stock turns south very soon and very hard. But in order to be successful with this trading style, I MUST take the loss and move on. No holding, no waiting, no ""maybe it will turn tomorrow. Nope, you just take the loss and move on, knowing that EVERY play gives you a very real chance to make a huge profit and regain everything you lost on the last one, and more. So, if you are the kind of person who cannot stomach huge losses of hard capital in single day trades, then this trading style is not suitable for you. :-)"

Okay folks. Lots of states are opening up and sports will follow suit. Get ready to go on a GREEN ride with this stock. It has been down due to our country on lockdown but now that we will come out of it this is a stock to ride. It will not make you rich overnight like those pump and dump stocks. This one is legit and it will make you steady money IMHO.

"With over 800 million of cash on hand and no long term debt, this company will come out of this COVID-19 lockdown like a rocket blasting off at Cape Canaveral! We will see it jump to mid-teens overnight, IMHO. I am buying more."
I bet this is going to pop up to 13 or 14 pretty soon
"So, the NFL will release their 2020 schedule and plans for this season tomorrow so this stock will go back up and hopefully remain green for a while after."
"Almost time for the regular session to begin. GIII has traded consistently up throughout the pre-market session, after delivering a better than expected earnings report. But, the regular session is when things can change dramatically. We have a lot more traders and investors in the mix, with profit-taking a major factor usually not present in the pre-market. Patience is key to being successful as a Pure Earnings Short Seller. I prefer to risk a 12% loss in a few hours, instead of taking a 7-8% loss right now, because I KNOW from past experience that this can still turn completely around and go Red for the day over the next few hours."

"Rise and Shine, folks! It's time for another exciting week for Shorty as we continue playing the Pure Earnings Short Sell game with lots of $$$ on the line. Right now I am pleased as punch to be Short a lot of shares of GIII at an average price of $31.59. This Bloated Baby reports earnings in just a few minutes, report should be out at 7 AM ET, followed by a Conference Call starting at 8:30 ET. I am expecting a sell-off based on investor and trader disappointment in the results, and uncertainty going forward. Looks like Irrational Exuberance is winning out before this earnings release, as I see the last trade for GIII was $35.03 in the very early pre-market! Leaked great ER news??? I think not. Just a poorly educated trader buying into some hype that this will soar today. Not gonna happen, IMO. But we shall see. Regardless, I will Cover GIII later today and immediately throw all my money into.....either HQY or MTN. It's a close race here, so I want to see how these two stocks trade early today, before I make a final decision. I would say MTN is slightly more risky, but brings with her much more downside potential, while HQY is safer in that the chances she goes down in direct response to her ER are slightly higher, but the odds of a big dip of 8+% are smaller than is the case with MTN. Good Luck Folks! :-)"
