"I've traded RARE many times.I'm not in the shares at present.Yes, I'm aware of the pasting the shares are taking.My thoughts?Very tough decision to make, one way or the other.I wouldn't rule it out, it depends on what comes up.For example, if analysts started coming up with:RARE very compelling at these levels,that would serve as an incentive.From mid80's to current level, that's tough to endure.nt"
