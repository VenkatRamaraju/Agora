"Since last November when this bull market began, BAC has almost doubled! So, it is understandable that investors would take some of their massive profits off the table, hence the sell-off today!"
"Stocks are up , job growth is up , home prices are up and were out of Afghanistan in 7 months .This what happens when you are not golfing all the time !"
"Interesting...Master took the better part of an hour to walk the bid back down to ~$42.12 and then, in under 3 minutes time, bid $42.26. Makes you wonder don't it? Somebody running a game on a (so far) heavy volume day..."
"Is it possible, BAC up 3 straight mornings?"
Higher highs and higher lows just what you want to see . A grind to $48 to $52 this year .
"Even though Big Money's Passive Dream and Techitch1 names are funny, the IVR stock recommendation is a disaster. Today, IVR is down 1.2% while BAC is only down 0.2% as I post.So I recommend that Passive Dream uses his Big Money and Techitch1 names to post funny cartoons and stuff, and not recommend stocks!"
$41 todays resistance line?
"All selling, and at a +200K per minute clip, with the bell. Clearly PM was a head-fake. Let's see how it plays out. Bid $42.15..."
Into the final 30.....bid at $42.04....all the buy/sell on close orders being queued up for the last few minutes of the session. Wonder which way it'll go?
"Bid rolled at $42.84 and it's been all selling in the usual machine pattern since then. As usual they're going for overshooting....bid now .25. They might try to break $42....again...and since I'm riding a short with trailing I'm fine with it. Once the trailing gets hit I'll flip to a buy....just bird-in-hand trading, playing off the algo's and machine pattern...G/L!"
"02:31 PM EDT, 08/16/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Bank of America (BAC) on Monday said July credit card delinquency rate was 0.92%, compared with 0.97% in the previous month.

"7 months into Bidoom. Remember when William said at least a thousand times that the first year market gains belonged to the previous President. Enjoy DJTs market, and clear out at the end of the year. Cheers William."
It's going to be an interesting day. Fed speak at 10:00 and 63% of all 10 yr options are expiring toady. Expect a lot of movement in the 10 yr. Read last night the market anticipates a move toward 1.15% or 1.50%. GLTA!
"With Jerome having done yet one more session of jaw-boning, and actually doing nada, I expect the market will react negatively where this sector is concerned. At least...for now. Which is kind'a sort'a what you're seeing what with Master walking the Pooch southward....no signs of a rate increase kind'a deflate any bullish balloons don't it?"
Long and Shorts. . Liberals and Conservatives. Getting along together. . Let’s get our troops back home safely this week.
The IVR with over 11% and costs only $3.12 shows alot hope than bac or any other ;)
"Big Joe is in charge! and so is his 2021 bull market! It is record-breaking, and life-changing! If you sold last year, then you're missing all the upside action! BAC futures up, just like most stocks!"
