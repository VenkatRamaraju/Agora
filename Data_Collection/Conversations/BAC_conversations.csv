Wells Fargo raised the price target on BAC from $55 to $60.
10/25/21Wells Fargo & Company Reiterated Bank of America Corporation (BAC) $55.00 ➝ $60.00 Overweight
PE expansion? BAC to earn $3.3 this year (most likely $3.50) current PE is 15 that gets BAC to $49.50. Next year BAC is expected to earn $3.60 get you $54. We're approaching fair value UNLESS the PE expands. Mike Mayo suggested it should. GLTA!

"Thoughts on the 10yr. Downside risk appears to be to the ~$1.55 area, about 10basis below where it is right now. Resistance is at ~$1.68 to $1.72. If inflation ain't transitory as some are thinking then it's gonna be very interesting where things might go over the next few months. So keep your eye on the 10yr...if it breaks resistance.....well....leaving aside the negative impact to the economy in general it means good things for this sector, rate-wise. G/L!"
Mike Mayo Wells Fargo raises BAC to $60.00 and raises JPM to $210.00 . I can see BAC being $54 by Christmas . BAC earnings really accelerate with any increase in rates .
"Wow, what a week of splendid gains for BAC, and what a great 2021 for awesome stock gains for the market! Hopefully, you are all participating in solid values like BAC, and not crying from the sidelines!"
"Can we talk on topic for a sec? Not about BAC specifically, but about the sector? Okay, let's. It's about an action being seen by the banks.The banks are stepping in and buying Treasury's. They were doing this on Friday. This seems nonsensical, kind'a sort'a like cutting off your nose to spite your face. Why do I say this? Well, if you use the logic that the higher rates go the better it is for the banks. then the banks stepping in like they did yesterday, and which they have been doing for some time, is that very nose cutting exercise because it drives rates down, not up. If you believe higher rates = good then this has you scratching yer noggin' don't it?But consider it from the banks perspective. Perhaps they don't actually make all that much from the interest off the loans they proffer to their customer base. Not overall they don't. They usually package and sell of those loans in any case. That said consider where they DO make their main coin in these loans; and that's in the FEES they charge for the loan business. Get it? In that case they want to drive business volume don't they? In fact they really don't care if rates are higher or lower; that's not the point is it? The key is higher VOLUMES in activity. How to do this? Lower rates. Just tossing this out to those who might find it interesting..."
BAC looks like it is about to drop. Be careful guys. I have been reading http://the-alphatrader.com/ and their stocks have been doing way better.
"William , Look's Like We Are Starting To Get Close To , $48.00 , GLTA ,"
Coming up on the final two hours of the session. Typically the bid will start to move in the direction the machines want to end it. Bid now $47.70. Interesting pivot area....it could easily head back to a close around the .50 line as it could go back up to the intraday high at $48. Which way I wonder? How lucky are you feeling?
"Fifty-five of the nation’s largest corporations paid no federal income tax on more than $40 billion in profits last year.In fact, they received a combined federal rebate of more than $3 billion, for an effective tax rate of about negative 9 percent. See they pay taxes just like the rest of us ?"
"TAX my Unrealized Capital Gains? Send the whole Demo party Packing. It will be for the Wealthy at first, then later YOU will be considered wealthy as they lower the tax brackets.. Don't forget about the now $3.60/gallon gas either. Just more cash to be given away."
"William , Here We Go Again , BAC , Has A Great CEO , And A Great Staff Of People , And It Look's Like , $48.50 , GLTA ,"
"Ding ding DING! Bid $47.72. All forgiven from yesterday you think? Yeah...maybe...but stay frosty...the sell side hasn't taken ""the court"" yet....let's see what happens once they show up...G/L!"
"Out earlier this AM. It may have been noted by I've so many muted I didn't see it posted. So, Deutsche Bank adjusts Bank of America PT to $51 from $44. Maintains Buy Rating."
"make no sense for all the banks dropping today... the inflation high... with all the personal loan, business loan, banks would make more money"
"To those that claim BAC is overvalued, please explain.BAC at $48, forward PE is 14.1. How is that overvalued?PE on tech stocks that haven't earned a penny yet are 200+ and the average S&P500 PE is 28.67, twice that of BAC. BAC has a rock solid business plan and profits are expanding. Earnings are extremely predictable. So how on earth can you claim BAC is overvalued?"
"Since late October 2020, BAC has almost doubled! Fantastic performance in only one year. Sure, the previous 4 years were great times for the short sellers, but those days are gone! Congratulations to all BAC stockholders!"
"A great week for the buy side, but an odd place to place the bid at end of options exp Friday session. ~$47.79 printed at 16:00:00. In terms of options and where you'd expect the bid to be taken that's a weird place to end it. But like I said...a great week sooo....now on to the weekend. And hey, Richard!! Did you hold or fold?"
