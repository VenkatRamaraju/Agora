"Speaking of inflation anyone else noticing? I bought a slab of meat, london broil, from my local grocery mart. What did that slab of meat, ~2.7lbs of dead animal, set me back? +$22. Yep....over Twenty Two dollars. For a slab of animal carcass. I'd go vegan but everywhere I look dam near everything is thru that same roof. And some of it is more subtle...you pay the same, but get less. Check the number of oz's on your can of tuna and such. But there's no inflation is there? Nah....transitory. This coming from the mouths of our pampered, privileged, leadership caste who probably send others out to buy their groceries....or maybe they use delivery services? Transitory, folks....trust 'em....it's all transitory..."
I'm making a ton of money shorting BAC and buying AMC
will it go meme?
An auto stock can have PE of 400.. Why high tech bank like BAC can't have PE of 30?Just saying.

"Bid $44.84. I know that's a nice number but come on everybody! Let's get out and push this bus over the $45 for WhoGus, country and PROFIT!"
Here we go....bell lap...final hour...and bid just got yanked to $44.07. Anyone want to bet that the session ends with the bid at $44 or there'bouts? It's pretty obvious that's where the machines are going...at the least. But let's see...bid just hit .04
Earnings report expected to be phenomenal. The market maker cheaters and big banks like #BAC can no longer hide. Margin calls happening. Dark pool trades being shut down. The window of opportunity to buy $AMC this low is closing. Congrats to all holding and buying more!Amc is the $hood
It is my mom's birthday today. Buying her 1000 shares $AMC as it is Kenny G's birthday too. What a perfect gift for both! $bac
That's odd my near term target price for BAC is $41 based on a P/E of 12.
Heck a 3.25 % 10yr would put this in the $80s . BAC has the most to gain of any financial institution as interest rates begin to normalize . They also are the most advanced into the new digital economy of the money center banks . Moynihan has built a power house for the new digital economy .
Why all the bank stock is getting hammered?$WFC $C $JPM $BAC
"For the long term, there's still a lot more this can go. At $39B it can easily be scooped up by a $V Visa which has a $500B market cap, or $MA with a $330B market cap, or $PYPL $JPM $BAC $AXP. Affirm is disrupting the space, and adding so much value. Consumer spending are reaching records - look at bank earnings this AM, and Ecommerce continues to accelerate, making this a no brainer for the long run."
$368 BILLION market Cap today. 73% held by institutions.Boomer stock??? I don't think so.

"At this point in the session it looks like JPM got no bounce off the pounding it took after earnings and session start. And their earnings were pretty good, too. So while I wouldn't go out on any short side limbs I don't think I'd recommend holding any buy side positions in this thing into earnings. The pooch is liable to experience the same thing....better to wait on post-earnings clarity. This ain't investment advice. Just sayin'. G/L! Bid $43.06."
"Buying into crypto ASAP, especially Ethereum, is probably a good way for BoA to avoid going bankrupt because of their heavy shorting of AMC... They are listed as having a 75% chance of bankruptcy.... When the Squeeze happens at AMC (and rest assured, it is gonna happen), their stock (BAC) is gonna CRASH......"
1.5 hrs left…time for one more small run to 45.10?
Diversified 8001 shares AMC 200 shares short of BAC I will cover at 5
"Another new high coming today?? Very strong yesterday, DOW was down 500 and BAC was up all day!"
You know BAC is a great buy when it reports earnings and it actually trades up lol.
I'm stilling gunning for 0.81 EPS. Any other guesses?

"Here is a little earnings education for our basher friends. The EPS (earnings per share) is expected to be -.08 compared to -8.41 last year or -.79 the previous quarter this year. That is huge! That is a great earnings report, due to increased revenue. This will drive FOMO buying naturally even without the pending squeeze.AMC is the $hood $bac"
My AMC short is working out well...making lots of money to reinvest in BAC
Closed my buy side trades at $46.25 and flipped into a short using the logic of too far too fast. Just bird-in-hand trading....bid $46.03 and trailing down...once it gets hit I'll flip back into another buy side position. G/L!
"Take on the day: BAC bought back 250,000,000 shares of stock in the Qtr. That's $210,000,000 in dividends that won't be paid. Almost$.03/share."

Like I said they higher it hits greens fake the more attractive Puts become and now look BAC made huge room for next big drops. ;)
"New 52 week high gets hit and then the sell side come out and start running their downside game. It's been a patient, consistent, walk-back from that earlier high line. Bid now $44.43. They're still doing the Texas Two Step ain't they? Two forward, one back, spank your partners patootie and repeat."

"interest on the rise soon, banks benefit"
Volume heavy. So far a new 52wk high at $44.91 has been hit. We'll have to see how it closes...see if the bus gets pushed over $45...but so far...well..what's not to like if you're on the buy side of the table? G/L in the final half hour...

"10/14/2021 - 12:26:00 - Bank of America Corp. said Thursday that third-quarter profit rose 58%, suggesting banks' lending businesses are starting to improve from a pandemic slump.The bank released $1.1 billion of the reserves it had set aside for pandemic loan defaults, helping boost its profit. Revenue was up 12% from the year-ago period.Bank profits soared in the latest quarter in large part because the U.S. economy bounced back so quickly from the pandemic recession. Banks last year set aside billions of dollars to prepare for a wave of loan defaults, but now they are releasing the money they had socked away. That helped power double-digit earnings gains at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. Equities trading and a deal-making boom also pushed up earnings.Much of the country's economic activity flows through Bank of America and its peers, offering a real-time view of how consumers and businesses are recovering from the pandemic. Despite an improving economy, banks have had difficulty growing their loan books this year. Total loans outstanding were down from a year ago at Bank of America and Wells Fargo , and flat at Citigroup.Still, bank executives said they see signs that consumers and businesses have an increasing appetite for debt. Bank of America said its consumer and small-business customers were spending at well ahead of pre-pandemic levels.The bank's outstanding loans and leases totaled $927.74 billion at the end of the third quarter, up slightly from the second quarter but down 3% from a year earlier. If not for the runoff in government Paycheck Protection Program loans, the bank's loan book would have grown almost 2% from the second quarter.Commercial lending inside the U.S. and abroad ticked up from a year ago. Additionally, more people borrowed against their stock portfolios. Securities-based loans to wealth-management clients jumped by about one-quarter over the past year.The bank benefited from a rebound in net interest income, which includes the money it makes on loans and holdings of debt instruments such as mortgage-backed securities. Net interest income rose 10% from a year earlier to $11.1 billion .""We're anticipating more loan growth across all of our products,"" Paul Donofrio , the bank's exiting chief financial officer, said on a call with reporters Thursday. Bank of America's noninterest income, which includes fees, rose 14% from a year earlier to $11.67 billion . A boom in mergers and acquisitions helped lift investment-banking fees across the industry. Advisory fees more than tripled at Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, and more than doubled at JPMorgan. They rose 65% at Bank of America .The bank's investment bank has often trailed peers, but Mr. Donofrio said that the pipeline of deals remained robust going into the fourth quarter. Equities-trading revenue rose almost across the board at the banks, but fixed-income trading slowed. JPMorgan and Citigroup both reported a 5% drop in overall trading revenue; Morgan Stanley reported a 6% increase.At Bank of America , total adjusted trading revenue was $3.63 billion , up 9% from a year earlier. Overall, the second-largest U.S. bank earned $7.69 billion , up from $4.88 billion in the same period a year earlier. Per-share earnings of 85 cents topped the 71 cents that analysts polled by FactSet had expected.Revenue totaled $22.77 billion , up 12% from $20.34 billion a year ago. That beat analysts' expectations for revenue of $21.68 billion . Analysts and investors also have been keeping a close eye on expenses, which rose in recent quarters. Noninterest expenses were roughly flat from a year earlier at $14.44 billion ."
"Who were the goofballs who claimed that BAC always drops on earnings day? I think one of those so-called goofballs might have been the funny bigmoney fellow. Of course, he was joking around, just like always!Instead of going down on earnings day, BAC is rallying strongly! Awesome!"

What I look for is the machines to walk the bid back to the ~$44 line into the final minutes....and probably close it around that line...why? Because they can? But let's see how it plays. G/L!

"If you're feeling low, have a look at BAC's 1-year chart! It's been an amazing rally. Something must have happened late last fall to lift investors' spirits and compel them to buy BAC. Because the rally has been stupendous!"
"Once again we are starting out green today as is Bac(although not by much0. Keep your eye on the three major indexes,esp Nasdaq and the the S&P. If these two start to weaken it spells trouble again. Remember the Dow is 30 stocks, but these two are around 3300+ and 500+ respectively and a much broader index and therefore more influential. Uh oh...even As I am writing this I just looked up and already the Nasdaq is red again,but expecting bumpy action"

would you people quit poking at BIGMONEY?
"The buy side might be excited, and I get it, but I'm coming around to the idea that this pooch has gotten out too far ahead of his tail. Ummm...so to speak. The whole sector looks to be a bit overbought. If you take a look at the last 3 earnings periods you'll see that the bid has sold off post-earnings. It might explain why some have built their straddle as they have. What am I saying? I'm saying I wouldn't be chasing this thing on the buy side going into earnings...sit back and wait on cheapies...odds are good you'll get them....bid $44.65"

looks like traders can't make up their minds if they should buy or sale BAC today . my estimate is that this will end up about . 35 cents on the green by the end of the day
This should be 50 bucks a share……..price of a small bag of groceries…..
"Big Joe enlisted the help of business leaders to force the Insurrection Party back to business. No cry-baby games, urged Big Joe, and the market rallied after initial losses. And BAC is once again at high cyclical prices! What a great stock!"
"This is the way I see it; The market is usually at least 6 months of the economy. Traders will probably factor 1-2 rates hikes in the next 6 months into the price of BAC. This may take BAC stock price to the mid 50's by December. Besides, this stock appears to be one of the safest place to put money in this recent volatile market environment. Good luck to all."
Made a wrong move yesterday Couldn’t see move today Have to take a break for a few days Let’s see what Mr Market up to

CPI up .4% M/M or 5.4% Y/Y. Let me throw this question out to this august group of theadsters by way of a poll. Does that match up with what you're experiencing when you waltz down the aisle of your local food/wally mart does it? PM bid $43.87.
I'm a little concerned about the shorts that refuse to listen or read a balance sheet.Ya'll still out there? Can you pay next months rent? Ya ain't jumped off your roof yet I hope.Funny how some refuse to make money because they want to smear hate on a great company.
"Shorted AMC a few weeks ago. With the massive profits, I'm buying more BAC. That bank has been good for me"
"Bank of America Corp. beat analysts’ earnings estimates as fees climbed at the company’s dealmaking unit, boosted by a record-breaking period for mergers and acquisitions."
"BofA participated in the federal government’s Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), initially receiving $25 billion and then another $20 billion in assistance to help it absorb Merrill, which reported a loss of more than $15 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. It later came out that while Merrill was racking up losses it paid out $10 million or more to 11 top executives. It was also belatedly revealed that Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson had pressured BofA to conceal the extent of the financial mess at Merrill until after shareholders approved the acquisition. In the wake of that revelation, BofA shareholders stripped chief executive Kenneth Lewis of his additional post as chairman. Lewis later resigned from the CEO position as well."
"Best part of being Long and Holding is, No stress during earnings week. Yahoo. !!I actually enjoy sitting back watching the shorts spouting , “But it always drops heavily after earnings”."
Great day BAC$ Thank you Mr. Moynihan.
MA and VISA pe of 36.. You don't think BAC can have pe 36 also?
"Thank to JB and CH. They continue BAC where Obama stopped. What a team! This is where you say, I am glad I voted."
It is a modern bank. you people.. You access everything through smart phones. scanning checks..OMG
All time high coming.
I feel sorry for those that bought BAC at the close. It has a lot of downside to go.
"Big banks are going to gobble up Fintec like Sofi etc…. BAC has plenty of existing Fintech, patents on blockchain, cutting edge cost cutting technology. The PE at Square is horrendous! BAC could see 40+ PE so do that math my brothers! BAC may engulf a big fintec company and they will currently continue expanding their robust already existing fintec projects, patents and making massive moves in automation 100+ sp expectations is real just a matter of when!"
"Very light volume. Good support, so far!"
Nice close...$45.09. Close at the 52wk high. Now let's see if there's follow-thru tomorrow. But for now everyone enjoy...
"No matter how the day ends up, it is very interesting right now that all the other major banks are down this morning while BAC is currently up."
$50 by Thanksgiving?
hard not to be ecstatic over this report. $50 possible by year's end.
Look'it THAT! Everything all forgiven from the last session or so? Bid at $44.65 and looking like it wants a new 52wk high. And somewhere the long suffering bulls are...
"More like 55! Bank of America price target raised to $48 from $41 at Jefferies Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin raised the firm's price target on Bank of America to $48 from $41 and keeps a Hold rating on the shares as he introduced his 2023 EPS estimates for the bank group. He models two 25 basis point Fed rate hikes in 2023, including one in January and one in July, and a steeper rate curve with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield reaching 2.1% by year-end 2023.Read more at:"
"Sad thing is, $AMC should be well over $200 by now, YF and several others have been behind the reason its not. #hood #bac"
Never buy 5 months high
"This the way I see it: The market is always 6 months ahead of the economy. With the Fed tapering, the interest on the 10 year notes will be fluctuating on the upside! This will be followed by 1-2 rate hikes between December 2021 and July of next year, worse case scenario. Traders, ahead of the economy, will factor 1-2 interest rate hike in the price of BAC and the stock may hit the mid 50's by December. The stock is also a safe haven for those looking for security in this turbulent market environment. Dividend, plus growth, plus buyback, makes it extremely attractive for any investor with a good eye, short and long term. If interest rates keep rising next year and the year after, this stock could very cheap! Good luck all, you decide!"
"About BAC straddling pricing ahead of earnings, this came out at 05:52:29 this morning. Straddle prices for stocks expected to report quarterly results next week.Bank of America (BAC) October 44 straddle priced for a move of +/- 4% into the expected release of quarter results on October 13.For those uninformed a straddle entails buying a call and put of the same strike that allows the holder to profit based on how much the price of the underlying security moves, regardless of the direction of price movement."
"6:58 AM EDT, 10/14/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Bank of America (BAC) posted Q3 earnings Thursday of $0.85 per share, up from $0.51 per share a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Capital IQ projected $0.71.Revenue was $22.8 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $20.3 billion a year ago. The consensus estimate was $21.6 billion."
$44.49 now and huge drops over due and Puts highly attractive the higher it go and fake the price.
I’m holding 6000 w $4.85 basis. Time to sell and pay taxes before the librals raise capital gains?
We told you the upgrade cycle was coming and now it’s has begun! 50’s are coming soon and then the 60’s are around the corner BAC still undervalued and analysts will continue to up the PT. Someone’s gonna print a 70+ PT in the next month or two. Not investment advice. Good luck this has been a longtime coming but we are headed in the right direction!
I have told you that BAC has used automated banking... It is more high tech than you people think...Efficient..
"PM bid now $43.88. Breaking south of $44 opens the door to Master continuing to walk the pooch downward...possibly back down to around the ~$43.20 line, since that's about where, if you look at a chart, the bid spent a few sessions churning along it. But it's early, not even session start yet. Let's see how it plays out. G/L!"
First Trillion dollar bank? BAC or JPM?
"Here is the good news..This board has never seen this much traffic and it is just starting...Here is the bad news..This board has never seen this much traffic and its just starting,,"
Face ripper rally
Sell and run before the massive drop!!!
10/05/2021 - 14:58:43 - Goldman Sach's adjusts Price Target for Bank of America to $45 from $44. Maintains Buy Rating. FYI?
I don’t know what Money Bag Joe is doing but this economy is on fire. Keep it Uncle Joe! Stonks only go up
"BAC truly undervalued …..should be selling for 50 plus a share…. A rock solid company that pays a fair dividend ,with great management."
LETS GO BRANDON!
At one time I used BAC for loan facilities. No more. I feel they are unethical. Heard they’re using deposits to short AMC theaters. Closed my business account at BAC.
