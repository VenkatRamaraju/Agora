strong sell on BAC - ready to drop harder in September market correction
"BAC doing well today as the delta variant is soaring throughout conservative states. And yes, my funeral home, casket and urn stocks are also doing well, thanks to the anti-vaxxers! Plus, most anti-science families have to take out unsecured consumer loans from BAC to finance their anti-science relatives' funerals! That's life!"
And of course we are red. *Sigh* we finally get a couple of green days but BofA can't hold on to a gain for anything.
PM bid $40.99. So far no pop. No drop. Just a plop of sideways walk-around this line it couldn't get away from yesterday. So I guess that means to expect more of the same today? Let's see how it plays. G/L!
Ding ding CLANK (thud)!! Bid $40.73. It's fish shootin' time?
"Inflation is transitory. Right, Lumber futures have dropped from $1,700+ to $551. But Why? A 2X4 is still $8. The cost of transport has gone up, gas up, 45%, the cost of labor to move and handle lumber up 10%."
Did DJT purposely enter into a weak withdrawal agreement to embarrass the next administration
IVR for calls and BAC for Puts as bac continue drops after every above $40s ;) can not hold a fake green bac. lol
"Looks like $37.50 is a solid support line. $38.70's has been a bit tough the last few days. There's a good chance for BAC to hit $39, AGAIN, this week."
Please give me an honest response here. I want to invest into 2 or 3 bank stocks. What 3 would you pick for long term investments?
Looks like Masters machines are programmed to keep the bid under the $42 waterline.
7/16/21Credit Suisse Group Raises Price Bank of America Corporation (BAC) $46.00 ‚ûù $47.00 Outperform
"Well, after the amateurs like the self-described BIGMONEY and Dave soiled their panties, BAC and the overall market is rebounding! Of course, stock markets do correct, especially after we enjoyed a record-breaking bull market so far in 2021!"
$41s and $42s makes the Puts highly attractive as drops will come again. ;) we are in bidens recession and many more crisis and a fake green market only opportunity
"02:31 PM EDT, 08/16/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Bank of America (BAC) on Monday said July credit card delinquency rate was 0.92%, compared with 0.97% in the previous month. Net charge-off rate for the month fell to 1.61% from 1.78%. Shares of the bank were down over 1% in recent trading. Price: 41.16, Change: -0.48, Percent Change: -1.14"
Rumor has it the Cyber Ninjas are on life support
Thop thuh theal!!!! DrRrR DuUuUHhHh DrRr LOL
"I have a strong feeling BAC will go down now as it approaching all times high, so as Dow and S&P. Will get out for now and will get back in later in a year."

the higher $40s the more attractive the Puts become because big drops over due .
$41 todays resistance line?
Looks like the treasury's yield dropped a little bit PM after being up 5 days in an row. The big banks dropped accordingly. Looking like a drop at the open and buy on the dip type of day...
"Bank Of America , Continues , Take A Look , Morning , Afternoon , And Before Close , Stock Program's , Buyback , Million's , And Million's , Monday THRU Friday , People Are Starting To Realize , Starting To Get Tougher , To Buy Million's Of Share's Of Stock Of BAC , People Want Higher Price's , $46.00 To $48.00 , Coming Soon , Maybe Wait , A Week Or Two , For $5.00 To $8.00 A Share More , Buyback Will Keep Going For Several More Month's , GLTA ,"
Bought next weeks $40 calls for $1.70. I feel it's a safe BET!!
"$42 coming up. New highs before labor day. As long as rates keep climbing, $50 is a very real goal by May."
under 4 weeks now $41.80s let's see how much it will drop big in no time. the higher it go up in bidens fake market the more risk and will drop in no time and making Puts attractive.
"Holy cow, the PD guy, who often masquerades as a big-money type-of fellow, is really pumping it out today! He owns no stock, but he just pumps it out all day.That's all he does!"
"Realty BAC is largest Fintech Money Center Bank in the world . Like Mike Mayo said . This be $100 a share in 12 to 18 months , CEO seen the future of banking went in head first ."
"Just look at the charts - - ever since last November 2020 when The Big Loser lost, BAC has soared! Congrats to all BAC and bank shareholders! Plus, NYT and many other stocks are enjoying remarkable gains, too!"
"7 months into Bidoom. Remember when William said at least a thousand times that the first year market gains belonged to the previous President. Enjoy DJTs market, and clear out at the end of the year. Cheers William."
"Funny, over the weekend friends were discussing inflation. 1/2 thought it's not going away the other 1/2 were saying it's transitory. I asked what there political affiliations were. I thought it was going to be a 50/50 split with Republicans saying it permanent and Democrats saying it was transitory. Surprisingly it was almost 60/40 saying transitory. I then asked the transitory group why. Almost all said the pro's are saying it's transitory. Who are the pro's? There investment advisers who have them in bonds and bond funds because of there age. Short sighted or smart asset allocation? Personally I'm staying away from bonds and looking at high growth dividend paying companies."
BAC now sponsors CRT training for employees. This theory is destructive to all and anti American.
Bid $41.90. Going for the .80 support line it seems....
In early of last recession performance and all data were very similar and now the data and things looking alot bigger so fake greens then we all know how desperate things has became . will drops ill remind how big ;)
"If you are so far in debt you are about to go bankrupt, would you pay your neighbors mortgage and buy their groceries for them? Of course not.So why are we doing an infrastructure bill with $1TRILLION in spending, and talking about a $3.5 TRILLION Green new deal, while we are sending Trillions of foreign aid out of the country, While we have TWENTY EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS of national debt?"
"Bank of America Corp. BAC, filed a shelf registration Monday, Aug 2 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow it to issue up to $123 billion in debt securities, warrants, preferred stock and equity securities over time. Over time for a shelf filing indicates usually a 5 year period. This is standard procedure for issuing debt to expand operations, issue warrants, extend options as compensation to execs, and BUY BACK STOCK. Debt is raised in anticipation to very heavy loan volume, and is necessary because Tier 1 capital requirements keeps so much money locked away from doing business. Future debt raise is very positive for the growth of BAC. Maybe the little Robinhood Reddit rookies should educate themselves."
Florida corrects CDC false data. Good for them.
"The ONLY way to get back at banks for all the fees and interest charges for decades and decades, is to buy their shares and getting full gratification to make money on it. My forth entry since 2009 and YES it was an uphill battle first 5-6 years but now the harvest is in. Thank You BAC, JPM for paying off my mortgage !!!!!!"
"William , Look's Like , Next Stop , $43.50 , All Aboard , Next Week $44.50 , Enjoy The Great Ride ; GLTA ,"
Another red day?
BAC says drop in credit card activity do to delta variant . People withdrawing staying home more . Be ready to buy BAC on pullback in mid to low $30's
The entire stock market is due for a 10% correction. Please use caution here.
"Florida changes it covid death data to make it look better than it is.. Who would have thought that governor DeathSentence, would do that.. hmmm maybe the data scientist he fired for publishing accurate data? ... oh yeah.. Everybody.."
"Took 'em most of the session but bid now at $42.02. The entire upside intraday is...pffffft....gone. Right back where it ended the last session. So now it gets interesting. Either the machines bounce it here, or......well....there's that upside gap from yesterday....which means the next target (for them) would be the ~$41.60 line if the sell side program is still in effect. Let's see which way they go from here. Play it accordingly."
It's going to be an interesting day. Fed speak at 10:00 and 63% of all 10 yr options are expiring toady. Expect a lot of movement in the 10 yr. Read last night the market anticipates a move toward 1.15% or 1.50%. GLTA!
"Here's a question I have. It's a basic ""Excuse me but..."" type question. It's about the economy. Everyone, or at least all the self-anointed pundits of ""the know"" keep saying the economy is going gang-busters. That we on the edge of the land of rainbows, moonbeams and kittens. Okay....(say's me)....let's say that's true. Then why is the Fed so busy flooding the the entire system with free money, like they've been doing more or less since 2008, if this is the case? In fact they've intensified the effort. It begs the question don't it? Why are they doing this if things are really so good? Just a question while watching the bid at $36.94."
From $40.28 to $40.02 in about 10 minutes. I guess you can say you can see the focus of masters machines can't ya? You know what they're doing....
By a laaaaaaaaaandsliiiide LOL
"Please keep refusing to get your Covid-19 vaccine and go ahead do not wear your mask. Continue to selfishly put your family at risk. Keep listening to egotistical degenerates like Ron DeSantis, Greg Abbott, and Kristi Noem. They would be there for you when your moment of glory comes. However, stay at home when you are about to die, and please, we do not want to hear your foolishness about ""coulda, woulda, shoulda"" and the sooner you are gone the more time we would have to forget about you we would appreciate."
"How BM got Covid , the hard way !"
Ex dividend date is 9/2/21...Doesn't anyone else have a google machine?
"Looks like a stall out, for now, around the $42.30 line. Perfect pivot area. Let's see what happens next."
Here we go...the selling has been focused and relentless since the ~11am timeframe. They are going to take the pooch south of $40. Bid now $40.04. Get ready for it folks. G/!
"richard , Look's Like , Here We Go Again , Next Stop ; $42.00 ; Maybe , $44.00 By Friday , Stock Buyback Program Is Huge , GLTA ,"
Flashback: In 1945 when democrats were still sane(yes Virginia there was such a time) Pres Truman had to make the awful decision whether to drop the A bomb on Japan killing tens of thousands or not doing it having maybe up to a million + American die in the war. Of course he chose the later and one more bomb later Japan surrendered and the war was over. Many other examples in our history like this
AMC theaters lost over $300M last qtr. and it was up 20% today. HAHAHA! Sometimes you just have to laugh at the fraud market.
Classic sell side action spent all afternoon patiently walking the Pooch back to $41. I'm closing my short from a higher level here and flipping into a buy....since it's now house money I'm willing to gamble on the overnight. Now watch the world go to hell on the overnight and the bid open up $10 down. Don't'cha just hate it when that sort of sh1t happens? Heh!
Another red day? When's the last time we've even seen green? Someone check a chart
Anyone else notice the bid/ask was more than $.01? The MM's appear to be tired of the selling.
I have followed BAC for a long time and still like it for long term. Its a slow but steady climber
Is it time for another stimulus??
1.1 million acres have burned in California on Federal Land ! Remember California is America's greatest money maker !
"What're the odds this mutt ends the session at, or close, to $41? Bid right now? $41. What's it been all session long, excepting the pop at the beginning? Right around $41. So here's the drill. Anybody want to bet that should the bid pop at the beginning of the next session it will be walked back down to this same line by end of session? And if it gets dropped at the beginning it will get walked back up to it? You see the pattern? And how many reading this will be disturbed if it in fact does this very thing? Magical, ain't it? To be THAT predictable. But I could be talking out of me lower orifice. Let's see what the Pooch actually does. G/L! Bid now $41.01."
time to start the move to 50
"How does this bitcoin stuff really works,i have been searching for a good broker to trade with!Is real broker that hard to find?"
What‚Äôs up with Panic Dream.? He thinks the sky is falling every time BAC drops 1%. . It seems he is putting all his eggs in one basket. You don‚Äôt know how to diversify and keep Long.
Anyone remember the posting last week related to this weeks $40 calls and the huge volume associated with them and the $.35 premiums on them? Well the premiums are now down to $.10.
And UN happened to just give the Code red to Humanity . search what UN code red is. remeber what I told ya all? natural disasters coming and all those things I said watch it. remember I tsaid this or next year a huge earthquake in California and within now and 5 years Yellowstone another and many going on already they have had 1000 earthquakes. I am sure those who follows me reads before yahoo delete also take screen shots. I have called this things since 2015 and I warned non stop since 2017 and I remind alot worst coming. not over not start yet regardless how much you seen. you see alot more and you know how much I get anything wrong.
Looking to get a new car and truck. There is 1 Chevy 2500 between 4 dealers and no Traverses' anywhere I looked. All because of a chip shortage. They have literally sold all vehicles before they are delivered. This shortage has caused Toyota to scale back production 40% -60% in the US until the shortage is resolved. Temporary maybe but it's hurting the economy by not having supply to fit the demand. Who's fault?
BAC is back above the 50dma. Looks like the Christmas Santa rally in starting in August!
"While all BAC investors are enjoying The BIg Joe 2021 Bull Market, the bigmoney and the passsivedreams fellow has been busy making lots of posts during the trading day. That's okay, because it keeps the poor fellow occupied and quiet while real investors are making lots of money!"
glad to see you are concerned about others feelings
"Investors love this 2021 bull market in stocks. So do BAC investors! 2021 has been great for everyone. Sure, the previous 4 years were profitable for the shorts, but those days are over! GLTA BAC stockholders!"
Now experts started saying we are in recession while I said it long before them lol.
Opening at yesterday's high. Will that set up for today's low?
"Is it possible, BAC up 3 straight mornings?"
"By the way, as the indexes rally this morning, pay no attention to the amateur BIGMONEY names and fake william names. He's lonely and owns no stock! Buy some shares of BAC, fake william and fake BIGMONEY!"
B of A recommending not buying lithium stocks is absurd! Do they have an alternative motive? B of A and Wells Fargo are in the same loop. Explore their procedures and make your own judgement.
Remind me how Puts will dow when. I said the higher bac go ($42.40s at the time) the more attractive Puts became because will drop in no time big ones ;) so prove me rmwromg yet ? more coming
"Other than the dividend, what's the upside to owning BAC stock? I've held it for years, but it's hardly exciting and I'm thinking I can get much better gains elsewhere."
The higher and greener bac hits the more attractive Puts already became. ;) what's next big drops ;)
In bidens fake market and everything the higher bac go of today's $41.40s the more attractive Puts became as many drops coming and big drop over due if timed and priced well the Puts.
BAC is the most advanced in the digital world than any other money center bank . Bac is the FINTECH money center bank like Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo says and has put strong buy & year end price target of $52 on BAC .
"Interesting...Master took the better part of an hour to walk the bid back down to ~$42.12 and then, in under 3 minutes time, bid $42.26. Makes you wonder don't it? Somebody running a game on a (so far) heavy volume day..."
Bac $40s vs IVR $3s pays over 10% divvy now I guess I'll leave the rest of risk if there's risk for one there's same risk for the other one or even greater for the bigger one lol
So why didn't Buffett add to his BAC holdings? Too many eggs in one basket perhaps. Eventually Berkshire will own 25% of BAC by doing nothing. 600+- million shares a year being bought back. 10 year outlook the OS should be down around 4 billion. BAC's NI should be close to $50 Billion a year in 5 years. That's $10/share. There's NO reason to sell BAC with rates expected to rise.
"Since last November when this bull market began, BAC has almost doubled! So, it is understandable that investors would take some of their massive profits off the table, hence the sell-off today!"
"We Think , Bank Of America , Is The Best , And Safest Investment That You Can Make In Our Great Country ; Best CEO , And The Best Staff Of Great People , GLTA ,"
"Oops, they decided to remove all that stuff....When you're wrong just make it disappear and pretend it never happened"
BAC is really starting to look good. Slow steady upside trend
Going back to $43
"Out of all the doom-and-gloom and fear-mongering from the elite right-wing media, most stock indexes are up this morning, and BAC is still over $40! We've had a heck of a rally in 2021, so a little profit-taking is to be expected!"
"All selling, and at a +200K per minute clip, with the bell. Clearly PM was a head-fake. Let's see how it plays out. Bid $42.15..."
"Americans all find it hilarious when tardnation says why do dems lie.....let me guess, STOP THE STEAL wasn't a lie? Space lasers from Europe wasn't a lie? Hollywood elite eating babies and drinking their blood isn't a lie? BAHAHAHA you are all just triggered tards. You all need medication."
"I saw one post below that claimed gold miners were the place to be in 2021. I'm guessing that the loser who made that post didn't compare the 1-year chart for BAC and NEM.Had the loser done that comparison, he would have seen that BAC vastly outperformed goldminers!"
"So where is BAC going this week? Remember the HUGE option volume at the $40 strike price last week?? If the 10 yr doesn't rise like it was doing last week, $40 will be a tough nut to crack. 10 yr currently down to 1.28%."
Banks will drop now timing the Puts will be a challenge ;) who would know and who could be the best at reality ? well we have seen signs and all things haven't we?
"On CNBC's option action, Jon, highlighted unusual activity in next weeks $40 calls and said he bought some. Premium is $.35 yet on the $39's it $.15."
Oh love the dividend
IVR $3.13 and pays over 11% divvy do the math vs BAC high risk lol
By the way....did Jerome say anything substantive? Really?
So congress passed the $1.2 trillion infrastructure package Tuesday and the $3.5 trillion at 4:00 AM. The Fed is issuing more 10 & 30 yr notes today. I'm expecting rates to rise today and banks to go slightly higher by 2:00 PM. IMHO GLTA and happy trading.
Into the final 30.....bid at $42.04....all the buy/sell on close orders being queued up for the last few minutes of the session. Wonder which way it'll go?
I see nothing but extremely over valued stocks. Please be careful.
"For the last 15 minutes all 4 big banks jumped big time. BAC from $40 to $40.40. Oh ya, we're going higher."
"JoeyB handed the enemy $84,000,000,000 worth of military hardware. That's what he's responsible for."
BAC is finally coming BACK 
Looks like Mr Buffett held on to all his BOA stock.... Smart move
"PM bid....well...thud? It's early, but $39.85. Down over 2% already. Breaking $40....again...is a pivot. Play it accordingly if, and it's early yet, if it holds up. G/L!"
"Look's Like We Our On Our Way To $42.00 , William , GLTA ,"
Whip saw action. $40.02 to $40.41 twice in 20 minutes. Still no direction for the day.
"Sure, BAC is correcting a little, but since inauguration day, BAC has rallied 25%, and many other stocks rallied even more!It's no wonder that Big Joe is so popular. In fact, he won the popular vote, while The Big Loser set a record by losing the popular vote twice! Not only that, The Big Loser has always had ultra-low favorability ratings!Well, at least he throws cheap wedding events at his flea-bitten hotel!"
"And the Fed decision is......no change in interest rate. On tapers the Fed didn't say the words...""assess progress in coming meetings."" Ecnomic, employment, etc., continue to make gains but have not recovered...."
10 year rising. Im all cash. Ive never been so sure of correction COMING.Ive called 3 of last 5 correctly.$nvda $bac $amzn $fb $
Bid $39.82. Looks like $40 is the pivot line. In my buy zone here so I'm in for a buy side trade.
"Stocks are up , job growth is up , home prices are up and were out of Afghanistan in 7 months .This what happens when you are not golfing all the time !"
the higher $40s bac or $41 the more attractive Puts become as it will drop red big time soon ;)
The 10 yr touched 1.374%. 1.40% is a phycological number and is within reach! That would be good for another $.50!
MARKRT and BAC performing fake the higher it go the more attractive Puts become for next bug drops in no time ;)
3% core is 3.6% annualized -- nearly double the Fed's target of 2%. Rates are going higher. Buy.
"Even though Big Money's Passive Dream and Techitch1 names are funny, the IVR stock recommendation is a disaster. Today, IVR is down 1.2% while BAC is only down 0.2% as I post.So I recommend that Passive Dream uses his Big Money and Techitch1 names to post funny cartoons and stuff, and not recommend stocks!"
Florida is great low tax state.
Putting America First !

BAC boost dividend 17%. Getting closer to old $2.60 dividend if I live to 150. GLTA
"The 15 minute chart turning bullish usually takes 50 cents out of BAC. Today, 26 cents.Momentum is strong today."
Somebody must'a decided to poke the Pooch on his...back side? Bid $42.28. Not that I'm complainin' mind you....
10 day winning streak. I guess all those who sold after earning report are buying back in.
2022 Quarterly EPS is expected to be above $.80 giving BAC a EPS of at least $3.60 (most likely higher when buybacks are included.) X current PE of 13.90 gets BAC to $50. A little PE expansion to say 15 get BAC to $54. All this without figuring in organic growth from new money centers.
"Looks like you might get another gift this AM if BAC drops below $41. The 10 yr is heading higher, now at 1.28% and most likely to go higher after fed minutes are released at 2:00 today."
"With Jerome having done yet one more session of jaw-boning, and actually doing nada, I expect the market will react negatively where this sector is concerned. At least...for now. Which is kind'a sort'a what you're seeing what with Master walking the Pooch southward....no signs of a rate increase kind'a deflate any bullish balloons don't it?"
Indicted
"From late February and they are sticking to it.Wells Fargo boosts Bank of America target, sees path to $55 per share"
"10 yr hitting 1.265%, heading higher bodes well for tomorrow!"
"William , Look's Like We Our On Our Way , Back To , $44.00 , Maybe , Next Week , GL , William ;"
"In addition to the 2021 rally in BAC, I am enjoying how well 2021 has been for my defense stocks like GD! It's as though ever since The Big Loser was removed, defense stocks have been outstanding performers! I guess that has to do with Big Joe's returning the money misappropriated from the military to build his overpriced border wall, plus a renewed commitment to have a strong military defense against Russia!Congratulations to all BAC stockholders and owners of defense stocks! 2021 has been a great year for us!"
"Once again, the amateurs are panicking again. Based on their short experience in the record-breaking 2021 bull market, they only thought that stocks can go up. They're the same ones who sold in early 2009 and in 1993, and missed those record-breaking bull markets, too!"
De ja vu!Bounce again at 10:00 from $40.50 or do we get that 500 point drop?
Prison by 2024
"Thanks BAC for contributing to this life-changing, record-breaking 2021 bull market! Plus, my funeral, casket-maker and urn-maker stocks are doing especially well today! Management expects a bumper-crop of business thanks to the anti-vaxxers in conservative states! GLTA!"
Established a buy side gambit at $40.85. Too much of a sell side overshoot to ignore (imo). So why not? Yeah consumer sentiment is negative...and that probably explains what's going on right now all across the market...but that line was a bit overdone so I'm in for a trade with trailing now down. Bid $41.04.
Master wasn't successful on the first attempt at walking the mutt south of $40. But if at first you don't succeed.......Bid now $40.11...
"Yesterday and today's selloff is not about fed tapering. Everyone knew that was coming. It's about the US not having a rudder and is leaderless, and fear of what is about to come."
"So what youre saying is make your choice and accept the responsibility for your action (or inaction)...."".Go peacefully in to the night?"""
"All selling, as usual, dropped the bid to the low $41.70's....I was waiting for it with an overshoot buy side trap...so I'm in at .73. Bid now .81. Let's see what sort of bounce sets up...G/L"
The IVR with over 11% and costs only $3.12 shows alot hope than bac or any other ;)
"Another beautiful day in the record-breaking 2021 bull market! Hope everyone's participating in BAC's rally! And even though conservative states are seeing exponential upticks in Delta variant cases, my funeral, casket-making and urn-making stocks are profiting! They are expecting an upsurge in orders in those conservative states!"
"In plain English, to get the dividend. OWN the stock when the market closes tomorrow."
Bac needed to increased its dividend here .. They made enough moneyTo double up its dividend.. time to pay those longs here!!‚Äô
Cha Ching$$$ -- 09/02 Divy Day Again only this time is Larger.
Market is heading higher. The 10 yr is steady and holding near 1.35%. $42.30 has been the resistance the last few time BAC was in this stratosphere. BAC has been Green for almost 2 week since the drop to $38. The YTD high is $43.49. I think BAC may take a day or two off before knocking on that door again. IMHO $42.50 maybe too tough to get though today unless there's a big up day all around. GLTA!
Notice WilliamHighlowsel deleted his post. Too late William. We already read it.
Looks like BAC wants to test yesterday's high at the open.
"One more for all the climate change fans: Lets assume that its true(its not, but lets pretend) . How do we fix it, who pays for it, how long will it take and how much will it cost?"
"The Big Joe Bull Market continues to shatter all-time high records in 2021! Congrats to all BAC shareholders, and other shareholders who held on, even when The Big Loser told you to sell last year! It pays to be skeptical of people who do not tell the truth! BAC up 1/2 percent as I make this post!"
Certificate of deposit is too low at this bank. Your getting ripped off.
"Bid rolled at $42.84 and it's been all selling in the usual machine pattern since then. As usual they're going for overshooting....bid now .25. They might try to break $42....again...and since I'm riding a short with trailing I'm fine with it. Once the trailing gets hit I'll flip to a buy....just bird-in-hand trading, playing off the algo's and machine pattern...G/L!"
PM bid $41.56. Looks set to continue along the current trend. G/L!
William I looked you up. You are obsessed with Passive Dream. BAC 
remember when bac hits $42.50s and more i said the higher it go the more attractive Puts become ? well now dropped to $41.66 and continues the drops ;)
"Haha, my prediction of 41$ within 1 month was a bit too far. It hit 41 within a couple of days. No complaints!Wednesday/thursday data could influence decision to increase interest rates. We all know what that would mean for bank/financial stocks like BAC."
"Lets Re cap: CA now giving away $1000 per month per family no strings attach free money. Cancelled Billions in Student Debt. Sending 97 unemployment checks to Single address every 2 weeks. $500 for each child per month. $1000 extra per month if U R pregnant. Building $750,000 luxury Condos for Permanent housing of the Homeless. Free A/C all summer. Free Food. Gov. Newsome to spend an additional $16 Billion to house the rest of the Vagrants , Bums and Junkies."
Price action looks great for selling more Bac puts
"HI GUYS , WE ARE GOING TO BANK OF AMERICA  TO OPEN NEW ACCOUNTS.  "
!st in % losses. Why is BAC last in stock price among the major banks.
Your unvaccinated !
"Unless the market falls apart because of JoeyB's actions this weekend, BAC by the charts is set up for a good run next week."
"God bless the US Capitol police - - many volunteered for military service, and all swore an oath to protect the US Constitution and democracy against threats, both domestic and foreign.
