"I bought at $44.00 the week after IPO Sept 30 2016. How am I doing? This has been one of the worst. 6 years sitting on a loss. But so much potential, ready to rocket higher. Save the spin. It is a pss poor stock and everyone knows it. More power to the day traders. They made a fortune playing this tool since its high in the $60s. Please someone acquire this pile and possibly I can break even after 6 years."
"Smart people know something, all we see here is a set up for upcoming earnings call. This is not the first time NTNX stock has shown this behavior of looking positive on outlook and negative on share price. $40 was ideal with current outlook . Insider selling also had happened before and its happening now. Not sure what is the negative news in next results..."

"13F forms for Q3 will be filed by the big institutional investors around Nov 15. A few early filings are coming in from smaller firms. Clarity Wealth Advisors has around $200m under management in San Jose, right in NTNX's back yard. They came in as a new investor during July-Aug-Sept with a buy of around 25,000 shares. They have more money invested in NTNX than in Cisco, Netflix, Intel, Oracle, or Salesforce. With the amount of money this firm has under management, they will never own enough shares to have any impact on the stock price. But their Q3 investment in NTNX is a nice vote of confidence. Being in San Jose, they probably know companies like Cisco, Intel, Oracle, and Salesforce well. The fact that they have more money invested in NTNX than in these better known companies says something."
"Dan Ives, one of the more widely followed tech analysts, was on Squawk Box on CNBC on Monday morning. He's expecting some good earnings reports from tech companies this week, except for social media stocks that have some headwinds right now. Ives said that digital transformation continues to accelerate throughout the economy, so this is obviously positive for NTNX."
Patience will prevail. In turnaround stories there are always period of doubts. The resignation of Chris Kaddaras the chief revenue officer may have led to speculation about a revenue miss. However I buy the story about a new opportunity for him being in charge of a a pre IPO company. With renewals beings greater portion of revenue I believe there is a higher visibility and that therefore a miss is unlikely. The story about NUTANIX is one of higher revenue growth and a multiple expansion of revenue/sales as profitability is in sight and as confidence improves on the turnaround. It’s that simple.
"Rick Rieder, one of the top people at Blackrock, was on Squawk Box on CNBC on Wednesday. He's predicting a rally in the stock market into year end, and he said that tech continues to be a leader in the market. He had some interesting comments about how what Google and Microsoft are doing in the cloud is comparable in magnitude to the economies of some entire countries.Blackrock owned nearly 9m shares of NTNX as of June 30. It's clear that top people at Blackrock are aware of what's happening with cloud businesses, so it wouldn't be surprise if Blackrock decided to add to their position in NTNX."
Nasdaq recovered 10% back to all time highs. NTNX has moved lower over that same time. Down about 23% from the high currently. Never fails to amaze me.
"Microsoft and Google are out with their quarterly results. Microsoft's cloud business is accelerating. Analyst Kirk Materne at Evercore said that Microsoft had ""An impressive quarter in its cloud business."" Google's cloud business was also strong, with sales up year over year 48% from 3444 million to 4990 million.At the William Blair Growth Stock Conferenc on June 1, 2021, NTNX said that their customers will have applications running in the public cloud but these applications will also be running on premise. Growth of edge computing will also drive workloads on premise. What NTNX uniquely provides is a platform that allows customers to run their workloads wherever they want. As growth continues in the cloud businesses of Microsoft and Google, this will also drive continued growth in sales at NTNX.In summary, the digital transformation of the world's economy is accelerating, and NTNX is right at the heart of this. Eventually their growth in sales will translate into a higher stock price."
"I love the negativity! Everyone seems to be about to throw the towel, reminds me of around the $27 and before that the $20 level when it surge unannounced. I'm not saying the stock cannot slide further toward $30 but there is precedent to sit on the other side of the boat in times like this."
Today is the last working day for Chris Kaddaras. Let’s take a moment to thank this man for turning around the s&m dept and adding discipline and rigor to the sales process. He will be sorely missed. He leaves with a very strong pipeline and methodology. Will they carry the torch or drop the ball?
Let’s break down what we have going onCurrent realignment and optimization of sales momentum since Bain and RR involvementAdded partner in Redhat allowing sales to customers previously not available Strategic deal with supermicro where their customer base can now be exposed to HCiPartner autonomy selling removing friction and accelerating sales process Citrix customers can now be directly be exposed to HCi as foundational platform for eucUnique quarterly phenomena where government spending budget flush and catch up on cloud meaning public sector strength HCi gaining traction as public cloud operating model. Can anyone add other ‘juicers’ to momentum that don’t contain tute buys of 5 k shares?
"Give the new CEO a chance to turn this around along with Bain Capital and the new board (I give Nutanix an A+ as far as the vision and execution). A roadmap to profitability is laid-out for everyone to review now. The early innings of a company transitioning through a subscription SAS based model is the answer to a lot of the questions surrounding where Nutanix is right now from WS perspective. Ask the question again in three quarters to see how true it will be and every year after until the subscription migration phase has gone full cycle. Nutanix future revenues will have a healthy mix based off recurring revenue streams (90 – 95% recurring business adds a lot of value) versus solely relying on hunting for new Sales opportunities, a good balance will come into play soon. A complete cycle of the subscription model will definitely draw the attention of WS in a few quarters."
At this point if your a long term investor in Nutanix you need to wait for the Q1 earnings report and see how the market reacts. The reality is the average investor simply doesn't have any confidence in the company because the stock has been stagnant for so long. The question is what is Bain Capital going to do if the stock remains dormant. A new CEO wants to appease his and run the company. That's certainly not a formula for being acquired?
"Although i sold it all few weeks back, Just wondering, Every excuse in the world is used to explain why the stock price is stuck in the neutral, is there any left?"
"Amy Wu Silverman, a strategist at RBC, was on Bloomberg TV on Monday morning. Silverman closely tracks the options market to get a read on where stocks are heading. Right now she's seeing declining amounts of hedging with options, which is saying that investors are becoming more bullish heading into year end.RBC owned 170,000 shares of NTNX as of June 30. Their 13F for Q3 will be coming in sometime in the next few weeks. It will be interesting to see if they added to their position in the stock."
"Andy Sieg, the President of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, was on Bloomberg Markets on Friday. He sees the stock market being mid-cycle, and feels that there is still room to run for the bull market. He said that there's close to a trillion dollars in cash on the sidelines that could move into stocks.Bank of America Wealth Management owned 1.5m shares of NTNX as of June 30, including 34,000 shares that they bought in Q2. Obviously they like the stock. As cash comes in off the sidelines, NTNX will be one of the stocks that Merrill Lynch financial advisors will recommend to their clients."
"Gartner, the technology consulting company, is predicting that information technology budgets next year will increase more than they have in ten years. This is based on a survey of over two thousand chief information officers. Cloud is expected to be one of the top areas for spending, so this is good for NTNX."
"HPE issued better than expected forward guidance at a meeting with financial analysts on Thursday. The CEO told the analysts that one area the company if focused on is providing customers with a ""cloud-everywhere experience"".At the Stifel Investment Conference on June 9, 2021 NTNX said that its partnership with HPE has grown steadily over the last couple of years, and they have gotten many Fortune 2000 customers through this partnership.In an earnings conference call earlier this year, NTNX discussed a win they had gotten in partnership with HPE: During the quarter a leading financial services company headquartered in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, tapped Nutanix in a multi-million-dollar, one-year subscription deal to modernize its data center and provide virtual desktops to more than 90,000 employees. The customer deployed Nutanix’s core software stack along with its hypervisor and Files storage service running on Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) hardware.NTNX shares HPE's vision of providing customers with a ""cloud-everywhere experience"". A pickup in business for HPE means more sales for NTNX."
