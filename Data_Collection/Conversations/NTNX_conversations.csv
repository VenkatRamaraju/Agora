"Oracle on Tuesday announced plans to add 14 more cloud regions over the next year. The tech giant said the expansion would be rolled out in two phases.The first phase will see new cloud regions in the cities of Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Marseille, Milan, and Stockholm along with the countries of Colombia, Mexico, Singapore, and Spain. Additional cloud regions will then be opened in Chile, France, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.""We've introduced several hundred new cloud services and features and are continuing to see organisations from around the world increasingly turn to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to run their most mission-critical workloads in the cloud,"" OCI executive vice president Clay Magouyrk said.

The following is from the Nutanix web site:Whether upgrading existing infrastructure or deploying new environments, on public, private or hybrid clouds, Nutanix Enterprise Cloud is the ideal solution for Oracle deployments."

""Companies are investing in their digital infrastructure so that they can set themselves up to grow in this new world,"" Salesforce president and COO Bret Taylor told Yahoo Finance.I expect the same factors that gave Salesforce a boost today to also benefit NTNX when they report their Aug-Sept-Oct quarter."

She's recommending small caps right now, since their valuations are significantly below those of large cap stocks. With its market cap of around $9b, NTNX falls into the small cap category.Bank of America likes NTNX - they owned 1.5m shares as of June 30, including 34,000 shares purchased in Q2. They like the stock and are most likely buying more in the current quarter."

"SAN JOSE, Calif., Sept. 13, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI), a global leader in enterprise computing, storage, networking solutions, and green computing technology, is joining the Nutanix Elevate Partner Program. This expanded collaboration will further help customers deploy, manage and scale their infrastructure by delivering optimized application and hardware solutions to address the increasing market demand for hybrid multi-cloud solutions.

Many workloads in various industries will benefit from this partnership and the Nutanix solution, including analytics, VDI, Remote Office/Branch Office, databases, and mission-critical applications."
"Highlights from the conference call and supplemental information:We drove top-line improvement while carefully managing expenses, leading to a substantially improved bottom-line performance compared to our prior Fiscal year.The underlying momentum in the business gives us confidence in providing strong guidance for the first quarter of our fiscal 22. Sales were strong throughout the entire quarter. There was no unusual deal slippage, and we built a backlog during the quarter.The emerging products attach rate was 41% (compared to 39% in the previous quarter and 37% in the quarter before that). 700 new customers were added, for a total of 20,130 customers, including 980 from the Global 2000.Jason AderQ: It seems like you're taking share in the HCI market in the first half of calendar 21, and I just was hoping you could talk about why you think that's happening?A: We have a very strong product offering that continues to get better. **********************************************************My thoughts - Every quarter NTNX adds significantly more customers and sells more emerging products to existing customers. These trends will allow the stock price to continue to move higher."
"maybe conference info is coincidence, but have never seen the rampamt posts by crussian and emory on twitter after today's drop...panic information push...sure does look like it?!"

"Oppenheimer is out with a note on Monday: ""Keeping things in context suggests to us that last week's action in stocks was not indicative of a trend reversal of significance.""Oppenheimer has been building up a small position in NTNX. In the April-May-June quarter, they bought 11,000 shares, and ended the quarter owning 80,000. After the investor day presentation in June, NTNX traded around 15m shares over the next couple of days, so when the 13Fs come in for Q3, it will be interesting to see which institutional investors went from a small to a large position."
"There is quite a lot of interest here...that is a good sign. It is like seeing birds going out on a fishing boat and traveling in open ocean until you see a sign like that and then you put your anchor out and start fishing and catching. CLDR, KDMN and TBIO are three companies I own that have been taken over or in the process. Is NTNX next? NTNX transitioned their business model to one of subscription and took a hit for quite a few quarters, even losing its CEO founder. Present CEO came from competitor VMW because he saw opportunities otherwise why would he leave a great job? What reason...it may play out sooner than later, we shall see. IMHO. Patiently holding. God Bless and stay well."
"Nutanix has announced that National Takaful Company PJSC (Watania), an Abu Dhabi-based UAE insurance company, has chosen Nutanix Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) technology. The deployment resulted in a 60% reduction in the company’s data centre footprint and operation costs and increased IT stability, scalability, and flexibility. It has also significantly improved database management and performance of mission-critical applications, such as Watania’s core insurance platform, digital platform, and other peripheral systems such as HR & Payroll, Financial, and RPA, to name a few, with a direct impact on Watania’s user experience and business.Speaking about the need to overhaul Watania’s infrastructure, Mr. Martin Sebastian, CIO of Watania said, “IT is the backbone of our business, and we are continuously looking at enhancements to maintain its efficiency. The focus is on reducing downtime and maintaining a secure environment while embracing new technologies. Our objective is to guarantee effective operations to the business and better service to our customers.” “Prior to Nutanix, we were running a complex 3-tier architecture and our hardware was fairly outdated. This made managing our infrastructure time-consuming. We also faced the challenge of maintaining the availability of our mission-critical applications. The idea was to consolidate and future-proof the IT environment in order to make our operations more efficient, as well as save costs.”Mr. Sebastian and his team chose Nutanix after a thorough review of market-leading technologies from several vendors, which included reports from top research organisations.The Nutanix Services team and the vendor’s service partners made the transition to the Nutanix HCI platform simple and painless. Watania implemented Nutanix Prism, which enabled the company’s IT team to manage, run, and monitor the full IT infrastructure life cycle from a single interface. Furthermore, Nutanix Era was introduced, which is a software suite that automates and streamlines database management by introducing one-click ease and invisible operations to database deployment and lifecycle management (LCM).“For our database consolidation and operations, Nutanix Era has provided unique value. The solution’s ability to provision, monitor and protect our mission critical databases from one screen in a matter of minutes has saved a lot of operational time and cost,” says Mr. Sebastian.With Nutanix Era in place, the IT team can respond to crucial business application deployments in minutes rather than the weeks it used to take. With the rapid provisioning of new production/development databases, Era has reduced its time to deploy new projects. Watania benefits from a faster time-to-market for new ventures as a result of this. The Era ‘time machine’ function gives a higher SLA of recovery for databases at any point in time, allowing them to recover from any corruption that may occur quickly.“Nutanix has been an integral part of our digital transformation plan. We couldn’t be happier with the results we have seen so far and look forward to building on the existing relationship that we share with the company,” concludes Mr. Sebastian.********************************************************Hello everyone, this is Kathleen.

The house is finally clean. Positioned perfectly. Kudos to management and Bain.
Wow! What a day. Heavy column and big increase in price.
Based on a 10x multiple on 2.5bn revenue in 2024 I can see NTNX trade at 25bn in 3 years and that has upside to 30bn. CF breakeven this year and FCF positive next. Currently trades at 5x revenues on 25% billings growth and 20% revenue growth this year with plunging expenses as renewals rise!
Interesting take on Nutanix. If they are the OS of the data center look what Microsoft did controlling the PC playing field. Makes you wonder why security companies may have a concern.
"The analyst reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, with a price target of $64. Wall Street seems to be equally optimistic about Nutanix, with the consensus rating being a Strong Buy, based on eight Buys and one Hold. The average Nutanix price target of $50.67 indicates upside potential of 20.4%."
Anyone noticing the nice flag pattern developing over the past ten days?Accumulation is going nicely. A break above $44.50 down a short road?
"Nibbled a little more at 37.60 (the level DutchTrader suggested). my first nibble was at $41. I'm not a technicals person but at calendar 2022 revenue of $2 billion+ it trades at 4x which appears quite cheap, particularly considering a decrease in risk profile in the last 6 months and, once again, a real low hurdle for this quarter. Common sense is not ruling the daily gyrations currently so for now without company specific concerns I'm comfortable going against the grain with another 500 shares if it ever get to around $35. My total position has become uncomfortable though but I'm still in the green with great expectations."
"Wells Fargo Chief Investment Officer Darrell Cronk was on Squawk on the Street on CNBC on Thursday. He was asked whether the pullback in the stock market that has occurred in the last couple of weeks is over, and he stated, ""We think it's probably done."" He noted that we're now heading into the fourth quarter, which is seasonally strong for the market. He said the impact of Covid/Delta has reached its peak, and he expects strong job growth in Q4.In the April-May-June quarter, Wells Fargo more than doubled their position in NTNX with a buy of 190,000 shares. We saw some institutional buying of NTNX Thursday starting at around 11am, who knows, maybe it was Wells Fargo buying more shares."
"Mandy Xu from Credit Suisse was on Fast Money on CNBC on Thursday. She closely follows the options market. What she's seeing right now is that a lot of bearish bets have been made. She believes the downside risk to stocks is already priced in, or more than priced in, and she's expecting a rally into year end.In the April-May-June quarter, Credit Suisse bought around 90,000 shares of NTNX, and the Swiss financial services giant ended the quarter owning 400,000 shares. They've been buying a lot of shares, and they own a lot of shares. They obviously like the stock, and it wouldn't be a surprise if they were still buying now."
I took a peak at some of the partner survey aggregation results and they are very interesting. I suggest many of you get a paid preview from your local investment bank
Can’t control the stock price. Fundamentals awesome. Stock will respond.
I know a lot of people that put sell orders at $45 within my circle and they didn’t execute and are now bagholding. I also had some sells at $45 that didn’t go. I think the algos read this. Anyone here have sell limits at $45 that didn’t go?
"Evergrande is not necessarily all over, Mark."
"Invesco's Global Market Strategist Brian Levitt was on Bloomberg-The Close on Wednesday. He's bullish, recognizing that there has been some recent volatility which could continue for a while longer, but that this isn't the end of the bull market, which he believes has multiple years left.On March 31 Invesco had a small position in NTNX, then in the April-May-June quarter they came in and bought 171,000 shares, so it appears that they think that now is the time to be buying this stock."
Even with the bump up this stock should be trading well over $100.
"The future of work is hybrid. Nutanix (NASDAQ: NTNX), a leader in hybrid multicloud computing, and Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTXS) are joining forces to help their customers deliver it."
If you look back over the past 2 years (covid aside) NTNX has had a good bump post earnings and then tails off only to run up again 3 month later... This smells no different.
Strong day for NTNX relative to such a weak market overall. That’s a very good sign and really shows that institutional investors are comfortable owning the stock.
I think there are more millionaires self made with strong convictions. If you jump around too much it is hard to time the market and time opportunities. Depending on your portfolio I would buy more shares during the dip. When it does go backup again you are rewarded very well. My opinion.
"Nutanix results were excellent and it demonstrated the control that management an the board have now on the financial model and on its growth strategy. Free cash flow generation is in sight for H2 2022 and positive earnings the year after. Furthermore I have rarely seen a company that is disclosing as much to investors. They had to do it to restore investor confidence. Investors had plenty of data to build financial models. The company will keep beating expectations as there is great leeway in setting conservative guidance with the renewal flow increasing. We have been rewarded and the stock is now probably going to reach 60 within 6-12 months as the stock is rerated and revenue keeps growing at 20%. A 6.5 x revenue of 2 billions brings us to 13 billin valuation. One issue I see is the high level of stock-based compensation that amount to 80 million or 20% of revenue. It is probably warranted to attract top talent and in the case of Nutanix, it was very necessary. Hopefully in the future this percentage will decline as sales increases and the company becomes more mature."
"Wall street doing what it does best, spreading ""Evergande contagion fear"", two days from now it will all be forgotten. My neighbor is general contractor works weekends to keep up with the work. But we all need to be concerned about some Chinese investor that could bring the world to an end."
"All looks good for NTNX, top line revenue growth, subscription based growth, ACV growth, right direction in managing operating cost and big market opportunity ahead. BUT must make profit along the way to get noticed big time!"
Gang Darrell Duffie who is a well respected finance professor was giving an interview with yahoo finance earlier today and he says this bull market could continue into 2022 of the fed doesn’t indicate raising interest rates. Stanford university is located in the same state as Nutanix and their respective campuses are no more than 20 minutes apart. You can bet that the Stanford pension fund will be looking to add nutanix shares in their fund given the proximity over the next few months.
"I recommend that you read this article on the excellent Nextplatform site. It explains the difficult history of Nutanix and the very high expenses necessary to generate sales. It also express concerns about the very high stock option based compensation in the income statement that I referred to in my previous post. While all that is said is correct, I believe we are entering a new era for Nutanix. No more restructuring and continuous changes, just pure execution, renewals acceleration and top line growth of 20-25%. Is is because of Nutanix disappointing history that the stock is selling at such low discount of market cap to revenue ratio. The investment case is one of continuing revenue growth coupled with valuation expansion. In this scenario. the stock could double or triple in 12-24 months. https://www.nextplatform.com/2021/09/02/if-hyperconverged-storage-is-so-good-why-is-it-not-pervasive-and-profitable/"
"Needham & Company analyst Jack Andrews reiterated a Buy rating and $64 price target on Nutanix after attending the NEXT annual user conference where cloud optimization was at the forefront and could represent an incremental opportunity for the company.The analyst stated ""CIOs are looking to optimize their cloud investments, which should benefit NTNX. At the onset of the pandemic, organizations focused on resiliency and continuity investments to guarantee the operations of their business and productivity of workers (i.e. NTNX enabled Seattle Children's hospital to go from zero remote workers to 4,000 in mere months and powered its secure video conferencing systems). CIOs are optimizing their spending as they return to growth and bring back workloads from the cloud. To illustrate, a recent survey shows that ~33% of CIOs believe their workloads will be in the public cloud by 2024, down from 50% in the last survey previously."""
1) Nutanix has best HCI2) Nutanix built with latest technologies to enable new hybrid cloud (VMW not)3) Companies will have native apps reqs that have highest perf on Nutanix HCI4) Edge is coming5) Data center admins need a single pane...i.e. Nutanix6) red hat closes one gap7) citrix the other8) nutanix the OS of data centers.......whats that worth? where does Frame fit in to citrix partnership?
"A good presentation by NTNX at the Jefferies Software Conference on Tuesday.The IPO was 5 years ago with the HCI product - about 15 products have been added since then - they have a big market opportunity and they are the leader in that market - there will be some product announcements next week - security is built into everything - they are working closely with Palo Alto Networks and with Crowdstrike in security The Red Hat partnership was announced recently - this opens up a huge opportunity for NTNX in the cloud native space - there will be other partnership announcements that will be coming out ""in the near future"". These will be ""really good opportunities""."
"Marci McGregor, a strategist with Bank of America/Merrill, was on Bloomberg-The Close on Wednesday. She believes the bull market is still intact and that any pullback represents a buying opportunity. She likes both growth and value here and she's expecting a good Q3 earnings season to start in a couple of weeks. She said she wouldn't abandon tech stocks here - the economy is entering a capex cycle which will benefit tech companies selling to other businesses. Bank of America is a large NTNX shareholder, they had 1.5m shares on June 30, including over 30,000 shares purchased in Q2. NTNX is company that will definitely benefit as the economy enters a capex cycle, and it wouldn't be a surprise if Bank of America continued to buy the stock."

"With last quarter sales essentially growing almost 20% YoY (which will continue), is a 10x trailing sales multiple reasonable? It's at the low end of cloud software infra valuations it would seem. That currently puts us at a ~14B mkt cap or $64. That's Jack Andrews from Needhams current price target."
"Joe Davis, Vanguard's Head of Investment Strategy, was on Bloomberg - The Close on Friday and seemed reasonably confident about the outlook. He said he expects Covid/Delta to start to subside, and economic growth to hold up, and for the economy to be growing in a more sustainable way a year from now.NTNX is a stock Vanguard likes. They owned 19.2m shares as of June 30th, and they seem to add shares just about every quarter. In the April-May-June quarter, they bought 1.2m shares. Given what we heard in the most recent earnings conference call, and in the recent investor day presentation, I think it's likely that Vanguard will continue to add to their position in NTNX."
"Analysts are too focused on numbers like revenue , growth and profitability. All I heard on the conference call was their focus on growing revenue , opex focus and execution toward profits. I was hoping for more color on specifics of sales force productivity. Why not define linearity and chat about that for a bit ? sales cycle- what is and how does it work? What are the durations??channel education ramp and sales force ramp - are sellers actually selling or surfing the web?progress on implementing autonomous selling? Are the channel partners able to sell the product or do they rely on a nutanix buddy for assistance? Elevation implementation benefits or struggles? Whatever this is they didn’t even chat about it!Can anyone who knows anything about investing and finance explain why the call was focused on the quarterly results and the financials that make it up and not a meet and greet focused more on the above stuff?"
"My take on Nutanix is since Bain's involvement, new CEO Rajiv Ramaswami, and with the new board members we can clearly see execution at Enterprise scale for Nutanix eco-system. This is creating stronger market opportunities to distribute Nutanix verical portfolio's along with the base of the Nutanix Cloud Platform. I am humbled to have invested in Nutanix with such great leadership quality that will pay dividends for years to come. I feel longs are in great hands and the word about Nutanix will keep spreading to more and more investors as they learn more about this great company. Kudos to everyone who has helped contribute to such a fine quarter for Nutanix as a collective team \ partnership."
"US hyperconverged solutions firm Nutanix is increasing its investments in Latin America, mostly in the hiring of technical support, sales and consultancy personnel. The hiring drive has been made to cope with growing demand from companies for data storage and processing, the firm’s Latin America VP, Andres Hurtado, told BNamericas.Nutanix is a major player in the offering of hyperconvergence systems for enterprise cloud. According to the company, its solutions are present in over 15,000 datacenter projects in the world. Hyperconvergence allows IT operations to be simplified by eliminating traditional silos and allowing storage, computing, networking and virtualization to be managed with the same hardware.More than 90% of Nutanix’s revenues currently come from subscriptions, including in Latin America, although the public sector tends to still prefer licenses, Hurtado added.Headquartered in California, the company has Latin American offices in São Paulo, Bogotá and Mexico City. Hurtado said Nutanix is seeing a growing interest from clients in the region for hybrid cloud (public and private cloud), and he expects the hybrid cloud business to take off in 2022.Hyperconvergence solutions in Latin America have so far been mainly applied to private cloud and on-premise datacenters, according to the executive. Nutanix has global partnerships to integrate its hyperconvergence solutions with public cloud players such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.The company's main customers in the region come from the traditional verticals of banking, government, manufacturing and retail, with healthcare having emerged as a new business area due to the COVID-19 pandemic."
"this quarter should reap benefits from the IBM partnership....customers wanted it, which means high demand with quick sales - next quarter maybe the real blowout!"
Be careful to listen to people like Chris. I think the 1% along with Kramer can directly influence those who can capitalize off being a professional trader. The problem I always see myself is they provide the message late to sell and then when people sell the next day the 1 % buys back at a discount. It is too hard to time the market is my opinion. Stay long Nutanix. It is a game otherwise like Vegas where the odds are against you. Good Luck Everyone!
Average price target is 48.89 now. Should stall as we get close to that...until next earnings. We've had a nice run up.
"Fidelity's strategist Jurrien Timmer (his actual title is ""Director of Global Macro"") was on Squawk on the Street on CNBC on Wednesday. He said that the early part of the bull market is now concluded and the stock market is now entering ""mid-cycle"", so what this means is that we will be in mid-cycle for a year or possibly several years, then eventually we will enter late cycle, but this is a year or more away.Fidelity is the largest shareholder in NTNX. As of June 30 they owned 30.6m shares, and this includes 1.7m shares that they bought during April-May-June. They have consistently added shares quarter after quarter and I see no reason for this to stop. On Sept 1, NTNX said, ""We drove top-line improvement while carefully managing expenses, leading to a substantially improved bottom-line performance compared to our prior Fiscal year. The underlying momentum in the business gives us confidence in providing strong guidance for the first quarter of our fiscal 22. Sales were strong throughout the entire quarter. There was no unusual deal slippage, and we built a backlog during the quarter."" Fidelity sees market conditions as positive and business is going quite well at NTNX. When Fidelity files their 13F for the July-Aug-Sept quarter a month from now, my guess is that this will show that they once again added to their position in NTNX."
Happy to buy at this level! NTNX is a gem trading like a lump of coal...
Buy this dip. Possibly showing a profit this quarter?
"NTNX trading below 5x EV/forward sales, with 25% underlying growth and accelerating as well as reaching FCF positivity over the next few quarters according to mgmt. If the stock keeps trading at such low levels for much longer I guess an acquisition by a competitor or PE is quite possible."
"Northern Trust Chief Investment Officer Katie Nixon was on Bloomberg-The Close on Tuesday. She's not wildly bullish but did say that the stock market has some tailwinds heading into 2022. Northern Trust owned a million shares of NTNX as of June 30, so it's likely that they've been one of the investors buying as the stock has moved higher recently."
"Well above average volume, with no apparent news..."
Doubled up. This stock should be over $50 by now
"Gabriela Santos, the strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, was on Closing Bell on CNBC on Wednesday. She stated that the stock market right now is dealing with some temporary issues such as Delta/Covid. She said she expects these issues to be resolved over the next couple of months, and then after that economic growth can remain above trend and stocks can continue to move higher for another couple of years. JP Morgan bought over 100,000 shares of NTNX in the April-May-June quarter, and they had a total of around 750,000 shares as of June 30. NTNX has been moving higher lately and my guess is that JP Morgan is participating. I think they're continuing to buy in the current quarter and will keep on doing so after that."
Just raised my position in NTNX!

It’s very possible that ntnx customers are getting cold feet and canceling their nutanix contracts
"Great company, great stock. Long NTNX!"
"Where are the naysayers now?! After yesterday's ER, I am more bullish on NTNX than I have ever been!Great to be on the right side of the Nutanix story!"
The EG story seems like a pretty big contract and they'll have to expand their use of NTNX as they expand.
My belief - Short Sellers are keeping the price down due to options expiration.
"External risks- guys no one has spoken about external risks to the business growth. What do you guys think about big 3/4 public cloud vendors offering HCI, and more importantly multi cloud support with on/off perm hurting Nutanix business."
What is going on? Any explanation?
It's been a terrible month ... but a great year :-)
why this sell out?
"Nutanix has unleashed a slew of new products, partnerships and solution provider-focused initiatives to take channel sales to the next level, says Nutanix’s worldwide channel chief Christian Alvarez.Talk about the opportunities ahead with Nutanix’s new reseller partnership with Supermicro?Supermicro has been one of our contract manufacturers that has been doing a great job of building the Nutanix NX platform, and we’ve gotten even closer with them from a research and development perspective.During these discussions with Supermicro, we identified some great opportunities together where there’s some great synergies that we can both identify and leverage—and that’s their customer base and their own partner ecosystem. By basically having the same folks that do an amazing job manufacturing the Nutanix NX compute platform, they can now turn around and resell it within their own programs and their own partner ecosystem.Nutanix is going to benefit because we’re going to be able to continue to uncover new Earth by expanding our reach. Supermicro is an incredible company. They have a global presence. They’ve had incredible growth. They produce a very high quality product. … As we continue to become more focused with our strategic partners, like Supermicro, they’re now able to resell and tap into their great partner ecosystem that they have and the thousands of customers that Supermicro has around the world.What does this new Supermicro partnership bring to the channel table?Supermicro gets to continue doing what they do best: manufacturing. They have a great sales workforce that’s global with some incredible accounts. Supermicro will now be able to take us into those incredible new accounts and this is a better together. But at the end of the day, Nutanix is going to support those customers on the Nutanix NX platform sold by Supermicro.So Supermicro’s customers of today and tomorrow will be able to benefit and enjoy our 90-plus Net Promoter Score rating. We are absolutely obsessed with customer satisfaction. Supermicro going out selling with support from Nutanix, I believe it’s a perfect partnership.Partners like HPE with GreenLake have just been spectacular and is growing. Lenovo there’s a bunch of new things that we’re going to be rolling out with them. We’re also super thrilled about the recent Red Hat partnership. Our friends over at Red Hat are thrilled, but more importantly, our partners and customers are really thrilled with the future of Red Hat and Nutanix working together and certifying our hypervisor on Red Hat.Is the new Nutanix solutions with Red Hat now generally available for all partners to sell?It’s absolutely ready.

This is a great example of Nutanix and Red Hat listening to our customers, listening to our partners, and developing a strategic meat on the bones partnership to actually go out and deliver use cases and business outcomes based on what customers and partners have been asking. So yes, partners can absolutely work with their counterparts and their points of contact today in both companies."

"Lots of investors nibbling, munching and chomping on discounted shares. But who is truly gobbling?"
One of these quarters will be the big surprise at the new subscription model takes foot. Is this the quarter? They hinted that we’re still a couple of quarters away but we can always hope.
"Hey gang. Kathleen needs a day off so I decided to fill in…Here goes…: yesterday nutanix in a filing announced that it’s cfo Dustin Williams has sold $1.6millon in shares. Now that these scarce shares are available for public consumption, institutions previously unable to secure shares will have a chance to line up for dustin’s shares. Institutions buy tech stocks like nutanix because some guy on CNBC yesterday said he was bullish on the market and sees stocks going up later this year. Now with the executive sales out of the way, these shares will be in stronger hands and we should go higher."
A matter of time…new highs coming
Nutanix call volume above normal and directionally bullish.
2.759 times ave volume.
"I have said it many times before, NTNX will be denied to establish itself as a disruptor leader in hybrid category in sass and platform, one can attribute any number of factors for this strange phenomenon for a stock, but few things stand out, the early impression of fumbling the marketing of its technology, inability to explain to market in a simpler fashion what the technology does and of course previous CEOs mismanagement of the overall business strategy. All of these , imho, has always dragged this stock own from achieving its true potential!"
Profitability is what will move the dial
Seems like some people just woke up with regards to NTNX and realized the company has a bright future in front of it and so does the stock!
This is a new NTNX. In all those years I have never been more confident buying the dips than today!
"Ntnx has an expensive sales process/channel, overstaffed, if they just slim it down a lot we will see a profitable money making machine. The fundamentals, offering, positioning and everything is good, but someone hired a bit too fast and set too low quotas. I believe strongly in the future if they just fix this."
NTNX is surging with 3x avg. volume. Amazing!
I cannot wait until Nutanix is ready for Clusters on Azure. Then we will have two Gov Clouds that can be a part of the Nutanix eco-system with a far superior Multi-Cloud platform to adjoin all clouds and all workloads. Azure recently announced they have a Gov Cloud similar to Amazon.
It’s only a matter of time. Stay long and you will be rewarded.

"Shorts really got roasted the last 30 days. I think they all thought after the OTR article that it would be an easy money to short. Had to pay as high as 44 for on the squeeze. From a low of 33 to a high of 43 on the close. The volumes have been very high as shorts try to beat this down. Shorts will have their tantrum hoping others will join them that's the only way they can keep it down. They eventually will have to buy it back. Institutions have 80%, I know they lend for shorting and trade options but in the longer run they still own them and want to make profits. At some point share will become scare I think it is still another quarter or so out. I'm holding long so at this point it's watch and learn."
Keep saying…buy the dips and be patient. Once they should even a penny of profitability it’s off to the races
It’s unbelievable that we are below 40. Needham for example has it at BUY with PT 64 and upgraded NTNX just recently. Nutanix has announced some decent quarters recently with lots of positive revenue and earnings revisions by analysts. What needs to happen for the stock to go up?! I don’t get it!
"Chris, the CRO responsible for bringing back the company from the brink is leave on 31 October. The company revenue is on expected line as shared on investors day. - this is as per the latest sec report.

"Nutanix announced new security capabilities and teased some still-under-development ones including zero trust during at its annual Next event.In an interview with SDxCentral after his opening keynote, CEO Rajiv Ramaswami said this doesn’t signal a shift in Nutanix’s strategy. “We are not a security company per se, but we are an infrastructure company that will build in and continue to add security features into our Nutanix Cloud platform,” he said.These security features focus on the applications Nutanix builds, the data it manages, and network traffic it has visibility into, Ramaswami explained.At the event, Nutanix launched the latest version of its AOS software, which now includes a network virtualization service on the AHV hypervisor called Flow Networking. The vendor says this simplifies networking and makes it easier for enterprises and services providers to create virtual private clouds. And several of the new and upcoming security capabilities center on Flow.Flow Networking allows customers to create virtual private clouds (VPCs) in software and also provides virtual private network (VPN) capabilities to extend customers’ virtual networks to public and private cloud infrastructure. “Because we run on bare metal across public clouds and on-prem hardware, you can use the same policy, the same platform, to create VPCs wherever you are running your workloads,” Ramaswami said.The vendor is using this same Flow technology to develop automated microsegmentation policies that Ramaswami said can help customers implement a zero-trust security strategy. This is an upcoming feature, and it will be part of a new Flow Security Central platform that is also still under development, that uses a machine-learning based policy engine to analyze network traffic and then recommend security policies to protect virtual-machine workloads against potential attacks.It follows Nutanix’s “mantra of simplification,” Ramaswami explained. “We look at the network traffic, we know who’s talking to whom,” he said. “We create an automatic set of rules in terms of policies without the user having to go figure out who should be talking to whom or who should not be talking to whom, and then instantiate it inside the infrastructure.”Nutanix also announced an upcoming integration with Qualys’ vulnerability management detection and response service that will allow customers to streamline security patching efforts. This, combined with new capabilities in Nutanix’s Files storage software for unstructured data, can better detect and prevent against more than 4,000 known ransomware attack signatures, Ramaswami said.The new AOS 6 software also adds disaster recovery capabilities that allow customers to use the public cloud as a secondary site, enable automatic failover in case of a disaster, and provide end-to-end encryption for disaster recovery traffic.“That’s really what we do for security, and we’ll continue to enhance this wherever we can over time to make it simpler for our customers to manage their security policy,” Ramaswami said."
"Chris Kaddaras leaving the company is a big deal. Bigger than the ceo leaving as everything related to pipeline, growth and revenue discipline has his fingerprints on this. Big loss and time to sell the stock and reset and find something else."
With top-line growth >20% going forward NTNX deserves to trade at 8x forward sales at least!
Nice to ffinally see some revenue growth.. almost touching 400M. Hopefully they are doing 2B in annual revenues by 2022.

price doesnt make sense
Glad I added to my position into the weakness over the last few days. Totally unwarranted IMO.NTNX is in great shape and the path to profitability now appears to be clearer than it has ever been since I started following the company some years ago.
"Interesting day, banks are up or neutral with all the concern perpetrated in the news. Finance stocks are usually more reliable in telling the tale. Food stocks are up a bit. Tech heavy NASDAQ is being shorted. I can only think the faithful have no faith and stop losses are being hit. Hard to believe budget problems only affect tech."

"HPE CEO Antonio Neri was on Tech Check on CNBC on Friday. He stated that to HPE, 2022 is looking like a very strong year for digital transformation. HPE is one of NTNX's most important partners, and NTNX expects its partnerships to be a big factor in the company's growth, so this is good news for NTNX. As stated on the NTNX web site:HPE customers receive the same Nutanix compute, storage, virtualization, and network functionality, combined with the company's intuitive, consumer-grade management that has made Nutanix one of the industry’s most popular hyperconverged solutions."
Just ran out to get a chipotle burrito and one of the workers yelled out ‘bubanix’. Given that this rhymes with nutanix no doubt he and his co workers are considering purchases of nutanix shares in the coming weeks and months
"David Lebovitz, a strategist with JP Morgan, was on Squawk on the Street on Monday. His outlook for stocks for the next couple of weeks is that the market will be ""choppy"". Looking out to the medium to longer term, he said that the picture for 2022 still looks very strong. Short term traders are selling today, but longer term investors are using this pullback to buy. As of June 30, JP Morgan owned around 750,000 shares of NTNX, and it wouldn't be a surprise if they were adding more shares today."

Nutanix (NTNX) analyst consensus has changed today from Moderate Buy to Strong Buy.Data is based on 10 ranked analysts that rated the stock in the last 3 months.
To quote Goldman Sachs from its analysis in July 2017: Nutanix is a 'once-in-a-decade' opportunity. Seems like this assessment of NTNX is more appropriate than ever before!
Another strong day. Mid-50s sounds reasonable in the short term.
Down 4.38% since going public.
"Interesting holders Vanguard, GI and FMR, all three have almost as much money invested as Bain. Along with Black Rock and Clear Bridge amount to a third of the shares. Follow the money."

I think this partnership is going to generate significant revenues for NTNX."

"The bear case has always been that Nutanix profitability was mediocre and that to generate 1$ of sales, the company had to spend 1$ in sales and marketing (exaggerating a bit here). The NextPlatform article that I mentioned in my previous post affirms that if key a technology is pervasive, clients will come to buy the solution and you will not have to spend as much on S&M. No one can argue that sales and marketing expenses are too high more than 10 years after Nutanix created the HCI market. There are few reasons why it was the case. First when you move to 100% public cloud with Azure or AWS, you probably don’t need Nutanix. Many companies chose this road, and it was probably the fastest segment of cloud computing. Second came the competition from VMware, a much larger company with strong links with Fortune 100 companies. Thirdly the many company’s restructurings (hardware to software, license deals to subscription, and TCV based to ACV based focus to lower average maturity of contracts) depressed revenue and made the S&M expenses look greater in percentage of revenue. Big prospective clients saw that the company was bleeding money and some of them were reluctant to do business with Nutanix as its financials were not great. Bain Capital saw it very clearly when they decided to invest 800 million. They realized that to the road to profitability was to increase the renewal business and focus on portable growth. They then hired a very seasoned and respected CEO able to set up a strategy and focus on execution. The June analyst day was the watershed event in regard of regaining investors’ confidence. They demonstrated in a very convincing way, how much they would grow and when they would reach profitability. Those who believed that the company would miss expectations in the last quarter did not properly realize how much effort was put to set up realistic and achievable goals. Therefore, I believe the company will continue to surprise on the upside as guidance will be ALWAYS conservative. The company suffered too much in the past few years of lack of credibility due to poor execution and constant changes. Bain Capital would make sure that this will not happen again. As far as the market dynamic for HCI, I believe the growth of multi clouds will benefit Nutanix as companies will have some of their applications and solutions in AWS and Azure as well as on premises or in-house. This plays on Nutanix's strength. In conclusion the stock is on its way to double in price as both multiple of market cap to revenue increases and revenues reach the 2 billion mark."
Back at 5x EV/forward sales. With 25% underlying growth and mgmt. projecting free cash flow breakeven in the 2nd half of calendar 2022 such a low valuation I believe is not justified.
"Noah Blackstein from Dynamic Funds was on Squawk Box on CNBC on Thursday. The following is taken from his page on the Dynamic web site: The world is changing. Technological advances and shifting consumer preferences are redefining how companies do business.Biotech, Fintech, cloud computing, big data… Opportunity abounds, and in these rapidly evolving markets the key is knowing where, when, and how to take advantage of it.For over two decades, Senior Portfolio Manager Noah Blackstein has taken advantage of market disruptors; companies who have changed our world through innovation. His ability to recognize driving trends has proven strong**********************************************************On CNBC this morning Blackstein said he's expecting the market to rally into year end. He likes tech stocks right now, especially software companies that are involved with the digital transformation that is now happening everywhere. Dynamic will be filing their 13F with the SEC sometime in the next month, so it will be interesting to see if they're buying any NTNX."
"Getting away from all the finance for a while, the bottom line is the company needs a viable, sustainable and growing product.Nutanix is positioning itself more and more to allow companies to keep their leverage in the cloud. The pure public cloud is not the end game as some might think. If a company has all it's processing in AWS, Google or the like your company will be held hostage by them for cost and software. The idea of public, private or multicloud is where a company wants to be. Even though your company may want public cloud to augment services your company still may want a multi vendor approach. Even with that your company may still want to keep a private cloud for more leverage or other reasons. This is where Nutanix can be key, being able to move workloads between clouds but also making all clouds appear as one. Keeping the leverage so your vendors don't ""own you"" as they say. Even what is more appealing is the upcoming concept of have tools to manage the infrastructure. So it's automating the automation sort of speak. It's a cost to built out the infrastructure and services but a company want's to limit it's cost in monitoring and managing it. Nutanix has another strong point here to allow visibility of all the clouds at one point.Any comments about this would be helpful."
"October 8, 2021FREMONT, Calif. & CLEARWATER, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TD SYNNEX, a global distributor and solutions aggregator for the IT ecosystem announced their legacy company, Tech Data, has been awarded Nutanix’s 2021 Americas Distributor of the Year award.

Poll. Honest question. Of the long termers and deep pockets who is trading this? Buy and holding or adding dips? I have always been trained to trim on pops and buy dips since getting burned 2 years ago. Admittedly my covered calls on 30% of my position was a bad move
Dustin Williams solid a wad of shares
"Marko Kolanovic at JP Morgan, one of the most widely followed strategists on Wall St, is out with a note on his market outlook: ""We believe the recent pullback is an opportunity to buy the dip."" In the April-May-June quarter, JP Morgan bought 106,000 shares of NTNX, and they owned a total of 746,000 shares as of June 30. They like the stock and will most likely continue to buy."
Needham analyst Jack Andrews maintains Nutanix with a Buy and raises the price target from $61 to $64.
The question is why would a CFO of a company allegedly on the upswing sell the stock so low? A few weeks ago he could have sold this stock above $40? I don't see how anyone could view these recent sales as a positive. Help me out here folks what am I missing?
"How low can it go? Growing 25% and turning FCF positive over the next few quarters. Rule of thumb says valuation should be about half of underlying growth - at least for companies with positive cash flows. Yet, NTNX is currently trading at 4.8x forward sales. You have to be nuts to sell your shares way below what is considered normal!"
Just took the opportunity to load up like crazy. This is probably the best chance to buy since March last year when everyone was panicking. Now we have MUCH better fundamentals and a much better CEO quite frankly!
"anybody knowing tech have a take on this....Nutanix is still behind the cloud curve,” said Zeus Kerravala, principal analyst at ZK Research. “They’re just putting a multi-cloud strategy in place where leading enterprises are moving to distributed clouds. That is: a single, logical cloud that spans public cloud, private clouds, and edge locations. Their version of multi-cloud is about a decade behind where their competition, such as Dell and HPE and VMware are"
Articles and mentioned by silicon commentators circling that nutanix will be left behind of the hybrid evolution as their partnerships are not tight enough and their offerings while solid are not complete. Some suggesting years behind true hybrid cloud
So many people wanting everything tomorrow. I think they all have Tesla envy. AMZN was at sub 50 for 10 years. NVDA was at sub 15 forever. If I had just bought a few shares an put them aside I would have made pretty penny. If you expect it to go to 100 next week maybe it's time to go somewhere else with your money. I'm just holding for now while it gets traded to no end. Next 2 quarters should be interesting with the subscription model moving along and gaining partners. There are no guaranties in life for anything but opportunity. Your mileage may very.
So it seems like nutanix has shaken the JV status in their own reputation in growing to the varsity level based on the past year’s performance but now needs to shake the JV status in analyst coverage. That DB analyst that moderated the conference was a joke and seemed like an intern. Seemed like he asked the same lame questions that the company has addressed over and over. Half the shrubs including me could have given a better more insightful q&a. How do these guys get these jobs and why isn’t nutanix aligned with more of the software centric folks?
"Nutanix .Next user conference just ended, attendees bullish and buying."
"Starting to look like maybe the stock market correction is over. One of Wall Street's more widely followed strategists, Tom Lee, is out with a note on Friday, ""The case is strengthening for a year end rally."" CNBC's Chief Market Commentator Mike Santoli said Friday that he believes stocks can work higher - technical indicators show a bottoming process has been completed, Covid/Delta is receding, and we're about to enter into a seasonally strong period for the market. Bank of Montreal's strategist Brian Belski was on the Halftime Report on CNBC on Friday and he's bullish on the market overall. Additionally he said that tech is his favorite sector to invest in for the next 3-5 years.Bank of Montreal had a tiny position in NTNX on March 31, then over the next 3 months they bought 67,000 shares, so they're becoming more positive on the stock. Their strategist is bullish and likes tech, so it wouldn't be a surprise if they continue to buy."
Bought the dip in NTNX!
"Wow, NTNX is about to go through the roof! Great to stock to own from a fundamental and technical perspective."
NTNX popping on huge volume!
"Stock is a bit of paradox as of late. Just about ever article has something good to say about Nutanix. Partnerships, expanding product lines and moving with the main stream technology customers need. The Next conference was very positive and Nutanix showed off it's products. And yet it's down when most tech is rebounding. Whole thing stinks of hedge fund shenanigans with such low trading volume. MDB with a 32 billion market cap with revenues of 500 million plus it lost 4 bucks per share. Not selling anytime soon, price is going to rocket as losses are being cut dramatically."
"I was skeptical of this quarter's earnings after I realized that $NTNX was reporting after $VMW.Now, I feel this earning is implying ""Get used to winning more regularly."". :)"
Own a portfolio of >20 different stocks and probably follow >100 companies quite closely on the stock market overall. None of those is as underrated as NTNX. It’s truly astonishing!
NTNX is the biggest position in my portfolio and my highest conviction long. Continue to buy the dips.
"The JP Morgan strategist Marko Kolanovic was on Closing Bell on CNBC on Wednesday. He's raised his year end S&P target from 4,600 to 4,700, and has put out a preliminary 2022 target of 5,000. He sees Covid/Delta now past its peak and believes this will give the market a boost. Kolanovic is one of the most widely followed strategists on Wall St, so this call could help keep the rally going in NTNX. As of June 30, JP Morgan owned around 750,000 shares of NTNX."
Goes down so much easier than up? Hopefully a profit this quarter will change that!
Great conference call and even though confidence is high for 2022 they will continue to under forecast and over deliver. Good to be long.
"Short interest for Sept 30 is just out. Now becoming obvious that NTNX is under attack by the shorts.short interestJuly 30 - 5.84m sharesAug 13 - 5.96Aug 31 - 6.22Sept 15 - 6.82Sept 30 - 7.92So an increase of over 2m shares of short selling in only 2 months. Not sure what is causing this as the company reported a strong quarter only 6 weeks ago. They're adding customers, selling more products to the customers, and taking share in the market. As the fundamentals of the business continue to be good, at some point the share price will start to move higher and the shorts will have to get out. Short covering could give this stock a major boost going into year end."
Where are OTR Global analysts hiding since their bad call pre-earnings. since they are covering Nutanix they should be obligated to their clients to react to earnings. Yet silence.
Smart $ knows something. Earnings were great. Everything moving in the right direction. Makes no sense?

Gang Kaddaras departure is concerning on many levels. Granted he be poached for a cxo job but with what we see in front would be very lucrative for kaddaras and he has a front row seat. After all this hard work why not reap the reward? Something isn’t right and retail is missing something big.

I struggle with the multiple on this one. It's around 5x now and is probably due for a rerate. Going forward will it stay sub 10? What's the difference between NTNX and some of the other SaaS companies with high multiples?
Did anyone noticed the sec filing about Kris leaving. There is an additional note to say the revenue of the current quarter is in line with investor day. I think it says a few things 1. They are confident in their forecast 2. They are trying to minimise any impact of Kris’ news 3. The stock should go higher when they declare the result of the current quarter.

Federated's year end target for the S&P had been 4,500, but they raised it to 4,800.On March 31, Federated had a small position in NTNX, but then in the second quarter they came in and bought 417,000 shares, so it looks like they think now is the time to buy this stock. We saw some institutional buying on Wednesday, with a large block of shares trading around 2:30pm. Who knows, maybe Federated is once again adding to their position."

Close above 40 is a huge milestone! High likelihood for further upwards movement in the short term.
Any objective perspective on the relative weakness today?
"Kristina Hooper, the Chief Market Strategist at Invesco, was on Bloomberg - The Close on Monday. In the April-May-June quarter, Invesco more than doubled their position in NTNX with a buy of 171,000 shares. Hooper said technology stocks could see some short term volatility, but that she likes the sector medium to longer term. Invesco is probably another investor that has been adding to their position in NTNX lately."
chief revenue officer also resigned recently. Could be due to pooooooor revenue in the upcoming earnings. Be careful here.
"Great report! Significant beat on key metrics - especially top-line growth, which by far is the most important metric for NTNX. I like what I see!"
One of the only tech names that seems to be down today. Not sure why?
"Allesio de Longis from Invesco was on Bloomberg - The Close, on Tuesday. He's recommending buying this dip in the market. In the April-May-June quarter, Invesco more than doubled their position in NTNX with a buy of 171,000 shares. Nothing's changed about the outlook for NTNX, so Invesco now has the opportunity to add to their position at a more attractive price."
"Nutanix acquired Frame 3 years ago, mostly with stock valued at $57. There was a 3 year holdback arrangement of $36M for key employees to be retained. I don't know, but I would imagine Nutanix would want to make up the difference based on the current $42 stock price? I hope Nutanix will be able to keep these people.Any commentary is appreciated. Thanks!"
And that’s the moment when you slide a buy out rumor. What a stampede it would be
You know I know there's a lot of institutional investors stocking up on Nutanix stock but let's face it this stock is not moving. It couldn't even sustain itself at $40+. I can come back to this blog in two years and the momentum will never change.
Looks like Q1 FY22 guide would be $393.75 using 2.25 ratio from Dustin in CC. I think $1.75 billion for FY22 could be in reach. That's a lot more than current estimates. $3 billion could come in FY24. Should be $100+ in CY2023. Not too shabby if it works out that way.
"If Citrix is looking at potentially getting bought and Nutanix just partnered heavily with them, what does this mean for NX?"
"Nutanix is releasing enhancements to its AOS operating system and Era database-management service designed to make it easier for enterprises to manage data, workloads, and business-continuity security tools in hybrid cloud environments via software-defined networking capabilitiesAOS and Era are both components of the Nutanix Cloud Platform. AOS 6, the new version of Nutanix's hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) software, is designed to simplify network management across multiple clouds and enable enterprises to build virtual private clouds. Nutanix announced the updates at its NEXT event this week.A new network-virtualization feature, called Flow Networking, has VPN capabilities that allow customers to extend their virtual networks to public and private clouds without the need of dedicated physical appliances, allowing for software-defined network (SDN) management. The new feature is built on Nutanix's AHV hypervisor and lets network administrators manage hybrid-cloud infrastructure through a single interface.Flow Networking can be used to manage enterprise database workloads on premises and in the cloud, according to Holger Mueller, vice president and principal analyst at Constellation Research. “They can re-use automation assets (software solutions) across that compute plane - giving them flexibility, compliance, performance, and cost savings,” Mueller said.With 62% of enterprise workloads globally still on premises, it will take some time to move the majority of these to the public cloud, said IDC India research director Sharath Srinivasamurthy.“Organizations are looking at hybrid multicloud strategy depending on the workload, as it offers more flexibility,"" Srinivasamurthy said. ""Hence, a common control plane to manage seamless operations across different environments is extremely critical, especially when organizations are looking at extending the boundaries of their virtual networks across public and private clouds. As the world moves towards software defined everything, reducing dependency on specialized hardware not only enables cost savings but also helps in providing cloud-like agility across all environments.”AOS 6 includes multicoud business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) capabilities and automated zero-trust security policies. The BCDR capabilities allow organizations to take advantage of the public cloud as a secondary site, offer native metro clustering support for the built-in AHV hypervisor enabling automatic failover in the event of a disaster, and end-to-end encryption capabilities for disaster-recovery traffic.IDC’s Srinavasamurthy said COVID-19 forced many organizations to look at public cloud as an option for disaster recovery. Utilizing the public cloud as a disaster-recovery option helps customers to keep their operational costs under control, he noted.Nutanix also introduced a disaster-recovery dashboard to allow organizations to check their disaster recovery configuration and status across primary and secondary sites.Its Nutanix Cloud Platform with AOS 6 will allow for microsegmentation, a method of creating secure zones in data centers and cloud deployments that can isolate workloads from one another and secure them individually through a machine learning-based planning engine that analyzes network traffic and recommends security policies to protect virtual-machine workloads against potential attacks.Nutanix also announced automated zero-trust security policies along with a partnership with security vendor Qualys to automate threat detection and manage vulnerabilities with machine learning.“The need to create and run microsegmentation policies based on network traffic and recommending security policies to protect workloads based on machine learning, what we call AIRO (analytics, response, intelligence, and orchestration), is the need of the hour. In this context, Nutanix’s integration with Qualys’ vulnerability management, detection, and response (VMDR) solution is a step in the right direction,” said Srinavasamurthy.Era updated for multicloud data managementNutanix updated its database management service, Era, which is used to manage popular database engines such as PostgeSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle Databases across hybrid and multicloud environments.Nutanix CTO Rajiv Mirani said Era, which is available now, can be used by customers to scale database storage online with a single click and has support for role-based access control facilitating security and compliance. Era now supports multiregion failover capabilities.Constellation’s Mueller said that more databases are running than ever before and this consumes more expensive resources. “A solution such as Era makes it easier for CXOs to run databases and manage operations,” he said.Further upcoming updates include Nutanix Data Lens, a cloud service to help customers understand their data better, whether it resides on premises or in the cloud."
It would be interesting to know to what extent the max exodus at nutanix would happen as the Kaddaras news becomes widespread. Would nutanix be able to re employ the hundreds / and thousands of employees that could flee behind Chris? Only time will tell

"On Monday Wells Fargo market strategist Tracie McMillion was on Bloomberg - The Close. In the short term she's got some concerns about higher inflation, higher interest rates, and higher taxes, but she thinks longer term the market will work through these issues and continue to move higher.In the April-May-June quarter, Wells Fargo more than doubled their position in NTNX with a buy of 190,000 shares. They obviously like the stock right now and are probably continuing to buy in the current quarter."
More and more institutional investors will come in and buy this gem. Just have some patience and don't sell your shares too cheap.

"Another rough day in the market, comparable to the one we had on Sept 20, which the market bounced right back from. Some of Wall Street's top strategists remain bullish. Tom Lee, who was J.P. Morgan’s Chief Equity Strategist from 2007 to 2014, and who now has his own firm, was on the Halftime Report on CNBC on Tuesday. He pointed out that when's there turmoil over policy in Washington, it's almost always a great buying opportunity for stocks. He said that he thought that the impact of rising interest rates on tech stocks has been exagerated. He expects stocks to rally into year end.Marko Kolanovic, the current strategist at J.P. Morgan, is out with a note on Tuesday: ""We remain of the view that any weakness should be used to add to equities."" During the April-May-June quarter, J.P. Morgan bought around 100,000 shares of NTNX, and they ended the quarter owning around 750,000 shares. They're still positive on the stock market and will probably continue to add to the stocks they like."
With the Nasdaq down 300 points on Monday everyone is looking for a voice of experience to provide some perspective so CNBC had former Cisco CEO John Chambers on Tech Check today. Chambers said that he expects tech stocks to have a great decade in the 2020s and that there is a high probability that the Nasdaq will be up a year from now.Keep in mind that Cisco is a NTNX partner. The following is from the Cisco web site:Cisco Secure is a Nutanix Elevate Technical Alliances partner and is excited to have earned the 2021 Nutanix Technology Alliances New Partner of the Year award. This award recognizes the commitment of Cisco Secure and Nutanix to support the growing number of joint customers protecting Nutanix’s Hyper Converged Infrastructure (HCI) with Cisco Secure Firewall.
"Did anyone attend DB conference yesterday? My take away RR emphasising his focus on top line and bottom line, and managing expenses, his confidence of growing at 25% for the next few years… sounds good"
Piper Sandler conference doesn’t reveal much new but you get to compare the JV vs Varsity team in terms of analyst coverage. Jim @ Piper Sandler is laser focused on nutanix and really gets the story. He understands how important the Redhat opportunity is and also where nutanix is weak on some of their point solutions. Karbon was never supposed to be the Kubernetes of choice which is why nutanix realized that combining their core with open shift is a best of breed hybrid solution. If sold and pitched well it’s a game changer. While hard to understand Thomas on the product side is really brilliant. Love to hear more from him as he is leading the solution selling at scale.
"This was a 4 year long storm that very much tested my faith in this company. However, I think that the last two reports clearly show that the transition is complete and that they’re poised to build on the new foundation. I think the stock will return to the high 40s by year end."
"There are some very old school Analysts out there that do not understand the digital transformation age and large technology companies in general. Nutanix who has been in the market for over ten years and has a very solid path to profitability. Nutanix is coming out of its early stages of evolving into a full-scale subscription Nutanix Cloud Platform Company. I do not understand some of the lower end forecasts for Nutanix. I mention this because when you compare Nutanix to other up and coming companies that have extreme multiples with no profitability and they do not even have a road map to profitability, so I ask why to myself? I see some Analysts at the low end changing their models from hold to buy all of a sudden but still with very low one-year forecast price targets for Nutanix, not considering the maturity of the company. This is fine with me because I will buy more Nutanix stock at a bargain. I am mentioning this to those who want to get in now and reward yourself early. I hate to see anyone miss this opportunity and wait for some of the old school Analysts to raise their price targets. Most of all, do not listen to the research company OTR in the future. My Gosh, It scares me how a research company like this can be in business. OTR was off with their research by a landslide. I guess they work for certain Hedge funds to help scare the markets, is their business model. Good Luck everyone!"
"My humble opinion: Either they make it on their own. Then we might see triple digits in the foreseeable future if mgmt. just keeps on delivering the way it has under the new CEO.Or the company gets acquired, in which case the offer should be substantially above today's share price as NTNX is trading at just 5x EV/forward sales, which is ridiculous for a company that guides for sustainable growth of about 25% p.a. until 2025 and is expected to turn FCF positive in a few quarters' time, as stated by mgmt. on the recent Investor Day.Of course there are some risks attached to both scenarios, but mgmt. doesn't make the impression that there's a high likelihood of execution risks coming to fruition.Risk/reward looks favourable to me and that's why NTNX is one of my core holdings in my portfolio."
NTNX breaking out again - enjoy the ride!
"Mitsui Chemicals and Nutanix today said Mitsui Chemicals will use the Nutanix Cloud Platform to build a private cloud that will enable Mitsui Chemicals to have next-generation, digitally enabled infrastructure in its factories and become a data-driven business.Mitsui Chemicals will start using the Nutanix Cloud Platform at its Omuta Works located in Fukuoka in Sept 2021, and will deploy the same infrastructure in all its manufacturing sites by Dec 2021 to enable the aggregation and real-time analysis of vibration, gas, pressure gauge and other sensor data, and improve its business continuity plan (BCP).The deployment of this solution is an important component of Mitsui Chemicals' group digital transformation (DX) strategy for achieving its long-term business policy 'VISION 2030*1' goal. Mitsui Chemicals is pursuing DX on a group-wide basis to enhance its business model and operations in a way that enables it to help address the issues facing society and ensure it sustains growth in an increasingly uncertain business environment.Mitsui Chemicals has already deployed a small number of sensors in each of its manufacturing sites on a trial basis to prepare for the enhancement of its operations. Once its full-scale sensor and IoT device deployment is completed, the devices will begin to generate huge volumes of data. If this data is sent directly to the cloud or data centers, network traffic between sites will increase drastically, adversely impacting communications and possibly destabilizing the entire IT system. From the BCP perspective, as well, keeping all the data in a single data center, which is the current practice, poses serious risks given the possibility of communications being impacted by data center damage or power outages from natural disasters.In order to enhance its operations by building networks of IoT sensor devices at its five main domestic factories and its Sodegaura Center, Mitsui Chemicals decided to equip all of its sites with edge computing capabilities in the form of DX infrastructure capable of processing huge volumes of data generated by the IoT device networks. To this end, it will begin using the private cloud based on the Nutanix Cloud Platform for the system to preprocess data at its Omuta Works in Sept 2021. It will deploy the same platform with edge computing capabilities at all of its other sites by the end of Dec 2021.The Nutanix Cloud Platform is being used to build a private cloud and next-generation factory DX infrastructure that will enable Mitsui Chemicals to equip each of its sites with edge computing capabilities.Under this system, vibration, gas, pressure gauge and various other sensor data will be gathered into data lakes for real-time analysis.Building an edge computing environment at each site will also enable improved BCP in the event of communications disruption caused by a disaster or some other emergency.Nutanix, running on HPE ProLiant DX servers, will provide a highly secure, reliable, and high-performance infrastructure, which will enable stable operations.Quotes from Each Company on Building the DX InfrastructureMasao Sambe, executive officer, Digital Transformation Division, Mitsui Chemicals'Adopting the Nutanix Cloud Platform and edge computing as our next-generation factory infrastructure will enable us to establish an advanced production system. We will deploy this infrastructure globally to enable a dynamic production system, optimize our operations, secure our information infrastructure, provide solid business continuity support, and standardize our DX extension procedures.'Eisaku Machida, corporate vice president and president of Nutanix Japan G.K.'We are delighted to be able to provide Mitsui Chemicals with the Nutanix Cloud Platform to aid in their pursuit of data-driven business operations. Nutanix will enable streamlined data management, real-time analytics, IT resource optimization, and better availability. Building an edge computing environment at each site will also support their business continuity in the event of communications disruption caused by a disaster or some other emergency. Using Nutanix for edge/private cloud integration will also help to stabilize their IT system operations when the system is subjected to large inflows of aggregated sensor data.'"
"Wow, there is sth great going on and we don't know it yet! NTNX is a gift that keeps on giving!"
"Despite all that’s going on globally, especially with the pandemic and ongoing microchip shortage, the market for hybrid cloud solutions isn’t contracting.Part of the reason for this solid performance lies in the fact that organizations that are increasingly moving a large swathe of their workforce toward remote work have seen the security and scalability benefits of hybrid cloud.“Over the past few years, we’ve seen cloud investments really take off,” said Tanu Sood, senior director of product marketing at Nutanix Inc. “In fact, last year in the midst of the pandemic, when the economy was showing a downturn, cloud spending was up by 30%. So organizations are looking to cloud for speed, for scale, for elasticity and for app modernization.”Sood and Saveen Pakala, vice president of product management, hybrid cloud platform, at Nutanix, spoke with John Furrier, host of theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio, during the NEXT conference. They discussed market trends relating to hybrid milticloud. On-prem deployment is still in demand across multiple sectorsOrganizations are still adamant about maintaining some of their IT operations on-premises — either in the meantime or permanently, according to Sood. This trend accounts for the surging demand for hybrid cloud solutions.“So what they’re really talking about is this hot notion of hybrid cloud, which is interoperability between their on-prem investments, their existing investments, and their public cloud investments,” she explained. “In fact, I would say Gartner in 2020 did a survey and 75% of organizations actually talked about hybrid cloud being the preferred IT operating model. An overwhelming majority of that 80% who had public cloud in their infrastructure also had two or more public cloud providers in their space.”“What we have seen is that there are four typical issues that come up when customers start to look at their hybrid multicloud journey,” Pakala said. “The first one is: How do I move my on-prem applications and workloads to public cloud? Do I need to refactor the applications as I do that? How do I move that application from one cloud to the other and potentially move it back to the data center?”One way to remedy all of these reservations with the viability and utility of hybrid cloud, according to Pakala, is by leveraging a consolidated and consistent management model between public and private cloud implementations. Nutanix has made a name protecting valuable cloud data resources for hybrid cloud-focused companies with things like software license protection across the board. There are software layers that sit on top of the different cloud models, making them completely synchronous to one another, Pakala added."
Where is the institution pumper when you need
"On Monday Wells Fargo market strategist Paul Cristopher was on Bloomberg - The Close. He said that he would be a buyer here. He's got an S&P target of 5,000 for year end 2022.In the April-May-June quarter, Wells Fargo more than doubled their position in NTNX with a buy of 190,000 shares. They obviously like the stock right now and are probably continuing to buy in the current quarter."
"Insider selling (chief legal officer sold 60,000 shares on 10/6) may be cause of down trend today"
"The trend in short interest has been up lately:July 30 - 5.8m shares shortAug 13 - 6mAug 31 - 6.2mSept 15 - 6.8mI'm only seeing one large block trade today, at a dip just after 10am, and the stock moved higher after that. Then a lot of relatively small trades taking the stock lower starting at around 10:15. Could be a continuation of short selling by smaller investors. At some point this will start to turn around, not sure when, but short covering should give the stock a nice boost eventually. Long term fundamentals remain very positive here, the shorts will have to cover eventually."
Keith Moran most likely to get promoted
"Alicia Levine, the market strategist at BNY Mellon, was on Closing Bell on CNBC on Tuesday. She's bullish and believes the market will end the year higher than it is now. She acknowledges the reality that the market has been weak for the past 10 days or so and that a lot of other strategists are calling for a correction. She's taking a contrary view, that a correction may not be all that likely when so many people expect one.In the April-May-June quarter, BNY Mellon bought 57,000 shares of NTNX, and ended the quarter owning 677,000 shares. They own a lot of shares and have been buying a lot of shares. If their strategist is bullish my guess is that they're buying more shares of the stocks that they like."
It was a good day today :)
"I realize we've been speculating about this for years but if Nutanix has a great earnings report in Q1 and the stock still remains stagnant they have to start thinking about being acquired. Its not an indictment of the companies growth they simply are too single dimensional in their business model. Their solutions need to be part of a broader business model making companies like Oracle, IBM and Cisco a better business fit."
NTNX is a hidden gem waiting to be explored. Question is when that will be the case!
"This is just a recent interesting article: ""Toward a new hybrid cloud - the one CIOs always wanted"". It appears to dovetail nicely with NTNX's strategy and approach of market positioning for Hybrid Cloud."
"How many retired IBM exec are saying we could have bought Microsoft and Cisco for a song. Oops. Oracle could take a 25% stake in Nutanix that would only cost them around 3 billion, get a board member of two. Image how that would stir the pot with all their partnerships, knowing Oracle is breathing down your neck in your own back yard."
Trying to send flowers and candy to OTR guys. Got 11K shares @ 33.18. Can't thank them enough.
"This is not very assuring at all today’s market to see such a timid response in stock price, it means that no institution or funds are interested on moving the stock, simply not on anyone’s radar screen!!"
"at what point does an analyst with a Hold rating think about upgrading to a Buy? What gives?MS, GS, WF, SN, RJ don't have anything to say?Do they have to unwind their short first?"
There was a poster that suggested that another company was 10 years ahead in terms of hybrid cloud. He suggested through a faulty analyst that hpe was one of these. Let’s replay this. Hpe is a decade ahead of nutanix in hybrid cloud ?!?!? This investor has put in 10k shares and is asking this board to validate this statement. This poster is John. What has happened to the retail investor?
Well known tech investor Dan Ives was on Squawk Box on CNBC on Tuesday. He's bullish and believes investors should be buying the recent dip. He's predicting tech stocks will be up 10%+ by year end. He's predicting $2T in digital transformation spending over the next decade. I'm seeing NTNX taking share in the market and I expect them to get an increasing share of the digital transformation spending that is on the way.
