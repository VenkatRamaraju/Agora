today is a very important day. I am sure people at the company (other than lazy Roman and mean/bitter patolawala) killed themselves in Q3 to deliver these results. but the stock is still fighting to no go down even more than the 13 percent it already declined in the last three months when patowala intentionally lowered estimates significantly. if it closes down even more on these earnings it demonstrates even more that institutional investors have NO confidence in this team and company.
Another brutal morning. bet Roman and Patolawala will be happy when this week is over but not as happy as shareholders will be when their time at 3M is over.
"Really interesting to see Roman wasn't on any of the financial stations after earnings yesterday - it's good because he is a terrible, wooden speaker who only parrots his tired PR messages. But in some ways it's another piece of evidence people have just given up on 3M. Whole situation is just so sad. Oh Inge where are you when we need you?"
How could mmm finish DOWN on huge volume with those results? what can they possibly do to create value. firing Roman and Patolawala would be something to try. where is the Board?

"Would you consider posting something constructive, we investors typically look for reliable information and guidance."
Once again. GREAT day for the market. horrible for mmm.
Reading more analyst reports about 3M's Q and outlook it MIGHT be more complex than just the CFO and CEO incompetence. But I challenge anyone on this board to discuss the Q and explain why the stock is down on these blowout earnings.
"Belgian government is threatening with closing production-site of the 3M site in flanders over the PFOS schandal if they can't prove that pollution hasn't continued, might have some short negative impact. In a press-release 3M stated that ""closing down production would be good for nobody"""
"I had worked at 3M for many years retired a few years ago. the same old restructuring plans, realigning across supply chains, making more directors into VP's doing the same job for much more money. What happened to SAP? Inge T. big plan to centralize 3M and save millions...I wonder if this was ever completed and attained the benefits? I hold my stock knowing it will never reach the heights of smooth talking Inge at $258/share but I do like the dividend to add more play money to my retirement. Am looking forward to the next earnings call week."
Looking at the 5 year chart. A total gain of about 4%. MMM is a true Dog of the Dow.
Looking like it will close at or close the the LOW of the day. Where are all of you who thought Q3 results would help the stock? Roman and Patolawala's manipulation is working to perfection!!
Tanking now an hour before the close with 'earnings' tomorrow. Can't wait to hear their excuses for huge sales drop in a Q when GDP and global economy is booming. I predict stock will tank when they give their terrible outlook if no news or Roman resignation. If Roman resigns stock will immediately jump $10 unless GE guy is put in.
The only consolation from this debacle is we KNOW the stock will go up when Roman is gone. PLEASE do it soon. It can't be fun for him either knowing he is responsible for the company going from a 20% premium to a 20% discount in his four years. I am sure he is ashamed and afraid. They won't put his picture on the 14th floor!
"what kind of game is patolawala playing. q after q he demonstrates an inability to guide analysts to anything other than vastly lowered earnings estimates which they beat, but the company never gets credit for it because the Outlook is permanently bleak. they have had three blowout quarters this year (vs analyst estimates). yet the stock is only up 4 percent vs 21 percent for the s and p 500. he really is a rookie CFO who wall street hates. and he seems to not understand the company. how depressing this must be for the people in the company killing themselves for him."
Just saw an announcement that 3M Chief strategy officer quit to join Rockwell automation in the same job and apparently at the same level. Rockwell is a much smaller company. so either 3M fired her or she is jumping ship like so many senior leaders who can't work for a losing company like 3M anymore.
Compare GE results and stock reaction to 3M this Q and you can see why Patolowala is so bitter and unhappy he was exiled to 3M. He has basically worked for free at 3M for the last year vs what his options would have been worth as GE has doubled while 3M has done nothing since he joined.
"Hope everyone realizes that the people who own this company are getting killed by this management team, and that team is actually winning big because the more the stock declines the more valuable the options they will get next year will be since the strike price is lower. they will also get MORE options the lower the stock price goes. Roman gets something like 250,000 options every year. The way they message this company is consistent with them wanting the stock price to keep dropping. Even the Board benefits from this as they also get options every year."
"Stephane Bancel, the current CEO of Moderna, was formerly the CEO of bioMerieux, a French multinational corporation specializing in medical diagnostic tech, founded by one Alain Merieux. Alain Merieux was one of the individuals who was instrumental in the construction of the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s P4 lab.The sequence given as the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, is not a real virus. It is a forgery. It was made by entering a gene sequence by hand into a database, to create a cover story for the existence of SARS-CoV-2, which is very likely a gain-of-function chimera produced at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and was either leaked by accident or intentionally released.The animal reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 has never been found.This is not a conspiracy “theory”. It is an actual criminal conspiracy, in which people connected to the development of Moderna’s mRNA-1273 are directly connected to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and their gain-of-function research by very few degrees of separation, if any. The paper trail is well- established."
Can't believe I am posting something positive about 3M.It is purely external though and not anything positive management has done.The fact that corp tax rate increases are off-the-table should really help 3M since they pay an insane tax rate. A lower rate benefits them tremendously as they are terrible at tax planning.The difference between 22 and 25 (Manchin's number) is very significant for 3M...maybe worth $10 a share? I havent done a DCF... would be very easy calculation.That is maybe one upside when they lay out 2022 earnings outlook?? -maybe they can lower the tax rate in analysts models?
