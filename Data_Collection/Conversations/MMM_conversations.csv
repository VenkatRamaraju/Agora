"I was watching this stock to start a long position,...Based on this news, Ill wait till the new dumping of the stock finishes and they get their distributors in check!"
"Brad Thomas on why 3M is one of the best dividend stocks you can buy today:“ SummaryEven if 3M were downgraded to A, it would still be safer than the average aristocrat.Its business is top-notch, high-quality, and one of the most dependable dividend blue-chips on earth.MMM is currently 19.9X forward earnings, the upper end of historical fair value.This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing community, iREIT on Alpha. ”"
MMM just settled law suit for $850 Million; how will that affect share value ?
does the trade war with china effects this stock?
Up trend confirmed. Add more after pull back
"Malicious company. They pollute everywhere they can without thinking of consequences. You'd think they've learned from the lawsuit in Alabama, but no... they are also doing it in Belgium. ""American industrial group 3M has, for the first time, commented on the contamination of the ground around Zwijndrecht, Antwerp, with PFOS, which can cause all sorts of health problems, including cancer, after weeks of silence on the issue. 3M: ‘We will accept our responsibilities’"" - June 29, 2021Yesterday, the environmental inspection confirmed they are also ILLEGALLY polluting the nearby Scheldt river with FBSA and Me-PFBSA.The inspection also found out they produced more substances which weren't in the permit. This is just the tip of the iceberg..."
"Out of the short term position to pocket a small gain as it hits the upper Bollinger Band, do not want to hold the stock pass the earning. Last quarter's bad earning don't think it's a one quarter thing, until management has done something concrete, will not hold this stock for long term. Good luck longs."
Not to mention the price gauging that I also warned it wouldn't end well. https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-cuban-says-3m-distributors-price-gouge-n95-face-masks-2020-3?r=US&IR=T
Thinking of when to jump in. Where is the bottom!
"""The COVID-19 pandemic has advanced the pace of change and disrupted end markets around the world, increasing the need for companies to adapt faster,"" Chief Executive Officer Mike Roman said.Did the CEO say anything about all the debt 3M was taking in while the company was buying back $100s of millions per quarter in stock to increase earnings per share?Did he say anything about how we’ve yet to see any study that shows (1) that the “virus” is in fact the cause of respiratory illness; (2) that the “virus” has been proven to be contagious; and (3) that there is in fact a significant increase in total deaths per capita as a result of the virus?I didn’t get a chance to listen to the call."
"200+ very possible this week. I suspect this goes up VERY FAST, any updates on China trade negs will rocket this up to new highs imo. Smart money bought the drop that is a fact."
"Slammed again. Anytime this stock broaches $170 a share, it retracts. This is true again as the stock is down about $9 a share the last few days. Tough to defend this company’s leadership. They structure and manage this company very similarly to companies that actually grow. They need to shed a lot of high priced, non-essential management. VP here, VP there, that have little to no impact on results. This has to stop. 3M should manage their company for what it is. A portfolio of good products that are by in large commodities. Companies that have such an offering can be quite successful but cannot afford a bunch of non essential overhead. Don’t think 3M has ever come to this realization due to it being counter to their own claim that they are innovative. Let’s face it, what have they invented and actually commercialized that has made much of a difference in the last 20 years? Not a whole lot to my knowledge."
Industrial is the backbone of this company and it continues to slip. Concerning for sure.
"In their study and another from Duke University Medical Center, investigators examined cardiac MRI images from patients who received two doses of either the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines to see if they could identify a link between acute myocarditis and the shots.Researchers from both institutions conducted similar studies, looking at patients who presented with myocarditis post-vaccination between January and April 2021 and February and April 2021. Walter Reed examined 23 male patients between the ages of 20 and 51 who experienced onset of chest pain within four days of full vaccination, and Duke assessed seven patients between ages 23 and 70, four of whom developed symptoms within five days of full vaccination.All patients had elevated cardiac troponin levels, as well as abnormal electrocardiogram results. In addition, their cardiac MRI images showed findings that were consistent with myocarditis, including regional wall motion abnormalities, late gadolinium enhancement in a non-ischemic pattern, and elevated T1 and T2 in regions with late gadolinium enhancement.According to the researchers, all patients had been previously healthy, and clinical records pointed to no alternative explanations for their development of acute myocarditis."
"As I said some months ago, MMM is going to return to 200$ price levels this year :)"
nice morning but sure it will give it all up - everyone hates this stock including the company itself who has no money to buy any stock back due to PFAS and hearing lawsuits.
Realize the entire market is now slipping but tough to watch 3M stock value dropping like a rock the past two years. Down to $161 pre-market. This is roughly down $100 a share from its high. A lot of people losing money with this dud and can’t see a rebound happening any time soon.
"If 3M quadrupled their production of masks, respirators, filters, medical products and commercial cleaning products, I believe the market would respond. Incrementally increasing is expected. Doing something bold is what this company needs right now."
3m should pop in price. This company is indispensable with there products. Just think how many lives would and could have been saved in the last pandemic. Going foward institutional firms and private investors will see the value in owning 3m. GO LONG AND REAP THE BENEFITS.
In 2018 3m was $259.00 a share my how the mighty have fallen and is going to keep falling.
what will be a good entry price?
"This is not an investors market anymore. HFT have killed it. They need to add a .25 cents tax on every trade, you'll see how fast this computers disappear."
knew it would collapse at end of the day. best days are way in the past for this terrible company
"After the national immunization campaigns were initiated in the U.S. in the 1960s, for the first time in history, most U.S. infants were required to receive several doses of DPT, polio, measles, mumps and rubella vaccines.Tell Schools/Universities No Vaccine Mandates for Children/Young Adults!Shortly after, in 1969, medical certifiers presented a new medical term — sudden infant death syndrome.In 1973, the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics added a new cause-of-death category — SIDS — to the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD).By 1980, SIDS had become the leading cause of postneonatal mortality (deaths of infants from 28 days to one year old) in the U.S.As Miller points out in his article, the ICD category for vaccine-related death, or cause of death as “prophylactic inoculation and vaccination,” was eliminated when the ICD was revised in 1979 — despite the fact that this information would be useful in trying to understand the relationship between vaccination and death.But Miller, a medical research journalist and the director of the Thinktwice Global Vaccine Institute, provides an alternative route for establishing such a correlation — by observing the temporal relationship between vaccines and reported infant deaths, including SIDS deaths, in the CDC’s VAERS database.Miller found that out of a total of 2,605 infant deaths reported to VAERS from 1990 through 2019, the majority “clustered” in close temporal proximity to vaccination — 58% occurred within three days of vaccination, and 78% occurred within seven days of vaccination.Miller found the excess deaths within these ranges were statistically significant (p<0.00001), meaning the chance that this result is random is less than 0.001%."
I am in. This is a strong company with solid foundation. It's everywhere to the point that some professions/businesses can't survive without MMM's products. Use this opportunity to get in at a discounted price!!
A great buy at the current price. The diversified product portfolio has also proven to be attractive during the market cycles despite the recent miss.
Short MMM - easy cash.
MMM needs to get rid of 6 sigma before it totally sinks the company like it did GE.
Just bought some shares after a 50 point drop from April 18th high. Nice div at about 3.5 percent as of this writing. X date is tomorrow paying $1.44 per . Just think this has had enough and will come back up over the next few months. Good luck to us longs.
Maybe 3M and its management should spend a little less time organizing golf tournaments and more time understanding what customers want and need. Then they should structure their company appropriately rather than having a lot of high priced overhead that brings very little to the table in terms of customer value.
"I owe 3m stocks for 30 yrs. It was a great stock to own for the long term, not anymore to much in house obstacles. I'm out at 180."
"What a nightmare! Trading at levels last seen in October 2014.Having a hard time understanding how things went so bad, so quickly ?It seems like only yesterday, this thing was well above $200.00, they were raising the dividend double digits every year, & one year (2016 ?) they raised it by around 30.00%At the peak, around $260.00, on this very message board, someone asked if it would be a good time to initiate a position. I replied that ultimately only you can make that decision, but I wouldn't recommend it at this price.Wish I would have listened to myself and took a little off the table, and/or bought some put options.Oh well, we all know what they say about hindsight :)"
Seriously I short this to 60s
Lo and behold i buy a call option for the first time... downtrend ensues. I need this to be 169 by jan 2021 to break even
"Again, Kramer on CNBC recommends 3M on Monday morning. This is the third time in recent weeks."
Peanuts for 3M
"According to CNBC, “Disney said Friday it is requiring all salaried and non-union hourly workers in the U.S. to be fully vaccinated in the next 60 days.”"
This is the nature of the beast. The same investors that are selling will start buying at 95. Gentlemen Trading 101).
"The Federal Reserve is buying up corporate bonds. The American citizen is paying for these purchases through, you guessed it, inflation. They hit a button, create the money, and buy up the bad investment, usually a bank’s bad investment. And you pay for it. This is NOT capitalism. It is Socialism with a capital “S”. Welcome to the new America."
"invest for the long term, 3M yesterday, today, tomorrow average in and build wealth."
"Netflix and 3M have roughly the same market cap but if Netflix ever has earnings like this than it would go up $100 a share. Instead of reporting profit in terms of dollars, 3M should announce number of users of Scotch tape and PostIt notes."
"Currently I see 3M as a great buy at the current price, but how probable is it that this stock will hit a new 52 week low soon?"
"Forward PE is 16. Too high under global trade tension and economic slowdown. If PE goes down to 14 (reasonable), the price will drop to $144. In bad market condition, forward PE can easily goes to 12. The price is $124. That assumes earning will maintain the same. If earning revised down, it will be a bad news."
Back in the $160’s when other stock values are increasing. It actually took longer than I expected as it stayed in the 170’s for a while but knew it would drop faster than other peer stocks.
The futures are down and so is this company's future.
3M is at EXTREME oversold levels typical of companies that have WORSE fundamentals. I also own GE that is a LONG holding for the day that its restructuring kicks in and the stock drifts back up into the 20's. TUSA and other super bearish analysts have contributed mightily to the bearish sentiment as witnessed on Friday. I fully expect that the extreme oversold condition will be resolved and we will get a relief bounce that will be sharp on any positive news development. In the meantime I am adding minimal amounts to my portfolio each time we drop like Friday. As for the dividend......these analysts need to keep their mouth shut as I don't see any risk here for several quarters and the financial condition of the company needs to really deteriorate more before a dividend cut becomes more possible.
"Hate to say this but with the surge of the covid variants, 3M's offerings become more valuable. The N95 masks, PAPR's, health care products and cleaning products all should boom. At the same time, their other businesses could suffer if wide scale shut downs occurs again so suppose it could neutralize the demand?"
"Good business - and keeping the business in good health - requires constant trimming and adjusting which 3M is one of the best at doing. Yes we all want growth - but good, healthy, sustainable, growth is a sure sign of good management and a good future. 3M is well poised to be opportunistic as the future unfolds and has one of the healthiest P&L balance sheets in industry."
"Before getting into earnings, let’s recap what has transpired over the past year. As the quarters roll on past, it is easy to view bad events as discrete ones. In other words, small problems get glossed over in isolation. When you go back through what has occurred at 3M over the past year, what becomes clear is that there has been a habitual habit of overpromising before underperforming and cutting guidance, with the management team being largely reactionary to shifts in the macro environment. Is it coincidental that this began just as Michael Roman became CEO, replacing Inge Thulin? That’s perhaps up for interpretation but we could see him eventually become collateral damage from these failures if problems continue to persist"
"If your a long term dividend investor, this drop is a blessing and let’s hope we see a drop to $140s."
"Richard Russell: “The end of capitalism will be due to the unbelievable amount of debt that is currently being created. This will create monster inflation that will destroy every currency. The only currency that cannot be destroyed is gold. When investors realize this, we’ll have the makings of the greatest bull market in gold ever seen.”But first, the big 4 banks holding the concentrated short positions on the COMEX in Au and Ag will have to be overrun, because the CFTC has demonstrated that it is going to do nothing about it."
Is this a good entry point? Or do you think it will go under $190.
"this company is really cheap now. Good PER, good dividends, ahead of competitors= good future ahead, I just bought 1000 stocks"
Got my first stack of shares today at $199.95. With a starting yield of $5.76 / 2.88% per year I see dividend growth value. Will be buying more. Great company.

Everybody are buying masks and Trump is promoting this company.I don’t understand why the stock price is going down instead of up.Any insights from experts?
"If it can be avoided. I will never buy another 3M product even if the alternate costs double and is not as good. I stand for something that 3M does not comprehend, or does comprehend and chooses to ignore. I hope all the bad PR somehow gets the Chairman and the CEO kicked out for cause meaning no golden parachute."
3M will absolutely crush earnings. $225 in the next 90 days.
"This company has been on a downward trend for sometime. The only news seems to be bad news. Constant job cuts, restructuring due to poor performance. They just can’t seem to get it right which leads to their leadership. Bad direction and foresight of their businesses as well as placing individuals at high level, decision making positions that have no idea what they are doing. I don’t know how the board can continue to support this type of management? It just doesn’t seem to be positive for this long time, rock solid company of the past."
MMM reached a new All Time High at 257.39
Like this stock. How many dips do we have every year to load up. Jumped in at 155. Will we see that again or are we heading back to 190?
"Not too high P/E, solid dividend, stable company, I have ZERO doubt that 3M will return to the 200$ price tag this year. ZERO doubt."
"Hi, I am new to this board but have been a long time stockholder of 3M. I added to my position today. I’ve been waiting a long time to buy more stock and I believe today was the day. I may not have picked the absolute bottom but the dividend should act as a buoy. ￼"
"Debt seems to be the fastest growing element of 3M.It's long term debt has gone from $8.7Bn in 2015 to $13.4Bn in 2018 -- that's a 54% jump.During the same period revenue has only grown 8%, or approx 2% a year and operating income has actually declined from $7.013Bn in 2015 to just $6.87Bn or a decline of 2%.On the balance sheet, 3M has a negative net tangible asset position of ($2.9Bn)"
This just lost over a months worth of gains in 10 minutes.
So much for that mini run. MMM back down to 200. Appears to be a lot of work to be done to get this moving positively again. CEO leaving at the right time. Taking his $20M and getting out. Thinking new CEO will be challenged to get this company moving in the right direction. Just my opinion.
"Definitely one of the few companies I can trade confidently with . I have been getting so much joy investing all because of my earnings.Just perfect, I have been telling everyone how they gave me a ray of hope after I thought I had lost it all, now I have not only earned but also learned how to make market analysis.Deriv trading platform has been helpful even to me as an old trader and mostly newbies out there... I am still earning daily and growing my wallet monthly with Jame's Platform."
"From the Pfizer supply agreement:""Purchaser acknowledges...the long-term effects and efficacy of the Vaccine are not currently known and that there may be adverse effects of the Vaccine that are not currently known."""
I hope my other holdings have terrible earnings so they can jump.
"Don't worry about it, I bought yesterday. Stocks always go down after I buy, it will be back up soon..."
"I don't own the stock but all of the products I have bought from MMM have been the best in class. VBM tape - permanent, their marine adhesives - phenomenal, their marine silicone caulk - never yellows or mildews. Just great stuff."
Are earnings tomorrow before or after the Bell??
Imagine every office in the U.S. (for starters) now stocks 3M disposable masks as part of routine health & safety policy. That’s huge!
MMM is great long term investment. For short term day traders....you are on your own
How is this not up? Market is backwards. Maybe short term profit taking to buy up some beaten down other stocks? Only thing that makes sense.
MMM is a buy at $171
3M recently went with AWS as it's public cloud vendor of choice and Salesforce for it's CRM needs to connect better for it's B2C and B2B segments. These moves look like steps have been taken in the right direction to participate in the digital economy. I think the current state of the company was due to Thulin's bad moves to buyback stock to juice his options. Mike Roman was just thrown in the fire and asked to right the ship or so it seems. Would love to hear what other long-term 3M shareholders think of my views.
"Finished up today (on German exchange). First up day in a good while, but way too early to call it a bottom."
Wow feeling pretty proud of myself for picking near bottom at $136!
They were selling and got paid in cash. I bet they never reported it as well.
Dividend history of 61 years? Yeah and look at the TOTAL RETURN. Hack dividend investor.
Big 3M scandal in Belgium...
"Another terrible day. Hard to imagine this company used to trade at a premium to the S&P 500. All CFO talks about is negative outlook, so things must be pretty bleak. So sad for a formerly good company."
"Glad i am not long on 3M. Tucker Carlson's report tonight on how 3M's distributors are selling critical medical supplies to foreign governments FIRST, and American state governements like Florida LAST, and 3M not doing anything about it, made my blood boil. It got the attention of Trump today. Good luck 3M...."
"Go 3M- >3.5% yearly increasing, rock solid div..A+ financial rating.. safety, works for me. %^). let capapp/TR take care of itself.."
"3M has huge R&D, and technology will be moving in a direction that 3M can take advantage of"
"Lots of negatives associated with 3M. Don't be surprised if they miss on the quarterly estimates and further reduce forecast, plus increase contingent environmental liabilities."
"Sec. 2. Presidential Direction to the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary). The Secretary, through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Administrator), shall use any and all authority available under the Act to acquire, from any appropriate subsidiary or affiliate of 3M Company, the number of N-95 respirators that the Administrator determines to be appropriate.Take it"
Bought more at this discount price. It won't take long for the top notch 3M management to turn this around.
"The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 soared 30% over the weekend as testing capacity has been expanded and outbreaks have worsened in Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.S. very soon they will recover. Here more updates: http://investor.social/PotentialUndervaluedMarkets"
3m doing a partnership with OPTI. OPTI is going to go up from such great news stay tuned with this stock.
"I'm gonna get in at 170ish. If you are holding this, what is your cost basis?"
Pence just mentioned they are visiting 3M facility tomorrow. Should skyrocket!!
Fifteen states suffer through rolling blackouts and power outages as a polar vortex runs through much of the nation. And what does 3M do at this point in time? It announces a $1B plan to combat global warming. And I thought Amy Klobuchar topped them all when she got on national TV in a blizzard to announce her Presidential campaign focusing on global warming.
"It's ironic the panic is actually spreading to the company that makes the equipment that could have prevented the panic to begin with. I have a feeling some people are just in sell everything mode, and fail to consider that 3M is among the few companies that will profit from the coronavirus."
"This companies strength was its diversityBy streamlining products, Roman has weakened 3MThe BOD needs to act and fast"
"There are some bargains available now and would consider 3M at 130 a share one big one. The company is over 100 years old, has a broad portfolio that serves diverse markets and offers a solid dividend. For now, they have key products that meet the worlds immediate needs in safety, health and filtration. All critically important to nearly every area in the world."
interesting AP story today about how china supply chain reliance is hurting competitiveness of US companies. could actually be a positive for MMM since their ineptitude over the years prevented them from benefiting from globalization. wonder if Moaneesh gets this?
"This is insane drop for a great company! They’re exposed to covid but who doesn’t? Even big techs are impacted like msft, aapl but MMM is really diverse is see minimal impact of 10% and will just go up as soon as economy is back to normal. keep adding at this level a lot! Good financial background and fix dividend is great at this turbulence"
3M is in good company with stalwarts like Catipillar that was humming along at much higher prices last year. Then tariifs came along and then coronavirus and then a crash when economic activity around the world went comatose. Everyone that held on now find themselves looking up from the bottom of the grand canyon wishing that there was a way out that was simple. You need to add to your positions even if the trajectory is down because the circumstances that got us where we are now will change as both economics improve and the political course of the country shifts....and it will. Don't lament about the past and what you were worth a year ago. Do something positive to change the outcome...
Why the sudden drop??
First time Above the 50 day average since late April!! Stock chart is looking very healthy again!! MMMMGA!!!
"VAERS data released today by the CDC showed a total of 463,457 reports of adverse events from all age groups following COVID vaccines, including 10,991 deaths and 48,385 serious injuries between Dec. 14, 2020 and July 9, 2021....Keep in mind: estimates are that only 10% of deaths and injuries are reported, at best. Many say only 1%. So take these numbers and multiply them by 10 to get a glimpse of what may actually be happening out there."
25% drop tomorrow
"Great example of how much manipulation is possible, even with good news..."
"A boycott of 3M seems appropriate. They are more concerned about ""foreigners"" who are paying a higher price than the Doctors, Nurses and Emergency workers dying in America due to the lack of masks. Perhaps if the 3M CEO would go before Congress and testify why his company puts the dollar ahead of America he would be at least able to argue his point. But my sense is that even Bernie Sanders would drag this clown of a CEO to the nearest electric chair and strap him in and let a relative of a healthcare worker who died pull the switch."
We going down after earnings?
A friend sent me a clip of something published in one of the local Minnesota paper. It stated that Inge Thulin made $34M. I ask why is the corporation (stockholders) paying this guy anything?
"Huge over reaction from the market for a small miss in forward guidance, although shares were richly priced to begin with."
3M has huge business opportunity. The only issue is if company has the resources to capitalize it or not.
Would you buy this stock if you had money to buy? Trying to pick out a stock I want to invest in.
Sounds like what happened to Eric Clapton too:https://thecovidblog.com/2021/07/16/madeline-johnson-21-year-old-california-students-tremors-random-paralysis-getting-progressively-worse-after-second-pfizer-mrna-injection/
"wait, what??? wasnt there a downgrade a few weeks back? love this company, products, div and potential!"
"It took over 100 years for 3M to build their Brand and reputation, and in one day , they lost it."
GM tanking huge today..MMM lost yesterdays gains I see also...hmmm
I wouldn't get too carried away with the mask angle. Yes we are a large industrial user and have been told we are on allocation based on prior purchase history. So we can buy them but not unlimited quantities. This will pass and then its business as usual. Not a reason to invest imo.
"Fellow MMM Holders --- My family's foundation largest holding has been MMM for over 25 years -- we are highly steeped in the more ""industrial"" sectors ... and MMM has been a fantastic holding (although 2018 has been a little ""rough"") ... HOWEVER, we've closely studied and researched a smaller small/mid-cap Company in the Industrial Sector for over 2 years and we thought we'd mention our thought's/interest in a few investment ""forums."" The Company is Hurco, Inc. (HURC) traded on the NASDAQ. It's a very quiet Comany which has been growing rapidly in the past 2 years under most radars. It's located in Indiannapolis and has a highly diversified international customer base (50% overseas ... primarily in Germany and UK). It has a specialty in high-precision, 5-axle machinig stations. Recent order and revenue growth (annualized) have been running at 15%-30% (and accelerating) with significant cash being generated via operations. Current cash balance has now accumulated to 25% of Enterprise Value!"
Current management has destroyed shareholder value just in a couple of years. How can MMM continue to pay dividends with growth decelerating along with mountain of debt load? All those promises of double digit EPS and high FCF conversion seems bogus right now.
MMM is an interesting company to analyze. Management bought $10B worth of stock last year at an average price of $207 per share. They're only buying $1B when it's cheap this year. Makes me wonder if they're clueless or trying to inflate EPS?
This is a great company and will be a great investment - having said that not sure we’re near the bottom just yet
another Green Day for Dow and this continues to fall. I don’t get it.
"3M seems to be fairly valued at this current price. I like the accordion nature of this company, along with the strong returns on R+D and sales channels. This is a solid business."
hard to understand this stock falling two days following a very good quarterly report and annual outlook. The concern with costs going up and supply chain issues isn't new. This has been around since the pandemic so not so sure why the analyst would be overly concerned with this particularly understanding 3M's ability to weather these types of headwinds. Just doesn't make much sense to me?
"Our hospital of several thousand beds normally is stocked high with 3m protective equipment. It's almost all gone. Not many people have been using them yet, expect for flu. But they have all disappeared. Maybe employee theft, or for redeployment, I don't know. I wonder how many other large hospitals are in he same situation. 3m will need to massively increase production."
3M’s debt levels are worrisome. Hope the new CFO helps.Over the last 5 years 3M wasted billions on stock buybacks at historically high prices To inflate EPS as Executives sold shares.
220 soon!
6% dividend raise. What a great long term dividend plus growth investment.
I purchased MMM when it was around 210. Went up to to 245 or so and now 170's. I still think it a good company to own in my portfolio. Might buy some more.
Anyone think this is a good price to average down at? The dividend is tempting but don’t know if it is worth it
"I was going to buy but find it odd this isn’t higher, why ?"
I'll never understand how just one stock can bring down the entire market with a bad earnings report?? Is this all emotional?
"Honest question. I have no position here, but wondering why 3m is all over the news with their producing and selling millions of masks yet no uptick? BIO firms just saying they are working on a vaccine skyrocketing. Would think there would be an opportunity here."

Buy now or wait? Thoughts?
The only thing I regret is not buying more shares when it went down to $165. My buy order was for 163.
"In the 2020 fiscal year, the federal government borrowed 64% of the $6.5 trillion it spent. So most of what it spent came from the Federal Reserve and the banking system that turned government debt into dollar currency. That’s the real reason that explains why prices are rising. The quantity of dollar currency is soaring, but there is more reason to worry. Not only is this new currency still in the system, the Fed still has the money spigots wide open. It has to keep them open to provide the federal government with the dollars it is spending over and above what it receives from taxes. We will need to watch closely the next several weeks how high the politicians raise the national debt ceiling. It could be a whopper increase given the federal government’s spending plans, and that could send gold, silver, and the mining shares soaring.To bad they took the mining out of 3M."
"The 3M's....Money, Money, Money....Among many other products their automotive painting tape, although expensive, is A-number 1...."

"Just days ago, CEO Mike Roman was saying ""we're trying to redirect everything to health care workers."" Ya, right!!!?? Selling masks to other countries definitely does NOT fit what you say! You need to step down Mike Roman."
"Keep hearing a lot from 3M executives on the call about business transformation. is that their new ERP system? If so, they talked a lot about operational efficiency and the financial gains they expect from it but curious how much it is costing them to implement? The system itself, the people involved in the switch from old to new and those in place to maintain? I have to believe it must have been needed but these generally are extremely expensive, time consuming and cause major disruption within the business. Not hearing much about this and the drain it is creating within the company?"
"165 million masks in three months delivered to the government over the next three months. Trump just said 3M is a great company. Boy, didn’t he flip flop on this in just a couple days? Nobody’s making anything close to these numbers nor did any company ramp up as fast as 3M."
2 Yrs Ago Today MMM Last Touched $200 ... Finally !!
Why did the stock go down ? I expected a good 10 percent increase everything considering how it is ?
Buy TZOO she turned the qtr eps and increased guidance
Do NOT support 3M anymore !!!!
"The Federal Reserve is trying to fool everyone, just like the government with respect to shot. They are telling you that they are going to be raising rates in 2023. But about half of federal expenditures are funded through inflation. So, if the Fed was being truthful — in order for them to do what they claim — tax revenues would half to double or the government would have to shrink by 50%. So, what’s it going to be:1. Massive tax increases;2. Major cuts in government spending; or3. No rate increases and more inflation. My bet is they do 1 and 3 with heavy reliance on 3, which means they ain’t raisin’ rates. We’re heading towards hyper."
"RIP Spencer Silver, co-inventor of the Post'it Note."
Bounce back time!
I love 3M!
Everything is going to be fine everyone panics in these times. Someone had mentioned that they have over 1900 products. It’s not going to rely on face masks. They also make surgical glove and many other products. People need to relax a little bit. 3m took on a company for almost7 billion dollars. They have a hold on wound care. If I was everyone else that doesn’t have shares I would buy in while it is low.
3M kills it. Expects EPS of $10. Stock at p/e of 20. Much more reasonable than other stocks in SnP 500.
4 days in the 170’s is too much to ask for this stock. $165 or lower next week.
"The more disease healthcare workers get, the more the public gets and probably not just a linear relationship—probably exponential. How many Americans have they killed?"
"Aside from the general market decline, this stock has been on a slow slide for two weeks. No confidence that its early growth in 2021 is sustainable."
"Well done 3M, strong earnings while helping out frontline workers and society overall"
"consistent earnings beat, great EPS, good PE, great dividend, 40% off recent ATH. some environment issues/lawsuits to deal with, but seems like a good LTI near this price."
I was lucky with MMM as I got into this in April last year and added in December. was planning to buy more this spring. Not sure if I will go thru with this plan at these high prices.
Another day with Dow UP 200 and 3M DOWN. Tells you all you need to know about the company and stock. Just unbelievable this stock usde to trade at a premium to the S&P 500. When will the board take some kind of action?
3M stock price is in decline
"Open letter from lawyer Sidney Powell:July 25, 2021Paul Johnson The family that I want to spotlight today is the Johnson family. Paul Johnson was a peaceful protestor January 6th. The Johnson home was raided before dawn on April 13th. I have reviewed cell phone footage provided by his wife. I am not at liberty to share the videos with you yet. Dozens of armed agents in tactical gear pointed guns at their 7, 8, and 14 year old children. Their children were forced outside, half-clothed in 42 degree weather. The FBI raided their home for over 4 hours. The FBI refused the Johnson family a lawyer until they agreed to provide an interview first. The FBI would only show the Johnsons their warrant AFTER they conducted their raid. These actions are blatantly illegal. When I receive permission, I will show you these videos. Heartsick for this family."
"I am going to buy my 100 shares now, always goes lower after I buy , Here goes my government covad 19 check !"
Guess the golf tourney didn’t give 3M much positive press? Why the slide now before the earnings report?
"Check out INTC today. If 3M did this and hired Doug Baker former CEO of EcoLab to turn company around, stock would go up $20"
Why is Clorox tanking huge premarket ? Anyone know ?They have a lot in common with mmm product wise
"""In 2017 3M won the prestigious Catalyst Award for its commitment to diversity and inclusion; Mike is also a Catalyst Champion for Change, joining other CEO’s who have pledged to accelerate inclusion.""Apparently the company and CEO haven't pledged to include the United States."
"i work for this company and oh boy, i do not know how this stock goes up given our internal culture and metrics"
Folks.....they have nothing else to sell at this point.....Look at Apple also. We are at a point where the sellers are just trying to raise cash because they have to meet their own obligations that are probably demanding it. For those who follow technical stuff we were maxed out on the downside at 132....but what do charts mean anyway when FEAR grips everything.....Keep your heads about you...…..
"Bought a few more shares this am, limit right near open @ 157.5. One things for sure, you will always hear the worst rumors, news , doom&gloom about any company when it's near a 52 week low. 60+ years of increasing divs, -AA financial rated, at >double the T-bill yield- I can wait and reinvest divs, no problem. Even if there's lower FY19 earnings, P/E is the lowest in at least 5 years"
"Headed back to $200. Will sell over 100,000,000 facemasks in the next several months"
Anyone know why 3m was down 2.3 percent today with double the average volume ? I don’t see any news ?
Great response to the earnings call. Ended up down yesterday and now down over $4 today. I sense little confidence came from the call despite beating a very low earnings estimate.
Why did this wait for the usd to spike before it made a big move up? Illogical 
"Sorry to say but cutting 2000 jobs won’t help this company get thru it’s issues. By doing so, they lose the little experience and customer know how they had. This has been going on for a while now and it’s now showing the effect. Bad direction by its leaders and board. They need a clean start by bringing in fresh minds that can get this company moving again because I still feel there is brand value in MMM."
"According to CNBC, “Walmart said its corporate staff as well as management-level employees must be vaccinated against Covid-19 by Oct. 4.”"
"This could have, and SHOULD have been 3M’s time to shine. Instead, yet another misstep. As investors, we need accountability. The BOD needs to act and quick"
"Would you strongly encourage a friend to buy an airplane from a manufacturer who would not accept liability for their product and who’s product has already crashed a few times?Well, get this, 3M “strongly encourages” its employees to get the shot despite pharmaceutical companies refusing to accept liability for its product and despite many thousands of deaths and injuries being reported to VAERS. Perhaps injured persons can pursue 3M for following bad medical advice. Makes you also wonder if 3M wants to reduce its pension liability for those who took the annuity."
"if 3M can respond to meet or exceed the current need of PPE, health care products, filtration and cleaning products, it is the best PR this company could ever wish for. Much more effective than the current string of commercials talking about how great their science capabilities may be. OK 3M, bring that science to life, make stuff that people need NOW!"
Looking at 4 year chart indicates target downside now at 152 and change (lowest low on the 4 year chart). lf it gets down there I'll add more shares to my very small current position. If it breaks that downside could be as low as 120 and change!!
Dow down 2.8 percent - 3M down 5.0 percent. Why?
HUNDREDS of healthcare workers were infected today because of 3Ms treason.
Why is PPG tanking ?They have a very similar profile as MMM....
"If you are 10 yrs. old,great investment If you are 65 do not touch its toxic unless you want to break even when you turn 90. Buyer beware!!!!!!!"
"If you go to the Federal Reserve website, you can see the numbers for money supply increases. These numbers exceed 3M’s sales growth by a wide margin. Thus, actual inflation is greater than 3M’s nominal sales growth. Put inflation into 3M’s sales numbers, you’ll see negative sales growth. And the negatives are big. In short, 3M is not keeping up with inflation. And if you put it’s earnings in gold rather than dollars, you’d have negative earnings by a wide margin. 3M is a microcosm of the western economies. Now it all becomes apparent. The DJIA to gold ratio is going to implode. The ratio currently sits at 16.75. Soon it will be 1. My prediction: in the next year or two. All it takes is for more people to understand what I just wrote."
"Just saw a piece on the Savanah Gutry networks. They showed the 3M masks being actually made. There was a small segment where someone complained that the public should resist buying masks. This alone will cause many to buy these. They will ask themselves, if they work for docs, they will surely work for me."

I see pictures all over the net of 3M boxes of masks....numerous pics....Piles of 3M boxes being bought in China and Hong Kong.....Couldn't the CEO give some guidance on expected sales forth coming?
Just looked at the 2 year chart. With head and shoulders negative pattern stock could hit 170 and change eventually. I'm going to wait to see how far down she goes. I'll buy more around 181 or 182 (if it get there). Love the company and the dividend. Stock will be down 26% from the top if it opens right here (Bear Market).
Buy in before earnings report? Is there something I am missing? Hoping for the best but really don’t expect it so why the sudden market lift?
Slow and steady! Up we go! 230!
"Ok so I've had no time to do research in this.Two months ago I sold everything, shorted airlines, bought gold and bought clorox. Very happy with the results.My question is, why isnt 3M performing better?I believe in fundamentals. No revenue, I short (airlines). Fed prints money, I buy gold. I see increased revenue and profits, I buy their stock (clorox).What's the deal with this?"
225 by year end.
this has fallen more recently than it did in the financial crisis
"Any tick up is an excuse for big institutions to sell. Uncertainly over PFAS and hearing lawsuits is just too great for smart money, plus constantly negative outlook from CFO who probably wishes he had never left GE. They don't even raise guidance when Q1 and Q2 were significant beats, and KEEP saying RM costs are getting worse. So Sad."
"Market forces take it up and take the price down with little control from the company CEO and board. Shows how over inflated CEO pay is in America today versus the average worker. Not saying they shouldn’t be handsomely rewarded as I imagine it is a very demanding position with a lot of pressure but not 300X the average company employee. That makes no sense and is so out of wack, when is it going to be recognized and fixed!"
"Don’t ever remember MMM declining so much in one day? Perhaps it has happened but if so, not often. Soul searching at the exec level must happen. They obviously have done little to prepare for this happening and it cost a lot of funds and ultimately investors a boatload of money."
"In the 2008 crisis. This fell to $45. This crisis, both as a company and country is worse. Hoping for sub $50 again. They need to pay for their treason."
"Very few Americans alive today know this: there was no inflation in the USA for the first 124 years. People think inflation is just something that happens. Nope. It is purely a product of the Federal Reserve system and its debt based currency. When the private sector got to use the currency of their choice, namely, gold, silver, nickel, and copper, there was no inflation. The precious metals were extracted out of the ground at the same rate as other industrial production. Prices only went down slightly as citizens got to reap the benefit of their improvements in productivity. Now the government and banks are robbing people blind, transferring that wealth to themselves and their shareholders through a legalized counterfeiting operation."
"They are aligned and manage the company as they have the last 100 years. A lot of layers and high priced support staff that have little to do with customers. Their portfolio doesn’t warrant this type of structure and although their model has worked over the years, its now time for a major revamp. Companies just cannot operate as they did years ago if they want to be successful. I am afraid 3M management just doesn’t grasp this or simply doesn’t want to because change is not easy."
"i got in at 174, glad to be here."
"Home depot tanking.. Huge slowdown in china search it...Reported last night,,,Are you getting greedy ?Warren buff sez when eveeyone greedy be scared..."
"3M does have a strong medical care division. It has a good profit margin. They also have manufacturing lines in various regions, that can supply globally."
"Sales continue to surge, in their Industrial and Healthcare businesses. Their China plants are all running full out as local demand has really taken off. I’m predicting $200 by April 1 and a very strong 2Q."
"For all those who think the CEO did the right thing, check the overwhelming comments that say he did not."
"You can spin it a lot of ways. However, the excuses keep coming. The company has excellent technology and manufacturing expertise. Accountability for achieving results needs to happen very soon."
Did 3M lobby for passage of the new “infrastructure” bill? Look what big brother now has in store for you:https://www.ericpetersautos.com/2021/08/08/how-the-new-mileage-tax-will-get-your-old-car-off-the-road/
"How in the world can 3M employees, stockholders, and board members continue to support leadership when they are doing nothing to positively impact stock values? Realize they have responsibility to create and promote a positive work environment which doesn’t always go hand in hand with stock price but come on, this stock has done nothing but decline or remain stagnant at best since the current leadership team was put in place. Something has to give as I can’t see large holders of this stock remaining patient any longer."
Bag holders?
"Just doubled down on good, old, reliable, dependable, money making, MMM!! Used today's downgrade to accumulate MORE!! I own several stocks but the 4 Horsemen of the Blue Chip Apocalypse that are my Pride and Joy are: MMM, BA, UTX and HON. I'm accumulating all 4 even IF we go into a Bear Market this year!! They ALWAYS come back. Forget FB, AMZN, NFLX, etc., WAY overvalued. Stick with Blue Chips like MMM and you'll go home HAPPY!!!"
“U.S. homebuilder confidence falls to 11-month low in July“Devastating news for mmm
The first big publicly traded company to move its cash out of Federal Reserve notes into precious metals will be the big winner.
wow this is bad. bankruptcy imminent?
"The great industrialist American, Henry Ford, once said “[i]t is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.”Well ... Let me just tell you how it works in a few clauses: (1) all money today enters circulation as a debt; (2) member banks of the Federal Reserve system get to create the money out of thin air to loan it out to citizens and entities; (3) member banks of the Federal Reserve system also get to buy the nation’s debt instruments using money created out of thin air; (4) because the Fed uses a debt-based currency, there never is enough money in circulation to pay off all debts; more debts must therefore be issued so outstanding loans can be satisfied; (5) more debts are also needed by member banks so that they can buy more treasuries with free money to increase their earnings per share and their share prices; (6) war is a good way to increase debts fast; (7) more monet can also be made by the boom/bust cycle coincident with the Fed’s monetary expansions and contractions; (8) the IRS and income taxes were created at the same time as the Fed to provide the revenue to fund its debt based currency; social security taxes, estate taxes, and increased tariffs would be added later for this purpose, and carbon and wealth taxes and increased income taxes are now being proposed to keep the debt based currency alive. In short, the American worker pays for the wealth transfers through income, social security, estate, and inflation taxes. And then they get creamed in the markets because they do not have the understanding nor the foreknowledge of when the boom will begin or when the bust will happen."
bought more. been wanting to get in for a while. should do great the next couple of months . 35 million masks. so many revenue streams. this is a gift.
"3m is the leading manufacturer of health masks. masks are more dear than gold now. the gold won't save you, the masks will."
When are they ramping up production of their Respirator masks? They could be making a fortune.I would be running 24 hours shifts making them. Home Depot and Lowes have been out for 5-6 weeks.And some one at Home Depot today told me they are not able to even order them. And they are out online. ??
"All federal government workers must get da jab or lose their job. And they vote Democrat. And stole an election. Getting what they deserve? You try to feel sorry for them, but ... Next will be workers for the big corporations. The workers don’t own enough shares to stop it. And the executives generally speaking are spineless souls, many of whom sold their souls and freedom to secret societies. All the free money given out since 1913 makes them minor shareholders anyways. The big banks and the shareholders of the big banks control for the PTB. They’ll call the shots. You should have spoken up when they blew up the WTC buildings on nine eleven. Now your sweating it out. Soon you could be dead too."
3M lost another lawsuit. This company stock price is going down.
Up over 2% pretty good day for MMM. Was trying to get more shares cheaper but oh well. GLTA longs.
MMM is a buy and hold forever stock
The market is showing no confidence in 3M management despite decent numbers. Time for a change.
3M has it. Selling the medical delivery will reduce debt and strengthen the company.
"I live in Canada. Our medical system relies heavily on PPEs made by 3M and we are running out of them quickly. If 3M decided to no longer export, the death rate in Canada and many other countries will rise. I know Americans are desperate, but so are your neighbors. If 3M can spare PPEs to other countries, I don't think it's out of corporate greed. Actually, doesn't matter if it's corporate greed or not if it saves more lives."
"Insiders selling ! 3M insiders have sold shares in the past 3 months. Four individuals sold 31.000 plus shares valued at $ 6,350,000No buyers during this period. Must indicate something!"
Stock is trading at 2014 levels and the best they could announce today was that they had removed all of the clocks in their headquarters. C'mon man!
"This once rock solid company is clearly having issues. The stock has been a real dud as of late and have to wonder what is being done about it other than leadership speak of playbooks and superior execution. Cutting lower level positions will temporarily look like a cost savings tactic but every time this is done, valuable knowledge walks out the door with no one ready to pick it up. 3M has done this every time their business softens and the ramifications of doing so are now evident. Although they have many issues, have to say that their R & D ROI is poor. Just nothing new coming out of their labs that change the basis of competition and that can demand the high margins 3M is used to receiving. Growth by acquisition has been their way which has driven up debt without fixing some of their core issues. In my opinion, this demonstrates their leadership is either unaware or simply doesn’t know what to do which is very scary for stockholders and employees alike. Watch out for their Q2 earnings announcement. It may not impress?"
"Robert Craft Patriots owner had to send his jet to china for 1.2 million masks plus he bought 300,000 for NYC. That's a Hero in my eyes."
Operating costs are out of control. Last 3 fiscal years= sales up 8% and SG&A expenses up by 21%. Operating margins declined from 23.1% to 20.7%. Minimal sales growth and large cost growth = not a good recipe.
"Another conspiracy theory becomes a conspiracy fact. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is caused by childhood vaccinations. There is only a 0.00001 probability (0.001% chance) that it is not. But does the government or the pharmaceutical industry change or alter in the slightest their “vaccination” program or its schedule? No, of course not. Their actions are nothing short of human child sacrifice. Do you trust their vaccination recommendations for this new thing they call covid (to the extent it even exists)?Evidently 3M does because it strongly encourages its employees to get da jab."
"This stock is a dividend King. I just keep reinvesting the dividends, and in 5 years when I retire, I can collect my dividend checks every quarter and never have to touch the principal, which i will leave to my children."
"I tell you investors what... There is a LOT of misinformation out there... If you aren't able to listen to this conference call live, please consider listening to a replay. Get the information directly from the Exec team."
The extreme oversold condition still exists that I wrote about 10 days ago. Negative sentiment is a major factor here and it doesn't help either when you're part of the DOW that has been getting hammered relentlessly every time hope fades where the tariff situation is concerned. The one man show at the White House has created a hugh overhang on the markets and the longer it goes on the financial environment will become increasingly toxic. I know there are many who are happy to average down and wait for the turn. If you decide to go that route then add about 1/10 of what you wanted to pull the trigger on. Its easier to live with a 10 share loss than 100. That's what I'm doing...….on many different companies that have been hammered.
"6 month performance of this stock has been awful. I own in my retirement account and I got in around 155 but anyone telling me this is a great stock is delusional. Of all the dividend stocks I own, this is near the bottom of my list of ones I'd recommend. The yield is low and the total return is below average."
"With the repurchase of shares by the company and the announcement of the dividend increase, this should be a rocket these days ... 211 for today"
CEO needs to take a pay cut for the miserable stock performance over the past 24 months. His salary has only increased over that time frame.
"These legal estimates are always overblown. Litigation and appeals drag out for years.As a huge multinational with inflammation looming and Dems in a spend mode, I regard this pullback as a buying opportunity. Certainly a dinosaur and not a growth stick but a good inflation hedge and reliable dividend payer."
"In the year 2000, 3M’s stock price was $30 per share. In the year 2000, gold was $400 per ounce. 3M was thus priced at 0.075 ounces per share. Today it is worth 0.11 ounces a share, a 48% gain over 21 years. That’s less than 2% a year. With the dividend, your talking about a 5% gain per year. But 3M also has taken on billions in debt. So when the easy money ends and 3M is not making any earnings and it’s stuck with billions in corporate bonds to pay, plus pension obligations, where’s the share price going to be then. Let’s say $60 a share if not bankruptcy. Gold will likely hit $10,000 an ounce then, given the market turmoil. Then you’ve got a 2,400% gain in gold over 22 years versus a 100% gain in 3M if not a loss."
What's the five year lows for this one?
Owned this stock since 2019... tested breakeven points several times and held. Finally getting a profit out of it so I'm out as I feel it's at its peak. Good luck to all. Time to invest in AMC. LOL
"If you still believe the media, when it comes to covid, watch this before it gets taken down (very short, must watch):https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_EjUfu7dktM"
Yesterday I ordered 3M n95 masks and then bought 3M stock … so far up 5%.
This is a great quarter and so far a great conference call!
Earning the rest of the year will be great. Analyst are pulling it down right now. I'm buying on this dip for the long run.
"N95 mask and ventilators will bode well long term with low PE and nice Dividend. DONT sell, too late. Hold on for the ride. If new and u have cash to play with, ok to nibble on the way down. Dont go all in cuz we could see $100. Solid company though. Good luck to all and stay safe and healthy!"
"Nice job President Trump.

"As mentioned approx 3 weeks ago, bought $167. Today I sold $172 as previously predicted. The pattern streak remains intact. For those long-term longs, i hope it goes to $180 for you after earnings. I am not greedy and won't take that chance. ..... Does anyone sense the stock market could be getting ready for a big correction? Opinions appreciated."
"Up >9% in 15 trading days since buy, with div locked down, at >2x the 10yrT rate.. not too shabby. It's a keeper."
Is 3 m a unionized company?
That's what makes it go up. Accountability! Pattern since GE CFO took over looks pretty good to me.
"It's a dividend grower and cash flow is good. A clear buy at these levels, forget about the lawsuits.."
Waiting for pay cut announcements from 3M execs. The company / stock has underperformed with little end at sight. Time for those setting strategy and making directional decisions to become financially accountable. See other company’s leaders now doing it.
"Start positions in MMM at $200 and will add more position if it drops to below $200, it is a great company and it's for long term hold."
"I just read a statement made by 3M CEO Mike Roman on the company plans to supply N95 and other products to our medical providers and others in need. Where I can appreciate things must be very complex in terms of supply and adding manufacturing capacity, I must say I was disappointed. For a company that has been struggling for the last few years anyway, it just isn’t bold enough. Mr. Roman has a real opportunity here and frankly, it just doesn’t seem that he or his company is ready for it. Why??? Just my opinion which is worth very little to be honest."
"Must be the clocks and the 35K savings per year. Wow, couldn’t believe I was reading this in the news about this company. I certainly hope they didn’t need a project manager and a committee to implement this initiative. Kind of funny, really!"
Shall see over 200 when market open
I don’t know how the board can ignore this any longer if they are doing their job. This stock has plummeted while the Dow and S & P have flourished. Add the recent decline which has followed the market and you have a real dog stock on your hands. Time for a change in leadership. The market has no confidence in what is going on with the company and those that are leading it.
Stock is getting bashed after a good quarter. What gives?
Yippee. I can reinvest my dividends and get more shares than I was planning on
"ANOTHER huge up day for the Dow and 3M is DOWN. GE is up 90% since CFO Moaneesh left, and 3M has TRAILED S&P by about 15% in that period and delivered less than a third of GE. I'm sure Moaneesh wishes he had never left as do all 3M shareholders and employees."
"3M and The BrandLab (TBL) today announced a two-year initiative (2020 and 2021) focused on driving diversity within creative career paths, including graphic and industrial design. This partnership aims to inspire young, diverse high school students to pursue creative careers, address opportunity gaps for underrepresented students and embody a more culturally diverse population of creative talent for organizations that have a global footprint.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/2020"
"I own but would not buy above 160. It's ""alright"" but that's as far as I'm willing to go with MMM. It's probably one of those stocks that will trade sideways for years now."
So glad that folks are recognizing this is as close to a sure thing as you can get. When it comes to investing. These shareholders deserve these boatloads of  cash.
"It is very simple people. If you want to live in a free society where you get to save your earnings, you need to replace the present debt-based currency with an asset-based currency. Very simple solution."
"The downgrade by Credit Suisse is a joke. The money printing continues unabated, making each share of 3M worth more relative to each Federal Reserve note. 3M will continue to go up relative to the Federal Reserve note."
"When the Wall St wizards place a market cap on Netflix that is $40 billion higher than 3M's market cap, you just have to shake your head and go about your business. A quick read of the earnings release indicates growth across on areas. The dividend yield is great at these levels and there is relative low debt. Sure, the tariffs are going to hurt some but it just underscores the global reach of the company."
"All business units up, across the board. This is a really good CC."
"The mid-way point for the 52 week hi/lo is $178.00 and currently trading just below the high. MMM, I read, has law suits for sub-standard products. Perhaps its the China made items. If the law suits hit hard would the dividend also take a hit?"
I guess it was a screaming buy yesterday lol. Were up big today
"I'm a new 3M shareholder (since yesterday) and am happy that this great American company is making America great! Thank you, 3M management and employees for your hard work and ingenuity!"
"This company doesn’t seem to be able to figure out their top line sales growth woes. I am not close enough to understand it but can’t recall where MMM has announced anything new, significant or game changing in terms of new product introductions? They invest a lot into R & D so what’s missing? Eventually it has to deliver a return, right? I just don’t think their model of the past is working today? They used to be very close to their customers understanding what they want and need. I wonder if that is still the case and could be the reason for the lack of innovative products?"
"Having a feeling, MMM has put in a bottom of 160 last week. The latest product is likely going to be blockbuster for retail eCommerce packaging along with easier comps to lap by 2H of this year. Valuation hasn't been this cheap since 2011 when we had the global geopolitical turmoil last time. Curious to hear from other long-term holders in 3M stock..."
This fraud company will get the beat down for ripping off the USA.
"Okay, decided to give good, old, MMM, the old college try. Just picked up a few shares at 191 and change (1/2 of what I want). If it goes down another 10 or 20 points I'll double down. Could have a nice, steady, rise to 201 and change (200 day average). Downside possibly to 180 or slightly lower according to the chart."
This is a good paying dividend stockIt is better than the bank

"It was this price 4 yrs ago, smh. -13.5% earnings yoy, less than 2% revenue growth over the last five years, really what is to get excited about here? I don't see it at all...."
reading Mike Roman's statement on 3M website he isn't even producing for USA yet. He's just ramping up for USA. He's filling orders he received before the crisis. Am I misreading his statement.? He sounded like he had been caught red handed talking to Maria Bartiromo.
Great company all around wonder if they get affected by inflation. Does the company get hit by inflation and higher prices?
Pull up the 5 day. Coordinated wind down of the SP?
"3M lost its direction when it abandoned growth as a driver of earnings in favor of endless cost cutting and restructuring. When that wasn’t enough, they looked at stock buyback with borrowed money as a fix . And the sad story continues with empty promises of great turnaround strategies via yet more restructuring. starting to look like GE over the last 10 years. For years 3M ignored to address material water liabilities, kicking the problem Down the road until the State of Minnesota sued and won damages.. 3M took on a GE tactic & bully philosophy of driving Six Sigma which nearly shutdown innovation in favor of cost cutting.. Elon Musk was 100% correct in his statement that companies have too many MBA,S"
The management team has lost its way. Continue to make bad decisions.
"With div yield ~4% and a critical role to play in putting our economy back together, I’m stockpiling MMM in my IRA."
"I watched the show “Green Acres”yesterday. The farmer/lawyers’ workers wanted a raise. They were demanding $1.50 an hour. Show aired in 1968. Google won’t tell you anymore, but gas was $0.25 a gallon then. So, for one hour’s work, you could get $6 gallons of gas.At $15 per hour today and $3.00 a gallon, you can get 5 gallons of gas. The increase in price from 25 cents to $3 is a tax you pay to the Feds and to the banks to cover the cost of more government and more counterfeiting, respectively. The gallon less is the increased cost of living, caused by misallocation of capital, which too was caused by the Fed and the government. It is a 20% loss in the American standard of living. Soon gas will be $5 a gallon, giving you only 3 gallons for an hour’s work. Sadly we will then have a 50% reduction in our standard of living. All caused by the Federal Reserve system and excessive government spending."
When will 3m increase the dividend
Today I became a first time buyer of 3M at $189/share. Was this a good investment decision since I plan on holding thanks to an attractive dividend?
Guess it is 2M now...
Congratulations to 3M long timers. I sold before earnings and missed the big run. Good for each of you who held !
"Another up 4 down 5 run for 3M. This stock is stuck. Guess you have to sell it when it is up 4 because within a week, it will be down 5 from that point."
What just happened
Not that shocked at terrible reaction after what looked like a decent Q.Wall Street hates this company and management.Even new CFO seems to hate the company - all he talks about is negative outlook.Probably wishes he never left GE - they have WAY outperformed 3M sinch he left.
We are just a small large cap global entity...how could we possibly increase our mask production? We have only had over two months. Not buying it!!!
Peter Navarro today announced on Fox business news that they have requested a bid for a billion masks from 4 US mask manufactures.
"M stock price target cut to $158 from $178 at J.P. Morgan7:46 am ET January 15, 2019 (MarketWatch)Share Print"
Looking for a dividend increase today.Last year at this time MMM announced a 16% increase.
"Hey, how about a few commercials on actual 3M products that may drive sales versus the expensive PR commercials they have been running over the last few months? I do see occasional runs on Command strips but literally nothing else. Doesn’t 3M have a consumer business?"
"The SnP 500 has a p/e of 43. 3M has a p/e of 20, which is way overvalued when you are seeing 5% growth and billions in net debt. Regardless of the overvaluation math, 3M can double from here, sending the stock price to $406 per share. Why not? The other stodgy stocks in the SnP have already succumbed to the Fed money printing madness. No reason 3M can’t experience the same fate."
"PFE expects $33B in sales in the jab this year, the WSJ says. Now why can’t 3M get the government to market its products and to remove liability for any harm they may cause?"
