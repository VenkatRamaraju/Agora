knew it would collapse at end of the day. best days are way in the past for this terrible company
3M kills it. Expects EPS of $10. Stock at p/e of 20. Much more reasonable than other stocks in SnP 500.
"Open letter from lawyer Sidney Powell:July 25, 2021Paul Johnson The family that I want to spotlight today is the Johnson family. Paul Johnson was a peaceful protestor January 6th. The Johnson home was raided before dawn on April 13th. I have reviewed cell phone footage provided by his wife. I am not at liberty to share the videos with you yet. Dozens of armed agents in tactical gear pointed guns at their 7, 8, and 14 year old children. Their children were forced outside, half-clothed in 42 degree weather. The FBI raided their home for over 4 hours. The FBI refused the Johnson family a lawyer until they agreed to provide an interview first. The FBI would only show the Johnsons their warrant AFTER they conducted their raid. These actions are blatantly illegal. When I receive permission, I will show you these videos. Heartsick for this family."
"After the national immunization campaigns were initiated in the U.S. in the 1960s, for the first time in history, most U.S. infants were required to receive several doses of DPT, polio, measles, mumps and rubella vaccines.Tell Schools/Universities No Vaccine Mandates for Children/Young Adults!Shortly after, in 1969, medical certifiers presented a new medical term — sudden infant death syndrome.In 1973, the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics added a new cause-of-death category — SIDS — to the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD).By 1980, SIDS had become the leading cause of postneonatal mortality (deaths of infants from 28 days to one year old) in the U.S.As Miller points out in his article, the ICD category for vaccine-related death, or cause of death as “prophylactic inoculation and vaccination,” was eliminated when the ICD was revised in 1979 — despite the fact that this information would be useful in trying to understand the relationship between vaccination and death.But Miller, a medical research journalist and the director of the Thinktwice Global Vaccine Institute, provides an alternative route for establishing such a correlation — by observing the temporal relationship between vaccines and reported infant deaths, including SIDS deaths, in the CDC’s VAERS database.Miller found that out of a total of 2,605 infant deaths reported to VAERS from 1990 through 2019, the majority “clustered” in close temporal proximity to vaccination — 58% occurred within three days of vaccination, and 78% occurred within seven days of vaccination.Miller found the excess deaths within these ranges were statistically significant (p<0.00001), meaning the chance that this result is random is less than 0.001%."
excellent motley fool report today that describes Moaneesh as 'behind the curve'. I bet he wishes he had never left (or was fired?) from superior performing GE.
Did 3M lobby for passage of the new “infrastructure” bill? Look what big brother now has in store for you:https://www.ericpetersautos.com/2021/08/08/how-the-new-mileage-tax-will-get-your-old-car-off-the-road/
"Another terrible day. Hard to imagine this company used to trade at a premium to the S&P 500. All CFO talks about is negative outlook, so things must be pretty bleak. So sad for a formerly good company."
"ANOTHER huge up day for the Dow and 3M is DOWN. GE is up 90% since CFO Moaneesh left, and 3M has TRAILED S&P by about 15% in that period and delivered less than a third of GE. I'm sure Moaneesh wishes he had never left as do all 3M shareholders and employees."
We going down after earnings?
"In the 2020 fiscal year, the federal government borrowed 64% of the $6.5 trillion it spent. So most of what it spent came from the Federal Reserve and the banking system that turned government debt into dollar currency. That’s the real reason that explains why prices are rising. The quantity of dollar currency is soaring, but there is more reason to worry. Not only is this new currency still in the system, the Fed still has the money spigots wide open. It has to keep them open to provide the federal government with the dollars it is spending over and above what it receives from taxes. We will need to watch closely the next several weeks how high the politicians raise the national debt ceiling. It could be a whopper increase given the federal government’s spending plans, and that could send gold, silver, and the mining shares soaring.To bad they took the mining out of 3M."
"The downgrade by Credit Suisse is a joke. The money printing continues unabated, making each share of 3M worth more relative to each Federal Reserve note. 3M will continue to go up relative to the Federal Reserve note."
That's what makes it go up. Accountability! Pattern since GE CFO took over looks pretty good to me.
GM tanking huge today..MMM lost yesterdays gains I see also...hmmm
"If you still believe the media, when it comes to covid, watch this before it gets taken down (very short, must watch):https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_EjUfu7dktM"
Another day with Dow UP 200 and 3M DOWN. Tells you all you need to know about the company and stock. Just unbelievable this stock usde to trade at a premium to the S&P 500. When will the board take some kind of action?
"From the Pfizer supply agreement:""Purchaser acknowledges...the long-term effects and efficacy of the Vaccine are not currently known and that there may be adverse effects of the Vaccine that are not currently known."""
"Definitely one of the few companies I can trade confidently with . I have been getting so much joy investing all because of my earnings.Just perfect, I have been telling everyone how they gave me a ray of hope after I thought I had lost it all, now I have not only earned but also learned how to make market analysis.Deriv trading platform has been helpful even to me as an old trader and mostly newbies out there... I am still earning daily and growing my wallet monthly with Jame's Platform."
hard to understand this stock falling two days following a very good quarterly report and annual outlook. The concern with costs going up and supply chain issues isn't new. This has been around since the pandemic so not so sure why the analyst would be overly concerned with this particularly understanding 3M's ability to weather these types of headwinds. Just doesn't make much sense to me?
Why is John Deere red on earnings ? Did they warn ?
"If you are 10 yrs. old,great investment If you are 65 do not touch its toxic unless you want to break even when you turn 90. Buyer beware!!!!!!!"
"In the year 2000, 3M’s stock price was $30 per share. In the year 2000, gold was $400 per ounce. 3M was thus priced at 0.075 ounces per share. Today it is worth 0.11 ounces a share, a 48% gain over 21 years. That’s less than 2% a year. With the dividend, your talking about a 5% gain per year. But 3M also has taken on billions in debt. So when the easy money ends and 3M is not making any earnings and it’s stuck with billions in corporate bonds to pay, plus pension obligations, where’s the share price going to be then. Let’s say $60 a share if not bankruptcy. Gold will likely hit $10,000 an ounce then, given the market turmoil. Then you’ve got a 2,400% gain in gold over 22 years versus a 100% gain in 3M if not a loss."
"Richard Russell: “The end of capitalism will be due to the unbelievable amount of debt that is currently being created. This will create monster inflation that will destroy every currency. The only currency that cannot be destroyed is gold. When investors realize this, we’ll have the makings of the greatest bull market in gold ever seen.”But first, the big 4 banks holding the concentrated short positions on the COMEX in Au and Ag will have to be overrun, because the CFTC has demonstrated that it is going to do nothing about it."
"Any tick up is an excuse for big institutions to sell. Uncertainly over PFAS and hearing lawsuits is just too great for smart money, plus constantly negative outlook from CFO who probably wishes he had never left GE. They don't even raise guidance when Q1 and Q2 were significant beats, and KEEP saying RM costs are getting worse. So Sad."
Buy TZOO she turned the qtr eps and increased guidance
MMM is a buy at $171
"I watched the show “Green Acres”yesterday. The farmer/lawyers’ workers wanted a raise. They were demanding $1.50 an hour. Show aired in 1968. Google won’t tell you anymore, but gas was $0.25 a gallon then. So, for one hour’s work, you could get $6 gallons of gas.At $15 per hour today and $3.00 a gallon, you can get 5 gallons of gas. The increase in price from 25 cents to $3 is a tax you pay to the Feds and to the banks to cover the cost of more government and more counterfeiting, respectively. The gallon less is the increased cost of living, caused by misallocation of capital, which too was caused by the Fed and the government. It is a 20% loss in the American standard of living. Soon gas will be $5 a gallon, giving you only 3 gallons for an hour’s work. Sadly we will then have a 50% reduction in our standard of living. All caused by the Federal Reserve system and excessive government spending."
Great company all around wonder if they get affected by inflation. Does the company get hit by inflation and higher prices?
MMM is a buy and hold forever stock
"i work for this company and oh boy, i do not know how this stock goes up given our internal culture and metrics"
“U.S. homebuilder confidence falls to 11-month low in July“Devastating news for mmm
nice morning but sure it will give it all up - everyone hates this stock including the company itself who has no money to buy any stock back due to PFAS and hearing lawsuits.
3M will absolutely crush earnings. $225 in the next 90 days.
"According to CNBC, “Disney said Friday it is requiring all salaried and non-union hourly workers in the U.S. to be fully vaccinated in the next 60 days.”"
3M stock price is in decline
The first big publicly traded company to move its cash out of Federal Reserve notes into precious metals will be the big winner.
What's the five year lows for this one?
"According to CNBC, “Walmart said its corporate staff as well as management-level employees must be vaccinated against Covid-19 by Oct. 4.”"
"It is very simple people. If you want to live in a free society where you get to save your earnings, you need to replace the present debt-based currency with an asset-based currency. Very simple solution."

"Would you strongly encourage a friend to buy an airplane from a manufacturer who would not accept liability for their product and who’s product has already crashed a few times?Well, get this, 3M “strongly encourages” its employees to get the shot despite pharmaceutical companies refusing to accept liability for its product and despite many thousands of deaths and injuries being reported to VAERS. Perhaps injured persons can pursue 3M for following bad medical advice. Makes you also wonder if 3M wants to reduce its pension liability for those who took the annuity."
Pull up the 5 day. Coordinated wind down of the SP?
In 2018 3m was $259.00 a share my how the mighty have fallen and is going to keep falling.
"Malicious company. They pollute everywhere they can without thinking of consequences. You'd think they've learned from the lawsuit in Alabama, but no... they are also doing it in Belgium. ""American industrial group 3M has, for the first time, commented on the contamination of the ground around Zwijndrecht, Antwerp, with PFOS, which can cause all sorts of health problems, including cancer, after weeks of silence on the issue. 3M: ‘We will accept our responsibilities’"" - June 29, 2021Yesterday, the environmental inspection confirmed they are also ILLEGALLY polluting the nearby Scheldt river with FBSA and Me-PFBSA.The inspection also found out they produced more substances which weren't in the permit. This is just the tip of the iceberg..."
3M lost another lawsuit. This company stock price is going down.
"PFE expects $33B in sales in the jab this year, the WSJ says. Now why can’t 3M get the government to market its products and to remove liability for any harm they may cause?"
"Hate to say this but with the surge of the covid variants, 3M's offerings become more valuable. The N95 masks, PAPR's, health care products and cleaning products all should boom. At the same time, their other businesses could suffer if wide scale shut downs occurs again so suppose it could neutralize the demand?"
wow this is bad. bankruptcy imminent?
"All federal government workers must get da jab or lose their job. And they vote Democrat. And stole an election. Getting what they deserve? You try to feel sorry for them, but ... Next will be workers for the big corporations. The workers don’t own enough shares to stop it. And the executives generally speaking are spineless souls, many of whom sold their souls and freedom to secret societies. All the free money given out since 1913 makes them minor shareholders anyways. The big banks and the shareholders of the big banks control for the PTB. They’ll call the shots. You should have spoken up when they blew up the WTC buildings on nine eleven. Now your sweating it out. Soon you could be dead too."
"The Federal Reserve is buying up corporate bonds. The American citizen is paying for these purchases through, you guessed it, inflation. They hit a button, create the money, and buy up the bad investment, usually a bank’s bad investment. And you pay for it. This is NOT capitalism. It is Socialism with a capital “S”. Welcome to the new America."
Not that shocked at terrible reaction after what looked like a decent Q.Wall Street hates this company and management.Even new CFO seems to hate the company - all he talks about is negative outlook.Probably wishes he never left GE - they have WAY outperformed 3M sinch he left.
"Another conspiracy theory becomes a conspiracy fact. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is caused by childhood vaccinations. There is only a 0.00001 probability (0.001% chance) that it is not. But does the government or the pharmaceutical industry change or alter in the slightest their “vaccination” program or its schedule? No, of course not. Their actions are nothing short of human child sacrifice. Do you trust their vaccination recommendations for this new thing they call covid (to the extent it even exists)?Evidently 3M does because it strongly encourages its employees to get da jab."
Why did this wait for the usd to spike before it made a big move up? Illogical 
Why is Clorox tanking huge premarket ? Anyone know ?They have a lot in common with mmm product wise
"In their study and another from Duke University Medical Center, investigators examined cardiac MRI images from patients who received two doses of either the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines to see if they could identify a link between acute myocarditis and the shots.Researchers from both institutions conducted similar studies, looking at patients who presented with myocarditis post-vaccination between January and April 2021 and February and April 2021. Walter Reed examined 23 male patients between the ages of 20 and 51 who experienced onset of chest pain within four days of full vaccination, and Duke assessed seven patients between ages 23 and 70, four of whom developed symptoms within five days of full vaccination.All patients had elevated cardiac troponin levels, as well as abnormal electrocardiogram results. In addition, their cardiac MRI images showed findings that were consistent with myocarditis, including regional wall motion abnormalities, late gadolinium enhancement in a non-ischemic pattern, and elevated T1 and T2 in regions with late gadolinium enhancement.According to the researchers, all patients had been previously healthy, and clinical records pointed to no alternative explanations for their development of acute myocarditis."
Why is PPG tanking ?They have a very similar profile as MMM....

interesting AP story today about how china supply chain reliance is hurting competitiveness of US companies. could actually be a positive for MMM since their ineptitude over the years prevented them from benefiting from globalization. wonder if Moaneesh gets this?
"Very few Americans alive today know this: there was no inflation in the USA for the first 124 years. People think inflation is just something that happens. Nope. It is purely a product of the Federal Reserve system and its debt based currency. When the private sector got to use the currency of their choice, namely, gold, silver, nickel, and copper, there was no inflation. The precious metals were extracted out of the ground at the same rate as other industrial production. Prices only went down slightly as citizens got to reap the benefit of their improvements in productivity. Now the government and banks are robbing people blind, transferring that wealth to themselves and their shareholders through a legalized counterfeiting operation."
"VAERS data released today by the CDC showed a total of 463,457 reports of adverse events from all age groups following COVID vaccines, including 10,991 deaths and 48,385 serious injuries between Dec. 14, 2020 and July 9, 2021....Keep in mind: estimates are that only 10% of deaths and injuries are reported, at best. Many say only 1%. So take these numbers and multiply them by 10 to get a glimpse of what may actually be happening out there."
