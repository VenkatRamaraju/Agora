"Solid earnings should have made this pop higher, but they are watching the weakness in the mortgage forecasts now and pricing that in. This is pretty much the best Origination loan market play. With the Credit Bureaus you always have share shift and other stuff that can impact one vs the other, but here you win no matter what. Nothing like having a Monopoly on the only score everyone uses!"

"Thinking here;, taking my $178 buy profits and paying the cap gains OR transfer to my Roth IRA and then selling Too risky. Overnight this could collapse."

"Last 2 months have been a crapshow for this stock - not sure why as it has great tailwinds, but hoping it turns around soon!"
I was hoping FICO would move up from earnings... I donâ€™t know what to expect now. Any advice? Is Fintech the end of FICO?

"...'ac', 'kosher fries', I'm (quietly) readin' ya' homies...don't think you're voicing into an empty cave. I dumped FICO in my trading account, it had done faily well... bot at $375.-dump at 500(I think?) but its trading like other behemoths, like MA & V, neither of those have done anything for a great while... I think the prob w/FICO is new competitors, they (FICO) needs to adapt, or they focilize into a dinosaur. I'm trading dollars on my lonely one share in my IRA. lol."
