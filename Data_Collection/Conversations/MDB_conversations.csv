"THE WORSE CASE, MDB FILLS THE EARNINGS GAP, THEN GOES MUCH HIGHERBEST CASE, IT DOESN’T FILL THE GAP, AND GOES MUCH HIGHER"
thanks Goldman - they tank the sector by stating a fairly obvious stat. Funny how the market works sometimes.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-warns-of-a-dangerous-bubble-in-these-39-stocks-120015182.html?.tsrc=fin-srch
Calls to 550 are huge. Run is just starting

Buy before it's $600 !!
"If we have the correction that many smart people are predicting for the not-too-distant future, stocks such as MongoDB, which has never had any earnings, will take a big hit. Time to be cautious."

Insiders gapped it $100 to sell it back to $400
"After two years of holding Mongo (since $70/shr), I can tell you this: it WILL have a harsh selloff, probably next week. You will hear all the newbie shorts SCREAM how stupid you are to hold. The posting will be loud, relentless and you will be called names. Then things get quiet. Real quiet. Then slowly, Mongo starts to rise. MONGO EXPERIENCE TELLS ME: the *crazy, insane new high that couldn't hold* becomes a new target to revisit and all the amateur forum shorts start to short again, shorting more and more as it rises. Then BOOM. Mongo wakes up and rips people's lips off. Takes out the old high, pulls back a bit, consolidates for a week or two and BAM! Another new high, probably more short covering than anything else. I've watched this (as a long term investor) at least 10 times now. I stupidly sold shares along the way, but still have most of them. Find easier, safer shares to short. OR just buy the thing and never look at it."
"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so it's not surprising that Amazon would try to capitalize on the popularity and momentum of MongoDB. However, developers are savvy enough to distinguish between the real thing and a poor imitation,"" Dev Ittycheria, MongoDB's CEO, said in a statement provided to CNBC.Some software companies that work with open-source software have sought to limit what other businesses can do with their software as the cloud providers continue their expansions. MongoDB adopted a new software license in October.MongoDB's stock has risen 200 percent in the past year."
"Good that MDB will be on BABA cloud, given that their cloud business is increasing at a rate of over 60% YoY"
Can we get to over $400 with next earnings report?

"well, you can short it from $505 down to $480, or wait and short it from $550 to $530. Or wait longer and short it from $600 to $570. OR,... you can just BUY the damn thing at $500 and relax."
bearish engulfing pattern forming on insider pump.. $350 a month ago
WOW !!! Just wow. Bought 200 more a couple on minutes ago but did not expect the weakness. Any ideas other than hedge funds driving to get cheaper shares?
I am running out of money to buy more shares! 4 days until the announcement...
Bloated Pig......This valuation is a Joke
"Don't forget my target $600 !! Not far, may be by next earnings !!"
Good recap of MDB competition. https://boards.fool.com/when-cosmosdb-was-azure-documentdb-34109488.aspx?sort=whole
$45.89 all time high. MongoDB is going places.. We may be looking at $130-$150 in 12 months. Great company.
waaaay pass 1 yr target price...the stocks only go up when the big whales want it to go up after they bought all the cheap options

"It is true, after crashing over 56% from peak, Zoom is not as overvalued as something else such as bitcoin, $GME, $AMC, $SNOW, $SHOP, $TEAM, $SNAP, $DDOG, $ASAN, $CRWD, $ZS, $MDB, $OKTA, etc. However, for realistic investing purpose, it is foolish to compare Zoom to those things. When valuation for these extremely speculative bets is imploded, these bets could easily tank 90% or more, and even if Zoom tanks 70%, it is still a foolish bet nonetheless.Going forward, Zoom is only projected by stock analysts to grow annual revenue by 17.6% next year, and zero growth on annual EPS. If the future reality is slow growth or worse, the P/E ratio could easily reset to 15 or lower, and trigger a crash of over 80%.Any opposing opinions out there think for sure Zoom would continue peak pandemic type of hyper growth for many many many years to come, and further think that the stock analysts are all wrong ??? Please provide your thesis in details."
Solid quarter. 38 percent year over year increase in total revenue. 39 percent year over year increase in subscription revenue958 million in cash or equivalents. Solid and growing.
Shorts are trying hard. Cant break 500.....
WOW! Anyone shorted here got hosed! DOCN is a winner as well. Get some before triple digits IMO
Huston we have a problem. I said 550 not 450....
Any suggestions on a good Entry Point ford MDB….??
600 is coming ! Just have some pacience !
10% down this week is all I need
"If you compare with OKTA, MDB has a much lower Price to sales ratio, even though MDB is growing faster than OKTA."
"Seen this many times goes down 3- 4 days in a row and bounces right back with a vengeance.. My advice is if you're in a position to buy is to keep buying the dips.. Bought some yesterday and will continue to do so.. You'll be happy be happy u did in 5 years from now this could be a 5,to 10 bagger. But listen im very bullish on mongo know the company v well but DYOR, if u like what you see. Buy buy buy."
I'm buying puts on this .The growth is great but still the revenue is very low .
Used to own but no more until unless profitable. Spending money to sustain revenue growth is not attractive
A stealth stock...until earnings announcement next week.........load up while you can........
"Bought MDB at $50 three years ago, never selling!! Still only 25 billion market cap!"
MDB will be the biggest company in the world before year end. It will gain 3% everyday without shares being traded. Just hold on to your shares and watch it goes to $10000. What a wonderful company to invest in
What a great combination/collaboration! Been invested in Tencent for almost 6 years now.
Time to short!
70% gain on this stock
"boyoboy this is a wild ride even for Mongo! I don't know of another stock where I can say this seriously - ""by friday: $400 or $600?"""
Nobody here. Looks lile robot bumb stock.

"Bought in, looking forward to earnings report hoping the mkt is very receptive to them, normally I'd wait till after earnings but I'm very bullish. Would have jumped in last month but had to free up some cash. Good luck all."

"For those wondering why a 2ndary offering could help push up the stock price. It's because of 2 reasons: 1) This essentially guarantees that any dilution that occurs won't happen until 2024, and 2) it must be at a much higher stock price (or else the lender will just convert to cash instead of shares). All hyper growth software companies dilute during their growth stage to fund their sales ops. This just puts a cap and a guarantee on when MDB dilution can happen and at what price."
"Guys this is only the start.. MDB is only getting warmed up. I have done business with them in the past they are a great company, smart and dynamic. Everyone in the company has bought shares they have skin in the game so to speak , that's from the top down.. That's says everything. Why because they know its a great company and they believe they will in time be a massive success.. $100bn plus they will in time be the next Oracle. This is a great time to jump in. As you can see I'm very bullish, time in tell. I predict by end of year this will be trading at $120. Let's see."
Shorts are losing Made new high of $5188 percent are short with 5 million sharesIt may get to $600 in 4 months
Earning isn’t that great. Don’t know why the double digit surge
"Market cap is less than $8 billion. Somewhere between 95-98+% of the float is owned by 225 institutions. Over half of that is owned by large ones like American Funds, Fidelity, Vanguard, MS, and the majority of that money is in large mutual fund, in excess of $3 billion. Auto investing unless the mangement teams decide to peel back or get out altogether. In this scenario, you see what you saw the last two quarters, heavy accumulation immediately after a good earnings report. And Mongo won’t be making profits for at least a couple years. It’s all in the story, the long term, the growing revenues because their product is fantastic. From September 4th-September 14th, expect those institutions to purchase shares. They can’t buy them all at once. But as long as the ER report is what we expect, look for $140-155 September 4th to be somewhere between $180-210 September 14th. I’d say it’s close to inevitable. Something unexpected would probably have to go wrong for that not to be the scenario."
Looks like $MDB heading towards pre-earning price $400
The entire cloud software growth block got destroyed today. If someone tells you MDB dropped for any other reason they’re wrong.
"@Retirement Beer Fund - 6 weeks ago you called this exactly (with technical explanation) and predicted the short squeeze run-up at 22% short float. I still don't think it'll break 185 in 2-3 weeks, but I'm hoping you continue to be correct. Tip of the cap to you! So my question for you is what do you feel is an appropriate short float for MDB?"

"CEO sells 2% of his shares - every qtr we have to repost this because the headline states a fact, but doesn't paint the whole picture. The CEO and many others sell shares as planned every qtr. EVERY qtr. It's PLANNED. He started with 1,656,000 shares and has sold 300,000 over the past 23 months, but still has over 80% of his original shares. It's pretty consistent with other leaders in MDB too. So Dev sold 23,000 of his 1,300,000+ shares.That has little to do with the stock price."
"Den, for you. BPT start, up potential 350%. long"
Regarding Cramers rule of 40. So the revenue growth for the quarter just gone came to 67% you deduct from that the EBITDA % which I make to be - 15% (-$14.8m / $99.4m) when you add the two together its higher than 40% and yet Cramer says MDB doesnt qualify under the rule of 40?
Biggest SCAM I've ever seen into my trading Carrier..........
Full year EPS guidance below expectations .... ($1.01) vs ($1.07) guidance
"I monitor the number of job opening for MDB on LinkedIn and it is increasing. The number of books on it are also increasing. My friends who work with databases do not know much about it. This is good since it means there is lots of opportunity to switch over to mongo, it is bad since it is not on fire as they say and everyone jumps to it. It believe that one day there will be a huge jump to it unless Microsoft does a knock off of it. I own 200 shares."
"Sometimes this board will go days without anyone posting. Then you get a move like this week, and the board is closed with posts talking about easy short, no profits, overvalued, blah blah blah. Can only surmise lots of people lost alot of money being against MDB this week. Pretty funny. Things will settle back down. Just going to continue to hold, and trade around the edges. $1000+ in a couple years. gltal's"
Why is it falling after market?
"Lucky, happy, happy go lucky shareholders here"
When will they be profitable? 2023 2024.
"Wow , this stock is so bloated right now."
"To all those complaining about profitability: you are missing the point on profits (or lack thereof).Q4 they posted non-GAAP -$.17 compared to estimates of -$.38 – huge beat. Also they continue to trend in the right direction toward profitability. Q1= -$.43, Q2= -$.41, Q3= -$.20, Q4= -$.17. While they are not making money YET, they are on a path towards that and more quickly than anticipated by the street.Projecting into this coming year they are forecasting non-GAAP -$.98 to -$1.06 and this was compared to the expectation for the year at -$1.28. All trending in the right direction as MDB continues to under-promise and over-deliver. And they have PLENTY OF CASH to bridge the gap to that point – they are managing this well while generating an extremely high growth rate.Also, as has been stated a lot on this board, it’s a typical tech company less than 1.5yrs from their IPO so most are not expecting profitability in the first few years. Using a P/S ratio with the new revenue numbers and P/S=17.6 which is slightly high comparatively – I’ll give you that.I had a 2019 end-of-year target of 140, but may have to adjust that upward slightly if they continue to outperform. Regardless, I’ve been in since the 30’s buying along the way and will continue to hold long-term until this story shifts. This company is truly a ""market-disruptor"" that is well managed."
"I don't believe this stock is in a downtrend... just hanging out in a trading range of 125-145. I think it will stay here until next earnings announcement (about 5-6 weeks) or AMZN announces some upgrade to their forked version of Mongo from January this year. Assuming another strong beat the stock will continue up, but the AMZN announcement will definitely bring the stock down (at which point I will be buying more just like the previous AMZN news). I still have this stock valued at 140 based on future rev P/S ratio of 20. After Q1 & Q2, they could guide higher and would be an adjustment to that. Leo timed calls well at the low point of that range."
I am raising target to 600 !!
Charts pointing to $600 on this and 700 before EOY !!
"How high would MongoDB's stock be if the company actually made a profit? If we have a major correction, this is the type of stock that will be crushed."
Next week offering at 450.....
"My expectations for the results tomorrow:Most important – rev & rev guidance. Expected $74m for Q, $244m to end this year. A beat by 10%+ for Q will be a nice signal. For the upcoming year I expect guidance of $350-$380m (45-55% growth) – this is probably the most important number for the entire release. Anything shy of $350 I think will have a significant downside effect to stock immediately. I would be absolutely shocked to see them guide anything higher than $380m since they are known to under-promise and over-deliver. Customer count and Atlas growth will also be interesting.Next most important – earnings (or lack of). They are guiding -$.38 for Q, -$1.52 for Yr. The big wild card is Mlab since they are now included in the numbers for the first time. This could have a significant effect on EPS in the near-term. Hoping not to miss the Q by more than 10% to downside. For the upcoming year analysts forecasting -$1.28. I’d love to see lower than that with a positive EPS in 6 quarters so they should have a path to profitability through this year into next.Lastly, cash flow. They’ve done a nice job managing this at -$9.7m last Q with $523m cash on hand. I expect somewhere near the same this Q which gives them plenty of cushion to focus on growth.It’s been a resilient stock recently – see what happens tomorrow afternoon!"

Expect a 343MM TTM Revenue come earnings report 9/4. Positive cash for the quarter. This will lead to a spike up to 160+. This stock is like clockwork. See you in September.
We ain’t seen nothing yet in this stock. The float is minuscule and 96% of the shares are either institutional or insider owned. Not much to trade. Big Data is a huge arena to be in. This stock has a lot of legs despite the run-up. IMHO
Nvda earnings shows a hint for mdb earnings. All revenue dropped except for cloud data center which increased by 20%. Mdb literally owns that entire space. I suspect the earnings growth will be astounding and might even hit 100% increase. In that case except the share price to go to 180 easily day after earnings.
"2/19/20 Update - Share price just touched $180, with $184 being all time high. This means that the outstanding 7.77M shares shorted (21.4% of float) is pretty much guaranteed all under water and will face margin calls eventually. My guess is that with the market as hot as it is (Chinese/APAC investors fleeing to US for safety & yield) we'll touch all time highs before the 3/11 earnings.If the 3/11 earnings are good to great, and there is no market wide correction, then I can see the short squeeze pushing this to $230 before the next quarter report."
I've used their product. Good product. But the stock price is highly distorted by cheap money. As rates rise this will fall back to where it is properly valued.
"Sold to take profits for the year, will buy back after it falls under 200."
"This qtr was great on all fronts - rev, eps, and cash flow - love it.Getting hammered on full year guidance adjustment from the previous qtr. Was $-.98 to $-1.06. It is now $-1.04 to $-1.11. I suspect this is because of the new GAPP 606 accounting plus the Realm acquisition which won't hit the books until next qtr. I think this price action is oversold at the moment but we won't see a new base at 150 with the new guidance this qtr."
down after hour
"The math says MDB is going to more than 10X the next five years! should be doing over 12 billion in revenues in 2026, and that is without making any acquisitions!!!"
"Crazy overvalued. Max $800m in revenue this year valued at $30billion+ Making a loss, used up most of their cash since ipo. Got debts."
"I am trying to share some more detailed info around why the stock is down, but yahoo isn't liking it.In a nutshell, it's down because of the comments they made about pulling in EA sales from Q3 to Q2 because of ASC 606 rules. Basically, the qtr wasn't quite as strong as it seemed and the 2nd half comps will be tougher.They are shifting from hyper-growth to only strong growth. Valuations matter."

I'm definitely selling MDB and buying back after earnings. Just look at all these cloud companies tanking. Okta / veev / ZM.
"MDB’s recent announcement of partnering with Google and Tencent, the two giant Social media platform with big data will benefit MDB’s business positively."
"Mdb represents the database of all other databases. It is web scale and outperforms everything else. Plus mdb is building atlas, the most advanced db technology ever known to man. This database is used by any company that has a website, and app or pretty much any software."

Why the stock is dropping today?
"well played by MDB.... conversion price of $211, convertible with cash if it hits $275 by 2023..... minimal dilution.....can you say buy signal? glta"
"MDB reports Monday, my outlook for Q3. It’s interesting to note that MDB has beat Rev and EPS guidance every Qtr since going public and I would expect nothing different this time around (if they miss, specifically on Rev, it will get crushed… but don’t expect it). Rev continues to be the strongest indicator at the moment forecasted at $99m. They have beaten by 8% the last 2 qtrs so would expect something similar (which is 67% growth rate but Q4 comp will be much tougher). Over the past 6 qtr they have beaten Rev by 10%. Less then $107m for the qtr is just ok, $107-115 is strong, and $115m+ is outstanding. Obviously these numbers will impact annual guidance as well with only Q4 remaining. Another meaningful revenue number is the increase in customers spending $100k+ and I’m looking for this number to be growing at the same rate as sales but hopefully better (these customers make up about 66% of rev).EPS expected at $-.28 and would expect a small beat by a few cents. If they’re able to come in $-.22 or better I would consider that meaningful. Cash flow expected to be a slight draw down for the qtr too, but as I’ve said in the past they’re managing this well. They were at $436m end Q2 and expecting a draw down of about $15m to around $420m cash on hand. Adjusting any future guidance downward will get the stock crushed too (ref ESTC).So what does this all mean for the stock price? I have no idea. I can tell you that most cloud stocks I’ve referenced in the past have been flat or lost value after ER despite all having pretty solid reports (exception being TTD which started the Nov sector rally I believe). Some would call the sector volatile, some would call it complete manipulation – call it whatever you want but don’t expect rational stock price behavior whatever the ER ends up at. For the moment, I still believe long term in the company and will be interested to listen in to the call again Monday evening."

"It’s interesting to compare this to SNOW valuation. While MDB revenue projections aren’t quite as aggressive, it still shows substantial upside. Shorts, you can spare me the overvalued no earnings garbage commentary."

"A few quick take-aways from the Q1 report:1. Revenue beat for the qtr and annual rev adjustment up for the year – they’re growth rate is stellar2. Cash flow – first qtr they reported positive FCF – huge deal specifically when they aren’t yet making money. As they said on call, that won’t be the case for the remainder of the year, but still a nice win and it happened more quickly than projected.3. EPS – nice for the qtr, but the big news was the downward adjustment for the yr. That’s a real bummer and caught me off guard. It’s due mostly in part to the Realm acquisition & ASC606 – I think management just missed it which is disappointing. However, I still expect them to beat new guidance and come in better than ($1.00) EPS for the year.4. Realm – this could be a real competitive advantage for them as they stated it brings them much more robust data synchronization in the mobile platform and more development is going this direction. It will be an advantage over AMZN, their biggest competitor.5. Market size – they stated an adjustment to this at the very beginning of the call and the db market is now growing at 11% CAGR above the 9% CAGR previously stated. It is now a $64b market growing to $98b in 2023. The $34b in new market will almost all come from “new structures and new workloads.” That means MDB has about 0.1% of the new growth!!!! This is absolutely insane and the growth potential for MDB is enormous. This is why the stock is trading higher than 20 fwd P/S ratio.6. Competition – overall it’s minimal: a. Microsoft – they’ve had Azure/Cosmos in place for 2+ years – no impact to MDB b. Oracle – asleep at the wheel and content with traditional SQL c. Google – the recent partnership makes it less likely they will “pull an AMZN.” d. Niche players – yep, they’re out there and have less market share than MDB, see #5 above e. AMZN – that is their real competition and they will certainly win business from MDB, but there is so much new market business coming on line that it doesn’t matter. If MDB were to capture just 5% of the space by 2023, they would have nearly $5b in rev!!!"
Smart money and MF loading up at this discount price....
"MDB reminds me exactly of salesforce in it's early days. The customer base is growing exponentially and they are on a growth and hiring binge. Earnings will eventually turn around and rise, just not now....."
"The questions that you have to ask yourself is... Are the underlying fundamentals still intact, could MDB turn a profit if they were to sacrifice some measure of growth and are we being played by the big institutions I believe the answer to all 3 is yes. I will need to drill down into their operating expenses but I am reasonably confident that if they were to trim back on their expenditure they could achieve a positive EPS."
Mongo SP taking a hit the last week but nothing to do with the fundamentals as they are solid. should pick end of the week or next week unless trade war escalates and who knows. Expecting very strong growth and beating next Q earnings. Long termers have nothing to worry about with this company as they are a well run outfit. Hoping it be well over $120 plus by year end.

"Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Total Revenue of $199 million, up 44% Year-over-Year"
Eps is $-4.62. Just saw that.
"I’ve been in this stock for 18 months – my expectations for results tomorrow:Expected revenues of $83m. I’m guessing there will be a moderate beat (less than 10%). If they miss, the stock will get slaughtered, but they have continuously under-promised and over-delivered. A beat of greater than 10% for the qtr and the sky is the limit.Next most important – earnings (or lack of). They are guiding -$.24 for the qtr. I hoping they can at least meet or beat which will continue to show a trending progression towards profitability (which I think they can meet sometime in 2020). They’ve met or beat every qtr since going public – we’ll see if they continue to the trend.Lastly, cash flow. They’ve done a nice job managing this but moved from $523m cash on hand to $466m – another acquisition won’t help this but that won’t close until next qtr so they should have minimal impact to the $466m this qtr which is necessary to bridge the gap until profitability - this gives them plenty of cushion to focus on growth.I’ve valued MDB at 140 using P/S=20, so I don’t think there is a huge upside unless they surprise significantly (which I think they can do)."
They should make secondary offering right now at this 52 wks high price. Next week may be?....
"volume 6 million shares- 10 times normal, and never once moved down toward the gap, heck never moved down at all. Look for another 10 points on tuesday."
Most volatile stock i have ever invested in!
"April quarter the company 10Q reported 934 million in cash, burned about 10 million in that quarter, largely because AR went up (which is what happens when sales are growing). So at that rate they will run out of money in 23 years.Don't let the shorties make you nervous,"
What do you enjoy more? The stock or comments about the stock?
"Very soon MDB will be traded at $100B market cap ($1,500 per share) like peers SnowFlake (SNOW). Both have cloud based database service and similar revenue projection for next year. Cloud based database with various types of subscription features helping all types of businesses for their database needs at cheaper cost."
SELL SELL SELL take the earnings profit before it crashes down
"Short the pig at $495, hold tight, it’s going down the hill in the PM today"
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
What is the forward revenue multiple that mdb is at now??? I like this increase but there is no news associated to it which is odd
"LIKE I SAID, WORSE CASE MDB GOES DOWN TO FILL THE EARNINGS GAP. NO BIG DEAL LONG-TERM"
"Still love MDB as a company, and believe this spike in cloud engagement will raise all boats in the business. Only concern is how impacted the enterprise sales force is, without being able to meet customers. But MDB is extremely simple for devs to set up and get started with at home."
Is this good dip to buy?
Loaded calls to 550 !
Will go down after market line all tech stocks.Short it
This stock won't be reaching its full potential until at least 3-5 years out. It's just one of my stocks I can just comfortably leave in my portfolio no matter the ups or downs. But I have to admit it's very nice to see days like these.
"Another post for long-term investors. A few months back I was inquiring around the TAM specific to the NoSQL market but wasn’t able to find anything. This article is the best breakdown to date that I’ve seen (realize this is company agnostic).On conference calls, MDB leadership continually references the database mkt growing from $64b to $98b in 2023 at 11% CAGR – it’s a massive market. We know this is predominantly legacy db structure but I’m more curious with new db structure (document-store, NoSQL structures, etc). The “new stack” market is growing at nearly 2x of the legacy market at 21% CAGR through 2022 and you can see that NoSQL comprises the largest spend at $13b. Working backwards you see a current NoSQL market of about $7.3b – MDB has about 6% market share (up from 4% last year). Given all that has happened in the past year (rev growth, major partnerships with MSFT, GOOG, BABA, AMZN, protection of IP, and developer mindshare), I see this opportunity for market share growth as absolutely fantastic. The question is can MDB execute? I think they can but only time will tell.https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/new-software-stack-2019"
MDB CFO gave very impressive talk on CNBC interview! Will buy more....
"Biggest regret stocks wise.. I don't have this one. I might've just buy, bottom line. Bc it's been slipping away, along being super busy with all other stocks. Definitely expensive, but big, big regret - great company, great story. Congrats to longs"
Agree but surprised at the large negative EPS for 2022 guidance. I thought they’d be working it down By now. Forecast rev growth at 28% not bad since they always beat.
I sold all today. Done with tech as yields moving fast with October in play.

Looks like a technical short-term bottom is forming..
don't see this not giving off some of its gains today. just profit taking though
Earnings no good. Revenues declining. Losses increasing. A lethal combination for a growth company. A correction to the stock price is In order

"congrats to the shorts - just a word of caution - when you make a nice wad from this, cover. Don't get greedy - listen to your gut on this. This stock is psycho and will suddenly turn at some point."
"Great entry price, closing at 550...."
Back to $490 in couple of weeks.
$NET is hardly very expensive at these levels considering their new Apple iCloud+ partnership and all the recent systems breaches around the world. Look at $MDB and what it trades for... $200-300 next year isn't unrealistic! I use NET in my day to day work and it's amazing.
"At some point, probably sooner than later MDB will run, shorts will cover and it will run real fast. We could see 10% plus day easily. Hang in there longs."
"I think most people don't realize how transformative this company is. It isn't a question of if Oracle will buy it, the question is will MDB want to buy Oracle just to get their customer list."
This is how you call to the moon baby
"WOW! HUGE BEAT! ALSO, PICK UP SOME DOCN (Digital Ocean) Imo"
"I don't think the market will be rewarding tech stocks that are losing money in the near term. MDB has accelerating losses with no sign of profitability, and yet it has a $17B market cap. In a rising rate environment with the very real threat of inflation, investors today want to see reliable profits."
"the sad, tragic beauty of pretty much all shorts in these chat forums is they are all new at it. Professionals who short don't come to these boards. Pros are usually short for very brief periods, especially with something psycho like Mongo DB. If you're thinking about shorting Mongo, think about what happens if you get your position wrong. Lots of newbie shorts are finding that out today. Don't take advice from shorts on discussion boards, especially this one. If you DO short this, you may end up being right for a brief period of time - decide in advance what price you will cover at and DO NOT WAVER from that. Mongo has a history of diving lower than anyone expects and that hits the greed button for newbies, who should cover but then see extra dollar signs that just aren't there. Then BAM. Days like this. There are easier stocks to short."
"I see a lot of people claiming that this is an easy short at 90s. Please note that nothing in this market is obvious and especially not some random day trader on this chat board. The big boys are buying and going long. Mdb is easily worth 40b. Either through acquisition or through stock price increase. That implies a $300 share price. Book to value, valuations DO NOT APPLY HERE. mdb powers the cloud literally. Skys the limit here. Pun intended"
"What news came out? I'm long and strong with Mongo, but I'm curious about the report. Does anyone have a link?"
"I'm not quite sure what to make out of this DocumentDB news? Apparently documentdb is only compatible with the previous, 3.6 version of MongoDB, and not the current 4.0 version. Some say it will solidify MongoDB as the standard, which would be a positive. Others say AWS is making a play to take over the DB service market. Thoughts?"
This stock is good hold for both short and long term gains..
"The valuation is stupid, they are losing money & are way over valued. Yet, solid growth companies that are debt free & making a lot of money are having a hard time with valuations. At 32 billion not many companies can afford the price tag, this is due for a reckoning, how are they not able to transform this db into real $$? Appears the licensing model is not what it should be."

He addressed Lyft transition as they were an acquired customer through Mlab running on 2yr old platform and Mlab's infrastructure to support these customers was minimal. Lyft was not a legacy customer, but an acquired one from a few months ago.Downside - MDB wasn't able to keep the customer.Upside - Lyft wasn't using Atlas so this is not a direct comparison between MDB Atlas and AMZN.As with any acquisition, there will be some customer transition. Funny that it dropped 10% on that."

"The action over yesterday and today signals to me that the leading tech cloud sector selloff is over from the month of Sept. I realize the markets are getting clobbered from macro-economics, but my point is specific to the cloud sector selloff which was about 25% for most stocks (in this specific sector) during the month of Sept all due to high valuations. Overall I view this as a good thing given that the last month has been brutal. If MDB (and it's cloud peers) were all selling off greater than the market, I would be more concerned.My 2-cents but what the heck do I know - I'm a long term guy. Welcome your thoughts on that outlook...."

I'm going to go for. Margin borrow and get 1m worth of shares. This should hit 115 by earnings easily and I can just pick up profits before hand and earn more after earnings. @BOurne you da man. If I just do this one trade I'll be all set
"Everything I sold at 169 and 180, I've bought back between 147 & 156. The action on this stock is really interesting, but it's still trading at a premium. I am still very long on this stock so it will be interesting to see - I agree with APL's post.Lots of people making some pretty crazy predictions on this stock - I doubt we see any new highs before Q2 results released early Sep and we hang in this trading range until then.Regarding Benjo - that guy is classic! He shorted the stock from 30 up to 90 saying it was horrible. Then it goes to 155 and he says it's going to 200. It promptly went down to 130. Then it recently goes to 184 and he says it's going to 220 or whatever and then it goes down to 150. Absolute classic!!"
"SHORTS ARE BURNING5 Million shares shorted. 9% of available float. Over 7 days average volume to cover. We're only at the beginning of this ride up, as most of the shorts won't cover immediately."
"APL, I agree that Fri performance wasn’t so bad given the situation. Presifdsdsf – thanks for the shout out. I have been long since shortly after the IPO like several others on this board and continue to remain optimistic for the long term future for MDB. The volatility over the past 6-9 months has been amazing and presented some great trading opportunities, but the company remains strong. 4 major points…………….. #1 – All eyes on Q2 and if they significantly outperform Q2 then this year will be a blowout. They stated on the conf call that Q2 comps will be tough and they underestimated the longer term impact of COVID so I expect Q2 to be somewhat muted performance and expect the uneducated to come out screaming that growth has slowed………………. #2 – the competitive landscape remains excellent. Notice there isn’t talk on this board any longer of AMZN crushing them. Again, they commented about this on the call and the partnerships with AMZN, GOOG, MSF, etc all remain strong helping them drive sales. They have $550M rev in a $70B market – I see significant upside…………………… #3 – Developer mindshare; this may be the biggest moat MDB has created with the volume of developers preferring MDB as the go-to NoSQL/Document database. This is not something easily replicated by new organizations with a better mouse-trap. Developers are the real decision-makers in this space…………………. #4 – Also mentioned on the call was their switch in cost where they are aggressively (and unexpectedly) hiring new talent rather than waiting to 2021 as planned because COVID has presented an opportunity. I love this move but unfortunately will drag down margins for the next 2 qtrs so again I see short-term performance as a challenge……………………… overall I see continued short term volatility (which will probably mirror all the other data stocks until the next earnings report), but the long term future continues to look excellent. They are highly valued no question (as are most other data companies) especially for not making profits, but the market is picking their winners. MDB also has a crazy-strong cash position at $900M+ to weather a long road when you look at a typical FCF of only -$8.5M from this Qtr. My prediction for this stock to double to $260 by Dec 2021 (made 7 months ago) looks to be safely intact, but the market is full of surprises too. Thanks to those who post insightful & educated opinions on this board regardless if you’re short or long."
"9 Million shares short. That's 24.92% percent of the available float. And at the current price, almost all of them are underwater. At the current trading volume, it would take 8 days of non-stop buying to cover. This is a short squeeze happening, no doubt about it."
All cloud companies are at 52w highs and over 30 price to book ratios. So valuations for these companies are normal until there is some indication that cloud is slowing down. Which it isn't at all. Okta estc coupa for example
"If you adjust for the MLabs acquisition, organic revenue growth is decelerating to 40% or so in the next quarter."
"just a word of advice to shorts from someone who has been in the stock for the last two years: EVERYONE is expecting the overall market to tank in the next few days or so. EVERYONE. During market tanks (and you can do your own research on this) Mongo DOES NOT selloff at first. In fact, it usually GOES UP. Don't know why. Then, a day or two into the harsh macro selloff, it finally relents and joins the pain party. So if you're waiting for the Big Selloff coming up to short it (if it even happens), give Mongo a day or two to join in. I don't care either way since I'm a LONG long, but thought I'd do you guys a favor. It snaps back up in a wicked way, so be nimble. Frankly, Life is easier if you just buy it and hold it for a couple years. Just sayin'."
I love these dudes. They were all waiting to cover in PM after morning run up. Now they are posting. They have their 31 cents correction for the long weekend.
"0.41 loss (consensus 0.45), sales 57.5m (51.7 estimate) - seems like a beat but afterhours not liking it."
"My expirience with AWS RDS (managed databases) are, that you are very limited with tweaking important database settings in case of advanced usage or performance tuning. from the cost side, you have to pay for the managed DB service more or less the same price if you build up and manage your setup by yourself on ec2@aws instances. In other words, if you are not a sophisticated or advanced user of this technology, you'll be fine with the Amazon provided service (which has also advantage in a multi AZ deployment). If you more like a technology freedom and participate on latest innovation, you will build your own custimoized MongoDB solution. The major question is, how the license model MDB will look like for cloud based usage. If the go the same way like ORCL, I'll sell all my MDB's. In the meantime, I'm long and I trust the MDB guys, that they will not make the same mistakes like ORCL or MSFT in the cloud business. There is a huge market for non relational databases and the winner will be in my optinion MDB. I can imagine, that MDB is a lucrative candidate for a take over for the legacy DB supplier."
"Funny happenings today - shorts were squealing all day!!I sold a minor position at 169 today - think I'll be able to buy back in lower over the next 60 days but we'll see.Regardless I'm still long MDB hopefully for several years to come!!Side note - when they announced Q4 there was a similar run-up from 125 to 155. I never expected it to get that high back then, but could do something similar again this time around where they run-up for several days after earnings. Who knows?"
What is happening
"Compare market cap of Oracle ($182B) with current market cap of MDB ($3 B). They are in the relatively same business with the difference that MDB is far more modern and in a much faster trajectory, with far more flexibility. Most future databases will rely on unstructured technology developed by MDB. It’s like comparing Wolkswagen bug (Orcl) with Tesla (MDB). It’s just the matter of time before investors realize this. The early birds will catch the warm. There are multiple bags from $3B to $183B. Enjoy the ride!"
This is a generational stock just getting started. long from ipo and bought a little more yesterday Miles to run. glta
MDB is incredibly discounted. Soon institutional analysts covering MDB will upgrade and or reaffirm their positive price guidance

Someone please make some sense of this? 11% rally on what? Getting nervous about my iron condors. There's so many document db's out there: AWS has it's own. Elastic does a great deal better in some scenarios than MDB. Azure Cosmos implements MDB's protocol. What are institutions buying into at this price?
Price/Sale = 50 and loss making year after year after year. Crazy market cap. Target $87.
"With MDB near ATH, it’s interesting how MDB is evolving/changing open source licensing with the SSPL. The article below goes into more detail, but I think this becomes an important part of MDB’s future. Two things I think are foundational here. 1. MDB management should be commended for enforcing the SSPL prior to the AMZN DocumentDB launch; they knew it was coming forcing AMZN to go retroactive to a previous version. It would have been pretty bad if they were just coming out with the SSPL now, after the AMZN announcement. While it’s not fail-safe (not sure anything can be in the open source world), it was proactive vs reactive which gives me more confidence in management’s abilities.2. The community at large has not had a significant reaction one way or the other. As stated in the article, OSI hasn’t taken a strong stance on the SSPL. It’s clearly done enough to put DocumentDB in a defensive position, and I’ve only heard of one significant player (Red Hat) opposing it. It appears that the community is fairly neutral which I think is a good thing since it has some traction and limited down-side.I don’t think this resolves in 1-2 months but we’ll get a real sense for the effectiveness and acceptance of this by year end. Time will tell. Here is the article."
If MDB marking at $485 in closing.It is still attractive to meet the target at $570.

"MDB Short Update: 9.2 Million shares short. 26% of the available float (that's higher % than Tesla's short covering from $300 to $900). Shorts are doubling down on their gamble and now will need 9 straight days of only buying, to cover. MDB reports earnings next Tursday, 6/4. As MDB has a track record of beating estimates, and since their licensing is usage based, I tentatively expect MDB to exceed earnings and lift forecast this time around. If investor response is positive, then get ready for a massive short covering rally."
I shorted comfortably !!! This is too good to be true!!
Please Get out while you can from MDB bc Software giant MSFT is building better company.

Smart money buying with tow hands....
I've sold my entire position yesterday... I wish all longs the best of luck. When the exec directors keep dumping their shares it makes me feel really unsettled. If they don't have confidence in their own offering how could I? I wrestled with this for quite some time. When I heard the audio cast about China the CFO was not that upbeat about it (perhaps he was trying not to give too much information to the market?). That for me was it. Do I believe it will still go up in the distant long term... Yes I do but I'm an agile trader I don't like to keep for months and months if I can help it. Au revoir friends perhaps I may rejoin in the future.
Stock prices are determined by a number of factors at the moment price is at the 50 & 200 day moving averages this will cause some swings. Earnings season has kicked off and the banks are reporting good numbers. This will see some solid action push through stocks across the board. Keep in mind that there 50k stocks for money to move in and out of hence the low volumes on certain days.

"Do the hedge funds flip coins and decide which stock gets to fly, and which ones ""get a haircut"" on earnings?"
It looks like $140 is a rock-bottom for MDB . I sold strike 140 puts for more than a month in every week but never got assigned.Maybe I should just buy some stocks near 140 and wait the SP to bounce back to 150 up and sell.
"This post is for long term investors (been posting here for nearly 2yrs). I have 2 major take-aways after listing to the quarterly cc yesterday and then the investor call today (replay can be found on MDB website).1. Amazon is not nearly the threat I thought they were. Dev stated that MDB was one of the biggest sponsors and most highly attended booths at the recently completed AWS show. That along with the lack of announcements from AWS about the forked version they deployed a year ago means partnerships are strong. Add that to the other partnerships and wow! AMZN, BABA, MSFT, GOOG – all great for MDB. There is no other NoSQL database company with this platform breadth or developer mind-share. 2. The growth rate is transitioning, it’s not slowing. It appears by the numbers qtr-to-qtr that the growth rate is naturally slowing from +70% rev growth to 40%. However, as they’ve said on the multiple calls the comparison in switching to ASC606 this year gave them some difficult comps. Also CHINA. They stated this is they’re biggest market and it’s mostly untapped. The recent BABA partnership (and, more importantly, the formal IP work surrounding that and their work in China) and this will explode in the next 18 months. They stated not to expect substantial results in Q4 or really even Q1 but it will materialize. I can see the 2nd half of next year as a major win and possibly 60% growth rates again.From these two facts (along with many others that I’ve posted before) I see the long-term 2-yr play as an easy double from this price today ($128). The question in the short-term is will the big guys get in now or wait 6-9 months in this choppy market?"
I’m glad people are pumping this broke and overpriced stock.
"MongoDB reminds me of 1999-2000 when many unprofitable companies were so inflated. MDB is not profitable, and their ER in Sept. is modeling more losses. I mean, a $3B market cap with $300M in revenue losing money? This stock has a long way to fall. I'm not short, but if it climbs any higher than where it is now ($150) I will be."

"""We remain bullish on the prospects for MDB to sustain high growth,"" KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts Brent Bracelin and Clarke Jeffries wrote in a note distributed to clients later on Wednesday. They said the cloud database market can handle multiple competitors and that MongoDB has ""differentiated functionality"" available in its newer software.Cloud deployments are a growing part of MongoDB's business. The company offers a cloud-based version of its own database software atop the AWS computing and storage infrastructure, as well as on other clouds, including Microsoft Azure. AWS salespeople have been able to co-sell MongoDB's software running on AWS."
MDB is among the most overvalued stock==strong sellTarget $125

"All quiet on this board at the moment.......suspect the message count will soar after ER. Expecting a monster quarter, way ahead of expectations."

"Did you know hw to get $1000 in just a few days, Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth. "
this reminds me of CMGI in 1999; way way way overbought and then complete destruction by 2002. Longs take a lesson here.

"This stock operates under the radar screen, not known by many investors and very limited float of shares , 54M of 64M shares outstanding, of which The institution holds 98% and roughly 5-6% by insiders, So easy to manipulate the stock price!"
What a ponzi…
MongoDB gives a buy signal for the following reasons:Fundamentally Speaking1. The firm has a good cash flow and does not need any financing. The recent private placement appears to be used more for another acquisition. The firm probably plans to maintain its healthy growth. 2. The sector has witnessed a positive trend. This can be shown on other similar firms.Technically Speaking1. The share price is trading about its 50 and 200 days moving average. 2. The trading volume is lower than average. It seems most investors are expecting some bullish trend.
"9 weeks ago, I said this would be back to $400 by end of August. And now $500 is in sight. Holding. Never selling. gltal's"

What investment better than this. It will become your business, you’ll be part owner of this great company."
550 this week....
The rotation out of cloud and into value stocks caused the drop this was a result of investor sentiment which in turn was driven by the two and ten year yield gap narrowing. This war further compounded by the bad PMI on Tuesday and the even worse ADP reading yesterday. Cloud stocks lost favor because in perceived hard times investors value safety and cloud stocks do not provide that. This is the narrative Wall Street wants us to believe so that retail investors sell positions whilst they quietly re buy in small tranches. We have NFP coming out tomorrow and a 76% probability of a further rate cut and the all important trade meeting on 10th October. These are the key determinants.
"I’ve been in this stock for over 18 months – my expectations for results on 9/4:Expected revenues of $91m. I’m looking for at least a 10% beat at over $100m. Under $97m is a disappointment (7% beat). $97-$105 is strong (8-15% beat). Over $105 is stellar. I recall Bourne had them crossing $300m TTM which is about $103m. Revenue growth continues to be the biggest indicator of long-term viability. Hitting $100m for Q puts them over 80% growth rate compared to same Q last year – pretty darn strong. Q to Q growth rates will not be this strong going into Q3&Q4.Next most important – earnings (or lack of). They are guiding $-.28 for Q2 and was at $-.22 Q1. I think they should at least meet or beat. I am probably overly optimistic on their march towards profitability (which I think they can meet sometime in 2020 – I’m far more aggressive than others on this). They’ve met or beat EPS guidance every qtr since going public – we’ll see if they continue the trend. Last quarter they adjusted FY EPS downward $.05 to $-1.04-$-1.11 which was concerning overall. I am hoping they can hit $-.25 or better. Missing $-.28 will definitely be a disappointment even with the ASC accounting changes, Realm, and seasonality of Q2.Lastly, cash flow. They’ve done a nice job managing this but moved from $523m cash on hand to $477m but they were free cash flow positive Q1 for the first time ever at $3.2m. Don’t expect that again with the Realm acquisition at $39m which will hit this Q and be a significant drag on overall cash. I’m expecting anything above $433 cash on hand at end Q2 as being positive given that Q2 is seasonably their most challenging with cash and the Realm acquisition. If MDB hits these 3 target numbers the story remains strong and the stock will continue it’s move upward over time. I’m a long term guy so have no idea on immediate price action but feel a 180-200 price target by the end of the year is fair (excluding extreme mkt volatility).One last thing – I think this board has been pretty good overall and appreciate the mostly informative dialogue – one of the better boards I’ve been part of. Thanks to all!"
"My thoughts the partnership with Ali baba requires a lot of capital spend as they need to capture market share. MDB have cash for day to day trading this sum of money is for strategic expansion. Think about it, MDB is valued around $8bn and they are borrowing close to $1bn this is not to care of some bills this is to fund aggressive expansion. Convertible notes are the preferred method as it is cheaper than vanilla loan offerings."
"Fidelity just loaded up, adding over 3 million shares and increasing their holding by 69%. https://fintel.io/so/us/mdb"
"Is this the next Oracle? I think it might turn into a $100B market cap company in a decade from now, if not sooner."
margin calls start Tuesday. You SURE you wanna short this monster right now?
"Let's go through some basic investing rules... What forces prevent a shares price from going down. The first is opportunistic buyers who have seen a stock rally but have waited patiently for a big sell off, then you have the dip buyers, short covering, company buybacks, technical traders who use charts, swing traders who buy in when its oversold, and value investors. Value investors may not intervene in MongoDB as they prefer profitable companies with strong cash flows. But all the other buying forces will be present. The strength of some of these buying forces will be determined by the level of confidence in the general market. Where there is excess confidence it leads to greed and that is when values get overstated. At the moment the market is in pause mode until major earnings season kick off next month unless something concrete comes out of the China delegation trip this week. There could be a hint of an interim deal to be ratified in October if that is the case a lot of stocks should go green. The real question therefore is whether one can find a really good stock thats likely to rally higher and harder than MDB. Careful just because a stock has gone higher already it does not mean there is a lot more upside to go, it's about the fundamentals of the business. Hope this helps."
SCAM over $450
"this board is so quiet now... funny. Anyway, I don't see any downside to this earnings report from what was already known yesterday. Beat on Rev, beat on EPS, and generating FCF this qtr for a nice change. Will be interesting to listen into call this afternoon. Really good highlights overall and continued optimism."
Here's my best guess on the beat and raise to be announced tomorrow evening.BEAT - rev of $101MRAISE - guidance $387M to $393M
Not to often for me a share moves over $100 in a day. Been in this since May and bought in at $271 and then saw it immediately track down to $244. Nice to buy and hold and can't see me ever selling this one
"All gaps eventually get filled, and MDB will be no exception. This will head back to the $400 range in time."
"Beats on top and bottom lines. And as always, conservatively forecast for Q4 and 2021, so the beats will continue. Plenty of cash, minimal burn, and just waiting for the inflection point to come. It will come when you least expect it. In at IPO, and riding this to infinity and beyond. gltal's"
This stock is going to $200. Even after today’s increase still very cheap. One of the best placed stock in the market. MonogoDB is disrupting a total segment THE global cloud database service and Undisputed leader. As Big Data is becoming king this company has no ceiling how high we can go. You want to own this one. IMHO
