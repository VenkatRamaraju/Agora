"shorted another 400 shares at $490 today. Roll it down the hill, quick! lol"
the run to 600 is gonna be freaky fun. beware of shorting it at this point.
I can't understand why this stock is in the 500's with no earnings for many years. What am I missing ? Plus 43x sales on top of that.
I've used their product. Good product. But the stock price is highly distorted by cheap money. As rates rise this will fall back to where it is properly valued.
MongoDB reached an all time high at 523.60
Looks like $MDB heading towards pre-earning price $400
I sold all today. Done with tech as yields moving fast with October in play.
Break above 505 will allow run to 520-535. Break above that and expect a HUBS-type run. MDB will be trading in the 600s before you know it whether or not you can wrap your head around itâ€™s financials and corresponding price. This is the future.
"A Form 4 filing from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reports that on September 7, Dev Ittycheria bought 35,000 Mongodb shares at a price of $6.50 per share, for a total of $227,500. They then sold their shares on the same day in the open market at prices ranging from $489.51 to $514.65 to raise a total of $17,484,397 from the sale.https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/09/22885768/president-and-ceo-of-mongodb-trades-17-71-million-in-company-stock"
MDB is among the most overvalued stock==strong sellTarget $125
"just a word of advice to shorts from someone who has been in the stock for the last two years: EVERYONE is expecting the overall market to tank in the next few days or so. EVERYONE. During market tanks (and you can do your own research on this) Mongo DOES NOT selloff at first. In fact, it usually GOES UP. Don't know why. Then, a day or two into the harsh macro selloff, it finally relents and joins the pain party. So if you're waiting for the Big Selloff coming up to short it (if it even happens), give Mongo a day or two to join in. I don't care either way since I'm a LONG long, but thought I'd do you guys a favor. It snaps back up in a wicked way, so be nimble. Frankly, Life is easier if you just buy it and hold it for a couple years. Just sayin'."
I'm definitely selling MDB and buying back after earnings. Just look at all these cloud companies tanking. Okta / veev / ZM.
"LIKE I SAID, WORSE CASE MDB GOES DOWN TO FILL THE EARNINGS GAP. NO BIG DEAL LONG-TERM"
"What a gift, bought some shares at $483.50"

"The math says MDB is going to more than 10X the next five years! should be doing over 12 billion in revenues in 2026, and that is without making any acquisitions!!!"
"Sometimes this board will go days without anyone posting. Then you get a move like this week, and the board is closed with posts talking about easy short, no profits, overvalued, blah blah blah. Can only surmise lots of people lost alot of money being against MDB this week. Pretty funny. Things will settle back down. Just going to continue to hold, and trade around the edges. $1000+ in a couple years. gltal's"
"ya know, the last I heard MDB was the database platform ""Fortnite"" is running upon. Since Epic is the creator of Fortnite and the Unreal Engine that is considered a key player for the Metaverse (whatever that actually ends up being), Mongo COULD BE and so far I guess ALREADY IS the backbone of part of the Metaverse. Think about that..."
I just love how this share doesn't get all the hype just keeps on keeping on
"Great company. Great product. Great future. But come on, 43x sales?"
