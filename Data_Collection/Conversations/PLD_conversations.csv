This company is building the base for the last mile delivery systems for e-commerce. It is not just a REIT.
I love this stock
Not sure why this is so under the radar....
"hedge fund actions, 100,000 plus shares action...interesting activity...by the way stop erasing my posts whoever you are."
Does anyone have a clue why this stock has been so flat?So exciting when PLD almost reached $141.00 a few weeks back.
Great buying opportunity.
This is a must own stock for the long term.I bought some 15 years ago for inflation protection.It is doing well.Inflation is back.
"Recent upgrade with price target of $135, but share price held in check. Hmmm."
Goldman Sachs upgrade PT $166 -> $180
"We are adding to our position.Don Eastman, has a target price of $125"
I understand the case for buying REITs especially one that is positioned like Prologis and yet the just barely better then 2% dividend leaves me uncertain given alternatives like high quality Preferreds or even blue chip dividend ETFs. What’s the motivator here?
"Almost ready to bounce, lets see if it will go to 125 first"
"Nov 5, 2019 is PLD's investors forum talking about 2020 forecasts. You'll be smart to BUY as much stock as you can before that."
Best REIT in USA!
The best REIT in America.Stock could hit $150 per share by Christmas.
"Thank you when I typed in Project that’s what first came up but did not offer much information, but I researched a little further￼. Thought maybe it was a spinoff￼"
"as a full-time local truck driver of 15 years, I can assure all you longs that you have nothing to worry about holding this company. I've seen an acceleration in work since the pandemic, mostly domestic but also International. Prologis is covid proof and has no reason to be down. should be up over $122"
Own the stock through DRN which I have owned since May. Still think Reits are one of the few good values left in this market. This is one of the better growth Reits but long term I would hold RQI in this sector. Good company with good long term potential.
Shocked about the trading range. Easy argument for $120+ with e-commerce warehouse solutions being in such demand.
Time to buy. Dividend is well over 3 percent and you dont se that often
bouncing and running in same channel all year folks....moving to 92 easy ahead of print. Jan atm calls a buy

"I work in the CRE investments & development sector. I can tell you from the front line that industrial products became (for the first time ever) more desirable than any other asset type. Due to extreme demand (forecasted to last at least in the next 2-3 years), the rental upside is huge (20-30%) and indexed against inflation. Financing has never been cheaper and I assume PLD has take advantage of it, like other market players."
Every time a company buys another company the buyer drops 5% and the company being purchased goes up even more. I can't figure it out. See GIS and IBM as examples.
Jason Contino target price of PLD of $145per share.
Prologis reached an all time high at 144.90
"Peter Barnard, has PLD, as his topstock selection for 2021!"
What was the trigger for price drop today. Had been waiting to get in here under 95 and my alert went off. Got in under 94 but why the drop?
I went in big here a couple weeks ago and went 9x the position I had been holding for 5 years. Got in at $101. I’m looking at this long term (10+ years) with dividends reinvested and 2-3 times a year adding position. I was too heavy in Tech and did some research and decided on this stock as one of the 3 moves I made to diversify across sectors. Let’s hope for some good performance!
Going much higher. E-commerce on fire. PLD is critical to that ecosystem.
Why is the forward P/E higher?
"I was driving around North New Jersey this past weekend, And I drove down Valley brook Ave in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, I seen 2 giant warehouses right next two each other, I mean so big you could assemble Boeing airplanes inside them, they both had the Prologis logo on the front of the buildings, these buildings are strategically located about 10 miles from New York City and all its 5 borough's. Just to update you guys on my observation."
Prologis reached an all time high at 142.22
Significant earnings per morning conference call.
Sept 17th -- bizarre trading down -2% on decent volume right after GS upgrade to $166. Hmmmm.
Lower for longer. Everybody sheltering in prologis.
"SQ vs. PLD. Bought 500 shares each @ $81. Let's see where they are 3,6,9 and 12 months from now."
Weird day. Thought this was headed to $140 and now it's in reverse?
"Matthew Eastman, is adding to his position in PLD."
"Large E commerce building planned forCherry Hill New Jersey.Jim Dontino, my source."
