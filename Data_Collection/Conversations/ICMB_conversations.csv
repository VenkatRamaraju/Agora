If anyone looks at this site there has been nothing but buys from insiders since 3/20. I think that bodes well for the stock.
CMFN is down -4.99% to 8.10
CMFN reached a new All Time High at 8.65
INSIDER TRADE ALERT issued for ICMB!
"We like the payout that this stock offers via its dividend and have had it in our swing portfolio twice in 2020 (we have exited our holding as well making app 10-15% per swing in about a one month hold).The downside, is the low volume that this stock has, so exiting can be hard. We may be taking a small position again if the stock continues to trend lower (low 5s) depending on the broader market conditions."
Looks like it happened today:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investcorp-finalizes-majority-interest-acquisition-120000494.html
Lets see if the stock can breakout from the previous runup from the dividend. It seems to have found a range between 5.30-5.45 with the odd touch to 5.50 or just below. Ideally would love to see the SP test and break 5.80 again as markets shift.

I thought this was supposed to have an earning report on Sept. 13th? Did I miss something?
Super simple question...has their long term stock price plummeted essentially because they are paying out capital dividends making their dividend rate look really high (over 10%) when in reality it is investors getting their own money back...ie equity being distributed vs just profits?
I hear this company wants to go private? What would happen to my shares? Anyone?
"Recently took back my investment account from Stifel (WORST EVER FIRM). I have 1320 shares, bought at $15.60. When was it ever at that price? Learning to read charts, complete novice screwed in my IRA account. No dividend can make up the loss incurred."

Make no sense to issue stocks at below book value because the portfolio can be increased with more debt.
When's earnings date? Been 91 days since last and nothing found anywhere...
Over $9 in 2020 plus the dividend
