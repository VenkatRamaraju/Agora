Why the heck is this stock tanking? What will it take for it to go back up?
ICMB is making money and will have a great profit to report on 9/15...This is going to take a nice spike then...Buy it cheap now and remember me in your will...
If anyone looks at this site there has been nothing but buys from insiders since 3/20. I think that bodes well for the stock.

Lets see if the stock can breakout from the previous runup from the dividend. It seems to have found a range between 5.30-5.45 with the odd touch to 5.50 or just below. Ideally would love to see the SP test and break 5.80 again as markets shift.

"We like the payout that this stock offers via its dividend and have had it in our swing portfolio twice in 2020 (we have exited our holding as well making app 10-15% per swing in about a one month hold).The downside, is the low volume that this stock has, so exiting can be hard. We may be taking a small position again if the stock continues to trend lower (low 5s) depending on the broader market conditions."

Super simple question...has their long term stock price plummeted essentially because they are paying out capital dividends making their dividend rate look really high (over 10%) when in reality it is investors getting their own money back...ie equity being distributed vs just profits?
