"$9.68 to $40? Over last 52 weeks. Wow. See a little profit taking last few weeks and today. Like the stock, like the industry. Just a matter of timing jumping in. Options are interesting. A bit expensive."
Great earnings but it did not transfer over to stock price.
Conference call was too funny. CEO was panicky when pressed on questions and had to take it off line.

"Just listened to the conference call. No wonder the stock got pounded on Friday. Pathetic performance for the fourth quarter and with the management team on the call. Back out the LIFO and one time charges for the fourth quarter and it couldn't have been much worse. The competitors are blowing and going and we were left in their dust. I don't buy on the smoke and mirrors of buying market share and internal vs external growth. Finally someone on the call called BS and management requested an ""offline"" discussion. It is very simple. Management has been spending like a drunken sailor and failing to run the company. We just lost a great opportunity in the fourth quarter and after the call, I have zero confidence in our management team."

What the ef is going on with this boat anchor of a stock?
sgt says we will be happy
Price is back aligned at sub $20 where it should be.
The Market has a record day and this stock loses. Stock performance at Olympic is the strangest thing I’ve seen. Hope they can figure it out.
"Question - how will the pending ruling on Section 232 re steel imports have on ZEUS or steel service centers in general. I know tariffs help big steel, however what about the service centers?"

"Nucor is jacking up prices, so revenue should be jumping up at OS. They don't reduce margins so should see some rise finally after not doing much for so long."
Lagging behind others in similar industry yet no real change in fundamentals over the past few days. It's only a matter of time before it pops! I bought in the 20's and just added yesterday in the high 20's/low 30's.

"The 3rd quarter earnings were poor, but you would never know it by listening to the call/report from CEO. Big push that everything had turned around and things were improving and 4th quarter looking good. Not buying into any of that yet. Dumped stock at its peak today. Be wary!"

Great earnings report that failed to translate over to the stock price. Very surprising or maybe not. If it can’t go up on that kind of news then it doesn’t look too favorable in 3rd qtr.
