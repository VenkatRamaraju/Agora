Olympic Steel is up 11.52% to 11.33
Conference call was too funny. CEO was panicky when pressed on questions and had to take it off line.
ZEUS is up 5.49% to 21.99
ZEUS is up 5.76% to 23.52
Olympic Steel is up 10.26% to 28.15

The Market has a record day and this stock loses. Stock performance at Olympic is the strangest thing I’ve seen. Hope they can figure it out.
They are sitting on quite a bit of debt. 4th quarter not looking great for them. Maybe 1st.
Great earnings report that failed to translate over to the stock price. Very surprising or maybe not. If it can’t go up on that kind of news then it doesn’t look too favorable in 3rd qtr.
Great earnings but it did not transfer over to stock price.
Outperforming it's sector. That's reassuring. Steel not looking too good the last few days.
What a stock ! Go Zeus !
Another tariff delay on May 1
"$9.68 to $40? Over last 52 weeks. Wow. See a little profit taking last few weeks and today. Like the stock, like the industry. Just a matter of timing jumping in. Options are interesting. A bit expensive."
Olympic Steel is up 11.16% to 39.74
"Olympic Steel Inc. announced its decision to acquire the assets of Action Stainless & Alloys, Inc., a Texas-based leading steel distributor"
Very poor quarterly earning report this week yet stock barely moves. Strange results that defies logic.
ZEUS is up 5.74% to 23.23
"Timing was good, for a change. A surprisingly difficult market, since on the surface it's going up every day.Got one right!"
Lagging behind others in similar industry yet no real change in fundamentals over the past few days. It's only a matter of time before it pops! I bought in the 20's and just added yesterday in the high 20's/low 30's.
And it keeps tanking for no reason.
Whats happening is going down for third day in a row!!!
"Question - how will the pending ruling on Section 232 re steel imports have on ZEUS or steel service centers in general. I know tariffs help big steel, however what about the service centers?"
Price is back aligned at sub $20 where it should be.
"Nucor is jacking up prices, so revenue should be jumping up at OS. They don't reduce margins so should see some rise finally after not doing much for so long."
"Just listened to the conference call. No wonder the stock got pounded on Friday. Pathetic performance for the fourth quarter and with the management team on the call. Back out the LIFO and one time charges for the fourth quarter and it couldn't have been much worse. The competitors are blowing and going and we were left in their dust. I don't buy on the smoke and mirrors of buying market share and internal vs external growth. Finally someone on the call called BS and management requested an ""offline"" discussion. It is very simple. Management has been spending like a drunken sailor and failing to run the company. We just lost a great opportunity in the fourth quarter and after the call, I have zero confidence in our management team."
Not seeing any upside with this guy running the show.
Olympic Steel reached a 52 Week low at 7.95
Still over-priced by about $3.00
What's the deal with shares up 10%....?
Olympic Steel is up 10.72% to 9.29
What the ef is going on with this boat anchor of a stock?
Look for this to dip to $17-$18 by end of Aug. PE is not looking good. Looking forward to the as usual comical earnings call.
Olympic Steel is up 5.97% to 27.15
Any thoughts on how this stock is considered a good investment seeing its past 90 day history from $40 down to $25?
"The 3rd quarter earnings were poor, but you would never know it by listening to the call/report from CEO. Big push that everything had turned around and things were improving and 4th quarter looking good. Not buying into any of that yet. Dumped stock at its peak today. Be wary!"
It just caught my eyes and looks to be good growth company in business since 1954...but I missed the entire commodity run ...
"Opened at $21? Don't worry, it will return to it's usual $18-19."
CEO stated he was happy to answer all questions on last earnings report. That’s quite a change from the previous call where he needed to take it off line. Funny guy.
ZEUS is up 5.00% to 23.53
