Anyone know if any companies that control their supply chain?In times like these those are the companies that you want to invest in!
"Earnings run, infrastructure run, news driven run should push CLF to $23-$24 ahead if earnings day next week."
New Ted's prediction still stands for $2B FCF for the 3rd quarter. LC has $1.2B left after $775M Ferrous acquisition to pay down debt. 4th quarter is going to have higher FCF. Maybe $2.5B.

"Looking for a Double on Cleveland-CliffsShares of the steelmaker followed our September 'script.'By BRUCE KAMICH Oct 08, 2021 | 10:51 AM EDTStocks quotes in this article: CLFWe looked at the charts of steel-maker Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) on Sept. 9 and wrote that ""Traders should be prepared for a possible dip toward the rising 200-day moving average line. If this correction occurs you should treat it as a buying opportunity for longer-term gains to the $36 area.""The shares tested the rising 200-day line at the end of September and earlier this month so traders got the opportunity to buy CLF.Let's see how things are progressing.In the daily bar chart of CLF, below, we can see that the shares followed our September ""script"" and tested the rising 200-day moving average line. Traders got a buying opportunity at a good price and technical juncture. Prices are turning upwards again and we could soon see a test of the 50-day average line.The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has held steady since late June and I look forward to renewed strength. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator just crossed to the upside for a cover shorts buy signal. In the weekly Japanese candlestick chart of CLF, below, we can see a mixed picture. Prices are in a longer-term uptrend above the rising 40-week moving average line. The test of the 40-week moving average line looks successful. The OBV line may have made a low and the MACD oscillator is ready to narrow. In this daily Point and Figure chart of CLF, below, we can see it is now showing us an upside price target of $23. A month ago the target was bearish. In this weekly Point and Figure chart of CLF, below, we used a five-box price reversal filter. Here the software suggests a target for CLF in the $42 area. Bottom-line strategy: Traders who used the dip to the 200-day line to buy should hold those positions. Traders who did not buy could do so here risking a close below $18. The $42 area is our price target for late 2021/early 2022."
clf will see 23 today code 22.50 to 22.70
LG has been holding a royal flush with his cards on the table while the others playing against him are playing old maid. He’s made moves for 5 years down the line and it’s really unbelievable he had the cajones to try and pull it off during a pandemic . It was the ultimate all in playing a hand for 100s of billions of dollars because that’s what his pot will be worth in a few years . The movie that will be made just gets better and better. Making steel cheaper than the Chinese ……who’d have ever thought it possible.
"All I know is, as of today, HRC Futures average $1360/ton for the 1st half of 2022…not buying any “rollover” in Steel Pricing."
"At Q2/CC LG Koci stated that $455 million had been paid down on the debt wall in the first 20 days. This quarter/CC I expect an announcement of scrap yard being paid with CoH by end of October, or there abouts."
if we close above $21.76 today I see tomorrow a gap up ￼￼$22.83 that’s my crystal ball￼
"This time it is different. The world's countries are now limiting together carbon emissions, especially in steel manufacturing. Say hello to $40 imo."
"Did you all see the article dated today by ""The Street"" which claimed that clf and Nucor was up because of increased European energy costs among competitors in European steel market that could slow exports from Europe into the US. the article also stated...The move followed a warnings from Britain's industry lobby, U.K. Steel, which cautioned that ""with winter approaching, demand for gas and electricity will rise, and prices could get higher, which will make it impossible to profitably make steel,"" leading to shutdowns and price hikes in the domestic market"
Those suggesting to sell CLF before earnings...........Sure didn't work for Alcoa this time. Holders are being well rewarded.
"GS: """"Like the rest of the sector, Cleveland-Cliffs shares have underperformed the S&P500 in the last month ... we believe that this underperformance is unwarranted, given continued execution against deleveraging targets, strong free cash flow generation, and potential upside risk to 2022 average selling prices,"" Chieng wrote.""Stick to the plan, LG."
"Well there goes debt reduction out the window....until next q, but that is ok good cost reduction opportunity for the mills.....takes 15% of prime scrap out of market which should drive price of scrap up for other users"
"It looking like this won't end until January when the converts expire. 3 more months of this. Right now, it's just a free candy store, unless there is a dramatic increase in buy volume, not going through dark pools. Until then, expect the same. Citidel MM's are paid off by the funds that own the converts to rig the prices. A win/win for both. Lose/lose for us,"
"As a few of us have said, Capex will increase due to scrap acquisitions, but this is great news. Debt will be fine, so no need to worry about it. In other news, Gazprom is increasing export prices to Europe and MT is slapping surcharges on long tons. India has 3 days worth of coal on hand (typically maintains one month supply) and is anticipating energy rationing in the coming weeks. Bottom line: I believe cheap imports will not be a problem in the intermediate term."
Shorts are now doing end of day drip drip manipulation. Getting desperate boys. The spring is being wound tighter every day. Earnings will be epic !!!! Bring it you frogs !!!!
this will skyrocket when market picks up momentum
"Steel stocks are acting poorly. Not recovering from the 25-30% decline in X, CLF, and NUE. Somewhat surprising given inflation, other commodity stocks rising and still very high steel prices. Hoping earnings and guidance results in steel's catchup move. Still expect $25-30 this year, unless mid-2022 futures continue to fall."
LG is probably next heading over to visit all the local dog pounds. He's gonna need quite a few mean pooches to guard his new acquisitions.
"If it makes sense, I would expect that 3rd party sales of scrap is going to come to a halt. Expect that very soon."
The manipulation keeping CLF stock down is truly amazing but eventually reality will win out and then watch the price soar.
Just sold SCCO.........made $10.00 a share since last week........... Try that with CLF.......... How sad.
Still room to grow…according to statistics steel market has not deteriorated as the “pros” predicted…no matter what variable is considered…so…what does that mean?…it means that steel stocks are oversold…for example CLF is still trading ~17.5 per cent off the 52 week high
@Booleansearcher- how much weight do you give the 20 day moving average? Right now it looks pretty positive.
"Newbie here. Hold 7150 shares purchased 2150 in 2014, 2600 in 2019, and 2400 a month ago. Average cost about 16ish. Have been following this board for years. Have laughed and cried along the way. I have gained a lot of knowledge and insight from many here. Thanks to all. Long or short, doesn't matter. As for me, I'm here to see this through to fruition whatever that may be. I'm thinking at least a year or two. Good luck to all. Looking forward to being a part of the conversation sometime."
"With China on the sidelines for an extended period due to tariffs, export tax, pollution, Beijing Olympics air quality and shipping problems we can argue all day where the price of domestic steel is heading. Remember infrastructure will eventually become reality. But even bearish Emily at GS agrees CLF has the huge advantage in domestic profits as the lowest cost producer and best margins in the sector."
"From the Slides:• $775 million total enterprise value on a cash-free, debt-free basis• Paid in cashIs this LG double talk? Hopefully, they will explain."
US STEEL up over a point...
"LG has transformed Cliffs into the lowest cost/highest quality producer of steel in NA ……and now apparently he might be the lowest cost ,highest quality , cleanest steelmaker in the entire world. Buy it lights out until it doubles and then watch it double again and just maybe again after that ."
.....and we have $22.....do I hear $23.....$23.....the steel sector opportunity of the decade.....and the story continues to blossom like peonies in the spring!Cheerio
Emily Chieng of Goldman Sachs has a high opinion of CLF partially because she understands the importance of decarbonization in the future of the sector. CLF is the greenist steel company worldwide. US Steel hasn't gotten around addressing this problem and continues to dump poison into local waterways every week causing dead fish to wash up on the beaches of Lake Michigan. Look at what happened yesterday and last week.
What makes me very happy in this run up is that there is NO GAP UP. It bottomed at the previous days intraday high. Thank you Cliffy!
"10-14-21 8:30 PM ESTabd2792As you may remember from our prior conversations, I generally shy away from funds of any sort. The reason is that my objective is to beat the market consistently and after accounting for fund fees that becomes difficult if I hold a significant fund position. I do however still have one fund (JAMRX) which I continue to hold because it's done OK, I don't need the money and I hate paying capital gains.I'll do a “deeper dive” on PSLDX but my “shallow dive” tells me that their objective is also to beat the market (S&P) and to do it, at least partially, by investing in income paying investments.Well, I do the same thing and without doing a weighted average, my investments are paying me 9.3%, 12.7%, 6.2%, 10.8%, 10.6%, 8.1%, 6.2%, 8%, 10.8%, 6.8%, 4% and 3.35% (RDSB) calculated on my cost basis and not including a substantial cash position which I hold only because my daughter is undergoing a divorce and if required, I wanted toset aside cash to buy her a new home. I'm sure if I bothered to do a weighted average my overall yield would be in the 7 to 8% range.Yeah you may ask …. but how has your portfolio performed? Since COB 2015 …. and I use since 2015 because all the data is on my white board ….. my portfolio has significantly outperformed the DOW, S&P and I'm currently neck and neck with the NASDAQ. YTD as of COB 10-14, I'm up about 19% and without being too specific it's a multi-million dollar portfolio.I'm not a trader and in an unusual year I'll make maybe 10 trades and so far this year I've made one trade, I quit playing options decades ago.When I croak (I'm 78 years old) my daughter will be set for life …. but I am thinking about setting up a trust for her when the divorce proceeding is complete …. just to be ultra safe.Lastly, I currently hold no position in CLF (I bailed on CLF many months ago) but did establish a position in my daughters account (which I manage) in which CLF currently up 125.03%. I am considering a CLF investment, assuming I don't have to spend all of my portfolio cash on a new home.But I look at a CLF (or any) investment this way …. if I think that investment has a good chance of growing by 20% in the year after I purchase it and if the future after that looks bright then I may invest ….. and I really don't care if I pay $20 or $30 per share.I know …. too much information …. but if anyone wantes to know my holdings, I'd be willing to share the stock symbols.Good luck in your endeavors.Roger"
Farmer JIm Cliffs making money hand over fist!
"The problem is the analysts are lazy and way behind the curve. Also, with the universe of stocks so large most funds/investors focus on statistics such as low PE revenue growth etc. The TTM eps is currently at an 11.67X multiple very high for a cyclical this should change measurably after Q321 reporting. The next issue is the lack of understanding of 2022. The current EPS consensus of 9 analysts is an EPS of $3.66 ( which at a 6 multiple would yield fair value at $21.96. The problem is $3.66 would mean that HRC would average slightly under $950 for the WHOLE year. LG needs to get analysts onboard with realistic number for 2022. I am quite sure he won't give any guidance for 2022 this Q cc, so it will be a challenge to accomplish this. At $1175 HRC EBITDA would be $5 billion eps would be $5.768 (all this is conservative for 2022) with a reasonable multiple of 6-7x fair value would be $ 34.68 - $40.37. LG needs to sell it in the CC34.68"
"There are a few times in life where it's almost impossible to fail unless you mess it up and this is one of those times. $CLF is a vertically integrated business owning both supply and distribution which is a unicorn in itself. Pricing pressures and competition from China will not hurt this company as significant in other cases which is the reason why it has stayed afloat even during difficult times. $CLF fundamentally is a no brainer and unfortunately were in a options environment of shorting these companies as opportunities are stagnant or too pricey as an entry point like FAANG stocks. So I would be patient and standby until there's an earnings report. Trust and believe, $CLF will rise bc unlike Tesla where they go by over hyping and not delivering on their promise as it's a club, CLF has the fundamentals to beat its competitors. Its poised to hit $30 and above so be patient and use logic. Institutional Investors are playing a game of cat and mouse. Dont be the mouse. GL!!!"
"A LOT of good comments today.1) Have not read anything about FTP contracts for selling scrap.... Short term, long term, or do they even exist??I bet short term at best, which means come 2022 some customers may be already scrambling? 2) Also all scrap is NOT the same! If competitors switch supply sources, it WILL require furnace input adjustments driving up costs and hurting steel consistency."
"""The transaction includes all of the company's scrap yards, as well as steel service center Koil and auto salvage yard Parts Galore, both located in Detroit"""
"CLEVELAND--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE: CLF) announced today that its employees represented by the United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 3044 have ratified a three-year labor contract for its Rockport Works operation. The new contract is effective from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2024. The new contract will cover approximately 350 UAW-represented workers at Rockport.Lourenco Goncalves, Chairman, President and CEO, stated, “Our union workforce is at the core of not just what we do but American manufacturing as a whole, and we are pleased to continue our commitment to good-paying middle class jobs with a new labor agreement at Rockport. Our local team at Rockport is committed to the long-term health and success of our Company, our country, and our environment, and as such, we were able to get a deal done that is fair and equitable for both sides.” Mr. Goncalves added, “We embrace our Unions as partners and allow for participation in our success. Our partnership is a powerful one, and with this latest deal, we will maintain our competitive cost structure in flat-rolled steel relative to any of our peers.”"
LG just put a capital I in INTEGRATION
"Scrap will return many times the rate that paying down debt will. Yes debt reduction is great, but not if better returns can be earned elsewhere. Buy."
Give the sellers credit. An achievement of sorts to keep CLF nearly unchanged on a day when the DOW rises by 500 points.
"One would think this would impact and apply to cliffs.The heavy equipment maker was up 1.2% in premarket action after Cowen began coverage with an “outperform” rating, saying it sees the first “megacycle” for Caterpillar in 14 years."
$23.00 seems to be the critical price for option play next week
CLF price action every OPEX Friday has been consistent with systemic shorting to keep the stock down to allow expiration of the call options with minimal damage. This produces an excellent floor so the start of each new week we see recovery of the stock even when the market is down. This game is getting more and more dangerous for these shorters as the 2 quarters of all time record earnings for CLF are now closing in.

"Today's deal announcement means that from cradle to grave and then resurrected, CLF has ALL bases covered!Now, the question is, do we focus on another acquisition or do we pay down debt and start rolling in dividends?I don't think LG is done...the rates are low and there are still many opportunities. LG doesn't seem to be making bad decisions. MAGA!!!"
"I have been long clf for prob 9 mths.I've sold some covered calls along the way and done ok.I am far from an expert on options. My question is this max pain theory. If you look at o/i this week we'll never get above 25. It looks the same for oct 29 exp, I realize that longer out and can change. The macd has crossed but the rsi looks iffy. Anyone want to weigh in on the max pain theory,just curious."
It is amazing to see SP of X almost same as CLF and now CLF is lagging by a dollar for $22 stock knowing CLF current and going forward profitability.
More China curbs to steel equals music to our ears. Buy.

"Controlling all the inputs, pellets, HBI and now scrap, CLF is positioned well to be the lowest cost producer of steel in the Great Lakes area."
"In LG we trust. All LG's moves are to make CLF stock worth more. Why ? His interest in aligned with ours, He owns a ""TON"" of CLF stock. The 3rdQ report next week and guidance will once again beat expectations. Get ready for another leg up in CLF."
"CLEVELANDCleveland-Cliffs Inc.

"10-11-21 10:30 AM ESTAs I post the MSB share price is $36.26, at COB 10-8 it was $34.26 and as of COB 9-30 it was $29.71.This represents a 5.83% increase so far today and a 22..05% increase since 9-30 ….. ask yourself WHY?The SP increase on 10-8 and today may have something to do with the $1.42 quarterly distribution MSB declared on 10-8 ….. BUT ….. IMO there may still be something more involved …. anyone care to guess what that might be?If this rise continues it will confirm to me that there may be a LEAK.I'm not complaining .... just wondering.Roger"
"I wonder if I am the only one bothered about today’s investment advice write up that came out on Cliffs, referencing some TA while broad brush touching on Cliffs highlights? In case you missed it, the authors recommendation was to exit the stock if it tries to revisit its highs after October 22 news, taking out covered calls that exercise near the peak while also taking out some puts to cover low side risk if the pps collapses. The write up was more sugar coated than that, but certainly looked like it was the power child for those underwriting Cliffs call options. There was no reference to recent analyst target upgrades, significance of Cliffs EBITDA trends or other matters much discussed on this board."
Just as I told you - Wednesday would begin earnings seasons in earnest and this could prove the trigger to a stronger market. THE CLIFF is a sleeper. It will awaken. It will awaken with a vengeance. Volume will spike. Price will spike. Interest in owing it will spike. It will have longevity. It will move from unknown to OWN!!! I look at management and we are well positioned there. I look MACRO and that looks extremely good. You kids can micro analyze it - that ain't my gig...I go MACRO BRO. But -Debt Reduction - Stock Buybacks - Dividend - Outstanding CC coming - Extremely positive FORWARD STATEMENTS. I like where we are - surprised we remain this low but it only means the sharp rise is moved forward closer to the earnings release. I can wait. Boolean
Good god the 5 day chart is about the most frustrating sawtooth I've seen in a long time - especially amid the favorable CLF news and generally up market days. Here's to a better week next week. Good weekend all.
"Market movers like Citadel are following a consistent pattern. They take the other side of the trade for investors' buying call options. Citadel collects the option premium; then, they move the stock price just below an option exercise price on Friday. In this case, just under $21.50 and cause the $21.50 and above options to expire worthless while Citadel pockets the option premiums."

10-15-21 9:45 AM ESTVERTICAL INTEGRATION.Who was the King of vertical integration??? ….. Henry Ford.Over the decades what's happened to Ford's vertical integration?Vertical integration can be a good thing if you can afford it when times get tough.You can afford it if your debt is low and you have the cash or free cash flow to cover your overhead.CLF's first priority MUST BE to get to net debt zero and until then forget about buy-backs and dividends.Pretty simple.Roger
Hrc prices look good for October at 1917. November is trending but December has some room for getting over 1700. Steel utilization was at 84.8 percent last week so its still around that needed 85 percent range. Production dropped though almost half a percent. There have been some rising imports over last years number so something to watch but shouldnt be a problem as in the past. Infrastructure will light the fuse. Will be very curious to see Clf inventory level next quarter and how LG anticipates to play that year end. Dare say like most watching the infrastructure bill. Foxconn probably deciding to build multiple cars in Ohio would be an interesting conversation in the near future because product is going to start next year. https://www.steel.org/industry-data/
"There have been a few write-ups regarding predictions of shortages in certain commodities going into 2022 that I am trying to sort out. These go beyond the shipping bottlenecks in recent news, warning about depletion or exhaustion of inventories of manufactured goods. A Cliffs relevant item appears to be how energy curtailments in China and parts of Europe are constraining production that is already behind in catching up with post pandemic recovery demand. I am seeing reports that China is curtailing its manufacturing including steel production that is linked to underlying energy shortages/quotas for electricity and coal. Why is electricity and coal use being rationed in China and how much is that a factor in the long term outlook for US steel pricing in 2022? I am well aware of the green politics but curtailments are said to be 30% or more in one season which is indicative of other drivers than green objectives. Thoughts?"
"CLF will put on another good show for us, then Peter Out in the middle of the day.."
"I own 13,153 shares of CLF and 13,152 shares of X….I haven’t figured it out yet but i suspect those make up 80 per cent or so of the total portfolio…so if someone thinks that perhaps i do not possess the proper amount of bullishness…than I suggest to you that you may want to re-evaluate that train of thought….not saying i could be wrong because believe me i have been wrong before…and i have been right sometimes…i served 26 years in military…i am not a hero but i know and worked with several…i just think that the more that the US can cut ties with China economically (by whatever peaceful means here and there)…the better…so you know what i think about that…i don’t like to be considered a radical…but many Americans (I don’t know the percent)…they kind of agree with that position…they are not being following or leading…that is just how they think…so my suggestion to politicians (and hopefully they are sticking to their oath of office) is to move as much as possible to disengage from Chinese influence"
"I think I read that FPT sources +/-3M LT of scrap (1.5M LT of prime) annually...?? For $775M that shakes out to $258.33/ton (for 1 year mind you) to gain controlling ownership of that supply going forward...Seriously, how was this deal available?? Was this the AK Steel of scrap? If LG turns it beneficial (which it should already be) then this is nearly as masterful as the MT acquisition."
Filed another complaint with the SEC on their website today. I know it's fruitless but it felt good. Until next time...
"Since coal and Natural Gas are so expensive in China, I would think steel makers would be shutting down over there."
Between now and EOD will tell how much $$ they are willing to risk in keeping PPS sub $22.
"As I said earlier this week (before DejaVu used his 10 alias' to get it censored away), the current market is not factoring in the reduction in steel production for China. With power allocations and smog reductions lasting through much of 1Q22, worldwide steel prices will probably rise (simple supply vs demand). Availability of imports to the US will remain constrained. US steel prices will remain inflated.LG can get the debt issue resolved early."
Mount Cliffy is about to erupt!!! fortunately she erupts green paper.... and I am in the path of her flow!!!lol
Middletown Works decision part of several recent moves by Cleveland-Cliffs: What we know
"even though HRC may have come down slightly, busheling scrap hasn't budged in a month."
"FROM LONDON: Cleveland Cliffs has a triple WIN at the 2021,Ninth Annual S&P Global Platts Global Metals Awards. They took: Metals Company of the Year; Deal of the Year; and CEO/Chairperson of the Year. Judges called the leadership of Lourenco Goncalves ""NOTHING SHORT OF REMARKABLE"". SO tell me kids...are we right OR WHAT!! Stay long and strong as Mr. Market will correct this immense imbalance of valuation. BE THERE. Boolean"
"So I recently bought a little of CLF. I do like the forward thinking ""LG"" a lot and the whole vertical integration he has been undertaking. But I have one question for you all: What happens to the CLF and the steel industry when the price of Steel drops from it current (in my opinion) unsustainable pricing, by say 40%? I'm not saying its going to happen tomorrow, but I'm pretty sure it is going to happen.That's what worries me the most..."
"When Iron Ore pricing is down, it does not affect CLF anymore the way it used to, HOWEVER, when it rises like it has in the last month, it does affect CLF in a BIG WAY!! Other steel producers need to buy at a higher price point where as CLF provides most of their own. Can you say MARGINS?!?!! Such a huge competitive advantage and a main reason why CLF is here to stay!! BUY BUY AND BYE BYE MICHAEL AND CLARISSA"
What a big volume in pre market!!!Very good I hope
"In addition to the Iron Ore surge, the HRC Steel Futures Continuous Contract is up today to $1,906……a splendid start for the trading week, indeed!Disclosures: I am a bidder, owner and long-term investor in CLF.Cheerio!"
Oh great ....... The SSA will raise our monthly checks by 6.1% approximately ........ and the price of gas increased by 65%........ and don't forget the price of food...... The Gov should give seniors a free Tesla and food stamps.
"I have been looking over the Cliffs Q and annual reports to fill in some context around what we might learn when CLF does their 3Q earnings on October 22. Perhaps, regular posters are well aware of such things, but I looked at 2020 financials etc. and noticed three items that are interesting to me. First is that Cliffs 2020 revenue from their HRC sales divided by tons sold is $610 per ton. Of course, HRC is a subset of steel sales and finished steel products carry a higher sale price—details are in the annual report. The Cliffs overall average steel sales price was over $1000 per ton in 2020 (e.g. $1041 in Q2 2020). So how does that $610 per ton HRC in 2020 compare to the record setting HRC pricing for 2021 that was $1149 in January and is currently over $1900 per ton HRC? The October 22 call ought to clarify much for Q3, but Cliffs reported an average steel sales price for Q2 2021 of $1118. The Midwest market HRC prices in recent months are: January $1149, Feb $1264, March $1348, April $1505, May $1665, June $1810, July $1789, August $1945, September $1900. Second, Cliffs 2020 steel sales were about 4 million tons reflecting the phasing in of the AKS (March) and MT USA (December) acquisitions. In 2020, Cliffs also still sold 11,707,000 tons of pellets to outside customers at an average price of $114 per ton. They also started up the HBI facility that can produce 1.9 million tons per year for self supply. For 2021, almost all their iron pellet production and HBI is going to Cliffs steel making of about 17 million tons in 2021. So in 2021, Cliffs is posting EBITDA in its first year as a vertically integrated steel company with profit margins reflecting the current record setting steel market pricing. The whole of 2021 has had HRC pricing above the Cliffs average steel (all types) sales price for 2020. Cliffs guided Q3 back in July for $1.8 billion EBITDA and $1.4 billion FCF. The same was guided for Q4. Cliffs posted their October 4 Shareholder presentation slides on their website. I noticed a section where Cliffs explains how they have three steel product segments that can supply items proposed in the infrastructure bill. Cliffs goes on to describe how many $ billions are in the bill for each sales segment (to potentially be served by Cliffs or their US competitors). That is worth a look for those who have interest in how much the bill might benefit Cliffs."
"The obvious from the CLF purchase of Ferrous Processing and Trading: CLF acquires 15% of the prime ferrous scrap market in the USA.Is there a less obvious gain? LG of CLF, King of Steel, said that this acquisition means ""cutting the middlemen and improving the margin contribution from scrap for both Cleveland-Cliffs and for the manufacturing and service center clients that will be able to sell scrap directly back to us."" Does that mean that the no-middleman-margin enables CLF to compete, paying a premium, for additional scrap purchases from clients served by other buyers? Does this cost advantage of the no-middleman platform enable CLF to expand their share and control of the scrap market without the purchase of additional scrap-buying businesses? I am grateful for expert commenters here who work in this field who know the answer."
21.50 is the number that the manipulators want this week. See you all next Monday and earnings next Friday. Cheers.
Well we’ll. LG just gave all the Wall Street dogs the middle finger. Yea just an ionOre company. Talk about controlling your own destiny as well as keeping the finger on the pricing scale. LG will drive this stock over 100.00 a share within a year. What a nice surprise this morning.
It does not matter how slow the rise. As long as it is a rise. Rise and Shine CLF.
"Recycling Today Summer 2021 Scrap SupplementA growing hungerFeatures - Steel Capacity AdditionsNew steel capacity in the U.S. will boost scrap and metallics markets.June 30, 2021Zulma HerreraPhoto courtesy of Big River SteelSteel mills in the U.S. are slated to bring roughly 7.5 million net tons of capacity for hot-rolled, slab and plate steel online during the next 24 months. Some recently commissioned plants also have begun to ramp up capacity this year.Demand for scrap and metallics is expected to grow with steel production. For example, adding nearly 10 million net tons of flat-rolled steel capacity likely will grow demand for prime scrap and scrap alternatives by more than 7 million net tons, says Phil Gibbs, an equity research analyst who focuses on the steel sector at KeyBanc Capital Markets, Cleveland.A two-pronged issueThe expanded capacity can be viewed in two ways for minimills, Gibbs says. On the one hand, it will place downward pressure on finished steel pricing, which is at historical highs as of the second quarter of this year. It also will add a procurement challenge. On the other hand, the rise in demand for prime scrap will lift scrap prices in a tight supply environment. As finished steel prices decline, narrowing the profit margin for these steel producers, scrap prices are projected to adjust slightly downward. However, demand will buoy prices and limit pricing declines for all grades of ferrous scrap, especially prime material.Scrap is anticipated to move extensively across regions to meet this growing demand, with most steel mills and many scrap yards established along water access points for barge and ship deliveries as well as along rail lines. Market participants note higher springboard shipments at premium prices for obsolete grades, which support regional scrap yard prices. For example, Big River Steel buys that drew from supplies in the Southeast and Midwest supported scrap prices over recent months.Boost for scrap pricesUnlike additional bar mill capacity, which faces no shortage of obsolete scrap, sheet mill chemical compositions require higher quality raw materials. The electric arc furnace (EAF) mix for sheet consists of 60 percent prime scrap grades, 20 percent pig iron and 20 percent obsolete grades. Thus, demand for prime grades will increase prices for that material given the rise of EAFs in the country. At a minimum, with no incremental direct-reduced iron (DRI), hot briquetted iron (HBI) and pig iron sources domestically, minimills will further disaggregate from local sources and actively increase imports of prime scrap and metallics.Prime scrap has limited sources domestically, and as the European Union increases its environmental shifts and EAF installations, prime scrap exports from that region could become limited in the near term.In the U.S., Gibbs indicates, mills consume about 20 million metric tons, or 22 million short tons, of low-residual metallics, with approximately 40 percent, or 8.8 million tons, being imported. Mills import nearly 10 percent, or 2.2 million short tons, of prime scrap grades annually. The additional sheet capacity is slated to increase these import volumes.In 2020, the U.S. imported 3.6 million metric tons (3.97 million short tons) of ferrous scrap, according to U.S. Census data. By category, No. 1 bundles were 30 percent of total imports, followed by 20 percent consisting of other high-grade ferrous scrap and 17 percent shredded steel scrap. The fourth-highest import was shavings and stampings, which is considered a clean grade, at 8 percent.Comparatively, in the first two months of 2021, the U.S. imported 720,318 metric tons (794,000 short tons) of ferrous scrap, up 75 percent compared with the 412,374 metric tons (454,600 short tons) imported in the same two months of 2020. The largest source was Canada, which supplied 77 percent of imports in the first two months in 2021, followed by the U.K. and the EU.In 2020, Canada’s imports tallied 2.6 million metric tons (2.87 million short tons), or 72 percent of total ferrous imports, with the most significant imports being No. 1 bundles, other higher grade ferrous scrap and shredded steel scrap.To date, Mexico has been a limited source of ferrous scrap imports into the U.S. In 2020, imports from that country were estimated at 241,898 metric tons (267,000 short tons), or 7 percent, but 43 percent of those imports were categorized as shavings.With Steel Dynamics Inc.’s (SDI’s) OmniSource division finishing the acquisition of the Mexican scrap processor Zimmer S.A. de CV in early August 2020, that unit will support SDI’s raw material procurement for the company’s Sinton, Texas, steel mill. The former Zimmer’s six scrap operations and three third-party processing locations are located strategically near high-volume industrial scrap sources in Mexico. The former Zimmer locations have about 2 million gross tons of processing capacity and were shipping about 500,0"
LG building a fortress in steel. He's been prescient on the need to clean up steel manufacturing thus improving global air quality. Scrap and HBI are the answers. Bravo to the captain. Buy.
"Agree or disagree. Prefer it or Not.LG was very clear. Koci was very clear. The IR department has been very clear.LG-“debt reduction is my 100% goal. Net debt free in 2022”You can share why you want it or even prefer it. But, LG said what he said. He announced a buyback 3 months ago and then executed it on a convertible so as to not fluctuate the SP as well as it was opportunistic due to it wasn’t being traded. Snuck in like a thief and robbed em of their shares. There is no opportunity like that for 3 months. Maybe LG buys a handful of shares here and there, but I’m going to take him at his word for now. Does he want to be net debt free? If Steel is $1000, how long to pay down $3 billion in debt? LG can’t control Steel pricing, he can only nudge it here and there. Right now is a Generational, even Historical, gift. It’s not coming back for a long long long time. It’s basically buying 2 Steel companies for 18 months of hard work. $5 billion is too much debt for a Steel company. It could cripple them. Prudence demands reduction of debt immediately. Steel futures have already started to roll over."

"From EE Times:Car Makers Reap What’s Sown During Chip ShortageDespite optimistic predictions that auto makers have seen the worst of ongoing semiconductor shortages, sources closer to the technology supply chain maintain things will get worse before they get any better.Industry consultant Semiconductor Intelligence downplayed auto industry assertions about the second quarter representing the “trough” of IC supply chain disruptions. Citing a growing list of auto production cutbacks stemming from the chip shortage, the market tracker countered in recent weeks that “the shortage of semiconductors for automotive applications is getting worse.”It cited production cuts at Ford, GM, Hyundai, Toyota, the merged Fiat-Chrysler-Peugeot group called Stellantis and Volkswagen.The only bit of good news was a recent forecast by Daimler AG that it expects semiconductor supplies to improve during the fourth quarter. Still, ongoing shortages will slow production next year, with a recovery not expected until 2023.Automakers are “primarily to blame for their semiconductor shortages since they drastically cut production and semiconductor orders while other semiconductor applications were either relatively stable or growing,” Semiconductor Intelligence declared in a late September research note.“Another contributing factor was automakers use of Just-In-Time inventory management systems… designed to reduce automakers’ parts inventories by working with suppliers to furnish parts just as they are needed for production,” it added.Complicating matters further, car makers require large volumes over extended periods as they ramp new models loaded with electronics. Now, many find themselves competing with smartphone and PC manufacturers for a limited supply of chips. Pandemic-slowed IC production in Asia along with other supply chain bottlenecks have exacerbated the shortage of devices like microcontrollers, forcing car makers to cut production for the foreseeable future.Tesla, which has attempted to ride out the chip shortage via redesigned MCUs and alternative suppliers, acknowledged it is also struggling to reduce EV costs amid the chip shortage."
"AA beat , announced a share repurchase and started a small Dividend and the stock hit a 12 month high near $55. CLF with report HIGHER EARNINGS THAN AA in the Q, both cyclical stocks and yet CLF under $22.A BEAT and raise of guidance should give us a POP !!!"
"The genius of LG is understanding that if you can control scrap availability, you control the costs in an EAF. Where X announced more capacity to make steel. LG just controlled some of their access to scrap. X will have high input costs and steel margins for BOFs will increase. The man is way ahead of his slow moving competitors."
"Everyone complains about the weekly manipulation of CLF…and rightfully so…BUT…I have contended for the 3+ years I’ve owned CLF that until the 1/15/22 convertibles are gone the holders (and their buddies) have a virtual risk free ability to short CLF. Just look at all the -20% pullbacks like clockwork that then get covered for the next run up…and then repeat. Its there in black and white on the chart. Occasionally there is a quick move up based on an undeniable event, but the -20% pullback short/long game just continues at a higher priceThe holdovers control 38M shares and can short with no risk unless the price is < $8.17. Only takes a wink to 1-2 other $$ manager buddies to go along with the game for a mid size stock like CLF to be controlled. UNTIL big new institutional $$ comes in to dwarf them or another extraneous M&A type event makes CLF much larger. CLF is the perfect “Goldilocks zone”…big enough volume that the long/short game is lucrative but small enough that a handful of managers can have significant influence on daily pricing.The converts were done pre-Koci and I’m guessing a factor in why he went away. LG then brought in his smart, trusty sidekick. So…we live with the short/long game until other big $$ makes it less lucrative or when the converts are redeemed in January (hopefully 1/15/22).I trade around it with a very large core position so I don’t miss the day it finally does take off and the game ends.Until…then…the game is not going to change."
Closing at 22.10. Then by weekend 23.50. Then off to 30.00. Then we are in the 40’s. I will hold all my shares for 3 more years. Cash in over 100.00 a share.
"Did some more digging and nucor, and x also take about 2 weeks to reach the high after earnings reports. based on this information we may not get the high we expect right away when cliffs reports earnings.. based on observation of past earnings dates and the time that it takes to reach the next high after."
Let’s not forget the importance of Keith Koci in all of this. He was LG’s sidekick prior to CLF and LG axed the former CFO. When LG re-assigned Koci to analyze scrap you knew a deal was likely. I’ve been through various M&A deals…CLF has the right team in place. Down the road (how soon I don’t know) CLF will likely be an M&A candidate for LG’s exit. Probably after he’s exhausted all the synergistic opportunities the market offers.This deal is brilliant for many reasons…not the least of which is now leveraging scrap from customers.
"In addition to the Ferrous Processing and Trading Company Deal, Bloomberg reported futures in Singapore surged 10% to $137.25/metric ton and prices in Dalian rose 4.8%! Both register significant developments for CLF , if I do say!Shorts best abort....Cheerio!"

If true, our ‘22 FCF is going to totally change the Balance Sheet and resulting Credit Ratings of this Company….not to mention our long awaited Shareholder Value. Keep the Faith!"
"Welcome back to the Race to $30Last week US Steel got into an altercation with Goldman and now CLF pulls ahead.If the S&P takes another jump off of the trading channel top, CLF has a chance to make it to $30 before the end of the year. Stay tuned."
Latest press releases from Cliffs is out! Our Company is being recognized for the monster it is. Little nugget LG gave to everyone...$21 billion company in 2021... that's jaw dropping!
"Does anyone know how many EAF's there are in the US? This acquisition is 15% of the national scrap market, and they have direct ties to the OEM's and auto stamping facilities. I wonder what % is prime scrap. I also wonder what % or their business was tied to NUE or STLD. With 4 EAF's, will we use all of this scrap internally, or will this be a catalyst to control a larger part of the scrap market?"
"10-8-21 6:30 PM ESTNot that anyone on this board cares ….. I'll share the following:Item 2.02Results of Operations and Financial Condition.Distribution AnnouncementOn October 8, 2021, Mesabi Trust issued a press release announcing that the Trustees of Mesabi Trust declared a distribution of One Dollar and Forty-Two Cents ($1.42) per Unit of Beneficial Interest payable on November 20, 2021 to Mesabi Trust Unitholders of record at the close of business on October 30, 2021. A copy of the press release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.Item 7.01Regulation FD.AAA Arbitration Final AwardAs previously reported, on December 9, 2019, Mesabi Trust initiated arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) against Northshore Mining Company (“Northshore”), the lessee/operator of the leased lands, and its parent, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (“Cliffs”). The Trust asserted claims concerning the calculation of royalties related to the production, shipment and sale of iron ore, including DR-grade pellets.The arbitration was completed before a panel of three arbitrators in July 2021 under the commercial rules of the AAA. The Trust received the final award on October 1, 2021, which awarded the Trust damages in the amount of $2,312,106 for underpaid royalties on DR grade pellets in 2019 and 2020 and interest in the amount of $430,710, calculated through June 30, 2021, and continuing to accrue until paid. Pursuant to the award, Cliffs must pay the damages award to the Trust no later than October 30, 2021. The Tribunal granted the Trust’s request for a declaration that “for purposes of calculating royalties on intercompany sales, Northshore shall reference all third-party pellet sales, regardless of grade, and select the highest price arm’s length pellet sale from the preceding four quarters.” The Tribunal denied the Trust’s request for declaratory relief regarding access to information. A copy of the press release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-K.#1. It looks like the estimate of MSB's distribution I provided you was pretty close …. only $.02 off. At MSB's current share price of $34.26 a $1.42 distribution represents a paltry 4.14% return ….. FOR THE QUARTER.#2. As I suspected the recent 15% rise in MSB share price was attributable to more than just the distribution …... arbitration was also settled IN FAVOR OF MSB which currently amounts to about another $.21 per share payable to MSB share holders probably in the 1st quarter on 2022.#3. There's going to be a lot of calculating going on but in the end MSB will be paid the highest price for any pellets in the prior 4 quarters and apply that price to all DR pellet production and shipments which, if my numbers are correct, may involve more than 2.6 M LT. If I interpret this correctly this price will also apply to all future DR shipments and may be adjusted (but only upwards) in the near to mid-term future.#4. I won't tell you I TOLD YOU SO regarding a new “deal” between CLF and MSB …. YET"
Option players driving for 21.50
Maybe already answered here on the board. Does “cash free” “debt free” in turn mean issuance of equity?
"October HRC steel is sitting at $1900 while all the future months continue to soar higher. Today is the day most annual contracts lock in for the upcoming year. Last year HRC at $800 was considered nice, but the present day $1900 is much better. With China on the fritz on multiple fronts, WELCOME TO THE NEW NORMAL."
"Scrap metal deal, good or bad for CLF?"
"Big HRC slide in 2022 months. This is not unexpected, and we can't expect the algos/analysts to know what these will do to CLF earnings in '22 because they still don't understand CLF's business... I mean why should they have to WORK to understand CLF's business? That's so old economy."
good to see us push through that intra-day high of Monday. The algos haven't completely regained control to drop it...
"Pumper, thanks for sharing that U-toobe video. Hopefully a few others (newbies) got the link before it was taken down. That is the video/presentation that got me into Cliffs. 5 years later after that presentation there has been almost ZERO deviation from the plan by LG, except for the whole Minnesota being a P.I.T.A. regarding Nashwauk.He embodies the ultimate CEO. Forward thinking always."
"I'm very glad that LG hasn't pre announced so far. If you look at X they've ""beaten"" estimates for 5 straight quarters, yet we've ""missed"" for 3 straight... They're topline growth has declined but ours has grown. The analyst accounting and miss/beat shenanigans are exhausting. Maybe someday we'll surprise to the upside so greatly that they'll be wiped out (short algos) but I doubt it, the game is too rigged and too fake for the enforcers to even begin to unravel it (if they even cared..?). Just gotta stay steady as our Mkt Cap continues to rapidly outpace all others in the domestic steel space."
"The nonsense will be rectified on October 22nd. Steel not ore company, cash flow. EBITDA, debt reduction, Ferrous and updated outlook for 4th quarter. The largest blast furnace in the western hemisphere comes online tomorrow after its reline and upgrades to burn a massive amount ofHBI. This means an extra 1,000 tons of steel per day. Toledo will only supply CLF."
"Unfortunately, LG cannot run his company like the Democrats and the Federal government do, by giving away the store with money that is not theirs for those shovel ready jobs that never happen. They don't have to worry about profits or stockholders. LG thinks 3-5 years in advance to make sure his company is still in business then, and if it means spending on something now to insure it's future, rather than giving all back on divvy's and stock buybacks, he is taking care of his investors for the long hall. This will not be an overnight killing, but an assured long term profit. Patience. He knows what he is doing. It's just unfortunate that manipulation slows the process."
"I like that Barron's is describing CLF as a ""Steel Giant."""
"How many have read GS analysis in all honesty? WS paid noises on this board have not read it indeed, and they are commenting here as per the agenda set by their lords. It is ironic and a shame that GS analyst gave a good rating (buy) exclusively for CLF; and bad ratings (sell and neutral) for X and NUE, but CLF price instead of skyrocketing, is losing its value again. In other words, CLF is the only recommended stock within the analysis; but look at the market reaction and most of the comments here? As a reminder; around two weeks ago, the CEO of CLF in an interview announced an estimated $20 billion earnings and very good sales contracts, yet CLF lost additional 4 % loss immediately. AfteR these two extremely positive news, CLF should have been around $ 30, but it’s value is moving downward. If this is not a manipulated stock, you name what it is? What is the solution? I really don’t know."
FYI on my schwab account today Credit Suisse has a outperform with a $34 price target and there blue sky scenario where everything goes perfect 45 to 50
"So where does the Cliffs cash come from to do the cash conversion of MT’s preferred shares in Q3 and the FPT scrap acquisition in Q4 2021? Yesterday, I noted how Cliffs communicated in their PRs, quarterly and annual reports how EBITDA and cash targets have improved in 2021. All the steel types are delivering more revenue on a $/ton basis and Cliffs suggests HRC can be a proxy for guidance forecasts. Yet, incorporation of spot HRC pricing is lagging in Cliffs booked EBITDA due to contract provisions. So what is Cliffs booking for sales compared to HRC spot pricing? Numbers are from Midwest HRC futures and historic data and Cliffs reports. In 2020, Cliffs booked an average $610 per ton HRC and spot market in the second half of 2020 averaged around $686/T. 1Q 2021 booked HRC at $757 per ton and spot averaged around $1253 (Cliffs reported average as $1201). 2Q 2021 booked HRC at $1071 per ton and spot was averaging about $1660. The Q3 spot averaged about $1878 PE ton and Cliffs reports on October 22. Projecting, Q4 spot is averaging about $1800 per ton HRC. It appears Cliffs EBITDA is still in contract catch up mode going into 2022."
"A steal at these prices. No pun intended. Just like many where late to the energy sector-oil and now the rush. The same will play out with CLF, smart money will pour in and the rally will be sharp."
NUE announced buying a scrap processor. Mergers continue.
"First of all, let me clearly state: I am long CLF and, to a lesser extent, X, NUE, and STLD, as I believe we're in the first stages of a generational up-cycle for American steel. However, I cannot understand the coordinated share price movement in the ""steel complex,"" especially CLF and X. It's as if neither stock has any ""alpha"" and their fates are inextricably entwined despite major differences in operations and business outlook. Is this just some sort of stock market anomaly? This lockstep movement kinda made sense when CLF was US Steel's major supplier, but now that CLF is a direct competitor I'm scratching my head trying to find a rationale. Anybody have any insights or share my concern about this. Thanks in advance!"
"What boggles my mind is the 11-12% short position in the face of constantly escalating revenue forecasts, almost monthly. I equate this to holding a race horse by the tail with its Johnson strapped extra tight."
"Some musings from an annoyed DUCK.... CLF will be somewhat unchanged in Q3 from Q2. Timing of cash out lays is important to my outlook. The cash out lay will be be something like this; in the first 3 weeks of Q3, Kofi confirmed at the CC that CLF had paid down $450 million on the debt wall. That will show up next week. Then LG bought the preferred for $1.2 billion. The debt standing at Q2 was $5.4 billion. Thats 5.400 - .450 + $1.2 = ~$6.15 billion. Remember, that $450 million came out of Q3 earnings. One could conclude that a maximum of #1 billion could be used to drop the debt from this number bringing it down to net $5.15 billion. Thats a perfect scenario, but it could be a bit less. Not to forget, the float has dropped 10% on that move. Now we have a $775 million acquisition just announced. Thats not showing up next week at earnings. So, if we have another $1.4 billion FCF quarter minimum for Q4, then we should see an additional $650 million debt reduction bringing net debt to $4.5 billion for 21/10K. This is when the fun starts.Auto contracts and ST contracts are well above 3 months ago. Auto will start Jan 1 with a renegotiated pricing contract well above last years. All LG needs is $1.1 billion in earnings to get net debt $0 by end of 2022. He now controls the EAF feedstock as well as the Pellet feedstock. Feedstock pricing is under control. He has 2.0mt of HBI he is producing and is near to using it completely in house.Due to the nature of timing in contracts, CLF has not had a full realization of this massive run up in the Futures market. They guided for $5.5 Billion based on $1175/ton steel. IMO, Steel should see $1200/ton minimum for 2022. The forward curve is shortening but the pricing is holding demonstrably well short term. With a control on feedstock pricing, CLF is the low cost producer domestically. Their CoGS just keep going lower.Analysts are massively misinformed to the identity of the current CLF. This is changing, but its still a noticeable unforgiveable error by most Analysts. Because Analysts miss the accurate description of CLF, most of the investment world does as well. CLF produces about 28 Mt of Pellets. They sell about 3-4mt externally. At $70/ton CoGS and $130/ton in spot right now, thats $60/ton ebitda which equates to $240 million ebitda. CLF is projecting $7 Billion ebitda for 2021 and $240 million ebitda for external pellet sales????CLEARLY...CLF is NOT an IO/Pellet company. CLF IS a Steel company that is fully integrated with excess Pelletizing capacity and therefore sells the excess. It represents ~3% of EBITDA. It is NOT a meaningful ebitda metric. So, when Analysts call CLF an IO company, they truly do not know what they are talking about. When IO goes up, this helps CLF because it hurts their competitors. Our EBITDA goes UP but there's could go down all things being equal.There is so much uncertainty in the Market right now. I have Ben calling for $30-$34 for Q3. If infrastructure can get passed by end of month, then it should be a reality. Politics is such a wet blanket on the Market. If I miss my target, then I deserve some ribbing. But, the business narrative that is CLF is getting BETTER. Its like a power lifter who is bracing for a monster Pull. Each month that goes by he just gets stronger and the lift becomes lighter. When CLF gets to Q1/22 the ANALysts will see their outlook is wrong going forward. CLF should be in Clean Up mode by then. (Tentatively) $30-$35 Q3"
"CLF has incurred debt for the ABL of $1.2 billion to cover the buybacks. That should have been washed out this quarter with FCF. IMO, we should be net debt equal of last quarter ER. We might have a tiny bit more off the books, but I'm expecting $5.3 Billion net debt. Thats incredible. To wipe 10% of the float in just one quarter with FCF is stunning. I'm truly hoping that buybacks are taking a back seat to tranche destruction. 9% interest rate can destroy this company if left hanging out there for too long. Drop the debt by $1.2 billion each quarter and we are net debt $0 end of year next year. I believe CLF can make more than that, thereby quickening the goal."
"I spent a few hours today going through the Cliffs Q and K reports and their earnings guidance PRs. I posted last week some preliminary items, but this tine I used the Cliffs stats to calculate $ per ton for each steel type, not just HRC. I then reviewed reported financials and determined ratios. A ratio for EBITDA per $/ton HRC as a proxy emerged from the math, which cross checked against actuals in the Cliffs SEC filings. The math is too much information to share on a message board, so I am going to await 3Q results and 4Q guidance to get performance confirmation to cross check against the ratio. An interesting observation confirms the obvious, which is that Cliffs steel sales pricing changes are lagging the spot market price changes— by a lot —but are in the queue to step up enough for Cliffs to best their projections, IMO. The $1900 HRC futures pricing we see now doesn’t need to be sustained for Cliffs to beat their earlier guidance by a lot. A curious thing is that, close enough, all the steel types sold are achieving an increased sales price at about the same pace (not just HRC) which makes the ratio calculation just referencing HRC workable. Also, there are three useful CLF guidance projections to work with, not just the two that posters here delved into earlier. The $ per ton realized sales prices are easy to draw out from the Cliffs filings, but the special footnotes related to acquisition, debt, tax treatment and such put a fog on the detail. It turns out, most of that detail is not needed to make the projections, anyway. I am looking forward to a great earnings call on October 22."
If I am mad as I am at the manipulation how do you think LG and Koci feel
21 BILLIONWe are going higher.
"Cathie Wood says China will buckle under new crackdowns causing a crash in commodities. Does she know that if China buckles, business will go elsewhere like India, Vietnam, and Japan? I've seen people full of themselves, but this woman takes the cake. Buy."
"If CLF meets or exceeds expectations, and if LG does what he committed to do, and if the general market doesn't crater next week - I expect a fun week or two ahead. However, if all the right stuff happens and the market still won't give CLF a rational valuation, then I gotta believe LG and team do something dramatic to extract the value for themselves and their shareholders. It's getting to that point I think. Don't know what that dramatic thing will be - big special divvy, take it private, whatever - and I'm not advocating for any of it and certainly hope we don't reach that point. But I just don't see that leadership team tolerating this too much longer. They don't seem to be the victim types."
Comment on hrc futures: volume is much higher on up days (like today) than the volume on down days…my take on that fact is that there is more interest in buying hrc than there is interest in selling hrc

Dave thanks for your post I have been saying from day one the converts were the problem and I got laughed and yelled at. The good news is that we are three months away from fromHaving them redeemed and they will be redeemed Judy like the preferred were very frustrating on days like today with as flying and cooper too That’s why you have to trade and sell calls around your position
The question I am asking my self is will I be disappointed on 10/22 with the stock price action? I can't tell you how many times I said after the CC well I have to wait another 90 days........it is irrational to think we won't have a good run....It is irrational that the stock price is under $30. Big money manipulation has been going on for years on CLF albeit at racheted up price points......I have always thought maybe the end game for the Hedgies is keep throwing money or naked shares at it until the total market crashes.....other long term longs how are you people feeling going into earnings next week
Sure would like to see this stock hitting near the 23.00 mark today. Pre markets all look green. Steel stocks all showing higher pre market than clf. Hard to believe we are still this low. I thought the low was going to be about 23 since that level has been steady since june. . . and they we had the 10% buyback. Just shows i don't know jack!!!
pay no mind to X dragging us down through derivatives. this is the winning horse to be riding.
Well when we hit 30.00 I going to charter the entire Blue Origin space ship. Going to invite L.G.
Last time Reddit Wall Street bets talked about this stock more than any other stock CLF dropped 30%.Everyone on Reddit and CNBC pumped this and it dropped 30%
"Let us not get carried away on debt reduction. The debt will be extinguished in 2022. It doesn't matter if it is 3rd or 4th quarter. More importantly, new opportunities need to be launched. Now that prime scrap is done and IH Blast Furnace #7 is completed today, what's next. The second HBI plant needs to be kicked off ASAP. The major capital outlays for HBI #2 won't happen until late 2022 and 2023 & 2024. The second site is adjacent to the first site in Toledo. Take a look on google maps. Toledo is close to Cleveland, Dearborn, Indiana Harbor, Burns Harbor, Mansfield and Middletown. Close enough to PA. I believe the Range will get more DRI and Mine upgrades but HBI #2 will be in Toledo. IH BF #7 is going to produce close to 5M tons of hot metal a year. I am waiting to see how much HBI CLF can stuff into it."
"Thoughts on this : "" General Motors is excited to be Nucor's first customer for Econiq as we work to integrate sustainability into all aspects of our supply chain.""General Motors will receive the Econiq net-zero steel beginning in Q1 2022, and it is projected that all steel purchased by GM from Nucor will be net carbon neutral by the end of 2022."
So in an aggressive green market today CLF starts off same and on its way busting past $22. Then boom the manipulation kicks in to make sure that no chance for large amount of 22 calls Friday happen and to get it down close enough to as well take oit the other large volume at 21 by end of day tomorrow. Bleeps!!
"In my opinion.. Monday will be an even day. The highs have been hitting on the even days. The trend for the next high, Imho, is around $22.20 or better. This will set up a beautiful op to buy back and accumulate at a $.50 discount."
Please some insight.....Is the convertible debt a large percent reason why the manipulation if so why do you say that
DOW up 900 points in 2 days while CLF drops $.02/sh . Nothing but good news and articles yet not one bit of movement.
Come on baby. Let the party begin.....rise and shine....
"10-15-21 2:30PM ESTPLEASE ….. PLEASE ..... PLEASE .... I'm begging you .....Pay absolutely NO ATTENTION to the price of Copper or Lumber !The prices of those commodities will have NO IMPACT on Cliffs share price in the near-term!You should be much more worried about where Cliffs share price will be at the end or today, next week and at the end of October !You've invested in Cliffs …. any other potential investments should be of no concern !Let ME worry about those other potential investments.Keep your blinders on ! Concentrate on Cliffs !Just a little humor."
It sure looks like what is going on in the global steel world that HRC will move higher from here....CLF is the only USA producer that controls all the cost inputs so only energy and labor increases will impact their cost per ton
"""The only problem you're gonna have is that you didn't buy more."" - Wolf of Wall Street"
"I keep reading everyone saying that this stock will be heading higher, the question is ""When""?"
LG still playing chess when the others are playing checkers lol!
"Goldman is out with a hit piece on steel while giving an upgrade to CLFs and Cramer is saying sell CLFs...Honestly, I stopped listening to the ""analysts"" years ago. I had subscriptions to a bunch of the investment mags and periodicals, listened to Buffett, Cramer, analysts, etc....ended up realizing everything they put in print has about a 15% to 30% chance of amounting to anything...and by anything i mean not sinking below the price you bought in at.If you want to really invest read:1. Ben Graham's, The Intelligent investor,2. Peter Lynch's, Beating the Street (this one gives the simplest quick analysis formula(s) I use when considering a stock/company),3. Greenwald's, Value Investing and finally,4. READ the quarterly and annual reports of the companies you are looking to invest in! They tell you what is on the horizon, where their money is coming from, where it is going and what their plans for the future are...All easy read's and they have made me a millionaire (not an exaggeration). It didn't happen quickly...slow and steady, but I made more in the stock market in 10 years than I ever did in my 401k, which i cashed out, paid the penalties and taxes and used what was remaining to invest in a value stock. At the time, that was Southwest Airlines (pre-Wright Amendment repeal). In 3 years, my investment realized an almost 10x gain...Stop listening to dipsticks like Cramer, who only tell you what to buy and sell because it benefits them.Pick up these 3 easy reads and put yourself in the driver's seat of prosperity!PS. I believe, based on the above and LG's reports as well as outside factors, that in 10 years CLFs will be trading at a $300/share price-that is a loaded sp that includes dividends and splits. You may disagree with my projection, that is fine, but consider this. In one year, Clfs doubled (tripled for those of us who bought at the covid low) and that was without any tangible acquisition impact. wait until we start replacing our electrical grid (CLF is the ONLY GOES producer in north America), increases to EVs hit the highways, auto manufacturing/sales pick up to 10 year averages and don't forget the USMCA kicking in...HELLO AUTOS!!!Long and Strong!"
"This is new Ted. I am predicting $2B in free cash flow for 3rd quarter based on average selling price of HRB of $1,400."
just as an observation.. looking back in the charts seems that it takes almost a week to a week and a half after earnings report for the stock price to reach its high..
Good expansion move on scrap metal but which company has the largest market for this?
LG Named CEO/Chairperson of the Year CLF awarded Metals Company of the Year and the Deal of the Year
"Market is telling us that the days of steel are coming to an end. It is way too expensive while also totally antiquated and about to be replaced by titanium. Titanium is just as strong as steel but much lighter in weight. Fairly abundant in Australia. Could be time to move out of CLF which will only double or triple in the upcoming year. Invest in titanium, the next 10 bagger."
"LG-""In order to invest in HBI capacity, I need to be short in HBI. I'm not short in HBI, just yet. So, I'm still pretty much in line. By the end of this year, I will have zero HBI to sell to the market because micro internal consumption will be pretty much equivalent to my two-point something million tons production a year. So, they are going to be even, in terms of our internal consumption. So at that point, we might consider.""This leaves HBI external sales leaving the market and creating a vacuum. This also leads me to believe that HBI2 will be announced at Q4/CC at the earliest. It will take 2 years to get it up and running. Its just sheer time to manufacture the plant and pug it together. Cost? About $1 billion. Everything has gone up. Labor, Steel, Shipping. Maybe a smidge lower, but I would expect at most $1 billion."
HRC is up across the board.Nothing else matters.....except that we not control the scrap market.We are going much higher.
GS in Late 2020 published a report giving AR a PT of 3.50... The evidence at that time pointed to a huge run in NG stocks with companies transforming there balance sheets over the next 2 years.. fast forward to today.. AR is 20... We are setting up the same type of run for the steel companies... I expect a double at a minimum for CLF over the next 12 months... in there note... GS estimates next years earnings at 5.30... this is irresponsibly low.... we know for a fact that Auto contract will get ATLEAST 1100 for next year.... IF HRC averages JUST 1K... they exceed this($5.3) by atleast a dollar... CLF by Q3 2022 will be basically a debt free company and most likely get a 6-7 multiple on atleast $6 in earnings... there is your double 40PT... This is extremely conservative...
A dime separating CLF and X. I really never thought I would see the day when CLF's share price was higher than X. Wow! I love them both though:)
"Check out the high volumes and increase in the FLR stock price past 2 days. If you think CLF stock price is going much higher because of strong industrial demand, strong automobile demand, EV and clean energy transformation, as well as the infrastructure bill being passed soon....then you should probably take a hard look at the turnaround story of FLR. If FLR's new CEO and management team are competent, there's no reason why this engineering company can't quickly rebound to it's historical stock valuation. Check out the 5 year stock price chart and read the earnings Q&A for past 8 quarters if you want a potential double within next couple of years."
Look at InvestorPlace re Clf Louis Navellier
"....and we're back over $21 while the broader market struggles (breaking the Friday Spell)....and forward stock splits is not what will aggregate personal wealth within CLF.....improved demand, strengthened balance sheet and the acknowledgement that domestic steel is in a secular growth phase unlike anything witnessed over the last 20 plus years will create wealth.The Buy and Hold philosophy, at least for the next few quarters, should help smooth out the gyrations as things improve, if I do say! Now, back to more important business....my French Buttermilk Scone!Cheerio"
AA up 12% on great earnings. Is aluminum cyclical?
There is so many positive posts for $30+. Yet this stock languishes. It would nice to hear about the risks as market does view the bull case to be correct right now. It is not manipulation. I am long but mainly wanting to understand.
"Congras to LG and the entire CLF team. LG has done a great job in turning around CLF and transforming it with well timed acquisitions , we have rely on his judgement on the scrap metal deal. however, I wonder why NUE didn't buy them. Was the price a bit high? Anyway, CLF and steel stocks in general, with their VERY LOW PE's are a quandary. If you believe the economy will stay strong, tariffs hold , and steel has changed to be a more dependable oligopoly . Then the current prices are a STEAL. However, if you see the steel market as an aberration and steel is very cyclical and headed to the sub $1000, as the outer year futures imply, then the early highs might be it. I think we're somewhere in the middle and with a strong market and infrastructure bill later this month or next, we can push $30. Low PE's could be very attractive or a sign of the top in cyclical industries. While I support LG's latest Acq. We see steel companies taking EXPANSION , X new $3 billion mill, NUE adding capacity, etc etc. Certainly historical what we don't want to see. GIVE IT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS !!!!!! NOT added capacity !!!!!!"
"Barron's Oct 4 Paper: Some of you have wondered about that article. I get the paper via airline miles. Here are some points: /1/ Curt Woodsworth steel analyst Credit Suisse. /2/ The industry's improving financial condition could lead to higher dividends and loftier valuation. /3/ They also want steel makers to ramp up dividends and stock buybacks, as other commodity producers have done. /4/ prices will stay higher longer and that consensus earnings estimates for 2022 are too low - this was per Woodsworth again. He assumes average price per ton of $1200 in 2022. /5/ Estimates 3-4% annual demand in coming years. /6/ 40 dollar price target by JPM Michael Glick steel analyst. /7/ Shareholder centric CEO Lourenco Goncalves owns $100 million of its stock. /8/ at 20 bucks per share, Cleveland Cliffs stock trades for 3-4 times projected 2021 earnings of nearly $6 a share.Hope this helps you all. Boolean"
LG had a plan that he’s been executing nicely.
Did anyone notice short interest increasing from 9.9 to 11.31%? Think this is just ahead of earnings?
"This will explode next week , buy now!"
"With the large volume of call options outstanding with an exercise price of $21 and above, it will be interesting to see how the stock closes on Friday. If professionals like Citadel can get the stock to close under $21, all these $21 and above options would be worthless. If they held the other side of the trades, Citadel would make a fortune keeping the option premium."
I am glad clf did not pre announce their earnings this way when we report there will be no question that they beat estimates and analysts will raise earnings for next year. I think lg will have some surprises in store as he is not happy where the stock is including a combination of faster debt repayments higher guidance and a dividend. A thirty cent dividend annual dividend which yields over 1 1/2 per cent would only cost $150 million yearly easily affordable and also he may mentioned that they will redeem the convertibles like they did the preferred I bought more this weekOn Friday
"Surprised that volumes are so low heading into earnings next week. Also surprised that stock price isn't trending higher with earnings next week, especially since HRC prices have held up pretty well and there is still pent up auto demand and huge infrastructure bill pending. CLF earnings have been below consensus past few quarters, some auto plants have been closed, and LG didn't pre-announce 3Q like he's done previous quarters. Perhaps that's what is making investor community a little cautious going into earnings and holding down the volumes and price. The consensus EPS for next year has been on the rise, and is now nearly $4. Even with a very conservative ~7X PE for this very cyclical company, seems like it should still be trading at around $30 given extremely strong free cash flow."
"Thought I would share.""The concept of a “cash free/debt free” deal is very common in M&A transactions, but what does it actually mean? On the face of it, it is a fairly simple concept. The buyer purchases the business and its assets at completion, and the seller is left with the cash and debt. The purchase price will therefore be the agreed price (excluding cash and debt) + cash and cash equivalents – debt.""One would think that LG would NOT issue equity. IMO, LG bought this company with CLF Coin. CLF did NOT assume debt and add it to our tranche wall. This is a highly accretive and investor friendly move. There is a reason that CLF moved so hard with this info. Add to it some very positive developments across the pond creating an ever growing expensive environment for Steel makers in Europe."
"Waiting for the Fed notes. It will be very hard to tighten monetary policy. Labor inflation is really the only real concern due to Covid and Trump’s immigration policy and Covid. Let’s not forget about productivity gains to offset those increases. I am in agreement with Kathie Wood, deflation is bigger concern. Natural gas is being manipulated in Europe for Putin’s pocket. Not sure how that turns out. Inflation will likely last until Q2. Hard to see it continuing after that."
"OK, I can understand the business decision to buy a scrap steel company and to use cash to settle the MT conversion, but LG must live up to his decision to reduce debt now as that is the one thing shorts have left to hang their hat on."
"my belief is they have a script for paying debt at best possible times for cost effectiveness. But are making so much money that they are buying scrap companies, to guarantee they stay the lowest cost producer and potentially stick it to their competition."
"@PD, this statement was listed as Cliffs financial strategy in their October investors slide presentation.“Use free cash flow for debt reduction, opportunistic capital returns and other strategic initiatives” in addition to buying a scrap business, the statement seems to give Cliffs latitude to do things like early retire convertible debt."
"The shorts are starting to come out of the woodwork. They don't want to hold for earnings, and they don't want to cover at a loss. Expect the posts to increase as we approach earnings."
Another great Acquisition! $300 sp by 2021...
New to the steel stock boards. I bought a few shares of X and CLF yesterday for my grandchildren's trust funds. I have 23 of them. These two companies have great potential and will be a huge winner in a couple of years. Probably sooner. Have a great weekend. Good luck to everyone.
"It is so great that LG is always several steps ahead of the competition planning to leap all obstacles and pave the future for steel. While others pursue a dead end with hydrogen, LG is putting the finishing touches on making steel using only wind and solar."
Another very strategic acquisition. LG is a genius.
"I don't want to repeat myself, but CLF is heading towards $32 near term.Wouldn't be surprised if it gains 20% before earnings."
"If we are being honest about clf and being green,I really dont care about anything unless it makes the sp go up.Vote with your thumbs."
"With his eye on the coming year's increasing demand for automotive steel, coupled with debt reduction, Louis Navallier recommends CLF, ""Coming in with an A-rating in Portfolio Grader, it’s clear the market has it all wrong when it comes to CLF stock. Buy it now before they change their mind and send its price soaring."""
"Same action daily. Run up till midday, then sell off into the close. Thank you sir, may I have another!"
I think I can see fumes coming out of CLF HQ here in CLE today. One day soon...very soon...we'll see rational valuation.
Why are we in an uptrend from the low of October 1st? Answer: because the Lord wants it that way.From now going forward to the next 52-week high there will be many opportunities to cycle in and out of Cliffy.. As I said before Cliffy is like an amusement park and has a lot of exciting rides that both long and short love however as we continue marching forward into ER and beyond she will be inexplicably drawn to the next 52 week high
