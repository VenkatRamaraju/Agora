CLF has average trading volume of 28 million. That is great for institutional buyers who want liquidity both in and out of a stock. LG's great foresight in buying AKS and MT us and his obviously friendly shareholder attitude make it a potential FAVORITE of institutional managers moving into commodity stocks as inflation plays gather momentum . While I've thought the easy money in CLF is over ( $3-$25 in 16 months ) It could ride the inflation wagon to rise another 50% in the next 9-12 months.
"Looks like Nue gained about 20 percent this week, X about 9 to 10 percent and Clf about 7 to 8 percent. Guess things that stand out are debt, share count and probably revenue flow. None of this is bad it just trying to see where is there extrapolation for further movements. So feel free to add to thoughts. The employee benefits would also be an overhang on Clf. Inventory were much higher for Clf than X and Nue was comparable but more finished goods. Those of you who have been around would like that thought on that 4 billion in inventory with about 1.9 if I remember in raw material and about 2.3 or so in finished goods. Inventory in this situation is probably a good think. The share count though it where I think this continued divergence will spread with X only about 300 million out as well. Think you will see more movement with Clf around reporting periods, Hrc holding steady and as more debt and liabilties are controlled. Non of these look like bad investment might honestly might need to be one of your top 5 to 6 stocks to own over the next 3 years. You would guessestimate that about 50 billion or more should be spend in steel usage as the infrastructure takes hold so not bad to add 2 to 3 billion probably to each of the big 4 or so over the next few years. The boon for Clf as we all know it appears that we could pay off all debt in 1 to 2 years what would have probably taken 5 to 10 or more. So if you own any or all of those congrats on a good week and as we are seeing the numbers should be strong till end of the year. Any thoughts please add just sharing that weekly percent difference. Do anticipate X to have more divergence because of the share count but Clf catch back up to those as each quarter rids more debt."
"You all see where LG 10:04 AM EDT, 08/20/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Lourenco Goncalves, Director and Chairman, President & CEO, exercised options for 250,000 shares in Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) for $3,457,500 on Aug 20, 2021. Goncalves, after the transactions detailed in the SEC Form 4 filing, has 4,598,592 shares of the company, with a market value, based on the prior-day closing price, of $107 million.HE IS STILL A BELIEVER"
"Look...this is not mothers' Cliffy...this is now the absolutely best positioned, most cyclically downside protected (ok not good grammar but i think you know what i meant...lol), most in control of its metrics (move money from one pocket to the other...vertically integrated), most shorted and manipulated, most environmentally conscious, US domestic centric, geographically advantaged, astutely almost ruthlessly managed, integrated steel company in the world...PERIOD.The fact we get disrespected like this doesn't amount to a hill of beans...who cares...take it down...please...i just find the shekels and buy more...!!!"
"@ForeverTribe- thanks for the SA post. Just read it. My takeaway is that the author thinks X has better metrics than CLF. It’s hard to disagree based on what has happened up until now. What he didn’t mention was leadership. LG is the best- period. We could probably do well with either stock, but I’m sticking with CLF because of LG and his alignment with shareholder interests. The axiom “Wall St climbs a wall of worry” couldn’t be more appropriate."
Thanks to all that sell in the mornings. I go fishing most mornings for Cheap Shares... Like Clockwork.I've been fishing since fishing opener May 15 2015. The only problem Im not very good at Catch and Release... More people need to short this stock..Thanks again
"Usually when a CEO buys his own stock that is a signal. in this case, I believe it is a big middle finger.

"Stock continues to get played. Tried to hold the 20 day on Wednesday. Nice bounce that was sold. Stock testing the 50 day. The narrative is negative right now. I thought it was good to go when it hit 26. IBD touting the fundamentals at that point. Zebras don't change their stripe.Looking at the daily chart, it seems that there is a 20 period or so time frame between new highs. Not exact. Stock has bounced at the 50 day in the past. I don't see it bouncing yet. I suspect that the narrative is a ways from changing."
"1.6 million shares traded in the after hour session,reaching back to the high of the day. Is something brewing again to shoot us to a new 52 week high this week,I think so. Time will tell."
"Looks like X and Clf are on algo trading now. Exactly at 2.48 to 2:50 pm they both the high of the day. This percentage spread probably is about right. So if X gains 5 percent one day or week hopefully Clf will gain about 3 percent. Would anticipate this difference till share count, reporting or revenue and expense projects are more clear. Nothing wrong with it just be prepared to hold Clf longer and eventually you will hit an equilibrim that drives a massive day or make up ground."
"As of 7:33, johnny (walker RED) made 35 posts in 9 hours today!He/she must be very desperate!GL…"
"I don't like seeing it, but we finished the month down from $25.00 at 07/31/21.Hopefully, we'll see progression in September and head north of $26.00 PERMANENTLY to make up for it.GLTA !!"
Still approx. 40 percent under valued at this time. Our day will come. Cheers!!!
"The analysts' earnings estimates posted on Yahoo have been updated ( finally ). I want to point out that the 2022 number of $3.25 is wrong. This is an important fact because at 8x forward earnings, the current $25 share price seems about right. But the number is inaccurate because it is the sum total of just the first 3Q's of 2022 and NOT the full year. I am close to accurate to say FY22 should be at least $4.25 and therefore at 8X we should be seeing a $34 share price NOW. MY PT remains $40."
Let the dummies lump steel with other materials and fail to take advantage of future profits which are essentially guaranteed. Meanwhile we here can reap the gains while CLF shows why it's a cash cow using synergies and the largest profit margins as the low cost producer of the sector.
"I wonder if LG makes autos take a minimum volume contract at high HRC ($1500+), but then gives them some sort of adjustable terms on the volume above and beyond the minimum, assuming chip shortages persist...?That would be somewhat in keeping with what he was saying (that they'll be paying) but also not completely tying his hands for future negotiations as a honest partner.Thoughts anyone?"
"I think Weiss made a boo boo. CNBC contributor Weiss trimmed CLF but should have trimmed MRNA. I looked at the MRNA chart and dis a quick glance some 18 months back or so. It was trading at $18...not $180! But, $18!!! Then C19 hit and it was a solid ramp up. Then Monday had a full on explosion of 20%+ to $493. Now, I ask you, when would you take profits and walk away from MRNA? I would have walked away after that Monster 20%+ Moon shot on Monday and not looked back. C19 and its variants are most likely peaked. Not for sure yet, but its looking that way. When its finally run its course, where sill MRNA end up? Most likely will never see $493 in our lifetime.Weiss made a big Boo Boo. On the other hand, CLF is paying down debt at an incredible clip. Buying back shares at a sizable clip as well. The steel cycle isn't deflating, its moving into a Super Cycle. Not $2000 Super Cycle, but Not $800 deflating either.Bad move Weiss. Lets see where CLF and MRNA end up come Q4/CC. Better yet, where will these company's be at Q3/22/CC?"
"Since august 13, every high is lower!!Shouldn’t we be on the way to 29, or even 50 or 60?? Chart is not very inspiring!!!"
$35 dollar stock selling for under $24......and the $35 goes up with Q4 earnings and Q1 22 earnings load up and be rewarded while the hedgies play the back and forth with their weekly options
"I still maintain the stock is going to $35-$40 within 6 months if they execute their plan. If the 2022 outlook for Stella holds anywhere near it is now then $45-$50 is likely, especially if a dividend is introduced with a possible buyback in 2022."
So HRC is slowly softening but still overall strong historically speaking. Any steel industry experts with ideas on whether 1200 can be maintained long term or if a drop to 600-800 is eventually expected. Can the company still be profitable worst case scenario it 600-800 happens?
"Like I just posted on X board, CLF (and all the other major steel cos) is probably about two weeks out from announcing their Q3 guidance and it most likely will be above their previous guidance. I would suspect with how hot the HRC spot market has been running, that they will top $2B EBITA for Q3 and probably guide another $2.0B to $2.2B for Q4."
I will continue to buy more shares through 2021...I think we see a break out above $30 in the next month...
"This is a clip from the ""Investor's Business DailyDow Jones Futures: Market Rally Hits Highs As Apple Leads 6 Stocks Near Buy Points; Tesla Cybertruck Delayed"" Article that states the following info ""Cleveland-Cliffs stock pulled back this week from a buy point, but found support around an early entry of 23.55 and has now forged a high handle. Shares fell 3.9% last week to 24.02, but pared losses with Friday's 3% gain. Investors could buy CLF stock as it breaks the handle's downtrend, or as it regains the official 24.87 buy point or even 25.93, just above the high handle.Don't know about you but i would be extremely happy to finish next week anywhere near 26.00!!"
CLF projections are based on 1275 HRC prices. The HRC prices are above that all the way into August next year. Here's to ringing the cash register likes it going out of style!
"Sorry for the holders of 23 call, manipulators dragged down sp from 23 to 22.99 In the last repeat last few Seconds! It is not far!Have a nice weekend!Cheers!"

Let me know if i am wrong but i believe at the end of July cliffy was 25.00. If the books want to look good for the hedge funds then i am hoping we end on Aug 31 at 26.00 That 2 trading days for 1.64 gain.....i think it can be done and will be interesting to watch and see what happens!!!!!

What do people think about the bosses son being named cfo at 33?
Sold the 1000 shares i bought this morning at 24.50 for 25.50. A quick G Not touching the other 3000 shares I have.

"With the average HRC futures pricing for the rest of 2021 over $1800/ton, on which side of the negotiating table would you rather be this fall--CLF or auto maker? Those new auto contracts will bolster CLF's 2022 bottom line. Meanwhile, the 2021 average of $1800/ton HRC vs. the CLF guidance of $5B EBITDA for 2021 based on $1175 HRC through December makes CLF investors salivate. Thanksgiving Day is still three months away, but I already feel thankful for CLF."
Kinda feeling like applying to a job on the CLF website...
HRC continues to defy gravity all the way through June 22. I’m happy to load up cheap shares but holy smokes the steel bears have big brass.
Let’s see what happens tomorrow
"I am new investor in the steel industry. If LG is offered a deal by the auto people.that would be a sound basis for him to give guidance of 5.00 EPS in 2022,, would he be able to turn that deal down? I think the auto people believe he could not.so they will try to settle for a deal that would yield CLF 4.00. Anything less would be ludicrous .Do they compromise at 4.50? I would accept 4.50 if it were a two year deal.."
"September 1st 2021 will place the World back where it was on September 1st, 2001.......

"Sales to automakers are down due to their chip related production cuts BUT. . . this in the Wall Street Journal this morning: "". . . Cliffs said it was able to redirect some of that steel to the spot market, where the company was able to sell it for higher prices than the auto makers typically pay under purchase contracts with the Cleveland-based steelmaker."""
"Shorts trying hard to make up for the $1 dollar they lost on the 20 leg parlay they made on Fanduel yesterday. That ruined their whole day, and stayed up all night on mama's computer to win it back on shorting this."
"With LG's $105.8M shareholder value, he has much to risk, yes? That being said, he also has the most to gain and that's why I say his interests are very much aligned; therefore, the continued unrelenting focus on peak performance will drive future revenue and valuation growth for LG and others with a similarly vested interest.There's also the Value/Growth game in the markets and once the hot air is deflated from the NASDAQ, materials will be lifted in kind, I say. Stocks like NVIDIA with an absurd PEGY ratio of 5.2x are poised for a material capitulation. Once the roll commences, this is when all the analysts (drinking the Kool Aid and raising targets in unison like a bunch of bloody bots will rotate into other sectors like materials) because steel is essential Mates! Additionally, I feel the debt discount currently ascribed and to be erased henceforward, in and of itself, will mitigate the majority of an HRC reset surprise (and squash the Shorts in the process) adding to the Beta bonus, if I must say! CLF will earn a much higher P/E on that alone, aside from ""Value-Added"" contract stability coupled to vertically integrated independence!Think what you will, but I am a Buyer/Bidder/Holder of CLF! Cheerio!"
If the hurricane makes land fall as a cat 4 it could potentially take significant HRC production off line . This will only move future prices up as the supply side tightens.
"I'll channel Y2K this morning - Take her up Strong Longs, just sayin'"
LG just told us this is a good price to buy and hold. The timing is telling. He is giving investors a signal about upcoming earnings without releasing a formal update. Perhaps he feels formal updates have not served his investors very well in the past.
"You can bet LG is going to keep his ships sailing as long as possible this year. He won't let money sitting in the ground in the UP. At least 10 weeks left in the season, and maybe longer if weather stays hot here. Keep those 8 banger Hemis rolling so global warming lasts longer to extend the season."
"When the big man buys so do I. He’s not been wrong yet . BuyHoldForget I’ll sell when LG does , this is the easiest play on WS .You just follow the lead of what the best CEO on WS does with his company shares."
"I have waited for 6 long years to see this day. All-in into CLF. The journey has been very tough and heart breaking sometimes. But I kept faith in fundamentals, LG's walk and talk, and the timing of his investments. All I can say today ...... I was right! I love CLF. Cheers to all longs!"
"The SA article carried a HRC historic pricing graphic that tells an interesting story because it is something that the author looked at to support some bearish conclusions for Cliffs (e.g. when steel prices cycle back, so do profits—duhh). Yet, those familiar with Cliffs can look at the same HRC pricing trends and see strong reinforcement for a bullish outlook for various reasons, starting with how the high HRC pricing hasn’t fully made its way into contracts and quarterly earnings yet. So I decided to look a little further at HRC historic and futures pricing for more insights. Here are some points for comments. First, Cliffs has told investors HRC pricing might serve as a proxy for earnings via steel market pricing in general since HRC historic and futures pricing is weighted into contracts, although the “New Cliffs” sells only a third to 40% as HRC steel. Cliffs also has told investors their customer contract renewal terms are such that there is a time lag before recent, higher steel pricing can make its way to significantly benefitting their bottom line. Cliffs said not much for Q1 2021, a bit more influence for Q2 and more yet for Q3. In August, Cliffs is guiding EBITDA estimates for Q3 and Q4 at $1.8 billion each while citing just $1175 HRC average pricing. That is despite August HRC spot pricing in the $1900s and futures running above $1200 through the end of 2022–and the expectation that current contract negotiations will reflect this higher pricing structure. Next, something very unusual happened with HRC pricing in the November/December 2020 time frame. If you look at historic HRC pricing over the last 13 years (since 2008), it cycles around between the $400s and $800s per ton with an occasional excursion into the $900s. Yet, in November /December 2020, HRC broke out above $900 and hasn’t retreated on a monthly basis ever since, now residing in the $1900s. So what happened in November/December 2020 that might support a HRC steel pricing breakout like that? Obviously, there was the November announcements of effective C19 vaccines and of course, there was also the national election changes. The “New Cliffs” born on date was in December 2020, but that doesn’t likely cause steel product pricing breakouts. Steel pricing that used to cycle within a double between min and max is now presenting another doubling while the C19 shutdown lost production tries to catch up with unsatisfied consumer demand. Is the high short interest in both Cliffs and X just a reflection of someone’s bet that another shutdown is going to happen or did the short just get caught by surprise about there being effective vaccines within a year of the C19 breakout, eliminating the prospect of a prolonged shutdown or another shutdown due to variants? Who is holding the 40 million surplus Cliffs short interest shares and similar large short in X? Notably, neither Nucor nor STLD are carrying a lot of short interest. So Cliffs is guiding about how they will expect $3.6 billion of EBITDA in 2H 2021 referencing $1175 HRC pricing but spot is currently over $700 higher than guidance. If earnings are figured at 60% of EBITDA (conservative) the earnings over the next four quarters figuring $1175 per ton HRC would be about $4.3 billion or about $8.60 per share. A PE of just 4 would support $35 pps yet the recent SA author says Cliffs is a bad investment at $23. Go figure. So what really caused the domestic HRC pricing to break out from its historic range of 13 years, more than doubling the previous historic peak pricing and still climbing? Is there any realistic event over the next year or two that would push HRC pricing back below $900, considering how the President has already said the US would not repeat an economy shutdown if COVID re-emerges? Will catching up with world steel demand support resumption of that old trading range or will a new HRC, green steel pricing structure dominate with higher pricing?"
We’re making steel for a couple hundred bucks less than our nearest competitors.HRC is STILL rising. Cliffs fair value today is over 40$ and possibly approaching 50$.Buy .Hold.Forget.
"Should attack 25 again this week and take it out. Volume was low today but path of least resistance was UP just as I said on prior post pre-Monday. We should see the FED be less aggressive on THE TAPER. Uncertainty is certain so I do not see them going uber TAPER Talk. Just too risky...and they know that. But whatever, the thesis is for me that we here at THE CLIFF are building up major power which will thrust it significantly higher with 100+ in 2022 my call. I play macro not micro thesis for 98% of my calls. Play the trend that you see developing and extrapolate out to see where it should be headed. MR MARKET is forward thinking unlike most investors who play FEAR on what TODAY is doing and get their guts all worked up over...yes...NOISE. Good luck to all. BE LONG AND STRONG but don't invest what you can not afford to lose. Boolean"
"I've been ""pushing the numbers around"" as I like to do around this time of the quarter, and am amazed that the analysts are still projecting lower EPS next year compared to this year. There is no way that CLF makes less next year. They will be renewing the annual auto contracts at substantially higher prices, they will have a lower diluted share count, and less net interest expense. if they can realize roughly $1200/ton average selling price of steel products (which is almost almost guaranteed and probably on the low end) they will have revenue of over $20B and EPS of $7/share.Wake up analysts!! At least do a little due diligence (isn't that what you get paid for?)!!"
"Only good news today is lead times have increased and many are paying over 2000! HRC is not falling while foreign investment comes pooring into to the US back from China and other nations. Bond yields going up and the dollar rising, but There is no inventory in steel and won't be, so steel pricing will remain high even if the dollar rises and the yield goes up at least for the forseeable future. Rate hikes are coming now faster than most think. The increased dolla will be prompt up by foreign investment coming home and rates will go up to tapper the spending thats fixen to explode, because of no inventory. Supply on demand will keep inventory low. Therefore, inflation has less affect on a integrated company like Cliffs. Look for inflation to continue as well as steel prices. They say as inflation moves higher commodities pull back, but only with high inventory. Clf barely increased compared to others with cost vs inflation. Koci said. Our margins get better as they move higher compared to others. The price you pay by not being 100% fully integrated! Cliffs will fare well in this cycle. Yields and rates will move tech investors. Tech will pay for the equity needed, which will lower their targets from Q to Q! Look for a swap in the future and another roll over is coming. They may hold for while, but trust me. Its coming to a stop and a move over. As America comes back to full production, look for explosion in commodities as The US revamps all industry. From phama to Small appliances and everything in between. We need our own supply chain and it will drive the US forward. My long term outlook as not changed, but As many know me. I despise WS and how they lie to retail investors and drive volatility for the purpose of robbing the retIl from their life savings. People buy value with the hope of futurw gains, but Cliffs has become a stock people love to hate and look for more stable companies. I know sooner or later we move based off shear numbers, but thats all that will move this stock!I see 3 more Qs of nonsense and once the debt is gone and we are averaging 1400 or more a ton FCF people will come, but not yet and I hate WS.Everyone withhalf a brain knows where this company is going. Being fully integrated will bring a boat load of future trust and FCF. Long and Strong, but not happy at how we get there. Its coming and now it can be stopped. Decoupling from the world will do the trick! Oh! Infrastructure will pass in some form and The US WILL RISE FROM THE ASHES! BANK IT30+ YEAR END AND INCHING TO MID 22 OF +40. MAYBE 60-70 YEAR END. HAVE A GOOD EVENING YOU SLOBS!"
Too early to take short term gains............ Need to wait a bit.......... jmo.
It won't be long before LG announces guidance for Q3.
Crazy to find a cyclical stock that will likely move up in price for years to catch up with fundamental valuation no matter where the underlying material price goes. If steel prices rise the overall upward stock move should trigger a 10 bag gain from today's price. Just another stock to tuck away and revisit the status in a few years down the road.
Thats some solid movements in the Futures market. $65 shy of $2000 is a new high. Can we get to $2000 by the 1st of September? Its 2 weeks away. I think its not out of the question and actually looks.......reasonable. Cant believe I just said $2000 is reasonable.
"8-30-21 9 AM ESTHere's what I think about the promotions.Clifford SmithNothing has changed with him other than the added title as President ….. probably because of the others being promoted to EVP.Keith KociAccording to Cliffs his primary emphasis will be on expanding Cliff's presence in the domestic scrap recycling market, BUT ….. I feel that procurement and logistics will be more important in the shorter-term. Koci is better suited than LG to negotiate longer-term scrap deals and perhaps the settlement of MSB arbitration …. a less volatile, smoother talker does have it's advantages. Celso GoncalvesCliffs stated that he will lead key strategic corporate and business development initiatives in addition to finance ….. but this is a development position ….. he'll run Cliffs when LG dies or retires ….. if he can prove himself.Just my opinions.Roger"
Approx. 75 percent upside by the EOY. Buy the lights out. Mute the Mutts!!! Cheers!!!
Market keeps worrying about profit margin compression of many businesses due to inflating raw materials cost.Market should look no further than CLF. Profit and margins will skyrocket (if one understands the businesses and the assets it owns and operates and how CLF as an integrated iron-steel producer execute). The momentum can last the next 12-15 months!
That burst of volume around 9:45 or 10a.m. was huge. 2.25mm shares in 30 seconds. I wish I would've had level 2 open. That would be something to see. Somebody just cleared the board off.

"From the SA article: "" . . . while steel prices will remain high for a while, they must eventually return to the mean.""That's meaningless blather from an author trying to sound like he understands economics and statistics, but doesn't. Inflation is with us and aint going away soon. Prices may fluctuate but I don't think they'll ever return to some imaginary lower ""mean.""CLF's margins are higher and they'll stay that way. The plants that CLF bought for peanuts are now worth a multiple of their former value and the future profits will show it. CLF will go higher for multiples of multiple reasons.Once in a lifetime for me, baby!"
"if we close above the 8/5 intraday low then I'll be pretty satisfied with our resilience through this Fed nonsense and IO price/China/commodity selloff. Q3 earnings will amaze, and if HRC pricing holds at all, Q4 will blow the ship out of the water with IH #7 back online."
Serious question...the convertible holders have a risk free ability to short up the 38M shares so long as the price is above $8.17 and they’re not redeemable until 1/15/22. So why is everyone always harping about “burning the shorts” when only 47M shares are short (per Yahoo 6/30/21) and 80% of them likely have the “insurance” of the convertible???The % short of 47M shares is not a huge % of the float to begin with and 80% of the short shares are likely covered with a good portion of the remainder likely their “buddies” who are tipped off to when the long/short game is happening.There won’t be much more “burning of the shorts” until at least 1/15/22. What am I missing?
low today is $0.04 off of a full close of 8/23-8/24 gap.
Whaaaaaat??!! CLF is the best moving Steel stock? Or maybe the least gutted stock today.
"Every time we've had these painful pullbacks we've always rebounded to new 52 week highs. Sell if you want to. The history says unless you are very lucky to get back in lower, it will be a mistake."
Hey G. I once knew a fund manager who like you didn’t analyze or understand fundamentals. He shorted insperity (at the time called administaff) because he read the charts.

"Some introspective observations about Cliffs… Perhaps obvious, but LG announced Cliffs is using third quarter cash flow to pay off the MT preferred holdings with cash (no issuance of common stock). Cliffs is approaching the half way mark of Q3. Based on earlier Cliffs guidance, the cost for clearing the preferred with cash should be covered and the balance of the quarter left to reload Cliffs cash stash. What gets attention next? The convertible debt (not timely until 2022)? Something else? Maybe just accumulate cash to deliver on the net zero debt target? Trading set a new pps high vs. recent years this week. Timing follows Cliffs release of excellent 2Q earnings and announced payoff of the preferred with cash. 58 million prospective shares were axed with that move and Cliffs now has no external obligations to reconcile for clearing commitments from steel company acquisitions. Just the debt servicing, which is structured to be paid off early under current market conditions. Q2 2021 results affirmed that the delivery of a string of $1 billion to $3 billion EBITDA quarters is real. The string is situated to continue into 2023 or longer, based on actual HRC steel futures pricing and market demand projections. Net zero debt in mid 2022 ought to be “baked in” to the Cliffs future while September sees Cliffs customer contracts being updated for the next year to reflect current, higher steel pricing. Improved PE ratios for Cliffs pps ought to emerge as quarterly results log the EBITDA projections, giving a non linear improvement in the in proportion to better earnings and lower debt load. Short interest of July 15 of around 44 million shares was down only a couple million shares from June 15. What will mid August short interest indicate? The short may have been waiting out delivery of an economic down turn before ante-ing up for shares to cover, but time is running out for hedge funds to cover their shorts cheaply (e.g below $30 pps). Cliffs is only two months out from reporting 3Q results and 4Q results should outperform 3Q due to pending updating in contracts pricing. That economic disaster that would relieve short anxiety appears to be ever so much unlikely as Cliffs approaches 2022. Once Cliffs decides to clear their convertible debt, there is no new source of shares for shorts cover but to pay the price to hold their shorts or try to cover through open market purchases while sentiment is for a higher pps. Interesting times."
"Today, I saw an article surrounding Cliffs striking a deal with the Worker's Union. The contract goes retroactive on Aug 1st and ends around 2024. In life, too many good things happen and you pinch yourself but, Cliffs will get their debt to net 0 by mid 2022, while the Infrastructure as I shared about a month ago will go in the right direction and it is from recent talks. If everything goes well, by end of September Cliffs should be around $30 share price and by December we should be creeping around the 40s. By end of 2022 with most macro factors working in tangent with Pandemic optimism, Infrastructure Bill, Fed Tapering, and net 0 debt, I would be confident to say $60 or higher is happening. Word of advice, if it dips again in the low 20s BUY more! After, August, this stock will be slowly climbing high and then when the Reddit crowd and institutional brokerage firms give it a big BUY signal that is when the market momentum will propel it to the $70s and higher by 2022. This is not a trade but a long term play. We're getting close to major in the next few weeks."
"2x ebitda lol. CLF is ridiculously undervalued. Those calling for an end to this ""super cycle"" are about 2 years too early. Buy."
The chart never ceases to amaze me. One could trade this almost perfectly. Me? I'm content to just ride the train up the hill.
all time high Sept futures $1945.
Don’t forget that once net debt is paid for with a healthy 1 billion or so in the vault for a rainy day LG simply will never have to sell steel at losses again . He can simply set his bottom line and lower production a bit and wait it out . Auto has not negotiated with a healthy steel company in a long time . 600$ HRC will not be seen again and probably never under 1000$ with the inflation our bumbler in chief has unleashed . If I had to guess today $13000-1400 is going to be the new low .
"One year ago today, CLF was $6.32 per share. Where will it be one year from now? Guidance a whole lot better now than one year ago. Easy $45-$50."
HRC strip moving up. Above $1650 out to end of year. Just wow. Couple that with reduced debt financing and you have yourself a wicked virtuous cycle going on in the steel companies. The earning yield is so massive that they really should consider using a portion of cash flow to buy back stock. It’s almost irresponsible at these yields. That especially goes for $X as well.
HRC hits all time high today $1940.
https://www.argusmedia.com/metals-platform/newsandanalysis/article/2247113-Cliffs-to-shift-scrap-buying-internallyInteresting article
I do not always drink whiskey all day but when I do be assured it involved CLF. Long and strong. Cheers!!!
This move won't last....NOISE AGAIN...look at money flow...BUY THIS DIP if you are looking to buy in or to add. IDA proves again INFRASTRUCTURE is KEY. Boolean
LG has $110M+ equity in this bad boy. And he doesn't stop adding.
This chart is beautiful. If you are from the Midwest and you know the auto industry you know Detroit and Cleveland do not mess around.
Time to buy more.
NWI Times reporting this morning that Cliff’s Burns Harbor union employees received $3500 2Q profit-sharing checks. Union members are ecstatic at this new post-Bethlehem Steel record.
Putting my money where my mouth is and picking up some more shares this morning. Im up to 430 shares. Not a lot for some people but its a lot for me. Long and strong with CLF
"How does LG come up with net debt $0 by the 4th quarter of 2022? He actually mentioned by Q3 but then mentioned that the preferred would take a month off his projection. So, how does he put $6.2 billion in the coffers or debt tranche retirement in 5-6 quarters? Steel is barely above $1200 for all of H2/22. Only $1.4 FCF for Q3/21 and Q4. LG needs $1 billion+ every quarter in earnings for all of 2022 to pull that off. Do you believe he's telling the truth? If so, thats $8 on his conservative view, in earnings for the year. Do you believe LG is being conservative with his remarks? Every...single...time...he has guided higher and raised pricing references at each CC and sometimes in between CC's. I believe for LG to make such a powerfully bold statement as Net Debt $0 by the 4th quarter, that the runway has to be much better than what he is lending on to. Better to be conservative and beat than be exuberant and miss. He has hit all the numbers every time, and then some, every time. LG made those predictions of cash flow and Auto hasn't even been negotiated yet.Thoughts? How do you all think LG is going to get his pricing to reach over $ 1 billion in earnings each quarter for all of 2022?"
"Nippon Steel indicates profit could top latest forecastAuthor of the article:ReutersReutersYuka Obayashi and Ritsuko ShimizuPublishing date:Aug 30, 2021 • 10 hours ago • 2 minute read • Join the conversationArticle contentTOKYO — Nippon Steel Corp’s annual profit may beat the company’s recent sharply upgraded forecast, a senior executive indicated to Reuters, as steel prices outside Japan continue to rally on strong demand while iron ore prices have plunged.Earlier this month, the world’s fifth-biggest steelmaker raised its annual profit guidance by 54% as solid global demand boosts steel prices and earnings of its units in India, the United States and Brazil. “Our overseas businesses have been outperforming our expectations in July and August,” Executive Vice President Takahiro Mori said in an interview conducted last week.AdvertisementSTORY CONTINUES BELOWArticle content“The situation in the U.S. is better than we had anticipated, which could be a factor for an upside of our performance.”The Japanese company had expected the U.S. steel market to peak in July, but it has remained tight, with hot coil prices staying above $2,000 a tonne, Mori said.Plunging iron ore prices are also lending support, he said.Prices of iron ore , a key steel-making ingredient, peaked above $230 a tonne in May and dropped to $140 a tonne this month on a recovery in output in Brazil and a tougher stand on emissions in China.“The prices may recover slightly, but not anywhere above $200 a tonne,” Mori said.Still, slower production by automakers poses a risk to the outlook for steelmakers.Toyota Motor recently said it will slash global production for September by 40% from its previous plan due to a global chip crunch, although it maintained its annual sales and production targets.“The impact on our financial results will be limited as carmakers said they will make up for production cuts later this financial year,” Mori said.In Japan, steelmakers have failed in their semi-annual price negotiations in recent years to agree higher product prices with major local industry customers such as Toyota to pass on rising material costs and other expenses.Nippon Steel has taken an unusually strong stance, publicly saying if terms are not agreed for the steelmaker to secure appropriate margins at international level, it may no longer guarantee a stable supply."
"The tail of of caught between 2 ridiculous issues! No volume due to most showing no interest in Steel and cyclicals, because of High attractive tech and other equity markets and the Fed being Dovish on tapering. hence the continued buying and money flows into these other areas. The shorts and low interest allow control. The second issue is the fact that when J Powell does decide it's time they pull us down along with every other equity market play due to that fact. Not only are they in over bought condition now we get punished for it. yet it has nothing to do with the market and production in steel. At least for the short term until people understand the difference between the market and the economy! Vastly different! Either way, what's it take again? Time! Debt, Q3, Q4 #'s and the converts, cash in the coffers. Div? Buybacks? I really am hoping we get to some form of value before he tapers. 40ish PT, but the way this trades and the amount of control with little interest put's me in doubt for sure we get there. Not only do we need great numbers and great guidance, but we need interested buyers who hold and shorten the options play. Tie up those shares and limit the dark pools of naked shares to have any real affect. Will it make a difference? Not sure, but as for now we are stuck in a rut of who and how long they can drag this out. Actually the longer this drags out the better their hand is and those are facts that we can not dismiss. No one said we would not have Good numbers coming up for the foreseeable future, but we better hope people start seeing value plays as a better investment long term or we may never get where we should be. As of now, no numbers represented from Cliff's are showing or giving credence to our PT of true value. It's being controlled by outside influences like the article just posted on HRC pricing. It dampens the outlook to the ignorant. Those are facts that the powers at be can and do use to keep interest very low. It's the same story. Debt the number one issue at hand to rid theses crooks who are holding Cliff's back. Timing now is everything and I say it still is the biggest headwind moving forward! Sorry people, I just don't see it any other way and wish I had better news, but the daily flight and low volume say the story. Week end and out!"
"Have you all been wondering why China has put such a restriction on IO pricing by restricting Steel production? Why is China restricting Steel exports? If you want pricing to drop then you let production run wild until the market is flooded and people stop buying. I see how restricting Steel production can suppress IO pricing. But, that kind of price action is artificial. Sure, China wants cheaper Steel at home, but this in turn is supporting higher prices everywhere else. And this encourages export. Could it be that China is simply pushing back on production because they fear the Steel pricing heading demonstrably higher from here? I've been wondering if China is stalling until the World finds their balance with consumption/production ratio. Thats probably 18 months out. But, still, it all seems backward. Restricting production is buoying Steel prices world wide. Not as much as demand is, but still, it does have an effect. Also, China claims to be concerned about cleaning up the environment. So, they curb Steel output to meet certain environmental guidelines they have set up. Just ruminating on China's impact on Worldwide Steel pricing.Thoughts?"
"When is spot pricing going to roll over? With infrastructure and cars coming back in 2022, will pricing roll over? Or will pricing actually go up? I would imagine everybody waiting to sign those contracts hoping for things to roll over. Those guys are gonna have to sign eventually and could be contributing to their own misery."
"Today we mourn the loss of heroic American patriots in Kabul. May God help their families.Probably everyone on this page has known that steel prices have been soaring at all-time record high levels. If all-time high prices were being set for oil or gold, I think those stories would have saturated news coverage, at least financial news. However, I have not seen much noticeable press about these phenomenal steel prices. Am I missing the news stories, or are you also struck by the near-absence of press coverage? Do news media deem steel prices to be uninteresting, or are they incentivized to not report? If all-time record high steel prices saturated news coverage, what would happen to the share price of steel makers, including CLF?"
"Out of curiosity this week, I've been taking drives to Marquette's Upper Harbor. I watched the American Mariner come in, load, and leave in 6 hours. It doesn't take that crew long to load a belly full of Tildon Mine taconite pellets. The James Oberstar was in last night. Next up, the Joyce L. Vanenkevort is coning in to load today. It's been busy there. Pumperduck, any idea what the worth is for a boat load of pellets?"
"What is it going to take for CLF to breakout much higher? Fundamentals look great, Auto contracts at what should be much better terms around the corner, debt reduction very real and possible infrastructure stimulus as a kicker and we haven’t taken the next leg up. Do we need the 3rd quarter to finalize conviction that CLF is severely undervalued. My gut is when this breaks out it will be a runaway train"
"Dope sellers lol. Imagine unloading a stock trading at less than 2x ebitda over a catalyst that means nothing to it negative, i.e., the price of iron ore."
the Chinese data is meaningless... I'm adding more as the tariffs are still here and demand is still strong. Let the hedge funds play their tricks around options expiration.. we'll see shares go back to the 30's soon enough...
Where are the fearmongers. We rallied from 22.8 to 25.5 when you guys started bashing. HRC 2022 all rallying to 1500. $2.5 per qtr eps for CLF. Just wait for Sept guidance.
"""We think the forward curve is just way too low. We're looking at $1,884 today for prices and next year, the average is, if you look at the market, as you're saying, it's fairly healthy on historical terms, in terms of I think it averages out to $1,250 or something for the year next year, that's U.S. dollars. But that's 35% lower than the current market. And we think that prices are going to go higher, it stays stronger. There's a lot of things going on in the market.

"Lots of sector weakness....on....LOW VOLUME to NO VOLUME. Now, in one day we enter the most dangerous month for the market...SEPTEMBER. BOO!!! and then October...another month of fear...BOO!!! Ahh but we have seen a lot of market correction already have we not! Rotational. Moving through most sectors - but FAANG's held quite well. Small caps pummeled. Any 5-10% correction across the board over a couple weeks would be rehabilitative. But, it may not happen at all and just keep rotationally correcting and rewarding individual stocks that are outperforming on top/bottom and FORWARD GUIDANCE. That would be...THE CLIFF. So hang tough kids if you can. As I had said, 25 would be tough and once we win that the next run to 30 would be easier and 40 easier again. But we need to totally win 25 not just ding it but rising above it for a few days. CONVINCING is what we need and will get. LONG AND STRONG. Boolean"
There is something brewing and its positive. Possibly an earnings revision. I was going to sell calls against my position but seen some high interest in the 24C expiring Friday. 11k contracts volume today vs 6k open interest. With LG exercising his options for shares recently I'll play the waiting game. I could be wrong but it's a hunch.
"The sleeping giant...then all of a sudden it will RISE AND SURPRISE as money flow rips it higher along with the sector.

North of $1800/ton for Q4 and climbing. One can only hope the strength of the Futures market continues to get stronger into Auto contract negotiations along with ST as well. Time for a well timed mill outage for maintenance. 45 days scheduled. Can we get it done sooner?
When selling is the theme I buy!!!!!!!!
If we head over 30 by the first of the year..I will take that ROI everyday!!
"This is Like Clock Work! If we Gap Up at any time, it will come back. Thats not Bearish, Thats a fact. Its an opportunity to ring the register and add on my position. Holding for the next leg up. Don't care of it drops from here. 8 weeks to Q3/CC and $30-$35."
"Convoluted article in SA this morning entitled “Cleveland cliffs: great positioning in the industry, not a great investment”. The author praises Cliffs for its vertically integrated business model and superior results over the last year compared to its competitors. However, he says Cliffs is relatively overpriced since it’s SP has already increased 285% and he thinks the Company’s financial results will flame out as steel pricing retreats starting in 2022. I’m being kind in saying the author hasn’t fully thought through his subject matter. CLF after acquiring AKS and MT(us) was in a horrible financial situation. Throw a pandemic onto a company trying to consolidate and you can see why its SP was very low compared to its peers. It’s a lot easier to pull a three bagger when your SP reflects a company that looks close to BK.Also, one would think that Cliffs will have superior results in an eventual down cycle for the very reasons that the author gave in saying Cliffs Is so well positioned in the steel industry.Not ready to call this guy out for a hit job, but IMO he’s meshuga."
"More shares, more Jan 22 calls at a discount. Enjoy!"
"Pumper, they're tickling that gap!!! Usually 3rd time is the charm. I guess we'll see tomorrow..."
"Does anyone else besides me feel like you just can't seem to accumulate enough clf shares? It is by far my largest holding, purchased as low as $3.91 and as high as $25.44 and pretty much everywhere in between. My wife thinks I am insane but I really believe this goes above $50 in the next 12-18 months."
"FWIW Max Pain website says 22.50 today. Whether you believe in it or not, CLF track record gives max pain theory some credence. If you're looking for more shares cheap, may want to consider a buy order at 22.50. I don't like it, but that's the game we're in."
This price action shouldn't surprise anyone. They had to wipe out all the calls for tomorrow. CLF is still printing big money daily. Keep your eye on the prize.
SO MUCH FEAR...we see Healthcare and Utilities STRONGER as investors go into hiding...same with FAANG's. When everyone believes in it...IT WON'T HAPPEN. I think the rotational trades that have been correcting sectors will end and we will actually see MARKET RESILIENCE and STRENGTH not collapse as feared. CLIMBING THE WALL OF WORRY. Position into small caps as well that have been beaten down...cyclicals too. We should attack 25 this week and get above it. WILL LOOK AT CHART this morning for a bit - have not done so for a couple weeks. Boolean
"Nice job LG and Cleveland Cliffs Family!!!""The Company achieved a total vaccination rate of 75%, or nearly 19,000 employees out of its workforce of approximately 25,000 employees. Also, 27 of the Company’s 43 locations achieved a vaccination rate of at least 75%. When the program was launched in July, the Company-wide vaccination rate was 35%, or only approximately 9,000 employees. In the 45 days the Program was in place, the vaccination rate more than doubled, achieving numbers way ahead the vaccination rates of the local communities where the facilities are located, and also significantly ahead of the national vaccination rates.Lourenco Goncalves, Chairman, President, and CEO said, “I am delighted with the success of our vaccine incentive program. I appreciate the support of our local managers and union partners in making herd immunity a reality at the majority of our locations.” Mr. Goncalves added: “I implore both my steel producing peers and all other companies who have not already done so to implement similar programs, in order to defeat this nasty virus in our country once and for all.”Other highlights include:Indiana Harbor, the Company’s largest facility and the largest steel operation in the United States, achieved a vaccination rate of 78%, compared to its location’s county rate of 43%.Middletown Works in Middletown, Ohio achieved a vaccination rate of 75%, compared to its location’s county rate of 46%.United Taconite in Eveleth, MN achieved a vaccination rate of 75%, compared to its location’s county rate of 55%.""Hopefully, more employees will come in from the cold as time goes on."
my prediction is we will be at $30.00 in 51 days.
"So, how high of a price will CLF get for Auto? I'm starting to believe that LG is going to get a running average and then some. That's somewhere in the $1700's. Short term contracts, all of Q4 has been ~$1700+ for 2 months now. That makes me start to believe we see $1700 for Q4. Throw in some Spot to sweeten the Pot and some Pellets to fill the Gullet, and Q4 looks mesmerizing. If we make about $5 billion at $1118 realizes for Q2, how much at $1700? $7.225 billion. And a clean $3+ billion in ebitda.....for Q4 alone!!I can't stress enough the massive impact to the SP when $3 billion EBITDA comes through the 10Q. Its not just the number but also the realization that Debt is coming off the books like water out of a pitcher, and $800 is NEVER coming back. $1200 is the New Normal, possibly $1300, and then the ANALysts will be looking at a $3.5 billion in net debt and as much as $7 billion ebitda. They will see a path to debt free and dividend reinstatement in 2022. Thats going to be an Earth Quake. $30-$35-Q3$50-$60-Q4And give me a serious ribbing if I miss Q4 even by $.01! I deserve it!!!!"
PCE number just released. Highest rise in prices in 30 years. Progress in reverse. Thanks Joe and Kamala. That $1200 didn't go very far. A couple of tanks of gas and a Snickers bar.
Be very careful how low you take this one with LG sitting on a gold mine of cash……..

How are the analysts not seeing that CLF will renegotiate auto terms in the next 33 days and the realignment of those contracts will be generationally transformative for the balance sheet...Is the sector going to do amazing? Yes. Is CLF the only winner? No. But is this auto analysis completely being missed/discounted? H311 YES!
"The weakness in other commodities , delta , and weakening in the broader market are all obstacles we need to overcome to see CLF go meaningfully higher. On a positive note CLF and the steel companies are tied to US demand NOT CHINA. Tariffs and oligopoly pricing should keep profits high unless delta slows the economy a lot. When you go from $5 to $25 in a year and there are legit reasons to be concerned about the market and other commodities have weakened, that is a good excuse to take some profits. With a HUGE Q on the horizon , I think we can move up again. A peak in Delta soon would be a good reason for CLF to pop. As I've said for several months $24-25 EASY MONEY IS OVER. Demand and the economy has to stay STRONG for another meaningful move in CLF. While CLF hit a new high recently , that high wasn't much higher than where the stock was in early June. So the upward moves are getting a little harder to achieve . Still long, looking for one more move near $30 in the 4th Q. However as I said we need a little help from the market and declining Delta. The china stuff is meaningless noise."
Wow Oct 21 HRC breached $1900 today and Nov 21 up 2% to $1825. Today’s price action is a GIFT!
Nice article in WSJ today about steel and emissions reduction. All the photos are Clf locations.

"How important to the infrasture,is the electricalsteel that AKS brought to CLF?"
Q1/22 futures has basically stayed inside of a $50 channel for 2 months. Its pretty sizable the handle that has formed.
Looking back a few months. $CLF has traded down on weeks where monthly options chains expired. All 3 months having friday be the lowest close. All three were followed by rallies that started the following monday.
"This is what I'v been saying, How does a company anywhere across the globe reduce Carbon Emissions with much lower steel pricing? They answer is simple. They can't or they go broke! At least here in the US! Over seas as Lg has said, they will be subsidized by their own Government, which puts us at a disadvantage. So, either there will be much more steel consolidation from broke companies( eventually) or prices remain high for some profitablility. If there is another way, please explain it!!!"
"There is a multi year High at $31.20 some 8 years go. We are such a different company with different metrics, but I believe if we bust through $31.20 then the Monster Gap to $35.xx will be closed relatively quick. Its one of the reasons I keep talking $30-$35. And that price by Q3/CC will have Enormous Catalysts to push the SP. 1) Infrastructure2) Renegotiated Auto contracts that will Finally give us a more normalized refection of current HRC pricing.3) confirmation of share extinguishment4) confirmation of debt wiped that was associated with share extinguishment. 5) additional $450 million put towards overall debt finally confirmed.6) a potential to peer into the first quarter for guidance. I can't stress enough. We can have a steady drop in HRC for a solid 6 months of $100 each month starting in October and we will still be slated to wipe the debt to the point Net Debt $0 by Q3/22/CC. Thats the impact that Auto drag has had on CLF pricing this year. But, I have a thought and I'm wondering:What happens if HRC Steel stays well above $1300 for all of H1. There is a path for my conservative views of $1300/ton being too conservative. Automotive manufacturing has Not even come back to normal production yet. Its a 6-12 month journey back to normal. Infrastructure will be several months down the road before it impacts Steel. But, it will. I'm guessing 12-18 months before it starts to have an impact of Steel pricing. This has me starting to wonder if $1300/ton is just too low of n average for 2022. I can't really give my opinion yet on HRC pricing. But, I should have a pretty clear view by November. Another strong pricing support is that BIG OIL has Not come back to normal yet. The discipline in production is incredible. But, at some point those wells lose too much pressure and you have to keep drilling just to maintain production. Thays coming with a vengeance within 3-6 months. But, what happens when the U.S. Consumer finds its footing and the Covid varient is behind us? Yep, OIL consumption will increase sizably. Thays more Steel for Pipe lining and Well platforms. Its ALL coming together at the same time. It truly is the perfect storm. We may jot see sub $1800 till 2022. Again, I will have a much more clear picture by November #$%$ 2022 will give us. But, I believe its safe to say that CLF will NOT be at $30 by end of year. $40 looks way too low for Q4/CC. You just can't have $8-$900/ton ebitda and have a $40 stock. 17MT at $800 is just Huge!! We shall see."
Maybe CLF should do a earnings guidance update today or tomorrow morning instead. Say something like their order book is filled up to 10bln that sort of thing. Lead times up to 3 months. The stock is just being disrespected big time
"Sold a fraction today in my cash account (got bills to pay) but bought 3x the amount I sold in my IRA.Long and strong, thank you LG for paying for private school for my kids this year (and for the next 6 years for that matter)!"

There will be no issuance of shares because there is such a long time before we can retire without penalty. We can more than pay of the ABL before that date. Just no reason to add shares
"I am still sorting out pros and cons for clearing out the convertible debt. As I understand the terms, the debt issuer can collect interest around 6.5% per the agreement but can also convert shares based on about an $8 pps conversion price. The conversion represents about 38 million shares or about 7.6% of the current common. These terms were given to help fund the HBI facility, which has been a boon for Cliffs. Likely, C19 recovery effects and the commodities super cycle were not anticipated when the debt terms were negotiated. So now if Cliffs wants to cash out the convertible debt that originally delivered about $300 million to fund HBI construction, Cliffs will need to ante up a whopping $960 million +/- from free cash flow and that convertible debt clearing out cost rises as the pps rises, perhaps to $40 and beyond. So how best can LG get this noose off the neck of common stock shareholder value realization? Meanwhile this convertible debt “covered” short skimmed about a buck pps today through hyped trading news, for paying off for however many shares were engaged with the short that dropped the pps on under the diversion of China and Afghanistan events. I looked for convertible debt detail in ypthe latest 10k, but could not find it. Thoughts?"
"And one more thing: I would like to see a dividend reinstated some day as much as the next guy, but gee wiz, what in the world are they doing over at X??? .01 cent per share?????I wonder how shareholders like that?If you owned 50,000 shares, that's $500 per quarter. Just enough to have to pay estimated quarterly taxes on, or else get penalized.

"$5.4 billion in debt. $450 million paid down by Q2/CC. A few days later, $1.2 billion added to debt to buy back 10% of shares. Total debt $6.2 billion. LG claims to create $1.2 billion this quarter for debt buy down. Net debt $5 billion Q3/CC. Another $1.25+ for Q4. Net debt $3.75-$3.5 billion for Q4/CC. Guidance for 2022 will be shared at Q4/CC.By this time the overall outlook, currently being 'diagnosed' at $1200/ton average for the year, will create another $2 billion over our current 2021 guidance. But, there's a caveat. The forward curve is closer to mid $1300's. Thats.....today, looking into 2022. ~$7.5 billion ebitda is what it looks like...right now at a minimum. $3.5 billion net debt with $7.5 billion ebitda guidance should be stunning in and of itself. But, a net debt $0 target after wiping 10% of the float AND $3 billion in debt in 2021 should be enough to get Mr. Market to sit up and take notice. That's $10/sh minimum in earnings. A proper valuation should take root around the time of the Q4/CC. When Q1/CC rolls around and only about $2 billion is left......?? What more does CLF/LG have to do to prove it to the Market?Another caveat; Q1/22 won't be $1300/ton average. It won't even be close. Its roughly $1545/ton right now. They could sell their tonnage today for Q1/22 and lock it in if they wanted. They just might be doing that right now anyway. CLF is calling $5.5 billion based on $1175/ton for 2021. $1550/ton for Q1/22 equates to $2.975 billion ebitda for the quarter. Take out some unknowns and we have $2.5 billion. We are looking real good for a clear path to $0 net debt mid year."
"Back to CLF as a topic - i think at this point, unless you're living under a rock, you can safely assume that, on an EPS basis, CLF will be above $5-6 both this year and next year. But what is holding this stock back from the multiples for Nucor, etc. (aside from the debt leverage that we all know is being paid down) - in my opinion, it is broader institutional ownership. There are individual investors, like many of us, who loaded up in the low/mid single digits and many of us still own a lot. Some hedge funds joined the fray in the low double digits. Some index funds added. But plain vanilla long-only funds are largely not in. Maybe they still are avoiding the sector, think we are still an iron ore play, don't have name recognition, only invest in dividend-generating stocks, etc. Let's all hope they get in soon. When they do, we see $50+."

This $22-26 range will break to the upside soon, as of next week 2/3 of the 3q will be in the bank at prices few analysts expected. If they stay this high through earnings reporting time, CLF will EASILY BE $30 if not higher. Smaller steel buyers are still finding almost impossible to get what they want. Pending 4Q shutdowns for maintenance should only keep steel prices high into 2022. BIG MOVES IN CLF STILL LIE AHEAD!"

"It’s easy to conclude that the consumer will ease up on buying Autos if the price keeps rising. But I think there is more to this story of increased Auto pricing.No doubt, parts are more expensive to assemble an Auto today than 18 months ago. But, I have to wonder just how much more are these parts in an $1800/ton environment? They aren’t. But they will be. Also, is it not reasonable to conclude that all suppliers for Auto are on Long fixed contracts? When did this pricing really get out of hand for Autos? I slipped in and bought my SuoerDuty in December of last year. MSRP had Not jumped yet, but dealers were giving NO Deals! Steel had barely crossed $1000/ton for spot, but contracts were already negotiated 3 months prior. Yet, here we are some 8 months later and under the same Steel pricing for Autos as last year when Steel hadn’t crossed $1000/ton average. So, that leads me to wonder, Why did that MSRP price for trucks jump by 10%? Does anyone think they are even done?I think there is an obvious realization by Autos that the price for parts is going up dramatically, and Ford is getting ahead of the game. By the time LG walks into their office with a bottle of Hooch, the Autos will have figured in the worst case scenario into their pricing already. I think we are already paying it. With that said, I believe Autos can hold up on raising prices pretty soon with stability in the supplier market and with the inevitable lowering of pricing for supplies for 2023. It will give Autos room to stabilize MSRP and even give rebates for ‘23/‘24 if need be and be just fine overall. They will have ridden the wave and made a fortune in the process."
"The entire steel industry (and the overall market for that matter) was shot upward from 7/19 until mid August, and since then it's been a systematic rolling over process...It's almost like the 10% reduction in float means nothing.

"When this happens you can expect the rotation to begin in earnest! JSWhile that affects all companies, it’s especially significant for fast-growing businesses whose stock prices are more dependent on the large earnings they’re expected to reap far in the future. The shares of such companies got an added boost following the onset of the pandemic as the Federal Reserve’s effort to head off an economic collapse sent Treasury yields tumbling, making those future profits look even more attractive.“If rates go up, they will underperform,” Aash Shah, senior portfolio manager with Summit Global Investments, said of the biggest tech stocks. “That’s nothing against their business, just a reality of discounted cash flow.”"

"CLF Weekly Chart Notes - the 8-week exponential moving average is $23.55. CLF has closed below the 8 week EMA only four weeks of the last 52. 48 weeks out of 52 above is a steady upward trajectory . The slope of the 8-week ema is .33, This is a classic bullish slope. The 21-week ema is 21.53. CLF has only touched that level three times in the last 52 weeks and never closed below. ps. i use 8, 13, 21 and 55 averages because they are the Golden Mean."
"HRC futures average price August-December: $1800/ton. ($625/ton above CLF guidance!)I talked to a steel buyer for a company that constructs steel buildings, and he says that nine months is the shortest time for new structural steel orders.That does not sound like a scenario for short-term reductions in steel prices.I wonder if auto makers are practicing their genuflection so as to appease L G of CLF, King of Steel when they negotiate contracts this fall.Uncertainty is always certain, but the current and ongoing steel fundamentals would make it hard to walk many investors off this CLF."

"It seems Cliffs is waiting for options expiration pps control to get bounced out by the financial muscle delivered when record earnings get booked. It is an interesting development where Cliffs fortifying the scrap part of its vertically integrated steel company assets base is headline news. Is locking down scrap supply a better priority than building more HBI facilities or is LG positioning to do both at once? I presume both, since EAF efficiencies are supported, blended in with the theme of achieving net zero debt."

"If you have not seen the August Investor Presentation, I suggest you review it. It is a very impressive long term outlook. Macro long term thought, is that the trend toward EV’s will drive the need for low weight, high strength steel. The advantage that EAF’s had due to scrap abundance is vanishing. BOF’s will make a comeback in the USA. Nobody in the industry has a clearer understanding of this than LG. People shorting this stock will want to update their algorithms."

The revenue on retailers will look good and early on for a quarter the income won't be bad but as inflation takes away and they have to purchase new goods at inflated prices revenue stays strong but earnings fall. Revenue is merely the cash flow. Earnings is what matters.
"HRC Steel Futures for Sept, Oct, Nov, and Dec 2021 are up this morning, and remain significantly higher than what CLF provided its latest EBITDA guidance for remainder of 2021 on. Sept, Oct, Nov, and Dec are currently trading at $1,938, $1,863, $1,758, and $1,650, respectively. Every time you hear automotive companies say they are cutting or suspending production, it only means HIGHER earnings and cash flow for CLF as they are able to sell their products at much higher spot prices than the much lower contractual rates negotiated with automotive companies nearly a year ago as demand for steel remains robust. Don't be surprised if CLF reports EBITDA of higher than $2B in 3Q versus the $1.8B they provided guidance when 2Q earnings were reported."

"500+ points thanks to absolutely nothing more than Fed minutes of things we already knew, already heard, and which already dropped the market the first, second and third time we heard it."
"Anecdotal evidence points to ongoing elevated steel demand and ongoing elevated profits for CLF. For example, due to unexpectedly high steel costs, an electric utility in our area is postponing substation construction that they originally estimated at $15-17 million. They report that if they paid current prices for steel, the first phase of construction would be double the original estimate. So, they say they are waiting six months, hoping that steel prices decline. If other projects in other places are also being delayed due to unforeseen rises in steel prices, the backlog for steel will grow, and heightened demand will extend further into the future, and CLF will likely continue to make heightened profits for a longer time."
"If utilities are delaying substation construction due to unprecedented steel costs now, what will happen to steel demand as electricity demands continue to rise and if infrastructure spending increases?"
"If LG of CLF, the CEO, exercised his option this week to buy CLF shares, he must have decided it was a strategic time to buy. He must have decided that downside risk was minimal and upside potential was substantial. Why did he choose this time, when he apparently had three more months? I wonder if he bought now because he knows that significant positive news will soon be disclosed to the public, driving demand for shares. I will not be surprised if we hear powerfully positive news from CLF in the very near future."
"The BIGGEST reason HRC shot upward was CLF's purchase of MT-USA. It's extremely interesting to note that the pricing started rising just before the purchase was announced, and then it's been breakneck speed ever since. It's staying higher even with other commodities cooling.Every steel CEO who is happy has our LG to thank."
Why would you want to sell a lot of what you make to auto companies who want discounts and yearly contracts It seems like theres a lot of time and money involved to make this productShouldn’t there be a premium over spot Pricing and fluctuate with market?
"Cliffs had what 5 billion in sales at 4.2 million net tons so that is what is 1,190 a ton. And you look at HRC as an average in April it was about 1350 a ton, May, about 1550, June about 1675 for an average of about 1525. July, August and September appear to be averaging about 1850. So we have a variance of about 335 away from market average of april, may, june. So lets say we have a variance of 335 dollars of market average in July, august and September so our sell rate would be 1,515. Then lets multiple that by 4.2 million to get an estimate sales. I am getting 6.36 billion for 3rd quarter sales."

"The automotive chip shortage is going to benefit CLF in a major way in profitablility. Every ton of HRC not sold at $1,100 ton will be sold at market price. That is a big deal. The chip shortage affected production in the 2nd quarter but GM is getting pounded in the 3rd quarter. I believe this is where LG got the extra money to buy Arcelor's stock earlier than anticipated."
My Thesis is SPOT ON. Today's market move UP target on from my Wednesday call. As for THE CLIFF...this should put us at the door step of a stronger move HIGHER. The move into 2022-23 will be ROBUST and STELLAR so the pre-build into that will set the stage for what comes in those years in terms of the degree of the RISE. Be Early Not Late on these calls or you miss some of the major moves in the stock.

"Now that Cliffs’ projected string of $1+ billion EBITDA quarterly reports received validation from Q2 2021 results and HRC pricing futures, shareholder value realization has shifted to waiting between quarters for new results that further validate earnings. There is also speculation about how high earnings might go before HRC pricing establishes its new normal. So what does the 40 million surplus short position do while Cliffs demonstrates it is delivering on its net zero debt goal? Analyst updates are now projecting mid thirties pps while presuming very conservative, lower steel pricing in 2022. Net zero debt has not yet been achieved but it seems every bit as unlikely that HRC pricing will collapse below $900 in 2021 to be a spoiler as it is unlikely HRC pricing will have averaged above $2000 per ton going into 2023. Delivery of net zero debt bundles in the clearing out of the convertible debt burden and should take 38 million prospective shares away from coverage of that surplus 40 million shares of short interest. In turn, the options expiration shorting maneuvers observed every Friday will be operating without a prospective new issue coverage net, once the convertible debt is gone. LG said free cash flow in 3Q 2021 is amply situated to cover conversion of those MT preferred shares, avoiding 58 million shares of dilution. Then there is FCF from 4Q. Then Q1 2022 and so on. What goes next?"

Wait for it.
"$1300/ton HRC is slowly but surely becoming reality for all of 2022. The futures market is holding $1198 thru October 2022. $1190 thru December. But, what I'm finding so reassuring is that H2/21 is averaging $1830/ton and climbing solidly. Even more reassuring is that H1/22 is averaging $1477.33/ton. And that market is climbing as well.Its tough to look at H2/22 and have a clue where its going at this point. Even ol' Farmer Jim Leventhal is claiming Net Debt $0 in 12 months under current environment. I'm not saying anyone is a Guru per se', simply that people who make it their business to analyze and invest for others are seeing some of the same things we are seeing. Its becoming more and more clear that $1300 is looking a bit too conservative of a base price for the year. Auto isn't going to be that low. I don't believe its reasonable to conclude it stays sub $1300 for new contracts. Not when H1/22 is nearly $1500 and H2/21 is over $1800. Thats 10 months at $1635/ton average.What I'm hoping LG does is have True ups in the contracts, but with floors in the pricing. Something like X did for their futures contracts. Either way, last years contracts are history and we will make a sizable jump in ebitda come H1/22"
"It's not Ida dropping rain Monday on Steel futures rusting in the open atmosphere. It's GS!Forget the naysayers who are upset at LG for dropping them like a Hot DRI pellet and Buy! Noise from these will continue to strike every chance they get. It's funny hardly nothing mentioned concerning Infrastructure in other countries and Here in the US. Just amazing!Also no mention of most of Asia has been in lock down and once the virus allows will start feeding the Mills and much time will be needed to level out the needs and logistics. Demand will increase in Asia and Turkey will feed some of this. Speaking of Turkey. Them are having to drop prices a lot to compete and they are not very profitable having to do so at this time. They are 95% EAF and scrap importers, which poses a issue for them. Of course they will look to dump here. But, good luck with high scrap and cost of shipping and import taxes. GS says 700 to 900? LOL HA HA! I don't think so Freddie! It will average out higher. If you know the cost to get steel here from Turkey after all the expenses are tallied up to do so, you have a baseline cost in US HRC pricing IMO. Hint! It's not 700 to 900!!!!"
"@Ted- read the Barron’s article. Their focus seems more on Chinese steel/iron ore. If China is cutting production due to environmental concerns and raising export tariffs, that seems positive for CLF. As long as HRC futures are in this current range, I don’t see anything to cause concern. Glad I sold VALE and rolled into more CLF a few months ago."

"I think over the next 18 months it is a very low probability that Cliffs hiccups cause a sustained share price reduction.My worries are macro/market. My thought there is if we get infrastructure, drag heals on the larger social programs and regain a split gov’t next November we will have maintained elevated steel pricing and paved the way for SP 50."
"From The NY Times article August. 4The outage will take a financial toll on Cleveland-Cliffs by reducing production volume in the third quarter. ""We expect to generate $1.4 billion in cash from our expected 1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter,"" Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Keith Koci said in a conference call with investors. ""These numbers result from the continued rise in prices on our HRC linked contracts and spot sales, offset by higher employee-related costs and the planned outage at our largest blast furnace, Indiana Harbor No. 7.""So, slab inventory is building as we speak but the shut down will still have a negative impact to numbers, only to be off set by the increased pricing of Steel. And we still get $1.4 Billion FCF??!!!What happens if/when #7 comes back on line much sooner than scheduled? Another point, LG has guided $1.8 billion ebitda for Q4. Those numbers that he guides on are climbing considerably. Can LG get that plant back up 2 weeks early? What is the pricing of Steel in 6 weeks? Higher or lower than right now?Because he got the last plant back up in 9 days compared to 45 day schedule, I think it’s safe to say he is pushing for a lot sooner than October 15.We have some inventory build up. We are currently adding to the build up for scheduled maintenance. We are still guiding for a sizable ebitda. So, what happens when you get old #7 back on line 2 weeks early? She creates 12,700 tons per day. Or 177,800 tons. That equates to $355.6 million at $2000/ton. That’s just 2 weeks impact coming back. That brings me to my sticking point that has gotten a bit of blow back. Auto pricing.CLF can’t drop every Auto contract to chase spot pricing. It would most likely flood that market. But, they don’t have to. Steel companies are loving $1900 steel right now. They Love the current environment. NUE just nix’d their pelletizing operation in Louisiana. They say it’s because it’s not advantageous for them. I’m thinking….Whaaat? Maybe what they are saying/not saying, ‘LG! We are playing the game!’ We love the status quo. Why would you upset the apple cart this year by fighting for Auto market share? Why lowball and try to get in when you can sell your steel at $1900? You don’t have to tool up. You don’t have to get in a bidding war. You can just reap the glut profit for another 12 months. If they are interested in Auto contracts, why wouldn’t they wait 12 months? This is a dream come true for all domestic players. Every one could be net debt free if they so choose.LG, IMO, is in the Perfect Storm position of all time. He won’t get another shot quite like this. I believe it’s one and done to the point of $2000 steel is not going to stay this high. Just my opinion.But no one is coming to bid with any impunity that would drive the price down. AUTo is going to be LARGE."
I added to my position today as the price went down. I think I was a bit more early. The market event is likely more than one day. There is more demand that supply for Cliffs. Just need to stay patient.

"I can dream as much as the next guy, but if contracts with auto makers come in any where close to $1500 per ton, CLF share price will sky rocket. $1500 plus? We'll double in share price in two weeks. Not two weeks from the time it's inked, but two weeks from when the deal is leaked."
"Had 431 shares at a $22.66 price point that I sold at $25.20, made $1100 or so. Bought back in today at $24.08 for 622 shares. Honestly I think a crash is coming probably before the years end, but am hoping to make another $1k before that happens, and then loading up when the price goes down. Was this wise?"
"The auto profits will take an astounding jump in just over a month . I’m guessing it could be as much as a 20-25% jump in total profits . 2021 auto sales benchmark was $650. Now it will be what $1800 plus . And yes shorts I know he won’t realize full spot on these , but a hardball at Detroit’s head will get LG close. Why would he ever give them a 30% discount on spot for a much higher grade steel than plain HRC ? He’d simply find other buyers . The best thing I took from PDs QA from Vitards is that they aren’t in any hurry to boost production with HBI or making more steel. If Detroit doesn’t like it where are they going to go?"
26 out of the last 29 weeks CLF has touched or gone below its 8 week exp moving average. Today that number is 23.12. This is all normal ranges at the big picture and nothing has changed the trend up. $22.44 is the 55 day exp moving average that number today is $22.44. 23 trading days ago the low was $18.50....
"The chip storage is only good for CLF. While demand is high they get to sell more in the spot market at higher prices. When shortage ends, if HRC is still near these levels, CLF, NUE, and X will have them trapped. First CLF will still sell at higher spot while negotiating higher contract pricing. With delta peaking, the Fed clueless, Inflation rising, and the POTUS sinking, CLF will be doing just fine and going to new highs."
"Not so fast NUE! this statement is not actually true. This is part of the overall issue that LG talks about..You can not clain those Green energy #'s as factual when you use DRI made product to help with those numbers! There are many times companies clain one thing, but it's not always true... be careful with the fact around Green energy savings..America’s largest steel producer, Nucor Corp. NUE 3.44% , uses only scrap steel. In July, the company said it wanted to reduce its carbon footprint by using more renewable energy...."
"The Storm is coming.And when it happens it won't be with HRC at $2000. It will be when HRC has found its support at a much lower level. I'm not thinking next quarter but by end of year 2022. Steel hasn't peaked quite yet. We have 3 months at least IMO, possibly 6 months before the rollover. The impact to CLF SP will be demonstrably positive, but not meteoric IMO. The market likes to talk 'Varient'. It also likes to talk weakness in Commodities. Therefore, the narrative is overall weak. However, there is a metric that hasn't been discussed at length yet. Its inflation. Short term, medium term, long term inflation gets different analysis. Short term inflation, or transitory, has happened. Having $1600/thousand lumber is purely unsustainable. Handing out cash by the $Thousands is short term transitory and unsustainable. $2000/ton Steel, unsustainable, Soon to be short term transitory.Now we come to the longer term inflation. Labor has gone through the roof, and That, is Not coming back. Labor is Not Transitory. And the increase in labor costs is not done, IMO. $15/hr for Taco Bell burrito makers is helping to push hourly rates higher for welders and fabricators. A sign down the street is offering $17/hr for shift managers at TACO BELL. You want skilled workers, you better pay more than Taco Bell does, and TB offers a burrito at lunch time. Another Long term Non transitory factor is the sheer lack of workers available. To illustrate: Some of my Building contractor friends are mentioning they can't find skilled workers for building homes. They have to train everyone. Guess how much you have to pay a 'newbie'? Yep, more than Taco Bell. Another example is take a look at prices in the Grocery store. Its incredible. Rib steak used to be $6-$8/lb. Now its $16/lb at CostCo. While steak may come back, short term transitory, it won't come All the way back. I call that medium to long term transitory. Its not coming down in the next 3 months. But, it could come back a bit over the next 12-24 months. Steel is medium term Transitory IMO. But, that reversion will NOT come back to pre pandemic. But, come back, it will. By the time world wide logistics finds its medium and manufacturing along with consumption finds its medium, we will be 12-18 months from now. Labor will have become normal at a level that is truly generational in its move. The U.S. consumer will have accepted $16/lb steak because they can now afford it with $25-$30/hr wages, and possibly much more. We will have accepted $90,000 trucks. We will have accepted $400,000 homes in places that aren't Southern California. Prices are going up. That brings me to the Storm. When we have the Transitory Moniker eliminated from our vocabulary, the 'New Normal' will have inflation baked in. We think that $1300/ton Steel seems unreasonable, but overall its not. Its $1-$2000 added to the Truck I just bought. Its a nonstarter. But when the dust all settles then CLF will be near net debt $0. I think it takes that long for ANALysts to accept the 'New Normal' is NOT $800/ton, but $12-$1300/ton. And then the ANALysts will be staring a $10 billion+ ebitda company, thats debt free, right in the face. Its just the timing of it all. 17mt at $1300 is $22 billion in sales. Whats left to do with all that FCF? Buybacks and dividends. Inflation, as stated earlier, is multifaceted. And CLF is going to be a solid beneficiary of that inflation. About $5-$6 billion in earnings looks about right under that scenario. Thats $10-$12/sh for a debt free companyPick your multiple ....."
Zero debt 2022. Piles of free cash to buyback shares late 2022 and 2023. No way to stop the surge of CLF stock into triple digits.
With hot roll coiled steel prices at all time highs and an infrastructure bill soon to increase need for more steel this stock should start to see increased demand at higher prices which will later translate into a higher￼ stock price￼!!! Q3 reporting in October we should see a $28-$32 price range!!!￼￼

"I gotta say, The Futures market is breath taking. This isn't normal nor is it sustainable. Right?... Right?Every single month in Futures moved solidly higher yesterday. Some months moved a nice dinner at your local steak house. Q1/22 is now flirting with $1600/ton. What is going on?You and I both know. Demand is real. Import drops are real. Production stability is real. How do We know that? Because 16 months out, Dec '22 is $1220/ton. If 16 months out is sparking purchasing on a regular basis then what does this say for the entire Steel market? Demand, demand, demand for Steel is Real!I want to clarify an oversight on a previous post about debt reduction.$5.4 billion in net debt for Q2. CLF is going to add net debt of $1.2 billion. The bottom line target is net debt $5.4 billion for Q3 not $5.0 like I stated in an earlier post. CLF did pay down $450 million of debt in the first 3 weeks of Q3, but that would be associated with earnings in Q3 right?So, I expect Q3 net debt $5.4 billion and Q4 to be closer to $4 billion net debt. If we hold $1300 average for all of 2022, then net debt $0 possible by Q4/22. But, you all know that I foresee a fatter Q4/21 than what LG is leading on. And Q1/22 is going to be a show stopper if we are $1700/ton realized in Q1/22. Exuberant? Maybe. But, so is $1940/ton steel right? By the way, Futures is still climbing? Next stop? $2000/ton within 5 weeks. And at this rate, it could be within 2."

"Looking forward to end of day STRENGTH...that is key. RESILIENCE as already formed. Now we wait for STRENGTH to come in and that day will come so you just build your position before it. Buy early not late once that base is solidified and buy weakness when you can. The Sleeping Giant will awaken, that I am sure. Boolean"
The higher low is more important than the higher high…..IMO. I do not worry about a pull back on the high.
Just about time for the next leg higher to break upward..
CLF just getting started. We have barely reached the pre merger values of all 3 companies combined. It's why we're trading at 2x ebitda. The dam will break soon enough. Cash matters more to Mr. Market at the end of the day. Buy.
"you don't reposition 100 to 500 shares at a time. Watch the trades. Enough let out just to keep down. The thieves have this down to a science from 9:30 to 4, as long as volume buyers stays low, like last two days."
"Over the past year, there has been a lot of discussion on ?Auto Contracts?. How great they are! ~35% of CLF?s steel goes to them. But last years contracts have been a huge liability on profits! Bad timing! But many have called Auto contracts ?very valuable; envy in the industry?. Or are they? LG has made some recent statements that makes me think these contracts, no matter when they are written, are a liability to profits; unless they are set with minimum or no discounts! Guessing what the future holds, in any business, has risk. Lots of it. CLF just proved that. The other 3 Steel guys are raking in the profits, while CLF waits till ?22. Selling to spot and being Low Cost Producer will help profits the next 2 Q?s. But they still will reflect #$%$ profit from Auto! If the new ?22 contracts are set with a significant Discounts? and based on current ?22 HRC futures pricing, ?22 earning?s problem with Auto could/will repeat. We have a guessing game here. The spot pricing is where you want to be now. Or short term contracts. Nue and Stld have done very well over the years with little Auto. AKS nearly went bankrupt with their ?high quality steel? that Auto forced them to sell CHEAP! So, is Auto really good for a steel companies, under the current Auto contract mentality? I?m concerned it may be a liability unless LG forces them change and PAY a Fair Price! I believe we will hear more on this subject from LG. Selling a lot of steel at no profit, in a Recipe for disaster! Especially in the Steel Industry!"
Long and strong 45K shares of CLF. Reddit r/Vitards is a good source of information for the steel sector. Curious if any of you longs are following.
"Again, I had said that taking out 25 would be the big deal - we tried but with less than solid follow through so here we are building our base...consolidating before, what I see as, the inevitable powerful move higher. Have a great weekend. Boolean"
"Is it Friday today? Strangest thing happened, CLF did not end the day on a ""round"" number? The option manipulators must be taking their summer vacations?"
Every day I check in on CLF and it is the same story. This is a screaming buy and hold. Cheers!!!
"It was only a few years ago , X was trading in the mid 20’s while Cliffy couldn’t make it out of the single digits.. We have made up a lot ground .. with more to come !"
CLF is still printing money and should be for at least next couple quarters. Doesn't keeping the share price temporarily low help massively with any potential stock buyback?
"CLF is fine. IT's Normal after a move to new highs that we see a little profit taking. Now that the 2Q is over, the preferred stock repurchased , an the infrastructure bump have all been announced, we may be in a period of slow news. The next BIG move will come after the HUGE 3Q results, if as expected , steel prices stay high. When the 3rd Q shows the enormous earnings potential, coinciding with persistently high steel prices and a ridiculously low PE , CLF will have another strong leg up."
"With the gap at $23.95 filled, it's a good day to close above $25, letting my short puts with strikes of up to $25 expire worthless at the close.Is this a great trading opportunity, or what?More importantly, may God bless the families of our fallen Marines and Navy corpsman."
What is going on with the material stocks today. Accumulation before the infrastructure bill? This dip down looks very algorithmic. Material stocks should be accumulated given what is coming in couple of weeks.
Excellent buying opportunity. Manipulation at its peak. Buy with both hands now.
"Was watching the cars auction in Monterrey yesterday on TV......... and thinking I should have bought a Ferrari in 1960 and just keep it in my garage under a tarp......."" That "" would have been my retirement."
"Regression to 22.51-63 perhaps BUT I believe this dip has run its course. Unlike 2013 FED tapering the economy is now ROBUST and job openings are MASSIVE. Yes some weakness in numbers now due to COVID as I alluded but we should be reaching our peak in coming months. Pandemics last about 2 years and we are addressing this one with solid vaccines as indicated by the 99% hospitalizations of NON-VAC folks and break throughs only a small issue. As more children become infected you will see a strong bump UP IN VAC'S as many more...not all...people through in the towel on the anti-vac position. We have home sales and new home sales coming out Monday and Tuesday - durable goods out Wednesday, jobless claims Thursday along with start of virtual FED meeting and Friday consumer spending, personal income, UMich consumer sentiment which you recall crashed to 70.2 in early August a huge 13.5% decline all based on DELTA COVID. So again, I just don't see the FED coming out UBER TAPER and risk collapsing markets even though the internal strength is so much better than 2013. We shall see. Should be an interesting week. There has been a lot of damage already done to sectors in a rotational hit so I am looking for greater strength to roll in soon. Good luck to all - don't wager what you can't lose as uncertainty is always a certainty. Boolean"
just him waking up in the morning kills the stock market
"CLF near of moving average 200 months ($ 27.38)if the breaks it, fly to the moon ($ 60's - $ 70's)"
I can't stress enough;There is a huge move coming by end of year. And one could speculate that the ratifying into law the infrastructure bill could very well do it. Its looking closer and closer to by October. 6 weeks way. $34 would be an increase by 50% from the low last week. Q3/$30-$35Q4/$50-$60
"Even if you are positive HRC will soon trend below $800, CLF stock today is still selling at a 50% discount. If you're wrong and HRC remains above $1,000 the eventual stock multiple will be massive. From an early age they pound your brain about why it is so important to remain diversified but the best move here is a 150% one stock portfolio holding only CLF."
We still need some volume if your looking for 25 today.
I love the report that CLF is selling on the spot market the steel the car companies are unable to use.
look at the surprise finish 23 + or - on the nose....manipulation without any SEC oversight
Everybody panic. Oh wait absolutely nothing has changed. Cheers!!!
very dangerous to trade it now as at any time THE CLIFF can ROCKET HIGHER. This is what happens to stocks like this that are building power below its price. My MACRO VIEW says this is where THE CLIFF is headed. It could well become the leader in the sector and turn into a MUST OWN STOCK as long term outlook will be outstanding. LONG AND STRONG WHERE I BELONG. Boolean
"HRC futures prices continue to go higher in the outer months. Look for CLF to issue PR around Sept 15th, like they did towards the end of the last quarter, increasing EBITDA forecasts for 2021 by another ~$500 million. If HRC prices remain elevated at end of year, look for extremely high EPS and EBITDA forecasts for 2022 and a much higher stock price as 30% of CLF's contracts are renegotiated during 4Q...including those with auto companies. :)"
"with the war over, there should be ticker tape parades, a Federal Holiday, and futures should be through the roof!Only, the war isn't over, is it?"
"Some of the fed officials are now saying tapering will likely begin in either Sept or Oct as economic growth is strong, unemployment rates have come down significantly since the shutdown last year, and higher than expected inflation. Couple that with the marxist/progressive Democrats will soon begin floating much higher tax rates to fund a portion of the $3.5 TRILLION in additional social welfare spending, and we could see a market pull back in the 5% to 10% range within next month or two. When you hear the Democrats and their propaganda outlets, aka news and social media, say that it's time for the rich and corporations to ""pay their fair share""......remember that the higher taxes mean lower profits and cash flow, which translates into fewer employees and lower wage and benefit increases as CEO's and boards are hired to increase EPS and share prices. Higher costs in one area, such as taxes and energy, will mean that costs will have to be lowered in other areas such as employee costs. Small business owners employ the majority of Americans, and they make up the majority of the so called rich that Democrats loathe and want to attack."
"so some fun sleuthing... I was curious if there were any developments in the Nashwauk story, then I found the MN Dept of Revenue listing of the so called 3,200 acre purchase by MM from ButlerTac Holdings (a very recently created entity mind you) for $12M. The entry on the MN Dept of Revenue listed Arnab De as the contact person with a Montreal Area code phone number for the deal. The professional profile below is of an Arnab De in the Montreal area who is a CPA who operates a consulting firm that specializes in IO pellet operations in N. America (so this must be the guy), he is also the interim CFO of Chippewa. He was recently employed by Tata Steel.https:// www.linkedin.com /in/ arnab-de-08191a95/ (remove spaces)Yet another vague strange Indian/Canadian connection. They do not exist here, they have no intention of doing anything. What is the endgame? The entire operation is either simply a SCAM, or also a money laundering operation for certain people in power here in the US to offshore entities to evade taxes with payoff coming from vested interests in seeing the US Industrial space go down.Just my take on watching this story for 4-5 years..."
how are there not $40+ call options out in '22 and Jan '23 yet?Seems very odd. The MMs are capping any gamma squeeze potential by retail...
"Looks like Credit Suisse has come to the same conclusion as I did a few days ago. Estimates are far too low. I was focused on the 2022 estimates for CLF but, since then, I have looked at the other steel companies and X is also way too low. NUE and STLD are also low but not so severely. perhaps it's the product mix and the technology. But, if so, then CLF is severely undervalued. I am just wondering what the analysts see that I don't see? If they are right then it means the Q4 2022 is forecasted to be a disaster. I just can't believe that. So, I'll be patient and wait for the Q3 results to be revealed and then Q4 2022 estimates will become better defined by the analysts. Meanwhile, way da go Credit Suisse."
