"This is Like Clock Work! If we Gap Up at any time, it will come back. Thats not Bearish, Thats a fact. Its an opportunity to ring the register and add on my position. Holding for the next leg up. Don't care of it drops from here. 8 weeks to Q3/CC and $30-$35."
"I've been ""pushing the numbers around"" as I like to do around this time of the quarter, and am amazed that the analysts are still projecting lower EPS next year compared to this year. There is no way that CLF makes less next year. They will be renewing the annual auto contracts at substantially higher prices, they will have a lower diluted share count, and less net interest expense. if they can realize roughly $1200/ton average selling price of steel products (which is almost almost guaranteed and probably on the low end) they will have revenue of over $20B and EPS of $7/share.Wake up analysts!! At least do a little due diligence (isn't that what you get paid for?)!!"
"Now that Cliffs’ projected string of $1+ billion EBITDA quarterly reports received validation from Q2 2021 results and HRC pricing futures, shareholder value realization has shifted to waiting between quarters for new results that further validate earnings. There is also speculation about how high earnings might go before HRC pricing establishes its new normal. So what does the 40 million surplus short position do while Cliffs demonstrates it is delivering on its net zero debt goal? Analyst updates are now projecting mid thirties pps while presuming very conservative, lower steel pricing in 2022. Net zero debt has not yet been achieved but it seems every bit as unlikely that HRC pricing will collapse below $900 in 2021 to be a spoiler as it is unlikely HRC pricing will have averaged above $2000 per ton going into 2023. Delivery of net zero debt bundles in the clearing out of the convertible debt burden and should take 38 million prospective shares away from coverage of that surplus 40 million shares of short interest. In turn, the options expiration shorting maneuvers observed every Friday will be operating without a prospective new issue coverage net, once the convertible debt is gone. LG said free cash flow in 3Q 2021 is amply situated to cover conversion of those MT preferred shares, avoiding 58 million shares of dilution. Then there is FCF from 4Q. Then Q1 2022 and so on. What goes next?"
$35 dollar stock selling for under $24......and the $35 goes up with Q4 earnings and Q1 22 earnings load up and be rewarded while the hedgies play the back and forth with their weekly options
"HRC futures average price August-December: $1800/ton. ($625/ton above CLF guidance!)I talked to a steel buyer for a company that constructs steel buildings, and he says that nine months is the shortest time for new structural steel orders.That does not sound like a scenario for short-term reductions in steel prices.I wonder if auto makers are practicing their genuflection so as to appease L G of CLF, King of Steel when they negotiate contracts this fall.Uncertainty is always certain, but the current and ongoing steel fundamentals would make it hard to walk many investors off this CLF."
"It seems Cliffs is waiting for options expiration pps control to get bounced out by the financial muscle delivered when record earnings get booked. It is an interesting development where Cliffs fortifying the scrap part of its vertically integrated steel company assets base is headline news. Is locking down scrap supply a better priority than building more HBI facilities or is LG positioning to do both at once? I presume both, since EAF efficiencies are supported, blended in with the theme of achieving net zero debt."
"It's not Ida dropping rain Monday on Steel futures rusting in the open atmosphere. It's GS!Forget the naysayers who are upset at LG for dropping them like a Hot DRI pellet and Buy! Noise from these will continue to strike every chance they get. It's funny hardly nothing mentioned concerning Infrastructure in other countries and Here in the US. Just amazing!Also no mention of most of Asia has been in lock down and once the virus allows will start feeding the Mills and much time will be needed to level out the needs and logistics. Demand will increase in Asia and Turkey will feed some of this. Speaking of Turkey. Them are having to drop prices a lot to compete and they are not very profitable having to do so at this time. They are 95% EAF and scrap importers, which poses a issue for them. Of course they will look to dump here. But, good luck with high scrap and cost of shipping and import taxes. GS says 700 to 900? LOL HA HA! I don't think so Freddie! It will average out higher. If you know the cost to get steel here from Turkey after all the expenses are tallied up to do so, you have a baseline cost in US HRC pricing IMO. Hint! It's not 700 to 900!!!!"
"Nice job LG and Cleveland Cliffs Family!!!""The Company achieved a total vaccination rate of 75%, or nearly 19,000 employees out of its workforce of approximately 25,000 employees. Also, 27 of the Company’s 43 locations achieved a vaccination rate of at least 75%. When the program was launched in July, the Company-wide vaccination rate was 35%, or only approximately 9,000 employees. In the 45 days the Program was in place, the vaccination rate more than doubled, achieving numbers way ahead the vaccination rates of the local communities where the facilities are located, and also significantly ahead of the national vaccination rates.Lourenco Goncalves, Chairman, President, and CEO said, “I am delighted with the success of our vaccine incentive program. I appreciate the support of our local managers and union partners in making herd immunity a reality at the majority of our locations.” Mr. Goncalves added: “I implore both my steel producing peers and all other companies who have not already done so to implement similar programs, in order to defeat this nasty virus in our country once and for all.”Other highlights include:Indiana Harbor, the Company’s largest facility and the largest steel operation in the United States, achieved a vaccination rate of 78%, compared to its location’s county rate of 43%.Middletown Works in Middletown, Ohio achieved a vaccination rate of 75%, compared to its location’s county rate of 46%.United Taconite in Eveleth, MN achieved a vaccination rate of 75%, compared to its location’s county rate of 55%.""Hopefully, more employees will come in from the cold as time goes on."
"The tail of of caught between 2 ridiculous issues! No volume due to most showing no interest in Steel and cyclicals, because of High attractive tech and other equity markets and the Fed being Dovish on tapering. hence the continued buying and money flows into these other areas. The shorts and low interest allow control. The second issue is the fact that when J Powell does decide it's time they pull us down along with every other equity market play due to that fact. Not only are they in over bought condition now we get punished for it. yet it has nothing to do with the market and production in steel. At least for the short term until people understand the difference between the market and the economy! Vastly different! Either way, what's it take again? Time! Debt, Q3, Q4 #'s and the converts, cash in the coffers. Div? Buybacks? I really am hoping we get to some form of value before he tapers. 40ish PT, but the way this trades and the amount of control with little interest put's me in doubt for sure we get there. Not only do we need great numbers and great guidance, but we need interested buyers who hold and shorten the options play. Tie up those shares and limit the dark pools of naked shares to have any real affect. Will it make a difference? Not sure, but as for now we are stuck in a rut of who and how long they can drag this out. Actually the longer this drags out the better their hand is and those are facts that we can not dismiss. No one said we would not have Good numbers coming up for the foreseeable future, but we better hope people start seeing value plays as a better investment long term or we may never get where we should be. As of now, no numbers represented from Cliff's are showing or giving credence to our PT of true value. It's being controlled by outside influences like the article just posted on HRC pricing. It dampens the outlook to the ignorant. Those are facts that the powers at be can and do use to keep interest very low. It's the same story. Debt the number one issue at hand to rid theses crooks who are holding Cliff's back. Timing now is everything and I say it still is the biggest headwind moving forward! Sorry people, I just don't see it any other way and wish I had better news, but the daily flight and low volume say the story. Week end and out!"
"So today, buried in a NY paper, the EPA released carbon data during the COVID shutdown. Guess what? carbon emissions did not change, in fact slightly up. So with most factories closed. no road travel, and 90% of air traffic down, emissions did not change. The green new deal is a scam, and just another steal by the leftists to socialize the country. Thieves. I'm sure the CNBC and MSNBC cons are preparing their lies now."
Why would you want to sell a lot of what you make to auto companies who want discounts and yearly contracts It seems like theres a lot of time and money involved to make this productShouldn’t there be a premium over spot Pricing and fluctuate with market?
"If utilities are delaying substation construction due to unprecedented steel costs now, what will happen to steel demand as electricity demands continue to rise and if infrastructure spending increases?"
"I wonder if LG makes autos take a minimum volume contract at high HRC ($1500+), but then gives them some sort of adjustable terms on the volume above and beyond the minimum, assuming chip shortages persist...?That would be somewhat in keeping with what he was saying (that they'll be paying) but also not completely tying his hands for future negotiations as a honest partner.Thoughts anyone?"
Thanks to all that sell in the mornings. I go fishing most mornings for Cheap Shares... Like Clockwork.I've been fishing since fishing opener May 15 2015. The only problem Im not very good at Catch and Release... More people need to short this stock..Thanks again
"So, how high of a price will CLF get for Auto? I'm starting to believe that LG is going to get a running average and then some. That's somewhere in the $1700's. Short term contracts, all of Q4 has been ~$1700+ for 2 months now. That makes me start to believe we see $1700 for Q4. Throw in some Spot to sweeten the Pot and some Pellets to fill the Gullet, and Q4 looks mesmerizing. If we make about $5 billion at $1118 realizes for Q2, how much at $1700? $7.225 billion. And a clean $3+ billion in ebitda.....for Q4 alone!!I can't stress enough the massive impact to the SP when $3 billion EBITDA comes through the 10Q. Its not just the number but also the realization that Debt is coming off the books like water out of a pitcher, and $800 is NEVER coming back. $1200 is the New Normal, possibly $1300, and then the ANALysts will be looking at a $3.5 billion in net debt and as much as $7 billion ebitda. They will see a path to debt free and dividend reinstatement in 2022. Thats going to be an Earth Quake. $30-$35-Q3$50-$60-Q4And give me a serious ribbing if I miss Q4 even by $.01! I deserve it!!!!"
What do people think about the bosses son being named cfo at 33?
"Cliffs had what 5 billion in sales at 4.2 million net tons so that is what is 1,190 a ton. And you look at HRC as an average in April it was about 1350 a ton, May, about 1550, June about 1675 for an average of about 1525. July, August and September appear to be averaging about 1850. So we have a variance of about 335 away from market average of april, may, june. So lets say we have a variance of 335 dollars of market average in July, august and September so our sell rate would be 1,515. Then lets multiple that by 4.2 million to get an estimate sales. I am getting 6.36 billion for 3rd quarter sales."
"$5.4 billion in debt. $450 million paid down by Q2/CC. A few days later, $1.2 billion added to debt to buy back 10% of shares. Total debt $6.2 billion. LG claims to create $1.2 billion this quarter for debt buy down. Net debt $5 billion Q3/CC. Another $1.25+ for Q4. Net debt $3.75-$3.5 billion for Q4/CC. Guidance for 2022 will be shared at Q4/CC.By this time the overall outlook, currently being 'diagnosed' at $1200/ton average for the year, will create another $2 billion over our current 2021 guidance. But, there's a caveat. The forward curve is closer to mid $1300's. Thats.....today, looking into 2022. ~$7.5 billion ebitda is what it looks like...right now at a minimum. $3.5 billion net debt with $7.5 billion ebitda guidance should be stunning in and of itself. But, a net debt $0 target after wiping 10% of the float AND $3 billion in debt in 2021 should be enough to get Mr. Market to sit up and take notice. That's $10/sh minimum in earnings. A proper valuation should take root around the time of the Q4/CC. When Q1/CC rolls around and only about $2 billion is left......?? What more does CLF/LG have to do to prove it to the Market?Another caveat; Q1/22 won't be $1300/ton average. It won't even be close. Its roughly $1545/ton right now. They could sell their tonnage today for Q1/22 and lock it in if they wanted. They just might be doing that right now anyway. CLF is calling $5.5 billion based on $1175/ton for 2021. $1550/ton for Q1/22 equates to $2.975 billion ebitda for the quarter. Take out some unknowns and we have $2.5 billion. We are looking real good for a clear path to $0 net debt mid year."
"I gotta say, The Futures market is breath taking. This isn't normal nor is it sustainable. Right?... Right?Every single month in Futures moved solidly higher yesterday. Some months moved a nice dinner at your local steak house. Q1/22 is now flirting with $1600/ton. What is going on?You and I both know. Demand is real. Import drops are real. Production stability is real. How do We know that? Because 16 months out, Dec '22 is $1220/ton. If 16 months out is sparking purchasing on a regular basis then what does this say for the entire Steel market? Demand, demand, demand for Steel is Real!I want to clarify an oversight on a previous post about debt reduction.$5.4 billion in net debt for Q2. CLF is going to add net debt of $1.2 billion. The bottom line target is net debt $5.4 billion for Q3 not $5.0 like I stated in an earlier post. CLF did pay down $450 million of debt in the first 3 weeks of Q3, but that would be associated with earnings in Q3 right?So, I expect Q3 net debt $5.4 billion and Q4 to be closer to $4 billion net debt. If we hold $1300 average for all of 2022, then net debt $0 possible by Q4/22. But, you all know that I foresee a fatter Q4/21 than what LG is leading on. And Q1/22 is going to be a show stopper if we are $1700/ton realized in Q1/22. Exuberant? Maybe. But, so is $1940/ton steel right? By the way, Futures is still climbing? Next stop? $2000/ton within 5 weeks. And at this rate, it could be within 2."

CLF projections are based on 1275 HRC prices. The HRC prices are above that all the way into August next year. Here's to ringing the cash register likes it going out of style!
"CLF near of moving average 200 months ($ 27.38)if the breaks it, fly to the moon ($ 60's - $ 70's)"
"HRC Steel Futures for Sept, Oct, Nov, and Dec 2021 are up this morning, and remain significantly higher than what CLF provided its latest EBITDA guidance for remainder of 2021 on. Sept, Oct, Nov, and Dec are currently trading at $1,938, $1,863, $1,758, and $1,650, respectively. Every time you hear automotive companies say they are cutting or suspending production, it only means HIGHER earnings and cash flow for CLF as they are able to sell their products at much higher spot prices than the much lower contractual rates negotiated with automotive companies nearly a year ago as demand for steel remains robust. Don't be surprised if CLF reports EBITDA of higher than $2B in 3Q versus the $1.8B they provided guidance when 2Q earnings were reported."
Let the dummies lump steel with other materials and fail to take advantage of future profits which are essentially guaranteed. Meanwhile we here can reap the gains while CLF shows why it's a cash cow using synergies and the largest profit margins as the low cost producer of the sector.
"Anecdotal evidence points to ongoing elevated steel demand and ongoing elevated profits for CLF. For example, due to unexpectedly high steel costs, an electric utility in our area is postponing substation construction that they originally estimated at $15-17 million. They report that if they paid current prices for steel, the first phase of construction would be double the original estimate. So, they say they are waiting six months, hoping that steel prices decline. If other projects in other places are also being delayed due to unforeseen rises in steel prices, the backlog for steel will grow, and heightened demand will extend further into the future, and CLF will likely continue to make heightened profits for a longer time."
Even closed the mini-gap from Th-->Fri last week... lol. Citadel's clients are ensured the opportunity to pare back any potential losses...
"I can dream as much as the next guy, but if contracts with auto makers come in any where close to $1500 per ton, CLF share price will sky rocket. $1500 plus? We'll double in share price in two weeks. Not two weeks from the time it's inked, but two weeks from when the deal is leaked."
all time high Sept futures $1945.
"with the war over, there should be ticker tape parades, a Federal Holiday, and futures should be through the roof!Only, the war isn't over, is it?"
They are sure trying to hold this down!!! Every week shorts have less and less ability to manipulate……
I love the report that CLF is selling on the spot market the steel the car companies are unable to use.
There will be no issuance of shares because there is such a long time before we can retire without penalty. We can more than pay of the ABL before that date. Just no reason to add shares
"8-30-21 9 AM ESTHere's what I think about the promotions.Clifford SmithNothing has changed with him other than the added title as President ….. probably because of the others being promoted to EVP.Keith KociAccording to Cliffs his primary emphasis will be on expanding Cliff's presence in the domestic scrap recycling market, BUT ….. I feel that procurement and logistics will be more important in the shorter-term. Koci is better suited than LG to negotiate longer-term scrap deals and perhaps the settlement of MSB arbitration …. a less volatile, smoother talker does have it's advantages. Celso GoncalvesCliffs stated that he will lead key strategic corporate and business development initiatives in addition to finance ….. but this is a development position ….. he'll run Cliffs when LG dies or retires ….. if he can prove himself.Just my opinions.Roger"
"If you have not seen the August Investor Presentation, I suggest you review it. It is a very impressive long term outlook. Macro long term thought, is that the trend toward EV’s will drive the need for low weight, high strength steel. The advantage that EAF’s had due to scrap abundance is vanishing. BOF’s will make a comeback in the USA. Nobody in the industry has a clearer understanding of this than LG. People shorting this stock will want to update their algorithms."
"The chip storage is only good for CLF. While demand is high they get to sell more in the spot market at higher prices. When shortage ends, if HRC is still near these levels, CLF, NUE, and X will have them trapped. First CLF will still sell at higher spot while negotiating higher contract pricing. With delta peaking, the Fed clueless, Inflation rising, and the POTUS sinking, CLF will be doing just fine and going to new highs."
"CLF makes big moves and then takes a couple of months in a trading range. This $22-26 range will break to the upside soon, as of next week 2/3 of the 3q will be in the bank at prices few analysts expected. If they stay this high through earnings reporting time, CLF will EASILY BE $30 if not higher. Smaller steel buyers are still finding almost impossible to get what they want. Pending 4Q shutdowns for maintenance should only keep steel prices high into 2022. BIG MOVES IN CLF STILL LIE AHEAD!"
"One year ago today, CLF was $6.32 per share. Where will it be one year from now? Guidance a whole lot better now than one year ago. Easy $45-$50."
"What is it going to take for CLF to breakout much higher? Fundamentals look great, Auto contracts at what should be much better terms around the corner, debt reduction very real and possible infrastructure stimulus as a kicker and we haven’t taken the next leg up. Do we need the 3rd quarter to finalize conviction that CLF is severely undervalued. My gut is when this breaks out it will be a runaway train"
"Sales to automakers are down due to their chip related production cuts BUT. . . this in the Wall Street Journal this morning: "". . . Cliffs said it was able to redirect some of that steel to the spot market, where the company was able to sell it for higher prices than the auto makers typically pay under purchase contracts with the Cleveland-based steelmaker."""
