"Long focussed. 17K shrs avg $9.34. Q: I don't play w/options. Have recently been intrigued by daily volume, especially now that I looked at each of my other investments and saw that their volume is a fraction of CLF's, even when multiple times as big as my fav CLF. In plain speak, why is the CLF avg volume so large? Someone recently made a comment about ""...60% of daily traffic being options..."" - which grabbed my attention. So why so much option trading on CLF and why does it churn on a daily basis? Now beginning to realize that us retailer holders are an extremely small percentage of the share holders. Looking to get smarter. I am in for the long term ride."
"Here is the complaint I filed with FINRAI would like to file a complaint against Carlos De Alba, a stock analyst with Morgan Stanley. The timing of his recommendations (near earnings andafter earnings) has adversely affected the stock price of Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc.By a simple calculation, his recommendations have resulted in a decline of nearly 1 billion dollars in CLF enterprise value. There is no telling the damage he has caused, or who has profited from his recommendations.On 10/15/2021 CLF closed at 21.46.on 10/18/2021 Carlos De Alba issued a price target change to $21 from $26. By 10:09 AM EDT, 10/18/2021 CLF price was 20.65, a change of: -0.81 On 10/22/2021 CLF posted record earnings.On 10/26/2021 Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba maintains Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) with a Equal-Weight and raises the price target from $21 to $22.5.On 10/26/2021 CLF reached a high of 26.51 CLF closed 25.63, a change of -0.88Within two weeks Carlos has changed his target again to be way below the current trading price with no justification. This timing appears odd and seems to be complete stockmanipulation. You can check his recommendations on other steel stocks to see he has pulled thesame shenanigans on Nucor ($NUE) and Steel Dynamics ($STLD). He offers a lower price targetbefore earnings and adjusts the price target higher after earnings still well below the current trading price."
CLF traded down all day because there were a ton of options expiring and no this is not from manipulation. Most people sell their options during Friday. That allows the option houses to sell the shares they bought as a hedge. Which caused CLF to downtrend all day. That is why we were up big Monday. I look for X to pop again Monday as well. Clf will too. Especially if infrastructure passes this weekend. I would rather see it not if it means we get $2 trillion is social spending

"Let's stop the horse race because X will probably experience a similar post Q3 release pullback (as it has in the past) similar to CLF. CLF already enjoys a superior Current Ratio almost double that of X (and they're going to pay out more dividends). I rather rinse the debt and reinvest back into the company at this time. When the demand wanes.....and it will.....CLF will better weather the trough, if I do say! The X Dividend Policy doesn't work for CLF at this time because it's better to save the cost of a Semi-Annual Coupon or Preferred/Convert Dividend than to shell out $18 Million for a .01¢ dividend (keep in mind X's float is 68% lower than CLF). Why do you think there's so much downside exploitation in this sector....the answer is pick on the guy with the biggest mortgage during a recession! As I discussed with Roger Newport (former AKS CEO) many times in the past, debt has been the primary feedstock to these malicious activist managers (and retail trade pups), but this easy-target strategy is quickly coming to a much-needed end!LG knows how best to support our growing 80+ ROE....works for me Mates! Modernize, maintain and crush your input costs. Looking for an instant momentum runup? That's not CLF people; the much-deserved recognition of just how good and cheap CLF is will present itself over time!Do not fear....LG is near!Cheerio"
"The Cliffs 3Q 10Q info confirms how Cliffs steel sales pricing is still in “catch up” with the overall steel market pricing surge. During the earnings report call, LG said something to the effect that 2022 contract pricing combined with HRC spot pricing has Cliffs expecting 2022 earnings to outperform 2021. This table helps fill in why. Numbers are from Cliffs Q reports and Midwest HRC spot pricing. Spot market HRC $/ton Q1 $1253, Q2 $1660, Q3 $1878, futures Q4 $1782, futures Q1 2022 $1441 as of 10/27/2021Cliffs HRC sales avg. $/ton Q1 $757, Q2 $1071, Q3 $1351, Q4 TBDCliffs avg. steel sales price Q1 $826 (calc), Q2 $1118, Q3 $1334, Q4 TBDadj.

"Just for you're thoughts and a perspective outlook.I checked every major 4 this morning for any news on the EU tariff ongoing talks. What did I find? NOTHING! which shows you that this board of Cliff's holders are the most up to date on all and any/everything steel related, which i appreciate and respect. We are the glue! Rock on Cliffs!"
"In reading through the posts today - after the X report - it seems there are a few misconceptions propagating between the two.CLF does not really ship more steel than X - they are practically tied.CLF has a way to go to become Net debt = 0. X may get there this current qtr.CLF carrying $4.5B inventory, X has $2.1B.Last qtr, X had a lower COG/ton vs CLF. Right now, CLF is not the lowest cost producer.CLF avg price/ton = $1334, X = $1318 CLF had net earnings = $1.274B, X was $2.002BX has 287M shares diluted, CLF has 547M. That alone means, all else being equal, X should be 1.9X higher/share than CLF.I think both CLF and X are significantly undervalued vs the earnings they are seeing currently and for the next year. However, by the tangibles listed above, it is X that is more undervalued than CLF, and may be the better near-term investment (less than 1yr).Only when I go to the intangibles - management and how the businesses may unfold in the future - can I come up with reasons why CLF may be a better long-term investment. Maybe we should stop trying to play the ""which is better"" game that Wall Street loves to ply in order to hit both stocks."
"Very good reference chart over on Reddit, listing the largest Ferrous Scrap Processors in the US…newly acquired FPT weighs in at #9.https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/qi5l4x/reference_2020_north_america_largest_ferrous/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
"Very pleased to have reenterd the stock market to invest in steel, CLF and X are at bargain prices. Two of my boys own a successful stamping plant and both agree with me that demand will continue to increase along with strong steel pricing. They're having a hard time getting all steels, especially stainless and costs for product is soreing. They also agree supply and demand isn't going away anytime soon, years. These companies are investments you can tuck away for two years or more and bank big bucks. Good luck to all in your investments."
Some times a sector or stock finds no love...then sometimes for no reason it FLIPS from scorned to GOTTA HAVE IT!! It is just how it works. We see consumer confidence recovered and banks loaded with funds from consumers who built up cash. And as this economy recovers a little at time with improved bottleneck issues it will continue to drive Cliffs top/bottom line. PLUS we have L.G. paying down the debt = more free cash flow and more earnings and more purchases to solidify CLIFFS as a MEGA Company. You buy these types of stocks early and buy more and don't worry about day to day because you know ONE DAY IT RIPS IT and you get your pay day. Do not question if we are right or wrong because WE ARE RIGHT - just DON'T sell because you can't handle the wait. Boolean

The question is do the ones who dumped to catch X today do the smart thing and come back or do they stay and wait for the converts to be gone and risk missing out on the Future surpassing move on X
"If CLF already reported good results and X did the same, shouldn’t CLF move up almost in line with X, when CLF will be lowest cost steel producer?"
We need to sell in the morning and buy in the afternoon. That was a great e/r and we have nothing to show for it compared to the rest of the steel companies. The analysts moved the sp from $21 to $22 . I mean really.
"FINALLY ! After lamenting for months that 2022 estimates were wrong, I finally see this morning that the 2022 estimate is in at $6.20/share. This compares to 2021 at $6.39. I can accept this estimate as reasonable even though I have it at $7.00. My $48 PT is maintained though it requires a 8 x multiple on the forward estimate. The multiple is a subject of much debate and differing views. The stock is trading at a 4 x multiple at Fridays' close. Surely 4 x is too low, yet X is trading even lower. What can I assume is correct? Surely 8 x is not too ambitious?? BUT...I sure would like to see the 24c/year dividend reinstated. That would allow more Funds to add CLF into their portfolio."
"A penny a quarter makes perfect sense right now to let dividend required hedges to invest now while the getting is good . If I were LG I would wait to see what kind of manipulation happens in the next month or two , and of course he might not want to do that if he has buyback plans . If we trickle down to 20$ LG will make either move taking what the market gives him . Cliffs is still undervalued today anywhere under 35$ and possibly under 40$ . LG will take advantage of Cliffs shorts as he has in the past , in fact he’s in such a stronger position now to fully play colluding WS shorts for his shareholders gain not being on the knifes edge of BK ."
"Yahoo finance updated their statistics for Cliffs, showing analyst 4Q projections at $2.62 per share. The analysts’ average targeted share price was also raised to just under $30 pps. I noticed the COGS in 3Q had gone up a few hundred million vs. Q2 for about the same tons sold. Consequently, Cliffs achieving the new 4Q guidance needs to assume Cliffs achieves a higher average steel price for Q4 vs. Q3–or a significantly lower COGS. By what basis might analysts be projecting a higher Cliffs average steel sales price for Q4?"
U s steel earnings validated future. All steel companies are going higher
