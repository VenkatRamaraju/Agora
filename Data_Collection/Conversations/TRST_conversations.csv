More great earnings. Would be good to get a dividend increase.
5% yield not bad!
TRST is up 8.30% to 4.89

Why Can’t the Stupid CANNABIS PEOPLE realize this is a BANK  IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. UNREAL STUPIDITY
No dividend increase :-(
"Wow. Checking in after latest earnings (same old same old) and there's nobody here.The new ""mute"" setting eliminates the fool completely. No more ""post hidden because you ignored this user"".

"Been in this stock since 1990. Was great stock when the old man ran the show. This smuck kid has done nothing for this stock except lose our money. I should of dumped the minute they had the brilliant r/s idea. But I was loyal, and for that I lost good money fast. Can only hope it gets back to even, them I dump or one more quarter and I will take the lose."
hope all you longs slept with your fingers crossed! #trst #rebound #please
"Reverse stock splits are never good. If management wants a higher stock price, improve the business don’t reduce shares. Vote no"
$8 Dolla maybe trst should go into marajaywanna business.Go Higher Trust.

I am going long $TRST. I believe market capitalization at todays level makes this an attractive entry point! I started a position today and looking to add significantly if it goes lower.

"Real estate market in upstate New York is booming and this is only bank with no PMI, Holds all its mortgages. Key bank loves to acquire other banks in this area. First Niagara bank was latest. Share price is dirt cheap - do the math using the balance sheet. Stock will be acquired at these levels."

I don't see much talk about the proposed reverse split anymore.Has this reverse split been shelved or is the company going to sneak this one by the stockholders if possible?

I deposited a Cashier Check and was told I had to wait 10 days before the funds would be available yet they took $200 of the Cashier Check and made the $200 available. I guess they must have cashed the Cashier Check to be able to deposit the $200 but not the rest of the Cashier Check. Does anyone know what Trustco did with the rest of the Cashier Check?
New Regulation Change would Help TRST Big Time!Back to $12

"Just visited Toronto's two first legal cannabis stores which both opened this week - Hunny Pot on Queen West and Ameri in Yotkville. Half hour line at Hunny Pot, which was sold out of CBD products. Shorter line at the newer Ameri, which was sold out of Aurora CBD capsules. Canntrust and Hexo CBD still available at Ameri. The Canntrust CBD they showed me was labelled packaged in August - which shows how much of a delay the various levels of government are creating for these products that are sold out at the OCS. Anyone short any Cdn CBD company likely has no clue what is going on - the diversity of people in line suggest these products will be legal globally sooner than the talking heads think. $ACB $CGC $TLRY $TRST $CRON $HEXO"

Based on QoQ trends only (Q4 2018 ~ Q1 2019), for every day $TRST $CTST does not sell products, they lose $187,255 in revenues and 111.11 new patients sign-ups (assuming segment growth stays in flat, although it might still grow slightly)."

Those who speculated this would happen were wrong. We have a waiting game until sales are back on and profitable quarters will be here in the future. Considering we have huge potential over the years to come our current price is a steal.

"Well, if TrustCo does a 5:1 reverse split, 5 shares @$7 become 1 share at $35 but the dividend remains the same. So wouldn't that mean that whatever dividend I was getting now is slashed by 80%? Trustco saves money paying out the dividend and makes their balance sheet stronger but with Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies gaining popularity and the stock price at $35+, the possibility for a heavier short interest exists. Also, would the 5:1 reverse split apply to the executives stock, or do they have preferred stock that does not get diluted or effected by this reverse split. This, in my opinion, is a significant negative to the retail investor which is you and me."
