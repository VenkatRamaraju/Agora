"Blackstone bought 14.5% of TRST stock,check jan 26 SEC FILING.A very undervalued stock and maybe a buyout coming!!!! BUY"
"Been in this stock since 1990. Was great stock when the old man ran the show. This smuck kid has done nothing for this stock except lose our money. I should of dumped the minute they had the brilliant r/s idea. But I was loyal, and for that I lost good money fast. Can only hope it gets back to even, them I dump or one more quarter and I will take the lose."
TRST should either acquire or get acquired.They are not growing the company in a meaningful way.
2% or 10 were moving up no rushsteady she goes!#trst
Finally a dividend increase :-)
Well manage bank as shown with this quarters earnings. Paying excellent dividend at these stock price levels.

"this bank has been around for over 100 years and they always carry more cash then debt to stay safe. you buy for the 4 to 5 % dividend and ignore the stock price, anyone else here that complains is a short seller"
Hi guys. I am a Korean investor and have a question about the recent reverse stock split.How can I trade my fractional shares? Let me know whether the company has said that it would be paid in cash.
"Just visited Toronto's two first legal cannabis stores which both opened this week - Hunny Pot on Queen West and Ameri in Yotkville. Half hour line at Hunny Pot, which was sold out of CBD products. Shorter line at the newer Ameri, which was sold out of Aurora CBD capsules. Canntrust and Hexo CBD still available at Ameri. The Canntrust CBD they showed me was labelled packaged in August - which shows how much of a delay the various levels of government are creating for these products that are sold out at the OCS. Anyone short any Cdn CBD company likely has no clue what is going on - the diversity of people in line suggest these products will be legal globally sooner than the talking heads think. $ACB $CGC $TLRY $TRST $CRON $HEXO"
this stock was at $16. a share and they ran it into the ground. what caused thei ??
I don't see much talk about the proposed reverse split anymore.Has this reverse split been shelved or is the company going to sneak this one by the stockholders if possible?
"Well, if TrustCo does a 5:1 reverse split, 5 shares @$7 become 1 share at $35 but the dividend remains the same. So wouldn't that mean that whatever dividend I was getting now is slashed by 80%? Trustco saves money paying out the dividend and makes their balance sheet stronger but with Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies gaining popularity and the stock price at $35+, the possibility for a heavier short interest exists. Also, would the 5:1 reverse split apply to the executives stock, or do they have preferred stock that does not get diluted or effected by this reverse split. This, in my opinion, is a significant negative to the retail investor which is you and me."
"its not the reverse. C and BPOP did the same thing and up 25% even after this government has increased. inflation fears. i have TRST..or i did, got out at $7.90 before the stock split/ reverse..whatever. the management plays too many games. ill be back in cause its local, but need lower price. Sorry."
TrustWe Trust you go back up$40.00 at a minimum Reverse splits don’t work
More great earnings. Would be good to get a dividend increase.
