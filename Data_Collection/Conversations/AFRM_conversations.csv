$AFRM goes up $32 in a day and this turd struggles to 15 cents....wow really???
anyone know how to contact bernie anthony?
I used my entire account to buy warrants when they hit .50$… I averaged down to .66 and waited almost a week and price didn’t move much. So I sold it all. Today I was chasing those warrants. Half the position size now because of impatience.This stock was undervalued at 20$. It’s current market cap is what the SPAC paid just to buy 1/4 of the company from the founders. $AFRM is trading at 50x revenue… until the boost today we were trading at 1x revenue. Unheard of in this space.
"To avoid making losses while trading, you need to get full understanding and knowledge of trading and holding"
Some people are just man because they missed the money train.
"I've been very bullish on $AFRM and $SOFI for a few months as they both have been gaining market share at various websites I'd visit. So the $AMZN partnership announcement on Friday was no surprise. I sold my $AFRM over $100 this morning for over 45% gain and moving it to $SOFI and adding even more shares of $JWN under 29....Nordstrom will be back above 38 in the short term in no time. I have also added more shares to $ADSK, which I expect to be back above 340 also in the short term.Keep buying $JWN, $ADSK, $SOFI. Keep holding."
Should have been up 200% already
Affirm should partner with Etsy next 
And the shorts are squirming!!
I told you all on Friday begged you down $20 now wow  just like RH was up $50 and fell $50
"Buy Now, Earn Later"
Been a bagholder since 124 and got out Friday at break even. Good luck longs.
Can you guys over here in $AFRM put this puppy back in the green already? It’s making my $KPLT dip and I got an appointment on the moon at noon
Who in their right mind is this confident in affirms earnings today... This is a 60 dollar stock... please be careful
It needs to fill the gap down to 91$.
"Just want your opinions. I went in at $50, does it make sense to sell it now or hold? Is it overvalued now?"
Downhill in 3....2....1.......
20% in post market on a 100.00 stock after earnings is very rare. I can guarantee that won't hold into tomorrows cash open. Gl tho
coming back all the way
Hahaaaaa and there is it
IN @ $92.75 lets riiiiiide !!!
"Affirm $AFRM collects a fee of 4% - 5% of transactions they process from their merchants... In comparison Visa $V and Mastercard $MA collect less than 1%. Traders bouncing around this stock are misunderstanding the moat here, specifically with their blue-chip partnerships. Today Affirm is processing roughly $1B per month and huge expectations for growth specifically from their Amazon deal, which the details have not been disclosed yet."
big guys are buying today and they sure know what to do with the weak hands.
"Shipping prices and gas prices and labor costs and beef costs are all up significantly in the past few months. Prices are continuing to rise, but growth is stagnating. These are driving business costs upward and leading to rising wages, which leads to a rise in prices, and onward the spiral goes. Terrible.$AFRM, $GEVO, $MRNA, $CMNR, $XOM, $MSFT, $PTON, $AAPL, $AMC, $C, $EFTR, $HOOD, $BRBR"
Ok enough go get some katapult as well this is moving like small cap chisis crist
LULU beats and now up 12.2% in AH.Tomorrow AFRM's turn.
Yahoo... for the 3rd time... do you think you could block ALL the discord posts under ALL tickers? They're relentless!
Anyone buy $126+ Friday at 3:50pm? Tell the truth? It’s going back to $46 this week
Thumbs up over $100 tomorrow!Thumbs down below $100 tomorrow!
big guys are shaking all the small and weak guys off the tree.
"Affirm Holdings stock is soaring even after the company reported earnings that missed analyst forecasts for net income.Affirm reported a fourth-quarter loss of 48 cents a share, missing forecasts for a 29 cent loss, on sales of $261.8M. Revenue beat expectations for $226.39M. The buy-now-pay-later company also said it expects fiscal first-quarter revenue of $240 million to $250 million, above forecasts for $234 million."
"Important to note, Shopify owns 10% of Affirm. :) $SHOP continues to eat away at Amazons moat as each quarter passes."
So glad I took a loan from my wife’s boyfriend and bought those 70 strike calls on Friday!
Below $115 today
This thing has traded incredibly strange all day... something is up.
save me...
Check out KPLT as well. Both AFRM and KPLT should run together.
Lift off.....
Shorts!
Reshorted 111.11 a gift from god
They had some interesting insights about AFRM on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
This stock sure did well in my BUY list!!  congrats to holders.
I heard about AFRM the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Just like I said - no tendies for bag holders
AFRM also has a deal with Walmart to finance items.
Whoa. Up $48K
"KPLT is partnered with AFRM , what ever AFRM rejects goes to KPLT automatically , i'm sure KPLT will explode on Monday , its already up 20% AH"
Just wait until hedgies start selling off their CC holdings and move into fintec. Amazon just nailed Visa with a 0.05% transaction fee... Their multiples are cRAzY... going lower.
So if I have this straight this company’s business model involves lending money to broke folks for items they cannot afford! While they have no collateral on the items. What could go wrong? This is irrational exuberance on display. Might be the best idea since the light bulb. Might be a dumpster fire. Good luck.It’s different this time right?
im not sweating this...millionaire maker soon....amazon on board...already vetted...gonna donwell now that govent is nonlonger supplying the powder
+42.09% PRE-MARKET - Thanks!!
Under 100 by tomorrow... question is how low will itGo? I’m thinking 90-100 what say you
"I looked on Affirm's website to see more about how they will make money. They will charge a business some amount for making a sale from them. I don't know the limits on price. But, it won't be just normal buying small items, I think it will be big purchases. And I don't know the penalty for not paying at the end of the cycle. But it is not one I want to own. I wil keep holding V that gives rewards to people for using the card and Discover gives cash back."
"Missed the AFRM pop, so I'll play its peer KPLT...which will likely get a nice empathy bid on Monday."
"i'll buy some AFRM today. Also checkout TNT just got nasdaq uplist yesterday, its afrm jr, gonna fly soon just a matter of weeks."
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Stocks-tracker.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
I heard about AFRM the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
See y’all at 90!
What we thinking Monday - drop for Monday ?
I sold to at After Hours because you never know what will happen tomorrow morning........Thank you AFRM.I will buy more Tesla with the gains.
Only $40 lower now than where it was when it came public
Two years from now this will be a 100 bn or 200bn company
So how does this company actually make money if it doesn’t charge interest?
ouch this hurts
"I bought PUT 100+105 15OCT contracts, we'll see what happens?"
Congrats to any who are breaking even. Wait till you see RMO TAKE OFF
It would cross $100 after earnings call.. Just added few more shares
Smart money loading up?....
be careful tomorrow can go back to $99....Thank you AFRM I am so happy!
Somebody please tell me why you think this goes higher after the close.
"AFRM will continue to 146 in a month if tomorrow it closes above stiff resistance of 112.8. If this resistance is not broken then only support we have is at 86. So for bullish pattern to remain intact it is necessary to close above 112.8 tomorrow, otherwise it can drop to 86 support. And tomorrow being last day of the week very few people carry over the securities over the weekend. Fingers crossed."
AFRM and bnpl stocks continue to attract investors and take market share from MA and V.Love it!
Anyone not listen to me? 100% stocks that rise huge on earnings crash the following day in this Bear  market
Think I’m gonna wait on $AFRM to sell off some more towards 95-100 ish area and hold that for end of year.. good idea? Was calculating the gain with the analyst targets of 140 and looks like more profit can be made on AFRM Holding till end of year.. good idea?
"$32B market cap for the prospects they have going, is cheap. Shopify, Amazon, Walmart, Target dominate US Ecommerce, and they're all Affirm's partners. There isn't one other significant player outside of those 4. In my view Affirm is prepared for long term, deeply cemented success as an ecommerce beneficiary."
"Party like it's 1999!! Back then it was hot new money-losing internet companies. Today it's hot new money-losing--hey, wait a second... I just had a deja vu."
my face when i saw the after hour
"May be just $115 is the peak, today."
What are the numbers?.......
Everything happen so fast Friday. If I am correct because the bad new was only 6 hrs long with PTON the short only were about 10%. Trying to figure out how fast the out standing shares will be picked up Monday morning before I start buying more anyone have any idea?
LC is next
$KPLT is soaring too
I'll buy below $100
congrats all longs
Hahahaa shorts are panicking
"An analyst today raised their 12 month price target for AFRM to $65 from $55. Yep, you read that correctly. This analyst doesn't think the AMZN partnership will provide any meaningful revenue for at least the next year."
AMZN will buyout AFRM yes sir
Told you to short again at $115!
This actually could hit 130 today...my mind is blown honestly. I know that's still 6 away but it actually could.
Woohoo all the negative comments means we are going up up up buybuybuy
I was wrong on this.
I’ll wait till it tests 100. I don’t like how it’s trading. There’s no conviction. Also AFRM has no moat in a crowded space. Banks and credit firms can create their own BNPL. I’d much rather pay less. Remember the AMZN deal is non exclusive
Is Amazon deal enough to rocket ship us the moon?????
What happened?
I sold it at 63$ in April( why is it so much up?
Gap down to 105 today
Omg I bought 2 minutes before close. What a lucky!!!!
When you only think to check your stonks for the day at 3pm and you see 35% in one day 0_0
Buy the dip
"its any fintech company dream to get just one of SHOP, Walmart, Wayfair, Ikea, AMAZON....., we got them all."
Hope this holds up til tomorrow
Should be a good buy 95-100 range this week
FAMI!
I guess the shorts covered..no more buyers?
"I'm very greedy , will buy more...still cheap for long term hold"
Down after hours over $2. Secondary offering?
$120+ later … $150 Monday opening
"If Amazon deal testing happens quickly and it goes live in next 3 months, I believe AFRM will break the resistance at $112. Also, guidance should be much better after the Amazon deal"
"If Amazon deal guidance is good, it will break the resistance and will reach lifetime high this week of $146"
pattern clearly indicates that it will go down to 102 and may be to 86 depending upon overall market before rising again. This has still not stabilized. Very risky to pump more money into this at a price over $100. I already have a few and will add more at $87.
$afrm is $32 up in one day and PLTR due to Karp CEO who &&&^people off is only 47 cents....wow
Best stock of the year hands down......I've been waiting for something worth investing in and finally something reasonable with wonderful upside.
On Monday it will nosedive just like GEVO did and in the same exact way.
"If AMC, is worth 26 billion, AFRM is worth 500 billion!"
Not going anywhere today. It’s stuck at 92.
(http://Pick-stocks.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
will be up $50 tonight!!!!!
"Future bag holders are 'eating it up' at these prices, butIT' SNOT gonna go much higher!..... back down to the 80's next week when....legacy credit card companies integrate ""Buy Now, Pay ...."" into their products"
Is there anything Yahoo can do to stop the discord posts... please?
It is time for affirm to go where it rightfully belongs........THE TOP.
"Day and swing traders moved their capital over to $BBIG and $GSAT among others for their bull runs today, and with nice $KPLT support setting up over $6.00 plus $AFRM ER coming out tomorrow AH that could have a halo effect on $KPLT SP, they will be back!"
Keep loading before earnings. Earnings & revenue guidance is all set to rise
Your greed will hurt
looks like this could go higher tomorrow.Usually if the momentum loses trend it should dropped back but this is still a 45% today... I recon tomorrow could reach another 15% high.
$109 isn’t $146 or $126 BUT it’s sure better than $46!
"Big resistance at 112. If it crosses that ,146 should be achievable in 2 weeks"
Just wait till the most of the hedge funds start buying back in. 240 in 6 months.
Congrats Max.
"(?) take some % profits... a higher probability of pullback next week... re-entry ?comments, anyone?"
"The news is the greatest! Why it is now selling off! Traders are afraid that this is a pump. News with Amazon which is a gigantic deal, this can easily go to 120. Why to sell. I comfortably entered at 98.50. I will hold through"
Congratulations all
Another 30% today plssss.
A lot to like in this report.
My Nov $100 calls 
Huge sell will go today
Impressed..holding 92 strong...so good chances this will be green tomorrow.
there is a major resistance at $101.5 and then $112. No support until$72. So it will remain in this range for sometime.
"Wow, and I thought tulips were over-valued"
Short squeeze today.
The weekly 100 outs were pennies Friday at 126+ someone made billions
i am in $120... should i sell????
105.64 -18.06 (-14.60%)As of 10:03AM EDT. Market open.
I went to Walmart's site and clicked on a tv to find out how much it would cost to buy it using affirm and the interest rate was about 20%. If you do that you can only have the one item in the cart. check out how to use affirm. It is not for me. I won't be buying the stock. It is just like a credit card.
Once again a bs run up…congrats to those who benefited…some day my ship may come in
Wow under $100 wow  hilarious actually
139 target
KPLT up 4%.
"Hold them shares. Option's are playing their usual games. The recent news about Amazon caught many off guard and now they are trying to steal your shares. Don't let them.A mere month ago, digital payments giant Square announced its purchase of buy now, pay later leader Afterpay in a $29 billion move that rocked the emerging industry.But in an eyebrow-raising announcement after the market close on Friday, Affirm Holdings told investors it's partnering with Amazon to offer its customers financing at checkout. It's a spectacular counterpunch that could see Affirm take the top spot from Afterpay among global BNPL providers.At the moment, Affirm's addressable market is confined to the customers of its merchant partners, but in a move to take more business from the credit card industry, it plans to debut the Affirm Card -- a digital credit card-like product that will incorporate the benefits of BNPL, except consumers will be able to use it anywhere.What the Amazon deal meansWhile the deal is still in its very early stages pending a pilot program, for Affirm's merchant-integrated business model, Amazon is the crown jewel of retail partners. It's the largest online retailer on the planet, generating $221 billion in sales during the first six months of 2021 alone, and it's expected to capture 50% of all U.S. e-commerce sales this year.Each customer who checks out with Affirm through Amazon will likely need to establish an Affirm account. Right now, Affirm has approximately 5.4 million customers, but through this deal, it gains exposure with Amazon Prime's 200 million members.Amazon gets the benefit of boosting some of its customers' spending power. Affirm has an existing partnership with Shopify to offer a similar checkout option, and Amazon can draw some key lessons from that deal. Shopify found that using Affirm's BNPL solution resulted in conversion rates up to 50% higher, up to 28% fewer cart abandonments, and checkout times that were 27% faster.BNPL is also popular with young shoppers, so Amazon might be drawn to the fact that 50% of Affirm's customers are either millennials or Gen Z. These age cohorts will power e-commerce into the future, so it's important for Amazon to offer the financing options that they prefer."
Only Negative I see in $KPLT is their reliability on Wayfair. Even with the partnership with $AFRM wayfair still makes up 70% of Katapults revenue. As soon as they announce a partnership by themselves it will rocket to two digits. I am sure
Affirm and katapult bears in danger tomorrow
under 100 today?
Classic PUMP and DUMP Chart
"At the point when I saw declarations everywhere I thought they were bots or that they were made up till I was persuaded and gave it a try and genuinely I don't regret the move I made on the grounds that I invested my reserve funds, and now my first speculation with him acquired me benefits of more than $87,000 and its still running! Steve continues to convey and procure predictable benefits for me. He's awesome"
What a turn-a-round in a down market. Sweet!
"$AFRM investors may be moving their recent post-AFRM ER gains over to its little undervalued BNPL brother, $KPLT, after the former SP went red today while the latter SP went green for the fourth day in a row"
Under 100 lower than when the AMZN news and great earnings were announced R.I.P.
Will Affirm ever do subprime?
premarket indicates possible big move at open....
ever notice the algos do the opposite of YOU?
Could time to buy is right now. Many will sell early am to take profits.
Finally on the plus side of this stock! Hopefully earnings help blow the top off - and everyone can turn a profit!!!
Drax is wrong...hehehe
Golden opp to buy more.
This is a good stock until people start defaulting and not paying their loan! Buy with ￼ caution
$KPLT are alone in the non-prime market and has only captured a small % of it. Soon you will see other companies partnering with them directly and not through $AFRM. Get in at this amazing valuation before it runs to two digits
Barclays raise AFRM $140 from $115. Outperform go figure.
something bad coming...count on it
Going back to $120
"FYI Capital One acknowledging the power of BNPL firms like $AFRM and $KPLT . . . ""Credit card issuer Capital One Financial Corp will test a ""buy now, pay later"" product this year as competition for consumer loans builds from financial technology firms providing merchants with easy ways to offer cheap financing for purchases.""https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/capital-one-to-test-buy-now-pay-later-product-this-year-ceo-says/ar-AAOoIL6?ocid=uxbndlbing"
"Affirm's customer base is 5M, it will now have access to AMZN base of 200M customers."
tomorrow after market open watch this two stock . ZS & AFRM big money around you
I guess you guys are all the ones that want their kids to get participation trophies for finishing last place lol
I have never known anyone who couldn't afford a credit card nor do I want to.
just so you know the AMZN deal was not even in the guide!!! $150+ by end of year
Took 38k profit
Anyone here also follow KPLT? The CEO sounded on conf call like AFRM is dipping into their subprime product. Could that be true?
Finally in green again lol
Crazy rally suddenly.It should find the ground at $99 first.
yesterday was profit taking.the future of this company is looking really good.people will buy stuff and pay later trust me.
I should have bought more of this instead of ZS.
Unbelievable. As soon as I buy puts the thing explodes without flinching an eyelid
"Felt like a no brainer, so happy I bought during the dip!"
Common stock offering any day now
They did not say anything to justify 34% price increase.
Bot a small position and protective puts. Tomorrow will be wild day....
Bought this in the $60's recently. Wish I had more. May get a chance on any correction. Stock for real!
"AFRM Partner with SHOP-APPLE-AMAZON.,.whatelse can you ask for.,.?"
"You may call me whatever you like but if you are here for the swing you have to think more rationally. This is no short squeeze stock and 50% gain in a single day is not sustainable based on news that eventually firm will make more money. It needs to score the money and shown profitability, then it can rise substantially over time."
Be smart and buy the dip
Funny how you guys on here has no idea how strong affirm is. It will be a $200 by the time they report there next earnings
Im short at 102.5...thanks
If Affirm deny they transfer automatic to KPLT
"Will be $46 again in due time just stay short today down 20% on 10,000% volume spike on fake news was just the beginning. Disclosure: Short $111.11."
"Told you will be below $115 today, don’t buy till $98"
Hitting 95 today no doubt
"so many negative comments, which means that it will continue going upat least there is a consensus that $80+ will be the floor"
this is going above $150 for sure by next Friday after the Amazon deal.
I heard about AFRM the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
buy buy buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Anyone else buy more on the pullback? Was almost same price as before earnings call lol
ready to 200
I missed the boat!
Looks like Morgan Stanley is on the bid @ 120.00￼
Let’s get to $140 tomm
congrats longs..great month
up premarket...
short at 121.70
I heard about AFRM the other day on (http://Thetraderguide.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"In addition to the satisfaction from being long the stock, the knowledge that there were a lot of short sellers hammering the stock on Friday due to PTON news who will get crushed Monday makes the AH announcement and price action even sweeter."
What happened today? Big down on Huge vol
Who is selling this GEM !!
"This is great news, but do that many people who pay for Prime really need buy now pay later?"
Way too many bears. This will move to $150+ this week. Long.
This will look interesting until people start defaulting on their loans.
Going over $100 monday
But what about buying waiting till 91-95
This stock could break that ALL TIME HIGH of $146 going forward. This report should get a lot of attention among investors.
i will buy more ..
Hope I’m not too late buying it at $95!!
"That's enough, it's short time.."
imma need that 20% after chasing the market on this one lol
How are there so many people commenting on this board that have not done basic research? I guess the stock popped so they come running?
Wow... big finish. This thing is gonna moon.
Looking weak here. Expecting a bigger drop to around the $100 area. Gap full is to $95.75
"No position, just watching from the sidelines & enjoying lunch"
Let’s go 105 by close nice flash crash
"I wouldn't be surprised if Elon bought AFRM, to help out his old PayPal buddy Max, especially if the stock falls.It's a game us billionaires like to play, to keep the money in a tight circle. Elon could use it to make Teslas moreaffordable."
CRUSHED!!!!!!!!!!
Enormous growth opportunities. Imagine it in amazon marketplace as a payment processor. This will definitely test 52 week high in next 1-3 month
"your trading platform is so awesome, I never knew your strategies are this great, Mrs StephanieFacebook @Stephanie A William"
Who bought $126+ late Friday on fake earnings? Be honest. I saw  1000 posts saying we were going to $150. LOL 
I mean  I am obviously short over 125 from Friday BUT how is it legal for an admitted short seller who lost millions short AFRM can go on CNBC Bloomberg CNN FOX  and claim fake earnings make billions
"Funny, 1/3 of users are behind on payments and these buy now pay later companies rocket higher in value. Debt to da moon Alice!"
"Guys, wait to buy, it will go back down to 102 (support) again, then we can buy back"
"AFRM charges between 10% - 30% APR depending on customer credit (the interest is added to the payment plan). This APR really is no different than most credit cards. I have credit cards with 12% APR. My credit cards also offer me payment plan but I always pay in full each month. I am thinking that AFRM is mainly designed for people who don’t have good credit score and cannot qualify for credit cards so they can get AFRM; however, these are also the people who are more likely not be able to pay back the loan, hence the low credit score. Remember, this is no different than a bank operation. So if AFRM does not turn a profit in a few years, then they will go out of business or do a secondary offering. Amazon will be a winner since it will generate more sales and will not be “holding the bag” if people don’t pay the loan."
Thanks bought that dip!! and just waiting for recovery!!
festive season are near. Time for shopping and buy now pay later
This glorified electronic layaway stock has a market cap bigger than major industrial and manufacturing companies that actually contribute meaningful products to society
"I just asked my broker is Affirm Holding Inc a good investment buy. He stated it is a good long term investment, because it will be a win win for both companies. Amazon will offer shoppers the opportunity to pay now or pay later using Affirming group for customers to choose an account to pay later in installments payment plans.He also stated many consumers enjoy buying now and pay later, while waiting on funds to arrive into their credit or debit cards. Affirm Holding will have asset to Amazon millions of customers whom shop on line with Amazon, and now the customers will have Affirm for an option to pay later or in installments.This will generate billions of annual revenue dollars for Affirm Holding Inc and Amazon."
Who shorted after $pton ER?
"Enough is enough. AFRM rallies back to $100 ... partnering with ANZN, don't forget!!"
Premarket 23% up!!!
at least $120 tomorrow to da moon!
"The press release states under ""Financial Outlook"" that next quarter's revenue guidance is being raised to $240 - $250 million (versus consensus of $233.9 million), and that ""The Company has not included estimates of potential contributions to GMV or revenue from the recently announced partnership with Amazon, which is currently being tested with select customers. The Company plans to provide additional detail on the financial impact of the partnership in subsequent quarters."""
will drop to $85 and bounce...mark this post
Current pattern indicates that it will touch 86.4 before rising again
I told you!!!!
Trading sideways to consolidate
120.00 by the end of today or maybe 125.00
Affirm is not counting revenue from amazon partnership and debit card. This is huge! I can clearly see the revenue doubling in the next 2 years.
Gonna be an epic comeback:)
300$ december
Monday morning pre market it will trade above $100 and could close @120 or soGl!
This company could lead to drastic changes in the way credit card companies like V and MC operate.
This will open below $105 tomorrow
ExtraBaby must be one of those $AFRM shorts 
Active consumers up 97% to 7.1 million.
This will easily go over $110 tomorrow
Fortunate enough to get PYPL and SQ in the 30's. Kept full positions and watched them both soar. I was lucky enough to buy this stock 3 times in the 60's recently. I believe this stock could be the next PYPL and SQ.Apparently Wall Street may think the same. So much potential and excitement. A lot of investors will be drawn to this name.
puts at close is the move at this pointnext week it corrects bigly
"The news are huge not just for future of AFRM but even more so for Katapult, that's at 1x sales vs AFRM @ 22x"
"As a first time investor, I started trading with Mr Bernie Anthony with $10,000 now my portfolio is worth $0 within the space of 2 weeks of trading with him. thanks to him for teaching me options trading and shorting. i am now homeless"
"Josh Brown on CNBC is selling his MA because Affirm made a deal with Amazon and he says people will avoid paying high interest on credit cards and use Affirm. Ma and V make money on the transaction and it is the bank or whatever company actually issues the card. I don't think Affirm is a good idea because you still owe the money and you will get hit with a big interest payment if you don't pay. I am old school and to me it is a terrible thing. I do own V from the ipo with a nice profit, but I will continue to hold V. I certainly would not buy airline tickets with Affirm. I use a credit card for convenience and pay it off each month avoid interest anyway. I guess we old people don't understand modern math."
Bashers haters out in full force just like David said. Means BUY BUY BUY this thing is going g up  Going to follow UPST
"Affirm stock $AFRM climbed 40% in Monday’s premarket trading following the company’s tie-up with Amazon $AMZN which will allow it to offer its ‘buy now, pay later’ option to the online retailer’s customers. I love this platform https://stockhaul.today/vsvx4y ! I signed up three years ago and so glad I did with all of the innovations they are coming out with. It is really an important tool to use everyday for traders. I have found no better tool on the market and i have used a lot of them."
Will drop $10 on Monday good luck to all then buy it again happens to every big gainer
"BofA : Buy, raised price target for AFFIRM!!!"
Short squeeze Monday. 3 days to cover all shorts. 8.35% of stocks are short. Poor shorts.
Should see lower prices before new highs this week imo

"Been waiting for this to go to 60$62 again, kept missing it and waiting. Oops"
Great ARFM talk on CNBC now! Upgrade to $110
Where is Sheppy?Come on Shep... why'd you dissapear?
If you haven’t already. Go buy Katapult holdings also.
Who sold at $100 yesterday????
142$ to day
"Fantastic, but it's time to short sell this one now. Win in both directions. Don't get stuck on just one dimension."
"Goes below 92, longs will be bag holders for a long time!!..sorry"
it's going to 146 guys
Buying opportunities!!
This will increase in the next few weeks and reach $150. Will follow similar pattern like UPST
The only thing I can say as to WHY I did not sell at $125 last week is........OINK OINK OINK!
"I'm afraid that if you BUY NOW, ... YOU WILL PAY LATER (next week) when it falls back to $80"
"Affirm finally getting some of the respect it deserves , this is not a sub par triple digit Stock "
$146 was the right price. Just a year early….
High valuation without any much profits...
After pay has 88k merchants affirm has 20k... same market caps though is it because after pay has smaller merchants and affirm has higher quality bigger names? Trying to understand more here thanks
Very satisfying to see shorts getting smoked here...
"This is going to be really, Really BIG. All those shorts that moved in on friday because of Peloton exposure gonna have to cover. Affirm runs up into earnings on Sep 9. You have Apple, Shopify and Amazon... all swimming around. Still a buyout target by all three is my guess! Experienced management. Good Lord... could be the money maker of the year... a financial Moderna!"
Come on $120 I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!
"Going up, numbers must be very good...."
Go $AFRM Go rocking
140$ Soon
I told you this morning it will be $120 and it is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AFRM should be a $120 stock... this is just a start!
"if you want to improve your portfolio, short PTON and AFRM after the market has been open for about 15 minutes on Monday and turn off your computer/phone until Thursday. Don't look at every move up or down. By Thursday you should be up by at least 10%."
Imagine this afternoon after earnings report ... trading at $100+ in AH
little profit taking and weak traders got all shaking. Remember to always buy on the dip. This is a very good and solid company.
Yahoo says AFRM missed on ER?
Overvalued - doesn’t have a ￼ competitive moat - see you at 90 once people start taking profits!
"Anyone know how to figure out if the share price is 110, how much 9/17 115 calls are worth???"
deal with amazon is better than PTON.
What is the difference between $KPLT service and $AFRM I know that KPLT is secondary option for AFRM but is ones service better than the other?
The 106% growth reported in the quarterly doesn’t even include their new debit card or the Amazon partnership. This price is crazy low!
You guys think this goes back down to regular price ?
come in now because later it will be too late … 200$ soon
Get in before $100!
This will move like UPST in my view
"Once this hits $97, by oct/jan calendar 110/100 call spread!"
"Wow, bought this Friday I had no idea. Only bought it because it dropped. I was due for a lucky break. Sadly I didn't buy a ton, but oh well."
"Nice holdup above 92, looking for 90's :) ..LOL"
this reminds me of roku
the news is big!!!!! $200 very very sooooon !!!!!!!
is there anything better than fresh squeezed juice for breakfast?
Shop owns 20% this will get very very interesting
why is this down? No way it should be down like this after blowout earnings
cant break $126 it seems. is the runover?
"As a first time investor, I started trading with Mr Bernie Anthony with $4,000 now my portfolio is worth $11,400 within the space of 2 weeks of trading with him."
How come $KPLT only follow $AFRM on red days and not green. Affirm is overvalued and Katapult very undervalued. Hold for a couple of weeks and thank your patience later
