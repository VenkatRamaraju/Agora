Good day for ACB let’s enjoy. We don’t have very many of them lately.
"I’ve been watching ACB for 3 years . I’m a conspiracy theorist. What if the reason all of the Cannibas companies were pumped and dumped by People a lot smarter than us and now those companies that have survived will rise because they are truly closer to making a profit. I’m on the side that ACB will surprise to the upside and Lord help whoever is short of ACB posts an actual profit in their next earnings report. I’ll give you a hint , if ACB trades above 9.70 over the next 30 days (shorts positions will be toast ) good luck to all who are investing in ACB and not daytrading. You’re about to be rewarded. "
"ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh shut Hannibal you simply repeat the same old thing every day, everyone is tired of this nonsense of living day to day , hand to mouth, many of us are long term investors in this industry and are not fazed by the day to day swings because we see a long term future. Obviously you are not in this category and are hard up to live day to day, if you are frustrated I suggest you find other ways to vent your anger than agansit the stock or other people who may support it. We all can't be short if we were the economy will be in a depression and no company could rise money to support operations and jobs."

"Holding and more holding here, looking forward still to seeing that $50 cdn mark one day.  This is far from bankrupt, and far from over. Great price, maybe will see 4-5$ cdn by Oct, but I hope not. Long and strong here, 1-2 year hold!!"
"MedMen is in 6 states. They offer high grade products and offer their privately owned brands LuxLyte and MedMen Red. They are now fully in a delivery service, in store and curb side. MedMen Buds is an industry first loyalty program exclusive to MedMen. As of September 10, shares held by insiders sit at 29.31 of MedMens float which is huge! 18.49 of MedMen shares are held by institutions. I remember when this number was 0 for institutional investors and it wasn’t long ago. Tilray has taken a majority position in MedMen in convertible notes. Tilray has done this because they know they need brick and mortar in order to be successful and with these location and licenses that MedMen holds it’s worth a fortune. Tilray is going to use them to accelerate the path into the US Cannabis Market upon Federal Legalization which is very fast and approaching. The benefit to MedMen is that it completely reshaped their balance sheet and accelerated their growth.MedMen currently has 29 retail locations. The CEO Tom Lynch has plans to expand to over 65 retail locations. This company has 6 cultivation facilities.This company could go up very quickly over the coming days and weeks and it’s a great place to be if you have already bought in. September 23 is going to tell us the entire story. Lynch the CEO will give a clear perspective on where he sees us going from here. I believe that after earnings which should kill street expectations as we were almost completely closed down last year due to COVID will become quite a sales increase coming. Clear outline of where the money will be spent going forward!I love making money and helping others to win! GLTA to all MedMen shareholders!! This industry is set to take off. $TLRY $FAF.TO $ACB $WEED $AMRS $CURA $CRON $GRWG $YOLO $CNBS $MJ $POTX"

"The ACB chart has 'buy, buy, buy.."" all over it.There is an 'engulfing candle' on the daily chart. Engulfing candles are %63 accurate.This means that tomorrow ACB will probably (63%) open a little higher than today, but my strategy for the next session tomorrow is to buy on the intraday dip.I haven't bought anything yet. I will wait till tomorrow!! ..i already waited for 6 days now, since closing my last ACB position.. so 1 day won't make a difference to me, i have the patience."

Or can Canadian join in the lawsuit that's in the United States. I have been with Aurora since 2017. I could not figure out why the 12 to 1 reverse split this makes sense. If anyone out there can answer my questions I would appreciate it. Thank you
