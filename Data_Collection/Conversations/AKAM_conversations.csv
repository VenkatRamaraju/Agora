I cant wait to trade this again! i hold a core amount of shares and buy and sell on price fluctuations. it will end up moving again. If you own this buy more in the 90s!
This is typical behavior for the Akamai stock price. It usually goes up before its earnings report. Then posts excellent earnings. Initially it then goes down because some are not convinced the earnings are truly spectacular. Then it slowly begins to rise again as it gets upgraded by the big brokerage houses.
"what is going on with Akamai after such superior earnings. Any constructive explanation? This stock should much higher now, not falling every day."
Still a solid company. Great opportunity to buy in at this price. Just look at Fastly valuation
why Akamai company always follows with a disastrous conferences after great results - this is a 20-year history of this stock - stop and go.... this stock should be $300 by now... looking forward to a rebound - but is has been frustrating...
Heard the earnings call. It was very positive. Upgrades with follow.
"boring oscillation between 95 and 105. What is wrong with the great company? Very reserved, boring CEO - can someone after 20 years replace him."
"Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ: AKAM) reported Q4 EPS of $1.07, $0.07 better than the analyst estimate of $1.00. Revenue for the quarter came in at $713 million versus the consensus estimate of $703.9 million."
"Akamai Technologies AKAM is set to report fourth-quarter 2020 results on Feb 9. For the fourth quarter, Akamai Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $830.5 million, which indicates a rise of 7.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Non-GAAP earnings are expected in the range of $1.28-$1.32 per share. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.32, which reflects year-over-year growth of 7.3%. Notably, the company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.2%, on average."
talking about predictable behavior of Akam stock price due to yet another quarterly awkward PR despite great earning. it is a buying opportunity for those who plan to stal long.
"what is needed this make this stock to stop being sooo boring. Great company, great technology, and a very boring flat stock. Maybe Akamai suffers from a brilliant but infinitely boring CEO..."
Well we didn't rise with the high flying tech stocks but we sure can fall with the best of them.
Look at it fold. It’s a complete joke. AKAM is dead money!
"Akamai is the leader in cyber security. Formerly many companies thought this was a luxury they couldn't afford. Given the recent attacks, including the shutting down of the oil pipeline to the East Coast, it is now imperative to have the best security possible. Instead of being a luxury, cyber security becomes a necessity."
"I wrote this 2 weeks ago: Note to self: This has been so dead in the water especially compared to every other decent cloud, chip, tech stock. Why? I can't make out the waves of momentum interest as they move from one stock to another. I have Cloudera and Micron and they just all of a sudden took off. I've traded AKAM a couple times but the last time I bought it (June), it hasn't gone anywhere. I bought it at 99 with a target of 120. So now I'm thinking I should double down because it's ""due"" to have a big run!? Does that seem like sound investing strategy? :)"
Has ever Akamai moved up after great results. We can always counts on post learning statements from the company to crash the stock.. predictable and annoying
"A lot of big boys sold in the past few days because of ER worries as well as the overall market conditions. With Apple rising, the markets will rise tomorrow and all the big boys will come back to AKAM. After market activity wont matter as much. Please like this post and reply. I will be happy to hear your comments."
Was Akam represented at the cybersecurity meeting today at the White house?
"""Akamai Technologies (AKAM) reported first-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street targets despite the coronavirus emergency. While Akamai earnings topped views, shares fell in extended trading amid high expectations.Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai stock fell nearly 5% to 96.75 in extended trading on the stock market today. Akamai stock has rallied on views that traffic volume on its content delivery network has jumped as stay-at-home consumers engage in more video streaming.Akamai earnings rose 9% to $1.20 an adjusted share, the company said. The internet infrastructure provider's revenue climbed 8% to $764 million.""what is the logic for the stock falling when it has posted better than expected result. Can anybody decode the above ""explanation""?"
CFRA rates AKAM after earnings report a buy with a target price of $125. Says future shows major upside in growth.Stay long and strong. Going much higher.
Wish someone would short squeeze this one after announcement .. it’s so predictable you can set the time..
"A lot of stocks get sold off after earnings, even though a beat on all metrics. I think there was some bigger forecast capital expenditures than expected, but that is just the traffic demand on the network. I added to it at $94 as I still like the long term growth trends in connecting the internet traffic."
Guidance cut is minimal vs. the potential growth of AKAM. Invest long with AKAM.
It's a buy !
"who is manipulating Akamai stock? There is no bad news, why the stock is down? Serious answers are welcome, not SPAM and ""Satnam""."
"Always drops after beat earnings and then goes back up. Rinse and repeat. Never understand it. Outstanding numbers to be honest.Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.31 per share, $0.08 better than Consensus of $1.23; revenues rose 11.7% year/year to $793 mln vs the $775.16 mln Consensus. Web Division revenue was $418 million, up 8% year-over-year and up 7% when adjusted for foreign exchange.Media and Carrier Division revenue was $375 million, up 16% year-over-year and when adjusted for foreign exchange.Cloud Security Solutions revenue was $266 million, up 23% year-over-year and when adjusted for foreign exchange.Revenue from Internet Platform Customers was $51 million, up 15% year-over-year and when adjusted for foreign exchange."
Total manipulation.. See the volume... They did the same for PFE... It went up 50% in a month or so....:) This has been purposefully kept down for whatever reason......Such a high quality stock... All it's peers are up more than 100% in the past year... This has hardly moved.... Time for a big uptick.
"CC/Q1:""With the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.18 to $1.24 or up 14% to 20% in constant currency. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of approximately $34 million to $36 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 15%. And it also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares."""
"Well, about 9 months ago I urged all on this board to get out and make gains in other places in the market. Now I am back and am looking to buy back into AKAM. This is a solid company that held up during the worst market conditions of Covid. I will be buying over the next month or so and I would recommend you all add as well. GL, B"
I don't understand a 7% pullback .... anyone else confused?
CEO bought another $1 million in stock yesterday on the open market. He thinks the stock is going higher. Who would know better............
"This stock should pay a dividend because it does nothing. Buy at 94, sell a few months later and repeat. Will never break out…"
great future prospects in an absolute growth market and still moderately rated .. it looks like Akamai is flying under the radar of many investors
Seem like a big beat (793 rev non-gap earnings 251 million) but down after hours as usual.
We are now firmly above the 200 day on the chart. We should get to $80 on this move. Then will it be a double top or breakout?
"Can't believe AKAM tanks like it is a recession even after a good earnings report. Like someone here said, wallstreet is a fashion show. The more you show off, the higher your stock price will be. no matter how deep your business is in trouble."
Very good margins and yet an under appreciated stock. It’s time for this one to soar!
Buy the DIP here. This company is gold specially in today's time with 5G and cloud security. Undervalued
"Many employee has started to work at home , this is good for AKAM"
This company has gained $5 in one year! Security is thus proven unimportant.
