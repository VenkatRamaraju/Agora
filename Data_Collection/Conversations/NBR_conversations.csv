"I responded to a posting about the conversion rate of the preferred earlier with a link...it appears yahoo didn't like it and removed the post....so I will try a different way to post the info.Nabors Industries Ltd | 6.00% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares, Series A (NBR.PRA)Prospectus excerpt: We are offering 5,000,000 of our 6.00% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares, Series A, with a liquidation preference of $50 per share (our ""series A preferred shares""). We will pay cumulative dividends on each of our series A preferred shares at a rate of 6.00% per annum of the initial liquidation preference of $50 per share. Dividends will accumulate from the first date of original issuance and, to the extent that we have lawfully available funds to pay dividends and our board of directors declares a dividend payable, we will pay dividends on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 of each year in cash, our common shares, par value $0.001 per share (our ""common shares""), or a combination thereof, at our election and subject to certain limitations. The first dividend payment, if declared, will be made on August 1, 2018, in the expected amount of $0.64 per series A preferred share, which will reflect the time period from the expected first date of original issuance to August 1, 2018. Each of our series A preferred shares will automatically convert on the second business day immediately following the end of the final averaging period (as defined below) into between 5.3763 and 6.4516 of our common shares (respectively, the ""minimum conversion rate"" and ""maximum conversion rate""), each subject to adjustment, depending on the average VWAP (as defined herein) of our common shares over the 20 trading day period beginning on, and including, the 21st scheduled trading day prior to May 1, 2021, which we refer to herein as the ""final averaging period."" At any time prior to May 1, 2021, a holder of series A preferred shares may convert such series A preferred shares into our common shares at the minimum conversion rate, subject to adjustment, but such holder will not be entitled to accumulated and unpaid dividends for the then-current dividend period. During a specified period in connection with a fundamental change (as defined herein), a holder of series A preferred shares may convert such series A preferred shares into our common shares at the applicable fundamental change conversion rate (as defined herein). Upon the occurrence of a tax event (as defined herein), we may, at our option, cause all, but not less than all, of the series A preferred shares to be converted into our common shares at an increased conversion rate (determined as described herein)."
Why is NBR paying out a dividend if they are 6 years in a row with 0 earnings?!Literally in 2016 they started having negative profit margins!
"All - look at the bright side...the stock is trading flat today on low volume and on a day that crude took a hit. The sellers and buyers are tired here. Further, it's Friday and options expiration. The mere fact that we're not having a low volume sell off with the decline in oil is a positive I'll take any day."
"Oil prices were up on Wednesday after the Energy Information Administration reported that inventories of oil and gas declined in the most recent week, a sign that demand is outpacing supply in the country.Oil inventories fell by 4.5 million barrels, more than expectations for a 3.2-million-barrel draw. Oil remains in a precarious spot—demand..."
"The recent bond offering refinances the debt due in the next few years, giving NBR significant breathing room. With trouble brewing in the Middle East, there is certainly a distinct possibility that disruptions in the supply from that region could spur a resurgence in drilling and exploration in the USA and other areas where Nabors is active. On the downside, Nabors activities in that area could also be affected, and the interest rate on the new bonds is higher than the bonds being retired. Still, overall, the debt being refinanced and the term being extended is definitely good news. I doubt that Iran will stop in their quest for revenge with the recent missile launch, and the swoon in today's oil price is likely relief that the response wasn't more intense. Make no mistake, I hope for lasting peace, but Iran is not known for restraint."
"I’m anticipating a suspension of the dividend, followed by a rev split then 10 years to build back up to at least ten bucks a share, anybody else have an idea, hate to say it being a long but now it looks very hopeless"
"NBR was up over $6 yesterday a little pullback is normal, just a buying opportunity for people that understand the value and of a share of a company this size. NBR is the biggest COVID-19 play on the planet, it's bigger than any, plane, boat, or car play because it is an American global oil and gas drilling contractor based and headquartered in Houston, Texas. Nabors owns the largest land drilling fleet in the world with approximately 400 rigs in more than 20 countries. The company consists of the following business segments: U.S. Drilling, Canada Drilling, International Drilling, Drilling Solutions, and Rig Technologies. NBR's did around April 20th a 50 for one reverse split and has yet to be corrected for that correction. There is a huge profit yet to be made."
"volume, volume and volume telling us Institutional buying........."
"Unless the yearly header from '15 thru '18 are backwards on the balance sheet, cash and assets are improving and liabilities are down. Company has been around since the 1950's and has been through rougher times. If you're looking for a return to +4 anytime soon, don't hold your breath. Spikes to the upper 2's in the coming 3-4 weeks is realistic with retraces back to sub 2. Would be surprised to see this head into BK within 10 years."
be patient the big surges in NBR is still on the horizonwhen it comes it will take this over $3 plus before end of Januaryboth the macros and upcoming expected update on NBR 2019 budgets and forward guidance will sent this soaring in upcoming future - once the profit taking is over - the next phase of the surge up will begin
"Nine days ago I posted my thoughts as to how I see things shaking out over the next year or so. Rather than regurgitate why debt levels are not a near term issue, please see my previous post as to why. Rig counts continue to decline and will continue to do so given today's inventory numbers showed levels are twice as high as analysts' previous forecasts. Near term, I think that drives us lower. In the upcoming NBR call, I expect more positive news regarding debt reductions. Despite that news, I believe management is going to issue disappointing guidance based on the continued rig count reductions facing the entire industry. Those comments likely drive us to a new low. From there I think we start to rise. For reasons I articulated nine days ago. However, I do believe we are in fact going lower, until we get an update from management. Something to the effect of an international surprise that's buffering us better than peers who only have US exposure. I sold my 'trading shares' yesterday when OPEC announced it might cut production in December. Until we get trade deal certainty, or a major supply disruption, it's going to be a rough month. Also keep in mind, once November starts, we will face continued selling pressure as many will unload underperforming shares for tax losses. Which is yet another reason why I don't see us making any meaningful movement higher until the end of December. For those of us with long term losses, maybe Christmas will usher in that rebound. Until then, Nabors is just a gamble or trade."
Will NBR beat the estimates?
"as I wait for earnings, I will go out on the limb and predict a bad report because oil was down Oct. through much of Dec. It will have nothing to do with the health of the company. Tomorrow could be a great day to buy. This will be the last $.06/share dividend and things in the oil patch are picking up. A good swing trade just my opinion."
"As I stated a week ago, breaking through resistance. Volume over the past month is validating move. Overall trend for the next 6 months bodes well for NBR’s move to mid-teens."
"FYI - Houston-based drilling co. files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, moves to OTC market."
Can anyone explain the math for this: The preferred shares are mandatorily convertible on 5/1/2021 into a variable number of Nabors Industries Ltd. (NYSE: NBR) common shares based on the then current price of the common shares for 20 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the conversion date. The conversion settlement rate will be 5.3763 shares per unit if the then current market price is equal to or greater than $9.30 and 6.4516 shares per unit if the market price is equal to or less than $7.75.
tech migration into energy will be real - the value is in energy stocks like NBR - the mkt will respond and push NBR to $4 before end of 1st qtr 2019 this year $3 before end of Jan
"Conference call was optimistic in tone. I was glad to hear the $94 million from sale of Canadian assets would be largely earmarked for further debt reduction. I suspected that the warrants were intended as a means to reduce the credit revolver, and it will be interesting to see how this plays out. They did say it was a mechanism to convert outstanding debt into equity without being dilutive, but this anticipates a much higher price in the future, at least for a cash transaction. A much higher price would be way OK with me.Comparing the conference presentation from Q 2 to the one from Q 1, it shows a reduction of $75 million in the revolver, $1 million in the notes due 2023, and $4 million in the notes due this year. I anticipate we see the 2021 $82 million disappear soon, using the proceeds from the sale of Canadian assets. That will save almost $.95 million each quarter all by itself, though we won't see that until the notes are actually extinguished. The debt payments made in Q 2 should translate into another approx. $.67 million savings on interest. So maybe $1.57 million by Q 4?With near $175 million in depreciation and amortization being charged off per (this) quarter, Nabors won't be GAAP bottom line in the black for some time, but the $1.4 billion in debt reduction since Q 1, 2018 is a great step in the right direction. Especially if the interest saved is used to reduce debt further."
ie inorder for Kotts the Nabors director to make money on the Nabors stock options he paid for on December 31 2018 - the share price of Nabors has to surpass $2.85 cents per share or he will lose money on his Nabors stock optionsthis is why I said Nabors share price will surpass $3 this month minimumthere is data behind what I say - shorts always get punished severely when I am an owner of the company's sharesI mean business with my holdings
"With oil steadily increasing per barrel over the 4th quarter I expect NBR to beat estimates yet again when reported around February 6. Of course, with such a small float and 80% owned by institutions and insiders this stock only continues to go up as world wide travel stair steps upward."
NBR 2020 bonds are still trading above $100. The credit market is not seeing bankruptcy for NBR.
Pretty soon Petrello's house in the Hamptons will be worth more than Nabors' entire market cap.
"once the herd changes direction , the stampede up will be significantI expect plenty of good news for NBR coming this month plenty IMHO"
"whether or not it repeats the previous 4 ex div dates remains to be seen. the previous 4, the stock surged and closed significantly higher (as it did a 5th time yesterday), and 1 day later it went slightly higher for the day high, but closed near even or lower. played it safe and unloaded my 35K shares yesterday at 2.37 (cost avg 1.98)."
"It's amazing that that such a poor-performing company like Nabors (with a current market cap below $1 billion) is paying their CEO close to $5 million a year. Considering how badly the company has performed with Anthony Petrello at the helm, they should consider a new CEO. Even William Restrepo would do a better job."
Oil 75 dollars today
Does anybody knows why NBR is a non standard stock and needs to be trades with manual orders? in my broker I cannot place an order unless I call the broker by phone….a headache.
Mark this post. The fact that they cut the dividend will mark a bottom for this stock. I have 2000 shares at 3.77 was waiting for the cut before I buy more. Tomorrow morning I’ll buy another 2000 shares and wait to sell at $8 by mid year. Bringing down their dead is much more important than paying a dividend. They did the right thing for everyone.
Did anybody get the NBR warrants yesterday?
"NBR shares are disconnected with the bonds. The last time NBR shares were this low in December 2018, the bonds were 10 points lower! the bond market is not that worried."
"the key to share price appreciation is improved cash flow and debt reduction - that is what they are doing , hedge funds will buy this for the share price appreciation and not for dividends ie if share price appreciation is important and not dividends this is the stock to own, the road to share price appreciation was this news releaseie you cant have major share price appreciation and high dividendsas you can see they paid a lot of debt off in the 4th quarter of this year to be released in Feboil is shooting over $50 againCHina deal will spur more oil price rise and more drilling ahead as the trade wars held back increased expansions in 2020 - ie no effects on 2019 business per releasethe markets, oil and NBR will be flying up soon IMHO"
It looks like current bid $16.5 is the time value of the warrant. There is a market for it and we have people who are wiling to own this warrant for a potential gain of selling NBR at or above $167+16=$183 within the next 5 years . Good luck trading/investing .
We are bouncing around a bunch pre-market. Now we are back to $2.63.
IMHO when the massive China trade issues gets resolved in about a week or significant progress takes place oil will rocket up and NBR will rocket up even more and the herd will pile back into NBR like it never has in a long time NBR has the $3 magnet waiting to pull it thru this month
"I can't blame anyone for trading in and out of NBR during this time frame with the wild price swings we have seen since the oil crash caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, but I do believe that the long term outlook has promise for large returns. During the 2nd quarter, despite the crash, Nabors reduced their net debt by $117 million, and they have only $139 million due in 2020, with $154 million due in 2021. They were wise, or perhaps merely fortunate, to have rolled a large portion of their debt due in those years to 2026 and 2028. It would therefore appear that the debt load is manageable for the next 2 1/2 years. That is a long time in the oil world for the price to remain depressed, unless you assume that the pandemic continues to wreck the economy or that a potential Biden/Harris administration will destroy the economy or more specifically, the fossil fuel industry. When oil comes back, and I believe it will, NBR will be a good stock to own. I think the price now is attractive compared to historical norms, but that premise is based on a recovery of demand in the next 2 years. As several of oil drillers were caught in even less favorable circumstances when the oil crash occurred, there will likely be even less competition when and if the recovery happens."
"I have a difficult time listening to someone ""BRAG"" about riding a stock/security down from the 30.00 area to a 1.50?Credibility obviously an issue here with this character.He still wants to give advice and be heard?"
What’s the most expected during the coming earning?? Up or down? Can’t wait to see this stock reach pre-covid value..
Sector rotation definitely happening. Energy’s in play. Big Institutional accumulation.
"CFO William Restrepo bought 177,100 shares at $2.03 on June 14th. If the CFO is buying, the company's probably not going bankrupt! He owns 2.2 million shares."
"ItsJustMyOpinionI'm not surprised you lost money in Nabors. You apparently think it is time to sell when the price is low, and buy when the price is high. You also don't seem to understand that a company can be making money while taking advantage of allowed depreciation to show an accounting loss. It is that free cash flow that is being used to pay down the debt. Every $50 million of debt retired is like another rig being put to work at current margin for more than a year, each and every year. And Nabors is paying off that much and more each and every quarter."
just wait for the company news on favorable 2019 business prospects going forwards IMHOthen China trade progress newsthen significant trend up in oil prices aheadthen massive herd buying in NBR sending NBR back to fair value ie price to cashfllows
What a rally so far!! Hard to keep holding until my target: 120.... hope earning will help boost even more!!
"I'm not good at math, but looking at my measly 1300 shares,with a 1:15 split my 1,300 shares will be 67 shares worth roughly $6.67 per share at today's price. then they are going to dilute that to $3.35 share. my investment will be worth 1/2 of what it s worth today."
Told you guys yesterday. The low is in. Additional crude draws in Sept will prop the price. Just need Trump to stay off Twitter
"It will be very interesting to see how much additional debt has been paid off during Q 3 above and beyond the $82 million that remained of the 2021 debt. During the Q 2 earnings call, Petrello said it was unlikely there would be news forthcoming regarding the revolving credit line until at least Q 4, so I don't think there is a likely boost in share price due to news on that issue, but Q 3 couldn't have gone much better for Nabors (IMHO). The price of oil remained strong and the weekly rig counts have showed steady improvement. How much of the new drilling business went to Nabors remains to be seen, but I think it is reasonable that they got their share, so I wouldn't be surprised to hear the Q 3 EBITDA exceeds expectations. I think that a big catalyst for share price improvement will come in Q 4 when and if Nabors gives more clarity on how they will manage the revolving credit line. Currently the market seems to be bullish on oil prices for the near term, and if the price of oil holds at or above current levels for another quarter, investors in NBR should be rewarded."
Down -15% in 2 days when oil is above $62 and rising? What is going on? This doesn't make sense.
"Upgrade to ""outperform"" from Wells Fargo."
NBR is going to $10 a share once the quarterly report comes out because of all the new work in Saudi Arabia. Not to mention they're strong presence in the permian basin. Is going to be big time cash flow Increase in 2019. imho.
There's no gambling involved when the company owns 20% of the worldwide active rig fleets. imho.
Winter is right around the corner more oil consumption prices go up the stock will go up
"Another question would be, if you sell now would it be considered short term gain and taxed accordingly?"
"So with Preferred share conversion, How many share will we get? It was reverse split 1 to 50 back in March, original conversion was 1 to 5. Does this mean we're reversing into 1 to 10 share? This doesn't make sense."
"I'm new to all this, but I myself work out here in west Texas, there's plenty of X-rigs out here, made a small investment, just hoping for the best."
I'm still long term on new stock... even more so now that I hear that the company has so much confidence they are coming out with this pre financial statement announcement.
"I covered my short positions today. I took a considerable loss, but I’m impressed by the strategy this company used to inflate its stock and to squeeze me out. We know shorting is dangerous, but we live in capitalistic America. Cover the shorts now or be forever squeezed :)"
"We anticipate having ample liquidity to meet our upcoming obligations. Our cash balances closed the quarter at $484 million, and availability on our credit facility stood at $440 million. Remaining balances on our senior notes due in 2020 and 2021 now stand at $139 million and $154 million, respectively. Our credit facility, a key component of our available liquidity includes various covenants.Capital expenses in the second quarter of $49 million were $11 million lower than the prior quarter. Our capex target for 2020 remains at $240 million. Our solid cash flow generation is a result of swift and meaningful actions taken to mitigate the impact of the current downturn. We now expect our actions on overhead, capital discipline, and dividends to exceed $220 million for the final three quarters of 2020, somewhat higher than our initial target."
Does anyone know the formula for the conversion when it takes place on 5-22-2021? Schwab has the ratio 5.37563shares of common for every preferred share. sounds too good to be trueand you know what they say. I would appreciate the real story before I pull the trigger.Thank you all!
Am back in my normal position swing trading this. Never catch the bottom but I’m patient and made more money out of trading NBR this year than any other stock.
"Some are unable to do simple math. 'ItsJustMyOpinion' is one of those people. If you don't understand the difference between cash losses and depreciation, just admit it and move on. No one will miss you."
"Baker Hughes Rig Count shows another 5 rigs added this week. Slow but steady recovery happening. More and more positive stories being published talking about chances for higher oil. Also getting near year end, and new fiscal plans will likely be drawn up with capex for drilling included. Q 3 results later this month may really provide a boost if there is an upside surprise, and nothing that has happened in the last month or so gives me much indication that doom is on the way."
Volume is pretty good today..maybe this is the real thing.
Thanks for reaching out . I will be waiting for your input after you review your spreadsheets. They are definitely trying to reduce the debt but the my question has always been are they really doing everything possible in that effort when oil is relatively trading at a high level. We all know good days don’t last forever. They should not leave any stones unturned while the energy markets support it . I am a little nervous . The speed at which they are biting the debt is questionable. I think .
"NBR was up 9.5% two days ago, 6.7% yesterday while the other stocks struggled. NBR just taking a breather...institutions trying to get in cheap...bet NBR is at 2.42 or 2.43 by close today. imho."
"Another unfortunate day to be in Nabors. Not a good week for longs. But Nabors is not likely to go bk any time soon. Drilling continues at a much slower pace, but when the economy improves, so will the price of oil. The wells will need to be drilled, and Nabors will still be around to do the work. The debt load is manageable out through the end of 2022, and there will be another bump in the price of oil as the pandemic recedes and the economy improves. It is going to be a tough, slow slog through the mud to get to the other side."
Greetings to all the people whoHaven't posted on here all year as the stock fell and suddenly come out of the cave to post
"If this is not back above $3 by we, I’ll be buying more. I have vesting coming out on Thursday!"
"US oil reserves are shrinking and a good time to catch the bottom on this stock.U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 7.37 million barrels for a second weekly decline through July 31, the Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey had forecast a decrease of 3.35 million"
Hard to believe this stock is at 2 bucks ... bought a few thousand more at 2.03 ....My guess is its a gift - and we'll gap up Monday on a psychology swing and won't look back .. but.Two possible scenarios that I can imagine is driving prices ;a) NBR has large mutual fund ownership - and with the current price - some funds are forbidden by Bylaws to hold stock less than x dollars per share ... if this is the case then 2 bucks is a gift ...b) Some large share holder knows something that the rest of us don't - in which case we're f-dd ..Balance sheet isn't that bad ...5.5 billion property and equipment ...4.7 billion total liabilities ..Plus why would the company be buying back debt - and bonds holding strong - if there were cash flow issues ?Thought they stated that case flows were improving ...
Volume is way up today........institutions and hedge funds buying today.......volume already at 11.5 million shares.......
Expect green with high volume today
Gene Isenberg took Nabors out of bankruptcy 30 or so years ago + Tony Petrello might put it back there. NBR market cap is now only $525 million. I wouldn't be surprised if Tony's collected more than that ($525 million) in compensation during his career at Nabors.
With the conversion of .1372 I calculate NBR-A value is about $15. Per share with NBR at $100.This driving the preferred

"30 of the .36 loss per share was impairments and an income tax on a reserve in Canada, also loss was 13M compared to 25M in Q4 of last year. AND last quarter is was .56 a share.Given a somewhat rocky environment in oil and gas in Q1, I’d say NBR is progressing quite well"
Crash thought you were gonna stay away for awhile ?
"Crash sold out near the lows and then went short at $2.25, he is now trying to auction his house and sell his car."
"Dividend announced""On July 27, 2018, the Board of Directors of Nabors Industries Ltd. declared cash dividends of (i) $0.06 per outstanding Common Share, par value $0.001 per share, which will be paid on October 2, 2018, to holders of record at the close of business on September 11, 2018, and (ii) $0.75 per outstanding share of our 6.00% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares, Series A, par value $0.001 per share, which will be paid on November 1, 2018, to holders of record at the close of business on October 15, 2018"""
"Looking very attractive as a tack on acquisition target for a big player that wants to vertically integrate. Someone will step in and buy this outfit, it's too cheap to ignore. Possibly $9-$11 takeover bid."
"Today dr was planned by short sellers because of the huge price increase by NBR and also profit-taking. Friday would be short covering and bottom fishing by buyers, we will see MIn. $48-49 price range."
"Had a good run. Due for a breather, before starting back upwards again. As cities reopen and travel picks up, oil demand will increase substantially. IMO this stock is $85-$100 by Jan 31. The float is tiny and roughly 80% is owned by institutions and insiders. This one has a good chance to break $200 by the end of summer 2021. Long."
"I am with mike - looking to get back in - but will wait post earnings - best caseis a pop, then drop, worst case - opens sub $3. Look at RIG, different set-upbut it tends to set the mood."
Very resilient today closing where it did. Optimistic this will continue trending upward.
"This is very undervalued. The company isn't going bankrupt, the 2020 bonds are at 99.70. The CFO bought $350K in July when the shares were $2.03. There's really no reason for the shares to be down here. The earnings call was positive and there hasn't been any major change since 2 weeks ago, when the shares were $3. Just energy stocks are out of favor for now. They've gotten cheaper for the same price of oil. NBR has been $5-6 with oil at this level within the past year."
"It reads $12 value right now as the last price. Can I just simply sell my ,800 newly assigned warrant shares and receive the $9600 proceeds ?"
"Our position in our served markets and the value proposition we bring to those markets are first-rate. We are confident we hold the advantage as the industry emerges from the downturn. The leadership position in drilling requires best-in-class rig designs, industry-leading safety and operating performance, and advanced technology. Nabors began its commitment to technology leadership years ago."
37 days ago the stock was worth 21 cents a share. Today it's worth 76 cents a share (pre-reverse split pricing). What's changed for the company or in the macro environment that it's worth 3.5 times as much five weeks later? Really!
"While Nabors is racking up a dismal record of quarter over quarter GAAP losses, I think it is important to consider the positive EBIDTA, the very real progress made toward debt reduction, the pickup in drilling activity that accompanies the rise in oil prices, the projected increase in rig count coming online from the SANAD JV, and the steady, but slow recovery in rig count utilization in the lower 48. It think it is far too premature to predict a Chesapeake-like scenario for Nabors. I also believe next quarter, when the $82 million 2021 notes have been retired, there will be positive uptick in share price. If Nabors retains a disciplined approach to debt reduction, as it has the past few years, it will be far easier to negotiate a new revolving credit facility at less onerous terms than is currently required by the bond market. I don't think Nabors is bleeding money; rather Nabors is slowly plugging the leak."
Crash is a wolf(short) in sheep's(long) clothing enough said my opinion.
"The precipitous drop is overdone today. While oil is down $1.53, it is still at $77.40. You have to go back to Nov. 2014 to find higher. NBR was over $800 then, with a higher debt load. I think more rigs will be going back to work in Q 4 with oil over $70, and a lot more rigs will be working if oil stays mostly over $75. I'm looking forward to the earnings release and conference call later this month. I am cautiously optimistic."
"Quite Crash, yeah...kind of stunned as I was expecting some better news but I continue to hope the debt reduction and cost cutting will bring this company to brighter days ahead. I have no choice but to hold fast and stay long given my cost basis. All the Bk talk will never force my hand in selling out, rest assured. Good luck to all. We’re all here to make money, regardless of what side of the fence you’re on."
I don't see very much risk at all with holding this stock long term. They're almost like food products. We have to have oil and we have to have food. Also they are a major player in the oil industry like General Foods is a major in the food indusry... I guess what I'm saying is that the company is going to be around for a long time. imho.
Book value per share is $220. Current share price $17. Do the math.
The dividend is likely gone until this company gets bak on its feet.My opinion is that its future is largely tied to the health of the crude oil market.A long term chart offers good perspective.https://www.mrci.com/pdf/cl.pdfTo me the chart shows sub 40 dollar prices to be unlikely - unless you think the whole market will crash. Which I don't think is in the cards.We are close to 50 now - if you draw a channel off the 2014/2015 highs and lows - that will likely contain crude oil prices over the at least the mid term - if not longer term. It's an uptrending channel and we are probably no more than a few dollars off the support line which - in my opinion - makes this a pretty timely entry point.This company has been around quite while and I don't think it is going out of business - unless of course the oil market crashes - in which case it is certainly vulnerable. I remember when my dad used to trade this when it was Anglo Energy. Used to call it his Angel ... picked up 2200 shares this morning at 2.27 and expect to do quite well with it.My opinion ... all the best !
"This is an extract from BAML research report June 18, 2018Nabors Industries (NBR)Our PO of $12 is based on 7.25x on 2019E, which is near the average of its historical range of 4-12x. We believe NBR should trade in line with its historical average given a more normal environment in 2019E.Risks to our price objective are (1) further deterioration in onshore drilling activity in the U.S., (2) oil price weakness hurting sentiment and E&P capex budgets, (3) market share loss, (4) operational challenges, (5) liquidity risk/access to credit/equity markets, (6) risk to paying its dividend should recovery be delayed, and (7) political/regulatory challenges in geographies where it operates."
"We really won't know the impact until tomorrow AM, my guess is some initialweakness that will be bought all day, investors don't like to hear aboutdividend cuts, usually means Mgt lacks confidence in the financial strengthof the company, also paying down debt is not necessarily favored - alsoshows Mgt thinks the company is way too levered. But all that is more than priced into the stock when it declined from $5 - $6 to $2. But the issue of BKis resolved for now - not going to happen. I think we have reached aturning point - the bottom is in - now slow but steady progress on the upside."
I left out the best part. The preferred A share pays like clockwork. Highest dividend on the market. Only $5 ish to grab a .75 quarterly dividend. It will convert next May so you get 2.25 per share between now and then... and you’re paying $5 for the share right now. Best deal around right now.
Cash flow snalysus shows a current stock value of over $4 a share.
if the Directors of Nabors waives their cash payments and instead opts to purchase stock options in NBR on the day they would have received their cash payments - obviously it means the Director believes in the future on Nabors and he will make a killing on the Nabors stock options insteadYes I also pressured mgmt. to start buying shares of Nabors as well in my last communication with themthey are following thruNabors - rebound stock of 2019 IMHO
"the only reason a company issues early 4th quarter highlight results is WHEN THE RESULTS are GOOD:Nabors fourth quarter financials are not yet finalized. The company does not intend for the above metrics to be taken as an indication of GAAP financial results for the fourth quarter. They are only intended to provide investors with advance information on Nabors' financial position, given investors' level of interest on that specific issue. Nabors will release its full financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 in late February.Mr. Restrepo commented, ""As anticipated, fourth quarter cash flow generation allowed us to reduce our net debt significantly.Less"
A winner is a winner. Imagine when all 17 analysts start upgrading it and increase their PT ?
Temporary negative sentiment on oil is allowing for some fantastic deals across the sector right now. Consumption will increase as the world continues to open up. Revenues will grow in parallel with demand and oil prices. The worlds Oil demand isn’t going away... just sentiment fir the moment.
"Gene Isenberg would be so disappointed of how Nabors has performed under Tony Petrello's leadership:Shares of the Bermuda-based oil and gas wells drilling operator have fallen by 68% in the past year, 94% in the past three years and 96% in the past five years through Oct. 5. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 index by 83.5%, 127.7% and 165.2%, respectively."
"If oil fluctuates between $50 and $55 during 2019, what would it be a fair price for nbr?"
"Does anyone know what happened back in June that caused the uptick to $80+ per share? I had got in at $32 and made a nice chunk on the rise. I'm back in the game at $25 this morning and started to see it gain momentum with the earnings call coming in 2 weeks. -- They have businesses in all three (up, down, mid stream) so I can see them benefitting where other o&g may not. Interested to see if anyone knows why the uptick and if they agree with a future uptick in the coming weeks. -- sidenote: why do their options have special margin requirements?"
"Assuming no major worsening of the oil market (a huge if!), I think it is quite likely that Nabors pays off the 2021 notes (due 9/15/2021), and the 2023 notes, along with a very large chunk of the revolving credit line (maybe $480 million?) unless they can get a new credit facility negotiated. The revolver doesn't expire until 10/11/2023 (AFAIK), so that Nabors has around 9 quarters to pay down debt. The revolver is bumping up against the 5.5 EBITDA limit right now, so presumable that is why we saw the decrease in the (cheaper) revolver debt as opposed to a drawdown of the 2023 notes."
"THINK! You're an awesome guy who deserves what is coming your way now. Just my opinion of course, not financial advice."
I wonder what the chances NBR's earnings will be better than expected this time? I have gotten used to earnings always being disappointing for this company. The share price seems to be pricing this in. Maybe there will be a positive surprise for a change.
NBR is trending up from now till earning report.
"You are mistaking book keeping entries for cash flow, IJMO. Positive cash flow, and paying off debt is far from living off borrowed money. There is a large debt, to be sure, but you are omitting the fact that $740 million in net debt was paid off in the last 8 quarters. Each successive debt repayment makes it easier to continue paying debt off because of the savings in interest no longer owed on the repaid debt. I think over the next 4 quarters we are likely to see another $500 million knocked off of net debt. That does not square well with your statement about living off borrowed money. BK extremely unlikely in the near to intermediate term, and recovery very likely in the long term if oil prices hold up."
"I think, it is good news. Temporary short term drop might be there, but good for long term - https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-ceo-trades-4-million-162814645.html"
"NBRWF, up 10% today."
Are they paying dividends for the Preferred shares?Gl!
"Q 2 earnings pretty much in line with expectations, removing the $81 million impairment charge for the sale of Canadian rigs. Improved free cash flow, with optimistic forward guidance for the rest of 2021. Another $58 million of debt reduction less cash and investments. More rigs working now than Q1 (? Canada rigs), with expectation average rigs working will improve slightly in Q 3. Overall, I think the release is on the positive side."
We are caught with two controlling dynamics. Shortage of pipelines and a couple of thousand drilled wells. waiting to be tracked. Add to those a global cutting back on drilling and you will have a slow growth for drillers.
"2021 Guidance sounds like this will be a big year. Normally, guidance is conservative to manage expectations and set up for revenue and earnings surprises. These guys sound giddy and excited about 2021. Great sign. I see the stock getting back around book value. $200+ share price coming"
"EvrenLooking at the debt stack (to be clear, this is my opinion by looking through past press releases) I come up with (based on last earnings presentation from Q2 2021):$141m@ 5.l%, $4m@ 5.5%, due 2023,$558m@ approx 4.5% due Oct. 11, 2023,$287m@ 0.75% due 2024,$642m@ 5.75% due 2025,$213m@ 9.0% due 2025,$560m@ 7.25% due Jan. 15, 2026,$390m@ 7.50% due Jan. 15, 2028I'm hoping to see the further paydown of debt announced next earnings above and beyond the previously announced retirement of the remaining 2021 notes, and I suspect that the 2023 notes will be reduced because of the clue announced that the next maturity was the $25 million in early 2023, but this is only a guess on my part. If my guesstimates are in the ballpark, this would mean the annual interest payments are roughly $160.6m at this time, going forward. This coincides with the $41,741m quarterly interest expense listed in the most recent Q2 earnings presentation. If Nabors can renegotiate an extension of the revolving credit facility at or near current terms (I'm guessing to 2027), then they easily pay off the remaining 2023 and 2024 debt with current cash flows, as well as the 9% notes due Feb 2025. That leaves the remaining $600m plus due 2025 to be refinanced via a new debt offering, which I arbitrarily estimate to be at 7.5%. Add in the $558m revolver at the 5% level, and we still have $145 million in annual interest accrued. This is why I don't see as rapid a rate of payoff of the debt as you expect. The good news is that further paydown of the debt makes a much bigger impact on the interest payments after 2025. Of course, a big increase in drilling could really improve the rate of debt repayment, and I am very gratified by the way oil prices are holding up, but I've learned not to rely too heavily on the expectation of good times in the oil industry. I hope this helps you to see where I'm coming from."
"When oil was selling below $45ppb there was one, and only one, investor who stated the price was going to $60ppb before 2018. And today there is one, and only one, investor who is predicting mid teens for NBR in 18. The Mike Nifong's of the world are going to miss out on a big double and possibly more. Remember, old NYSE buys low and sells high."
"Petrello has deleveraged the company $740 million in the last two years, during an unprecedented collapse in oil prices combined with a worldwide pandemic. There is an enormous amount of depreciation to take advantage of, which is smart accounting, and free cash flow is so far holding up. Easy to armchair quarterback here, but the company appears to be doing the right thing for this situation. If you have a better plan to make the company more money than by paying off debt at this point, I'm all for hearing it. If your assertion is that the company, which is paying down debt aggressively, while being cash flow positive, and is in compliance with all debt covenants, is doomed to BK because they are depreciating assets in accordance with GAAP principles, then I'm not sure you are the person to be pontificating."

"Pushing earnings out is normally a bad omen statistically. In this case, however, is it plausible a transaction announcement may be in play? NBR has been on ""buyout"" lists for quite some time and with oil where it is, maybe this is the time? Curious on others thoughts."
"""During the quarter, we redeemed the $303 million outstanding of our 9.25% notes, which were due in early 2019. Our next debt maturity is not until late 2020. After the quarter ended, we amended our existing revolving credit facility, and added a new $1.27 billion revolving five-year facility providing us with good long-term liquidity. ""We also signed contracts for nine incremental rigs globally and received another four awards in the U.S. Lower 48. Four of the signed contracts are for upgraded rigs for multiple operators in the U.S., deploying by the end of 2018. The four new awards are for M750 upgrades and will deploy in the first half of 2019. The other five contracts are for incremental rigs in our International operations where we are also negotiating with customers for additional rigs. Demand for high-performance rigs is increasing across most of our global operations. We are encouraged by the positive reception of our rig upgrade configuration and the number of prospects for additional upgraded rigs with multiple operators, particularly in the Lower 48. We believe we are well positioned to secure a disproportionate share of future awards. ""Effective September 1, 2018, SANAD, our joint venture with Saudi Aramco, contracted 25 existing rigs with Aramco for four-year terms at improved rates. The renewal of the rigs will lead to a considerable increase in free cash flow. Twenty of these rigs are being leased from Nabors, while the other five represent the second tranche of Nabors rigs contributed to SANAD""."
"Two directors bought about $500K each at $5.6 and $5.16 on the open market just a few weeks ago after 3Q results. I hope they knew what they were doing. They probably weren't expecting oil to come off this much, though."
Guys you really shouldn't pay attention to pre-market action. Not enough volume
"Lets go back 90 days and review your prediction, 'ItsJustMyOpinion'. Hmmm, don't see anything from you. Your analysis suggests BK because the stock price is down. Well, the price is down, which is a better time to buy than when the price is up. Nothing you have said suggests future direction of the price of Nabors stock. Very easy to say you should have sold 3 months ago today, when viewing todays price. It is much harder to predict today as a good price to sell at today. One thing is certain, Nabors is paying down debt out of free cash flow, reducing future debt obligations, managing CAPEX, and showing improved rig utilization in a recovering drilling market. If your investment focus is what happens in a week, then you aren't really investing, you're speculating. You have yet to post a single item that shows declining operational fundamentals in the past two years. If you want to make money investing, you buy when the price is down, and sell when the price is up. You have it backwards.Perhaps that's why you delete your posts."
Amendment to revolving debt strengthens this company and provides assurance that they’ll be around awhile. Enough of the Bk talk and onward we go.
Quarterly dividend of .06 per share
"I've had two big losses in my lifetime. Nabors and another company which after 12 years of waiting for a recovery, I finally ditched. I'm tempted to throw those proceeds into Nabors but at this point... even if we get a Russia/Saudi deal, I don't know that it matters. Canada will be awful. Eagle Ford will be awful. Our only hope if for Permian Rigs to stay active, and at this point, does that even happen? Part of me thinks the Saudi's could buy a stake. Or that Cooperman/Icahn, and a consortium could try to privatize on the cheap. I've made great money on real estate plays the last few days, but this is the one stock, maybe the only stock that confounds me. People say BK isn't going to happen, but if that was true, why aren't insiders buying up the stock like crazy right now? The ONLY way I see there being a happy ending is if Nabors ends up getting a ton of prepayments on cancelled rig contracts. If they did, and it were enough to retire the near term debt, it could furlough most workers in the near term and just wait things out. Question is.... oil will eventually run into the same problem with construction. After the construction downturn, a lot of workers never returned. Regardless, I'm sure we will have our answer in the next 2 months or so."
"Might be reacting to recent BKs in oil service sector.PHI, BRS, WFT, all filed BK in last 60 days."
"NBR has 7.3 millions shares outstanding,float is less than 7 millions,look at the trading volume,no wonder it has been going up,there is just not enough shares after the 60:1 reverse stock split.Not a good stock to short unless you own the stock"
"Our global rig count totaled 148 rigs, a 26% decline from the first quarter. Outside of the U.S. Lower 48 and Canadian markets, our rig count declined by just 5%. We never like downturns, but Nabors' decline has been much smaller than the industry.This is a strong testament to the performance and value, which Nabors delivers to its worldwide customer base. In our Lower 48 business, our reported daily rig margin of 10,449 exceeded the expectation we laid out on the previous earnings call. Nabors' margin performance reflects four key factors: first, the capabilities of our rig fleet are second to none. We offer the highest specification rigs in the Lower 48.Second, we are the leaders in field of safety performance. We believe we deliver greater value while emphasizing safety than our competitors. Third, our focus on operational excellence and reducing expenses yielded the expected benefit of free cash flow. And fourth, recognition by our customers of the value we bring to the table has allowed us to manage pricing and mitigate the erosion of our average day rate for the fleet.In our rig technologies segment, we delivered the highest quarterly EBITDA in five years. This performance reflected improved margins in the Canrig operation. It also underscores Nabors' ability to deliver technology initiatives at lower costs. We achieved some notable highlights in addition to our financial results.First, data and digital workflows are coming to the forefront as a means to create significant value in our drilling services. The latest addition to our digital portfolio is RigCloud. RigCloud is a platform for digital operations which streams real-time drilling data from the edge devices to the cloud. It provides real-time visibility and analytics to drive performance.RigCloud enables preparation between the remote teams of customers and support centers to maximize planning, execution and reperformance across fleets. RigCloud has an open ecosystem of apps compatible with both Nabors and third-party rigs. It promotes informed, simple and better drilling decisions. We have launched it this month with more than 20 drilling apps and widgets that can be customized to create dashboards and tiles based on users' preferences.Second, we have unified the branding of several products and services to align with Nabors' smart brands. This evolution should enhance awareness for several products and services in Nabors portfolio. The new naming under the smart umbrella with accompanying value propositions for each offering will reinforce our products' reputation for innovation, value-add and quality, and help drive demand. Now, I will discuss our view of the market in more detail.Last week, the Lower 48 land rig counts stood at 236. That is down by 465 rigs since the end of the first quarter, a 66% decline. In comparison, Nabors' working rig count, excluding rigs stacked on rate has declined by 53%, or 13 points better over the same period. This environment is challenging, and clients are highly selective when determining their contractors.Our share gain clearly demonstrates our position as the leading performance driller. Nabors provides the best drilling performance with a superior safety record in the Lower 48. Looking to the future, we have spent a significant amount of time trying to understand how this market will unfold. The recent stability in oil prices around the $40 level should improve operator confidence.A handful of operators could see a modest increase in working rates during the second half of 2020. For 2021, assuming global economic activity and demand for oil continue to grow, we believe E&P industry spending will increase. That spend will likely pull through additional rig activity. In this scenario, we believe Lower 48 operators will be highly discriminating in their selection of drilling contractors and rigs.For drilling specifically, we anticipate a focus on premium, high-spec rigs. The Lower 48 operators, which are most likely to increase their drilling in the very near term, include several that paused activity completely. Beyond those, we expect operators with balance sheet strength, free cash flow generation, and a low-cost base as most likely to deploy rigs. In our international markets, we have already seen activity restart in Argentina and Colombia."
"Guys, this is just the beginning. Possible retaliation against Iran will hover over the market. Parts of Saudi facility will be offline for weeks (not days). US will need to increase exports to compensate. This will increase draws from US inventories which are approaching last years levels (when WTI was $75). There will be plenty of selling along the way, but the trend is up"
"I’ll be buying heavy this morning on the dip. As is usually the case, will be up nicely for the long run once Petrello speaks at conference and instills confidence is his company."
"Actually, Nabors should be trading higher than it is now. Steady progress over an extended time paying down debt, increasing EBITDA, recovery in drilling activity, and other positives. Much of the loss attributed to the quarterly loss are non-cash entries, along with large amounts of interest paid. With each quarter, the interest charges go down. As long as this continues, there is light at the end of the tunnel."
Where is the earning ?
"Cheaper oil is hurting Nabors. But cheaper oil depends on U.S. shale output. If fewer wells are drilled, oil becomes more scarce, and more wells will be drilled. It is a Catch-22 kind of situation. Shale wells play out faster, so will need to be drilled more often. Currently active rig count is declining, so fewer well being drilled, translating into less revenue for Nabors. Eventually, well production will decline, prices will start to go up, and more wells will need to be drilled. Throw in any resolution of a the current trade issues with China, or trouble in the Middle East (now what could happen there!), and you could get a much more rapid growth in new drilling activity. Management renewed guidance for reducing debt by $200 million for the year, and a reduction by $600 million (or more) through 2020. Goodwill is now carried at $90.645 million, ($99 million write-down last quarter, we won't be seeing many more of those). Nabors anticipates continued positive free cash flow. I believe that BK or restructuring is not likely in the next 18 months, and probably longer. Am I worried about the price decline? Absolutely. I will be thrilled when the day comes that I long for a 'buying opportunity'. I think we are at a good entry point if you want a stake in drilling, and are willing to wait for a year or two to cash out."
"Just a reminder:Fair value on Nbr-A is now(Common price X .137) + $1.50.137 is the conversion multiple $1.50 is the dividend amount left before conversion. You guys probably know this already, but wanted to post it for any newcomers.So, if common is $27($27 X .137) + $1.50 = $5.199"
Looking for a reason to buy….no reason found. Old times are gone and for a long time if so. I hope Nabors survives but it looks that Petrello is abusing the stockholders to the max.
Nabors CFO to Discuss Industry and Company Outlook at Goldman Sachs Energy Conference -I assure you his participation and the company outlining the 4th quarter metrics ahead of time - essentially telling us they have a good enough 4th qtr with enough cashflow to pay off a huge chunk of debt - is a significant positive update and that they are essentially maintaining guidance is also equally significant to NBR they are essentially saying we have confidence in the company future and the CEO saying they expect the company to do even better in 2019 is triple significantso now the naysayers and the short sellers manufacturing scare news on Nabors - well you know who they are - are lying
Rising with good volume. Bullish indication in Stochastic oscillator and RSI. http://www.foxchart.com/share/457351497.png
OK - so there are some nay-sayers that say they bought a whole bunch of this stock at a high price? Why would they bash the stock and management if they really are holding at a large loss -wouldn't they want to say good things about a company that is coming back from low oil prices? It doesn't make sense to predict the price going down now...since oil is going up and most of the big forecasts have Brent at around $70/bbl this year. imho.
Crash - if the corporate officers thought this puppy was going under - why would they Grant themselves huge share numbers in Feb 2019 ? Not that I'm defending it - cause I think its pretty sleezy to do what they did. But Petrello granted himself 12 million shares and Restrepo got over 2 million. Not sure when that info became public knowledge - or how much that is for a company with a share float over 300 million - but if I was all of a sudden owning 12 million additional shares - I'd be pretty motivated to see some share price appreciation. Definitely wouldn't want to see it go under ... I think the bottom is in for this one and it will steadily head higher - as long as crude keeps marching higher. Print that long term chart out I posted last week - draw the channel I described - when crude approaches the upper trend line - somewhere between 75 and 85 dollars - it'll be time to give this one a rest. This will probably be between 6 and 8 dollars ...
"Again, 'ItsJustMyOpinion', offers no reasoning or analysis to his opinion, except for the brilliant observation that if you bought higher you are experiencing losses. How about some facts to support your opinion that Nabors will go BK? I couldn't help but notice all your previous posts have been deleted. Buy Nabors now for long term profit!"
"I have no idea what Mr. Market will do to my long position in NBR. However, I'm keeping some quotes below from a poster here from being deleted. This post is to help keep things real for all! ""Reduce position here. Up over 4% from yesterday is a gift. I am selling a block at $3.98. My opinion""""I suggest taking advantage of this unusual up tick for NBR. The trading volume is way below average so the movement is a little misleading. Take what you can here. My opinion""""Interesting how they capped it at $3.99. The manipulation continues here. They do not want it to touch $4's again. That was a fluke last time. My opinion"""
So... in the absence of Crash (maybe I muted him...) if oil hits $80 as some predict then NBR is an easy $5.50... at today’s price not too late to board the train as I certainly did at $3.68...
Just sold 15k shares please tel me it’s not a mistake
Oil is going to be around a long time yet. I wonder if Exxon might scoop this company up. Right now I am down 93 % in NBR. Hope ain't a strategy but it has as much value as this thing.

Bottom line from Nabor's Call --- Sales are surging
"Up or down from here?I am thinking NBR still has upside from here, at least in the mid to long term. I am disappointed that it didn't hold $3, but not surprised. There is a tremendous amount of negative sentiment in the market towards oil related companies, and it has been difficult to gain traction in that environment. However,....I think that during the next year there will be some steps toward resolution in the trade dispute with China. Either Trump wins re-election, and China decides to make a deal to get their economy going, or whoever Democrats nominate wins, and the Chinese know that it is likely they only have to wait until after inauguration to get a better deal. Either way, I think China's economy (and their energy requirements) surge, and with it oil prices. With the refinancing of NBR's debt, there now is several years of breathing room to wait for another boom in oil prices. Last crash was in 2014. Before that, 2008. This swoon in oil prices is now 6 years old. NBR has positioned its' debt wall to be able to survive until the next oil run. All it takes is a geopolitical event to get the ball rolling. If the Iranian regime feels threatened by internal domestic unrest, I can see them provoking a conflict regionally to try to stimulate a 'rally behind the flag' situation.That would also create for them a demand for their oil, and may disrupt oil supply from their neighbors. Of course, a regional war could destroy Iran's and other oil fields in the region, but the government in Iran is more concerned with their survival as the ruling authority than the infrastructure of the country.In summary, I see Nabors hanging on for several more years, waiting for the next oil boom, and several scenarios that could occur which might provoke that boom."
"I agree with the dividend cut. I made more than the annual dividend the day it went up 9 and a 1/2 percent. They also indicated that they will pay off at least 200 million in debt in 2019, and buy 400 million dollars worth of equipment in 2019. Maybe the icing on the cake will be that they are actually profitable this year to."
"June 30, 2017. Nabors will release earnings after the market closes on July 31, 2018."
"Thoughts about the bond offering news released today..... looks like they are clearing out the majority, if not all, of the remaining bond debt until 2024. This should improve cash on hand for the next four years, and allow ample time for a recovery in the drilling market. It does leave the debt outstanding on the revolver, but barring disaster, that should be able to be retired by the improved cash flow. It seems to me to be giving Nabors a lifeline for the next four years. If oil can recover to average $65 or better, I could see steady progress on the share price."
This was a $30 stock back in July 2014. Oil was over a $100 a barrel then and will be over a $100 a barrel by 2022.
"Nabors getting to attractive valuations at these prices. Oil prices down with COVID concerns again, but people showing a lot more reluctance to return to lockdowns again. I think any dip below $60 oil will be short lived."
"Anthony G. Petrello, Nabors Chairman, CEO and President, commented, ""We believe our combination of top quality personnel, superior assets, market position and technology serves us well in any environment. We will continue our focus on reducing our leverage over the next two to three years. We can accomplish this through stringent capital allocation and still continue the progress we have made in modernizing our fleet, introducing new automation technologies and enhancing our performance drilling capabilities. We continue to expect 2019 to be an improvement over 2018 and another good step forward for the company."""
"THINK - I have a question for you . Knowing that you are tracking debt profile real close, how is that next due is $25m in 2023 after paying $82M - 9/21 dues? In the last earning release they reported $558m revolving credit facility + $145m notes outstanding for 2023 dues? I am a Litte lost when the news reads next fist due is $25m in 2023. Did they already refi the credit facility and $145m 2023 notes? If so I totally missed it . Thanks ."
"oil will be $90 before year end,could be $100.l"

"NBR's bonds have been rising for the last 5 days in a row. The bonds aren't signaling bankruptcy, the 2020 bonds are over 100. The equity should catch up. NBR probably wouldn't go an equity offering at this level."
"i bought 50,000 shares i hope NBR going up to 2.50 price 1.63 is good buy"
I’ve just bought 10000 shares and will add every week when under 3. This is a sure bet to double by December 2019. Where else can you get a certain 100% return? Now officially long on NBR after day trading it for the last 6 months
"Looks to be a basic short attack here. Tiny float. Price of oil nearing $60. Earnings report will be good and this stock price will make its way to $120+ sooner than later. The institutions are not selling and they own roughly 68%. Hang in there if you are long. Your reward is coming. Of course, the stock is still above $75-$80 range, so not much of a short attack anyway. Long!"
"Nabors eliminated its dividend, cut capital expenditure and reduced salaries. All these steps will ensure liquidity and solvency."
"At this rate, and with excellent 2021 guidance today I expect $200+ by summer. No problem."
"Had a good run. Now, it breathes a bit. Profit takers, margin call victims, scrapers are going to do what they do. Consolidation before the next run upward. Every stock sees a similar pattern. As more of the world opens, the price of oil climbs... and there is a lot of pent up demand out there. Still undervalued here. Long."
"I am usually very good with numbers but I am having trouble wrapping my head around the preferred conversion. i am trying to figure out at what price the common needs to be for me not to go negative. right now my average on the A is $7.40. If I am doing it correct, common would need to be $55+."
"Similar to last quarter. Analysts began raising estimates and slight ratings bump. Stock trended upward. These guys restructured a lot of debt early in the pandemic. I would expect another favorable earnings report coming up. This is a great price to buy if you look at the chart. We are on the low end of their recent trading range. I would expect 65 by the end of year. Vaccine materializes, election over, good earnings numbers = boom."
"ItsJustMyOpinionYou are wrong, as usual. A declining share price does not automatically lead to BK. It is an indicator of market sentiment, to be sure, but there is a big difference between the financial condition of Chesapeake and Nabors. Nabors refinanced a large portion of debt in 2020, extending maturities until 2026 and 2028, and has been aggressively reducing debt for the past 2 years. The drilling market is slowly, but steadily improving."
"Grabbed a bunch more to round it out to 10k shares (I never thought I'd be in possession of 10k shares of NBR, but here we are). If it goes down further, I might pick up 10k more!"
"I switched all my shares to HLX couple weeks ago at low $1. At least HLX has a real chance go back to $10. When you have another stock which still generates free cash flow and with very low debt, and also down 90% in the same oil field and located in the same city, what will be your choice. the point is you don't have to recover your loss in the same stock."
Crashhow did that add at 5.50 go?
"Sent question to investor relations regarding info on 3rd quarter dividend, received the following response:There has not yet been an announcement concerning a dividend. An 8K to that effect should be issued tonight.DennyDennis A. Smith"
And just like that for no reason at all.
"I had exp in investing in diff companies, the most funny part is there is atleast one person or more who want the share to go down and all investors losing there money.....they will comment to there heart content after seeing people losing there money and if any body oppose them, they will reply back that they are helping investors by encouraging to sale and save there money.......but dont get decieved ,they are the same people who buys the stock in throw way price after listening to there comment and then these same people saling it for profitable price, the set up is systematic and they can be 100% found in all companies stock group chat...they are the paid people to bring down stock and fill there own pocket with not so good earned money"
"Surprised at how many posters can't or are too lazy to read company financials. Nabors doesn't need to touch its revolver to pay off the 2020 notes. They announced Cash flow generation will be down in 3Q vs. 2Q due to timing of bond interest payments, but it has plenty of cash on hand to pay off the 2020's without refinancing. The 2021's, which don't even have a terrible interest rate (4.6% i believe), will be refinanced soon. My guess is after the 2020's get paid off and they get even better financing terms. Which it should because paying off the 2020s will lead to a credit upgrade, especially with the divvy eliminated, in addition to being EPS positive in 2020. This company isn't going to skyrocket anytime soon, but the bankruptcy talk is an absolute joke. They've already said they see Brent oil of $65 as being optimal. Even with the downturn, Brent is still in the $60 range. IMO.... Nabors is range bound for most the 3Q, because as i said above, cash flows will be impacted by bond payments and a few other semi-annual outflows. That being said, they've already reduced the 2020 bond balance, so 4th Q is when you probably see the 1st big surprise. There will off course be a stock price drag because of people selling year end for tax losses. But you could see a serious rally in Nabors in 2021.My best guess: (unlike Crash - I'll leave my post up)3Q this year - range bound between 1.4 to 3.254Q this year - tax loss selling pulls us back down sub-2, but in the last two weeks of December, we rally above 4 and near 5.1Q 2021 - big interest payment and employee bonus hurt earnings, but this is the last poor report. Despite this, rig technologies show first sig revenue boost. Trading range is 4.5 to 6.2Q 2021 - 2020 notes are paid off. 2021 notes are refinanced at 4.25% or better. EPS is zero instead of negative. Noting a bright future, stock price starts slow methodical rise and nears 7.3Q 2021 - Nabors is EPS positive for first time in years. Debt continues to get paid down and all revenue drivers are firing on all cylinders. Stock prices accelerates to 10.There are two big caveats to the above:1. Warren makes major gains and Trump looks likely to lose (the downside risk)2. Iran/Turkey/other world conflict pushes oil prices up faster ( the big upside)3. China deal never materializes (the neutral case, because this is already baked in)"
"just bought 10000 shares, this company is 100 percent profit."
"Volume is supporting a powerful move upward. If there is any pullback, it will most likely continue to be intraday as it has been for weeks. Double digits might be closer than originally thought."

"Billionaire Leon Cooperman had a few last stock ideas to share on CNBC's Halftime Report on Tuesday before he closes his hedge-fund to outside investors at the end of the year.Cooperman shared six of his best ideas in the interview, explaining a few reasons why he thinks the stocks — AMC Networks, Citigroup, CVS Health, Keane, Nabors and United Continental — are a good value for investors."
Setting up for another run. Accumulation is taking place. Volume tells the tale.
Price is getting more and more attractive at this level. Those that buy now stand to make a lot of money when it returns to $100.
"Occidental Petroleum says they are not cutting rigs. That goes along with Hess, Chevron and Conoco saying they are keeping 2019 drilling budgets flat or even higher. When will the aggregate picture of NBR's customer base' 2019 budget start to become clear?"
Good numbers came out of the last earnings report. I expect the same or better to come from this report at the end of the month. The price of oil and demand are both slightly better now.
Just picked up 6k
Leon Coopermans reputation is on the line since this is one of his top picks
"my question is directed at the analysts EPS predictions. over the past 5 quarters, analysts have been far off the mark with generous estimates. Perhaps the miss is the analysts inability to forecast reality, and not a companies inability to hit a target set by people that may not be experts in the inner workings of the company they are analyzing."
"I had NBR in an old long-term account being managed by someone else (I wasn't paying attention, shame on me), which was recently devalued so my purchase price has been inflated to over $300 a share, and it's sitting around $60 today - a huge improvement over where it's been for the past couple years. Should I cut my losses and take the $60? None of the analysts seem to think it will go alot higher...or just keep holding it for years more to see if it eventually recoups the losses?"
Does everyone understand that these preferred shares will be redeemed on 05/21/2021 for $25.00 worth of NBR common????

"London Traders Hit $500 Million Jackpot When Oil Went Negative(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- On April 20 the price of a barrel of oil for delivery the following month plummeted $40 in an hour, settling at –$37. It was the first time crude had ever crossed into negative territory. Regulators, oil executives, and investors have struggled to understand how a commodity at the heart of almost every aspect of global trade had fallen so far that buyers had to pay counterparties to take it off their hands.But for a small group of veteran traders at a tiny London firm called Vega Capital London Ltd., the mystery mattered less than the results: They pocketed as much as $500 million that day, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke to Bloomberg Businessweek on condition of anonymity.Vega’s jackpot, which hasn’t been previously reported, involved about a dozen traders aggressively selling oil in unison before the May West Texas Intermediate contract settled at 2:30 p.m. in New York, the people say. It’s a tactic Vega’s traders used regularly, according to another person familiar with the firm’s strategy, but that day its trading coincided with a period of unprecedented volatility, when demand for fuel was wiped out by the coronavirus pandemic, and storage space in Cushing, Okla., where buyers take physical delivery of WTI crude, had all but disappeared.THE OIL PLAY IS NOT OVER YET, THERE IS STILL A BIG WINDFALL WAITING. $40 is too cheap and will spike at some point... The laws of supply and demand will be disrupted."
"Am about to load up on NBR , any thoughts ?"
"If you are waiting for a company with positive free cash flow that is paying off debt aggressively to go BK, I suspect you will be waiting a long time. The price is down today, along with the market, and the price of oil. No great mystery there. Will Nabors survive? I say yes, as long as they are making money and paying off debt."
"CFRA LIFTS VIEW ON SHARES OF NABORS INDUSTRIES TO HOLD FROM SELL2:49 pm ET September 11, 2020 (CFRA) PrintWe keep our 12-month target price at $32, a 1x multiple of price-to-projected forward operating cash flow, in line with NBR's recent historical forward average. We narrow our projected loss per share in '20 by $4.98 to $82.47 and '21's by $6.39 to $91.72. Our upgrade is on valuation, with shares down about 37% over the last three months. We see the key catalyst for '21 being upstream producers' capex plans, and for the most part we see such operators being conservative in spending levels, especially in North America, where development plans can be more flexible. Given poor well economics with oil prices below $40 per barrel and natural gas still mired below $2.50 per mcf, we do not see a demand-driven case for better pricing traction in 2H '20. However, we think industry consolidation is likely to continue and NBR, as a key participant in onshore drilling, should see brighter days when pricing ultimately does recover."
"Do not miss the ex div date on July 14 for the preferred shares. NBR-PA. At least take advantage of the highest dividend in the market right now. Shares are a deal at $6 , as well. .75/share. $3 annually. I bought another 5,000 shares today, so that’ll be an additional $3,750 on my dividend check."
when oil was $30NBR was 5.67
"Nbr beat earnings estimates for the last 2 quarters, during the worst of the pandemic. While many companies were filing for BK and oil prices were in the toilet, Nbr was beating estimates. Now that oil is tracking to $50 I would expect impressive quarterly numbers to continue. Institutions own the majority of the stock. Smart money usually knows what it’s doing. Tiny float. Buy the dips. Firmly in the $85-$100 range to stay by February 15. (Earnings come out the first week of Feb)Long!!"
"Nabors CFO to Discuss Industry and Company Outlook at Goldman Sachs Energy Conference News provided byNabors Industries Ltd. Jan 08, 2019, 17:15 ETShare this article HAMILTON, Bermuda, Jan. 8, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Nabors Industries Ltd. (""Nabors"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: NBR) today announced that William Restrepo, Nabors Chief Financial Officer, will participate in the Goldman Sachs Energy Conference on Wednesday morning January 9, 2019, wherein he will discuss the industry environment and Nabors outlook for 2019. In connection with Mr. Restrepo's participation at the conference, the Company is announcing the following financial highlights for the fourth quarter: Reduced net debt by approximately $230 million and total debt by $150 million based upon preliminary fourth quarter financial information. Preliminary year-end 2018 net debt was approximately $3.12 billion on total debt of approximately $3.59 billion Repurchased $108 million of long term debt during the fourth quarter Full-year 2018 capital spending was well under $500 millionNabors fourth quarter financials are not yet finalized. The company does not intend for the above metrics to be taken as an indication of GAAP financial results for the fourth quarter. They are only intended to provide investors with advance information on Nabors' financial position, given investors' level of interest on that specific issue. Nabors will release its full financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 in late February.Mr. Restrepo commented, ""As anticipated, fourth quarter cash flow generation allowed us to reduce our net debt significantly. The industry experienced a sharp drop in oil prices during the fourth quarter of 2018. Given the recent oil price rally this past week, it is uncertain to what extent this volatility could lead our U.S. customers to scale back investment. To date, there has been minimal negative impact on U.S. activity and the demand for our high-specification rigs in the Lower 48 remains strong, with leading edge dayrates at attractive levels. Our goal is to remain focused on cash generation and reduce our leverage, as previously announced. To that end, we are targeting a $200 to $250 million net debt reduction during 2019.""Consistent with those objectives, and to ensure we can reach our Nabors' 2019 planned objectives in a volatile market, we are prudently taking the following premptive steps:Targeting 2019 capital spending at the $400 million level Optimizing 2019 G&A and R&E expenses through a reduction of approximately 10% compared to 2018 Planning an 83% reduction in the quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders, to $0.01 per share, beginning in the second quarter of 2019Anthony G. Petrello, Nabors Chairman, CEO and President, commented, ""We believe our combination of top quality personnel, superior assets, market position and technology serves us well in any environment. We will continue our focus on reducing our leverage over the next two to three years. We can accomplish this through stringent capital allocation and still continue the progress we have made in modernizing our fleet, introducing new automation technologies and enhancing our performance drilling capabilities. We continue to expect 2019 to be an improvement over 2018 and another good step forward for the company."""
"Another up day on higher volume...all bullish signs. As fast as it went down from $6 plus on high volume, the reverse can and will happen IMHO."
Let’s hope oil will not want to continue going down and crash just yet.. it needs to stay at or above $60 for the next 2 years for nabors to come out ok in the end .
"When will the dilution occur now that my 1,300 shares are now 27 shares. As I understand it NBR will double the number of existing shares"
Wait until Saudi Aramco goes public. The exposure alone given the partnership could catapult this to double digits and back to the days of old - $30 plus.
