Looking for a reason to buy….no reason found. Old times are gone and for a long time if so. I hope Nabors survives but it looks that Petrello is abusing the stockholders to the max.
"Actually, Nabors should be trading higher than it is now. Steady progress over an extended time paying down debt, increasing EBITDA, recovery in drilling activity, and other positives. Much of the loss attributed to the quarterly loss are non-cash entries, along with large amounts of interest paid. With each quarter, the interest charges go down. As long as this continues, there is light at the end of the tunnel."
"You are mistaking book keeping entries for cash flow, IJMO. Positive cash flow, and paying off debt is far from living off borrowed money. There is a large debt, to be sure, but you are omitting the fact that $740 million in net debt was paid off in the last 8 quarters. Each successive debt repayment makes it easier to continue paying debt off because of the savings in interest no longer owed on the repaid debt. I think over the next 4 quarters we are likely to see another $500 million knocked off of net debt. That does not square well with your statement about living off borrowed money. BK extremely unlikely in the near to intermediate term, and recovery very likely in the long term if oil prices hold up."
"oil will be $90 before year end,could be $100.l"
Shows earnings are out today??
"Lets go back 90 days and review your prediction, 'ItsJustMyOpinion'. Hmmm, don't see anything from you. Your analysis suggests BK because the stock price is down. Well, the price is down, which is a better time to buy than when the price is up. Nothing you have said suggests future direction of the price of Nabors stock. Very easy to say you should have sold 3 months ago today, when viewing todays price. It is much harder to predict today as a good price to sell at today. One thing is certain, Nabors is paying down debt out of free cash flow, reducing future debt obligations, managing CAPEX, and showing improved rig utilization in a recovering drilling market. If your investment focus is what happens in a week, then you aren't really investing, you're speculating. You have yet to post a single item that shows declining operational fundamentals in the past two years. If you want to make money investing, you buy when the price is down, and sell when the price is up. You have it backwards.Perhaps that's why you delete your posts."
"@ ItsJustMyOpinionWhy don't you keep your posts up this time and let's see how well they age? When you made your last prediction of doom and gloom the price of NBR was in the low $70's, and that was just a few months ago. I can see why you delete that stuff....it must be humiliating to be that wrong. Anybody want to put odds on posts by 'ItsJustMyOpinion' disappearing by this time tomorrow?"
"Lost a rig in the U.S. last week, down to 542, according to Baker Hughes. I'm surprised we didn't gain a few more. It's hardly a trend, though. Looking forward to earnings and the subsequent conference call. I certainly not predicting a profit, but I do think there is a real chance at beating earnings expectations. I'm also eager to get an update on the status of bond debt repayment. It is looking promising for oil to stay near current levels for at least another quarter, and maybe much more, which should be factored into what explorers will be willing to budget for drilling in 2022. I understand all those longs eager for outright profits to post, but there is a lot of debt with attendant interest expense that will have to be dealt with first. Nabors could really take off, though, if oil surges much more."
Down almost $3 after hours. Somebody has an early copy of the earnings press release.
"If you are waiting for a company with positive free cash flow that is paying off debt aggressively to go BK, I suspect you will be waiting a long time. The price is down today, along with the market, and the price of oil. No great mystery there. Will Nabors survive? I say yes, as long as they are making money and paying off debt."
I left out the best part. The preferred A share pays like clockwork. Highest dividend on the market. Only $5 ish to grab a .75 quarterly dividend. It will convert next May so you get 2.25 per share between now and then... and you’re paying $5 for the share right now. Best deal around right now.
"THINK! You're an awesome guy who deserves what is coming your way now. Just my opinion of course, not financial advice."
"@evren,Quick thoughts.....While the loss of $15.79 is a bigger loss than the street was expecting, I think tomorrow may be a decent day for us. I am using the yahoo statistics with my calculations, but the $81 million impairment charge isn't recurring, and accounts for approximately $9.83 of the loss. We are not privy to what value Nabors was carrying the Canadian assets on the books, but that value should be zeroed out now. If next quarter is at least as good, as would appear by the guidance in the press release, then Q 4 should be quite a big improvement. International business should be roughly in line with Q 3, and domestic business better. Tomorrow could be a good day, depending on the conference call."
$200/share by year end . Easy. It is time for the market to show respect here . Jeeezzzz
Like I stated before; this is not investing. Its all about timing and gambling at this point. The movement of the stock has no rhyme or reason for it. The company just reports loss after loss with what appears to be no end in sight. How long can a company operate under that premise? Its been well over 5 years since they have had anything close to a profit. And why would anyone be compelled to buy a stock over $100 a share when the losses per share are double digit? Amazed and bewildered.
37 days ago the stock was worth 21 cents a share. Today it's worth 76 cents a share (pre-reverse split pricing). What's changed for the company or in the macro environment that it's worth 3.5 times as much five weeks later? Really!
"ItsJustMyOpinionI'm not surprised you lost money in Nabors. You apparently think it is time to sell when the price is low, and buy when the price is high. You also don't seem to understand that a company can be making money while taking advantage of allowed depreciation to show an accounting loss. It is that free cash flow that is being used to pay down the debt. Every $50 million of debt retired is like another rig being put to work at current margin for more than a year, each and every year. And Nabors is paying off that much and more each and every quarter."
"EvrenLooking at the debt stack (to be clear, this is my opinion by looking through past press releases) I come up with (based on last earnings presentation from Q2 2021):$141m@ 5.l%, $4m@ 5.5%, due 2023,$558m@ approx 4.5% due Oct. 11, 2023,$287m@ 0.75% due 2024,$642m@ 5.75% due 2025,$213m@ 9.0% due 2025,$560m@ 7.25% due Jan. 15, 2026,$390m@ 7.50% due Jan. 15, 2028I'm hoping to see the further paydown of debt announced next earnings above and beyond the previously announced retirement of the remaining 2021 notes, and I suspect that the 2023 notes will be reduced because of the clue announced that the next maturity was the $25 million in early 2023, but this is only a guess on my part. If my guesstimates are in the ballpark, this would mean the annual interest payments are roughly $160.6m at this time, going forward. This coincides with the $41,741m quarterly interest expense listed in the most recent Q2 earnings presentation. If Nabors can renegotiate an extension of the revolving credit facility at or near current terms (I'm guessing to 2027), then they easily pay off the remaining 2023 and 2024 debt with current cash flows, as well as the 9% notes due Feb 2025. That leaves the remaining $600m plus due 2025 to be refinanced via a new debt offering, which I arbitrarily estimate to be at 7.5%. Add in the $558m revolver at the 5% level, and we still have $145 million in annual interest accrued. This is why I don't see as rapid a rate of payoff of the debt as you expect. The good news is that further paydown of the debt makes a much bigger impact on the interest payments after 2025. Of course, a big increase in drilling could really improve the rate of debt repayment, and I am very gratified by the way oil prices are holding up, but I've learned not to rely too heavily on the expectation of good times in the oil industry. I hope this helps you to see where I'm coming from."
"While Nabors is racking up a dismal record of quarter over quarter GAAP losses, I think it is important to consider the positive EBIDTA, the very real progress made toward debt reduction, the pickup in drilling activity that accompanies the rise in oil prices, the projected increase in rig count coming online from the SANAD JV, and the steady, but slow recovery in rig count utilization in the lower 48. It think it is far too premature to predict a Chesapeake-like scenario for Nabors. I also believe next quarter, when the $82 million 2021 notes have been retired, there will be positive uptick in share price. If Nabors retains a disciplined approach to debt reduction, as it has the past few years, it will be far easier to negotiate a new revolving credit facility at less onerous terms than is currently required by the bond market. I don't think Nabors is bleeding money; rather Nabors is slowly plugging the leak."
What is it going to take the market to notice the progress here. Obviously they are going to survive but stock continues to trade at bankrupt market cap. Insane . Tried of complaining . Another bad day after the release .
"ItsJustMyOpinionYou are wrong, as usual. A declining share price does not automatically lead to BK. It is an indicator of market sentiment, to be sure, but there is a big difference between the financial condition of Chesapeake and Nabors. Nabors refinanced a large portion of debt in 2020, extending maturities until 2026 and 2028, and has been aggressively reducing debt for the past 2 years. The drilling market is slowly, but steadily improving."
"Again, 'ItsJustMyOpinion', offers no reasoning or analysis to his opinion, except for the brilliant observation that if you bought higher you are experiencing losses. How about some facts to support your opinion that Nabors will go BK? I couldn't help but notice all your previous posts have been deleted. Buy Nabors now for long term profit!"
"Baker Hughes Rig Count shows another 5 rigs added this week. Slow but steady recovery happening. More and more positive stories being published talking about chances for higher oil. Also getting near year end, and new fiscal plans will likely be drawn up with capex for drilling included. Q 3 results later this month may really provide a boost if there is an upside surprise, and nothing that has happened in the last month or so gives me much indication that doom is on the way."
Let’s hope oil will not want to continue going down and crash just yet.. it needs to stay at or above $60 for the next 2 years for nabors to come out ok in the end .
"The precipitous drop is overdone today. While oil is down $1.53, it is still at $77.40. You have to go back to Nov. 2014 to find higher. NBR was over $800 then, with a higher debt load. I think more rigs will be going back to work in Q 4 with oil over $70, and a lot more rigs will be working if oil stays mostly over $75. I'm looking forward to the earnings release and conference call later this month. I am cautiously optimistic."
up 341% since my purchase but i only bought 20 shares. Not a rich man. But i am patient.
"Surprised at how many posters can't or are too lazy to read company financials. Nabors doesn't need to touch its revolver to pay off the 2020 notes. They announced Cash flow generation will be down in 3Q vs. 2Q due to timing of bond interest payments, but it has plenty of cash on hand to pay off the 2020's without refinancing. The 2021's, which don't even have a terrible interest rate (4.6% i believe), will be refinanced soon. My guess is after the 2020's get paid off and they get even better financing terms. Which it should because paying off the 2020s will lead to a credit upgrade, especially with the divvy eliminated, in addition to being EPS positive in 2020. This company isn't going to skyrocket anytime soon, but the bankruptcy talk is an absolute joke. They've already said they see Brent oil of $65 as being optimal. Even with the downturn, Brent is still in the $60 range. IMO.... Nabors is range bound for most the 3Q, because as i said above, cash flows will be impacted by bond payments and a few other semi-annual outflows. That being said, they've already reduced the 2020 bond balance, so 4th Q is when you probably see the 1st big surprise. There will off course be a stock price drag because of people selling year end for tax losses. But you could see a serious rally in Nabors in 2021.My best guess: (unlike Crash - I'll leave my post up)3Q this year - range bound between 1.4 to 3.254Q this year - tax loss selling pulls us back down sub-2, but in the last two weeks of December, we rally above 4 and near 5.1Q 2021 - big interest payment and employee bonus hurt earnings, but this is the last poor report. Despite this, rig technologies show first sig revenue boost. Trading range is 4.5 to 6.2Q 2021 - 2020 notes are paid off. 2021 notes are refinanced at 4.25% or better. EPS is zero instead of negative. Noting a bright future, stock price starts slow methodical rise and nears 7.3Q 2021 - Nabors is EPS positive for first time in years. Debt continues to get paid down and all revenue drivers are firing on all cylinders. Stock prices accelerates to 10.There are two big caveats to the above:1. Warren makes major gains and Trump looks likely to lose (the downside risk)2. Iran/Turkey/other world conflict pushes oil prices up faster ( the big upside)3. China deal never materializes (the neutral case, because this is already baked in)"
"Some are unable to do simple math. 'ItsJustMyOpinion' is one of those people. If you don't understand the difference between cash losses and depreciation, just admit it and move on. No one will miss you."
Baker Hughes rig count shows another 10 rigs added in the U.S. since last week and another 10 internationally. Oil at $82+/barrel. Steady progressive improvement should pay rewards for those willing to wait.

"Nabors getting to attractive valuations at these prices. Oil prices down with COVID concerns again, but people showing a lot more reluctance to return to lockdowns again. I think any dip below $60 oil will be short lived."
Thanks for reaching out . I will be waiting for your input after you review your spreadsheets. They are definitely trying to reduce the debt but the my question has always been are they really doing everything possible in that effort when oil is relatively trading at a high level. We all know good days don’t last forever. They should not leave any stones unturned while the energy markets support it . I am a little nervous . The speed at which they are biting the debt is questionable. I think .
"It will be very interesting to see how much additional debt has been paid off during Q 3 above and beyond the $82 million that remained of the 2021 debt. During the Q 2 earnings call, Petrello said it was unlikely there would be news forthcoming regarding the revolving credit line until at least Q 4, so I don't think there is a likely boost in share price due to news on that issue, but Q 3 couldn't have gone much better for Nabors (IMHO). The price of oil remained strong and the weekly rig counts have showed steady improvement. How much of the new drilling business went to Nabors remains to be seen, but I think it is reasonable that they got their share, so I wouldn't be surprised to hear the Q 3 EBITDA exceeds expectations. I think that a big catalyst for share price improvement will come in Q 4 when and if Nabors gives more clarity on how they will manage the revolving credit line. Currently the market seems to be bullish on oil prices for the near term, and if the price of oil holds at or above current levels for another quarter, investors in NBR should be rewarded."
"Petrello has deleveraged the company $740 million in the last two years, during an unprecedented collapse in oil prices combined with a worldwide pandemic. There is an enormous amount of depreciation to take advantage of, which is smart accounting, and free cash flow is so far holding up. Easy to armchair quarterback here, but the company appears to be doing the right thing for this situation. If you have a better plan to make the company more money than by paying off debt at this point, I'm all for hearing it. If your assertion is that the company, which is paying down debt aggressively, while being cash flow positive, and is in compliance with all debt covenants, is doomed to BK because they are depreciating assets in accordance with GAAP principles, then I'm not sure you are the person to be pontificating."
"Looking at the past 4 years 2Q-3Q net debt reduction amount, this quarters $120m reduction looks pretty impressive actually . I jumped the gun pretty quick without digesting the data. Biggest reduction typically happens between 3Q-4Q. Here is the breakdown for 2Q-3Q2017 - net debt increases by $230m2018 - net debt increases by $118m2019 - net debt decreases by $60m2020 - net debt decreases by $10m2021 - net debt decreases by $120m——To me that’s great news ."
@ItsJustMyOpinionI'm up $40/share since the last time you weighed in. Perhaps you aren't the investment guru you seem to think you are. That includes todays drop. Maybe stock analysis isn't your thing.
"THINK - I have a question for you . Knowing that you are tracking debt profile real close, how is that next due is $25m in 2023 after paying $82M - 9/21 dues? In the last earning release they reported $558m revolving credit facility + $145m notes outstanding for 2023 dues? I am a Litte lost when the news reads next fist due is $25m in 2023. Did they already refi the credit facility and $145m 2023 notes? If so I totally missed it . Thanks ."
Should do a 5 for 1 split
