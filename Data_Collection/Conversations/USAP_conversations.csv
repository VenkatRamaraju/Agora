"Quarter in-line, margins improving each month during 2Q, probably 200-300bp increase in 3q.Volume growth looking better for 2nd half. Aerospace build schedule looks promising for 2017-2019 with a 30% ramp. O&G coming off lows, but at this point not a meaningful part of revenue line, maybe an upside for 2017. PowerGen looks good with GE, Siemens et al. projecting 5-8% growth in 2nd half and backlogs up by as much as 20%+. USAP probably a good one to begin accumulating as we come off the ocean bottom for steel and commodities. Stainless steel spot 'shortages' a real possibility by YE. USAP to hit the conference circuit over next 30-60 days."
