does anyone know what if anything the outgoing CEO did? I have looked far and wide and cannot find any details
Exelon reached a 52 Week low at 41.85
Now lets see a sizable divi increase!
Well one thing is for sure and that is that the highways are busy because the gas is cheap and people are going for a ride just to break the boredom. So that in turn keeps the hurt for the oil companies just a little bit less.
This could well go back to upper 20's after x-div ...............
This is all about Nuclear reactors. Thirty years ago they were building them and it cost a fortune. Then accidents occurred as well as Tsunamis in Japan and no one wanted them in their backyard. Then fracking and wind energy came along and major industry disruptions due to free trade and product dumping that made Nuclear power less attractive. Exelon is a well run utility and at the current price should be in a long term portfolio. I bought shares today. All the chatter that is negative is useless
EXC is down 5.01% to 42.88
Exelon is up 5.72% to 45.29
EXC is down 5.05% to 43.80
I do not have access to Crain's Chicago Business publication but I see it has an article on Exelon having three thermal plants in Texas off line from Monday onward. Anyone have access to this article (How Exelon Contributed to Texas' energy woes)and can share its importance?
I hopped on at $36.$42 is my stop.It’s been nice riding with you guys.Safe travels and may you see $50 soon.
"Trending up over the past month, glad I held on"
"Exelon will go back to to $50+ eventually, when the rest of the market rises with it. So, it's a safe bet. However, there will be worse days in the coming months as the entire economy tries to stabilize and figure out the impact of the virus in the short term."
People can keep their distance and still fo sight seeing to keep the family in tact without everyone going crazy.It will be even better when the authorities realize that there is no reason to close parkas and beaches. The sun is your friend durning the pandemic because it stop depression and kills the chronavirus.
Exelon is down 4.92% to 41.00
EXC is up 5.13% to 37.08
raise the divvy and we will see $50 by 1st qtr of 2019
EXC should close above 34
When is Dresden and Byron plants closing? Power from these plants are not needed and will help the bottom line.
"wow, EXC-ellent price movement the last couple days and week. Even @$40+, is still below historical and 5yr. blended P/E of ~14.6. Good companies always return to fair value..."
Is EXE paying a first quarter dividend? No mention of it yet and 2020 declaration was on January 28. Here we are the middle of February and no mention. Or am i missing something?
How is this stock looking? Thinking about investing.
Utilities are overvalued!
"$OZSC CEO just confirm that Tesla, Con Edison, and Exelon are customers. Also, confirmed that a fortune 200 company will be announced as a partner. $TSLA $ED $EXC"
Why is it down almost 2dollars?
Exelon ceo explores buying Amsc.
Who thinks we will be in the green tomorrow?
You would think climate activists would be fighting for nuclear stations to stay open. They produce a massive amount of power and run base loaded. They waste $10’s of billions on renewables that are not dispatchablele. Plus they re wasting trillions with the rebuild America plan which is a is a political give away. The base nuclear load is one of the things that makes Northern Illinois the most reliable grid area in the world. Full Disclosure: I do not work for Exelon or any of its subsidiaries. I do not own any exelon stock.
Im initiating a short - free money here
40 bucks after hours. 60$$ price tag
"Everyone that is complaining about this CEO does not recognize how the incentives for wind and solar combined ed with fracking dropping the cost of nat gas completely changed the playing field for nuclear. I think this CEO and his team have saved Exelon from going under. If not for the terrible weather in Texas, this would have been a good quarter and they still plan to meet guidance by year end."
Board of Directors not doing their job. CEO needs to be REPLACED. If you can't do your job you will be replaced. Shareholders want ACCOUNTABILITY and TRANSPARENCY.
Important company - too bad they can’t attract any good leaders
Up 3.4% today... that’s a sign of investor confidence.
"When Donation $$ are made it should be with your own money not others....Your pay check is your money ,company money is Not."

"added a few shares today, div yield hit >4%.. nice DGR for a ute, low payout ratio... works for me, early retired with a dividend paycheck.."
CEO Shattuck Mayo Adams... Chairman of the Board Is getting { TOO MUCH IN STOCK GIFTS } I belive shareholders decerve at least 1/2 of what is getting .. SHAREHOLDERS NEED TO RESPOND !!!!!!!!.. NOBODY IS WORTH THAT MUCH >..... EXC Employees lost a BONUSES FEW YEARS BACK !!!! SHAREHOLDERS ZIP !!!!!!!
Wizardofwallstreet had the best idea yet. See his comments below
EXC is down 4.92% to 41.00
"I think a trim @L is warranted... above normal P/E FV, div yield down near 3%, DGR flat, E decrease for FY22."
"With the stock down so much today, looks like the next supporting level at $43."
why the big drop
"exc is good price today can not resist , Vanguard and State Street file 13 buy many millions shares1000x41.48"
Takeover coming?
Here’s some of the goods on what prompted investigation of exelon officialshttps://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-martin-sandoval-fbi-search-warrant-20191011-hp3r6eep3fb7naxlxqhxedtswq-htmlstory.html
"There's not much to say about EXT other then, it's like a nightmare that just keeps getting worse.As far as Yahoo & these message boards, I congratulate you.If your intent was to destroy them, you succeeded in a most spectacular way"
"he company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.3825 per common share last week. The dividend will be payable on September 10, 20202 to stockholders that will be on record by August 14, 2020.In its Q2 2020 results, the company reported a net income of 53 cents per share and adjusted operating EPS of 55 cents. Exelon has reaffirmed its FY2020 adjusted operating EPS guidance of between $2.8 and $3.1. the solid adjusted EPS was mainly a result of enhanced cost savings at Exelon Generation which helped in offsetting the damaging impact of storms affecting utility earnings."
"Instead of all these charity donations , how about spreading some charity to SHAREHOLDERS !!!!!!!Exelon has a lot of back room deals that promise $$$ to groups to get deals done!"
Are the earnings before or after the bell?
"Natural gas rallying nicely, power curves moving well, fixed price nuke. What a beautiful thing. All I can say is GIDDY UP!!!! Cheers."
Does anyone know why EXC continues to go up on high volume the last two days? I can not find any news related to the move.
EXC hits new 52-week high at $47.12!

The best investment is in CON EDISON if you want to invest in energy companies. EDISON gives a growth dividend every year. It is a company with a history and financial stability that serious investors trust.
"EXCellent, up scope baby... the 4%+ div has left the room, sorry if you missed."
EXC is down 6.94% to 33.50
Exelon 1 year stock percent return minus 2.9%. pitiful. deplorable. company needs new leadership.
How long is this CEO stuff going to cause share holders to lose money
EXC their Nuclear is the new Green under Renewable Energy
Div hike coming next Q... think I'll add a few @43 and below
why going down?
"Today, around 12 noon, TMI stopped producing electricity. Wow. Nuclear power is the answer to everything. It doesn't use oil, coal, or gas. It doesn't pollute a hoot. Its the best thing to save a dying planet. Well why wouldn't Pennsylvania bail it out ? Run by a far left governor, even Penna knows how toxic nuclear is. It takes 33,000 years for the spent fuel to degrade. Whether its stored out west, or on TMI, its a target for terrorists to steal. Look what it did for Japan, during the tidal waves. look at the leak at Indian Point New York, in 2016. Corey Booker wants to help poison the rest of the country, and build more nukes. I think we should build thousands of plants, if we can store the used radioactive material in his basement, and anyone else who wants to build these things."
Not bet so far.
I'm also increasing my portfolio EXC is on the run.

"added a few more, with the div yield % >4. What's great is it's only a couple days to ex-div date. Works for me, a div paycheck early retiree!"
Exc is 62% Nuclear - only 20% natural gas - cheap fuel does little to help Exc
S&P has a buy rating for EXC. Plus the dividend is more than CD's are paying. Utilities are usually bought for incomenot speculation.
Exelon is down 5.00% to 37.82
It's about time for our Dividend announcement. Is this the Qtr we get the increase based upon the commitment made two years ago or is it next Qtr?
Why are we being kept in the dark as to what is happening? Washington leaks all the time.
Sold mine.

Where's the dividend??????
Looks like heading to 52 week low.
Bought in just before the close. To me anything under $36 is a great buy!
Come on EXC..Lets make some money and quit screwing around..This isn't playtime.
EXC is down 7.35% to 30.61
Exelon was unable to raise dividend this year due to the 200 million fine they must pay because of their corruption. Why are they not going to prison???

"Remember me ? Way back in the good old days of Yahoo message boards (when they didn't suck) I did the Duke vs Exelon, vs Southern vs Wisconsin Energy challenge. If you don't remember let me refresh your memory. I owned EXC for many years and found it to be a dog. So I researched 3 other companies in the same sector. Wisconsin Energy turned out to be the best, far out-performing the other 3 over the previous 5 year period. So I sold EXC, & bought WEC I said I would occasionally post the results even if I turned out to be dead wrong,I'm happy to report Wisconsin energy has continued to trounce the other 3. WEC 65.59%SO 23.24%EXC 16.55%DU 5.41%How ironic that the most recent message besides mine contains the the following words to describe Exelon's 1 year stock performance.

"I'm confused. When the interest rate goes up, EXC should go high or lower ?It seems sometimes it go higher, sometimes it go lower. Thanks!"
Morgan Stanley has a $60 price target on EXC. Despite some set backs this is still a great company.
A good resource for Exelon and any other utility can be found at https://www.utilitydive.com/

I think that today we’re getting a Polar Vortex Bump. Lots of electricity being sold.

Natty is exploding. Power curves are following. This is only the beginning of our price rally
What does Exc have to do with Corona? Also Cheap fuel can’t hurt. I’m thinking about ED and EXC for secure yield on the cheap.
EXC is up 5.15% to 32.08
When is the next x date ? Thinking about jumping in
"Likely at least a 5% div hike next Q, last three years have been 5.1%, 5.3%, 7%. At $43, brings the fwd yield to ~3.75% or more.. capapp/TR takes care of itself... works for me %^ )"
What is going on with this ? Yesterday it was way down and now it's up higher?Favorable lawsuit ?
"I have held this stock in a DRIP for decades, and right now it is cheap. Eventually there will be a favorable distinguishing out of the cheaper utilities from the broad market selloff."
Bought $50K of EXC earlier this week. Still going down??? This does not make a lot of sense to me because there is no heavy industry in the DC / Maryland areas. I will probably buy more next week as this low pps simply cant stay this far down long.
"Just sold 4K worth of shares for a nice gain (2 buys in the 33s and 30s)....I believe in this stock long term but the market typically takes a dump after a massive green run like today...will buy back in around 30 if it gets there...THOTZ, Patrick?"
I like it.
"Power curves strong, natural gas moe, EXC cheap...cheers"
"I wish I could sue everytime I lost money on a stock. What a bunch of BS. I lost $20,000 in my 401k when Exelon went down. It will recover like it always does. Stocks go up and down. What a joke."

I rid my portfolio of this flea earlier this month. I did come out ahead by reinvesting dividends but once they cut the dividend years ago it started its decline and is nowhere near its high.
Ouch! That explains the slide of the last two weeks!
"NucsThis is actually the time when EXC really shines. Texas shows the dangers when the power grid is too dependent on nat gas. This reminds me of the vortex years when EXC's nucs were producing at 95% capacity when coal burners were shut down due to frozen conveyors and nat gas turbines were largely shut down when gas was diverted for home heating. EXC really needs to highlight periods like this as the reason for grid diversification, even if they require subsidies. Media lambasted EXC when they requested subsidies to keep the nucs operating but they mearly were ofsetting the wind subsidies provided years earlier. We'd be screwed if we did not have diverse power sources!FL"
Holy jeez!!Must be a lot of money that was sitting on the sidelines getting back into the market!
Playing it safe and rebalanced some of my holdings. I like EXC as we enter potential downturn. I also see the stock having a path north.
this stock will go up more?

I can barely find any information on the corruption probe on open source media. How big is it and what are the possible impacts to the business?
This is the worst company for electric
"If ratepayers bail out Byron and Braidwood, and electricity prices go up in five or ten years, we want those 4 gigawatts produced at operating cost + 2-3 cents/kwh.

Nuclear Plant operators like Exelon are under scrutiny for ZEC subsidy payments.See https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2020/08/11/psegs-shift-to-nuclear-raises-concerns-as-bpu-looks-to-next-round-of-subsidies-1306875

Sold some puts today after the run-up
"Many people are happy that TMI is going to be retired. Esp the people who live downwind, and have a higher than average cancer rate. Believe me, those lower electric rates do not pay for cancer treatments. Maybe the best thing is, now there is less of a demand for uranium. You remember how Hillary approved of selling 20% of our uranium mines to a Russian outfit. How fitting that they get punished for their collusion and millions of dollars of Foundation contributions. When is Exelon going to lower rates, since they will be paying a much lower tax rate. Elect rates should be coming down 10% all across the country."
"EXC-ellent price movement this morning... still below blended 5yr. P/E avg. (3yr. trailing and 2yr. fwd estimates)= below FV.. @>2x the yield of S&P, div hike coming next quarter.. works for me %^ )."
"typical exc price runs.. great run up on great news / numbers, then right back down for no apparent reason :("

Down 20% in the last 12 months!! What a joke?
Exelon is up 4.91% to 42.97
"Added more shares @41.5 this am. Div hike coming next Q, should be ~5%, to at least $1.60. That's very close to 4% fwd. yield. Still below FV... works for me %^ )"
So proud to be working for this ethical company that prioritizes safety and customer service.
52 week high.
This stock is a complete joke!! Has lost 40% since hitting 50.00. Has lost 20% the last 10 years. How can a utility stock lose 15% in one day?
Does anyone know what date of record you have to have to be a part of the spinoff in Q1 2022?
Earnings out and the are spinning off the Gen business.
If Exelon doesn’t get a favorable deal in Springfield blame it on their 10 year corruption!!
What's behind the run up today? Looks like they were beating the rest of the utility sector.
#$%$ stock!!
Selling under book value. Best buy of all utilities.
Positive for the regulated side of the new company but the generation side will file chap 11 within 2 years....same as FirstEnergy out in OH....nuclear plants are the problem. Shareholders will be OK but those bondholders stuck with the generation side bonds are in for a rough ride....and this is NOT positive for rate payers as Exelon will not be forced to provide needed capacity on their own system....Texas anyone?

"Instead of all these charity donations , how about spreading some charity to SHAREHOLDERS !!!!!!!"
Listen folks - there is a reason that there is multiple shareholder lawsuits for investors that have suffered material losses. The reason? This company is a MONOPOLY SCAM. The only good thing about this company is that their accounting company is E&Y and that there are multiple E&Y employees I've had the pleasure of getting to know up close and personal in a private setting.
(http://Fairstox.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
"EXCellent price movement again, with Q3 beat and FY20 E. est raise. Even at the low end est of $3, it's below FV. The 5yr. blended P/E avg. (three trailing and two fwd yrs.) puts EXC @$44. And that's just touching FV. works for me %^)"
EXC reached a 52 Week low at 37.82

Buy on the dips no where to go but up from here
Why is this down more than the other utilities ??
"Exelon CEO Chris Crane tells Fortune Magazine that they plan to invest 25 billion over the next 5 years.He better invest in upgrading the system to withstand an EMP attack.Because if he doesn't, he and all electric company management won't be allowed to stay in the shelters., that we'll all have to stay in to survive, if one happens."
"Results out, not too bad good foundation and guidance for rest of the year."
EXC reached a 52 Week low at 29.47
Trump = Three File Island!
"I like utility stocks, but wondering if they could get sued over pollution contributing to climate change?"
Why did it drop 3% in the last 12 minutes of trading? Crazy
.38 DIVY Coming right up must hold EXC through tonight LOL!!!
"The Markus poised to open high and this stock isn’t moving, what is wrong with this company"
Exelon is splitting up. Generation one way and the Wires another way. So where is the dividend?
EXC will get more weighted for me going into 2019. Time to rebalance and focus on safety
"Praful Mehta downgrade EXC to sell price feb 2016 was 36, EXC today in 2019 is 48 LOLhttps://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/16/02/6525271/citi-downgrades-exelon-to-sell"
how about a 2 1/2 percent dividend increase like Dominion has done. It's about time you look after shareholders after your 1 year dismal lackluster stock performance. if you can reward customers by rate reductions surely you could reward shareholders.
"To To grew you haven’t said why, please explain thank u"
"Earnings look fine to me. The stock has a low PE compared to not a few utilities. So it is still quite attractively priced, I think so anyway!"
"Careful First Energy Customers. Exelon, using the shell company Constellation, is offering a 6.09 cent a kwh for electric, and a 75 dollar gift card. The ad sent to me says I get 75 If I switch. However, their online info says you get 50 if you switch electric, and 25 for nat gas. NAt Gas is not mentioned anywhere on my ad. Also, they don't tell you anything about the Gift Card. Is for Amazon, Giant, Walmart, or what ? Exelon shareholders, this was a pretty lame scheme to get phone numbers and email addresses, and probably credit information. And no mention of Exelons or Constellations, or Virtual Incentives privacy policies .I'm not giving out anything anymore, including my shoe size, without privacy policies. I get enough robo calls."
WHAT A BIG SORRY COMPANY STILL WONT RAISE THE DIVIDEND
"HB4492 was quietly signed by Governor Abbott last night, effectively immediately. Good news for Exelon because they'll get a refund/credit back from ERCOT for all excesses charged for ancillary services (example, RRS) in excess of $9,000 per mwh, for the RRS and Non Spin that hit $24,000/mwh during Uri. Good news for Exelon, and GREAT news for Vistra (VST) and NRG. Stock prices probably won't reflect it till someone like Seeking Alpha or a Bloomberg Analyst releases a story on it."
Big BEAT!!! Expect $55 in the weeks to come!!
"Adding more shares again @ this price, it will spike. Nobody can beat EXC."

Please remember ceo crane laughing all the way to the bank.at the share holders expanse!!!
Listen folks. This SCAM of a Company likely cooked the books in order to distract you from one of their 20 pending lawsuits. Stay away!
EXC reached a new 52 Week High at 43.64
CEO AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS NEEDS TO BE REPLACED..ASAP..
EXC is up 6.74% to 32.00
This thing swings more than 1% on half the days out of the month. That's a lot for a UTE.

"How much did Exelon buy Clinton from Illinois Power for again? I thought it was some ridiculous price like $100mm, right at the start of a commodities bubble.If Exelon wants to give away four reactors at the beginning of what seems to be a commodities supercycle, that is their right. But I think it's an opportunity for ratepayers to lock in relatively cheap generation that will be free from carbon regulation.Why doesn't IL have a third, capitalist approach:1.) *Local* investors come in and put up $500K apiece to buy the plants2.) Offer the unions equity, but ask for reductions in cash wages. Let's get everyone pulling for the plant. They seem to already be offering concessions in their nuclear plan. Let them buy in at the same terms as investors. IE $500 in reduced cash wages buys them as much equity as 1/1000th as a $500K share.3.) Offer the exact same terms to ComEd ratepayers visavis the Illinois Commerce Commission. They will probably be too dumb to say yes. But at least we tried, and when rates shoot up to 20 cents and everyone complains, we can offer re-regulation on more favorable terms.4.) If Exelon balks, the state has this cool power called Eminent Domain. If someone is willing to buy and own the plants and thinks they can maintain them at a profit, it makes sense for the state to keep them open. The additional supply is good for ratepayers, the plants employ a few thousand people, and it is one tiny thing that can attract business to Illinois in the face of hundreds of billions in pension shortfall.5) There would be other levers to make this thing work too. Full 1990s ComEd-style re-regulation would be fine. Or the state could just own it. I don't think there would be as much pressure to hold down operating costs, though.If a bunch of local investors showed up and offered to buy Braidwood for $100mm and try to keep it open, I think it would be a good thing for Chicago. Number one, I think it would guarantee that the plant would stay open on some level for a few more years. Even if there was no opportunity to invest, there would be a positive benefit for everyone who does not own a natural gas electric plant. But number two, with what appears to be an engineered fossil fuel shortage (CC Exxon, Royal Dutch, IEA), the plant may turn out to be as valuable as it was back in 2005.Something to think about. If there's interest from other local investors, give a thumbs-up and comment. If the union's willing to make concessions; if ratepayers value stable prices; if we want to be able to attract power-consuming businesses to the state; there ought to be a way to make this work.We might be able to get some property tax breaks too, but the fair and honest way to do it is that these things go away if we start making a profit, and we repay the breaks if rates increase. The goal is not to get handouts; it's to try to manage financial risk and make things fair."
When are they going to buy Amsc?

"After all, EXC is essentially an Illinois based utility. Crooked as a tub of guts, as virtually everything in Illinois."
"Last years earnings were $1.67 billion. NY is going to give a subsidy of about $400 million the first year and up to $800 million 12 years from now. So, divide $400mm/$1.67B and I get 24%. That's .46 per share. I am sure if NY passes this, Illinois will be right around the corner. Next years earnings est is $2.64, add the .46 and we get a pe of under 12. I for one am looking for a nice dividend increase. Based on the current pe and a 24% earnings growth over the consensus earnings that's a $45 stock price. If other states give subsidies, EXC will easily be over $50 next year with a better dividend. IMHO"
Don't understand the up shot and never understood the lengthy dip for a big UTE.It feels better moving up though.Decommissioning those Nuc's seems like a long time $ obligation with no return. Right?
"Exelon has a squeaky clean, above board company culture. I believe Exelon and its executives will come out with flying colors. So, I am buying shares today"
More trouble ahead!
Exelon reached a 52 Week low at 37.82
Can’t have an EV boom without an increase in electricity production.
"Remember me ? I did the Duke vs Exelon vs Southern vs Wisconsin Challenge here years ago. For those who weren't here then, a refresher. A little less than 5 years ago, (June 2014) I owned Exelon. It had been underperforming, so I researched 3 similar stocks. Duke Energy, Wisconsin Energy, & The Southern Company. Wisconsin was the best performer over the previous 5 years, so I sold EXC, & invested the proceeds in WEC. The same day I made a hypothetical portfolio at yahoo. All 4 of these stocks, with a cost basis of they're closing prices that day.Here’s the results as of today. (I'm not sure if yahoo considers dividend reinvestment)Wisconsin +79.77%Exelon +57.33%Duke +24.22%Southern +19.31%Clearly a 2 dog race for the top position, while Duke & Southern show abysmal returns.As for Wisconsin energy, it appears the old phrase ‘the cream always rises to the top’ is accurate. Have a nice weekend."
What is the next support point? Should I buy some more at slightly under $38?
WOW !!! Good thing I didn't buy this for the dividend today ! I would probablybe losing about $350 just to make $150. !!
why the spike after hours ????
excelon will benefit from the split of distribution and making power. it's something that will send this share price soaring
Can I buy Exelon stock directly. I want to buy it for my grandchildren
"Dipping my toes in. Bought 500 shares today- this price seems to good to pass up. Good luck to all longs, and here’s to hoping we see 40s by June. "
EXC reached a 52 Week low at 42.95
very lackluster performance ahead of earnings.
EXC reports earnings $0.89; estimate $0.60.
"Oil up, EXC due a bounce, $47 by next Friday."
Terrible ROEs with utilities located in business unfriendly states. It's no wonder this company has under-performed the S&P for the last 20 years.
"The Duke vs Exelon vs Southern vs Wisconsin Challenge Lives!After suffering with EXC stock, I sold it in late July 2014. Researched 3 other companies in the sector & chose Wisconsin Energy.Bought 200 shares of WEC in my Fidelity account in August 2014That same day I made a watchlist of all 4 stocks at Yahoo, & entered the cost basis as the closing price that day.Returns as of the close today *I don't think Yahoo includes dividend reinvestment in the returns*EXC +9.66%DUK +13.44%SO +15.26%WEC +39.04%At one point in the challenge Exelon was actually kicking butt over the other three. But now cream has risen to the top, & Exelon is back in its rightful place.I'm just kidding of course, because things can change fast on Wall Street.But this is one of the most valuable lessons I've ever learned in investing.Don't get caught in a value trap. I'm guessing I was no different than a lot of you here. I was initially attracted to EXC when it was in the mid 40s because it 'had been' close to $90 back in 2008.Unfortunately, nine years later it's not even half that price. Investing in bottom feeders is a disease, & I was lucky enough to find the cure.Good Luck"
HI BT AND OLD GUY!!!! HOW DID MY SHORT WORK OUT?? GROW A PAIR AND POST ON HERE YOU WERE WRONG!
"Hmmmm. If you can’t sell the public on climate change, your nuclear reactors are essentially worthless. Is the prospect of Trumps re-election the reason why this move has been made? After all, this specific company was known as “the president’s utility “ under Obamas administration. Hmmmmmm"
Adding more shares again. Good luck to longs. Buy hold Win.
"At last rough count, I think at least 14 law firms are jumping on the lawsuit bandwagon vs EXC. it’s a suckers game for investors who opt to be part of a class action — and win: big money for the lawyers, peanuts for the investors. Be glad when it’s over."
