Byron and Dresden saved for 5 years. Good news for Constellation next year.

"It's Exelon's turn finally. Nice subsidies and electric bill increases for keeping Dresden and Byron open will stop the bleeding and point Exelon forward to being one of the nation's cleanest and lowest cost energy providers. Splitting the company into utility and energy will allow the company to focus on each's core business and Dominguez sounds capable as the new CEO. P/E of 40 is high when average utility is at 16, but I'm hopeful for good earnings report and see growth. Just retired from this company and this is the most hopeful i have ever seen it with improved operational excellence. I am hoping with good earnings reports upcoming to see the stock at 65 by next summer."
EXC hits 52-week high at $52.80!
Natty is exploding. Power curves are following. This is only the beginning of our price rally
With 140 mil added per year. The stock stays in the RED it defies logic. Does anyone agree or am I delusional ? Please express your views thanks.
Perhaps the nuclear generation fleet has grown in value of late??
Not that I am complaining. Been holding since low 30's. But EXC appears a little frothy. High p/e and low yield.
Natural gas has continued it very strong move up. Companies like EXC are printing money in this environment. Quark sorwads are exploding. CHEERS
"I had to trim off more @50.50. EXC is still well above it's normal 14P/E avg., FY21 ests. are for 13% yearly E decrease, dividend is down near 3%, DGR slowed to ~2%."
"Forward power and carbon curves are way up, this is one the lowest cost large clean energy producers. We are about to see a massive revaluation of energy producers."
EXC hits new 52-week high at $50.62!
My favorite stock in my portfolio :)
"Gas is pushing higher, levels we haven't since 2015, pushing power curves to again levels we haven't seen in years. MARGINS are blowing up. GL ALL, but we aren't close to highs...."
"Had to trim off a bit more @52.30. Well above historic P/E avg., even above EOFY22 est. P/E. Div yield below 3%, although DGR has been decent. Unless Q3 earnings are a big surprise up like Q2, it's very overvalued.."
Terrible ROEs with utilities located in business unfriendly states. It's no wonder this company has under-performed the S&P for the last 20 years.
"I think a trim @L is warranted... above normal P/E FV, div yield down near 3%, DGR flat, E decrease for FY22."
"If ratepayers bail out Byron and Braidwood, and electricity prices go up in five or ten years, we want those 4 gigawatts produced at operating cost + 2-3 cents/kwh. If Exelon is saying the plants are worthless and should be shut down, fine, but prove it. Give ratepayers 70-90% of the upside if we keep the plants open."
