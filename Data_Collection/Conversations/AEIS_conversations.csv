Makes no sense- beats estimates and drops 13 %?
When I saw this dropped from the 80s to the 70s I thought it was a great buying opportunity.!i want to thank the guy who told me to wait a couple of weeks. You saved me lots of dough. Doesn’t look like it’s going to bottom any time soon.
"Great buy in price. Excited to see where this is in about a year! Also, interested to see what they do with all of this accumulating cash."
What a day
"Thank you, tickets please, thank you, thank you, tickets right here"
Net of cash this stock is trading at a forward PE of 6.

This is too good a stock to have dropped down to the low 60s recently... but provided me a great buying opportunity. I was waiting for just such a 'screaming deal' moment. This is going back up and over 85 in August after earnings July 31.
$AEIS picking up a $1.27 at the bell. right before earnings....love it! earnings come out on Monday and it's going to be a wild ride.
"Perhaps, some WS folks imagined this morning that AEIS is an energy stock, just checking the name, and so they pushed it higher today together with real energy stocks. Kind of pleasant mistake."

The scenarios are quite interesting at current levels for AEIS. google awesomeSTO-CKS - they offer pretty good trade alerrts. you dont have to trade their tickers but it definetly helps you recognize possible patterns for stocks you're trading.
$61 is a sin.
Oh great we break out and everybody sleeping
"AEIS is a great buying point! Although weak longs are probably panicking, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. AEIS is great at what they do and it reflects in their financials. Plus with the recent drop all indicators point to buy. Low RSI, no debt, high current ratio, great PEG. This stock just needs a little time to recover, but it's proven itself in the past and will hopefully do so once again. Here's a link to important ratios and financial informationhttps://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AEIS"
About to inject some fiat into this and rock it to the seventies and beyond
AEIS is up 6.15% to 46.28
Company’s fate is sealed. I will enter around 25 in about 6 weeks.

AEIS is up 9.69% to 42.35
AEIS is down 7.65% to 42.36
"I had to pick up some at $70.83. It might be a little overvalued a bit. I am willing to pay a little premium for quality. I was on the CC and it was very positive. They have some high barrier of ""entry"" tech. Solid company."
"Reporting tonight, should be good"
Advanced Energy reached an all time high at 97.39
"Q3 EPS down by 50%, exclude non recurring down by almost 20%.Past sales growth mainly based on M&A, more expenses such as new HQ office annouced, no cost management plan announced, industry slow, uncertainty of tariff, expected soft Q4.Expecting the price to dip further.Will only enter if the price is below $32 with current result."
A great time to add more!
AEIS has caught a virus. seems we'll have to wait 2 more qtrs for growth potential to be realized.

83 was the lowest. My average buy today was at 84. Now it goes up all way
why is it down? earnings is good.
Their profit margins are awesome and they have a good chunk of cash. Look for a buyback or acquisition soon. Great company!

"""EPS of $1.22 beats by $0.15 Revenue of $165.9M (+ 39.7% Y/Y) beats by $10.13M""""We generated nearly $64 million in cash during the quarter and once again demonstrated the success of our model to deliver during very high growth period across our business. More recently, we made a small acquisition that strengthen our Specialty Power portfolio and expands our TAM in key markets.The nearly 50% year-over-year increase in our semiconductor business experienced in the second quarter exceeded initial expectations, leading to another record performance. Semiconductor revenues reached $117 million in a quarter, driven by the acceleration and expansion of 3DNAND capacity, the ramp in 1xnanometer logic to high volume and the recovery in DRAM spending."
"Grab it before eod, earnings on monday"
Bingo!!!
Patience. The fundamentals are strong here. Market dynamics affecting this will abate... soon this will rise...
Advanced Energy is up 6.61% to 81.13

"Nice dip before ER, been in since 40s 140s soon"
AEIS is up 11.94% to 70.78
That a good report will sell off some and bounce back to continue up trend... guarantee 100 soon
"Watch this till Friday and be ready, lots of support"
AEIS has started going down now. This stock was not $55. The price was popped up to this high because the executives and the Street can exercise their options. Now they will let it crash so then they can get to new stock option at a much lower price. That's how has been played.
Anyone know why this stock has been so weak lately? Seems like PE is reasonable and chip manufacturers are doing well. It's down significantly from a high of 95.
"Rock this bad boy higher,going to be a nice move back to highs"
Rocking now!

Advanced Energy is a solid company and a good choice any industrial growth in the economy. The stock appears to be in a consolidation phase due to rate at which the price appreciated over the last 12 to 16 months. This is a very reasonable entry point (~ $64/share) for anyone wanting to open a long position in AEIS. It is also a reasonable price at which to add to a long position.

"mac you pulling this cart solo? Man what a stock, going higher?"
"Good news recently, we should start to see this one move."
I went back in time to see when it happened before. It took several weeks before it exited a similar slump.
"Consensus expected is $1.00... guidance for this Q originally .96-1.06, on revs 150-160m... they definitely won't miss, just a matter of how strong."
"oversold. advanced energy industries as NO long term debt and nice cash flow. stocks like this often get overlooked now that we live in the world of ETF, but advanced Energy is good individual stock for the predicted stock pickers market. Buy."
"However, the qtr over qtr forecast of flat revs and EPS is weighing on it."
"Disagree this is undervalued, its business product seem to have low entry barrier. Many small enterprise able to produce similar product in china. In addtion of trade war which will hurt company EPS significantly due to having single production plant in china. Revenue very likely to be affected as well. PE is considered high for this sort of business."
I don't get it boys. up and then drops like an anchor.
No worries about a slight pullback... earnings will be great. Its bounced back pretty quick from the low 60s a few weeks ago.

"Just a matter of time... PE currently ~19.5 with this EPS announcement earlier this week:""Our result this quarter exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Semiconductors led the way as AE outperformed the broader wafer fab equipment industry, industrial growth continued in all sectors and service surpassed historical levels. In total, revenues grew 40% year-over-year to $166 million and non-GAAP earnings per share climbed 67% to $1.22, driven by strong non-GAAP operating margins."" ""Non-GAAP operating margin was 31.8% compared to 31.9% in the first quarter and 27.8% last year.""""The nearly 50% year-over-year increase in our semiconductor business experienced in the second quarter exceeded initial expectations, leading to another record performance.""""Business from all our OEMs grew substantially in the quarter, as the wafer fab equipment market remained robust worldwide. For example, we had a record quarter in Korea, where our sales to local OEMs increased over 100% from last year's second quarter.""""We remain confident that 3D NAND will be the biggest driver for the semi cap markets in AE over the next few years, with demand still well ahead of current capacity. """"We expect second half of 2017 semi revenues to be equal or higher to the first half; in longer term, anticipate continued high level of growth""""Looking ahead, we expect to see a strong third quarter for the industrial business.

""""Excelsys is a small well-known DC power supply company with a strong established presence in certain markets, including medical, laser drivers and other industrial applications.Their power supplies fill in our portfolio with lower power, high-density configurable solutions for critical applications and are entirely incremental and compatible with Advanced Energy's. """"With a pipeline of actionable targets that we look to progress this year, we see this most recent acquisition as the first step towards our goal of adding $150 million to $200 million in industrial revenue over the next 3 years. Service revenues grew to record level in the second quarter, increasing 10% sequentially. Growth accelerated this quarter, as we responded to surges in demand and continued to execute on our proven strategy""""In total, this was an exceptional quarter as AE fired at all cylinders, demonstrating the strength of our organization and the flexibility of our model to deliver during a period of unprecedented growth. This, while also successfully executing on an acquisition that added to our specialty power portfolio, expanded our TAM and is already contributing to our top and bottom line."""
