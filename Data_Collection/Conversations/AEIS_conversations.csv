"Disagree this is undervalued, its business product seem to have low entry barrier. Many small enterprise able to produce similar product in china. In addtion of trade war which will hurt company EPS significantly due to having single production plant in china. Revenue very likely to be affected as well.

This is too good a stock to have dropped down to the low 60s recently... but provided me a great buying opportunity. I was waiting for just such a 'screaming deal' moment. This is going back up and over 85 in August after earnings July 31.

The scenarios are quite interesting at current levels for AEIS. google awesomeSTO-CKS - they offer pretty good trade alerrts. you dont have to trade their tickers but it definetly helps you recognize possible patterns for stocks you're trading.
"AEIS is a great buying point! Although weak longs are probably panicking, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. AEIS is great at what they do and it reflects in their financials. Plus with the recent drop all indicators point to buy. Low RSI, no debt, high current ratio, great PEG. This stock just needs a little time to recover, but it's proven itself in the past and will hopefully do so once again.

No worries about a slight pullback... earnings will be great. Its bounced back pretty quick from the low 60s a few weeks ago.

It's the IBD sector top pick. It's so thinly traded that it will take time to realize the gain from the earnings report. Gotta let this position soak a while and move attention to other opportunities.
AEIS has started going down now. This stock was not $55. The price was popped up to this high because the executives and the Street can exercise their options. Now they will let it crash so then they can get to new stock option at a much lower price. That's how has been played.

"Just a matter of time... PE currently ~19.5 with this EPS announcement earlier this week:""Our result this quarter exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Semiconductors led the way as AE outperformed the broader wafer fab equipment industry, industrial growth continued in all sectors and service surpassed historical levels. In total, revenues grew 40% year-over-year to $166 million and non-GAAP earnings per share climbed 67% to $1.22, driven by strong non-GAAP operating margins."" ""Non-GAAP operating margin was 31.8% compared to 31.9% in the first quarter and 27.8% last year.""""The nearly 50% year-over-year increase in our semiconductor business experienced in the second quarter exceeded initial expectations, leading to another record performance.""""Business from all our OEMs grew substantially in the quarter, as the wafer fab equipment market remained robust worldwide. For example, we had a record quarter in Korea, where our sales to local OEMs increased over 100% from last year's second quarter.""""We remain confident that 3D NAND will be the biggest driver for the semi cap markets in AE over the next few years, with demand still well ahead of current capacity. """"We expect second half of 2017 semi revenues to be equal or higher to the first half; in longer term, anticipate continued high level of growth""""Looking ahead, we expect to see a strong third quarter for the industrial business. With strength throughout our markets""""This acquisition(Excelsys) is part of our ongoing strategy to grow and diversify our industrial business. """"Excelsys is a small well-known DC power supply company with a strong established presence in certain markets, including medical, laser drivers and other industrial applications.Their power supplies fill in our portfolio with lower power, high-density configurable solutions for critical applications and are entirely incremental and compatible with Advanced Energy's. """"With a pipeline of actionable targets that we look to progress this year, we see this most recent acquisition as the first step towards our goal of adding $150 million to $200 million in industrial revenue over the next 3 years. Service revenues grew to record level in the second quarter, increasing 10% sequentially. Growth accelerated this quarter, as we responded to surges in demand and continued to execute on our proven strategy""""In total, this was an exceptional quarter as AE fired at all cylinders, demonstrating the strength of our organization and the flexibility of our model to deliver during a period of unprecedented growth. This, while also successfully executing on an acquisition that added to our specialty power portfolio, expanded our TAM and is already contributing to our top and bottom line."""

Advanced Energy is a solid company and a good choice any industrial growth in the economy. The stock appears to be in a consolidation phase due to rate at which the price appreciated over the last 12 to 16 months. This is a very reasonable entry point (~ $64/share) for anyone wanting to open a long position in AEIS. It is also a reasonable price at which to add to a long position.
