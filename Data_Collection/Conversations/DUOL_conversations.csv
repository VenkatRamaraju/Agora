"The technology they use to power their language assessment tools uses a lot of cutting edge Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing tool kits. Plus they have a team of impressively credentialed data scientists working for them to continuously improve their products...This is a great long-term hold."
Boo yah
"The job postings coinciding with the IPO provide some insight into DUOL's future. It seems like they're looking to add high quality video, featuring native speakers, paired with AI to creative more premium interaction. Current build offers the quizzes and audio lessons. Interactive video lessons likely on deck. So users could simulate real conversation. Lots of super high tech behavioral ML stuff happening behind the scenes. It is also not impossible to see a cross-lingual social network as a subsequent step. Once a user is comfortable conversing with app, they could then get paired up with other humans. Duolingo already has the user profiles, backend, and is collecting massive data. Only a guess, but I see this flopping around post-IPO, then a clearer sense of direction around the earnings call. Free-to-paid conversion is important to follow. English test is important to follow. Engagement is important too - users with a 365 day streak are users who have seen 365 days of ads (w/X ads per day). Short-term rollercoaster, long-term hold."
"well.. picked a couple up this morning, its overvalued but figured it would prob run to 160 today. shall see"
Will be $83.6132 soon
Duolingo is up 4.90% to 141.03
Love the app. Don’t love the valuation. No bueno.
$55 mil in revenue and a $5b + valuation right now what is going on here??
"$140 are you crazy people? I love the app and want to buy it, but this must be more like $80ish"
I didn't win the share splitting lottery :(
"Love and use Duolingo daily, but I can’t bring myself to invest in the company at $102; I’ll plan an entry point for longterm IF it drops between $65-75."
"Yeah, okay. Let's see how long this piece of junk lasts.It is a lousy website program with no user support whatsoever. The problems are posted in the comments to the lessons and date back well over 2 years. Whomever valued this website needs their head examined. They are idiots. This company is absolutely NOT worth this.Let's see how many new subscribers they lure into this nest. Check the discussion boards - more and more people were leaving the site because of its problems.Time will tell. Oh, the owners will make money, but let's just see how this develops."
#$%$ IPO. Giving certain people access to IPO then allowing them to dump at the open. don't be a bagholder.
"I like Duolingo - very much. When I took foreign language courses in both High School and College, they were far from my favorite subject. But now, years later, I love learning on Duolingo. They way that they present the lessons is fun and I have learned a lot in my four years of taking lessons in four different languages. After reading some of the other comments I just had to comment."
Duolingo is up 5.33% to 126.51
little green parrot waves at me nightly in Dutch...

"According to Duolingo report in 2020, there is only 15 million users in China, the isolated country in IT don't have more power to put pressure on this stock."
We should have a look see at $150 tomorrow. No sweat. Robinhood IPOs. This one and CLEAR SECURE (YOU) are WINNERS! 150 tomorrow!
What happens when computers can do near to perfect translation?
Rather jump-like movement this week
So glad to see stock is taking off. Best App around!
"She is eating bread, he is drinking water."
When can I short this ie not hard to borrow
Chinese govt is cracking down on education platform co. Will probably shut them down as well
Will open @$98
I have no idea why this stock is valued so much: target $50
wow. way overvalued.
E*TRADE doesn’t have shares to short. Do you know why? Is it because it’s a new company or too many shorts already?
I’ve been using Duo since Feb. 2014. It is an amazing app. that has not only grown from the original learning tree to multiple learning tools but grown the user base to 500 million! The moat it has is huge. That moat is multiple languages on one app that is free with advertising based revenue. This company is a winner. It may be over priced now due to the initial public offering enthusiasm. User base will continue to grow and advertising revenues will grow along with that.
Another Chinese scam pushing shares up. Valuation is too high 35-40 is where it should be.
"I was immediately reaching to buy button when I see the IPO news, but the price :-{. I was expecting to see $5-7 with a lot of potential or $10-15 with a much smaller upside or even $20-25 without an upside but I was ready to support this company because I like their. But $140 is really way too much. Wish them luck but realistically looking for a big correction in 2-3 months when IPO investors are « allowed » to sell"
The CMU connection making it a Buy rating
I have no problem with the current price. It will continue to go up. I only wish I could have afforded more than 14 at $102. Will buy more. This is a no brainer.
"How long will Duo remain free? Maybe, I can trade some lingots for shares. haha"
Middle East….. forget it! Who cares when LINGO IS A BINGO! Put me up a glass of black label and order me an Asian broad. I’m getting lose tonight and studying my GERMAN!
Love the app -its a keeper

Around a 10 x price to sales ratio.Even high growth tech companies have lower ratio's. Avoid.
This is Muy Bueno..........I think!
IPO at $102
"Haven't looked at the financials, but I'm figuring there's a 6-month lockup and the stock will tank after that, if not before. Would be attractive at a lower valuation as the app is first-rate.Most IPOs are losers."
I have been using duolingo for the last 7 years and it has had virtually zero improvements to its interface or improvements in add ons/ features. I've always thought it had lazy management and I'm surprised no other companies have competed with what it offers. Given that it hasn't done anything to really grow its product in such a long time gives me little faith that it suddenly will go to the moon.. unless google steps in and spins it around.
I love Duolingo but they’re platform still seems so ideologically free to use. Do they have any additional revenue streams other than their optional subscription service?
"This will close below $30 tomorrow, easy play."
Why so expensive?
See you at 20 dollars in three months.
ummm ... 137 ?!?! yikes .let this calm down
Why is this sudden jump? +9.5% as this moment.

"Who on his or her right mind will buy this instead of Airbnb let's say... So Google ads are our main source of income, what's the next IPO, personal blogs of videovlogers?"
"Wow way overpriced, even Rosetta stone a much better language learning option had no success. Bag holders are warned."
Duolingo is up 5.33% to 130.62
I think each lingot is worth about $10K.
"It is an OK app, but this has no moat or any other source of income other than ads and a membership fee that 0.5% of users pay. I cannot see the valuation of 500+ million for an app that loses money. This is only to let insiders sell and get rich"

just a thought when facebook came out analyst said to stay away as they didn't work out the advertising revenue also they had less than a billion users at the time. Duolingo has the ads and subscriptions only account for 5% of revenue. interesting to see how high this goes. Good luck to them.
