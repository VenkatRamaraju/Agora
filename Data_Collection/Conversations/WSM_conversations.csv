its going to 68.34 tomorrow
Goldman Sachs wanted to get in cheaper so they downgraded WSM in hopes people would sell and everyone is BUYING WSM
"WSM is one of my best stocks, WSM has never disappointed me and the dividend is being raised. Huge gains today. Shorts should cover quickly"
Any news?
"Mark, I will disagree with that assessment, the stock and the company are still performing well in what is a very tough retail sector right now, at least as far as Wall Street goes. The consumer is very strong, yet every false narrative in the world is being pushed out by analysts and financial news media to portray a weak retail sector. Also, I believe the C-suite at WSM is very strong. Right now the price is starting to drop as the shorts which there are a lot, are covering just in case it does jump tomorrow, though I will admit, I doubt it will."
"Loaded 500 more shares, expecting big things from WSM today, my brother in law is high up at WSM and they are all excited about earnings today"
"This is the WSM I've come to know and love though hate at the same time, it will be back to pre earnings number by late next week, so typical. Yet the analysts who follow this pump up RH while trashing this and WSM is twice the company that RH is."
"Boy, I didn't see this one coming, well actually I did."
"The MRK cv19 pill could change the entire calculus on the virus, it might be that people who were afraid of the jab might be less concerned about a pill. In any case, I see this as a bright sign on the covid story."
"In the last 24 hours I made over 112,000 with WSM shares and calls, thank GOD I did not listen to Goldman Sachs and their lying downgrade to benefit themselves"
Peeps. You should see the furniture on pottery barn. One of a kind. They have someone make it for you. Incredibly trendy. Way out on delivery but revenue generated right away. No overhead really. On line. Take a gander
I heard about WSM the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Kennedy, I couldn't agree more. WSM is a class act stock always makes me money"
What is this 6%+ drop all about? I'm trying to find a reason/news and see nothing?
thank you for not posting...
"Great earnings, who thinks it will go back to $69.00 tomorrow?"
WSM SMASHES EARNINGS!!!!!
"NVDA, from your call sign I would thought you should know better, only after they have pumped up the tech sector and the industrial sector to their max saturation point will they shift sectors, at that point they will start to pump retail and then we shall see some positive movement, until that time though, the only direction is down, regardless of how solid and strong this company is, which I completely agree with."
"This is no TSLA, the stock is valued like it's going to Mars. Way, way overprices. Soon it will settle at arounf 150 as the top specialty store category. MARK MY WORD."
There is chatter on PIR Conversations regarding WSM looking at/possibly bidding for PIR buyout. Credit Suisse has been engaged for that purpose by PIR. There are symbiotic areas of interest I will agree with. Are there any folks watching WSM that have a similar point of view?
I wish I could buy the dip here

people will continue buying quality furnishings and comfort items....cash flow continues after earnings also....!
great earnings! $3.85 vs $3.39. beat revenue by 110 million. announced increased dividend and 1 billion stock buy back. Great job!
"You buy before earnings and you sell at the open the following day, always good for a quick ten percent gain."
"Shaggy I made over 112,000 at open after earnings with my calls Get in get out"
Pre-earnings stock abusement in process. Big money dropping price to create tremendous entry point for what will be exceptional earnings report. TJX just confirmed that brick and mortar retail is here to stay at least for this decade.
"Good time to buy in about another half hour, or when you start to see the price start to climb a bit, this is the usual manipulation pattern of the stock, better buy now, it is starting to recover, ride it up into the close and then sell again."
Don't give up on this company
"Does anyone know of an ETF or Spdr that holds WSM and several of the other consumer stocks that have been on fire such as LULU, RH and ULTA"
