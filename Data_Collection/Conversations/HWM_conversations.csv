"Let’s not forgot John Plant gets a $20 million dollar bonus, if he gets the stock to $30!!!"
Who’s with me to 30 fellas? Let’s get this bread
"So all of a sudden in the 11th hour, potential bidders are now becoming skittish due to the company's potential liability in the Genfell Tower fire last year and that's the reason bid price(s) has been reduced??-they weren't aware of this all along when potential bids of $28-$30 were being discussed-something doesn't sound right here"
"Arconic Inc (NYSE:ARNC) – Equities research analysts at Jefferies Financial Group boosted their FY2018 earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Arconic in a report released on Thursday, February 7th. Jefferies Financial Group analyst M. Englert now expects that the basic materials company will post earnings per share of $1.33 for the year, up from their previous forecast of $1.31. Jefferies Financial Group has a “Buy” rating and a $25.00 price target on the stock. Jefferies Financial Group also issued estimates for Arconic’s Q4 2018 earnings at $0.30 EPS."
A Buyout ?
Doesn’t instill much confidence when a company cans the CEO two days before the earnings announcement.
"Beat on revenue, EPS, full year outlook! Massive sell off!!!What gives?Any body knows why?"
"How could John Plant keep a straight face asking employees to give up their rudimentary benefits while they know he will pocket every penny of what they are giving up??!! The irony is that he needs that money much less than the people he is stealing from. What kind of leadership is that? How does he expect employees respect and trust him when they see a greedy old man pick pocketing their money? How does BOD let such an obvious misuse of power and trust happen? What happened to their ethics? Investors are not dumb; they know $776 mil capex spent and $1 Bil incremental revenue growth in 2018 did not add a penny to the bottom, WHY? They know employees’ cost cutting is not sustainable. It may artificially boost earnings for one year giving the con man at the top some hope to clear his $50 mil golden parachute, but I doubt investors would fall for that. Investors heard a clueless incoherent old man disconnected from reality with no concrete action plan after one year of “strategy review”. He had “some ideas” to kill time and committed to produce NO results other than a “plan” to do after he is gone with everybody’s money. I am so baffled how this could happen in day light and nobody does or can do anything about it, other than selling their shares and walk away with substantial loss."
"As Grenfell Tower aftermath unfolds, Apollo nears Arconic mega-dealBy Kevin DowdJanuary 7, 2019 View comments (3) Share:￼A yellow memorial ribbon for fire victims is pinned to a tree, with Grenfell Tower visible in the background. (Getty Images)In June 2017, a malfunctioning refrigerator sparked a fire at the Grenfell Tower apartment building in London. The blaze quickly engulfed the 24-story structure, ultimately resulting in 72 deaths and one of the largest residential disasters in recent British history.Later government investigation attributed the rapid spread of the flames to the building's poorly made cladding, a type of siding, which later tests showed was so combustible that it essentially turned the apartment into one giant, deadly tinderbox. The company that made that cladding was Arconic.It perhaps wasn't a surprise when, less than a year later, Arconic announced a strategic review, with reports indicating that it could sell the building products unit that made the aluminum panels involved in the Grenfell Tower disaster. Within months, prompted in part by continuing activist pressure from Elliott Management, talk turned to a wholesale takeover of the company.It perhaps also wasn't a surprise that several private equity firms showed interest—despite a number of looming lawsuits, criminal investigations and potential liabilities that could hamstring the business in the future. Blackstone, The Carlyle Group and KKR were among the heavyweights to sniff around the building products unit, with Arconic describing the potential mega-deal as an effort to refocus its operations on building aluminum components for aerospace and auto companies rather than the construction market. But when the subject changed to a full buyout, Apollo Global Management emerged as the front-runner, with a potential price tag reported to be some $11 billion (or up to $20 billion including debt). While Arconic's direct involvement in a tragic, avoidable disaster that cost dozens of innocent lives is almost surely one factor behind the sale, another very obvious one is the presence of Elliott. The hedge fund won representation on Arconic's board in early 2017 after a pitched battle and the ouster of former CEO Klaus Kleinfeld. The aluminum company's stock price has continued to slide throughout 2018, which in Elliott's mind seems to only cement the need for a complete leadership overhaul. Apollo's management thought a deal with Arconic could have been signed as soon as December, according to a New York Post report from the final day of 2018. But the buyout's final hurdle is proving to be the continued tightening of global debt markets, raising doubt as to whether banks would be able to finance a deal as large as what Apollo and Arconic have in mind. Apollo is also believed to be considering a $40 billion move on the GE's aviation leasing business, an even larger deal that will surely encounter similar concerns. A lack of available funding could very well endanger prospective Apollo deals worth $60 billion in total.The role Arconic's shoddy products played in the horrific events at Grenfell Tower make it painfully clear that major changes of some sort are needed at the company. Whether a private equity firm is the correct group to make those changes could be a matter for debate. But if the debt markets cooperate, then Leon Black and Apollo seem poised to be the ones navigating the transformations, lawsuits and reckonings that are almost surely ahead."
I have a strong feeling Monday will be the day.
"Longbow Research's Chris Olin upgraded Arconic from Neutral to Buy with a new $24 price target.The ThesisThree takeaways from Longbow Research's survey of tier-three and tier-four aerospace suppliers support the bullish case for Arconic and the specialty materials group as a whole, Olin said in a Thursday upgrade note. (See his track record here.)Respondents showed an acceleration in top-line growth from 13-15 percent in the third quarter to 15-18 percent in the fourth quarter. This was due to increased sourcing from jet engine manufacturers and a favorable shift toward next-generation platforms, the analyst said.Several of the smaller forging respondents indicated they are facing constrained production capacity, Olin said. This trend is likely to ""protect"" Arconic's aerospace and defense market share at a time when management is addressing its forge press outages, he said. Lower aluminum prices could help Arconic's margin performance in all three of business segments, Olin said. This would mark a reversal from 2018, when raw material input prices had a negative EPS impact of 14 cents per share.Aside from the survey results, Arconic's stock likely has downside protection of around $17 per share due to continued M&A speculation, the analyst said. The company could be attractive to both a private equity buyer and a large commercial aerospace or jet engine maker looking to better control its flow of materials, in Longbow's view."
Well our money will be freed up soon. Hopefully we can go shopping for some bargains while the market is down.
"Can anyone please tell me if, after the split, Howmet Aerospace and Arconic Corporation will give dividends?"
"What baffles me is with this kind of news and stock on a anticipated deal, the stock price would be trading with quite a bit volatility. Unless a no deal was 100% priced in."
If they begin reviewing the offers next week we should know something definitive on or before Friday 12-7JMHO
"I predict with turning down the offer, we will see a strong earnings report. I'll also predict that Elliot will push for the sale of the rolling division. This will leave Arconic as a true aerospace company once they have divested for rolling and construction divisions."
"In his annual letter to shareholders on Saturday, Warren Buffet announced a huge $11 billion write-down on Precision Cast Parts, which Berkshire purchased in 2016 for $37 billion. Precision makes parts for the aircraft industry and is a direct competitor with Howmet. Buffet admitted that they greatly overpaid for Precision and have cut 10,000 employees as part of a restructuring of the company as they anticipate lower demand for aircraft parts going forward.Any opinions out there on what impact, if any, the problems facing Precision will have on Howmet? I don't recall hearing about massive job cuts at Howmet, so does that mean that they have somehow weathered the downturn in the airline industry better than Precision? Also, what percentage of Howmet's revenue comes from the manufacture of aircraft parts? Have their other businesses effectively cushioned the impact from the downturn in the commercial airline industry? Is Howmet a major player in the defense industry?Many companies who have eliminated business travel during the pandemic and have resorted to meeting via Zoom and other platforms have indicated that they plan to significantly cut business travel in the future after the pandemic ends to save money. Business travel is one of the most profitable business segment for the airlines. This does not bode well for the profitability of the airlines going forward, which potentially translates into fewer purchases of new planes, which potentially means lower sales for Howmet.If my analysis is wrong, I would appreciate the opinions of others on this board."
HON makes offer 26/share? what a fun move that would make!
Not one of the news reporting outlets has named a source that the deal to buy the company is imminent and neither Arconic or Apollo will comment either.....has got to make someone a bit suspicious about what is happening.If a deal is not announced in the next few days then I would suggest that this has all been about nothing other than that the traders have been making a lot of money buying and selling the dips.JMO 
Howmet Aerospace is down 5.76% to 31.10
I think its a great opp to accumulate ARNC for a long haul. Its at a very bargain price.
The fact that the company did not sell at this price indicates that the value is much higher than what is being offered. If we are patient I believe we will all be rewarded in the longer-term.
"The construction products business accounts for about 15% of Arconic’s sales. So the arrangement of this part of business is actually very meaningful in this deal now. If Elliott takes over the construction business and gives shareholders $2.5 per share, then the total value of the deal would be $24 (=$21.5+$2.5) per share."
HON is interested in buying of ARNC.
"Hey, HON, UTX, and Carlyle -- ARNC can be had for $23. Apollo did the el-cheapo due diligence, so you know the price is right. Anything at $23 or above, and the BOD will take it. Let's make a deal!"
No deal
Isn't it interesting that all the naysayers on this board have gone silent now that the stock is back on an upswing.
"Apollo (APO) to acquire Arconic (ARNC) has been agreed upon, sources tell Bloomberg, but the two are said to be discussing a deal at about $22 per share..."
Nice Beat!... and guidance too...
"2019 eps now $1.75 to $1.90 a share; at a mkt avg of 15 p/e, thats a target price range of $26.25 to $28.50. According to Fidelity, the industrial sector currently runs an average P/E multiple of 23. If you applied that to ARNC, you get a target price of between $40.25 to $43.70."

"NEWS STORY JUST HIT A deal that was supposed to be the biggest leveraged buyout of 2018 has been delayed into next year by recent turmoil in the credit markets, The Post has learned.Billionaire Leon Black’s Apollo Global Management was hoping in December to sign a roughly $20 billion deal to buy Arconic, the New York-based, aluminum-parts maker that mostly serves the aerospace industry, sources close to the talks said.Worries over liabilities about last year’s Grenfell tower disaster in London had recently complicated negotiations, as an Arconic subsidiary had supplied construction panels that were blamed for the quick spread of the fire that killed 72 people in June 2017.As reported by The Post, Paul Singer’s Elliott Management, which is spearheading the Arconic sale, has recently agreed to shoulder the Grenfell liabilities despite continued criminal investigations and questions from British politicians about Arconic’s role.Nevertheless, insiders pointed to the quick and unexpected tightening credit markets for the delayed deal.“Would you commit to raise $14 billion in this market?” a source said. “There is no market to finance a buyout of that size.”Indications are that Apollo would move if the markets were to loosen, the source said.The leveraged loan market is experiencing similar outflows to the S&P 500 index, which has plunged 15 percent since its Sept. 21 apex. Less leverage for buyouts means fewer public companies will be taken private, and those that do will attract lower prices.“You’ve seen massive retail loan mutual fund outflows,” said the head of capital markets at a large lender, referring to funds run by firms like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. “The sell-off has been quite dramatic throughout the course of December.”Next month, banks are planning to syndicate loans for two large completed buyouts — a $6.9 billion buyout of Dun & Bradstreet, and a $13.2 billion buyout of Johnson Controls’ battery business — that closed in November. How they fare will be a bellwether for the leveraged-loan scene, the capital markets boss said.If Barclays, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan for example, cannot sell their loans to fund the Johnson buyout, or have to sell them well below par, the banks will get slammed with the losses.“If they go poorly, the whole markets will be re-priced,” the source said. “I think the banks will lose money if they launch (Monday), January 7th.”Thomson’s Lipper & Wealth Management reports that December’s $9.4 billion in net outflows is the largest since it began tracking loan funds in 2003."
"The following article is dated October 31, 2018 and states that the other interested party needed three additional weeks to do due diligence. Three weeks from 10/31 will put us at November 20 and hopefully a competitive offer will materialize shortly thereafter.We will have to wait and see, of course, but it is interesting to note that they have not publicly accepted the offer from Apollo Group as of today."
"They were hoping to wrap-up a deal by next Tuesday, 1/15 so I would think we might hear some news today or Monday.JMO"
"It seems like the ex-HR executive could not live with the unethical shame of cutting of employees benefits and passing on the savings to a senile clueless greedy Englishman. Plant brought in an old body to figure out how to cut more employees benefit to ensure few more fat cats at the top pocket millions more. The 2000 Pounds elephant in the room is the eroding margins sitting at 5% deficit to industry benchmark. They need to bring experienced reputable executive who can close the deteriorating margin gap, not an infamous GE corporate reject. Closing the margin gap would automatically double valuation and there will be no need for shameless accounting gimmicks. By splitting, Arconic management conceded their incompetence to close the margin gap, as they hope somebody else will do it after they “SELL” the post split companies. Wall street strategist gurus billed 10s of millions of dollars for strategy review with NO results and will be milking these bunch of senile clueless management 100s of millions more to split the company. Then we will have two POS companies with below par operating margins instead of one and the greedy Englishman will be long gone with his 45-50 million stolen money from employees and investors. Market players know extent of this management incompetence and would never pay even close to market price for anything this clueless management has to sell like the CSB business they are trying to sell for the last 10 months. This is a classic case of corruption, incompetence and betrayal of employees and investors and I am sure it will be case study in MBA programs in the near future.I do not know what more it takes before we see some genuine investors activism to put an end to this nightmare."
$1B Buy back means more than 59M shares. That's a LOT OF SHARES. It will bring up the PPS to $23's at least when it gets completed.
We should be at $25 to $30 by December
"Even though there was a small miss by .01 on earnings, analysts probably realized without the Boeing problems earnings would have been beat plus company provided solid guidance for the upcoming year-I think the price will fluctuate between $30- $32.00 until the next earnings date"
"This thing should be trading in the high 20s/close to 30 based on most tangible metrics. It doesn’t make sense, something is artificially depressing the price. Either way I’m holding this till the end."
Down another 55 cents in pre-market. Any ideas as to why the free fall?
To the BOD of Arconic:What is the status of the April 1 split into Arconic and Howmet Aerospace? It is your responsibility to report equally to all shareholders.
"Zach’s posts a “strong sell” after ARNC craters, and then it goes up over 15% that day. Valuable advice, indeed!"
How many of you think that all offers have been yanked off the table with the recent collapse of the stock market and Arconic in particular?
"I strongly believe this market is on tight coil spring and it will explode upwards unexpectedly and so fast that the shorts will have no time to recover. People are waiting for capitulation which will not happen because there is no fundamental crisis to make it happen. There is simply nothing wrong with the market. The only thing can rock the market further is the unpredictable Trump. By calling back of troops from Syria and other countries is making me scared. Maybe he is upto something which we don't know and other people know. Another reason for this market attitude is Tariff situation with Huawei issue. I am afraid that could be a huge problem. USA is trying to pressurize china into trade agreement is not like something you can engineer or work hard to achieve your goals, this is simply trying to change a culture into accepting a defeat which they find it intolerable."
The price drop is crazy. Apollo was willing to pay $22/share for the company and must have thought it was worth at least that to make the deal. The change in CEO was only because he wanted the sale and the board did not believing it was worth more.
"Maybe my view of the potential buyout is too simplistic, but if this company is truly worth $30/Share or more, why are they even entertaining offers n$23-$25??-the company has beat analyst estimates for the last 4 quarters- why not just continue on with the business as usual and let the company/shareholders reap the benefits down the road???"
Plant got his HUGE millions $ bonus but is still not honoring performance based bonuses for the worker bees.
32 before earnings
for 2019 Arconic management forecast $200 mil in cost reduction and $120 mil positive impact of lower aluminum cost and $80 mil due to incremental revenue adding up to $400 mil positive incremental EBIT or $100 mil per quarter. If we assume they did not lie or steal money we should expect 15 cents incremental net earning relative to Q4-2018 or 48 cents EPS for Q1-2019. market does not believe the $50 mil CEO can deliver anything more than the dividend cut of 4 cents or flat results Q/Q. we'll find out in 4 weeks.
"APO can go to open market and buy 51% of the shares to acquire this company fare and square. In that case they have to pay close to $30 to pick up all those share. The $22 offer was a result of an inside mole named Paul Singer and we are lucky the BOD finally pulled the plug on their plot. PE would only pay if they see an easy 30% return which they would have got at $22 per share. That is why they will not pay market price and Arconic BOD should never consider PEs and should look for industry partners to pay market price+ premium for scale and market access. The London fire and pension liabilities were overblown to hammer down valuation. Arconic can shoulder liability of the London fine, insignificant amount if anything, if they get a market price for it which should be about 1.5 Billion and use proceeds to retire debt and more share buyback."
"those who sold today in the low 19s should have been more patient. Those selling now, should also remain patient. Wait until the actual deal is announced...."
The table is set. Share price driven down enough for Honeywell to step in with an offer. IMO

"What chances there still could be a deal?.....0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%"
"Quote from NYPOST article which is what I have been saying about collusion of APO/Elliott and inside moles on the board and Chip. This is the extent of the corruption to pull off a $5 billion corporate heist. Credit Suisse on Monday gave the company a boost, saying it “made the correct decision in our view to not sell out to private equity in what became an un-competitive process.”"
Yay  finally above 30.00 let’s see how high we can go from here

why is it telling me its up almost 3000 percent?
"Dear investors, BREAKING NEWS: Just came in on the status of the strategic review: As a token of appreciation and Christmas gifts, Arconic BOD has decided to extend the strategic review indefinitely. Over the last 3 months, Mr. Blanksinkship and the supper efficient BOD were fully consumed to develop strategy to fix the outage of one of their presses in their Ohio plant. The management team was caught off guard as they had no idea manufacturing equipment could go down or may require repair and maintenance. Mr. Blanksinkship has hired 4 new VPs to study the repair strategy who are expecting to report their findings by mid 2020. As a result, Arconic will take a $300 mil charge in 2019 to finish comprehensive review of the equipment for partial repair, complete repair or replacement which will be installed by the end of 2024. Thank you for your patience as we are transitioning to the bright and prosperous future with the divine guidance of Mr. Paul Singer and other parasite crooks in private equity markets."
Elliott at one point in time estimated the value of $33 to $55 dollars per share.
So are we buying today? Looks like a great buying opportunity.
Does anybody else think we are setting up to test $25?
They are selling shares soon. sell and buy it back cheaper
Let’s go arconic let’s go!! Would really like to see this stock around 35.00!!
"here's a link to a new article - it says that nobody has signed a binding offer without arconinc ridding itself of the liability related to the grenfell fire - i don't know how you do that without getting a huge insurance policy to cover it and that would surely cost a lot since nobody knows how much the liability will be - if anybody has an idea, please post it. in the meantime - the potential buyers think the liability is huge and there is no binding offer in place. so paul singer is going to find a way out - his first idea didn't work. he broke up one good mediocre company into one decent one and one bad one. https://nypost.com/2018/11/14/paul-singer-sees-path-to-arconic-sale-despite-grenfell-tower-fire/"
"$11 billion is less than 8 times next year EDITDA, the minimum market multiplier for transactions of this kind is 10 times EBITDA which puts ARCONIC valuation in low 30s which happens to be the low end of the valuation Elliott had on this company when they were harassing shareholders everyday with presentations and expensive flash DVRs to take control of this company. Does anybody knows where they are hiding?"
"Aerospace-parts maker Arconic Inc. is the subject of takeover interest from private-equity firms, according to people familiar with the matter.

"Dear Arconic investors,We are few weeks from Q4 earning report and 2019 outlook. Investors and employees of Arconic have paid dearly for lack of transparency and accountability by senior management of Arconic since the appointment of Mr. BlankenshipThis is our limited chance to make our voices heard by senior management. Please focus of posting ONLY comments related to our demand for transparency and accountability and REFRAIN diluting our message by posting non-related material in the next few weeks. Let’s have few hundred comments all about the same topic hoping to get some traction with management before Q4 report. Here are list of some of questions investors are expecting to hear clear response from Mr. Blankenship in Q4 report:1- ROI on $750 Mil capex investment, this shows effectiveness of management decision process. Explain, excluding AL price impact, why Y/Y margins deteriorated in 2018/2017?2- In Q1-2018, Mr. Blankenship promptly cut $200 Mil off of 2018 EPS due to higher AL cost. AL mid-west delivery is $500 less per ton in 2019, relative to Q1-18, which should be $400+ Mil positive impact on EBITDA. Does Blankenship commit to this assessment, if not why?3- What is status of the $500 Mil share buyback that was announced in Q1-2018? If none was bought back specially during Q3 when shares traded in the $17/18 range, then why?4- Based on Q3 report, there was “robust interest in the Construction business”. What is the status? Quantify the risk of the London fire. There has to be a clear understanding of the exposure after spending $30 Mil in legal fees associated with that event.5- Based on improvements in AL prices/ operational efficiencies and opportunistic share buyback, Arconic should forecast about $2.5 EPS and $800+ Mil cash flow, if not why? 6- Why Arconic does not buyout Elliott’s 10% interest and focus on improving the 5% operational margin gaps like other well run companies as oppose to this buyout circus with Elliott and Apollo? What is Elliott’s price point to exit Arconic?THANK YOU All, hope this attempt works!!"
"Apollo Global Management (APO) is close to a deal to acquire Arconic (ARNC) valued at approximately $22 a share, or $10.6B, the New York Post reports, citing sources.

I heard from a friend at Arconic today that they laid off 90 employees at the Pittsburgh corporate center and 100 at the Arconic Technical Center. Looks like new CEO is beginning to earn his shares by cutting overhead.
It is like watching paint dry!
JP Morgan moves to overweight with a price target of $30 today.
buy back will cont to drive prices higher its as simple as that
"It is funny how some people think we should have taken what might have been the most insulting offer to buyout a company in history. They board couldn't approve the sale at this price because there would have been lawsuits up to the wazoo. The price of this stock should already be in the mid 20's and anyone near the deal know this. Earning last quarter were announced BEFORE the buyout offers were made and that brought the stock to 19 and a half. So without a buyout on the table ARNC should be $20-$25 a share. These low ball offers have actually been holding down the price and literally everybody knows it. Sell at this fear level at your own peril. I have been in some stocks that have had some bad days, this is not a bad day for ARNC, it just looks like one. That too will change."
Buyout announcement would be soon. $29
"I’m down $12,000 this morning, but I’m as happy as a lark. The buyout price was horrible and stock will rise."
"Chairman and CEO John C. Plant acquired 105,000 shares of this lightweight metals company, paying $18.51 per share for a total amount of $1.94 million."
why does this company need 11 board members? 2 too many.
"Apollo is only buying the engineered products division for $22, black stone/ Carlyle is going to buy the GRP division for $10 and Elliott is getting the building division for $2. That’s a total of $34/share."
Sure hope Plant announces another share buy back at the next earnings call. Stock is a bargain as the commercial aircraft market prepares for the upcoming rebound.
When they use the money to buy back shares and ignore the people who worked to make the company that money things will eventually turn south. But of course shareholders or even ceo's for that matter can't see past their own noses and don't care about the long haul?
"I think we need to take a step back and consider the facts. No one is pumping and dumping and Elliott isn’t gaming to sell at market prices. They are an insider on the deal it is legally impossible for them to be doing that. So what do we know (1) there is an offer on the table (2) there is a structure which appears to work (3) This deal is one of the most leaky I’ve ever seen. So considering the above if the deal was dead it is highly likely we would know. Think about it, almost all agencies are on this: Reuters, Bloomberg, CNBC, WSJ, NYP."
"This stock should already be trading in the mid to high 20s based on where market is and the 2019 EPS. The only reason it is stuck at $22 is the year long discussions about selling this company at $22 in a corrupt collusion between Paul Singer and Apollo with the help of their inside mole Chip Blankenship. Chip and Singer should both be behind bar for corporate fraud as investors are left with the carnage they created. Aluminum is cheaper today and EPS is 20% higher than last January when stock was trading at $31, so what gives? That is the net impact of Chip and Singer $5 Bil value destruction and Chip got $5 mil reward which is one million for every Billion he destroyed. If this was not high finance corporate fraud, I do not know what is?"
Arconic upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Longbow...
imo there are several co that. will buy this
Another large buy back approved by the Board. Woo-hoo!!
Nice solid beat across the board - all metrics continue to move upward.
paul singer get us a good deal
There is something wrong with this picture as normally a stock will trade close to the price someone has announced they are willing to pay.....in this case $22 - $23JMHO
"Hey, does Howmet still have 2 full time CEO's? Wondering as I ponder my investment options....Anyone know?"
"Adding here we might have a weekend announcement, Think their in final stages of the buyout"
A good dose of say-do in todays earnings announcement. Believe that this is a good leading indicator for others in aero and the higher tiers.
"The $22 is the old Bloomberg referenced price. The latest Bloomberg article states that ""the price hasn't been agreed upon yet."" Since ARNC turned down $23, I think it will be a bit higher than the old $22...to say the least...buckle up!"
Plant got his HUGE millions $ bonus but only approves small (not even close to keeping up with the cost of living) raises for the worker bees. He only cares about the stock price for his own selfish gain. Sad.
"The confusion is warranted. In 2015, Alcoa Inc announced its plan to split. In 2016, Alcoa Inc renamed itself Arconic Inc and created a separate company called Alcoa Corp that owned the bauxite, alumina and aluminum businesses. In 2019, Arconic Inc made a similar decision. Arconic Inc renamed itself Howmet Aerospace and created a separate company called Arconic Corp. All of this was based on the intent that separately, these companies would worth more...thus creating shareholder value. It is easy to see this has not materialized. This can be easily proven by adding the market caps of the three companies. Howmet Aerospace is $5B, Arconic Corp is $1B and Alcoa Corp is $1.4B. Since early 2000, the sad truth, Alcoa Inc and now its three children have done nothing but destroyed shareholder value."
"Dear Arconic investors, Please read this: If the rumor of an imminent Apollo buyout for $22 is true for all except Elliott who will roll his interest into the new privately held company, then just ask yourself a simple following question:What does Elliott plan to do after the buyout that CANNOT do without the buyout?The answer is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. The only motive is substantial discounted stock price at $22 which they know for sure will bring them a 40% return in less than a year when they resell Arconic in whole or in parts at fair market value. If true, there are only three words responsible for one of the most egregious breach of corporate fiduciary responsibilities I know of: BODs, Elliott and Blankenship. I believe BODs will ultimately be held responsible for their betrayal to protect shareholders interest. Here are the facts Elliott doesn’t want you to know: A $750 mil in 2018 capex and $500 per tone lower 2019 AL delivery price will improve operating margins by at least 3 to 4 % or $400+ Mil more EBITDA for 2019, not to mention the $2 Bil cash on the 2018 balance-sheet which half of it should definitely be used to buyout Elliott’s interest or retire 50 Mil common shares which means about $2.5 EPS for 2019 or mid $30 stock price at 15 times PE multiples. Paul Singer understands these numbers and that is why he is in such a rush to close this deal ASAP. To pull off this obvious corporate heist, he is relying on compromised BODs and uninformed investors with the help from insiders who are either utterly incompetent or co conspirators like Blankenship. Please do not fall for this scam, demand accountability and transparency from BODs. Q4 results and 2019 commitment shall be the last chance to make or break for Blankenship."
I wonder how much downside risk if announcement comes out that deal is not happening.
"ARNC listening to shareholders with REAL sense of urgency, per last article:""Spending cuts at specialty metals product manufacturer Arconic Inc. will hit compensation, staffing and operating expenses, president and COO Elmer Doty told employees in a letter Thursday.Moreover, the company has already trimmed capital investment this year by more than 25 percent while moving ahead with plans to split operations. Regular merit increases for Arconic’s salaried employees worldwide have been eliminated along with other pay and benefit reductions, according to the letter.The company said it created a limited budget for senior leaders to reward high performance and contractual increases would continued to be honored. But Mr. Doty faulted shareholders for the challenges facing the company.“Our financial performance has been deemed wholly unacceptable by our shareholders,” Mr. Doty wrote. “We must repair our financial performance and do it quickly.”"
"No matter how you slice it, a deal of $22 for ALL ARNC will not go through ... it will be either rejected by BOD or disapproved by sharehlders. There must be something else for the construction products business, which accounts 15% of total revenue."
"Buyout between $27-$32 most likely, IMO"
"Another new high today. We're well on our way to $30. Q3 earnings report should be interesting, particularly the guidance they provide for the remainder of the year."
"The real reason BOD rejected the buyout last minute had much to do with the flawed deal and class action lawsuits that would have followed to block this corrupt transaction. Elliott colluded with APO and leaked false information to the public like $1 Billion London fire and $2.5 Billion pension liabilities to hammer down valuation to acquire the company 30% less than its intrinsic value which is the short term return target for Private equities to justify investment. They relied on inside moles like Dennis Miller and 2 other board members and Chip Blankenship who literally wiped out $5 Billion of equity with his utter incompetence or planned destruction to bring valuation to a 30 years low. January 2018, Arconic was trading at $31. Two events happened to Arconic that could explain the current $18 price. 1) Appointment of Chip, 2) rise of AL prices. AL is trading $100 less per ton now than last year at this time and $500 per ton less than what Chip had forecasted at Q1. That will eliminate AL as a factor to explain 40% drop in stock which leaves Chip and his ineffective leadership and poor execution as the only factor contributing to the 40% drop. Chip has one final chance to come clean with Q4 results and 2019 outlook. Investors are expecting 36 cents EPS for Q4 and $2+ EPS and $800+ million cash flow for 2019. He should resign or be fired if he cannot execute and deliver results. Paul Singers lied to investors about his intentions in his flashy video mails and 300 pages of power point presentations. His collusion with APO to take the company private in a LBO transaction is the most brutal form of acquisitions to the employees of a company is in sharp contrast to what he had promised. His involvement with Arconic has produced nothing but disaster, not much different from his other investments. Please search his history if you are in doubt."
Is anyone on this board concerned about Friday's Earnings?....if Apollo was only offering $22 they had insight as to how the company was doing and weren't willing to go higher on their bid. This board seems to have a lot of optimism on Friday's numbers but not sure I am sold that they will be good. Based on tomorrows activity I am considering cutting my position in half
"This is a great buying opportunity. When this trade deal is resolved and it inevitably will be, the fundamentals of this stock has to result in a 30+ share price. Stay the course and have faith in Plant my friends"
"Huge after hours volume, over 1 million in one trade. News coming?"
Arconic stock price target raised to $32 from $26 at CFRA
"12 days ago: Elliott's move comes after Arconic rejected more than $11 billion. Elliott hopes its intervention can help Arconic fetch a higher price, >>> so Elliott is only seeking more than the last bid. He would accept 24.00 a share if it is accurate he only wants a higher price than $11B <<< Arconic's board plans to meet next week to review the offers, one of the sources added.............""next week"" is now last week."" There should be no drawn out conversation.Everyone knew the score from the first bid of $11B. The bids were received Friday Nov. 30."
"Does anyone have more on the following purchase from Arconic?Arlington Capital Partners Announces Acquisition of Firth Rixson Forgings from Arconic as Part of Forged Solutions GroupWASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 02, 2019--Arlington Capital Partners (""Arlington Capital""), a Washington,D.C.-based private equity firm, today announced the acquisition of FirthRixson Forgings Limited (the ""Company"") from Arconic.

will Paul singer offer 42 - 45 a share and take company private?
"Arconic is expecting $100 savings for pension freeze and lower interest expense, but they expect none of that savings flow to the bottom line because of higher Aluminum cost! They are also expecting to spend $750 mil on Capex in 2018, yet they expect ZERO benefit flowing to their bottom line as they are expecting no earning growth in 2018. They spent similar amount of CapEx in 2017 and got negative margins improvement based on their 2018-Q1 earning report. Could CEO or CFO of this company explain how their margins eroded in 2017 after $700 mil CapEx investment, and how $750 mil CapEx investment creates Zero return in 2018? Could Elliott explain that?"
"Here is the link to the article about the $11 billion write-down of Precision Cast Parts by Berkshire for those who haven't seen it.https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/warren-buffett-admitted-a-big-mistake-touted-berkshire-hathaways-past-deals-and-cautioned-traders-in-his-annual-letter/articleshow/81247656.cmsBoeing and Airbus are major customers of Howmet, and their stock prices have rebounded significantly from their March 2020 lows, however, they are still about 50% lower than their highs of 2019 prior to the pandemic, which is another indication that the market does not expect the commercial airlines to recover to their pre-pandemic levels."
They are trying to buy this on a discount. It should be 30/share.
The deal was suppose to announced by December mid??? any guesses?
"I am a retired Alcoa/Arconic employee. Part of my compensation involved stock options. I own some at $30.51 that “drop dead” January 26, 2020. I never thought they would be “in the money” but here we are. I really don’t need the additional income in 2019 so I plan on holding off cashing them in until next year. I have a $35 target in mind. Any thoughts on my strategy?"
"My target $35! for catalysts:1. long-term contract with BA;2. Eventually, BA will buy out ARNC!"
"Will someone please generate more 'fake news' leveraged buy-out rumors.....come on, someone do it! Got to get this complete loser some upside action. For example, ""Elliott reviews buy-out of $30 a share from new source""....Let's get it goin'!"
"Why speculate? Just wait until there is an actual announcement before prejudging. The terms haven’t even been agreed to yet. The bOD knows it needs shareholder approval- and that means a hell of a lot more votes than just Elliott Management’s 10%. Relax until we actual have the details. The company is worth more than it is trading at now, and with the markets slipping, an APO offer helps put in a floor."
I think the deal was cancelled at the last hour by the board to what I think the change in market sentiment and not about pension liabilities. I think the board did the right think. Apollo wanted to take advantage of the market conditions. Also I think Arconic would post good numbers and with market sentiment changed it wouldn't take the stock long to go higher than the bid price
"I'm tooo confused about this stock, even to ask a decent question."
"In Q4-2108 report, Arconic projected minimum of $400 in EBIT improvements due to cost saving (200), lower AL price (120) and incremental higher revenue (80), yet only $100 mil of the improved EBIT flows down to the bottom line. Price movement affirms management projection and assumes at least $200 mil of higher EBIT will vanish if the ""Black Hole"" AKA Arconic management supreme incompetence. If for some magical reason management does not vanish the $200 mil, then should see EPS mid point estimate raised to about $2 from $1.6 and we will see a rally towards the intrinsic value of this company at $30 per share. We'll find out in 2 weeks. Every body is watching you Mr. Plant. Please do not come to CC like a clueless disconnected CEO who just arrived at the job few days ago."

"Arconic Q4 earning was not bad and reaffirms intrinsic valuation in the high 20s whether by EPS or EBITDA multiples in spite of ineffective and dysfunctional senior management. I give Plant the benefit of the doubt because he had back spine and integrity to stand up to Elliott and call off a flawed and corrupt deal and fire Blankenship the inside mole acting on behalf of Elliott and not all the shareholders. Plant decided to do what APO/Elliott were planning to do to make 30+% profit and said everybody should benefit the upside and not just APO and Elliott. The easy path for him, at his age, was to collect his commission on the sale and walk away, like Blankenship, or take the more difficult path of staying on and fight for all shareholders.Going forward, Plant has to regain investors trust starting by providing much better transparency and communications. The highest priority task for Arconic is to close the 5% margin gap to industry bench mark and NOT the splitting. Splitting the company will not solve the underling margin deficit and nobody will pay market price or any premium for a business running at 5% margin deficit. 2018 over 2017 margins deteriorated meaning the ROI on $770 Mil capex in 2018 was actually negative and the picture for $700 Capex in 2019 is the same based on their guidance. The biggest challenge is the execution of plans. They could not move 50 people to a lower cost headquarter after 2 years of wasted time and money, could not improve margins, could not sell BCS after 7 months of “robust interest”, could not execute any share buyback, and could not come up with a concrete strategy going forward after a whole year of planning. Plant’s CC seemed like they have “some ideas” much short of a company who spent a full year mapping a solid business strategy. I blame Elliott for this shortcoming because they hijacked the process with the “sale” of all the company. I hope Elliott comes around and help the execution of improving margins as oppose to plotting to sabotage to steal the company. I believe Arconic will easily beat the $1.65 EPS, will sell few Billions of asset, will use the proceeds to reduce debt and share counts and hopefully end 2019 in the high 20s to low 30s range. It is all about EXECUTION and we all help them and they should listen and focus on delivering results."
If they are offering only 22 per share--------don't sell !!!!!
"Wowww Buy out was supposed to be at $30? ""The $15bn buyout of Arconic by Apollo Global Management fell apart due to a last-minute dispute over hundreds of millions of dollars needed to cover pension obligations owed to the US manufacturer’s ....""https://finance.yahoo.com/m/071c8377-a1dd-3acc-8e2b-9f6c5077b3a1/%5B%24%24%5D-arconic-buyout-scuppered.html"
"Here is the fact, if Arconic refused an offer of 22 dollars a share than its not rocket science that they see the value much higher."
"The investment in the auto sheet plant makes a lot of sense. Lightweighting will continue in autos -- EV's need it for longer duration on battery life, and the transition of the US market to mostly SUV's and light trucks will continue to demand lightweighting for reducing cost-of-use on gas. As more and more competition on trucks and SUVs -- it will be the relative points on mileage and other features versus cost that will drive continued demand, as well as continued lightweighting. Good investment by ARNC and Plant."
"So we're inching closer to earnings release folks; who wants to make some predictions?! Mine is that Chip will push the strategic review into Q1 of 2021 because by then, hindsight will be 2020."
All though the offer is upsetting it is nice to know I can finally exit this POS. Now if only AA will get back to the mid 50’s I can sell and never look back. 4 Years waisted with the metals and promise of shareholder value post split. To think this was at 30 and aa 62. It feels like 2015 all over again smh
Would love to see this stock around 35.00 soon I hope
Standby folks-we could have liftoff tomorrow based on the Reuters article publishes 4 hrs ago!!!
"I believe I found 15 cents, $75 million, of the missing $25 cents in 2019 EPS. It looks like Mr. Plant the chairman of the board and the new CEO decided to grant himself 1 million shares of Arconic at $1 per share plus $20 million bonus if stock hits $30 which is the price when he assumed the chairmanship of this company. So if he can recover the damage that was done to this company under his watch, he will reward himself with more than $50 mil in total compensation for one year of service. The new COO will get 1/3 of the similar package. Would he do less of job if he was getting a very generous offer of $5 mil. The answer is definitely NO. Then why is he getting $45 mil more to do the same job, you may ask? The answer is because he can. Welcome to fair and equitable executive compensation in corporate America!! I wish we could all decide how much we should get paid for our work."
