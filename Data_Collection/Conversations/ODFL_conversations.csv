"I worked for ODfl during 2008 crisis also as driver, we where one of the only few LTL companies that made profit during the 2008 crisis, covid is a artificial crisis, not driven by economic reason. As a driver the only risk in my mind is a normal correction of market."
"Look at the numbers: ODFL and JB hunt are like making a lot more earnings and revenue, but their market caps are way way higher than yell. Apples to apples you feel like Yell is worth $30. Get your paper out and make three columns and do the math for yourself: $ODFL, $JBHT, $YELL; Revenue, Earnings, Debt, Market Cap."
any chance this might split soon?

Anyone adding at this $142 level?
"Greg C. Gantt, President and Chief Executive Officer of Old Dominion, commented, ""Old Dominion produced strong profitable growth for the third quarter of 2021 with results that include new Company records for revenue and profitability. The increase in quarterly revenue reflects the strength of the domestic economy and unprecedented demand for our best-in-class service. Our superior service offering and available network capacity are fundamental qualities that differentiate Old Dominion in the marketplace and support our ongoing ability to win market share.""The Company’s revenue growth of 32.3% included a 15.7% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight and a 13.7% increase in LTL tons. The increase in LTL tons was the result of a 19.4% increase in LTL shipments that was partially offset by a 4.8% decrease in LTL weight per shipment. The decrease in weight per shipment was primarily due to our continuing efforts to reduce the number of heavy-weighted shipments in our network to preserve capacity and improve our operating efficiency. These efforts, as well as the 0.8% increase in average length of haul, also had the effect of increasing our reported yield metrics. The 10.1% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, reflects the changes in the mix of our freight as well as the success of our long-term pricing strategy that focuses on individual account profitability.""Our operating ratio improved to a Company record of 72.6% for the third quarter of 2021. We improved many of our cost categories as a percent of revenue during the quarter due to the leverage created by our balanced revenue growth as well as improvements in our operating efficiency. Our operating supplies and expenses, however, increased as a percent of revenue due primarily to the significant increase in fuel prices. We also increased our use of purchased transportation during the third quarter to supplement the capacity of our workforce. The average number of full-time employees increased 20.9% as compared to the third quarter of 2020, and we intend to continue hiring additional employees during the fourth quarter to support our volume growth and reduce our reliance on purchased transportation."""
"$ODFL reported their volume and revenues up nicely for August, should bode well for YELL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/old-dominion-freight-line-provides-124000778.html"
"This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.45%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this trucking company would post earnings of $1.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.70, delivering a surprise of 7.59%. It was an excellent QR so why is it down today? Did I miss something with the guidance?"
Still think there is plenty of room to run for the trucking stocks. I’ve had huge returns with ARCB and ODFL and JBHT. The truck driver shortage tells me there is incredible demand far exceeding supply. The truckers have had a big run since the pandemic floor but I’m convinced more returns are ahead.
"I’m a driver at ODfl, this one best run trucking companies, we are very busy, LTL increase during bad times cause lot less full truck loads, we furloughed lot drivers, when Covid started, we have since hired almost 100% and more back depending on location."
$ODFL and $KNX hit new 52 week highs today too. There is no reason YELL shouldn't be participating in this. Trucking and freight are strong and will remain strong with all the port shortages and back up in the supply chain of pretty much everything.
any chance for splits at this price?
"Someone needs to check if someone is driving this thing or if it's a runaway truck. Good grief, will it ever stop going up???? Where is this truck headed, smh."
Old Dominion Freight Line reached an all time high at 307.84
You look at YELL compared to others like $ODFL $KNX $SAIA and it makes sense for someone to try to take them out on the cheap. $4.5B in revenue and the 2nd largest LTL carrier with a $300M market cap. KNX bought AAA Cooper for $1.3B and they were doing $780M a year in revenue.
More and more buying opportunities.
"You have to look at this and see business is strong and expanding and they are positioned very well. You also have to look at $ODFL and see they are doing a $2B share repurchase, and figure that YELL makes a very compelling acquisition for someone else in the trucking or LTL sector at these levels and even with their debt. They are the 2nd largest LTL carrier."
Great buying opportinity.. 22% upside!!! Argus target $109 and Wall St Journal $99!!! $ARCB recognized as most efficient and best supply chain logistics and trucking company!! Great Forward PE of 11!! Reporting excellent earnings results on Nov 2!!!$ODFL $KNX $SAIA $JBHT $LSTR $SNDR $MRTN $SNDR
"Hello everyone, this stock has a great record. Thoughts on how the future growth looks? Is this still worth buying for the long haul or should I wait? Any headwinds to be aware of?"
driver shortage odfl earnings may not be great why is the start going up like this I am long on odfl
Starting this now with fingers crossed. What a growth record!
I compared ODFL to other trucking companies stock price. I compared for a period of 15 years orso. Other trucking company stock price is very volatile. what is the different from them to ODFL?The EPS is 5.3$. Isn't it way overvalued? New to looking into trucking companies. any insights about this company?
"One of the best stocks to buy and hold for the next decade for it's consistent performance, dividend growth and shareholder friendly management."

what was the bad news? why did it drop 4% today
Old Dominion Freight Line reached an all time high at 339.39
"$ODFL blew their earnings out, should bode well for YELL reporting next week. Especially when you look at the market cap discrepency to revenue of both carriers, YELL seems like it has a long runway ahead for the stock price to go"
yellow make a big tournaround
what do you guys think Tesla's autonomous truck ? can it disrupt odfl business? I heard there are 7.7 million drivers in the truck industry. I wonder how the full self-driving autonomous in Tesla semi could affect the trucking industry. any thoughts please share
Old Dominion Freight Line reached an all time high at 311.44

You’ll see $300 before EOY...
"with autonomous trucking coming in a year or two, what can we expect to the trucking companies and their business?"
ODFL is a good definition of a boring business that continues to reward long-term shareholders!!
Old Dominion Freight Line is down 5.09% to 309.17
"The one point of concern is someone like $ODFL $SAIA $ARCB or $KNX (who already is on a recent acquisition spree) try to take out YELL on the cheap. The 2nd largest LTL carrier even with debt at $2B here, compare it to the market caps of the others, plus there would be operational synergies too."

Morgan Stanley maintains Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL) with a Overweight and raises the price target from $205 to $220.today 12/10/20. Efficient company and undervalued. Freight charges are up and this is the holidays
"No rational to this market. ODFL has the best Operating Ratio IN THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY, for an LTL Company. How is it trading here and unable to break $215? The LTL industry had record business levels in Q3 & Q4 of 2020. GRI's (General Rate Increases) are kicking in around 5% minimum in 2021 and business levels are already coming out strong. LTL Market is going to have real capacity issues in 2021 which will only add to record business and profit levels.I expect them to crush earnings tomorrow - where the price goes? It should go up but who knows...."
