"I worked for ODfl during 2008 crisis also as driver, we where one of the only few LTL companies that made profit during the 2008 crisis, covid is a artificial crisis, not driven by economic reason. As a driver the only risk in my mind is a normal correction of market."
which is better. JB hunt or ODFL
The 10 year bond yield of about 2.15% is now equal to the S&P yield of about 2.15%. ODFL pays 0% dividend. ODFL's days are numbered and that number is a small one.
ODFL reached an all time high at 195.40
"Yellow reports a 16% year-over-year increase in LTL tonnage per workday for the quarter to date. ""Trucker Yellow Logs Quarter-To-Date Gains Compared To 2020 -- that the LTL tonnage figure was per workday over that period."
I'm convinced Jerome Powell is on the board of this company....all it does is throw out money.
"Anyone know why ODFL popped so much and then settled back down? Regardless, I'm a long term holder since $190 with no plans to sell but just curious. Thank you."
"At least 221 for this stock, consider all the shipping that has increased in this country with the pandemic. Earnings should be better then last year"

I compared ODFL to other trucking companies stock price. I compared for a period of 15 years orso. Other trucking company stock price is very volatile. what is the different from them to ODFL?The EPS is 5.3$. Isn't it way overvalued? New to looking into trucking companies. any insights about this company?
Old Dominion Freight is up 7.64% to 138.05
what was the bad news? why did it drop 4% today
"You have to wonder why this trades so cheap with $300M market cap for their size and revenue, their debt doesn't seem out of whack. You have to wonder why someone like $ODFL doesn't try to take them out, it would double their revenue and they can get efficiencies. Same with $SAIA"

"I’m a driver at ODfl, this one best run trucking companies, we are very busy, LTL increase during bad times cause lot less full truck loads, we furloughed lot drivers, when Covid started, we have since hired almost 100% and more back depending on location."
ODFL reached a new All Time High at 162.68
$ODFL and $KNX hit new 52 week highs today too. There is no reason YELL shouldn't be participating in this. Trucking and freight are strong and will remain strong with all the port shortages and back up in the supply chain of pretty much everything.
ODFL is up 4.94% to $126.57
ODFL is up 4.98% to 190.74
"The one point of concern is someone like $ODFL $SAIA $ARCB or $KNX (who already is on a recent acquisition spree) try to take out YELL on the cheap. The 2nd largest LTL carrier even with debt at $2B here, compare it to the market caps of the others, plus there would be operational synergies too."

when does it split? any chances? I know they did in 2012
"This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.45%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this trucking company would post earnings of $1.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.70, delivering a surprise of 7.59%. It was an excellent QR so why is it down today? Did I miss something with the guidance?"
Next big one - BUY RRTS
"The difference between a good stock(ODFL) and a bad stock(YELL). Want a laugh? Go to the Yellow(YELL) board. They fight with each other, name calling, and stupid memes."
You look at YELL compared to others like $ODFL $KNX $SAIA and it makes sense for someone to try to take them out on the cheap. $4.5B in revenue and the 2nd largest LTL carrier with a $300M market cap. KNX bought AAA Cooper for $1.3B and they were doing $780M a year in revenue.

"With odfl and others strained for eqpt, penske (pag) is a hot item as trailer leasing will be strong through the rest of the year as ltl and truckload carriers defer buying eqpt beccause of business level uncertainties.

"2021 Consensus EPS $6.26. At a 20 multiple this stock only worth $125. 25 multiple $156. This stock is significantly over valued, and expect pull back in 20% range. Had the Treasury department not given YRCW a $700 million ""loan"", when their market cap was only around $65M, YRCW would have likely gone out of business and ODFL would be worth $200 a share. However, just as Obama's administration was corrupt when they gave GM $9 BILLION that was never paid back in order to pay off the unions, the Trump administration found a way to ""loan"" the worthless YRCW company $700M to payoff the Teamsters and hope they vote for Trump. YRCW will NEVER be able to pay back the vast majority of that loan. The $9 BILLION Obama gave GM was criminal and our kids and grand children will be paying the interest on that national debt for every. Trump's $700 million a lot less, but just as guilty trying to buy votes. Sell at least 1/2 of your ODFL stock to lock in profits, particularly since Biden and Schumer have promised that capital gain taxes are going to double next year if they get elected."
"You have to look at this and see business is strong and expanding and they are positioned very well. You also have to look at $ODFL and see they are doing a $2B share repurchase, and figure that YELL makes a very compelling acquisition for someone else in the trucking or LTL sector at these levels and even with their debt. They are the 2nd largest LTL carrier."

"No rational to this market. ODFL has the best Operating Ratio IN THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY, for an LTL Company. How is it trading here and unable to break $215? The LTL industry had record business levels in Q3 & Q4 of 2020. GRI's (General Rate Increases) are kicking in around 5% minimum in 2021 and business levels are already coming out strong. LTL Market is going to have real capacity issues in 2021 which will only add to record business and profit levels.I expect them to crush earnings tomorrow - where the price goes? It should go up but who knows...."

It is like Covid 19 never happened. This stock is higher than it was prior to Covid-19 reaching this country. How is that possible given the lower eps estimates for this year and next year. This might be the most overvalued stock in the world.

Still think there is plenty of room to run for the trucking stocks. I’ve had huge returns with ARCB and ODFL and JBHT. The truck driver shortage tells me there is incredible demand far exceeding supply. The truckers have had a big run since the pandemic floor but I’m convinced more returns are ahead.
is ODFL still planning the split on the 24th?
any chance for splits?
