"I'm buying some more 4.8% yield today, plus a div hike coming next Q will put YOC >5%... works for me %^)."
an energy stock that is down? Hmm
Annual div increase coming up next Q- should be a 5% hike or better...
Solid stock Hold this into retirement.
"Great Q earnings. check the potential/ chart from feb 2020 - now.Great, stable and safe company which will get up even more + 5% dividend. I bought today and hold forever."
"If it drops down < 32 tomorrow, ex-div, I'm buying mo'..."
Can anyone out there give me a reason as to why stocks have dividend payable dates (like OGE was supposed to pay a dividend today but didn't) but routinely DO NOT pay dividends on that day ? It usually happens the next day. What is the point in having a specific dividend payable day if all the stock is going to do is ignore it ?
Buy a bit @5% or more fwd div yield...KISS
43.55 is a one month high (based on close). Breaking and holding that would be very positive for this stock.
"Five things that OK has plenty of- Natgas, oil, coal, wind and sun. Nice palette to choose from."
"I buy some OGE every time the div yield hits 5% or more, $32.20, and mo' if the price goes below.. the plan's working out well..... %^ )"
"Meeting Update: CenterPoint Energy, OGE's partner in Enable, has announced Dec. 7, 2020 Analyst meeting to discuss CNP outlook following focus on utility-focus strategy and recommendations of its Business Review committee to CNP's Board of Directors"
"Bought the first shares sold this morning pre-market, 30.78, for a 5.066% fwd yield. More if it drops lower. works for me %^ )"
OGE is a great stock to accumulate and use for retirement income. Have been accumulating for about 30 years. Itâ€™s down right now but pays the quarterly dividend.
Does this stock ever have a good day?
OGE dividend increased to 1.61 annual rate. 14th consecutive year of dividend increases...
Fifth year in a row of 10% dividend increases.
"added more @29.25, eclipsing a 5.5% div yield. I don't like to predict short term, but I think at least 10% gain in 2021, probably more. Doesn't matter the time frame as I am LT with an excellent yield.."
More 5%+ div yield purchased today...sweet! %^ )
"I'm buying more OGE today.. current 5.41% fwd div yield, increasing yearly. works for me %^)"
