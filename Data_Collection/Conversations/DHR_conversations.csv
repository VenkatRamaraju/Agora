too much debt
DHR reached an all time high at 157.30
The Danaher Group is well positioned for a merger or take over if you have the deep pockets. There are parts of it that TMO would want but that would be cherry picking the company apart. Not something DHR would want to do. My guess and this is a far fetched guess that BioRad and MilliporeSigma would be suitors for a merger. You have to look at how Danaher was created and for what purpose. The company has done 3x2:1 splits in its history. Splits dilute shares and people tend to forget they ever happened. Theoretically this stock should be viewed at a valuation of nearly $1200/share. At this price is it too big to buyout or does it buy others? DHR and TMO have been all too quiet this year with acquisitions. TMO did walk away from Qiagen - what a smart move!!!. Expect some news within the next 3-4 months from both companies
It is Daniel it's because DHR does not trade and extended hours hardly at all. It's a glitch. If you go to buy any shares right now the bid in the ask is still the same around 260. No for real ￼drop.￼
Why is stock dropping so much past two days?
I'm really glad I bought this a few months ago. Any recommendations of similar quality tickers like DHR?
"DHR proceeded $643M from NVST IPO. The stock went to up to $147+. Do the simple math. NVST IPO is not worth the +4% or +4 billion market cap during flat market.After earning report, it could back to normal. NVST could back to IPO $21-24 range.Vol is high. Build positions with strangle."
Why it is down today?
Not a very closely guarded report by RBC or Mr. Dray based on DHR’s 20 0r more point decline over the last 10 sessions. Based on the insider selling perhaps DHR had a whiff.
"Great earnings, DHR should recover nicely today..."
What’s driving it AH? Anyone?
is this a good buying opportunity for longterm investor?
who is Clair? request CEO resigns!
"Abbott came out with a 5 minute test and they shipping 50,000 a day. they can do tests in a physician's office. hmmmmmmm, not feeling to hot about ours any more lol"
big drop in 2 days. sold 180/190/200/210/220 puts today to balance my delta.
Very nice !
"this new format is soooo slow and awkward, that for the first time in 10 years, I am going to try google for my portfolio magement"
What's behind $DHR 's numbers. Here is the link http://crweworld.com/article/news-provided-by-pr-newswire/219350/danaher-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results
Cepheid has been mentioned multiple times in WH press conferences and the stock still can even pace the DJI. I got out at a small loss. Disappointed in the performance here. Not worth buying as a CV play.
83% of institutions owns it.
Dhr does not deserve this pricing after this fantastic quarter
Been holding since 2016...........and adding of course.....what a great snooze.
More insider buys than sells.....market should pay heed to this
"I use this machine at work to test for Influenza A and B, RSV , and Clostridium Difficile. Excellent machine very easy to use, and you get the results within half an hour"
Did anyone read this? DHR is the parent company of Cepheid https://sherlock.bio/cepheid-and-sherlock-biosciences-establish-collaboration-on-new-genexpert-tests-for-infectious-diseases-and-oncology-leveraging-crispr-technology/
issuing 3 billion in debt.......hello dilution to shareholders....now saddled with 13 billion in debt
Danaher reached an all time high at 223.02
Earnings beat coming up pretty sure. Check the Zacks article.
Nice virus pump n dump...lol
Jason.....go away.....please!!!!!!!!
Future earnings growth doesn't justify today's prices in DHR. JMTC
stock drop least 20% now...
"I started following ""lionstock-aletrs” (Gooogle it - off course without any space or dash in between the words) and their notifications are better than anyone else."
and does anyone have an excuse for the continued drop here today?
Can’t figure out why price moved so much considering GE closes in 4th qtr and earnings then won’t show up for a year.
Thank you Mitch and Steve Rales for starting this growth darling back in the 90's and hiring the right people to manage it. You have made many of us multi-millionaires!!!!!!
what's with the sell off
"Over years, chairman Rales is the only insider buyer. 2020-05-29: 141,420 $164.69 (a good buy)2020-11-19: 26,784 $226.142021-02-26: 6,600 $221.55 (shares reduced significantly).The other insider sold their shares around $244 recently.Expect the price lower than $220 on 3/19/2021"
FDA Approval - 60 minutes coverage - 45 Minute Result DHR is a winner all around!
"Looking back at the last 6 months, it seems to struggle getting over this 240 area (6 rejections). I'd still like to own this, maybe wait closer to ER."
This will close in the 130s ... Institutions are shaking out the weak hands. Cepheid is the official CDC test kit approved by the FDA. 45 minutes is still long but much better than the 1 to 2 day wait.
"Hopefully they can ramp fast.One of the reporters at the the presidential press briefings should ask if the federal government is assisting the company in every way possible to get components needed, aid their manufacturing process and distribute these tests to the most needed locations ASAP."
Keep it up 
Danaher is up 4.93% to 256.81

"Amazing business momentum in DHR on a 1, 5, 10, 20, 30 yr time frame. This is just an relentless business. Whoever has been on the top of the leadership team deserves a tonne of credit. Amazing DNA for sure  "
"Dad bought 6000 shares at $10 in 1999. Never sold. Dad passed last summer. Rest in peace pop, you were a genius."

Danaher is down along with TMO
DHR reached a 52 Week low at 119.85
Oh another dip - chance to buy more which is what I just did!!
"Danaher Corporation expects spur in demand in products https://themarketsignal.com/Free-Report/DHRThe Washington, D.C.-based conglomerate Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is snowballing over its pivot point of 163.10, reflecting that the stock has had a confident day. The market sentiments and investors’ sentiments have remained favourable for this stock from quite some time. The stock price of this company until June 8 had surged 12.8% since 2020 beginning. This comes even against the decline of 9% from the industry.The benefit of this company is derived from Danaher Business System, innovation capabilities, efficient workforce as well as solid product portfolio. There is an expectation of spurring demand of products in the times to come, as far as its acute care diagnostics and molecular diagnostics is concerned."
why is this tanking again?
I am invested in TMO. thinking should I add more to. TMO OR BUY new position in DHR. they are both life sciences companies
do Thermo Fisher and Dan her compete in the same product lines?
why CEO still not resigns? Ms Clair : if media program shutdown that will make you happy!

Somethin big is in the wind...another major acquisition?
Cepheid is a division of Danaher. These tests are a 45 minutes result using existing diagnostic machines. Danaher recently bought GE Biopharma for $20bn. A connection to GE Healthcare and $SNANF for improved rapid response testing is coming. D anther will do well. The multi bagger play is on $SONA $SNANF through GE to Danaher. Check it out.

"help me, we need to contact DHR Mgt and stop the 20Billion payment to GE, in a month we can get it for 5Billion. help me"
overreaction by DHR....placed on credit watch too since they overpaid....Culp does a buddy deal and convinces the shopaholics at DHR to overpay...and now they have huge debt
people who know just bought more. this company is not only exceptional but a long term garauntee of containing successI wish I had more money so I could buy more than 5 shares on this dip.
Will receive fast track by the FDA
45mins is too long....lookup at DECN 15seconds
This looks good.
Every single exec is selling. Going to leave the little guys with the bags again... http://archive.fast-edgar.com//20190228/A72A8222I222A2Z2222M22XZTU7DZ22252B2/
Bought more on the $11.00 dip.. this is a great company and knows how to make lots of cash..
Up 8 pts on no news??
glad vaccine is here. but what is the impact on DHR STOCK price?
40 times earnings? Pass
"I checked the Cepheid website, the diagnostic machines are really small. The bigger model can test 16 kits at a time. That means a 16 slot machine can test 512 kits per day. If we have 1,000 machines, we can test over half of a million people per day on-site. That's a real game changer to monitor the number of infected people. Once we have a good handle on the number of infected people, we have perhaps relax the lockdown and allow the uninfected people to go out."
"10x volume. 100x option volume. More than 608,000 open interest of Dec.170 straddles and keep growing. Anyone expect a big move before Dec. 20? Both buyer and writer are big players. By then it will show which side is right. Holding tight."
"Bought more at $222, nice discount"
approval for first quick 45 covid-19 test kit. This should be the hottest stock on the market today. I'm at a loss...

"Unbelievable yearly chart on DHR. Has had red years only during recessions, so great long-term track record along with solid management team in place."
Quiet in here after the news of the FDA acceptance
use human to hi tech test without FDA permissions! is that FBI have to investigate what they doing now?
Huge float...no real pop here. Just my opinion.
There is news just not known to small time investors like us.
DHR-PA is up 7.37% to 1020.00
this stock is ready for a major breakout. it has world wide presence and the ability to test the virus-- World Wide! this could easily double in one month. It could also receive government subsides world wide.
DHR reached a new All Time High at 102.73
DHR DOT O.J. DIVIDEND BUT WORTHA COUPLE LONG RUNS IN 2021. NOT MISSING CURRENT G.E. CEO (WASHINGTON COLLEGE GRAD).

Time to fly! Be fast or be last.
"I totally agree with RUSSK, I can't figure out where to find the things II used to look at!"
cepheid test were on display yesterday during corona briefing it was on the screen for about 5 minutes with our cartridge. it was explained there are several point of cares that have a high compacity which is cepheied tests. they went on to show where out ceoheied machines are located and stating they will produce 3 million tests a month . we are very under the radar I feel cephied will have a better then expected earning which should give us a boost. I can't post the pictures but if you watch last night's brief fast forward to the young guy in a suit he did a presentation and you will see our tests. also Dr Burks showed about 7 slides of states with our tests availability. in a few states we had quite a large presence. both large and small scaling of testing machines. glta
Danaher reached an all time high at 214.38
Even at a 7% discount the DHR for NVST proxy does not look good. Look at NVST P&L and guidance from last earnings call. I see why DHR is divesting them. Anyone else have any thoughts on this
which one TMO or DHR. both companies are Life sciences companies. DHR performance in the last five years seems to be better than the TMO. but TMO seems to have bigger moat.WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?
DHR spinoffsI question whether it makes any sense to keep spinoffs VNT and FTV. FTV maybe but VNT to my mind has little price appreciation potential.
"looks like yes DHR will be up but for the day est. 15% . at open be careful may pop 20% then drift down to a flat line. I am not going to buy ""on the news"" .... DD."
Does DHR have enough cash to consumate the GE's deal? (around 20 billions)
just mentioned self swabbing at home. I wish they mention our company.
I see they say a few million tests will be available in a few months..We need tests now be wide spread by then.
What just happened AH??

"For those who are long Danaher should see who is under the GE healthcare brand they are partnered with. Sano Nanotech (ticker SNANF) just released their US OTC ticker yesterday .

"Okay golden opportunity here we can’t waste it. Someone needs to reply to Jim Cramer’s tweet, be creative but something along the lines of. Jim $Sona entered into a partnership with $ge life sciences in early March. At the end of March $DHR (danaher) purchased $ge for 21.4 billion. Division was renamed to cytiva. As soon as #donaldtrump realizes this is an incredible test to solve the pandemic we can get life back to normal. Make sure to use $ and # to get as many eyes on your tweet as possible. Thanks. I’m not a tweeter but this is very important. Monday will be a great day. (For those going to say oh blah blah what partnership blah blah you need to realize Cytiva invested 500 million over next 5 years to amp up their manufacturing)"

"The key is the ""Fastest Test Results"". Cepheid / DHR was just mentioned on CNBC as the only company that can perform the test and have the results back within ""45 minutes"".Other tests takes too long, Medical staff could be operating with infected gears if they do not have the results on expedited time."
ny has the earnings and sales growth to deserve a much higher price. The comfort level which is quite good for this stock and the expected eps in October tells me to buy the dip. This will be a short term situation if others see it my way.
plus they diluted their shareholders by 3 billion or more....the arbitrage guys will take care of that haha...no way this holds at this price once shareholders realize it

Any idea why this is down 4% this morning?
this is not how I saw this. but I have a feeling when the tests are out which should be end of the week or early next week they will report it in the news and this will pop alot. IF NOT this is still a great company that got hit with the carona recession and should recover a half a year after this is all over. either was money is safe. anyone have a different view ? curious how people see it lets be civil

Cramer has good things to say about DHR. Said it will continue to go up in the short term because he expects analyst upgrades to follow.
Another election cycle followed by another large decline in the healthcare sector. When will investors learn the politicians are all talk. Nothing will get pass that will hurt the healthcare sector.
I did not buy enough so I bought another 200 today on the dip. Performance is the key

It won’t be long before DHR acquires LXXGF their new state of the art testing device is going on sale this September. The company is holding a webcast at 2:0 pm est today to explain the situation.
