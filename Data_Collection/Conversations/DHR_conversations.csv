ny has the earnings and sales growth to deserve a much higher price. The comfort level which is quite good for this stock and the expected eps in October tells me to buy the dip. This will be a short term situation if others see it my way.
Major buy opportunity!!!!!

Cramer has good things to say about DHR. Said it will continue to go up in the short term because he expects analyst upgrades to follow.
Way above the 50dma. Look for a pull back to touch the line before end of year.
Earnings beat coming up pretty sure. Check the Zacks article.
A $4.50 discount - will get it back in a day or two…
Does anyone know why there was such a dramatic decline yesterday? Profit taking?
Why it is down today?
$285-$285 next stop
"October summary:Bought 200 average $302; assigned 2 310 put average $304.Short expired: 32 puts from 250-300 and 9 calls from 302.5 to 380.Net $9k- with $258K capital locked. Roughly 3.4% profit.Expect November: high volatility, more opportunity (with the weekly option lunched yesterday). Trade small and trade often."
"Dropping fast, below 50DMA now. Why?"
I don’t get it either?! Maybe sell on the news earnings?

"Healthcare and financial will be the best performing sectors for the next 12 months, DHR is the most solid name is this space, I would say Goldman Sachs ,Capital One financial and JP Morgan the best in financials."
I have decided to buy this dip. The ER Conference call has been scheduled for 6AM on the 21 st of October. Very early . I believe the news will be very good. I could make 20-25 points on the new buy
The last stock split was in 2016 when the price hovered around the $80 mark. I wouldn't be surprised if this one splits in the next 2 years at the rate they are running at now.
I did not buy enough so I bought another 200 today on the dip. Performance is the key
"I worked for Danaher for over 10 yrs, Best run company and best stock performance for over the years."
Why up today? PE is still high
short 11 calls and 13 puts. wait tomorrow's earning report.
people who know just bought more. this company is not only exceptional but a long term garauntee of containing successI wish I had more money so I could buy more than 5 shares on this dip.
Cup and handle patter forming
Hummmm Pall is making special filters for semiconductor factories.
Nice oppty
Buying the dip once more. This stock is easily worth 340.
One of the talking heads on cnbc said Danaher was sandbagging for this earnings quarter. We will see.
$328 tomorrow
Up 8 pts on no news??
Buy what you can afford this stock will go back up
There is news just not known to small time investors like us.
Why is stock dropping so much past two days?
I picked up 20 DHR’s @326 recently. …excited to get another 100 @319 today￼
Any day is a good day to buy this one. good solid company and a steady gainer
"interesting how DHR has beat the ETF IHI its in, long term but not short term. Why the decline recently?"
Somethin big is in the wind...another major acquisition?
I bought and still add on when the opportunity appears. Wait for EPS going to be good
Why drop?
