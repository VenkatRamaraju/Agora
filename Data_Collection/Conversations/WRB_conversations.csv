"Can anyone explain why is WRB up from low 50's to high 50's in the past 3 months yet WRB-PF is down from 25 to 23.92?WRB-PF during height of COVID19 panic was down to 16-17 range too!With the underling stock recovering and interest rates staying very low for the foreseeable future, I do not understand how the preferred is down from 25 three months ago when I bought at 25"
