The IBM of beverages. Hasn't shown volume growth in over 10 years with some of the same management team still intact. Insane.
"Stock price sinking like a stone the past 5 business days. Whispers of horrible earning report coming up. Would the Board of Directors PLEASE sack the entire upper managrment team?! Please. These people have had some of the most lucrative base and stock unit pay in the entire industry all while eroding share price close to 70% over the past 7.5 years!! Time for a completely new team. Sack CEO, finance, marketing and human resources vp's and bring in completelt new blood. HR has like 90% of their uppet directors and VPs working from home. I hear you can never get ahold of ANYONE in HR as they are NEVER in the office. i hear when u call them at home all you get is barking dogs and children crying for most of the call."
Management states to aggresively grow the premium portfolio.
Moderate pricing power at best. Buy mo instead.
"Dear Thad, I writing to you today to let you know that TAP is getting ready to rocket. We will not be making any stops on the way to the Moon, so please be prepared for the ride. Love Tap Moon"
Excellent result as indicated by management that the growth is ahead. Earnings went to debt before are now starting to go to the bottom line.
Bad management trying to put lipstick on a pig. A pig they created. Replacing the CEO or a merger is the only chance of stock performance growth.
"Dear Thad,I know it's been a long and wild ride for you as a shareholder of the great Molson Coors. I only recently became a shareholder so I don't know the pain you must be going through. However, I would just like to say, I'm never selling. I'm never leaving. The Tap show goes on. Tap to $100 is inevitable, Topo-Zoa-Vizzy-Ranch Water will get us there. I promise you we will share a brewski together when it gets there. I will cover the tab no worries. Love Tap Moon"
"Doug, 50 people have all said same as you over the past 8 years. all were wrong. all are gone. until management team here is completely removed, this stock will continue to decline. you will see. institutional investors are now starting to leave. stock price is mid $30s by late winter/early spring. BANK IT!"
what happened to that squeeze dougie?
Yahoo target price of 55.89 is very conservative- just go to the bars to check it out.
TAP can't even stay in the positive on a universal up day. Losing price support at current level is not a good sign.
People must drink a lot less beer than 5 years ago because the bud stock and this stock are down a lot in 5 years. Does anyone drink beer anymore?
Get ready for a stock price below $40 after earnings. I would buy at $37.
Insiders buying is a great positive sign.
institutional investors running from this company. slack being taken up by the poor retail investors who will all be left holding the bag! All while the Executive leadership team is laughing all the way to the bank while theu ruin this once great company. Sad to watch.
ThadI know you must be wondering why Tap is red every day. The red you see is actually fire brewing under the rocket that will send all of us to the moon. Don't worry we will take off soon.
"Hey Thad, just spoke to our boy Doug. He is doing some last-minute shopping for suitcases, so he can be ready for the rocket ride to the moon. Also Thad, if you need anything for the trip, let me know cause I can stop by Walmart and get you a suitcase or some snacks."
"I bought a few shares today, after taking the empties back to the beer store."
Can't believe it. Just keeps getting worse today. Could the board of directors please clean house and sack most of the leadership team here so we could start to rebuild this company??? I'm way underwater and can't sell and have been waiting for over 7 years for a turn around that NEVER comes. only constant during that time has been this same management team. Dinosaurs lining their pockets at shareholder expense.
