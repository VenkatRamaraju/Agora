"TAP is a dying company run by dinosaurs who are lining their pockets at shareholders expense. Any other place the executive leadership team would have been shown the door over 2.5 years ago. Major shake up is needed here. Not another reorganization or layoffs but COMPLETE CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP!!! Until then, expect more share price decline and more excuses with promises of better days ahead. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!! 6 dismal years is long enough. Change leadership team NOW!!!"
Reversing my negative take. This will be in the mid 50's by early summer. Hearing of momentum from the trade.
Tap stock is the Reddit's crowd target. Another GME play is about to take place. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/
I’m down 10% on TAP. But i will never be down as much as I’ve spent on booze in my lifetime.
I believe TAP has the most potential of all the publicly traded beer companies in 2020.
Smart i stitutions are accumulating. 93 % of float are owned by institution now. it is the best recovery play as it grows again on beverages.
I'm gonna put money in here. This actually seems undervalued along with a lot of other stocks in this industry.Dividends returning next year but let's be real. Everyones gonna want s beer after this mess lol
"Vizzy should have been out at the beginning of stay at home orders, they really lagged on that one and it will cost them as White Claw and Truly are going to further dominate the seltzer market. Everyone is drinking seltzer right now, and lots of it."
Today I learned humility.
Where's Weed Mower. He's afraid to come back to this board after he was so bullish on this stock when it was in the $50s. Weed Mower is a Todd!
"There's a lot to like about the quarter. Cant argue with the tick-up in EBITDA. People talking about sales volume as if restaurants were and still are operating at full capacity. A decrease of only 3.1% y/y is certainly something to be celebrated. On-prem orders allow company to move greater volumes but at cheaper wholesale prices-- apples and oranges-- off-prem is higher margin. So, to point to a 3.1% decrease in sales without considering the shift from on-prem to off-prem is just poor analysis. What people should be asking is: how sticky is this incredible off-prem growth? Will a return of on-prem come at the expense of off prem growth? Because, if any of you guys care to transpose and extrapolate a trailing 5 year average on-prem sales volume over the top of recent off-prem volumes, you get a high single digit comp y/y-- I reiterate, something to be celebrated. What's more, the company proved to debt holders that it's not completely dependent on restaurants, and, therefore, less tethered to the uncertainty associated with virus closures."
Not merger but strategic partnership with Heineken from the rumors I'm hearing. Might just be floated to get a little pop in share price for ELT to sell some stock shares that are due to expire.
Decline in hard seltzers will help TAP and BUD. However need the marketing punch. Right now BUD will win. They have Mich Ultra and big upside for very weak brands in the Bud franchise. TAP needs marketing muscle and now is the time. It's missing.
"@Richard in tumultuous times like these I look for companies with solid, innovative management teams with a proven track record. The last 5 years of this team has been abysmal in a good market! Do u trust this team to shepherd the company through these times. If u think objectively the only answer you can come up with is a firm and resounding NO!"
"With no dividend, all income/dividend funds have to sell. It is as simple as that. What’s the big surprise here??"
"Optimization of operation and workforce will generate increasing free cash flow for TAP in 2020. it took three years to streamline the sites, 2020 will be the beginning of rewarding years moving forward after labor was cut"
I own a bar and I can't even get coors light bottles from my distributor because they're all sold out. People are drinking again. I would also look to the long term chart for the inverse head and shoulders pattern that seems to be materializing. Long for life at these prices.
"Remember Molson generates lots of money over time, paid 12 billion to acquired the Miller brand for 12 billion. Now, you get the combined company for 7.x billions. The original Molson is free effectivly."
"Wow, very impressive 2Q EPS of 1.79. Sales are rising and management indicates continous growth. If i take EPS 1.79×4= 7.16 net income of 7.16 for the current price of 48, that is an excellent return with growth and steady dividend income! 7 times P/E with growth indicated by strong brands and premiumarization."
TAP is a classic value trap made worse by horrible management.
The Algo also detected 60 insiders purchase. They provide the guiding light. I verified in Nasdaq.com on Tap
How this Senior Leadership Team have kept their jobs is beyond me. Reminds me if Right Aid company. They had terriible results for 8 years and when they finally cleaned house (4 new board seats and removal of 50% of executive leadership and ceo) and brought in new leadership the stock skyrocketed. Nothing but dinosaurs running this company and they all need to be shown the door!!
"Hmmm half my portfolio is in Facebook because it's trading at a forward P/E of 19, but this is looking really appealing at this price. I'm really hoping this can go to 40$ so I could have a 50% upside to 60$ for TAP."
institutional investors running from this company. slack being taken up by the poor retail investors who will all be left holding the bag! All while the Executive leadership team is laughing all the way to the bank while theu ruin this once great company. Sad to watch.
Does TAP have any exposure to CBD/THC beverages?
@Kenneth it's even worse than you portray. Management at TAP has been fleecing shareholders for over 6 years. Exorbitant salary and bonuses while driving share price down year after year after year. All new product launches during that time failed and recent Vizzy launch doing horribly. No cogent marketing plan behind it and definitely no resources. Until management is completely replaced. new 52 week lows will continue. Let's not forget how leveraged they are after overpaying close to $3billion for the Miller coors joint venture. Will take years to recover from that. Dead stock with no dividend. Game over.
Wow. Molson Coors and Coca Cola partnership
"I've said it before, but based on below average beverage company valuations, this company is worth double what it's trading today. It will get there, maybe require new management."
"$BUD and $TAP have a near monopoly on the Canadian beer market (including many of the beers Canadians think are ""Craft"" like Mill Street Organic, owned by BUD). Molson has already said they plan on cannabis products rolling off the assembly line in time for October. Molson's partner $HEXO has already said they flavorless cannabis molecules that can be added to any beverage. We already know Tilray has flavorless cannabis oil as they are selling it at the OCS under the brand name Irisa. You can bet Bud will have competing product rolling off their assembly lines at the same time as Molson.This is high margin as beer is much more expensive in Canada than in America. In Ontario, the cheapest beer is $1.50 a bottle. The government actually sets a floor (a minimum price that can be charged for a beer. It was recently lowered to a buck and no brewers are selling at that price). The third largest player in Ontario is Sapporo, which co-owns the Beer Store with BUD and TAP. It will be interesting to see if they enter this market. Whether they do or not, all of the big names in this space makes it likely that institutional investors will now make more moves into these legal cannabis stocks."

"I got in for the potential of the Joint Venture with $TAP Truss.I want to hear about their drinks lineup in the next ER.The VERYWELL Drops are exciting and I have not seen water soluble drops from other companies, so innovative. This is good. Long $HEXO"
"If history is any indication of future results, this stock will be back in the red before market closes today."
"With coke partnership, CBD and their other selzer drinks coming out, I think TAP is in a good position for a rebound."
"Look I understand if you guys wanted to short this at 100$, even 70$, but at this price, it's selling at a free cash flow rate of 8x. It produced 200 million of net income last quarter with restaurants and bars shut down throughout North America. If you're shorting this stock now at 34$, your in for a lot of trouble. A bunch of value investors like myself are getting in the low 30s and will sell around 50-55$ for a quick 40-50% gain within a year."
"A decent merchant acquires paying little mind to advertise variances, I began putting utilizing mr Brian platform in June of a year ago, he shared his business strategies and assisted me with accomplishing my objectives and now the benefit rate is outstanding. TeIegram> @Brianfxtrade"
"After a 72% profit, sold at 60$ the other day and used all the proceeds to buy more Facebook. TAP will likely go to 70-75 within the next few months, this is going to be the age of the roaring 20s. Goodluck to all, and a big thank you to Thad for his continuous support. BANK IT"
SInce the new Heineken CEO ran the US and is close to Molson Coors - will it lead to him buying the business as his first big action that defines his legacy?
"You can't loose with alcohol. Its very, very addictive..."
"Please please go down to 41-42, i'll just dump the rest of my portfolio in. Easy 60$ target by June-July. Management doing a fantastic job, free cashflow has been great during the pandemic and even prior."
"Over blown bill? Really? How long have you invested in tap? Have you look at the Chart for the last 6 years? Dig deep into your thoughts, I mean really deep. And ask the question- in the last 6 years, what new product did tap produce sticked with consumers? To be fair, Beverage business is extremely tough for all, not just for tap."
"Remember 6 days ago when Thad said that because the stock was down -2%, it was the beginning of an erosion? Back at almost 53$ now with a 13.33% short float. The squeeze is going to be epic in the summer."
This is starting to look pretty attractive
"more than 70% of the companies listed on the market and including large oil companies such as EXXON mobil and many more cut their dividends or suspended them to conserve liquidity, it is normal in these months of uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 and the closings of businesses and people staying at home made these companies decide to make these changes to protect themselves from the current situation and I think 100% that TAP did the right thing at the moment to compensate for the damage, I do not see why the news of TAP has fallen so badly To analysts or shareholders, this was a good temporary decision so that shareholders have less risk of losing any investment,,,,I am long and strong ,I see $47 in a month.good luck"
"What first drew me to TAP is how they made 250m$ in Q2 when everything was shut. Turns out selling beer in grocery stores has much higher profit margins than selling beer in bars and restos. In the low 40's, the market IS CURRENTLY pricing in shutdowns."
"Non-alcoholic carbonated beverages, some infused with CBD and some with CBD and THC go on sale in Canada sometime this month."
"Get ready for more of the TAP PR spin with Topo Chico. Big announcement that they are going national because they can support the demand. Just what we need another hard seltzer about 2-4 years too late. Translation: is we are desperate for revenue and will stuff the pipeline to get it, and tell a fairy tale on the earnings call in October. Next: they will become silent on the brand by 2Q22 and pull it by end of next year after an awful summer. This is the TAP playbook my friends."
When you accept and reward failure like this management team you get more of it. Back to 40 soon.
Squeeze is just starting
Squeeze. LOL. Just wait. back in the $30's by spring and you know it.
Significant amount of insiders selling. Never a good sign.
nice article about the earnings dates of Aphria n Coors on the same day
"I think The Board should consider to divest european division"" In fact, Europe which accounted for only 16% of our revenue in 2020 contributed to 61% of revenue decline, and 83% of our EBITDA decline for the year, and 92% of the revenue decline and 56% of our EBITDA decline for the fourth quarter."""
uh oh. MC earnings call coming on 12 February. Like the last 2 years will it be more volume and share decrease? Worried. Very worried.
SAM is nearly double the market cap of TAP now. Never in my wildest dreams did anyone see this coming. TAP management must be replaced.
"The bull thesis is a cash flow story. Too many people are addicted to growth at whatever cost these days—grab a beer, chill. The comps will get easier heading into FH21 and sales will undoubtedly recover with the reopening of restaurants. The real question is: can the co satisfy its debt obligations in time to fully realize the incredible cash flows. If not, co will need to divest of assets, which dilutes expected future cash flows. Like I said in an earlier post a TAP short position pairs perfectly with a SAM long— classic long/short hedge fund strategy— this trade is super stretched. I expect a mean reversion heading into end of year. Shares will also get a little help if management can assuage debt holder worries by delivering incremental Q/Q improvement across all metrics with sustainable guidance."
Where's Gianni? stock going down below share price prior to recent earning report. Gianni!! Where are you?????
"Another down day for Molson Coors. All that debt and reinstatement of such a small dividend let's wall street know what terrible financial straights this poor company is in. Completely new management team is needed. If management isn't replaced, stock will be in the $30's again by the end of the year."
"Warren wouldn't invest in a beer company, but if he would, this would be it. Significantly cheap against their peers, vastly oversold, Great Brands, Great Cash Flows, 10x earnings, pays a dividend, predictable business model. Buy the stock, don't look at the price until 2025, click reinvest dividends, and you will make a boatload."
"$6 craft beer or $6 six pack , will the average consumer change ?"
This stock is a good long position. Earnings at the end of the month plus peoples alcohol consumption has gone up since COVID-19. You're looking at better yields on the back of this!
The Rock's energy drink exclusive to $TAP easily worth an extra $3 per share load up while it's cheap.
"""The Denver company reported first-quarter profit of $278.1 million, more than the $208.5 million for the same period last year.""And this was for Winter Months.................."
"while I agree that management hasn't done the best job the last few years, growth projections at other beverage companies are very similar. Down this year and regaining most back next year. TAP is by far the cheapest packaged beverage company out there. Price to enterprise value is as follows, KDP 4.9, Bud 4.3, coke 6.9 and Tap is 1.67. If it doesn't start going up, someone will want to buy."
Insiders buying is a great positive sign.
Is it just me or is this sell off a bit overblown? Down 12% and they actually beat what was expected? Other companies who reported similar results are down 2% and 3%.
@john I agree. Another problem the company has from what I hear is there on NO accountability and they protect their own. Especially in the US division. The place is run more like a hobby as opposed to a business. There seems to be no set hours for white collar workers. people arrive and leave their offices at leisure. So many just work from home. Very different when all were expected to be in the office for 8 hours every week day. Sloppiness and no accountability now prevail. Sad to see what this company has become.
"Could be turning on the weekly chart, I'm bullish. It's also outperforming its peers on a relative basis over the past few months."
Insider buying
"Marketing for the TAP brands are awful. Hard seltzers a disaster. Again the company doesn't know their business. First they were late with the seltzers, then they build huge brewing capacity and now the segment is dying. Wreck. Hopefully a new marketer with better ideas for the balance of the year."
Michael Burry recent buy is an endorsement of TAP's deep value. It co-incide with the Seeking Alpha article in recommending TAP.
TAP one of the best risk/reward opportunities out there. A cornerstone in my portfolio.
"@John don't forget about the TAP move into cannabis. Once again, waited too long and then went in timid. Same strategy with their entry into hard seltzer. A day late and a dollar short. I can't believe this management team has survived for so long."
Reinstating dividend shows the strength of business. It has reduced another 2 billions debt. Job well done.
Wonder how this management team can stay on with a clear conscience...
what happened to that squeeze dougie?
"Opening up play with 30-50% near term upside due to beaten down valuation, in my opinion. Has become one of my top by last few weeks...."
Results were just awful. The CEO blaming the weather is a total joke. Time for some serious changes at the top. This company failed to see and act on the changing tastes and preferences of consumers.A weed infused beverage will not save this company.I own 300 shares and wish I sold. The dividend will support the price for now but this company needs to pivot and merge with another.
Molson makes more money on retail formats vs on premise and also owns majority of Truss Beverages with Hexo....expecting nice positive surprises next 2 quarters.....the forward valuation offers way more upside vs downside risk.
stock will plummet soon. im hearing Heineken no longer inyerested in purchasing due to TAPs excessive debt load. more attractive as a buy out candidate at a market cap of about 7 to 8 billion. that's about a 25% drop from current valuation. this company is dead money. dinosaurs running the place with feckless board of directors. Can't fathom how TAP execs are some of the highest paid in the industry and all they've done is decrease share price for 7 solid years.
"I'm surprised there was no bounce. It's appears this is going to be dead money for a while. I really like the stock, but I can't commit the money."
There has not been a better time to buy TAP since April 2014................ Of course.....if you bought in April 2014..........you might not be very happy...........:o) but don't forget you got some dividends.
"Just dropped a toe in on this one. If nothing more, it allows me to justify drinking a little more after work."
"Correct me if I'm wrong but TAP has made a lot of seemingly good deals recently from getting into cannabis via Truss beverages, Coke, Yuengling, and are focussing on premiumizing their brands and adding newer beverage styles from Seltzers, trendy beer brands, etc etc. Isn't all this signs that the company is awakening up and turning around? Isn't this different compared to when the stock was $70 etc?? Why isn't the SP reacting and climbing higher? What am I missing?"
"After doubling its sales from acqusitions, writing off and increase plant efficiecy are expected. quarter to quarter comparison may be misguided. I would buy more as Molson will expand to China as scale matters."
As soon as dividend is cut look for 4 to 7% immediate decrease in stock price.
"TAP will be trading at or below $37.35 by March 15th, 2021. BANK IT!"
"Haven't seen any posts on product news. Vizzy variety pack 2, vizzy lemonade, Coors pure, and new MGD packaging plus vizzy launch in canada. With summer and live events and all, it might get interesting for Coors."
"Great opportunity to buy the dip this morning. So many positive catalysts... bars re-opening, live sports coming back, ZOA crushing it, Topo Chico hard seltzer crushing it, dividend re-instated later this year, Coors Field hosting MLB all-star game."
TAP will rise as bars and restaurants open
Who all thinks this needs to pull back to $38-$40/share before going higher? I am willing to bet that it does!
"Been a long-term holder due to the valuation. Seems like analysts are finally turning more bullish on it. The new management is executing nicely on their plan. And the economy reopening is another catalyst. Still significantly undervalued to peers, but I think TAP is a better business than the other players."
Oh wow Thad is still here faithfully bashing TAP... Looks like D variant has opened this trade back up for another round.
"OK, I will say it since no one else will.... impressive to finish green on Friday with the two downgrades. Downgrades seem very short-sighted to me. I think it's pretty obvious that their #'s over the next year will look a heck of a lot better than last year. The beer is going to be flowin' this summer in the U.S. I have a feeling."
"Ok, i thought we are on our way to recover from this disasterwhat is happening today when overall market is up?"
Train wreck of a management team. What happened to Sol. CEO communicated huge expectations to the street and went nowhere. Another example of no accountability.
"Yahoo shows earning growth of 99% and P/E of 11.39. I guess tbat it can increaae dividend year after years with the debt decreased to a comfortable zone, and expanding drinks beyond beers."
so this stock is now at the same prices it was in 2014. Thar is concerning to me. what are your thoughts ?
I own both ACBFF and APHQF in my retirement fund. I strongly believe TAP will partner with APHQF.
Stock will be back in mid to low $40's soon. BANK IT!
hydro is the winner
"boohoo now im only up 32% since buying in 6 months ago. This is why I said 60$ by summer, thats when covid restrictions will be lifted. Next quarter earnings will be even worse, then its an easy uphill climb."
Debt clearly weighing on this too. CEOs are criminals. Kneecapping shareholders with debt and depressed stock prices from overpriced purchases. They should hang.
I finally get what @Bunny was talking about with all the posts about TAP's increased efficiency. TAP very efficiently had been eroding share price and stockholder value. Could we please get rid of the entire feckless management team and hold our employees accountable?!Board of Directors please take note that big changes to personnel are needed. Dividend cut coming soon.
"Love how this is green for the day, while Nasdaq is down a whole 1.5%, great value stock at current valuations. Hoping this goes back to 32 so I can load up more."
The street finally on to the shenanigans at MC. Can only go lower. I would think about when its at $42.
"Strong brands, very cheap stock. Tons of upside here if you're patient. Right at its previous bottom."
"Hi, whats the difference between class A and class B shares (TSX) ? Thanks !"
"This is really a leadership issue. It is all about cost cutting, getting out of Europe and India and concentrate about US beer drinkers. And realize that MC is the only old large US brewery left - and tell the americans the fact. I think Gavin is too much of a nice guy. I doubt he can initiate the urgent change.."
LOL the one red day yesterday had yall short-sellers pretty excited. Was a nice discount for the people like me around here that can actually read a financial statement :)
"9b USD valuation, trades at 8-10x net income, 1x top line, nice brand line up, owns 49% of the beer store in ontario, concerts and sports reopening play, will automate production in breweries, weed drink play too, largest domestic US brewer"
@Josh I think this stock will drop to mid $30's by late winter and could be a great stock to invest in at that point if they bring in a completely new management team. If same leadership team remains then expect the same results of the last 8 years. Feckless board of directors needs to take action. This once great company is slowly dying due to managements foolish decisions and horrible licensing deals.
Can't believe it. Just keeps getting worse today. Could the board of directors please clean house and sack most of the leadership team here so we could start to rebuild this company??? I'm way underwater and can't sell and have been waiting for over 7 years for a turn around that NEVER comes. only constant during that time has been this same management team. Dinosaurs lining their pockets at shareholder expense.
"Thad is mad, Tap bouncing very nicely up. Should have covered your short position Thad."
profit taking or did something else happen?
Well at least we got the short term pop to almost 40 last week. Looks like back down we go for a while.
"Under book value, I'm in!"
Incredible earnings beat. Only aloholic beverage company to beat earnings!
https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/molson-coors-said-to-be-in-talks-with-pot-firms-as-legalization-looms-1.1097480
Surprised to see this pop up so much in one day. Anyone have a clue what went down?
"Between the Topo Chico release, the strong Vizzy product and Blue moon Sky light, this may be the cheapest stock with strong tail winds."
"Tap is back to its long term up trend support line of the long term chart. Fundamentally, you can hardly buy a beer stock at P/E 8 with its stable predictable income"
"""...TAP is very, very cheap and we are hard pressed to give a good upside target here as it may seem fantastic. At the minimum we think that a 12X EV to EBITDA makes sense. Once the debt target is achieved, that would translate into a $95 price (Market Cap of $20.60B, Net Debt of $9.4B & EBITDA of $2.5B).That is a 62% upside here on a large consumer staples stock. Even Anheuser Busch (BUD) is trading at a 11X EV to EBITDA after cutting its dividend and having a 2019 projected debt to EBITDA of 4.7X. We had previous identified this stock as a ""top-pick"" for 2019, but we believe we just heard TAP say, ""Hold my beer"". ..."" Source SeekingAlpha"
The acquisition of Miller was 12 billions. You can pick up the parent company at 13.x billions and wait to harvest the merger benefit for a great risk adjusted return for a steady consumer staple stock that poised for a game changing move to the globe. Time to go all in.
"Holding this until lows 50s, but there has to be a little correction in the short term. This stock has been going up every single day for the past week"
"This stock is going to the moon within the next 4-6 months as vaccine rollout speeds up. Spring and summer 2021 will be a massive year for Molson as people start traveling again and eating/drinking out. Once everyone 65 and up is vaccinated, lawmakers will have to ask themselves if lockdowns should continue if the population responsible for 95% of the deaths is vaccinated."
Coors could learn from Constellation Brands made $700 million invested in Canopy. Coors need ACBFF or APHQF. Don't miss the boat Coors.
TAP can't even stay in the positive on a universal up day. Losing price support at current level is not a good sign.
"Dear Thad, I writing to you today to let you know that TAP is getting ready to rocket. We will not be making any stops on the way to the Moon, so please be prepared for the ride. Love Tap Moon"
"Nice Earnings Report, I'll be back in a year from now when its pushing 100, good buy, you need not reply, I wont read it"
Just maybe the board will call the SEC to look into the group that is manipulating their stock . But they would have to do something as a board to make that happen. Most companies are clueless on how easy it is now for just a few firms on Wall Street working together to manipulate their stock both up or down with the new and improved Wall Street AI computer. you now don't even need to sell shares just place a order to sell. So the board just needs to track the orders place to sell and they will know which firms are manipulating their stock .
"Really looking forward to the earnings release... Sales during the pandemic will speak volumes here. With all the turmoil and uncertainty, it would be likely that people are buying extra Miller Latte's to cope with the stress. Even BUD has rebounded since March.. I think it is safe to add at these levels and ride to $40. Some companies are raking it in during Corona (PTON, MSFT, AAPL, NFLX, etc) why not TAP?"
"Told you so. So, here's what will happen next. stock will bounce up and down a bit and may have a month of slow ride up or a quick bounce up, but over the next year overall it will slide and end up in the low $40's / high $30's by February 2022. BANK IT! Fundamentals are terrible, share and volume of core brands hemorrhaging for the past 7 years, dinosaur management team lining their own pockets at shareholders expense, feckless board of directors and excessively debt laden from way overpayment of joint venture buy out all combine to make this a horrible investment."
Nice pop. Sell lol
Which company is Molson going to buy into? Any inside?
"Aphria pairs up the best for Molson, They have 225 million in the bank, They are profitable, They have the lowest cost per gram. They have international affiliations, Selling to Israel, Australia, Germany, Columbia, South Africa now! They now have a vested interest in liquor stores across Canada which will sell their products, Aurora? too much debt not profitable yet, to many bought deals which are the same as secondary's here."
This is the company that thinks they can fake it with analysts and investors. An excuse every quarter and the story of making great progress with the hope everyone will forget. The marketing is from the 90's and all they do is announce new products that eventually fail. Simple answer. Bring a new management team to get this stock to move higher.
Same problem as bud. Too much competition. Too little pricing power. This will languish
If any company should be bid up its this one. Discounting cash flows into the future the stock is 50% undervalued.
My 5k shares I bought at 51.35 sure is looking good 
"I think that being acquired by Heineken is the ONLY path forward for MC. Question is, is there any value for Heineken in such an acquisition? Of course there is, but not at a valuation of $55 a share. Maybe $40 or $43. MC will continue to erode in volume and share price and Heineken will scoop them up at a fire sale price and dismantle many parts of this non focused dysfunctional company."
"BUD trades at 26 PE, compared with 9 PE for TAPBUD trades at Price to Sales ratio of 2, TAP trades at PS ratio of 0.7BUD has 100+ billion net debt, TAP has net debt of 7 billionNo matter what matrix you are looking at, TAP is trashed like it will not exist 2 years from now.It is disgusting what they has happened to the stock"
TAP is starting to become a dividend high yielder (4.5%).Would anyone invest for that as I am considering???
"Pete Coors sold 40,000 shares at $35.06 on July 2nd (form 4 on MCBC website). Not looking good for Q2 results."
TAP is on a breakout and has passed the resistant at 52.7 as it is showing improving costs synergy from acquisitions.
How is this thing gonna open up with missed earnings and already outreaching its steady pace?

This could be under $40 after earnings. Good buy then.
"I hope you like the AI algo is doing all the heavy lifting. if you feel historical low P/E of 12 for TAP is expensive and buying it close to book value is expansive, please short it, i am happen to borrow you the stock and then call the margin loan."
"Stock benefitted with all others since the election, but when results matter you wont get it with this management team. All they do is push out the turnaround to the next year or two. been the case for many years."
Did you see the three analysts big upgrade on Tap? I am fortunate been buying as finding a great growth and income stock
Shorts are covering $TAP and $MIK as valuation super low and very profitable businesses......they are worried that Robin Hood Game Stop phenom spreads......
What is most scary is the management team on the earnings call were proud of their results. Just shows how low the bar is for this group. A leadership team change will take this to the mid-40's very quickly.
Ok it’s time to reward your shareholders and bring back the dividend. If not no point in keeping. I bought you for your divi and waited when you had to cut it so it’s been a year
"TAP is clearly gearing up for the move to $80. What TAP has going on excites me. First, their expansion into the alcohol seltzer category and their reduction in operational fat were both a success. Second, there will be no BUD commercials during the Superbowl that take aim at TAP this year. Third, TAP is not trading at all with the potential they possess of being first to market in the emerging alcoholic-weed infused beverage market (assuming their partnership with HEXO is actually getting this play right) and actually having a P/E sub 20. Most investors know that all of the publicly traded marijuana companies lose money (which a view TAP slightly as) and this seems as one the safest way to play both of the world's most favorite vices."
"Now that Bunny has showed up pumping TAP. I would run and fast , Why because the firm she works for is shorting and they have all the funds shares to drive it lower . I would wait to buy now until the low $40's. They know how to use the Wall Street AI computer to drive TAP lower. They destroyed M and X and main other stocks. Better to just stay clear and pick up the pieces in the low $40 because that is were they will drive it to. Just my take and what I have seen them do."
Congrats to the (Mis)Management Team in reaching a fresh 600 week low.
Years ago I purchased this stock at 17 a share and sold it at 85. Maybe we can do it again. HEXO may help.
"This is the definition of panic selling! Q1 (historically their softest) accounts for less than 15% of total profit for the year. Management re-iterated their full FY guidance and the market responds with this? Sorry, but this is anything buy rational."
"Sigh, this stock just has cement it it's shoes. Nothing makes it go up. It is depressing."
"Over reaction, it is a buying opportunities as it is likely accounting write down allocation."
Forward P/E of 10 is too cheap a stock to ignore. I encourage everyone to look at their latest qaurterly report on its progress and management indications of steady growth. They should start using the excess capital to buy back shares as debt has come down significantly after the acqusition.
By far the cheapest beer company I've looked at. Buy.

+100$ end of the year
"Tap up over 3% today, people realizing this company is undervalued. For those saying this company doesn't know what it wants to be, It's a Beverage company, not just a beer company. They have realized the opportunities in hard seltzer and energy drinks and have gotten in the game. They maybe a bit late but its always better late than never."
The Cobra Kai Coors spike!! Cobra Kai just hit Netflix and it's the #1 show. Every episode features lots of Coors beer and when I went to the store the Coors section was completely sold out. Coincidence?
"I don't see much of a mention at all about Vizzy in the earnings report. Hasn't been out long but from what I've seen in retail outlets, it's doing well and will be formidable competition for white claw."
I thought I caught this on the ride back up near 51 on August 10th but after touching 52 a day later its been down ever since. I thought it had a good quarter?
"Been waiting for a chance to buy back in after selling earlier this year at $42. Finally pulled trigger againt this AM at $36.47. Missed the bottom (hopefully) but feel the onslaught of recent news is too compelling to wait any longer. Coors Seltzer finally, tie up with Coke, Yuengling and coffee, and reboot of cannabis strategy. Seems like mgt finally gets it and Truly (pun intended) is committed to making this a beverage company. The debt is manageable and the valuation is very reasonable. Coke just may buy it outright next year if their seltzer takes off- basically Coke broke the glass and can have an instant global footprint with TAP. Have to think hedge funds, etc. see the turnaround taking hold. Not too many values like this in the marketplace right now. GLTA Longs"
Mid to low $40's by end of October. BANK IT!
"In 2016, Molson Coors acquired the full global brand portfolio of Miller Brewing Company for approximately US$12 billion. Now you pay 10 billions dollar, an amount less than the acquisition, and get the original Molson free. From 2016 to 2020, TAP has paying off the essentailly the mortgage loan with earning before tax., 5 years have gone by in reducing the mortgage, rationalize the operations and increase products to beverage in maximize utilization of modernized plant. The mortgage is about to pay off, Boom, the free cash flow will take off. I look forward to the mortgage free day and growing the Free Cash generated again. The best COVID recovery stock with lots of weak craft brewery had to shut down for good that cannot compete with the scale and financial flexibility. The end result is that TAP will continue exercise its market dominating position. Its is an over 100 dollar stock still on sales."
I wish I could say something positive but I can't. I even have trouble finding some of the brands in the stores when going through the beer isle. I used to buy keystone ice but haven't seen it in a long time. with an .08 dividend it's not attractive at this price it will probably stabilize around 12.00 that's what my other stocks paying these kinds of dividends are priced at. I think it could be a good company but I don't know what goes on at the board meetings.
"Off Premise alcohol sales:Beer sales were up a strong 21.4% during the 16-week period, with the super premium category outpacing the craft category. YTD off-premises beer category sales are up 16%"
"Interesting, people are actually buying in now, knowing it will dip even lower today."
"I sold my position in Hexo today...up over 100% from buying last summer.....I still like their partnership strategy just feel valuation getting a bit high......I have switched to MOLSON Coors $TAP on basis that they own 60% of Truss, have a beaten down valuation and believe they will benefit from opening up trade in coming months........their valuation both PE and price to sales is way below BUD which is also beaten down. I remain a long term fan of Hexo but will look for an entry point if there is a pull back. My thoughts for what it is worth."
Looks like i started my position at the perfect time about a month ago. Been nothing but green since
New whiskey brand coming.
"Oh, I see why down 6%, makes total sense. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this beer maker would post earnings of $1.57 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.84, delivering a surprise of 17.20%."
P/e is super low and it pays a dividend. They have tons of cash and are exploring new markets. Dunno why in the world this is down today.
"The low was $34.01, and we're at about $37 now. I get they cut the dividend for 2020, but this seems to be an undervalued stock with a consensus target of $45. Am I missing something?"
Expect the usual 5-10% drop after earnings.
When are we going to get good marketing?
Who in their right mind is buying this stock today after such bad earnings? This thing will drop significantly after open.
Rest assure that Molson family name is on the line. They have invested wisely for the continousđ growth of beverage shares. THey have large vested interest.
Will the Yuengling roll out in Texas have any meaningful growth for the company?
up in pre market..will it possibly get to 1 year est of 43?
"This company is so confused with what they want to be. Beer, yes but declining. Seltzer. Energy Drinks. Whiskey. Trying with all but too small to matter and becomes a cost and eventually a failure. No scale. Either go big or go home. it is a poorly designed strategy that will in time result in weaker business performance and stock price."
"i just bot in after hours for 38.88. A 6 percent dividend rate is pretty good and the company seems to be solid. Sold off a couple of duds to pay for it, such as FLR and ERJ. I also bot GBX, another solid company with a solid dividend. Hope this is fruitful."
I bet TAP makes announcement about their joint venture with HEXO (TRUSS BEVERAGES) to start selling Beverages in Colorado this ER.
Insiders are buying
cutting dividends shows this company will regrow in short term. great way to save capital while summer will skyrocket the price. we all need a drink right now
"AND... Premarket open TAP has already given back ALL the gains made yesterday after the ""spectacular"" (LOL) earnings call. I told you so. And so did many others."
"Another synergy is realize, contribute to the continuous improvement of great free cash flow, market expansion and increase profit margins. Bullish"
"This CEO has lost share for 12 years at TAP. If the CEO ""retires"" and an outsider is brought in to restore growth, and bring in a new team the stock will double in a year."
"I have a minor holding in TAP from last summer and will certainly own up to the fact that I do not keep a close enough eye on this name. We seem to have some decent strength/resilience lately. In your opinion, is this in sympathy for Boston Beer’s report, the relative value of TAP to broader market or something else? Hoping to hear more cannabis-infused products on the call. I know the boys behind Blue Moon are working on something for us. GL to you all and thanks for your insights"
"Massive Molson Coors plant takes shape in Chilliwack. About 100 brew tanks of varying sizes are in place across the space. it will supply the western Canadian market, This is efficiency and modern plant that will boost profits and revenue."
"Bought this at an average of 34$ with a plan of selling in the low 50s, but at this point I don't see deep value anywhere else in the market. I'll just keep it in TAP for now. Easy 60$ by summer. If it ever gets valued at multiples similarly to other beer producers, this is an 80$ stock."
this is a great American company. no mater what happens people will crack a cold one. proud to be long and strong
"Thad told me to come back here today. Here I am, but the first digit of stock price is not 3 though."
"BBBY short squeeze was pretty good, up 400% this year.Bear in mind high short ratio that fuels high institutional ownership is bullish.Shorting stock in sister funds can increase long position and goose returns in flagship funds, effectively transferring wealth from the sister fund to the flagship fund.Thats why short ratio is still high, the wealth transfer is still in play."
"In case you haven't heard the vaccines work.Selling today makes no sense. Yesterday's results before vaccinations is basically meaningless news. Moving forward restaurants, bars, stadiums, will sell again."
Here is a good read for all $TAP investors. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4129724-cheap-beer-cheap-stock-consider-adding-molson-coors-portfolio
"I own a bar/liquor store in the Rocky Mtn region. Miller & Coors just raised wholesale prices by 5%. Bud did not. Miller stuff barely sells but Coors/Coors Light does well but now they are more expensive than Bud across the board, including on tap in the bar. Doesn't seem like the best strategy in a flat to declining market..."
The shorting crew is running out of sellers. Here are the big owners of TAP and your going to find it gets harder to get shares to cover withhttps://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=TAP
"Well Bunny, are you sure the ""secret insider purchases"" weren't just soon to lapse stock options? Do your research before posting. Volume fell 4.7% last quarter. Dying industry and feckless management team with increasingly poor internal financial controls tells me not to invest in this company. I see only more disappointing earnings moving forward. So do all the analysts. Read their reports. This company is dead until Canadian and United States management teams are replaced. Prediction: dividend cut coming soon and more lay offs especially in the bloated USA division."
March towards 100 can be expected..... The doubling of revenue & volume from 2016. The stock price should double from where it was in 2016. The surge is just the beginning.
Bloomberg report that Molson Coors is delivering more beer to the United States than expected. Roaring 2020s underway
Boston Beer just noted that emerging brands have taken share and they reported a big miss. May as well have name dropped TAP here baby we’re on our way
Next buy point is $36.75. BANK IT!
"I just purchased 1,000 shares for the same reason. I’ve never owned the stock before. "
Clank! Wow! I think that's the sound of the market price hitting the bottom! Maybe it's time to buy some more!
"Boston Beer up 20% today and big time for the year. When you hire the right CEO it makes a difference. MolsonCoors missed the opportunity to hire him and this is where it stands...a 60+ week low. So, don't blame COVID next week. Just hire the right management team."
"Short position entered. Short term technical correction. No fundamentals behind it. Yep, you heard it."
Boston Beer market cap: 6.842BMolson Coors market cap: 7.555BNever thought I'd see them that close...SAM soon worth more than TAP
"TAP growth plan is in traction. The craft beers vendors were knocked out by pandemic due to lack of distribution and financial capability, many will go brankrupt while TAP is picking up the market shares. Moving forward, the dominance position is solidified further and in a position to grow."
millennials don't drink beer? volume have dropping for the last few years b4 covid. permanent change?
"I've spent my money on buying the beer not the stock. Too late to get in, or only the beginning of the turn around?I see great potential in the Rock's/TAP's new energy drink."
"I own quite a bit of $KO, but I'm intrigued by TAPs moves lately. I like they are diversifying their drink selection with partnerships into THC drinks and now with $KO. The partnership didn't do much for $KO stock yet, but at these prices I might just be a buyer."
"They have growth in their terrapin brand who’s cornered the market for weed-flavored beers in the southeast. Unfortunately, many other brands are restaurant dependent, which makes this a quasi reopen trade. Although, 2nd quarter profits/cash flows definitely didn’t disappoint with strong DTC resurgence. Deeep value around these levels. I took a bite today."
