"49% held by Institutions, I'm sure they analyzed this outfit inside and out before committing their capital. Hold LONGS!"
Where is the talk on this!!!
Aprea is way under valued. With good news this is a 10 bagger. 100 million Dollar valuation is a joke with all the indications this drug is good for. Deep pockets are watching
APRE looks unshakable
Still holding. It's nice to be green.
After reading some arrivals it seems people thing this will trade around 4.00$
Expect some upgrades/research notes before the week is out.Should provide some upward momentum
what is happenning after hour?
I shorted this big time yesterday wonder what Timmy thinks LOL
I think by Friday or Monday we will have good run
They need to provide the FDA with more data on adverse events related to milo disease patients taking Azacitidine and Eprenetapopt. I'm a nervous bag holder now.
The shorts should cover today and tomorrow in to new year.200K shares plus traded premarket and so far holding well. only a 4 cents drop!IMHO this will close above $6 Today.
"Its going to be $8 by next week. After that it will either go down or up based on news. Nice time to buy though, ignore the 3 day rule."
Open tomorrow above $12+ on major deal with big pharma
Good news coming from Aprea Therapeutics After hours today.
They need to use SL7A11 instead of TP53 as a more accurate biomarker for finding patients to treat.
"The gap from yesterday has closed.Apre will revisit the last December ph3 with new info this qtr..Yesterdays news was great.INSIDERS OWN 10% which is huge..125 million market cap is very undervalued.They have half in cash, last but not least there are multiple indications for this drug...Look at IMMU same deal..."

"Hi folks, i have read through the presentations, they have suggested a further usage of their primary drug, the data currently was based on a very small sample, therefore if they extended the sample size, the results may be entirely different from what they got last month.Also the APR-548 First-in-Human Clinical Trial of APR-548 in TP53 Mutant MD will be commencing soon, Following completion of FIH Phase 1, possibility to explore expansion in MDS, AML or other indicationsif you believe P53 has anything to do with cancer treatment, then it may be a buy for you, The company has 3 years of reserves to last and they will need to attain success by then, unless bought out by a bigger Firm."
"seeing some ah activity. on the upside,"
https://formwhispers.com/s?t=SELB&i=1055624
"wow, the pain is over"
Will top $7.50 tomorrow. The call options are exploding.
Come on to da moon
Aprea Therapeutics is up 8.04% to 4.03
Is it going to be a meme stock or what.
wow all back now
APRE is sinking. The ship we are in hit an iceberg and the hole is letting water in. The smart ones are in the life boats watching us sink. I am crazy for still holding and staying in this boat. I know this is familiar to many others who hate to lose. I am just angry at this stock for taking so much from me. I know there's others that feel the same as me.
Quality CEO and team..look at CEO track record ...Every where he worked gets bought out by big Pharma......100 mill market cap is undervalued.We have 77 Million in cash alone.its a bargain
Super interesting article published in Nature July 15th discussing APR 246.https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-021-03988-y
"I think when this stock will go up, I won’t be even excited...after waiting so long, all that excitement just faded away"
Volatility on this one is wild. Cup and handle forming? Or maybe it goes vertical?
$APRE move some over to CEMI has covid19 antibody tests that are FDA approved for emergency use
Recovering well ONCE AGAIN which proves the confidence we have in APREA
"One Word: « SKYROCKET ». Without any limit, let’s GO to the moon."
This bio has had multiple issues this year with their trials - the first caused a 90% collapse when their end-point missed its target. This pause sounds like those enrolled are having potentially dangerous side effects. This might be a dead end company
It seems momentum just started. 11% now
The pump on twitter is real.
"What happened to the volume? 10% of average volume to troubling. Still holding strong, but getting a slight bit concerned."
Bought 500 shares will keep for 3 months to see where it goes.Gl!
This looks like its going to run to 6 again. Wild weeks.
Looks to me that the selling is over done!!should head north and fast with in days. $10 in 2 weeks or less and then higher from there.
Why up so much after hours?
Holding through the up's and down's until I see 10 or 11.
How does a bio with 11 employees burn $55m/year?
Tough day but I'm holding because I'm optimistic they may be able to respond to the FDA and get the clinical hold removed.
"FDA would have never granted fast track phase 3, If the earlier trial had not met at least 90 percent positive results. You can look it up on FDA.GOV"
"On a normal day APRE would have traded up 20-25% and perhaps closed up 10% Normal, healthy, and up from there, In this crazy market well, not so healthy. But under $5 this is a screaming buy, the study news was great. Cash position is solid, and this management doesn't dilute just for the heck of it, the don't even run ATMs as far as I can see.Easy buy here, great long term hold. I just added 5k"
what's happening?
"The price move is nice, but the volume leaves me feeling insecure about an advance."

No walls from here to $30...go APRE!!
"I like this name long term, but I'm not gonna ride it down under $4 with all the momentum buyers dumping. Will look to re-enter sub $3.9"
"New to this stock, can someone tell me what happend and why this dropped from 45$ down to 5? Thanks !"
wow ....maybe an fund?some news?
Wooow
"Good luck longs. Will be cheering APRE on. Never thought about flipping the shares for sure and I sold towards the end of the day.I had to sell out with a $3,600 loss on 5k shares. Did a covered call strategy on MARA (bitcoin and I don't believe in it one bit lol).Sold 10+k shares of APRE in tax-free accounts with barely a profit (a day hold) and moved the funds to PSTH (Bill Ackman SPAC).This stock is definitely a buy to $10, or even $15."
I need help to understand why we go up to 6 after market and then loss everything the next day. I can can’t seem to wrap my head around it.
Any thoughts??
APRE Added on this dip under 5$ Phase 2 Data due any day W New Insider Buying

"I don’t understand why people expect a dilution. They have 77m cash. Read the quarterly report statement “As of March 31, 2021, the Company had $77.6 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to $89.0 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020. The Company expects cash burn for the full year 2021 to be between $30.0 million $35.0 million. The Company believes its cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2021 will be sufficient to meet its current projected operating requirements into 2023.”"
What happened??! Glad I sold
"Man, this looks like I'm holding for a much longer time than I thought."
Can’t hold this anymore. Sold allmy shares today and won’t look back lol. Their trial always have problems
Party over before it began Volume vanished. I'll be shorting this from right here and I'll cover at $3.50 then I'll ride it back up. Let's all make money everyone
I think a realistic price target is 24.00
"Their last trial update, that caused the near 90% SP collapse, was a monumental failure but this is really oversold. If they can avoid another disastrous trial report, this could easily be a double/tripple. fingers crossed i'm long at $5"
Nice recovery.
"With that « révolutionnaire » APR-246, W’ll go to the moon !!! Skyrocket "
"holy cow, ANOTHER trial on hold due to side effects??? Their entire pipeline is imploding good lord"
"These guys are phase 3 late stage with fast track granted.If one has cancer with a tumor growing and chemo doesn't respond,Which happens often enough, Their Drug is an end game. if I had cancer and 3 months to live I would deffenetly try it.With enough trials and failure comes modification and end result is FDA Award.Then comes a buy out from a BIG Pharma!I am here to buy buy buy."
even need to work after hour? $5.35 now
Aprea focuses on developing cancer therapeutics that reactivate the mutant tumor suppressor protein p53.
Big run up coming!
Anyone see an exact July date for the P2 results anywhere?
APR-246 will change the world !!!
I'd given up on this stock but the data was quite good just don't like the price action. Half the float trading AH last night shouldn't be dumping like this today. smells more like a retail shakeout than an actual sell off
"If you were expecting a 50% jump today, it isn’t likely. However, middle of August might be a different story. 12.50 and 15.00 calls for 08/20 are picking up traction. Slow and steady wins the race. GLTA."

"just checked, never thought I'd get it but I just got 300 shares @ 5.36.really lucky. Proves my point... Patience. I really got lucky!! I also hope some of you did wait and got a good price deal. Thank you for those who listened. GLTA Peace C"

check out SELB moderna founder buying millions in SELB
holy cow this was $40 this time last year - took a 90% haircut over that failed endpoint. Biotechs rarely recover from that but this really feels oversold here
everyday is new low. please go up. work harder
Picked some up 5.20s if it goes to 4 then will add.
Heating up once again. I wonder when will it break the resistance at 5.9.
"More than the entire float has traded in a single day and we still have 75 minutes to go. You might ask yourself how, but that will be answered in another 30 days."
this needs a newsletter pump if its going to do anything at all with this rally
$25 price target. it's just getting started.
"This is a sneaky good play for a long hold. Price bottomed out or close to it, was once a $41 stock. Fell due to one set of bad data. If you've been paying attention there was a reason for it in that patients were under dosed. That's huge. I also watched both the update on april 22nd, and the conference 2 days ago - and I think this gets back up and then some. They wanted to get in and speak at the conference to share good news if you notice nobody knew until the morning of that they'd be part of it. They mentioned substantial solid tumor reduction amongst other things. When this dropped people stopped paying attention but this is my largest position and a sneaky good play in my opinion."
"most of the patients on these trials have less than 25% chance of cr without this drug. if they can move that needle even a little bit we have a winner and more importantly so do the patients. TP53 mutation is a death sentence for MDS/AML patients. Any positive data will keep this science moving and APR456 will allow patients more time out of clinic. Go Aprea, get it done!"

Waiting for the solid tumor or cll clinical trial read out to send this soaring.
if it hits 6 today or this week brows will be lifted and more buyers will be all over this!
"Study showed great results, APRE back from the dead, way oversoldCould hit $9 easy"
Any news ?
too good to be true
"Just a matter of time before the underwriters call this a buy..Also surprised if insiders don't load up here..Could be a show me phase 3 story..Either way 23,500 shares long at $6.00 ..HOLDING"
Looks like we will have a better idea of what's going on next Thursday
"I like management solid history (willingness to sell), they don't pump, dilute, or run ATMsIf either of these holds was very serious, they would have shut the trials down altogether. I believe they will be resolved in due time.The stock has outperformed lately, accumulation? and/or someone knows something?There is going to be some volatility but I can see the stock closing out the year north of 10 bucksHold on tight"
A 40% decrease of short interest in a month.
"Let’s get a short squeeze on this, this stock at least recover to 12- 15"
Calling it. 40-60$ after data drops.
Still holding until I see 10 or 11 on a poster announcement. Looks like some people are closing short positions to me.
"“BZ: Aprea Therapeutics shares are trading higher after the company announced it presented data from the Phase 1/2 trial of eprenetapopt in advanced solid tumors at ESMO Congress 2021.9/20/21, 4:40 PM”Moving UP once again!!Gltlongs Royco"
"I have read the reports in detail, the P of 0.13 means that the data is insignificant. we need a P interval of 0.05 or below to say it was due to a difference in the therapy given.Besides the data was only based on 150 or so patients, so if there are other trials going on, should wait for them. Remember how Astra Zeneca and folks put up a COVID-19 vax on the basis that half a vial is better than the full one. The data can be modified and now AZN have a deal for vax supply.Re APRE, the APR 246 wasnt their only item, however i agree it was a primary one."
"To new traders, rule 1 never buy in premarket. Reason tons of day traders out there and 10, 20, 30% is a great take for them!! My rule 2 is never buy in the first hour of trading. There is a buying frenzy going on then. I myself wait for the lunch time lull. Usually prices have settled down some . Case in point, we were up over 50%earlier and now 20%. You can take my advice or not. Just trying to help. Peace C"
Aprea Therapeutics shares are trading higher after the company announced that it received FDA Orphan Drug Designation for its eprenetapopt for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.
Will it stay above 5? lets find out!
"There will be little selling pressure after tomorrow, once tax loss selling is over for 2020."
"1. Orphan drug designation 2. Enough cash till 20233. Not lowering doses in trials would end in positive results.——————————————Use common sense, listen to bashers and consider their arguments(do they have a ground?), have enough cash to hold longer!!!"
$101 million dollars in cash and $377thousands in debt.basicly they have over $100 million cash and no debt!cash value of the shares in the float is $10.00 simple math folks.

APR-458 which was on hold since August 2020 is now in recruiting status.
Anyone in medical field?? I’m looking at the blood cancer clinical hold. 1 of the patient is in complete remission. Isn’t that amazing?? Are these clinical hold truly an issue or is fda just doing their due diligence. Many companies go through clinical hold and comes out being approved.

"with the fast recovery of the ATL @4,73 to the numbers of yestersday and filling that gap every shortie should be aware the party is over with no further bad news."
98% upside from here folks.
"APRE is approaching $5.5-5.6 resistance area.Once broken, it will move up to $7.5 - 8 target price.Get on board, now!!!"
"If you have extra cash, BUY.On this I am unfortunately locked, cannot do more, have 60K shares.I am not biochemist, but have medical background.And their trials are very promising for specific drugs like these.Just have enough money to HOLD for longer!And then we can stick a nice wooden peg in hedge funds ...They know the value of this company, but they will squeeze you till last moment, with every possible way they have (probably all legal, right?) to get 30M worth of shares from retailers."
"So many groups of investor! Something is under the table with a HUGE increase of that share, very soonest "
RBC says PT is $10
$25 gap filler with some juicy news.
"Resolving just one issue will take it back to heights. Let’s see, I am going to keep holding until a clear news."
what’s going on ?
one patient achieved COMPLETE REMISSIONgood could outweigh the bad herestock could trade up soon enough
Could reverse and close above $7+
Are they going to get rid of clinical holds ?
it could reverse anytime and go up like CRVS
"With that « révolutionnaire » APR-246, W’ll Go to USD 85,00 !!! Skyrocket "
should I sale or hold?
"Look like no one watches this but me and 5 other people, up to 100k shares at 4.68 avg, please support me and buy up while u can down here, there are penny dropping this on low volume 100 shares trades"

The phase 2 results were stellar so I can't imagine phase 3 being that much of a diseaster
I took an initial position with 5k shares. I just don't understand why a company with such fundamental and $77 million cash has such a small market cap. Can anyone shed some light? TIA
The daily chart looks so bullish to me. Weekly chart also looks going up. All the technical indicators are ready to go up.
This will be 25-35 a share within 6-18m
"After hours will be some positions closing?With this volume, price moved just half point...Someone will be losing a lot of money..."
It is recovering because the 2 major bad news are out already.
Oversold. Still holding. I hope some good news occurs in the last half of the year.
Morgan Stanley will push a bit more up and shorties will eat margin calls!

something going on.. who keep collectiong this which means some good one coming for this. No vol. but still showing some buying. Hold you will see something.
Got 2000 shares @ $4.3 and sold this morning.
I’m bummed about this one. In at 5.46 average with 750 shares. Thought it would recovery to at least $7 pretty quickly. I’m thinking of holding until next week. I’ll see how rest of day plays out. Does anyone think this will really plummet below $4? It was just above $20 before the study bombed less than a week ago. Hope to see at least some recovery!!
Massive selling taking place!!!!
Is it a good time to buy this?

New not near as bad as pushed to be. Obviously a $10 stock at the least.
Hmm $4 again. Time to buy some shares back and hold
"Okay, just stay like this till Friday.Divvys and salary is coming ...and I am buying another 5K...Let the hedges play...anything under 7 I am buying..."
"I added 40% to my position could go lower short term, but WILL go much higher long term. I like that management here does NOT print shares like many other bios."
"Keep an eye out on Monday, around 12 noon Eastern. Their P1/2 results presentation in Europe should start hitting the news. Could be very good or very bad, but based on the after hours movement I think some people already know the results."
"APRE, need to fill gap $ 5 to $ 25. Big news coming. Volume don't lie."
Why would solid institutions one after other downgrade some penny biotech stock? Think about this!! I also think something good is coming.

"Compare PVM Pharmaceutical with APRE, You will know how much deeply undervalued APRE is."
In at $5.60 - should be an easy swing to $9-10
"BOSTON, Aug. 05, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aprea Therapeutics, Inc.(APRE) , a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel cancer therapeutics that reactivate mutant tumor suppressor protein, p53, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has placed a partial clinical hold on its clinical trials of eprenetapopt in combination with azacitidine in its myeloid malignancy programs. The partial clinical hold does not apply to the Company’s ongoing clinical trials in lymphoid malignancies and solid tumors, or the APR-548 clinical trial.There are approximately 20 patients currently receiving eprenetapopt in combination with azacitidine in the Company’s myeloid malignancy programs, which includes the MDS, AML and post-transplant maintenance trials, all of which have completed enrollment. Patients who are benefiting from treatment can continue to receive study treatment. As part of the clinical hold, no additional patients can be enrolled to these trials until the partial clinical hold is resolved. Aprea intends to work closely with the FDA to analyze the data, address the specific questions raised, and seek to resolve the partial clinical hold as soon as possible.“Patient safety is our highest priority,” said Christian S. Schade, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aprea. “Based on the totality of the data we have for eprenetapopt, we believe that it continues to be a promising therapeutic option for cancer patients. We are working closely with the FDA to review the data specific to eprenetapopt with azacitidine in our myeloid malignancy trials and will provide an update when we have additional information.”"
Nearly 3 mm shares traded after hours and up nearly 20%. Let’s see how it goes in the morning and hope there isn’t another Biden/Chinese fumble over night.

APRE New Insider Buying
still holding until I see 10 or 11.
P2 result coming soon? they will announce that in Q2 earning call?
TODAY stock price is STRONGG why?
Aprea has an undervalued market cap for where they are in their science..500 Million is where I believe we should be trading as of now..Aprea will have some FDA announcements in the next 60 to 90 days$9.00. minimum
look at all those 10.00 call options...shorts taking out major insurance
a lot of big names here on s/twits..gap to 24.50...should get back there.
Why did this go up 16% after hours with no news?
"Just bought 60k worth, $10 in 2 months."
APRE Phase 2 Data Due in July so starting tomorrow... trading near cash here low float bio tech near the bottom of the chart new to this stock buying down here
This is the only bio stock with 2 good data in a month & the stock getting hammer without any????
Another hold 
Nice move once again when there is blood all around. Any news?
goos news for shorters. cheers long holders..
well I don't think it's good
are we trading at cash now
Nice pop to the upside. Great way to go into the weekend.
phase 2 result and vig new we can go back where it belong. above 40
Aprea Therapeutics is up 7.61% to 3.82
Seems short is slowly recovering
"This is being downgraded, Abraham, because their entire pipeline has collapsed, their trials are failures and the company's entire bio initiative is dead. Thats also why its lost 90% of its value in 6 months. The FDA will likely shut them down completely after pausing multiple trials recently. Great short to delisting"
I bought at 54% on the day and I Lost 10% should I hold??
Maybe the big spike is just related to filling option contracts?
Today we burried our beloved mom who died with MDS after many years of Myeloma. This investment is blood and every penny I potentially earn will be reivested in charity for research. i really hope Aprea succeed
