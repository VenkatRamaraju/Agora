"The government, with clear leftist tendencies, has ratified Julio Velarde as director of the Central Reserve Bank (BCR) and has appointed 3 other good economists as board members. It is pending that the congress, with right-wing tendencies, propose another 3 directors. I see this as a sign that the government will carry out a responsible management of the treasury in the coming years. https://gestion.pe/economia/bellido-ya-firmo-ratificacion-de-julio-velarde-en-el-bcr-nndc-noticia/?ref=gesr"
Why is this stock not falling 80%. Perú is basically Venezula after this election. The new president makes Evo Morales look as Harvard PhD. So sad for Perú.

"Im holding a big position in Credicorp. People are all talking about Chinese stocks like BABA and TCEHY but IMHO they are riskier because a totalitarian government like the CCP can wipe those companies out overnight. Instead, I am looking at BAP valued as if Peru is falling off a cliff all the while Peru has relatively strong institutional and democratic foundations making it a perfect buying opportunity to me. What differentiates Peru's situation right now is that the integrity of the institutional framework isn't wiped out by a coupe such as those that happened in Venezuela or Cuba in the past. Its virtually impossible for Peru Libre to implement their Marxist agenda. Therefore the fear is likely overblown and investors will eventually be drawn in again by the strong economic growth of Peru, its expanding GDP and the vast amount of minerals which are in high demand right now and for many years to come (such as copper). Future growth will be a huge tailwind for this company."
"I am buying Monday thru the whole week on BAP to accumulate if pullback. I run a machine learning and scan intrinsic winners. BAP came out on the top along with CRM, AAPL and AMZN. So I expect BAP to 200-250 in Q2-Q3. Banks are solid in South America, the same pattern as of USA bank last year. US banks sore too much. Banks in South America grow faster than here cuz there are more micro businesses than USA, plus interest rate in higher than USA. So Banks are more profitable in Latin Counties than USA"
"Entered under 100 usd... Deep value. This will pass. Peru has strong institutions, strong economy and low debt."
no one here?

"BAP 200 level is coming. Buy and accumulate from now on. Hedgie's game will end . BAP beat EPS/revenues last Q1. Shorties cannot manipulate truth. Eps/revenues are TRUTH. News from South America:""The Central Reserve Bank (BCR) on Friday raised the growth projection for Peru's domestic demand from 9.6% to 10.3% for 2021.BCR Governor Julio Velarde indicated that growth in 2021 would be supported by the dynamism of domestic demand following the relaxation of sanitary measures in addition to external demand recovery.""In 2022, the growth rate may stand at 4.5%. The projection scenario assumes an environment of macroeconomic stability and policies that favor investment and the creation of productive employment,"" he expressed.Leading growth:The official pointed out that Peru will experience an economic expansion of 10.7% in 2021. Thus, it will register the highest growth among countries of the region. """
"Peru's congress approved Castillo's proposer cabinet. Congress is giving good counterweight to Castillo's government in preventing a worst case outcome (rewriting of constitution into a Marxist-Leninist state). Peru will face another period of ""disgobierno"" but at the end of it not much will have changed. The fear is overdone and long term this price is a great deal to pick up. This political crisis is temporary and won't have long term impact on the economic trajectory of Peru. Great buying opportunity."
"8/13: Well, the quarter over quarter revenue is up. The country has 35% foreign currency reserve. However, primarily as a result of relatively high taxes and administrative costs, the EPS missed the estimated amount. Bummer."
Anyone knows what is the reason for pull back today? Or any insights?
What's the cause of this major drop?
love dividends yummmy
"A big aspect of Peru economy and subsequent BAP performance is the price of copper commodity. https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/copperIf you look at the Q1 2021 earning presentation, the earlier slides CEO shows the price of copper to the analysts.Tough balancing act for BAP in the upcoming earning report. Disclose significant profit, the executive branch of the government will receive the fuel to demand higher taxes.Anyhow I did buy the dip on Friday, lets see what August 12 discloses.The drop in share price has nothing to do with the performance of the company, rather the political climate and the perceived detrimental regulatory environment to follow. Hope Peru's bigger brother China can knock some sense into it, after its latest crackdown debacle."
10/7: So what happened today? Why is it up 8%?
Deep value
"8/11: All the bag holders, ready for the 2Q 2021 earning? It will be posted at close of business.https://credicorp.gcs-web.com/financial-information/quarterly-resultsI am expecting BAP to have a stellar quarter. Back to posting EPS of 40+ SOL per annum or 10 SOL per quarter?Back to issuing dividends?The problem with Peru is the depreciating currency, which is at -15% since the start of the year.I hope the executive branch irrespective of the ideology understand the importance of a strong currency and its impact on the daily lives of working class (both on and off the grid): The ability to buy goods and services on a relatively fixed income.Good luck, I know I need it."
"Well the shamans have cracked some bones, smoked some pot, and have seen the future. The commie school teacher will be the next president of Peru.https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/with-rattles-smoke-peru-shamans-predict-election-outcome-2021-05-26/"
"There is a good margin of safety here. Peru is not Venezuela, Argentina or Bolivia. Castillo is a mediocre president without popular support and incapable of carrying out radical reforms that put the country's economic stability at risk. The Peruvian economy is recovering very well from the 2020 crisis and this will be reflected in the fundamentals of Credicorp that will gradually push the share price up in the medium and long term."
