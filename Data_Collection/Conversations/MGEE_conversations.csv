What's with the huge volume increase today? Anyone have a clue?
Why is this stock down so much?
Down nearly 10% of its high---ouch!
What a wonderful use of clean energy!!! Goo wind farms!
Still over valued

"So far, MGEE is a good stock to own this December."

This company is still way over valued at this point. Just look at the P/E. You are going to pay 28 time earnings for this company. Way to high.

"yea, me too John. The volume isn't great. By the end of the day. It could be down a a buck. So who knows."
Holy cow! Up over 7% today on high volume. Knocking on the door of the 52 week high! What's going on? And this without a dividend increase or new stock split! I hope Scott bought the dip.

"Off topic.Another WI stock that I enjoy holding is AOS. It has an OK dividend that it has been increasing, the stock has split a couple of times recently, and its 2 year chart that looks a lot like MGEE's.It is, of course, a totally different type of company, so I'm comparing apples and oranges."
Wow! MGEE raises the dividend by 4.2% and they still can't keep it over 2% due to the steadily rising share price! Did I mention that I hope another split (3 for 2 or 2 for 1) happens soon?
BB to moon tomorrow
Hey we're inching up!
"All IOU's are out of favor with the investor looking for stock appreciation because of the orange raccoon's tax restructuring. Utilities are required to play under a different set of rules via their regulatory authority when it comes to what they can do with their tax ""savings"" vs other publically traded stocks. Utilities will slowly creep back up as the economy adjusts to the new tax environment. HOLD"
Stock price is at its highest...anyone see a split coming?
All time high today!
Nice day! MGEE closes at the high of the day with decent volume. It would be great to hit and hold $68 and then split.

"What's going on with this company? Does someone know something that rest of us don't know? Today there has been a huge jump in price, up $3.60, along with double the normal volume. Is Warren Buffet going to buy it, or perhaps a Canadian Utility? Personally I hope not, as I prefer to hold my shares, and the dividends that I have been reinvesting since the late 80's. The capital gains will be a tax night mare!"

This just in----from the Department of Redundancy Department---I still support an increase in the upcoming dividend. I also still support another 3 for 2 stock split.I just wanted to get on record on this newfangled message board.
A million shares bought 10/23. Any thoughts???
MGEE is down 9.64% to 56.36
"If this hits $75 I'm selling a small chunk. Its over-valued even now, but I suspect something will drive it up to $75 yet even though its more fairly priced in the 50-55 range."
Dead cat bouncing...speculating on overpriced stocks is showing true colors
"A rare high volume day for MGEE. And an ""up"" day as well!"
MGEE is down 9.73% to 50.42
my dad bought me some Madison Gas and Electric which was called back in the sixties it was very young I still have it and it's made me very rich. I just left it in dividend reinvestment and watched it grow
Up more than 6% today on good volume. High of the day was close to the 52 wk high. Nice.
Looks like a new high today. It would be great to hold onto $68.
Whoa! What's going on? Why is MGEE dropping like a stone?

"Awesome! I'm probably the biggest cheerleader on this board, but this lofty PPS is surprising even to me. If there's another split in Q1 (same timing as the last 3 splits), who knows how high MGEE can go. That being said, I'm a holder, not a buyer, at least for the near future."
YoYo Stock. I don't get it.

Up 5.00$ today? Why?
Investment in Wind. Why?
New High today at 69.12 @ 1:42 CST
Wasn't the price per share about $55-$56 at the time of the last split (3 for 2) back in February 2014? That seemed to work out pretty well. I'm just sayin'....
MGE Energy up 12% ...!

"OK---I'm curious. Why the spike this morning? Anyone know if what, if anything, is going on?"
Are you people nuts. You are buying a company that has a P/E of 31. Now think about that. Are you really willing to pay 31 time earning for this company? I'll sit and wait for now. This company is way over valued at this point.
