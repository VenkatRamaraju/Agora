"Saw the Cramer bit on semi cap eqpt. He was very positive towards the sector, saying this was going to grow and grow, as opposed to creating excess capacity then taking a hit when overcapacity happens. His expectation is the digitization of pretty much everything is not so much a trend, it is the way of the world. And it'll continue for a long time. Which, to be blunt, is pretty much saying what I've been saying up here, too. So many things demand chips these days, and the need for compute is increasing exponentially. Just look at vehicles, they'll need the equivalent of 2 computers to handle autonomous driving (the need for redundancy is essential given the vehicle is making all the choices). That'll be 4x the chip count now. For reasons which were pretty weak, he stated a preference for $LRCX over $AMAT, $ASML and $KLAC. But clearly, he was blessing the sector as much as any one stock."
"positive that it is slowly recovering from earlier sell off. As they said on the call, good demand, just can't meet it, similar to ASML and even Apple (who have recovered). Once the issues are cleared, expect a blow out quarter"
"GlobalFoundries (GFS) IPO in 2 hours, may give semicondutor stocks a great lift."
"$LRCX validated some analyst fears, that the demand for semi capex has peaked and will start to decline. They've been itching to call a peak in the cycle.I don't think this is the case. At all.As best as I can tell, the industry capacity is constrained and its one company which is the primary constraint -- $ASML. If you can't get another litho tool, you don't need another etcher, or implanter -- the stuff Lam and Applied sell. But the demand for chips remains incredibly strong.Imbalances between chip types are causing modest oversupply. For example, PC capacity is constrained by certain 'limited availability chips', but they are not memory chips. So memory chips are not being ordered to fit demand, but to fit what can be made in the constrained world. Memory-maker Micron will see a sharp increase in demand for its chips once these 'limited availability chips' increase capacity. Same thing exists with vehicles. The 'limited availability chips' determines how many chips a company actually needs right now. It may be just 1 chip out of 100 which is constraining capacity, but that's enough. What happens when that 1 chip adds capacity? The demand for the other 99 will go back up in a hurry.Semi capex may take some hits from this issue (there may also be some supply chain issues Lam, ASML, AMAT face). But this is actually a case where the ""problem"" is really too much demand coupled with some specific supply imbalances, not too little. So ASML is the key semi capex player in meeting demand since its the constraint. But every ASML litho tool delivery means more etchers, implanters, etc. My sense is the ASML tools have long lead times since certain items are likely to be very long lead time (EUV optics don't come from Lenscrafters ...)The underlying story couldn't be more bullish. Some analysts think they see a peak. But given the structural demand for chips, they are wrong."
"Wow, just noticed, the forward multiple dropped by roughly 28%(+?), which means earnings for a year from now, will be higher by roughly/almost 28 to 30%. Yesterday, the position was supposed to grow by almost 15% (yoy), now its closer to 18.6%. These numbers are always 'fuzzy'.That could be why the 'pop', in this mornings numbers, the hedgies and institutionals have noticed this, just overnight, because it wasn't those numbers yesterday. (15.65 forward)"
"10/28/2021---Nancy Tengler (of Tengler/Laffer Investments) just promoted LRCX on CNBC. She says it is reasonably priced, in the right areas of chip equipment and you can hold it for the long term. She also says you can buy it here."
Earnings? Yahoo says today. Another source says tomorrow.Anyone here know?
Good earnings from $amd and $msft . Both are relatively flat after hours. Investors were supposedly 'nervous' about these earnings and they were both great. $amat and $lrcx remain range bound and in consolidation mode. Perhaps AMD's conference call will give some insight on CAPEX.
"Sorry MS,I am a buyer of LRCX at these bargain prices.I didn't buy COIN at $233 and I lost out on a $100 move up.Not missing out again.Buy low and sell high."
8.2 Dollars with forward PE ~ 13.5 and growing at 30% clip - stock is dropped after market; Define insanity- no wonder retail revolution with stuff like wall street bets emerging how these guys (wall street) are controlling with big money.
"For those of you that are too lazy to do the research like listening to the CC, I thought I would share one interesting piece of information from the CC.Pertaining to stock buybacks:June 21 quarter LRCX purchased $442M worth of company stock.Sept 21 quarter LRCX purchased $1.2B worth company stock (3X the previous quarter).Therefore they didn't buy much stock in the $630-$680 range, BUT are buying ALOT under $600/share.Further, they are forecasting for the Q4 2021 quarter that their ASP (Accelerated Stock Purchases) will be equal to 3Q ($1.2B....or higher). So follow their lead, it's a buy under $600.The drop in the stock is an overreaction to supply chain issues that EVERYONE is experiencing ."
Dan Ives said demand looks strong in memory and chips for 2022.He confirmed what Archer and Cramer both have said.I am bullish on LRCX.LRCX is hitting on all cylinders.
"Opinion: Think about it .....If you have a management team that know how to make machines that will efficiently lay down a line of silicone one BILLIONTH the width of a human hair, don't you think they would know how to manage their EPS release and forward guidance. I sure do.When it comes to earning releases (CEO)Tim Archer and (CFO)Doug Bettinger know what they are doing."
"An earnings beat, way undervalued, demand remains strong, experiencing high growth, very profitable company, MU today popping due to announcing a price increase....LRCX should be making a run right now."
"Gerry,Which do you like more, LRCX or KLIC? KLIC doesn't look all that bad, but again, I'm kind of leaning towards the triple leveraged stuff, like the Direxion ETF's, and I highly suggest you do the same...'TECL', and 'WANT', has really shot up...SOXL is waking up, as is HIBL.The Ameritrade 'smart score', gives KLIC a '7', I think it was, and LRCX a '10'. It doesn't take much to achieve a '10', w/their 'smart score', ratings, especially tech based positions. L."
"It’s a funny game for Lam. They came out with great guidance, except for the large “range” of guidance. Given the fact that they are spending millions in buybacks, I gotta say it wasn’t by mistake that they had a large range. Why be all optimistic on guidance when that would raise the price, hence having to pay more in buybacks. I like what they did. Now when the buyback is completed, guidance may be better (smaller range). Long LRCX"
"I have watched all investor master classes from $AMAT. I do really recommend them to get a feeling of what trends are shaping up in WFE market. What I understood is that variability of equipment and steps to produce modern chips is increasing. There are new types of processes, which are getting traction like epitaxy, ion implantation, selective etching etc. All these processes are about adding or removing materials to wafers in vacuum. $MKSI is a company, whose main clients are $LRCX and $AMAT and they provide them with subsystems that are used to deliver or remove that material in vacuum. If $LRCX and $AMAT will be growing so will $MKSI's business. But I prefer this company as investment because it is simply cheaper right now and at 1.5-2 times better multiples."
"To my friend Wilford, I just wanted to share some data with you on the performance of LRCX.Let's cover 3 time periods and use the S&P 500 as a comparison.I realize that maybe the Nasdaq would be better but the S&P is a go to for ""the market"".Recent 6 months: S&P 500 =9.2%, LRCX=negative 15%...... (Financial & Energy lead the S&P)YTD : S&P 500= 21.80% LRCX= 17.23%1Year (10/27/20)-(10/27/21): S&P 500 34.51% LRCX= 59.26%So you see ........if you are in LRCX from 1 year ago you are trouncing the S&P (almost double). It's all a matter of your entry price. Mine was actually at $300 for a 1 year return of 83.33%. Those are the only shares I have left. I sold my $525 cost shares in the $620's. I still like LRCX as it has treated me very well.......not lately but I'm OK with that. I can't be crying about how my 83% return is not 125% return like 6 months ago. I think it will get back there. GLTU"
"Listening to bloomberg... They often mention semi equipment companies $LRCX, $AMAT, $ASML but never $KLAC. Even from daily pre-market you can judge that this company is not well-known. Even though it outperforms them in quarterly growth and forecasts too and analysts are more bullish here than there... I guess we need more time and more outperforming quarters before market notices that metrology is outperforming."
Mu to invest billions for memory in the next 10 years . There is no end in sight but news and performance all irrelevant as stocks don't reflect valuations anymore. Haven't for years
Well TSM had an outstanding quarter and guided higher saying semiconductor production will remain tight through 2022 and demand for chips very strong.So where are the analysts from MS and Susquehanna and TrendForce who are predicting doom and gloom? They were proved wrong once again. I expect LRCX to guide higher also next quarter and the share repurchases made during this downturn to add meaningfully to EPS growth. Thankyou to the shorts who helped LRCX buy back shares on the cheap.
Any given day ASML always out performs LRCX. Archer needs to diversify products.
Today growing because of Intel's announcement on significant capex expansion over next 3 years. Confirms growth for WFE market in 2022. $AMAT $KLAC $LRCX $ASML $TER.
B Riley lowered their PT to $750. More accurate than B of A who said $575. Which growth company in history making over $37 annually trades in the $500 range?
Leaked earnings from someone. The equipment makers got hit for no reason. 3 weeks ago in a Q & A session LRCX CEO was extremely positive. All markets strong
"ASML reported earning, revenues, and forward guidance that surpassed estimates and the stock is falling 2.5%. My point is that the earnings, profit , and even forward guidance don't matter. The BIG money determines what the price of the stock will be. The stock's price is seems to be ""disconnected"" to the financials of the company. I think LRCX is undervalued, but lets see what the BIG money thinks when they report."
"Nice recovery yesterday, and good follow thru today........Semi Equipment makers have been and are going to be the rock stars for the forceable future,,,,,Every economic Bloc is going to start building semi plants within their borders in the next decade or two for national security reasons..and there only a few semi equipment makers that they can pay a pile of cash to accomplish this"
Another great quarter for LRCX and another selloff.This tells me there is a coordinated attack on the semiconductor sector by the big firms.They are ignoring the financial results and trying to create fear. I wll be buying some shares tomorrow when the market opens very cheap.
What this company does in simple plain language? Does it have something unique and innovative products? do other companies depend on LRCX? Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
LRCX record earnings and revenue proves that semi is in high demand!!!
As chip shortage improves EPS will hit over $10 per quarter
"People are talking like this was a BIG drop????? There were many days in the past quarter where LRCX would move $15/day Heck it moved up $22/share just a few days ago. A 2.55% drop in the AH is nothing , LAM can recover that in the blink of an eye."
Intel confirming large CAPEX spending in 2022. Along with many others. Applied and $lrcx are going to do well even with some of the constraints. They will ease as such industries will be top priority for materials. The growth is going to be very large IMO.
"I'm not playing earning. What the previous earning taught me is that even after stellar results, the stock won't move up until regular hours."
"SK Hynix shares up 5.4% today, they have dismissed the downturn in NAND forecast by analysts. As this represents a huge part of Lam’s business I am hopeful that there is a turning point coming soon."
Glad I picked more shares up at $542 in early AH. Never seen a growth company with a PE under 14 with a divi
so a $0.16 beat for the quarter is not good enough for analysts now.Maybe losing money is better right? New PT range from $575 to $750.All retain a buy or overweight rating on the stock.I will continue to add shares as the price declines.Demand remains high across the board.Forward P/E is 16.
"I totally agree w/you, Gerry. I was looking just yesterday, and my two major points of entry, which was in early June (this year) in the almost mid 600's. I basically bought at the high's, I think, and sat in it as it tumbled. B?ut I bought then thinking it was going straight up, but you know what they say about hindsight being 20/20. Just the past four months have felt like 2 or 3 years, when other positions you own, are screaming right past LRCX."
"AMD CEO Lisa Su at a conference 3 weeks ago said the semi industry is investing aggressively in new capacity, with 20 new factories coming online this year and similar number in 2022, she also noted that the pandemic has taken demand to a new level with every industry seeking more components that nobody has expected this much demand before."
Strong day considering the negative reaction to the good report from $lrcx . Both stocks recovered much of the earlier selloff.
