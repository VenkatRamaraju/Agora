This company is turning profits while the big sand companies are going Bankrupt. Props to SND! lol
Oversold IMHO. Click on Analysis to see earnings estimates
Chart says buy...so I bought today. Expecting a pop.
"U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. to Explore Strategic Alternatives for Industrial & Specialty Products (ISP) Segment"
It’s already super undervalued if they got 54 million my fair value changes drastically my fair value before this was 6-8$
Management already mentioned they are keeping their eyes open for attractive takeover targets. I'm sure this 54 million will give them plenty of options
in at $5.6
What's up today?
It will come back don’t worry
This is a double by next June!
Good move today but this should be double the pps now!
"I love how natural gas inventories are up and sand per well is way up, but other sand companies are noting declines. This is SND stealing market share. They have put each site on two railways to bid the rails against each other and most of their sand is in reserves and different mesh sizes. Some of those sizes just 24 months ago were bogus and now it’s hot and SND has it. It amazed me that wall st didn’t do more research. The management of this company is playing big ball and wants to own all of Covia assets and some at a steep discount. Low cost producer.. you see in the worst environment ever for sand while other companies are losing. This company is about to post record profit, record revenue growth. It will get above 5 soon because they will be the last sand company standing. Profits matter.. these other companies over extended their hand in other energy material markets. Metals in a deflationary environment creates bankruptcy not market discipline and doing one thing. @born2trade in this situation, doing one thing. Low cost sand.. is the only thing. They sell the lowest cost per ton and still make money.... mutual funds and rules based index funds will buy when it hits 5"
Yes I bought more today. I like their last acquisition which should be acreative to earnings going forward beginning this quarter.
snd announced after hours expansion into the bahkens
"With some of SND’s contracts tied to oil prices, there might be an uptick in revenue after the impacts of the recent drone attack in Saudi Arabia settle into the market."
"Longs, there may not be a pull back from here. A 50% gain is likely by Christmas. A gift from the shorts ... Thank you!"
"Just bought back into SND 2 days ago, liking stock action. Also own SLCA, but at much higher levels. Even thou EPS expected to go down, think that has been factored into stock. SND has not responded with uptick in oil lately, so maybe will be catching up with rest of industry."
How is this still dropping? Oil is still way up and it's down 3% today! jeesh.
"Smart sand is one of my customers, last time I talked to them they said business is good we are humming a long, I supply parts for several sand companies and know several of them have gone out of business, so less competition for SND. I decided to pick up the 3k shares the other day and glad I did."
I would hope the Board will authorize a stock buyback given the current valuation.
The dollar is going lower and oil is going higher. US oil exports are rising quickly. Got some sand?
What is the news?
Most contrarian stock I have ever had. Good report and the SP goes down and down. SND consistently beats so maybe the big money has no idea either. Maybe a good time to buy??
"@David, my dear friend. How is your short going today? Lol!"
"Couple of good buy trades on snd today. 35k, 24k, 14k...… Volume picked up a little too. Buying Istitut. or mutual s????"
"Wow a real management team. Although its not all blue skies and green pastures ahead, the management team was lucid and on top of things. Very different than the EMES calls I have listened too, although thats getting a nice bump today too. EMES couldn't even answer an analyst question on what their estimated contribution margin would be in the new San Antonio plant which I found disturbing. The answer I believe was something to the effect we can't get into specifics on that."
"This business is selling ridiculously cheap. Even if they don’t have the best 2021, a mkt cap of 77 mil is a huge discount for a company who can report earnings of half that in one quarter. Picking up shares tmrw"
Yesterday; Sold out at peak & bought & added even more at late dip. Am still sitting long or waiting for 10 1/2-- 11.
Total POS
My cost basis is $5.12. Still a long way to go.
How did this not reach at least 5$ on that news they literally just got 50 million they can pay off all debt stay bullish something is not right here I’ve been watching this stock since 1$ and have been so confused why the market hasn’t seen it’s value 8$ here we come and honestly 10$ wouldn’t surprise me.
After aquisition settles & smoke clears ; they are setting themselves up for a winner. They know what they have to do to move on & they did it for company to be better ... Sometimes you have to spend money to make money.. Waiting for 2 X Bagger.. JMO LONGGGGGGG
What to do with this company? Down 25%. Should I wait or should I sell?
A very small company; better than expected rev/ erngs; could be lucky break. A smidgen of extra volume to say HCLP is a big deal to SND. But it could mean superior management at SND; certainly bears watching.
Management should be explaining what is going on!
Everyone selling is giving Goldman their buying opportunity.
"SA article on SLB a must read for those invested in sand stocks the comment section is even more interesting as some that have more connections to those in the oil& gas business are stating that the consequences of using cheaper brown sand are already starting to show up in accelerated decline curves it may not be public knowledge yet but if true the rush back to all northern white will be known in the next 6-12 months, with the known slow down over the next 90 days or so due to pipe issues and E&P budgets capped out for 2018 next year should be better for the sand companies."
Saudi oil will take months to come back online and not weeks. Oil isn't done going higher
"Last year company made $35 mil, this year it will probably make >$50 mil. PE of 10 puts it at market cap of $500 mil, or $12.50 per share. Buy it while its cheap."
SND AND SOI TO MERGEMAKES SENSE TO MEhttp://ir.solarisoilfield.com/~/media/Files/S/Solaris-IR/reports-and-presentations/q4-2017-earnings-conference-call-presentation.pdf
remember there is over 30%short of outstanding shares of SND - once the short covering starts - it will escalate it towards $6 again
Earnings beat on top and bottom and management is good. This has been killed by short sellers!
It's going to 6 this year. Buckle up for the ride!
Consensus was for a loss and they had a 91 cent gain. The pps should be double.
"Brad Handler - Jeffries. Here's how he rates.Ranked #4,774 out of 4,894 Analysts on TipRanks (#11,290 out of 11,505 overall experts)LMAO! He didn't even make it out of the bottom 2%."
12.75 by September!
"short interest of 7M shares have a big problem. I expected a good qrt. but I thought analyst estimates were to high, they handily beat them. As long as nothing negative is said on the conf. call technically we will have an island reversal to the upside with first major resistance at 7.35 if analyst raise estimates for the balance of this year and next we could see the 10.60 range by the end of the year that would only be a 8pe on next years earnings. either way the shorts are trapped if the street see's it's that way they may move this fast and seize the moment. happy hunting"
"repurchase of up to 2,000,000 shares in a year easily takes up to the $8 level and if sand price is stable at least for a quarter next year it will beat the $8 Limit. remember now SND is fully integrated frac sand service company."
"Anybody knows why they were very profitable, but the recent 2 quarters had negative gross margin?"
The early Q date news release was a signal that things are not as bad as the shorts want you to think imho.
This stock should be $10.
SLCA is making a move in the right direction..a break thru $10 is coming........SND is in a hold state now...to let the day traders and weak hands sellout..........imho.........
40% short interest in SND
Oil now 10.4 million barrels per day. Sand usage is booming.
What happened?!
I am buying more today.
Good price to buy at 7.69. I just loaded up.
This should do well tomorrow.
"there maybe a need for ""sand batteries"". Is white sand the best type for that? Hmmmmm"
Should be $4.00 but instead it drops 9% in one day on low volume and no news. please help me.
New to this board. Just bought 11k after Q3 results today. IMHO I see this doubling within the next couple of months.
"Around 5 pm yesterday, I was wishing that I had sold out.Hard to predict what happens today, big earnings and revenue miss. I started to think about them missing, but not this bad."
SLCA expects a 45% increase in sand demand this year.
ie there is no real selling here just alot of shorting last few days - it will turn soon because short interest ultimately will cover - today might very well be the day - dont worry about the morning shorting it will turn very very soon
"Looks like SND bottomed today. Addition of new facility, strategic acquisition and huge demand should turn into significantly higher revenue in Q2 and better margins. Huge upside from current levels."
"Based on 3rd quarter, the 4th quarter financial statement should push this to $14 plus. Just a few weeks away."
Once the smoke clears & things settle down; It should return to high 6 's or low 7's then off we go. Might be after 2 nd or 3 rd qu. results J M.O
Ok guess I may buy a little more right now
"The problem with this stock is that it is being controlled by the shorts. The corona virus has exacerbated the swings so violently that the shorts are in hog heaven as they steal your money. I believe that short selling is basically legalized larceny and should be totally outlawed. In the meantime, when this corona virus finally blows away, and it will eventually, let's have a short squeeze the likes of which Wall Street has never seen before!"
Price/Book is now <1. Price to earnings near 1. P/E <7. Fwd p/e <5. With short interest at 35%(as of 14 Aug) sooner or later shorts will bale creating a spike in price. I'm thinking maybe tomorrow before weekend.
Downgraded by Jeffries to Underperform from Hold with a price target of $2.50.Management has a lot of explaining to do!
"Well, today was slightly better but a long way to go!"
We should see some upgrades soon. Still not reflecting the true value. Not too late to add more shares. GLTA
Hello. Anyone here?
once this turns it will go much higher
Market is going lower on trade wars. Moving to cash is a good idea.
Why the massive drop?
"one of the great value stocks in the moment, profitable company, lowest pe and pb ratios, just need some crowd attention - 10 easy"
I bought 1500 shares at $6.22 few months ago and it dropped to 5.20 but held on and sold it 3 months later for $8.26 nice profit and I just bought 3500 it yesterday $5.08 and will hold it for few months till it goes over 8 stocks go in cycles it is hard to buy at the very low or sell at the highest but set a target and wait just like plating tomatoes you wait 2 1/2 months befor you cultivate it 
its highly likely this will start spurting up next week
"I just bought 5000 with a limit order to buy 5000 more. the fundamentals are fantastic. the share price is fantastic. a director has bought $50,000 shares in June. what's not to like? (full disclosure: I bought a whack of this in November/December 2018 and sold in the spring)"
This is going the moon and the shorts are left with traces of sand to count
The fair value of this stock is $6. It's grossly undervalued. The correction to fair value has begun.
Have several friends working at Frac pits & they hope it starts soon. Lots of work hours for them...Just when oil goes up; things should fire up....JMO
Short sellers due to slightly lower projection for q1. Hang in there and I think we will be rewarded q2-q3 as long as oil stays about where it is at. Plus investment news upcoming it sounded like. I’m holding at least most of my shares if not all 1111
Why the huge sell off?
Us silica reports revenue in line and earnings miss...I think this drop has to do with the revenue in line. People were probably looking for a revenue beat with the increase in oil prices. I am holding here and thinking about buying some more on this dip
Sold half position before ER. Just got back all in end of Friday. I can’t believe they push this one back to low $3s. But I will take it. All the way to end of2019 whatever the price bring. Well done SND management team. I applaud you all and you’ll have my support
Their report was good enough that the pps should be at least 7 mow.
today is the first day in the right direction all supports held the impetus and trend will slowly turn upnext week - this is the process SND had to go thru to start its next trend upits never esy but it will turn up and then be able to sustain it this timethe road less taken is the road that leads it in the right direction which is up most of next week IMHO
It is good to see such good reports coming out of the Bakken. Snd is well positioned to take advantage of the huge increases. It would seem that Snd volumes will see less volatility than others depending on Permian.
"was following up on this from last one plus year. upgrade just takes 30, 35 cents up but the actual issue is with the shorts. on the low volume they are just taking cents profit and eventually bringing the price down. once shorts are out we can see the movement regardless of the analyst upgrades."
"Depending on if the court's decision is appealed (which I doubt), and/or how fast they get the $54 mil they could be debt-free very soon. Some competitors have dropped-out, so the future is very bright. I too am looking for no less than $8 pershare."
"Schlumberger c.c SLB is one of the best conf. calls to read to get real time info on the service side of oil&gas Much of what is going on in the stock prices of companies in this group including sand suppliers is explained, much if not all of the negative attitude is associated with the bottlenecks in the Permian which has been talked and written about that they would have one think that the entire on shore oil and gas was in decline SLB does expect a slow Q4 and Q1 of 19 for NA onshore because of these issues. But stated that Q3 saw a record number of frac stages throughout all basins in NA From my conversation with the cfo the Marcellus was 40% and the balken 15% most if not all of these sales on contract pricing. This leaves 35% of sales for all the other basins. SLB has built up a sand mining and delivery business from scratch and touched on the importance of the delivery side. It's a lot more then just a bucket loader in the pit and some 20 yard tandems going down the road. The quality of the in basin sand is still up in the air, if the E&P guys start to see faster decline curves in production or mechanical issues that they had not experienced before the first thing they will look at is if the cheaper sand is at fault as investors we may never know that as no ceo is going to admit they screwed up a 3-5 million well by saving a 100k on sand. I expect tax selling is already happening and will continue so we got that going against as well. maybe management will get approval for a stock buyback but with the new bank loan for the recent purchase of the silo co. they may not want any more debt. But if they believe that their take or pay contracts are solid they may just do it. Management and the original sponsor own 47% of the shares, with a tradable float of around 22 M and 7M short a 5m share buyback would put the shorts in bad spot. I did asked Lee Beckelman if that was a possibility and I got the expected response that the board will always look for the best use of capital. Full disclosure I am long 13k shares all under water high of 5.60 low of 3.03 and don't expect to make any money on this investment until next year"
"First, Smart Sand hires former President and COO of US Silica to expand into the Industrial Products market. Then, US Silica announces a potential sale of their Industrial Products segment. Whether the two are related is speculation of course, but who knows."
Its easy to buy on dips now & sell on peaks everyday lately....still holding most for longs for bonus...... 10's maybe
HCLP beat on earnings and that means SND should do well!
"Let us hope increasing oil prices will result in opening of wells that require some ""smart"" sand"
I added 2000 more at 5.67. It was 6.20 premarket. I think its just to trigger all stop losses and should go up next week.
I don't understand this AM's pricing action. This is too cheap. Last earnings was solid. Balance sheet is solid. Future demand should be steady.
When are earnings expected?
"Shares of $SND to cheap to ignore. Undervalued on any metric you can look at. In an unloved sector but the thing I like about it is you need sand when the price of oil and gas is high, but you really really need sand when the price is low :)"
"Comparing production costs between SND & HCR should involve using old data because now approx. 38% of HCR’s revenue are from providing last mile solutions mostly to other sand producers. HCR has production costs of $11.3/ton according to p9 ofhttp://ir.hicrush.com/static-files/2cb7e519-63e4-4d92-b57d-2c5ae04f3135SND has higher costs (of $15/ton) via. Seeking Alpha article entitled “Smart Sand: A Smart Cyclical Pick With Great Upside”. According to the Hi Crush 10/27/2015 earnings conference call (Note: back then they only produced Northern White Sand): “It’s our belief that the vast majority of the industry is above $20 and in fact, in many cases above $25 a ton.” SND has managed to temporarily maintain high profitability by price gouging NWS customers that are at risk of going bankrupt and by suing Schlumberger. According to their 2 5 2015 Earnings call Hi-Crush had 88% of their volumes in fixed price take or pay contracts. (They were negotiated earlier when oil prices were really high.) They received a letter from every service company (Service Cos. at that time were their sole customers. Now they try to make contracts with E&P companies directly). “all of our customers have requested price concessions, we’re not alone or unique in that regard, every single supplier to the service companies much less every sand company has received similar letter or request.” Hi Crush eventually agreed to reduce the prices on those contracts in exchange for increasing the duration of those contracts. US Silica to some extent also agreed to reduce the prices on those contracts. Someday all of the oil service companies will boycott SND because SND did not reduce their prices. Now Hi-Crush only price gouges healthy E&P companies that are in the Permian. SND does not have a Permian sand plant. SND has managed to temporarily maintain high profitability by price gouging NWS customers that are at risk of going bankrupt and by suing Schlumberger. HCR’s contracts were designed so that it will be free cash flow positive if growth cap ex of $20- $25 million is included in the definition of free cash flow."
Mark Not only family run.. but can be sold at any time.JMO
Yay new contract with EQT! Right in time for the earnings! Looking good here!
"Excellent SA article today saying this is extremely undervalued, profitable and very well run. The CEO makes around 500,000 while HCR CEO makes over 2 million a year. The author suggests this is a double, triple or more when the market wakes up to the correct valuation!"
"Soon baby, soon. Big earnings beat on the horizon"
SND is up 9.34% to 5.97
Good #'s today in a qtr that can be weak due to seasonality. Look fwd to $5.5 to $6 later this year.
"I have been holding for such a long time. Time to make some gains, 4 dollars by May."
Is this for real or this is an orgenised Halloween joke?! Markets rebouncing today but this grabage won't move!!
"For those who have not understood the energy market. Know that we may be in the beginning of a bubble. All economic conditions are favorable to a rise in oil prices. So all the companies that work in the area have benefited. Stop your analyzes of beginners and people without strategic vision. In short, I came back a long time ago and I will stay, hoping for a much higher barrel rate ... we'll see. everyone does what they want."

"Institutions started new positions and adding like crazy. Some of those that trimmed positions in Q4 and Q1 added back. I would say 13f report card most bullish for $CVIA, then $HCR, $SLCA and $SND. Sailing Stone not out with their 13f but I bet they were selling and what caused severe Covia pressure in Q2.Last couple of days before 13f’s are due. I’ll keep watching but $CVIA and $SLCA are under accumulation. Looking at 50 DMA in both. $HCR still in process of bottoming after that huge June ramp.No comment on $SND. I don’t want to be in that name regardless other than maybe a Day. Will continue to sand arb but will also hold core long’s for a longer term swings. Will lighten up on over bought conditions and add in oversold."
Note to self next time a stock goes up significantly before earnings bale out! This is the 3rd of my 5 holdings that has done this behavior this earnings quarter
Diamond hands!
Go to $7 for a first step !
That's what I'm talking about! Just a start!
"Excellent earnings - all the sand companines reported negative but SND met the expectations.3Q 2018 revenue of $63.1 million, a 16% increase sequentially3Q 2018 total tons sold of 823,000, the second highest quarterly sales volume in Company history3Q 2018 net income of $12.1 million, an increase of 21% sequentially3Q 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $22.1 million, an increase of 15% sequentiallyWe have ramped up manufacturing of our wellsite storage solutions and we are now a fully integrated frac sand services companyOur board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock."
EPS of 1.0+ and stock price is 2.33 - ridiculous; If i have money will buy the company out.
it just made a stop at the moon just wait
Orders placed $SND GOOO to the MOON Marco will follow
"Interesting how little of a rebound we have seen in SND given the jumps in HCLP, EMES and the other players in the sand box...I would think SND should see a bit more love given its very strong management team."
Longs are gonna make so much money on this.... I'm already thinking which color my Lambo is gonna be
I thought to hold 4 to 5 months to recover my loss .Now it seems to be i need to hold an another year. Will wait. dont have any other option. not going to sell any.
"The company has record profits and oil is at its highest level in 2 years, so why is this stock stuck in place? It was over $16 earlier this year when profits were half of what they are now."
@David how is your short going? Lol!
i believe the management will buy back half of the announced 2M shares by end of this year because of the low price and believe few investors might sell temporary and get back again to take advantage on the taxes. when management starts buy the price might go easily up by $1 to $1.50. i am optimistic that by the jan it might go till $6 [ this happened same last year and the prior year]
Market is not recognizing the strong fundamentals. I would hope to see an upgrade reflecting a much higher price target. Should rebound strongly with some higher volumes. Fracking will continue barring a collapse in oil and gas prices.
After hours up big!
change name to Smart Sand Software .... $3B market cap next day.......... you get the idea....
There are currently over 6 million shares shorted. Hopefully longs that have ridden this down like I have don't get over anxious and sell too cheap.
Offering 19 million in new stock sale?
"There is a unwarranted amount of short interest in this stock, the company is solid and if anything a buyout target. somebody wants us to believe white sand is doomed.... i wouldnt fall for it. A distribution would boost cofidence, even better signing more long term take-or-pays."
"I have been trying to come to a conclusion on buying $GRLT or $SND. My question is, will $SND continue to grow?"
Curious to hear guidance from management on demand for frac sand in the next meeting. Not expecting any profit this quarter but would be nice knowing that a path to profit is within reach.
Oil is holding steady huge amounts of sand are being used but company says nothing about what's going on.
Oil prices at 76$ per barrel. Solid cash position (especially with the recent settlement). Now let's see whether they will be able to turn profitable again
And tell me now this is not rigged
I'm sure if they don't BKRPT USWS.. They will come to some kind of payment terms over 5-10 years as financials do not look to allow for any more losses in USWS.. MHO.. hehe THE MAX

Someone answer real quick did they just get 54 million because this stock will skyrocket 100%
keep going down I can't complain the shares are 10% cheaper and you saw it hit 1.12 and went to 1.23 huh
good day
"The property $370 m and 40 m shares outstanding, that is means the book value is about 9$ per share?"
Glad I added at 5.10 this week.
what's going on here ??
Got my buying hat on now! We could easily hit 3 bucks on that earnings report!
Is it worth more than $4.92? I think there are short games being played with this. I have a buy order at $4.85.
this is going to Saturn $$$$$$$
"The board needs to establish a distribution. Right now the stock price is determined by value investors and the shorts, which leads to big swings. Income investors provide more stability in the price if the distribution is easily covered."
If this couldn't bounce back from around 4.80 support with some strength then there it's not much hope?
regardless of the today downgrade ( not worth to take it consideration of the credit Susie analyst) the sentiment is strong and we can see a good earnings in 2019. Middle east just announced that they are reducing the produce so the oil prices will start go up...good luck and ignore the sell rating analysts. will double my stake.
More shorts than buyers today but their last report was fine and the current pps is way too low!
Check out what's going on with HCLP today. This should be good for SND!
"I drive by their locations in WI a lot. They work 24/7. Mounds of sand all over and long lines of rail cars getting loaded. If oil stays above $50, these guys will continue to make a s$#@ load of money."
Based on the last profitable earnings report the pps is absurdly low! SND should take some profits and do a share buyback program!
"No way to tell what will happen in the near term, but easy $10+ with frac sand barely improving and way more if frac sand booms which seems unlikely now, but could happen 2 years from now"
the Cyclops of WS sees SND. ...... what will it do?
Do y’all think we will see at least $ 7.00 at earnings?????
"I don't drink ,but but but some times A guy could. I think the comp. will get tired of my calls soon.."
"A word or two in support of $SND.1. they are earning money: 2018: 0.87 and 2019: 0.97. Even if realized EPS drops, they are in the black.2. Debt to Equity ratio at reasonable 22%. They can weather the storm if WTI drops below $50.3. Takeover target. With book around $5 and small market cap, this guppie can be swallowed whole a blink.4. Management is high caliber. Examine income statements for last 5 years. All profitable.That said, its Ramen noodles tonight."
Buy now?
So it will probably go into accounts receivables then when u.s well service fills bankruptcy it’s gone so rip hopefully they don’t file bankruptcy but just look at the financials still super bullish on SND even without any money it’s still worth 7$
"A low volume""""SND"" dow day; but SND held its own. I think it will move again after a Good ""UP GRaDE """" & oil continues up."
"Last one ... promise... a bit more optimistic for us longs.Hi-Crush Idles Whitehall Plant; Bullish Thesis Unchanged https://seekingalpha.com/article/4208424?source=ansh $HCLP, $CVIA, $EMES, $SLCA, $SND"
I'm still a believer. I just add more shares. Estimated forward P/E of 4. Why would anyone sell?
Very good Seeking Alpha article out and SND is a long term buy but maybe not a short term play.
This SND stock should be over $4.00 by now and climbing. I see big gains in the future here. I have a big bet on SND and it is tariff exempt. Can't imagine why it's not climbing.
great time to buy..... oil down....market down....econ down...........company doing ok...doubled down at $2.52
"This company should do the shareholders a favor and liquidate. Take the recent $35M cash settlement received from USWS and sell all the property, plant, and equipment to the highest bidder. There is no real demand for northern white sand. They are practically giving it away. They will continue to lose money and that $35M cash settlement will be burned by next year."
stop stressing about waves splashing up and down.........the tide is coming in...trust me
"Almost sold a few days ago, my finger was on the trigger. I dumped some AM insteadLong and strong now!"
SND is down -8.50% to 6.67
Smart Sand is up 10.26% to 2.58
I always love a good discount on a company with good fundamentals and a low market valuation. What I don't understand is why people were surprised by the negative earnings this quarter. It was right in line with expectations...check back in a year and enjoy your market beating gains.
All the charts show steady increase.
We need new management !
Management what do you have to say?
Bought some more pre market ...outstanding earnings report...up we go...good investing to all....
With over 10 million barrels per day being produced now the increase usage of frac sand has to be enormous. This shouldn't trade with the oil price but the volume of oil being produced.
PPS should be 5 bucks based on last earnings report!
What’s the q4 sales consensus? Can’t find it anywhere
"Been watching this one for the last few weeks, hoping for a pullback. They've beat nicely on earnings the last few quarters, and look to be undervalued. Today I'm taking an initial position @ $3.84, and will average into a larger position, if it pulls back more."
once the company starts buybacks in open market it would be hard to get such low price. it may be go down temporary because of short profit takers but long term this is a good bet. good luck
Low price/risk ratio has returned. Below $3 is a screaming buy (and we're close to that).
Any major flags here? Looks undervalued. Surprised by the move down this week.
"IMHO today is the last chance under $5.50 before they report. Given the estimated profits for the year @$1.02, it looks like a steal. I've been buying the last two days. I jumped the gun #$%$45 but staying long. GLTA"
"Profit takers moving in. Much more down I buy more. Finance, income, structure still intact."
HCLP had good earnings report and think SND will as well.
Down over 10 percent since Wednesday and over 20 percent in a month.Unreal
There amount of debt isn’t bad and they are very profitable
Still time to buy more IMHO. Should be @ $6.50. This quarter should be even better revenue and profit. GLTA
Nice movement the last couple weeks.
"Folks. SND is treading in uneasy waters. That’s why it’s way down. There are 11 sand mines coming online in TX. Some are extremely close to their customer base - Permian, etc. So their total net cost will be much lower than SND’s. It’s the reverse reason why SND is so strong out of WI.... they are closer to Baaken than others. Their costs to get it to customer is lower.SND is entering a period of rather strong disadvantage vs competitors for the TX/OK/etc markets.SND won’t hit $10. Not unless they make some acquisitions of those in the TX market, coming online. I don’t see SND as being strong enough to support a meaningful acquisition.I would tamper your expectations on this one."
"guys do not panic and do not sell. the analyst rank who downgraded today is Ranked #4,796 out of 4,900 Analysts on TipRanks (#11,330 out of 11,499 overall experts)."
SLCA and HCLP also down 5-6% . I hope there isn't any anti- frac legislature in the works. I see no reason for this move with demand and prices high. Possibly good buying op.
Fully booked for all 2018 and almost fully booked for 2019. I am waiting to buy at under 5.00. Almost touched my buy price yesterday at 5.04. Will be $10+ stock by the end of this year.
All I can say is I'm impressed. With all the turmoil in the sand stocks SND just did an incredible job in the 3rd qt. Granted earnings estimates were 38 cents 90 days ago and estimates had come down to 28 cents but to still beat revised estimates in this environment is a job well done. Would have liked to see larger buyback but i'll take the 2M as a start. Management just showed us how good they are navigating a tough market they should be applauded for their hard work. Now about those shorts?
What happened today? Why -10%?
I think it is a great buy but what do I know. The only way I see this as a sell would be with some insider info and I don't have it.
see the guy rating who downgraded the sand stocks. https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/brad-handler
SND is up 8.80% to 6.55
"Outlook for Smart Sand is very positive, fair value is around $3.70, the float is heavy shorted and going to be very difficult for shorts to exit without causeing the market to slip well above $4.00 (Higher depending on inflow of buyers and float absorption.The more desperate the analyst clutch at straws to pull this lower the harder I buy. Gurufocus lost all credibility with their last analyst of SND."
why SND decided to reserve all its profits? without paying a dividend? The board consider the company as a growth company???
It's too low here at $5.03. No news that I'm seeing. Anyone have an idea.
"I am hoping for a miracle pipe dream ::::: but I am thinking 10,11, or 12. Its been there before &&&&&&.&& it could happen ...........JMO"
I sold took a modest profit have no confidence anymore.
"The Money Maker and Hilary Kraemer both just gave it a ""buy""."
"$7 in equity and huge growth in income over the last 5 years. The acquisition added almost 40% of the market cap in new equity and it should produce a lot of income when frac sand increases in price! Easy $7-10 company, I don’t care if it takes a couple of years to get there"
Definitely a good quarter. One note of concern though: mentions in the release that higher sales price driven by clauses in contracts regarding the price of oil. Oil has been pulling back dramatically .. don't expect those higher prices to go through to q4. Still impressive quarter considering how others performed. I don't think a 4 bagger ($8) is likely unless sentiment changes for the entire industry though.
SND installed new capacity for large train deliveries. First shipped 12/26.
"short interest has alot of incentives to start covering this is not a broken company , a good company broken by shorts ie broken stocks like this recover substantially in price once the short interests covers and yes they have to soon - be patient at it will be back in the $6 handle area and sustain it"
I've seen stocks running 600% in a day with no news... this is one of those... tomorrow gap up!!
Any ones please tell what's wrong with SND? Thanks
"Zacks........""Smart Sand (SND) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.09 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.11. This compares to earnings of $0.42 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items."""
"Upside potential with this stock is huge, as a small cap it has the balance sheet to survive the downturn in Oil, other sand frac have gone in to bk due to poor balance sheets, SND focused on lowering debt and will survive and pick up new customers as a result! Long all the way"
Zacks upgrades today to a strong buy!
"Prepare for a short squeeze. Probability of happening is around 90%. Shorts - cover now, rather than get a margin call."
"its a trap. i am holding a large volume and will continue next 5 or 6 months to recover my money. whoever believes this is a good buy , rethink twice and my suggestion is don't enter but its totally up to you. regardless of strong financials this might test the bottom."
