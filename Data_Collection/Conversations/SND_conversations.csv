The fair value of this stock is $6. It's grossly undervalued. The correction to fair value has begun.

Management should be explaining what is going on!
"Let us hope increasing oil prices will result in opening of wells that require some ""smart"" sand"
"U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. to Explore Strategic Alternatives for Industrial & Specialty Products (ISP) Segment"
I don't understand this AM's pricing action. This is too cheap. Last earnings was solid. Balance sheet is solid. Future demand should be steady.
"Been watching this one for the last few weeks, hoping for a pullback. They've beat nicely on earnings the last few quarters, and look to be undervalued. Today I'm taking an initial position @ $3.84, and will average into a larger position, if it pulls back more."
"Prepare for a short squeeze. Probability of happening is around 90%. Shorts - cover now, rather than get a margin call."
Chart says buy...so I bought today. Expecting a pop.
"$7 in equity and huge growth in income over the last 5 years. The acquisition added almost 40% of the market cap in new equity and it should produce a lot of income when frac sand increases in price! Easy $7-10 company, I donâ€™t care if it takes a couple of years to get there"
Downgraded by Jeffries to Underperform from Hold with a price target of $2.50.Management has a lot of explaining to do!
"I have been holding for such a long time. Time to make some gains, 4 dollars by May."
"Smart sand is one of my customers, last time I talked to them they said business is good we are humming a long, I supply parts for several sand companies and know several of them have gone out of business, so less competition for SND. I decided to pick up the 3k shares the other day and glad I did."
"Upside potential with this stock is huge, as a small cap it has the balance sheet to survive the downturn in Oil, other sand frac have gone in to bk due to poor balance sheets, SND focused on lowering debt and will survive and pick up new customers as a result! Long all the way"
"there maybe a need for ""sand batteries"". Is white sand the best type for that? Hmmmmm"
That's what I'm talking about! Just a start!
what's going on here ??
the Cyclops of WS sees SND. ...... what will it do?
"First, Smart Sand hires former President and COO of US Silica to expand into the Industrial Products market. Then, US Silica announces a potential sale of their Industrial Products segment. Whether the two are related is speculation of course, but who knows."
"This company should do the shareholders a favor and liquidate. Take the recent $35M cash settlement received from USWS and sell all the property, plant, and equipment to the highest bidder. There is no real demand for northern white sand. They are practically giving it away. They will continue to lose money and that $35M cash settlement will be burned by next year."
