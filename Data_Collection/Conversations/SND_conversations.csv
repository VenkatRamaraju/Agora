"I have been holding for such a long time. Time to make some gains, 4 dollars by May."
"First, Smart Sand hires former President and COO of US Silica to expand into the Industrial Products market. Then, US Silica announces a potential sale of their Industrial Products segment. Whether the two are related is speculation of course, but who knows."
"Smart sand is one of my customers, last time I talked to them they said business is good we are humming a long, I supply parts for several sand companies and know several of them have gone out of business, so less competition for SND. I decided to pick up the 3k shares the other day and glad I did."
Someone answer real quick did they just get 54 million because this stock will skyrocket 100%

"one of the great value stocks in the moment, profitable company, lowest pe and pb ratios, just need some crowd attention - 10 easy"
today is the first day in the right direction all supports held the impetus and trend will slowly turn upnext week - this is the process SND had to go thru to start its next trend upits never esy but it will turn up and then be able to sustain it this timethe road less taken is the road that leads it in the right direction which is up most of next week IMHO
"Excellent earnings - all the sand companines reported negative but SND met the expectations.3Q 2018 revenue of $63.1 million, a 16% increase sequentially3Q 2018 total tons sold of 823,000, the second highest quarterly sales volume in Company history3Q 2018 net income of $12.1 million, an increase of 21% sequentially3Q 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $22.1 million, an increase of 15% sequentiallyWe have ramped up manufacturing of our wellsite storage solutions and we are now a fully integrated frac sand services companyOur board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock."
That's what I'm talking about! Just a start!
It’s already super undervalued if they got 54 million my fair value changes drastically my fair value before this was 6-8$
My cost basis is $5.12. Still a long way to go.
Management should be explaining what is going on!
"there maybe a need for ""sand batteries"". Is white sand the best type for that? Hmmmmm"
Curious to hear guidance from management on demand for frac sand in the next meeting. Not expecting any profit this quarter but would be nice knowing that a path to profit is within reach.
"short interest of 7M shares have a big problem. I expected a good qrt. but I thought analyst estimates were to high, they handily beat them. As long as nothing negative is said on the conf. call technically we will have an island reversal to the upside with first major resistance at 7.35 if analyst raise estimates for the balance of this year and next we could see the 10.60 range by the end of the year that would only be a 8pe on next years earnings. either way the shorts are trapped if the street see's it's that way they may move this fast and seize the moment. happy hunting"
Why the massive drop?
"This company should do the shareholders a favor and liquidate. Take the recent $35M cash settlement received from USWS and sell all the property, plant, and equipment to the highest bidder. There is no real demand for northern white sand. They are practically giving it away. They will continue to lose money and that $35M cash settlement will be burned by next year."
snd announced after hours expansion into the bahkens
"I have been trying to come to a conclusion on buying $GRLT or $SND. My question is, will $SND continue to grow?"
"Last one ... promise... a bit more optimistic for us longs.Hi-Crush Idles Whitehall Plant; Bullish Thesis Unchanged https://seekingalpha.com/article/4208424?source=ansh $HCLP, $CVIA, $EMES, $SLCA, $SND"
great time to buy..... oil down....market down....econ down...........company doing ok...doubled down at $2.52
Market is going lower on trade wars. Moving to cash is a good idea.
"Let us hope increasing oil prices will result in opening of wells that require some ""smart"" sand"
the Cyclops of WS sees SND. ...... what will it do?
What happened?!
"Anybody knows why they were very profitable, but the recent 2 quarters had negative gross margin?"
It is good to see such good reports coming out of the Bakken. Snd is well positioned to take advantage of the huge increases. It would seem that Snd volumes will see less volatility than others depending on Permian.
Note to self next time a stock goes up significantly before earnings bale out! This is the 3rd of my 5 holdings that has done this behavior this earnings quarter
SLCA and HCLP also down 5-6% . I hope there isn't any anti- frac legislature in the works. I see no reason for this move with demand and prices high. Possibly good buying op.
"A word or two in support of $SND.1. they are earning money: 2018: 0.87 and 2019: 0.97. Even if realized EPS drops, they are in the black.2. Debt to Equity ratio at reasonable 22%. They can weather the storm if WTI drops below $50.3. Takeover target. With book around $5 and small market cap, this guppie can be swallowed whole a blink.4. Management is high caliber. Examine income statements for last 5 years. All profitable.That said, its Ramen noodles tonight."
Glad I added at 5.10 this week.
"Outlook for Smart Sand is very positive, fair value is around $3.70, the float is heavy shorted and going to be very difficult for shorts to exit without causeing the market to slip well above $4.00 (Higher depending on inflow of buyers and float absorption.The more desperate the analyst clutch at straws to pull this lower the harder I buy. Gurufocus lost all credibility with their last analyst of SND."
I always love a good discount on a company with good fundamentals and a low market valuation. What I don't understand is why people were surprised by the negative earnings this quarter. It was right in line with expectations...check back in a year and enjoy your market beating gains.

"Been watching this one for the last few weeks, hoping for a pullback. They've beat nicely on earnings the last few quarters, and look to be undervalued. Today I'm taking an initial position @ $3.84, and will average into a larger position, if it pulls back more."
what's going on here ??
"No way to tell what will happen in the near term, but easy $10+ with frac sand barely improving and way more if frac sand booms which seems unlikely now, but could happen 2 years from now"
remember there is over 30%short of outstanding shares of SND - once the short covering starts - it will escalate it towards $6 again
Saudi oil will take months to come back online and not weeks. Oil isn't done going higher
New to this board. Just bought 11k after Q3 results today. IMHO I see this doubling within the next couple of months.
This stock should be $10.
"Institutions started new positions and adding like crazy. Some of those that trimmed positions in Q4 and Q1 added back. I would say 13f report card most bullish for $CVIA, then $HCR, $SLCA and $SND. Sailing Stone not out with their 13f but I bet they were selling and what caused severe Covia pressure in Q2.Last couple of days before 13f’s are due. I’ll keep watching but $CVIA and $SLCA are under accumulation. Looking at 50 DMA in both. $HCR still in process of bottoming after that huge June ramp.No comment on $SND. I don’t want to be in that name regardless other than maybe a Day. Will continue to sand arb but will also hold core long’s for a longer term swings. Will lighten up on over bought conditions and add in oversold."
This SND stock should be over $4.00 by now and climbing. I see big gains in the future here. I have a big bet on SND and it is tariff exempt. Can't imagine why it's not climbing.
"Interesting how little of a rebound we have seen in SND given the jumps in HCLP, EMES and the other players in the sand box...I would think SND should see a bit more love given its very strong management team."
Is it worth more than $4.92? I think there are short games being played with this. I have a buy order at $4.85.
"Excellent SA article today saying this is extremely undervalued, profitable and very well run. The CEO makes around 500,000 while HCR CEO makes over 2 million a year. The author suggests this is a double, triple or more when the market wakes up to the correct valuation!"
"Wow a real management team. Although its not all blue skies and green pastures ahead, the management team was lucid and on top of things. Very different than the EMES calls I have listened too, although thats getting a nice bump today too. EMES couldn't even answer an analyst question on what their estimated contribution margin would be in the new San Antonio plant which I found disturbing. The answer I believe was something to the effect we can't get into specifics on that."
SND installed new capacity for large train deliveries. First shipped 12/26.
in at $5.6
"guys do not panic and do not sell. the analyst rank who downgraded today is Ranked #4,796 out of 4,900 Analysts on TipRanks (#11,330 out of 11,499 overall experts)."
SND is down -8.50% to 6.67
Downgraded by Jeffries to Underperform from Hold with a price target of $2.50.Management has a lot of explaining to do!
A very small company; better than expected rev/ erngs; could be lucky break. A smidgen of extra volume to say HCLP is a big deal to SND. But it could mean superior management at SND; certainly bears watching.
I don't understand this AM's pricing action. This is too cheap. Last earnings was solid. Balance sheet is solid. Future demand should be steady.
"Upside potential with this stock is huge, as a small cap it has the balance sheet to survive the downturn in Oil, other sand frac have gone in to bk due to poor balance sheets, SND focused on lowering debt and will survive and pick up new customers as a result! Long all the way"
Chart says buy...so I bought today. Expecting a pop.
"its a trap. i am holding a large volume and will continue next 5 or 6 months to recover my money. whoever believes this is a good buy , rethink twice and my suggestion is don't enter but its totally up to you. regardless of strong financials this might test the bottom."
The fair value of this stock is $6. It's grossly undervalued. The correction to fair value has begun.
"$7 in equity and huge growth in income over the last 5 years. The acquisition added almost 40% of the market cap in new equity and it should produce a lot of income when frac sand increases in price! Easy $7-10 company, I don’t care if it takes a couple of years to get there"
"Prepare for a short squeeze. Probability of happening is around 90%. Shorts - cover now, rather than get a margin call."
