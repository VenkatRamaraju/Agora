"Market rallied, this went down! Pump and dump pattern everyday."
Wow
Steel Dynamics website states earnings is Oct. 19 at 10am.
"I think if more stocks paid a good dividend, people would feel more confident in holding, and thus trading less."
I opened at PUT on $STLD this afternoon. The technical indicators are pointing down. Indicators on $X were also pointing down but $STLD had a better set up. Materials sector $XLB was also pointing down.
I believe Morgan Stanley downgrade today to from 77 to 61 is meant to discourage buyers and make retail traders sell. STLD announced prior that they will have an amazing quarter. There is nothing in the market to show that steel price will go down. Inflation is tailwind. Let's see after hours but my guess is that STLD will be 66 after earnings and then will sail up to 70-80. Just look at AA how strong is after earnings. STLD should be similar.
infrastructure spending could start early 2022 that will push revenue & EPS even higher for STLD $NUE.
"when i say ita going down , nobody believed me"
Why isn't this stock trading at 130?
If stld avereaged 1550 what do you think Clf will average
STLD is a well managed company and it's in a great place right now. Was talking about analysts dishonesty yesterday. Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock prior to earnings announcement although STLD announced prior they will have a stellar quarter and the story is likely to continue. This stock will likely go to 90-100 in one year given the landscape for metals and a reopening economy.
"If 8,5 USD made in the first 2 Qs are not good enough for a green day. Well I'll just wait a few more days. It cant all be underwear and elelctric vehicles. Some guys have to make the steel, and right now those guys make a ton of money. At christmas people will buy steel stocks for their children as gifts."
See $STLD $X and $nue folks.. steel delivered block buster earnings
I can't believe the whole sector isn't going to blowout earnings. jmo.
"$NUE, $CLF, $STLD Better bet for steel $X ? due to its 19.5% short interest. I moved my nue money into X too for infra squeeze play and lowest PE among the 4."
"On price jumps after earnings calls, quant programs play a short term strategy from what they often have observed -- sell the pop for a decent short-term profit, then short for a short-term ""reversion."" Quant programs will also trade on paired similar bets (ref. silver and gold, CLF and STLD) ... whatever they have found in the past trades that indicate a correlation. If one of the pairs is ""out of wack"" low compared to historical patterns, they buy the low and wait for catch-up. Deep historical data guides the programs, looking for anomalies and patterns. Trades occur passively on those findings. With 80% of three to four billion shares passively trading every day, the main business of The Street is making money. It does not factor the health of the firms that they are trading. IMO, was a time when the Street's noble main purpose was providing capital for an array of industries, benefiting society by supporting the economic health of the country. Every so often, the Street comes up with complex trades that very few understand but offers them the chance to profit (i.e., credit default swaps). The latest is crypto. Great, crypto ETFs, just at a time when the globe is levered up on central bank supports and historically low interest rates, elevating risk-taking for retail. Know what you own and the why of its fundamentals, imo."
"It has been trading like lately, dumping during the last hour. That’s stealing."
bull or bear after earnings?
You can bet GS took a huge short position before they revised PT. Just ask the front-runner Jim Cramer.
Numbers to watch..EPS: $4.95REVS: $4.85BGuidance the key...

how many MS clients bought steel stocks today....or was it all in dark pools
"Up or down after earnings. Any predictions? I think the earnings will be great, but not sure if the stick will go up because of all the negative downgrades lately"
So stld is pausing at the 50 day. People waiting for someone to jump and give the green light for the rocket ship to take off.
$X do you want to bet on Infrastructure bill steel only or +MEME level 19.5% short squeeze + impending earnings blow out ( $x earnings last thursday last to report so steel earnings not baked in) with better valuation ( best among all 4) $NUE $STLD $CLF ..choose wisely
"Rick $ASTL -ey is going to take us to the moon! Infrastructure, catch-up automotive demand, increased shipping and supply chain risks - it's all good for the steel rocket ship us shareholders are on.$CLF $X $STLD $STLC.TO"
"STLD crushed the number and it's down today. That tells you all you need to know. Institutional investors don't hold cyclical stocks as investments, but rather as trades. They are NOT growth stocks. At this stage in this steel cyclical many are starting to believe we are at the top and beats are opportunities to lighten up on steel. Whether STLD, NUE, CLF, etc are all acting the same. Only the worst management at X is doing worse."
Listen to the Q&a on the conf call and it is reassuring that demand and pricing should remain strong for a lot longer than analysts are modeling.
"Earnings up 1000% YOY, yet stock is on snooze. Elevated steel prices are not going away anymore than gold is going back to $300 an ounce."
"Sinton could be a huge boost once it's up and running, hopefully by Jan. 1. The new Sinton plant is just plain awesome."
"STLD and $NUE with PE 6 and double digit growth, look undervalued. With the coming infrastructure spending, it is no brainer for long holding."
STLD sees higher earnings in 4Q and in 2022.
steel dynamics just crushed the earnings $STLD
MS analyst is valuing STLD at 5.6x 2023 EBITDA. What’s the margin of error on ebitda for a steel company 2 years out? 20% 80% 100%.
It pays to listen to conf call. I’m looking forward to hearing from NUE CLF this week as well
Steel dudes done sold off after being higher. Do we get infrastructure bill or not?
This 10/18 will be like AA?
"As confidence builds that a dramatic fundamental reversal and cycle bust is not imminent, each increased multiple point for stld adds $15, for nue $20, for x $15 for Clf $5"
CLF CEO talking about 1-2 good years for steel.Anyone has any idea why STLD CEO made a comment yesterday that prices will ease next year?Probably he wants to buyback at lower stock prices…..
"Glad I stayed away for now , will be watching to buy"
