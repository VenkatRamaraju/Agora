$89!!!! Buyers are testing $90 quickly! Cheers!
CFRA upgraded RBLX from Buy to Strong Buy last night.
"Mark my word, $95 in the next week. Roblox is partnering with VANS. should be a good event."
(http://Pick-stocks.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
I see $100 soon.
Moving up again. Should see 83 or 84 based on the ask/sell orders.
Green!!! I'm not surprised.
Who doesn't think the CCP is buying shares of RBLX?
"Thank you, thank you!, I have been waiting for a dip to jump on board. This is the company of the future and it has all of the ingredients to be profitable. Good things happen to those who wait !"
Buy as much as you can. Jeffries initiating coverage just supports that there is significant value. The $92 price target with a hold also supports this. This down day just provides more buying opportunities before it goes over $100
"Roblox Acquires Guilded, a Platform to Connect Gaming Communities"
"well, it looks like RBLX has found support at 75. I'm actually surprised. It's going to go back up to the 80's soon so, better hurry while there's still time!! ;0"
"Look on the bright side, only 3% down after earnings. That's like a non-event."
100 Monday
"I bought a $100 Roblex Gift Card from Amazon for a friend's 12 year old daughter. Last year I bought a $50 Card. That's what see wanted. P.S. She is a straight A student, so playing Roblex doesn't seem to hurt her grades."
all I got to say is metaverse... even Nvidia is talking about the metaverse on the conference call. we have to stop looking at daily average users and monthly average users and start looking and what this company actually does and what they're creating. I'm holding for a long time and buying on any dips
The kids who developed games now they were those kids played games when they were younger.
News: China Slashes Kids’ Gaming Time to Just Three Hours a Week
"“Roblox has become a leading platform with a mission to build a human co-experience that enables billions of users to play, learn, and build friendships in the metaverse. Recent advances in cloud computing, computing devices, and machine learning, enable the materialization of the metaverse. Take what we have in virtual reality today and fast-forward a few decades. Humans will be able to experience unimaginable things and in a couple of millennia virtual economies are likely to become bigger than the physical trade on planet Earth.”"
"My other stocks beat earnings and dropped like a rock. In 2021, This could be good"
"This one stays in my portfolio for years. Up or down, as I have the cash, I will add to my position."
"This is bad? “Revenue for the quarter increased 127% year over year to $454 million, and operating cash flow was up 64% to $191 million. Daily active users continue to grow, up 29% to over 43 million.”"
"I was expecting this stock to deep close to 70 in order to average down, now going up."
Revenue rose by $254mil compared to the same quarter last year. Bookings rose $161mil compared to same quarter last year. No matter what anyone says that is growth. Hours engaged increased by 16% from June2021 which in June/July bears said less people would be playing in the platform due to less covid restrictions. WRONG! 16% growth in a month is insane. Expanding the platform and integrating new services and products is expensive but no company gets there in a few months. Smart people hold tight!
Just look at the 1 month chart... Don't get worried about a small correction today.
"so we didn't break 100 and a 52 week high of 104, but look on the bright side..what better time to buy?? we are right around the corner and any day now ALL TIME HIGH. now is pretty much your final opportunity to make a quick 20% in the short term. that being said I can easily see RBLX at 200-300 in the long term. happy trading and nice weekend all. ;0"
BAM BAM BAM! Look for Unity and Roblox to have a nice steady incline to next ERs. Enjoy the money :)
"Wow, china just clamped down... so much for Roblox user expansion."
Morgan Stanley raised the price target from $87 to $88 is this some kind of joke; they couldn't be a little more generous.
"RBLX will see $100 again very soon, the question is what does it do after, will it make new highs or drops back to $75 or so. In other words RBLX could be a stock we can trade in a specific channel, Buy $75.....Sell $100. Each time we trade it keep some shares to build a core position.Anyone agree its a good strategy to trade and build a position or just buy and hold on dips."
Still the fav stock on my list. High growth pays in a long run. Keep it going GL longs
"Amazing how much this matches the Facebook growth story, long before Facebook became the defacto standard for businesses to market to and communicate with their customers. In the early years, it’s all about brand name recognition and building a massive base by winning the popularity contest before all the lucrative and diverse monetization opportunities. RBLX is the future."

Well Cathy Wood was spot on with this stock and now I can't wait for Cramer to pump it some more. He last pumped this company at $92 per share.
"China has issued new draconian rules for young video gamers; 3 hours per week cap. Those under 18 limited to playing for one hour a day - 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. - on only Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays."
The metaverse is the future of the tech market. More selloff opportunity to buy RBLX at discount
RBLX the comeback kid
"I am a school teacher. I pay attention to what the kids are paying attention to...it is how I picked up on Snapchat 2 years ago, and CROX last year, and both those socks knocked it out of the park.I first started noticing kids, watching other kids play video games...this metaverse is happening...and RBLX is the best pure play on this alternative reality.The whole thing is pretty bizarre, I admit. It must be kind of like how my grandfather likely felt about everyone sitting around a t.v. in the 1950's. Yes...it is tough to get my mind around...and this is why I put some serious $ in RBLX last month...because the future is now."
all my stocks down after earnings. all!!!
