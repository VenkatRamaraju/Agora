Long term play. Don’t get caught up. If you believe you still do. Average down or wait. It’s going to take a few years.
RBLX LMFA 
Only down because NFLX up with their entry into gaming. But not competitors as RBLX is a long-established platform with a significant development community
"Reckon a small miss relative to analyst expectations but don't think it detracts from the overall positive storyline.A) DAU was on target but ABPDAU was lower, this resulted in a bookings miss of $665 (Q2 actuals) vs $683 (wall Street concensus) . This is to be expected as user base outside North America is growing strongly and generally each user outside NA has less spending power but this will be made up as there are more users outside NA. B) expenses are up and this is to be expected. Analyst concensus was probably too low in this regard given the growth expectations. Nonetheless there is no funding gap as Operating Cash Flows are immenseAll in all, some analyst might reduce their target price by 2 to 5 dollars. However none of Q2's 'underperformance' (if you want to call it that) in bookings (and bookings is the only number besides DAU that matters) can't be recouped in the the second half. (Example Roblox's China operations started in July 13th only a month ago. While there are some China headwinds short term, China is expected to contribute $500m to $600m when they get to 10m DAU) So overall FY21 bookings analyst are expecting should still stand.That's why fund managers are investing in Roblox on price dips. If the fundamentals were shattered this would not be the case."
RBLX and PFE saved my day. Adios amigos GL
Going to close up two bucks and change on Monday as traders come back and shorts start to cover.
Today is Roblox Day
BAM BAM BAM! Look for Unity and Roblox to have a nice steady incline to next ERs. Enjoy the money :)
Hmmm...we are Red on a Green day...what gives here?
I believe in RBLX
about to hit 90s $_$
could this be about 80 options
"Covid 19 is going up, people stay home more and they play game more"
"Green After Hours, See your in the 80s tomorrow."
"Thank you, thank you!, I have been waiting for a dip to jump on board. This is the company of the future and it has all of the ingredients to be profitable. Good things happen to those who wait !"
Wow…under 5 minutes to go sub $80
not worried but wondering why we are not up with Nasdaq today?
this about to get reversed
RBLX is the quintessential representation of what it means to be invested in tech!!
Roblox will be at $130 end of month. Earnings will crush expectations. Load up while it’s dipping.
Very weak day….no volume at all
Market up big today and RBLX down AGAIN. what gives? Is it time to tap out?
It’ll close green. You heard it here first. Mark my words.
75 buy 95 sell
"I was expecting this stock to deep close to 70 in order to average down, now going up."
Alright...got my $80 calls on this dip...now we can run!
#$%$
"as a wiseman one said, Booooyah B's"
"got 400 shares, ready for liftoff!!!"
"What is the lowest this is going? For a game that has the backing of every kid in America, how does this not rebound?"
"Have to admit, I've been sitting on the sidelines. Back to school effect concerned me. However, initiated a call spread to play earnings."
"So Monday, after the Market closes, is when they report their Quarterlies. I'm interested."
"Roblox Acquires Guilded, a Platform to Connect Gaming Communities"
it's time we visit the 90s again. :0
all my stocks down after earnings. all!!!
Added another 2k shrs at avg 72.57 lol what a messed up trade
CFRA upgraded RBLX from Buy to Strong Buy last night.
"I am a school teacher. I pay attention to what the kids are paying attention to...it is how I picked up on Snapchat 2 years ago, and CROX last year, and both those socks knocked it out of the park.I first started noticing kids, watching other kids play video games...this metaverse is happening...and RBLX is the best pure play on this alternative reality.The whole thing is pretty bizarre, I admit. It must be kind of like how my grandfather likely felt about everyone sitting around a t.v. in the 1950's. Yes...it is tough to get my mind around...and this is why I put some serious $ in RBLX last month...because the future is now."
42 x Sales? What you all doing here????
Fighting back
"Very stong partnerships, going bak to $100."
"Roblox, the collaborative gaming platform, signed an agreement with Sony Music to bring more artists to its virtual environment. It joins the agreement it had a week ago with the fourth most powerful company in the world of music,"
"so we didn't break 100 and a 52 week high of 104, but look on the bright side..what better time to buy?? we are right around the corner and any day now ALL TIME HIGH. now is pretty much your final opportunity to make a quick 20% in the short term. that being said I can easily see RBLX at 200-300 in the long term. happy trading and nice weekend all. ;0"
Opened a small position in RBLX today as I noticed my kid is really addicted to this game. LOL!
Still the fav stock on my list. High growth pays in a long run. Keep it going GL longs
"When it gets to $20, then it might be worth buying"
"I want to like this company, but given the intended audience of children (12+) with most players under the age of 16, why are FPS games with realistic firearms allowed at all on ROBLOX platform?Am I the only one who sees anything wrong with that picture?"
CLOSING REDDDDDDDDD
"Food for thought. Cathie Wood spent $11 mil in this stock at $82.59/share. Recently, before this ER coming Monday. Check out what one of her favorite stocks (U) unity just did after the recent ER. "
"the main goal is this stock will move as it gains more players, viewers and higher positive income!"
Which company making a profit these days . I got crushed on the last 6 earnings including Sofi and Sklz.
"My kid Loves Roblox although a big problem that i see is he is 7 years old , we buy him a monthly subscription where he gets 880 robux for $10 , the company should really put a pin code that you can enable before making purchases that you can turn on as my kid has made several mistakes , like just now bought something in a game for 500 robux that just popped up in game and he clicked by accident . roblox has no safety features in place to protect young kids. they offer no refunds no exceptions , and no way to block in game purchases . this is not the 1st time this has happened for a large amount of robux . i reached out the the company in the past to see if there was a way to block charges unless i am supervising purchases , via like a pin code although they have nothing. i think they encourage this to happen as i huge chunk of the user base are young kids . totally unacceptable and irresponsible from the company"
Wow Wall Street really hates Cathie Wood. Personally I think numbers r pretty good. Oh well GL longs
Green!!! I'm not surprised.
Saw some big blocks buying
I think tomorrow we will have new analyst(s) coverages initiated. This is running like it.V-shape recovery!
"I like this company, but time is not on their side. Good entry be on the way."
Sure would be nice to see an $87 close today.
"CEO didn’t entice me to buy today but this will hit 85 by fri and bought another company, ok money spent to improve, generations are stuck on games the future drones for one thing"
I know we are red BUT what a recovery!!!!! Im glad there is demand for this stock! Im perplexed at people who sell at rock bottom lows. It has dropped to 73 and people sell there.... I'll never understand why people sell low (unless it's on margin or 100% of your portfolio)
Is today their first ER report as public company?....
Lower please. Buying the dip
Good time to buy more when the people sell off
bought more today. buying every drop. looking to sell in January 1 2031
"June metrics being reported tomorrow, and rumor is the numbers are good"
NICE reversal!! 81.50 and still counting. it's back up to where it was just before earnings. I see 100+ in the very near future!! ;0
RSI indicating oversold
"Has been sold off way too much over last 5 days. Irregardless of markets jitters, RBLX will grow."
The time to buy is now. Negatives have been priced in whereas the positives have been deeply discounted. Easy triple in next 3-5 years.
movement on no newsdeseerves to close at $80.00
was just 89 mon....really?
Just look at the 1 month chart... Don't get worried about a small correction today.
how much Rev or AMUs come from China?
Amazon to purchase Roblox?
"watch, someones going to offload a ton of shares and this will close at $82.00."
Pre-market stable and green.
Uh oh!
LETSSS GOOOOOO
no matrics for june until august it cant be good news
Mega Manipulation on this stock
Rally
The Future it’s MetaverseAnd RBLX will be in the front .Big potential for long !!
"This one stays in my portfolio for years. Up or down, as I have the cash, I will add to my position."
$89!!!! Buyers are testing $90 quickly! Cheers!
"The market had an overreaction from job numbers. This means it should go back up to some extent. However, it’s in a delicate position. If any bad news or talk about interest rates come up, the stock could come crashing down. Manage your portfolios appropriately:)"
I love to see the 90ies on this one soon
Many Korean investors are interested in Metaverse stocks and funds. More $90 until this week!!
Down 5% before earnings... What are the expectations?
Maybe Cathy Wood bought more at the dip this morning.
Buying under $70
Guess im a bag holder in the short term. Rblx will recover
"Had dinner with a friend from Malaysia. Roblux came up as it was mentioned it was all the rage with her sister's kids back there. Now Malaysia is a mid tier developing country, and if Roblux is already out there, reckon the plan to grow outside North America is well underway."
"Just wait until KSI begins his live performances this Fiday...it is the start of RBLX expanding from a gaming platform. They already have developed the social media engagement...now with live music and entertainment performances, the Metaverse really is blowing up!"
Missed badly..time to sell and avoid the huge loss
My opportunity to buy more
Sell sell sell
over $80 today
How is this stock down on a GREEN day in the market?
It's holding up pretty good.
Roblox marches to the beat of it's own drummer...
Going down before the earnings mean good?
for the third time - will hold this stock until they put me in a casket
That decelerating bookings & revenue growth is a killer for perfect valuation stock like this trading at 42x sales. Need to see those growth numbers accelerating again to justify this valuation.
Trading before earnings possess some risk. I’ll wait until tomorrow for direction. I believe it’s more important to get direction right vs. getting price right.
All my daughter does is message her friends on Roblox in her free time and buy Robux to outfit her avatar. This is the new Facebook for kids. If you disagree then you are probably not a parent fighting your kid to get your cell phone back constantly.
$RBLX $WIMI These are the only time I have ever voted for something in my life. They are the only vote that ever mattered to me.
Ark Fund just bought 13m of a $1 Stock! Interesting... Cathie Woods sees something?CMFS
"So my daughter went to the birthday party ‘of the season’, and all the girls wanted to do to hoop it up was sit in a room and play Roblox together, each on their own device, spending a Robux allotment. Guess no more pin the tail, piñatas, or even plaster fun time. Virtual experiences win out"
one more PUMP from Cramer and the 60's are certain.
Looks like a miss.
"Hold on long term, this will break $200 next year. I made a lot of money holding long on Facebook, CrowdStrike, and Tesla. I will make a lot holding this one too."
"Roblox, Roblox Corporation; Patent Issued for Predictive data preloading (USPTO 11033824)Journal of Robotics & Machine Learning"
major overreaction
"I don't think anyone saw this pull-back coming, 50's are not out of the question at this point, at least in the short term."
Great run. But I don't think they'll let it take out the $90 options this Fri.
This should reclaim 86.50s b4 earnings I bot 3k shrs at 81.65 avg yesterday
"Looks like the WS gurus are anticipating less than stellar earnings. Not gonna show a profit, that much we know already. Key will be guidance. Gotta hope the CEO can spin a positive outlook. If so, we could be back to $90 rather quickly. GLTA."
Put buy order at $58
I promised myself $80.00 by close! lfg!!!!
Patience
Today is a great opportunity at this price...Drops below 85. Buy more.
Going to 50 where it belongs.
Options will control the drop
Do you invest based off what analysts expected or based off the company growing year over year.. great earnings.. how reason there’s a sell off if because the same Wall Street analysts over pumped the IPO and put the company in this spot
"only way to have made profit on this was to sell yesterday during after market, only on its way up now!!!"
Market up 600 plus and RBLX is down again and still. Earnings better be good but I don't know if that will help. Sentiment and shorts have really turned on this company.
Revenue rose by $254mil compared to the same quarter last year. Bookings rose $161mil compared to same quarter last year. No matter what anyone says that is growth. Hours engaged increased by 16% from June2021 which in June/July bears said less people would be playing in the platform due to less covid restrictions. WRONG! 16% growth in a month is insane. Expanding the platform and integrating new services and products is expensive but no company gets there in a few months. Smart people hold tight!
Hold tight everyone. I see a number of shorts on here lying about what is going on with the stock. Short comment #1 insiders sold 12million shares recently-correct but this is all part of the direct listing distribution to resale private shares. The goal was to make the company public without additional offerrings. Next comment-This stock belongs at $25 per share. Incorrect because most trading is done on future potential. All people who know technology know this is like when facebook first went public. There is a reason analysts value the stock up to $103 per share with a projection of $486 per share by 2026 even though they expect the next couple quarters or more may be red. Also remember that Roblox is growing exponentially and other companies wish for this kind of user access. Good luck to all and ignore the shorts. Buy up as much as possible and then in 4 yrs you can retire and continue laughing at the shorts.
Going to end green tomorrow.
"My other stocks beat earnings and dropped like a rock. In 2021, This could be good"
heading back up to break 52 week high of 104 and it won't be long. any day now.
Company is doomed
"turns out, we were all wrong lol! lousy 1% up is better than nothing i guess. volume was very low on Friday, which is typical..the test will be on Monday. has it found support at 83 or back down to 70's like it's done on numerous occasions (sell orders at 85 while buys at 75).."
Sometimes I think we are like the famers: plan and harvest.Today I know a busy time for planning and 5 more months to harvest.
Going back to the 60’s
Really not sure why the blox is down. Ohh well
Patience and time
"RBLX will see $100 again very soon, the question is what does it do after, will it make new highs or drops back to $75 or so. In other words RBLX could be a stock we can trade in a specific channel, Buy $75.....Sell $100. Each time we trade it keep some shares to build a core position.Anyone agree its a good strategy to trade and build a position or just buy and hold on dips."
"Kiwoom Securities, a large Korean investment company, has released a Roblox report for investors."
"Brands are getting more interested in reaching the Roblox platform's 43 million users, which could open the floodgates for more growth. Netflix’s Stranger Things is ushering in more brand investment seeking similar virtual hangouts. RBLX is the future!"
"I am gonna buy this again tomorrow. Too good of a stock to be in the 70s.I mean think about it, just 2 wks ago this hit 72.50 and bounced back to 85Now at 76 after ""bad"" earnings and can not drop no more. Short covering and bottom fishing should turn it green tomorrow AM."
"dang, should have bought at 73.9, but ended up getting it at 74.19 oh well :)"
Buy as much as you can. Jeffries initiating coverage just supports that there is significant value. The $92 price target with a hold also supports this. This down day just provides more buying opportunities before it goes over $100
woot!!!
Going up to $90. Lock in before it does!
Well Cathy Wood was spot on with this stock and now I can't wait for Cramer to pump it some more. He last pumped this company at $92 per share.
would love to see this under $75 to start a pmcc position
I’m buying more RBLX on Monday fo sho
"EA earnings were good , hopefully we will go up tomorrow"
Don’t overreact. ALL growth names are taking a dump today because the 10 yr bond interest rate is up +0.0350. Big whoop. Still bullish
Can we go past $80 this week
Moving up again. Should see 83 or 84 based on the ask/sell orders.
"good stock but insanely overvalued losses are going to.mount, will definitely fall after earnings"
i still think this move is not THE move.i think we get a sell on the news the reason will be murky guidence.sometime this next 12mos we will get fantastic results with clear positive guidence and its off to the races.this has felt like facebook to me for a while post ipo i think we are holding the second coming of facebook.18 mos from now we will all be in shock how well this will have done.im just not buying this cutrrent move
Gotta be option action into earnings
Big miss upcoming unfortunately. Think it’s priced in at this point. Hopefully guidance can help in some regard. Got thousands of shares and I’m just gonna hold personally
"well, it looks like RBLX has found support at 75. I'm actually surprised. It's going to go back up to the 80's soon so, better hurry while there's still time!! ;0"
This #$%$ is coming back down from its 1 day bump?.back to new lows soon
"Mark my word, $95 in the next week. Roblox is partnering with VANS. should be a good event."
anyone else see that cup and handle forming on the 1 month chart?
it drops just before earning ? does it means it'll goes higher after earning then?
Where we headed today? $85 or $90?
Tomorrow opening
2nd wave of MM theft from retail...HOLD - 10 years!!
It will bounce off $75's
"looks like RBLX is forming a falling dagger. will be back in the 70's, but let's hope it still has support at 75. ;0"
"I'm happy that RBLX is above 80 right now, but will it finish out the week 80+ or will it be back in the 70' like the past few weeks? it's been very discouraging seeing corporate holders selling. hopefully. they will let it go up above 100+ but it not careful, I can see it being in the 70's again.."
COME ON LAST MINUTE PUSH
Bullish on this but had to sell my call as it was expiring this week and it was a 90 call. Was expecting a unity like move. Well least I managed to sell a 2023 85 put for some good premium
check out these 2 stock exploding now ALTO and SELB
"I have 1,000 shares of RBLX and 1,000 shares of CRWD, what a day I'm having."
Adage capital knows something….kicking roblox to the curve
"Got in this at 88 and thought it was a steal.......the scary thing with this stock is that it is so thinly traded and with a nearly 50 billion evaluation, if the July numbers coupled with a bland August earnings report are released, this thing could collapse to the 50s. In contrast, good numbers during the weak period of summer (July), and a rosy outlook could propel it over 100. The risk to could very well rewarding!!"
Due to the next COVID wave it looks like kids will be spending even more time playing Roblox and spending more money. Congrats to everyone who purchased shares during this oversold dip.
I am out very lucky bet today. See y'all tomorrow
"Hasbro also partnered with Roblox to put exclusive content on the platform, which helps spur further engagement and spending. Roblox has rolled out a subscription service, Robux Premium, that will help convert free users to paying users."
Short squeeze
"Another good time to buy more, just bought 1k more"
"Sure feels like this stock is being artificially suppressed & locked at current level for some reason—like it’s being gamed, with the likely result of an unexpected blowout ER on 8/16, leading to an old-fashioned ‘buy the news’, which this market has been missing"
ARK Invest bought in 11.5 million
PEOPLE SEE OPTIMISTIC.. im really aggravated with an average of 92.00 im down over 10 gran and to be honest i read alot of reports.. i think we are in trouble here
VERY BAD news and down below 75 in afterhours! won't be long before it'd below its IPO price of 60.50!! :(
"I bought  shares of Roblox for $64 a share. I hope  to hold it to $400 or so. This way I can help payfor my 10 year old daughter’s college education with the profit from these shares. If you’re thinking of shorting it, just know that you’re taking money from my daughter’s college education."
"A lot can be said for RBLX but something this game stock can lay claim to, it's the number ""1"" ""Baby Setter"" for kids up to 12 yrs. old ..my Grand Kids would live on it if the Parents would let them.I've made more money on this stock then any other and my 9 yr. old granddaughter was the one that told me I should buy it."
"“Roblox has become a leading platform with a mission to build a human co-experience that enables billions of users to play, learn, and build friendships in the metaverse. Recent advances in cloud computing, computing devices, and machine learning, enable the materialization of the metaverse. Take what we have in virtual reality today and fast-forward a few decades. Humans will be able to experience unimaginable things and in a couple of millennia virtual economies are likely to become bigger than the physical trade on planet Earth.”"
"Let's burn the RBLX shorts. Tuesday, Cathie Wood’s firm sold 21,937 shares in Netflix via Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW), estimated to be worth around $11.4 million. The firm bought 151,161 shares, worth approximately $11.5 million in Roblox via ARKW."

Nice Beat! Great future ahead
How is Cramer pump working out
"for kicks and grins has anyone thought about what this is worth on a buyout,i have and never came up with a number"
I just bought a leap. Great product and company. Good time to buy.
after it breaks 76.98 its going back down to 68
Theres two RBLX options both expiring this friday August 13th. The first is at $85 which there are over 10K buys and the next is at $90 with over 5K buys. This is driving up the shares.
Anyone in at $104? LOL  $75 looks better. Amazing how these CEO’s come public at the wrong time every time missing earnings already LOL  comical
back to $79 today
https://discord.gg/xYcB74H5
"95 is kind of high, but you won't find much better deal than 75!! glad I'm back in again. short and long term looks good. RBLX was due for a correction and I think this is exactly what we need to break the 52 week high. not too far off. have patience and happy trading all. ;0"
If Cramer pumps this stock anymore we'll be in the 60's
Earnings going to be atrocious today….this is sub $80’s before earnings and sub $70 as soon as report comes out
TTWO’s ER will lead RBLX drop harde later today!
"RBLX is only $18 away from breaking a 52 week high of 104 and just had some GREAT news and a deal with Sony! also, was upgraded recently. most kids get tired of minecraft, fort nite, etc., but NOT Roblox. it's the social media AND gaming for kids!! ;0"
Ok soup go play with ur bread
Revenue doubled….Sell?
"Seeing the results of SNAP, Twitter and the earnings momentum they are getting via tapping into advertiser spend, i see RBLX surfing that wave too. This is a winner."
buy now
Price to book today:93
Seems like many people are very concern on the headline that goes with something like booking not meeting expections that started by analysts and thus doing panic sell off.. Now seems like those same analyst pumping in again..
Is this sell the good news or the bad news?....
$45-50 IMO
BUY BUY BUY can't say it enough
Earnings must be gooood if keep going down.
Will buy at $40. MC too high
Roblox is up 9.21% to 85.10
"Interesting, good buying opportunity"
So this was a huge revenue miss if I'm reading the numbers right. $454 million vs $628 million expected.
all I got to say is metaverse... even Nvidia is talking about the metaverse on the conference call. we have to stop looking at daily average users and monthly average users and start looking and what this company actually does and what they're creating. I'm holding for a long time and buying on any dips
RBLX the comeback kid
"The metaverse is “a real-time, computer-powered 3D entertainment and social medium in which real people can go into a 3D simulation together and have experiences of all sorts”. And unlike Facebook and others, which only talk about it in their long-term future, it is currently at the heart of Roblox, in the here and now."
"Heavy CALL Buying and Interest with August 100, August 90 and August 95! A lot of people expecting a big move to the upside by the end of the month."
what is happening? i never know why RBLX goes up or down.
"Jefferies initiates coverage with HOLD and Target of $92. With it trading at $90, that's as close to saying SELL as it gets. Heading lower."
Market still sees RBLX as a typical gaming company. Big mistake.
$RBLX (Roblox) & $NSAV (Net Savings) are my two top contenders for this month. I'm in the long term for both but have a feeling this month is going to be a rollercoaster on these two. BULLISH all the way!!!
I see $100 soon.
My guess is shaking the trees a bit. I would not be shocked if we see a spike to 90+ through the week on stellar ER results. I am long on this stock but loaded up the boat on 03/10 IPO. This is an easy stock too make money on with 500 two 1000 volume low % swings.
See....v shape recovery
This is going back down
71 after ER
another pump from Jimmy Cramer just like his buy on DIDI
"I bought a $100 Roblex Gift Card from Amazon for a friend's 12 year old daughter. Last year I bought a $50 Card. That's what see wanted. P.S. She is a straight A student, so playing Roblex doesn't seem to hurt her grades."
Bullish because no one wants to live on this planet in reality life. We want to be in the metaverse or go to space.
The kids who developed games now they were those kids played games when they were younger.
I am an adult and i play....the possibilities for this are endless
Firework show begins in about 2 hours. I free'd up a little cash today should RBLX take a dive on the ER. Daughter had a b-day in July and she got roblok bucks. Christmas isn't that far away ad Santa needs to stuff stockings. Buy and hold in my book but we all know we aren't remaining flat after the ER today take your positions... GL
Red red red
"Based on my mistake , I bought this at $94 in June and right after that it decreased over 30%. I thought it will take over 8 months to get it back and thought about trade as collateral in options but , now I am confident that I will see green in less than 19 days. Just holding, first because no other option, now waiting for fresh income to buy more."
Fool is at it again. When they bash it means they shorted. In a week they will love the stock. However it’s up 5% today so their bash article has failed!
Haha if you sold. All the growth stocks were down today. Back up to $80's.
"Unstoppable growth stock. tripped up the last week, but will keep running with our without Delta."
"Amazing how much this matches the Facebook growth story, long before Facebook became the defacto standard for businesses to market to and communicate with their customers. In the early years, it’s all about brand name recognition and building a massive base by winning the popularity contest before all the lucrative and diverse monetization opportunities. RBLX is the future."
The metaverse is the future of the tech market. More selloff opportunity to buy RBLX at discount
This will be at the bottom of 60s by end of this week. This will fall big time tomorrow. Watch.
"Are there any news? Can someone please explain why this is going up, obviously I’m happy with my returns "
I can’t get over the 45 bil market cap. Love this company and growth- how do you reconcile the valuation?? Looking for an excuse to buy 
OUCH! will it hold 80 today or back in the 70's for weeks again?..
How can you not root for this co to do well???
volume is poor today.not sure this move means much
Just remember Roblox owns the market for ages 13 and under. No other gaming platforms can say that.
Great ER! A bit better than (realistic) we should have expected. This one is a winner folks. Watch. 
RBLX shorts ~ you all got greedy. Been wanting to own Roblox in our retirement IRA for some time. Bought in the post-market @ $76.50 and it looks like it will be a keeper. We shall see.
I heard about RBLX the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
market cap is 48 billion. even if net income was 2 billion it would be overvalued. revenue isn't even 2 billion
Green baby.
Bot 2k shares at avg 74.90 GL
Nice headfake AH.
"RBLX acquiring Guilded with cash or stocks? I am thinking of buying it back to gamble earnings.I mean, if the earnings r bad why would they buy something? If buying with stocks then tomorrow it will shoot up at least 15%-20%.My guess is $92-$95 after hours."
"with the jobs report very positive I cannot see RBLX rebounding too much higher than where they currently are. kids are all back in school and the growth of the company will be stunted by less DAU (daily active users). it's not even a question it's complete common sense. the company could add revenue streams to boost profits but with less players there will be less ""stickiness"" which means less money spent on the platform. not to mention the overall chart does NOT look very good for future investors. i see a slide after ER as I think too many have unrealistic expectations and the 10 year note (indicative for growth companies like RBLX) will not be held down forever especially if a recovery is happening. strangely people discounting the Covid-19 Delta variant as I have personally witnessed non vaccinated friends get incredibly sick in a matter of days."
"Guys, wait until next week and buy MRNA at $320 for a big bounce$320 is weekly major support!!!!!!!!!!!I am not short but waiting for next week"
"Okay, seriously I do not understand what’s going on here? Can someone please explain?"
"The market is up, I am not sure why this stock is down. Cathie Wood-led Ark Investment Management on Tuesday trimmed its stake in streaming video-on-demand company Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) despite earlier this month spelling out a bull case for its gaming foray and loaded up some shares in pure-play gaming company Roblox Corp. (NYSE:RBLX) instead.The investment management firm said in a note last week that even if Netflix managed to grab a “fraction” of the highly-competitive video-gaming market, it would see a “meaningful increment” in revenue."
10% on no news? What is this market becoming?
Hold. RBLX is a good long term investment and is certain to go over 150+ by the end of the year
New all time lows coming as 10 year note goes up
Man over sold. It will squeeze some short sellers from this level.
"if RBLX is already down 5% in after hours, imagine how low it will be during normal trading hours!! ;0"
Sub $70 here we come
Wow. Saw a lot of buying.
Heading back to $95-$100 this week????
Good vibes coming!
"Look on the bright side, only 3% down after earnings. That's like a non-event."
"They going to release the metrics for July on August 16th? Did they forget about the June metrics, or have they been released and i dont see them?"
Just saw a 21000 block went through
GREAT support in the 90's and shouldn't be long before in the 100's and all time high of 104! this could very well happen this week or even today.
Morgan Stanley raised the price target from $87 to $88 is this some kind of joke; they couldn't be a little more generous.
Of course. The bloom is off this thing. It derailed when they announced those user numbers a couple of months ago. Sorry Cramer. This was his absolute fav. This is toast. I'm sure he'll turn in it now. Watch.
I have 1500 shares and today I will buy another 500. Hopefully this will be enough for retirement.
News: China Slashes Kids’ Gaming Time to Just Three Hours a Week
"This is bad? “Revenue for the quarter increased 127% year over year to $454 million, and operating cash flow was up 64% to $191 million. Daily active users continue to grow, up 29% to over 43 million.”"

Looks like a retest of 85 coming.
$PENN $MRNA $RBLX $WISH
honest question. anybody else think RBLX will see 60's tomorrow or this week?
Something does not add up if the headlines are correct it was a massive revenue miss and yet the stock is barely down in aftermarket

Who doesn't think the CCP is buying shares of RBLX?
