Datadog dash conference tomorrow !
"$DDOG was hinted a few weeks before official PR. Look closely into PR. Who is hinted?? $CRWDTruContext ingests ANY data in its raw and native format, including PCAP, Netflow, Nessus, Splunk data, Crowdstrike, etc., making it easier for users to see machine data and find new insights - Users can now leverage TruContext to understand cyber threat data in real-time, enabling decisions to be made with confidence."
Current market cap $44 billion - lets see if they make so much in revenue...LOL
"New all time high today. Bad news for all the bears on strong volume. I get the PE issue but I could say the same for ZS,CRWD, and others. Sometimes momentum wins"
Datadog reached an all time high at 162.05
Anyone know what’s going on today?
Datadog reached an all time high at 167.00
super blowout earnings on 11/4
going to 150 before correcting
"Since late 2019 $DDOG CTO Alexis Lê-Quôc @alq took $677M in stock based compensation due to $DDOG grossly inflated stock valuation. Put that in perspective, $DDOG only did $603M in 2020 revenue. CEO @oliveur close second taking $500M. What's wrong with this picture? FOMO/MOMO. Oh and by the way the CTO has now sold ALL of his shares."
Gone beyond imagination. Be safe. This is next shoe to drop after e-commerce players. Covid gone. Reality hits internet infrastructure.

IBD has been giving DDOG a lot of good press.
Absolute bullish trend for this stock that is quite indomitable considering the correction in the Nasdaq over the last 5 weeks.
Got in 6/1/2020 so very pleased. The Dog is best in show. Going to watch for signs of froth around the mouth…
