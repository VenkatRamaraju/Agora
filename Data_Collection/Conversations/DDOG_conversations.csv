Datadog price target raised to $95 from $59 at Jefferies
Love the late bump!!!!
120-125 open tomorrow!!!
"My thoughts are that this stock will continue to make new highs until traders stop buying puts and sell the ones they're holding, then the bottom will fall out. Even the CEO should $21 million worth."
head and shoulders forming on all SaaS stocks
come on $150
"Analyst Actions: Truist Starts Datadog at Buy with $120 Price Target11:22 AM ET, 01/20/2021 - MT Newswires"
What a great play continues to be
Green on a day like this - superb
"No position here but congrats all longs, really takes courage to hold on to a stock at 35x sales especially in this shaky market! Good luck everyone!"
Loaded up after hours at 74.74
"There was a dude on here back in may, name of trousers mike. He owned 1,400 shares and bragged about selling them all at $90. Imagine what he’s thinking? $52 in missed gains Xs 1,400 shares! Wow"
This is at least a 100 bagger.
20 billion over 25 billion = 45 billion. PPS = 140
"Will look to get long again around $97. $92 would be ideal, but I don't think its gonna get there.Especially if KevLarpig is still short."
This puppy is definitely going up.
"Check out the holders (above) DDOG isn't in any index funds...yet. Wait until they are included in the S&P 400 at a minimum and likely the S&P 500. Blackrock, Vanguard, State Street, and the other index funds will be forced to pile into the stock. It's an excellent company and tech guys who are not stock guys swear by the company and the product it offers."
Had to sell -quick profit 145.00-will revisit.
It belongs in $200’s
"Should we be concerned that DDOG executives are unloading millions of dollars in shares, another $15 million today."
any news on DDog?
Is it still a good time to buy now?
"02:49 PM EST, 02/12/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Datadog's (DDOG) position as the leading observability platform for modern cloud environments supports a continued rapid expansion for the company, Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients Friday.There is an underpenetrated market estimated at over $30 billion brought about by powerful secular tailwinds in modern performance monitoring, which supports the firm's annual revenue forecast through 2023 to be more than 30%.The American monitoring service reported an adjusted profit of $0.06 per share for the fourth quarter, up from $0.03 per share in the same quarter last year. That was above the consensus estimate compiled by Capital IQ for $0.02 a share. Total revenue swelled to $177.5 million from $113.6 million, beating estimates for $163.6 million.While demand trends are looking better for the company, its guidance for 2021 does not confirm it, according to the analysts, who see Datadog's forecast as conservative.The company's 2021 revenue outlook sees 38% growth at the high end of guidance, compared with 66% growth in 2020. In contrast, the analysts believe the current trajectory of growth is around mid- to high 40% revenue growth.The firm maintained its equalweight rating on Datadog and gave it a base case price target of $120."
There is almost zero chance this stock doesn’t get to $100 at some point in next 3-6 months if not much sooner.
Holding thru earnings? Two quarters ago we came out with nice numbers but lost 40%….May numbers were similar but we gained it all back. Long term DDOG will be a performer but will probably get slaughtered in the inevitable “coming correction”. Never been great at timing the market but it’s tempting to try w/ the dog. Up 70% here and thus far pleased.
I bought in during low 70s. Used dips to buy more. Not regretted it yet. I’ve got confidence in the dog
DDOG reports integration with Amazon Elastic file system for AWS Lambda. Nice move off the news
technical analysis is begging for this to go up...
Converted my shares to short put. Hedgefunds most likely punish it after a good quarter
Ding Ding Ding
Revenue increased 87%
On a tear since May 27th. . The chart looks good as the trend continues up. The RSI is tame too. BUY DDOG.
"It is true, after crashing over 56% from peak, Zoom is not as overvalued as something else such as bitcoin, $GME, $AMC, $SNOW, $SHOP, $TEAM, $SNAP, $DDOG, $ASAN, $CRWD, $ZS, $MDB, $OKTA, etc. However, for realistic investing purpose, it is foolish to compare Zoom to those things. When valuation for these extremely speculative bets is imploded, these bets could easily tank 90% or more, and even if Zoom tanks 70%, it is still a foolish bet nonetheless.Going forward, Zoom is only projected by stock analysts to grow annual revenue by 17.6% next year, and zero growth on annual EPS. If the future reality is slow growth or worse, the P/E ratio could easily reset to 15 or lower, and trigger a crash of over 80%.Any opposing opinions out there think for sure Zoom would continue peak pandemic type of hyper growth for many many many years to come, and further think that the stock analysts are all wrong ??? Please provide your thesis in details."
This week will be epic
There is really not many on this board for such a promising stock
Great stock. Company has had several offers to be bought over the last few years. Everybody knows it is a 1st class company.
Just added 300 @ $73.76. Can't wait for earnings!
All sumilar stocks are down exactly as ddog. Check fsly crwd etc.
Trade what you see
alot of October call action here
short high..cover lower..short high cover lower..thats what algos do
"feel like selling, everytime it goes past 115, it drops back down to 100 & below...."
"Fact: DDOG is trading at 32 times consensus F2021 sales of $833mm.Fully diluted shares for Q1= 345mm.345 x$79 current share price = $27.2 billion market cap (Yahoo shows the mkt cap of 3/2/21 as ""current"" though we are much lower than we were Tuesday.)$27.2 billion divided by $833 million = 32.6 times sales. Not cheap certainly, but lower than many cloud peers. I will add more shares soon as this is now very oversold."
same action that happened in ARLO yesterday pullback then earnings were stellar i think the same is going to happen here.
will run up towards earnings date......in early november
Futures strong-DDOG should move towards a new high coming weeks before 11-16.
who lets the dog out? LOL
The company chose next to the last day to report its Q3. That is very strange for a hot IPO. We know the quarter is fine because they went public 12 days before the quarter ended and these were the top technology banks taking this public. My guess is that the company went public to negotiate a better price with Cisco. I also think they delayed their earnings in order to buy time to wrap up negotiations with whomever is looking to buy the company. Wouldn’t be surprised if we hear this getting taken out by earnings on November 12.
"My worst nightmare continues, DDOG crashed another 10% in after hour trading, stocks always crash after I buy it. I am not kidding, and this isn't even funny."
I think the fact that it jumped green with a minute to go is unbelievable
what happened
Strategic partnership with MSFT!!
Love this stock been holding sub 100. Where can I dive deeper in regard to some cool stuff about datadog ?
https://discord.gg/gvzYN35aZS
Just sold 300 DDOG at $93.20....Leaves 700.
"We'll be back at 100 soon, keep your hands strong."
Monday afternoon all will be crystal clear.
NET and DDOG are the best for me this year
"DDOG is my best performer over the last 6 months, in at $94.99 for my first two positions, a little over 45% return. Never got round to entering my third, now wondering whether to take a little profit and rebalance or put that third in..."
man...this one is way better than FSLY...
Lockup expiration just around the corner on March 17.

"OMG!!!!!! Trousers mike jedd sold this at $90 in June!!!!!! Lol he sold 1,400 shares at $90!!!!!!!Bhwahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Will finish $86+, will melt up prior to earnings because huge growth, and institutions know this!"
$65 price target.
Thank you!!! Just bought more.
"I don't think people here realizes how critical is $DDOG for their customers. Datadog is a must if you run any Cloud Infrastructure or applications and without it companies would be exposed to very costly outages. They are way ahead of their competitors and developers love it, that's why they are so sticky and have such impressive numbers."
what a comeback 
131 support level
"Solid earnings. Positive cashflow. Growing cash pile. Low debt. Also acquired Sqreen for cloud growth, this may be why it's down as announces simultaneously to results. I can see this hitting green by tomorrow but I wouldn't sell if it doesn't. Hold on for longer."
opportunity to get in if you were looking to buy. everybody wants pullbacks until they happen.
"Hey all $DDOG Long - via Call OptionsVery Bullish on This EPS & Fwd guidance.The key here is data centers and cloud management. This Covid has created a catalyst for companies to grow in new ways.And with that growth of companies like AMAZON, MSFT, OSTK, ETSY, ‘Telemedicine’ , Fintech, among other companies are expanding data centers n cloud space and therefor will need DDOG to help manage that growth.IMO, that’s why DDOG has been going up- EPS from online platforms reporting EPS beats n fwd growth.If AMAZON chose DDOG for their expansion, that tells you DDOG is pretty much the best in the game!Just like the best chip companies like AMD & NVDA are needed for their Chips/GPU/CPUS for the build out of these data centers Over the past few weeks I’ve notice 100K-500K++ Shs of DDOG being purchased at 358/359Pm.I’ve also noticed some action on some interesting action on the 8/21/20 125 Long Calls Only 0.60 each call ! IMO, I think DDOG will be around 100-105 by the day of EPS...DDOG will prob hit 100+ on Monday, considering it has a 52 week high of 98.99, reached a few weeks ago.Also, IMO, there should be upgrades preceding n following DDOG’s EPS Just some food for thought ...GTLA"
Looks Like hedggies trying to get out of shares at 117 for a profit. Will not hold
"February 11, 2020 6:18 AM ESTDatadog (DDOG) PT Raised to $54 at Needham & Company; Sees Good Q4The analyst commented, ""DDOG will issue 4Q19 results on Thursday, February 13th after the market close and will host a conference call at 5:00pm EST. We detect that DDOG has begun to charge for its newer products previously released to beta; we expect results could benefit from a period of pent-up demand as it begins to charge for these products after a free-trial period (a dynamic seen with Synthetics in 3Q19). As a result, we are slightly raising our FY20 estimates for both revenue and EPS. We anticipate the competitive landscape to remain favorable as other public companies reported strong metrics and noted displacement of open-source solutions within logging. We continue to believe DDOG delivers a strong combination of product/market fit that should enable it to execute well. We reiterate our BUY rating and raise our PT to $54."""
"$46 billion market cap with $600 million in sales? How is this sustainable? Well...when I look at the big holders of the company, the answer is clear....it's been piled into by wall street elite, and they've been pushing the price up. It doesn't matter that it's not worth it...money is flowing into the ""right"" pockets. This stock is absurdly overpriced...but most stocks that are piled into like this are. It's easy to keep them propped up...protect each others positions. Metrics on a commonly accepted basis...are terrible, but again doesn't matter on this ""bolated pig"" stock. In my view...it should be trading in the teens."
Oh it’s on a tear!! Where are all the shorters that I use to have to debate with?
Datadog reached an all time high at 75.77
This have another good one today!
Hope she holds and grows from here!
Thumbs up if you think this will be up on Monday.
"New all time high today. Bad news for all the bears on strong volume. I get the PE issue but I could say the same for ZS,CRWD, and others. Sometimes momentum wins"
Last call below 90....See you guys Tomorrow at 110
Squeeze begins?
MSFT cloud revenues went up...We are going to see huge upscale in DDOG revenue....no doubt it's going to reach 110 easily after quarter results.
Undervalued and under appreciated $95 tomorrow
"Datadog Announces Security MonitoringBUSINESS WIRE 3:05 PM ET 11/21/2019 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Datadog(DDOG) , the monitoring and analytics platform for developers, IT operations teams and business users in the cloud age, today announced Security Monitoring, a new product that enables real-time threat detection across the entire stack and deeper collaboration between security, developers, and operations teams. Modern security teams work closely with developers and operations as they build new products, to help them protect against threats in cloud-native environments. At the same time, security teams increasingly require the same visibility that developers and operations do. To address these challenges, Datadog’s Security Monitoring product processes monitoring data from the infrastructure, the network, applications, and security devices to surface potential threats. With threat detection rules directly operating in real-time on ingested streams, Datadog’s Security Monitoring maximizes coverage without any of the traditionally associated performance or cost concerns. “Our customers are moving into a world in which security must become a shared responsibility across engineering teams to address the increased complexity and scale of their environments,” said Marc Tremsal, Director of Product Management at Datadog(DDOG). “We built Security Monitoring to break down silos between security professionals and their DevOps peers, and provide real-time threat detection in modern hybrid cloud environments.” Datadog Security Monitoring provides powerful threat detection with the following capabilities: Unique Security Insights: Observability data, including infrastructure metrics, traces, and logs from Datadog’s 350+ existing integrations, and security-related integrations including AWS GuardDuty, AWS CloudTrail, Okta, Google Suite, and others -- combined in one platform to provide high fidelity security signals. Out-of-the-Box and Editable Threat Detection Rules: Rules curated by Datadog(DDOG) to detect widespread attacker techniques, so users can get started in minutes, without professional services. Users can also write and fine-tune their own rules without learning a proprietary query language. Real-Time Detection “Without Limits”: Rules are applied in real-time, as logs and events are ingested, with no prerequisite to index them. Collaborative Investigations with Existing Tools: Email, Slack, PagerDuty, JIRA, ServiceNow, etc. Reach developers and security users where they already work. Datadog's (DDOG) Security Monitoring brings greater visibility with one centralized platform shared by development, operations, and security teams. “Our developers and operations already rely on Datadog(DDOG) for observability, so we've been looking to leverage this comprehensive data for security,” said Martin Strýček, Head of Infrastructure at Kiwi.com. “With Datadog’s new Security Monitoring product, our AppSec team can analyze authentication events across all our applications with a single set of rules.” Security Monitoring will be demonstrated at Datadog’s booth in The Venetian, #2814, at AWS re:Invent in Las Vegas, from Monday, December 2nd to Thursday, December 5th.

insiders usually sell 45 million in stock before good news?
Let’s go 140
Finally being a good little dog .
"This train is starting to leave the station, all aboard!"
Tomorrow will see 90
"Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) Delivers Impressive Q2, Stock Soarshttps://stockstory.org/nasdaq/ddog/earnings/datadog-nasdaqddog-delivers-impressive-q2-stock-soars"
Today’s action was no good no.. but still not selling a share…
Whaaaaatttt just happened????
Where are all the impatient and concerned 'longs' today?
Taking dead aim at 140+
"Its funny to see people arguing about valuation. Have you guys checked tesla today? Amazon? Shopify? Zoom? A stock doesn’t always go up, in the last month fastly and datadog had a huge run. A drop is normal and more importantly it’s healthy. If you believe in the company stay in if you don’t then leave."
Next week we wave goodbye to double digits forever.
"Great earnings, conservative outlook (smart-easy beat), analyst upgrades. This will be a winner moving forward!!"
"They tweet, hinting about $DDOG stock price surge as if they have anything to do with that.I hope they can deliver something, of substance, revenue-wise.Anyone can make an app that integrates with an available API. The only thing that matters is can you generate revenue from it?.I have a ton of shares, of this stupid company, and I hope it rockets up, but at this point I would just like to break even."
going to 150 before correcting
looks like it wants to run into $140's
I heard about DDOG the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Why all the insider Sells? Top of Barrons list
150S+ EOY
Every dog has a bad day
"I just bought, I had bought in at 68 so wanted to bring my average down"

"Yep, exactly what we thought about Delta. Brought back plenty of attention on tech and biotech https://capitalmarket.exchange/bgxsq3"
Shady Play
"Datadog is not going anywhere but up. Stay in this for the long haul. Microsoft sees Datadogs long term value and so do a lot of other big investors. There will be a significant drop closer to the election, but after that Datadog clears $200 by next quarter and by 2022 will have merged with Terradata or NetApp to compete better with Oracle, Microsoft, and Dell"
"Need more but not until under $90, come on down to me"
One more free recommendation from a special person I know. $DDOG.Now back to NKLA. I love these two potential game changing companies.
"I think DataDog is a good company, but those that are investing have to understand DD’s 80% growth days are over. Full year revenue outlook for 2020 is $540M. Divide that by 4 quarters = approx $135M per quarterTheir 4th qtr revenue was $113.5M. Which means that the YoY growth would only be about 19%. That growth is less than their main competitors. The 80% growth rate is done and over. It’s only about 19% going forward."
$VISM Now a Partner!
markets marching down..we are marching up lol
What exactly does this company do?
Added 5k . Thank you CNBC
"DDOG held up well with a shaky market , onto next week!"
Great week again!!
Hedge funds are keeping this puppy under the radar while snagging it for a cheap price before it has one of the biggest earnings beats in stock history.
"Le-Quoc sold $46 Million in shares. That’s the sort of catalyst I need to start shorting.. the company is trading at 60x sales and is losing more money every year.. this whole sector is grossly overvalued. If big tech goes up I know this will probably follow, but the Oct $140 puts are calling my name"
Great company -- don't know why it's running more.People realized that runtime data is $$$$?
Buy buy buy . Next 2 days going to 90
I’d say we’re looking good!
Why people sold at 74? I added some at 76+.
One more partner datadog is coming!! #ddog
Rumor is Michael Vick owns this stock.
lockup period ended Monday. selling pressure is most likely from that
Who let the dogs out ?
"It's interesting to see that people start panicking whenever there's a slight pullback. We're up 149% this year, and with this 8% drop, we're up 141%. I don't know about you, but that's a win in my book. If you're in these stocks for the long-term, you know that the daily moves are merely noise and it's much more helpful to watch the monthly returns. Remember, last month, we did 8%, this month we were up 0.5% (prior to today), in June, we did 22%, and in May we did 58%.Datadog has never had a month where it loses more than 20% in the history of the company. This will be no exception. These stocks have more room to run, but when you think about the back half of the year, you have to wonder how far. If I were a betting person, I'd say we'll see low 100s by the end of the year, which still gives us 20%-30%+ upside capture between now and then. Any drop is an opportunity to add more. If you're working a job and are bringing in new capital, don't forget to buy your favorite stocks every time you get paid."
Let’s go $120
Thanks for the shares at 112

How long before this is a dow 30 stock...
Sleep tight. You’ve invested in a good company.
All alone for now till earnings
This is looking like a multi-day event ...150 anyone?
The company has negative earnings but positive cash flow.. meaning they are borrowing debt!Not profitable. High debt.Prospect of higher interest rates and worse economic outlook.This stock is overvalued right now by nearly 80%! Take your profit now!!
"Morgan Stanley:""DDOG positioned for rapid growth, likely to see over 30% annual revenue growth through 2023""Target $120."

"Rosenblatt just issued report, said they expect solid execution in report. Keeps Neutral $97 target.Earlier report today was RBC Capital expecting ""strong results with upside"". Keeps Sector perform, $105 target.Imagine if these firms actually liked the stock what their target would be?"
NOW at $34 is the right time to go LONG
Technical looking good. Short profit takers will look back and regret that they got tricked by manipulation!
"Bounced off support and it'll start heading to $100 over the next few months. If you understand DDOG's business model, their growth, their potential, it's worth well over $100. Long term holder here and in since $50."
Absolute bullish trend for this stock that is quite indomitable considering the correction in the Nasdaq over the last 5 weeks.
Datadog reached an all time high at 99.98
WOW Just saw the Oliver Pomei CEO of DDOG sold $32m shares during the quiet period?
"good actuallyFourth quarter revenue grew 56% year-over-year to $178 millionStrong growth of larger customers, with 97 $1 million+ ARR customers, up from 50 a year agoAnnounced an agreement to acquire Sqreen, a SaaS based security platform, and the acquisition of Timber Technologies, the makers of an observability data management productLaunched the general availability of Incident Management; enhanced Security with two new beta offerings"

gonna get a 20 percent pop on thursday
"I am long DDOG but Big whales gonna push it down once the market opens to create fears, such that they could get in at a lower price."
adjusted eps??????????...they lost money again?????????
"Cantor Fitzgerald's analysts held a conference call yesterday where they referred to DDOG, SNOW, Aviatrix, and Hashicorp as ""the new four horseman of infrastructure software"". I think that explains DDOG's outperformance vs. other cloud stocks today."

"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.

"The fact that this isn’t running up is good, less expectations for earnings, this will be 150 after earnings"
"100 soon. No debt, tons of sales."
Cloud and data are where its at yo!!! data security also and this sector is growing massively
The insider sales are options being exercised and sold. It's really not surprising that they are doing it. However the size of some of the trades does make me take notice.
Why after market yesterday was up only a little and only to see it up big today pre market? What is the difference between these two? I
How many think we will test the high again any time soon?

This is a Diamond stock
"Anyone remember mike/time from this board over the summer? The guy who bought at $97, kept buying into the dip to $75, then sold all 1400 shares at $90 and said “back to even, I’m out” and sold at $90. lol, wonder what his thoughts are here at $139? He lost out on like $80,000 in gains!"

I am bullish on this stock I amGlad it did pull back a bit time to do the entry some point today

Where's Kevin hiding today?
shares already tanked in pre-market before results are announced. Love the manipulation lol
Parabolic surges are typically driven by momentum investors and not long term investors. Be careful of the potential setup
Bought on pullback 134.90

Sold a couple items and picked up 450 shares of this. Let’s see what happens.
"I looked at institutions buying, extremely high buyers over Nov-Dec 2020. High revenue coming, maintained positive earnings when previously expected negative. Zero debt. Buy BEFORE earnings imo."
Ready to add more soon tomorrow run
"you smart guys out there, what am I missing all numbers beat so they spent some money, there will be upgrades"
Sold all today. That's very risky based on rising rates.
Couldn't have timed it better. Looking forward to $100 in April for DDOG!
been waiting for this moment all year.
"Got in on 101$, i ve always wanted to be part of DDOG, and I always miss the ride. Cheers"
Hi gentlemen. I’m in at 51.10 which is all time high today. But I don’t care short term down. I will be long and believe in this company
Cannot wait for this stock to prove people wrong and fly straight to the sky after earnings.
Can't find any news. Why's $DDOG up 5% today?
Just in--DDOG Upgraded to Buy from Hold at Berenberg.

Needham maintains Datadog with a Buy and raises the price target from $105 to $106
Bought 10 Dec 11 $100 calls today at $3.50. fingers crossed.
Could we open green tomorrow?
Almost entire earnings rally erased $135 to $125 POOF
Netlify Integrates with Datadog for Management and Analytics of Netlify Logshttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/netlify-integrates-datadog-management-analytics-150000231.html
this joke will be 20 bucks in 2 years
Think about this....DDOG raised its 2021 revenue guidance to $880-890 million.Up 47% year/year.The consensus was for $833. Berenberg won't be the last firm to upgrade.
Watch this break thru $36 today
"47 times 2020 sales? Or--34 times 2021 sales? Which is more relevant? The latter. DDOG sales are projected to grow 35% from $571to $773mm in 2020.They are profitable. Reminds me of when the bears used to point out PANW's high multiple years ago. That worked out ok for longs, no?"
listen to their Conference call. the CEO mentions that alot of their products are still early in the hyper growth stage. This company has not even scratched the surface of what it will be.
"Just added 400 at $77.97.Like I said when the clueless bashers are brazen, its time to buy."
I’m kinda falling in love with this stock
This company can grow revenues at 30% for the next 7 years at get to 3.7B revenue. Let's assume a 50% margin on that. Earnings would be 1.85B. In would still have a 24 PE.If this is not insanity I don't know what is. I don't blame anyone for trading the momentum but holding this stock long-term is a losing proposition.

"The drop shows potentially the market was actually expecting a way bigger beat. However the acquisition is non-recurring so factoring that in I feel good that DDOG has clocked a profit still and hit a good top-line number. 68% growth is not something many companies can achieve. These are early days, yes the price will fluctuate. The structural story looks good."
Should be 55 to 60
I am in 1k shares dog reminds me of FB back in the day. They have every box checked off great long term hold.
Any news for the run up?
The one thing that CRM stock does not have is ITLM. DDOG gives that to CRM. Benioff can pull the trigger hopefully after market close tomorrow?
"This is a long stock - the earnings will tell, not selling."
Great day if I may say. By the way my buddy’s company just signed up Datadog. Others will come as we grow and grow.
DDOG will blowout the earnings. Companies are investing in security software like DDOG’s like there is no tomorrow
Support at $75...then we bounce.
DDOG will break its all time high today!!!
$150 in a few weeks
$120 here we go
Need to break 85 to get to 100$
"""DDOG recently announced well over a dozen new capabilities available on its platform, including security monitoring and network performance monitoring. It's also well capitalized to support its growth, with $761 million in cash and short-term investments on the books at the end of the third quarter. Thus, it can sustain its current rate of losses for years as the company maximizes its growth potential in the short term."""
BOOM
"If the market doesn't take a hard sell off, this stock should do well. It's acting really nicely after it's recent pop on earnings."
85 will be a good entry point
I don't understand why its drop! any Speculations for tomorrow?
CRWD was in the $150's early 2020 I think. reported great earnings and now it is $260's.
Come on $150+
"Datadog has a unique lockup provision. If the shares close at or above $35.91 TODAY (which they did), it will allow the company to release about 20% or 43.8 million of the locked up shares early (on Monday)."
Got in a little too early (80.60) but believe it will recover most if not more by eod. Great earnings report.
"Datadog Sees Spike in AWS Lambda Serverless AdoptionBY MIKE VIZARD FEBRUARY 3, 2020 DEVOPS.COMDatadog published a report that shows nearly half of organizations using the company’s IT monitoring platform have embraced the AWS Lambda serverless computing framework.Stephen Pinkerton, a product manager for Datadog, said that number shows serverless computing frameworks are being employed by mainstream IT organizations far more widely than initially might be thought, given the relative age of serverless computing frameworks.The report finds the median Lambda function invoked by Datadog customers runs for about 800 milliseconds. Nearly one-fifth of functions execute within 100 milliseconds, while about one-third execute within 400 milliseconds. One-quarter of Lambda functions have an average execution time of more than three seconds, while 12% require 10 seconds or more. The duration of Lambda functions is notable because serverless latency impacts not just application performance but also costs. Lambda pricing is based on “GB-seconds” of compute time, which is the memory allocated to your function multiplied by the duration of its invocations.Not surprisingly, the report notes 47% of functions are configured to run with the minimum memory setting of 128MB. By contrast, only 14% of functions have a memory allocation greater than 512MB, even though AWS will allow up to 3,008MB per function.As part of an effort to further limit costs, most organizations are not employing a function to call another function and then waiting for a response, which would incur billable invocation time. Rather, serverless functions are making asynchronous calls via a message queue. Functions that are stateless most often read from or write to a separate persistent data store.Amazon DynamoDB, a document database based on a key-value store architecture, is the most widely used persistent form of storage accessed, followed by an instance of the SQL databases provided by AWS as a service, and then the Amazon S3 cloud storage service.The Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is the top choice for a message queue for Lambda requests, followed by Amazon Kinesis and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS).The report also notes each Lambda function has a configurable timeout setting, ranging from 1 second to 15 minutes. Two-thirds of configured timeouts are 60 seconds or less. By default, Lambda customers are also limited to 1,000 concurrent executions of all functions in any given region. Only 4.2% of all functions have a configured concurrency limit. A total of 88.6% of companies running Lambda make use of concurrency limits for at least one function in their environment.In terms of programming languages employed, Python and JavaScript in the form of Node.js are the most widely used on Lambda, the report finds. Nearly half of Datadog customers running Lambda (47%) employ Python, while 39% run Node.js. Python 3 outweighs Python 2, which has reached end of life, by a factor of two to one.Finally, the report notes there is a high correlation between organizations that have adopted containers and those employing serverless computing frameworks. Nearly 80% of organizations in AWS that are running containers have adopted Lambda. However, Pinkerton says that correlation at this point has more to do with the willingness of organizations to employ leading-edge technologies than it does any effort to weave together containers and serverless computing frameworks.Pinkerton also surmises the primary reason organizations are employing Lambda is to accelerate application performance. However, it’s also worth noting serverless computing frameworks also tend to reduce to the size of an application by relying on external functions to run code that is not frequently invoked outside the core application.Datadog plans to evaluate usage of serverless computing frameworks on other cloud platforms once they achieve enough critical mass. In the meantime, it’s clear serverless computing frameworks are rapidly becoming an extension of any DevOps pipeline."
I expect price target raises tomorrow. Closing green
"Needham reiterates Buy, RAISES price target to $109 from $106..."
"Trimmed some of my position to hold increase cash incase of a general pullback, have held since near ipo then bought again at 71 in may, will also be looking to rebuy any future dips of more than 30% from ATHs. insider selling bothered me a little but glad i tuned out the noise, truly believe in the fundamentals and growth of the company and think it’ll be one of my top stocks for the 2020s!"
"Is DDOG being added to the Russell Index tomorrow? If so, it's reconstitution day tomorrow..."
"Great growth stories. Hold it tight for long term. The rotation from growth to value has happened many times in recent years, and in the end it was always the growth that prevailed."
"I think this company will be worth $100B in 3 years, just extrapolating the current growth trajectory of 80+% y/y, and allowing it to cool a bit. That would be a stock price of about $360/share."
IBD has been giving DDOG a lot of good press.
140 after earnings
In from day 1. Time to move on. GLTA
