"Wow, Ortex says 33.77 million shorts shares in DISCA, while daily volume averaging only 4+ million. That's a lot of days-to-cover."
In at an average of 26.30. Couldn't pass it up. Looks like media stocks are going to be on the rise today!
"When most of the commenters on these Yahoo Finace boards are now shorts, you know the inflection point for any given stock has been reached."
"I'm a long term stock picker and been investing for almost a decade, not even a hype guy. But if this literally doubles-triples in 18-24 months, I wouldn't be surprised."
This closed at day/week/month/2021 lows today. But A shares are STILL at historically high prices - prices this traded at when 40M more us households had cable. All bets are off as to the downside here. But but but. At least now you can buy at relatively “normal” prices.
"The downtrend was established at the level of 28.77, when it is broken, I expect a sharp push up! the rsi is in an uptrend.it will be a bomb."
Great buying oppt. Will go back up to the $40-50 soon!
I bot in at $41+ when it fall from the grace. I don't see any hope of getting back to $40-50 sp in this year.
"Another problem, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, two of the firms at the center of the Archegos Capital Management unwinding, played a variety of roles before, during and after the margin call. Morgan Stanley was the first to give a lower price to maintain Disck at $34.00 from $39.00 today after the earning call. That means Morgan Stanley has little to no inventory to sell the stock and make a profit."
"According to Fintel, after more shorting yesyerday, DISCA Shrt Sqz score is now in 93.5% percentile of all stocks they track."
"This is a waiting game. My cost base is 29$ and i am not worry about it. I went to listen conference call and i am even more bullish. We need to understand that in 6 months disc+ gain 18M suscribers, they are rolling it out in another countrys. So if we assume that they will have 22-25M suscribers until the end of the year that already give you massive revenue boost. Last Q 750M in FCF on a enterprise value of 28B, and that FCF is low now becouse of capex which is use for rolling disc + and other stuff. So FCF will grow, revenue will grow and they are not buyback shares becouse of merger. So merger is just a plus, a big catalyst to drive this stock higher, even if doesnt happen they will use FCF to buyback shares and reduce debt significantly even if they wanna lavarage at arround 3. So this look like perfect storm, ready to explode soon. It is just boring. So take a brake and just watch you will be rewarded."
HBO Max will be cash cow. Prepare for Oct - Nov. rally when it goes live
"Discovery is today revealing Discovery Sports Events as the new corporate brand to represent our global promotion & events management arm, previously known as the industry renowned Eurosport Events."
There is ZERO reason for this to be up 4.50 a share or +20 percent YOY And for T to be down 2 bucks a share at same time. T is what y’all should have been buying.
$$$ cash flow machine Getting 20 cents on the dollar invested here Couldn't care less on what the ticker price is going to do in the next quarter or twoInvestment is putting money to get money back later from the asset. Not by selling to somebody else but what the asset itself will produce. If you are an investor you are looking at what the asset will do in our case the business. If you are a speculator you are looking at what the price of the object is going to do independent of the business.
Does the CEO really get paid 25 million a year?
"Why is there such a huge gap in % change in price today, between DISCB (up 23.1%) and DISCA (down 1.2)%?"
Seizert Capital Partners Buys Discovery Inc (Added Position)
"$DISCA had overall good results. revenue increase but also less 3% of subscribers. DISCA holds 4% of the streaming market in the US while VIAC has 12%, 8% via Paramount + plus 4% via Showtime with a total of three times more content than Discovery. viac in Q2 will have a streaming increase of about 5.5 million new users because last quarter paramount + held 7% of the market and now holds 8% Showtime held 4% and now this quarter is also at 4% with a total growth of US market streaming of 25%.if we sum it up, it turns out to be a growth of 5.5 new users"
bought more :p
Never seen a group of more delusional longs in my life. Buying this is like investing in horse trolleys when cars were invented.
Remember: DISC is still UP 10 percent YOY. The runway down is lonnnnngggg for companies who were super late to the streaming game and whose every dollar of profit comes from slowly dying businesses.
Someone please tell me why anyone would buy this when an alternative divvy paying equity exists that gives you almost the same reward potential with much less risk. I have been waiting since merger announcement for someone to tell me.
Another possible prospect is the advantage of DISCB Voting shares will be held in equal value come merger so trade them up before value shrinks
"I've never seen a stock fall like this, despite: (1) so clearly beating earnings estimates; and (2) having already fallen so far, BEFORE the earnings were announced."
All I care about with this stock is the high short interest.
"AT&T stock has stagnated for years because they paid big dividends instead of investing in next-generation infrastructure. They overpaid for Time Warner, then failed to realise the value of that asset. AT&T & Discovery have both dropped after the merger announcement because the market can't assess the potential value of Warner Bros Discovery. On top of this, AT&T are halving their dividend after the merger completes. Telecoms is a low margin business with huge infrastucture costs. AT&T has a P/E ratio of 18.74. Verizon has a P/E of 11.29.Streaming media is a high growth business. Netflix has a P/E of 62.25 & Disney has a P/E of 107.8. DISCK has a P/E of 12.38. No one knows when DISCK & AT&T will bottom, but the potential upside for Warner Bros Discovery is much better than that for AT&T."
All I have been is right about this stock for 3 months. Why should this rise???? There are no valid reasons.
Quicksand. Who wants to be 43B in debt. Are the Board or Directors of DISCA sure they want this deal?
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."

"Final volume today was less than 10% of the total short interest. Given recent low volume, can someone explain to me why an investor couldn't simply plop $20 million on a big buy of DISCA tomorrow morning, and simply take profits as a sizeable percent of the 33 million short shares are forced to cover?"
"Green week, going to 30 32.5 (big option volumes at 17 sep)"
"Doesn’t matter how many calls I write against my position, I keep losing money on this "
big fall
"Why this look exactly like nokia 6 months ago, and DBX 1 year ago. Same think happen, many bears bashing it, laughing at me, telling me i am delusional and bam 50%+ on both stocks after that and all of them were gone after. Never soon them again. Guys if you are not adding at this lvl and reducing your cost base, you must be clueless. Go check last Q, check FCF check forecast, and then check valuation. Trust me, dont forget what i said. Put this stock in your portofolio trust me. See ya in 6 months."
"I'm going to be easier on John, being a dementia patient must be difficult as it is, poor old man is clearly in cognitive decline."
Where are the cheerleaders???? Sorry boys and girls. This was the easiest short in the market when merger was announced.
shorties are in trouble!
"The 20 fifteen-minute Moving Average has finally crossed above the 50 fifteen-minute Moving Average. This has been a very bullish sign for DISCA in the past, at least for the following 2-3 days."
Frustrating to see exactly what I thought would happen to this stock happen. Even with a bubbly market. I covered too soon. This company is a bundle of risk with no dividend. I hope I’m wrong and this surges but I see more red tomorrow.
"Discovery+ is launching in The Philippines, in a partnership with local telecoms giant Globe. In low income, less developed markets and those where credit card usage is not widespread, partnerships with local telecoms or cable firms can offer billing and marketing by the telco that enable lower cost packages and wider access(@Variety). Globe Telecom has 76.65M mobile subscribers & 4M broadband subscribers"
oh yeah!!!
Now imagine what will happen to this if the market actually goes down by more than 0.3 percent. I been looking out for prospective longs since $34.
"Zero reason this should be trading in high 20s, where it traded when 40 million more us households had cable."
Goes up a little... Crashes double the following day.... One of the most manipulated stocks... So undervalued.... Can't believe how stocks can be controlled... I wish regulators looked into this closely...
"YTD A shares are down 11 percent. K shares are down 1.8 percent. It’s clear that these will be near parity when deal is consummated, as they should be. I just don’t get why anyone would buy this, especially A shares."
panic buying
Volume today could be at a record low.
Hedge funds shorting and working overtime to hold 2-hr RSI under 30.00. They know damnwell that's a key crossover.
If Zaslav really gets a billion dollars if the stock price reaches 43$ then why isn't he doing everything he can to pump it up in anticipation of the merger?
"I look at this stock and say, no one will be surprised when it trades over 40.2 years or less and I’m cashing in over 40."
"This stock traded between $18-32 in the five years before covid. It was in a secular decline before the pandemic because of the macro trends in its industry, namely core cutting. Archegos artificially pumped it to near $80. But that wasnt real. Low 30s are the REAL 6 or 7 year high for this stock (talking about A shares)."
Forget $30. That’s not happening. If A shares ever get to $28 again I am opening new position. A man can dream.
"Once 2-hr RSI goes over 30.00, shorts will cover."
today is the bottom. Do your own DD.
good day! I'm looking forward to tomorrow. I hope tomorrow the shorties will be broken!
Benziga said yesterday that DISCA is a great stock and a Buy because of a very low forward P/E multiple. Google it.
The vsco spinoff from bbwi has unleashed billions of hidden market cap. Disck and T spinoff combined value will unleash billions of dollars in the new Company. I cannot wait until this combined monster is fairly valued in the galaxy of NTFLX valuation metrics.
Discovery owned a lot of well known channels. Great buying! Will be back up to $70 soon!

I can't take it lying down no more. I acted and sold all of it and took a huge loss from $40's. I licked my wound and go forward. Best thing I have done - sold. IMO
"Social media star David Dobrik is back—now with his own TV show.Dobrik has a landed a deal with Discovery+, the streaming service owned by the parent company of the Discovery Channel, to film a travel series starring himself and several returning castmastes from his YouTube channel. The program, Discovering David Dobrik, will debut later this year in a 10-episode run.Dobrik landed at No. 9 on Forbes’ 2020 list of the top-earning YouTubers, bringing in an estimated $15.5 million. On Discovery+, Dobrik will join homey fare from networks like HGTV and the Food Networks as well as series from the company’s core offering, the Discovery Channel; Dobrik’s show is, presumably, a gambit to find content to draw in younger audiences who are more used to their entertainment coming from YouTube or TikTok videos than full-length TV shows. The streaming service launched in January and had accumulated 18 million subscribers through August.(via @Forbes)"
"There is one problem with netflix in coming year and that is content. When all of them stop selling content to netflix and that is gona be soon, you will see explodion at disca. Imagine what gona happen with netflix then? Btw content they are having is pure garbage that why most of my friends cancelled netflix, same us me. Nothing to watch, when Disney +, discovery + and future NEWCOMP will have content liberty for years to come. Most importnat metric for discovery is FCF right now and it look amazing, that why we aee buying at this lvl, burry is buying and all smart money is adding slowly. It is cheap, you dont generate 800M in FCF last Q for nothing. Merger will happen and then you will see explodion, now is time to add."

Insider Monkey: 1 of 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Michael Burry
"I promise to shut up FOREVER if someone tells me why they should buy THIS company over T if they believe in the potential of NewCo. This has zero divvy, gargantuan unknowns, profit generators drying up. T has monster divvy that will merely be huge divvY and will get to focus on telco/wireless biz. PLUS you get decent ownership stake in the wildcard NewCo. There have been ZERO valid responses to this question since merger announcement. Buy T. That’s it!"

We are definitely going to watch Discovery."
Could be details imminent on the Warner Discovery deal. It’s about time.
It is truly remarkable that A shares are STILL above 28. Near non Archegos highs and it’s trading as if there weren’t 40 percent fewer HHs with cable than 7 years ago.
"Most of people are looking at disca like merger play, but checl the last Q. Do you see almost 800M in FCF in one Q on this valuation, lets say 3B FCF this is 10% of enterprise value per year. Do you have any idea how cheap company actually is? So merger will just put this valuation much much higher. Why do you think Burry bought it? Its a safe play, how much more this can go down? Its already by all metrics very very down. This is time to buy, merger will happen i dont know if you see but they are already preparing cash for it, someone ask why they dont BB shares, well here is your answer. They are spending on more for Disvocery plus which is gona be massive cash machine. Wait until end of the year when disc start going up and up and up, and then merger happen and you gona see 40-50 dollars."

"How can 31.6 million short shares ever cover, when daily volume is recently averaging around 3 million shares? Anyone?"
Revenue up21% over the prior-year quarter and earnings per share hit $1.01 comfortably beating analyst's estimate of $0.85. Stock fell 6%. Thank you for letting me buy more at dirt cheap!

"New this morning on TD Ameritrade: DISCA is now increased by TipRanks to an ""8"" (on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being highest)."
"Advertising rebounded strongly in the second quarter, enabling Discovery Communications to easily beat Wall Street’s estimates.Total revenue climbed 21% over the prior-year quarter, reaching $3.06 billion, as earnings per share hit $1.01. Analysts had expected revenue of $2.97 billion and earnings of 85 cents"
There is even no bounce!What a manipulated joke!
"Discovery announced quarterly results that beat expectations with its headline numbers, including revenues that rose 21% to $3.06B. However, shares fell as market watchers focused on the company's streaming efforts, which merely met expectations with 17M paying customers as of the end of the quarter. However, RBC is staying bullish, with a price target of $52 now implying 88% upside. Subscribers were in line with its expectations. And stronger free cash flow generation offers upside to the transaction's leverage profile. Wells Fargo has a $46 price target stated today. Plus, Discovery exploring takeover bid for UK's Channel 4, which will increase revenues substantially. They sold Great American Country network, which increased their earnings an additional .09 cents in their recent quarter. We should see some upgrades this week. Channel 4 said its revenues were 934 million pounds, Discovery should get a good buck for it."

"Morgan Stanley bought another 500,000 shares."
"This morning, Ortex issued a new Buy signal on DISCA."
I have said this probably 50 different days since the merger/spinoff announcement: Archegos manipulation warped people’s minds so they don’t realize how overvalued this dividendless company is. It’s all risk with almost no reward potential. If you want a piece of the NewCo than buy t! And collect a divvy while you wait. Sometimes it really is that simple folks.

"Yea Michael Burry bought discovery and most of us smart investors did that, not only because of merger, is because of FCF, and because is cheap, with huge potential of Discovery plus. So downsize is very limited, but upside potential is huge. So risk/reward is on our side. Probability that DISCA go down is very low, and to go up is huge and we are talking about 50%-100% gain in next 2 years."
Interesting divergence between $DISCA and $VIAC in past month. Not in lockstep seems like - one pushing up and one down

"Another possible explanation for a sell-off following good news can be related to noise traders. It could be short sellers are changing their positions and allowing the stock to fall to become buyers. Another reason, Disney stock fell. The fundamentals are good with increase of revenues and earnings. By the end of the day it should turn positive."
Recent longs look at how far it dropped from not real prices and think that means it’s a value. But discovery’s profitable businesses are dying. And it’s growth biz is super late to a crowded marketplace with thin margins. Learn the biz people. God bless.

Finally got in at a value price for a long term position. I don’t care what it does in the short term as there’s too much value in this stock. Easy 2-3 bagger here in 12-18 months - GLTA
"Sept 8 (Reuters) - The HBO Max streaming service will be available in six European countries on Oct. 26 and will launch in 14 additional territories next year, AT&T T- owned WarnerMedia said on Wednesday.The service will be available in Spain, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Andorra and will include films and series such as ""Harry Potter,"" ""Game of Thrones"" and ""The Big Bang Theory."" The company will announce pricing and additional content details in October.Streaming services are expanding overseas in a bid to grow subscribers as the U.S. market slows. Being early to market is important because of the widely held view that consumers will subscribe to several - but not all - available streaming services.Europe is WarnerMedia's second international rollout of HBO Max, which debuted in the United States last year. In June it launched in 39 territories in Latin America and the Caribbean, where the company is selling two subscription plans, starting at $3 per month.In July WarnerMedia Chief Executive Jason Kilar told Reuters that HBO Max subscriber growth in Latin America will exceed the absolute number of subscriber additions in the U.S. market over the second half of this year and that he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if that trend persists into 2022.On a call with analysts the same day, AT&T raised its forecast for global HBO Max subscribers to between 70 million and 73 million by the end of the year. It previously expected 67 million to 70 million subscribers. nL4N2OY1V5The service's expansion comes as AT&T is preparing to close a deal to combine its media content with Discovery DISCA and focus on its original business of providing phone and internet services."
Is this stock ever going to go up??? What a disaster for my portfolio. Oh well.
Michael Burry also bought about 800k shares at 27.* price.It just can't be that bad)). I hope we will see 28 after conf call.Wish you good weekend 
"If you look to $disca and $t you can see they pop at same time, broken the down trend and same time. Need to be something about the merge."
why has this dropped so much ?
$39 by next summer
Equity Investment Corp Buys Discovery Inc (Added Position)
The. Fade. Looks like it has come early today. Hope you all sold this am.
Risk off = Disck On!Ready for take off
"accumulation. shorties are already pulling their fingers to the "" buy "" button )"
Disca Heavily Shorted squeeze up with recent favorable news
"Barely over 4 million shares traded today (near alltime volume low), with obvious substantial shorting. Meaningless to me, since earnings report is coming Tuesday AM."
DISCA short interest is still over 33 million.
2021.08.30_Monday_14:41 EDT - I think that the trade is halted since 14:25 EDT today.
"I wish wish wish I was and am wrong on this but I have not been. DISC remains a company whose ONLY profits come from dying parts of its business. It is positioning itself as a growth play with no road to profitability on that front. Plus even if you believe in the growth part of this equation you can just buy T and collect a divvy while you wait. T: a company that is actually down 10 percent YOY, not up 17 percent like DISC. Nobody has ever explained to me why I am wrong. Goodnight."
Remember: DISC is STILL up more than 10 percent YOY. There is STILL lots of runway down for a legacy cable provider who is losing 50 percent of its operating cash flow in the shift to streaming (no carriage fees in streaming).
Will it reborn?
"Even after the darkest night, dawn comes, and heavy rain ends with a rainbow.the bulls will crush you shorties"
The Nasdaq is still 2 percent from all time highs. Where are those people who told us this would rise if and when the market fell???
I can see how atnt share price will drop due to the merger but can anyone give me some what basic math as to how disca will be affected if at all?
33M short shares can't cover (volume is way too low) so they just keep shorting instead.
"Good posts by Edward. Looks like a lot of big money recently buying this stock: Seizert Capital Partners, Sterling Investment Management and Hillman Capital."
DISCA is due for an upward Fibonacci retracement.
"Volume is now so ridiculously low, shorts in DISCA are effectively trapped. This stock is incredibly ripe for a $2 - $3 upward squeeze. Regardless of all other factors, for that reason alone, I will HODL."
Got my order in for 26.45. Looks like a good short term trading opportunity to me.
This is not up 15 percent from covid low. It’s up 15 percent from September 10 2020. This is currently double the covid low.
"4 man race - Netflix, Disney, Amazon and Warner Bros. Discovery. Content is KING and Warner Bros. Discovery has it in spades."
Pretty wild that disc B shares went up 20 percent today.
this is a bad joke
MGM with 1.5B in revenue sold for 8.45 billion.Reese Witherspoon's production company with revenue of a measly 26 million just sold for 900mm.Disca has about 11 Billion in revenue and an enterprise value of about 23B. Go figure.
can someone tell me why this dropped hard as hell this year? like it did a massive drop
There was heavy blocks of selling today at two levels: 27.20 and then later on at 26.85. This is going to close near the lows even as market has fully rebounded. Another winning day for those with short positions. I don’t see this reversing in the near term.
Nasdaq is now down 0.1 percent. A shares are down 10x that. Longs know there is no reason for this to rise in short or medium term.
"I like this from the Q2 earnings release: ""For Q2, Discovery was the #1 most-watched pay-TV portfolio in the U.S. among key demographics(7) and the #1 portfolio in all of television for average time spent viewing among women aged 25-54.(8) Additionally, HGTV and ID were the #1 and #2 cable networks respectively among women aged 25-54 in Total Day during Q2"" ........oh yeah!!!"
What do u guys think about the debt now and after the merger? 55bn by my calculations or roughly 4-5x ebitda - seems quite significant or whats your opinion?
"Wow, Ortex shows there are still 33 million (MILLION!) short shares in this beaten-down stock. When will all those shorts cover?"
"Hi all, i have been partially following disca for a while - it seems like a nice value bargain - what i dont fully get yet is how the merger will affect the business. What are your opinions as to the effect of the merger?"
Great news from Poland
