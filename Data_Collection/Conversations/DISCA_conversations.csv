Will it reborn?
"@John! No one wants to hear from you. Don't believe me, let the thumbs up or down decide."
Game over?
Risk off = Disck On!Ready for take off
"Another problem, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, two of the firms at the center of the Archegos Capital Management unwinding, played a variety of roles before, during and after the margin call. Morgan Stanley was the first to give a lower price to maintain Disck at $34.00 from $39.00 today after the earning call. That means Morgan Stanley has little to no inventory to sell the stock and make a profit."
"I think this is classic ""sell the news"" but the next few months will see a rise in price. Discovery+ seems to be growing at a great rate."
Nice turnaround. I hope it keeps going up but I’m not hopeful. I’m not going anywhere. I am rooting for you longs. Good luck.
"Barely over 4 million shares traded today (near alltime volume low), with obvious substantial shorting. Meaningless to me, since earnings report is coming Tuesday AM."
"AT&T stock has stagnated for years because they paid big dividends instead of investing in next-generation infrastructure. They overpaid for Time Warner, then failed to realise the value of that asset. AT&T & Discovery have both dropped after the merger announcement because the market can't assess the potential value of Warner Bros Discovery. On top of this, AT&T are halving their dividend after the merger completes. Telecoms is a low margin business with huge infrastucture costs. AT&T has a P/E ratio of 18.74. Verizon has a P/E of 11.29.Streaming media is a high growth business. Netflix has a P/E of 62.25 & Disney has a P/E of 107.8. DISCK has a P/E of 12.38. No one knows when DISCK & AT&T will bottom, but the potential upside for Warner Bros Discovery is much better than that for AT&T."
Can any one kindly explain the difference between discA vs discK stocks?
John and I will both be glad when this finally drags itself over 30
Shorts will NOT be hurt today on DISC. I remember days like this. They were glorious. Markets green. Disc red. Hope I’m wrong. Godspeed longs.
"While Disney continues to kill it with streaming, the shorts continue to pound away at DISCK and VIAC. It is only a matter of time till they're no longer able to keep the pressure up and these stocks rocket higher. The money it's taking to keep these stocks down is staggering, they're now locked into their positions. The shorts will soon be forced to buy back and yet again get their collective backsides ripped open. Why they seem to be in denial or simply glutens for punishment is beond me. However, I will enjoy thier short coverings. Keep piling it on!"
All I care about with this stock is the high short interest.
big fall
The. Fade. Looks like it has come early today. Hope you all sold this am.
today's wild ride should teach everyone to NEVER overreact
John sounds desperately negative...lol...I wonder why. bought some myself today
"I like this from the Q2 earnings release: ""For Q2, Discovery was the #1 most-watched pay-TV portfolio in the U.S. among key demographics(7) and the #1 portfolio in all of television for average time spent viewing among women aged 25-54.(8) Additionally, HGTV and ID were the #1 and #2 cable networks respectively among women aged 25-54 in Total Day during Q2"" ........oh yeah!!!"
There is ZERO reason for this to be up 4.50 a share or +20 percent YOY And for T to be down 2 bucks a share at same time. T is what y’all should have been buying.
Nasdaq is now down 0.1 percent. A shares are down 10x that. Longs know there is no reason for this to rise in short or medium term.
"This is a waiting game. My cost base is 29$ and i am not worry about it. I went to listen conference call and i am even more bullish. We need to understand that in 6 months disc+ gain 18M suscribers, they are rolling it out in another countrys. So if we assume that they will have 22-25M suscribers until the end of the year that already give you massive revenue boost. Last Q 750M in FCF on a enterprise value of 28B, and that FCF is low now becouse of capex which is use for rolling disc + and other stuff. So FCF will grow, revenue will grow and they are not buyback shares becouse of merger. So merger is just a plus, a big catalyst to drive this stock higher, even if doesnt happen they will use FCF to buyback shares and reduce debt significantly even if they wanna lavarage at arround 3. So this look like perfect storm, ready to explode soon. It is just boring. So take a brake and just watch you will be rewarded."
upside is 40 - 42! Downside is 27! do your own DD.
"Another possible explanation for a sell-off following good news can be related to noise traders. It could be short sellers are changing their positions and allowing the stock to fall to become buyers. Another reason, Disney stock fell. The fundamentals are good with increase of revenues and earnings. By the end of the day it should turn positive."
"Zero reason this should be trading in high 20s, where it traded when 40 million more us households had cable."
Comcast stock fell after its chief financial officer signaled a third-quarter slowdown in broadband subscriber growth. Also brought down DISCK and VIAC with this morning.
I bot in at $41+ when it fall from the grace. I don't see any hope of getting back to $40-50 sp in this year.
"This morning, Ortex issued a new Buy signal on DISCA."
40 coming no question! Do your own DD. meme squeeze will spread to disca.
"Ortex reporting 33.45 million shares short in DISCA. AGAIN, DAILY VOLUME IS NOW AVERAGING AROUND 3.0 - 4.0 MILLION, so we are now at almost 10 days-to-cover for shorts. Have fun with that, shorts."
Longs have been calling the bottom on this for 3 months. I have warned you all. And I have been right.
"4 man race - Netflix, Disney, Amazon and Warner Bros. Discovery. Content is KING and Warner Bros. Discovery has it in spades."
"Not too surprised that’s this is bouncing back up with VIAC, I’m still in the red but it doesn’t matter much. After the merger with Warnermedia $$$$"

Could the international advertisers cancelling their Olympic spend be having an impact on DISC?
"for long term investors, the stock is at a lower price today than what is was 5 years ago ($30 per share) from a high in 2013 $45 per share. Since the end of 2013 Disc is down 30% vs a raise in the S&P of 170%."
$$$ cash flow machine Getting 20 cents on the dollar invested here Couldn't care less on what the ticker price is going to do in the next quarter or twoInvestment is putting money to get money back later from the asset. Not by selling to somebody else but what the asset itself will produce. If you are an investor you are looking at what the asset will do in our case the business. If you are a speculator you are looking at what the price of the object is going to do independent of the business.
"I promise to shut up FOREVER if someone tells me why they should buy THIS company over T if they believe in the potential of NewCo. This has zero divvy, gargantuan unknowns, profit generators drying up. T has monster divvy that will merely be huge divvY and will get to focus on telco/wireless biz. PLUS you get decent ownership stake in the wildcard NewCo. There have been ZERO valid responses to this question since merger announcement. Buy T. That’s it!"
"Silly shorts staying too long at the party. All the meat is off the bone and the intellectually challenged continue to short. The easy money is gone, this stock is primed for longs, no matter how much you wish it wasn't."
I have said this probably 50 different days since the merger/spinoff announcement: Archegos manipulation warped people’s minds so they don’t realize how overvalued this dividendless company is. It’s all risk with almost no reward potential. If you want a piece of the NewCo than buy t! And collect a divvy while you wait. Sometimes it really is that simple folks.
Strong volume today Sid! I guess your low volume thesis didn’t hold up. I’m afraid there will be more red here tomorrow. This is still up 20 percent in a year. Buy T. it’s actually down 8 percent YOY. AND has a divvy.

"When most of the commenters on these Yahoo Finace boards are now shorts, you know the inflection point for any given stock has been reached."

"Discovery+ is launching in The Philippines, in a partnership with local telecoms giant Globe. In low income, less developed markets and those where credit card usage is not widespread, partnerships with local telecoms or cable firms can offer billing and marketing by the telco that enable lower cost packages and wider access(@Variety). Globe Telecom has 76.65M mobile subscribers & 4M broadband subscribers"
High risk. Smallest chance of reward. No reason to buy this. ZERO.
DISCA short interest is still over 33 million.

"Hi all, i have been partially following disca for a while - it seems like a nice value bargain - what i dont fully get yet is how the merger will affect the business. What are your opinions as to the effect of the merger?"
"just as I suspected ..and wow, that was a great qtrly report ..beat handily on revs AND earnings ..hehehe"
So much positivity from new longs. Same initial positivity that I saw from retail buyers at 34 on down. Almost all will sell.
One week until earnings. I think it will be good.
Goes up a little... Crashes double the following day.... One of the most manipulated stocks... So undervalued.... Can't believe how stocks can be controlled... I wish regulators looked into this closely...

All I have been is right about this stock for 3 months. Why should this rise???? There are no valid reasons.

"Yea Michael Burry bought discovery and most of us smart investors did that, not only because of merger, is because of FCF, and because is cheap, with huge potential of Discovery plus. So downsize is very limited, but upside potential is huge. So risk/reward is on our side. Probability that DISCA go down is very low, and to go up is huge and we are talking about 50%-100% gain in next 2 years."
Today’s big beat ($1.01 vs EST $0.85) is just the beginning. Also note the 17 million Discovery+ subs. Q3 will be an even bigger beat.
Told y’all to wait til 358pm if you wanted to buy today.

Today was the final panic flush. One way up from. Long and strong

It's seems someone just drawing the numbers 
I will not make any grand pronouncements about this stock. I've been crushed by false hope too many times. BUT today did feel good. I hope that we can continue this tomorrow.
"$DISCA had overall good results. revenue increase but also less 3% of subscribers. DISCA holds 4% of the streaming market in the US while VIAC has 12%, 8% via Paramount + plus 4% via Showtime with a total of three times more content than Discovery. viac in Q2 will have a streaming increase of about 5.5 million new users because last quarter paramount + held 7% of the market and now holds 8% Showtime held 4% and now this quarter is also at 4% with a total growth of US market streaming of 25%.if we sum it up, it turns out to be a growth of 5.5 new users"
Remember this is STILL up 15 percent YOY. Archegos warped this stock and people into buying. this is why there was always so much downside runway.
Best content and management. Will one day be worth more than nflx
"my nephew has 5000 shares of disca. he also has 5000 shares of att. now, he wants to be in one company or the other, not both, with the prospective merger looming. i am not qualified to advise him at all. ( and suffer the wrath of my sister) i respect opinions on this board. thanks"
Told ya shorts had zero reason to worry today. I know the feeling. Congrats to all who are still holding and waiting to cover. I’m jealous.

"Greetings I am buying AT&T as much as I can looking forward to the family mergers, The longer it takes I'm just buying AT&T more.The dividend definitely better than any Bond out there and with a great merger comes a great company, I see AT&T out on the streets connecting fiber upgrading also that's sign of a great company today taking care of its customers , we are streaming and I'm sure DISCA can be our favorites. We are definitely going to watch Discovery."
They had some interesting insights about DISCA on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
This is finally trading where and how it should be. This is what people who know the business have been waiting for. And just wait until the market actually goes down. I am so weak. Couldn’t hold my short.
Pretty wild that disc B shares went up 20 percent today.
"I look at this stock and say, no one will be surprised when it trades over 40.2 years or less and I’m cashing in over 40."
Never seen a group of more delusional longs in my life. Buying this is like investing in horse trolleys when cars were invented.
"Most of people are looking at disca like merger play, but checl the last Q. Do you see almost 800M in FCF in one Q on this valuation, lets say 3B FCF this is 10% of enterprise value per year. Do you have any idea how cheap company actually is? So merger will just put this valuation much much higher. Why do you think Burry bought it? Its a safe play, how much more this can go down? Its already by all metrics very very down. This is time to buy, merger will happen i dont know if you see but they are already preparing cash for it, someone ask why they dont BB shares, well here is your answer. They are spending on more for Disvocery plus which is gona be massive cash machine. Wait until end of the year when disc start going up and up and up, and then merger happen and you gona see 40-50 dollars."

Mr. Warren Buffett appears to be on board. Hoooo-wahhhh!
very sad situation
just mute John
MGM with 1.5B in revenue sold for 8.45 billion.Reese Witherspoon's production company with revenue of a measly 26 million just sold for 900mm.Disca has about 11 Billion in revenue and an enterprise value of about 23B. Go figure.
"This stock is Warner- Discovery. When you buy it you are looking at what it will be. I do not have a pro format and if anyone has one, please share. Disc is the tail of the dog Warner. The pro format assets are mostly Warner. The earnings reports of Disc do not show the future. Is D + W less than WD? There must be a junior analyst at GS that has presented reports to an MP."
Time to cover!
"If you look to $disca and $t you can see they pop at same time, broken the down trend and same time. Need to be something about the merge."
"I am frustrated but I will hold because eventually, 27 million shorted shares must cover, period."
panic buying
"Green indexes, bull day, friday & expiration date. Short head will be punished"
Recent longs look at how far it dropped from not real prices and think that means it’s a value. But discovery’s profitable businesses are dying. And it’s growth biz is super late to a crowded marketplace with thin margins. Learn the biz people. God bless.
￼Putting in my order is under 19. Looking for a big move down.
"Once 2-hr RSI goes over 30.00, shorts will cover."
Just one point though. Sid - I share your hope for this stock and believe it will continue to rise now. But volume had and has zero to do with the recent downward movement. The volume is extremely light today too.
Remember when an earlier crop of longs laughed at the banks when they were forced to sell in mid-40s?? I guess the banks are laughing now.
people should take notice with the panic buying in the past 2 trading sessions. This tells me the stock is in the bottoming process and the downside is very limited. Do your own DD.
Very undervalued stock

"Just bought more, becoming my biggest position. I am fine with the risk, i dont know how much further it can go, but we are getting pretty close. Have fun guys. I will laugh at some of you guys in the same way when i was talking about nokia under 4 dollars 6 months ago. Same think here, same situation but cheaper."
"Gunnar Wiedenfels - Chief Financial Officer stated ""As indicated, when we announced our transaction with WarnerMedia, we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter, as we continue to invest in our next-generation initiatives and conserve cash ahead of the closing of the deal"" I really think the Board of Directors and Gunnar are showing weakness by not reinstating share repurchase program. Discovery can achieve equity financing if they show confidence in the assets they believe in.With the merger they will save 3 billion in synergies. Plus Discovery should convert under performing assets to cash. Discovery sold Great American Country network which contributed .09 cents towards earnings this quarter. The Board of Directors are their to look after the long time shareholders. If Discovery is willing to support its shareholders , the asset will go up. The blocks of shares were sold at $32.50 and $42.00 because of the Archegos positions The bank put 19 million class A shares and 22 million class C shares which as been absorbed."
FYI prospective or new longs: Sid has been saying the “shorts will cover” for 3 months.
Gene and other longs. I do wish you luck. I’m on your side for the moment. But please tell me: why would anyone buy this when they can buy an alternative dividend paying equity (T) that is actually DOWN YOY and provides a stake in the growth part of this equation.
"The downtrend was established at the level of 28.77, when it is broken, I expect a sharp push up! the rsi is in an uptrend.it will be a bomb."

A shares are STILL up 9 percent vs prior year. Bubbles warp minds.
"Remember trust the process. When something is cheap it will not stay cheap for a long time, i also checked short % and is pretty high."
It is truly remarkable that A shares are STILL above 28. Near non Archegos highs and it’s trading as if there weren’t 40 percent fewer HHs with cable than 7 years ago.
"I wish wish wish I was and am wrong on this but I have not been. DISC remains a company whose ONLY profits come from dying parts of its business. It is positioning itself as a growth play with no road to profitability on that front. Plus even if you believe in the growth part of this equation you can just buy T and collect a divvy while you wait. T: a company that is actually down 10 percent YOY, not up 17 percent like DISC. Nobody has ever explained to me why I am wrong. Goodnight."
"Wow, Ortex shows there are still 33 million (MILLION!) short shares in this beaten-down stock. When will all those shorts cover?"

This stock makes me depressed.
"The market will correct. Sometimes it takes time but valuations tend to matter eventually. This will see the 40s again within the next six months, in my honest, non-financial advice opinion."
Ok we have held 28 for 15 minutes and are at 28.05 (a shares). We *should* jump up now. I'm holding regardless. I think we made it through the fire. Good luck.
If we can get above 28 we should have a nice little bump. Let us see.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa how is this possible?

Why is this getting so strong again?
"Halfway thru the day, and volume only 1.7M shares. Do shorts understand that earnings are tomorrow AM?"
I’m more disappointed than most of ya longs. I closed my biggest short in 6 years with a 6 percent gain. Would be up 22 percent now. Thought I’d get a chance to short again over 30. But this might not hit 30 ever agai. So frustrated

Frustrating to see exactly what I thought would happen to this stock happen. Even with a bubbly market. I covered too soon. This company is a bundle of risk with no dividend. I hope I’m wrong and this surges but I see more red tomorrow.
bought more :p

When a stock has ZERO reason to rise it sometimes just sometimes does not rise. Even in a bubbly market like this.
"Discovery announced quarterly results that beat expectations with its headline numbers, including revenues that rose 21% to $3.06B. However, shares fell as market watchers focused on the company's streaming efforts, which merely met expectations with 17M paying customers as of the end of the quarter. However, RBC is staying bullish, with a price target of $52 now implying 88% upside. Subscribers were in line with its expectations. And stronger free cash flow generation offers upside to the transaction's leverage profile. Wells Fargo has a $46 price target stated today. Plus, Discovery exploring takeover bid for UK's Channel 4, which will increase revenues substantially. They sold Great American Country network, which increased their earnings an additional .09 cents in their recent quarter. We should see some upgrades this week. Channel 4 said its revenues were 934 million pounds, Discovery should get a good buck for it."
This is starting to look like my worst investment ever made. Not even a proper bounce since the fall from the 80's. Amazing how bad this is going.

Someone please tell me why anyone would buy this when an alternative divvy paying equity exists that gives you almost the same reward potential with much less risk. I have been waiting since merger announcement for someone to tell me.
There was heavy blocks of selling today at two levels: 27.20 and then later on at 26.85. This is going to close near the lows even as market has fully rebounded. Another winning day for those with short positions. I don’t see this reversing in the near term.
"don't be surprised if DiscA takes a hit tomorrow ..even if revs/earnings are good ..be prepared ...btw, I muted John ..he's irrelevant ..I suggest you do the same"
Remember: DISC is still UP 10 percent YOY. The runway down is lonnnnngggg for companies who were super late to the streaming game and whose every dollar of profit comes from slowly dying businesses.
Markets back big from lows of day. DISC at lows of day. On strong volume.
Zero. Point. Zero reasons to buy this in the short term. And even longs (now mostly and soon to be former longs) know this. Bloody days ahead. Buy T instead. Nice rhyme for ya.
This closed at day/week/month/2021 lows today. But A shares are STILL at historically high prices - prices this traded at when 40M more us households had cable. All bets are off as to the downside here. But but but. At least now you can buy at relatively “normal” prices.
soon 35
Volume today could be at a record low.
Does any sensible person know what the Poland decision means for Discovery? Will this have a negative impact on future earnings? or will they just give back control (sell) the rights and concentrate on the rest of the world?
"So increadbly easy to munipulate this stock. Take it down to $26, run it back up to $28, then down to $26 again. Can get sleepy just watching this action."
"banksters that bought this at the top are now selling calls and buying putsthen smash price selling their DISC inventory , then they will buy calls at the lowand wait for price to come back to actual value.we need law and order on wall st all our pensions are at risk as they get richer and richer"
"According to Fintel, the Short Squeeze Score for DISCA is currently higher than 93.7% of all 9,141 stocks covered by Fintel."
"remember the saying, people ..""content is king"" ..and oh boy, does Discovery, and will Time Warner/Discovery, have content!"
once again David Zaslav speaks and the stock goes down.
6% down on a good report?
"Morgan Stanley bought another 500,000 shares."
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Thetraderguide.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
"Still shaking my head over this one. Since the merger, it's down almost 20%. If you believe the pundits (and I do) this stock has 50% upside in 9 months. There is nothing out there that has anywhere near this much potential. And people are selling? I'm wishing I could buy more but I have so much already. It a shame. Fail to see any reasoning for selling this stock here."
"This is what I found in seeking Alpha:While possibly dead money for a year, Discovery is my favorite media name for the next five.The combination of AT&T’s WarnerMedia and Discovery creates a streaming giant with more content than Netflix.Malone is the Warren Buffett of the media world. The next decade at Discovery could be similar to what he did with Charter Communications (stock up 4.5x in 8 years).HOLD TIGHT TO YOUR SHARES..AND DO YOUR OWN DD."
"I'm a long term stock picker and been investing for almost a decade, not even a hype guy. But if this literally doubles-triples in 18-24 months, I wouldn't be surprised."
"Bullish option flow detected in Discovery with 13,401 calls trading, 1.1x expected, and implied vol increasing almost 2 points to 50.15%. Jan-23 30 calls and Jan-22 50 calls are the most active options, with total volume in those strikes near 7,400 contracts. The Put/Call Ratio is 0.07. Earnings are expected on August 3rd."
2:40pm. NASD is down 0.45 percent. DISC (a shares) are down 10x that.
Now imagine what will happen to this if the market actually goes down by more than 0.3 percent. I been looking out for prospective longs since $34.
I cannot imagine that shorts can hold it for too ling. what is the benefit for them?
"Well i just increased my position almost 800M in FCF in one Q. Yes Operating expenses were higher but that was expected. This is very cheap stock, this remind me on DBX under 20, very undervalue. I have no idea why stock went down so huge but i just bought it at 27 and is starting to be on of my biggest position in portofolio. I am here for long run, minimum 12 months from here, meaby even more. This id gona be huhe turnarround story."
Told you chasers to wait til end of trading day if you wanted to chase. I still would stay very far away from a long position here. All risk. No dividend. No reward.
Absolutely WILD that this #$%$ is still somehow above 28 Bc of a market that never goes down. This is a 20 dollar stock In a dying biz w no divvy and tremendous risk ahead. This is why I will not mess shorting this again until it gets to 31/32.
Nobody is PUSHING this down. Shorts already have won. This is going down Bc this an insanely overvalued bundle of risk in a dying industry. And if you believe in the potential of the merger you can buy T.
HBO Max will be cash cow. Prepare for Oct - Nov. rally when it goes live
"Green week, going to 30 32.5 (big option volumes at 17 sep)"
"Many ""streamers"" are up today: $AMC, $VIAC, $DISCA, $LGF-A, $CHTR, $NFLX, $CMCSA and don't forget good ol' $ROKU"
Everyone on here is now short DISCA. I wonder what that suggests about what's coming next.
"This stock traded between $18-32 in the five years before covid. It was in a secular decline before the pandemic because of the macro trends in its industry, namely core cutting. Archegos artificially pumped it to near $80. But that wasnt real. Low 30s are the REAL 6 or 7 year high for this stock (talking about A shares)."
"Wow, Ortex says 33.77 million shorts shares in DISCA, while daily volume averaging only 4+ million. That's a lot of days-to-cover."
Way oversold - bought more. GLTA
Reminder that A shares are still up 3.80 or 17 percent vs. last year. And this is happening when markets are near ATH’s. Plenty of runway down. BUY T.
"Volume is now so ridiculously low, shorts in DISCA are effectively trapped. This stock is incredibly ripe for a $2 - $3 upward squeeze. Regardless of all other factors, for that reason alone, I will HODL."
"On TD Ameritrade, no change tonite. DISCA keeps TipRanks score of ""8"" on scale of 1 - 10:Smart Scoretiprank right arrowPowered bytipranks logoThe Smart Score combines eight factors to provide a single TipRanks rating.

Michael Burry also bought about 800k shares at 27.* price.It just can't be that bad)). I hope we will see 28 after conf call.Wish you good weekend 
"Discovery Hits 18M Paying Streaming Subs, U.S. Ad Revenue Jumps 12 PercentThe company, led by CEO David Zaslav, posted its second-quarter results."
Stand by for lows. Remember: it’s nice to listen to all the cheerleaders but listening to me has saved you money.
Markets are going higher and higher today. DISCA going lower and lower. I am so jealous of the shorts that held.
33M short shares can't cover (volume is way too low) so they just keep shorting instead.
"John, John???????????"
Two-hour RSI is finally back over 30.00 and pointing up....
(http://Stocks-tracker.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
"well, are the sales over? let's go up!"
"DISCA being pushed down, just like VIAC was until Tuesday around noon. And we all know how that ended for the shorts."
Revenue up21% over the prior-year quarter and earnings per share hit $1.01 comfortably beating analyst's estimate of $0.85. Stock fell 6%. Thank you for letting me buy more at dirt cheap!
This is stock is at a 8.03 FWD P/E. It is now DOWN 19% YTD. And is down 25% from pre pandemic lows.

"Sept 8 (Reuters) - The HBO Max streaming service will be available in six European countries on Oct. 26 and will launch in 14 additional territories next year, AT&T T- owned WarnerMedia said on Wednesday.The service will be available in Spain, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Andorra and will include films and series such as ""Harry Potter,"" ""Game of Thrones"" and ""The Big Bang Theory."" The company will announce pricing and additional content details in October.Streaming services are expanding overseas in a bid to grow subscribers as the U.S. market slows. Being early to market is important because of the widely held view that consumers will subscribe to several - but not all - available streaming services.Europe is WarnerMedia's second international rollout of HBO Max, which debuted in the United States last year. In June it launched in 39 territories in Latin America and the Caribbean, where the company is selling two subscription plans, starting at $3 per month.In July WarnerMedia Chief Executive Jason Kilar told Reuters that HBO Max subscriber growth in Latin America will exceed the absolute number of subscriber additions in the U.S. market over the second half of this year and that he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if that trend persists into 2022.On a call with analysts the same day, AT&T raised its forecast for global HBO Max subscribers to between 70 million and 73 million by the end of the year. It previously expected 67 million to 70 million subscribers. nL4N2OY1V5The service's expansion comes as AT&T is preparing to close a deal to combine its media content with Discovery DISCA and focus on its original business of providing phone and internet services."

"Why this look exactly like nokia 6 months ago, and DBX 1 year ago. Same think happen, many bears bashing it, laughing at me, telling me i am delusional and bam 50%+ on both stocks after that and all of them were gone after. Never soon them again. Guys if you are not adding at this lvl and reducing your cost base, you must be clueless. Go check last Q, check FCF check forecast, and then check valuation. Trust me, dont forget what i said. Put this stock in your portofolio trust me. See ya in 6 months."
DISC is an absolutely brutal position because every single dollar of profit right now is declining (advertising and carriage fees). Streaming - even if successful - is Incredibly low margin with ZERO carriage fees from telcos that now make up 30-40 percent of DISC operating profit.One day you folks will understand. Until then you can laugh at me and keep stealing shares.
"And this is happening when the markets are GREEN. like I said, this is going to get bloody when the markets pull back even a bit. There is zero reason to own this. Literally ZERO."
"I never, ever sell into record low volume, especially when nearly all transactions are through shorting, like on Wednesday."
Got my order in for 26.45. Looks like a good short term trading opportunity to me.
"How can 31.6 million short shares ever cover, when daily volume is recently averaging around 3 million shares? Anyone?"
"I know a lot of stocks can say this, but this dropped 10 percent in a week from already low prices for no reason (that we know of). I have a 29 and change average now. I'm discouraged at the moment, but I have to believe we will rise again soon. Maybe the after work beers have helped ease my sadness from looking at this stock."
this is a bad joke
"they have bough 60000 contract on 2023 Jan for 7 bucks. somebody knows something that we do not know . I got some 30 dollars call for jan 2022 .this stock won t stay in this prices , it will go higher"
Is this a buy or should I wait for 20?
Seems like Monday could show some higher volume before earnings. Hope we go $31+
when short heads will be punished ? )>50% day volume shorts

Also buy/sell volumes was 50/50. All sold stock was purchased. And volume was 6.58 > 5.63 mln avg
"This makes no sense but is good u will put little bit more money into it, this will be 70 dollar stock and FCF is amazing so nothing to fear here. Sometime market is not logical"
Earnings Alert
Where are the cheerleaders???? Sorry boys and girls. This was the easiest short in the market when merger was announced.
This is not up 15 percent from covid low. It’s up 15 percent from September 10 2020. This is currently double the covid low.
false breakdown. we'll see what happens tomorrow. hello shorties
Record low volume today.
Surging Higher
shorties are in trouble!
Daddy is happy
"you are going the right way, comrades! going to> 30!!haha"
"This is a textbook turnaround that began yesterday, continued VERY strong today and *should* continue for the next few days and weeks. Feeling positive about this one for the first time in a long time. Good luck longs."
The vsco spinoff from bbwi has unleashed billions of hidden market cap. Disck and T spinoff combined value will unleash billions of dollars in the new Company. I cannot wait until this combined monster is fairly valued in the galaxy of NTFLX valuation metrics.
Quicksand. Who wants to be 43B in debt. Are the Board or Directors of DISCA sure they want this deal?
Please oh please. Will someone tell me why any sane investor should buy this when they can buy T and have exposure to NewCo PLUS a divvy?? I’m seriously seriously seriously at a loss.
I’ve seen wave of wave of fresh faced longs “steal” shares for months. They are mostly gone. Smartly bailed weeks ago. Welcome optimistic and wide eyed new longs.
Premarket says -2%. What a shame this stock never benefits from markets rebounds but also never miss the opportunity to plunge when the markets fall down :/
The market is giving the smart money the last chance to load on the cheap. An excellent contrerian and long term play.
"The volume speaks for itself, looks like a reversal... the bottom has been reached. GL longs!"

Tremendous selling. Constant. Huge blocks. A short’s dream.
"Something brewing behind the scenes :)! Very nice... I really like to see short sellers now... Maybe this will hit 40+! Mind you , this was a 70+ stock not long ago..."
massive million dollar sweeps coming in today
Disc still UP 16 percent YOY. T is DOWN 8 percent. No reason for disc to be up so much more than T.
"brutal day, but strong finish?"
Remember: DISC is STILL up more than 10 percent YOY. There is STILL lots of runway down for a legacy cable provider who is losing 50 percent of its operating cash flow in the shift to streaming (no carriage fees in streaming).
Any news come out related to this pop?
"Social media star David Dobrik is back—now with his own TV show.Dobrik has a landed a deal with Discovery+, the streaming service owned by the parent company of the Discovery Channel, to film a travel series starring himself and several returning castmastes from his YouTube channel. The program, Discovering David Dobrik, will debut later this year in a 10-episode run.Dobrik landed at No. 9 on Forbes’ 2020 list of the top-earning YouTubers, bringing in an estimated $15.5 million. On Discovery+, Dobrik will join homey fare from networks like HGTV and the Food Networks as well as series from the company’s core offering, the Discovery Channel; Dobrik’s show is, presumably, a gambit to find content to draw in younger audiences who are more used to their entertainment coming from YouTube or TikTok videos than full-length TV shows. The streaming service launched in January and had accumulated 18 million subscribers through August.(via @Forbes)"
Longs played muscle on Monday.Shorts played muscle on WednesdayPreparing the Epic battle before the earnings.
Is this stock ever going to go up??? What a disaster for my portfolio. Oh well.
2021.08.30_Monday_14:41 EDT - I think that the trade is halted since 14:25 EDT today.
If you didn’t watch this today you should. The long term prospects look great and Gunnar explains it well. Watch it. Shorts time is short. https://ir.corporate.discovery.com/news-and-events/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/Discovery-Chief-Financial-Officer-Gunnar-Wiedenfels-To-Present-At-The-Bank-of-America-Securities-Media-Communications--Entertainment-Conference/default.aspx
The drop makes no sense. Anyone knows what is the short sellers % is?
Another possible prospect is the advantage of DISCB Voting shares will be held in equal value come merger so trade them up before value shrinks
"Good posts by Edward. Looks like a lot of big money recently buying this stock: Seizert Capital Partners, Sterling Investment Management and Hillman Capital."
"I've yet to hear a plausible explanation from shorts, as to how 33M short shares cover when daily total volume is now hovering in the 3-4M range. Not mathematically possible, without causing a major spike in price."
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"I have the proof on ThinkorSwim that Citadel automatically moves DISCA against retail traders' big buys. Stop this now, or Sec. Gensler gets a letter, with all my evidentiary proof, by Friday."
"Because money is buying overseas stocks now. Buy TiGR, it’s a Singapore favorite."
Finally got in at a value price for a long term position. I don’t care what it does in the short term as there’s too much value in this stock. Easy 2-3 bagger here in 12-18 months - GLTA
I must have the most incredible form of dementia ever invented to predict a stock’s movement with such precision. Maybe I’m like rain man? Keep chasing folks!!
The Nasdaq is currently (barely) green. But still green. Imagine what will happen here when NASD pulls back.
Stock down 10% YTD. Shorts with short attention span think there is still meat on bone. This is primed for the longs!!!
"Do you believe that the ""newco"" may become a meme stock?"
"The 20 fifteen-minute Moving Average has finally crossed above the 50 fifteen-minute Moving Average. This has been a very bullish sign for DISCA in the past, at least for the following 2-3 days."
Looks like 29 is inevitable today
On the surface this was a brutal day but that was the strongest close I've seen in a long time. I am strangely optimistic about the rest of this week.
Sid - you have been predicting the downfall of shorts and DISC for 3 months. They have won almost every single day. I hope one day you are right so I can short again. But I just don’t see how this can rise in near term.
"I'm going to be easier on John, being a dementia patient must be difficult as it is, poor old man is clearly in cognitive decline."
"Great earnings report. At $1 per quarter and current price I'm looking at a forward P/E of 6. Anyone have a good explanation of why the stock is down over 4%? Maybe the ""virus""? That's the explanation for my grocery store to be out of water chestnuts"
The stock that keeps on giving.Hard to believe this over over $65 this year.
Bring this puppy back to 79!
good day! I'm looking forward to tomorrow. I hope tomorrow the shorties will be broken!

"There is one problem with netflix in coming year and that is content. When all of them stop selling content to netflix and that is gona be soon, you will see explodion at disca. Imagine what gona happen with netflix then? Btw content they are having is pure garbage that why most of my friends cancelled netflix, same us me. Nothing to watch, when Disney +, discovery + and future NEWCOMP will have content liberty for years to come. Most importnat metric for discovery is FCF right now and it look amazing, that why we aee buying at this lvl, burry is buying and all smart money is adding slowly. It is cheap, you dont generate 800M in FCF last Q for nothing. Merger will happen and then you will see explodion, now is time to add."
last day to cover shorts!
"Capco Asset Management, LLC buys Discovery Inc (New Position)"

"The huge moves yesterday & today have been in DISCK, which dropped 17.87% from yesterday's high, whereas DISCA, which historically has been more volatile, dropped 12.92% in sympathy. As DISCK is still trading at a discount, it is the share class to buy as all Discovery share classes will be combined when the merger with Warner Media becomes effective."
John Malone is getting the same deal as other shareholders. Despite the fact that his shares have 10 votes and trade at like 60 bucks a share he will get the same as every other class of shareholder. Says something.
Could be details imminent on the Warner Discovery deal. It’s about time.
