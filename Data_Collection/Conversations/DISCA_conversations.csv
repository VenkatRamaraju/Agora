HODL!! Little to no downside at this price ($23.50) At some point price will catch up with fundamentals and this will March upwards instead of downwards. There may be a large buyer or multiple large buyers and this will take off. If all of a sudden there were little to no sellers the price would start moving up immediately but everyone has to do what’s best them. As for me I’m building a mammoth position for my portfolio and I plan Not to sell any until it’s at least over $50 (unless fundamentals change). GLTA longs.
Nice price action today. Not too many people were willing to sell their stock below $24 or $25 and the price moved up. A couple more days like this and buyers should raise the price further. It’s a self fulfilling proficiency. GLTA longs.

"MANIPULATION is out of your control.. JOLD TIGHT, SAVE MONEY TO BUY LOW, AVERAGE DOWN.. Patiently wait..."
"Given the split of 71/29 and market cap split of Warner to Discovery, the stock DISCK equates 1:1 to Newco stock and is thus the same as buying NewCo before the merger. That is not something I have ever seen before. All the other times you had to wait until the merger to get the NewCo, but not this time. It's truly unique and by next year people will kick themselves for not understanding why they should have been buying this stock. But the catch is that the merger price for NewCo. It's based on Warner + Discovery. That is basically 25% of T + Discovery. So the starting price is mainly determined by T's stock price. Mathematical NewCo can't trade below T's price at merger time. So DISCK is undervalued as NewCo will trade above the T price on the day of the merger. (T is $25.50 right now and that is the DISCK floor.)Given the Merger will trade like an IPO for NewCo, it's possible that DISCK trades above the NewCo price because the only way to get NewCO is to own DISCA,B,K or T the day before the merger. You won't be able to buy in the first hour for less than NewCo +25% as the stock will get a strong bid pre-market. There absolutely won't be any selling pressure from T owners who now have NewCo. I know something about this because I have owned T for 25 years. A T stock owner is so desperate for a capital gain that there is zero chance any T owner sells their NewCo. Seriously, are you kidding? We get to finally monetize Warner and people think we will sell? No way! All the risk averse dividend grannies have sold and the grannies that are left want some capital gains action! People who are talking about selling pressure are not current T owners. They don't know what it's like to own a stock for 25 yrs that never goes up. NewCo is our one chance to experience a capital gain, so you won't get a single share from me and that's the more realistic scenario. Good luck getting any NewCo shares from any T owner on day #1. (71% of the float will be in T owner hands on day #1). My financial advisor has a few million dollars in T shares in client hands and he has told me that not a single customer of his wants to sell their NewCo shares when they get them. They rode the old horse this far, so why would they sell before it goes up."
I have been averaging down. My last purchase was 23.41. On 11/14 this will be a new annual low price. Is the upcoming deal this bad ?
Sorry longs. It’s still up $4 vs. last year with no dividend or buyout prospects. It’s positioned itself as a growth stock but it has no growth. People are scared about this ER.
"So, the streaming business sucks, except for NFLX. I think it's more to do with momentum buying and selling. Earnings will set things straight either way. Warner Media earnings looked good, so I""m leaning to the plus side."
"HOLD TIGHT, DO NOOT SELL.. Wllst the Vegas House is trying to squeeze you guys to part/sell your shares to them for dirt cheap.. Don't give into nonsense misleading NARRATIVES, scare tactics, pains.. Don't take margins more than what your means, do not shart (if you are little guy)..ATT, DISCA very valuable, NFLX TR@SH OVERVALUED at $300 BILLION.. But yes, I agree with Wllst, ATT DISCA has to deliver, monetize, run efficiently, have a GROWTH LONGTERM PLAN. They do have the size, KING-MAKER ASSETS to dethrone NFLX.. Have to put talents in the right positions, have a plan, follow through.. Also important, not to have sabotaging moles of Wllst Gamblers within your company.."
Lol I looked at this and I was like hmm lemme try and figure out why it dropped again see if I want to buy more. All I can come up with is another law firm investigating them and on quick research only reason I could find was whether or not the merger wasn’t in the best interest of shareholders. I suggest everyone do the same thing I’m about to do and research a little more to see if there’s anything else cause if that’s it I’m about to load up on call options.
"you can argue with me, you can dislike me, you are just afraid to accept the truth. look at the weekly chart first, then the daily chart, what do you see there? I see an endless downtrend with no end in sight. do you think that the stock will quickly turn around and fly to 50? ... lol ... just ridiculous, this will not happen. look again at the chart, at the volumes of sales and purchases, there are many times more sales, there are almost no purchases at all. this suggests that institutional investors are not interested in this action at all. of course I also suffer and understand that I made a big mistake to buy this stock and now I understand that my money is frozen for a long period and this is sad. 50 will never be possible, this is not a stock that can grow so much, do not look at last year, it does not count, look at all the previous years, there is no growth at all."
"Can someone explain why this stock does not respond to very positive news about the future of Warner Media; namely the Dune release and WM executives bullish comments about sequels to that franchise as well as the Matrix and Sopranos franchises? I understand the merger is still a ways off but since the market is attributing to Discovery absolutely no value to WM and HBO etc, you would think the Dune success would suggest some and the market would respond."
"DISCK MC is currently trading at 6.28 x 2023 FCF and 3.77 x EBITA. Does this make any sense? No. Especially when you consider the IP they will own with Discovery, HBO and Warner Bros. I’m taking advantage and adding today. I’m also adding a trading position to take advantage of irrational price drops like today. GLTA longs."
"Long 30,000 at near 28. This has crushed my performance over the past 6 months. Will stay patient. I went through the same ups and down with VIAC and AMCX eventually doing very well on both."
"I built a DCF model without considering the spectacular fantastic merger. Supposing a discount rate of 16% (crazy, it should be around 10% currently) the company is anyway 30% discounted . Mr Market is anything but smart at the moment with this stock"
"Data providers show 506M shares outstanding for all Discovery share classes. This means, if you use the share price of classes C or A, the company market capitalization is valued by the market at 12.3 billion dollars. Since Discovery shareholders will get 29% of Time Warner + Discovery, this implies the market only values the New Co. at 42 billion dollars. This looks like a very nonsensical and crazy cheap valuation for Warner + Discovery if you get into new co's capital by buying Discovery A or C share classes. I'm already in and thinking I might add even further if it keeps goin down. If data providers are correct and the deal goes through, I can't see where it can go wrong. If the deal fails, Discovery gets 1.7 billion dollars from AT&T which is a huge cash inflow. I can't see the deal being rejected, Discovery is small, and Warner would be spun off of giant AT&T."
Picked up a batch of shares at yesterday's close for 23.68. Should be a good investment from here!
FYI. People were saying little downside on A shares at 32/30/28/26. I was here. I remember. There is always potential downside. Particularly with markets at records.
"DISC A shares have never risen above mid 30s EVER, even in the heyday of cable tv when 20 million more households had it. I feel bad for those whose saw the Archegos manipulated prices of early 2021 and thought that $30 was some kind of huge discount."
"Discovery 3rd Quarter Results will be released on Wed 3rd Nov at 7am ET, followed by an Earnings Call at 8am ET.In the 2 weeks before the 2nd Quarter Results were released on 3rd Aug, DISCK spiked up 19.25% from its then yearly low, as short sellers covered their positions. The DISCA gain was 15.96%.I expect a similar spike in the coming days, with DISCK possibly peaking above #$%$28.https://ir.corporate.discovery.com/news-and-events/financial-news/default.aspx"
