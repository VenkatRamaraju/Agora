"MCBS disappointed in 2020.It earned $1.42 from $8.49 per share book at year end 2019.Too, 14% ROE is not bad but much lower than the 28%?average of the three previous year.Rates are up this year which helps interest spread and valuation of its service asset. But mortgage production and secondary margin will suffer.It held onto 82% of the $484 million mortgage loans production during 2020.These are low yield loans and will lose value as rates go back up. I don’t understand.Shares are traded at around $15 while book value is $9.54.Not particularly attractive without earning visibility."

"IPO at $13.5 seemed to be on the cheap side. Book is $8.00 ($8.15 after IPO) and trailing ROE is 25.3%.MCBS has a mortgage banking business. It is more balanced than a typical SBA lender bank like CBBI. Besides, it has sizable operation providing SBA and mortgage loans services for third parties.SBA loan competition was fierce and drove down resale premium late last year. Premium recovered about half. Unlikely to recover fully. Growth into Florida holds some promise.Mortgage banking results dipped in 3Q on favorable interest rates and local condition. Odd. Moderate growth expected unless there is acquisition, which is hardly its style.ROE should remain above 20%.MCBS does not need the capital for organic growth, this IPO served to create a more robust market for existing shareholders."
"—MCBS ($17 on 5/24/21) was fully priced..IQ21 annualized ROE rebounded to 21.35%, it reported $0.51 earnings and book reached $9.95 per share.—Rates ratcheted up since late 2020 but 10-yr Treasury (1.6%) is still way below the spike of inflation rate. There seems more room for interest rates to move higher despite the Fed’s resistance..—Higher rates and the economic recovery are good for banks.The wild card is further implosion of bond market which may drag down the stock market, even slow the recovery. MCBS at $17 is a little precarious.(I have expected 15% growth last year. On hind sight, that was too optimistic even without the pandemic.)Banks should do fine but high multiple issues like MCBS tend to react to the stock market’s movement."
