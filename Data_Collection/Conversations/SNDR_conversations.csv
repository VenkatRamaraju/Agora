I hold quite a bit of SNDR... but I can't figure the recent up ticks. Anyone?
This is going towards 25-26 range
Why is this stock price continuing to fall?? It should be up with the other major carriers... I personally worked as a tanker driver for Schneider in 2003-2006. Loads were available day in day out. The sky was the limit for earnings. Unfortunately I had to move out of over the road driving due to a family issue. If not for that I still be driving for Schneider. Great company. The reason I invested as soon as stock was offered.
Always hearing good announcements with SNDR but seems to not translate into their earnings reports or share price just yet. May be awhile until we see that 27+ level again.
Back in at 26.50.... see you at 29.50....
Down to 27.03 on half average volume. I love SNDR. Buying again.
UP on over 3 1/2 times volume with a high ofalmost 29 !
Interesting bit of news.... But I'll take $30!https://www.americanbankingnews.com/2020/01/06/morgan-stanley-cuts-schneider-national-nysesndr-price-target-to-30-00.html
Great buying opportinity.. 22% upside!!! Argus target $109 and Wall St Journal $99!!! $ARCB recognized as most efficient and best supply chain logistics and trucking company!! Great Forward PE of 11!! Reporting excellent earnings results on Nov 2!!!$ODFL $KNX $SAIA $JBHT $LSTR $SNDR $MRTN $SNDR
I am encouraged by what happened a couple of weeks ago when the stock opened up on pretty good volume up a couple of bucks plus to a high of $8.32. One would have to think that there was a reason for that move !
Schneider National is up 5.15% to 25.92
Comparing this to other valuations of trucking companies like $ODFL and $SAIA $JBHT $SNDR and $KNX it seems like YELL trades super low considering the fleet/revenue
"Ok, so we had two great days, when does the run back to the red start? Can this stock get some long-term momentum going? Can the board approach a dividend increase? Let's go trucking folks."
"Common Sense, did you sell any yet? I just sold a handful of shares. I had some I bought at 20. Still holding some but decided it was time to take a little bit of profit."
"Big short holdings, are kidding? Dividend coming, PE is 12, been around 90 years,tons of work, can’t get enough drivers, safety award, I would not chance the opportunity this company has"
SNDR is on Wells Fargo's growth list. It is the only stock that has been added to the list since the start of the year.
27.82.... I could not resist to buy at such a price...
I'm a buyer here....should hit $26 by December. They have been getting creative and thinking outside the box when it comes to shipping intermodal boxes and you're going to see it start to pay off BIG TIME in the next two quarters of earnings. 6-month target $30-$35.
