"How Essex demonstrates culture in daily operations. Kudos to the CEO Michael J. Schall and his management team. It starts from the top as they say.RTV - rest to vest. You will see rental property managers at many properties doing nothing in the spirit of customer service.Garbage museum - Essex showcases overflowing garbage canisters as something they are proud of.24/7 radio station - Essex doesn't care if you hear your neighbors all day / night. You signed the lease and must embrace it.Remodeling - Fancy word for copying competitors. However, Essex falls short on anything. Process - It's amazing how their management boast they have process. On top of that the whole chain upto 4 layers believes what the reporting person is saying. There is no process. Blatant lies by Essex management has been caught red handed. Manage from the HQ - clueless and out of touch management is calls the shots without even knowing reality. Isn't this the management style from the 80's?HR - literal meaning is Harass Residents......and the list goes on and on.....Stop funding this business. Walk around their properties and you will see the zero accountability culture in action. Check out Irvine company properties. You will feel the difference in a second."
"The stock market drop over the past few days should recover at some point, but one point to note is that ESS has dropped far more than the S&P and institutional investors have started reducing their holdings. This is based on lack of fundamentals in this company that has borrowed cheaply to build a unsustainable portfolio of apartments. Their tactics to lure prospective residents and continuous story telling (aka lying) to the current residents about grand plans is coming to light. Other than a 3.10% yield this company has actually lost money for buy and hold investor. Why risk your money? Buy an index fund. ESS (Essex SteAlerS) don't deserve a dime of bond or equity money. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a massive turnover at this poorly managed company. What is the board waiting for? There is no originality nor efficient thinking at this company. You will be surprised by the mindless projects they do at their properties, none of which provide benefits to residents."
"Buying on weakness - what a misnomer. Typical Wall Street commentary by firms to support a stock which Essex is probably inkahoots with. Folks, Essex runs on lying and story telling. As analysts and investors you probably haven't dealt with them in daily life, but trust me from the CEO all the way to the lowest so called Management level, these guys breathe lies and excuses. They have no ownership and ability to even listen to customers. Ride the wave because when the tide turns soon and Schall walks away from his million dollar payday investors will be collecting few cents on the $.The worst CEO and company you will ever encounter."
"ESS will be the worst performing REIT in 2018. Watch this stock get some short term gains but long run you will loose. It's already down 30 points since the all time high. There is no basis for the PE to be similar to a tech company. I hope people don't think the market cap is going to be a $T given its valuation similar to AMZN, AAPL or MSFT. Folks the yield is lousy for the risk and flat stock price. You are far better off investing in AB or similar stocks."
"Out of touch bankers and analysts continue upgrading this company as if it is a gem. Inflated PE which should demand higher returns just doesn't line up. Risk free return is negative and the multiple is so much higher than some fast growing companies that ESS is over bought due to hype. Folks if ESS just does what is said it will do, they will be losing money. They have abandoned projects and cut out holding their side of the bargain at many properties. Renters - walk away. Many have been fooled and lied too and by walking away from this business you will send a strong signal to the management and lenders that money doesn't grow on trees. This business is built on pushing the can down the road at every instance they can get. These include lack of productive employees, abandoned projects, ignorance of paying customers, bureaucratic operations, a cozy management team removed from reality of service. I will stick to $160 in 10 weeks. There is no reason for the high financial ratios and multiples. This is a scheme that will eventually blow up when rates normalize."
"Yes on prop 10. Any person of character and empathy with deep pockets would come out and support yes on 10. However, Essex CEO Schall would rather see homeless encampments be built along highways and below underpasses rather than STOP feeding his greed. Essex is desperate for net income because 84% of it comes from ripping residents off high rents. Essex is no Wall Street darling. Analysts removed from reality who don't really care if you are on the streets ill continue hyping up a company that has borrowed heavily and continues to leave unsecured debt to feed its appetite for dividends that are NOT SUSTAINABLE. Instead of investing in the community Schall is interested in gouging and preventing sensible bills from being passed because he needs to maintain the inefficient operations and pocket money. He knows very well that Essex is on the edge and could be bankrupt if prop 10 passes. He has chosen to spend $2.4M on blocking the bill instead of putting it in completing projects. Folks, Essex Management has lied to lenders about property remodeling 5 years back and to date they have not even installed washer - dryers. Folks, time the board stopped supporting this CEO. $180 soon.....once prop 10 passes , bankruptcy for Essex."
"Enjoy the gains in the stock price. This is a result of Schall kicking the can down the road 3 years ago. Watch as operations costs pile up, properties start to fall apart and people walk away from this #$%$ business. Folks, Schalls directive as it plays out in the real world is for his management team to ignore common man. He has no clue on the lies and stories his management team (direct reports) tell customers daily. They cannot even see problems. I don't think Schall is capable via his management and employee base to even see garbage lying on the floor. Schall is blinded by cheap borrowing costs to fill his pockets with cash.Schall is trying to be the next Picasso by painting with multiple brushes and beautifying properties in turn making them look worse than before. Schall's inability in managing operations is visible daily in shoddy property maintenance across locations. Investors will wake up to reality now that Schall offers move in specials and actually needs to pay residents to renew leases. Watch the debt and payout ration creep up to unsustainable levels."
Essex Property Trust is down 8.95% to 251.07
"Salt and pepper...boom and bust...movers and shakers....the list goes on and on....but only the ESsex Stealers can be honored with the title ""dodgers and duckers"".....""L and L""Folks, CYA tactics are the norm. Is Essex really running a business or feeding money into lawyers pockets to prevent class action lawsuits? Bankers hours, do not talk to me attitudes, false promises....Even the board of directors don't seem to be accessible. Wonder is there is a physical wall surrounding the corporate office...â€¦?S&P 500 index forcing buying blindly with ignorance of facts in the real world."
"Essex is a dead stock and company for that matter. They may report good earnings but this is the last one you can expect. They pretty much have people leaving left and right. They have cut out basic expenses. This is another fancy profit making scheme folks. They cannot afford to pay the bills. This REIT should be put out of business. Their management team has no voice nor ability to know what today's millennial generation needs. Renters do not give business to the CEO who is basically building his own castles with an empire around him. Look at the tenure of the Board of Directors and Management team. Also, their new hires are not polished individuals either."
"YES ON PROP 10. Surprised the management team thinks the same way. Is there really and diversity and inclusiveness at Essex? The smartest of companies have replaced their CEO. Infact CEO's like Nooyi are even stepping down proactively to transfer the baton. Schall seems to be really wanting to drive ESS into the ground.Watch for restatements, abrupt exits. Everything catches up. A CEO in denial and out of touch with customers. The attitude will only change once there is a hard fall. Until then shareholder money is being pocketed via dividends which are not sustainable and cost cutting which will drive customers away. Chatter of a recession in Silicon valley is already happening."
"ESS valuation will drop like an asteroid when market realize they have been funding a business based on stories. The argument for $200 is real. I think it will fall to $160 once the fundamentals of this this business start coming out. Zero customer service, shady apartment operations, unfinished projects, lease language that not even Essex lawyers or property management personnel understand. Folks, Schall is CYA'ing his position so he can make millions before his retirement. This is typical of a CEO who will push stock prices high until he is riding the wave. There is no real reason to treat this stock special. In fact its a company disinterested in customer feedback. Their whole model runs on driving tenants out so they can start afresh with new residents and milk them until reality comes out."
ESS is up 5.26% to 276.52
"Classy story tellers taking investors to the cleaners. Folks the stock has no reason to move up. Wait and watch. Ethics will bite Essex at some point. CEO will walk away with millions. He's got nothing to loose. It's clearly visible in the shady practices he allows Essex to follow day to day. Properties have broken amenities, half completed projects, false promises of upgrades.....you name it. Essex is active in managing their image on Yelp and Apartments.com. There is someone who is just sitting around protecting the mediocracy. Look at the blocked reviews on Essex Property on Yelp. Look at the rating for the CEO. Worse than even a fast food or retail outlet."
"Folks Schall has basically doubled his income from the job from $2.2M to $4.6M while cutting back on overtime and provided mediocre service. Schall has also reduced capital expenditures far below the levels seen in previous years. This is not by choice but because he wants to maintain that payout. Vacant rental units are piling up no mater what he says on the earnings call. He is looking back at the quarter.So not only investors, residents or vendors should beware but I would think that even working for Essex is a losing proposition unless you basically have no desire. Dealing with Essex is worse than dealing with a Safeway or McDonald's or neighborhood business. Top down from Schall to the Regional Management to the property level you will hear unheard of excuses. Infact you will never hear from Schall. I wonder if his qualifications are even real.Show me one CEO in today's day and age who doesn't walk the talk. $180 soon whether you like it or not. discount for the Schall management track....you could be looking at a sub $150 stock in 6 months. Does the yield really matter if the principal is eroded?Stop and think. Wall Street is also blindly loading up with robo buying because of S&P 500 index inclusion."
"6.3% dividend increase at the cost of cutting costs, treating paying residents unfairly, lying about projects and the list goes on. By coalescing with companies like AUM (part of Real Page, RP) it's evident that the CEO only cares about filling his pockets and the investors who have given him a joy ride. Instead of putting money where it's needed the most, the ESS CEO and his team continue favoring what suits them. Investors - time to stop looking at the yield and payout and looking at the dealings of this company in the marketplace."
"The stock is coming to reality. Institutional investors who are on a robo buying spree are starting to lose money. This money is not theirs either. If they truly are held accountable to be fiduciaries, they should be dumping this inflated stock that is going to cut the dividend soon. Ego and support by a Chairman and Board of a CEO who lacks customer service skills. I don't think Schall cares how pathetic the employee behaviors are because he himself has setup poor service as something he is proud of. Residents the bug infested properties with mold and asbestos will strip you off your hard earned money. Small investors - don't invest in this money losing scheme. The institutional guys will cash out before you even notice.Watch for some restatements and adjustments in revenue as apartments are emptying out, staying vacant longer and"
"Forts, of course, was meant to be efforts.."
"Surprised there are more people on this post. I like the stock a lot. Granted there is exposure of the wackos on West coast with rent control, but adding more debt at these rates, for expansion, seems very prudent. You may have refinancing issues 20-30 years from now, but not a huge concern for me."
Occupancy is terrible and rent rates all along the west coast will be low for next 2years. Occupancy may return but rate definately wonâ€™t be there.. Iâ€™ll think of buying at 150
"Short term profit mentality is what drives this business and day to day decisions are made under the sole reason to maximize gains while short cutting properties owned and managed. Suppliers, vendors and contractors demand higher fees since the money is being pocketed by management at your cost. Residents, read the reviews and find better companies that are resident friendly and value your residency. Do not believe the lease clauses since Essex will not enforce. They pay their lawyers large sums to sit and watch on the sidelines while they continue breaking rules and operate lean which they are not setup to do. It's time S&P 500 removed them from the index."
ESS is down 4.99% to 301.14
"BS duo - you guys budget funds for each apartment you rent in order to maintain and keep it to standards. However, you have cockroaches, bugs and amenities from the 70's in many of your units that you are fleecing customers by charging $3000 per month. Where is the money going that you are keeping aside and claiming to maintain apartments you boast of owning?Residents- challenge the local manager and demand service or reimbursement. The BS duo has figured out a way to pocket profits from this strategy. Analysts - one would think you would put interests of the jobless first as a fiduciary duty and hold ESS accountable to standards. However, as typical Wall Street greedy investors all you care about it yield.Time to wake up and get ESS to come clean. Surprised lawyers are sitting on the sidelines when there is easy class action money to be made."
"The BS (Burkart-Schall) duo continue to be blinded by easy money that they cannot address items shown to them 3 years ago. Folks, these guys are literally faking it to shareholders, residents, customers, bankers, investors, contractors and the media. The BS duo has not ability to start projects on time, they continue to lie to rent paying customers and blame everyone except themselves. Their character and capabilities are displayed in Essex employee behavior, turnover and actions out in the real world. It will b interesting to see the spending binge they go on as the Fed eases. BS will focus on buybacks to boost the stock price up so wen the next earnings roll around they can show the meager EPS increases. Folks, there is no real profitability. By givie Essex a P/E multiple of a finance company, basically investors are missing the point that this company needs to invest capital in old dilapidated buildings across their portfolio. They have not done that and continue to borrow money under that pretext only to siphon it off into their deep pockets."
"Hey maddog. So this company is $100 off 52 week high. So question, I have for you as I see you know a bunch about Essex:Do you think the rents (income) is down due to unemployment or due to competition better place and/or cheaper? Aren't some of these renters ""kinda stuck"" in that their income prohibits them from affording to be able to go elsewhere. I don't know squat about Essex, but I bought a position in them $224 a share and I got the dividend by holding today."
based on my ownership of apartments I would guess it will be a good report. Also it is really hard to screw up an apartment building.
ESS is up 5.04% to 293.32
"Read the fine print in the earnings transcript. Lots of red flags. Unfinished property redevelopment, need to raise capital by diluting the stock. Bond holders beware. Doesn't look like previously borrowed money has resulted in a ROI that was promised. Lot of fluff about pricing and rent reduction due to market situation. Bottom line is that operations are inefficient and cutting costs, overtime pay and driving costs higher on renters. Stay away from this stock."

Don't fall for the short term blip today. There is no fundamental shift in the business model or operations. Markets are irrational. We all know it. Inclusion in S&P index automatically triggers funds to buy this run of the mill REIT. Apply logic and common sense instead of robo buying. There is a reason for the stock falling over the past 3 months and it is related to fundamentals. Don't get enamored by the short term gains because in the long term you will be left hanging with few cents on the $ and long term isn't that far out.
What have capital assets got to do with incompetence in management skills. Just because a company has high quality assets doesn't mean they have high quality ethics or day to day management. The discussion here is not about what Essex has purchased. It is their method of treating people and enforcing common sense. This management team chooses to ignore main street and continue filling their pockets and it's no surprise given their tenure. The Chairman and board are probably supporting this behavior as well.
"BS duo shenanigans continue while Bay Area apartment complexes empty out. Folks wait for the earnings and see your holdings get wiped out or prematurely get out. Essex has stopped showing how many apartments are vacant on their website. They know its bad but as usual these liars are capable of anything as you can see from their bully behavior to property mismanagement and lack of maintenance. They will do anything to pocket money because it feeds their best interest. There is a reason the Chairman of the board has left the puppet CEO in the role. He knows ethically Schall will always break the law.Folks, $500 off, 3 months free for new applicants. As usual Schall has no capability to deal with current residents nor has he ever had the decency. The long time residents are now voting with their $$$ and walking away. Get ready for some lawsuits."
There you go. Earnings released on 2/7. If Essex is really well positioned in strong markets as they claim to be wouldn't you expect some positivity and enthusiasm from this company's announcement. I think even holding onto cash would have made you money in 2017. Technically Essex has last money for investors in 2017. Look at the net income number. It's down 48%. Don't fall for the superficial FFO which basically allows Essex to capitalize on gimmicks. Make real estate transactions to show higher numbers. Folks they do not know how to operate. It's evident. They are hanging by a thread. Their CEO and management team has no desire other than pocket hefty stock option gains. Note: They have issued stock at the $260 level. Employees are already losing money working for Essex. Institutional investors far from Silicon Valley and Seattle metro area - Essex has 1799 employees. They claim to have revenue of $1.3B. That's $722k per employee. Really? Even high tech companies don't have that kind of revenue per employee nowadays. Essex's creativity in financial make believe is what is forcing funds to buy their stock. Being in the S&P index ties hands of money managers and drives auto buying. Trust me analysts are lagging in seeing the reality of this company. I have enjoyed the downward slide based on fundamentals. The next support level that ESS will break through in 10-12 weeks is $160. Sell sell sell. Surprised all analysts think alike. Isn't there a bold analyst who can see through this drama filled company?
"Folks, you are missing the point. Essex is a dump and it's time to dump their stock. Their board of directors seem to be as non caring as their CEO. I can't believe there is no contrarian analyst who sees the light at the end of the tunnel. Dilapidated properties, operations that can't fix a thing nor do a job that meets 1950's standards. Essex is taking investors on a ride. Tenants, residents, prospective tenants - you all probably have experience with car salesman. Essex management even beats car salesman in story telling. The lease - full of jargon to protect their shady business practices and unethical engagement. Essex will never respond in email or writing. They pay people to talk on the phone or plainly ignore anyone who contacts them. Folks, this is 2018. Is this the kind of business one needs in the world today? And analysts - really price target $277. Isn't real main street information on yelp, apartments dot com enough to make you learn about the management incompetence when it comes to daily operations?"
Missed rev missed eps lower guidance and increased industry risk and this rallies. Iâ€™m sorry for suckers who will get bagged
Anyone can low ball earnings and then create a hype by beating...because until the last day of the quarter they can eliminate fixing broken maintenance issues and buy time....they really don't have to deliver to the rent payers.....all they have to do it cater to bondholders.....the cheap money automatically keeps the stock high because of the yield.....don't forget recessions expose who is dancing naked....
"Another conference calls full of stories and moving money between pockets while denying reality of third class operations. Folks, these guys are borrowing cheap and will soon disappear calling in early retirement. They have no ability to sustain property maintenance or even deliver on promises. I am surprised lawyers are sitting idle on the sidelines watching this play out. Class action lawsuits is the way forward to stop this cheap borrowing, refinancing and catering to the elite in the tech sector and areas close to Facebook and Google and Apple. Basically, Essex is unable to compete on operations and maximize ROI from their holdings. All they do is craftily sell bonds, buy properties then destroy their value with zero customer service and move money around towards the end of a quarter to show a earnings beat. What a joke!"
"One would think customer feedback is crucial and the most valuable lever a business can use for its growth. However, Schall chooses to run the place by propping up the stock, gambling that the 10-yr yield continues to go low so his stock yield stands out. Folks, don't forget the bottom line. This is the most shameful business you will deal with ever. They will lie through their nose to pocket money at any cost. Even to the extent of protecting lies and promises just to make numbers.There is not one respectful person you will deal with in their management. This includes Schall's direct reports who boast of being in senior leadership. Enjoy the $300 price before the $100 price. Watching from the sidelines...."
ESS is up 7.79% to 252.36
Folks you can see the gimmicks and shenanigans in play. I wrote over 2 years ago Schall needs to raise money. This is exactly what he is doing....but read the fine print. He is diluting the base with new bond holders so tomorrow he can get away without paying anyone....by spreading his bets he is basically not liable to anyone....don't let him get away with such management. Good luck shareholders. You just got thrown into the don't care category as others are given priority in bankruptcy. I wonder if the money raised is actually going to be used to raise the standards and quality of apartments that Schall claims as a business model. Folk's these guys will show you fancy photos and put up their best show. Show the CEO and his team the door and take control of your investment. God luck. See you at $150.
There you have it. Covid covid covid. The CEO as usual has an excuse. And he sells properties so he can beat by a penny to keep his schmucks happy. Folks this guy has no ideas nor is he capable. Schall is riding it out just like others in the government. Essex is the most fd up company you will see out there. See you at $200. There is no cash flow. It's all being managed as a finance company and the yield is being supported to show its an attractive bet. Schall is like a tire salesman probably worse. Good luck holding onto a meager yield. 10 yr is at 1.65% and will soon hit 2% and go higher. The current admin has no clue about economics and is kicking the can down so they don't even have to see the ramifications since they all be dead and gone.
"With the events in the world unfolding beyond COVID, one would think that the shady business tactics of the Essex CEO and his team would stop. Instead as usual they have zero empathy or sympathy towards residents. They will give 1-3 months of rent off to bring in residents, allow them to smoke marijuana while turning the other way while continuing to harass current residents and force them to pay rents or go behind their unemployment checks and threaten them with collection agencies. What a shame. Isn't this racism and discrimination of another sort? Shouldn't the dividend be cut and Schall's salary be reduced first? What a Board and Chairman and other management team that continues to pocket at the expense of common man. Folks stage a walk out because that is the only way Schall will be fixed. The most shameful company out there."
Why has ESS delayed earnings release to Feb 7th? Something doesn't seem right here. If a company is well managed and seems to know what its doing they should be able to pre-announce ahead of the date which as Jan 31st to begin with. I won't be surprised if management is preparing to come out with bad news. Either way I don't see much upside. Don't fall for the yield or payout. Essex will do anything to maintain it instead of coming clean and cutting it to match with what one expects of a business i.e. invest in providing value to customers. Folks - lawyers and people with business backgrounds run this place. No wonder Essex is passing on costs and cutting services to pay the dry cleaning bills.Stop renting from Essex. Stop investing in Essex. Stop lending money to Essex. Watch for another 30-50% drop in the stock price in 10-12 weeks.
"Folks maintenance has quit. Yes quit. These are people who are sick of the bureaucracy and politics that the BS duo push down to property level. As usual the BS duo continue shirking customer contact, send their clueless so called management team to face paying customers. This company has no customer facing trained employee that you will come across. They have some office in SoCal under the customer service umbrella that supposedly fields calls and then assigns them to some RPM who in the first place is the cause of poor service. Folks, if it wasn't for the economy this company would be out of business. Schall knows it's easy money and is raking it in while the $10 per hour maintenance guy slogs and finally realizes this is a get rich management scheme at their cost. Keep buying while I pocket PUT premiums."
"On 12/20/2013, ESS cost $142.12/share while US10Y was nearing 3%. Yield back then was 3.4%.Today 04/19/2018, ESS costs $240/share while US10Y is at ~3% as well. The yield on this stock today is 2.9%.ESS will need to fall to near $200/share just to yield 3.4% as it did back then.With the Fed raising 25 basis points every 90 days, long term Fund rate at 3% double of what it is today and US10Y continuing its climb + 1year CD at 2%, this stock ESS, along with the rest AVB, AIV, MAA are going to continue to slide.My first limit order purchase is at $200/share. Who are the stupid people holding on to this stock at this price of $240/share today?I will see you there at $200/share in no time, certainly by end of 2018."
The fundamentals are out of line. The reality of this business is that is has bought revenue without understanding how to service the customer base. It is down by more than 15% YOY. This is not surprising given that there was no reason for it to move up in the first place. They need to spend over $100M to catch up to customer expectations. They have no ability to invest in a timely fashion. I see a lot of downside. I think the Board needs to clean up house and start with a new CEO and management team. All that Essex has done since 2011 is bought revenue and increased market cap. Their payout has not been significantly increased. Analysts should put a $100 price target on ESS.
"A close to 10% yielding stock few years ago driven to record high prices and meager yield without real understanding of the true shady management tactics used by Schall and his team. If you ever have the opportunity to converse with any of these guys you will be shocked to see the backward mentality, lack of empathy and true ability to listen. Folks, this is the only CEO who thinks he is above the social media laws of ignorance. His charter is clear - careless, supportive of mediocracy....folks since when was stock price the only measure of CEO success. The board and Chairman definitely love this guy since he is filling their deep pockets, but watch when the tide turns soon.....Schall will be dashing out like the Kentucky derby winner....Schall basically is managing one side of the balance sheet i.e. cut costs......he knows he is not competitive in making real income."
"I am not sure what the qualification of the analysts who follow this shady company are but folks, Barron's says it all today. The interest coverage is at 2.27. Well below 3 which is even considered risky. Now just imagine when there are lawsuits for negligence, mandatory spending for kicking the can down the road and eventual bankruptcy. I am sure these guys will disappear into hiding. Their newsletters and communication makes zero logic and sense. They don't even enforce basic hygiene at property level and they are boasting of going over and above in maintaining cleanliness. BS - stop lying and holed your VP's accountable who have no clue what your employees do in reality.Folks basically even with cheap money this company has not been able to maintain ratios that show they are making money. They are just playing with money from savers via the banking system. Surprised bankers are willing to ignore their financial ratios."
I own a lot of apartments and am close to 100% occupancy and delinquency is not bad. It is really hard to screw up apartment building. Think earnings will be good. Am accumulating here because it is so hard to buy buildings at reasonable prices.
Essex Property Trust is down 4.90% to 246.24
"Amazing to see Essex management pose for photos in front of project sites which are basically on borrowed money while leaving paying customers in the lurch. Folks, Essex management is an expert and gaming the system to their advantage. I think Schall is the only CEO who has no skills in people and customer relationship. I hope the new board members like Amal Johnson put an end to this #$%$ company management and bring some empathy because sooner or later this ponzi scheme led by a bully tactics and support of lying employees will blow up and investors will lose money. Get out of this stock that is down over 10% YOY while collecting a meager dividend yield. Folks you can do far better in the Treasury market. Don't waste hard earned money on a company with zero ethics in day to day dealings."
If you look at the financials the company is doing well. I have only owned ESS for 90 days and it has performed well. The dividend yield is fantastic. I think Iâ€™m going to put another 10k into ESS if it doesnâ€™t continue to perform I will sell in a year.
"Schall now that you will be rescued by the FED using American taxpayer money which you conveniently don't pay into due to your high income via dividends, when do you plan to reduce rents since your cost of doing business has gone to zero due to lack of working and zero maintenance. It's high time you step up and show some leadership specially in these times since you have pretty much been in hiding when your stock was rising and you showed arrogance to the common investor and customer?"
"Upgrades and lofty price targets. Wow---what a disconnect between reality and greed.Folks- I can't wait for $180. Schall is crafting an orchestrated buyback and when prop 10 passes he will blame it all on the changing laws. CBS kicked out their CEO and a lot of the management. Tesla board will turn over soon.The shenanigans at Essex continue....rampant bureaucracy, lying to customers and all sorts of unfinished projects with 10% vacancies piling up in the hot markets that Essex operates in. Of course a millennial analyst on Wall Street is far from the belt where the action is. It looks like a new generation is choosing to learn the hard way rather than from experience.The board will be scrambling soon to protect Schall....and do damage control...."
"Folks, the same excuses. Blame the world for your problems. As usual COVID is the cause of lower revenue. Schall has spent $225 per share to buy back stock in Q2. What a shame that the board allows such shenanigans instead of putting money to work for the customers who pay their salaries. If Schall is showing that he is a capitalist then I hope investors also show him by booting him out for such a poor show. YTD 30% lower than the S&P. Had Schall not purchased stock the drop would have been 50%. Crafty tactics are being used to keep tock price elevated. Money raised from bond sales has been blown up in smoke.Properties are junk houses. Surprised investors don't see the reality of this Ponzi scheme. See you at $140 or bankruptcy in 6 months. Fire sales will start since the cash from from OPS doesn't cover the fancy lifestyle and greed of the CEO and his people."
"Folks check out ESS employee reviews on Glassdoor. I am not surprised. It's as expected from Schall. Milk and skim at the top and give the short end of the stick to employees and residents. Folks, Schalls bogus ponzi scheme is all explained in the dropping cash flow and aggressive stock buyback to push the stock up. This scheme will soon blow up and you will be left hanging. Surprising Burkart and others continue accepting mediocracy at this company. Schall has no clue about customer service or solving issues at properties. He is the arrogant CEO who knows it all since he is playing with other people's money why would he want to be proactive in resolving issues. The cheapest CEO you will find when it comes to quality. Folks, stop paying the high rents in Silicon Valley and Seattle and start demanding service and empathy from this company and CEO who has zero character when it comes to treating residents with respect."
ESS is down 7.59% to 203.53
"Folks, 10Yr US Treasury yield has now surpassed this dead stock and company. You have the full faith of the US Government that will pay its share and protect investors before Schall or his team will even thing of residents and investors. Dump this money losing ponzi scheme that is inkahoots with the state, local agencies and is gouging hard working people to fill their pockets. This stock is a no growth no value stock. God forbid you have to deal with thus business in reality. You will be blown away by the callousness, excuses, lies and story telling. Essex + Schall = disaster in the making."
"I am sure many have listened to the earnings call or read the transcript. BS duo continue to story tell and lie as they do in day to day dealings with the people who pay them money. Folks Burkart is lying when it come to the following. There is no one accountable for ethics and customer service at Essex. Maybe it's time for George Marcus to step in and clean house. Turnover is due to raising rents without providing the service. Residents have read through the mentality of stealing by Essex. Folks, the BS duo cannot fix light bulbs for months. They are blind to the reality of operations. They take money from markets and abandon projects. They have veteran property mangers who have no clue on how to even speak to residents. Ask them to report property level metrics. It's a ghost town in the South Bay. Reid Square, 101 San Fernando, Brookside Oaks, Solstice....Well, as far as the rental increases, we are very focused on our customers being fair and -- in their entire experience, which of course, includes what they pay. So we typically will not raise rents above the marketplace. That's effectively set in the marketplace. As far as how low can turnover go, I would love to see it continue to go lower. I think what's driving the lower turnover at this point in time are a combination of factors, one of them being the fact that our assets are well located, of course, they always have been. So that hasn't changed but what does change is the quality of life in many of the metros. The traffic continues to increase and as it increases, it makes our assets better relatively than other options. So that is one angle.Another angle is we continue to focus on customer experience at the site, and we do have room to continue to improve that. We will continue to work on making all of our customers have the best experience possible. And finally, affordability overall, in all of our markets continues to improve, as incomes grows significantly faster than rents and so it's putting a lot less pressure on people to move for financial reasons, whether it's further away from their jobs or it's other areas. So I do think there's some continued room to run. I think it works best for both our customers and ourselves to have lower turnover. So we're pretty pleased with it.Lawsuits and investors walking away will only fix this old stodgy company rooted in unethical acts everyday."
"The decline has started. What Schall says on conference calls Vs reality in the market will quickly show up in the next earnings report. Also, you will see that Essex is unable to even landscape properties, upgrade basic infrastructure at properties. Folks this is worse than a financial company. This sophisticated name REIT is nothing but a bunch of business background people with no real expertise or experience in making or building anything tangible. They play the game of borrowing, hiring contractors, putting legal verbiage to protect themselves and then continue fooling residents with promises. This is a dot com all over again that is using craft accounting practices. Watch for a scandal to erupt soon."
The reality of this fraud business is coming out in the share price. If REIT's were safe bets and Schall's ESS was the best managed of them all I would expect this favorite of all hedge funds to be holding it's ground. Folks the drop is not due to the COVID-19 or anything. It is purely due to people realizing that the ponzi scheme going to explode big time. Watch Schall line up for Fed handouts soon.

"Do not blindly take the lofty valuation at face value. This is not a tech company by any means. It is a money draining business that puts your hard earned money into the pockets of management. Residents and prospective renters - take note of the rip off schemes and disappearing acts of management after making promises of upgrades. Drive around and see for yourself how run down and unsafe some of the properties are. Their pricing model is clearly skewed towards charging based on your salary and paystub. They will let apartments rent for below market rates because it suits them since they will get you to pay 50-60% more than the market rate. Stay away from this company that will do anything to make a profit including invoice you some someone else's apartment issues. They are a self-administered REIT. Managements' interpretation of this is ""self-pocketing millions using any means that pass their litmus test"". You can imagine what the thinking is since it is run by the same people for over 2 decades."
ESS is down 7.89% to 180.83
"Oh well. I bought at $224 sold today at $229 and got the $2.xx per share dividend coming. So made $7 per share on my 250 share and off to a stock that trades more volume. This one got me scared on low volumes. Thanks Essex for the $1,750 profit is basically 4 days."
"Renters - warning for you. Don't believe the fancy apartment photos you see on Essex advertised properties. They are Photoshoots of everything looking perfect. In fact Schall can even make a garbage dumpster look neat and clean. This is his strength. Sell you anything, get you to sign the lease and then show the true colors.Also, rent is negotiable. Don't let bully apartment managers tell you that you are paying below market rate. They will lie to make sure you rent the apartment. Essex runs a classic Ponzi scheme. They have borrowed heavily and managed to keep the dividend fixed which resembles a nice yield compared to the 10 yr note. When yields reverse sooner than you wake up one morning, you will be left holding Schall's bag of promises and lies. Never encountered a management team worse than even a privately run business."
Folks if you want to learn the art of lyng and making excuses and neglecting customers who have made Essex successful Schall and his management team are the people that should be awarded prizes. You will be shocked at the third class operations they are running. As usual Wall Street is on a high ignoring the debt levels and toxic culture at Essex. GE has dropped its dividend to a penny. Schall is pocketing millions. There is a term called reversal to mean.
The management cannot even comprehend customer service.
"Folks if you think the PG&E bankruptcy is going to make headlines wait till you see Essex management announcing their legal mess. Negligence, lies, pushing off needed maintenance.....the list goes on and on. Lawsuits coming....Essex will as usual try to hide all this under the rug.....the know it all's that they are However, this time around I don't think they will get away. Watch this unfold.....it's coming whether you saw it or not......The stock market and institutional investors treated Schall as if he is the best CEO in history. Can't wait to see how they do when liquidation starts...."
Essex managed properties are starting to have higher vacancies. Residents are realizing that the 15% cost increases that Essex has pushed onto residents over the years isn't being taken lightly. The service has not kept up. In fact service has deteriorated to a point where the CEO doesn't even care. Why would someone who is pocketing millions at the cost of the hard working main street folks do anything different? Think of it: 1) Increase in vacancies. 2) Large fixed costs to service debt. 3) Employees leaving.Remember recessions don't show up until its 18 months into one. Are you going to wait for 18 months to claim 1c on the $?Be bold unlike ESS management and move out of the losing stock. Buy another REIT like AVB or simply move into index funds that have outpaced ESS by 5-8X in 2017. Stop chasing the $7 in payouts. It's not sustainable.
"Essex Property Trust (ESS) is one of the best run REITs owning & operating appartments in California. They have a solid balance sheet, good interest coverage & track record of dividend growth. Therefore ESS was trading at a premium to their NAV in the past.Currently it's priced around 23% Discount to NAV (284 USD) - Why?"
"Folks I am sure you know of Yelp. I bet investors and analysts don't give a damn, but if yu are putting your own money go read the reviews for Essex Property Trust. You will see the same theme play out there....lies, bullying, incomplete projects, trashy apartments, no maintenance, pocketing deposits and not returning money. These guys only care about how to get rent within 5 days while playing merry hell with their suppliers and contractors. I am surprised people work there and believe in this shady operation. Silicon Valley P/E ratio, recycling money between holdings.....all a farce to keep the stock up and yield higher than the 10-yr USTN. Good luck....Hope you have buyers when you choose to dispose off this unethical holding."
I would not buy this stock. It is a company that is not going to sustain performance due to poor quality of redevelopment work and inability to be ethically compliant. Ponzi scheme tactics will catch up soon to them and you will see massive liquidation of assets. to raise cash. Customers are not going to keep accepting shoddy work and shady business practices that are rampant by this corporation.
ESS is up 7.31% to 204.82
"The BS duo is back at it. For decades these folks just pocketed money without bothering about lease enforcement. All of a sudden the Burkart-Schall duo is starting to wake up and smell the coffee that everything is not rosy at their poorly managed properties. Foks, just because Essex cannot get their act together or empower their employees nor manage their layers of people, they are asking high rent paying residents to not live as they have since their dilapidated and non maintained apartments crate noise. Can you believe it that they want your dog not to sneeze at night since it disturbs residents. Folks these guys turned the other way while riding the stock up. Schall has no ability to even type 2 sentences. Burkart has no desire to even connect with residents and he is COO now. Ride the wave since he fall will come soon. Don't be fooled by the P/E ratio and current yield."
"Folks I am surprised that analysts are not putting weightage on Management effectiveness. Essex management are sophisticated story tellers in day to day activities. Essex StEalerS have no ability to hold their management accountable. It is a joke in what stories Essex employees get away with in real day to day interactions with residents. It seems like the wave riding is happening at all levels in Essex. Read on yelp, apartmentratings.com and other places to see how frustrating it is to deal with Essex. Board of Directors seem to be aloof as well. Letting the CEO run the ship without any empathy for customers. I have emails from Essex management that supports the lowest bar in customer service that I have seen in today's digital age. It's shocking to see that the layers are so ineffective in problem solving. Lawyers I bet you can get people to sign up for a class action against these guys for negligence and discrimination of residents."
"P/E ratio lofty and higher than some tech companies. Net profit margin artificially maintained. Will drop like an asteroid when earnings come out. This is a run of the mill REIT managed by financial wizards and run without empathy for customers even though they claim to be in property management. They have meticulously managed to show large profits by the sole method of eliminating work that they borrowed money for. At the core they will do what it takes to show a growth image to ride on the coattails of Silicon Valley. AVB, UDR, CPT, EQR, AIV are far better picks and customer focused. Investors it's time to file lawsuits because sooner or later the truth will come out."
Essex Property Trust is up 5.04% to 293.32
"Doesn't seem like anyone really works at Essex. Schall is aloof probably riding the stock high of his lifetime. Amazing to see thieves fill their pockets while cutting out on operations. What a shame the CEO of a public company like Essex has allowed a company to accept. How can these guys even sleep at night? Loot residents and employees in sophisticated ways by making promises, writing leases with jargon and protecting their backsides just in the name of filling their pockets."
How is there only one person posting on this stock.
"Folks enjoy the festive season. The lights the cookies the colors and the high...Fraud fraud fraud will be the words that you will be soon corelating with ESS. It is visible in their day to day dealings with vendors. Folks, Essex claims to spend $250,000 to repave parking lots in their properties. When you see the shabby, incomplete, poor and fraudulent work and find out that the contractor only got $20000, you should start the hunt to see who at Essex pocketed the balance $230,000. If this is not a wake up call to dump this stock and move on rather than get fooled and enticed by a yield that is not sustainable, then I am not sure what you are waiting for. Run for the exits before smoke engulfs this shady company and management led by Schall."
ESS is up 6.79% to 233.55
Way overbought stock. Analysts tinkering with a $3 price target difference. Wonder how they don't see the downfall coming. I guess it's a new generation of analysts who haven't seen the Enron and Lehmann Brothers collapse. Prop 10 will pass and ESS will be toast. The leveraged strategy is already doubtful irrespective of prop 10 results. Pathetic conditions at property level. Residents walking away from bed bug infested locations overoccupied by people. Lawyers - start getting ready. You can make a fortune suing this run of the mill company. Lots of money to pocket.
Talk about reality Vs fancy marketing and memos. Folks Schall can't even enforce consistency in memo writing under his Essex brand. This company and management team is a joke like a circus in Las Vegas. Since COVID all they have done is put some stupid flyers but never taken a hose to clean the place. I wonder sometimes if the dog poop around his properties belongs to dogs or is it investors showing him the true message. If he has any credibility he should resign and move on at his peak. It's only downhill from here for Essex Schall's weak leadership. Even his employees know he is a joke when it comes to running the place. Essex does not make money running properties. They are running financial calculations to give the aura of profitability. Ask Schall to publish per apartment metrics. You will see how much money they actually lose. IF Essex was crem de la crem as Ross says (wonder if he has lost money) why would they have to put up billboards on freeways and open leasing offices on Sunday. If this was a sought after business wouldn't Schall continue his arrogance of claiming we have Apple and Google in our backyard. Folks he is clueless and so are the people like Burkart who work for him directly. They have warmed the seats. for decades. Earnings will show you the reality. Watch for some key metrics instead of focusing on the FFO. At some point banks will force liquidation. Enjoy the ride down since it will be more thrilling.
"Board compensation way to high, over pay."
"Take the announcement of today's $1.75 per share payout with a grain of salt. It is close to the end of the year. Management has to show a positive image. Watch this dividend get cut next year. The business feeding on easy money. Like a stink that never leaves a piece of fabric even if washed a million times, this business is deep rooted in ""Rob Peter to pay Paul"" tactics you will soon see come out in the market. Cash out or you will be funding suckers."
Very
Folks if you want to lose money gladly stay invested in this stock that is bloated by many one time events that are not clearly spelled out in the earnings reports. Watch for the commentary and goodwill charges. Whistleblowers start speaking up.
Donâ€™t understand why the 2.8% drop today. Q2 report was outstanding. Perhaps this was already baked in?
"""$450 million aggregate principal amount of 1.700% senior notes due 2028"" Would have been much better choice to extent the maturity of these 7 year 1.7% notes to 10, 20 or even 30 years."
"Fantastic, awesome what can I say. The typical commentary. Upgrades by analysts removed from reality. Greed as usual overtakes common sense. Don't forget the fundamentals: Essex has cut spending and is raising capital by selling properties. There is no real growth. Just the typical movement from Peter to pay Paul. Cutting spend then selling properties to make up EPS. Folks, IBM did this. Bought back shares. Look at the stock performance for 12 months. Even Warren Buffett lost money. Here is how Essex operates today:1) They are probably colluding on rent prices and driving out residents (refuse to negotiate renewals) under the fancy words that ""Apple is in our backyard"". They have no mercy on seeing Americans unable to afford because they want to maximize their revenue by renting to new residents who work in the Tech sector. Allowing residents to sub let and let more people stay without being on the lease while charging legal residents with higher costs. Bed bugs, overflowing garbage, stinking apartments and common areas.....this is the real Essex.So, enjoy the ride. If $260 is the price target the yield will drop to levels below the 10-yr note. Do you want to hold this stock at that price with such a poor yield? Wait for $180 and then let's see."
Sell before you lose money. There is no real growth nor ability to make a profit. Don't get sucked into the yield. It is not sustainable. Essex CEO will be raising money soon a.k.a borrowing to run a Ponzi scheme. Essex is running on the hype of the tech boom in Silicon Valley. Analysts don't sit back in offices with glass walls. Instead visit some of the dilapidated properties that feed this cash strapped company. This is a classic business case example of how to fleece customers while making promise to investors. The CEO is so out of touch with reality that all he is focused on is short term gains so he can stuff the board and his pockets to keep him from being ousted.
"The shoe has fallen. Downside prevails and will be accelerated by real data that will show the true colors of this money sucking business with no real profitability. This company management has no ability to turn things around. Talk to their vendors, customers and see the reviews for yourself on other websites. There are layers of people idling their way with no justification for results while markets keep funding their poor performance. PE is higher than mature, profitable well run companies that have proven business models. Not sustainable. Dividend cut imminent."
"When local agencies leave unfinished projects analysts and consumers are first to rant online. However, when the ESS CEO and his team play the cat and mouse game to manipulate sentiments using fancy Marketing, promotions and story telling, no one tends to penalize them. Folks its time to pay with your wallet. Stop renting from ESS. History takes time to write, but eventually when the dust settles you will be left high and dry. ESS lawyers do nothing but write up fancy leases all to defend their nonsensical activities. Prospective candidates for employment - read the reviews online on multiple websites. You will be trapped in an organization stifled with bureaucracy and a chain of......."
ESS reached a new 52 Week Low at 218.94
"Another earnings report and commentary to go with it. Folks read the fine print. NET INCOME is done. The game of pushing 10% rent increases in Silicon Valley is over. Essex is busy cutting costs and it's evident around their properties. Daily sights of cigarette butts, burnt out lamps, status quo processes and defensive tactics by their management is the new culture adopted by Essex. It's clear money managers have set their buys on robo orders. There is institutional buying to sugar coat returns for funds and claim hefty dividends. Residents- vacancies are piling up. DO NOT blindly renew your leases. Call the corporate office and ask to speak to one of the guys who is pocketing millions. Mr. Schall has a nice setup that basically relieves him of being customer focused. You can negotiate net zero rent increases. Do not fall for the trap of the local leasing office managers stories that they have demand and the market is driving rents up. This is not true."
10-yr note passed 2.85% and soon will hit 3%. What does this mean for a business like ESS that is hooked onto easy money. Bond holders - get ready for a ride you have never seen before. Would ESS be the first REIT in today's market to file for Chapter 11? What has ESS done with the money raised over the years? Wouldn't you expect to see completed projects when you drive by their so called suburban properties? I can't wait to see the $100 price. It may come sooner than imagined. I bet the earnings commentary will be another lame duck session.
"Looks like the 2019 message from the CEO of Essex is pretty much the same....1) Continue telling stories to residents...2) Ignore issues and continue riding on the bandwagon of the investor belief which is so removed from reality3) Cut investing in basics...I wonder if Essex is even paying their employees....4) Continue shabby work while borrowing from markets, selling properties and investing in properties that cannot be managed. Folks, Essex cannot and has not been able to manage a property with 140 apartments. Imagine a new building with bells and whistles...and demanding millennials...5) Continue rewarding non performance, poor ethical decisions and showing up to work mindset...Folks - the whole chain of management within this company is involved in lying and dodging issues...."
"Debt is piling up. Craft financial transactions are being used to show profits. Price/book is at 2.74. This stock has gotten away out of control and investors are unfortunately, caught up in the greed. Forward P/E of 55 is unsustainable and will never materialize. There is zero growth in business. Actually ESS is losing money but kicking the can to the end of the road and showing financial transactions to make up for the losses. S&P 500 will remove them from the index only when they realize that, but it might be too late as management will have cashed out and left investors hanging."

Folks I think the next step BS duo will take is rob a bank to keep paying the dividend.Look at the recent 2% drop in institutional investor ownership. Recycling debt while starving shareholders with barely a yield that is able to be kept up is what the 2020 strategy looks like. Individual investors you are risking money for nothing. The WACC barely covers systemic risk you are taking on. There is no additional risk return compared to what debt holders are getting as the game of moving money around is playing out.Good luck....see you at $200 soon.

"The only company I know off that does a conference call the next day after earnings announcement so it gives the management team time to make up stories. Analysts - you are smart guys since you project have been ballparking low estimates giving ESS Schall the benefit of doubt when he beats. This has been ongoing for many quarters now. Either you are unable to improve estimations precisely or are giving Schall the ability to inflate the stock with earnings beats which are in reality not true. You are focused on few metrics. Ask Schall to report property by property numbers. Revenue, costs, vacancy rate, customer satisfaction (make sure you add zero to that scale), turnover, ROI etc. You will soon realize that this ponzi scheme only works for select properties."
Essex Property Trust is up 5.03% to 223.94
"Folks, get ready for the downside soon. P/E at 51. This is not even worth calling a company with a Management that is capable, let alone giving it a growth P/E ratio. Watch how the dividend is cut soon and analysts in bed with Schall will soon start downgrading the stock. Schall has lawyers and financial people running the numbers. No company grows with cost cutting and shady business practices. See yo uta $220 soon."
Folks Schall claims to have raised money to pay for development of Meridian. Meridian is a dump. Check out Yelp reviews.. It's worse than a waste land garbage disposal area. It stinks. Schall is so removed from day to day reality that it's not even funny. The Board Of Directors know they are protecting a CEO that pretty much has them hand cuffed. Surprised they have not walked him out with a zero $$$$ golden parachute. Folks Schall's lack of customer service mentality is visible in day to day Essex employee behavior. Essex is a classic circus. The Management pushes employees to address issues. The employees know Management is clueless and has no desire to fix problems. Essex internal emails are a joke.....2019 will bring this ponzi scheme to it's knees....watch this unfold.....
"Folks make sure you don't fall for the sob stories from Essex. Go read Yelp comments for Essex Property Trust, the HQ for ESS, the place where the BS duo sit and hide from their customers.DON't FALLL FOR THEIR EMPATHY OR SYMPATHY TOWARDS RESIDENTS. Bottom-line - these guys are like cockroaches.1) Negotiate any rent by 15%. Yes 15%. These are words from a management RPM who basically is trained to lie and make easy money. ESS will just push high rents as they have over the years. Just push back. These guys will back off. Schall has trained his people to bully and lie under the claim that Apple and Google and Facebook employees are desperate for their properties. BOYCOTT this business. They don't deserve a dime.2) COVID-19 memos. What a joke. No follow through; just a effort to show they have a CEO and they can write a memo.Stay away and sell this stock. They are desperate to make money and continue cutting corners, not fixing maintenance issues and showing that by raising their dividend they are actually profitable. Surprised the analysts at hedge funds and mutual funds are cheating hard earning investors by investing in this #$%$ business."

"Read the fine print in the earnings. One time property sales have pushed the revenue above the analyst expectations. Wall Street continues to miss seeing the underlying lack of fundamentals in this mismanaged company. While the stock may go u based on past history, everyone should be aware that future earnings are not going to materialize. I will be buying at $50 in 9 months. This company is far from healthy. It shows in their day to day activities. All you need to do is talk to main street folks, ex employees and read online forums."
"Folks ride it out before you fall into bankruptcy courts. Schall will retire just like any other elected official. Fill deep pockets, rip the common man and run shady apartments. The Chairman who also benefits from the business practices that Essex runs doesn't care at this point in his life. His puppet Schall will do whatever it takes unethically to keep on discriminating residents, putting lousy managers in charge so he can bull his way. Hopefully the new generation sees through and uses the social media platforms to expose these crooks....and don't worry about the analysts and bankers....they will just plead the 5th and move onto another symbol. They have no love lost if Schall is thrown out.See you at $200."

"Folks read the edited earnings transcript and count how many times the word ""other income"" has been used. This is classic deference strategy in use. There is no substance to any of this lying of numbers. And income growth higher than rent. Of course the BS duo refer to their incomes not the income of common man. Spot the reference to E-team...hahahahh...joke...E for Entertainment not for Experiences. The VP running the regional management chain is a joke. They run a circus. Folks, these guys look to the sky when they walk properties. Even a 5c lemonade stand has better roadside management than this so called E-team. As usual the BS due is creating a sympathetic argument that they cannot raise rents. In fact they have got their hand slapped trying to bully people into rent increases because people saw through them and called the BS duo on their BS. IRR 17%. Folks ask for the math. Ask Schall if the NPV was positive. Ask him how much he has sunk into the hole blindly. And investing in tech and data analysis. Folks, again their are moving your attention away by using buzz words in the tech world. The HR function at Essex cannot even enforce basic communication consistently. You believe these guys can implement tech to improve operations....folk the BS duo is all about BHAG to increase foot print at any cost. by end of 2020 they will issue $300M worth of new shares, have a fire sale and then blame the rising interest rates....I thought financial analysts would see through the shady transactions and lines on the income and cash flow statements to fabricate profits....."

Iâ€™ll start nibbling at 250.. west coast recovery is gonna be slow and painful
Look at how the #$%$ duo timed their stock sales in February 2020 and then stopped after the stock tanked. Breach of fiduciary duty. Wonder if the Legal person at Essex is even ethical.
"Highway robbery used to be a theme in movies back in the day. Now mall robberies seem to be common occurrences. Folks, petty thieves or stealing in a sophisticated way from investors and customers is an art perfected by Essex under the watchful eyes of Schall. Think about it- tell the bond market of BHAG and get them to pony up money. On the other side, promise customers BHAG and then fool both sides while pocketing profits and enriching management.Time to dump this stock and let a phony company go bankrupt. YES on Prop 10. Operations at this company cannot sustain levels needed to be in business.Everything catches up. A board so removed from reality of the CEO's actions will be in defense mode soon. Shenanigans have been going on for decades. Folks, Essex is not a REIT or a finance company. However, they behave like one. In simple terms they are middle men borrowing under promises or paying back while promising grandiose things to customers. Customers are drying up. Essex is cutting rents. Essex is begging customers to refer them. Essex is unable to keep lights on at properties. You can keep waiting or get out and watch from the sidelines. Choice is yours. Rookie analysts, robo buying by Vanguard, ESI, ISI, T Rowe etc is just keeping the foam frothy. Anyone heard of the tip of the iceberg....well this will go down in history as one."

"Folks you can see the reality now. Burkart casually retires after f in up the company while Schall continues ignoring customers. Folks, this is nothing but a tactic of sliding under the radar while passing the baton to the next #$%$ Angela Kleiman who is no different. Probably more arrogant than #$%$ Time will tell but the changing management landscape will soon blow up and show up in earnings. I am ready for $180 by end of Q1 21."
"The economy has never been stronger. Everyone can see it. Yet the CEO of Essex makes statements that housing is strong. Duh! Instead of focusing Essex on solving real problems that they don't seem to bother about, the CEO is focused on making remarks that even a 5th grader can make seeing the uptick in economic activity. Folks if there is an award for an out of touch CEO, it should go to Essex. The lengths to which they go to cover up mediocre work, incomplete projects, poor employee performance and money they spend to pay people to tell the customer that they are right and the customer is wrong is just unfathomable. While the stock has moved up the volume has been low. Maybe Essex has been buying back stock with the money raised from Peter to pay Paul.Time will tell since at some point investors will realize that ethics is not Essex's forte."
"If you want to locate an encyclopedia of lies and excuses you will need to visit Essex Property Trust Corporate offices. It's evident in their daily operations that they never run of lies and excuses. It's amazing to see the disconnect between the floor to carpet office and the employees in the field. Essex is fantastic and sending mailers and flyers boasting use of technology and processes while in reality it's non existent. I don't think even a local circus will operate like Essex. Analysts at Thomson, Evercore, Vanguard, Blackrock and other boutique outfits....it's time you dump this stock just for the meager payout of $7.44 per share. Essex Management has nothing to lose. They are veterans who have pocketed millions by their shenanigans. They will just walk away and move on since most of then have had their tenure at Essex. It's a club run by the same old mentality of false promises. Even Essex employees who work in the field have no respect for the Corporate staff since they don't seem to care about the top down messages and instructions. Watch for a bankrupt company soon that has used the bond market to their advantage. Not all bonds are the same and Warren Buffett himself has said that REIT's will suffer. Essex will be the first to fold you watch."
ESS is up 6.07% to 199.42
"Prospective renters - stay away. They will suck you dry and provide nothing in return that is promised or explained during a property tour. Current residents - run a mile away from ESS. Their management is only interesting in fleecing you. Their employees lie and their project managers have no track record of completing work. If you ever need to deal with their Regional management team, bring a lawyer to every discussion. They are wonderful story tellers. Check Yelp and www.apartmentratings.com and look at the way they have treated long term residents.Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and other tech company employees- vote with your money. Stop funding a company that is unfit to provide safety, service and state of the art amenities. You are far better off at properties owned by AVB, De Anza Properties, Prometheus and The Irvine Company.Investors- Ask the CEO if he has ever lied? Ask him why projects are incomplete? Ask him if he is even in touch with reality of day to day operations. Bond holders- Far better returns out there for similar REIT's and stocks. This is not a growth company."
"Classic support at 230 well managed by Schall and his daily focus.Schall probably has the whole company focused on eliminating Yelp reviews, preventing real customers from writing reviews on websites like apartments dot com and having his CFO buyback aggressively to show support at 230.Wall Street as usual is ignorant of real feedback from main street.Time will tell. The August 1st earnings will definitely show weakness and if it doesn't that's because of underspending, pushing cost onto customers without service matching those levels. Folks the can has been kicked down the road starting 10 months ago. The can will hit Schall right back in the next 6 months.Watch for $180. It's coming and it will happen. Invest in Treasuries to protect your principal and still yield 3%.Schall has made you lose 13% of your principal in a year."
"Folks read the fine print. Financial Engineering tactics are being used to show earnings beat. I would think analysts at the top fund companies would be smart to read through the BS duo and dump this stock. I guess they are waiting till the dividend payout is cut. Secondly, ESS is below industry average in most metrics. BS duo is showing profits because they have chosen to ignore fixing issues at properties. They have craftily shifted the focus to new investments and showing they are buying properties in Redmond and Silicon Valley. Folks, this is not rocket science. They cannot manage an operation. Period. They can't even respond to customer service feedback. These guys are so embedded in lying that they don't even see it in their employee behaviors. Look at the days payable metric. The yare basically fooling their suppliers and not paying them on standard terms. They have drained the cash out since they get a huge payout via dividends themselves. Even free cash flow over net income has dropped by 50% since 2014. This stock is not worth the current price. Good luck holding onto a losing stock and a management team."
"Folks - investors are clearly removed from reality. Here are the facts:Zero transparency on security related issues at propertiesEasy borrowing but zero maintenance of basic operations.58 page leases full of jargon and legal language to ensure deep pockets continue to be filled.Zero community building by property management.Different stories i.e. lies to different residents.Folks- it's time someone comes in and uproots this REIT and teaches them how to run a business that put customers first.Can't wait for the earnings call to see the earnings miss, soft projection for Q3 and Q4."
ESS is up 6.08% to 193.31
ESS is down 8.38% to 254.29
"Folks watch for how many times the losing Management at Essex uses the word COVID to cover up their revenue loss. They will never take the blame for their stupidity and mindless expansion while cutting corners, reducing services and boasting about Apple and Google employees lining up at their doors. Folks, these are the same guys who trained their apartment managers to bully long term residents in the hope they will leave os they can jack up rents. I read thru Schalls #$%$ thru and thru on conference calls. I have patiently waited with my put and now it's ITM and will only make me more money while ESS tanks to $150. It's evident financial gimmicks are in play and an artificial floor around $200 if being pursued. Schall should be walked out or if he has any self esteem he will leave."
Essex Property Trust is up 10.13% to 250.17
"Folks get ready for cuts in dividend, FFO and all the bells and whistles that Schall has been promising. Forget the yield since the payout is fixed. Also, the ride and wave that Schall has been on due to Apple and other tech companies had no bearing on the ability of Essex to perform. Essex had even trained their staff to show an attitude to anyone wanting to lease if they were not at Apple. Folks, bag and baggage watch these people move out while Essex picks up the scrap. I wonder if we will see Essex management sweep up the parking lot garbage, cigarette butts and other stinking leftovers since they pretty much haven't proven they can manage properties or maintain them. Anyone find the $230000 from the parking lot scam......brace yourselves....$180 is coming....this PE is not sustainable due to slowdown and secondly due to shady business practices....."
ESS reached a new 52 Week Low at 215.59
"Just look at who has been running the place. Right from the Chairman to the CEO to the COO to the VP's to the RPM's to the local managers, yelp says it all. Greedy liars, no ethics, hungry for power, never wrong....list goes on and on....Stay away from the stinky business that is filled with incompetent people. Folks, its who you know that gets you hired in and if it's true that they have come from competitors, then you should buy competitor stocks for getting rid of unskilled employees.Folks, CEO, COO, VP's are all milking it at this org. Including Board of Directors. Amal Johnson should be ashamed of being on the board of ESS and ISRG. 2 totally different businesses that treat customers day and night."
"Folks double standards, excuses, circus theatrics....shabby common areas....classy Marketing and photos far from reality is what you will get by investing in this company.The stock is barely up over the past 5 years and it was only up because of cost cutting and some low balling of metrics. Reality is here. This business needs to go under in this crisis since they add zero value and care a damn about true customers. Nice put premiums to pocket while waiting for $100 strike."
"Out of touch analysts upgrading this mediocre company stock. Folks, it's the same lame management running the show enriching themselves FIRST before taking care of customers. Surprised the class action lawsuits haven't started. Apartments are dumps in the Bay Area. Rents that were $1500 and went upto $2800 re not back down to $1500. Money is being moved from one pocket to another to show profits. Renters are being moved to different apartments to show that there is demand and apartments are filling up. Folks this is classic accounting gimmicks. The whistle blowers at Essex seems to be sitting waiting for Schall to Crete miracles. $180 is coming soon."
"Reports of ESS entering oversold territory based on RSI and high yield of 3.02% are starting to pop up. This is just another publicity stunt and push by certain financial entities to get buyers to come in and stop the downfall. Do not get enticed by numbers like $7 per share or 3.02% yield which is higher than the 10-year Treasury no note. There are infinite stocks out there to purchase and some are much more reputable than ESS. If you want to hold an equity REIT, check EQR. It beats ESS across the board on all metrics. Folks, the joy ride for ESS is not going to end well. Why do you want to be holding the can that they are kicking down the road?"
"Essex Property Trust owned and pathetically operated apartments are a ghost town in some locations in the Silicon Valley. Folks, this is not due to lack of demand or people leaving the area. The fundamentals speak for themselves - garbage dumps, property site management obnoxious in dealings with residents. See for yourself on Yelp. Folks I can understand a business cutting corners to show profits. Greedy management does that at times in corporate America. But when this becomes a toxic disease where in this is the only thing they focus on, the public sees through. Hope investors at Vanguard, Invesco, Blackrock, Cohen & Steers, FMR, JP Morgan and others see this reality and vote with their money because end of the day it is someone's hard earned money they have taken in good faith. It's not even funny to see a REIT classified as a Finance company that has no staff to even manage properties. All they do is send newsletters to ensure they have no legal action against them. Lawyers, Essex is a haven for lies and negligence. Class action should be written all over the headlines."
Watch for the inflated P/E ratio. It's based on inflated earnings by eliminating services at the cost of customer safety not because of a healthy business. ESS will do whatever it takes to maintain earnings while ignoring reality. Sooner of later the S&P 500 index will catch onto the reality and downgrade the stock for a skewed risk / return ratio that is not sustainable.
"Pittsburgh Steelers is one of the iconic names in football. Steelers were named after the steel industry. Essex would love to be linked to an American industry that built this country. However, ESS takes it a step further. ESS - Essex SteAlerS. Yes you read that right. SteAlerS. Everyone knows it's a crime to steal cash, but Essex does it in a sophisticated way. They promise amenities that never materialize, they cut deals with 3rd party companies that they cannot manage or control, they leave unfinished projects. All this happens while making sure they fleece renters, lock in leases and then operate like the famous Michael Jackson song ""smooth criminals"". Essex should be awarded the best website award that is filled with Marketing limericks. Folks living in Essex properties, watch out for those move out statements. Essex already has figured out how much they need to rip you off when you leave and they will make sure they get you. Folks, this company has no expertise in property redevelopment. In simple terms, they are act as middle men who have no desire to improve, save residents money or for that matter even provide a safe and secure environment. They have lucked out by the boom on the West Coast using fancy Marketing, aggressive pricing and even writing leases filled with jargon to scare you off while protecting their CEO and unproductivity of Essex. I would think analysts, investment bankers and Wall Street would know better given their expertise in analyzing a business. Profits, dividends, payouts all are great to pocket, but when it comes to fleecing the common man, one would think Wall Street would have empathy."
Buy puts. This is going downhill fast. The yield is kept artificially inflated.
what is Maddog's deal?? I've never seen a board so inundated by one poster. OK....we get it. You don't like Essex. This is one of the best multifamily REITs in the country...and I personally believe that Mike Schall is a good leader and leads a great executive team.
"Leadership and management are 2 different things. However, none of these words exist at Essex based on the actions. It's evident Schall is not a leader because he has proven not to be one based on direct experience. The people who work for him are not management capable based on their handling of issues at the property level. On further comparison with Wal-Mart or Costco its so evident that Schall's Essex is not even a comparison. It's a joke what customer service one gets from Essex. Walk into a Walmart and then into an Essex property office. You will walk away depressed from Essex. And if you compare Sinegal's Costco and his leadership, ESS should be put in the wall of shame by Wall Street. Time will tell. $180 and YES on prop 10. Schall will not believe it until he sees it but he will be the cause of Essex going downhill."
Day to day meanings at the Essex SteAlerS based on experience. One would think Management lists their contact info in order to be reachable. Wonder sometimes if they have bunker offices.1) Empathy - huh? What is that?2) Customer Service - you are knocking on the wrong door.3) Value - we value your money not you or your feedback.4) Professionals - our way or the highway. We bully.5) Seattle to Silicon Valley to Los Angeles - we have so many customers to that each one is told something unique.......on and on.....investors...have a conscience like you shun ATF stocks based on your fiduciary duties and single out companies with no ethics in day to day practices.
In at $204
"Yes on prop 10. That is what a real true leader would say after raking in millions at the cost of 10% YOY increases for over 15 years and cutting spending, over time pay and not investing in employee training. But, Schall will not do any of that. Instead he is pushing projects into Q4 after promising to complete them sooner and will eventually cancel them when the 10 yr yield equals the yield of ESS stock. Folks, the can has been kicked down the road long back. Now Essex is trying tactics to basically keep cash on hand to maintain the egoistic increase in dividend. Bond holders, the writing is on the wall. Stock holders - you will lose a lot of money in the next 6 months.False advertising of new clubhouses, BBQ pits, energy efficient lighting....you name it...what hasn't Schall promised the residents. Unfortunately, execution in property redevelopment is not his forte. Schall has basically not diversified Essex. Instead he has gone on a binge buying properties under the blind hope that laws will never reverse. One would think that the claims that his employees make of his smartness would show up in a diversified portfolio. Time is up. Schall and Essex are done running the ponzi scheme."
"Analysts at BoFA/Merrill Lynch have raised the price target to $277. Such a disconnect and narrow focus to only look at interest rates, yield, property locations and price increases. Folks, Essex Properties are a dump. Not to mention lack of safety, gimmicks to fool residents, lies about projects and upgrades. Wouldn't you think that at some point they would be truthful? I guess while Wall Street continues to fund their mediocracy why would they change anything. $180 is coming before $277. Trust me ignorance is not bliss in this case and do you think an analyst on Wall Street cares about the common man losing money. The stock is down 10% YOY. The yield is paltry compared to top notch companies out there with lower risk."
ESS is down 4.92% to 279.69
"If Jerry Seinfeld was still making the famous Seinfeld sitcom he could do a year or 2 of episodes on the Essex SteAlerS. Investors obviously not many of you have direct experience dealing with this company from a customer standpoint. It's such a joke in seeing the company run this business. I guess they probably have a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign outside their corporate office since everyone is busy making up stories and managing the bottom line. The top line has grown because of the economic boom. That is evident. However, they need to show bottom line profitability which they are pros as by cutting maintenance, making promises that never materialize and using slimy tactics to pass on costs via 3rd party companies. I wouldn't be surprised that the money if flowing back to Essex. Remember dot com days: companies driving pallets around the building and claiming revenue. I am sure when the dust settles Essex will be issuing stock, cutting the dividend and begging for investors."
ESS reached a 52 Week low at 217.48
"Finally investors seem to be also realizing that the free ride due to low interest rates and random buying of properties is catching up to Essex. I am surprised that analysts just downgrade and upgrade instead of coming out with a price target of $100. It' interesting to see how the analysts are still not able to see the reality. Time will tell who is swimming.....when the tide passes. Remember dot com days and fancy stock symbols that attracted money. The same way story telling over the years, being in Silicon Valley and riding on the coattails of the tech sector has allowed Essex to get the same level of attention. Folks this is not a tech company nor is it a Walmart that is tech savvy. It's down 10% YOY. I don't think the S&P is down in that same time period. Decide for yourself how much more money you want to lose."
"Schall is adamant to pocket money at the cost of cheap service, looting of residents via leases that are never enforced and discriminatory rent increases on residents. The culture and day to day operations at this unethically run company don't stop at petty lies and story telling. They are deep rooted in supporting bullying managers. Read for yourself on the internet.This stock is inflated and kept up by institutional robo buying to pocket the yield. There is no growth and YOY you would have lost money. The treasury market has made a comeback given the increase in the 10-yr note. Safe and sound, no hassle, no dependence on a CEO that puts his personal agenda ahead of residents who pay the bills.Stay away from this stock because it will fall faster than you can imagine. $180 is coming. Don't fall for the fancy yield. Essex cannot pay their bills and is leveraging the tech boom in Silicon valley. Apartment vacancies are on the rise. Some properties have 15-20% vacancies in prime areas."
ESS is down 8.95% to 251.07
ESS is down 5.58% to 278.21
"Hope mutual fund companies soon have the same shameful experience that Schalls puts customers through. I bet the P/E will fall to reality. It's amazing to see literate illiterates across Essex management. Folks, legal mumbo jumbo and hiding behind desks is how Essex runs the show. They are feeding their greed while borrowing cheap and kicking the can down the road. Watch this blow up. Renters don't accept mediocracy and lies in day to day operations. Essex management - property management is a circus. Both lie to each other and then to residents so nothing is true. Their actions speak louder and they are on a witch hunt to make revenue by purposely not enforcing leases, then charging residents as if they caused the issues."
"Grammy's, Emmy's, Golden Globes - award ceremonies to celebrate artists. Shouldn't there be a public wall of shame for CEO's? There are junk bond kings, rotten tomatoes for movies.Here is why Schall will hands down win the worst CEO ever award:1) Zero empathy for residents.2) Inability to respond to customers.3) Tolerance for shady practices in operations.4) Toxic top down culture that fuels kickbacks.5) Lease jargon to protect rather than serve. Folks if you breathe in front of a property manager they can write you up.6) Corporate flyers reinstating rules which are never enforced.â€¦... Investors - walk away. You could be the first to expose REIT shenanigans, kickback schemes and much more. Don't just punish companies like GE, GM or others that have a reputation built on strong ethics.Weed out ESS. NAREIT time to throw Schall out from your board."
"Don't miss the fine print. As I said 6 months ago. Essex needs to raise $300M and not for grand ambitious unfinished projects. This is just to recycle money between holders and for working capital. These guys are running a Ponzi scheme and banks and institutional investors are playing along. They cannot even fix light bulbs for 6 months at properties nor can they even understand how to select projects. These guys are playing with cheap money while keeping Peter away from Paul. Red flags and alarms should be going off at Evercore, Vanguard, Blackrock and other fiduciary institutions. I am surprised the S&P 50 index doesn't boot them out."
The dance around 230 level continues. I can't believe analysts can't see through this company's practices in the real world. 10-yr note will hit 3% in a few months. There is no doubt about it. Wonder if ESS is worth the risk given flat to lower returns. The payout of $7 of yield of 3.08% is just the tip of the iceberg. This stock doesn't deserve to be in the S&P 500 index. They can't even maintain properties they own and manage. Oh and the leases are filled with jargon. Basically a get out of jail free card for their management to have no incentive to perform basic duties.
"What a joke the ESS culture Burkart-Schall have created and strive to enforce. Shareholder paid employees of ESS painting nails while customers wait around. Also, shirking day to day responsibility is highly visible in properties in the South Bay such as Reid Square, 101 San Fernando, Oaks etc. Folk's you don't need to be a rocket scientist. Common sense tells you the reality of this company strategy. Their sole goal is push 10-20% rent increases while cutting corners. This is how Schall operates. The employees know he is weak and timid and has no ability to communicate with customers that have made him rich. All he cares about is filling deep pockets. I am surprised his management team thinks the same way. Time to put this bureaucratic, easy money fueled business in the right place. Sell puts because you could be buying from insiders who are looking to profit from the slide down to $100."
Schall has spent shareholder money to push the stock price up. Brilliant! Hope he feels good about shortchanging real customers by not even being able to fix light bulbs and train his employees on ethics and service. What a CEO! I wish he is awarded some world prizes someday for his classic orchestrating of one of the biggest scams in the stock market when it erupts. Wonder how a board tolerates a CEO with no ability to be empathetic with customers who pay his salary. 1 analyst will fix them right sooner or later! Enjoy the meager dividend and lofty price which is supported by lies and cutting corners.
ESS is up 5.03% to 229.25
"Institutional investor ownership is out of line with the reality of this business that had meager operations. Folks, recessions don't come with a warning. However, companies go bankrupt overnight and Essex will be one of them. Just look at the history over the past 5 years of binge buying on leverage of West Coast (California) concentration. You call this a smart CEO! Analysts who have proper this stock up as if this is a company selling a life saving drug. Essex management won't even get a star for customer service. I wonder how much they spend to block reviews online. Does an analysts have the courage to ask for property level incomplete projects? Does anyone have the ability to challenge the CEO? A new generation is probably working at Essex now. Surprised they tolerate such bureaucracy and lying to residents. Folks, watch for $180."
"Looking at the latest list of holders of ESS, I am surprised to see an ethical customer friendly low cost financial firm like Vanguard increase their holdings of this unethical, customer unfriendly CEO and his company ESSEX.Vanguard promotes investing on behalf of hard saving investors but when it comes to their lack of acceptance that ESS CEO cannot even run operations to maintain properties, it's time to call them out. Folks, I bet when the dust settles, you will see how Schall has enriched himself at the expense of lies to customers. Money raised to fix light bulbs has probably gone into fixing his own property. Essex management is deep rooted in daily unethical practices and their own employees are starting to see it and move on from properties where the management does nothing practical and important to maintain safety of residents that pay their salaries. The earnings report today will definitely show the crack is deeper and wider than it looks on the surface."
"Folks, read the fine print in the earnings release. There is no growth. All there are is excuses and financial gimmicks. Share repurchases so the BS duo can continue filling their pockets. Bold statements like they care about residents during this time. All BS like the BS duo. They cannot even return phone calls. The earnings are actually showcased if Essex was going to crush the analyst estimates. All they have done is recycled money from bonds, moved expirations out, used money to prop up the stock price by buying at elevated levels (one would think that they knew how to dollar coast average down), issued notes to fund daily operations. Folks, if operations are profitable why would a business need to use borrowed money. Is the BS duo siphoning money on the sidelines?Can't wait for $100....will continue pocketing premiums while patiently waiting for this ship to sink. Projects funded 5 years ago have not been completed. The management of funds and operations is wore than a Chinese company with zero transparency."
What a run up it's been? The crash will be twice as hard. What goes up must come down and that's even more true for a company with zero ability to solve problems. Apartment vacancies piling up. Incomplete projects is the new look at Essex properties. Money seems to be drying up to pay contractors. Essex management blinded by easy money and profits due to the tech boom. They can't even fix a light bulb which has been shown to 3 layers of management at this company full of story tellers. Starbucks is even shutting doors to train their employees. Wonder if Essex is smart or the market is smarter. Time will tell. Enjoy the ride since the fall will not be fun.
"There you have it folks. Even financial gimmicks like selling properties, buying back stock at inflated prices is not helping ESS. Covid excuse has been used a zillion times in the earnings report. Folks, this CEO has literally eroded wealth and benefited himself. No wonder he supports the left so he can continue milking the system.Throw these guys out and put Essex out of business. The company operations are a joke. Burkart is even worse than Schall. Watch for $150. It's coming. There is no way out of this. Essex has ridden the Silicon Valley boom with arrogance and bullying. They will be raising a lot of money to keep the stock price high and maintain the payout. Schall has no clue what he is doing"
"While the BS duo sell millions in stock, Maintenance struggles to get market wages. The quitting of maintenance continues to other companies that pay better. Analysts will never tell you this nor think this is newsworthy. However, as an investor this shows the true culture in practice. Start questioning the quality of numbers. Essex is buying top line and financially engineering the bottomline. The FCF is filled with adjustments by not finishing projects and paying out funds on time. the operating income is doesn't cover costs. $500M in new debt. For what? If ESS P/E is higher than the market is it really making money or fabricating numbers? Just because it is in an index, there is foolish buying by Vanguard, Evercore, JPM and others. This stock doesn't need to be part of any index for the unethical business practices. The BS due along with the CFO have no clue of NPV or IRR. They tell you they are raining money to upgrade properties. In reality ask them how the money was spent? Ask them to break down cash flow by property. They will never tell you how many properties are losing money and residents. In fact they will just move money around to show everything is well. And let's not even discuss city violations yet.....Folks, read the numbers. This stock is not even beating the S&P for the lofty valuations the analysts have given it. It's evident analysts have drunk the Kool-Aid and only talk to the same people at Essex. Are these analysts truly analyzing the true worth of this company? How many customers of Essex have they talked to? How many properties have they visited? Good luck folks. See you at $200 and watch the BS duo exit in 2020."
I have a feeling ESS will see a pullback now. What yall think? Not sure how awesome-STOCKS finds all these incredible trade ideas but im happy.
"On 12/20/2013, ESS cost $142.12/share while US10Y was nearing 3%. Yield back then was 3.4%.Today 05/15/2018, ESS costs $235/share while US10Y shot past 3% and US2Y is at 10-year high. The yield on this stock today is only at 2.9%.ESS will need to fall to near $200/share just to yield 3.4% as it did back then.With the Fed raising 25 basis points every 90 days, long term Fund rate at 3% double of what it is today and US10Y continuing its climb + 1year CD at 2.2%, this stock ESS, along with the rest AVB, AIV, MAA are going to continue to slide.My first limit order purchase is at $200/share. Who are the stupid people holding on to this stock at this price of $240/share today?I will see you there at $200/share in no time, certainly by end of 2018."
"Walls Street is so removed from Main Street on ESS valuation. Analysts needs to check Yelp.com on some of the flagship properties Essex manages or for that matter doesn't know how to manage. Search for reviews on Solstice, 101 San Fernando, Brookside Oaks, Via, Reed Square.....The theme is same all across. Poor customer service, lack of professionalism, story telling and price gouging. Folks, this company needs to be taught a lesson that hasn't been taught for a while in Corporate America."
"I don't know what your bad experience was with Essex, but they run a much better REIT than EQR and others....and have produced consistent rests for investors. The quality of assets directly relates to competitive advantage and future value."
"Folks, hope you are enjoying the ride down as much as you had the thrills of buying on the way up. This is classic hype and failed promises now being realized by investors. The can that has been kicked down the road for years and decades is not pretty much like a hot air balloon that has gone poof.Surprised the Chairman keeps the CEO in his job with all the nonsense Essex does. Lie, bully, cut corners, falsely market amenities, borrow money and then don't complete projects....list goes on and on...Don't leave this company. Sue and make sure they pay their fines and residents for dilapidated apartments."
The ride is over. Consumer sentiment is turning the other away. Apartment ratings are headed south. Revenue shortfall and dividend cuts will be the next step.
ESS reached an all time high at 326.22
ESS is down 7.11% to 194.21
based on my own property I would expect a good earnings report. I am at 98% occupancy and very little non payments.
Great company.....High quality assets is the best west coast markets. All I see here is one unhappy person talking....but you have to know that this is the best apartment REIT in the business.
"One would think if you contact this Corporate bureaucracy to discuss rent payment during this unprecedented time someone from the chain of command would have answers specially when a month has passed. However, the BS duo as usual continue running the show in lassiez faire style while their employees continue to show their usual non caring and arrogant behavior. Folks, I would be ashamed to be associated with this business as an investor. 124% payout ratio can only be sustained by cutting corners to an extent that there is no ethics in making decisions on what is must to or need to do.This is one of the most disgraceful management you will come across. Keep holding until you yourself lose money."
"So how can you trust this CEO and team? Isn't a crisis expected to show humility and gratitude. Yet Schall continues to protect his VP's and continue firing front line workers. His VP of HR has no clue about training nor about customer interaction training. This stock has bounced back because of her mentality buying. The numbers will tell it all. This is such a #$%$ run operation that they need to maintain margins in anyway they can whether is be bullying people, cutting corners, delaying maintenance or even falsifying information to attract tenants.Stay way from this stock and company because you will pay heavily in losses."
Essex Property Trust is up 5.18% to 195.98
Forward P/E at 47.57. Got to be kidding. Operating margin (TTM) at 34.58%. This is only because of lack of proper spending to maintain apartments. Essex SteAlerS have basically abandoned projects that they raised money for. I don't think the word fiduciary is in their books. They are desperately trying to maintain their quarterly payout. Cash balance 50M. Debt 5B+. Folks sell before you are left with nothing. Price/Book (mrq) at 2.31. This stock is not worth the book value of 94.93. The valuation is so skewed that institutional investors are also starting to reduce holdings. I have no confidence or faith in this management team running the show for decades.
"Folks FFO is up because of buying and selling properties. This game that ESS plays towards the year end to boost numbers overshadows the real money losing business. Also same property NOI and revenue reporting is definitely made up in some form. Bottom line is way down in currently owned properties. What does it tell you about the Operations? Based on direct experience with so called Executive Leadership at Essex I can tell you that it is a circus. It's amazing how the layers are protected and get away with lies and stories. Same issues surface every few weeks and a new answer is given. The quality of work is worse than what you can do yourself and the inefficient management of so called projects at properties can be seen on sites like Yelp. Essex HR is so muted that sometimes I wonder if they have a voice in how poorly trained their employees are in basic fundamental communication. It's evident the leadership team at Essex is in cahoots with vendors, utility management and bankers. Watch the 10-yr note hit 3+ and massive liquidation to start. This company will go down in history as the most sophisticated.....Essex has pocketed millions under the name of making communities better. Shouldn't there be a sign of progress in their so called coastal markets.....I can't wait for $160 in 10 weeks."
"Folks, the BS duo along with the like minded management has started selling shares. Take a note. Secondly, ESS should be worth $500 given the BS duo circus show in day to day property management. Vanguard analysts who seem to love this stock and have put the CEO Schall on a pedestal for his lies and lousy management are so removed from reality that the P/E ratio is higher than some consumer staples companies. The dividend is artificially baked in with strategic aka cost cutting to the bone. Folks, Schall has refused to fix light bulbs, make true on grand projects for the simple reason of pocketing millions while fooling Wall Street. Keep the ride going because when the lawsuits hit which will expose negligence, false accounting and many more behind the scenes schemes and gimmicks, the BS duo will walk away since the Board has no desire to even respond to emails."
"10 months ago I had written that Schall will need $300M by end of 2018 to fund buyouts, pay debt and also fill his pockets with the dividend that he knows is not sustainable with FFO. This is exactly what he has done. Folks the guys running this company have no ability to even know their head from their â€¦â€¦.they can't even fix a light bulb for 2 years. They have no interest in real work. They are a Finance company moving money between accounts to showcase profits. The real business makes no profits."
ESS reached an all time high at 330.80
Essex Property Trust is down 4.92% to 279.69
The earnings call was another example of showing that it's all hunky dory at Essex. Folks. they have stopped paying for maintenance that is required. They are pocketing money raised from markets. Bond holders - don't be surprised. Most public companies have replaced their CEO's over time. I am surprised that the Board of Directors and Chairman at Essex is blinded by such lousy operations.
"Folks debt is piling up faster than operations cash flow. This trend is not going to reverse soon. The CEO and his team have sucked out all the money and continued paying themselves to since REIT income is tax beneficial. I am surprised Silicon Valley tolerates such #$%$ companies and management teams. Schall cannot even maintain basic hygiene at his properties. His whole business model is get new people in so he can restart his shenanigans from scratch. These guys are a Ponzi scheme with fancy marketing, legal jargon in 52 page lease documents and a customer service number that goes to the moon. Good luck. Shareholders you are basically holding a bag of ....you can name it yourself...and institutional investor don't know any better because their robo buying blindly support yields. Lawsuits is the only way to get Essex to clean up and pay their fair share for breaking laws."
ESS reached a 52 Week low at 199.09
"Wonder is Schall was a band-aid salesman at some point because he know how to apply them craftily in day to day operations. Folks, its simple: growing top line is easy in an expanding economy, growing population and low interest rates. Marriott has done this. Hilton has done this. Schall's strategy is nothing to boast of. What Schall lacks and will continue to lack is managing and leadership. He would top the list of SIC's - Socially Irresponsible CEO's. Lies and excuses are probably ingrained into the VP's and management team at Essex. Investors obviously love the stock for the fixed payout which will be unsustainable. Schall has dodged low interest rates and managed to keep things afloat. However, he is decades behind in running a profitable operation. And everyone knows in America bottom line matters. Watch this unfold....."
"Talk about a company that has standards......Essex employees spitting in your face. Shows the top down culture....wonder if they spit in the face of management at their corporate office. Folks another real life example of disgusting work ethics and disregard for customer service. The legal team at Essex is solely in existence to protect the shenanigans of BS duo so they can continue borrowing cheaply and running a show. You are better off handing money over to a mutual fund than buying a stock of this debt laden, bureaucratic company that basically doesn't care about shareholders or customers. It's a faÃ§ade they put on just like everything they do at property level. They boast of big spending but the quality of their work clearly resembles their quality of management lies and ignorance. There will be 1 analyst who will see through this and issue a sell rating. It's just a matter of time."
"Folks, as usual buy backs by Schall and Co while refusing to spend money on property development. I bet a big portion of his and his lousy management teams bonuses are tied to keeping the stock price at $250 or higher. It's clear this business is losing money and is not sustainable. Rents are down by 40% in his prime market Vacancies are up in the 20% range in the Bay Area. Is Schall going to pull money out of his xxx to show profits next time?Guys this foolish CEO keeps thinking the market is going to ignore his socialist behaviors and keep ripping off the rent payers. Watch for sub 200 soon."
"There is no reason for a pop today. Looks like Suntrust Robinson Humphrey a boutique firm that directly works with management at companies like Essex has upgraded the stock. Wonder if they even know how #$%$ the Essex service is. Its very easy to sit in front of a computer screen, run some projections, look at the P/E ration and some financials and upgrade ESS to a buy. ESS is currently showing very fancy metrics such a book value, payout ratio, yield etc. This is the past. I hope there are some smart bankers, analysts and traders out there that see the reality on ESS - Essex SteAlerS."
ESS is down 6.32% to 221.16
"Millions of layoffs, millions out of work unable to pay apartment rent.....I'm loading-up on storage REITs... they'll need a place to store their junk...after moving back-in with relatives$CUBE, $EXR, $NSA, $JCAP, $PSA, $SELF, $LSI$AIV, $APTS, $AVB, $CDPYF $CPT, &EQR, $ESS, $MAA, $UDRhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4334099-shelter-in-place-5-apartment-reits"
"Hope you have had time to digest the earnings commentary. yes, commentary. Same old stories, excuses and lines. Chairman and Board seem to love this CEO who robs Peter to pay Paul. Folks, Essex needs money. They are not generating enough from Operations even when they have cut staff, maintenance and sunk to the lowest level of customer service. Even their EVP, SVP or whatever fancy titles they have for their management is so out of touch that you will be shocked. Wait for $180 or sell and move on to higher growth stocks with better yields. Choice is yours. YES on 10 will seal the deal. I expect a management shakeup soon."
"The conference call answers are a joke related to maintenance and technology being incorporated. I can tell you that Essex has no clue on how to maintain a property in a timely manner. Their vagueness on expenses cannot be timed and they don't have a date for closing is so true. They never close. They are wonderful at telling the market what they want to hear. Trust me these guys have no desire or interest in problem solving. Spot the word ""customer service"" or ""excellence"" or ""resident interest"" or ""putting the customer first"".Enjoy the short ride. ESS will be in a downfall soon. Surprised the board has no control over the CEO and his team.Essex will do anything to manages costs by basically cutting out items that they are required to do. So they tell the markets one thing and actually do another or don't even do anything since they have no control of productivity and efficiency of their employees and it starts at the top. It's amazing how employees take the CEO for a ride and he takes the markets and investors for a ride. Essex management walking a community - really....you would see something on Instagram or you would see fixes to problems. It's amazing the stories these guys tell."
"Burkart-Schall what is your plan to hold your operations accountable to cleanliness, hygiene and follow through on the memo sent regarding COVID-19. Many such reactionary memos have been sent by Essex during account hacking or some change to online links. These memos are useless since they have no proper operations oversight. By firing property level managers you are just protecting your corporate staff and their lack of ability to do anything meaningful and customer friendly. Do you plan to get out of your office and come and clean the garbage and staircases in your so called 250 properties? What is your plan? You are unable to have anyone competent at property level nor do you hold your own direct VP's accountable. How long do you plan to have sub standard amenities, broken lights, leaking pipes (wasting precious water), zero maintenance. Lawyers start lawsuits. Only way to get these guys to come clean."
"YOY you would have lost 12% of your money. Today the Treasury market pays the same yield as the S&P. It is worth holding onto ESS stock given the poor quality of management, false promises of projects. Folks, Essex charges so they can siphon it off to the CEO's wish list which is not resident focused. It's evident in their inability to manage properties. Their management chain all the way from RPM upto the CEO is filled with people who will lie to save their jobs. I am surprised there is no whistleblower who works there that cannot come out and speak the truth about Essex.Get ready for another 10% drop and good luck losing money. Vanguard and other fund companies don't care since they are swayed by the yield and robo buying to match index performance. AI and ML will hopefully clean up inefficiencies in Fintech and take into account reality of business ethics instead of numbers on a balance sheet."
"Folks, one would think that a project done in 10 years would have state of the art solutions. Unfortunately, Essex is going backwards when it comes to remodeling. And guess what Schall refuses to even acknowledge customer emails or letters. Talk about character and ego. In fact his team is so engaged instory telling any lying they they are willing to protect his performance.Board of directors as usual are pocekint millions and selling the yield to investors. There are many stocks that yield higher than Schall's run Essex...and don't write off the 10YR USTN. Risk free return and you won't lose much of the principal even if rates were to rise.It's time auditors come out clean about Essex....."
"Surprised to see Neuberger Berman hold 4.9% of this unethically and callously managed company that has zero leadership in customer service. Folks, it's visible top down. Arrogance and attitude of the employees who face customers reflects frustrations with Schall and his management team. Schall continues to pocket millions leaving poor skilled front line employees to continue story telling and lying to customers while fleecing them with high rents. Promises of better common areas, upgrades to dilapidated facilities, gyms and more....the list goes on. Wonder if Schall is stealing from Peter to pay himself rather than reinvest in what matters....keep holding on to this dying company...soon you will in line for bailouts."
Operations cash flow is kept inflated with reduced spending and finishing of projects. ESS is actually losing money. Thus ponzi schema will explode. At some point there will be a clean up. Question is will Schall be held accountable?
"Eudy retiring or being shown the door. Folks, as I have said before Schall needs to cleanup and also get himself out of the company that is deeply rooted in politics, lying and making excuses. Here is how Schall plans to show how great he has managed. Schall will have a fire sale of properties to raise cash. He will classify it as diversification. He knows he has vacant apartments piling up in Silicon Valley and Seattle. The markets that gave him his claim to fame. As long as he shows a penny more in earnings Wall Street (the ignorance continue to show) will push the stock up until, yes until they read between the lines and realize the ponzi scheme is in deep.....Maybe too late....Schall will be off to the races by then while the board cleans up.....watch this unfold...."
"I started following ""--lion--stockc--allerrts--"" (Gooogle it - off course without any space or dash in between the words) and their notifications are better than anyone else."
"Time is up for Schall to start restating earnings and cutting the dividend. The yield on the US10YR is higher than ESS. 12 months ago I predicted the day will come and it has come sooner than ESS planned for.This is a dead stock, management and run of the mill company. You don't even need to be an analyst or financial person. Common sense prevails! The shoddy work, business practices and lack of caliber in the management ranks is a daily sight in operations. Stay away! Dump this American business that puts its pockets before customers. Just like voting, sell the shares and protect your capital. Hubris will kill this business in 12-18 months."
"Burkart-Schall when do you plan to fix the #$%$ common areas in apartment complexes you are charging arm and a leg for? It's clear your management team and their reports don't care a damn about maintenance. Why don't you decorate your office entrances with bird and dog poop, stinking garbage overflow trash areas and also turn off the lights so you can walk into the wall.when do you plan to stop stealing money from investors and just showing positive results. In 20 years you don't plan to hang around Essex so why kick the can down to the next generation. Surprised Wall street is stuck on the $7.80 payout. Folks this is a dead company full of whistle blowers who are sitting on the sidelines. Just like MCD and Under Armor this will blow up soon and write down investments."
Essex Property Trust is up 4.90% to 214.62
Analysts I suggest you ask Schall to publish the handbook of lies and excuses that he has handed down to the employees as Essex since you are removed from the day to the reality at the properties Essex owns and doesn't know how to manage.I am sure the handbook is getting revised now that Prop 10 is on the ballot.$180 will be here sooner than the 10YR Note hitting 3.50%.
"Folks, maintenance is walking out of jobs at Essex properties. Vacancies are piling up in flagship locations closest to Google, Apple, Facebook. Management as usual is aloof and doesn't care a damn. The CSR is another gimmick to turn attention to fancy buzzwords and show that customers are a priority. Schall has no ability to even get back to customers. He knows it well. Surprised a CEO of a third class company like ESS boasts big in the market place. Hubris will get to him sooner than later.I can tell you someone is selling $270 puts for a nice premium and there is a huge interest. Does anyone know if insider trading rules at Essex have blackouts and ability to trade options? Those who want to hold an empty bag stay invested. Watch the 10YR yields sky rocket."
Folks puts selling for high premiums. Definitely someone on the inside or an intelligent investor is enjoying the free money. The BS duo as usual lack customer service or humbleness in day to day Essex dealings. the chain of command is so old fashioned and out of touch that it shows in their employee behaviors. Very surprised to see Amal Johnson be on the board of this company that will basically treat long term customers worse than prospective residents. Schall has had his run folks. He has pocketed enough while starving the customers with his lies. Saying thanks is not in their vocabulary. Folks sell and move on. The reality will be out and the put sellers will be rejoicing.
