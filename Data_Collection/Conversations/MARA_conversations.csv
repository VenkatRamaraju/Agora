Marathon now has 238 institutional owners according to Fintel. https://fintel.io/so/us/mara
THIS WILL AND I SAID WILL BE $80 IN A MONTHS TIME! I HAVE SPOKEN!
MARA is trading much stronger than bitcoin ... any reason why?
First time in a long time MARA is priced higher than RIOT
"hold, 100$ eoy"
"I see people doubtfull on my twitter and comments even tho i speak truth and am a technical analysist for multiple people in real life. I post everything with facts. Its going to 58 over the weekend maybe even today. I posted why in recent posts. Again you can be doubtfull or not believed it but the stockmarket is not a place to believe thats how you lose money, with feelings. The chart is showing this, multiple indicators, harmonics, the rsi, the macd, bollinger band. If you sell now or short. Sure do, but your gonna lose money or the biggest profit of your life. There is a short oppurtinity cause the tatget of wyckoff will be 58k and then back to 50k. But this today is just the start. Remember i told everyone days ago. So do you trade stock because you believe or have feelings? Or do you trade because of facts? Im already rich this is also your chance. Call to 58k, put to 50k, call to ath. Just like i said days ago. I told you, dont respect me, respect ta(techincal analysis). Im not a cook or a carsalesman. This is my job#riot #mara #hut #btbt #any #btc"
So what have they mined for the month of August..?? 500 coins!!??
"LETS DO LIKE AMC TODAY BUY,BUY,BUY"
35 TODAY?
"Something for MARA investors to consider moving forward: Plan B has been spot on. It stated in June, 2021 that August 2021 would have BTC close at $47k, September $43k, October $63k, November $98k and December $135k.With MARA looking to add 2,100 miners in 9/21, 6,000 in 10/21, 10,000 in 11/21 and 14,700 in 12/21 we should do very well as investors this year if Plan B is accurate. Of course next year and before the next halving in 2024 many analyst have a price target of $300k to $450k. In the first seven months of 2022 MARA will be adding 69,700 miners. Hopefully this bullish thesis holds true. If it does long term MARA holders will be richly rewarded."
"NCTY just keeps pushing upward... looks like it’s happening :) $30-$40/time. Been trading at these levels for so long, and the float is bought! Let’s go! To the moon! $mara $riot $btbt $mstr $ebon $sos $bitf $bfch $lglof $btsc $can $hvbtf"
"Like I said before, no one messes with MARA."
"Blockchain is getting bigger and bigger. Now, gaming will be done using Blockchain. Decentralization of Social Network using Blockchain. Customer privacy using Blockchain. No one can hack Blockchain."
"Understand Mara in red, when bitcoin green is, cannot understand I."
did marathon sell 200 bitcoin today? anyone know any info on this?
Half a billion in cash and no debt. 18% short. 22% return on equity. $300 PPS by your end.
"Perfectly bounced off of 46400 according to wyckoff and the weekly descending broadening wedge, everyone who is bearish is wrong. Simple ta. Target really fast to 58k then back to 50k before bouncing to all time highs. #btc #riot #hut #mara #btbt #any"
200 days moving average says next resistance for bitcoin is 50k lets go MARA!!!!
Shorts need to cover today !!! This is just the start of a massive bull run 
Fidelity Buys 7.4% Of Bitcoin Mining Company Marathon Digital Holdings
"anyone can explain me why mara dont rise when the bitcoin was on 47,000?"
Broke through the 50k and now headed for 54k+
"Position trading notwithstanding, at this point, if you still have doubt that one year from now, when Bitcoin reaches $70000 or above, and with full installation of all the ordered rigs, and potentially further expansion at lower costs than before, MARA price will reach $70, you are too naive.If however, the world is further unstable, more covid variants, etc. and who knows, if China devalues its currency thanks to its decline in economic growth and lowered interest, causing more underground money flow to bitcoin, pushing its price above $100K, we shall see MARA above $80, or even approaches $100 per share."
Fidelity Buys 7.4% Of Bitcoin Mining Company Marathon Digital Holdings Across Multiple Funds
HODL the MARA!
"13.3EH/s in a little over a year from now. If Bitcoin stays around $40k, and global hashrate increases at the same level as last run-up of 150+ EH/s, MARA looking at a monthly profit of over $500million and a yearly profit of $6billion."
"If MARA goes to $100 it will still only have a fwd PE of 10, with BTC at $40+k.This stock needs to go up"
Closing green today
Markets are shaky right now but on the plus side mara is holding 30 and btc is stabilizing. I think we see a nice move up to 40 here soon.
Let’s go baby!! $COIN dips thank ya! $MARA $RIOT $NIO
$MARA is gonna take off and I'm right behind it. Talked about it in my last YouTube video.
I won’t be surprised if we open $40+
75 BTC a day in 5-6 months. They will do $1B in Revs in 2022
Didn't Riaz have $33 puts today?
"Guys! Stop and think about this. In 5 months MARA will have over 10 Exahash hashrate. 5 months further out in June, they will have 13.3 EH. Figure on average for the whole year, they will produce 68 Bitcoins per day. That is 25,000 for all of 2022. MARA will have 10,000 Bitcoins coming into 2022, so they will have a total of about 35,000 by year end of 2022. Let's assume in 2022 that Bitcoin hits $100K and averages that for the year. That means MARA has a $3.5 Billion asset on the books in inventory. The current Market Cap is $3.1 Billion. That is $31 times 100 million shares. A correctly valued Market Cap should be a multiple of what the value of the company is. Pick a super conservative 5x multiple. $3.5B x 5 = $17.5B. Divide by 100 million shares is $175.00 share price. We are WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY undervalued right now. Take the same numbers above and scale to the Bitcoin value you like. You think 5x multiplier is too conservative??? Then use 10x. 10x is not unreasonable. That means $350 per share. In all cases, this stock is going to Moon very soon."
"MARA likely will maintain a net profit of $1 billion per year after full installation of its ordered rigs.Together with its existing bitcoin holdings all that, the company at the very minimum worth $6 billion excluding any further bitcoin price appreciation and further expansion.That means a target price of about $60 one year from now to be conservative.If bitcoin reach $60K again, and they have further expansions, we are talking about an $100 stock."
where is sam??? shouldn't he be happy now ??
Institutional ownership has gone up more than 10 percent recently. Once btc and the market start going up again this thing will fly.
"MARA is undervalued! Compared to itself 4-5 minth ago! While haveing even better outlook with 13,3 eh/s and currently mining 5 times what they did back then. So it should be around 50-60$ nowdays.. hopefully heading there soon! This might be the first sign!"
Going up 
just wondering why do people like RIOT better than MARA? It seems MARA has a cheaper cost to mine and will have a higher hash rate next year.Does MARA need to any capital raises??
"OK I thinking ""bipolar"" ( no offense Riaz) from my last post w/ bit dropped last night, news is discussing profit taking from whales. ( I was originally thinking a modest price correction hence $45-46K) Implying a drop.My thoughts:#1 Searched up whales activity they are not selling but looks like more holding...........#2 $2.5 Billion options expiring at $44,000 tomorrow ( hence MM pushing bit down). Last month was a blow out b/c of this Thoughts or insight view point on BIT the next day or so ? i was originally thinking down but not mid to high $47K then back up to some insane number.Go $RIOT, $MARA, $BTBT, $HUT, $BITF and others I am too lazy to mention. We will see."
"BTC about to break out! if your not in this by now you will be crying over the weekend, BTC will smash 50k minimum! $MARA $RIOT to the moon!"
"Anybody notice RIOT and MARA are now at parody.With MARA'S increasing production, RIOT should never trade higher and should start to lag.This will increase buying pressure on MARA GLA"
Come on break 40 and run geeeeeezzzzzz
$100 by 2022
"Hold, do not sell until 200$"
Nothing we didn't know.Q3 is when the big $$ starts to flow.
Now now it is not the time to celebrate. Wait until the end of the year when BTC is around ... 100K ... plus
Looking to double my position at 35.50 if it hits tomorrow. See max pain for options here http://maximum-pain.com/options/Mara
"Absolute historical bullish divergence on sos, short squeeze coming soon? I hope you bought the dip on the mining stocks#riot #mara #any #btbt #hut #can #sos #hive"
$2 billion contracts are set to exipre for BTC friday get ready Boiiisss for great weekend !!!
If bitcoin hold at this priceMara $35 by morning
$39 party
I dont know what to say to shorts Lovely Mara!!!
"Over 7mil shares traded in the first 50 minutes of trading. Short squeeze together with more institutional and now new retail buying, I assume. Thoughts...?"
RISE!
Earnings in 8 days I’m not expecting anything to amazing with the pullback in bitcoin in the last few months but it’ll be interesting to see how the numbers stack up
Insider buys!!!
For everyone who bought calls im happy for your earnings big time. Wait till btc is at 58k for a put to 50k and then a call again to all time highs#btc #riot #mara #btbt #any #hut
Whales are buying $hut easy money
"MARA produced 25 Bitcoins per day on the 25th, 26th, 27th and 28th. On the 29th, it was 19 Bitcoins. It appears more miners have come online. There appeared to be significant down time in August and if August poduction cutoff date was Saturday the 28th, I have the month production at approximately 440 Bitcoins. Had there been less down time, they could have easily produced over 500 Bitcoins.Further, they moved 600 Bitcoins to a new custodial wallet in August. I expect to see more of this as their production rate increases.https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/3D72db1KMCnj7FL7MBsmxTw81z2bVu4UN5"
interesting day for news about bitcoin
"If bitcoin does anything today, Mara is ready to launch to new highs..."
"Long on Mara, Riot, Btbt and HUT.HUT is undervalued compare to Mara, Riot and BTBT and is the best buy now.Check it out."
"As much as I like MARA long time, do notice that the daily global hash rate up sharply the past several days, not boding well for the production numbers ....Wait for $34 - $35.5 re-entry point .... let us see"
"Here is what is planned by MARA.... By December, they will have installed 3 times more mining capacity. They are generating over 400 BTC's per month now and by the end of the year, they are going to generate over 1,200 BTC's per month. Sometime between December and March, BTC is going to achieve $100K per coin. MARA will be holding over 10,000 BTC's and producing over 4,000 new BTC's in Q1 2022. MARA will be reporting around $500M in revenue for Q1 and holding over $1B in BTC asset. The share price will be somewhere in the range of $150 - $300 per share. Be patient! Ignore the FUDsters, they are only trying to get you to sell your shares."
Until year end MARA will triple its mining capacity! Think what if BTC also rising… this coming 10-11 month will be huge for this company!! See you over 100$ by January
I am up over 50 percent. Go MARA go
You know it will hit $60 pretty soon.
"I'll get my interest back when these stocks are $50 plus.....and BTC 65000 plus ...yes I am in and have been, but have been down this road. Patience and time will pay off."
"CheckSix, your breakdown on the numbers 5 months out was very conservative. The reason I state this is for every Exahash they produce slightly more than 6 BTC. So at 10 EXH they are producing 60 BTC and then add in the favorable difficulty adjustment and those daily numbers are closer to 70 BTC per day. At 13.3 EXH the daily BTC would be 80 plus the difficulty adjustment. This number can be higher than 90 per day. Anyway you look at it if BTC increases materially over the ensuing year we should see a monster gain from todays SP.Also I know of several newsletters that have stated recently that they strongly believe that MARA with it future BTC production has the potentially to be the most profitable trade EVER! I know these analyst had made calls on Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla in its early days of existence. This should give people an idea where they can potentially see this stock heading."
Can you all not buy too much in pre market im from New Zealand and don’t have access until the official market opens.
"Sure MARA has more hashrate, but if you want to make more money from a stock then HUT 8 mining is the way to go, its gearing up for a 5× jump, its so undervalued. $RIOT $BTBT"
"sure was quick for this correction, I wasn't expecting it to happen so quickly. the money changers just wanted bitcoin to pop 50,000 now they are slamming it along with marathon and riot.thats what they do !!!!"
$MARA is trending on yahoo finance 
$40 tomorrow
"In the past 24h bitcoin has been going down in a descending broadening wedge again, which is a bullish pattern and we are slowly going over to positive momentum. Coming week is look extremely nice#riot #mara #hut #sos #can #btbt #any"
"With $50K BTC over the weekend, both $RIOT and $MARA will open 15%+ on Monday!"
Bitcoin will be about $45k tomorrow morning. Strong technical suggesting easy move towards $50k!!! HODL!
"MARA is really galloping, today."
"(Past 24 hrs) Btc Went down in a descending broading wedge. We broke to the upside, back in the ascending channel and broke down again(without bearly any bearish volume even more bullish volume) Forming a daimond pattern now. Making higher lows in the chart and lower lows on the rsi. This is hidden bullish divergence. Because this is happening in a daimond pattern i expect a huge pump. And dont forget we are following wyckoff accumilation almost 1 to 1.#riot #mara #btc #any #btbt #hut #can #sos"
OKay bitcoin is trading above the 100dma on the daily charts and that is VERY BULLISH. Just waiting for it to make its move toward and above the 200dma on the daily charts at 44440. It seems that is where it is heading this week and that is the final conformation of the trend reversals. MARA and RIOT are at their bottom price levels. I do not own any shares of these companies but I own Ethereum and DeFi cryptos and they have been very profitable.. These miner companies can grow in price 4 folds in a very short time. jmho
And just like that mara exceeded riot
Mara hasn't mined any bitcoins since the 21st. Why???????
Blackrock bought around 5 million if Mara shares in Q2!!! Guess it is bullish 
Second-largest U.S. mortgage lender will accept payment in bitcoin.
I find it interesting that this hasn’t made it to the Reddit board following. The growth story here is crazy and the high short interest. Right up their alley. Anyone a member over there than can post some good due diligence and get some of them on board the Mara rocket?
"Marathon’s Monthly Bitcoin Production Increases 66% month-over-month to 442.2 BTC in July as Total Bitcoin Holdings Grow to Approximately 6,225.6 BTC."
The real question is what price is Mara when Bitcoin hits 100k by end of year? I’d say 90-110. Depending on the surge and market manipulation
"We are getting everything we want, bitcoin near 40k and steadily increasing, Mara buying more miners to be biggest in the world, continued exponential growth in production as they install more and more miners…But price lags badly. I think someone else said this, but until bitcoin really breaks out, we are going to lag. We also need some institutional interest to drive buying volume up. As long as bitcoin holds, Mara will climb eventually, but it all depends on bitcoin."
Major industry players investing heavily in MARA! Get your piece of the pie now while it’s still affordable.
why are all the mining stocks dipping despite btc being up on the day?
"See that little burst into the close from $30.60 to $31.50? That's the shorts covering. Again, one morning coming soon, up 20% premarket."
Why MARA is up so much today?
"I am going to sit back and let them play their game because we all know they plan to make bitcoin worth 100s of thousands and marathon will be worth 100s a share.Just wanted to vent about the manipulation, I new there had to be a correction but when the money changers kept it going up they fooled me .cost me an extra thousand dollars for my shares. stay strong and HODL..."
"Bitcoin Topping $50,000 Stirs Forecast of Run Toward Record High!!!"
"it is all manipulated by the big money (MONEY CHANGERS IS THE BIBLICAL WORDS) they move it up when they want to and they drop it when they want to....bitcoin is used to move the mining companies stock ,eventually they will push for bitcoin adoption word wide and if you can stay in the game and hold onto your shares,you will have beet them and will make a profit depending on how much you invest  "
"Interesting, last night at 21:00 EDT approx., BTC at $49.3K begins stepping down $600. by near 22:00 EDT. Then for an hour at $48.7K until 23:00 EDT, it steps down again but this time it is about $1K to $47.7K by 00:15 EDT. Steady at roughly $47.8K, then at 0105 EDT, it steps down again but this time by $800 and stabilizes at $47K at 02:00 EDT. The interesting part is the clear steps an similar rate of decline in price each time. Very suspicious."
"Keep an eye on the ""Hash Rate Ribbon"" signal on tradingview for BTCUSD, when it hits BUY (looks to be Aug. 12) things are about to go nuclear."
"But on a more serious note, $BTC which one should consider to be the underlying asset upon which MARA is based, has broken it's point of resistance which would now indicate a level of support. This combined with the fact that we are entering a weekend, during which the shorts and hedgefunds are powerless to manipulate, we could see MARA revert to it's mean, to a proper valuation representative of the insurmountable growth in their capacity to mine bitcoin coupled with the reserve of bitcoin being HODL'd at this time. My $BTC target for this volley/ rally is somewhere above 55,000."
This board has become filled with ads and people shilling their scam projects. I wish yahoo actually cared.
"The real game has just started for Mara, brilliant prospect given its business expansion and BTC worldwide adoption"
Btc broke out to the upside of the falling wedge with the target of 47200 exactly hit as the bottom in the formation. Bullish divergence now. Lets look for some upside the upcoming hour. #riot #mara #btbt #hut #any #sos #hive #can
Surprised they didn’t release production numbers today for July. Maybe they didn’t want two press releases in one day. Maybe tomorrow.
64 bitcoins in 2 days…3 million dollars printed…
"$40 by the end of today, congrats to long. MARA will be $100+ by the end of this year. Blow out ER and the street like the most is GROWING!"
"Like i said no volume in the breakdown. So now it broke back up out of the descending broadening wedge, now kissing the the edge top side of a daimond pattern, for it to go back in its upwards channel. Massive pump in 12/24 hours? I believe so. Dont respect me respect ta#riot #mara #btbt #hut #any #can #sos #btc"
Descending broadening wedge on the 1h chart of btc now bullish time boys#any #btc #riot #mara #btbt #hut
Hopefully we can hold this gain or run higher in power hour
"Read this analysis on bitcoin. I know there are lots of analysis out there, but one line in this sticks out. It basically states that when this indicator referred to in the article has triggered in the past, bitcoin never sees that price again and enters a bull market run. https://beincrypto.com/extreme-drop-in-btc-on-exchanges-suggests-macro-bottom/"
According to charts brief financial analysis for MARA if btc can stay over 50k plus for few months . Price per coin mined equals a stock that is well over 100$ HOLD AND BE REWARDED !
"All else equal, MARA is at at a 20% discount.Reason, they just announced a 30% rig expansion at very low equipment cost; therefore, $30.5 is equivalent of the old $23.45.Let us assume the fair value just $28 if without the expansion, given the expansion, it should be worth 1.3 x 28 = $36.5 or so, a 20% discount"
Where’s Riaz? I saw him in Afgan TV. LOL
"I own the financials.. $GS $C $JEF $COF $BK $BLK ...adding when I can to all of them. $MS is quickly becoming my favorite horse in the race. Additionally, I'll be holding $GBTC $ETHE $MARA $MSTR $RIOT ...probably....forever. gl2a."
"50,000$ btccc letsss goooo"
"BTC almost $45K, MARA will be $37 pre-market. Congrats to long, $50 by Friday and GLTA!"
"Btc going down again in a descending broadening wedge, every short will get their #$%$ kicked. Wyckoff 1:1, remember i told you 2 weeks ago. Check the 5 minute chart to see the pattern its going down in again. Sorry shorts, but i told you.Dont respect me, respect t.a. #riot #mara #any #btbt #hive #sos #can #hut"
My Mara is one of those compnies who has most bitcoin on balance sheets !!!
"Bitcoin up, daily hash rate down, rigs delivery on track, what is not to like?Absolutely time to buy.$37 to $40 next week if bitcoin climbing above $48K with $50K in sight"
Mara will go 50$ soon
MARA #1 Strong Buy in Zacks ranking now!
"Mara mined 31 bitcoin today and 94 in the last 5. Production is back up to full speed. Source, Marapool."
"Come on Mara, keep climbing, keep climbing!"
$MARAI've owned RIOT and MARA and it is clear to me now that MARA is the better play.
"Back to the support levels all over again. The only volume we see now is weak hands and short sales. Come early fall, this will all be over in an instant. Hang tight, we are almost there with a huge run up in prices for both, BTC and MARA."
"Now that there are several large institutions buying up all the liquid float lately, and the short squeeze initiating, watch out -- we off to the races! $40 on Monday - Tue provided BTC will be strongly and firmly above $48-49k? Thoughts?"
I LOVE U MARA! U ARE MY ONE TRUE LOVE!
"If you do a little simple math, something interesting pops out. If they produce around 20 bitcoin a day this month (so basically no growth) at current levels of bitcoin, let’s round that to $24 million. Multiple that by 12 for the year ahead. That gives you $288 million. Multiple that by a PE of 10. That gives you a market cap of roughly $2.8 billion. Which is the current market cap today. So, no growth rate is included in the current stock price. Or people think bitcoin is going to drop dramatically. Also, you could argue that 10 is too high of a PE , but seemed reasonable."
Blackrock inc increase 322% is real news here is the link #Mara for bull run....https://fintel.io/so/us/mara/blackrock
mara should be at 40 right now....at least.

The bull in control. $50 coming
IBD stopped writing negative articles on MARA . It was daily attacks. They tried to discredit MARA and pump RIOT. Totally failed. Shame on you IBD.
"Approx 48% increased BTC production over last month. Inventory valued at $70M and rising. We're talking a ytd production of 1,748 BTC and rising: that's more than $MARA $RIOT $HVBT $HUT and every other public miner. To say the least, I feel much better about holding cash in BitFarms than letting it sit in a bank account. "
"A mandatory SEC filing dated June 30, 2021 shows that Blackrock, the world’s largest asset manager with $9 trillion in assets, has taken significant stakes in two bitcoin miners, 6.71% in Marathon Digital Holdings and 6.61% in Riot Blockchain."
I told you all BTC will go up this weekend !!!#MARA
Right now CNBC 17% of all Americans own Bitcoin and growing . Music to Mara!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"We are half way through Q3. As of today, MARA has mined 910 Bitcoin. MARA just increased their hashrate to 3.0 EH/s.... I believe from here to the end of Sept they will average 18 BTC's per day. That says they will end Q3 mining about 1,500 Bitcoins. The 3 month average BTC price for Q3 might be $43K. Q3 revenue will be approximately $65M. They will have about 7,300 Bitcoins in inventory, worth just under $400M at that point. The Q3 Financials should look really good. And just think, they will only be at 22.5% of their eventual mining hashrate!! Let the good times roll!!"
"“The involvement of Citigroup is significant because it operates on a large scale, operating in nearly 160 countries with more than 200 million customer accounts.”This comes as Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) have also expressed interest in the sector."
"(Massive shorts squeeze to 58k incoming) Weekly bollinger bands have crossed, monthly already crossed and opening further. At the top of the descending broadening wedge, we also had two daimond patterns on the 30 min chart. This is gonna be the biggest boom to the upside. All this will happen today or over the weekend. Remember wyckoff. Targets exactly 46400 bounce off to 58k back to 50 and then boom to all time highs. Make calls of the 58k boom and puts back to 50k and then calls to all time highs. Technical analysis and will be respected. #btc #riot #mara #any #btbt #hut"
Happy Friday!!
"Marathon moved another 200.6 Bitcoins yesterday (the 24th), to the same digital address account as the day prior. Both deposits were 200 Bitcoins each, into the new account. It would be nice to get some explanation from them on what these moves are for. They are producing Bitcoin again in the old account. Almost 19 Bitcoins yesterday and near 13 today, so far."
"Check out last Friday's yahoo finance article on MARA: with China out of the picture, Marathon Digital is in a bitcoin-Mining bonanzaBTC and MARA making new high by year end is a forgone conclusion. We can compare notes on Dec 31."
"Bitcoin up 2%, Nasdaq recovery, Mara barely up. What gives today? Options expirey tomorrow?"
"On both $MARA and $RIOT, the opening tomorrow would be interesting as cryptos are trending higher and higher …"
I love watching btc go up while Mara remains still because we know at some point Mara will catch up. Not to mention there’s still a massive short position to be covered. If btc breaks 50 I expect we see high thirties to 40 for Mara by end of week
"Actually strange this (and other miners) are holding their price. BTC down, Nasdaq down (and the rest of the market). Good news, very good news."
I still believe that the manipulation is done by the money changers and they will continue to move the price of bitcoin and marathon up or down when ever they choose to. hang on for the ride and make some money when they allow us too. everyone hold for the long haul....
"All you Debbie downers need to get over the ""coordination thesis"" of course there are shorts and hedgefunda playing this volatility. Can anyone blame someone taking profits after a 10% run-up on 30mins? In the end the only thing that matters is that BTC is heading higher. Higher lows and Higher Highs this is a beautiful channel and 3% a day is as good as 21% a weekend compounded. We don't need to move in massive daily gains. They will come 100$ MARA, HUT,BITF, Dmggf, ANY, etc will all move proportionally. Doe any daily swings matter....No. Chill have a cocktail and relax. Enjoy the ride. If you want to become a millionaire in a day play PowerBall."
Bitcoin up 35% since June 31st. This quarter was exceptional. There was a right down for March 31st to June 31st but that does not affect the bottom line. The bottom line is the value of Mara is 35% higher and the amount of mining is much greater since June 31st.
No one messes with MARA now including RIAZ. LOL
Massive superpump in btc any day now. Wyckoff 1:1#riot #mara #btbt #any #hut #sos #hive #can
"I am sure MARA CEO and board are encouraged by the share price appreciation since they announced the rig acquisitions, in fact, they should sell some bitcoin holdings now that it is very profitable again, and buy more rigs, the movement will help share price go up much faster"
Run Baby Run!
BTC is going to jump to 60k in a matter of few hours. Mark this post.
"$MARA, $COIN, $RIOT, $EBON, $HUT, $BITF, $HVBT, $ANY... the 2nd half of '21 should be stellar... time tells all truths..."
LOL at people promoting their crypto stocks here
Venmo launched a credit card feature Tuesday that allows users to convert their cash-back rewards into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for free.---Robinhood offers fee-free crypto trades. Coinbase has some of the highest fees for retail traders.
Adding to all of my crypto positions $GBTC $ETHE $MARA $MSTR $RIOT $BITQ before the weekend... I've seen that movie before. Holding thru the weekend has paid. Uptrend intact. Expect that to continue.
"total manipulation by the money changers, but we all know that they are going to make bitcoin the most popular crypto and use it for their end game, which is why it will continue to grow in value as it gets implemented in our lives"
Had to expect btc to pull back from 50 and Mara to follow. Oh well back up soon
BTC about to bust through 50k
MARA at $34 with BTC approaching $50K? You better be buying right now. You think Blackrock snd Fidelity are slouches for grabbing this in the 20s? You think that dip from $55 to $20 was real or orchestrated FUD allowing big banks and players to enter BTC and MARA on the cheap? Yeah that's how the market works sorry. No coincidences here for sure.
Will she make another run at green today?
"Btc breaking on of the small daimond to the upside and thus breaking out of the massive deacending broading, almost every other mining stock breaking out of their descending wedge. Massive pump possibly tomorrow or over the weekend target 58k. Buy now for your gains, remember i told you.#btc #riot #mara #any #btbt #hut"
I wanna cry...Mara is so beautiful 
"This is not the harvest time. Sellers. Harvest time is when they have all the rigs installed, and bitcoins $70K new high."
Remember when bitcoin dropped $30k sss up and down about 3 weeks now same thing $45-$48k about 2 weeks bitcoin $53k Mara will hit $40
Where’s Riaz ?
I am very happy with Mara and its future!
BlackRock Inc. increases 322% ownership of Mara. Enjoy the ride tomorrow.
Last time to buy at these prices#riot #mara #hut #btbt #any #sos #can #hive
MARA released their new IR presentation. Very insightful! Here it is. https://ir.marathondh.com/company-information/presentations
Another green baby!!!#Mara
Argentina evaluating integration BITCOIN into currency.
Why is mara going down..with btc holding?
Notice the timing of the IBD article today.
"marathon moved another 200 bitcoin, anyone have any information on where these 600 bitcoin went"
I need a pick me up. Someone remind me how many bitcoin have been mined this month so far.
Was skeptical a few weeks ago. Not anymore.
^^^MarketCap of $50B possible Fokls!
Mara an riot should be spiking higher with black rock making big investments in both
600 million options expire for BTC tomorrow.. New day tomorrow new BTC run for Mara & BTC !!!!
"Still the easiest stock to play, buy red sell green every dam time in this trading range now 185% in two weeks doing that. Look at $Mara and $riot calls. Its a simple game sometimes."
40 coming !!!
Mara is about to flip Riot and people are noticing!
Who else ready to see $EEGI $BITF $COIN fly at open ?? $UBER
"this morning bitcoin went down, marathon should have followed, it dropped off very quickly and recovered quickly and kept going up when bitcoin was down. the money changers drove it up to where they wanted it and now they are bringing it back down for their correction. Then they will shoot it back up when they are ready.AND THATS NOT MARKET MANIPULATION?"
Wow the slide in price comes at the time of the Investors biz Daily release...never knew IBD was so influential.
"Just spoke to investor relations about earnings release. They haven’t announced date yet, but will be by the 15th."
"Just as a reminder this is nothing according to ta riot and mara could go to 59, and every other mining stock to all time highs in no time. This is a life oppertunity in earnings the most amount of money you ever made in a week.Dont respect me, respect technical analysis. Every bitcoin stock broke above their 200 moving average. And out of a descending broadening wedge. This is the beginning of the breakout. Every stock could pop easily with 40/50 percent#riot #mara #hut #any #btbt"
"As of Aug 12, per my calculation based on BTC @ $45K, the cash and BTC holding is worth $460 Mil and growing. The growth are in 3 fronts - Growth of mining capacity, decreased level of difficulty as China shut their miners down and price of BTC increasing and expecting to hit $100K by the end of this year.So, Mara is severely undervalued at $60. Should see $100 by the end of the year."
money changers threw out a little news to drop everything...PS who gets the thousands of bitcoin the Fed's will get from prosecuting this guy?!!!!!
Where is Sam the Scam? I'm still waiting for him to admit he's been wrong from the very beginning.
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Fairstox.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
The short hedgie whales are working overtime on Bitcoin. They weren't happy with the BTC runup last Friday during the 600 million short positions expiring. Popcorn! Seatbelts! This ought to be interesting!
Can everyone just shut it about going to 35$ if you like the stock buy and zip it.. who cares what 3% less is going to make you! Peanuts Learn to trade a good stock you rookies
The one thing I really do not get about this as an investment is that the last bitcoin is scheduled to be mined in a few years. What is the business plan after that? Use the hoard to open a chain of burger joints?
"Looks like Bitcoin accumulation has cleaned out the exchanges, This signals a new bull run. We are headed for another double peak. Get all you shares bought and get ready to see the big event we've been waiting for. I'm really looking forward to the shorts finally getting burned. No! INCINERATED!!!"
Just getting started... $GBTC $ETHE $MARA $MSTR $RIOT $BITQ These have now grown to 8% of my portfolio. My strategy/discipline dictates that I trim a little.. back to 5% or so. I think the crypto proposition is different though. I'll hold until they grow so large it becomes uncomfortable. Any cannabis investors here?$TCNNF $CRLBF $CURLF $GTBIF $CCHWF $HRVSF $MSOS. ...not the Canadian cash burners (no offense to our Canadian friends)... the American market? The MSOs?
"Now higher that RIOT stock price, hi Sam :)"
Day traders are going to sell and periodically stall this run. The Shorts will desperately try to slow down the run. It would be great if BTC pushed up and over $50K right now.
Big boys like MARAhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonytellez/2021/08/19/blackrock-joins-fidelity-and-vanguard-as-a-bitcoin-mining-investor/
Results are out guyshttps://ir.marathondh.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1254/marathon-digital-holdings-reports-second-quarter-2021
super low volume today.... perfect condition for the manipulators.... do you see how their technique of trickling shares in sell mode takes the BTC downdraft of coming off its intraday high and manipulates the share price down?
Btc just broke down out of its ascending channel since august 27th so nothing major. Its also lacking bearish volume. If it would come back to 47500 where support is we would have a good looking and big reverse head and shoulder. According to wyckoff still a massive pump in 24 to 48hrs. Im not a moonboy im a ta boy#riot #mara #hut #any #btbt #sos #can
Added a ton at 31.25
"Slowly accumulating some more shares, trying to buy on healthy pushbacks like this, I estimate the price will be 45+ after a month"
"Strange board - So what if they needed to cash in some coins to grow ? They next to expand to meet the demand. They didn't do a secondary. I bought more this morning and will keep adding. Bitcoin now being used by 17% of everyone in the USA and growing according to CNBC yesterday. IF you run out of picks at a mind because there is so much gold, you too would give up a little dust to take out the mountain. You should be adding when you can and stay long. Will Bitcoin go back to 65 -I think so. I have no idea if they sold some but I don't care -they are doing what is expected mind."
"Long term bullish, YES, taking profits will be wise at this level given its volatility and Bitcoin volatility"
There's been really no increase in short positions this morning. I think it is just months-long holders that the price crossed their buy-in average taking their even money. Or it may be in preparation for additional shares going to be announced when the 2Q earnings come out (estimated 13 hours from now).
Fidelity Investment invested $20 MILLION worth of MARA!
$ANY 21M shares + 111M shares for Gryphon = 132M shares @ $5.20 = $685M Market Cap (227M miners by next year)$MARA 94M shares @ $36 = $3.2B Market Cap (103M miners by next year) Buy $ANY
PayPal launches crypto buying and selling in the UK
Nothing surprising in earnings. This will continue to trade based on bitcoin price until 3q or 4q earnings when reality sets in regarding just how massive their growth is and will be.
when bitcoin passes 50 this will blow up for sure
Is a Marketcap of 50B possible?
"Squeeze for $HUT, $MARA , $HIVE and $SOS"
"Great news on Balckrock -- with Fidelity and Vanguard and now Blackrock, it is only a matter of time until all the bears that are shorting this stock and all the weak hands will be washed out. The float is getting smaller, and it appears we are now forming a new support level around $33 per share just like we did a couple of weeks ago at 29 to 30 level... In my opinion, this is a very temporary bottom for this stock."
Hopefully dropping of Bitcoin and other crypto prices won’t affect $MARA and $RIOT that much
Is Cuba next?Yesterday it was announced that Cuba would follow through on recognizing and regulating cryptocurrencies for payments in a Central Bank publication. The proposed resolution would create rules for the use of such currencies and establish ways to give licenses to crypto service providers.
Btc price is huge. And mining companies are not profitable. Why? Whats the problem?
$42 $45 $50 $55 $60 $90... so on and so on
"Why did they loose so much money this quarter, buying more miners?I am buying more, but I am trying to judge how much to buy"
Monday MARA to open at $36 and close $40! $MARA $RIOT
Didn’t they already report earnings like 2 weeks ago?!
Can someone check on the short interest on $RIOT & $MARA?
"Great news, Mara is now ahead of Riot . Keep going up!"
"For BITCOIN to reach 100 by the end of the year, it needs to increase by $3,000.00 a week on average starting Monday. As some cyrto gryues predict 120+, that would be $4,000.00 per week. With the number of programs running 24/7, it seems that either target is a mathematical challenge.Just a tool to get a feel if its possible by the end of year.UNDERSTAND, i am long and ususally (and hopefully) wrong GLA"
"Gold miners have PE ratios of about 18-20, with low growth.BTC miners have PE ratios at about 4-7 with very high growth.BTC miners are deep value plays"
Fidelity has been buying MARA since $20 and continues to add. MARA to $100 quickly as supply of shares is dwindling.
"IBD distortion.... ""Analysts had expected Marathon to swing to a profit in Q2, but the company posted a $1.09-a-share loss, vs. a 13-cent loss a year ago and missing estimates by $1.25."" What MARA reported was a $20M net income or $0.21 EPS diluted. They came in right on target on projected earnings. IBD needs to be held accountable for the lies!!!"
Mara will have great earnings. Mining has been very good. and coins bought have a nice profit The big question: Are earnings going to be for share holders/company or for the board of directors again?
"After reading the Q2 earnings, the real game has just started with Mara, I'm expecting 2,000 minted BTC in Q3. Q1 2022 will be huge assuming BTC will be only $80k"
"Bitcoin already through the $43,000 barrier. The momentum is back and feels like new record highs only a matter of weeks away. Who knows $100k may be hit in 2021"
Citigroup (C) has become the latest entrant into the blockchain arena and is considering trading crypto futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
"TheBlockCrypto:“Marathon Digital buys another 30,000 bitcoin miners worth $120 million”“At bitcoin's current mining difficulty, that amount of hash rate is able to generate about 18 BTC in 24 hours theoretically, which are worth around $721,000.”"
Predictions for Monday opening and Monday close…….at opening I’ll say $37.24 and close I’ll say $38.81
"Higher lows forming intraday, looks to be setting up for a strong close today and into the rest of the week. Much better fundamentals here relative to RIOT."
"MARA one of the cheapest cost to mine btc??I have MARA's cost at $7k per coin, WHat miner has a lower cost. CLSK is the same, RIOT is like $20k"
"Sponsored Post: Marathon reportedly announced to participate in the Mining Disrupt Conference. Make better decisions for your future.

Incredible coordinated takedown of btc and mining stocks right now
"I already have mara and riot. I want to try to add a new stock related to btc, what’s y’all think about dmgi ?"

Yahoo updated price targets today Mara @50 and riot @47 lets go bulls
"MARA at this level is the Best Legal Steal you can have .... once Walmart, Amazon, ... all accept bitcoin as payments, ... Bitcoin flying above $60K again, you bet MARA will reach $60"
Do any of you guys see MARA as a dividend play down the road? With all the coin on the balance sheet I would think that they could give some back in a generous dividend.
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Multistockalerts.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Mara to now break $40 and then start a real run. Longs need to sit on there hands and add as we go. $75 by bird day
wheres Riaz
"If yesterday's stock price momentum isn't a good indication of what's yet to come, I do not know what else may convince others that this is a very bullish pattern for MARA. The way the stock is behaving lately is very clear -- lot's of, lot's of institutional buying on every deep. There is a lot of support in it while BTC is stable and is stuck in a temporary trading range."

Longs need to buy and hold. This is a $75 by bird day. Bitcoin fast becoming the norm. Mara maybe a takeover target. Add as we go. Big fish playing long.
"Broke out of the daimond pattern to the upside made a quik 8k today and holding my 10x leverage call, i love bitcoin baby#riot #mara #hive #hut #btbt #any #can #sos"
"If you had told me bitcoin would be back close to 50k and Mara under 40, I wouldn’t have believed you. This won’t last long. Be patient."
sure glad I bought the dip 3 days ago when it was trading under $27...sentiment has shifted now...
MARA should be the first company to pay a dividend in BTC.... media would have a field day
"Grossly cheap MARA's valuation.Check out the company web site non GAAP income next year will reach $1.26 billion/yearThe market cap now is only about 3 times that.At least 6 times IMHO, and if further expansion/purchasing now cheap rigs, and another double of bitcoin price, will likely cause MARA price to explode to $100 or $10 billion market cap. The company, with the current CEO's expertise all that, can further dive into other areas, DIFI, quantum computing, etc. etc."
"17 February 2021 - BTC was at $52,150 and MARA was at $47.90"
You can also see the hidden bullish divergence on the 5min. Could still break down put of the daimond pattern tho. Ta predicts 70 percents what is gonna happen. But thats the best chances you have. This is only a move for today tho for day traders in the weekend. I expect a massive pump upcoming week. Wyckoff accumilation almost 1/1.#btc #riot #mara #btbt #any #sos #can #hut
Correction ??? Whatever it is its up that matters !!!
What will be a good price to buy more?
Who is holding through earnings?

"Monday morning I wrote regarding bit coin, mentioned the repeated suppression by NBC, greedy politicians, tech companies, rhymes with Gahoo & Yoogle (not going to mention them - you figure it out). 3X tries to post. ( somehow it was blocked)the point was big events for Bit the media is over looking at that time :1) El Salvador National currency - this will be huge.2) Bank of America & JP Morgan offering to clients.3) Quizinos accepting ( not a huge deal but worth noting)4) Master Card 4) Whales accumulating ( previously we hit $40K & they sold)5) Infrastructure Bill ( dirty politicians wont acknowledge it - but will tax it. they will need it to succeed for their agenda).6) Texas - Displaced miners from China heading there. ( wonder why every company fortune 500 company is head quarter their)7) Miami Florida - started their own & wants to be bit coin headquarter.8) Hedge Funds increasing allocation to 7% ( keep in mind pension funds typical have 10% allocation to commercial real estate) Whales accumulating & El Salvador are the biggest catalyst for the rebound.

In the words of John Bender.... ""Eat my Shorts"" ) Shorts."
"Here we go. Just about to start breaking out again. The next move for both, BTC and MARA, is a quick, strong run up to $48k-50k and $38-40 per share levels respectively. In my opinion, of course."
They had some interesting insights about MARA on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"NCTY is officially in the NFT business, the good news just keeps rolling in :) Its go time NCTY just keeps pushing upward... When lambo? $mara $riot $btbt $mstr $ebon $sos $bitf $bfch $lglof $btsc $can $hvbtf"
"One of these weekends we will climb above $50K BTC price, and the catalyst can come from:Amazon acceptance, Tesla acceptance again, ETF, Argentina acceptance, etc. etc."
Mara passed Riot in Market share!! 
Haha just sold my 7 shares at $40 for a 100% gain best investment to date. I just wish I had more shares 
buy mara
"Anyone else read the Shawn Tully written - Fortune Magazine article on ""If BTC hits $500K, Mining BTC will produce more Carbon than Mexico and Brazil. All I can say is.... WOW!! What a bunch of complete BS!! There is no accounting for all the Green energy mining done with wind, solar and hydro in North America. It uses some alleged expert from Europe that supposedly tracks BTC carbon usage.... then Tully does a computation using some Carbon usage datapoint from the Euro guy, with no background or explanation given to it and claims that when BTC hits $500K after the 2024 halving that the carbon usage is going to exceed those countries mentioned. Unbelievably shoddy journalism and is an obvious hit piece on BTC."
"Dean, congrats on the LOAD UP at 31.25.Come back with your insights again. I got an additional dimes worth back at 30.60 and am now even for the first time in months. GLA"
"I LOVE U $MARA $RIOT, I LOVE U SOO MUCH. SO MUCH BABY GIRLLL!"
My guess: BTC will go up over the weekend and MARA will follow up next week.

"Today at some (start of the day) point there was 1,305,863 shortable shares and now 274,285. Shorties are working hard. Do they run out already today or tomorrow... interesting to see."
"the NON-GAAP income definition helps a lot in showing the true value of the stock. GAAP is not always suitable for each company. Besided that, I think MARA is currently undervalued when you compare it to RIOT. RIOTs current bitcoin production is roughly on the same level as MARA while MARA already has almost 3x more bitcoins on the balance sheet. The future looks bright for MARA because they have a lot of miners in order and there will soon be a wide gap between MARA and $RIOT in the amount of bitcoins mined per month. The market CAP of RIOT is currently higher what doesn't make sense in my opinion. I am buying extra at market open."

BTC looks like it should test 50k this weekend. I am glad the rise up has been slower with corrections
