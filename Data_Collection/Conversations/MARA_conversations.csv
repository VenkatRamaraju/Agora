"(Massive shorts squeeze to 58k incoming) Weekly bollinger bands have crossed, monthly already crossed and opening further. At the top of the descending broadening wedge, we also had two daimond patterns on the 30 min chart. This is gonna be the biggest boom to the upside. All this will happen today or over the weekend. Remember wyckoff. Targets exactly 46400 bounce off to 58k back to 50 and then boom to all time highs. Make calls of the 58k boom and puts back to 50k and then calls to all time highs. Technical analysis and will be respected. #btc #riot #mara #any #btbt #hut"
Btc broke out to the upside of the falling wedge with the target of 47200 exactly hit as the bottom in the formation. Bullish divergence now. Lets look for some upside the upcoming hour. #riot #mara #btbt #hut #any #sos #hive #can
Closing green today
"Just as a reminder this is nothing according to ta riot and mara could go to 59, and every other mining stock to all time highs in no time. This is a life oppertunity in earnings the most amount of money you ever made in a week.Dont respect me, respect technical analysis. Every bitcoin stock broke above their 200 moving average. And out of a descending broadening wedge. This is the beginning of the breakout. Every stock could pop easily with 40/50 percent#riot #mara #hut #any #btbt"
"I see people doubtfull on my twitter and comments even tho i speak truth and am a technical analysist for multiple people in real life. I post everything with facts. Its going to 58 over the weekend maybe even today. I posted why in recent posts. Again you can be doubtfull or not believed it but the stockmarket is not a place to believe thats how you lose money, with feelings. The chart is showing this, multiple indicators, harmonics, the rsi, the macd, bollinger band. If you sell now or short. Sure do, but your gonna lose money or the biggest profit of your life. There is a short oppurtinity cause the tatget of wyckoff will be 58k and then back to 50k. But this today is just the start. Remember i told everyone days ago. So do you trade stock because you believe or have feelings? Or do you trade because of facts? Im already rich this is also your chance. Call to 58k, put to 50k, call to ath. Just like i said days ago. I told you, dont respect me, respect ta(techincal analysis). Im not a cook or a carsalesman. This is my job#riot #mara #hut #btbt #any #btc"
Just getting started... $GBTC $ETHE $MARA $MSTR $RIOT $BITQ These have now grown to 8% of my portfolio. My strategy/discipline dictates that I trim a little.. back to 5% or so. I think the crypto proposition is different though. I'll hold until they grow so large it becomes uncomfortable. Any cannabis investors here?$TCNNF $CRLBF $CURLF $GTBIF $CCHWF $HRVSF $MSOS. ...not the Canadian cash burners (no offense to our Canadian friends)... the American market? The MSOs?
"MARA produced 25 Bitcoins per day on the 25th, 26th, 27th and 28th. On the 29th, it was 19 Bitcoins. It appears more miners have come online. There appeared to be significant down time in August and if August poduction cutoff date was Saturday the 28th, I have the month production at approximately 440 Bitcoins. Had there been less down time, they could have easily produced over 500 Bitcoins.Further, they moved 600 Bitcoins to a new custodial wallet in August. I expect to see more of this as their production rate increases.https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/3D72db1KMCnj7FL7MBsmxTw81z2bVu4UN5"
MARA is trading much stronger than bitcoin ... any reason why?
"Absolute historical bullish divergence on sos, short squeeze coming soon? I hope you bought the dip on the mining stocks#riot #mara #any #btbt #hut #can #sos #hive"
"Interesting, last night at 21:00 EDT approx., BTC at $49.3K begins stepping down $600. by near 22:00 EDT. Then for an hour at $48.7K until 23:00 EDT, it steps down again but this time it is about $1K to $47.7K by 00:15 EDT. Steady at roughly $47.8K, then at 0105 EDT, it steps down again but this time by $800 and stabilizes at $47K at 02:00 EDT. The interesting part is the clear steps an similar rate of decline in price each time. Very suspicious."
"Perfectly bounced off of 46400 according to wyckoff and the weekly descending broadening wedge, everyone who is bearish is wrong. Simple ta. Target really fast to 58k then back to 50k before bouncing to all time highs. #btc #riot #hut #mara #btbt #any"
"Marathon moved another 200.6 Bitcoins yesterday (the 24th), to the same digital address account as the day prior. Both deposits were 200 Bitcoins each, into the new account. It would be nice to get some explanation from them on what these moves are for. They are producing Bitcoin again in the old account. Almost 19 Bitcoins yesterday and near 13 today, so far."
Last time to buy at these prices#riot #mara #hut #btbt #any #sos #can #hive
"If bitcoin does anything today, Mara is ready to launch to new highs..."
"Btc breaking on of the small daimond to the upside and thus breaking out of the massive deacending broading, almost every other mining stock breaking out of their descending wedge. Massive pump possibly tomorrow or over the weekend target 58k. Buy now for your gains, remember i told you.#btc #riot #mara #any #btbt #hut"
$MARAI've owned RIOT and MARA and it is clear to me now that MARA is the better play.
Was skeptical a few weeks ago. Not anymore.
The real question is what price is Mara when Bitcoin hits 100k by end of year? Iâ€™d say 90-110. Depending on the surge and market manipulation
For everyone who bought calls im happy for your earnings big time. Wait till btc is at 58k for a put to 50k and then a call again to all time highs#btc #riot #mara #btbt #any #hut
"Something for MARA investors to consider moving forward: Plan B has been spot on. It stated in June, 2021 that August 2021 would have BTC close at $47k, September $43k, October $63k, November $98k and December $135k.With MARA looking to add 2,100 miners in 9/21, 6,000 in 10/21, 10,000 in 11/21 and 14,700 in 12/21 we should do very well as investors this year if Plan B is accurate. Of course next year and before the next halving in 2024 many analyst have a price target of $300k to $450k. In the first seven months of 2022 MARA will be adding 69,700 miners. Hopefully this bullish thesis holds true. If it does long term MARA holders will be richly rewarded."
