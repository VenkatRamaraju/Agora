"close to 52 wk low and still the div. is 1.3% .....it does not inspire or motivate....yes since 1961 is great....however,money moves faster now ....the thin div. ..in today's market motivates trading. not investing...after all I can buy a company that sells paper cups and straws at 20 a share and get 4%....aren't industrial budgets better margins the the lunch room....I'm just sayin"

The sad think about RBC’s analyst that his stock fell by 25% since February the 29th. How does he feel about Mr or Mrs. Putine?

"Went in/out 2 times (all in/out) in the past and made decent profits (30-50%). Since May in at average price of $3.20 (1800 stocks) - and those I am holding loooooooong (ie don’t care about these “small” fluctuations). Same thing for $NET, $AMZN, $MSFT, $RBC"

"Covid-19 is just getting started. Over the last week, the number of new cases expanded by 20% PER DAY. At that rate, the number of cases doubles every 3.6 days. Assuming a more conservative the18% growth rate, like in Italy, and cases doubling every 4 days, in 4 weeks it'll grow from 4,287 (I just checked at John Hopkins CSSE) to over 500,000 cases. $RBC is screwed."
This company is so Undervalued. Buy now while you can.
The Snow Clown is optimistic on this stock. We could see $175 by New Year's Day.

Still bullish on this stock by year end. I am not happy after the earnings report. Once the merger goes thru I hope things will get better on the stock price. Uncle Joe is not helping things. He should go back to the Shaddy Rest at Hotterville and nap on his cot.
