why is this stock such a piece of shet????
Don't underestimate the possibility that Venezuela may go to war with Guyana over its highly valuable oil territories. Venezuela(which is in dire economic straights) chased an Exxon ship out of those waters over the weekend. They have claimed those same territories for many years now.
This company needs new CEO and the rest of the board needs to go!!!!

"Is it time to make a move on HES? It certainly looks like it based on a insider ownership of 0.70%. check out aw-esomeSTOCKS, its a pretty reliable service. of course you have to do your own due diligence, but they generally point you in the right direction."
Buy Hess when it hits 40
"The GAAP losses are most likely due to hedge losses. Hedge losses are a double edged sword as they are opportunity losses but not cash losses. The hedges cause large GAAP losses, but the higher oil prices allow higher future hedges. Now, imagine new hedges at $70 vs $45. Some companies are not hedging much at all. Most analyst can see through these losses and realize that soon the oil companies realizations will go from $45 to $70 in a few quarters."
No one knows HES. It will be in every oil Investor’s portfolio by January. Has a big offshore rig coming in Jan 2022 and another one later. Gayana Gayana and more gayana.

"Exxon. Earnings up this last quarter and production is down. Just a matter of time before they go hunting for strategic bolt on's as they need volume/revenue to weather future downturns. Obviously HES is a logical target since it now trades at a discount the just the Guyana assets and they could sell off other parts of the HES portfolio they might not want. all this said, it is exxon so they would need to have 814 meetings before pulling the trigger!"

Do you guys know what happened in Saudi Arabia?????????????????????????? I guess not or you would be talking about it.
Will someone please Acquire this company. It’s market cap is only a measly 15 Billion dollars. It’s performance is horrible. Doesn’t Xom want to buy out it’s stake? Please new management already. I can’t even buy a Hess truck anymore. Whose wise idea was that to get rid of the gas stations?
This is just the beginning!!
"Extremely oversold! Apparently the market has not flushed out the panicking, timid losers that fail to realize that when oil spikes back up and will soon, HESS will be the #1 leader bouncing back w/ tremendous force. Should double by the end of the year."

HES is down 5.40% to 52.05
Surprised there's no reaction to the Guyana reduction in production
Seems like HES recent announcement regarding an increase in capex needs to be dialed back to put a floor under the share price. Obviously the same goes for many others as the 6 week $25 barrel implosion has materially changed expected Cashflow outlooks for all. I would venture to guess that given the debt fueled craze that has driven up permian production from 1mbpd to 3mbpd is over and rig counts start to come off without a material bounce back to $60-65 wti.
when was the last time this company had a profit? 10 years ago?

Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, called the ruling 'shocking' and noted that the pipeline is moving 570,000 barrels of Bakken oil a day."
Takeout price. I'd think $79-80 exxon takes them out. Should see M&A pick up in the sector after the washout we have had this month. long term fundamentals are solid.
We are set for nice spike tomorrow!

"WTI $50 and Midland diffs what?? -$10.00 bbl under wti. Seems like all the little guys are now underwater and will have to cut capex pronto as their debt fueled drill spree is coming home to roost. just remember, Trump slammed opec when they tried to jawbone some support when oil dropped to $60.00. nothin g like a president that screws his base one by one... famers, oil, who is next reits?"

"""Hess is one of the three companies that are leading that development, alongside Exxon (NYSE:$XOM) and CNOOC (NYSE:$CEO) from China. Of those three companies, Hess has the most relative exposure to Guyana because it’s just a smaller company. The production from Guyana will become immediately impactful from the standpoint of Hess financials.https://www.twst.com/interview/bullish-forecast-for-oil-prices-in-2019"

This could be a year end tax selling as traders lock in their profits and losses. On a day when oil is up 1.2% and the oil stocks are trending lower on average of 2% does not make too much sense.
Bailed yesterday. in at 68 and out at 53. trump injects too much uncertainty into the mkts now and opec(saudis/russians) could imploded shale producers given the credit bubble. bleh. best of luck to you all.

"ML "" The pull back in the broader market has left Hess back at levels that by our estimates,trades below the theoretical value of Guyana once self-funding threshold is met at end2021. By our estimates the implied value of the remaining (current) producing assets isthe lowest in the sector. Hess is back to being a deep value stock, but with one of thestrongest portfolio growth outlooks and free cashflow inflection in the sector, uniquelydefined by outsize leverage to Guyana. Reiterate Buy, PO unchanged at $86 per share($65 Brent basis).""EXXON would be smart to buy them and break it up keeping guyana."
