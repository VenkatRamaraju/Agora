DOES THIS COMPANY EVER MAKE MONEY?? SHOULD BE AT $35/SHAREMANIPULATION
"Last days of oil will be sweetest .... look for 10 to 15 $/Gal. as no new money comes in and world supplies shrink as future us electric....rwo trends. power Co. need natural gas and oil to make electric and need investment, but the uncertainty of gasoline marketing Gov green restrictions make it a boondoggle! Biden is best thing that happened for oil!"
Its time to short Hes 61 all the way down to 30This is too easy. I will short it and then buy it again at 30happy investing everyone.
HES is up 9.48% to 31.65
Where does oxy go now? EV here is 26b. $85+debt would be a reach here. So not probable.
Exxon would like to acquire HES . Think $75 is too cheap?
HES-PA reached a new All Time High at 68.49
No one knows HES. It will be in every oil Investor’s portfolio by January. Has a big offshore rig coming in Jan 2022 and another one later. Gayana Gayana and more gayana.
Takeout price. I'd think $79-80 exxon takes them out. Should see M&A pick up in the sector after the washout we have had this month. long term fundamentals are solid.
HES is up 11.31% to 36.71
"For those of you listening to Jim Cramer, this guy is a JokeRecently he said oil is un-investable, tonight the majority of his program was about buy buy buy oil and recommended many large and midsize oil companies"
"When Hes hits 38.50 I will buy, and sell at 65"
on fire today. maybe people are starting to understand the true upside of guyana. Let's go brandon!
anybody know why the pop in after hours?
A strong quarterly report this morning. Incredible potential in Guyana is going to carry this stock into the triple digits in the next few months in my opinion.
"Oil had its run, you should buy airlines stocks, buy AAL at 31 and sell at 42When AAL is at 42, sell and then buy Hess."
"I bought today at 38.50 I bought 3,000 shares. I will sell at 65"
"US District Judge James Boasberg ordered Dakota Access pipeline shut down.Boasberg ordered pipeline to be shut down and emptied within 30 days. Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, called the ruling 'shocking' and noted that the pipeline is moving 570,000 barrels of Bakken oil a day."
"Exxon. Earnings up this last quarter and production is down. Just a matter of time before they go hunting for strategic bolt on's as they need volume/revenue to weather future downturns. Obviously HES is a logical target since it now trades at a discount the just the Guyana assets and they could sell off other parts of the HES portfolio they might not want. all this said, it is exxon so they would need to have 814 meetings before pulling the trigger!"
30 pe .apache projected at 8 or less...BP is about 7...whats the rationale
Is Hess also a takeover target or it is too big to be considered?
Surprised there's no reaction to the Guyana reduction in production
"when hess hits 30.00 buy, buy buy and then sell at 60.00"
"Gte, oil and energy is coming back, calls a gold mine soonDtea, nkla, january tesla calls"
"The GAAP losses are most likely due to hedge losses. Hedge losses are a double edged sword as they are opportunity losses but not cash losses. The hedges cause large GAAP losses, but the higher oil prices allow higher future hedges. Now, imagine new hedges at $70 vs $45. Some companies are not hedging much at all. Most analyst can see through these losses and realize that soon the oil companies realizations will go from $45 to $70 in a few quarters."
its all about guyana! going to $70 any day now
Hess is down 4.93% to 84.77
Bag holders 
"So, when is XOM going to buyout HESS?"
Hess is up 13.05% to 49.82
Hess says they are going to buy back1 billion shares
Made a huge mistake selling at $59$70 is just around the corner
"""Hess is one of the three companies that are leading that development, alongside Exxon (NYSE:$XOM) and CNOOC (NYSE:$CEO) from China. Of those three companies, Hess has the most relative exposure to Guyana because it’s just a smaller company. The production from Guyana will become immediately impactful from the standpoint of Hess financials.https://www.twst.com/interview/bullish-forecast-for-oil-prices-in-2019"
where is this stock is heading ???
Bought a small position. 66.95
Buy Hess when it hits 40
Next stop for HES is $70.
Better slash capex for Bakken or they are going back to $40.00
selling way over done
