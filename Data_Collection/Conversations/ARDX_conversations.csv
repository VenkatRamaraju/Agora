there is 100% chance of the approval in horizon and this is known to the big guys already.. just see the price action today .. buy it at these levels and enjoy the ride
LONG and $3k STRONG.
I think TRIL acquisition by PFE lifted all biotech boats today

"What does line 123 - 127 from ""Information Requests and Discipline Review Letters Under GDUFA Guidance for Industry""imply for ARDX.""FDA will not issue a DRL if its issuance would delay or coincide with the issuance of a CRL. Applicants should not construe either the absence of a DRL for a particular discipline or a DRL for a particular discipline with no identified deficiencies to mean that the CRL will not contain any deficiencies for that discipline. Comments in a DRL will usually reflect the input of the review team but not the input from all supervisory levels."""
"EXTON, Pa., July 27, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- In reaction to major market events over the past several months, analysts at Spherix recently captured an increasingly negative sentiment towards the US FDA – included in a new Special Topix report offered by the market intelligence firm. According to Paul Zimmerman, Vice President of Insights at Spherix, ""As an independent voice responsible for bringing to light the experience and opinions of community physicians, we have been hearing rumblings over the past several weeks questioning recent FDA activity. We decided to survey a broader number of specialists and the results are not favorable.""A survey of 252 specialists in dermatology, gastroenterology, nephrology, neurology, and rheumatology, fielded on July 25, revealed confidence in the FDA is swiftly dwindling. Only 36% express a high level of assurance in the agency, with nearly one-half reporting that their confidence with the FDA has eroded in the past year. Sentiment is most negative as it relates to being unbiased/apolitical, the speed of New Drug Application (NDA) reviews, and transparency with the medical community. The dissatisfaction seems to stem from unpredictable and unexpected moves from the agency, which differ by specialty.The regulatory decision resulting in the approval of Biogen's Aduhelm (aducanumab) for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, following a ""no"" vote by the Advisory Committee, has left neurologists especially frustrated – reflected in more than 80% stating their confidence has decreased. The approval of Aduhelm is fraught with questions regarding how involved industry was in the decision to override the Advisory Committee's recommendation against approval.According to one respondent, ""The erosion [of my confidence] is based on the disastrously bad decision to approve aducanumab, which seems like a poorly developed and even possibly corrupt decision. I cannot remember a similar situation in which there was so much dismay and disbelief created by an FDA decision. We do not plan to use aducanumab at this time and we no longer know what to think about and how much to trust any future FDA decisions.""Nephrologists are not far behind in their dismay and disappointment, struggling with recent events that are likely to keep two novel therapeutics, Fibrogen/AstraZeneca's roxadustat and Ardelyx's tenapanor, from reaching patients. Sheldon Shore, MD, a practicing nephrologist in Atlanta weighed in, ""The FDA needs to work harder to help us get these new drugs approved for use in our patients. I feel it has gotten too political, making it harder and harder for new drugs to get approved.""Despite the controversy surrounding the potential approvals, more than half of surveyed nephrologists indicate they very much want to see tenapanor approved and approximately one-third say the same for roxadustat; less than five percent are against the approval of either drug. In fact, regarding the approval of roxadustat for non-dialysis and dialysis patients with CKD-related anemia, 44% agree that they would rather see an approval contingent on a post-marketing study then a denial and requirement of additional clinical trials.Among specialists treating autoimmune conditions, the seemingly unending scrutiny of the JAK inhibitors is raising questions about the review process the FDA is employing for several agents (AbbVie's Rinvoq, Eli Lilly's Olumiant, Pfizer's abrocitinib, and Incyte's ruxolitinib). These reviews have been extended on multiple occasions as the FDA evaluates results from ORAL Surveillance, a five-year post-marketing safety study on Pfizer's Xeljanz ordered by the FDA when it first approved the drug for rheumatoid arthritis in 2012.Over two-thirds of rheumatologists and dermatologists agree that the FDA should focus on each JAK individually as opposed to considering the post-marketing data from Xeljanz's ORAL surveillance trial in relation the pending approvals of other agents within the class. One rheumatologist commented, ""The delays have a negative impact on doctors and patients in the real world who are struggling to manage harmful diseases. We need direction and soon."""
Most likely outcome is the FDA will provide them a CRL. That will add another 14 months minimum to getting back into the PDUFA 90 day game. Either way the company will need to let their saleforce go as they cannot afford the cash burn and need to extend their runway. Hard to find a silver lining at this point.
We end up in green for two days in a row. It would be good to be like that today. So let's all buy some more stock. Together we can do it.Green today 
Does anyone know: how big a reduction of phosphorus levels is achieved by current available treatments versus what Tenapanor achieves. This seems to me the big question and I haven't found an answer in reading the papers or posters published about Tenapanor. Thanks
Did anyone get info on quarterly earnings report?
Things could be worse. Both ITRM and SESN are below a buck.
This should be at $2 today

It pump up on purpose! I'm waiting to add more at $1.20 to average down....
I don’t understand why law firms are always after small companies and they do nothing with the Big techs.
It looks like the future is very bright fir ARDX. Could someone please inform ARDX management of this so we can see them buying some shares with their own cash!
We ended green!!! We are nearly millionaires!!!!
fda approval is now very much confirmed and this should be at 3$ levels as a fair range.
"My friend lost all his savings on the USA stock exchange in 2020. He was also ill, He died earlier this year. Super rich people and speculative funds were making money while we were closed due to the pandemic, small businesses were failing and we were losing jobs. ARDX is a victim of such a policy. Policies that do not care about people and a corrupt FDA. I’ve been along with USA youth from Robinhood and Reddit all along. I am a father of three children and I am proud to have participated with them to save GME, AMC ...I am sure that USA youth will recognize ARDX and do the same thing as with GME, AMC ... My son is a doctor, my daughter is a doctor, my other daughter is a lawyer. Many of my friends in Switzerland will also start buying ARDX shares with us from today. I also invited USA youth from Robinhood and Reddit to join us.50,000 people die because of speculative funds and the corrupt FDA. Let's stop that. Together. Buy and hold."
"I cannot believe this system; “ Ardelyx needs ""to conduct an additional adequate and well-controlled trial demonstrating a clinically relevant treatment effect on serum phosphorus or an effect on the clinical outcome thought to be caused by hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on dialysis."" The clinical outcome thought to be caused by hyperphosphatemia? Dr. Silva; “Lowering serum phosphorus is a priority for me in managing my patients on dialysis, and is an established standard of care driven by the peer-reviewed globally accepted KDIGO clinical practice guidelines.

"Well, that was fun."
"I was doing some sleuthing... It's been hypothesized by some that the company may try to market Tenapanor for it's approved indication in the USA. (IBS-C) I was somewhat hopeful when I heard this rumor as it would be an additional source of revenue for the company and might help them get to a place where they could get the Hyperphosphatemia indication (without diluting shares). I checked www.ibsrela.com and it appears that someone bought the website and is trying to sell it... This really isn't definitive proof of anything, but it seems to me that if the company had the intention of marketing for IBS-C they would have at least purchased that domain name..."

"Ardelyx Receives Complete Response Letter from U.S. FDA for New Drug Application for Tenapanor for the Control of Serum Phosphorus in Adult Patients with CKD on DialysisBY PR Newswire— 4:01 PM ET 07/29/2021FREMONT, Calif. and WALTHAM, Mass., July 29, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Ardelyx, Inc. , a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative first-in-class medicines to improve treatment for people with kidney and cardiorenal diseases, today announced that it has received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the company's New Drug Application (NDA) for tenapanor for the control of serum phosphorus in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis.Ardelyx logo (PRNewsFoto/Ardelyx)According to the CRL, while the FDA agrees that ""the submitted data provide substantial evidence that tenapanor is effective in reducing serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis,"" they characterize the magnitude of the treatment effect as ""small and of unclear clinical significance."" Additionally, the FDA noted that for the application to be approved, Ardelyx (ARDX) needs ""to conduct an additional adequate and well-controlled trial demonstrating a clinically relevant treatment effect on serum phosphorus or an effect on the clinical outcome thought to be caused by hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on dialysis."" There were no safety, clinical pharmacology/biopharmaceutics, CMC or non-clinical issues identified in the CRL.The FDA indicated it is willing to meet with Ardelyx to discuss options for obtaining approval. To that end, the company intends to request a Type A meeting as soon as possible to discuss the CRL and determine potential paths forward for the approval of tenapanor for the control of serum phosphorus in adult patients with CKD on dialysis.""We are saddened by this communication from the FDA and what it means for the patients and the physicians who treat them,"" said Mike Raab, president and chief executive officer of Ardelyx (ARDX). ""We continue to believe tenapanor represents an important, first-in-class treatment option for patients with elevated phosphorus. We do not agree with the FDA's subjective assessment on the clinical relevance of the treatment effect of tenapanor in our studies which met all clinical endpoints agreed upon by the FDA. In our view, the serum phosphorus lowering data generated with tenapanor in all of our clinical studies is meaningful and clinically significant. We will work with the agency to address the issues raised and, to the extent possible, find an expeditious path forward.""Arnold Silva, M.D., Ph.D., director of Clinical Research at Boise Kidney and Hypertension Institute, added, ""Lowering serum phosphorus is a priority for me in managing my patients on dialysis, and is an established standard of care driven by the peer-reviewed globally accepted KDIGO clinical practice guidelines. Years of research have demonstrated the negative consequences associated with even slight elevations in serum phosphorus. Despite our best efforts with currently available therapies, managing phosphorus remains a significant challenge. We need new tools. I've closely followed the extensive clinical development of tenapanor, not only as an interested nephrologist, but also as a clinical investigator. I've seen the clinical benefits of tenapanor first-hand in my patients and I'm stunned that the FDA is not granting approval of this novel mechanism drug, despite extensive clinical data demonstrating its safety and efficacy.""""Neither peritoneal nor hemodialysis provides adequate control of serum phosphorus, obligating the use of medications,"" said Glenn Chertow, M.D., M.P.H., division chief of nephrology and professor of medicine at Stanford University. ""Unfortunately, phosphate binders – individually or in combination – rarely yield consistent control of serum phosphorus concentrations, and persistent hyperphosphatemia leads to dystrophic calcification, accelerated arteriosclerotic vascular disease, fractures, and other complications that profoundly affect patients' lives. The effect of tenapanor on serum phosphorus observed in the Phase 3 trials is clinically meaningful. Tenapanor would enable a substantially larger fraction of patients to reach target serum phosphorus concentrations and would yield significant clinical benefit to this vulnerable population.""The NDA for tenapanor for the control of serum phosphorus is supported by a comprehensive development program involving more than 1,000 patients and included three Phase 3 clinical trials, all of which met their primary and key secondary endpoints. At the end of the second quarter ended June 30, 2021, Ardelyx (ARDX) had $171.8 million in cash and cash equivalents (unaudited).Conference Call DetailsThe company will host a conference call today, July 29, 2021, at 5:00 PM ET to discuss today's announcement.

"This stock has the jitters because the company has let two ER dates slip by without any explanation at all. Radio silence. It will continue to drift lower until they release the ER. If you have confidence, average down. If not, bail out soon. As for me, I averaged down yesterday. We will see where it goes today."
"Bigger bribe, bigger share price....that's what FDA wants a bigger piece of the pie...every sector of government and private sector have been corrupted by greed and politics...."
"I can’t help but muse. People wonder why drugs are so expensive… in this case it will be the FDAs fault. As a drug that already has an approved indication, safety wasn’t even an issue. Efficacy was shown in the studies. If this had been approved and it turned out it didn’t work well, no doctor would prescribe it. It would be essentially off the market in 1-2 years. Now if this drug does help people, then the FDA has increased the cost with another study. Not to mention cost to patients it may have helped."
"All these stocks which recently got FDA CRL are at a 52-week low, except $SESN, is $SESN heading in the same direction as well?$SPPI, $ARDX, $ETON, $PRVB, $PLX, $ORPH, $MDWD, $ITRM, $FGEN, $CRMD, $ATXI, $ATNX, $ACAD"
Reading in between the very optimistic posts and the bashers. I’m going to guess we bounce around this level for a while.
I am suspicious something is going on that has nothing to do with “the science”
This process has cost me some serious money. Set me back years. It was a set up. No way you spend months negotiating the label the turn and make a BS claim the endpoint doesn’t matter. I am furious at myself and the FDA for their corrupt people. ARDX is the victim here.
"this was a just big agreementand game between ardex and FDA guys to make dip price and buy huge of shares cheap and sell so high , dont you see volum everyday. they are so smart and money imoprtant for them"
"Ive been on this thread forever. I am super pregnant $ardx. Added 30% to the position last couple of days.My thought on ""trading"" this stock from short side. From time to time, being short a little Ardelyx might be a good trade for a nimble and experienced hedge fund desk.You can scalp it periodically for 25/50/75 cents.... like last week.But on balance, for that community to be short 9mm shares. That is what they call a crowded short. Way to crowded for how marginal the scalping opportunities are in the stock.Now.... read these recent threads... misinformation, psych ops etc by both paid agents and amateur phukkery artists.This pervasive negativity on the thread ALWAYS occurs at rally points with this stick.Which makes sense, because we are less than 2 weeks from PDUFA on a very straightforward solution into a $1bn plus plus market that a chimpanzee could understand. A solution that is already FDA approved.No martha stewart, no convertible debs, no felons, no hedge fund guy from ""Billions"". No its not KDMN. Its $Ardx. No drama.Just let it ride and enjoy the trip."
I am not going to make the same mistake I made with BCRX.I bought it at $1.50 and sold at $2.50 last year....it is almost $18 now :(
"This is crazy! After the news came out, within minutes was up 30 cents @ $1.75 and now it's negative!!"
"Sorry to see what happened here. Looks like the FDA is in bed with big pharma. This should have been approved.I think it is too risky to invest in this at this time. There will be significant dilution, especially when the $50M loan is likely to be called in a few months."
Selling done?
"FDA again ...sounds similar ?...“As part of the ongoing review of our NDA for AXS-05, the FDA recently notified us that they have identified deficiencies that preclude labeling discussions at this time. We are attempting to learn the nature of these deficiencies with the goal of addressing them, however, this development may lead to a delay in the potential approval of AXS-05. We will keep you informed as we learn more,” said Herriot Tabuteau, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Axsome."
Ardx needs to put something out soon about type A meeting with fda and where that stands. Until then we will slowly trickle down which is hard to stomach
"In my opinion bad news is baked in. It may fall 10-20 percent and quickly bounce back. But if there is a hint of good news there won’t be enough shares for the shorts to cover. Could gap up. I like the risk reward here. 25,000 at $1.59 , just added 10,000 at $1.67 and am willing to buy 40,000 more on a serious dip. Good luck to all."
"From Nazdaq;Ardelyx management has said that if the remedy required will take longer than 3-6 months, the company is likely to appeal."
when is the earnings date. is it on the 17th or 9th? how come its not on investor relations web
call in the EMT we need to revive this stock ARDX hold on baby!!!! Do not die on me
"When Tenapanor can prolong your life - is this a clinically relevant treatment effect?Chronic kidney disease therefore represents a valuable indication for Ardelyx. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 15% of adults in the United States — equivalent to 37 million people — are living with the illness, though most are undiagnosed.And for many patients, available treatments don't always work sufficiently, which can open the door to major health issues. Too much phosphorous in the blood, for example, can lead to weakened muscles and a buildup of calcium deposits, which may then put patients at increased risk of cardiovascular complications like heart attack, stroke or death. ""Despite our best efforts with currently available therapies, managing phosphorus remains a significant challenge. We need new tools,"" said Arnold Silva, director of Clinical Research at Boise Kidney and Hypertension Institute, in the statement from Ardelyx.""I've closely followed the extensive clinical development of tenapanor, not only as an interested nephrologist, but also as a clinical investigator,"" Silva added.

"I generally think the shareholder lawsuit ambulance chasers are irrelevant at best, annoying at worst, but when I see a company give its CEO 250K options at $0.54 immediately after a staggering collapse of shareholder value and the termination of over 1/3 of employees, I'm glad somebody is trying to hold the F-in company accountable. All those people fired and Raab, who already collects a decent salary, gets a fresh pot of gold. What a Gilded Age..."

"I feel like we are pretty undervalued here. Look at some other companies with drugs that are still in PH2. I'm going to pick on ACRS since it was recently mentioned on this board... they had 266million cash as of last report and some PH2 and discovery candidates and are valued at about 800m. To be sure ARDX has had a big set back, but is probably just as close to getting a drug approved as ACRS... and currently 1.42/share. Full disclosure, I'm a bag holder who has been averaging down from $7... Currently under $4 and hoping to get it a little lower."
what's everyone's cost basis? :D
"After the CC, one is left with the idea the FDA has a huge problem. They basically moved the posts AFTER Ardelyx scored an amazing goal. I hope that they will ask for a review of the process & dispute the outcome. Law firm (and investigative journalists) should probably sue the FDA for dereliction of duty, not Ardelyx. This is definitely not the end of the story and after the type A meeting I would not be surprised if tbis ended up into a formal review and possibly someone in the FDA being fired for stupidly preventing a rapid approval of a life-saving drug which met ALL clinical endpoints in trials the FDA itself help to design and previously agreed upon. The FDA has a big, big problem"
"What I don’t understand is how the issue of labeling can hold up a drug that could save thousands of live monthly. I read 50,000 annual deaths primarily dueto phosphate accumulation. Reviewing the trial results I am still unable to understand what is preventing approval. No ambiguous data there. The FDA needs to be restructured as it would seem they are unable to accomplish their objectives."
"OMG. Here to go another bio-tech paper company. Going to follow $FBRX, $ADVM, $ARDX. Stay away or short. Don't catch falling knife."

There's the nut of it: FDA is pivoting from using serum phosphorous as relevant biomarker
Don't hold your breadth for new info from FDA on this earnings call - whenever it is. They will not have any news until after their meeting with the FDA in roughly 60 days or so.
What was the motivation for the FDA to announce the probable loss of approval from Tenapanor before pdufa date?There was no need for.
who's doubling down on this
"I would speculate that the FDA is getting some heat over this CRL. 50,000 die annually in the US yet the FDA questions if it’s a problem.,,,?"

i'm down 18% on this. should i be worried?
Tenapanor for Hyperphosphatemia will be approved by FDA at the latest by the end of next year!
"This will most likely be used off-label, if not approved, by nephrologists. The terribly sad part is that insurance companies in the U.S. will not pay for it without an FDA indication. Most of these patients are Medicare aged. Medicare is a government mandated insurance program for anyone over 65, Medicaid, also a government insurance plan, covers anyone with kidney disease who is under 65. The FDA is a government entity. Affordable medical care is NOT in the government’s best interest. The longer we live, the longer we collect Social Security and add cost to the Medicare program. Do you see how socialized medicine works? It’s in the government’s best interest if we die before, or just after, turning 65.Tenapenor prolongs the life of people who require a lot of resources from the government coffers. How can they purchase private jets and Golden toilet seats if the largest population age group lives much past 65?"
"""We are saddened by this communication from the FDA and what it means for the patients and the physicians who treat them,"" Mike Raab, president and CEO of Ardelyx, said in the release. ""We continue to believe tenapanor represents an important, first-in-class treatment option for patients with elevated phosphorus.”Ardelyx submitted an NDA for tenapanor in June 2020. In April 2021, the company said the FDA extended the Prescription Drug User Fee Act date to July 29, following the submission of additional analyses.“We do not agree with the FDA's subjective assessment on the clinical relevance of the treatment effect of tenapanor in our studies which met all clinical endpoints agreed upon by the FDA,” Raab said in response to the FDA letter. “In our view, the serum phosphorus lowering data generated with tenapanor in all of our clinical studies is meaningful and clinically significant. We will work with the agency to address the issues raised and, to the extent possible, find an expeditious path forward.""There were no safety, clinical pharmacology/biopharmaceutics or non-clinical issues identified in the complete response letter, Raab said. Clinical trials for tenapanor included 1,000 patients and three phase 3 clinical trials, all of which met primary and key secondary endpoints, according to the release.Raab said the FDA indicated in the letter it is willing to meet with Ardelyx to discuss the application.Arnold Silva, MD, PhD, director of clinical research at Boise Kidney and Hypertension Institute, said in the release, “I've seen the clinical benefits of tenapanor first-hand in my patients and I'm stunned that the FDA is not granting approval of this novel mechanism drug, despite extensive clinical data demonstrating its safety and efficacy.""https://www.healio.com/news/nephrology/20210817/fda-ardelyx-phosphorus-control-drug-tenapanor-lacks-clinical-significance"
Next week is gonna bad. Be ready
"Let's take a sober look at the company. In 2017, after a sharp drop in 4 (!) Times due to questions about side effects for the approval of tenapanor with irritated bowels, it cost $ 4. At that time, research on hyperphosphorathemia was even just beginning. And now it is only about $ 1.4 - this is a manipulation"
I was on the cc. Raab will decide if appeal is best after type A but sounds like long road...I'm afraid FDA set up an impossible puzzle for ARDX to solve for. Maybe PH4 can provide input but FDA probably already got a peak in April and said so what...The big boys will always win if you try to take their marbles and I believe probably what happened here. Raab's best option is to sell the company for $400M and let the big boys have it..it will be approved and patients will benefit quicker...Sorry Raab but that's just the way it is...I still have my position and will wait another 60 days to see what happens...good luck longs...time for a drink...
"I’ll just say Good Luck today. By the end of the day we should have some clarity on what the path forward looks like. Even if news is somehow worse than expected, I think it will just present a buying opportunity. But the shorts will be out in droves to tell you the next stop is zero. I will buy if it drops! Holding what I have for the long haul!"
"This has to be the biggest fiasco in the biotech world far beyond anyone could have conceived. There are questions galore:The company had conducted three P3 trials with solid results, meeting the primary and key secondery end points.The NDA was accepted and a PDUFA date was givenThere was another communication in April whereby FDA sought more data.Presentations/ published articles and discussions by KOLs had been positive.Analysts were on-board.So what went so wrong that FDA is pointing deficiencies and not even ready to talk. Or is this a big misstep by the management.Very distressing to say the least."
It’s definitely going to be a while before we see it going back up !! But it will go up !!!!
"The only news I see the last few weeks is all those Law firms, about a dozen of them. Do they really have a case?"
Now that the oligarchs have take 1/2 of the company on the cheap the drug will find a path to approval. Isn't corruption wonderful.
Pink slips have gone out. I will be interested to see how many employees are still on the roster. How far will the new payroll take them?
This determination will be overturned and the drug will be approved. The FDA claiming lowering of serum phosphates may or may not help the patient is Absurd!
Wow! Appeal was submitted to FDA! This is gonna run today!
"After reading the trial results of Tenapanor I think one of the problems with FDA may be a mono labeling as this drug was studied as a combination with othe phosphate lowering agents. If this the case then there is some hope for this stock,"
Can't talk about the corruption the system immediately removes your post
"Interesting Case Study . Can something like this happen for ARDX. see belowIn stunning reversal, FDA clears Sarepta DMD drug it rejected 4 months agoby Angus Liu | Dec 13, 2019 10:03amThe FDA’s attitude toward Sarepta Therapeutics’ Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) therapies is nothing short of dramatic. In just four months, the agency shocked industry watchers twice, first with a rejection and now a reversal for the biotech’s Exondys 51 follow-on.Out of nowhere, the agency Thursday granted accelerated approval to Sarepta’s Vyondys 53 (golodirsen), a drug it turned down in August for safety reasons. The go-ahead covers about 8% Duchenne patients whose dystrophin gene bears a certain mutation amenable to exon 53 skipping.While the FDA didn’t elaborate on the sudden change of course, Sarepta said it had launched a formal dispute resolution request after receiving the agency's complete response letter (CRL) detailing its reasons for the rejection. Sarepta worked with Peter Stein, director of the FDA's Office of New Drugs, to resolve the concerns raised in that CRL.In August, a stunned Sarepta said the FDA had rejected Vyondys 53 for the risk of infection linked to intravenous infusion ports and for kidney toxicity seen only in animal studies. Analysts suspected at the time that the agency had changed its standards on using dystrophin as a surrogate marker for approval. DMD patients lack dystrophin, a protein that helps maintain the structure of skeletal muscle fibers, due to missing exons in the DMD gene.Controversy erupted in 2016 when Sarepta’s Exondys 51 won an FDA thumbs-up based on dystrophin data without showing actual clinical benefits such as improvement on disease progression. Opinions were split even within the FDA; in fact, two officials who'd opposed the green light decided to retire. In contrast, European regulators shot down Exondys 51 last September—for the second time.Like Exondys 51, Vyondys 53 was approved based only on dystrophin production “that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit” in DMD patients, the FDA said in a statement—not on proven clinical improvements. In a small clinical trial, 25 patients on Vyondys 53 saw 1.02% of normal dystrophin production after 48 weeks of treatment, up from 0.1% at baseline."
"I actually had the treatment 45 days ago and a large years old arm wart is gone. Interesting procedure, 98% painless, easy and I sat there just thinking of all the hopeful applications for the future. Day 1 of my procedure the stock was $17.00 and change and I've waited to see my results. I'm going in long on Monday. GLTA"
It's time for some PR ARDX!
"FDA is a SCAM. On the one hand, they say the submitted data provide substantial evidence that drug is effective. On the other hand, they think the magnitude of the treatment effect as small and of unclear clinical significance. IT DOESN’T MAKE SENSE."
FDA has never (previously) asked for outcome study for phosphorous-lowering treatments...
Averaged down to 1.85 now…. Surely this has to bounce back at some point right?
"Form 4 posted... Raab gets himself nearly 268,000 re-priced options for shares at an exercise price of $0.54..."
Sometimes silence is bad and some fraud/cover-up is happening behind the scenes. Sometimes silence is wise and they are planning for something positive and disclose once the dust settles...Let's give them some time to come up with a plan ... I have a positive feeling for this company and don't think they are dishonest... just because CEO sold shares doesn't mean its negative. It can be for various reasons like tax management etc.. Also just because he got a .58 options doesn't mean he don't care or price is going that low. That .58 number might be some math like x% discount of current share price...I don't know...just my thought

There is a 77% awareness in anticipation of approval. Doctors were anticipating a new standard of care. To hold up this drug when 50k die a year from phosphate accumulation is criminal. The FDA is no longer functioning as it should.
Again to the spiritually limited of you. The worst + insolvency has already been taken into account. A recovery has not yet taken place. We're over-sold.
"If you are thinking about playing the bounce, just check out these other bio stocks which also got FDA rejection: $AKBA, $ITRM, $ARDX, $ADVM"
"This is what’s called ‘capitulation’. Still wondering why management isn’t buying at such low pps … not really, I think I know why not."
Best case is a conditional approval but I doubt it. Next would be a request for additional data and analysis. Finally the worst case would be another trial.
"To $30! Just waiting on the FDA, theyre slower than molassis unless their dealing with big money and political pressure. With enough bribes, they’ll approve the clinical use of snake oil and gmo foods. It’s pretty absurd they gave a bogus CRM to ARDX denying approval of Tenapanor for clinical use. ARDX has Tenapanor, a sage and effective drug that have been clinically demonstrated to lower serum Phosphorus levels in patients suffering from renal failure."
 today? We are up 1 penny in pre!
"Based on my own DD I will pass on this company. I like the fundamentals treating CKD and high ownership of shares by institutions including blackrock and vanguards. But the recent FDA issue, layoffs and law suit IMO its not worth taking the risk at this time. GLTA"
Green??? What just happened????
"People are misreading the PR - it is *not* a labeling issue. The deficiencies *preclude discussion* of labeling and post-marketing… because it can’t be approved… because there are fundamental problems with the data, such that the FDA is questioning the benefit of the drug candidate (“a key issue is the size of the treatment effect and its clinical relevance”)"
"According to the CRL, while the FDA agrees that ""the submitted data provide substantial evidence that tenapanor is effective in reducing serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis,"" they characterize the magnitude of the treatment effect as ""small and of unclear clinical significance."" Additionally, the FDA noted that for the application to be approved, Ardelyx needs ""to conduct an additional adequate and well-controlled trial demonstrating a clinically relevant treatment effect on serum phosphorus or an effect on the clinical outcome thought to be caused by hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on dialysis."" There were no safety, clinical pharmacology/biopharmaceutics, CMC or non-clinical issues identified in the CRL. The drug most likely will be approved."

"I’m trying to keep a level head, hard since I lost so much. I don’t have a lot of hope that anything but a Crl is coming. I just find it sad that the fda worked hand in hand with fda to design these trials, only to get questioned on “is this something worth even approving”. I don’t like how the fda is deciding what they deem as a useful treatment or not…they should be looking at efficacy and safety. I understand they mentioned efficacy here too, but I’m not buying it. The trials all showed efficacy and were of big enough populations. There’s more to this story, but we may never know what. Regardless I what should happen or what I believe, I fear we are getting a Crl on the 29th and I have to live and learn not to have so much confidence in any one company. Sorry to others in my boat.

"The SEC and the FDA are supporting the criminals in the stock market and the drug market. The SEC chairman's husband is a hedge fund manager and surprise surprise surprise ARDX gets a new requirement out of no where. An extra 100 plus million shares are issued the hedge shorters make hundreds of millions and the oligopolies gets a piece of the pie on the cheap. Only down side is 15,000 additional dead patients."
"Yesterday the institutions held at the close. No buying, no selling. There are three new price targets from Jeffries, Wedbush, and Piper Sandler. They are:$2 (no increase, no gain)$3 (50% increase from today’s open)$4 (100% increase from today’s open)What will they do?"
"Here's one of the studies method... Some people keep saying it wasn't studied alone... but it was: Methods In this phase 3 randomized, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned patients with hyperphosphatemia receiving maintenance hemodialysis to receive twice-daily oral tenapanor (3, 10, or 30 mg [the latter down-titrated, if needed]) for 8 weeks. Patients were then rerandomized 1:1 to receive either their previously assigned dose or placebo for a 4-week ‘withdrawal’ period. We measured serum phosphate levels over the course of the trial. The primary end point was mean change in serum phosphate over the 4-week withdrawal period for the tenapanor group (using pooled data) versus the placebo group."
bought at 1.6$ gonna wait as long till it explode
"Well, here we are post CRL. So now what...I see 3 scenarios post Type A meeting result early Oct. Scenario 1: New trail 90% chance. Potential approval 2024/25. $150M needed to fund so probably +100M in shares and any LT shareholder gains will be cut ½ from prior expecting 2021 approval (ie $5 PPS in 2025). Not sure what they do with IBS-C so may help cut dilution.Scenario 2: Quick solution 5% chance. Somehow ARDX can find a way to work out a deal w/o trial over next 6-12mo. No dilutionScenario 3: FDA appeal/ADcom 5% chance. ARDX goes nuclear so forces the issue the medical community. If it works when approval mid 2022 but if it fails they poison the FDA well…not that it’s a great friendship anyway. Probably $50M dilution needed due to unknown outcome.Except for SC#2 not great hope for LT shareholder gains. If Raab wants to max value and get this to market he would pursue a BO and see what Type A results...If trial then sell it now for $4-5 as the result will be $5 PPS in 2025 anyway (w/o TVM) per above. I suspect Raab (as most CEO) it’s about keeping a $3M/yr comp comin and not about shareholder/patients. So for Raab it’s $12M in comp by 2025 with LT shareholders gain $0 return or lose another 75% from here….good luck…"
"It’s getting hard to find comments worth reading on here. People are either pumping or telling you the sky will fall. My take, we can definitely go lower… 7/29 and a CRL would push us down a bit.

FDA must be investigated not ARDX. I no longer have shares in the company as I sold my entire stake on the day the stock crashed into $2 took a huge loss with an average of $7.5. But I continue to strongly believe in the company.The eventual FDA approval is imminent but the agency is dragging that process thus harming patients who can benefit from the drug. In short FDA is robbing the company of its well deserved approval.Those with disposable cash and patience to wait for another 8 months will be wise to buy now. I wished I had the disposable cash to keep my patience.
It's better to buy shares
Target price $14.14 STRONG BUY said by the experts...Let's goooo!!!
"Price action today is irrelevant. I’ve loaded the boat with 25,000 shares at $1.59 and I sit and wait. See you gentlemen at $12 whether it be in one month or 5 years, it will print."

Still five days for er.I told y
"Waiting for CKD community to rally behind ARDX. Pressure by patients, families and medical community has changed FDA decisions before. See Amicus (FOLD) approval for galafold some years ago, even though they missed one of their primary endpoint."
Back to $7 soon
Quiet today
Red again? It's amazing how everyone sells at a loss and the share can never recover! Irony out! Somebody else is being kidding
"I have experienced good and bad in the past. This is far from the best and worst of situations. My unprofessional thoughts:1. The recent news has prices in a CRL and is over corrected based on share price before tenapenor.2. ARDX is heavily shorted, and any good news lifting the shares will be magnified due to a short squeeze.3. ARDX is >90% institutionally held which offers a bit of a safety net.4. Tenapenor will be approved in other countries for phosphatemia.5. Ardelyx has more cash in hand than its market cap.All of this leads me to believe that we should fair better over the next 12 months."
Earnings release tomorrow.
No more money left. FDA please approve Tenapanor for god sake. It's hurting now
Seems to be a good long term entry point today.
Easy buy and hold for me at these levels. Low risk and high reward! Liking the odds.

Hi. I’ve seen a few comments about a 150mm secondary stock offer. Anyone have a link with specifics?
"Shares don’t expire. That’s why I bought 25,000 at $1.59 , if it goes lower tomorrow I’ll buy 50,000 and then sit and wait. No problem here"
" What has happened for the SP to jump from $0.7 to $2.1 was a typical quick short covering by hedge funds. But the real ""Blood bath"" will take place on next week after everyone reads the CRL carefully and know that FDA requires at lease 2 years of new trails, manufacturing efforts, and more money to be spent. New stock offering with 50% discount and dilution are for sure on the way. The SP will be under $1 for sure in a couple of weeks. This company was trading at $0.3 sometime ago. Back to basis. Same of what has happened to $AKBA, $ITRM, $ARDX, $ADVM."
It is labelling issue not the efficacy of the drugs. This is clear manipulation.. soon to be the FDA will approve it as soon as new label is printed.
This is very confusing...the FDA has identified deficiencies that preclude discussion of labeling and post-marketing requirements/commitments at this time. The letter stated that the notification does not reflect a final decision on the information under review. The company immediately requested a meeting to discuss the deficiencies and was notified by the FDA today that the request for a meeting was denied.So NOT a total rejection....but some problems...yet not willing to schedule a meeting ? How are they then going to address the deficiencies...Very weird...There is still some hope...But I still expect a large sell-off...hopefully no more than 30%....but could be a lot worse...
24M shares traded so far.... Wow...
I am loading.This is my entry point.
I told y before tenabour it will be accepted

I saw first hand the tribulations of CVM postponing (yes it is legal) the date to nearly months later.CVM is just beginning to recover from $27 down to $7 up to $9. I can see the same drawn out 1 year process with ARDX... that is why I bought the stock. This one will take all the patience of my CVM and CERS bio stocks. Years. But they are all great long term investments, if you got the stomach.Very long"
Definitely M&A target with this market cap!

If these two 'hopes' doesnt become truth, I am f...d :-)"
"After data had previously been released in phase three trials, there wasn’t much doubt that drug was successful in controlling phophorus. But FDA suddenly, after the fact, said, so what? So this doesn’t change anything in that regard. Rather, FDA has to be re-convinced that goal of phase three, which it had previously approved and agreed was medically worthy, is indeed what all scientists and doctors with expertise agree upon!."
"Holding 35,000 shares, prepared to add 40,000 on any serious dip. Shorts are in trouble if there is even a hint of good news. In my opinion, Good luck to all."
So far all DRLs resulted in CRLs. DRLs have purpose only if issued early when the company can reply/rectify within that cycle. Otherwise what is the use of DRL.
"Look at the 3 minute chart - it's in the same corridor all the time. You can see how high-frequency trading works. Let's break this trend. If each of us buys even a little stock, we can break this big guy manipulation."

"People don't panic! You should know that this company is much more expensive than $ 2 and here's why:1. Commercialization of the approved IBSRELA (tenapanor) product in the USA and Canada,2. Agreements on the commercialization of tenapanor were concluded with three countries Japan, Canada, China3. Japan has entered into an agreement on its own development of tenapanora, where there is a 3 phase of testing, etc."
The law firms must also be shorting this stock?
In layman's terms the FDA says that an increased in serum phosphate and then lowering it by drugs has no clinical significance and to heck with all the research and publications. That means they do not accept the rationale for Tenapanor discovery and development. This is a tough one folks!
Earning are premarket on Thursday!!!!!!! Back towards the $7!!!!!
"when a scientific and/or medical dispute arises, the sponsor should initially seek reconsideration of the matter with the original deciding official before making an appeal to the next higher management level."
what is the good news here ?
It took them a week to announce the FDA response last time. What makes you think they will do anything today...unless it is good news?
What is implied by the size of treatment effect? The data readout from the P3 stated met primary end point and significant p value. So what are we missing?
Guys if somebody know any newsTell us
Apparently they wont release the PHASE 4 findings or ER during market hours. So it is afterhours when news coming out. That's why its going up! People getting ready!
"Let us delve into the critical parts of the statement by F$%.Clinically relevant: this drug reduces the phosphate levels. If that is not relevant to the patients why are phosphate binders being prescribed/used and paid by the Insurance today. Clearly they would not be relevant as well.Size of the effect: The drug reduced the levels to a degree greater than the existing SoC. There were multiple trials sufficiently powered to give a solid p-value. The trial design was approved. The data readout gives a clear indication of the size of effect. So what else would determine the size of effect?Am I missing out on something or absolutely wrong. Would appreciate hearing from any of the doctors, medical professionals or other stalwarts on this board. TIAThe rest of the statement is plain cut and paste and forms part of all CRLs. To me it appears this is, effectively, the CRL letter. What say you?"
"Raab need to buy 100k shares at today's price. If he does that, the price will move to 2 atleast."

"Sent to my Senators:Senator,Today the FDA issued a CRL postponing indefinitely the approval of a drug they admit is “highly effective at reducing phosphates in the blood”. The drug , tenapanor is already approved for another indication so safety is not an issue. After 11 years of successful trials and a label modification to include adolescents, which the FDA requested, the FDA touted weather phosphate reduction improves clinical outcomes. Endocrinologist have worked to reduce phosphates for decades. It is well documented that excessive phosphates cause cardiovascular hardening and death. There are 50,000 deaths annually in the US due to excessive phosphates and the FDA denies approval of a drug they admit in their CRL is effective. Doctors involved were “stunned”. Endocrinologist are desperate for an alternative to blockers which lack efficacy and have compliance issues/Again pleas take a few minutes to listen to Ardiilex’s CEO’s response to this and you will conclude something went terribly wrong. A half million Americans on dialysis lives depend on your ability to correct this miscarriage. Sincerely Mark Allen"
"Because I believe that tens of thousands of patients have the right to use the drug ARDX, that truth and justice will still win, I buy a few shares of ARDX every day, now I already have 77k. I will continue to buy them. When I sell them, I would like not to lose money, but profit is not really important to me. I buy ARDX because my best friend died and he was on dialysis, I know how he suffered. I know if we all buy a few shares of ARDX we will help this company get a certificate from the FDA faster. ARDX has already invested in the entire commercialization system and is just missing another OK from the FDA to change the lives of tens of thousands of suffering patients and get their chance."
"The 80million share-swapping of today, the 140m on the day of initial FDA letter, the 25-40M daily shares in between are all aspect of today’s unregulated market, where such “ trading” has no relation to any fundamentals ( ARDX SHOULD be at this or that price because….), but rather is machine, algorhythmic, high-frequency carpet bombing and swapping of shares , preventing a logical price ted to the potential of the company. This phenomenon is destroying the little guy, the smaller companies, the basis f capitalist stock markets, and must be stopped by new, strict regulation. Finally, as I’ve posted for a week, you can’t meaningfully take a position and feel it will relate to the company’s prospects until volume returns to less than a million a day. When it does, comparable CRL situations would find $2.50-3.50 reasonable price for Ardx given both pipeline and some degree of prospect for the FDA-rejected drug."
Actually it is a good thing that the volume has dried up. Nothing left to sell and the stock is now in the hands of buyers who want to ride it up.
"After listening to Raab, I have the impression he is very much driven to have this succeed. BTW, he did the best job I’ve ever heard of being so totally pist-off, and getting that point across, while maintaining composure. KUDOS as that in itself, is not an easy thing to do. IMO, after the Class A meet, FDA will maneuver to save face while providing a faster pathway rather than a new trial."

"FDA will insist on another trial at Type A meeting.. Company will have no choice but to accept this after their debate leads to no change in views. Rather than antagonize the bureaucrats who are in charge of approving the drug, they will acquiesce. Then they will cut the sales force. Then they will burn the $100mm; and they will raise more cash and dilute current shareholders. I can see the stock at $1 in coming months as it becomes clear that there is no shortcut approval."
Patience and trust

FDA people have to be extremely incompetent to be able to detect such deficiencies only at the very end of the process. FDA is subsidized by tax money to screw tax payers, is that it? The people must stand up for their rights."""
"OK so I’m in at $1.65 you all can sell now, because I ONLY buy at the top price of the day, lately"
ByuHoldIt will recover
"It would be great if we could raise the price today like yesterday. So $ 1.55 today. Together, we can do it."
I had placed a sell order early this morning for a portion of my position @ $2.15 and I saw it hitting 2.17 and didn't go through because TD Ameritrade doesn't execute orders before 7:00am EST. Looks like it's going to be a wild roller coaster ride today.

"Suppose next week the FDA says a final YES, given all the facts so far, scientific analysis and conclusions, the ranking of Ardelyx, Inc. in 21st place among the Top 100 Healthcare Technology Companies of 2021, already organized the entire system of commercialization and investment and of course much more which all points to Ardelyx, Inc. as a company of success, perspective and future.THE QUESTION IS:AM I RIGHT IF I THINK ARDX WILL COST OVER 10 DOLLARS BY NEXT FRIDAY AT THE LATEST?I wish you all a pleasant weekend."
I am actually going to hold. Citigroup is maintaining its buy rating and has a price target of $7. Definitely a risky investment but this should not be at $2/share. I was thinking about selling at market open today but that just makes no sense. Good luck longs
How many law firms file suits against this organization?
"If there is no hope for FDA approval anymore, why no Insider sold their shares?"
The company need to have a CC to define this news. The FDA stated this deficiency does not preclude approval. Denying a meeting seems harsh given the history and number of trials.

Just threw some play money in here. Huge reward and small risk play IMO.
"From FDA.gov. Phase 4 study - see last line. Completion date August 2021. Potentially , just in time to save ARDX at the Type A meeting (post CRL).Study DescriptionBrief Summary:The study is designed to evaluate the ability of tenapanor alone or in combination with sevelamer to achieve serum phosphorus concentration (sP) within the population reference range (sP >2.5 and ≤4.5 mg/dL) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis with hyperphosphatemia (>4.5 mg/dL).Condition or disease Intervention/treatment Phase HyperphosphatemiaEnd Stage Renal DiseaseDrug: TenapanorDrug: Sevelamer CarbonatePhase 4Detailed Description:Patients who complete the TEN-02-301 study (PHREEDOM) may be eligible to enroll into TEN-02-401 (NORMALIZE).Patients from the TEN-02-301 tenapanor arm will either receive only tenapanor or be given sevelamer in addition to tenapanor based on their sP. Patients from the TEN-02-301 sevelamer arm will be given tenapanor in addition to their sevelamer dose and the sevelamer dose will then be adjusted based on their sP following a protocol-specified dose titration schedule. Patients will be monitored for safety and efficacy with in-office and telephone visits for up to an additional 18 months.Laboratory assessments will be measured at every visit (Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18) using a central laboratory.Safety assessments will be performed during the study and will include physical examinations, vital signs (blood pressure and pulse), body weights, clinical laboratory evaluations, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and adverse event (AE) monitoring.Study DesignGo to sectionsStudy Type : Interventional (Clinical Trial)Estimated Enrollment : 150 participantsAllocation: Non-RandomizedIntervention Model: Parallel AssignmentMasking: None (Open Label)Primary Purpose: TreatmentOfficial Title: A Long-Term, Open Label Study to Evaluate the Ability of Tenapanor Alone or in Combination With Sevelamer to Treat to Goal Serum Phosphorus in Patients With End-Stage Kidney Disease on Dialysis (NORMALIZE)Actual Study Start Date : June 15, 2019Estimated Primary Completion Date : June 2021Estimated Study Completion Date : August 2021"
"The only way out for this is mess - after 11 years of trials agreed by the FDA- that met primary and secondary endpoints - as a FDA Advisory Committe with Renal/Dialysis Specialists and Patients making the call : and not a FDA reviewer who doesn't look after this patient group.An Outcomes Trial ....is unrealistic and probably unethical. And that would be the end of any BIOs researching for new therapies in this field.Expect the Renal Community and Patients to make their feelings heard just like in the PR.I am holding on until I hear the FDA's logic for shifting ""goal posts"""

My guess is Type A meeting was held. Data from Phreesdom study was presented. KOLs have put pressure on FDA. FDA has likely recommended ARDX to resubmit new NDA with additional data from Phreedom trial under “Accelerated Approval “ pathway”. Otherwise why would Raab put this press release out now with the words “clinically meaningful reduction” in the title. That would be suicidal - so the meeting with FDA has gone well. The FDA will send official notes from the meeting to the company at which point we will get a press release - likely in a week or so. Stay tuned !!!
"Projected earnings looks good ,company still profitable ,Tenapanor eventually will be approved..Seams like panic selling"
"FORM 10-Q 2021-05-06, padge 26-We are substantially dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, tenapanor, which may not receive regulatory approval for the control of serum phosphorus in adult patients with CKD on dialysis or for any other related indication, and if approved, may not be successfully commercialized for such indication. On April 29, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (?FDA?) determined that a submission we made in response to an information request from the FDA constituted a major amendment to our New Drug Application (?NDA?) for tenapanor for the control of serum phosphorus, resulting in a three-month extension of the PDUFA date to July 29, 2021. The FDA?s information request included a request for additional analyses of our clinical data. The FDA may act on our application by issuing either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (?CRL.?). Should we wish to pursue our application after receiving a CRL, we may, if possible, resubmit the application with information that addresses the questions or issues identified by the FDA in order to support approval. Resubmissions are subject to review period targets, which vary depending on the underlying submission type and the content of the resubmission."
"ardx should sue the fda for the costs of the trials. met all endpoints discussed and agreed upon with fda, but then fda says ""neener neener"", thanks for wasting your time and money, we lied to you and mislead you."

"FDA’s decision to extend the review clock should, except in rare circumstances, be limited to occasions where review of the new information could address outstanding deficiencies in the application and lead to approval in the current review cycle."
"Considering the circumstances, ER is not bad and as expected.....Guidance on what they do next should make it pop back to $2+ IMO."
"Once the day traders move on,this will work it’s way back to around 2.50 with out any news.Be patient!"
"Here is what I see happening...They will get a CRL on July 29th. They will then fire all the salespeople and downsize the company. They are burning at least 25M per quarter. 179M was as of March. They will be down to 125M in the 3rd quarter. They also have 50M in debt.. so net cash is more like 75M in Q3. They will request a formal meeting with FDA which has to be granted. However, it won't happen for about 3 months. Early Q4 at the best. They will resubmit in Q4 or Q1 with a PDUFA date of next summer. I don't see a rebound in stock price until after fda meeting and notes are published. I locked in the tax loss yesterday. Will consider buying back before fda meeting in Q4."
"It's notable that even after the disappointing news from the FDA and the subsequent PR, the company hasn't seen fit to hold a cc to enable analysts the opportunity to give Raab, the ceo, et al. the third degree. I'm certain they must have some probing questions for Raab et al., including what the company intends to do next."
"Maybe I just woke up on the right side of the bed. But I’m somewhat hopeful for Ardx. I’m not saying we will  back to $7 But I do think there are some good days ahead. We will find out what the FDA wants. Even if it’s some sort of outcomes study and takes two years, I feel like approval will happen. Catalysts in the short term (aside from type A meeting). Any news on royalties from other countries. And potentially any news on the company marketing Tenapanor for it’s approved indication. Come on Raab. Show us you believe and buy 10k or even better 100k of shares!"
FDA will end up accepting an Advisory CommitteeThey will not be able to withstand the Renal / Dialysis Specialists and Patients who are are clearly upset about their intepretation( PR wise - adds to the negative impression of FDA post Alzeihmers Drug Approval after Specialist who look after patients - as a Advisory committee told them not to approve)There will be a compromise - to the benefit of patients I am holding LONG
Looks like all the ambulance chasers are out in force. Sorry way to make a living. 
i think its fair to say anybody who was in it for short term would have sold by now. Its going to go up from this price
"Friends, read the PR clearly. Due to COVID and Delta variant strain, FDA is not accepting any more meetings so they have cancelled meeting request.The letter stated that the notification does not reflect a final decision on the information under review. The company immediately requested a meeting to discuss the deficiencies and was notified by the FDA today that the request for a meeting was denied.The drug is not yet dead, Wait for a bounce in a week or so."
"maybe good news tomorrow, don't give up, there is always hope"
"Ok. Here’s my long term prediction. This eventually gets approved, then some big pharma company comes and buys it out for not much more than we topped out at in April. Total guess but it happens all the time. I had one of these with an approved product. Was languishing and now Sanofi is buying at a level it had previously topped out at. Go figure."
How many ads do these short selling lawyers need to post? Their worse than the double ads that precede YouTube videos. Class action penny’s are not going to help you paper hands.
probable bottom with reversal today. Certainly this week
It's gonna be a rollercoaster ride today!
All seller will be very sorry soon
"Bk won’t happened , would be bought out way before that"
We love the rookie!!
"Never heard a call like this - summarizing history of discussions with FDA, certainly addressing my question about whether ARDX botched this or FDA pivoted. Is there any accountability for / comment by FDA?"
"Good Morning Guys Rookie here, Rookie never wrong. Rookie have never insult anyone in this board or in life . Rookie is a Religious man I believed in God and in Karma. Rookie have recibe insults and dont like the comment send to my person. Rookie only want to help people and make money. Last insult comment from JACK he say i am scam. Did i have ask something ?

"It has been a tough week for ARDX longs and this next week we get the final chapter of this part1 saga. Did ARDX screw up or FDA corrupt/incompetent?...you decide. ARDX did do a poor job on the PR and was too emotional and fatalistic. After reading many comments the mostly likely scenario1 is Raab went too aggressive on the label and FDA pushed back. Did they include the mono or not? If so Raab really f’ed up and cost shareholders millions…Scenario2 is that duel is not clinically relevant the benefit does not add any patient value. There is a 99.99% chance we get a CRL on Thursday. So now what…Sceanrio1: 74.99% chance – 6mo or 12mo CRL cycle depending on severity. PPS will probably bounce to $3-4 before next PUDFA. We have enough cash to cover this timeline. Exec mgmt/BOD salary need to be reduced 75%, no 2021 cash bonus or option grants until FDA approval.Sceanrio2: 25% chance – CRL new trial and 3+yrs until PDFUA. Larger pop mono trail or longer dual duration data needed. PPS will drop to $1.25 Friday. Need another $150 cash to survive until 2025 and PPS will hover $1.5-2 over that timeframe depending on funding. Raab, CMO, Reg etc should be fired immediately w/o severance. All commercial employees fired and use funds for trials. IBS–C approved product is licensed/royalty with another company that does sales/marketing. 50/50 revenue split. Maybe get $100M of royalties over 3 years to help reduce dilution.Scenario3: .01% chance – Approval for dual label with mono pending PH4 results. PPS $8 Friday.All this is IMHO...good luck…and pray ;)"
How do we know how many million of common stock offering is already out?
"Bought another1,000 at 1.31. My average now for break even 1.70."
Time for a short squeeze to $30 The lawyers and short interest hedge funds will pay for it.
This stock will be above $30 soon. Tenapanor saves lives.
"Rookie here , Rookie never wrong, I told everyone before open market today pre-market market and post market close GREEN , In a RED day . Tomorrow 50 million volumen Aproved with conditions . Sincerly i hope the shorter in the board covered today ."
It'll be interesting to hear what the exact issue is of 'size of the treatment effect and its clinical relevance'. That'll produce a big volume day.
"Arnold Silva, M.D., Ph.D., director of Clinical Research at Boise Kidney and Hypertension Institute, added, ""Lowering serum phosphorus is a priority for me in managing my patients on dialysis, and is an established standard of care driven by the peer-reviewed globally accepted KDIGO clinical practice guidelines. Years of research have demonstrated the negative consequences associated with even slight elevations in serum phosphorus. Despite our best efforts with currently available therapies, managing phosphorus remains a significant challenge. We need new tools. I've closely followed the extensive clinical development of tenapanor, not only as an interested nephrologist, but also as a clinical investigator. I've seen the clinical benefits of tenapanor first-hand in my patients and I'm stunned that the FDA is not granting approval of this novel mechanism drug, despite extensive clinical data demonstrating its safety and efficacy.""""Neither peritoneal nor hemodialysis provides adequate control of serum phosphorus, obligating the use of medications,"" said Glenn Chertow, M.D., M.P.H., division chief of nephrology and professor of medicine at Stanford University. ""Unfortunately, phosphate binders – individually or in combination – rarely yield consistent control of serum phosphorus concentrations, and persistent hyperphosphatemia leads to dystrophic calcification, accelerated arteriosclerotic vascular disease, fractures, and other complications that profoundly affect patients' lives. The effect of tenapanor on serum phosphorus observed in the Phase 3 trials is clinically meaningful. Tenapanor would enable a substantially larger fraction of patients to reach target serum phosphorus concentrations and would yield significant clinical benefit to this vulnerable population."""
It would be interesting to see who shorted us into the ground. I am sure there is no political affiliation.

This is going to be below $1. Earnings have announced they will be out of money within 12 months unless they find new funding. This is corroborated with last years earnings as accurate and the job cuts and loan deference will not be enough.the only way out of this is an FDA reversal which is highly unlikely (read: impossible) to happen. They don't have enough for the trial require WITHOUT new funding.
"900k shares at close at 1.52 is a point of concern to me. At some point this will be a tremendous buy, but is it right now?"
"I’m glad I averaged down. We are trading below book value and have more cash than the market cap. Tenapenor (Isbrella) is an approved and selling product for IBS which will bring in revenue with a very small sales force. With another chance to run at a phosphatemia indication, are we really in that bad of a position?Top that off with our large short%, and I think the market brings us back to $4-$5 pretty fast."
"Any constant or stable value is great ....it will take out many unexperienced shorters ,most of them short on borrowed money ,so if they won’t cover in couple of days like grace period will face substantial amount of losses .Own principal + borrowed amount .Hold or buy is the key"
Boom
"The FDA indicated it is willing to meet with Ardelyx to discuss options for obtaining approval. To that end, the company intends to request a Type A meeting as soon as possible to discuss the CRL and determine potential paths forward for the approval of tenapanor for the control of serum phosphorus in adult patients with CKD on dialysis."

"PATENT looks very good and a good reason to keep quiet and let the Pharma's study the patent for a while. This is just a hint of what ARDX has up its sleeve. Very long.......Patent Issued for Isoxazolyl-carbonyloxy azabicyclo[3.2.1]octanyl compounds as FXR activators (USPTO 11091482)9/7/2021 4:27:59 PM EDT2021 SEP 07 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Biotech Business Daily -- A patent by the inventors Baribault, Helene (Fremont, CA, US), Caldwell, Jeremy (Fremont, CA, US), Chao, Jianhua (Fremont, CA, US), Hu, Lily (Fremont, CA, US), Jain, Rakesh (Fremont, CA, US), Lewis, Jason Gustaf (Fremont, CA, US), filed on August 23, 2017, was published online on August 17, 2021, according to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx correspondents.Patent number 11091482 is assigned to Ardelyx Inc. (Fremont, California, United States).The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: “FXR is a ligand-activated transcription factor. Upon binding of a ligand, FXR either binds to DNA at the FXR response elements (FXREs) as a monomer, or forms a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and then binds to FXREs, regulating the transcription of a variety of target genes. To date, more than 40 FXR target genes have been identified that are involved in a wide range of physiological functions including bile acid homeostasis (e.g., BACS, BAAT, BSEP, FGF15/19, etc.), cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism (e.g., Apolipoprotein C-I, II, IV, Apolipoprotein E, MDR3, Human complement C3, ApoA-1, hepatic lipase, SREPB-1c), glucose metabolism (e.g., PEPCK, GSK3, AKR1B7, GLUT4, G6Pase), and xenobiotics metabolism (e.g., GSTa3, GSTa4, GSTm1, GSTm3, SULT1A1, SULT1A2). In addition to the regulation of metabolic related genes, recent results have identified FXR as a regulator of cellular inflammatory and immune responses. Activation of FXR can provide anti-inflammatory effects by negative regulation of nuclear factor kB (NFkB) pathway, reducing the expression of NFkB and the many pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with this pathway (Matsubara, T. et al., “FXR signaling in the enterohepatic system,” Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2013, 368, 17-29; Moschetta, A., “Deciphering the nuclear bile acid receptor FXR paradigm,” Nucl. Recept. Signal., 2010, 8, e005; Huang, W., et al., “FXR: a metabolic regulator and cell protector,” Cell Res., 2008, 1087-1095).“FXR plays a key role in the synthesis, transport and metabolism of bile acids (BAs) and the many physiological and pathophysiological conditions that involve BAs. In the liver, activation of FXR has been shown to lead to the increased expression of short heterodimer partner (SHP), which in turn inactivates liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) and inhibits the cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the first step of biosynthesis of primary bile acids from cholesterol, thereby reduces the production of bile acids. Activation of FXR in the liver has also been shown to downregulate transporters like Na-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) and organic anion-transporting peptides (OATPs) preventing the uptake of bile acids to liver. The accumulation of BAs in the liver plays a pivotal role in cholestasis-associated liver damage, pharmacological activation of FXR by synthetic ligands can provide therapeutic intervention.“FXR has also been shown to play an important role in the inflammation control of various liver and intestinal diseases (Shaik, F. B., et al., “Role of farnesoid X receptor in inflammation and resolution,” Inflamm. Res. 2015, 64, 9-20). Activation of FXR has been shown to repress the NFkB pathway, a prototypical proinflammatory signaling pathway, and inhibit the expression of key cytokines such as TNFa, IL-1b, and IL-6. In the colon of FXR knockout mice, increased expression of both proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFa, IL-1b, IFNg) and profibrotic genes (e.g., Collagen a1, TIMP-1, and aSMA) has been observed, indicative of dysregulation in intestinal immunity and tissue remodeling. Activation of FXR with FXR activators in the TNBS induced murine inflammatory bowel disease model has been shown to inhibit the above cytokines and provide protection against inflammation and fibrosis, subsequently against the development of colitis (Vavassori, P., “The bile acid receptor FXR is a modulator of intestinal innate immunity,” J. Immunol. 2009, 183, 6251-6261). Moreover, treatment with an FXR agonist in a rat model of cholestatic liver injury (bile-duct ligation) reduced NK cells and INFg expression, leading to reduction in intestinal inflammation, reduction in bacterial translocation, and overall improvement in gut barrier function (Verbeke, L., “The FXR agonist obeticholic acid prevents gut barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation in cholestatic rats,” Am. J. Pathol. 2015, 185, 409-419).“Activation of FXR with small molecule activators h"
and then the FDA goes ahead and approves the Biogen's Alzheimer's drug that 100% of its own advisory panel opposed its approval and said there is absolutely no evidence that it has any clinical effect....go figure!

All these law companies going after the company. There seem to be lot of angry shareholders. Thanks good the company has raised more money. They can use the proceeds for their defense and bonuses. For research there is no money.
