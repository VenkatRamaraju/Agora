Gild need to increase dividends and buyback shares with all these cash flows ..
Who knew making more money than expected would drive the price down?
"Cash is cash at the end of the day. GILD is certainly raking it in. And oh yes, earnings estimates will go up. Buy."
Finally we get to the results!! All these negative vibes have had their day! Investors look only for results and yes tomorrow will bring a beat and an upbeat conference call with all that is in the pipeline. GILD is past the half time moving out of the just HIV scenario that’s why they brought in the new CEO he’s on a long term plan that will bring this into the $100s easy and if a buy out $140 !!
"Not sure about others but I am very pleased about the direction Gilead is headed: Product Sales Performance:Total third quarter 2021 product sales increased 13% to $7.4 billion compared to the same period in 2020. Total product sales excluding Veklury decreased 3% to $5.4 billion for the third quarter 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily reflecting the expected loss of exclusivity of Truvada(emtricitabine (“FTC”) 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg (“TDF”)) and Atripla(efavirenz 600 mg/FTC 200 mg/TDF 300mg) in the United States, partially offset by continued increased demand for Biktarvy(bictegravir 50 mg/FTC 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg (“TAF”)) and Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy).HIV product sales decreased 8% to $4.2 billion for the third quarter 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, reflecting, as expected, the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States, as well as lower channel inventory as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily driven by pandemic-related stocking in the prior year, partially offset by higher Biktarvy demand and improved trends in the treatment market.Biktarvy sales increased 20% year-over-year in the third quarter 2021, reflecting higher treatment demand and net price.Descovy (FTC 200 mg/TAF 25 mg) sales decreased 15% year-over-year in the third quarter 2021, primarily driven by lower net price.Truvada and Atripla sales decreased 87% and 76% year-over-year, respectively, in the third quarter 2021, as expected, due to the loss of exclusivity in the United States in late 2020.Hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) product sales decreased 8% to $429 million for the third quarter 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily driven by a favorable settlement in the same period 2020 that did not repeat, fewer patient starts outside the United States, and timing of Department of Corrections purchases on a relative basis.Hepatitis B virus (“HBV”) and hepatitis delta virus (“HDV”) product sales increased 17% to $247 million for the third quarter 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Vemlidy (TAF 25 mg) sales increased 18% in the third quarter 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, driven primarily by uptake in geographies outside the United States. Hepcludex (bulevirtide) contributed $12 million in the third quarter 2021 as launch activities continued across Europe.Cell Therapy product sales increased 51% to $222 million for the third quarter 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.Yescarta(axicabtagene ciloleucel) sales increased to $175 million in the third quarter 2021, driven by continued demand in relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (“LBCL”) and strong uptake in relapsed or refractory indolent follicular lymphoma in the United States and Europe.Tecartus(brexucabtagene autoleucel) sales were $47 million for the third quarter 2021, driven by increased adoption in mantle cell lymphoma in the United States and Europe.Trodelvy sales for the third quarter 2021 were $101 million, reflecting increased use for the second-line treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (“TNBC”) and metastatic urothelial cancer in the United States.Veklury sales were $1.9 billionfor the third quarter 2021. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations."
Basher index extremely high.Usual overtime the day of and after the calls.
"My calculations are that O'day has made close to $100 million total since he arrived. (salary, free stock, bonus). Was he worth that $100 million? I vote NO!!!!!!! Not even close. Maybe worth $1 million, and I'm being generous."
What part of massive earnings beat & raising guidance didn't people like?
"Update: Earnings is now $8.73 a share so that's 1.25B x $8.73 = 10.9B10.9B x 30 multiple = 327B Fair value327B / Shares outstanding = $261 Fair share priceWe are trading at a quarter of our real value!Previously: So, looking at NON-GAAP, we have conservative earnings of $6.90 a share. With 1.25B shares outstanding, that would be earnings of 8.625B in earningsFor our industry, standard multiples would be 25-40 times their earnings, so let’s say 30.30 x 8.625B = 258.75B258.75B divided by the 1.25B shares outstanding = $207"
"Abbvie great numbers and dividend increase, Merck booming, I wish GILD would get taken out. Should be able to get at least 80 bucks a share"
"8.73 eps (ttm), about 7.5 p/e at this price, play your games, its coming"
Gilead needs a Media Manager. I think the company does great think mostly ! But with great results from earnings I don’t here them on CNBC or Bloomberg supporting the company and promoting shareholders interest . The share price reflects this and we suffer for shareholders and myself.
So lets bash O'Day for putting up stellar numbers. I know if hadn't given so many regimens of Remedesivir we would have made 2 cents more a share than we be rocking and rolling. Give it a rest. He did he's job. The company was stagnating under the old leadership. The old CEO would have bought Galapagos by now instead of partnering and cutting losses when things don't work out. By the way see who wants tp partner with Gilead cancer drug???
Gild welcomes AMAZON and Apple investors.
"I've been posting here for months that remdesivir revenue has been obscuring the sharp decline in GILD's core anti-viral business which accounts for 80% of its sales. Today's earnings confirms my previous comments. HIV sales down 8% which continues the pattern of the past several qtrs. If not for covid, GILD revenue would be in the toilet. Now that MRK has a pill, GILD is in big trouble."
I got out of GILD but still holding shares of other covid drug companies like PFE which has also been a big disappointment regardless of the sales. Point being it’s the pipeline outside of the covid reign that matters most. And when Merck announced they were launching an antiviral to target covid I saw a noticeable drop in the group of other companies engaged in vaccines and treatment drugs.
WHY the dip ?https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gilead-sciences-stock-dips-as-results-outlook-top-street-view-11635453542?siteid=nbsh
"Not the best way to rap up the week. However the last two weeks have been predictable and very profitable via the option chain. Thanks Gilead, better days ahead."
"From earnings transcript--Chief Commercial Officer: ""Third quarter revenue of $101 million grew 13% quarter over quarter, driven by increased share in metastatic TNBC in part due to the expansion to second line. Trodelvy was approved for second-line metastatic TNBC in the US in April, and we already estimate that approximately 15% of second-line patients are receiving Trodelvy. In the third line or later setting, we estimate that about a third of patients with metastatic TNBC are receiving Trodelvy. In urothelial cancer, at least one in four bladder cancer patients in the third line or later setting start treatment on Trodelvy.And with adoption in second line still early, there is continued opportunity for growth across both settings. We're pleased with the uptake so far and remain focused on broadening physician awareness in community settings. Following recent NCCN breast cancer and ESMO clinical guideline updates, Trodelvy is now included as a preferred regimen in second-line metastatic TNBC in both guidelines, and we expect this will drive further adoption. We are preparing the first commercial launches of Trodelvy for metastatic TNBC in Great Britain, Australia, Canada, and Switzerland.And later this year, we are expecting a decision from the European Commission following the recent positive opinion from the CHMP. Next, on slide 14 and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, our cell therapy products grew 51% year over year to $222 million. This was driven by LBCL demand and strong launches in both mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, more than offsetting the expected impact of new US entrants in LBCL. With the addition of our new MCL and FL indications, we are particularly proud that we have maintained our best-in-class manufacturing operations with a 97% reliability rate.To support our expected growth, we are working to bring our new Maryland facility online in mid-2022, which will automate many of our manual processes and reduce costs. We also wanted to highlight the recent FDA approval of Tecartus in adult ALL. This makes Tecartus the first and only CAR T therapy now available to these eligible patients in the US. The Kite team has also filed a supplemental BLA for Yescarta in second line LBCL which would bring us one step closer to potentially curing even more patients."""
