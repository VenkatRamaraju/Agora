Can anyone tell me which part of HALL's business is exposed to COVID-19? I added another 4K shares to my portfolio today and I will hold the total 20K shares for a few years. Just try to understand more about its business. Thanks in advance!
"With the price $4.15 today, the market cap for this stock is around $75m vs the peak $310-350m in 2019. The earning is down about 30% but the fundamental is improving. So the fair market cap should be around $200-220m. This will drive up the stock price to $10-12 in next 6 months."
are there any news? i can't find anything to know why is going up.... finally
"From this board, it seems that there are only 5-6 investors like myself bought this stock. The company has about 18m shares outstanding with 13m floating. The institution buyers own about ~55% which is about 7m. Where all other shares went to ?"
Hallmark Financial Services is up 9.56% to 4.70
Investment loss disclosed/cleared and should rebound within second quarter results. Two hurdles still remain - charge associated with the loss transfer (173 million) and any potential COVID impacts. Regarding COVID - I believe they have only addressed areas that could be impacted but not any losses or activity to date. Most carriers made prognosticating impact statements within 1st quarter results with additional discussions in second quarter releases. If they skate COVID - second quarter numbers could be favorable. 3rd quarter / year end results don't have a chance (IMO) based on the loss portfolio cost. I see a lot of folks touting the growth - they aren't selling widgets - if they don't correct the underwriting they will only exacerbate their problems. Management needs to take a call and address issues head on without pulling punches to repair the trust based on the severely lagged reporting and adverse results. All that being said – they are already trading at distressed pricing. Not a bad long bet.
Very disappointing. At this rate it’s increasingly difficult to conceive how trying to spin off specialty commercial as an IPO can realistically make sense for shareholders. Adding another $1-2 million/year in Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs (plus another slew of executive salaries and Board fees!) while splitting an already choppy earnings seems increasingly nonsensical from a shareholder’s viewpoint (maybe not from the viewpoint of salary and BoD fee recipients..?)
"HALL’s valuation can revert to the historical average, it will be an $8 stock (+88% upside)."
Very mixed results but they are on the right track of readjusting the book and moving to profit. Overall positive in comparison to last year and large investments and cash on hand
"Total investments, cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $645.3 million or $35.57 per share."
Yall with me!
"Hall enterprise value is listed as -17.25 million. That is just ridiculously strong ... and undervalued.(Definition from google)Simply put, a negative enterprise value means that a company has more cash than it would need to pay off any debt and buy back all its stocks in one go, if it really wanted to."
Waiting in a Dark….
spin off soon. investor value extricated
the accounting mishaps of 2019 back have been corrected with resurrected ceo and largest shareholder determined to realize his well deserved nest egg.the drama subsides and good ole conservative insurance company provides for a non volatile small cap valuesleep well and prosper
"A question: if HALL is being acquired by other insurance company, what value base we should reference? it goes by the book value or stock price? Thanks in advance."
the stars are aligned. feel good about this onesleep well. easy 9
low volume pre news jitters. I expect 6 plus this week
"Does anyone know why earnings is forecasted to be a loss next quarter? I know it is only based on one or two analyst estimates but still, they must have some reason for predicting a negative quarter right?"
the valuation discount for HALL becomes even more gargantuan versus the public peer set.
any idea when the details of the ipo will be announced?
"Still feeling good about this one. Did anyone notice the price movement correlation between HALL and AIG? They peaked there on the 8th June interestingly enough too. I think, as soon as the larger insurers start moving up due to increased positive sentiment so will HALL."
just 6 trading days until next earnings call. not a good time to be short on this one.
Even if they have turned things around and pegged the adverse development at proper levels I would guess that first quarter numbers will be challenging. I believe they will need to account for the investment losses within their portfolio and the market was in free fall at the end of March. The market has rebounded some so if that is the only concern it will work to buoy second quarter results. That being said - adverse reserve adjustments are rarely pegged correctly at the outset. If they can get their house in order - current pricing is a steal as they are trading WELL below book value.
"Over-sold. Was hopeful for a beat. News was not terrible other then still on the mend. Cash and book value positive. Be nice to see a presentation on next steps. Will eventually get back to book,"
Earnings tomorrow at close. buckle in for the moon!!
any short covers buying will precede positive news that management has all but insured. gap up will happen anticipating positive news like dividend reinstated . I suggest holding to 8 
"Nothing overly shocking in 1Q report, just more progress getting on solid financial footing again. No indications of distress. 2Q likely the turn to positive eps and continued steady progress thereafter. This company has had good success in past and will continue into the future."
B/V up 4% to 9.84$Loss 0.5M
With a PPS of 3.35 HALL has a market value of $61 million. There is a huge disconnect between the value of the company with nearly $600 million in corporate bond investments as of 6/30/2020 plus their underwriting operations. https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/819913/000155837020010204/hall-20200630x10q.htm
I know how this all works. where large stakehders are presenting to suiters. they'll get it done
I believe the recent gain is mainly driven by the positive vaccine data reported from two different companies thus the recovery of economy in 2021 is foreseeable. HALL has been beaten down badly during the pandemic and not up much proportionally to the broad market. Today's action is just doing the catching-up thing. Any thoughts?
"for a acquisition spinning off, ipo, outright sell. the books have to be pristine, no fudging,...bidders will want veracity in books. and that confidence ultimately will reign Supreme when hallmark sold off"
Their Book Value increased.
P/S at .10 and P/B at .23. This would Be a Buffet stock back in the day. Tremendous value at this price. You can check the numbers yourself by clicking “statistics” at the top. Only a matter of time before this one has to pop. The real back end numbers are just too good.
Any profit will do for the upcoming earnings as long as they show they are back on track again. Only a matter of time before investors stop disregarding book value
"Happy with results. Lots of cash and investments. Net premium earned is up for the quarter and the year. They also seem to have beat analyst predictions again on Nasdaq and Marketbeat where they were expecting an EPS for the quarter of -0.95 / -0.80 and there was a surprise of -0.57. Annually EPS is -0.04 which is fantastic considering all the changes they have faced.They have to continue to do what they are doing (de risking, rate increases and focusing on profitable lines).Excited to see what happens!"
"DARAG in loss portfolio transfer deal with Hallmark July 20, 2020Legacy acquirer DARAG has entered into a loss portfolio transfer reinsurance deal with certain property and casualty (P&C) insurance subsidiaries of Hallmark Financial Services.￼DARAG Bermuda Ltd. and DARAG Insurance (Guernsey) Limited entered into the deal with American Hallmark Insurance Company of Texas, Hallmark Specialty Insurance Company, Hallmark Insurance Company, Hallmark County Mutual Insurance Company and Hallmark National Insurance Company.Under the terms of the deal, the Hallmark insurers will cede all existing and future claims on the binding primary commercial automobile liability insurance policies and the brokerage primary commercial automobile liability insurance policies up to an aggregate limit of $240.0 million.The first layer of $151.2 million in reinsurance will be provided by DARAG Bermuda, with the Hallmark insurers retaining a loss corridor of the next $24.9 million in losses.DARAG Bermuda will then reinsure a second layer of $27.8 million above the first layer and the Hallmark insurers’ loss corridor, and DARAG Guernsey will reinsure the top layer of $36.1 million.Hallmark will pay the Darag units a reinsurance premium calculated as $172.9 million less net claims paid prior to the closing date.Additionally, the reinsurers will deposit into a collateral trust account as security for their obligations $179.0 million less losses paid from January 1, 2020 through the closing date.The loss portfolio transfer contract is expected to close on or before August 31, 2020, and will come into effect from January 1, 2020.https://www.reinsurancene.ws/darag-in-loss-portfolio-transfer-deal-with-hallmark-financial/"
after hours is thinner then an already thin value trade. majority is longterm value and they are profitable year to date. I've been sleeping well buying dips. this is value not growth..I believe the existing longterm shareholders will find a suuter for book value
"Hard to determine what will be the impact of this IPO. What I am hoping is that the IPO will result in the ""Specialty"" business being sold at a price closer to its book value. The result would be that the two businesses combined would be worth more than they are now as a single business."
being north of 5 will enable mutual funds to buy as a lot of funds prohibit under 5
This stock has a book view of almost 15. Its Financials are strong and they're recovering from lagging in reporting. Slow and steady up to 14 over the next 6 months.
Hallmark Financial Services is up 8.60% to 5.18
"34% of volume Friday was short statistically way higher than usual. I know I am cheerleading a lot, but I like low risk stocks that have a sad tale. speed bump in stock price.the squeeze on aurora cannabis got me thinking."
"Ironically enough, I agree with all of the postings since the results were out several hours ago.The results were a disappointment and the loss, albeit a modest one, was not what I was expecting. We were all looking for a repeat of Q1 and that did not happen. Moreover the return to prior year adverse development shows the book clean up continues, something we all hoped would be done by June 30.However, the stock at anything less than $4.50 sells for meaningfully less than half of tangible book and I think that more than discounts the company's results. The sell off in the morning could be sharp but quick.I just read the 10-Q in its entirety and I continue to believe that a spin off of specialty is feasible with a combined ratio solidly below 100 again.I also think that the passage of time will cleanse the old underwriting and rates while new business is much more profitable, given underwriting standards and increasing rates.Given the low risk and high potential reward, I will wait and might nibble as well."
Let us hope they will be able to produce another good quarter. Price may very well approach 9 or 10 this year
"The CEO just resigned this week. The positive stock activity has probably been linked to this. It’s been released officially today. And the market seems to have liked this news. The companies revenue grew a lot under Mr Naveen Anand, and he successfully managed to turn the business mix away from auto. However he also probably was very aggressive and was likely aware of the poor prior year results in 2019 that were sort of kept secret from the market. He would have lost credibility, as he often used to say (in 2016/17) that things will get better, and they never did. And prior year claims always emerged. The chairman is now taking the CEO position. The good news is that the chairman, being a majority stakeholder himself will be looking at maximising shareholder value. He’s clearly experienced at this as he did it before too. He’s 60now, so probably looking at this as one of his last gigs. But let’s see. Any thoughts ?"
overdue on ipo update
This CEO is single-handedly reviving Hallmark. Great work!
"What surprises me is that there is no insider activity. Also, the CFO has not yet been hired, it’s been more than 45 days since the previous one left. All this could perhaps point to a looming acquisition. Mark Shwartz, the chairman who owns nearly 30% of the company may well be looking for a way to get the value of his holding back to the 2019 levels. ( the value of his holding has dropped by c. 75m since 2019 q4). And this seems to make up most of his publicly known net worth. If he were to wait for the market to correct, it may take very long. This further supports the acquisition argument. The big question then is, are other insurers interested. And if so, at what price? In my opinion, it’s a good company that can underwrite multiple classes well (except for auto). With the auto exit and LPT, the company has a good outlook. The price will be close to book value ( a bit more IMO) . So the share price is gonna triple when this happens.(Disclaimer: I am long this stock)"
Any comments on the 3rd quarter report? I think the net earned premium is increased proportionally which is a good sign after the company exits BPA business. It may also indicate the net income will be on the positive side for future ER.
Only a matter of time till we reach book value.
Hallmark Financial Services is up 9.02% to 5.56
"So, just reading this new release from AM Best... this is positive news, right?"
Price to book ratio at .2647 ? This share price should be around 11 just to represent its basic book value. Seems to be quite discount at this price. Am I missing something?
the fundamentals are synchronizing with with trend towards book value bolstered by spin offthe stars are aligned for longterm investors.on another note let's do all we can to beat the covid and invest in our infrastructure exercising unity as Americans fascism will not replace us!
Hallmark Financial Announces Second Quarter 2020 Results EPS 37c
"The Q2E clears at least two doubts: the pandemic is not much affecting the business and in contrast the earning is increasing; the new normal after exits the BPA is quite working. With the DRAG contracts, the past BPA lossless are reinsured and minimized. Now the only thing hinges out there is the lawsuit but I think it's manageable. The company is now on its way to build up the value. Feels good!"
"Still one of the more undervalued stocks with a book value just under $10, while so many other stocks reside in a much inflated bubble valuation and share price. This one should easily be sitting around $8 right now. $12-$15 by years end."

"I Just read about the amended lawsuit and ran some numbers:Overall 1.02 m shares were traded in this period (5th March to 17th March ) at an average price of about 7 $ and the stock finally settled at the 3$ range. So the maximum amount they can settle for is if they return to those shareholders their purchase price less the price on 17th March ie. return an average 4 per share for 1m shares or a total of 4mAdd legal fees of 30% to that and we get about $5.2m as the max settlement. This assumes they’re able to contact all the owners of the 1m shares and get them in board the suit.I will not comment on the merit of the lawsuit, but I feel the impact to book value / earnings in the worst case is also tiny.So I’m Not sure why people would worry about the lawsuit."
" This is a very Bullish Chart, traders! https://stockreport.tips/Bullish-Charts"
"hope you agree that this is an eye-opener. HALL is a massive outlier on the RHS, with a P/B of 0.44x (or BVPS of $9.91), a valuation that is at a whopping 50% discount to the next cheapest comp, Axis Capital. But that’s not the end of it – HALL has basically no intangible assets or goodwill accounted for on the B/S (only $1.2mm of intangibles and a Book Equity value of $180mm)"

"What does this mean for us? Press Release: Hallmark Financial Exploring the Separation of its Specialty Commercial BusinessMentioned:HALLHallmark Financial Exploring the Separation of its Specialty Commercial Business DALLAS, Jan. 21, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hallmark Financial Services, Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Hallmark Financial""), a property and casualty insurance company comprised of three business segments (Specialty Commercial, Standard Commercial, and Personal), announced that it is exploring the separation of its Specialty Commercial business. Initial evaluations by Hallmark Financial's Board of Directors indicate that separating the Specialty Commercial business may unlock significant value by segregating the operational structures of its segments. Each segment currently operates under a unique business model, utilizes its own distribution channels and has a different return profile. The Board believes that establishing two separate companies may achieve a more appropriate aggregate valuation and improve access to capital. Hallmark Financial's Specialty Commercial segment represented 75% of the Company's gross premium written, and 68% of its net premium written, through the first three quarters of 2020. This business has experienced substantial rate increases over the past 12 quarters, rising from approximately 7% to over 20% in Q3 2020. The Specialty Commercial business is a diversified portfolio of products placed almost exclusively through wholesale brokers, with the vast majority written on an Excess & Surplus lines basis. Hallmark Financial's Board of Directors and executive management team are working with assistance from its financial, business and legal advisors Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Willis Re Inc., Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP and McGuire, Craddock & Strother, P.C. to evaluate the Company's current structure and the strategic, operational, capital and tax implications of the potential separation. Additionally, the Board of Directors has engaged the executive search firm Reilly Partners, Inc. of Chicago to identify qualified candidates to serve as the chief executive officer of a stand-alone Specialty Commercial company. No final decision has yet been made with respect to the structure of the proposed establishment of a stand-alone Specialty Commercial company. No assurance can be given whether a separation transaction will take place, the form of any such transaction or the timing of any transaction. Any separation of the Specialty Commercial business remains subject to numerous conditions and approvals including, but not limited to, the approval of the Board of Directors and required regulatory approvals.

Hallmark Q2 Report probably leaked between Accounted Firm.. I be glad if IPO will be after healthy All business Segments
thanks for the deep dive DD. Hall is a actuarial risk averse business model with management ready to cash out with sale of company. I have been dollar cost averaging for a year anticipating this scenario buy the dips. sleep at night. easy double to quadruple next six months
"Take a good look at the 9/30/2020 financials. The earnings release only tells part of the story. Total assets of $1.497 billion and total investments of $444 million. Most of their investments are liquid, which means they could be turned quickly, if needed. There is a big disconnect between the market value of $53,699,000 and the value of the company. There is no chance of failure, and the company should have the worst of the auto underwriting behind them. Premiums are increasing, too. Next quarter financial report will be very interesting to read. The current book value per share is $9.71, and stock traded up to 19.70 over the past year. At the current price of $2.96, here is a lot of upside here. Outstanding shares are only 18,142,158.https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/819913/000155837020012916/hall-20200930x10q.htm"
"The presentation ( for the annual shareholders meeting ) is now available on their website. The location is in investors / presentations. Very clear explanation of the LPT, and the profitability of the business going forward. The rate increases are in the 20s , the specialty commercial business excluding binding primary auto has consistent and good combined ratios of about 90%. The expense ratio is Low giving a competitive advantage. The investment approach is conservative. They have done everything possible to clean the book. Now it’s just a matter of time to wait and see all this translate into earnings and ROE. the stock will be at 12-14$ by Christmas next year. If not more."
"Seems 4Q 2020 was revised lower and Q1 was also reduced. Company still planned to recover - however may take a little longer. same firm that lowered, also has an outperform rating on HALL. Be nice if Hall actually get some guidance instead of guesswork from analysts. Best hope is their Dec 22nd meeting they provide some of guidance. Be nice to see one of the investor presentation that they stopped going in 2019, they need to communicate."
"If you look at the one year chart, this stock lived around $18 before Covid. Glancing at the 5 yr chart, the S/P was consistently $11 until 2019. Even short term players are missing the money if they can’t wait a bit for $7. Very undervalued right now."
"According to their 8k form:""The Company presently expects to file its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 in June 2020, and to file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 within several weeks thereafter. However, unforeseen issues could arise that would delay these projected filing dates. Further, the current COVID-19 pandemic creates additional uncertainties regarding the availability of personnel and physical access to materials that could also delay these projected filing dates.""https://www.hallmarkgrp.com/investors/sec-filings/Not sure what the results will be like for 2019 due to the reserving dispute etc. However it seems they are moving away from unprofitable business which is a good sign. Their 2020 Q1 and year could be really profitable for their commercial auto lines due to the fact that less people are on the road due to COVID. I also note on their Twitter that their E&S property team reached a $100m milestone?Only time will tell with this one but it seems like its very cheap for their size at 4 dollars and whilst their unrealeased earnings are a concern there seems to be positive signs here.Any thoughts?"
"With 82% held by institutions at least a portion of today’s movement had to be attributed institutional buying. I Am not aware of recent news or any other catalyst. Maybe the smart money smells a good ER coming, or positive news?"
Going to be all up from here. There is still time to get in before they report earnings. After that will be north of 8. Good luck all.
"Q4 and final year results were great. Even though there was that expected loss, gross and net written premium were up (27% and 36%) and book value was up 2% to 14.53. Strong growth and they are moving away from their unprofitable line of business.I think Q1 2020 results in the next few weeks will be favourable due the growth here and COVID which has reduced claims experience in the market for certain lines.Very excited here!!https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/29/2055069/0/en/Hallmark-Financial-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2019-Results.html"
"“A quick rule of thumb for insurance firms (and again, for financial stocks in general) is that they are worth buying at a P/B level of 1 and are on the pricey side at a P/B level of 2 or higher. For an insurance firm, book value is a solid measure of most of its balance sheet, which consists of bonds, stocks and other securities that can be relied on for their value given an active market for them.”This is copied and pasted from an article on P/S valuations by Warren Buffett.The massive write down from the auto exit is done. Book value per share announced at just under $10. This stock is way undervalued right now.The stock was in the $18-$19 P/S range this time last year with a Book value per share at $14-$16. Buy all you can at these prices. This is one of the best deals out there. At the very least it looks like a 200% plus return in 6-12 months. Long."
