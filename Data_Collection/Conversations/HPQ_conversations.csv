"Beat, by a solid percentage!"
"michaelRnutz, you seem to think you know better than 18 professional analysts on HPQ. Their average price target is $33.04, and that's without the coming earnings which should be strong. They have 12 buy/strong buy and 6 hold ratings. Not one has a sell. I expect we'll get some upgrades and PT increases next week and estimates have already been revised upward. As for EPS the past 4 quarters they beat estimates 4 times, with EPS of $.49, $.62, $.92, and $.93. They will probably beat again and EPS for the year is expected to be $3.49. Even at a low PE of 10 this is a $35 stock....it's already hit $36 this year and can easily go to $40 or more. Printing is stabilizing, because not everything can or will be be electronic. And maybe you forgot that HPQ has 3D printing, an industry which is growing rapidly. You can throw all the useless numbers out that you want, and it won't affect HPQ because they're in great financial shape. They can easily service their debt with huge cash flow. Bottom line is I wouldn't want to be short like you are on HPQ."
That's exactly what I did. I am trading with an expert named Randy Griffin and with his experience and skills I can get maximum profits $150k from my trading after 14 days of intense trading. Contact Mr Randy Griffin’s signals via Telegrm@Griffinsignals
Good Luck y'all!
Ha! HP is doing a mini-breakout. It’s about time they got a bounce after the bad rap GS put on them at earnings. Go HP!

"New here, can someone explain why HPQ has a historic PE ratio of less than 5 for 2006-2017?"
Roller coasters are still very exciting $HPQ $VENA $QS
So since I couldn't get an answer from anyone I looked into the earnings call on 3D. It is completely in a nascent form and they aren't reporting any revenues at all from it. I'm not going to price in a section of their business that isn't even a business yet.
just placed an order for another 100 shares @ 27.55. The market is overreacting. The chip shortage will eventually go away.
HP is down 4.98% to 27.65
sorry to you guys who bought because of everything money channel on youtube.there old guys that only invest in dying company
"Dell vs HPQ, $95 vs $28, eps 20vs10, which is a better buy"
Ttm eps of $2.78. Why isn’t this $50?
"veryvery disaaapointing disaster printing business and personel system no growth herecome thescaryscary crashcrashbelow $23massiveselling dumpingbelow $23 beveryvery afraid to loss alotlot more money below $23.getoutoutnow get what you can now orget alotlotless then $23 soon ,run run to theexit exit door as fast as you can."
The drop is insane. They trounced earnings. The only reason they didn't beat on revenue is because of a chip shortage due to COVID. They guided up for the year. The thing I found interesting is that shipments weren't constrained by CPU availability. Printing is up. Everything is up. They're making a profit of nearly $1 per quarter or $4 EPS per year. Even at a PE of 10 this is a $40 stock.
"Clarification on prior post. It was HPE & HPQ vs. Oracle as it arose before they split into to companies. However they have agreed to split any proceeds received 50/50. While this lawsuit has gone on for a long time, the end is certainly much closer than the beginning. I am hopeful that the two sides will either settle very shortly or ( as I am a stockholder of HPE) the Calif Supreme Court declines to hear the case within the next 30 days which, based on my readings , is entirely possible. In my opinion the Calif Supreme Court even taking the case and Oracle winning is the least likely scenario - based on all my reading plus the SEC filings of both HPE and Oracle. My guess is that #1 they settle within the next 30 days and both HPE & HPQ get a lot of money. #2. The Supreme Court declines to hear the appeal from Oracle. Automatically HPE & HPQ get even more money. # 3 ( my least likely possibility) The Supreme Court agrees to take the appeal and it takes 1.5 years to reach a new decision. So an additional $500 million in accrued interest later, either HPE & HPQ split over $5 billion or Oracle wins and HPE & HPQ get nothing. So HPE & HPQ have a couple ways to win Big money and Oracle has one. So far HPE & HPQ have been winning."
Seems it will recover by EOD
It may suddenly be liberated in one day $HPQ $VENA
"The global 3D printing market size was valued at USD 13.78 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.0% from 2021 to 2028. Globally, 2.1 million units of 3D printers were shipped in 2020 and the shipments are expected to reach 15.3 million units by 2028. The aggressive R&D in three-dimensional printing (3DP) and the growing demand for prototyping applications from various industry verticals, particularly healthcare, automotive, and aerospace and defense, are expected to drive market growth."

Will enter @ $28
Company had a larger market cap in 2017 monkaHmm
"Reason prevails as HPQ is bouncing back quickly. The chip shortage will pass, and HPQ will be able to meet demand when it does. In the meantime, pricing power will keep profits up."
is this a buy?
"Pretty much one of the few undervalued companies in tech, it even pays a dividend… and people getting out because wait, it can’t meet demand? Lol"
"With staking becoming the new norm in cryptos, chip shortages will clear up faster than predicted. However, accounts payable is massive, so there is a big backorder of them that will take a while. It won't be until sometime mid 2022. This is one of the companies I feel at ease owning for a long time."
This should be a blue chip stock
HPQ stock is buy?
Buy the dip. Demand is bottled up. Chip shortage will be a thing of the past in time.
"Even though they beat by 10%, this stock could still trade down. Be careful, folks."
Strong company that may sell at a nice discount tomorrow based on supply issues. Nice time to pick up shares for a long hold.
HPQ is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A

"Folks, hopefully any day we are going to here that Oracle has settled their lawsuit with HPE&HPE to the toon of a couple Billion Each. A lawsuit against Oracle was filed around 10 years ago and Oracle lost the Jury trial, was denied their petition for a new trial and on June 14, 2021 lost their appeal to the Calif Court of Appeals in a unanimous decision. In July they appealed to the Calif Supreme Court. which chooses which cases they agree to review and usually only accept a small fraction of such requests. The tab now is about $4.6 Billion and interest is $1 million a day per SEC filings by HPE. So, Oracle has incentive to settle to stop the interest costs and before the Calif Supreme Court makes a decision to take the case or not. Even if they take the case it could be 1-2 years before they reach a verdict which could add another $500 million to the award if the lose. Of course, if the court says they will not take up the appeal, things are even worse for Oracle than they are today. The court may rule in the next 30 days. Or they may settle at any time depending on how much HPQ &HPE are willing to reduce the amount. Given their winning streak, they are in an excellent position."
$VENA $HPQ Must be getting expensive for them. Cost is nothing to hold.
"Report out that personal computer sales slid more than expected. HPQ's sales reportedly increased, but not as much as expected. But hey, if HPQ is buying back shares, the dip will help them buy more shares and boost profit per share."
What gives?Just a run of the mill 5% down day for good measure?
