"instant ink will be important moving forward. a subscription offering that not only brings in consistent revenue but also will help scale up and down production as needed. should help OP. also the HP Smart App is bar-none.. HP Printers are the way to go and now HPQ has found a way to continually monetize, add customer value even after initial purchase. great value proposition here in that business line alone."
"XRX deal provides about a 25% premium in just the cash portion. Since XRX has tanked along with the market, the actual buyout is much lower than the original $24 original offer. I really doubt XRX will be able to raise the funds now to purchase HPQ with the credit markets tightening so much. Ichan once said he might consider buying HPQ himself. It would seem to me that HPQ is on a fire sale right now."
HPQ ex dividend date at September 8th by 3.55%. Load up huge today.
Its trading 15% lower than the proposal. Whats the deal
"shares got to take off soon. tons of schools going online and having to buy 1,000's of computers per school system as many folks do not have adequate tech. computer sales to boom. I live is a small town and we are awaiting deliver of 1,000 pcs here and again we are just 1 of many thousand school systems."
Strong move up on some heavier than normal volume. Either buyers thought that Friday's selling was overdone or HPQ jumped in and bought back shares at a discount.
Moving up as expected - I hope this ends up between 25-30 - who knows any thoughts on this. Good luck to all. Do your own due diligence.
The swing traders sold off this morning b4 the good news on the 3D printing partnership. I held and I am glad I did. HP should continue to move up from here.
"OK, undervalued company here, the positives outweigh the negatives. I'm buying to hold."

HP is the one in an early pioneer of developing calculator and cell phone. Anyone can tell why it abandoned smart phone business? HPQ can develop its own desktop and mobile OS versus Android and Microsoft?
Bought shares in the low $29s.Should do better than the VZ shares that I had for some period of time...
"I have seen various reports that HPQ's PE is in single digits. If accurate, it makes you wonder why HPQ got punished so badly today, when other so much more speculative stocks, some without profits at all, get valued so highly."

Just loaded up! Fire sale won't last long.
"Hey, nice move this A.M. Earnings could be a nice surprise. I read where many school districts are scrambling to buy laptops for their students. People may not be in the office, but their office and schools are now in their homes, and they need updated equipment. The nice thing about HPQ is that it has earnings, and it will eventually bounce back when the virus calms down."
"XRX is the other printer company and it did poorly. HPQ down as people expect similar of it. However HP is also a computer company and Covid-19 pushed sales up nicely for HP, DELL & others. Quarter should be OK. Buying opp in my opinion."
"CEO Enrique Lores and another director together purchased 30,500 HP Inc (NYSE: HPQ) shares last week. Share prices ranged from $15.03 to $15.85, and the total for these transactions came to around $464,300. Lores' stake was last seen at 397,150 shares."
"Buy before great earnings, and you will at least drive up the take over price Xerox wants. Win Win... Buy Buy Buy..."
"Don’t let the big boys steal your HPQ shares cheap, this baby will be back to $17.50 around the ex-dividend date on June 9th. The options activity are telling it will go up substantially !! Good luck to all the believers. This stock will be at $23 - $25 by December 31, 2020."
The share price should begin to move up the closer we get to the closing bell… JMHO
It may suddenly be liberated in one day $HPQ $VENA
is this a buy?
"“We believe it is critical to engage in a rigorous analysis of the achievable synergies from a potential combination… With substantive engagement from Xerox management and access to diligence information on Xerox, we believe that we can quickly evaluate the merits of a potential transaction...”And also,“We recognize the potential benefits of consolidation, and we are open to exploring whether there is value to be created for HP shareholders through a potential combination with Xerox.”"
Umm. wha? Why the post earnings selloff?
Stock was a screaming buy before earnings and now after earnings more of a screaming buy long long long! good luck longs!

"Apple's profits were reportedly boosted by laptop and tablet buying by students and work-at-home individuals. I believe HPQ will also benefit in the hardware segment. With many schools and colleges going back, ink, printers, and printing supplies should also increase. Many schools have virtual components and options, so students and families will need a laptop for just about every member of the family. Good luck!"
time to buy. wait for 40
"Looking good pre-market. I truly believe that the recent sell-off was a nice buying opportunity. Sales should be fine on all fronts, and share buybacks should ensure strong earnings for the foreseeable future. There is always the possibility that X could make another offer."
What do you think folks? Buy the dip? Or is HPQ going down as the market rotates away from work-from-home stocks?

Everything long term investors want to see. Not great for short term investors.
$HPQ Target Raised by Deutsche Bank Hold USD 30 » USD 32 Target Raised by Cowen Market Perform USD 27 » USD 30
Forecast 3.15 EPS to 3.25 which is 57- 62 percent increase in EPS. We should go higher once Markets settle back down.
"This stock is setting up for a major breakout to the upside. Both the technicals and fundamentals are compelling. Stock is trading at a ridiculously low multiple; more and more people need computers, printers because they are working at home; the company received and rejected a buyout offer at almost 50 percent higher than where it is trading at now; 3d printing is booming. What am I missing? One of the best investment opportunities in the very hot high tech space."
EASY MONEY! SEE YOU AT $36!

"So here we have a company with that continues to buy back it’s shares, makes a decent profit, has a dividend of 4.7%, very low P/E, great products and yet is trading below AMD and many other hyped stocks. What are investors thinking now days ?? Buy and hold HPQ... it’s one of the safes stocks in the market right now. $18 in 4 weeks !!"

"New here, can someone explain why HPQ has a historic PE ratio of less than 5 for 2006-2017?"
Hpq somehow has an inverse relationship with the it’s own sector (3d Printing). Very strange
HPQ is in the oversold zone ... time to load up the boat at this discount price.... Analysts have the price at $35 in average ... HPQ has better value than Dell which P/E at 19.5 while HPQ at 10.5
Strong company that may sell at a nice discount tomorrow based on supply issues. Nice time to pick up shares for a long hold.
$VENA $HPQ Must be getting expensive for them. Cost is nothing to hold.
Is it just me or do we live in some sort of backwards market world. Companies like HP consitently make solid profits in the billions and we are trading at $17. And then there is Zoom and Twillio and Uber 
Why do we never talk about 3d print manufacturing part ofnthe company? These guys know how to make money off of printing and they're applying the same principles to a new format of printer! Especially now that insulating supply chain and ability to pivot/agile will be paramount for any manufacturer. Bought this stock because they're one of the first and few to actively have an initiative to disrupt manufacturing in a meaningful way. PC and 2d oront revenue is/was there to carry the financial burden of setting up am entirely new region in manufacturing/industrial sector.
I do not have any interest in HP-but I was a sourcing professional at some major corporations. From my perspective Xerox proofed to be one of the most unethical companies to deal with when it came to print and copier services. I always saved a lot of money moving to other suppliers. If I were an employee or a stockholder in HP this is the last company I wouldn't want to take me over. HP has a better reputation and future building their business.
"This is still a bargain based on p/s and p/e. Clean balance sheet. Earnings estimates very strong. Would not be surprised to see this get upgraded to $30+ this month. It's a dog, but still a healthy dog. They should buy a 3D printing company."
"Apparently the tender offer is still ongoing. I just got the offer in my accounts at Etrade and TD Ameritrade. Why would they offer $18 plus .149 shares of XRX now when HPQ is only $14.65? If they'd give me my cash today, I'd do it and buy back my stock immediately."
Solid move up on good volume. Looks like HPQ is getting some decent support. I wouldn't be surprised if we ran back to $18 in a couple of weeks.
"This stock worth at least $25, considering covid-19 situation it can go even higher."
"Of the top 10 selling printers on Amazon, HP has 7. Number one is HP OfficeJet 3830 All-in-One Wireless Printer, HP Instant Ink (K7V40A)."
"I sold in after hours. HPQ had a good quarter, but in this kind of market, I decided to take my nice profit and go to cash. The after hours trading price is almost as much as the current XRX offer. With XRX probably unable to raise their bid much more than a buck in cash, I'd rather have some cash to sit on. Now that HPQ will trade on its merits and any c. virus issues, I don't know where its fair value will fall. It sounded like HPQ downplayed the c. virus implications, and that might prove to be a mistake. Hey, good luck. I hope all you longs make out well whether you sell or hold."
"Best priced laptops? HP, go do your own DD and see for yourself!"
"Those of you (like me) who didn't panic sell are in silent mode, or is it panic mode?HPQ is under priced but even a low Price to Earnings ratio doesn't help if mutual fund managers feel like pushing a stock down.The Dividend paid out $157 million, this also didn't help.HPQ has huge cash reserves, Under the ongoing share Buyback program, they bought just under a billion worth of shares back in the last quarter (i think the actual amount was $814 million).This is why every price downturn has been met with buying pressure.When the selling pressure eases off, shorts cover their positions,bargain hunters move in and shares being bought back by HPQ will help buoy share price back up.Questions? Comment? Threats? Promises? Donations? Incantations?Salutations? Evaluations?"
"Seems to me that $18 is in the next gap, it will be one of those quick blink u wish u jumped. I did just get a few dips in. Will be holding for awhile. Thanks for the shares."
Ttm eps of $2.78. Why isn’t this $50?
HP sales policy for there printers and supplies are costing it major market share? If you can even find one in store. Waiting for 2 months for restock and now told was discintued in April after talking to Customer service 6 + times to see when shippingA home laser jet is 400+ cartridges are $100 plus each and have special bar code for security?? You have to have a account with HP for up dates etc. After maney years it is no longer wort being a HP customerSeems they are driving folks away.
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Fairstox.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"michaelRnutz, you seem to think you know better than 18 professional analysts on HPQ. Their average price target is $33.04, and that's without the coming earnings which should be strong. They have 12 buy/strong buy and 6 hold ratings. Not one has a sell. I expect we'll get some upgrades and PT increases next week and estimates have already been revised upward. As for EPS the past 4 quarters they beat estimates 4 times, with EPS of $.49, $.62, $.92, and $.93. They will probably beat again and EPS for the year is expected to be $3.49. Even at a low PE of 10 this is a $35 stock....it's already hit $36 this year and can easily go to $40 or more. Printing is stabilizing, because not everything can or will be be electronic. And maybe you forgot that HPQ has 3D printing, an industry which is growing rapidly. You can throw all the useless numbers out that you want, and it won't affect HPQ because they're in great financial shape. They can easily service their debt with huge cash flow. Bottom line is I wouldn't want to be short like you are on HPQ."
Strong hold
What is pushing this stock down?
"IMO there's a good chance we'll see a merger between XRX and HPQ, not a buyout by either company. I'd like to see them create a totally new company and get away from the HP name because it's confused so much with HPE which was the other half of the company before it split in two. By losing both the XRX and HP names, it would be perceived as a new entity and stock market interest could increase. The $2B in savings would be a huge benefit. I outlined previously what I thought would be a fair stock allocation between the HPQ and XRX shareholders based on revenue. That would probably be the contentious point of any negotiated merger."
Funny comments seem to be missing another strong positive for hpq..the billions in stock buy backs over next few years
HPQ doesn’t need Xerox but Xerox needs HPQ. I find it funny that the one with a shrinking customer base is the one trying to buy one on the cheap that has a future product line. Let Xerox try a hostel takeover. It will be a colossal failure. A partial cash and stock deal never seems to be a model that benefits the average investor.
"Over 2500 October 16 call option, strike 19 was traded today."
"The merger is a ""no-brainer"" for failing XRX, but not for HPQ shareholders. If HPQ was properly valued by the market it would be well over $30."
"I added a few more shares under $15. I don't see any other stock with as much security as HPQ has. It's earnings are more than covering its generous dividend, and it is sitting on billions of dollars in cash. It will benefit if the virus dies down, but it will also sell a lot of at home laptops etc. if the virus continues and people and students are forced to continue to work from home. Good luck!"
"HPQ closed this week with almost 15% jump. With more and more people working from home, HPQ sales will surge dramatically in the pandemic! Excited to see the earnings in coming week! Cheers and have a great Memorial Day weekend!"
Solid State Power going public that will bring Silicon cells to Ford and BMW.This may have positive impact to Silicon demand.This indirectly bring Silicon battery to main stage. A positive sign to both HPQ and PYR.
I've got 500 shares @$15.09 today. I do think there was a major overreaction to earnings report.
"well guys, 35$+ easy"
"Looks like a decent open. It definitely looks like this stock is moving up anticipating decent earnings. Considering it was well over a buck higher just a short time ago, I believe the resistance may continue to give way as we approach the 27th. Good luck!"
Carl Icahn is so old he probably thinks XRX still makes fax machines.
sorry to you guys who bought because of everything money channel on youtube.there old guys that only invest in dying company
"bought at 20.60 and don't have much confidence in this stock. I planned on shorting it, but not sure where it has to go from here? It exceeded earnings reports, jumped a bit, and I feel ready to get out. Thoughts?"
"HP downward stock price movement on Friday made no sense:1) strong revenue and earnings grwoth in Q22) upside revision of full year earnings forecast with and expected P/E of 8ish (and we know they normally beat expectations)3) FCF of $1.3B in Q2 and at least $4B for the year against $36B in market cap4) At least $4B shares buy back expected in the year (more than 12% of existing shares)Some chip shortage is expected due to strongest demand, but hey not being able to keep up with balooning demand is a nice problem to have and anyway this is already factored in earnings and FCF guidance.Gross share price manipulation occurred IMO"
Very nice close. I am expecting another profitable quarter from HPQ.
UBS rates HPQ a buy with a $25 price target.
"Even though they beat by 10%, this stock could still trade down. Be careful, folks."
just placed an order for another 100 shares @ 27.55. The market is overreacting. The chip shortage will eventually go away.
It would only take a bit of good newsfor the price to recover.
"If the numbers are good Monday evening and guidance solid as well, this could pop 8% and then say goodbye to $24/s. 30% premium for takeover is a standard that would lead to >$30/s."
I haven't done any serious DD on HP but is it just me or is this company extremely undervalued ?
"I just don't understand why this stock has not rallied with the rest of the tech stocks, but I'm still going to buy on the dips-their pc business seems to be strong,and they have money to work with"
Bouncing back nicely. Still time to buy the dip with stellar earnings still to come according to the company.
Seems it will recover by EOD
Looks like HPQ is working on its financing to take advantage of low rates. That's a good thing.
"""HP has cited a number of reasons for declining Xerox’s hostile takeover bid. The Palo Alto-based company stated that it has consulted Goldman Sachs GS and Guggenheim Securities to determine the deal’s financial worth. Both investment research firms are of the view that Xerox’s offer is inadequate from a financial point of view.HP also believes the alliance would disproportionately benefit Xerox shareholders. Additionally, HP’s board questioned Xerox’s operational inexperience in handling PCs, 3D printing, and digital manufacturing businesses. The inadequate experience could lead to risks and uncertainties for the combined companies."""
Company had a larger market cap in 2017 monkaHmm
"“PC sales were great. They have become essential. We are seeing a trend where there used to be one to two PCs per home; now, it is one per person at home because they are needed for work and learning,” HP Chief Executive Enrique Lores told MarketWatch in a phone call before the results were announced. “This is driving demand.”Reflecting its optimism, the company offered fourth-quarter adjusted earnings guidance of 50 cents to 54 cents a share. FactSet analysts had expected 50 cents a share."
What gives?Just a run of the mill 5% down day for good measure?
Wad de top s&p bottom mover??? Wads going on?
Buy the dip. Demand is bottled up. Chip shortage will be a thing of the past in time.
"I would ask why HPQ is rising, but obviously the stock is a solid value play with rising earnings and the printer business should benefit from the reopening."
"Very easy, X increases price to ~35+ or simply do not vote for any of their directors"
"Pretty much one of the few undervalued companies in tech, it even pays a dividend… and people getting out because wait, it can’t meet demand? Lol"
HPQ will pop up tomorrow beating on revenue and EPS. Excellent management. Look for increase immediately.
"HPQ posted better-than-expected results for its fiscal third quarter, driven by a spike in consumer PC demand, which was partially offset by weakness in commercial printer sales. The company also showed strong progress on its cost cutting plan and resumed an aggressive stock repurchase program.For the quarter ended July 31, HP (ticker: HPQ) posted revenue of $14.3 billion, down 2% from a year ago, but about $1 billion ahead of Wall Street analyst expectations. Non-GAAP profits were 49 cents a share, ahead of both the company’s guidance range of 39 to 45 cents, and the Street consensus of 43 cents.“It was a very strong quarter at both the top and bottom lines,” CEO Enrique Lores said in an interview with Barron’s. “We’re making progress on our innovation strategy in both printers and PCs.”Revenue from the company’s Personal Systems segment was up 7% year-over-year and 25% sequentially, driven by a huge spike in notebooks, with revenues up 30% from a year ago and 44% sequentially. But desktop PC revenues were down 29% from a year ago and 9% sequentially. Commercial revenue in the segment was down 6%, while consumer was up 42%. HP shipped 18 million PCs in the quarter, a record. Overall units were up 11%, with notebook units up 32%, and desktop units down 30%."
HPQ is going to hit new 52-week highs in the next month or less. I think earnings will surprise.
"p/e 10.18, it's a joke. what's the reason for it? old technology?"
"I believe HPQ earning would be above estimates and stock goes above $20.HP Inc. to Announce Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings on August 27, 2020.I bought $19 call options."
Good Luck y'all!
So undervalued
"Clarification on prior post. It was HPE & HPQ vs. Oracle as it arose before they split into to companies. However they have agreed to split any proceeds received 50/50. While this lawsuit has gone on for a long time, the end is certainly much closer than the beginning. I am hopeful that the two sides will either settle very shortly or ( as I am a stockholder of HPE) the Calif Supreme Court declines to hear the case within the next 30 days which, based on my readings , is entirely possible. In my opinion the Calif Supreme Court even taking the case and Oracle winning is the least likely scenario - based on all my reading plus the SEC filings of both HPE and Oracle. My guess is that #1 they settle within the next 30 days and both HPE & HPQ get a lot of money. #2. The Supreme Court declines to hear the appeal from Oracle. Automatically HPE & HPQ get even more money. # 3 ( my least likely possibility) The Supreme Court agrees to take the appeal and it takes 1.5 years to reach a new decision. So an additional $500 million in accrued interest later, either HPE & HPQ split over $5 billion or Oracle wins and HPE & HPQ get nothing. So HPE & HPQ have a couple ways to win Big money and Oracle has one. So far HPE & HPQ have been winning."
"I double my current position at the close. HPQ's computer sales should be strong as many schools are going at least partially virtual. All my business friends say their companies are getting them new computers in anticipation of them continuing to work from home. HPQ""s corporate printing sales will suffer until the pandemic gets under control, but I believe HPQ will hold its own everything considered. I was surprised to see XRX bounce so much, and I think that is a far weaker holding than HPQ.Stay safe and have a good weekend!"
Latest report from Reuters updated the bid from 27B to 33B
"Wow, HPQ had great earnings, yet it is selling off. Go figure! Anyone adding more here?"
"I'm an HPQ employee. These were record earnings. I just bought 200 @30.19. Our stock never does what you would expect. Net revenue was also on the mark. The dweebs have no clue. I agree with a post below, we are undervalued and we should by the end of the year be at $45 IMHO."
Jumped in at 15.02 just as the market opened. I figured it was a no brainer. I am so glad it didn't go much lower. I will add more if it does. This stock is a great opportunity even at 17 or 18. It should be 20.
does anyone see this going up in next 6 months or do I secure long term profits..
So since I couldn't get an answer from anyone I looked into the earnings call on 3D. It is completely in a nascent form and they aren't reporting any revenues at all from it. I'm not going to price in a section of their business that isn't even a business yet.
It was a better buy at 15. A good long term hold. Could still buy more.
"Company has transformed into a future technology company without most people noticing. Revenue growth is accelerating and will continue for the next several quarters. Quietly gaining market share in the 3D printer market which is still a small, niche market but is profitable already. They’ve exited the markets that were too commoditized - phones and tablets. They are still in the value areas where they can differentiate themselves with superior products and added value."
can anybody translate the news on debt tender offers from today?
It wil go back to $27 and everyone will rush to sell thinking this company is not worth more than that. Fact is they are doing tons of things on the 3D print . It wont be long before this stock hits in the $50's like some of the other 3D print stocks.
"HP expects 12.5%-22.5% earnings growth during the second quarter, which easily beats the consensus estimate for 10% growth. For the full year, HP anticipates 15%-21% earnings growth -- which also crushes Wall Street's forecast for 10% growth.HP stock currently trades at just 11 times this year's earnings. When we combine that figure with its forward yield of 2.6%, and assuming HP hits the midpoint of its earnings guidance for 2018 of $1.95 per share, HP seems like a rock-solid investment for conservative income investors."
Will enter @ $28
"Dell vs HPQ, $95 vs $28, eps 20vs10, which is a better buy"
Sleeping dragon!
Beat the estimate and grew 11%. But no raise in share price. Need to wait after CC and see what will happen tomorrow
"Report out that personal computer sales slid more than expected. HPQ's sales reportedly increased, but not as much as expected. But hey, if HPQ is buying back shares, the dip will help them buy more shares and boost profit per share."
guess far below real value... isn't it ?
"With the great report how come the stock price is going down from the high today? It could be option day. I hope Monday will start to go back up, we only had five price increases today by the analysts"
"Okay im no pro here when it comes to stock. HOWEVER shouldnt this be on the rise at this point with constant reports above estimates ? How could people really be confused about separation of Executive control over the two different companies cause this to fall and remain stale this morning? Please Advise if you have input, thanks."
Can someone logically explain this price action? Thanks.
"Barron's article says that XRX reportedly has met numerous times with HPQ large shareholders, and they want tte higher valuation that will come with an XRX/HPQ combination. XRX's tender offer will allow them to vote their belief and bypass HPQ. It makes sense to me for HPQ to sit down and start talks to negotiate the best they can. Good luck!"
"HP and BASF develop industrial-grade polypropylene for additive manufacturingBy GlobeNewswireJun 04, 2020BASF and HP today announced an expansion of their strategic alliance to advance digital manufacturing. Together, the companies are working closely with innovators in the auto, consumer, medical, and industrial manufacturing sectors to open up new market opportunities, jointly develop new best-in-class applications, and achieve unmatched quality, breakthrough economics, and more sustainable production.At the center of the expanded collaboration is the launch of a first-of-its-kind polypropylene (PP) for additive manufacturing. The HP 3D High Reusability PP enabled by BASF was developed and qualified for HP’s Jet Fusion 5200 Series 3D printing solution to enable companies across industries to design and produce 3D printed parts faster, more cost-effectively, more sustainably, and at higher volumes than ever before.“The advancement of our long-standing partnership with HP truly demonstrates our shared vision to help transform industries, enable sustainable production, and enable our customers to shape the Additive Manufacturing industrialization,” said François Minec, Managing Director, BASF 3D Printing Solutions. BASF 3D Printing Solutions unveiled its new Forward AM brand last year as it continues to pursue its goal of driving industrial scalability with future-oriented, leading-edge materials and technology. “The introduction of PP is another important step as we collaborate on best-in-class materials to transform manufacturing.

"HPQ is not cutting the dividend. In fact the next dividend will be paid very shortly. With $4 billion in cash, HPQ will not be cutting the dividend any time in the foreseeable future. Their cash earnings have been sufficient to cover their dividend nicely. That's why HPQ at $15 is one of the safest stocks out there. IMHO. Good luck!"
Some stocks MSFT AMD INTC DELL always sell off even beat estimates same Happen with HPQ always sell off nothing wrong  beat every where
The stock is $20 and change after a good quarter and they expect their $22 bid is still good enough? Come on now.
Patient paid off on this one. Bought for 15-16ish and wanted to so much to sell when it popped to 18.5 that same week. But held on an collected the divvy
Forward P/E under 10 plus a dividend? Am I seeing this right?
"I work for a VAR and right now we have huge demand for HP, Dell, and Lenovo products. From small companies to Enterprise. The problem right now is that EVERYTHING IS SOLD. Distribution shelves are EMPTY. I think this is going to be a big quarter for HP Inc.... Possibly dull going into 2nd quarter though.Products that are no longer available. LaptopsDocking stations.MonitorsPrinters (Single user to mid level ""Pro series"")AIO'sMFP'sGone--Almost nothing left to sell."
Cannot believe this incompetent CEO isn't merging with Xerox already. One of the very few deals that make absolutely sense but he's just happy and fat.
"22$ a share not going happen. without buy out, stock already almost at 22$. try again at 28$ a share !"
"I've endeavored to do more nice things for folks each day, so here's my attempt with HPQ holders. Full disclosure, I recently retired at the age of 52 after working for HP for 17 years on the printer side (prior to that I was in consulting). While I am very appreciative of the salary I made at HP, the reason I was able to retire early is because every penny I put away in savings from that place was put into other companies not in declining industries and unable to innovate. I also sold every HPQ option I ever had immediately when it vested and, again, invested in other companies. I know many of you see this thing and think it's grossly undervalued, but I'm here to tell you it's a classic value trap that will continue to bleed you dry and, best case, keep you even. Yes, they make good money, especially on print, but that stuff is declining rapidly and the company has proven time and again that they have no ability to innovate and pivot on to the next great thing....and the stock price has reflected that fact for the past 20 years. My prediction is it will only get worse as they continue to try to figure out ways to ""make print relevant"" again while the rest of the world continues to move on."
finally a good day made couple thousands finally....will stay away from HP for the time being
"The biggest electronic retailer reports tomorrow. I hope they have some good breakouts about CPU volumes during the quarter. If not I'll buy more calls on any weakness tomorrow. I'm pretty sure large bulk orders by industry and schools is going to be the driver for HPQ and Dell, but I'd love for the retailer to tell us they can't keep laptops in stock."
"I retook a sizable position on today's drop. With remote learning going to be the norm this coming school year despite what Trump wants, I expect a lot of laptops are going to have to be purchased. With Asia and the rest of the world handling the pandemic much better than we are, I expect HPQ's supply chain should be fine. Their corporate printing will still be down, but many states in the northeast are handling their re-opening in a responsible way. I believe HPQ also has some gaming products which should do well. At this level, HPQ is a good buy because they can make money during the pandemic, and they will thrive if and when things go back to normalStay well and stay safe. Good luck!"
I tripled my shares at around $15. This seems like a gift as HPQ is already beaten up near its lows and trading as it is going out of business with no hope which is not the case.
"Great news out just this minute. PC shipments were up 11% Y/Y and HPQ topped the market with 18 M units shipped. For the industry, volume is expected to be the highest since the end of 2009. Let us see if this gives HPQ a boost tomorrow. I expect a nice up move, provided we have a reasonably decent up market."
Icahn should convince Xerox to pay more rather than telling HP to accept a Low price.
"HPQ actually has a lot of potential in the 3d printing market. An underestimated market wich is expected to rapidly grow in the ucoming years. This will the change the global manufacturing industry. They have a lot of room left to grow there! It will ultimately be beneficial for a lot of companys to instantly print a replacement for a broken part, instead of ordering a new part or even a new machine. Having a 3d printer in a factory will become the new standard. I wouldn't invest in on other 3d printing companies knowing HPQ operates in its market."
"Just read where Intel is going to make 15 in. laptops and sell them to smaller companies to market on their own. The price point is expected to be $999 to $1499. It is expected to help them compete with Dell, HPQ, etc. I wonder how much of a problem this will be for HPQ as a big chunk of their pandemic sales are coming from laptop sales."
HP is down 4.98% to 27.65
"this is a neglected one. P/E 13.46,pay dividends $0.78 cents. compared with Dell, no dividends, P/E 23.14, pps $78, HPQ pps should be at least $50+, why it stays around $30?, any good reasons for it?"
"I am buying. Cheap by any metric. Nice dividend, buyback. Enormous free cash flow. Got anything better?"
HPQ stock is buy?
"With all the HP computer purchases, home office movements, not to mention home office printers, cartridges and so on, I think HP will surprise our earnings. Any comments? Long HP. GLTA"
"I guess we'll soon see how this plays out. Sometimes you just have to buy something based on what you see and hear around you. I can't help but see all the telework and virtual schooling going on as a benefit to this company and this quarter. I probably should have dug a little deeper into the printer side of things, and hopefully that number shows improvement from last quarter. My hopes for tomorrow are .55 per share and good guidance for the at least the next quarter. Continued affirmation of dividend and buy-backs would be nice as well. I fully expect them to smash that lowball estimate, but without good guidance going forward (which most companies seem hesitant to provide), I don't know if this will move as much as we'd like. They know how many orders they already booked since the quarter ended, if it's good (as I suspect it is) please tell us."
"Looks like all other Pc companys are reasonably valued, HPQ has huge potential to beat the market this year"
"""For fiscal 2021, HP estimates GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $2.98 to $3.08 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.25.""Multiply that by a reasonable PE ratio like 15-20. That's where HPQ should be."
News article on CNBC states that Xerox can afford to offer up to $26 per share
first time share holder of HPQ. That Q2 wasn't that bad. nother even close to deserving a 12% drop
Now is the time to buy HPQ according to most analystshttps://www.cryptoamber.com/2019/03/06/nows-the-time-to-buy-hp-inc-hpq-7-analysts-says/
P/E of 10 ish and a divvy of 2.6%lol. People must be blind.
"Reason prevails as HPQ is bouncing back quickly. The chip shortage will pass, and HPQ will be able to meet demand when it does. In the meantime, pricing power will keep profits up."
"Why no love? What mnore can a company do? They beat estimates on revenue and earnings. They raised estimates for the next quarter. They raised the dividend 10%. They will keep repurchasing stock @ $1 Billion per quarter (3% @ $22). Yet, analysts target prices as of today range from $21 from Credit Suisse to $26 fpr UBS, Morgan Stanley and JPM. What do they see that I don't? A falloff in home computer demand when we cet a vaccine? Won't this be balanced by more orders from office restocking? Very frustrating, especially for a long term value investor. Or one of the few bargains in this FAANG world?"
My post got deleted for whatever reason. Record earnings and net revenue were on target. HPQ has plenty of room to grow. I have no idea what people are doing when they don't look at the math and numbers and the guidance going forward.
"$30 no less. I invested in HPQ movement towards rapid manufacturing. Loss in 2d revenue matters little to me. HP has built a grwt foundation to grow their presence in 3d manufacturing and partnering with the correct parties. Notice I'm referencing 3d MANUFACTURING, not 3d RP or prototyping. Next industrial revolution is upon us and it involve 3 ingredients... A. I. , IoT , and 3D printer manufacturing of any material to fully finished part. The rest of us are officially obsolete. We are witnessing the first steam locomotive vs the horse. Plenty if naysayers then, but all it takes is time. Technology will replace the need for any of us to produce anything. Just not sure how long it will take."
Can someone explain to me where xerox is a small company with less revenue ￼was trying to buy out HPQ which is double there size ? What am l missing here ?
I've got 500 shares @$15.09. I'm tempted to sell and reinvest but I think this is a hold.
"With the shift to work from home you would think HP is selling a lot more PC's, Printers, and supporting items like monitors, ink, toner, paper, etc. HPQ should be moving higher once the light comes on for Investors."
"People don't care for companies making money anymore, or what?"
Knowing how strange this stock is trading I wouldn't doubt if it goes up after divy payout
$HPQ Upgraded by JPMorgan Chase Neutral » Overweight USD 28 » USD 38 Target Raised by Cowen Market Perform USD 23 » USD 27
"Well, it looks like HPQ is entering the must buy territory again. With virus issues increasing again, their laptops should remain in great demand. They also have some game accessories coming out, so that should help. If I free some money up soon, I will add some more below $16,Good luck!"
"This lack of volume is disturbing. If hp was going to blow away earnings resulting in a probable stock price increase, wouldn’t hp buy shares now why the price is lower IF they are going to buy shares?"
"For what it is worth. I don't agree with the projected decline in laptop sales, but I do believe print sales will suffer. https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/04/14/heres-why-hewlett-packards-stock-could-touch-10/#3982b3271e62"
"This was a reply to a comment, but I would like to share as a post so it can have more visibility...Bought this 3 yrs ago and already back in the green. This was on the rise towards $30 long before Xerox nonsense. Ask yourself this, did HP make money in the 2D printing business over the past 5 decades.... YES, very big YES! They will repeat this same plan in the 3D print space. They're already setting up manufacturing to depend on their platform thus ensuring people will need their consumables. And the icing on the cake is that their 3D printers are part of their manufacturing capacity as the printer prints close to 50% of its own parts. Your supply manufactures your supply and you control the materials it uses to print with. You dont get more vertically aligned and insulated, nor more agile than that! Buy some shares and watch the next few decades. People saw the supply chain scare with the pandemic and realize manufacturing cant be centralized to one geographic/geopolitical area. 3D print is on the rise, get in now and enjoy the show!"
I heard about HPQ the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
How does HP share price reflect recent news of Xerox withdrawing their takeover bid?
I bought 600 at 19.99 last week. Lost 700 dollars
"HP (HPQ) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.52 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.50 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.43 per share a year ago.Don’t know why the stock is down!!"
$38.69 per HPQ share and we have a done deal Xerox ;)
"HP is fine. Earnings season is almost always like this. Even if they were to hit every number perfectly, the price will still drop because it didn't beat as much as they thought it should and so on. Solid company, low debt, and lots of cash. $15 is a great entry."
Breaking out with the opening up of the economy just in time for good earnings in a bit over a week!
"I sold on the big run-up, and I bought 500 shares on today's dip. HP is selling a lot of laptops, and that will continue for quite some time. Schools and colleges in my state are going virtual, so demand will continue to grow. Printer sales for the home should be decent, but corporate sales will be off. Their 3D progress is not real clear to me. HPQ reportedly is also buying back shares, so I think the next quarter should be decent. Good luck."
excellent earnings-expect this up tomorrow-
Barron's online magazine had a pretty positive article on HPQ's prospects. Most analysts they quoted said the stock would do fine and maintained their price targets. I just bought 1k shares. Good luck.
"I think Xerox is pushing the merger because they have little to no footprint in the 3d space. HP Inc has been building a great foundation to succeed in this space and be one if the critical components for the next industrial revolution. 2D printing has caused strife for HP but only in existing revenue, not what they're building. This stock will turn around within the next 6 years and will look similar to AT&T in terms of share value and dividend. Xeroxs days are numbered, they know, they know time is key. This is why theyret pushing so hard. Titanic (2D/paper print) is sinking, and Xerox is fight for a spot in a lifeboat. I hope longs in this stock bought as a value stock and plan to hold for many years. Xerox deal would represent a bargain deal for them and would reduce my ownership more than I'd like. Under $30/share = no deal. Not from me!"
This was the most undervalued best play on stock market a few weeks ago
It appeared that the HPQ CEO was very confident that the company would meet their predictions. He said they were managing supply issues and were confident that they could keep their production goals. Earnings could be even better as the company can now buy back shares much cheaper.
"At 8-9X PE, 2.58% yield and 3D printing; this is a steal."
we should have pop at least 2 points or more.
They are gonna increase dividend n the outlook looks strong on laptops sales
So undervalued.... how is this 1/3 of DELL? Minimum PT by the end of this year $40-$45
"Ok, Xerox. Olay hardball. I call BS. HP has waaaay more value and is still making all the right partnerships to position mutli jet fusion printer to be a huge success. I bought HPQ because of the company's commitment to 3D printing manufacturing (not rp prototyping). Xeeix can take a hike as far as I'm concerned. Go straight to shareholders, I don't think it will work out well for them. This stock has huge growth potential and we've steady increase in yield. Why would I sell this and for a bargain? 2D soace is shrinking. The layoffs were because of that and trade wars. I see it as a good thing for a long term business strategy. Experts cam devalue the stock all they want, but HP will rattle the manufacturing industry within the next 10 yrs and thats why I have owned this stock since spring of 2017. No sale, no thank you."
"As expected, HPQ management is going to tell Carl (Icahn) to take a hike. LOL (Bloomberg) -- HP Inc. said it will respond to Xerox Holdings Corp.’s planned tender offer on Feb. 24, when the company reports earnings, again promising shareholders a path to boost the personal-computer maker’s value.“HP will share additional information about its plan to drive sustainable long-term value for its shareholders, including through the execution of the company’s multi-year strategic and financial plan and the deployment of its strong balance sheet,” the Palo Alto, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement."""
Beat everything
Deutche Bank raised price target to $32 from $30.
"With staking becoming the new norm in cryptos, chip shortages will clear up faster than predicted. However, accounts payable is massive, so there is a big backorder of them that will take a while. It won't be until sometime mid 2022. This is one of the companies I feel at ease owning for a long time."
"My theme on tech stocks which miss or take a decent dip is unless there's an upcoming catalyst, which there really isn't in this area of tech, with the market at these levels I will just wait for the next known catalyst (could be earnings) and with the market at these levels it's more likely it's just park itself for a while. So without news and if the market does not break out soon (It's pretty extended) this gets to 20 sometime and you can wait."
If you don't buy in at this level of discount for HPQ step off the stock exchange floor. 24.00 by next week!!
"Lazy, I haven't been seeing your posts because I muted you. I was thinking tough, if you really have 20K shares and you held from where I sold in the high $23 range, you are down $120K from there. Ouch! Now all of us investors have taken a hit, but sometimes a little reason needs to be applied when dealing with situations like this. I actually bought and sold 800 shares of HPQ when the Fed offered some liquidity news. I was only a $300+ gain, but every little bit helps. Let's hope Congress comes up with a plan to support the market and our economy. I have lost the little confidence I had in our fearless leader. Good luck!"

"Considering the massive selling volume, HPQ seems to have found some support. Today's volume could be in the neighborhood of four times normal. When the selling eases, I expect those who bought higher or are looking for a bargain with a great dividend will begin to push the stock up again. Although HPQ is under some stress, it is and should remain profitable even if the virus makes a come back. How many stock can say that.Good luck!"
"I worked for hp for 1/2 of my life and i am retirement age. Be sure that they have huge amounts of pent up demand for PCs and printers. The only reason for the small miss in revenue is due to suppliers inability to supply sufficient qtys of parts from asia during coronavirus. That has been resolved now. Regarding cash flow, hp has always stocked up on strategic components during times like the last few months when there are risks to strategic component supplies. Inventory will go down, cash flow will go up, sales will increase dramatically and they will start to reward shareholders more with buybacks. This quarter was Feb-Apr at a time when most of their factories were shut down, followed by 2 months of shutdowns in USA and other countries and they still beat EPS."
i am quite new to the market. what does that mean for an investor if the company buys shares back? is this the opposite of dilution? so the SP should go up?
"Well, I hope HPQ took this opportunity to buy back shares. I added a little on a good till cancel I threw in at yesterday's low. I didn't think I would get filled, but I did. Hey. we know HPQ is going to have good earnings with the company's statements and the buying back of shares. I am just sitting on my shares, and buying the dips if I can find or make the cash. Good luck!"
"HPQ buys out HyperX for $425million. Only went public an hour ago, quick buy your options early."

"HP has been around forever... it's a real company with real employees and real products .. not some idea and pretty simulation video on Youtube. Yes it's an old, slow dog with arthritis and a hundred scars. They seem to be serious about 3d printing. What do you guys think? They certainly have the customer base and enough employees they can fire or replace to make it happen?Anyways.. I have a point.. The stock market can't possibly be a reflection of a companies worth and potential, it's just a smoke and mirror hype machine where over and over people buy into unproven ideas."
Carl Ichan is in this for himself. Not HPQ shareholders.
Unbelievable people bought yesterday and sold today just to get 16c dividend....Why not selling at above $22 a few weeks from now?
"Folks, hopefully any day we are going to here that Oracle has settled their lawsuit with HPE&HPE to the toon of a couple Billion Each. A lawsuit against Oracle was filed around 10 years ago and Oracle lost the Jury trial, was denied their petition for a new trial and on June 14, 2021 lost their appeal to the Calif Court of Appeals in a unanimous decision. In July they appealed to the Calif Supreme Court. which chooses which cases they agree to review and usually only accept a small fraction of such requests. The tab now is about $4.6 Billion and interest is $1 million a day per SEC filings by HPE. So, Oracle has incentive to settle to stop the interest costs and before the Calif Supreme Court makes a decision to take the case or not. Even if they take the case it could be 1-2 years before they reach a verdict which could add another $500 million to the award if the lose. Of course, if the court says they will not take up the appeal, things are even worse for Oracle than they are today. The court may rule in the next 30 days. Or they may settle at any time depending on how much HPQ &HPE are willing to reduce the amount. Given their winning streak, they are in an excellent position."
This should be a blue chip stock
This 12% drop was uncalled for !! HPQ will be back at $17 in a week or two. Just got me this HP Dragonfly... it works like a charm. Better than an Apple computer. https://store.hp.com/us/en/mdp/hp-elite-dragonfly?jumpstart=ma_lt_hero_na_4_200527

stellar quarter great company. bought more about $29.5.
HPQ will be undergoing a tremendous buyback over the next 12 months that could exceed 70% of their current market value!! Tuesdays annual meeting should be interesting.
What is the prediction on ER?
"Share price needs to move north a bit, because it deserves it."
The drop is insane. They trounced earnings. The only reason they didn't beat on revenue is because of a chip shortage due to COVID. They guided up for the year. The thing I found interesting is that shipments weren't constrained by CPU availability. Printing is up. Everything is up. They're making a profit of nearly $1 per quarter or $4 EPS per year. Even at a PE of 10 this is a $40 stock.
"It's no brainer to buy at dips. This stock can only go up due to the fact that most jobs will be shifted home based and many folks need laptops, PCs, Printers, etc.. The earnings report is promising when compared other stocks. Loaded up HPQ @ 15 and hope for a good return."
"Does anyone understand what is happening? Revenues above of expectations, and the stock felling nearly 7%! I dont understand why HPE CEO step down will affect that much HPQ"
I'm thinking that Xerox cant get the funding to offer more than $22 a Share...some hedge fund better step up to help them.
wind at your back until $50...

Globally, 2.1 million units of 3D printers were shipped in 2020 and the shipments are expected to reach 15.3 million units by 2028. The aggressive R&D in three-dimensional printing (3DP) and the growing demand for prototyping applications from various industry verticals, particularly healthcare, automotive, and aerospace and defense, are expected to drive market growth."
This is the sleeping giant. I keep buying calls for monthly income in little blue. HPQ is easy month in that sense
