9 p/e ratio? Sign me up :) Can't wait for the 3D print future.
"In case anyone is interested, HPQ is the second largest investment in the PRNT ETF, with $19.46M held representing 4.1% of their holdings. DM is in 4th place with 3.96% and SSYS at 3.95%. DDD is 9th with 3/81%. PRNT is a 3D Printing ETF with $461M in net assets and 56 holdings."
Finally got above water on my HPQ investment! I'm pretty loyal to HP and own a great all in one printer that has performed excellent for over 8 years! I also just picked up a laptop to help support my investment. Go HPQ!
They had some interesting insights about HPQ on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Share repurchase is where it's at!
I imagine HPQ has been buying back shares at these depressed prices. Beating earnings is easy when you keep reducing the number of shares outstanding. Buybacks also save on the dividends that would have to be paid out.
Barron's has an article why HP is a screaming buy! I totally agree.
"""Fiscal 2022 earnings, excluding some items, will be $4.07 to $4.27 a share, Chief Financial Officer Marie Myers said Wednesday during an online investor presentation. That’s higher than analysts’ average estimate of $3.78 a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg."""
"I am highly concerned with HPQs huge debt/capitol ratio at 188%! And -197% long-term debt to equity as of this quarter. And with supply-chain problems, I wouldn't get to excited to leap into a buy!"
Dividend raised to $1.00. This buys me lots of ink cartridges going forward
"Great earnings forecast, increased dividend, and 100% of free cash flow to shareholders and buybacks. As good as it gets!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"recorded for future reference: lost almost 3%from day high after ceo said the supply chain issue continues into next year, from $29.3 to $28.5 jmo, this thing should be traded around 90 compared to pe for dell. but investors don't agree with me, so they give it $28+ for now."
"Two upcoming catalysts.......we have the ER at the end of November, and it looks like it could be a great one. Guidance will be key. Then we have the deadline for ORCL to appeal the lawsuit to the SCOTUS by the end of the year. If that doesn't happen, we can expect to get ~$2.25B in cash from Oracle. That can pay down debt or buy back a lot of shares. I don't want it spent on dividends as a stock price increase is more beneficial to me."
It's running today headed right in the direction of it's TARGET Price.
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
Running today right towards it's TARGET Price.
Selling at about 1/2 of annual sales!! Totally undervalued! Just a matter of time before this gets to a realistic valuation.
Going higher next week... $31
