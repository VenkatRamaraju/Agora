"Going to take me years of dividends to make back the capital losses of CAH. When I'm at break-even, I'm out."
becoming a pattern. big sell off in the morning then slow crawl the rest of the day back near even.
I am not sure if one can totally trust yahoo finance statistics. U have noticed more than few mistakes. This company is showing d/e ratio close to 375 and bv of around 6. Is anyone concerned about these or what am I missing. I like the dividend and company’s cash position with $11+ per share.
"At this price it's almost a 4% dividend,.great entry price!"
Anyone else afraid to buy any dips in fear that it will dip more?
One of the absolute worst healthcare stocks over the past 12 months. CAH has never recovered from last years $20 price drop.
What am I missing with this stock? Seems to be treading down incrementally daily.In at 800 shares at $52 average
Nearly a 4% yield here
"To much corruption in this company. CEO, CFO… directors, chairman, management don’t knows how to run business. Abuse investors money. Supervisors of most divisions are poorly trained. Act like dummy robot. They created so much things to do , it not related to the job, spent tens of millions dollars to travel to enjoying vacation under business cost."
"DUBLIN, Ohio, Aug. 11, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH) announced today that it has extended its agreements with CVS Health to distribute pharmaceuticals to retail pharmacies and distribution centers through June 30, 2027."
"3.5% dividend, 30% payout ratio, forward PE of 9. Seems like an obvious buy, like CNC was on their ER. Opinions?"
CAH has been in neutral mode but a down word motion with NO news . A lot of insider stuff is going on without our knowledge. When they share the news we will pop big . Hold on .
"$CAH and $CVS will be huge winners.....profitable, low valuations, inflation hedges, aging populations, government spending in health care, Covid/vaccination tail winds. Good luck longs...."
Does anyone know why much of the daily volume for CAH takes place right at the end of regular trading hours without much variation in the price?
Dividend ain’t going nowhere …
Hesitate to buy until $42
"From today’s WaPo: ‘Just six companies distributed 75 percent of the pills during this period: McKesson Corp., Walgreens, Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen, CVS and Walmart, according to an analysis of the database by The Washington Post. Three companies manufactured 88 percent of the opioids: SpecGx, a subsidiary of Mallinckrodt; Actavis Pharma; and Par Pharmaceutical, a subsidiary of Endo Pharmaceuticals.Purdue Pharma, which the plaintiffs allege sparked the epidemic in the 1990s with its introduction of OxyContin, its version of oxycodone, was ranked fourth among manufacturers with about 3 percent of the market.The volume of the pills handled by the companies skyrocketed as the epidemic surged, increasing about 51 percent from 8.4 billion in 2006 to 12.6 billion in 2012. By contrast, doses of morphine, a well-known treatment for severe pain, averaged slightly more than 500 million a year during the period.’"
"Better financials than McKesson. Think only few players. With $180 billion in revenue and valued at only $15billion. All it requires is a .5% increase in income / profit to raise this stock significantly. That will happen got to build in some more efficient deliveries or innovation too. With 3.5% dividend too , always rising it’s a great stock. In healthcare too, bonus."
"I'm considering initiating a position in CAH sometime over the next couple days, assuming it stays in the lower $50 range. If I buy, this will go in the more conservative portion of my IRA portfolio with plans to hold long term, reinvesting dividends along the way. Opinions, positive and negative, appreciated. Thank you!"
"From CFRA-- In August, we lifted our view on shares of CAH toBuy from Hold as we think CAH is attractive atcurrent valuations. We see CAH set for bettergrowth in its core business in FY 22 and in thelong-run we think it will likely benefit fromsteadily growing product volumes as babyboomers drive higher health care utilization. Weview the divestiture of the Cordis business,CAH’s global manufacturer of cardiology devicesfor $1B as positive. The transaction is slated toclose in H1 FY 22. Since its 2015 acquisition,Cordis was a significant drag for the Medicalsegment, in our view, due to operationalproblems, inventory write-downs, and mountinglitigation costs.---Consolidation of health insurers, providers, andpharmacy benefit managers has been anongoing trend since 2018. This trend couldpressure CAH's operating margins, in our view,as larger customers are able to negotiate lowerdistribution fees.--- Our price target is $56, 8.9x our FY 23 EPSestimate, lower than CAH’s historical forward P/E average of 120x. Risks include a longer-thananticipated rebound in elective procedures dueto new rising Covid-19 infections, severegeneric price deflation and contract renewals onless favorable terms"
