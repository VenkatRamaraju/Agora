Is there any bad news? I cannot find it. Why it drops so much today?
for decent earnings it sure got hit
"Impressive performance again, it flipping cracks me up that someone has the balls to say the reason they are down because revenues were $0.03 billion less than expected for revenue of $36 B, less than 0.01%. If someone is that good in projecting revenue they are in the wrong business. In reality it is a non-event and what really matters is that both revenue and bottom line grew."
How it is possible that a company with a turnover that is more than $150 billion hardly can being profitable.Is this a buy or a sell? Looks very interesting at first sight. How about the solvency of the company?
Management should seize on this opportunity to take the company private.
"Watching this stock, currently at support area, could be a great entry point here... (Maybe a starter position is the right move)"
what is going on? one of the few red stocks today
"What is going on with $MCK and all the other drug distributors regarding the class action lawsuits involving the opioid epidemic and the congressional inquiry regarding opioid addiction? It seems all drug distributors and producers ( i. e. $MCK, $CAH"
Could be the start :-)
"They’ve done a tremendous job managing PPE inventory to help current customers. Knew they would see a bump from this, just doesn’t get the attention flashy tech stocks do..."
When are we going to see some traction on price?
Looks like they have a lot of products for plasma collection!?
Still dropping. I can see a few percent but this is way high. Something else must be going on that the average investor does not know about. Any clues.
"3.5% dividend, 30% payout ratio, forward PE of 9. Seems like an obvious buy, like CNC was on their ER. Opinions?"

What's the main reason it's going up ?
About time! Really undervalued.
I think CAH will be punished hard today for it's missing on EPS and it's guidance for 2022. Cardinal Health Q4 Non-GAAP EPS of $0.77 misses by $0.43GAAP EPS of $0.40 misses by $0.14.Revenue of $42.6B (+16.1% Y/Y) beats by $2.35B.Fiscal 2022 guidance: Non-GAAP EPS: $5.60-5.90 vs. a consensus of $6.15.
A great upside stock . Health is a big market and they have everything in place to move this stock right back and beyond .
Why the selloff?
Why does Yahoo eps say -0.13? They’re projected to earn close to $5.00 per share this year so their PE ought to be around 10.
"Buy low. Sell high.-Revenues improved 16.1% on a year-over-year basis to $42.59 billion. -For fiscal 2021, revenues were $162.45 billion, up 6.2% from fiscal 2020. The figure beat the consensus mark by 1.7%."
J&J payment was low. So even less for cardinal. All good news.
"""Companies that trade at market prices below their actual values, such as Cardinal Health, are perceived to be undervalued. ""Simply Wall Street 10 days ago.........No more comments."
CVS up this morning and CAH down. I really must have missed something in the earnings or the news that is driving CAH down like this. Anyone have any ideas or knowledge on this?
"Among the underlying components of the Russell 3000 index, we saw noteworthy options trading volume today in Cardinal Health, Inc. (Symbol: CAH), where a total of 12,721 contracts have traded so far, representing approximately 1.3 million underlying shares. That amounts to about 43.8% of CAH's average daily trading volume over the past month of 2.9 million shares. Particularly high volume was seen for the $45 strike call option expiring March 15, 2019 , with 10,124 contracts trading ""so far today, representing approximately 1.0 million underlying shares of CAH. Below is a chart showing CAH's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $45 strike highlighted in orange:"
CGC now has a larger market cap than CAH...
$60 &$65 October strikes
"Initiated a small position today on the nice ~3% yield, which seems safe and upside from takeout potential."
Doing good............If it closes at around last night closing price adjusted for div......we should be A OK.
strong earnings beat and raise dividend aristocrat....10 forward pe
Just sold. Cardinal Health is on the hook for a portion of a $250m settlement for just 2 of thousands of lawsuits. They have basically just set a monetary precedent and admitted culpability in the Opiod crisis. I simply don't understand how a distributor of drugs is held accountable when a valid prescription written by a doctor or a quack is presented. Can somebody explain that to me? Why is Cardinal basically admitting guilt by settling? I am OUT. The risk/reward is now heavily tilted to the risk side of any investment thesis. Will continue to watch.
good divestiture balance sheet getting stronger i'm loading up on March 19 $60 calls currently at 15 cents might go up at least threefold by then in the next few trading days good luck!
"The 1 month chart looks bullish. Here's to hoping we can get some money flowing into CAH, MCK, ABC, etc."
Buy all day long for this over reaction!
"Wow, what a bullish run!"
"We should recover ""some"" tomorrow..........Red days are usually green for income stocks.....Fut are red.......as of now....."
great buy today at this price.
Just bought this dividend aristocrat today. Excited!
why is it dropping?
"Amazon needs to buy a running company like Cardinal to get a base and inside expertise, like they did with Whole Foods!"
This company is on sale! Buy low sell high. That's how money is made.
CFRA upgraded CAH from hold to buy. P.O. $56
looks like some price action
Should start distributing Tesla’s and we could tag it with a 1400 price target
"This looks like low downside risk, good upside potential, and great yield! I'm in."
Amazon won’t do anything. I bought Costco after they bought Whole Foods and look where Costco is right now. Market creates buying opportunities.
"If we get a few upgrades, it’s liftoff time"
Buy a small amount at Friday morning drop. Over sold but not going to fill gap for quite a while.
Perfect time to dollar cost average.
I've been loyal and happy CAH shareholder for about 20 years. It was once the flagship of my portfolio..... I started selling off about 6 weeks ago and sold the last of it yesterday. it is sad. I was sorry to have to leave.
Very little posting here for unknown reasons. This is an oligopoly business and an aging population. Opioid settlement sending it up today.
"I started a position on Monday, September 1 at $48.92. Seems like a pretty good entryfor long term dividend growth play. Also started GD on Monday, and BEN last week at $21.18 (more a turnaround play, but also a dividend grower, but with fund outflows they need to arrest to keep that up.)."

"Just a big surprise to see the low point of the week be after such a great Earnings report. There must have been something in there that I didn't see that is a big negative. CVS is also down today, but not on the same scale as CAH."
-3.6% with no news? Whats going on?
"What better company to distribute the Cannabis products? They're already getting kicked in the #$%$ for taking the hit of Opioid malfeasance. Errrrrr, I mean ahem... Malpractice......Why not simply integrate/standardize their logistics model nationwide? Seems logical to me, to create the perfect distribution scapegoat, to protect the pharmacies and medical prescription issuers.I hope I'm not violating any Yahoo TAO with this comment. ""Scooby Doo HUH?"""
"At this price it's almost a 4% dividend,.great entry price!"
"Two large research and investment houses upgraded CAH to $57 and $64. It is amazing how the stock is still below $50. It is difficult to understand who is selling at these levels! Do people not have any type of common sense that this is a great company and a serious play against the Pandemic. America opens up and elective surgeries will go through the roof. Likewise, the Pandemic will still demand the PPEs from CAH. The company is benefiting from both directions!"
Guggenheim upgraded this to a buy.
CAH reached a new 52 Week Low at 53.89
"Better financials than McKesson. Think only few players. With $180 billion in revenue and valued at only $15billion. All it requires is a .5% increase in income / profit to raise this stock significantly. That will happen got to build in some more efficient deliveries or innovation too. With 3.5% dividend too , always rising it’s a great stock. In healthcare too, bonus."
CAH getting some love today

"People are selling as soon as it goes up a few cents driving it back down. No confidence in CAH to rally. I sold at 47.30 yesterday and if it keeps selling off, I may have to buy it again tomorrow. Ex- div. date is 9/30."
I loaded up last month in the $48 range. I'm looking at a price target of $65 for some big gains!
Anybody see the 60 minutes show this week? Tobacco killer lawyer has his sights aimed at all opiod distributors. He claims that under the Controlled Substances Act distributors should have and were requirwed to have known that delivering thousands of pills to small pharmacies didn't pass the smell test. He's looking for Billions in lawsuits or settlements. Any ideas?
Great buy here
"Haha. This is why I bought MCK, ABC, and CAH. Listen. Doctors offices were closed and just now opening for more routine exams, etc. so there is pent up demand on the restart too. Don't sell. It's a great sector to be in for now."
Who's to say CAH won't be supplying Pillpack the pharmaceuticals they'll be selling at some point. They need to get their drugs from somewhere. Hmmm...
Gosh..........this reminds you to sell your shares as soon as you make some profit...............Buy and Hold is not the way to go.
"I'll buy-in full boat tomorrow just got 2000 yesterday, it's a go"
Buyers are coming in. Rotation is positive. Hopefully we stick to it.
"When Are You Guys On Wall Street going to comprehend that CAH is a logistics, and appliance company? They're partnered with McKesson to deliver the drugs, and other medical appliances! They're material handling just happens to include Pharmaceuticals!"
LQQKS like Earnings will quell the Lawsuit in which Oklahoma's settled such Suits for Peanuts.
Any opioid settlement update in the earning call?
y’all don’t believe in the long term ?
CAH also have the medical devices market - not worth to invest whilst bearish?
Hesitate to buy until $42
"Good stock to add. Huge of interest to buy at this levels. Manipulation? Probably yes, but does it matter? Thanks to manipulation i was able to add it to my account at 51. Not bad."
63 PE ratio is to rich. Company aint growing that fast. Buyback will help but meager growth says its still trading too rich. Im a buyer at 30.
Undervalued with a strong dividend...
"Can someone give me a reason why this stock dropped so much the past 2 days. I bought this stock a year ago because I thought it was a good stable investment, Not huge swings. We are in a new area of investing. Good luck to you all."
Dividend ain’t going nowhere …
everyone forgetting the beat and raise last quarter
Cardinal Health is down 6.01% to 54.96
One of the absolute worst healthcare stocks over the past 12 months. CAH has never recovered from last years $20 price drop.
blew away numbers raised guidance yields 4% still wants to sell off
> Best Quarter during pandemic> High quality earnings> Consistent dividend > Short term and Long term strategy are both workingSignificant upside potential$60 by next month is not a stretch.
Would buy more around 43-44. Now hold.
AMZN is going to be Sears in 50-100 years they are spreading themselves way too thin
up up it goes
Has followed the same range for 2 years... wait until it hits mid to high $40’s... collect your divvy and 20% gain. Sell mid to high $50’s
"I wonder if McKesson can find and get a vaccine out, fast enough? Fortunately they’ve got Cardinal’s distribution and logistics!"
Finally that topic is done
"Almost all of their debt is fixed rate and tied to the settlement. They do a ton of sourcing, so inflation (rising rates) should be good for their sourcing power. I think this acts like a basic materials stock over the next year. Strong growth, great safe dividend and tons of value. I like this pick"
CAH is up 4.94% to 68.36
Crazy to sell. Like people are going to stop getting sick. Have you seen the amount of stuff one hospital uses in one day.
"Earnings Report - Cardinal Health reports $1.74 earnings per share (non-GAAP), analysts' consensus estimate was $1.44"
I am not sure if one can totally trust yahoo finance statistics. U have noticed more than few mistakes. This company is showing d/e ratio close to 375 and bv of around 6. Is anyone concerned about these or what am I missing. I like the dividend and company’s cash position with $11+ per share.
Why dropping like that? Any news?
Time to back up the truck. Div and wait a year.
"Not that is was much of an increase, but I think the 1% dividend boost kind of got lost in all the hoopla of the share selloff from the over reaction to the earnings report this week. I'm glad to see the dividend increase and the partial recovery of the share price on Friday."
Can someone tell me why Free Cash Flow has drastically decreased lately? I can't find any information... shouldn't CAH be doing well since its products are in even higher demand right now???
I don't know which of my stocks is worse CAH or BMY? Recently bought both on good earnings!!!
"I'm a ""buy and hold"" type investor; have held this stock in my portfolio since 2004. It has lost 25% of its value, even as Schwab has given in an equity rating of A for quite a few years now. I'm now looking for an alternative stock in the same industry with better growth prospects over the next 5 years. Any ideas?"
Why is this stock going down? Wouldn’t the spread of corona help this?
"I see this headed to the low $30s, been watching this a while. They may have to freeze or cut the dividend due to the opiate lawsuits."
Nice earnings. Back to $50 soon. Sold off for no reason!
Nearly a 4% yield here
Why is this one lagging? Anyone?. I would think their business should be booming? I guess we will have to wait till May 11th to see if this breaks out. I believe this one will be 60 by year end at least.
"The worst news possible. Terrifying. Ghastly... The company reduced its fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings guidance range to $5.90 to $6.05 a share, from earlier guidance of $5.85 to $6.10."

"From today’s WaPo: ‘Just six companies distributed 75 percent of the pills during this period: McKesson Corp., Walgreens, Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen, CVS and Walmart, according to an analysis of the database by The Washington Post. Three companies manufactured 88 percent of the opioids: SpecGx, a subsidiary of Mallinckrodt; Actavis Pharma; and Par Pharmaceutical, a subsidiary of Endo Pharmaceuticals.Purdue Pharma, which the plaintiffs allege sparked the epidemic in the 1990s with its introduction of OxyContin, its version of oxycodone, was ranked fourth among manufacturers with about 3 percent of the market.The volume of the pills handled by the companies skyrocketed as the epidemic surged, increasing about 51 percent from 8.4 billion in 2006 to 12.6 billion in 2012. By contrast, doses of morphine, a well-known treatment for severe pain, averaged slightly more than 500 million a year during the period.’"
"By Kevin StawickiLaw360 (November 3, 2020, 8:18 PM EST) -- Three opioid distributors have agreed to pay up to $21 billion to settle sprawling litigation over their alleged role in fueling the opioid crisis that has destroyed countless Americans' lives, an attorney involved in the negotiations told Law360 on Tuesday.McKesson, along with fellow opioid distributors Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen, will pay $21 billion to resolve litigation over their roles in the nation's opioid crisis. (AP File Photo/Richard Drew)McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corp. have agreed to pay $21 billion after extensive negotiations with attorneys general and the plaintiffs' executive committee, which represents local governments in multidistrict litigation over allegations that the drugmakers contributed to the opioid crisis with reckless sales of painkillers and by downplaying the drugs' addiction risks.Paul J. Hanly Jr. of Simmons Hanly Conroy LLC — one of the co-leads of the plaintiffs' executive committee — told Law360 that the parties are pleased to reach the deal.""The AGs, the [plaintiffs' executive committee] and the three companies have been working hard at this for over a year and everyone came together and compromised,"" Hanly said. ""We think it's good for the nation and are very pleased.""Paul Geller of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP, another top lawyer for the MDL plaintiffs, did not directly discuss the amount of the deal, but said in an email that ""lawyers from the [plaintiffs' executive committee], representative state attorneys general, and lawyers for the distributor defendants have been working ardently in an effort to land the plane.""In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, McKesson said the attorneys general proposed that it would pay up to $8 billion over 18 years and the two other companies would pay the remainder over that time.Counsel and representatives for the companies and attorneys general did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. No further details about the settlement were available.The settlement is the latest development after the three distributors tentatively reached an $18 billion deal last year with the attorneys general. It's unclear how far apart the attorneys general and the plaintiffs lawyers are on attorney fees and costs. Some attorneys general and drug companies have said plaintiffs attorneys could reap more than $3 billion in the MDL, which targets several other large companies beyond the distributors.Reaching the deal comes in the wake of broader concerns about the massive fee demands from plaintiffs attorneys, which two state attorneys general said in late October was one of the reasons for the failure to reach a final settlement with major drug companies amid a wave of opioid cases.Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a lead negotiator in efforts to resolve thousands of opioid crisis lawsuits, was the first attorney general to deliver the bare-knuckle assertion. He slammed the attorneys during a speech in Dauphin County — home to the Keystone State's capital city of Harrisburg — about the delayed settlement talks.""If the private attorneys involved in these negotiations were a bit less worried about the amount of money going into their own pockets, and more worried about the unnecessary lives being lost in Pennsylvania and the other states across our country, I'd be able to stand here in Dauphin County today and talk about the resources that we were bringing back for treatment,"" Shapiro said.Hanly, Geller and other top lawyers for local government plaintiffs in the opioid MDL pushed back at the assertion and suggested the attorney general was claiming credit for settlement offers that only exist because of work done by MDL lawyers. Geller likened Shapiro to Rosie Ruiz, who infamously snuck into the homestretch of the Boston Marathon in 1980 and claimed to have won the race.""The AG's actions remind me of Rosie Ruiz,"" Geller said in October of Shapiro's claims. ""She jumped in near the end … and hurried to 'win' a race that others actually ran for the long and grueling entire 26 miles.""The MDL contains roughly 3,000 cases filed mostly by cities and counties that want money for health care and law enforcement costs related to opioid abuse. Some MDL attorneys also represent cities and counties with similar cases in state courts. The attorneys general of virtually every state have also filed cases in state courts, sometimes with the assistance of lawyers in private practice.The MDL is In re: National Prescription Opiate Litigation, case number 1:17-md-02804, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio."
"If the opioid settlement is similar to what was reported this afternoon, we should see a significant pop in CAH share price tomorrow. With over 8% of shares traded short, it might get a bit nutty on the upside. Best of luck CAH longs!"
"Looking at how much CAH is down in 52 weeks. Will do research but seems at some point, if fundamentals are good, this stock becomes a bargain."
So the drop today is all from yesterday's miss?

Last day for dividend!
No doubt some analyst is going to downgrade the stock on the good earnings saying that the future is uncertain.
I think this is one of the great buys in healthcare. .14 enterprise value to revenue is ridiculous. While this is not a growth story revenues are increasing a bit each year. Revenues are up 20% over the last 8 quarters. Too much company here to have a mere $15B market cap.

"Cardinal Health declares $0.4908/share quarterly dividend.Payable Oct. 15 for shareholders of record Oct. 1 (ex-div Sept. 30)With today's drop in share price, that means the yield is around 3.7%"
Been waiting 3 months for CAH to truly take off. The way I see it. It's PE and to the market position it's in as well as dividend makes it worth about 70+. Welp guess I enjoy the dividend till the next earnings blows it out of the water. Last quarter we had less elective procedures and with opening of many clinics this quarter and all the massive loads of PPE they are selling this stock is a hidden gem

one word... Amazon..
sold last year when lawsuits for liability issues started to drag it down and the response was not to my satisfaction
"The 20% drop in value is an incredible opportunity to buy this otherwise rock-solid stock. Yes, they published risk report on profit margin in generics, look at the big picture, there is a risk in ""profit"". The stock is just as good as it was before. The big fish analysts won't make 100% overnight, so they all sold out. The current price of 54 is an incredible buy for this great company which has never been any serious trouble and has a bright and secure outlook. Look for this stock to cross 90 by mid-2019 (and additional 20% beyond mid 2020)."
Well.....I bought CAH and WBA today...........S-krew AMZN.

Morningstar just reduced Cardinal Health's fair value to $55 from $86 and reduced their moat from wide to narrow. They made similar moves for ABC and MCK as well.

can anyone explain why CAH trades at such a discount relative to ABC and MCK from a multiple standpoint while paying a much larger dividend and ABC doesn't have a medical consumable segment? what am i missing?
TM you must be short ! I admit not much of a mover but a solid dividend payer for years!
CAH has been in neutral mode but a down word motion with NO news . A lot of insider stuff is going on without our knowledge. When they share the news we will pop big . Hold on .
"DUBLIN, Ohio, Aug. 11, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH) announced today that it has extended its agreements with CVS Health to distribute pharmaceuticals to retail pharmacies and distribution centers through June 30, 2027."
Typical overreaction by investors who don't know the business. I'll keep my shares thank you!
Still holdingBought near the bottom on several occasions Holding long term as I think this could pop over time while delivering a solid dividend

"I'm considering initiating a position in CAH sometime over the next couple days, assuming it stays in the lower $50 range.

Thank you!"

"AMZN is ruining so many businesses and stockholders. I'm certain the majority of stockholders who own other retail, insurance stocks which see big declines ever time AMZN makes an announcement also are part of the AMZN prime members or are addicted to getting an AMZN box delivered to there door step. No one who has seen there other stock holdings get battered for amazon related news should not ever complain if they or there family use AMZN."
What a beautiful stock
Can't keep a good company down. Headed back to the $80's!
Placed Buy order at $50. Not sure this falling knife will get that far down. Anyway this is a solid company. I've enjoyed trading it (& gives a good dividend)
Back in today.
"Excellent Earnings, Beat Earning Target by $0.20 after raised earnings significantly since last quarter; Minor revenue reduction is expected because of shelter in place in Q2, fewer people goes to doctor unless emergency and in hospital care. Guidance was in line. Look at Tenet Health $THC with exact same situation. The price of $THC was beaten down -6% after earning beat revenue missed, but the next day stock price jumped 10%. I would say pure manipulation of stock price in the health sector. Those who sold today will be very sorry and very envious of those who bought at the dip."
