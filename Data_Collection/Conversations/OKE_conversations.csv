Cant go wrong with OKE !
The hope for keeping my 1k shares that were optioned are dimming by the hour. It's OK as I will still have 2K shares that I will keep.
"OKE isn't mention in this article, but it's industry-related analysis. Bottom line: the analyst says we're at the bottom of the cycle for oil and gas now and from second half 2020 things should get better.10 US Oil Stocks To Buy At Cyclical Lowshttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-us-oil-stocks-buy-182555040.html"
So much for an ex div runup!
"Return on investment. I have 3000 shares. I assume I will hold this for at least two years. That it will be to pre-covid levels around 81. I think it will be higher in two years but to be conservative. I bought at an average of about 27 with 3000 shares. Dividends after 2 years assuming it stays the same will be 3000 shares times 0.935. For $22,440 in dividends. When it gets back to 81, my 3000 shares will be worth $243,000. If I reinvest my dividends over those two years....asumming. Gradual rise... will buy some in 30s and all the way into 70s. Say an average of about 50 price at buy more shares. That is another 448 shares. If I cash out at 81, my 3448 shares would fetch around $280,000 from my initial investment of $81,000. I think I am being conservative. I think oil and gas prices will recover over the next couple of years. With all the capital improvements oke has put into place they will really capitalize. My conservative estimate."
"Wow, I guess there's a chance the 54 8/27 calls I sold might get exercised by Friday. Didn't seem possible a few days ago."
Loosing steam heading to Par for the day..
Would like four or five more days like today. Or six.
For a non oil pipeline company it sure does follow what the oil price is doing
The gift that keeps on giving! Love OKE going into the cold weather months. Should see $70 by year end. One of my better no brainer investments.....lol
wow.. way over sold according to metrics.. and still has not stopped..
"On Monday Conrad's Utility Investor removed OKE from the endangered dividend list . They like free cash flow is 1.3 times the dividend and the company has reasonable plan to deleverage without cutting. Still not a stock for conservative investors because volumes need to be at or above current levels and I insert my own opinion that like so many in the oil and gas business, oil prices need to stay around $40 a barrel."
Great time to buy….beautiful stock!
Where can I find how much OKE is hedged at for current NGL contracts? Or for any oil&gas company for that matter?
Bad news are coming for OKE regarding oil pipelines' environment problems. Now . it may be good time to sell.
love it electric are cars powered buy coal nat gas .
"Antero (AR) Q2 Revs 1.31B Income -523m and the stock did not budge! No divvy. Can't wait for the OKE earnings call. And the heat is killer around the country. Not enough windmills in TX (the DQ State (Don Quixote)) that are broke half the time, expensive to repair and not operating at all during the winter freeze."
ATTENTION lol oke doesnt deal in oil for the 100th time. ignorance is bliss but not when its my money...that being said a yahoo forum has never in history moved the price of anything lol...enjoy your day
"Ugly, but price share at 50.x gives OKE a 7.5ish% dividend. That's pretty good. OKE is in good shape, the dividend seems safe to me. I have so much of it now, I hate getting more, but maybe some Calls. Or Calls when it starts moving back up."
Should I be excitedly happy that OKE is skyrocketing or nervous about my Natural Gas Bills in the future?
"All,First off, I think this is great message group with very knowledgeable posters!As a new investor, I did some reading of the posts on this board and learned quite a lot.So, here is my understanding -1) There are 2 different pipelines - one for oil and a different one for gas.2) OKE s only concerned about the gas pipeline and has nothing to do with the oil pipeline.3) Oil pipeline has been ordered by a judge to close down due to some environmental irregularities/leaks.4) So OKE's business should not get affected by this closing.5) But, according to some, because the oil pipeline is closed, the oil extraction may reduce and hence the gas production (byproduct of oil exploration) and hence may affect OKE's business6) Uncertainty over whether OKE might reduce the dividend.7) Uncertainty over OKE might reduce future quarters' earnings.The stock price has been unfairly punished either by the lack of knowledge (i.e. difference between oil vs gas pipeline), or uncertainty over real business slowdown.Now my take is that, the pipeline issues have been completely misunderstood by the market. Having said that, I do believe that there will be some impact on OKE's business due to the reduce oil excavation and hence reduced gas production. I believe that this will have impact on OKE reducing the dividends, but only a fraction. But,, I also believe that all these negative factors are already 'baked in the cake'. So ANY positive surprise, such as retaining of the entire dividend or even a very small reduction and assurance that the last Q and the upcoming Q's business is relatively on track (again with may be a fractional downward adjustment), will propel this stock upwards of $32 immediately and on the way to $35-38 by the year end.Please comment on my assumptions and my conclusions.Thank you."
You should understand is OKE's assets and infrastructure are IRREPLACEABLE. It CANNOT be replicated. OKE's assets could not likely be built today. The value of its assets is multiple times greater than the current price of OKE stock.
"Fat dividend, price appreciation - wish all my stocks performed like OKE."
explain why the continuing drop for OKE
Again.. has anyone received div deposit today ? I don't see one..
"Nearly 1MM less shares traded than the average each of the past 3 days, but yet price down nearly $3. Something smells funny about that. Does anyone have any thoughts on why? Just seems odd!"
No stock can trade at 52 week highs... day in... and day out...OKE is holding up rather well...Its NGL business will shine in Q2
I believe the future looks bright for OKE with the electric cars on the way and power plants ran off of NG so I am all in on OKE and CCIV the future.
In at $49.90.
I can't seem to locate anything for the ex date. anything yet?
"-RBC Boosts Price Target on ONEOK to $56 From $54, Reiterates Sector Perform Rating"
High demand in LNG for Europe and for US summer electricity no Coal backup. Estimates near $10 with limited drilling with COVID variant and expected cold winter. win win win..
Thus stock needs to get over the 57.00 hump and it will go to 70+.
"Was “stuck” with about 4000 shares last March when it fell thru the floor. I had been a long time investor with OKE and was comfortable with all aspects of the company. With cash on hand, I bought at the mid twenties and on down to my last shares at $17+ change.............I then lost my nerve in late April as I had been buying all the way down. Happily I wound up with 38K shares that pay me $35,530 every quarter! And yes it is by far my largest holding and will remain so. The business is structured like a cash cow and with the transport of fuel products being its primary business it should remain viable for many years. I bought when I was fearful!! Only wish I had bigger ones there at the low point!"
Time to backup the truck and buy some more…
"Haven’t posted in a while as I’ve been enjoying family time and liquidating a business. Just wanted to stop by and congratulate those who are still here from last April. Oke truly is the gift that keeps giving, the whole year round. You guys stay safe."
Happy New Year to all. Congratulations to all who bought this stock in the 20’s or even 30 !! Enjoy the dividend’s in 2021
We are back to 2010 price levels with a completely larger footprint and environment which is not financila in nature.This company is 76% hedged on Nat gas and 2/3rd in liquids at much higher than current commodity levels in 2020 and 19% on gas in 21 and has 0 borrowed against a 2.5 BILLION credit facilityBK is not an issueEmotion to sell out here of fear is the only issue but the long term will be rewarded
Its no mid-twenties from a year ago but still trading at 2016 prices
"Man I am super tempted to just sell off completely 1 of my investments and pour the cash into OKE creating a $707 dividend payout every 3 months....Over $1040 combined with my other dividend investments.But, I must resist the urge I think because I would no longer have a 5 stock diversified portfolio."
Beautiful level to buy here!
"So if you think about it logically one must ask, other than the obvious cut in earnings and revenue from covid, what happened to the business model from last winter when the stock was in the 70s to now? Why doesn't the market give this company the earnings potential it had in its highs last January when the economy gets back to where it was . Can investors have changed their minds so abruptly about the potential of OKE when they came in to the year with double digit growth?"
"From an article on Yahoo news, the price of natural gas jumped today. Since OKE does not appear to have significant exposure to the oil transport business, this increase in the price of gas would suggest that OKE's midstream business is not going to be significantly impacted by the reduced price of oil."
so is their earnings per share for the quarter less than the quarterly dividend? is that a concern?
"I sold my oneok shares on DeGiro on 4th of august in order to make a trade, however now I dont see the reservation for 'payable dividend' anymore... Anyone has a similar experience with this on DeGiro? It's past ex-dividend date unless I'm grossly mistaken?"
There is one other point on OKE pre pandemic vs now...For all that has changed the biggest one is that OKE was on a divi increase tear and it was assumed that the divi would increase by about 20 cents in 2020...We know that did not happen...And its only with that it will start to increase again in 2022... and at what rate is an even bigger mystery...That may be the catalyst that is necessary for OKE to have the equity gains/value everyone wants
Very solid company. OKE is going way higher once the panic subsides. $70-$80 stock IMO.
"As a former banker, I have listened to many earnings calls. OKE's management team is doing a good job of minimizing how bad the second quarter results were and emphasizing how much July's results are improving."
Just got into this recently off of someone's recommendation elsewhere. Love the company and this diversifies my portfolio nicely. Going to start adding to my position regularly here. This company has been around for 100+ years and has developed a nice business in Natural Gas. Natural Gas quickly replacing coal power and is the best answer to Global Warming.
I love owning OKE stock. My average cost for shares bought last year is about $29. Received a nice dividend last year and another is coming soon. And I believe the best is yet to come!
"Does anyone else finds absurdity in latest Zacks article on OKE. Like if they surpass estimates OKE will go up, if not it will go down. There is also direction of estimate revision which also has no meaning but it there. We also have some metric that we don't even understand and has no meaning, negative estimate doesn't mean miss but we gave it to OKE since we can't accurately estimate if OKE will surpass due to combination of indicators. All in all, we have many numbers but none of the help you and price will either go up or down, thank you for reading latest Zacks 3 page review on OKE :D"

"Thats why he's called ""see nile"" Joe"
Expecting a close today closer to $52 than $51 and then a nice pop upwards.
"Based on the timing last year the dividend decision will be announced next Wednesday, and would expect it to remain the same as first quarter. They have done quite a bit to build some extra reserves and help underpin the EBITDA targets. Their credit rating is very important, and so far so good. Great management team, and they have done several presentations this year and highlighted their financial position that supports the dividend payout which seems to be very important to them."
"About time we see some major action. I have to ask myself is this solely due to winter demand, Shortage or is there some good news coming out? Any ideas?"
"When is going under $50 I will add more. Nice company, nothing has changed, excelent dividend."
keep adding shares on pullbacks working like a lucky charm hell ya brother!
"Another low volume day and another +$1 loss, I just can’t seem to make sense of this. I am anxious for next week to see if the bleeding stops and it makes up a portion if not all the loss."
"I think OKE is going to blow right past 4th qtr earning expectations, and with the vaccines slowly bringing recovery so people can get back to work is going to add strong support to the double digit growth they projected for 2021 on their last webcast. Manufacturing data already shows that sector beginning to recover nicely, and more factories getting back on line need more energy..............."
"The daily market value of any stock each and every day is made up of only two things. Its intrinsic value (assets - liabilities = shareholder equity) AND the perception of value by shareholders and prospective shareholders. Those of us who buy and hold have no impact on daily value other than, by not selling, we stabilize price. Institutional investors and speculators are constantly looking for quick profits. If you are a long term investor, you hold for only two reasons. You are either hoping the price ultimately raises over time (don't we all) or you own a company because they pay a reasonable dividend. When I bought OKE @ $19 it was for both of those reasons."
11% year over year q4 increase...during a pandemic...and fossil fuels getting no love...impressive
The earnings were great even with the pandemic. This is be sleep good at night dividend paying and growth stock I’ve always dreamt of. Not taking you to the moon on a rocket but certainly will take you there at a prudent pace. Just the kind of company I like! Very nice
OKE needs to bust through $54.25 and hold it.
How can they dump a stock that just went ex dividend and pays 7.45%?
"Because I've re-invested the dividend my portfolio is a bit overweight on OKE. I wanted to get some covered calls at 57.50, but hesitated and now its dropped $3. Now I'm thinking of buying some calls instead. The odds of it popping back to 56 or 57 seem pretty good."
Where else can you make 7% on your $$$. Great safe place to park money.
"Can't sell won't sell! This divi is the real deal! I'm a swing trader so nothing i own i keep long, with, however the exception of OKE. I receive $1,000 in stock every 3 months through DRIP. Natural gas isn't going anywhere!"
"Now the 55s are gone, where will it end?"
"There was nothing.... "" shinny... shinny... shinny...."" in that report...And the sector has been a laggard since early July...There will be buying opportunities ahead... as the Dems will be milking the Covid cow for all its worth...."
Got to 1000 shares today! goal is 1070 for $1000 payment every 3 months! nothing like giving yourself a $4000 raise.. man i love this stock and company.
"52 week high is within reach, let's do this!"
Bought a small position here yesterday. How can you beat that dividend during inflation and future gas spike?

"can someone explain to me why people continue to associate oke with crude oil and oil transportation. they are primarily a natural gas gatherer refiner and distributor. natural gas although associated with crude oil is a diffrent product completely and natural gas pockets exist without the direct extraction of crude oil. methane ""natural gas"" is used primarily to generate electricity by utilities and secondarily to cook and heat water and air through natural gas services to homes....natural gas is their main source of income and is a seperate commodity to crude oil....please correct me."
"Recent analyst report states equal.weoght rating based on OKE's share price already pricing in the growth in Natural Gas pipelines and etc. But, OKE traded historically into the upper 70s prior to all of the recent expansions.You can make an arguement I suppose that $77+ was too high an evaluation, but then I would counter with the fact that $67 is a big leap from $57 and how is $67 too high?Also, in same report is that OKE's credit rating and dividend payout is now considered stable and no longer pressured.This report comes from Morgan Stanley."
Why do you think it’s going to be under 50?
"Bought into this at $27 and change, 500 shares. Very happy except I bought it in my regular trading account. Should have been my 401. Thinking of picking up a couple hundred more there. Not sure since I own 1000 SBOW. That has been a runner. By no means knowledgeable in these types of stocks."
4th quarter earnings should be interesting. October movement of NG stronger than last. Have to see if flow out of the Williston Basin can continue to climb as flared wells are hooked up. Not much drilling in the Williston so companies commentary on future drilling will be key.New pipelines out of the Permian coming on line. Wonder if some of that will take a little flow from OKE's pipes. Should be low but might take some time to work through.OKE has plenty of room to grow flow after previous years expansions. Just a matter of time as to how quickly that will be filled.Curbie2
It’s going to be in the over 100’s here in Ok with heat factor this week. Go OKE!
Guess everybody stopped using natural gas today

I believe this will be going back to at least 70 this year. There new pipeline projects will all be coming online and you will see a big improvement on earnings growth.
Why the sudden down turn ? Any news ?
Hopefully priming for a late day run to 57!
Does anyone know the ex-dividend date??
"This is such a gem. 11% yield. Today's big news > today Oneok announced its inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World) and Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index (DJSI North America). Additionally, ONEOK was named the DJSI Industry Leader for Oil and Gas Storage and Transportation.This marks ONEOK's first inclusion in the DJSI World Index, where it is currently the only North American energy company included in the group of global sustainability leaders. The company was also included in the DJSI North America Index for the second consecutive year."
With LNG up we should be at $70/share.
So I guess the drop in oil will alay fears of hyper inflation which is a good thing...except not today. Totally oversold!

"They have to pay 1.66B$ every year for dividends. With new emitted shares it costs more of course.They have 550M$ in cash right now, 440M$ this quarter may be safe if you consider the earnings of 330M$ from last quarter to continue the same so they can go negative another 5 quarters before cutting it by 25% just to stay at 100% payout ratio. Assuming the prices for commodities go up we can be safe for longer duration.Of course if they cut the dividend it will drop like hell. May touch 25-30$ again."
"Other gas and oil plays have been hitting their 52 week highs lately. OKE is better than all of them. Just a matter of time before we see 65-70. With the awesome divi, OKE is the place to be."
I just gave myself an early Christmas present and bought more OKE!
OKE trading significantly higher as it turns out that Natural Gas is the key ingrediant for the miracle immortality drug.... Ok I jest. OKE higher because inflation I gather.
seems like a bargain or maybe investors have decided it is not worth as much as they once thought. I vote bargain

Pipeline stocks taking a hit this morning.Anyone have an ideal why?
got in with one thou.shares today looks like a good stock and a nice divi.
Terry Spencer CEO came out today with a long statement of extreme confidence as fas as earnings and dividend coverage being healthy. Said 2020 capital growth expenditures in the range of $1.6-2.4 bil a decrease of $500 mil . But basically saying all is well and they are well heeled and financially strong.
Whats up with this stock it should be on a slow climb to 75 not going the other way?
"I have been watching this company for a couple of years and fortunate to add heavily to an initial position through last year. Great counter balance to other positions with much higher beta. Good management, good div cover (1.59 and poised to improve with continued debt management), high additional revenue potential (more derived from partially completed projects to come on line requiring low additional capex), high liquidity, strong demand for foreseeable future, well positioned for administration’s future outlook on energy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,oh and the divi is nice. Slow and steady though I am ecstatic seeing a double within a year. By the relative sanity of the board it’s evident that most have been in the market for some time, have other holdings and are not pumping to the moon desperate for profit. Contrary points of view are considered as opposed to instantly offended as if their wife or child was called ugly. Addressing weakness and pitfalls are important when formulating and executing a plan from DD and others’ educated opinions.Happy to see a positive ER to solidify my stance and continue to add. Cannot see selling this in the med (3-5yrs) term however the case is being made to perhaps hold much longer as market gains settle and more “normal” trading is seen."
Looks like start of a major run up ahead of the Winter cold season. Mid-Fall can be very cold sometimes too.
Looks to be in line with firmed up expectations for the second half. But still within previously announced guidance range.
"Can someone explain why Zacks seem to bash OKE on the regular? This is a great company with 100+ years experience, best believe OKE has navigated through turbulent waters in the past. I feel confident given their track history this company is a value buy. I own over a 1,000 shares, largely of which were purchased in March and April. I plan on holding these shares for a very long time to come."
"Unfortunately OKE's great numbers won't mean a thing if the evil blueish team locks down the country again. Isn't sad that I can't even say the word, otherwise the communists scrub my post. The whisper is that shutdowns will be back by mid August. And that of course will crash the markets again. If the Dow drops 5-10,000 points. It won't matter how great OKE's numbers and fundamentals are. It will crash with everything else. Thanks you moronic, gullible suckers who voted for the Alzheimer's patient."
Can I get this form45?
"One thing for sure the adage that Oke trades with crude is bs, crude is up $1.42"
"WOW, what a turnaround! Wish I'd picked up 1k at open but too scared with all the COVID and dropping oil."
happy to reinvest my divined money with discounted shares!!!
The last dividend announcement was 4/15. That should have put this ex div at around 7/15. What the hell is going on?
OKE is worth $57 easy. Buyers are getting a deal in the $52 range.
Encouraging call I thought. You have very conservative (and smart) management saying they are well positioned and have been through many cycles before. Dividend looks very safe and their low end ranges are coming from running worse case scenarios that aren’t likely. I’ll be buying more on the dips.
What’s with the options trading today?? Someone knew it was going to tank ? Or was it common sense due to COVID again? I don’t know - but I got the alert for unusual options trading today. Anyone else know ??
Up here in Canada we are really busy with Oneok. Been working on that project for the last 6 months. I’m a pipe fitter and we build complete packages. So it’s still going on with other trades. Also we have a lot just sitting in our shop on hold for the new year I assume. First I heard of the company and has crazy dividend. Is this a good company to buy?
Have some money available because this is the 10% correction
For 45?
OKE recently updated their Form 8937 which shows current estimate of 70% of annual divs as ROC. The annual ROC estimate has dropped a bit each quarter but still a decent tax savings (or delay if you plan to sell at some point) when you hold in a taxable account.
Order set for $48.00
"This is one of my strongest holding, and even though it was averaging up, I add to my position under $50. If the sector falls more, and this follows, I will add more."

Pound the table!
"Oils up , OKE is up , interesting"
I hope everyone took advantage of the head fake yesterday and picked up some more OKE below $50.
Here we go
Bought some yesterday.. my perfect timing as always :p
"the reason it makes sense to compare it to its lowest level last year is logical for 2 reasons. 1. you saw an unchanged profitable company fall in share price but maintained its dividend therefore buying in at that moment gives you a 16% plus yield and possible 175% return if things go back to normal, insanely good buy all around. 2. even if you were a shareholder previous to last year, the lockdown gave you the opportunity to increase your shares by 175 200% lower value therefore allowing you to accumulate div shares at an insane discount and at the same time lowering your average per share price and why wouldnt you buy down a profitable and insanely high div if you were happy owning it 200% higher...nothing changed for this companies business except a passing lockdown.. so comparing it to its black swan low makes sense if you already owned it or got in for the value. its a very rare event when you can pick up a company like this 200 to 300% off depending on what level we get back too but regardless as long as it still gets cold in winter and hot in summer and electricity needs to be made, they are just a money printing machine. its not sexy but if you didnt sieze that opportunity then idk. its as relevant as getting a tesla for half off... if i got anything half off i would say thats relevant when the reason we are here is to buy low sell high and collect free cash along the way."
Natrual Gas price is going up so will be green end of week
it's all about the dividend folks!!! talk to me in 5 years and tell me I'm wrong I dare you!!!
"There is no logical explanation for the recent selling. I expect it was triggered by the big option expiration on Friday and continues with panic selling this week. Oneok just released an update to their August Investor Newsletter. https://ir.oneok.com/~/media/Files/O/OneOK-IR-V2/financial-reports/2020/08-26-20-investor-update.pdf If you read the fine print on the Regional Volume Update page it states: Rockey Mountain NGL up 50%, Mid-Contenent up 15%, Rocky Mountain gas up 35% in July vs May. If you apply these gains to the first quarter volumes, you will see that things are already returning to normal volumes. Investors will do very well in November. Have patients and buy at these levels."
"Oke vs KMI stock priceKMI was at 22 precovid. It’s at 14.89 now. About 2/3 of precovid valueSo how undervalued is oke. Oke was at 78 precovid. Using 2/3 precovid number on oke, oke should be at 51 minimum. Oke pays much more in dividends and seems to be a better managed company."
"ONEOK declares a dividend of $0.935 today. Payable Nov. 13, 2020, to shareholders of record at the close of business Nov. 2, 2020. That is fantastic!"
"So based on last earnings outlook the expectation was that their overall run rates were approaching pre Covid levels. My guess is they will exceed EPS projected for 3rd quarter, and outlook from here on out is good regardless of who wins in Nov based on just new capex completions coming online."
"Sammie is a paid spammer and really broke.

In my opinion, always have back up cash to add when stocks crash like in March 8-10 2020.With variant, may happen again (I wish) or with the Jay Leno saying modified, ""Spend all you want, we'll print more!"""
This will not stay down with a 6.5% dividend looming!
"The earnings report reflects that this company's earnings are going to steadily rise even if conservatively which is what you want from a solid dividend payer. You want consistent steady earnings growing behind a solid management team.While I do not expect explosive share price increases like tech stocks produce, I am happy to keep buying more shares and collecting more dividends here. Share will steadily rise up with earnings, but probably not be explosive (which is ok)."
A small beat. $0.77 per diluted share
"Need this to get to the mid 50’s. Kind of stalled here. Great dividend, low debt, decent earnings, great company. Eventually a mid 60’s stock. I’m long"
I had been wanting to buy shares in this company for a long time and purchasing shares in the low twenties was great. I am in for the long haul and look forward to collecting great dividends while I wait.
What do you all make of the crazy spike to 53.95 at the open? Have 1000 trading shares I wish of would have sold but missed it.
Question: Does OKE issue a K-1?
"If this is true, I think it makes Oke even more more future proof. https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/30/renewable-hydrogen-can-travel-through-existing-pipelines-ceo-says-.html"
this bear has come out of hibernation
"Wow, lose the 57s and 56s in 2 days!"
"Wrote 9 oct 15 57.50 calls for .55 this morning. Already sold and expired the 55s for .90 and received a dividend. If the 900 get called it will be a profit of 842 for dividend, 488 for current option, 810 for prior option, and since I paid 53.41 - 3681 cap gain, for a total of 6663! A gain of 13.8% in 2.5 months. That's how you do it baby."
Strong company. It clearly has its risks but barring a second lockdown this should be a great long term bet.
Just imagine when natural gas futures price rises. Back in November 2019 the commodity was roughly 60% higher than today's price. Plus people will need heat in the winter via propane and our industrial economy opening up more everyday will use more ethylene for plastics and rubber. I'll take my dividend until things are back to normal. This is easy. Based on my dca I'm getting a 25% dividend. Seems unreal lol but I bought at $13 and again @ $17. I just bought again at $35 via dividend drip. I'll hold this stock for 10 years and reinvest all dividends. I'll double my investment in 4 years just off the dividend yield. I'm already up 150%. I should buy a tee shirt with OKE on it lol... Love em. I bought during the biggest oil price drop in 100 years or something... That day was glorious.
"Added another 5k at $26.20 to bring total shares to 54.5k between accounts. In a year I’ll be eating biscuits with truffle jam or ramen noodles. It may go lower short term, but these prices are unbelievable."
"Today there is a clear sector rotation out of tech growth into value, including energy."
"Well, for the life of me I can't understand why Yahoo won't let me post anything on here that I paste, but UBS has upgraded OKE from Neutral to Buy. $35 price target. Basically cites improving volumes and decreasing risk to dividend. Google it and you'll find it."
Who would sell this stock off before it gets to 75 a share it’s about dividends and growth and patience.
"--Credit Suisse Raises ONEOK's PT to $56 from $54, Says Volume Trends Drive Stronger Cash Flow Outlook; Keeps Neutral Rating"
I love how this stock gets beats to shreds as though it is an E&P company when the sector is down but only increases like a PL company (small to modest gains) when the sector is soaring.
OPEC to add 400K barrels a month for the coming year. Oil going down in price. Stocks to go lower. It's that simple. Not going to guess the bottom.
Get a dividend....lose a dividend+!
picked up 40 more under 49..... I'm happy
I think we're going to have revenue beat on top and bottom line.
"Natural gas prices are up 50% since last earnings. oke gathers, sells , and transports it. I hate to be captain obvious but using 3rd grade level logic here im going to go out on a limb and say oke beats earnings next two quarters. ground breaking analyzation skills i know. sometimes its just that simple."
Just 50 cents from a 52 week high!
Another dividend coming around the corner! I love owning OKE stock! Thank you OKE!
The Jan 22 60 strike calls are bidding 1.40/share. Would you take 61.40 for your shares plus a div or two?
I'm in at 40.59$/share. I realize that many on this board are long term holders and would like constructive opinions on my entry price for OKE. Thanks
$60 has been elusive; still plodding along on its march.
"Sammie, maybe this will help you:https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SMLP/community?p=SMLP&.tsrc=fin-srchGo cry with you buds today. (-1.79%%)"
Accumulated our position in OKE between 1980 and 1993 and added some last time it hit the low 40s. It has never been in a better position to weather downturns and has weathered several big ones even before completing over 98% of contract restructuring. Would increase position if not well into retirement but certainly not selling!
This is what is called a trading trifecta. Natural gas futures is up %1.40 - a 93.5 cents dividend should be declared early this week - and a chance to buy OKE in the 40s.
Ha!!https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/california-to-build-temporary-gas-plants-to-avoid-blackouts-1.1642188
Spot price for natural gas $3.10 this morning. Price was $2.65 just a couple months ago. OKE will make bank this quarter.
"The media and the democraps preach ""delta variant"" fears and the market goes done. Meanwhile, OPEC+ sees improving economies as ""plandemic"" fades and increasing production.OPEC+ would not increase production is they really thought the ""delta variant"" was going to tank the demand."
I think funds are just dumping oil stocks and OKE is part of the group.
picked up another 200 today. screw it it's all about the dividend
this stock market is so manipulated and most of the analysts are crooks.I'll be homework that I've done on Oke tells me it's a good stock I'm holding on.fre invest your dividends you going to get a good deal in a few days.
Is this dividend safe? Asking for a friend…
bert owes me big time...
"Its just this stock need little hype ,once it done will be boom"
"what's up with the premarket showing down 3 bucks a share, did I miss something??"
"In accordance with the June 1st Investor presentation, OKE does as 25% of its fee based income perform Natiral Gas Processing, which I take to mean refining. Processing is the removal of contaminants from Natural Gas before it is transported. If this isn't refining then ok fine I am wrong but it sure does sound like refining."
Talk about losing all upward momentum! Even with 2 new targets set at 56.
The slow bleed continues!
"ONEOK (OKE) Strong on Growth Efforts & Fee-Based EarningsZacks Equity ResearchMon., September 28, 2020, 11:45 a.m. EDT·3 mins readONEOK, Inc. OKE is well-poised to benefit from ONEOK Partners buyout, increased fee-based earnings and midstream assets located in higher productive regions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2020 earnings is pegged at $1.23 per share and for revenues stands at $9.07 billion.What’s Aiding the Stock?ONEOK is well-placed to gain from long-term fee-based commitments in its Natural Gas Gathering and Processing, and Natural Gas Liquids segments. The company anticipates 90% of its current-year earnings to be fee-based.It continues to invest in organic growth projects for expansion in the existing operating regions and providing a broad range of services to crude oil and natural gas producers as well as the end-use markets. Amid the unprecedented economic crisis due to the pandemic, the company took initiatives to preserve liquidity.Moreover, ONEOK Partners is the primary growth vehicle of ONEOK and the completion of this buyout is likely to be accretive to its distributable cash flow from 2017 through 2021. Further, the company’s strong cash flow generation capacity is helping it strengthen its balance sheet and add shareholder value."
3 pieces of good news afterhours1) dividends announce and they are not cut2) KMI earnings beat high estimate and they raise dividends by 5%3) Dow up 165 afterhours.
"its true oil and gas are both energy commodities and follow similar trends when everything is normal. But as we move away from oil which seems like a goal for alot of people, you will see a divergence in correlation since using less oil means using a vast ampunt more of natural gas to spin those electric turbines. The attempt or success of phasing out oil is a positive for oke and so was the fracking ban since we already own our deposits. the fracking ban just gave oke less competition for the future. enjoy divi day everyone"
OKE will be back. Im not worried but why is oil down? Just because or travel stocks ?
"I got my wish for a higher volume day I was complaining about...yikes! Lesson learned be careful for what you wish for, it may come true. Hopefully this is the bottom and we will start going back up from here"
"Looks like OKE is going to end the year on a positive note with good momentum underway. There could likely be a bit of a pullback, but that would be ok. With the change in the administration more negative fallout will come for the producers, but at some point folks will begin to figure out that Oneok is a fee based service not encumbered by commodity price swings since they derive little revenue from that stream. Since the corp tax rate will likely go from 21% to 28%, we might see some possible outcomes: Oneok keeps their capex plan unchanged for 2021 but increases the dividend given they will avoid more tax, they expand their capex to keep adding growth and keep dividend even more viable, or they minimize capex to divert what they expect to be double digit growth next year to repayment of debt. For me the Oneok story should be a good one for 2021 and beyond,"
Believe we should see the div announcement today (based on previous years/qtrs).
"Hey all:Since OKE distributions are return of capital, is it more tax efficient in the long run to own this is a tax protected account or taxable account? Can my cost basis ever be reduced to zero if I hold long enough? How are distributions classified if my cost basis reaches zero? Thx"
ISS - EVA upgrades ONEOK ORD SHS from UNDERWEIGHT to HOLD.
Stock is flat a day before it goes ex on an up day for the market when all the oil and gas stocks are up 2-4%. Why do I have a feeling the 95 cents divvy is not going to be worth it come tomorrow.
"Well only 1 of my 10 54 call options got assigned Friday, so I only had to sell 100 shares. I'll take that, still hold 2900. Go OKE!"
One step forward and two back!
Its worth remembering that the new assets that OKE brought on line in late 2019 and in Q1 2020 are thought to be productive enough to increase Revenues and EBITDA ABOVE 2019 levels...Those levels had OKE at near $80... we are at $40...As activity increases... and we have 7 months remaining in 2020... there is no reason why OKE should not put up record Revenue and EBITDA for the whole of 2020...Its very realistic to conclude that a year from now... OKE could easily be back at those all time highs or higher still...
"I love OKE stock. Bought a fair amount of shares last year at average price of $28.75/share, this stock has made me a lot of money! Thank you OKE!"
Buy at open
I see the price of Natural Gas going up. Its above 4 bucks. Will this help OKE's bottom line ?
"14% on invested capital, I have no reason to ever leave."
New 52 week high! Let's keep this going next week!
listened to the conference call Moodys Fitch and S&P I believe all rate OKE investment grade. Company is doing great and someone asked about green energy which they responded they will consider investments in it depending on the opportunity presented. They came through the pandemic with flying colors and continuing to operate on all cylinders. IMO they'll be raising the dividend once they continue seeing earnings increasing. What a conservative and shrewd bunch of operators they are.
"Based on the additional shares issued in June: Is the current price $41 above the $48 price before the announcement in June? We are heading into higher demand with new infrastructure, the dividend seems secure, a vaccine on the way, oil & nat gas price rising well above the price in June. What are your thoughts on the next level of resistance?"
All this cold weather means huge demand and a soaring stock price.
Good thing bigpothead and ali sold at $30 
"OKE is a wonderful stock, very good dividend and also a fantastic return. If you know another stock like this, please inform me.Thumbs up OKE."
"The dividend is payable Aug. 16, 2021, to shareholders of record at the close of business Aug. 2, 2021. So it is NOT Fri the 30th???"
Does OKE report earnings before or after market close on th 3rd? Not sure their usual protocol.
I hope those that were warned could have loaded up as I did in the 20's. I have never seen a more obvious mis-pricing of a company which is now being rectifiedEnjoy the growth and dividends!
For 2 quarters in a row earnings at pre-pandemic highs…when it traded at $70+
"We get upgrades it goes down ~ is it covid delta fear - nightmare in Afghanistan, or just a typical August ?"
everytime someone switches from natural gas appliances to electric the natural gas usage increases due to electric generation soooooo no matter what people do we win.
Okay enough of the red days lets go to a new 52 week high......
Bought up a few more shares of OKE ahead of the ex dividend date 30 July.I am long OKE because of the dividend. If OKE continues to march higher then that is like putting yummy frosting on top of the most delicious cake.
July 20 (Reuters) - Wall Street securities analysts revised their ratings and price targetson several U.S.-listed companies on Tuesday. * ONEOK Inc : Credit Suisse raises target price to $54 from $53 * ONEOK Inc : Scotiabank raises target price to $51 from $48
Last of my pipelines to report. KMI and WMB did not react to the upside on earnings. Here's to an OKE beat and price rising.
"Not pumping this but at 100$ oil I do expect this to reach 100$/share, also gas is at its highest. Point is, keep it for at least 2 years."
$60 end of week
Last offering was in January of 2018. Stock went Straight up to 70 between January and august after that offering.
"I thought that this was one of the most important comments from the conference call:""Our higher guidance expectations include the latest producer forecasts and drilling plans, and our earnings range also includes the potential impact from a shutdown of the Dakota access pipeline"".If their forecast includes the potential negative impact from shutting down DAPL, which is a worst-case scenario, then it's hard to see them missing guidance in the near future. If DAPL isn't shut down, then they will have plenty of cushion going forward."
"According to my calculations, at this price I get 12% yearly in dividends. Locked in. I’m getting all I can get. 12% yearly no matter what the stock price does."
Where is the ex-div date announcement. Last quarter it went ex on the 23rd of the month.
ONEOK is up 5.02% to 52.72
Oneok has higher 2ndqr earnings on their website??
I thought we are going to break the 60 barrier this week. Looks like a waiting game now..
I am all in OKE and holding but i am also confusing why it has not touch its high target value by many analysts which is ($33) not a ''single time'' since it came below in early July 2020. but i still believe it will keep floating at this level unless we have outstanding good news in the market. The news could be in terms of stimulus or vaccine or energy demand boost etc. I know its annoying but at least it should move little bit to give investors some sort of consultation.
"Question for arm chair CEO's. Pretend you are CEO of OKE. Should your top priority be to increase share price or maintain the dividend? I know there is a long history here of dividend maintenance, but actually cutting the dividend could over time increase the share price. It would also appease most of the critics who cite the high dividend as why they cannot fully recommend the stock. Not to mention of course cutting has some positive financial benefits to the corporation - debt reduction, debt ratios, ... However getting 13% return has it's benefits as well. Just curious."
remember when you thought to yourself.. why didn't i buy more of this when it was under 50???.... Yeah.. you remember! now GO BUY IT!
Nice trading today. Mostly filled the gap early and steady buying up so far. Was able to flip my 100k margin trade for another 145 shares in my taxable account. You guys wanna post shares held and average cost basis and revisit in 6 months? Might be a fun thing but I don’t want it to turn into contest. If you own 1 share you’re more lucky than most.
The natural gas glut has evaporated. Futures ended on Friday at $3.215 per million BTUs up 96% from last year. This should all bode well for OKE and the dividend.
Sold at $53 this morning and will rebuy under $50.
free money i love it...each share i accumulate is paid for by div in 7 to 10 years...im accumulating free money....in 10 years no matter what share price is its all profit...the only reason its down is because its wrapped into so many dow etfs.
Bought at $53.25
The price of Nat gas has risen from $1.90 in Sept. to $3.00 now after recent rise.
Can someone explain why yesterday the stock closed at $29.20 and today pre market it starts and in my TD account as $28.40? Please.. is it something to do with ex - dividend date?
"This is one of the most undervalued stocks I can find right now even with the new shares factored in. Great value metrics based on their historical averages, great dividend yield. Still 50% off February #s too."
Best guess of why this stock isn’t getting closer to pre COVID numbers ? I understand the delusion of the stock sometime back but that is not 25 a share different.
Where do you find out when the ex dividend date is?
anyone who thinks the dividend wont be paid every quarter for the next 15 years doesnt understand how electricity is made.

"Well managed company, and the toughest quarter is behind them provided something completely unforeseen crops up. They have done a masterful job in building contingencies, and would expect a continued recovery from here on. The one thing that stands out to me is how they value their employees as was well displayed by their president starting the conference call by stressing how they focus on keeping their employees safe. That is a top down attitude that permeates the leadership of the company and includes the way they view investors as part of their stakeholders. This company reminds me of another that has a similar view of employes and shareholders - Nucor."
im up over 100% in a year with a huge dividend. i really dont see how anyone could ask for more...see you in 25 years
Feeling good about the shares I picked up under $49 Thursday! Now we need this train to cross the $60 mark.
"OKE declared div after close today, remains at 0.935. Payable 8/16/21, ex-div 7/30/21."
I want to buy more.. but this is already 39% of my portfolio lol
