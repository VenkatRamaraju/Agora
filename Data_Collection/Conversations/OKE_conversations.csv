"Pre-market stronger today than yesterday. OKE has entered clearly into the Momentum zone. Which means the pricing can get overheated at some point, but it is incredibly challenging and beyond my abilities to fogure out. A share price that climbs a ton in a short time could do so just because it has earned a higher p/e multiple. Or it could just be overheated momentum. But, thankfully, I don't have to time the market with OKE. I can just collect the dividends."
When's the next ex-dividend date?
Can I get this form45?
"Oils up , OKE is up , interesting"
Whats up with this stock it should be on a slow climb to 75 not going the other way?
Sold the 62.50 Oct 15 calls today. Now all my shares are optioned to 10/15. If they get taken I will be a happy camper.
"I've been a ONEOK investor for 30 years through the ups and downs. I'm staying with them. Long-hauler, I guess."
Does OKE report earnings before or after market close on th 3rd? Not sure their usual protocol.
OKE will still yield 6% @ 62 without a dividend increase. I think it will get there.
Good thing bigpothead and ali sold at $30 
OKE. Like AAPL…own it don’t trade it. Beautiful dividend play.
Why do you think it’s going to be under 50?
OKE can move fast... dont be surprised if it trade to that Aug low of $48.51 in this market correction...Thats where Im standing...
the technology to get rid of natural gas electric generation doesnt exist and the push for electric heating and electric vehicles only adds insane amount of demand on the grid...coal is almost phased out so unless people want to build 100 or more nuclear plants i think its safe to say oke will be fine for a very long time...The more they push green the more natural gas will be needed until they invent new battery technology that we are not even close too..also the fracking ban on new leases on federal land only increases our profit because our leases are already in place...basically their is a need for our product that will only increase and theirs nowhere else to get it because of legislation...the push for green is the best thing that could ever happen. the irony is not many people understand how electricity is made and how your electric cars get power...if natural gas output was stopped for 1 week the country what fall apart...unless the country wants to go back to the 1800s we are dependant on natural gas and its good becausd we have loads of it....im so glad people are not educated or i never would have gotten so many dirt cheap shares due to covid and climate change related issues.....lets keep the lights on...
whats up today? usually OKE follows xom which is up today.
dannnnnggggggg up 116 percent over the last year.......boooolya!
"If OKE stock could talk,""Going to $55... wait this is boring.. I think I'll skip it for $56! Hmm... Not very high up, not much to see...not a good view at all. I will go to $57 instead. Ha! I am at $57 now.. But, wait... This looks familiar. I have been here before... I should go to $58...Who am I kidding? $58? Everyone loves $100 and I hear that is where the Upper Class parties all day and night. Yep... Going to $100."""
"They have to pay 1.66B$ every year for dividends. With new emitted shares it costs more of course.They have 550M$ in cash right now, 440M$ this quarter may be safe if you consider the earnings of 330M$ from last quarter to continue the same so they can go negative another 5 quarters before cutting it by 25% just to stay at 100% payout ratio. Assuming the prices for commodities go up we can be safe for longer duration.Of course if they cut the dividend it will drop like hell. May touch 25-30$ again."
OKE needs to bust through $54.25 and hold it.
Love the smell of green all day long!
Feeling good about the shares I picked up under $49 Thursday! Now we need this train to cross the $60 mark.
New 52 week high before the bell? Will it happen... Sure would ring in the new month of October nicely.
So it looks like there is some profit taking here at $60... gonna have to consolidate to move higher again but its good that $60 profit taking is taking place on a day of strong demand
everytime someone switches from natural gas appliances to electric the natural gas usage increases due to electric generation soooooo no matter what people do we win.
Talk about losing all upward momentum! Even with 2 new targets set at 56.
The gift that keeps on giving! Love OKE going into the cold weather months. Should see $70 by year end. One of my better no brainer investments.....lol
Last October I locked in my DTH cost at $2.837. Just got my renewal offer to lock in for another year and OKE wants $4.54!!!!!!!! What a shocker. Has to be done by October 15th. Not sure whether to take the risk or let it run open. OKE already bought a portion of its' winter natural gas supply so that is what they paid. Surprised they paid that much. They do not make money on the sale of NG but only on the volume side. If it is a mild winter then that is too much and was not a good idea to lock in. In the summer it really drops.
"Propane is not a greenhouse gas. It is environmentally friendly, before and after combustion. As an auto fuel gasoline is fed through a jet and set at sea level. The propane system is infinitely and easy to set for the altitude that you will be running in."

"I got in at $18 when the COVID crash happed. It was my first dividend stock and wow has it been a joy to own , but I’m contemplating selling it all. Can someone give me a reference to help me decide on holding or selling?"
ONEOK reached a 52 Week high at 64.58
"Wondering how much natural gas price rise help OKE? Does it participate much when the price rises? If so, it hasn't seen a dramatic gain as Nat gas has gone from under 3 to over 5 bucks. I'm hoping there's a lag here, but not sure of the dynamics of OKE profits."
volume shot up late in the day...
keep adding shares on pullbacks working like a lucky charm hell ya brother!
High demand in LNG for Europe and for US summer electricity no Coal backup. Estimates near $10 with limited drilling with COVID variant and expected cold winter. win win win..
"Getting nervous. Will oke go up if earnings beat? I'm in it at 23.95, so tempted to take money and wait for crash"
I see the price of Natural Gas going up. Its above 4 bucks. Will this help OKE's bottom line ?
"WOW, what a turnaround! Wish I'd picked up 1k at open but too scared with all the COVID and dropping oil."
"Went past 60, never looked back. Have owned for over 10 years."

"Bought into this at $27 and change, 500 shares. Very happy except I bought it in my regular trading account. Should have been my 401. Thinking of picking up a couple hundred more there. Not sure since I own 1000 SBOW. That has been a runner. By no means knowledgeable in these types of stocks."
"Oct 13 (Reuters) - Wall Street securities analysts revised their ratings and price targets on several U.S.-listed companies, : Credit Suisse raises target price to $62 from $56"
OKE recently updated their Form 8937 which shows current estimate of 70% of annual divs as ROC. The annual ROC estimate has dropped a bit each quarter but still a decent tax savings (or delay if you plan to sell at some point) when you hold in a taxable account.
Ha!!https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/california-to-build-temporary-gas-plants-to-avoid-blackouts-1.1642188
seems like a bargain or maybe investors have decided it is not worth as much as they once thought. I vote bargain
ATTENTION lol oke doesnt deal in oil for the 100th time. ignorance is bliss but not when its my money...that being said a yahoo forum has never in history moved the price of anything lol...enjoy your day
"Here is a cut and paste of what I just read on OKE. Nice reading!

Bought a small position here yesterday. How can you beat that dividend during inflation and future gas spike?
"4 or 5 more days like today, we will be at 60."
it's all about the dividend folks!!! talk to me in 5 years and tell me I'm wrong I dare you!!!
Where can I find how much OKE is hedged at for current NGL contracts? Or for any oil&gas company for that matter?
"Wrote 9 oct 15 57.50 calls for .55 this morning. Already sold and expired the 55s for .90 and received a dividend. If the 900 get called it will be a profit of 842 for dividend, 488 for current option, 810 for prior option, and since I paid 53.41 - 3681 cap gain, for a total of 6663! A gain of 13.8% in 2.5 months. That's how you do it baby."
Beautiful level to buy here!
Looks like start of a major run up ahead of the Winter cold season. Mid-Fall can be very cold sometimes too.
"SP higher than XOM, in @15 the best divvy, it keeps on giving. Oneok pays the bills…again a higher price target…crazy world…money for free…"
I want to buy more.. but this is already 39% of my portfolio lol
Best guess of why this stock isn’t getting closer to pre COVID numbers ? I understand the delusion of the stock sometime back but that is not 25 a share different.
"Oct 6 (Reuters) - Wall Street securities analysts revised their ratings and price targets onseveral U.S.-listed companies, * ONEOK Inc : JP Morgan raises price target to $60 from $58"

The hope for keeping my 1k shares that were optioned are dimming by the hour. It's OK as I will still have 2K shares that I will keep.
"I sold my oneok shares on DeGiro on 4th of august in order to make a trade, however now I dont see the reservation for 'payable dividend' anymore... Anyone has a similar experience with this on DeGiro? It's past ex-dividend date unless I'm grossly mistaken?"
OKE trading significantly higher as it turns out that Natural Gas is the key ingrediant for the miracle immortality drug.... Ok I jest. OKE higher because inflation I gather.
Volume wasn't too heavy but the price move was great. Cmon 62.5!
"Originally bought at 23.42 so I'm quit happy but I'm greedy, keep climbing oke"
Can't wait for JP Morgan to raise their price target from $60 to $61. By this time next year they could raise it to $63.
If history is kept then next ex-dividend date is roughly 10/31 give or take a day

"The earnings report reflects that this company's earnings are going to steadily rise even if conservatively which is what you want from a solid dividend payer. You want consistent steady earnings growing behind a solid management team.While I do not expect explosive share price increases like tech stocks produce, I am happy to keep buying more shares and collecting more dividends here. Share will steadily rise up with earnings, but probably not be explosive (which is ok)."
$65 next week
It’s going to be in the over 100’s here in Ok with heat factor this week. Go OKE!
There is one other point on OKE pre pandemic vs now...For all that has changed the biggest one is that OKE was on a divi increase tear and it was assumed that the divi would increase by about 20 cents in 2020...We know that did not happen...And its only with that it will start to increase again in 2022... and at what rate is an even bigger mystery...That may be the catalyst that is necessary for OKE to have the equity gains/value everyone wants
Didn't expect 63 yet. wonder if this is a dividend race
Nice...
Looks to be in line with firmed up expectations for the second half. But still within previously announced guidance range.
Will this ever make it to 60?
"-RBC Boosts Price Target on ONEOK to $56 From $54, Reiterates Sector Perform Rating"
nice upgrade and move to the upside today. my $70 Target for year-end looking good boooolya
Is this dividend safe? Asking for a friend…
"When is going under $50 I will add more. Nice company, nothing has changed, excelent dividend."
"the reason it makes sense to compare it to its lowest level last year is logical for 2 reasons. 1. you saw an unchanged profitable company fall in share price but maintained its dividend therefore buying in at that moment gives you a 16% plus yield and possible 175% return if things go back to normal, insanely good buy all around. 2. even if you were a shareholder previous to last year, the lockdown gave you the opportunity to increase your shares by 175 200% lower value therefore allowing you to accumulate div shares at an insane discount and at the same time lowering your average per share price and why wouldnt you buy down a profitable and insanely high div if you were happy owning it 200% higher...nothing changed for this companies business except a passing lockdown.. so comparing it to its black swan low makes sense if you already owned it or got in for the value. its a very rare event when you can pick up a company like this 200 to 300% off depending on what level we get back too but regardless as long as it still gets cold in winter and hot in summer and electricity needs to be made, they are just a money printing machine. its not sexy but if you didnt sieze that opportunity then idk. its as relevant as getting a tesla for half off... if i got anything half off i would say thats relevant when the reason we are here is to buy low sell high and collect free cash along the way."
"i like kmi too. it is not an LP, which makes it easier to do taxes. some companies are structured as an LP and i just hate the paperwork comes tax season .."
"Covid-related demand concerns could cause sector stocks to 'yo-yo' for a while, though I don't anticipate anything near as volatile as last year....Imho."
Last of my pipelines to report. KMI and WMB did not react to the upside on earnings. Here's to an OKE beat and price rising.
From Monday 9-20… Ref….Investors in the UK were watching for movement in the UK energy market as the government considers offering emergency state-backed loans to companies as wholesale gas prices soar. Prices have jumped 250% since January.
flirting with $60
Bought up a few more shares of OKE ahead of the ex dividend date 30 July.I am long OKE because of the dividend. If OKE continues to march higher then that is like putting yummy frosting on top of the most delicious cake.
I think we're going to have revenue beat on top and bottom line.
ONEOK reached a 52 Week high at 65.44
Tortoise and the Hare￼
most natural gas is used for electric generation...The need for the grid to stay energized never stops...
"Wow, I guess there's a chance the 54 8/27 calls I sold might get exercised by Friday. Didn't seem possible a few days ago."
Expecting a close today closer to $52 than $51 and then a nice pop upwards.
so is their earnings per share for the quarter less than the quarterly dividend? is that a concern?
$64.39 ??? I think my jaw is stuck open.
"Thats why he's called ""see nile"" Joe"
picked up 40 more under 49..... I'm happy
Here comes the March to $60.
"About time we see some major action. I have to ask myself is this solely due to winter demand, Shortage or is there some good news coming out? Any ideas?"
headed to $70 ....
"I have been reading up on OKE's business model and there is a lot of talk about being ""fee-based."" Can anyone explain to me how this works? My biggest question is, are their revenues solely based on volume? Does the rise or fall of NG prices not affect them?"
Where else can you make 7% on your $$$. Great safe place to park money.
For a non oil pipeline company it sure does follow what the oil price is doing

$60.00 hit pre-market!! Congratulations longs! This is only the beginning.
Order set for $48.00
Have some money available because this is the 10% correction
"After being up 1.52 at the high OKE just went RED. Kinda of a shocking reversal. Guess it's time for the big boys to take pipeline profits. KMI, OKE, AND WMB are all red."
"There was nothing.... "" shinny... shinny... shinny...."" in that report...And the sector has been a laggard since early July...There will be buying opportunities ahead... as the Dems will be milking the Covid cow for all its worth...."
BEAUTIFUL stock and a lesson to take “analyst” outlooks with a grain of salt…many had this “risky dividend” and future target sp 30 or less 12 months ago
Stock is flat a day before it goes ex on an up day for the market when all the oil and gas stocks are up 2-4%. Why do I have a feeling the 95 cents divvy is not going to be worth it come tomorrow.
"Cheer up PPL, Monday is payday! 20k for me. In full, on time, every time."
Amazing that you can still buy OKE this far into this rally and get a 6% divvy
$70 by year-end prediction still in play boooolya!
HAD OKE AND ENB SINCE 3/21 LOVE THE OPTIONS AND DIV.
bert owes me big time...
it's all about the dividend!
The slow bleed continues!
What’s up with pre market ? People selling and pulling some profit?
Well it's been fun conversing with you all these last several months but it looks like my call options ended my ownership in OKE. Made lots of money and had fun here. Best of luck to you all!
I bought some this morning at a little over $53. My first position with OKE. It may be a bit high of an entry point but I think oil and gas are going to be the big winners in the market in the next 12-18 months.
i am very bullish on nat gas ...
What are the odds $OKE announces a dividend increase in the coming weeks? I think this might be the quarter. I think they move from .935 to 1.00.
Here comes the old high soon. This stock was in the 20s last year. Those of us who didn't get shaken out are reaping the rewards for being able to sustain volatility.
"With the new high, here's hoping we (finally) see a dividend raise come October. Seems like a very good chance."
"Lots of profit taking, they’ll wish they hadn’t gotten out , dividend coming at end of month to !!"
Is $70.00 possible?
Here we go
Big market selloff disguises the fact that Natural Gas prices are still soaring.
when do they release the earnings report?
What’s with the options trading today?? Someone knew it was going to tank ? Or was it common sense due to COVID again? I don’t know - but I got the alert for unusual options trading today. Anyone else know ??
Can we get to $70??
OKE is worth $57 easy. Buyers are getting a deal in the $52 range.

"Stock market is funny! It is like OKE went on a commerical break. ""Right after these messages, will be righhhhhht back to $55."""
With LNG up we should be at $70/share.
I don't care what they say my evaluation is $75 it will be back stronger than pre COVID prices.
Looks like a day of consolidating the big gain.
Bought some yesterday.. my perfect timing as always :p
"Been riding it down from 57 , I’ve about had enough"
The Jan 22 60 strike calls are bidding 1.40/share. Would you take 61.40 for your shares plus a div or two?
Oneok has higher 2ndqr earnings on their website??
"Cramer just cited 'Carly Gartman' this evening as a 'successful technician' in the commodity space. Devoted 5-6 minutes of his show talking about how oil frequently 'tops in October' (citing 2014 and 2018 as examples). Gartman sees a floor at $72...and another floor at $62. OKE can print money at these prices (and yes, oil prices do affect OKE just at Nat gas prices do bc of OKE's processing of liquids (NGLs). I'm long OKE and plan to remain so. Cramer missed the oil rally entirely. He's not a fan of the space. I don't know Carly Gartman's track record. Do you? Long OKE"
Finally $65. Now $70.
free money i love it...each share i accumulate is paid for by div in 7 to 10 years...im accumulating free money....in 10 years no matter what share price is its all profit...the only reason its down is because its wrapped into so many dow etfs.
"Is OKE going to hit new high again today? Oh well, who cares on a few pennies."

Got to 1000 shares today! goal is 1070 for $1000 payment every 3 months! nothing like giving yourself a $4000 raise.. man i love this stock and company.
Right at 52 week highThanks W 
remember when you thought to yourself.. why didn't i buy more of this when it was under 50???.... Yeah.. you remember! now GO BUY IT!
"its true oil and gas are both energy commodities and follow similar trends when everything is normal. But as we move away from oil which seems like a goal for alot of people, you will see a divergence in correlation since using less oil means using a vast ampunt more of natural gas to spin those electric turbines. The attempt or success of phasing out oil is a positive for oke and so was the fracking ban since we already own our deposits. the fracking ban just gave oke less competition for the future. enjoy divi day everyone"
Let’s see a new high today.
"Wrote 10 8/17 54 calls on Fri. for .80 a share. Don't mind if these ""trading"" shares get called away. Still long and strong on my core position, although, I don't see them going up until after this Delta surge passes and winter heating season is upon us."

After holding since the early 20's i've decided to sell. It's been a great run. I may reenter if it dips enough. If not i'm fully satisfied with my decision. That's taking into account this doesn't jump to a hundred soon. Then i'll be kicking a metal garbage can.
For 2 quarters in a row earnings at pre-pandemic highs…when it traded at $70+

Its no mid-twenties from a year ago but still trading at 2016 prices
im up over 100% in a year with a huge dividend. i really dont see how anyone could ask for more...see you in 25 years
Can someone please tell me if OKE issues a K-1 or a 1099 at years end? thanks
"Somewhere between 60 and 66 and I am out. If it hits 61 I'll put a 59.95 stop loss sell order on for 2k shares. If it keeps going up I will bump the stop loss up. My sell target was originally 60 and I've been burnt by not selling at my target but thanks to understanding stop loss sell orders, it will not happen this time. That is assuming it gets to 60 and above."
"Well only 1 of my 10 54 call options got assigned Friday, so I only had to sell 100 shares. I'll take that, still hold 2900. Go OKE!"
What a beautiful stock
Im perfectly okay if OKE hovers in the 60s and pays off debts before raising dividend. Its 17% of my portfolio but I dont plan on buying anymore or only few at a time. Dripping this baby til I retire
(Sung to the tune of Kung#$%$ Fighting): Everybody gone Nat Gas Buying!!! Everyday its OKE share Price Flying!!!
$60 has been elusive; still plodding along on its march.
