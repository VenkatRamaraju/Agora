"Oct 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street securities analysts revised their ratings and price targets on severalU.S.-listed companies, * ONEOK Inc : Mizuho raises target price to $61 from $53"
ONEOK reached a 52 Week high at 64.58
"Slowly but steady up! In @15....OKE pays the bills, best divvy, money for free, crazy world! The gift that keeps giving...."
Can't wait for JP Morgan to raise their price target from $60 to $61. By this time next year they could raise it to $63.
OKE. Like AAPL…own it don’t trade it. Beautiful dividend play.
Well it's been fun conversing with you all these last several months but it looks like my call options ended my ownership in OKE. Made lots of money and had fun here. Best of luck to you all!
"Getting nervous. Will oke go up if earnings beat? I'm in it at 23.95, so tempted to take money and wait for crash"
"I have been reading up on OKE's business model and there is a lot of talk about being ""fee-based."" Can anyone explain to me how this works? My biggest question is, are their revenues solely based on volume? Does the rise or fall of NG prices not affect them?"
Can we get to $70??
Finally $65. Now $70.
Oke doke
Nice...

BEAUTIFUL stock and a lesson to take “analyst” outlooks with a grain of salt…many had this “risky dividend” and future target sp 30 or less 12 months ago
$60.00 hit pre-market!! Congratulations longs! This is only the beginning.
Good thing bigpothead amd ali sold at $30 
(Sung to the tune of Kung#$%$ Fighting): Everybody gone Nat Gas Buying!!! Everyday its OKE share Price Flying!!!
"with yield at 5.6%, this is looking fully valued without a div bump"
Falling back to low 60s. Oh well. was nice seeing 40% profit but im in for divis
the technology to get rid of natural gas electric generation doesnt exist and the push for electric heating and electric vehicles only adds insane amount of demand on the grid...coal is almost phased out so unless people want to build 100 or more nuclear plants i think its safe to say oke will be fine for a very long time...The more they push green the more natural gas will be needed until they invent new battery technology that we are not even close too..also the fracking ban on new leases on federal land only increases our profit because our leases are already in place...basically their is a need for our product that will only increase and theirs nowhere else to get it because of legislation...the push for green is the best thing that could ever happen. the irony is not many people understand how electricity is made and how your electric cars get power...if natural gas output was stopped for 1 week the country what fall apart...unless the country wants to go back to the 1800s we are dependant on natural gas and its good becausd we have loads of it....im so glad people are not educated or i never would have gotten so many dirt cheap shares due to covid and climate change related issues.....lets keep the lights on...
"When is She.gonna slow down? I am torn here, Exit or await q3 reports."
"Pre-market stronger today than yesterday. OKE has entered clearly into the Momentum zone. Which means the pricing can get overheated at some point, but it is incredibly challenging and beyond my abilities to fogure out. A share price that climbs a ton in a short time could do so just because it has earned a higher p/e multiple. Or it could just be overheated momentum. But, thankfully, I don't have to time the market with OKE. I can just collect the dividends."
"Went past 60, never looked back. Have owned for over 10 years."
If history is kept then next ex-dividend date is roughly 10/31 give or take a day
"Oct 13 (Reuters) - Wall Street securities analysts revised their ratings and price targets on several U.S.-listed companies, : Credit Suisse raises target price to $62 from $56"
"I've been a ONEOK investor for 30 years through the ups and downs. I'm staying with them. Long-hauler, I guess."
Oct 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street securities analysts revised their ratings and price targets on several U.S.-listed companies * ONEOK Inc : Raymond James raises target price to $67 from $55
I don't care what they say my evaluation is $75 it will be back stronger than pre COVID prices.
"Oct 6 (Reuters) - Wall Street securities analysts revised their ratings and price targets onseveral U.S.-listed companies, * ONEOK Inc : JP Morgan raises price target to $60 from $58"
What a beautiful stock
"I guess it is just profit taking, because this stock has made a greta run, but I just dont understand why anyone would be selling this stock with the dividend only 10 days away ?"
Is there an ex dividend date yet
Im perfectly okay if OKE hovers in the 60s and pays off debts before raising dividend. Its 17% of my portfolio but I dont plan on buying anymore or only few at a time. Dripping this baby til I retire
Are we ready to declare $66 as resistance...At least there is the catalyst of EPS next week...Mr Market has had its hand around the throat of this midstream rally...Not sure we break this resistance point until volumes in the US are let loose....On another note... OKE would be positioned to pick up some ENBL assets on the cheap in OK when the FTC forces ET to sell some assets in order to close that deal...Its good to be the shopper with a wad of cash in your hand when there is a fire sale... even better when the clothes fit and are just your style
"Price will drop a bit today , it goes x- dividend, no worries"
$65 next week
No change in dividend…
Here comes the old high soon. This stock was in the 20s last year. Those of us who didn't get shaken out are reaping the rewards for being able to sustain volatility.
"Cramer just cited 'Carly Gartman' this evening as a 'successful technician' in the commodity space. Devoted 5-6 minutes of his show talking about how oil frequently 'tops in October' (citing 2014 and 2018 as examples). Gartman sees a floor at $72...and another floor at $62. OKE can print money at these prices (and yes, oil prices do affect OKE just at Nat gas prices do bc of OKE's processing of liquids (NGLs). I'm long OKE and plan to remain so. Cramer missed the oil rally entirely. He's not a fan of the space. I don't know Carly Gartman's track record. Do you? Long OKE"
