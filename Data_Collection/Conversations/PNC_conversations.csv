PNC is the only bank I am holding my positions during this time. they are sitting on billions of dollars as CASH after selling Blackrock equity and in the perfect position to invest in other opportunities at rock bottom prices. Their network is very strong.
"What does everyone think about Warren Buffett closing his position on PNC. I love PNC and planned on keeping it for many years to come, but this makes me a little nervous..."
$PNC Target Raised by RBC Capital Outperform USD 200 ¬ª USD 220Target Raised by Barclays Equal Weight USD 203 ¬ª USD 220
Bought a year ago and I'm up almost 75%. Not bad for a regional bank. I'd sell but I think more good will come.
The PNC Financial Services reached an all time high at 208.97
"Even though rate cuts are likely, buy regional bank stocks like $pnc $key $mtb. They hedge against rate cuts and go through stress test to have sufficient capital and liquidity to withstand situations like this, plus they offer decent dividends."
"What an incompetent group at PNC when you call on the 800 customer line.I had an issued parking ticket for Aug 29 and paid for it on the same date. When I asked their customer service agent for a payment receipt, the statement read paid on Aug 28. Such a simple procedure.Office hours are short and banks in small towns are being closed.Be careful dealing with this bank in the future."
Price target $211. Sounds good to me.
Warren Buffett just bought a stake on this bank
"I believe PNC will be 150 again at some point. The question is when. Science and/or time will likely win the battle vs. the virus. But, the longer it takes, the more the underlying damage to the economy and the banks. if the virus is eliminated by Jan/Feb I think PNC thrives in 2021. If the virus continues to disrupt through the end of 2021, I think PNC drops well below 100 in 2021. Good luck longs."

Bought a small community bank stock 40 years ago. It was bought up by PNC. My investment was $600.00. Today I get over $5000.00 a year in dividends. Slow and steady wins the race.
"IF you believe in the new treatment breakthroughs and that we will have a good vaccine by end of the year, this is a great time to begin accumulating PNC (imho). 4.47% dividend, a lot of cash, and thee great one (Warren) is accumulating. I own 250 shares and will be building on it the next few weeks if nothing changes. Good luck long and strong."
A dividend and earnings .. Wow its going up 10 percent
"NEVER BUY THE PEAK, over valued big time!!!"
California Unions negotiating a 10 % wage cut . Another proof statement that yes labor costs are an issue .Also if the most Left Wing pro active labor State [ one of the few states that mandates a 30 minute worker break] with a far Lefty Governor can understand economics . Why can`t the UAW understand it is driving Ford toward bankruptcy even before the virus. But now with the pedal to the medal toward bankrupcy . Why didn't Ford management take drastic pay cuts ? And at the annual meeting after announcing management cuts and across the board pay cuts from anyone earning 200k to 65 k a 10% cut . Drastic cuts for 200k to the 18 million for Hackett . State UAW it is time for us to have a wage structure that allows us to profit year after year .Why are we waiting until Bankruptcy becomes the option to change the structure like it did last time. The Two Tier wage and lower wages is the only thing that saved Ford and let the Company profit for a few years.
