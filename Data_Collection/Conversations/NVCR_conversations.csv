"Believe it or not,but this stock is up $10 this week,and the week isn't over yet!"
Has big swings. Could be over $200 in a few months
"The company has announced an agreement for a clinical trial collaboration with RHHBY for using a combination with their anti-PD-L1 therapy. The PhII (n=75) is designed to evaluate TTFields together with atezolizumab, and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."
Two weeks until earnings. Usually comes very early in the morning our time.I’m hoping Novocure releases trial updates a week before. Dare we hope?
3rd quarter results are out! Check the NVCR website.
NovoCure reached a 52 Week low at 106.24
Is it a buy yet ?
"I'm the one who mentioned UPST earlier. I didn't buy it, but I see it is doing very well today. Shortly after you cited it, there was an analyst on tv who had it as his top pick and thought it still had a long way to run. I believe his new top pick was Generac, and he also liked Bombadier.Someone else said UPST might run into trouble if the 50 day moving average was breached.I'm retired and have besn focusing on income producers recently, without much success. In that vein I did recommend the following to my sister--MS preferred (MS.E), JEPI, SRLN, BP."

There has to be news here that we are missing . The stock is going crazy in after-hours trading.
"In the lightning round, Kramer recommended sticking with NVCR. Said it has amazing device which has extended peoples' lives by years. Welcome, but somewhat overstated. He is also very high on Upstart."
"NVCR is not a buy yet, the thing that's killing it, and many of the med techs, is JB's policies. The vaccines mandates has a lot of docs and a huge # of nurses leaving jobs, that will definitely constrain non-essential surgeries, and even defer detection. Do you see the ads on TV about cancer screenings? That's bcse the # of screenings have dropped off a lot. No screenings, more cancer gets advanced, and more people die. Thanks, Joe. Meanwhile, I have a lot of SWAV and NVCR, and I just keep sucking up these drops. I shd have exited when this started, we all knew the outcome, but we have taken a lot of pain, and it's not over."

It’s always had huge swings. Might be wise to buy at $116
"NVCR may see under $100. share price today. Still, in the long term, a winner."
"Yesterday, during Novocure's sell-off, I somewhat cavalierly said, ""if you sell now you know the very next day will be when ""...the trial data gets released."" Someone correctly noted that the trial end date is summer 2024.Remember, however, this clinical trial is open label now. The strong positive results that became apparent during the trial were made public. All participants in the trial are now receiving the Keytruda-Tumor Treating Fields regimen. IF, and admittedly it's a big if, the results continue to show strong ORR and continues to meet the other objective trial criteria, there will be announcements long before 2024. I'd expect to see another dramatic move up on the announcement (remember the $50+ jump in share price)?That's the information upon which I based my original comment.Here is the link to the clinical trial at NIH.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04892472?term=Keytruda+and+Tumor+Treating+Fields&cond=NSCLC&draw=2&rank=1"
"On Thursday when Novocure reports, if there is any bad news, I expect another very bad day for the share price. On the other hand, if Novocure provides a positive update on ongoing trials, share price may do ok. What I would really like to happen is to see a surprise update, especially on nsclc. Basically, I just expect more pain for the next few months."
"Good direction! down, please. I wanna enforce my long term position."
Interesting major pharma confidence. could be approaching takeover/ merger range. Close to 900 million of cash on hand too. PPS getting into takeover/merger territory. Good Luck to All…https://www.novocuretrial.com/
Why the sell-off is so steep suddenly? Even last year the drop wasn’t this bad
Wells Fargo goes from 180 to 105. That’s a price cut!!
Sell now! NWBO about to post topline data on GBM trial all signs point to success. This Imo is the reason for the drop in NVCR. Good luck to all.
they could broker the ino/nvcr/regeneron/zai lab work/collab?
"Nothing has changed about the likelihood of getting approvals for additional indications. Which is what will make or break the company. We already knew that the glioblastoma markets in the US and EMEA were not gonna grow any further. So, the Q3 earnings shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone."
"This stock is definitely going to separate the boys from the men.Like the song says"" Should i stay or should I go!""Time will tell."
"After being up mid-day by $2.50, Novocure ends the day -$0.01Volume was less than 50% of 3 month average volume. A very weak performance.Yes, we know it’s all about whether there will be updates on some of the late trials. If you’re still holding shares you already know this information."
Trading line a lead balloonWhat info are we not privy to?
"Unless the cc has really important trial update, I’m going to say share price goes down.A lot. I just bought 100 more shares yesterday."
"Just with the available cash on hand which is close to 1 billion dollars values this company well above 100 pps. Definitely becoming attractive to suitors at this range. Whoa! At September 30, 2021, we had $933.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, an increase of $91.2 million compared to $842.6 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was primarily due to the cash flow from operations and the exercise of options."

"We are trading below March 2021 levels, even though the fundamentals have improved a lot since then in my opinion. The DMC recommendation in the non small cell lung cancer trial makes me very optimistic that the data will be positive. An approval in lung cancer will like 10x (?) or something the number of patients eligible for TTF. If the data is positive, it will also increase the chances of TTF being effective in the other indications. If it works in glioblastoma, mesothelioma and lung cancer, it's reasonable to assume that it will also work in ovarian, pancreatic and so on. It's the same mechanism of action everywhere."
"I wish the after-hours gains would hold on occasion. But,they rarely do."
We can all debate the price action and lower lows and higher highs but the reality is this stock will soar if and when it gets approvals for treatment of many of the cancers they are currently doing trials on . It's pretty simple if they don't get those approvals this stock will go back down to whence it came the 20-30s if that much . But if they get the approvals in the next couple of years this stock will soar and that's why many of us are long. Sure tough to watch it go from 220 to 120 but it was great seeing it go from 20 to 120 ...guess I'm even. Point is I don't think traditional charting and analysis is as significant when you are betting on a company to have major medical breakthroughs. IMHO
"Now that the last patient has been enrolled in INNOVATE-3, any guesses on how long it will take the DMC to conduct the interim analysis?"

NovoCure is up 4.92% to 115.79
Q3 financial results are not pretty. Revenue growth remains stalled. Losses increased. PANOVA has completed enrollment.
