"Right on schedule on the close, nvcr sells off. Good luck with earnings early tomorrow morning."
"Those who want a buyout at $120 or $200 think about this: What if Novocure announces that they are able to cure breast cancer? What would a good buyout value be - $1,000? $10,000? An overly dramatic example to be sure, but the upside potential of this company is Huge."
"In a situation like this, I would hope institutional and other major holders will pressure company leaders to fix the fllat tire by issuing positive or at least stabilizing information."
Tech analyst said a month ago that $128 looks like support. Volatile stock but next 12 months looks good
Any idea as to why stock is down given the recent news?
This was actually a good day for NVCR. I will take a wash day right now. Especially when the MKT is down over 500.
Again - novocure produced endpoint data that was far superior to what the current standard of care for this cancer type produced during its phase 2 trial. While also producing no additional toxicity. Not all cancer treatments are slam dunk amazing result treatments. Unresectable HCC has an abysmal prognosis and this treatment modality has the potential to prolong survival and decrease tumor burden in patients who never would have had that chance before.
From The Street....“The oncology company has had a strong run and all the technical signals indicate the move higher isn't over.”
Wish share volume was higher but I’m not gonna complain!

"Last week, the FDA granted breakthrough designation to the NovoTTF-200T System, TTFields, to be delivered together with atezolizumab and bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic liver cancer."
I LOVE THIS COMPANY !
Sell now! NWBO about to post topline data on GBM trial all signs point to success. This Imo is the reason for the drop in NVCR. Good luck to all.
When Yahoo gives you a 1 year target price estimate of $86.71 what date was the 1 year target estimate starting from?
Terrible action in NVCR. If we don’t hold this gap….we will see 110-120’s quickly.
Safe treatments that are able to halt progression of disease without causing acute/chronic side effects are immensely invaluable in oncology. The results released today show that novocure has a safe treatment modality that works. Nothing negative here today.
And here comes the test to hold.
"Btw, I’m in Pacific Time so it’s very, very early."
Can anyone give me a valuation method they use for this stock rather than pie in the sky numbers they come up with. It’s why I use technicals. Cause if I am correct this trades at 30x sales and makes no money….

I am long for novocure. But don’t know why no insider buying even after it drops nearly 50% from peak
do not be confused. this science is not changing soon. nvcr had a corner on an entirely alternative treatment. will apply to all solid tumors because they all multiply faster than normal tissue and they all will be susceptible to this treatment. novocure will augment many many solid tumor treatments. the next step after this is crsp cas to stop the mutation allowing the cancer to grow. that's a long ways off.
Piper Sandler raised price target today from $235 to $240. $200 is the 200 day moving average. That is the obvious magnet it goes to. Then we will see how he behaves
Ok the gap from 129.14 has been filled with a RSI of 18. I have stepped with lunch money and made a buy.
"I have to believe that many companies would be interested in buying out NVCR. Almost profitable already, growing aggressively, very healthy margins, expansion of cancer treatments, new products and design. This will be much higher if we don’t get bought out soon."
"HUD designation covers devices that treat rare, orphan diseases or conditions. The HUD designation is the first step in obtaining a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) for the treatment of pleural mesothelioma with TTFields. Novocure enrolled the last patient in its STELLAR trial, a phase 2 pilot trial in pleural mesothelioma, in March 2017 and, with final data collection in 2018, is evaluating its options to file an HDE application with the STELLAR data. An approved HDE would allow Novocure to market TTFields in combination with standard of care chemotherapy as a treatment for pleural mesothelioma in the USA"
"Is price rise in stock due to speculation of takeover? Did such thinking drive stock into fifties last year?Or is realization setting in this company is unique and has cornered the fourth leg of cancer treatment?They currently only serve a market size of ~12,000 US population with only active customer base ~ 2500.In five years they will have product base for ~2,500,000. That is a “sales forecast potential population” from JPM conference. See slide 15.Then there will be the parallel royalty payment stream coming from ZLAB in that time frame.These facts have to make one giddy thinking about the potential revenue growth this company will achieve which I think is what ultimately will drive stock price which is already very rich at just under 15x sales for 2019 at $280million. This sales figure given by CEO at JPM but it is just an extrapolation of 4th q sales. Could be higher and closer to $300 million or 20% growth year over year.There is a lot to like here and at ZLAB."
"As ordinary investors of Novocure, we are confronted with a whole bunch of intangible and unpredictable factors only company insiders/managements are privy to. As such, I don't think anyone of us are in the position to realistically predict future price targets, support or resistance level based on fundamental or technical data available only in the public domain. A sudden release of good or bad news can easily derail any predictions, propelling the stock way up or way down, past either support or resistance level.Sorry to say, but for investment of bio-medical stocks, a huge element of LUCK comes into play!Regarding Novocure, right now, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that future treatment studies of other deadly cancer scenarios like stomach, lung, pancreas....etc would yield positive and better results and give the stock price a further boost?!"
10x bagger for me. still holding core from 2017. Lots of catalysts within next few years. still under the radar.
"Mizuho analyst Difei Yang raised the firm's price target on Novocure to $175 from $150 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst views the post-earnings weakness in shares of Novocure as a buying opportunity. Novocure should be valued on the long-term fundamentals and prospects of the business rather than short-term earnings, Yang tells investors in a research note. The analyst expects 2021 to be ""catalyst-rich"" for the company with the potential to further validate its Optune platform."

It’s always had huge swings. Might be wise to buy at $116
the new device allowance is a statement of effectiveness and also non interference with the pd drug administration simultaneously......didn't affect the cellular pharmacokinetics .....and therefore is a considered part of a multi approach to treatment.........at least with drugs listed. now question could be use with dna/mrna vaccine/treatments.
Hey I love talking my book. This thing is so heavy. Prepare one’s mind for $125.
Volatile stock but could rocket to new highs with little notice
Wells Fargo goes from 215 to 180. Expect more of this
"Buy high, panic sell low"
The oncology results speak the entire story as to the forward looking value for Novocure’s stock. Their technology is literally a breakthrough regarding the treatment of solid tumors and increased survivability for cancer victims. IMHO this stock has become a certainty for investors who are risk adverse.
We can all debate the price action and lower lows and higher highs but the reality is this stock will soar if and when it gets approvals for treatment of many of the cancers they are currently doing trials on . It's pretty simple if they don't get those approvals this stock will go back down to whence it came the 20-30s if that much . But if they get the approvals in the next couple of years this stock will soar and that's why many of us are long. Sure tough to watch it go from 220 to 120 but it was great seeing it go from 20 to 120 ...guess I'm even. Point is I don't think traditional charting and analysis is as significant when you are betting on a company to have major medical breakthroughs. IMHO
"you don't just go to the pharm/clinical trials committee and get approval on a whim..you need preliminary data...something must look at least interesting. and given the end stage nature of this disease process being treated, any improvement over current outcome will be immediately result in compassionate care approval. wags. metastatic pancreatic survival 3-5 months....given the prognosis, they should be seeing results by feb/march?"
An afterhours 3+ dollar drop seemed to contradict my earlier observation of typically after hours gains. But then another trade came in to basically nullify that loss and close at an exact dollar amount.
Any news to explain move up?
I am not happy
"This is on a lot of people’s radar screen. The technicals are strong. Momentum begets momentum. It is just starting to break out from a big base. For us that own this in the teens, we saw this several years ago after it broke out at 35. Patience."
"I posted that I was disappointed in the CMS CAC meeting for device application yesterday. Because the committee seemed so skeptical of our presentation. However, I talked with IR and they said that everyone she had talked with at NVCR was pleased at the end of the day with the scoring, and that they had expected some skepticism with a novel cancer treatment. Therefore, I bought another 115k of NVCr because I now expect approval. I am also comforted by BlackRock purchase of 5+% of the company!,"
"WOW! To discontinue the placebo requirements for humanitarian reasons because of treatment group success is huge. “After reviewing interim data, the data monitoring committee accelerated Novocure's late-stage study in non-small cell lung cancer patients. It stated Novocure doesn't need to reach 534 patients with 18 months of follow-up. Instead, the committee recommended the company test 276 patients with 12 months of follow-up time”."
Terrible action.
I’m concerned the institutions will be wanting a Acquisition!
"if nvcr in your ira and you're over 72...you have obligatory withdrawal ...you can move the shares out of ira and pay the tax and get back in via cash account...also, you can distribute the move.....or just keep it in cash and miss out on the fun....."
Some good news
I’d be patient here. Could easily double from here over next 12 months
Not if the Ovarian results come out first. Then you will be covering your book. Don't pump your chest too much.

NVCR little changed on a fairly negative day for the overall market.
Two weeks until earnings. Usually comes very early in the morning our time.I’m hoping Novocure releases trial updates a week before. Dare we hope?
"Good to see that the market is partly reversing its overreaction. It is a pity that some trials are postponed as clinics dedicate resources to Covid-19 related matters but on the other hand we can be sure that these trials will be the first to be advanced again once progress to fight the new Corona virus is made. This company's devices are extending lives and as this is proven for more and more types of cancer the potential is huge. Keep in mind that even in the current circumstances, one trial (INNOVATE-3) is actually still outpacing expectations and the GBM approval for China is on track. Plenty of exciting news ahead!"

Looking at a BO of $50+ in 2018 or early 19
Five years ago today we bought our first position in NovoCure. Never regretted that decision.
"Just heard Novocure’s CEO comment on forward revenue stream as being sufficient to pay for ongoing trials. Thus, outside investments will not be necessary as in the past. This is surprisingly good news!"
I feel lucky I bought this stock. It was a recommendation. Do you think this is a good long term stock going into the next 3-5 yrs? I see it is a bit volatile but the co seems that have things in the pipeline. Thanks.

Can anyone remember the the last time that Novocure moved higher in the final 30 minutes of trading rather than selling off? Feels like it must be months ago!
"In the lightning round, Kramer recommended sticking with NVCR. Said it has amazing device which has extended peoples' lives by years. Welcome, but somewhat overstated. He is also very high on Upstart."
What is wrong with this company? Input please. I own a few shares and would like hold it but it gets tougher every day watching this thing go south.
Key institutional buyer kept adding last quarter. Now one of largest holder.
"Corinne, If you are becoming critical, I noticed earlier today that your Upstart isn't exactly burning up the tape. Hope the others you mentioned are doing better."
"Not responsible for the recent post by a different Paul. We should bear in mind that Keytruda has already been shown to be effective with chemo and more recently, by itself. The population treated in the trial with NVCR may differ by being less susceptible to Keytruda, and thus the results could show the value of adding NVCR."
"INNOVATE-3 interim analysis expected in Q3 2021 according to the corporate presentation. That's like 9 days left. The thing about this stock is, there are not a lot of short-term catalysts other than that interim analysis. Final data of the pivotal trials are not coming before the 2nd half of 2022. Revenue from glioblastoma is not gonna grow significantly anymore since all the major markets that they are currently in are already mature markets. I'm hoping for some geographical expansion into markets like France in 2022."
"Remember at $225 we had Garry and his Pom poms and other’s telling us hiow high this was going. Today at $140 we get  from NWBO, a turd going down the toilet, telling us how NVCR is rubbish. Thanks for playing!! We know what the company is doing. They are spending money to ramp trials. We know GMB business is maturing. We know the technology works for GMB. We think it does for other cancers, and why not. Me thinks the gap was filled today from the break out months ago. If you didn’t sell any up there you are a pig. Just like the Pom poms over 200….the clowns from NWBO should tell you something down here at these prices. The charts are damaged and will take time to repair. Let’s hope the money being spent on trials is being put to good use. For the NWBO clowns will disappear, only wishing they were wearing a tin cap should we get good results. Peace out for a while"
Painful... we cannot seem to catch a break. Hoping for positive news regarding the Ovarian trials this week. Some progress with the TTF + Chemo pilot trial in China announced today. Q3 results later this month.
"I, also, made a slightaddition to my initialvery small position which was further reduced on the way up."
Why can't they provide interim results for the nsclc trial that seemed so promising based on earlier news reports?
"You all know that if you sell Novocure shares now, the very next day will be when the Keytruda - Optune trial data gets released….."
I hear you. Discovered this stock at 22.00. I'm just saying you cant totally forget the opportunities Fundamentally ahead for this Company. Non small lung cancer is still out there so its easy to jump on the stock that is as thinly traded as NVCR and lean on it. It just takes one headline and all this technical mumbo jumbo is out the window. I will keep my bet on the technology and leave the charts to the others.
Price objective is 124 on point and figure charts. With no news coming….this can get very slippery as shorts will attack with vengeance. Anyone averaging in? Been very quite here.
"Simply there is now no ceiling...Good Luck to All...The current technical condition for NVCR is strong and the chart pattern suggests that upward momentum should continue. The stock has outperformed the market over the last 50 trading days when compared to the S&P 500. The MACD-LT is confirming that the intermediate-term trend is bullish. NVCR's chart formation indicates a strong rising trend. Upside momentum, as measured by the 9-day RSI indicator is very strong. The stock is in a short-term overbought condition based on a Slow % K stochastic reading of 80 or higher. Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on up days than on down days, indicating that NVCR is under accumulation, which is a bullish condition. The stock is trading above a rising 50-day moving average. This validates the strong technical condition for NVCR. The stock is above its 200-day moving average which is pointed up indicating that the intermediate term trend is bullish."
"Wedbush...estimates $4.23/share in 2023. Make that GAAP of $3.50 or so, and a share price of $300 would not be out of the question; the growth rate for nonGAAP of $4.23 in 3 years from $0.45 in 2020 us about 110% per year. That would justify PPS of over $400."
Love the rise and slight fall of this stock. It clearly got out of hand rocketing to near 100 level... I absolutely feel comfortable in the pullback to this level. Been with this company a long time and I think the last few months have been FANTASTIC and everything about this company seems HEALTHY. A+ rating.
"Sadly most of the patients for this trial were already on death's door - not really a testament to the real effective treatment. Hopefully they will go back on a better trial procedure. The results were still outstanding compared to any other treatment available by a good %. The FDA should encourage a more diverse group of test individuals especially because the side effects are nil. This stock really fell on panic mode, but thank goodness in it providing a buying opportunity at present. This methodology of treatment actually is a no brainer when clearly understands the science here. It really goes back to Tesla's work. Just like he found resonant frequencies could in fact shake buildings and bridges till they could in fact tumble or crumble. Just as an oscillating fan at a certain frequency was able to make factory workers sick early in the day. NVCR is really on to something that has been widely overlooked by the scientific community for years. This technology actually at a larger scale could in fact cause earth quakes, tidal waves and believe it or not a way at the quantum level to communicate across deep space in rapid time periods. It is also what would be needed to open up interstellar travel."
"New high everyday for this stock.....so, what is a REASONABLE price target for it?! Potential take-over candidate by one of those BIG pharma a reason for this recent rise?!"
"At 3:00pm, right on schedule, nvcr begins its afternoon's final selloff. Usually on low volume, it's mostly a few sellers and a lack of buyers willing to step up. Oh well."
"Don't know who ""kastenz"" is or why he showed up on this message board. His statements about nvcr are incorrect if you read his posts. Just check out the Novocure website clinical trials to see for yourself.There are four indications in Phase III trials: pancreatic cancer; ovarian cancer; brain metastasis; and non-small cell lung cancer.In my opinion, using CAR-t valuations to determine the potential value of Novocure is non-sensical. Novocure now has two approved indications. Proof of concept is now well established. His timelines for addional approvals are non-sensical. He is merely posting FUD."
they could broker the ino/nvcr/regeneron/zai lab work/collab?
"The company has announced that the FDA has granted breakthrough designation to the NovoTTF-200T system, intended for use together with atezolizumab and bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC."
Do they even have proof that it has cured one person? Just one person who after 5 years can take off the helmet and walk away and cancer free? I would like to know. I have not heard of any.
Markets also down big so that doesn't help either.
Does anyone believe the September 4th & 5th presentations will be to enlighten us about the phase 3 pancreatic ongoing tests?
new need for granular token control over remote work /robotic manufacturing like pharma/zai lab nvcr/ or amsc in china.......granular electromagnetic tuning.........might be what nvcr has is more valuable for this function.........wags. new crypto /token based trading or functionality....software/and hardware......?
"Anyone selling NVCR as an investor, not a trader….hasn’t a clue about this company. I added. A gift check out PAVM. interesting company. I will add to it on dips."
"We have a friend at Chase...

Where are the results?Q3 is over
"Would love to see Medicare pay from the beginning of all 300 patients. But if we can just get the 300 paid moving forward, I believe the company is positive cash flow without trying to offset with unusual expenses to justify the bottom line. This is very good for the company. I think we see 75 to 100 by end of the year if approval does come through."
"Why NVCR is unlike most other biotech/pharm companies:1) There is absolutely no competition for this unique technology. And likely won't be even after the patent expires because the experience of developing and fine tuning this treatment would take years for any new company copying the product, and the enhancements and patentable additions will likely dissuade competition.2) This is not like a drug trial for small molecules or MAB. Those are all subject to adverse SE ruining the product, and usually the one-horse company.3) The treatment is a medical device/appliance. It is regulated by a division of the FDA different from the one responsible for biologicals and small molecules. There are no surprise SE likely after all of the base research and world wide approved clinical trails.4) All cells that divide, must divide by the mechanism of spindle formation and division, segregating the DNA up along a mitotic plate and dividing the cell. There is no other way for cells to do this AND cells can never mutate to circumvent the efficacy of the treatment that interferes with this process.4) This can treat every solid tumor which can be localized and attacked by the EM field.5) I predict that this technology will be used in conjunction with every pharmaceutical and biological treatment that in themselves, can not eradicate the tumor unless there is shown no survival extension by the combination of the two which, I would find hard to believe.What is the rational company valuation? What is a fair market capitalization. This poses a definite problem assessing, because the eventual profit profile can be envisioned yet. How do you value a company whose product has worldwide market for every solid cancer not fully eradicatable by other means?I have owned this company since the stock was $20 and have added continuously. Even at what must seem like a lofty price in comparison to what it had been and to how other pharma/biologicals companies are valued, I do not think there is any valid comparison that can be made until the full value of the potential of its market penetration and saturation can be assessed. I do not believe any ""analysts"" who change price targets except pure technicians who are looking at short to intermediate terms stock chart patterns have anything valid to contribute. I think the story of Tesla is instructive. Conventional analysis totally missed the meaning of the stock, its technology, and its dominance. And even here Tesla is likely to having withering competition in the near future, something that is not going to happen with NVCR. What does this retreat from 170 augur? IMO, at worst, about the same as the worst price retractions we have previously seen (i.e 100 to 60 and 140 to 110). At worst I would expect about a 35 point retraction. Since this is so unpredictable, I see any sudden downward move, particularly on low volume as a buying opportunity. Even including here from my perspective because you can never tell when you will have another big leap up. Biggest risks here are to a corporate buy-out. This current move seems the result of upside transient exhaustion, and the analyst's change from strong buy to buy. Pretty non-consequential if you consider the underlying product potential.All this is just MHO. Invest at your own risk."

"Yesterday, during Novocure's sell-off, I somewhat cavalierly said, ""if you sell now you know the very next day will be when ""...the trial data gets released."" Someone correctly noted that the trial end date is summer 2024.Remember, however, this clinical trial is open label now. The strong positive results that became apparent during the trial were made public. All participants in the trial are now receiving the Keytruda-Tumor Treating Fields regimen. IF, and admittedly it's a big if, the results continue to show strong ORR and continues to meet the other objective trial criteria, there will be announcements long before 2024. I'd expect to see another dramatic move up on the announcement (remember the $50+ jump in share price)?That's the information upon which I based my original comment.Here is the link to the clinical trial at NIH.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04892472?term=Keytruda+and+Tumor+Treating+Fields&cond=NSCLC&draw=2&rank=1"
This recent drop has to do with the Wells Fargo conference. The CFO and COO offered nothing of substance. This is a good company that has no short term growth. This why the multiples are compressing
"Just listened to the cc which just concluded. Led by Bill Doyle and seemed somewhat low energy. Our continuing pandemic remained a reason for lower than expected growth as recruiting for trials and and enrolling new patients for treatment remained challenging. Overall delays of up to two quarters in a few trials is one result. There seemed some enthusiasm for the Hepanova trial seemed a bit surprising but Doyle offered an interesting comparison. The first data for GBM from many years ago was equally ""weak."" The first GBM patients treated had advanced disease and results were far from inspiring but did show that Optune could show a level of improvement that was statistically significant - patients showed improvement over the standard of care treatments. They expect something similar to happen with liver cancer. Perhaps 8 questions were asked and no criticisms were leveled. All in all, investors need to remain patient and accept the ups and downs."
"Piper Sandler analyst Jason Bednar notes Novocure reported Q4 results, including revenue of $144M that capped off a strong year that consisted of nearly $500M in revenue and progress across the company's large and expanding clinical pipeline. There was a lot of attention paid to the trial milestone updates, and it's these adjustments that seem to be causing an ""overreaction to the downside"" in shares on Thursday, the analyst contended. However, Bednar argues that there's nothing he sees in Q4 results or heard on the conference call that alters his positive long-term fundamental view of Novocure's TTField technology and the potential it has to provide for significant long-term growth via indication and market expansion. Therefore, he would encourage long-term investors to use the move lower as an opportunity to get involved or increase exposure with Novocure ahead of a catalyst-rich next couple years. The analyst reiterates an Overweight rating and a $225 price target on the shares."

Cathie Woods must discover NVCR as a disruptive technology in Pharma. Wait and see if she is really that smart
The price action could be because people don't want to be holding when the test results come out. They may be gun shy because of the last announcement.
"Here’s some news you can consider.I visited the Novocure website. Novocure now lists 96 job openings. For a company with currently 598 employees, that is a significant expansion. Can be both positive or negative. More employees means higher costs but also may indicate the company’s confidence in the future."
"The company has announced an agreement for a clinical trial collaboration with RHHBY for using a combination with their anti-PD-L1 therapy. The PhII (n=75) is designed to evaluate TTFields together with atezolizumab, and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."
"Great to have removed uncertainty by pre-announcing excellent 4th qtr and year end results. Current reaction is from the speculators who were expecting more and ""sell"" on the news. This is a set up for a strong climb up after the short term speculators wash out. There is positive fundamental news which is what is driving this stock. Likely positive news from upcoming trials in various FDA stages because this technology works for all solid tumors. Doubling the expected life span will win approval from the FDA."
Up almost 5% AH. Very unusual when there's no news.
A pre-specified interim analysis concluded with a favourable recommendation to continue the LUNAR (pivotal in NSCLC) trial. The DSMB stated accrual of 534 patients is likely unnecessary and possibly unethical for the patients randomised to control arm and recommended a shortened trial.
So glad the Motley STOOL got me out early......
"Interesting that on bad days, there are often small after hour gains. Perhaps indicates continuing determination to acquire shares at a low level, while not arousing excitement among the investing public. Often these trades result in a final even dollar stock price.BMY announced positive results several days ago in a trial of two of their immunotherapy drugs on advanced melonoma.. The outcomes were modest, but this could be an area of possible collaboration with NVCR. There are very sizable October calls in BMY, so far not reflected in the stock movement. Probably wishful thinking that the calls might indicate some sort of bigger collaboration between the two companies."

Numbers weren't the best but owning this stock for me is not about the next few earnings cycles it's about the strong growth potential down the road as they get more approvals to treat other forms of cancer. I for one will take any price dip the next few days as an opportunity to pick up more shares. Good Luck everyone.
I'm not an MD or any kind of scientist but from what read of the Phase II trial result I thought it sounded promising. I mean the sample group was very small and was comprised if individuals with little to no hope at this point and yet it seemed to help some of them...yeah maybe the anticipated numbers weren't met (all though I got conflicting information on that from diff articles) they were still relatively good. I for one am pulling for this technology not only because I want my stock to do well but even more since it may someday be able to help me or a loved one enjoy those profits! I think the pullback is a healthy one and since I am in at sub 100 levels have started to accumulate some more because once the smoke settles and they report some other great news or earnings the stock will once again begin its march higher. I has done so in the past and will continue to so because this is going to be a major player in the treatment of cancer for a long time. IMHO ...Good luck all and happy 4th of July!

Going to be major tax selling in this name.
"Something for Corrine and the rest of you longs on this board to ponder. Classification of GBM changed which means the helmut is pretty much ineffective. Secondly please go and lookup an interview with your great Doctor Stupp on May 22nd of this year which coincided with a flash run up of your share price before the inevitable dumping started. In that interview he only talks about 2 year numbers because there is nothing past 2 years, and the most interesting part is he is now more interested in Vaccines plus CI combos to move the GBM needle forward. We all know that the only vaccine in combination with CI's is being performed at UCLA by the esteemed Dr Linda Liau. Corrine may make fun of NWBO but she is the biggest clown on this board as she has so obviously not looked into the true science of Novacure. The share price is headed one way and this is the very last time I will ever post on this board. Good luck to you all. All IMO obviously."
Lower low.
For a point of reference and my lens. 153 is the bottom of the channel. It is filling in the gap created from 130 to 197. Momentum investors have left and are leaving NVCR.

"I think this move down cleared/cleaned out lots of investors in NVCR. I have been here for 5-6 years. Normally on news like today we would have more reaction posted. To me this is a good sign. As this is how bottoms are formed. Normally tops and bottoms are a process. With NVCR it’s always an event, like today to move price significantly up or down. I always wondered if that gap at 128 would be filled. It did and was frustrating. We have some gaps to the upside now. Good luck to all."
"Ever since I have been in this stock the last 3 years it has made big runs up ,then down, then up...and I find just sitting tight for the long haul makes the most sense...having said that ...I have over the last 3 years sold some then bought back and have managed to do fairly well (which is rare for me!)..So sure do I wish I sold all my shares when it hit 232 and started buying back now OF COURSE but I also wish I could fly and that ain't happening either! My point...this company seems to have a good product for the treatment of Cancer which I am sure we all (those in the stock and not) hope does well since many of us or those we care about at some point may need it. From the reports I have read and comments from others my sense is they have something here and in time it will become a major player in the treatment of many cancers. It naturally will take time and during that journey this stock is going to continue be a roller coaster, the key is that we keep making higher highs and higher lows. I for one have been adding the last few days just chipping away getting some and will continue to do so...I hope we have hit bottom but if we go much lower I think this stock will become very very attractive to many more investors.. IMHO Good Luck"
"We are trading below March 2021 levels, even though the fundamentals have improved a lot since then in my opinion. The DMC recommendation in the non small cell lung cancer trial makes me very optimistic that the data will be positive. An approval in lung cancer will like 10x (?) or something the number of patients eligible for TTF. If the data is positive, it will also increase the chances of TTF being effective in the other indications. If it works in glioblastoma, mesothelioma and lung cancer, it's reasonable to assume that it will also work in ovarian, pancreatic and so on. It's the same mechanism of action everywhere."
"I ask myself, is this selling due to the soft results, fear of the efficacy of their technology, or bcse of the virus?OK, 20 bucks for the soft quarter, but the rest is bcse of the virus. The entire med tech grp got hit hard. So the question is not about NVCR, it's about hospital bed/operating room availability (you know the TX gov asked hospitals to curtail non-essential surgeries?).So just keep an eye on the hospitalization rates. When they bottom, buy more. I nibbled yesterday, but I also know the overall mkt could soften before the virus weakens, so maybe I'll get more at an even lower price. I am confident of a return to 200+ in 6-9 months, a 50% gain from here. (virus progression permitting)"
Hopefully bottom was hit and now we start to recover! Onward and upward...good luck all

"Novocure Announces 35 Presentations on Tumor Treating Fields at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting 2018The clinical and preclinical research to be presented includes the application of Tumor Treating Fields in seven cancer types ST. HELIER, Jersey--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Novocure (NASDAQ: NVCR) announced today 35 presentations on Tumor Treating Fields at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2018, April 14 through April 18, in Chicago. Tumor Treating Fields is a cancer therapy that uses electric fields tuned to specific frequencies to disrupt cell division, inhibiting tumor growth and causing affected cancer cells to die. The volume of Tumor Treating Fields presentations marks a record number of abstracts for Novocure at this conference. Of the 35 presentations, 18 are externally led research. The clinical and preclinical research to be presented includes the application of Tumor Treating Fields in seven cancer types, representing Novocure’s evolving pipeline and commitment to developing Tumor Treating Fields for a variety of solid tumors. “Over the past several years, the volume of presentations on Tumor Treating Fields at the AACR Annual Meeting has increased substantially, demonstrating what we believe to be an increased interest in Tumor Treating Fields from the scientific community,” said Dr. Eilon Kirson, Novocure’s Chief Science Officer and Head of Research and Development. “Tumor Treating Fields shows promise in multiple solid tumor types, and we are honored to have the opportunity to share our growing volume of research at a leading conference in cancer research.”"
Can it finish green? Maybe it'll be up $0.50 by days end.

Bought 200 last week. Have first hand knowledge of the effectiveness of Optune. Will add more later.
Wait has not been easy.Novocure now has two programs with breakthrough designations. Or is it three? Can’t remember but quite an accomplishment!
New All Time High every day. Amazing
"I'm the one who mentioned UPST earlier. I didn't buy it, but I see it is doing very well today. Shortly after you cited it, there was an analyst on tv who had it as his top pick and thought it still had a long way to run. I believe his new top pick was Generac, and he also liked Bombadier.Someone else said UPST might run into trouble if the 50 day moving average was breached.I'm retired and have besn focusing on income producers recently, without much success. In that vein I did recommend the following to my sister--MS preferred (MS.E), JEPI, SRLN, BP."

"Next years revenue boost comes from Zai Lab royalties for two products, meso new volume and Medicare payments. Plus hopefully continued growth in Glioblastoma. What I liked about the patent story today is it is now out to 2039! And anyone trying to replace them with their own tech has to run a phase three trial. Each improvement they make they file a patent and extend useful life. Gotta luv that moat.I am also in the buyout camp. Sure hope it comes someday. Would luv to make profits sheltered in a divi paying blue chip. My guess is once they get another trunk approval and ZAI makes progress on gastric ulcer in China this will be ripe. A buyer has to be able to acquire a piece of the growth path. The more phase 3 products get approved the more rev for company in DCF valuation. That should mean higher price paid by acquirer. I do get concerned about the sales to rev. Multiple. Pretty rich right now."

"imo, the selling was overdone yesterday. We all knew that non-essential med procedures get curtailed in these virus outbreaks. None of the anayysts reduced their Q2 est prior to the report, but it shd have been clear that there was going to be some softness. Plus, last yr, from pre-covid to the bottom, NVCR went from 90 to 60, a 30% drop. Now it has gone from 220 to 160, a drop greater than 30%. Maybe some market related selling yet to come, but I suspect NVCR establishes a bottom around where it is, and starts a climb back to 200, which I guess will take 4-6 months. I'll be adding, it's a 250 stock in 12-18 months."
Been in this for almost 3 years. anyone selling this will be missing out on the potential of all of the partnerships with big pharmaceuticals like keytruda with big incidence cancers. I can't see how this won't work for every solid tumor. better appliances and better targeting is in the future. plus this has to be one of the highest motes in medical treatment sphere.
"There is no way this is a buyout yet. Without Medicare Approval, I still see this stock at 85 by mid Sept and 100 end of year. Medicare would only make the stock even higher.

"from the frontiers in oncology story on omf.........oscillating magnetic field....mitochondrial respiratory chain.......so they say....but tubulin and hydrogen ion transport connection? :It has been shown that electromagnetic fields (EMF) produce anticancer effects in vitro (6, 7). We have conducted preclinical experiments with a new noninvasive wearable device known as an Oncomagnetic device that generates oscillating magnetic fields (OMF) by rotating strong permanent magnets (8, 9). The OMF generating components (oncoscillators) of the device can be attached to a helmet and treatment with the device does not require shaving the head. Using the oncoscillators of the device and specially devised patterns of magnet rotations we have produced strong selective anticancer effects in patient derived GBM and xenografted mouse models without causing adverse effects on cultured normal cells and normal mice (10–12). The mechanism of action of OMF differs from Optune and involves disruption of the electron transport in the mitochondrial respiratory chain causing elevation of reactive oxygen species and caspase-dependent cancer cell death (10–12).Here we report evidence of treatment response in the first patient to e"
