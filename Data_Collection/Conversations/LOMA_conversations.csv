"This needs to breakthrough the 7.90 level. It will do that, then it's off to $12.00"
Back in at 10.40
Why is nobody talking about this stock?
"If you only knew, could have sold last week at 13.40 and bought back today"
This is insane

Do u like this stock John?
Solid stock
Shall we .......... wait and see?
"Good company in the wrong country. By now, at least..."
This is appears to be a classic 7 weeks cup and handle. The bottom of the cup is around $5 and it closed after hours around $6.30. It will go down Tuesday AM to $6 or $5.75 but in turn expect it to rocket up to $8 Tuesday mid day or late afternoon. Great opportunity to #$%$ shares at the opening dip for $6 and watch them modestly get to $8 for your stop losses. Thoughts?
"this stock is going to groin a lot , Im in , take a look to the upgrades"

I wish I kept this but the double downgrade and bad publicity forced me to sell at a small loss a few weeks ago
Any idea what happened after hours?

"Argentine companies are subject to the decisions of the Argentine government. And the current Argentine government is hostile to private capital, sympathizes with the governments of Cuba and Venezuela and does not usually fulfill its commitments. A great company in a decaying country. Beware."
