This is appears to be a classic 7 weeks cup and handle. The bottom of the cup is around $5 and it closed after hours around $6.30. It will go down Tuesday AM to $6 or $5.75 but in turn expect it to rocket up to $8 Tuesday mid day or late afternoon. Great opportunity to #$%$ shares at the opening dip for $6 and watch them modestly get to $8 for your stop losses. Thoughts?

I wish I kept this but the double downgrade and bad publicity forced me to sell at a small loss a few weeks ago
LOMA reports today after the close and I wonder which way it's heading because I do NOT like what the share price has done over the past three months! Is it time to load up as it starts to climb or cut & run? I'm thinking -- get out!

"Argentine companies are subject to the decisions of the Argentine government. And the current Argentine government is hostile to private capital, sympathizes with the governments of Cuba and Venezuela and does not usually fulfill its commitments. A great company in a decaying country. Beware."

I sold happy to get back to break even but so disappointed because last week before the negative news came out I thought I had a real winner. To risky with the possibility of more negative news and downgrades .
Glad I bowed out beginning of week around $11.25....

Goose please take a look at my response.
LOMA issues a press release defending itself from the negative press articles about alleged cement price collusion. Stock will rebound tomorrow and the following days as it has been way oversold fundamentally and technicallyI will be buying tomorrow.
What happened Friday?!
