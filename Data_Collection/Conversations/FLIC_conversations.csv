"Time to short FLIC.....loan losses coming in my opinion, that could be BAD!"
9.8.21. Buying some FLIC this afternoon as it slips below its 1 year 200 SMA. Nice valuation and dividend yield!
The FLIC plane is starting to take off again! Up 17 cents to $21.43. Come on $22! 8/20/2021
FLIC is growing....looks like a great investment
Why the very low volume of shares traded of just 2200 in 90 minutes? Down 22 cents? Odd.
