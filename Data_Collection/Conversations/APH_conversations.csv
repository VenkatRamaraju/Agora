I wish I had invested a higher percentage of my portfolio to APH. this has been more the blue chip in my mix. It has been a rock and continues to grow.

Sad day. I've owned APH for a long time. I think this is the first quarterly earning miss I can recall in nearly a decade. The company has enjoyed a long record of success with a steady chart and shareholder return. Hopefully issues can be resolved and they will get back on track.

"Aphria (TSX:APHA)(NYSE:APHA) is a prime example. With a $3.3 billion market cap and only $37 million in sales last year, the stock looks wildly overvalued at nearly 100 times sales. However, forward-looking investors know that times are changing quickly.Last quarter, Aphria generated $74 million in sales. That’s a run rate of nearly $300 million, pegging shares are just 10 times sales. The company has plans to ultimately reach $1 billion in sales. If that goal is achieved, you’ll wish you’d bought shares today."
