APH might be a sleeper hit related to the 5G infrastructure build out that is just under way. This stock looks pretty interesting for the next 5-8 years.
I’m Hearing on Twitter $ACB is close to signing a deal with Altria $MO & $APH seemingly is going be left out in the cold. Also $ACB uplisting to the NYSE could come as early as tomorrow. /Position #PotStocks
Correction continue.
Buy the dip in APH because it always decline on great Qtr Earnings reports!*** And the bullish buying response is always delayed from none to 3 days — I say this from my experience of being long APH since Fall of 2014.
"Once this breaks $9, $APH.TO and $ACB.TO will seem cheap. Their beverage has Europe and North American exposure. Hard to talk about this company without “pumping”"

Few days ago I purchased APH on margin. This morning I got margin call. Is there anyone else who got a margin call on a positive balance?
I think for $APHA / $APH.TO we could see a bump EVEN IF the US doesn't gain new legalization https://medium.com/@charlieday_trader/marijuana-stocks-in-focus-as-u-s-voters-see-marijuana-on-ballots-61591d1dff9e
:) 300k divided into $CGC $APH and $ACB and not a fear :)
APH is the ultimate energizer bunny business!*** It just keeps delivering and delivering outstanding Qtr reports!
