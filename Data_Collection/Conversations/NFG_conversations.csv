Was reading about how Permian oil production being cut is actually bullish for dry gas producers as wet gas production is dropping bringing up dry gas prices.Should benefit NFG’s production of gas and pricing
Only thing going up is c e o paycheck
"we need a collapse of the oil price, massive bankruptcies in the oil fields, then a recovering world economy that will push the price of oil to 100 bucks, then slb will push thru to triple digits .... may take 2 years.... or some event in the middle east that rocks saudi oil production"

"Oppenheimer 'Why It Is A Buy'Jul. 29, 2019 3:58 PM ET|4 comments |About: Oppenheimer Holdings Inc. (OPY)SummaryRecord earnings out last week.New 5% stock buyback announced.Paying down 25% of their debt in one shot.They also raised their cash dividend.P/E under 8.July. 29, 2019by: Douglas HughesThe latest earnings release on Oppenheimer (NYSE: OPY) last week was very strong. We think we know Oppenheimer well, as I was the only shareholder at their last annual meeting and by following this firm for almost a decade, this was a strong quarter.The CEO better know as ""BUD"" has been there for over 40 years and is smart and prudent. In fact, he owns over 26% of the stock and always adds to his position, never sells any shares. I am certainly aware that the old culture, in which integrity and a customer-first attitude generally prevailed is long gone - not just at Oppenheimer, but on most of Wall Street.When I think about investing in any firm- especially a small investment bank, which is heavily regulated, leveraged, and difficult for anyone other than the board to analyze, I factor in everything I can to the companies culture and values. Regulation costs seem to be finally ending this is why I am so positive on this firm. The main view of the decay across the U.S. in the financial sector has already had us cut our intrinsic value for the sector- some more than others, but on Oppenheimer today I feel it is bone cheap. Of course, at some price, any firm or stock is a buy.With Oppenheimer stock trading $24- $34 the past 2 years, it has just bounced back up to around $29 on the latest earnings report and 25% just this month. Tangible book is now over $30 a share, we have been debating what to do today, after this huge run-up this month, so today op-ed is timely for many of us that follow OPY. But is this relevant to our investment process? We think yes for many reasons. 1) The argument that Oppenheimer is just buying back shares to help out long-time employees get a fair price for there shares today is just wrong.""BUD does what he wants and is prudent, ""BUD"" buys the shares back at a low price if he can, adding to the long-term value of the firm and hence this helps employees that own a bunch in the long run. Most employees average cost is well over $25 a share, so I doubt they would sell there shares this week. Many have waited 20 years for a payday not a few bucks.2) I highly doubt the son will take over the firm and ""BUD"" is 73 today, time to maybe retire. In fact, his son did not even attend the annual meeting this year. ""BUD"" has again been there over 40 years and in 2009 was a few days away from most likely going under. Today with the market at a high he will most likely sell, he will not miss this opportunity. The market is red hot for these type of firms this year and he can get top dollar maybe $55 a share or more.3) Just the fact that they are being so aggressive on the share repurchase even after the big-run up makes me think he wants the stock up to at least book value or 20% more than the tangible book or around $36 a share, so he can sell and get a great price today. It is also accretive to earnings, so why not buy it today heavy.4) Oppenheimer has been cutting lease costs, people, debt and regulatory costs are almost done, so the set up is perfect today for a sale.In summary, I am sure there are some disgruntled employees, especially some that just left and since ""BUD"" controls all of the votes, in the end, he can do whatever he wants. But his stake is huge now and while he pays himself well, he could make more money today just by investing the proceeds from a sale of his firm, than he does running it.Our final thought is simple Oppenheimer is trading at a P/E of under 8 that is dropping. Oppenheimer's income is at a record high today and it would be worth a substantial premium to tangible book value. I believe my investment thesis remains intact if not stronger after these results posted last week. So I am not selling any shares, in fact, adding more up to $30 a share today. Disclosure: I am/we are long OPY.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."

somebody doesn't like report
they can plot the future of nfg at the ritz in sarasota florida during the annual meeting that the shareholders pay for
Instead of screwing around with NY NJ and NE to secure pipeline permits NFG should explore the possibility of placing a gas line under Lake Erie from around Erie to Ontario. Canada would be interested in running a line down the Saint Lawrence valley to LNG facilities for export to Europe. Plus it would supply Canada's population centers. If NE wants gas they can be serviced from the North. NFG better act fast as Trump will support this the Democrats will block it. They will be hard put to block something if it bypasses them.
Who in God's name is running this company ?
is this stock tied to the price of nat gas?what has brought the price down so much?

NFG purchased all of Shell's natural gas interests in PA (which included 710Bcf of gas reserves) for 541 million in 2020 when price of natural gas was $2.00. Current price if natural gas is almost $6.00....You do the math.

I hope this doesn't correct from the DOW. I bought at the first correction this year at $50 and I would like to sell it at high 50's- $60 to get a profit. I'm guessing if the Dow falls below 23k then this will go below $50.

"NFG went ex dividend at the end of December 2019. It should be trading down as the next chance to buy to lock in thedividend is almost 3 months away. It seems to trade in a pattern going lower in the morning and rallying higher in the afternoon. The puts options prices indicate that there is risk of a continuing decline below $45. The risk with the company is that they will change assets buying more NG fields at too high a price and increasing debt. The company could also split up into a pure utility and a pipeline and exploration company. Below $45 it might be a buy in the morning and a sell in the afternoon to trade. A recession could reduce the income of the company and it would get hurt by lower sales and lower prices of NG. After the election we could have a recession. Also, if elections are unfavorable to NFG the stock will tank. Good short term trades possible with NFG."

General Gold Resources recently announced that they have received all drilling permits needed to commence their current Clark's Brook exploration program. The property is comprised of 31 claim units and is surrounded on 3 sides by $NFG. Gold is heating up again and this Newfoundland focused junior mining exploration company with a tiny mc of $13.34M will be one to watch. https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/84403/General-Gold-Resources-Fully-Permitted-for-Drilling-Mobilizes-Rigs-on-Clarks-Brook-Property-Newfoundland
