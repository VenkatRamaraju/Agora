"Looks good, Electric vehicles coming online will be using natural gas indirectly. Electric companies burn it to make electricity. Also usa is starting to export more LNG."
Was reading about how Permian oil production being cut is actually bullish for dry gas producers as wet gas production is dropping bringing up dry gas prices.Should benefit NFG’s production of gas and pricing
LETS GO $NFG
Hoping that with the rising price of NG that the price would trend up.Looking for activity in messages and most are months or years old.Good luck. rje123

"Oppenheimer 'Why It Is A Buy'Jul. 29, 2019 3:58 PM ET|4 comments |About: Oppenheimer Holdings Inc. (OPY)SummaryRecord earnings out last week.New 5% stock buyback announced.Paying down 25% of their debt in one shot.They also raised their cash dividend.P/E under 8.July. 29, 2019by: Douglas HughesThe latest earnings release on Oppenheimer (NYSE: OPY) last week was very strong. We think we know Oppenheimer well, as I was the only shareholder at their last annual meeting and by following this firm for almost a decade, this was a strong quarter.The CEO better know as ""BUD"" has been there for over 40 years and is smart and prudent. In fact, he owns over 26% of the stock and always adds to his position, never sells any shares. I am certainly aware that the old culture, in which integrity and a customer-first attitude generally prevailed is long gone - not just at Oppenheimer, but on most of Wall Street.When I think about investing in any firm- especially a small investment bank, which is heavily regulated, leveraged, and difficult for anyone other than the board to analyze, I factor in everything I can to the companies culture and values. Regulation costs seem to be finally ending this is why I am so positive on this firm. The main view of the decay across the U.S. in the financial sector has already had us cut our intrinsic value for the sector- some more than others, but on Oppenheimer today I feel it is bone cheap. Of course, at some price, any firm or stock is a buy.With Oppenheimer stock trading $24- $34 the past 2 years, it has just bounced back up to around $29 on the latest earnings report and 25% just this month. Tangible book is now over $30 a share, we have been debating what to do today, after this huge run-up this month, so today op-ed is timely for many of us that follow OPY. But is this relevant to our investment process? We think yes for many reasons. 1) The argument that Oppenheimer is just buying back shares to help out long-time employees get a fair price for there shares today is just wrong.""BUD does what he wants and is prudent, ""BUD"" buys the shares back at a low price if he can, adding to the long-term value of the firm and hence this helps employees that own a bunch in the long run. Most employees average cost is well over $25 a share, so I doubt they would sell there shares this week. Many have waited 20 years for a payday not a few bucks.2) I highly doubt the son will take over the firm and ""BUD"" is 73 today, time to maybe retire. In fact, his son did not even attend the annual meeting this year. ""BUD"" has again been there over 40 years and in 2009 was a few days away from most likely going under. Today with the market at a high he will most likely sell, he will not miss this opportunity. The market is red hot for these type of firms this year and he can get top dollar maybe $55 a share or more.3) Just the fact that they are being so aggressive on the share repurchase even after the big-run up makes me think he wants the stock up to at least book value or 20% more than the tangible book or around $36 a share, so he can sell and get a great price today. It is also accretive to earnings, so why not buy it today heavy.4) Oppenheimer has been cutting lease costs, people, debt and regulatory costs are almost done, so the set up is perfect today for a sale.In summary, I am sure there are some disgruntled employees, especially some that just left and since ""BUD"" controls all of the votes, in the end, he can do whatever he wants. But his stake is huge now and while he pays himself well, he could make more money today just by investing the proceeds from a sale of his firm, than he does running it.Our final thought is simple Oppenheimer is trading at a P/E of under 8 that is dropping. Oppenheimer's income is at a record high today and it would be worth a substantial premium to tangible book value. I believe my investment thesis remains intact if not stronger after these results posted last week. So I am not selling any shares, in fact, adding more up to $30 a share today.

Only thing going up is c e o paycheck
"Like most other companies who are enjoying this year's windfall corp tax decrease, NFG shareholders are not being rewarded with increased dividend payouts."

Thanks Cuomo you clown...NY is open for business...Don't think so
Great divy stock buy buy buy
Looking forward to seeing what happens with new pipeline coming online towards end of 2021. Allows access to premium pricing.
It’s time to put the “For Sale” sign up on this dog!
should be another great day for $NFG let's go
NFG purchased all of Shell's natural gas interests in PA (which included 710Bcf of gas reserves) for 541 million in 2020 when price of natural gas was $2.00. Current price if natural gas is almost $6.00....You do the math.
"NFG went ex dividend at the end of December 2019. It should be trading down as the next chance to buy to lock in thedividend is almost 3 months away. It seems to trade in a pattern going lower in the morning and rallying higher in the afternoon. The puts options prices indicate that there is risk of a continuing decline below $45. The risk with the company is that they will change assets buying more NG fields at too high a price and increasing debt. The company could also split up into a pure utility and a pipeline and exploration company. Below $45 it might be a buy in the morning and a sell in the afternoon to trade. A recession could reduce the income of the company and it would get hurt by lower sales and lower prices of NG. After the election we could have a recession. Also, if elections are unfavorable to NFG the stock will tank. Good short term trades possible with NFG."
"This Natural Gas company is ripe to merge into a better run company. The oil and gas exploration company should be monetized and sold to a oil company, it just doesn’t make sense to hold and run ineffective"
