GOOGL go's instantly green at open and look for a a big day....
"This week learned us that Google is not Snap, nor is it Apple, Amazon, Facebook, ...Google (Alphabet) is Google, navigating its own course with an endless amount of assets (to name a few: Google, Youtube, Music, AI, cloud, Waymo, SpaceX shares, ...).Waymo alone has the potential to become the ""Android"" of the selfdriving market.Let's see what the future brings to Google and what Google brings to the future..."
Terrific financial results for Q3. Shows the Apple privacy isn't hurting Google at all. I am a performance marketing manager and I'm a huge believer in the workarounds Google have on user privacy.
GOOG is no FB...It doesn't control the speech of billions like FB so any anti-trust issues should be handled well by it's excellent legal team. No fears!
"So meta. FB should have rebranded as ""Numbers"". BTW, how are those Ray Bans doing?"
The world needs GOOG...search engine that is...it has no peers!
GOOG is catching its breathe from yesterday.....$3000+ coming very very soon....
Sundar Pinchai is a great under-the-radar CEO..the results speak for themselves
FB surged AH yesterday after earnings... Today down 3.9%Google down 3% AH after earnings...tomorrow up 5% eheheheh
Great CEO Sundar Pinchaihardly gets any recognition on this board. He's a phenomenally successfully CEO as today attested.
lets see..i'm up 300 percent in 2 years...people crying cause its down 1.5 percent..lolol...it will be green tomorrow..
"Highest target $3660===no downgrades, all upgrades,...Aggressively buy any weakness!Monness Crespi analyst Brian White raised the firm's price target on Alphabet to $3,660 from $3,500 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The company's Q3 results were ""enviable,"" with the company managing to sidestep the digital ad pitfalls experienced by leading social media platforms, White tells investors in a research note. While the analyst believes Alphabet is well-positioned to capitalize on the strong secular trend to digital advertising and experience further momentum in the cloud, he expects that the digital ad market will remain volatile in the near-term and antitrust investigations will carry on."
"Robert, in addition to your Netlist investment, I hope you purchased some shares of GOOG/GOOGL. I own both, so should you. GLTA"
"Giants, Michael, and other Netlist posters who bash Google daily - learn to appreciate Google and its success. Without that tremendous Google success, the netlist case would have little potential value. Google is a multi-faceted juggernaut. Netlist contentions are only a small component part of what has built Google's huge revenues sources business model."
anyone see any analysis of how Apples privacy policy will effect earnings?
Can`t believe how lucky I was to have bought in Oct. 2020 at around 1100.......companies this size just do not double in a year`s time. Here to stay
"Next week will see us cross the magic threshold of 3,000.....a moment for celebration indeed!"
"$3,000. coming up fast. Finally...."
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported quarterly earnings of $27.99 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $23.47 by 19.26 percent. This is a 70.67 percent increase over earnings of $16.40 per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $65.12 billion which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $63.45 billion by 2.63 percent. This is a 41.03 percent increase over sales of $46.17 billion the same period last year.
Should see at least $50+ today....25% increases in PT's across the board from all the major brokerages...
"Sell Amazon, BUY GOOGL. The best company on the planet"
Googl…. My god. Beats by almost $2b in revenues. EPS $27.99 versus estimates of $23.46. What a blow out. Down $15-$16 but the results were amazing.
"Alphabet (GOOGL) PT Raised to $3,300 at JMP Securities"
"Alphabet (GOOG) PT Raised to $3,500 at Oppenheimer"
"From TD Ameritrade News Stream, published 10/22/21 07:03PM:Earnings: Analysts on average expect Google to report earnings of 23.73 a share, up from 16.40 a share a year ago. They were expecting 20.05 a share at the end of June.Above is quoted verbatim from Jon Swarts on the TD Ameritrade News Feed. TD Ameritrade is awesome and I'd suggest anyone use it as their trading platform and news source! Unquoted Commentary:Further reading suggests Google will not be hit hard by Apple's privacy settings. As Google has made adjustments and uses a different technology than Snap. Possible headwinds to consider are a potential for lackluster holiday spending and potential anti-trust issues pushed by the US Senate. Where Google has already, willingly decreased app store cost to developers making its digital store more accessible to developers.Thank you TD Ameritrade and Jon Swartz for the awesome write up heading into earnings next week!"
"Given all the supply chain problems, $googl and $msft did well"
ALPHABET earning crush estimates but the stock falls.
lets take a ride to 3k who’s in ?
So is FAANG stocks called MAANG now?
GOOG: mega and growth: great combo!
Jefferies raised its PT on Alphabet (GOOGL) to $3500
"IBD said Googl buy point is 2925.17. So it is past that, Yay for us! I'm hoping for all of us it soars from here."
"I like this ER and not interested in AH reaction. The comments and the tone are positives. Frankly that is a nice surprise, and appreciate these strong numbers, especially after a less upbeat ER from Facebook. « Sales from the company’s cloud division rose to $4.99 billion, missing Wall Street expectations of $5.04 billion. While the unit has gained some market share under Thomas Kurian, it still lags far behind leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp.“It was modestly off of the street’s estimate, but we feel very good with the momentum,” Porat said on a call with reporters. “We are very pleased with the ongoing progress across the board, the product innovation, the buildout of our teams and the strength across verticals.”Alphabet also repurchased $12.6 billion in shares last quarter, and said it had added nearly 18,000 full-time staff during the period, up to 150,028. »"
This is a must own stock for the next decade. The only mistake I made in buying stock was that I did not buy more!
GOOG is worth $3500 per share.
"I've been constantly surprised at how GOOG seems to be ignored by talking heads and the so-called analysts in the mainstream media (including Bloomberg, which I regret subscribing to this year). It seems those people have a hard time understanding the persistent monetization power of a transformative, scalable business model. On top of that, they are pretty much at a loss about a firm not producing tangible goods but influencing people's daily lives with free apps.Congrats to wise, long-term investors who know that the 2nd wave of digital transformation (i.e., AI on the edge) is just beginning."
Literally the only people bearish on this are q anon or delusional
Classic sell the news.... $2850 by end of next week...
"Ignore Mr. Market. Great quarter, great company. The perfect long term hold."
Unfortunately I didn’t buy GOOG earlier this year. Is it too late to buy now?? Is the stock price likely to increase significantly over the next 1-2 years?
"GOOGLE is the greatest company and the best stock! It literally takes place of AAPL, FB and AMZN!"
whomever sold puts and calls on any strike price making money
"They will most likely provide an update on Waymo in their conference call next week, the company has the potential to become the first and major robotaxi operator in the US (this is HUGE), IMHO"
"Holy smokes, PT increases across the board with buy ratings everywhere. Ready to continue this climb after running flat for a while."
"Same thing with NFLX. It'll spike, give it a day or so."
They smashed earnings. stock still down. classic buy the rumour sell the news.
Reasons the stock price could be down in the near future.1) Next Years earnings year over year will be tough.2) This quarter had a one time gain without which I believe sales and earnings would be down Q2 to Q3 sequentially.3) Cloud business still is not profitable.Reasons the stock price could go up in the near future1) Margins are improving.2) Stock valuations are not outrageous and if they can keep growing make it a good buy3) Long term the stock would seem to be a great buy and hold .4) They really did crush earnings....
Google posted its highest sales growth in more than a decade and nearly doubled its profit in Q3 
$3000+ after ER next week. Not even sure why it's down since they are actually taking market shares from IOS. Big run up next week or eod.
"Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOG) on Tuesday beat expectations for third-quarter revenue, a positive sign that its advertising business is overcoming new limits on tracking mobile users and sending its shares up slightly.Take that up the clacker, Tim Cook..."
"If supply chain issues are *allegedly* supposed to plague Google going forward, why was UPS and Ebay up so much on Friday? And why didn't other companies who produce physical goods drop as well? I'm starting to think this was just FUD being spread by the financial news complex to scare us out of our shares and calls."
"10-year yield dropping, helps Google stock price. "
"THESE BIG CONCERNS BELOW IS NOT INTERESTED BY BIG WHALE INVESTORS....YouTube advertising revenue: $7.20 billion vs. $7.4 billion expected.Google Cloud revenue: $4.99 billion vs. $5.07 billion expected.the cloud revenue 's gonna be downhill soon as more and more people get outdoor and works, no more cloud computing needed as much when they 's at home all the time....students are back to school , needless of those cloud datas....Utube has been impacted heavily as well by subscribers withdrawing gradually as they heading outdoor activity, recreation and less at home viewer, not interested as due busy at work....utube viewer downhill with its revenue.... Sell....sell tomorrow is best...."
Even after the AH pullback Alphabet stock is worth more than it was Monday. For the first time trailing twelve months earning per share exceeds $100. Tomorrow look forward to increased price targets.
3000 by friday. . and thats conservative Cramer said best tech stock out there
DIP BUYING THE CALLS WAS EASY MONEY AS ALWAYS
"The stock consolidated from mid Aug to mid November....technicals are now all aligned for an extended run into low $3000's... most likely $3200 before consolidating again....big, big problem here for shorts..MACD / RSI with plenty of room to the upside....today's move has pushed the MACD just over the zero line and the RSI is only sitting at 61 ...and that is with today's action....the pps has broken above the 50 day MA for the first time in almost a month ..all very bullish...look for a follow on day tomorrow of another 2%-3% and a break and hold over $3000 by Thanksgiving....it's all good"
"Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) reported third-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations as the technology giant saw a resurgence in its search business with travel activity ramping back up. Here are the main metrics from Alphabet's report, compared to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg:Revenue, ex-TAC [minus traffic acquisition costs]: $53.62 billion vs. $52.62 billion expected, $38.01 billion Y/Y Earnings per share: $27.99 vs. $23.50 expected"
GOOG in new alliance with Intel to produce chips.
"According to Ruth the apple.changes won't have a significant impact since google been working on that for a while in advance.Google services and cloud will be the area of focus in Q4, bigger than usual expenses in capex mainly for servers and infrastructure.As for the Google play fee cut won't have meaningfull impact.One thing that caught my attention was the expected ramp up in hardware sales (Fitbit and pixel 6 phone mainly)and YouTube subscriptions for Q4(Xmas)"
"Looks like GOOGL is the best pick among FAAMG. It's the cheapest with a forward PE of only 26, not to mention that Waymo is about to come online. Not surprised to see 3000 very soon. JMHO"
This will crack $2800 imho. Like Facebook surged in and yesterday and tanked during regular trading. Gooogl will do the exact opposite
Since the fundamentals have improved the sp will follow soon. I expect the sp to be $3000 in two to three weeks...
"so facebook was down due to Apple privacy policy fear, Apple privacy policy didn't impact earnings and stocks anyway went down. Google not only didn't feel any pain because of new apple policy, but smashes every prediction and anyway is going down. what type of handicap has Mr Market?"
Green in the AM
"Great numbers, the price will follow, just buy and hold forever."
Why down today?
"""Do not confuse the after-hours action following the earnings report for something that it is not. Alphabet delivered a beat that simply may not have been big enough with the stock already up 60% year to date and trading nearly 5% away from its all-time high. Alphabet still has a very bright future ahead with continued growth from YouTube, Google Cloud, and digital shopping experiences leading the way."""
"NASDAQ futures swung from positive to negative. Could be the proposed 15% minimum tax on our most successful corporations had an impact. If implemented, stock prices for these companies will go down and more than 1/2 of the people who own stocks will take a hit. Good news for the Democrats, they'll have more money, they've taken from us, to spend on government programs."

"Now that all FAANG stocks have reported, it appears GOOG is the safest to own of the group. Also wise to own Microsoft and Tesla. JMHO"
Patience rewards investors in a mega company like GOOG. Just wait to see where it will be at year's end.
Amazon & Apple badly missing should be a strong indicator of just how great Google’s quarter was.
"Gene Munster said on CNBC that AAPL’s new policy will hurt FB, TWTR, and SNAP but not GOOGL."
"Alphabet (GOOGL) PT Raised to $3,450 at Credit Suisse"
Great buying opportunity.
"When I bought at $890, Google was the analysts least favored FAANG. At $1,300s and $1,400s, same story. Now everyone wants to own. Looking forward to whenever we surpass $3,000 and never look back."
"Determined to be $4000 by 2022, Load up big time."
Was waiting for it to drop below 2500 to buy more- looks like that won’t happen now-
Nobody becomes a millionaire or a billionaire by working for others and depending on them. Good investment brings millions of dollars and consistency bring billions; the market is all about bitcoin at the moment.
