"I like this ER and not interested in AH reaction. The comments and the tone are positives. Frankly that is a nice surprise, and appreciate these strong numbers, especially after a less upbeat ER from Facebook. « Sales from the company’s cloud division rose to $4.99 billion, missing Wall Street expectations of $5.04 billion. While the unit has gained some market share under Thomas Kurian, it still lags far behind leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp.“It was modestly off of the street’s estimate, but we feel very good with the momentum,” Porat said on a call with reporters. “We are very pleased with the ongoing progress across the board, the product innovation, the buildout of our teams and the strength across verticals.”Alphabet also repurchased $12.6 billion in shares last quarter, and said it had added nearly 18,000 full-time staff during the period, up to 150,028. »"
"Looks like GOOGL is the best pick among FAAMG. It's the cheapest with a forward PE of only 26, not to mention that Waymo is about to come online. Not surprised to see 3000 very soon. JMHO"
"I've been constantly surprised at how GOOG seems to be ignored by talking heads and the so-called analysts in the mainstream media (including Bloomberg, which I regret subscribing to this year). It seems those people have a hard time understanding the persistent monetization power of a transformative, scalable business model. On top of that, they are pretty much at a loss about a firm not producing tangible goods but influencing people's daily lives with free apps.Congrats to wise, long-term investors who know that the 2nd wave of digital transformation (i.e., AI on the edge) is just beginning."
"This week learned us that Google is not Snap, nor is it Apple, Amazon, Facebook, ...Google (Alphabet) is Google, navigating its own course with an endless amount of assets (to name a few: Google, Youtube, Music, AI, cloud, Waymo, SpaceX shares, ...).Waymo alone has the potential to become the ""Android"" of the selfdriving market.Let's see what the future brings to Google and what Google brings to the future..."
GOOG is catching its breathe from yesterday.....$3000+ coming very very soon....
"Alphabet (GOOGL) PT Raised to $3,450 at Credit Suisse"
Unfortunately I didn’t buy GOOG earlier this year. Is it too late to buy now?? Is the stock price likely to increase significantly over the next 1-2 years?
"""Do not confuse the after-hours action following the earnings report for something that it is not. Alphabet delivered a beat that simply may not have been big enough with the stock already up 60% year to date and trading nearly 5% away from its all-time high. Alphabet still has a very bright future ahead with continued growth from YouTube, Google Cloud, and digital shopping experiences leading the way."""
"Sell Amazon, BUY GOOGL. The best company on the planet"
Terrific financial results for Q3. Shows the Apple privacy isn't hurting Google at all. I am a performance marketing manager and I'm a huge believer in the workarounds Google have on user privacy.
"Giants, Michael, and other Netlist posters who bash Google daily - learn to appreciate Google and its success. Without that tremendous Google success, the netlist case would have little potential value. Google is a multi-faceted juggernaut. Netlist contentions are only a small component part of what has built Google's huge revenues sources business model."
"I remember how back in 2004 I missed the $85 offering price. I then refused to buy GOOGL a week later since it price has climbed to a tad over a rich $100. ""Too expensive"" I thought. Should'a, would'a, could'a loaded up back then. Ha ha."
So is FAANG stocks called MAANG now?
"Next week will surely be our week to hit the milestone of 3,000 with a century of growth ahead."
"Now that all FAANG stocks have reported, it appears GOOG is the safest to own of the group. Also wise to own Microsoft and Tesla. JMHO"

"When I bought at $890, Google was the analysts least favored FAANG. At $1,300s and $1,400s, same story. Now everyone wants to own. Looking forward to whenever we surpass $3,000 and never look back."
"IBD said Googl buy point is 2925.17. So it is past that, Yay for us! I'm hoping for all of us it soars from here."
"While FB gets lost in the metaverse, i hope Google can keep improving on real life applications like Search, Maps, Travel, AI, Youtube, Waymo, Android(I am also FB long btw)"
