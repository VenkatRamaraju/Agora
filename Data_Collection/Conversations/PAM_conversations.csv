It seems like this stock has about a +/- 50 cent swing on most days. Would about $10.70 to $11.50 be a good entry point for short term profits you think? I'm just starting to consider PAM for daytrading but don't have a position yet...thanks for your thoughts...

"This is such a great company, fully integrated energy production: electricity (production and distribution), oil, gas.Of course the Argentine risk is significant but it is still hard to see it's so undervalued."
"seems that anyone shorting this stk is late to the party! when the political/economic environmental stabilizes, charts & fundamentals suggest a strong boomerang of the price. definitely in the buy/accumulate range right now. timeframe?? - r u willing to hold up to 6 months to c it happen?"

"I read in the Buenos Aires times, that the Argentina government creates a stable environment to enhance the unused huge potential of the Vaca Muerta (gas- and oil fields). See the link. https://batimes.com.ar/news/economy/government-mulling-oil-price-controls-to-tap-vaca-muerta-says-kulfas.phtmlThis and other positive steps can give a stable investment case for Pampa as well.Even the highly stupid Peronist government has to follow the way of the rationality."

"Super results from the second quarter of 2021. We will have a PE of 3 in the end of the year if the price of the stock does not change. Debts are lower, share buybacks are on the way, profit is much higher, growth of the income is big. We need only rid of the peronists and this stock will fly. We have a growth stock with PE 3, with super management unbelievable."
"From what I can tell, PAM’s true EPS is about $1.50. That gives it a P/E of about 9. Comparable companies seem to have a P/E of about 20. I bought this stock a year ago. It is down slightly since then. But I’m going to hold it for another year. I’m thinking that it is worth at least $20."
Some stocks are under owned. Its ok.
"Read the balance sheet and income statement. They are in ARS. Yahoo mixed ARS and USD values when calculating PE. Just ignore that number and look to the future EPS and PEG calculating after you translate ARS in to USD. If you do not convert Argentine peso in to US dollar on the income statement, the income appears roughly 50X greater than it really is. It is a failure by Yahoo of mixing data when looking at the trailing PE, just ignore that."
