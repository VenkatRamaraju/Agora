"seems that anyone shorting this stk is late to the party! when the political/economic environmental stabilizes, charts & fundamentals suggest a strong boomerang of the price. definitely in the buy/accumulate range right now. timeframe?? - r u willing to hold up to 6 months to c it happen?"
"This is such a great company, fully integrated energy production: electricity (production and distribution), oil, gas.Of course the Argentine risk is significant but it is still hard to see it's so undervalued."

It seems like this stock has about a +/- 50 cent swing on most days. Would about $10.70 to $11.50 be a good entry point for short term profits you think? I'm just starting to consider PAM for daytrading but don't have a position yet...thanks for your thoughts...
Here because the ew export contracts start now and with Brazil hydropower reduced nat gas exports with noninteruptabke provisions also start after the law passed 2 weeks ago. Expect soy prices to stay elevated and hard currency priced exports to continue increasing balance of payments in Argentina’s favor. If wondering here is the break down on first export contracts while oil exports for sweet crude also increase (most in demand type of oil) https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2238876-argentina-gears-up-for-gas-exports-to-chile-brazil

"Great news from yesterday. The company bought back lot of stocks in the last quarter. https://ri.pampaenergia.com/en/corporate-governance/ownership-breakdown/ They bought back 14% of the stocks for bargain prices. It means every stockholder will have 14% increase in revenue in this quarter if the revenue of the company does not increase. But this stock is a growth stock currently. This means that the current PE can decrease with 20% only in this quarter. If the peronists will suck in november, in this case the Argentina stock market will get a new rebound. After that the IMF agreement will make the second rebound in january. I expect a price doubling till end of 2022."
Are the increasing revenues from previous year due to inflation of the peso or from increased production??

"Read the balance sheet and income statement. They are in ARS. Yahoo mixed ARS and USD values when calculating PE. Just ignore that number and look to the future EPS and PEG calculating after you translate ARS in to USD. If you do not convert Argentine peso in to US dollar on the income statement, the income appears roughly 50X greater than it really is. It is a failure by Yahoo of mixing data when looking at the trailing PE, just ignore that."
"Super results from the second quarter of 2021. We will have a PE of 3 in the end of the year if the price of the stock does not change. Debts are lower, share buybacks are on the way, profit is much higher, growth of the income is big. We need only rid of the peronists and this stock will fly. We have a growth stock with PE 3, with super management unbelievable."
PAM is up 7.65% to 33.22
"From what I can tell, PAM’s true EPS is about $1.50. That gives it a P/E of about 9. Comparable companies seem to have a P/E of about 20. I bought this stock a year ago. It is down slightly since then. But I’m going to hold it for another year. I’m thinking that it is worth at least $20."
