Here because the ew export contracts start now and with Brazil hydropower reduced nat gas exports with noninteruptabke provisions also start after the law passed 2 weeks ago. Expect soy prices to stay elevated and hard currency priced exports to continue increasing balance of payments in Argentina’s favor. If wondering here is the break down on first export contracts while oil exports for sweet crude also increase (most in demand type of oil) https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2238876-argentina-gears-up-for-gas-exports-to-chile-brazil
"I read in the Buenos Aires times, that the Argentina government creates a stable environment to enhance the unused huge potential of the Vaca Muerta (gas- and oil fields). See the link. https://batimes.com.ar/news/economy/government-mulling-oil-price-controls-to-tap-vaca-muerta-says-kulfas.phtmlThis and other positive steps can give a stable investment case for Pampa as well.Even the highly stupid Peronist government has to follow the way of the rationality."

"Super results from the second quarter of 2021. We will have a PE of 3 in the end of the year if the price of the stock does not change. Debts are lower, share buybacks are on the way, profit is much higher, growth of the income is big. We need only rid of the peronists and this stock will fly. We have a growth stock with PE 3, with super management unbelievable."

"Read the balance sheet and income statement. They are in ARS. Yahoo mixed ARS and USD values when calculating PE. Just ignore that number and look to the future EPS and PEG calculating after you translate ARS in to USD. If you do not convert Argentine peso in to US dollar on the income statement, the income appears roughly 50X greater than it really is. It is a failure by Yahoo of mixing data when looking at the trailing PE, just ignore that."
Is the loss today related to Mindlin was called by Stornelli (Judge) for the bribes to the prior government?

"Great news from yesterday. The company bought back lot of stocks in the last quarter. https://ri.pampaenergia.com/en/corporate-governance/ownership-breakdown/ They bought back 14% of the stocks for bargain prices. It means every stockholder will have 14% increase in revenue in this quarter if the revenue of the company does not increase. But this stock is a growth stock currently. This means that the current PE can decrease with 20% only in this quarter. If the peronists will suck in november, in this case the Argentina stock market will get a new rebound. After that the IMF agreement will make the second rebound in january. I expect a price doubling till end of 2022."

"From what I can tell, PAM’s true EPS is about $1.50. That gives it a P/E of about 9. Comparable companies seem to have a P/E of about 20. I bought this stock a year ago. It is down slightly since then. But I’m going to hold it for another year. I’m thinking that it is worth at least $20."
Is there anyone here who's not a spammer?If so the chart looks amazing.. why? Can someone give me better information? Thanks!

It seems like this stock has about a +/- 50 cent swing on most days. Would about $10.70 to $11.50 be a good entry point for short term profits you think? I'm just starting to consider PAM for daytrading but don't have a position yet...thanks for your thoughts...
