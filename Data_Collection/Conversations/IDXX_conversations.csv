What would it take for the IDEXx stock to split again?
Why is it dropping 8% like a rock in after hrs trading?
Very good quarter but the stock was down like a lot of others so we added to our position! They are creating a wide moat in their sector which is always a good thing!
"I'm ALL IN IDXX now, so I can't buy any more. But if weren't in it, this would be a great entry point. Right now at $554!!"
IDEXX Laboratories reached an all time high at 535.00

"This stocks a monster!! When is split? I dont own any of this , but wow, wish I did!!"
"$ZOM is going to be TESLA of pet care industry. $ZOM point of care device “TRUFORMA” is %20 more effective and efficient than it’s competitor $IDXX device, it’s current SP is @ $550. Although IDXX is a big company and serves more areas BUT $ZOM is relatively a new company and very innovative and revolutionary so this has a lot of room for growth and potential in increasing its share price. Zomedica has around 45 patents approved on this device so that shows the innovation. GLTA"
been watching for weakness still searching
Why the big drop today?
IDXX is down -4.95% to 232.80
Next #IDXX (mkt cap 44B)
Any chance for a split since the stock prices has doubled in the past year?
IDXX is down 7.53% to $196.15

Paperwork is online.The CEO has taken 3 previous companies from .30 to over $8 in his career. This is not his first rodeo."
Stock split incoming ?
such a good company but no love like the big names :(
Get on the Lexagene train! About to start sellling to vets in September and disrupt the market. Results in 1 hour with antibiotic resistance testing also. The final product design for the new MiQLab pathogen detection device was revealed this week and sales reps were hired. A bonus is that an FDA EUA for Covid19 detection will also be applied for in September.

Zomedica has around 45 patents approved on this device so that shows the innovation.Their new CEO Robert Cohen turned 3 companies from a 0.30 cent stock to $8, and it was already predicted before his appointment that $ZOM would become an at least $3 stock.YESTERDAY they applied for a Trademark for MYTRUEFORMA. Paperwork is online.TODAY a new Truforma webpage is up on their site, also pictures of packaging, and pre-orders are being placed at the moment. PR news could drop soon and help $ZOM reach new highs. This information has yet to catch up with the rest of the market.Realistic bottom right now (before any news hits) is 0.68-0.70 in my opinion, and I believe if you manage to buy around that price you should expect decent profits in the Medium to Long Term."
Huge Sell on the News. Suspect stock to recover from this quickly ! I love IDXX
"IDXX is a great company, but at $45B market company its going to be hard for anyone investing now to get wealthy off this. Take a look at LexaGene (LXXGF). Its a sub $100M company that has revolutionary technology. Its MiQLab System can do 1 hour PCR and is in a trial run at U Penn Vet School. A large pharma just bought a system so it can detect pathogens in its bioreactors making biologics. Plus, FDA EUA for Covid19 testing anticipated in Jan 2021. Get in now and you could make generational wealth off this company."
IDEXX is going to buy Zomedica before Truforma launch.
Sell this till 140$ till PE ratio levels out!
How is IDEXX positioned to outcompete competitors? I really like this company but I’m just being cautious as there are other small companies like Lexagene LXG that seem to have a pretty solid game plan. Just looking for people to give me s reason to hold off investing even more in IDEXX.
Why is IDXX up 7 this morning?
Idexx is headed for two hundred. Do not sell it on downturns. It seems to overcome them every time and move into higher highs.
"OMG, This stock destroys it."
Wishing a speedy recovery to John Ayers.
"I believe cats and dogs are our future, teach them and let them lead the way. Show them all the beauty they possess inside. Give them a sense of pride to make it easier..."
IDEXX Laboratories is down 5.52% to 236.10
What other healthcare stocks do you own besides IDXX?
Both ABAX (2 billion) and HSKA (750 million) are small potatoes compared to IDXX. Even combined they pose little threat. This IDXX reaction is way overdone. Should be over 200 shortly.
"Motley pump in effect.....it should be a crime to load up on the stock at 11am, then send emails out telling all your readers to buy it right after that. But nope, they make their money easy peezy."
Big earnings beat. Down big with no explanation. Great unexpected buying opportunity. I'm in.
it would be nice if idxx was discussed in this conversation instead all I read is zom pumpers
"Is this a buying opportunity or selling. I'm up 105% and don't want to be ""Hoggish"". Thoughts."
Down 100 in the last month?
Idex Labs is headed for 300
Institutions hold almost all the float so it's very volatile. I like the growth and the secular trend of people treating pets like members of the family. Valuation is a bit rich but there is a long term growth trajectory.
"Bear mkts start with panic selling of ‘everything!’ Throw the baby out with the bath water! Sell my winners to cover my losses! At some point logic returns and areas like healthcare and biotech that are not economically correlated will start outperforming. Big pharma is already doing it (eg. J&J, NVS, PFE, MRK) and even some of the bio’s are beginning to find support. Despite its multiple, even genetic heavyweight, ILMN acts pretty well. If you look at how recent IPO GH has acted, imagine what bigger Grail will do (partially spun out of ILMN) when it’S IPO arrives."
This will be a top performer over the next five years. A stock GOD in the making.
what happened today?
IDXX is down 4.94% to $191.42
ZOM to the moon get in before March 31!
"Elanco has an unfavorable market situation which is why someone trying to lowball the company with mini-tender lower than market value. IDXX is in same market, just wonder if the stock price can sustain the same level of PE"
$ZOM new device “TRUFORMA” and it’s competitor is $IDXX. “TRUFORMA” is 20 times faster and efficient in the diagnosis of pets.
TNXP approval
"Neither buy nor sell. Unique position in a growing franchise that they dominate. Stock overpriced by traditional standards, but always has been. Always beats on earnings, then sells off. Market exacerbated today’s move. If you own it just hang on and don’t get caught up in the day to day."
$1.5 BILLION DEBT ( BOOK VALUE $0.61 = ANOTHER BIG FRAUD LIKE VALEANT (VRX) SEE YOU AT $10 SOON
IDXX reached a 52 Week low at 178.28
I'm hearing $zom might be bought out by idexx??
IDEXX Laboratories reached an all time high at 356.67
what did I miss? What is up?????
IDXX reached a new All Time High at 209.28
Great earnings - stock is down. Wish NASDAQ would settle down and start making rational moves.
one of the greatest ever stocks. still a long way to run. revenue potential is over $30bn by 2040 according to investor day
$ZOM point of care device “TRUFORMA” is 20 times more effective and efficient than it’s competitor $IDXX (SP @ $550) device. Although IDXX aid a big company and serves more areas leveraging $ZOM relatively a new company has a lot of room for growth and potential increase in its SP.
Why does this ‘always’ beat on the numbers and then immediately sell off?
"Hello there, I am really happy with the past performance of IDXX. I'm sure the growth will continue and we will participate by higher PPS.After screening the whole sector, I found a small(er) competitor called Heska Corporation. https://ir.heska.comThey are gaining market share and are less expensive. Look at their presentation. I build an additional position there in case they will grow more (I did it also for CSCO with ANET).Best,Matthias"
If $IDXX is like $TSLA then $ZOM may become like $NIO.
High volatility. Down over $7 today after several recent buy recommendations.
do you think that we will buy lexagene
"Yes, this is the stock to own."
IDXX reached a new All Time High at 190.68
IDXX is up 5.00% to 205.57

New historical high.
"FYI for the board.The Motley Fool has a buy rating on this stock. They issued it in July 2014. The Motley Fool has something like 700,000 subscribers, so when they make a buy/sell rating, they can move the markets. Especially if the stock is smaller. The Fools reasoning for the buy rating is basically this: pets are increasingly popular. Since IDEXX sells diagnostic equipment and consumables to veterinarians, they should benefit from increasing consumer trends. The fool puts the pet diagnostic market's size at 30 Billion. With Idexx's annual revenue of 2.5 Billion, they argue the stock has room to move.

"$ZOM $IDXX Do I think the market will see further corrections? Most likely. Do I think ZOM will pull through regardless? Not just yes, but a RESOUNDING yes! Positive sales and new product info are going to bring us to new highs well within the year. Patience is the name of the game here people, and our new CEO knows what he is doing. We just got Miller distribution, a larger global accounting firm, and one of Zomedica's SEVERAL game changing products is finally about to release! Personally I will continue to buy any dips, and I think it's a poor time to sell. Things will rebound fast."
$ZOM is the next IDEXX
IDEXX Laboratories is down 5.04% to 385.85
IDEXX Laboratories reached an all time high at 306.34
$ZOM will one day be like $IDXX when they add more products/platforms..
"Yes, this is the way."
IDXX reached a new All Time High at 232.93
"Oh wow, 5% drop, I'm so scared...."
IDXX reached a new All Time High at 255.07
"this always happens, will run up into ever quarter, sell off on great report, hang in there and keep this great winner, as the trajectory keeps heading here for the long term."
all time high?
The valuation on this stock is insane. With a P/E of 51 it has a loong way to fall in what is looking like a bear market for some considerable time as this virus develops and hits more regions harder.
"Here's the news, ZTS buying ABAX. HSKA up in sympathy, but IDXX down on the stronger comp, I guess..."
IDXX reached a new All Time High at 185.00
IDXX reached a 52 Week low at 204.34
Ludicrously overpriced in this market. Could fall 40 to 50%
"Five, ten and twenty day short information for $IDXX all put together https://marketwirenews.com/short-information/NASDAQ/IDXX"
IDXX is a darling stock !!
Next idxx is ZOM get on board let’s all get rich together.
anyone know why this is dropping so much?
"$ZOM is going to be TESLA of pet care industry. $ZOM point of care device “TRUFORMA” is 20 times more effective and efficient than it’s competitor $IDXX device, it’s current SP is @ $550.

"That was a hell of a report, I'm buying the dip dudes....didn't know I'd wake up to a gift this morning ;)"
Does IDXX see Zomedica as a threat to their business? A purchase opportunity?
Any ideas on what the drop is about today? Just regular profit taking?
Here's the deal on the Motley Fool picks. Always BUY the pullback after the big volume Motley Fool pop. $554-557 is a great entry zone! Then hold the stock for 1 to 5 days minimum if you're a swing trader or longer if you're an investor! The Motley Fool recommends holding for a minimum of 3-5 years using a diversified portfolio of stocks.
News says earnings beat estimates. Why the drop today?
IDEXX Laboratories is down 6.68% to 300.37
get well soon Jon Ayers.
Does anyone have information on IDEXX investigating the buyout of LexaGene? Will they buy only the veterinary side or the human diagnostics as well?
"Worth $54BB, only has $232mm cash!Total INSANITY value!!!"
Good question up almost 10% last week
IDEXX Laboratories is down 6.28% to 230.16
"What’s up with IDXX today, 11/4/2019?"
IDXX reached a 52 Week low at 197.15
"If you're a swing trader, and you want to hit the sweet spot, you would buy IDXX here at $554 and hold it for 2 to 4 days depending on the actual price movement. This is just based on my experience."
They have a volunteer retiree from $IDXX who even bought shares with his own money... SO yeah... i’m gonna have to absolutely agree. lol ;)
IDEXX Laboratories is up 5.25% to 568.70
IDEXX Laboratories is up 5.16% to 253.43

"It's been THREE WHOLE DAYS now, so I'm looking for ward to Preston copying and pasting his ZOM blather. It's just so intriguing, especially the ""that shows the innovation"" part. Ugghhh."
I am really starting to like this company. High institutional interest. No pumpers. Solid business too.
another great recommendation by motley fool. The price was almost 552 when they recommended it
idxx frequently goes down even after good earnings. Then it recovers over the next week.
"What's the reason for the spike up today? Definitely not complaining, but I can't find any info that would cause the jump."
"This company is expected to earned about 4.10 this year, about 4.60 next year, then perhaps 5.30 the year after. Its price is $212. If you assumed 20% growth continued, it would take 13.5 years for the earnings to add up to $212. It would then take another three years of 20% growth to attain a 3% return in terms of total earnings relative to the stock price. Alternatively, you could buy 15-year US treasuries yielding 3%."
Why idxx down again?
Fabulous stock yes peoples?
IDXX is up 4.95% to 196.29
Down another $3.68 today. How low do we go?
IDXX reached a new All Time High at 205.38
doesn't the p/e give you any pause ?
"Earnings tend to roll in on target like ‘clockwork’ and then the stock either jumps 20 points or falls 20 points. Best thing with this baby, don’t watch it frequently, idmore the insane multiple, and just sock it away. I just ‘watched’ it for years, refraining from purchase because of the multiply. About two years ago I just closed my eyes and bought it at about $160. Haven’t regretted it!"
Vivo prvb and goss to soar later today get in before liftoff.....also hrtx can get its approval its brother got upgraded to 37 dnli big brother allk be over 100 soon Feb serious move coming. Elox fprx breakouts soon you can tell by scanner
"I Think IDXX is a STOCK GOD....in that it won't be taken down, lol."
IDXX reached a 52 Week low at 183.13
"*** I just came to know more about one similar device that $IDXX holds and this is 20 % less effective in diagnosis, time taken to get results, cost and portability. So, ZOMedica will surely take over the vet and pet care market with huge orders."
"Strange not much discussion on this one, it's almost a $ 400 dollar stock and no one talks about it, all institutional investors?"
"IDXX sold off like this when ZTS bought Abaxis. Then bounced back. Company EPS was steady as usual and they remain the most competitive n the space. High P/E is tough, but given the track record, has been earned. I just watched this for years, refused to buy because of high P/E, then just bought it anyway and gaven’t Look back. Hiccups come with the territory."
"Yeah, a $10k box with five thyroid tests promised, three delivered. The stock jumped in January when a social influencer got paid $300 to pump the stock. It jumped, got pumped, and promptly got dumped by everybody including the exiting CEO. The blew a deal to hire a distributor sales force so now they are rushing to hire a direct sales force to cover however many vet offices there are in America with about 12 reps. THAT should be interesting! ZOM has missed all their timelines on development, delivery, and distribution so I'd love to be an IDXX rep selling against this start up. Maybe they'll get it together but done ONE THING right would be a good start. BTW, they are competing with an R&D and Sales MONSTER in the vet testing industry in IDXX. I looked with an open mind but came away thinking ""not with my money""."

$ZOM is easy $10 by March device launch. The “TRUFORMA” is going to revolutionize the pets diagnostics platform. It’s competitor company is $IDXX and $ZOM is going to beat their platform for sure.
There must many IDXX millionaires in the greater Portland area.

Go ahead and get ready for this one destroying earnings...
IDXX is rocking!!! It' is almost at its 52 week high!!!
I’ve got to stop buying the MF picks as soon as theyre released. Long term im not concerned but down $20 from when it went live and could’ve had a better entry point.

"This happens periodically, often folowing good earnings. Some ‘brilliant’ young analyst rates it as a ‘hold’ (GS apparently did yesterday) pointing out the high P/E. Yup, it’s high, has always been high due to its continual innovations and strong leadership position in the industry and the occasional ‘sinkholes’ occur when a new, young graduate just out of business school discovers it. Once started, the algorithms take over. As Gwen Verrdun once opined in the play, Damn Yankees,“Ya gotta have heart!”"
