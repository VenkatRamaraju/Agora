FLASH NEWS - $ZOM point of care device “TRUFORMA” is 20 times more effective and efficient than it’s competitor $IDXX (SP @ $550) device. Although IDXX is a big company and serves more areas BUT $ZOM is relatively a new company and has a lot of room for growth and potential in increasing its share price. Zomedica has around 45 patents approved on this device so that shows the innovation.My target SP by March this year is at least $10 and above.
"$ZOM is going to be the rockstar of pet care industry. $ZOM point of care device “TRUFORMA” is 20 times more effective and efficient than it’s competitor $IDXX device, it’s current SP is @ $550.

Zomedica has around 45 patents approved on this device so that shows the innovation.They applied for a Trademark today for MYTRUEFORMA. Like this morning January 13th that went in. Paperwork is online.The CEO has taken 3 previous companies from .30 to over $8 in his career. This is not his first rodeo."
"Worth $54BB, only has $232mm cash!Total INSANITY value!!!"

Any ideas on what the drop is about today? Just regular profit taking?
"$ZOM $IDXX Do I think the market will see further corrections? Most likely. Do I think ZOM will pull through regardless? Not just yes, but a RESOUNDING yes! Positive sales and new product info are going to bring us to new highs well within the year. Patience is the name of the game here people, and our new CEO knows what he is doing. We just got Miller distribution, a larger global accounting firm, and one of Zomedica's SEVERAL game changing products is finally about to release! Personally I will continue to buy any dips, and I think it's a poor time to sell. Things will rebound fast."
How is IDEXX positioned to outcompete competitors? I really like this company but I’m just being cautious as there are other small companies like Lexagene LXG that seem to have a pretty solid game plan. Just looking for people to give me s reason to hold off investing even more in IDEXX.
"*** I just came to know more about one similar device that $IDXX holds and this is 20 % less effective in diagnosis, time taken to get results, cost and portability. So, ZOMedica will surely take over the vet and pet care market with huge orders."
why is this up post close?
Down 100 in the last month?

Zomedica has around 45 patents approved on this device so that shows the innovation.Their new CEO Robert Cohen turned 3 companies from a 0.30 cent stock to $8, and it was already predicted before his appointment that $ZOM would become an at least $3 stock.YESTERDAY they applied for a Trademark for MYTRUEFORMA. Paperwork is online.TODAY a new Truforma webpage is up on their site, also pictures of packaging, and pre-orders are being placed at the moment. PR news could drop soon and help $ZOM reach new highs. This information has yet to catch up with the rest of the market.Realistic bottom right now (before any news hits) is 0.68-0.70 in my opinion, and I believe if you manage to buy around that price you should expect decent profits in the Medium to Long Term."
Does IDXX see Zomedica as a threat to their business? A purchase opportunity?
"Oh wow, 5% drop, I'm so scared...."
"Looking strong again, gaining momentum."
idxx frequently goes down even after good earnings. Then it recovers over the next week.
"IDXX is a great company, but at $45B market company its going to be hard for anyone investing now to get wealthy off this. Take a look at LexaGene (LXXGF). Its a sub $100M company that has revolutionary technology. Its MiQLab System can do 1 hour PCR and is in a trial run at U Penn Vet School. A large pharma just bought a system so it can detect pathogens in its bioreactors making biologics. Plus, FDA EUA for Covid19 testing anticipated in Jan 2021. Get in now and you could make generational wealth off this company."
"What's the reason for the spike up today? Definitely not complaining, but I can't find any info that would cause the jump."
