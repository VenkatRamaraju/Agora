"The longer at the base (($24)) the faster to the moon. Remember Moderna when it was $20 for like a month or two? Then shot up to $50 then $80, $500... This has that same feel, it'll shoot up too. might take a month, but it'll happen this company is so innovative it's going to change the housing market forever!!"
I read today that the median home price in the country is now 400k for the 1st time ever. Wait till it gets to 500k
Did anyone notice the volume at the end? Next week is our turn to set us up for the earning week. Expect to close closer to 26 to 28.
opendoor will gain much deeper market share with Zillow taking a break
Uzzz you need some tissues buddy?
Why we always getting knocked off of $24.?
"Open is where it’s at! Zillow could feel them gaining on them so they bought anything they could get their hands on. Well, what goes up must come down and that is happening in real time right here! Ibuying is the catalyst open has that all the others just don’t have and will have to pay if they want to survive. Nobody gets excited to spend 1/2 a day signing paperwork. Simplifying this aspect of the process is long overdue. As they spread East all while gaining traction with each state they go to. They build up a manageable inventory and are selling them as they go has enabled them to navigate through the overpriced market very efficiently. This trait alone differentiates them from Red Fin and Zillow. Zillow is imploding under the weight of surplus homes they can’t get rid of even after reducing profit margin significantly. A recipe for disaster no doubt! Unfortunately, I only have a very small position here but add when I can. The double tuitions are coming to a close and I will be putting that money towards open! In fact I will wait until they make it to Maine and buy my lake house through them!"
1000 dollars a share in 10 years?

Uzz has one likes on all his posts. Can you all guess who liked his comment.
Shorts who are holding their position because they think real estate prices are cooling clearly aren’t looking at the current facts rn. Prices aren’t dropping lol
"Raja, Price target of 30? Market and You are all in for a rude awakening. The way I see it, if open post 2.25 to 2.4 billion in revenue and 25 to 30 million in EBITDA and if it guides 3.5 to 4 billion in revenue with a EBITDA guide of 40 to 50 million, the stock should run up to 60 dollars by EOY. Let’s see if I am correct"
"Opendoor looks ‘impressive’ compared to Zillow, real estate analyst says. OPEN will be very impressive when 3rd quarter earnings are released."
"Facegun, when will your IQ improve? Did you read the MikeDP article. I am sure you are an affected realtor losing business because of a OPEN. Open is not dumb (unlike someone). I am watching my houses offer for the past 90 days or so and the offer Keeps reducing every day. They have a portfolio level approach and that will ensure they are a market maker in all cycles. Let’s watch for the margin this quarter. It will be atleast 8 to 9 percent when the market is very volatile and as you say markets cooled off. But how are they making 8 to 9 percent then? Can you explain? Also will you shut up if they make 8 to 9 percent in Q3"
I dn‘t understand why there is so little traffic on this board.
"Yesterday alone open listed 250 homes in the markets that are available in the website (which is half). I think open is becoming monstrous with each passing day. Close your covered calls, and sit tight for 3 months."
Only 6 more dollars to go and then I'm in the greeen. Lord help me!
Classic move of setting up a bear trap before earnings. Trying to buy your shares cheap before the blowout earnings report.
