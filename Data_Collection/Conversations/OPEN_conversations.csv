Let your winners ride
"It's weird seeing a 3% drop and then flat in no time. Well, $OPEN has definitely got a lot of attention now."
Just add more 7200 shares @$17.30 We going up guy! relax not added to original float!everyone get that straight!buy the dip
Sold. I think I will regret… but 60% profit.
33 days until Q3 report :)
"Love to see OPEN break above $20 - we have broken the resistance line of $18, let’s hope this baby rides."
"9 billion dollar borrowing capacity can allow open to purchase 40000 homes at a price of 350k per home. If the turn is 4 times a year, 36 billion borrowed to purchase 160k homes. 5 percent fee alone will earn 1.8 billion dollars. Open will reach 35 billion in revenue in 2023. The markets they opened this year will set the stage for growth in 2022 and 23"
My target on this stock mid term is 35$.
Looks to be bouncing off 17 relatively well. Over 30M volume today should have eaten up a good chunk of the secondary offering. Can it hold the line and go up tomorrow?
Good article on seeking alpha todayhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4453919-opendoor-the-mythology-of-disruption
"Uzz, Wahaha, wait for another month. And please short. We really want you guys to short. Tick tock, tick tock for Q3 earnings and then you will know. There is a rude awakening coming for this stock. Just wait and watch. I am sitting really good with more than a five figure (not value) share count."
Y’all see that 900k buy?
Is Uzz doing ok?
good job
"CEO of Redfin was on CNBC today talking about getting into the same thing as Opendoor--""ibuyer"" type stuff. fyi"
$50 by 2022. Cathy Wood should have hold tight instead of sold for a loss.
"very happy daymy portfolio is up of 3,6% and Open is the strongest one"
Let me get 50 shares @21.01 a share just to break the $21 barrier
Double bottom support at 19.78. She’s a beaut

Expect more debt/equity soon.
Jokes on you shorty. This is going to $22+
"Past: In 2016, we moved to upgrade to a better home. This is how the process worked. Home prep (cleaning, staging, moving unnecessary things to storage), hire agent, list, showings for 2 months, got an offer, wrote a contingent offer on a new home under construction, closed, moved to an apartment, moved large items to storage, closed on new home, move again, THE END.The future:Buy home with newhomesource, sign a contract with new home source and trade in contract with Opendoor online at the same time, close both at the same time and move. The END"
"I only bought the equivalent of 3500USD at 15.61. It’s a small part of my portfolio, but boy do I have fun with it and this forum! Mani for his analysis, Kyle for being a fan boy and Uzz because there’s never a good story without a baddy on it. And the rest of the regular posters, thanks for the insights and the fun. Fly Open, fly free!"
drinking age
$25 by end of next week. No interest in selling today.
Like this if you’re buying tomorrow.Dislike this if you’re selling tomorrow.
OPEN--Been buying up inventory at all-time record highs and moving into a rising rate environment. Sounds like a good plan.
"swap of 28M share is over, 19 again in few days as predicted some days ago"
Housing prices do not control the price of this stock
A moment of silence for those who panic sold yesterday on red. Especially for Uzz and Facegun who increased their short position.
Open sesame
Opened short #$%$ made a lot. Hahaha
"ARKK sells 300k shares - funny tho, she sold 15m shares a couple months ago at huge loses at $14, now we’re at $20"
"Oh look, I was right. Uzz was wrong. 20.12 support held, headed to $21"
Adding big time at 19.50
diamond hands from now on! till all time high
good luck folks. I'm no longer a baggie and I'm out.
Facegun and Uzz this weekend
@mani have you been tracking homes listed? Miss your updates. If you’ve been keeping them personal lmk
We already cross the 200ma. Last try was sept 27. Right now we need 21 ema to cross 200ma. And omg waiting for the golden cross. 50ma Cross 200ma. Stock price it’s bouncing above 21ema. What is fantastic.
Be ready to the moon
we really are starting to gain some MO.... Boolean

Blowing past $22 today on the latest article about selling a home on opendoor.
"Open set a new a record (according ibuyerstat) of homes sold. 439 homes sold in the last 3 days. more than 140/day. in Q3, from 30 June to now (19 september) OPEN sold 7827 homes at 400K$ of average price.With this rate the ibuyestat's q3 selling volume will be very close or just above 9000recalls that for q2 the data of ibuyerstats were 10-15% higher than the actual ones"
"according ibuyerstats, open closed the Q3 by selling another 420homes in the last 3 days bringing the full Q3 to 9215 homes soldaverage q3 price per home is just over 400k$ [even according ibuyerstats]considering a 12-15% margin for both average price and selling volume the expected revenue are in the range of 2,7-3B$. that is about 50-60% more than expected by the market.zillow also has a great grow (more than Open) in the last 40days, however zillow volumes are still 20-30% lower and additionally zillow has almost a double capitalization."
Someone does not want it to stay down. Now I am scared for my 25 covered call
ARK is selling. What should we do?

"I am in the Boston area and I was hoping to use opendoor for a vacation home in southern Maine. Well, they just have not yet to begin. With so many States in which to dominate this is just getting started! I love the concept and believe it will be the norm as word gets out how simple they make the process for both sides of the transaction. Ilove it "
"What does it mean by ""priced""? Does that mean someone bought the $28m shares?"
"next stop 23, then down to 21, and go to 25, and so on"
"Man I was thinking of hedging here but holy options call volume. I thought $23 would be top in this trend but these manipulators have the ability to drive this to $28+ before ER. Sheeewww. Gonna go from down 50% to up 90%. Lmfao. Trust your gut kids if you believe in a company and it drops. Don’t listen to the nay sayers here, on CNBC, and your discord chat rooms."

can’t believe i’m back to green. patience pays off
What’s going on today? Any upgrades coming in soon?
Wow my only green stock in my portafolio
"From ibuyerstatsin the last 3 days open has sold 358 homes, bringing the total Q3 at 591 homes sold in the same Q3 period open sold 317 homes. the growth Q4/Q3 is about 86%.the average price of removed homes from listings is constantly increasing. at the moment is about 410K$"
"Uzz, what price target will make you stop posting? Let us know"
"Uzz, LOL..LOL.."
My question is when do we squeeze these shorts?
"$WIMI $COIN $OPEN Charts are very favorable so do not sell or you will regret it. If you have the margin, buy more while it's down."
Inside of a 1000.00 loss at this point. Tempted to sell but will wait to see if I can squeeze a few more bucks out of this trash… not holding my breath if past performance is any indicator. Kinda just want it OFF the books .
Finally in the green since February and a lot of averaging down. What’s the plan in terms of growth after we max out the $9bn warchest? Borrow more and more money over and over? What will happen when the $Bn’s become real large and then there’s a US real estate market crash? How much revenue can the adjacent services generate? Tia
Here is my prediction for 2021 and 2022. Q3: 2.2 billionQ4: 3.1 billionQ1 2022: 4.4 billionQ2: 6 billionQ3: 8 billionQ4: 9 billion
Breakout to $21.50+ by Friday. Prediction made off charting this. Clear channel has been intact for the past 50 days
Bank industry had great earnings. I think the housing market is reason for such a strong earnings for banks. This means Opendoor should be doing very well buying and selling homes across America. Earnings should be over than expected. $30 is definitely coming.
"Khosla Ventures owns 46m shares through VK Services Fund. (Series A, B, C, D & E)Softbank owns 73m shares through SB Investment Advisors. (Series E)Eric Wu owns 45m shares. (This wouldn't make sense)"
"No strangers, no staging, no agents, no open houses, no negotiations back and forth, no hassle, certainty, speed, convenience, flexible closing, free rent back, allowed to live free in the home for 7 days after closing. This is the value proposition of Opendoor."
Loving it.
"Hold imo, broken through 50 day moving average and has been steadily rising."
"For selfish reasons, I don’t want the stock to go past 20.5 today. Today only. Please help"
"My price target based on 3x sales of 15 billion in 2022 - $90 dollars. If carvana can have 5x sales and similar adjacent services margin, 3x is really conservative."
"We are in 44 markets now!!  3 more markets added, look at their website."
"On ibuyerstats I counted the houses removed from listings (i suppose these have been sold) since June 30up to 16 september (today) the houses that have been removed from the list are 7388. average price was about 400k$/home. the margin between purchase and sale is about 13%according to this, the revenue until now should be around 3Billion. so 400M$ of grossmarginAre I wrong in somethings? expected revenue for the full q3 is in 1.8-2B range."
"Retail and other investors who have not rush in as Ark did have a good opportunity to get cheep shares. Arkk selling does not mean nothing! Look at $OPEN , after arkk sell everything about 13$ it went up to 20 + and now after big redStill at 19$. Sklz she has sell very little, and i think its algorytm selling and just a littlebit! Have a nice green day everybody. This stock might be green today i think "
"using the ibuyerstats data I did the same exercise of yesterday for the second quarter. I counted the houses removed from the listing in Q2 and i have estimated the revenue. Well , according ibuyerstats Open removed (sold?) in Q2 from the list about 3870 homes, with an average price of 370k. it means about 1,45B in revenue.The Q2 Official earning calls reported 1,25B and 3480 homes sold (about 12-15% less than ibuyerstats)now ibuyerstats reports 7388 home in q3 since 30 june until now. the projection for the full q3 is that homes sold will be in the range of 8500-9000 at the end of the quarter, with an average price of 400k$ and more than 3,5B$ in revenue.according to this the actual q3 revenue should be very close to 3B$, about 50-60% more than expected from the market.good luck to all. sorry for my english, i'm writing from italy."
I saw a story on WHAT JOBS ARE GOING TO CEASE TO EXIST and the top one was REAL ESTATE AGENT as everything makes it move to what OPEN IS DOING. We are in a very good place here. STAY LONG AND STRONG WHERE WE BELONG. It is nascent and emergent but it is REAL. Boolean
Solidly moving up from the opening price this morning despite massive drops in the overall market today. Looking good. When the nasdaq bounces back up this will easily pop over $20. Buy the dip!
HEY EVERYONE …. ITS OFFICIAL I AM UZZ’s DADDY NOW 
"strong, in a heavy red day."
I am buying 50 shares at 20.01 just to break the $20 barrier
Insiders selling!!!
I am shorting this #$%$ to 0 when the housing market turns. And mark my word it?s getting overheated very very quickly
$100 next year!!!
according ibuyerstatsopen has sold (removed from the list) 435 homes in the last 3 days bringing the Q3 Total to 8502my forecast for the full Q3 is close to 9000average price is near 400k/homesrecalls that ibuyerstats overestimates the actual volumes by about 15%according to that My Q3 revenue forecast is pretty close to 3Billion. that is a lot
This will soon be a $40 stock. Good news around the corner!
not added to original float!everyone get that straight!buy the dipYes sir I am doing it now
3 Billion is a lot of buying power
We have to be careful with writing covered calls going forward. I have 20.5 CCs expiring tomorrow. Hedge funds will push through to secure shares and then May gap up on Mondays. Just be careful. Don’t give up your shares for few pennies on a share
@uzz told you it was accumulation between $14-18. Not sure how many times I said it but I am honestly sorry you’re losing so much money now.
easily a $100bn company
Up 20% on investment. I’ll hold
I don't care.
Citigroup increase price target from $34 to $40!! Let’s fly tomorrow!
Posting 2.2 billion in Q3 is 100 percent QOQ growth. Tell me one company that can do it (think TSLA). Now think of the potential.
"On the Opendoor website this morning looking to buy a home. The drop down menu lists ONLY 14 cities to buy in. Thats it? Homelight already buying/selling in Chicago, is OPEN? It doesnt appear so on their website…"
"Guys, the arguments seems very legit, should I hold or sell? confused!!!https://youtu.be/HxkC0A-ESVQ"
"It appears open is setting to add 1 billion dollars QOQ. From Q2 actual to Q3 guide is 1 billion and based on inventory and pending contracts, we can easily do minimum 3 billion in Q4. If they maintain the same rate due to contributions from new markets in 2022, open will do 7 billion by end of Q4 2022. Annualized run rate would be 28 billion in 2023 without growth in 2023. It is a scary proposition to short this stock. I am just saying"
I wish I bought some when it was 13 two weeks ago. I put 200k in Sofi and still down

"Shorts, I am sure some of you might own a home. Don’t Tell me you don’t like this convenience. I think some shorts are real estate agent getting displaced by Opendoor."
Only up from here
Short interest increased a great deal since the last report was released 2-weeks ago. A bad sign for the short-term although the long-term remains promising.￼
LOL.
why is this trnding down when the whole market is up !?

I heard about OPEN the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
someone knows something
We back at $20!!!
2030 price target if OPEN achieves its goals: $1400 - $1600 a share
we've already dropped enough... market resistant
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
Buy and hold on! Getting to $20 by tomorrow!
"Wood prices were up 40%. Home prices always follow how much it costs to build a house including the rise of labor. Housing prices such as renting, buying homes are getting expensive are due to many factors. Zoning costs, regulations of every inch of the land, labor costs, material costs, Subcontractor costs, transportation costs, risks cost."
Didn’t know open was a risk-off play 
Definitely going to be a bunch of squeezes occurring if msft can reclaim 50 dma
I don’t feel bad for all you that sold me your cheap shares. This is a long term play and the current 52 wk high will be a low price for this stock 5 years from now. $100 PT by 2025
20.60 means shorts are screwed
Where is my son uzz ?
192 homes listed today. Roughly 57 million in listed revenue. In one day and the day is not over yet. It’s 7 pm eastern.
with 9 billion open can buy about 25000home
Hey uzz … have you heard of DEE ?
Back to reality….
"If you are a fellow OPEN long, what other disruptive stocks are you buying or looking to buy?"
"Is this going back to $14.70 support over the next few weeks? don't get me wrong, I'm bullish on the stock just think Sept could be weak for the Nasdaq and growth stocks and then OPEN will explode after Q3 earnings. Thoughts?"
Is Opendoor more about Wall Street games than a viable business?
"Someone ask the question, what happens to OPEN if we have a housing bust ? It will have a negative effect on the housing industry, but would not be as bad on OPEN. Why? New housing builds would slow to a crawl but OPEN does not build new homes, they sell existing homes. So I feel OPEN would fair much better than the rest."
"[from ibuyerstats] open sold 233 homes in the last 3 days bringing the Q4 selling volume at 233 homes sold.as I imagined the strategy is to increase inventory at the beginning of the quarter. OPEN has added over 1000 homes to the warehouse in one day(which is a record), bringing the total to 4553 homes. this will boost sales in the coming weeks.i think the board decided to do so at the beginning of q4 to contain the cash flow of q3."
"Don't you ruin Barker for me ~ Jay Bryan Cohen, formerly of Boca Raton, Fl"
next quarter if things go well like last quarter I think we are going to see $25 dollars a share .
SoftBank’s Vision Fund is the seller for the offering in case anyone doesn’t know. They purchased 70m shares for 400M ($5.50/sh) in OPEN’s Series E round (2018).They are selling 28m of those 70m in $16-18 range for 450M-500M. After the sale they will still be holding over 40M shares worth about 700M.
insiders buying
I WILL NEVER SELL SHORTY
Bought my routine 5 shares this morning. Every paycheck. 100 bucks worth. Rain or shine.
Poor mani and uzz
Added 500 shares today. GLTA!
This news means nothing. It's a buying opportunity. GL.
$20 is gone and not coming back. Let’s go OPEN longs. Time to add more and squeeze uzz to oblivion
"For the question on making money when the market turns south, here are some thoughts to ponder1) open could increase fees to 8 percent due to the certainty their product offers when the real estate market goes south. So even if they lose 3 percent, the increase in fees will more than compensate for their loss. Their typical retention period is 3 months for a home.2) they could throttle their offer value down and make a percent or two in a downturn market/. Buyers will still chose open due to the certainty and convenience. My previous home had a Opendoor offer for 505k one month ago. Now the offer is 486k. They are constantly adjusting the pricing to account for market conditions. 3) at any point, one third of their buy side inventory is in contracts. So they are leveraged in a sense and pull out contracts if the market turns south quickly like last year. 4) they could buy insurance to cap their losses."
just hit 25.50 by tomorrow mid day then come back down to 24.89 by end of day
"OPEN is planning on spending billions to purchase houses for its inventory. However, suppose there was a major correction in house prices, could this result in OPEN having large debts/losses?Is one company buying up so many homes really beneficial to society? Could OPEN become more like a landlord?"
good job. We can go out to dinner on the weekend
"[from ibuyerstats] other 293 homes sold in the last three days bringing the q3 total to 8795full q3 will be close to 9000. also with a margin of 15% and average selling price of houses near 370-380k, the q3 revenue will be in the range 2,7-3B, that is a lot.I noticed in the last week OPEN tried to decrease the inventory, maybe probably to increase the cash and to avoid the accusation of cashburner."
"Took a beating on this stock. Bought at 30 at what thought was a good price. Then sold for loss. Good for those who held. Good company, but already burnt me once. Too much hedge fund manipulation."
The over all market tanked today but OPEN held strong. I think that's a good sign.
when is Q3 report?
"Only Opendoor and Zillow knew what they are turning to accomplish. Not many investors or analysts understand what is going on. It's not just buying and selling homes, it's about to disrupt and evolve the real estate market to lower the fees for the whole real estate marketplace. One stop shop for everyone including renters and owners of properties."
Its will hit 23. by end of Oct for sure. This is the trend for this industry.
Tremendous “golden cross” was just confirmed with the 50 day and 200 day MA.
"Oh boy, this chart reminds me of the early days of plenty large cap companies that have dominated the market for years. Only up from here"

"I’ll get a feeling (ya know that inside feeling that gives you high convictions that nothing can go wrong)- I have a feeling open door is about to break out.Had the same feeling about Ethereum, chainlink, fastly, crowdstrike, Tesla, and Fiverr in early 2020."
See you all tomorrow it's going to be big surprises for all $22 going to happen.
Hoping options players play the 25C lotto today
This company does nothing to the country. Raise billions to buy homes and flip these back to the market? How does this behavior add value to the most Americans?

Stock on way up. I feel we will see high 19's very soon.
$$25 then $30 is coming
No additional shares. Outstanding stocks will remain the same.
$20 isn’t coming back 
Did anyone notice the volume at the end? Big boys are moving in.
Can anyone answer if interest rates goes back up on home loans is this a good thing for OPEN? Or do OPEN buy at a set interest rate. If open follow home loan rates with FEDs wouldn’t this be kind of a head for inflation to a certain extent? Of course there will be less home buyers with higher interest rates but wouldn’t higher interest rates make up the difference somewhat?
Moment of silence for uzz
Should I get in or wait ?
I called 21.50 today. You’re welcome
Wahaha asked if it is time for another debt financing. I would say yes since they are expanding like wild fire and would need capital to expand. I like how they are using the Publix markets. Tapping for the current need and considering alternative approaches before Public insurance of shares
touched 21!
"Paolo, I see only 3688 homes which is pretty close to what they had at the end of Q3. These are listed homes in the website. What is the 1000 homes you are talking about?"
Whoever asked if I could call $30 by this week… you might be right. We have a big breakout just starting
One of the best stocks $OPEN which always rocks
Don't shoot me - I could see this bouncing off $18 in the next week
Citigroup resumed “buy” rating and raised price target from $34 to $40 -9/24
Let’s go to the moon!
Wood prices at one time were up 300%.
"What a joke. At least that was my experience with Opendoor. They advertise how convenient they are..sounds good. Reality--I scheduled an appointment for a self-tour, drive out to the house, and there is no keypad on the door to enter the house. I called for assistance and talked to someone overseas who was very nice but couldn't do anything to help. No follow-up from Opendoor. What a waste of my time, which is especially bad for a company who's main selling point is convenience and efficiency. I have closed the door on Opendoor."
"Zillow co-founder was a PIPE investor. The ecosystem potential for $Z and $OPEN and $DOMA is enormous. Technicals look alright, wait for the J Curve on the IPO spac, buy, hold, wait. I listened to a podcast with the CEO on Patrick O'Shaunasshey podcast. Driven intelligent guy, he will succeed in my opinion."
Time to cover shorty
"I hope it can come down to $15 again, so I can grab more shares. Didn't buy enough last dip."
"So to make this clear to everyone: this secondary offering is NOT dilutive. It's an insider selling a large chunk of their shares. My guess for who it is: Khosla Ventures / Keith Rabois as the GP. They invested in Opendoor's Series A, B, C, D & E"
"According to ibuyerstats, Open listed for sale more than 700 houses in the past 3 days, which is a record. They also sold 400 houses in the past 3 days. On track for massive Q3 and Q4."
What do they even do?
"Congrats to longs. My personal experience with Opendoor was terrible, but at least some people are doing well with the stock."
can we get to $21 ever?
WOW is the one simple word that should be written here.
Only insider individual with over 28m shares is CEO with about 37m so hes selling 3/4 of his company?
Last chance to get in under $20 lol
Looks like some good news around the corner
what's happening after hours? 
I was hoping Open would climb closer to Zillow not the other way around. lol
Going back to $28
Can’t keep this stock down anymore
"Uzz, we want you to keep making your daily predictions since it is working out so well for us"
Last opportunity for buy under 20$
"Hope Access are not the only ones responsible for all the recent buying pressure, I would love this rally to continue :-)"
"open sold 240 homes in the last three days, bringing the total q3 selling volume to 8067 homes.from ibuyerstats data"
A little TBT on this Friday morning as we reminisce on @Uzz’s price target of $4 :) very accurate! I heard McDonald’s is hiring if you need a job!
This thing is disconnect from the high priced housing market. Look for this to go back to $30 as housing prices drop
Strong rn
I heard about OPEN the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Sell off was way over done and a perfectly good buying opportunity. Doubled my position.
Facegun and Uzz today morning…
Opendoor partners with BDX’s NewHomeSource
Crossed 200 day moving average to the upside on heavy volume! Very bullish technical sign. Also as the market was going down quite a bit today this stock defied the market and continued to go higher ending close to the highs of the day. Also very positive. Also recently their great earnings and big revenue guide to the upside very bullish. Quite a bit off 52 week high with plenty of room to run to the upside. Average price target 31.20. Also factor in the high short interest with hard to borrow shares and we have many positives coming together at the same time which I feel will lead to a nice continued increase or perhaps an explosive increase in share price.
Wowlume
"Good company, good fundamentals in a growth sector "
Tomorrow cpi report should bring this back down to 16. LOL.
The offering will close on Sep 16th. Does it mean that all the sale will be completed by 16th? Of the offering with citi will close by that date?
