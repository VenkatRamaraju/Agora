"Everytime I've driven on the highways lately, I've seen almost every single Lamar billboard with an advertisement on it, maybe 1 in 20 or 30 did not have an active ad on it. They can't be losing so much revenue that it threatens their business and slashing the dividend was a smart move to reserve cash for the uncertainty of the pandemic, IMO."

"I wouldn't be surprised if 1/3 to 1/2 of this company's ""displays"" are in the hospitality and tourism sector given all the blue type exit signs they have for restaurants, hotels and attractions on interstate highways, and these are the businesses in the most trouble from the pandemic."
Interesting that there are so few conversations about LAMR. This is an interesting REIT that is completely different from 99% of the others. In that respect it adds diversification to a REIT portfolio. It has grown its dividend by about 10% each year for the previous two. Its revenue is growing at about 6% annually. It is a somewhat volatile stock which means that when the price is right it is a bargain. At about 65 a share it screams bargain. At that price the yield 5.6% not bad for a company growing the dividend 10% annually.

Why is this stock down 43 percent? Was there a split? There's no news of any kind that I can find on here. I realize the market is down a lot to day but 43 percent is excessive even for a day like this.

Any thoughts on the stock?

"How does this stock move so much with no news? And what's up with the dividend announcements? The last payout was 9/28 but I can find no declaration date for that dividend. I see the previous dividend (paid on 6/29) was announced on 5/17. So that leads me to think they should have announced this dividend on or around 11/17, but nothing. Crickets. Yet it moves over a buck to the upside today as if someone announced a dividend increase. Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?"
