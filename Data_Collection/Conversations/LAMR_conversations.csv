Does anyone expect the coronavirus to kill everyone on earth? Has the Coronavirus destroyed money in the economy like the Mortgage crisis of 2008?
WOW! Great earnings and divi increase can't beat it! GLTA!
any opinions on the div. pretty good payout for this climate
LAMR could take the opportunity to buy CCO cheap and consolidate the Billboard business
Interesting that there are so few conversations about LAMR. This is an interesting REIT that is completely different from 99% of the others. In that respect it adds diversification to a REIT portfolio. It has grown its dividend by about 10% each year for the previous two. Its revenue is growing at about 6% annually. It is a somewhat volatile stock which means that when the price is right it is a bargain. At about 65 a share it screams bargain. At that price the yield 5.6% not bad for a company growing the dividend 10% annually.
I love seeing all the Lamar signs in my city occupied 
LAMR is up 4.90% to 67.86

Company is mandating all employees to be vaccinated by dec 8th I closed most my position unfortunately.
"I wouldn't be surprised if 1/3 to 1/2 of this company's ""displays"" are in the hospitality and tourism sector given all the blue type exit signs they have for restaurants, hotels and attractions on interstate highways, and these are the businesses in the most trouble from the pandemic."
Looks like there was a shake up at the top - just popped back up to 77.51.

"I've got to believe that a Presidential Election should mean a lot of spending on billboard ads at the national, state and local levels."
"Everytime I've driven on the highways lately, I've seen almost every single Lamar billboard with an advertisement on it, maybe 1 in 20 or 30 did not have an active ad on it. They can't be losing so much revenue that it threatens their business and slashing the dividend was a smart move to reserve cash for the uncertainty of the pandemic, IMO."
Why is this stock down 43 percent? Was there a split? There's no news of any kind that I can find on here. I realize the market is down a lot to day but 43 percent is excessive even for a day like this.
Lamar Advertising is up 4.95% to 72.48
