#bbig is a rocket 
Looks like we will be able to accumulate more shares this morning on discount. Shorts are digging deeper holes and building greater future buying pressure through eventual covers. Absolutely love it!
Can we hit 9 million total volume?
Just logging in for the first time this AM. Wonder how many shares they dumped to drop it back under $10.00 today. It appears to be a ticking time bomb. If the SEC would crack down on this BS it would be to $20.00 in no time!
"All that shorting, just to end up being buried more in debt with shares that longs are going to want $100s of dollars for.... Now that's HILARIOUS!! HAHA"
"I'm still not convinced that 8.68 is the bottom, and that puts me in a predicament I don't like to be in beause it's only a matter of weeks before Dauch comes out with favorable news on the progress their making. He said in the CC to give him 90 days, but I firmly believe that the strategy is to make an announcement sometime before earnings. I'm still waiting to pull the trigger at least into next week, but at these prices, knowing that WKHS is going to jump to 30 overnight, I'm so tempted!! I could easily average down to around 10.25, and I might be getting too greedy."
45% short float
So if the short lose when borrowing shares then why are they doing that every day for months ???
It’s happening
80 billion dollar valuation for Rivian based on the fact that Amazon said they will order 10k vans..... Does that mean WKHS should be sitting at 70 billion dollar market cap??? That's roughly $400/share......
Tomorrow is going to be 12+ but soon there is big jump and 20+ mark may word just hold don’t sell it wait wait
"This share price is now the BIGGEST DISCONECT IN THE ENTIRE MARKET. $WKHS has intensely consolidated to smart money which has continued to add shares on the daily short attacks for now 2 months’ worth of 30% to 60% daily short volume. Yet Workhorse is an innovative American tech disruptor with over 5000% revenue growth, 8000 last mile EV orders and identified 1000 to 2000 more on the way, a new industry icon CEO who has done his homework on the company prior to coming on board, flush with enough cash without additional revenue to fuel operations for a couple of years, with vehicle mounted drone delivery patents, new drone agreements with the US government, and impending FAA approval for drone delivery (45 of 45 perfect delivery testing in varied conditions), very positive response from the judge potentially getting them back into at least some of the USPS contract, and more catalysts in the pipeline."
Volume spike??
what is happening? Jumping horse?
"Did GM Just Fire a Shot Across Workhorse Group’s Bow?Prepare for WKHS stock to get a lot more volatile in 2021BrightDrop Is Bad News for All Commercial EV StartupsNow, GM is launching BrightDrop, with FedEx (NYSE:FDX) playing an important role in electric commercial vehicles’ future success. FedEx worked with GM in 2020 to test out GM’s EP1 delivery pallet; it’s also interested in buying a number of its EV600 delivery vans set to begin production toward the end of 2021."
"Some nice big buy orders went through at the ask this morning: 19K, 20K, 37K, and 46K."
"June 2021, both the CEO Steve Burns and CFO Julio Rodriguez of Lordstown Motors resigned from their positions. While the official press release states this is in anticipation of changing from R&D to Production, the non-binding nature of the pre-sale agreements has been brought into question after revelations that the largest three purchasers were not committed to acquiring the Lordstown production vehicle (and most did not have the means to even do so if they wanted to). An independent investigation commissioned by the board found that the pre-order agreements were overstated in number and in seriousness in order to generate press.Thanks Wikipedia"
RAM will go EV!https://www.motor1.com/news/528432/2022-ram-promaster-specs-photos/
"First, its protest of the USPS’s decision could make headway. Second, its HorseFly drone technology could be more successful than expected. Last month, InvestorPlace columnist Joseph Nograles explained that the shares could get a big lift if HorseFly is approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA. Third, any sort of progress towards getting a private-sector electric truck order could cause the name to rally.After former Delphi Technologies CEO Richard Dauch was recently appointed as the automaker’s CEO, the company may now have the experienced leadership it needs to get out of its current rut.If any of these positive catalysts materialize, the shares may have room to rally 100%, or even more."
"The tighter we hold, the higher this can go..."
Not 1 ever sold. LMAOhttps://ir.workhorse.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/86/workhorse-w-15-extended-range-electric-pickup-truck-begins
Heavy call purchased
How many trucks were actually delivered toUnited Parcel Service?
"Bearish_bot has realized that wkhs EV is not even worth bashing it is so blatantly obvious how much further ahead of the competition they are so now he is focusing the SHORT AND DISTORT campaign on the drone part of their business..... Which WKHS also is a leader in, most definitely in the USA, the biggest economy in the world. But in Ireland there is a drone that delivers coffees..... hahahaha"

"So Pride went live with their PrideEV website today and they are selling, renting and leasing Workhorses C650 and C1000 vans. WITH THE CURRENT PAYLOAD CAPACITY....."
"Thread on potential squeeze target prices on reddit assumes 175k shares covered yesterday reported equals 1.4% share price gain. Then half of exchange reported shares covering (20 million) divided by the 175k of covering yields 114 iterations of yesterday's 1.4% gain. Compounding 1.4% gains 114 times yields a share price of $47 per share. However, some believe that just as many naked short shares are out there on $WKHS as exchange reported. With this assumption, half of the short shares is 30 million short shares (20 million exchange, 10 million naked) and 114 + 57 or 171 iterations of 1.4% gains. Compounding yields $104.75 share price.If you think 40 million short shares are forced to cover then compounding yields $231 share price. The upper bound of a squeeze might be 40 million exchange reported shares covered plus 20 million naked short shares covered which compounded using the overly simplistic mathematical model above yields $511 share price in possibly the maximum squeeze."
Don't get me wrong I love to see green but I want to see .45 cent .75 cent runs daily that will instill confidence in others to buy. Love to see at close of tomorrow Wkhs up .75 cents
"If VIA Motors bring any contract or possible contract, $IDEX will be more valued than $WKHS !!!"
ALL THOSE SHARES SOLD SHORT AND ITS STILL GREEN!!!!OHHH MY THATS NOT GOOD!BWHAHAHAHAHA
Workhorse reported in the second quarter of 2021 they delivered 14x more trucks in that one quarter than all of 2020 combined. That is 14x improvement under new CEO and yet the stock just sits there. No other vehicle manufacturer had that level of improvement
"For any new folks joining the message board being inundated with bullish hype:Here are some Workhorse highlights:Only 14 vehicles delivered last quarterOver 100 trucks parked that are notreadily sellable Redesign requiredEV market is growing, but so is competition including EV trucks from GM and Ford, Volvo, etcDrones won't add to bottom line for years, if ever.Workhorse has no patent that precludes competitionNew CEO is a plus, but until this company proves it can scale,there are much better places for your money"
"The bashers are all talking about the limited payload of the current C-1000. I have seen reports that it is 6,000 pounds or 6,500 pounds. Let's take a look at the competition:ELMS: Cargo Space = 170 CF ..... Payload = 2,403 lbsGM/Brightdrop: Cargo Space = 600 CF ..... Payload = 2,200 lbsFord E-Transit: Cargo Space = 487 CF ..... Payload = 3,300 lbsArrival: Cargo Space = 600 CF ..... Payload = 4,630Workhorse C-1000: Cargo Space = 1000 Cubic Feet ..... Payload = 6,000+"
"@Tom, @Thanh and others, it isn't like you haven't seen this before. It has been happening for days. Why are acting so surprised? The surprise will be on the shorts when all of a sudden, they cannot sell enough shares short to manipulate the price down. Then they are in trouble and we win."
"Probably best not to believe everything from Fuzzy Panda, but the fact that FedEx and UPSwent with other manufacturers does add credibility to there being quality issues.https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/workhorse-falls-on-short-seller-claim-ev-maker-misled-investors"
"How anyone cannot see that the share price is in direct correlation with the time and number of shares borrowed is beyond me. Why does the SEC does not crack down more on this manipulation? If we can see it just by monitoring Ortex and the trades, surely the SEC has more sophisticated technology to spot these manipulators. Perhaps these hedge funds pick a small fish in the sea so that the SEC doesn't go after them. It would be much more noticeable if it were being done to a Blue Chip. The good news is, it won't last forever. It would seem that WKHS has reached a bottom and with all of the good things going for the company, keeping the share price down is becoming more and more difficult. It took 600K shares this morning to keep it below $9.00 up until now."
What is the short count???? 65 million or 70 million that need to cover
"Horsie up today, cathie wood sold horsie said bye bye"
"What is clear from initial customer feedback is that we need to further increase the payload capacity of our vehicles. Although there are niche market opportunities for the lower payload vehicle, those opportunities are limited. The majority of our customers needs a higher payload vehicle, which serves a much larger market segment. Our engineering teams are already hard at work on the revised design of the C1000....We recognize that there is a lot of work still to be done and likely difficult decisions ahead to position our company for long-term success.During the question-of-answer session, analysts were apparently perplexed by the previously undisclosed payload issue and the resulting requirement to rework the design of the company's core C-1000 BEV truck, particularly after the new CEO admitted that the problem has been known internally for quite some time already.Not surprisingly, management had to bear some tough questions:Mike Shlisky (D.A. Davidson)...So I was just little bit confused, guys. So you've got 8,000 orders here. So 8,000 folks, in the case of Pritchard or Pride Group, 8,000 orders worth of people have seen the truck, they've seen the spec sheet that you gave them before, they've test driven the truck and they said, Yes, I want to drive that. In the case of Pritchard and Pride, I can definitely sell that as you put it to me. And now you're saying that, that's not the case, but they signed binding orders to take these vehicles. And I'm a little confused as to how -- as to kind of what has changed since they actually signed their binding orders that they're not going to get their orders and actually they're going to get an entirely different product. Have any of the competitors out there put out a much higher payload vehicle within the same class as for past week having a great payload, if not one of the best ones out there today. So what's changed that have really caused you to make this design switch here?Rick Dauch, CEOYes, Mike, good question. So that's one of the things I'm going to clarify with the team, with the customers. Like I've had introductory calls with Pride and Pritchard, a couple of others this week, talked to Chris, our Head of Sales and on to the factory. I need to understand that mix, okay? We'll see, okay? At the end of the day, the vehicle that we have designed doesn't quite meet the specs we want to get from a payload. It's a little heavy versus what we can carry, okay? So we got to figure out just how big the market is for a lower payload right now and how fast we can then tweak our designs and improve our vehicle dynamics to meet the higher payload requirements, right?"
#RIDE is up with 17% and over 1.5M volume
"$WKHS is currently up 16% in the last 8 trading sessions. That while the shorts have actually borrowed almost 500k more shares per day than they returned. Ladies and gentlemen, this dam is going to break soon."
"Oshkosh trades $16.60 at 7:30 pmThose were idx basket trades, OSH remains up so don't celebrate too early."
Does Lordstown stand to benefit ifWorkhorse gets any part of the USPS contract.I had read on Bloomberg about some right of refusal licensing deal it had with Workhorse.Anyone familiar with this?

"@imafed fellow long here, successful investor but admittedly uninformed on squeezes. Help me understand what precludes the shorts from coordinating an orderly unwinding of their massive short positions. So instead of shorts scrambling and competing for shares after a positive catalyst resulting in significantly higher prices, maybe they coordinate a more orderly covering thereby reducing the risk of higher prices. Thx. Appreciate any insight you can offer."
The shorts have to be worried lol. Anyone got info if any shorts covered yet?

Shorts are getting desperate. They borrowed another 100K. Now at 588K shares.
unbelievable that's all I got to say. We will probable in up Red or up single digits. Simply amazing
"Workhorse stock did really well today, thousands of calls were exercised and the short sellers burned through many millions of dollars shorting this stock which didn't even turn it red which was awesome.I absolutely look forward to the epic WKHS rocket trip to the moon, it won't be long now with the way things are going. The ship is fueled up and ready for the moon trip."
@William You say this is short manipulation well then it's gonna last the rest of the yr b/c there won't be any catalyst nor any PR's unitl the 3rd Q release and if that not up to par then I will see you in 2022
Entire market went south and WKHS is holding it's gains. Probably will run this afternoon as well.
I hope Workhorse is playing it straight with it's orders.KEY POINTSFederal officials used charges against Nikola founder Trevor Milton as a warning to Wall Street about special purpose acquisitions companies.Officials allege Milton abused the SPAC process by using social media and other mediums to continually spew lies and misleading information about the company directly to retail investors.Nikola is one of at least three electric vehicle start-ups being investigated by federal agencies about potentially misleading investors.https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/02/nikola-founder-criminal-charges-puts-other-spacs-on-notice.html
Thats a reallllll lot of money spent shorts to do absolutely NOTHING!
"So which company is going to buy Workhorse trucks? GM's Brightdrop is building for FedEx. Rivian is building for Amazon, WKHS burned the UPS relationship with 1st Gen trucks that had to be repaired under warranty so they went with Arrival. OshKosh has the USPS contract for now. Be careful what you wish for if the judge reopens the competition for the contract, there are now multiple companies building electric vehicles that didn't exist in 2015 when the original competition started."

"""Workhorse: Burning cash, making few vehiclesOn paper, Workhorse has several sources of future income lined up. It has a private sector order for 6,320 electric delivery trucks from Pride Group Enterprises. If its June 16 legal complaint to capture an initial $482 million production design contract awarded to Oshkosh Corp. (NYSE:OSK) succeeds, it would also have an inside track to a broader $6 billion in total purchases of electric USPS delivery vehicles over 10 years. However, while either of these could yield profits in the future, Workhorse has delivered very few vehicles to date.Besides its current minuscule production capacity, Workhorse's 13 years in business have been mostly sustained by periodic investments, not revenue. Workhorse has secured multiple rounds of funding adding up to over $300 million, including a $70 million cash infusion from an institutional investor announced on July 20, 2020, and $200 million through an Oct. 12, 2020, bond issue to several institutions.The company's revenue, meanwhile, remains well below $1 million per quarter. During Q1 2021, its revenue totaled $521,000, a 520% year-over-year increase resulting from ""a total of six trucks delivered in the first quarter.""Operational expenses in the millions combined with revenue in the thousands lead to ongoing cash burn. Workhorse reported negative cash flow of $36.2 million during Q1 2021, reducing its available cash from $241.2 million at the quarter's start to approximately $205.1 million at its end. With current cash burn rates, Workhorse has reserves for just over five more quarters of operation, a number possibly lowered by accelerating cash burn if it pushes production up to a dozen trucks per quarter."""
Shares borrowed = 384K. Still green!
"THESE ARE SOME OF THE FINANCIAL CATALYSTS GOING FORWARD FOR WKHS!! WKHS has 8,000 vans on back order.At approximately $52,000 per van that is$416,000,000 WKHS has approx 50(actually there are more) vans done and ready for delivery. At $50,000 per van that is$2,500,000 Not in the equation is WKHS drone delivery system. This is pending approval by the FAA late this year.WKHS owns multiple patents that separate them from their competitors.Only 1 of WKHS's competitors currently has FAA approved for delivery and thats for only packages of 5 lbs or less.WKHS offers more weight(10 lbs) and flights directly from the delivery truck maximizing the number of deliveries. The future financial numbers here dont do justice to the current price per share. And why you ask is the share price so depressed. It's mostly because WKHS is shorted approx 40% of the float. The most of just about any stock on the market. Underneath alllll of this is there appears to be a good possibility that some or all of the USPS/OSK contract will be rescinded.As always do your DD!!"
Classic share dump in the morning and now the shorts have to buy back all the shares they shorted for the illusion. Either the price gets back to 10 or shorts fail to buy all the shares they just shorted and short interest goes up.
Another green day 
"FUN FACTS ABOUT WORKHORSECurrently has 8,000 DELIVERY VANS on back order. At a market price of approx $52,000 thats $412 million on order.Almost 1/2 billion dollarsWorkhouse currently has 50-60 ready to deliver DELIVERY VANS at its Union City plant.Another $2-3 millionWorkhorse has drone delivery system call Horsefly.This drone system delivers PACKAGES directly from their DELIVERY VANS maximizing deliveries.Currently they is only 1 other company that has FAA clearance in the US to deliver PACKAGES.However those drones can only deliver PACKAGES half the weight of Horsefly and cant deliver from DELIVERY VANS.Horsefly will have FAA clearance by years end.Workhorse just hired a new CEO that has a number of years in the automotive industry.Workhorse is currently redesigning their DELIVERY VANS to at the request of some customers handle more payload.This of course will attract more customers"

We have a long run way. Other MEME stocks like GME 25% up but have traded 3x their daily average volume. WKHS is 6% up but has only traded half their daily average volume. It will be 36% up when it trades 3x it’s daily volume at this rate!

That $10 must have really scared the goof shorts. Shorting 90% of the volume just shows panic and desperation. LOVE to see that.... Overall short interest jumped up over 1% in just the first 15 min of trading. That is incredible. It does leave the question of where they got the shares from though? Considering utilization has been at 100% for the last 2 weeks it sure seems fishy.... Maybe the SEC seriously needs to have a quick look into what's going on with this stock... Feel free to email them and give them some encouragement to do their jobs
"2 Million shares worth call options in the $10-$11 range might explain why they fight that $10 so hard. I would assume most of them are sold as naked calls by the market makers..... If they were to buy the shares as the calls end up in the money, that alone would be another $5-$10 bump."
20 shares on the drop
$20 by Friday
Look into XOS similar company with a lot of potential. 20$ price target trading in the 6’s currently…

So why did this drops from $10.25 to $9.70 ???

Did that turn out how you expected shorts? Digging hundreds of thousands of short shares deeper into the hole just for the dip to be bought up by longs and $WKHS to end up nicely? You dip$hits are so predictable. Are you going to be able to sleep at night knowing the losses you'll face when forced to cover?

"So we are dusting off the old HorseFly again. May as well dust off the old Surefly LmaoThey should be concerned, frankly. During a second, unofficial demonstration of the HorseFly for UPS on Monday, some sort of interference – possibly from the broadcast reporters’ cameras -caused an issue with the drone’s compass. The drone aborted its launch, tried to land on top of the UPS truck, fell to the side and was nearly crushed by the still-closing lid of the vehicle.“We’ve never seen it before,” said Burns, of the glitch.Beyond working out the technical kinks, companies like UPS and Amazon, which is building its own delivery drones, have to think about how they want to integrate this technology into their workforce, especially if it comes at the cost of people’s jobs or paid hourly work. UPS, for what it’s worth, says it doesn’t see driver jobs going away. “UPS drivers are the face of the organization. Customers depend on them,” says Dodero.“We have to be competitive. All we’re doing here is eliminating miles the driver could potentially have to drive,” he explains. “Our goal is not to replace UPS drivers…we just want to enhance their capabilities and make them more efficient.”"
Shorts are REALLY scared of $10..... My guess is they are already lacking shares to satisfy all the $9 and $9.50 calls expiring tomorrow. If it gets to $10 they will be short some 2 million shares that they will have to buy immediately at market price and thus pushing the share price up even more.... That is how Gamma squeezes start :)
Some here are saying that people are being paid to post about WKHS. Hope everyone realizes that what's said here has no influence whatever on the movement of WKHS stock. Volume is about 18 million share per day. The people here aren't doing anything on a scale that would affect the price for more than a minute or two. I see most people saying they have a few thousand shares short or long. That's meaningless.
"With existing orders and ramping up production under new management, stock should be around $15 on December 31."
if rivian worth 70b you know the rest its simple as it is just buy as much as you can
484k shares shorted now. It's literally the only way this goes red. No one is selling their actual shares. Every drop is a short dump which shares they have to replace and which completely negates the dump by the time they get them replaced. This is funny to watch.
So we get a green day AND short interest goes up? I cheer about that.
"What are the shorts going to do? Looks like they are out of ammo and we are pushing $10. Do they mortgage their future and go all in, or do they let this stock run organically?"
The SHORT AND DISTORT CAMPAIGN is failing. They have literally shorted 90% of the volume so far today for a few pennies in the red. ahahahab
Why go short when the potential for even greater gains is to go long?
bought more shares today at the dip lol
We need some heavy buyers to get this to $11 by eow

He later earned dual Master of Science degrees in Management and Engineering from MIT."
Exchange reported short interest as of 8/31/2021 is due to FINRA by Thursday of this week. That report should get WKHS some more exposure and could be a trigger if a short squeeze were to happen.

"Judging by the pre-market, it could be that some of the shorts are trying to beat the herd to the covering trough. No one likes losing money, but if you have to book a loss, least is best. I’m also glad some will wait, they’ll give us the pop and squeeze."

Large fleet customers may take delivery in late 2018 and full production will begin in 2019.The company is finalizing its supply chain network and will conduct final assembly of the trucks at its plant in Union City, Ind.Differences between the concept and the production W-15 are subtle.

Wow look at all the negatives. Shorts are scared. Im glad im not holding a short position and workhorse.
The smarter shorts are already rotating out of their positions as quietly as possible. Newer shorts are still doubling down. This will not go well for them.

Workhorse is the only EV in it's class with both CERB (California clean Air resources board) and HVIP (Hybrid and zero emissions Truck Voucher) certifications. That means the government will pay up to 55k to a company for purchasing a workhorse van. WKHS is still multiple years ahead of any competition. Obviously nobody else is as close to an automated drone assistant either.....
"I am finding this MB getting more childish and am quitting visiting here. Anyway, goodluck to longs as am part of it. cheers"
"It's really too late for shorts at this point, spiraling out of their control. The true stock valuation is significantly higher than the currently artificially depressed price. It is a massive market disconnect. Shorts can't keep that charade going any longer. Their only choices are 1) Cover now or 2) Cover and flip to long and burn their competing shorts that are too slow."
"Mike Shlisky (D.A. Davidson)...So I was just little bit confused, guys. So you've got 8,000 orders here. So 8,000 folks, in the case of Pritchard or Pride Group, 8,000 orders worth of people have seen the truck, they've seen the spec sheet that you gave them before, they've test driven the truck and they said, Yes, I want to drive that. In the case of Pritchard and Pride, I can definitely sell that as you put it to me. And now you're saying that, that's not the case, but they signed binding orders to take these vehicles. And I'm a little confused as to how -- as to kind of what has changed since they actually signed their binding orders that they're not going to get their orders and actually they're going to get an entirely different product. Have any of the competitors out there put out a much higher payload vehicle within the same class as for past week having a great payload, if not one of the best ones out there today. So what's changed that have really caused you to make this design switch here?Rick Dauch, CEOYes, Mike, good question. So that's one of the things I'm going to clarify with the team, with the customers. Like I've had introductory calls with Pride and Pritchard, a couple of others this week, talked to Chris, our Head of Sales and on to the factory. I need to understand that mix, okay? We'll see, okay? At the end of the day, the vehicle that we have designed doesn't quite meet the specs we want to get from a payload. It's a little heavy versus what we can carry, okay? So we got to figure out just how big the market is for a lower payload right now and how fast we can then tweak our designs and improve our vehicle dynamics to meet the higher payload requirements, right?"
I wonder does any one remember the bidding process on a government contract called JEDI?The goverment asked for bids from multiple companies on cloud computing software for the Deparrment of Defense.Its pretty recent as a matter of fact the ruling for the case came down in JulyThe JEDI project was a 10 billion dollar project that was initially given to Microsoft.In the end the Penagon canceled the bid because it found there was political interfere with the bidding process and gave the contract to Amazon.I wonder what will happen in the court system to a bidding process on a goverment contract that has both political interfere and fraud?
Well I sure enjoyed the excitement we will see what happens @ 3pm
Borrowed shares up to 1 Million this morning and in the green.
Slow and steady wins the race and then we take off to the moon .
Amazing Price movement...We are seeing $10 today
Wow!!! Bearish Bot and Bobo you guys did a great job today keep up the good work!!!!BTW Mattel is coming out with a Barbie delivery van 2 years from now. It should be direct competition to Workhorse.
1.4 million shares shorted today 1 million returned. Shorts burrying themselves with 400k more Shorts outstanding and it's green.....
another 50% up and I'll break even lol.
"Borrowed shares now 1.25M. Shorts are selling their cars, kids, everything."
another pop coming...
"ORAL ARGUMENT between WKHS vs. USA is scheduled for September 15th, 2021, 2:00pm in Washington DC. BE THERE, AND BE RICH! Even if you don't attend, we'll still be rich! When this thing blows to the cosmos , I'm buying a miniature horse and riding it downtown. WHO'S WITH ME!!"
The company delivered another set of abysmal quarterly results well below consensus expectations. Free cash flow was negative $48.4 million.The company's core C-1000 truck offering requires extensive redesign due to inadequate payload capacity.Delay in production ramp-up likely to result in Workhorse violating debt covenants at the end of Q1/2022.
Shorts care to give us another opportunity to buy more shares? I love loading up when you are digging your financial graves.
Looks like we got trashed at the end again.....These shorts are going to pay dearly and I hope it starts tomorrow and pushing this into $10.30 range and Thurs./Fri. follow thru past $11....If that happens we are set for that squeeze I think
"Lovin’ it…never thought investing could be so exhilarating. These levels make the risk minimal, the reward (likely) immense. Thanks shorts! Also, shorts, you can always turn away from the dark side."
all that work shorts put in over the last week to cover 200k shares just to end up deeper in the hole with more outstanding shorts then at the start of the week and a higher share price still. Gotta love that. haha
"Shorts added 377K shares net to the short count so far today. Now that they brought the price down, let's see how much they cover before the close."
380K shares shorted that are being bought up by diamond hands!
Shorts added a net 245K shares to their short position today and we still ended up green! They borrowed a total of 1.15M shares today.
"Touches red and I'm buying the $%^& out of this. Will be explosive when the dam breaks and right now shorts are still digging themselves in deeper. The deeper they dig, the more they'll pay us to cover in the end."
"History Oct 2020Workhorse Group: Now Is Not The Time To Short, But The Wait Might Not Be LongSummaryWorkhorse stock is up by a staggering 780% this year, which is a stark contrast to its financial performance.A multi-billion-dollar USPS contract is at the center of this price movement, and Workhorse might end up winning a partial contract.Even in the best-case scenario, Workhorse might still find it difficult to live up to the expectations of investors from a financial performance perspective.Workhorse is heading toward rough seashttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4378870-workhorse-group-now-is-not-time-to-short-wait-might-not-be-long"
From a post on Stocktwits: Workhorse will be at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo in Long Beach California starting tomorrow Aug. 30 through Sept. 3It is the largest Commercial EV trade show of the year and basically everyone with anything to do with Commercial EV has a booth there. The notable exception is EAVX who is giving a presentation on Tuesday about Last Mile Delivery but doesn't have a booth. Their Strategic Development Partner Workhorse does have a booth and I'm really hoping for a new jointly developed vehicle to be announced tomorrow to kick off the show.
Looks like some whales jumped in
To bring the price down to where it is the shorts had to short 2x all the shares that they had managed to cover over the last week. hahah this is good!!
Just released: “ Workhorse and Amerit Fleet Solutions Partner to Provide Comprehensive Maintenance and Repair Services To Support Customers“
"Imagine not increasing your position before 45 million exchange reported short shares (plus tens of millions of likely naked short shares) are forced to cover. That buying pressure will drive this share price sharply higher as it is currently a huge market disconnect due to the highest SI in the entire market for an innovative American tech company with OVER 5000% revenue growth, flush with cash and orders, and new markets coming on line."
"The House Oversight and Reform Committee is demanding that the U.S. Postal Service release a contract with a private company for a new delivery vehicle fleet that is reportedly worth up to $6 billion.Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) sent a letter to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy on Friday voicing several concerns about potential interference and asking for documents relating to a contract with Oshkosh Defense.......President Joe Biden pledged in January to replace the U.S. government fleet with electric models......However, the U.S. Postal Service in February awarded Oshkosh Corp. a 10-year contract over competitor Workhorse Group Inc. to manufacture as many as 165,000 vehicles, with USPS saying that about 10% of the vehicles would be electric. Democrats have criticized the contract for not including more electric vehicles, and a lawsuit is pending from Workhorse......... According to Maloney, the contract was a ""surprise announcement"".......In her letter, Maloney voiced concerns that the vehicles would not be fuel efficient. The New York lawmaker noted that part of President Biden's plan to combat climate change is to transition to a fully electric fleet. Maloney wrote that Oshkosh submitted a prototype with a gasoline engine despite prototypes from competitors incorporating electric powertrains. The initial announcement claimed that Oshkosh's vehicles would be fuel efficient or contain electric powertrains......Maloney voiced additional concerns about the contract, pointing to a report from Bloomberg News that alleges an unknown party purchased $54.2 million worth of stock in Oshkosh the night before the deal was announced........ August 19th 2021 Carolyn B Maloney: ""Just spoke to the President about the importance of electrifying the USPS and how it’s one my priorities. Good news? He’s on board. Looking forward to working with him to make this dream become a reality. Stay tuned for more on this!!""......Democratic lawmakers are seeking money for federal fleet and USPS electrification to be part of the $3.5 trillion tax and spending package.......Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif) said he expects broad congressional support for including funding for electrification of the postal fleet in the $3.5 trillion reconciliation package. Huffman introduced a bill (H.R.1636) in March to provide $6 billion to electrify the postal fleet........"
The shorts ran all over this in less than 45 minutes
Short interest is up by 720k shares just today so far for a nice 1% increase in short interest on the free float. LOVE to see the shorts are still working on burying themselves and fueling our rocketship :)
Lion keeps making newshttps://www.trucknews.com/sustainability/ikea-goods-to-move-by-lion-electric-trucks/1003150475/
Anybody wanna take a shot where these vehicles are that Tiny Wkhs told members of congress they made and testing in several areas. Imafed said in previous post they misspoke LFAORulli said the senators learned Friday the company has between 400 and 500 U.S. Postal Service trucks built that are being road-tested in several areas to see how they perform in various weather conditions and terrains.
Video on Reddit showing WKHS moving new product on the lot. Production continues despite what the shorts are claiming.
"BEARISH BOT and BOBO why is it the 2 of you cant offer any directly competing DELIVERY VANS to Workhorse other than EV versions of trucks, 18 wheelers, buses, cars, scooters, tricycles, razors etc???NONE of these companies you present are in direct competition.1 week ago you offered 1 DELIVERY VAN by a company currently using it to deliver beer.A company with only 1 prototype truck which is over 1 year from production just like Oshkosh. Your proof, and logic are very poor. Lets go on to the drones.You've offered so called competing companies where the drones are being utilized for something completely different other than PACKAGE delivery, are flying in other countries and have no FAA clearance to fly in the USA to deliver PACKAGES.Only 1 company in the USA has an FAA clearance to deliver PACKAGES. And that company can only deliver PACKAGES 1/2 the weight of Horsefly. Plus it cant deliver directly from their delivery van like WKHS which maximizes the amount of deliveries.To add to this that company is currently laying off personal because of the restrictions on the size and weight of the PACKAGES it can delivery. Again your proof and logic are very poor!"
Should I add 1000 shares before it reaches 10? :)
Fake news. I had to Imafed. LMAOhttps://rvbusiness.com/demand-fuels-workhorse-return-to-rv-sector-2/
EVs are herehttps://www.trucknews.com/sustainability/electric-trucks-the-future-of-zero-emissions-transport-but-more-immediate-action-needed/1003150716/
"Anyone lnow the latest on how many shares the shorts have borrowed to create the illusion that WKHS is dipping? Also, congrats to all of you who are buying this manufactured dip. I’m going to go buy a little more now if it stays down, but I bought a chunk yesterday."
"It’s interesting to note the ‘honor among thieves’ element taking shape here. The shorts have to be torn at this point…does one try to hold the line at tremendous risk, or do they cover early, before the rest of the herd, effectively driving the price up for everyone. The APES and longs here have already demonstrated their collective resolve…."
"Did Workhorse’s onetime partner, VT Hackney Inc., backout due to chronic “critical failures and breakdowns” in USPS test vehicles?"
Time for the shorts to sell their golf clubs…
Short interest will update tomorrow

"CINCINNATI, Aug. 31, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Workhorse Group Inc. (NASDAQ: WKHS) (“Workhorse” or “the Company”), an American technology company focused on providing sustainable and cost-effective drone-integrated electric vehicles to the last mile delivery sector, and Amerit Fleet Solutions (“Amerit”), a provider of customized fleet maintenance and repair programs nationwide, announced today that they have entered into an agreement for Amerit to provide warranty and demand repair programs to Workhorse customers nationwide.Under the terms of the agreement, the two companies will jointly provide maintenance service programs for electric and clean fuel technologies. Both parties will work toward integrating operational, maintenance and fleet data into an accessible portal allowing for real-time tracking and expedited response times.“The last mile delivery market requires solutions that optimize uptime. Partnering with Amerit, a leader in customized maintenance services, enables us to do just that,” said Workhorse CEO Rick Dauch. “Our vehicles and connected insights, combined with Amerit’s mobile service network and innovative maintenance solutions, provides Workhorse with the ability to offer a comprehensive and customized EV experience for our customers.”"
Shorts are as sharp as an apple.
"Let me save the shorts some typing. No serious long investor is selling any where close to this share price. Workhorse is an innovative American tech disruptor with over 5000% revenue growth, 8000 last mile EV orders and identified 1000 to 2000 more on the way, a new industry icon CEO who has done his homework on the company prior to coming on board, flush with enough cash without additional revenue to fuel operations for a couple of years, with vehicle mounted drone delivery patents, new drone agreements with the US government, and impending FAA approval for drone delivery (45 of 45 perfect delivery testing in varied conditions), very positive response from the judge potentially getting them back into at least some of the USPS contract, and more catalysts in the pipeline. The over 40% reported SI (who knows how high with naked shorting) and increasing cost buy is just an enticing cherry on top."
Slowly Creeping up.. well be above 10 solidly this week
currently up over 12% in the last 5 days
chance of short squeeze never been this high just depends on how much we buy I think reddit can be really helpful
I placed a mega-HUGE option bet on #WKHS yesterday. Look at this incredible chart setup: https://chart-analysis.tools/WKHS
To the moon we go
Shares borrowed = 1.46M.
Congress Should Not Interfere With Mail Truck Purchaseshttps://www.trucks.com/2021/07/19/electric-mail-truck-debate-congress/
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
"Besrish Bot.....you do realize there are more companies that use delivery vans that Fed Ex and UPS dont you?WKHS already has $412 million dollars in orders.So $412 million is not credible????Amazon went with Rivian to deliver 100,000 by 2030.Do you have any idea when the first of those will deliver.THE END OF 2022 BEGINNING 2023!!!AGAIN ANOTHER COMPANY DELIVERING OVER 1 YEAR AWAY!Do you have ANY company that can deliver now???JUST 1 WILL DO!!!"
"The drone is a complete non-starter. The company can't build trucks. The drone effort was a ploy to have a partnership with a university to give this company some veneer of technological prowess. Besides, the genius who came up with the name horsefly should be fired. Who in their right mind names a product for a flying biting pest? I think it was a sick joke that Steve Burns played on shareholders."
Shorts are throwing all their shares at this early..... We all know they will be out of ammo soon here lol short utilization has been 100% for the entire 2 weeks that it's slowly been climbing up.....
I sense a big day for the WorkHorse...Never seen A/H this high with futures all green also.....Ride it high HORSE....
What is the name the Expo WKHS is participating this weekend in SOCAL?

FAA approved coming by years end.Only one other company currently has FAA clearence and it can only deliver half the weight. A company with one the LARGEST short positions in the market.

"Have to give these shorts credit, they have some huge balls. Shorting an innovative American tech disruptor with over 5000% revenue growth, 8000 last mile EV orders and identified 1000 to 2000 more on the way, a new industry icon CEO who has done his homework on the company prior to coming on board, flush with enough cash without additional revenue to fuel operations for a couple of years, with vehicle mounted drone delivery patents, new drone agreements with the US government, and impending FAA approval for drone delivery (45 of 45 perfect delivery testing in varied conditions), very positive response from the judge potentially getting them back into at least some of the USPS contract, and more catalysts in the pipeline."
