chance of short squeeze never been this high just depends on how much we buy I think reddit can be really helpful
Shorts borrowed an additional 135k shares to dump at market close. No longs are selling.... Don't be fooled. BUY and HODL. Rinse and repeat.

"any hope to gain any orders from USPS for Workhorse? Any idea?, Thanks"
Does Lordstown stand to benefit ifWorkhorse gets any part of the USPS contract.I had read on Bloomberg about some right of refusal licensing deal it had with Workhorse.Anyone familiar with this?
"This share price is now the BIGGEST DISCONECT IN THE ENTIRE MARKET. $WKHS has intensely consolidated to smart money which has continued to add shares on the daily short attacks for now 2 months’ worth of 30% to 60% daily short volume. Yet Workhorse is an innovative American tech disruptor with over 5000% revenue growth, 8000 last mile EV orders and identified 1000 to 2000 more on the way, a new industry icon CEO who has done his homework on the company prior to coming on board, flush with enough cash without additional revenue to fuel operations for a couple of years, with vehicle mounted drone delivery patents, new drone agreements with the US government, and impending FAA approval for drone delivery (45 of 45 perfect delivery testing in varied conditions), very positive response from the judge potentially getting them back into at least some of the USPS contract, and more catalysts in the pipeline."
"So we are dusting off the old HorseFly again. May as well dust off the old Surefly LmaoThey should be concerned, frankly. During a second, unofficial demonstration of the HorseFly for UPS on Monday, some sort of interference – possibly from the broadcast reporters’ cameras -caused an issue with the drone’s compass. The drone aborted its launch, tried to land on top of the UPS truck, fell to the side and was nearly crushed by the still-closing lid of the vehicle.“We’ve never seen it before,” said Burns, of the glitch.Beyond working out the technical kinks, companies like UPS and Amazon, which is building its own delivery drones, have to think about how they want to integrate this technology into their workforce, especially if it comes at the cost of people’s jobs or paid hourly work. UPS, for what it’s worth, says it doesn’t see driver jobs going away. “UPS drivers are the face of the organization. Customers depend on them,” says Dodero.“We have to be competitive. All we’re doing here is eliminating miles the driver could potentially have to drive,” he explains. “Our goal is not to replace UPS drivers…we just want to enhance their capabilities and make them more efficient.”"

"All that shorting, just to end up being buried more in debt with shares that longs are going to want $100s of dollars for.... Now that's HILARIOUS!! HAHA"
"Probably best not to believe everything from Fuzzy Panda, but the fact that FedEx and UPSwent with other manufacturers does add credibility to there being quality issues.https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/workhorse-falls-on-short-seller-claim-ev-maker-misled-investors"

"What is clear from initial customer feedback is that we need to further increase the payload capacity of our vehicles. Although there are niche market opportunities for the lower payload vehicle, those opportunities are limited. The majority of our customers needs a higher payload vehicle, which serves a much larger market segment. Our engineering teams are already hard at work on the revised design of the C1000....We recognize that there is a lot of work still to be done and likely difficult decisions ahead to position our company for long-term success.During the question-of-answer session, analysts were apparently perplexed by the previously undisclosed payload issue and the resulting requirement to rework the design of the company's core C-1000 BEV truck, particularly after the new CEO admitted that the problem has been known internally for quite some time already.Not surprisingly, management had to bear some tough questions:Mike Shlisky (D.A. Davidson)...So I was just little bit confused, guys. So you've got 8,000 orders here. So 8,000 folks, in the case of Pritchard or Pride Group, 8,000 orders worth of people have seen the truck, they've seen the spec sheet that you gave them before, they've test driven the truck and they said, Yes, I want to drive that. In the case of Pritchard and Pride, I can definitely sell that as you put it to me. And now you're saying that, that's not the case, but they signed binding orders to take these vehicles. And I'm a little confused as to how -- as to kind of what has changed since they actually signed their binding orders that they're not going to get their orders and actually they're going to get an entirely different product. Have any of the competitors out there put out a much higher payload vehicle within the same class as for past week having a great payload, if not one of the best ones out there today. So what's changed that have really caused you to make this design switch here?Rick Dauch, CEOYes, Mike, good question. So that's one of the things I'm going to clarify with the team, with the customers. Like I've had introductory calls with Pride and Pritchard, a couple of others this week, talked to Chris, our Head of Sales and on to the factory. I need to understand that mix, okay? We'll see, okay? At the end of the day, the vehicle that we have designed doesn't quite meet the specs we want to get from a payload. It's a little heavy versus what we can carry, okay? So we got to figure out just how big the market is for a lower payload right now and how fast we can then tweak our designs and improve our vehicle dynamics to meet the higher payload requirements, right?"
"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Fairstox.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I don’t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"
"New CEO Dauch’s corporate career was preceded by his service as an officer in the United States Army, including qualification as an Airborne Ranger and concluding with his assignment as a Light Infantry Company Commander in the 10th Mountain Division. This service followed his graduation from the United States Military Academy at West Point with a bachelor’s degree in Engineering. He later earned dual Master of Science degrees in Management and Engineering from MIT."
"The tighter we hold, the higher this can go..."
Workhorse is the only EV in it's class with both CERB (California clean Air resources board) and HVIP (Hybrid and zero emissions Truck Voucher) certifications. That means the government will pay up to 55k to a company for purchasing a workhorse van. WKHS is still multiple years ahead of any competition. Obviously nobody else is as close to an automated drone assistant either.....
"So which company is going to buy Workhorse trucks? GM's Brightdrop is building for FedEx. Rivian is building for Amazon, WKHS burned the UPS relationship with 1st Gen trucks that had to be repaired under warranty so they went with Arrival. OshKosh has the USPS contract for now. Be careful what you wish for if the judge reopens the competition for the contract, there are now multiple companies building electric vehicles that didn't exist in 2015 when the original competition started."
"Anyone lnow the latest on how many shares the shorts have borrowed to create the illusion that WKHS is dipping? Also, congrats to all of you who are buying this manufactured dip. I’m going to go buy a little more now if it stays down, but I bought a chunk yesterday."
"Besrish Bot.....you do realize there are more companies that use delivery vans that Fed Ex and UPS dont you?WKHS already has $412 million dollars in orders.So $412 million is not credible????Amazon went with Rivian to deliver 100,000 by 2030.Do you have any idea when the first of those will deliver.THE END OF 2022 BEGINNING 2023!!!AGAIN ANOTHER COMPANY DELIVERING OVER 1 YEAR AWAY!Do you have ANY company that can deliver now???JUST 1 WILL DO!!!"
Borrowed shares up to 1 Million this morning and in the green.
Wow look at all the negatives. Shorts are scared. Im glad im not holding a short position and workhorse.
"Oshkosh up more than WKHS, there just is no justice in this life.Then again, Oshkosh isn't parking unsold vehicles, or having to redesign."
"BEARISH BOT and BOBO why is it the 2 of you cant offer any directly competing DELIVERY VANS to Workhorse other than EV versions of trucks, 18 wheelers, buses, cars, scooters, tricycles, razors etc???NONE of these companies you present are in direct competition.1 week ago you offered 1 DELIVERY VAN by a company currently using it to deliver beer.A company with only 1 prototype truck which is over 1 year from production just like Oshkosh. Your proof, and logic are very poor. Lets go on to the drones.You've offered so called competing companies where the drones are being utilized for something completely different other than PACKAGE delivery, are flying in other countries and have no FAA clearance to fly in the USA to deliver PACKAGES.Only 1 company in the USA has an FAA clearance to deliver PACKAGES. And that company can only deliver PACKAGES 1/2 the weight of Horsefly. Plus it cant deliver directly from their delivery van like WKHS which maximizes the amount of deliveries.To add to this that company is currently laying off personal because of the restrictions on the size and weight of the PACKAGES it can delivery. Again your proof and logic are very poor!"
How many trucks were actually delivered toUnited Parcel Service?
Shorts are throwing all their shares at this early..... We all know they will be out of ammo soon here lol short utilization has been 100% for the entire 2 weeks that it's slowly been climbing up.....
"This is the next TESLA! This is the ONLY manufacturer in the world that offers drone -ready electric commercial last-mile delivery. Get ready for $3000 a share. It might take 5-7 years, but it will hit that price if you are patient."
"The House Oversight and Reform Committee is demanding that the U.S. Postal Service release a contract with a private company for a new delivery vehicle fleet that is reportedly worth up to $6 billion.Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) sent a letter to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy on Friday voicing several concerns about potential interference and asking for documents relating to a contract with Oshkosh Defense.......President Joe Biden pledged in January to replace the U.S. government fleet with electric models......However, the U.S. Postal Service in February awarded Oshkosh Corp. a 10-year contract over competitor Workhorse Group Inc. to manufacture as many as 165,000 vehicles, with USPS saying that about 10% of the vehicles would be electric. Democrats have criticized the contract for not including more electric vehicles, and a lawsuit is pending from Workhorse......... According to Maloney, the contract was a ""surprise announcement"".......In her letter, Maloney voiced concerns that the vehicles would not be fuel efficient. The New York lawmaker noted that part of President Biden's plan to combat climate change is to transition to a fully electric fleet. Maloney wrote that Oshkosh submitted a prototype with a gasoline engine despite prototypes from competitors incorporating electric powertrains. The initial announcement claimed that Oshkosh's vehicles would be fuel efficient or contain electric powertrains......Maloney voiced additional concerns about the contract, pointing to a report from Bloomberg News that alleges an unknown party purchased $54.2 million worth of stock in Oshkosh the night before the deal was announced........ August 19th 2021 Carolyn B Maloney: ""Just spoke to the President about the importance of electrifying the USPS and how it’s one my priorities. Good news? He’s on board. Looking forward to working with him to make this dream become a reality. Stay tuned for more on this!!""......Democratic lawmakers are seeking money for federal fleet and USPS electrification to be part of the $3.5 trillion tax and spending package.......Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif) said he expects broad congressional support for including funding for electrification of the postal fleet in the $3.5 trillion reconciliation package. Huffman introduced a bill (H.R.1636) in March to provide $6 billion to electrify the postal fleet........"
Short shares borrowed up to 1.13 Million since 7am. Doubled the borrowed shares since my last report.
"From July 2011 to July 2012 Netflix stock lost 80% of its value. This was on the back of concerns over execution.Since then it has made a return over 4600%Wkhs had lost 80% from peak to trough.With the wonderful (and desperate) amount of shirt interest, together with the changing narrative of the company and EV last mile delivery, patented drone tech. We have ourselves a pioneer in the industry like netflix was ten years ago. History does not always repeat, but it rhymes. "

"Did Workhorse’s onetime partner, VT Hackney Inc., backout due to chronic “critical failures and breakdowns” in USPS test vehicles?"
"FUN FACTS ABOUT WORKHORSECurrently has 8,000 DELIVERY VANS on back order. At a market price of approx $52,000 thats $412 million on order.Almost 1/2 billion dollarsWorkhouse currently has 50-60 ready to deliver DELIVERY VANS at its Union City plant.Another $2-3 millionWorkhorse has drone delivery system call Horsefly.This drone system delivers PACKAGES directly from their DELIVERY VANS maximizing deliveries.Currently they is only 1 other company that has FAA clearance in the US to deliver PACKAGES.However those drones can only deliver PACKAGES half the weight of Horsefly and cant deliver from DELIVERY VANS.Horsefly will have FAA clearance by years end.Workhorse just hired a new CEO that has a number of years in the automotive industry.Workhorse is currently redesigning their DELIVERY VANS to at the request of some customers handle more payload.This of course will attract more customers"
To the moon we go
Short interest will update tomorrow
Some here are saying that people are being paid to post about WKHS. Hope everyone realizes that what's said here has no influence whatever on the movement of WKHS stock. Volume is about 18 million share per day. The people here aren't doing anything on a scale that would affect the price for more than a minute or two. I see most people saying they have a few thousand shares short or long. That's meaningless.
"The drone is a complete non-starter. The company can't build trucks. The drone effort was a ploy to have a partnership with a university to give this company some veneer of technological prowess. Besides, the genius who came up with the name horsefly should be fired. Who in their right mind names a product for a flying biting pest? I think it was a sick joke that Steve Burns played on shareholders."
"short squeeze is so close here, time to load more!"
Anybody wanna take a shot where these vehicles are that Tiny Wkhs told members of congress they made and testing in several areas. Imafed said in previous post they misspoke LFAORulli said the senators learned Friday the company has between 400 and 500 U.S. Postal Service trucks built that are being road-tested in several areas to see how they perform in various weather conditions and terrains.
