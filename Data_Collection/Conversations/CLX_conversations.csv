I heard about CLX the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"195 seems like a good entry point. Next earnings have to be superb, all those wipes missing from the shelves mean something!"
Any near term catalysts?
"What does one expect this to drop to???(from the video on yahoo) Estimate was $7.60 with low end revision to $5.40(upper$5.70)... if my math is right that's 28%-25% reduction in expected earnings.SO, would one consider the pre-drop price of $181 minus a 25% ($45) discount...Set a buy price at $136?I don't see it going that low... Thoughts?"
The question is whether there are fundamental changes in the company.I’m a buyer @ $160.
"Btw those of you wondering if the sales wont be that spectacular because of clorox not being just about cleaning products, a but of a clarification.Clorox is 34%, 20% ""lifestyle"", 30% household and 16% international. From lifestyle, over half of it is water filters and food products, both in at least normal demand.In household, almost half of that are their bags and containers (Glad) which are in higher demand, not as sold out as cleaning but still shelves were half empty for a month. Cat litter might have more than usual sales as well since people will be at home more and pay attention to their cats.Only charcoals sales are down.Then of course have cleaning products with a demand that goes beyond their production 24/7. Two months of products flying off the shelves.Currently Clorox has 33 products that are confirmed by the FDA to kill the coronavirus. These are sold out from March to December, easily. The revenue from these (which in 2019 accounted for 34% of total revenue) this yr will probably increase 200%.The demand also is probably making them save in advertisement and marketing."
This is the only stock i feel safe buying...
"Merck pulling out of the vaccine race, Moderna working on a booster to handle S. Africa Covid mutation. CLX going to be needed for a while."
Time for a new CEO
"Does anyone realize this is just a Wall Street game? How can a stock like this get hammered and stay down? IT WON'T! If you're shorting this stock since this morning, you have a lot to learn. I'm not saying that in a disparaging way at all. I am old enough to know what I'm talking about. Go back to just a 1 year chart (even 2 years) and what do you see? The BIG MONEY is just playing with the little money. Until you realize what happens every freaking day the market is open, you will never know how to trade this market. Look at the news that is happening and tell me why this stock will not be over 170 in short order. The SMART money needs to bring this price down by getting everyone else to SELL. That's how they go in and then BUY LOW and screw the DUMB MONEY out of a PERFECT TRADE set up. I'm sorry for rambling on..., but I have lived thru a few BEAR and BULL markets. I believe this stock will be at $164.57 by tomorrow and then continue on to $179 by the end of next week. Best wishes to everyone and happy trading!"
"If Clorox is sold out on-line, in stores, everywhere...How fast do they replenish stock??? If they don't have stock, they can't sell...They don't sell... They make no money...Does anybody know a source that shows replenishment of stock or where Clorox wipes are being made? The lack of stock would seem to show that production is not local... Any ideas???"
Bought at $160.50…long and strong 
"This isn't a wide moat company, it's a collection of mostly replaceable brands. A few have value sure, but collectively this is narrow moat company. The other knock is it's too small to navigate the global trading environment of today. PG and CL are my CPG picks. They have the scale and balance sheet to weather the next 1-2 years of choppy trading."
"I've been going around airline stocks forums and there is so much wishful thinking. No fundamentals, just wishes.At the end all that matters is the revenue and the profits.And Clorox is having record breaking numbers in both."
"From Best Life article yesterday Aug 3 by Sarah Crow:On Monday, Aug. 3, Clorox CEO Benno Dorer told Reuters that the brand's disinfecting wipes likely wouldn't be fully restocked by retailers until 2021.Calling them ""the hottest commodity in the business right now,"" Dorer said that it will be quite a while before the supply of wipes catches up with demand because it requires ""a very complex supply chain to make them."" According to Reuters, polyester spunlace—the material used to make Clorox wipes—is also an essential component in high-priority medical gear like masks, gowns, and medical-grade disinfecting wipes."
"Perfect safety stock in a crisis. Upward or little to no price movement, good well supported dividend, demand for their products is inelastic. I've already made 14% with this company in just over a day. Plan to hold it throughout the duration of the crisis, which is far from over."
"Here in Berkeley CA no wipes at any supermarket, CLX still selling their products like hot cakes!"
My WMT was sold out yesterday of Clorox. Other brands also. So it's gonna be a good quarter.
"Assuming they make $5.50 next year with PE of 20, I guess SP should be about $110."
it will be 250 dollar in next 2 months with this quarter result. additional use of cleaning product is not going down for a while as market open more will be used. we saw the sales spike 17% from a year earlier in march quarter when the covid number were beginning. this quarter we will see the real impact. this stock may double in a year as well. lets wait and watch
yikessss $20 down
"Come on Kramer, be nice to the lady CEO, i think your reading to much into the numbers, apologize to her"
why would clorox spike on delta variant if there is a vaccine? what is wrong with you people?
Back to $170+
Expect a big raise before April 21. That's the ex dividend date. Shorts dont wanna pay it.This will gain 35 dollars a share in the next 30 days
When NYSE OPENS......REAL SELLING STARTS !Can You Say ?
All four seasons company .
An early dividend boost to 96 cents (14% increase) love CLX.
Indices down half percent or more. Clorox up .68%.I fear those waiting to buy @ $140 are doomed to a long wait.
"All three Covid-19 tracking apps I use show a ""second wave"" of Covid-19 in the making over the past ten days or so. (The first wave never really went away, but rather just receded by about 1/3 and stayed there during the riots.) But now daily case counts are accelerating again. I expect the media to pivot from the riots as they die down to hyping the second wave of Covid-19. More emphasis on masks, disinfectant, etc. (I have owned CLX for the past several months.)"
This was trading in the 157s pre pandemic so time to initiate position if you have not already. Delta variant cases going up you think people would stop buying cleaning products?
nobody going pay a premium for this
i thought Clorox was the new post-pandemic boom stock? without Clorox products people will die of disease.
"Bought at $160.66 to add to my long term hold. This price is about the same it was in August 2019, so we get to go back 2 years and buy CLX stock at a discount minus the dividends of course."
Delta variant will pop bubble
A steady climb is what I like. We could see a merger soon!
195c for 7/23 will fly tomorrow
Some may think CLX is over bought due to 25+ p/e. This will change once massive earnings beat happens next quarter. Not to mention massive guidance increase.
New all time high today! Will it hold until the end of the day? I don't care! Happy happy!
"Who in there right mind would've sold this over the past few weeks? Took a loss today all around, but CLX and GLD kept my losses to a minimum. Not saying this will continue at this pace, still a great hold until the current situation comes to an end."
"Remember that CLX is a ""dividend aristocracy"" stock. As the Dow goes up, it's average dividend yield goes down, and as CLX goes down, it's dividend yield goes up. CLX has almost always gone down on positive news days since the pandemic started, but when this happens it's dividend yield goes up relative to the other ""dividend aristocracy"" stocks wh'os prices tend to go up."
Expect about 20% downside from the close over the next few months. So figure down to about $125. The dividend will continue to pay so long term holders should be fine.
CLX is a solid company. It has been hurt like all CPG companies due to margin contraction. Higher input costs and rising logistics costs. CLX should rebound over the next few quarters.
Waaaaaaay overrated for a bleach stock. $75/share is appropriate.
"Don't ever act on recommendations from Goldman Sachs. They downgraded CLX to ""Sell"" on 7-18-18. It's up $10 since the downgrade."
"Pre market very lack luster, could open red"
"The best time to buy a stock is when you most won't want to. That is the time ""right now"" for CLX. All of the Covid has been washed clean from this stock now. It can now go back to steady business with a steady dividend. I hope all of you ""living in your parents basement"" Robinhooders have learned a valuable lesson on buying momentum. DON'T!!!!!!!"
It's a beat:22% sales increase$2.41 diluted EPS (28% increase versus year-ago quarter)
"I did not sell @ 240 I am not going to sell now, but it is about time management give investors a brake. Alliance with airlines, schools, something..."
Cramer is saying clx is skyrocketing while it only gain 2% this guy is so funny
"Weird - I can see a small correction in CLX but why the selloff? Holding existing position and today I bought June $160 calls at $6.90. The only way to play this market is with ""in the money"" or close to ""in the money"" calls. CLX should be a defensive position but I guess if you have to sell, you sell what you can, not what you want to. I have been in the market for half a century and except for 2008-9 crash this is the craziest I can recall."
"I am very surprised that CLX has not received a large spike in stock price because of the new Delta virus....maybe we are going to see a delayed spike, but as states, counties, schools, etc. start mandating wearing masks again and people realize this second ""wave"" is serious, then people will start getting serious again about wipes, handwash, etc....then CLX will soon get the attention, but we may be looking at a few more weeks for the public and media to bring out the consumer return to these methods..."
"A little healthy pullback after a week of heavy buying. Gotta love how its a bit down while the almost the entire market is inflated by pretty much two non news. Trump saying we will open soon, something he has been saying since March and Gildead announcing a drug has good results even though the test subjects were cherry picked and still some people died. Market reacted like if we had found a cure and starting today no more covid19 lol.Meanwhile Fauci and the entire scientific community not guaranteeing safety by the November election.Facebook cancelling all events until 2021, FIFA already admitting soccer is done for the yr.The demand for clorox wont cease for 18 months."
Dead cat bounce right now.
close the week @235. The sky is the limit for CLX. Great company with great products and the right situation for the launch. I see 300 not that far away.
Why anyone would prefer CLX over PG? PG has a better div yield with better value gain.
"What a great addition to a Clorox holding: PURE. Now the key ingredient in the new USDA approved SmartWash Boost product to disinfect produce. It's not a replacement for chlorine but an important addition. Taylor Farms / SmartWash already own the global produce wash industry, and now with the new patent-pending product can expand on years of expertise."
Look at SAM to reflect what will happen to this stock after earnings.
Go to your Walmart store and check if Clorox wipes are in stock! They were sold out at the Costco by me and I used Walmart as a confirmation.
"Very happy with CLX 10 point move 24-Jun through today morning (3 trading days).Congrats to those who bought the dip last week. Safe, Stable company. Pays 2.6% steady Dividend. Recession Proof."
In few month many will regret why they miss this great opportunity of earning
What a wreck. Even with a 6% dividend I wouldnt want this. 140s by the end of the year. It will keep getting bleaker and weaker.
"Desinfection is not over: aeroplanes, amusement parks, schools, they will all consume CLX products as the economy reopens. I am holding, and adding up under 200 if possible."
waited...today is the day i am buying in... wanted a position since June of last year here if my entry. Way oversold now
200$ soon
"So presumed president elect Biden promises a ""Dark Winter"" and the news sources say the best case for this Pfizer vaccine is wide distribution this Spring. Will most people be vaccinated by the end of Summer? Will all the new cleaning rules requiring the use of bleach just go away? When do bureaucrats end safety rules once they are in place? Who thinks pre Covid-19 ""normal"" will return tomorrow, or next year? I think the selling today was a bit overdone, probably due to abrupt, and likely wise, reallocation to ""recovery"" stocks by hedge funds and others. My greater fear for CLX, being a dependable dividend stock, is that interest rates might abruptly rise in an unforeseen way making dividend stocks less attractive as the ""risk free"" rate of return goes back up."
I just bought tons of clx . I am losing lots of money ..can it recover to 200?
Nice dividend-paying household name. I've been waiting for an entry point for a long time. Could this be it?!
stocks go up.stocks go down.has been true since the dawn of time.
"Time to buy this stock again.Hilarious that clorox is over 20% below it's all time high while a company like Jet Blue airlines is less than 20% from it's all time high while, just like all the airlines, they have +120% the debt they had 10 months ago and their revenue is less than 35% what it used to be and they lose millions of dollars every day and have to take new debt constantly to cover those losses lol.Meanwhile clorox have their debt totally under control due to 10 months of huge sales, their profit margin has increased due to the demand (in production and supply chain, more demand means more profit margin since you never stop working).Clorox profit margin has passed 20%, which is unreal for a company that bleach products and the like.And the company is at its healthiest state in its history.I sold this when it passed 230. I just bought again when it went below 200."
"Clorox failed us. When we needed their wipes, they were out of stock everywhere. Why was it so difficult to increase production on a simple product like a wipe? The company obviously went ""lean"" and failed their customers. I will never buy Clorox wipes or their overpriced bleach again."
Holding 50k in Clorox until the next earnings!! Wish me luck
"20 yrs, biggest drop ever, there will be a big chance here"
Is it too late to buy to get the dividend on april 21?
We need another pandemic to shoot up the stock price. When will China release the next virus on the world?
Let?s compare CLX vs Facebook Yes FB a growing company and CLX an established dividend paying company FB #$%$ off the world and the stock was $195 at its high and now $168 or a 23% declineCLX 52 week high 152 and now $116 that?s 35% on a company that does nothing but perform a company around since early 1900s a company with 6 billion in revenue and it?s 35% down for no reason?Consumers shifting away from established brands? Really ? Was in Target yesterday and Clorox products needed to be restocked
"As more and more business, sporting events, open, and travel increases, the use of CLX products will be in much greater demand .... might even double the demand. The use, and demand, is only going to increase."
To the moon Alice 
"It will recover. Patience. Let time do its thing. if you're worried about this stock's movement and selling for losses you need to find a new hobby. Sincerely, $111 per share owner and recently bought big again at $193."
"Wow, who would have thought that the greatest pandemic of all time would be a net negative for the best disinfectant company! Price lower than before covid."
Is the party over?
CLX - i have core position and also trade. Buy in $180s and sell in $190s.Lighten core position at $210+Add to Core position in $170s or $160s if it gets there.Enjoy dividends on core position.Make extra income through weekly options. Sell covered calls. Sell cash covered puts.With CLX one can rinse and repeat. Year after year. There's no euphoria. No recession. No shocks. No surprises. This is a tension free money maker: 15-20% return every year!
Fair price is 270-300In 3-6 months.Gl
"This thing is gonna fly through earnings, no way it doesnt.Its true that Clorox doesnt only sell bleach but lets get real here. Their factories are working 24/7 instead of 12/6. You simply cant find their stuff. Its probably going mostly to hospitals that are using it by the gallon in every room. You cant even find baby wipes because people are buying it to clean, so what do you think is left for clorox wipes.Clorox had just expanded their production capacity, check their latest report. They basically got new production plants and machinery, so this crisis hit when they were ready to go.In supply chain, when demand increases and factories work 24/7, the profit margin increases too. They probably are paying people overtime and its not making a dent.Revenue up, profits up, cash on hand up, less debt. People that are saying this should be sold because its expensive are insane. Its expensive when you consider last quarter's earnings per share, not this. They outperformed the market last recession due to SARS fears. Imagine now that you cannot buy their stuff unless you make a line at Costco at 8AM the day of the week their stuff arrives."
"With covid winding down, how could CLX have a good qtr?"
"EPS guidance for 2022 for $5.05 to $5.35. Using high end, CLX is trading at 30.6x forward earnings. Crazy, for a company with declining revenues and earnings."
"here we go again, little jump to the green in first hour and downhill the rest of the day---Isnt his supposed to be dividend stock where investors go to safety....Good news is it must reverse itself one day soon----"
Free money here..capital and dividend gains..? Thanks for the gift. I promise you selling will dearly pay. I PROMISE.
Kitchen sink QTR is usually a set up down the road. Two overriding concerns (inflation/Covid) both moving in opposite directions from where they were going the past 3 months- near future may not be as easy to predict as one would think reading the Q report and listening to the webcast. Think I'll just stay put for now.
"just look at chart. when you get a good deal of sell volume like yesterday, stock crashes. but when you get the same kind of volume, but BUY volume, this stock can surge, like it did in late January with Kimberly Clark earnings. Just needs volume and up we go."
I love how everyone is assuming the virus transmits through surfaces when it hardly does.
I bought 100 shares yesterday about 196. I feel this will have a good run and the product line fits the conditions.Looking at peers in this sector CLX is one of the top performers.
I LOVE THIS STOCK
Back to 140 team trade accordingly
remember the $160 dip and those saying it would keep falling?... Anyone see it falling again?
Got wiped pretty good by this one.
"Delta will cause a second spike in demand for CLX products; mark my words. Stock could hit 200 again in near future; maybe before December. Buy at these prices; average down if it drops a bit more, and hold IMHO."
I'm sorry to say outbreaks of disease are occurring once more. I hope they're limited and contained. - Pete
"I have to think that this sell off is a gift. I've been looking into jumping in on this stock for some time and now (yeah I know I'm late as hell) it has to be de risked. Here's my thinking on how Clorox is in a win-win: If the shutdown is extended then the demand is there for people to buy the disinfectants, which you can't find on the shelves, so that's is the win that everyone is focused on. But, what I feel that everyone else is overlooking is that as the re-opening starts, there will be more demand for their products. An example of this was that I recently went to a clothing store to finally buy some needed shirts. At the counter, the cashier would spray disinfectant spray after each sale on the counter. Whether you think that is overkill or not (I think it was because she was wiping down an area that was not touched by the customer nor was it breathed on because of the plastic shield on the counter and the mask worn by the customer) it shows that this is what companies will have to do in order to keep customers coming in and not be afraid of catching the virus. Now imagine a fully opened economy and the lingering fear of getting sick and every cashier wiping down every counter after every sale. And this extends past the department store and into all other businesses (think restaurants, bars, anything for that matter). That has to be an even better situation for Clorox than what we have now. I guess the only down side to this would be if they could keep up with the extra demand."
"Adding more, definitely way oversold now. Easy trade into the weekend"
$200 this coming week my friends. it'll start climbing to $215 right before earnings!!! You decide if you're keeping or selling before earnings! You've been told!
Computer buying is ignoring bad earnings and outlook right now for some reason. Maybe want to dump shares on retail for a higher price.
I have owned CLX for 13 years and my yield to cost is over 9%. Stay long my friend...stay long.
This stock is a buy as long as they’re out of stock on the shelves of Walmart.
"Tom - go to Redditt and let the army know about CLX and that some good buy volume can send this surging. I've been posting but can;t yet on Reddix or Robinhood. If you want this to go up people, than do your part"
"for once, can this stock have a positive last hour of trading?Is that asking too much for this to occur once or 2x a month? lol..."
"we're in trouble folks. people think COVAD is over. States are relaxing restrictions, people are acting like COVAD is over because cases are dropping and because of all this , people don't believe they need to sanitize or clean or do the things they were doing when COVAD was at its peak"
I wonder how the supply chain being disrupted affect us shareholders? Clorox wipes are a big seller and there will be a lot less to sell.
"Oh man bad day today, any thoughts?"
I just got in with Clorox!! I just bought on the dip at 191.05 cost basis buying 8 shares.
"this company is actually really diversified, with a lot of products besides bleach and cleaning."
CLX...the ultimate Planet Janitor. Even if a virus vaccine presents decent efficacy it will literally take years to eradicate the *current* strain of Covid-19. And the second most valuable products are PPE and disinfectants (and the behavior to use them). But what virus could come next after this one?...Hopefully people will learn from this and use better hygiene. Good luck to all with CLX!
take it when they give it

As I wrote 3 weeks ago this plague will linger. Clorox products will be necessary and relevant for a prolonged period into the future. I still wish otherwise and I want to be wrong. Millions refuse to be vaccinated also btw. Best wishes. - Pete
"Finally. It’s actually 4.50%. From the press release:The Clorox Company (NYSE: CLX) announced today that its board of directors has declared a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend, from $1.11 to $1.16 per share on the company's common stock. The dividend is payable Aug. 13, 2021, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 28, 2021."
This thing couldn't pay a high enough dividend for me to buy it.....
"In today at 206, after taking a nice profit last week. Don't know why it's down today; however, definitely is one to keep. They can't even keep it on the shelves!! Earnings probably will be great."
Big earnings beat with only one month of coronavirus panic. Next quarter the revenue will be even higher.Most impressive part was the big increases in profit margins. Horrible day for the market. Money will come to clorox by the end of the day.220 by the end of May.
"It's a no brainer, it's already a multi-billion dollar company, which thrives in a normal market, so why would anyone sell it now when its products are needed most."
"Can't really share MY reaction effectively in this medium, but as a CLX holder since March, I'll be glowing all day."
"This is called a bad management！Management team: please wake up and cut your loss by reducing your management cost! Pandemic is the best of luck fall from the sky to your business, your company should make 100times profit instead of negative earnings report! What a miss!"
"Long term this should be 155 to 165. It was in the low 150's before Covid was known to exist, the company really hasn't created any new products, all the gain is due to Covid which now we hear may disappear by late April or at worse by mid summer. Though it should see higher sales as I think the use of anti-bacterial cleaning products is probably here to stay, just in more reasonable amounts."
Clorox 2 gets the disco kid. Right again. Ah ha.
Cuomo will be re-elected
"With only 125M shares for the float and shorting running about 10%, seems the stock is a candidate for manipulation. Is anyone else surprised by the amount of shorting done on CLX? I suppose part of it is related to the ""buy the rumor"", ""sell the news""."
There's going to be a prolonged demand for Clorox products surely and bigly. $220 to $240 over time ? - Pete
"Why is everyone so negative about this stock? It's been going down since I bought it and I'm losing about 2K., and I buy a little when it goes down. With the pandemic, everyone is still buying their products big time, but I don't understand why people are saying it is going to take."
171 is its resistance point.
"It's preposterous that people on this board are treating this stock like a Tesla or Snowflake or another hype stock. If you are in Clorox, why would you sell? The P/FCF is ~16. Even assuming it declines to ~20-24 due to the reopening, it is still on the cheaper side of stocks in this industry. By the way, inflation will benefit this stock because it will be able to push inflation consistent prices on the consumer, protecting against virtually all downside. Think again before you see the 6-month stock chart direction and sell."
"Clorox may be an absolute sleeper. Once more I looked over its profile and myriad product lines. Glad bags, kitty litter, bleach, salad dressing, disinfectant items, charcoal, etc, etc..I only own a few shares but I didn't know the company's diverse areas. It could be the McDonald's of household products. - Pete"
"Covid19 spike and market index green, I'm surprised CLX is in the red."
"The problem is the mentality of Clorox management, they did not ramp up production drastically when it was required. they have not added any new manufacturing lines. they themselves are of the view that this increase in requirement is temporary. meanwhile, all other retail chains have come up with their own brands to fill the gap. this opportunity which could have been a gold mine for Clorox could turn into a disaster of their own making."
"Missing the bigger picture here, this pandemic is just the beginning..."
Buy the dip
buyers are coming in
I feel safe every time I see my clorox shares.
Should do a stock split. Too expensive looking for a company that makes bleach. I think it would do well to cross that psychological barrier for investors.
bought at $172 (just a few shares) - will target more...
CLX is a great defensive stock in this type of market. The demand for their products will only continue to increase over time and it has great fundamentals as well. Today's slight dip was a great time to get in.
"I purchased this stock when the pandemic started, and I've been watching it every day since, and I don't recall ever seeing a two point jump after hours. Tomorrow may be interesting."
Earnings Tue 3 Aug pre market. I'll be adding if reaction pushes stock down to $170s. $160s will be gift.
Bought at the lows can't beat this solid dividend grower.....
based on forward guidance seems to expensive
For me is time to buy.
Cleaning and disinfecting is not going no where! Don’t give your shares to people who will love their juice dividend you still can’t find Clorox wipes at the stores even with vaccine out !
Its moving now. Back to $200 soon. Still not too late to get in.
Injecting bleach can save America and this company. Put this on drip
almost every company make their own wipes..
CLX raised the dividend 19% this year my yield to cost is looking pretty healthy...this is not a trading stock have owned it for years.
Someone or something snuck in and bid CLX way up in the last few minutes of trading. Am I the only one who's wondering what's going on?
I was in Costco the other day and they were selling CLX bleach by the case. The cases were moving off the shelves as quickly as they could fill them up again. Earnings on %/1 ... I would not be short. This will start moving higher now till earnings.
The relentless delta peak will push this above pre covid levels. I am baffled by how analysts think.
"Heads up: The dollar index DX-Y.NYB has been going down since April and is getting to the lowest point since it bottomed out and headed up in early 2018. Right about this time, there was a significant sell off of the Dow. The reason this is important to we CLX holders is that CLX is such a great dividend stock that it can be thought of as a bond substitute when interest rates are very low, like they've been since the Covid-19 pandemic started. But when the dollar went way down in early 2018, Treasury bond yields took off because, I assume, Treasuries sold off in response to the declining dollar. If that happens again, the gap between the risk free rate of return (Treasuries) and the return on dividend paying stocks gets narrower, potentially making dividend stocks less attractive for those seeking mainly income. In other words, there's a chance that CLX might have some turbulence ahead which has nothing directly to do with CLX. I will be watching the dollar, Treasuries, and what our Fed and government may try to do, if anything to halt the slide of the dollar. Merry Christmas, and I'm glad I wrote that if only for myself to look back in a while. This is not financial advice."
Taking a huge hair cut today....
"In the short term, this is oversold. I bought today near bottom. Should be a bounce tomorrow ahead of holiday."
This is going up Monday morning don’t worry. Only down cause market worries.. COVID is here to stay. They ramping up production big time
Pre-market on Nasdaq at $244-$245
210 ? 220 ? - Pete
"I just signed up for Reddit and Robinhood, so I cant post there yet. If someone can put a post out to Reddit and Robinhood army about buying CLX on this recent dip, the stock can soar. Look at chart. Some strong buy volume and this can easily go up 30 or more."
Do ya'all know that Clorox makes Pine Sol and Kingsford Briquettes?
"This is a wide moat stock, don't miss this great opportunity..."
"In the same vain that this went down yesterday, it can surge with a short squeeze. Spread word to BUY CLX. Let's get this moving back up."
How is everyone feeling before ER tomorrow?I have been waiting with excitement the whole weekend after a nice close on friday.Really think this is going to be good!!
"Well I had to say one more thing because the reaction count was 666 and I own the stock. Everyone knows that this next earnings report should reflect the full 500% increase in demand for Clorox Inc.'s core products, right?"
"Great blue chip on its own, now with surging demand for its products. 52 week high coming but slow steady pace."
Also they said they were having problems producing the Clorox wipes I was at a Walmart today in the middle of nowhere Shenandoah Iowa and they were very well stocked .
Jimmy Chill just said buy CLX after last week saying to wait until the yield reaches 3%
can we expect clorox at 215 by this earning?
"This will be red by end of day, big money pushing defensive stocks based on a trial pause of one of twelve leading companies for a vaccine, tends to make me believe they are selling to build up funds to dump into the consumer discretionaries which they are tanking today even though very good reports from banks and even Ethan Allan which was having issues well before Covid yet are coming out of Covid in much better condition."
"Well, now all we need are a 100,000 RobinHood traders to go into FOMO mode and bid this stock up to 1000 whether it should be there or not. Gotta dream."
I wonder why its going down also. One thing i have noticed about some stocks. When its about 30 to 40 days prior to Earnings reports they tend to go down. I am thinking the institutions that own them are shorting them and will buy back as it get's closer to earnings. That way they make a profit on the short and a profit on the long. I may buy some November Call options
close to 3% starting dividend yield
People bought short positions and they are stoking fear!
We're not out of the woods yet with Covid I'm sorry to say. Certain states/areas opened too soon.- Pete
COVID hospitalization due to variant is down compared to initial outbreak
The CEO have no clue on how to achieve manufacturing excellence. Squandered an once in a life time pandemic created opportunity. Gave market to competitors with both hands. Time for a much needed change
Toilet cleaning company?
At our local Walmart yesterday Clorax was completely sold out. Today the wife went to ourlocal Kroger store and again -- no bleach products of any sort were available.
Last Year People Were BEGGING For Product... Couldn't Find It ANYWHERE !NOW......Product Is EVERYWHERE ....NOBODY WANT'S IT !SELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL !
"Is it a good time to add this stock to my portfolio?It has low beta but high P/E ratio and was up a lot since February, but I expect it to grow like that in the next 2 years because of the corona consequences (more hygiene everywhere) so higher demand for their products.what are your thoughts?"
Great brand but pretty bad guidance. Going lower. But will be more profitable in 10-20 years probably
"Buy, buy, buy!"
"Make sure you buy before earnings, according to what I read and see now at the supermarkets CLX has ramped up production to meet their huge demands. 250 in november!"
"i wouldn't hold on to this iF you're just trading it. short term its going to pullback to 125-126. long term its deF a buy/hold. within a year it'll be trading above 180 IMO. just my 2 cents, what do you think? I think next 2 weeks will continue to be volatile and well see more down days than up. I really see CLX back to 125"
Wake me up when it’s 140$ Already added at 165$ to portfolio looks like market is beating this one back to a reasonable Pe which 30 isn’t . At 140$ we might see bottom if not then next stop would be 120 which should definitely be the bottom and super fair PE
Wait for $123
"their products sell worldwide like the virus, and their proven to work. Even if a vaccine existed, need for deep cleaning is not going away."
The Machine is the most intelligent life on the planet. Look at the 5 year chart. Bottoms on 11/1. COVID is just starting in China. Huge spike 3/1/20 as lockdown rumors catch on. 3/13/20 US lockdown. Tops out July 20 as world reopens albeit very choppy. Also a nice lesson on why it’s so hard to beat the market indices. Down 30% from peak in a raging bull market. The Machine knows everything
"For those of you pumping the stock, perhaps you can't read. They just missed huge AND they lowered guidance big-time. This isn't a tough one to read. CLX is a good company. The stock is dead money. FFS they even admitted this isn't a one-off. Nothing to read in to. It's over johnny. ITS OVER!"
CLX will be a BUY as long as COVID is around. Probably several years at least.
Still overvalued IMO. I'd have t see it drop down to or below pre-Covid price to take a look. EOFY22 @~$140 would still be >25P/E with current E est.
$160 yesterday was a gift. Short and long term. Not to mention the media is scaring the hel out of everyone about Covid. Q3 results will jump back up.
"As stated yesterday when stock was getting hammered and went down below 230......stock will bounce back, And it has very nicely. Have faith CLX holders."
Easy 5% in the next couple months. Big demand for workplaces/hotels/casinos ect during the reopening. Don't see it going away any time soon.
CLX gave incredibly nice report. It is a super solid company. Why drops?
"Welcome to oversold clorox. Now that others left, this is when I come in. Expected eps of 1.74 lol yeah right, watch it reach +3.0. Covid will be with us for years. Just the airlines will use clorox massively forever. Anything public, throw the clorox. Caterpillar has decreasing revenue, decreasing earnings, decreasing profit margin and increasing debt and their pe ratio shoots up to +33 but clorox is at 20? Lol easy buy."
Own some hope we see 220$ but looks like if market corrects this goes to 140$ which would be a steal
Now that we know the covid vaccine is easy: just inject Clorox into ur lungs...and all good to go! I just bought 1000 shares due to trump's genius. He really is amazing....I'm hearing incredible things about him.
"I am shorting this stock. At the beginning of this year the company was trading around $150. It spiked due to the virus panic, but now that things are getting back to normal it will likely return to it former value."
"mark this post, see you all at 220. there will be a rotation from high flying risky stocks back into safe low risk stocks like CLX. 220 by end of Feb"
praying for a new virus so the stock go up
People will continue to use more Clorox products after the coronavirus is over just too be safe. I know we will. IMO
"In March I swapped Clorox for CrowdStrike - both were $183. I grew tired of CLX only going down from where I bought @ $202 for what I thought was a losing battle now that the pandemic had let up. Now down 20 more points, I've made all my money back and then some. This beloved company was caught with their pants down. Tried as they might - they missed the boat in supplying what everyone wanted in the biggest opportunity of their corporate lifetime. Even now with the Delta variant - it seems like a long road back."
"Let’s pretend that a vaccine is discovered in December (very hopeful situation). They will still need to test it on average women, then women who got pregnant before and also after they got the vaccine, then they have to run studies on the newborn baby and then again at the babies 1 year birthday to see if there was any negative reactions. Then after that, it is necessary to vaccine the baby itself and then require another report after 1 year.... all the meanwhile a good portion of the population will refuse to trust a vaccine until all those tests are complete. The point here is that society awaits those results, regardless of success or not, everyone will be using #Clorox products."
"Coca Cola, Clorox, McDonald's, Walmart, pharmaceuticals and oil stocks, etc., are usually pretty solid and consistent performers. They're not like Tesla or Amazon but they're near indispensable and habit forming. - Pete"
THIS WAS SO OBVIOUS ITS NOT EVEN FUNNY 
If CLX can’t succeed during a pandemic then this is not a good sign
"Any ideas who had to sell today? Extremely odd action for such a well positioned company, especially in this environment."
"Well I'm not going to mourn a potential vaccine that could eventually save millions from a horrible death, but to anyone feeling bad this morning, remember to look at a long term graph, and see that CLX approximately doubled from 2014 to 2018 before COVID-19 happened, and in ""normal world"" that's a great investment."
Love day trading this name made 20% already
this might be a time to open up a position. it was insane before the drop.
Oversold. There’s room here for a quick trade to make 2%
"Uber (NYSE:UBER) is partnering with Clorox (NYSE:CLX) to provide about 600,000 containers of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes to drivers in the pilot cities of Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.Riders will receive an in-app notification that the arriving driver has wipes prior to being picked up.The pilot program launches in July and could roll out to additional cities soon."
"I looks like CLX -- like other safe haven types of stocks -- is being sold to meet margin calls caused by loses in other investments. I own CLX and I'm not worried one bit. Remember CLX pays a huge dividend, and in a world of interest rates approaching zero, that alone will be attractive, it addition to the obvious reasons Clorox should be in even greater demand going forward."
same price as almost 1 year ago... way oversold if valuations dont matter in the market
"Interesting that ""stay at home"" stocks are still selling off while ""germs still out there"" stocks are clawing their way back."
Thank you CLX for the 10% dividend increase!
"Most shareholders have probably been holding since Paleozoic era. Why is this down, you ask?"
I am confused with the price action this morning.
This stock is PRECISELY where I thought it would be right now when I bought it back in March. Ka-Ching! I also predict that by mid August after earnings it will be north of 240. I'm feelin' like the Wolf of Wall Street here. Money is made by waiting.
Cramer really tough on Clorox CEO…I’m still buyin !!!
"So, I've set an entry buy with a limit order at $172. Might not happen. May buy some at this ($173) and just set more buy orders below that. I see this as a 5+ year hold - just watch for dividends..."
this ceo is goner
Thumbs up if you are a long term holder! I am 37 and I will be holding for 20 years. A great American company!
Should I sell or should I hold?
unreal A 100 year pandemic and a company thats specializes in disinfecting tanks to pre-pandemic level. Whats going on here ?
"I’m very new to options, but does a call at 240 sound good?"
"I don't get this. If there's one company you would think would benefit from the pandemic, the first one you'd think of may well be Clorox. Yet it has underperformed the market in the last year from what I can see, or at best performed in line. It posted what seemed to be great earnings. What's going on? (Disclaimer: I am long Clorox and this is obviously not financial advice and investing comes with risk)"
"OAKLAND, Calif., August 20, 2020 – The Clorox Company announced today all Clorox and Clorox Scentiva branded Disinfecting Wipes and Disinfecting Wet Mopping Cloths received approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for kill claims against SARS-Cov-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, on hard non-porous surfaces. Clorox Scentiva branded Disinfecting Wet Mopping Cloths are the first floor mopping clothes in the category to kill SARS-Cov-2. The new claims come after third-party laboratory testing proved the disinfectants’ efficacy against the virus with a 30 second contact time on hard non-porous surfaces.“Clorox is a health and wellness company and we know how important it is for people to have the peace of mind the disinfectants they are using are effective against the virus that causes COVID-19,” said Chris Hyder, Vice President and General Manager, The Clorox Company. “We began testing our most popular and widely distributed products on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and we will continue testing other products on the virus, so we can offer consumers a wide range of products that are proven effective in fighting the spread of COVID-19. In the meantime, it’s important people know they can continue to confidently use any disinfectants that meet the criteria for use in fighting the spread of COVID-19 under the EPA Emerging Viral Pathogen Policy.”The following Clorox disinfectants have been approved by EPA for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 with a 30-second contact time: • Clorox Disinfecting Wipes (all scents) • Clorox Disinfecting Wet Mopping Cloths (all scents) • Clorox Scentiva Disinfecting Wipes (all scents) • Clorox Scentiva Disinfecting Wet Mopping Cloths (all scents) • Clorox Commercial Solutions Clorox Disinfecting Wipes (all scents)"
Aww I didn’t know earnings were Monday before open looks like I missed this one
"if you want this to go up, you need to find some buyers. I contacted Investment Relations and let them know how unhappy we shareholders are in this fiasco. These kind of stocks shouldn't crash like this has. We need REDDIT army. Someone tell them that with alot of buy volume this can surge."
"D.A. Davidson starts off coverage on Clorox (CLX -0.1%) with a Buy rating on its expectation for a long-lasting heightened awareness of the role of disinfecting in public healthAnalyst Linda Bolton Weiser: ""The majority of the higher demand for disinfecting products is coming from incremental household penetration, not just stockpiling or higher use by existing households... We believe habits around disinfecting are changing for the long term, and that Clorox's sales may NOT decline in the high-single digits in the second half of fiscal 2021 (when prior-year comps get hard) as the consensus is projecting.""The firm assigns a price target of $256 on Clorox vs. the average sell-side PT of $194.19."
Cleaning habits and desinfection are here to stay. With or without vaccine CLX is standing on the right side of this new normal world. BUY!
"JPMorgan analyst Andrea Teixeira downgraded Clorox to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $235, down from $255. $235 is the new TARGET and sales and revenues will continue to exceed expectations."
bought on Friday dip... not worried about smaller competition cuz they can’t compete with manufacturing their products leaving them ultimately to sell to companies like CLX while doing the grunt work of R&D and marketing
"Many people who have not used the disinfecting are using them now, this could help the long term sales of the Clorox disinfecting wipes. All stores in Las Vegas area are sold out of wipes."
"That earnings so so bad, and the outlook is appaling almost putting the dividend at risk. I am not a buyer even at 160 :("
The big rebound since 11:30 makes no sense. Why is this being manipulated up. Since when is bad earnings and bad outlook mean big buying opportunity. Weird manipulation.
