"when the market is up, this is always down. when the market is down, this so called defensive stock is down too thanks to current ceo"
$ATVI $CLX $FDX im glad i dodged these when i sold it last year..
What a beautiful stock for dividend growth
"CLX looks great as a Pure Earnings Short Sell for Monday, planning to Short a lot of shares to hold until later on Tuesday. Expecting weak earnings, and with company still way over-valued, a drop to under $150 in direct response to Monday's AH earnings release is perfectly reasonable. Best of all, I see very low risk of any upside price move, even if they beat consensus estimates on EPS and Revenue."
Why doesn’t the Kimberly-Clark Corporation merge with the Clorox Company? There appear to be many synergies between the two.
I’ll start buying at 130s
"You have to think of some serious mismanagement here. Had a product everyone wanted last year, yet stock is lower than before the media pandemic."
I’m gonna set me a limit order if $154 when CLX reports earnings
Honestly still overpriced
Buyer at $158
Indices down half percent or more. Clorox up .68%.I fear those waiting to buy @ $140 are doomed to a long wait.
The forward PE is still way too high unless they do a good acquisition
Projected to go up 55% over the next five years. Thats 11% per year. Great dividend. This is a strong buy at the current price.
I see a buy around 120.
I will start buying under 
$FDX $CLX out of all the big stock i bought in the past these was the worst one. Im glad i sold FDX at $290 in dec 2020 and CLX 220 in AUgust 2020..
Wake me up when it’s 140$ Already added at 165$ to portfolio looks like market is beating this one back to a reasonable Pe which 30 isn’t . At 140$ we might see bottom if not then next stop would be 120 which should definitely be the bottom and super fair PE

back to pre-pandemic levels. this was to be expected.
