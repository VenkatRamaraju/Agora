"CLX looks great as a Pure Earnings Short Sell for Monday, planning to Short a lot of shares to hold until later on Tuesday. Expecting weak earnings, and with company still way over-valued, a drop to under $150 in direct response to Monday's AH earnings release is perfectly reasonable. Best of all, I see very low risk of any upside price move, even if they beat consensus estimates on EPS and Revenue."
Buyer at $158
The forward PE is still way too high unless they do a good acquisition
What a beautiful stock for dividend growth
"You have to think of some serious mismanagement here. Had a product everyone wanted last year, yet stock is lower than before the media pandemic."
I see a buy around 120.
I’m gonna set me a limit order if $154 when CLX reports earnings
$ATVI $CLX $FDX im glad i dodged these when i sold it last year..
Projected to go up 55% over the next five years. Thats 11% per year. Great dividend. This is a strong buy at the current price.
"Straight down since July 1, 2021. Your once in a century demand surge is waning. Bleach last a long time, in the basement tox box."
Indices down half percent or more. Clorox up .68%.I fear those waiting to buy @ $140 are doomed to a long wait.
Added more today!
I’ll start buying at 130s
Honestly still overpriced
Why doesn’t the Kimberly-Clark Corporation merge with the Clorox Company? There appear to be many synergies between the two.
$FDX $CLX out of all the big stock i bought in the past these was the worst one. Im glad i sold FDX at $290 in dec 2020 and CLX 220 in AUgust 2020..
Wake me up when it’s 140$ Already added at 165$ to portfolio looks like market is beating this one back to a reasonable Pe which 30 isn’t . At 140$ we might see bottom if not then next stop would be 120 which should definitely be the bottom and super fair PE
back to pre-pandemic levels. this was to be expected.
I will start buying under 
"when the market is up, this is always down. when the market is down, this so called defensive stock is down too thanks to current ceo"
