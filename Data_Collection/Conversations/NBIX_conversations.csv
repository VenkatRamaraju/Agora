The stock would be well over $90 by now; without this overall market correction.
"revenue, earnings growth on track...140 by end of year....then much higher. Adding shares this week if its flat."
"Thank you master, may I have another? 95 b4 COB?"
Nice run after-hours; let’s hope it holds during the trading day tomorrow.
Looks like we have another huge qtr of Ingrezza revenues. Anyone want to guess ehat it will be? I'm going with $75 million.
Sounds like this has more to do with Allergan’s rival drug Esmya which has been associated with liver injuries in Europe. Request for liver function tests for Elagolix patient series just FDA being “consistent” ( careful?). Not certain if drug mechanism is the same. Little additional information. No reports of liver issues with Elagolix. Stay long.
Q2 earnings to be released tomorrow. During the Q1 call the CEO said that they entered Q2 in a strong position so I'm excited to see what they report. I'm think of adding to my position with this latest dip in share price.
"I am""Evaluating Investigational Elagolix in Women with Uterine Fibroids"" so wish me well. I bought a huge position at 78.87 and have struck gold."
strong upward move today with good volume. Any one know something related to the share price upward move?
"neurocrine's future is extremely bright. they will report a profitable quarter in the next ER which will add to its growing 840M+ cash position. KG in the CC, has said they're actively searching for new clinical compounds for BD. i am excited to see their creativity in M&A. also, they mentioned that they will have at LEAST 1 IND for 2018. this is hinting to possibly more than 2 IND's for 2018-19. also KG's closing remarks hinted that ingrezza& elagolix may see ADDITIONAL indications beyond TS &UF..the color is starting to show for two 5b+ PS products. i'm also excited for CAH results, which will readout in the 3rd qt. NBI-74788 is a wonderful compound, and has a beautiful MOA(CRF antagonist) that could treat a wide range of disorders/diseases: MDD, anxiety, inflammation, psoriasis, IBD, dermatitis, combo therapy for tumors, etc. NBI-74788 will have CAH as first of many indications and if successful could easily be their next blockbuster. this won’t be a 4 compound, 6 indication company for long. i'd say hc wainwright's PT increase to $162 is still too low. 200+ here we come."
PADUFA on April 27th nothing and I mean nothing indicates any negatives!!!!! 6 years long!!!!
"Friday,6/19.. $121 at noon, then the rise..then the skyrocketing in the last 15 minutes to end near $129 on massive volume. Would love to have a hint what’s going on but that info doesn’t come easily."
Finally catching a bid.
@all. Won’t repeat. See my post 14 days ago. Ditto. Happy Father’s Day to all you guys who do their best to do the right thing everyday.
Oppenheimer has raised its price target on NBIX to $120 from $110; while keeping its OUTPERFORM rating. Oppenheimer analyst is Jay Olsen.
I am down 40k. stock and options !!! worrying.
"Why the big dip today, does someone know something?"
"The run in neurocrine is just the beginning as it is far from over. there are multiple of compelling catalysts in 2018 that could push its valuation to north of 10 billion. Nbix is expected to report elagolix’s uterine fibroids data by q1 and shortly after, an approval for elagolix in endometriosis by April 27. additionally, in the first half, investors should expect an update on its essential tremor trial, a data readout on its p2 PoC CAH compound, and an update from the FDA on whether or not Opicapone will need additional trials. In late 2018, we can expect a data readout from the phase2b T-force GOLD, Ingrezza, tourette syndrome(TS), trial. Also the timing of an announcement of a partnership of ROW rights for ingrezza could be right around the corner. Elagolix will become the SOC for uterine fibroids &endometriosis and could yield 4-5B in annual worldwide peak sales. If NBIX second product, Ingrezza, can expand its indications to HD, TS, PDD, its sales could easily exceed Elagolix. Ingrezza modulates dopamine release, so in theory, it may also possibly be used in ADHD, BPD, psychosis, schizophrenia. The two indications nbix is exploring for ingrezza, TD&TS, has a combined prevalence rate of about 1-1.2M. If NBIX can penetrate 10% of the market in which it dominates alone with austedo, then It could potentially yield 7.5B(100K*75K) in annual sales in the US. take note that those estimates does not include other indications, ROW sales, or OTC sales. Lastly, NBIX CAH compound ,although a small market, if successful, could be its 3rd blockbuster product if priced right( 100k-300k). With all this potential, it is insane to continue to see NBIX trade below a 3 digit price tag. 2018 PT- $135"
the second p3 UF data is out from Abbvie. Successfully met primary endpoint (.001) like the first p3.
I bought a little more at $76. Should be over $100 by second half.
Cheap hit piece on NBIX from Teva bull. Author lost all credibility in the end when started talking about institutional ownership (facepalm). Neurocrine: Time To Reduce? https://seekingalpha.com/article/4210162?source=ansh $NBIX $TEVA
"it looks like Opicapone does NOT need a new phase 3 study. Opicapone is the best in class COMT inhibitor over entacapone(shown in BIPARK) and better than Tolcapone(hepatotoxic). Opicapone is used in PD as an adjunct L-dopa therapy to reduce the negative side effects of L-Dopa and increase efficacy in on time. Current therapies with L-dopa includes Mao-Bi(selegiline, rasagiline), dopamine agonists&anticholinergics. Although, It is true that each of these classes are more suited for different uses, but in reality, many times they tend to overlap each other. Once Mao-Bi high cross reactivity with l-dopa, SSRI, antidepressants, decongesants comes to light, it will no longer be favorable.. Anticholinergics are not as effective and has an extensive side effect profile, including memory loss. Dopamine agonists increase dopamine levels and are associated with vascular &psychological problems(addiction, gambling, lust, movement). With all the negatives in current adjunct L-dopa treatments, opicapone will become SOC in the adjunct l-dopa market which is valued at a 1b-2B annual market. Ignore all the low estimates out there for opicapone as these estimates are a percentage of entacapone’s sales and not the overall market."
"FWIW, NBIX is the tenth largest holding of Fidelity Select Biotech. That's tenth out of 251 total holdings!"
abbvie is shelling out serious dough on endometriosis awareness! 1/10 of woman are affected with endo and if elagolix cant get 5b+ sales(UF+ENDO) with that LARGE market then i dont know what will.. also checkout #SPEAKENDO on twitter/IG.TV AD: https://www.ispot.tv/ad/wHe1/abbvie-endometriosisJulianne Hough Endorsement: http://bit.ly/2FjnfhO
Holding up very well considering IBB and overall market has been bleeding 4 days in a row now
NBIX reached a new All Time High at 95.43
"Biren Amin from Jeffries raises his PT to $124 from $105. He see's Orilissa doing over 3B in peak sales. Also, based on his quarterly survey on ingrezza, he see's a ""flattening"" TD market. He estimates ingrezza q2 sales of $83m. looks like jeffries comments on ""flattening"" TD market might have some investors spooked. regardless, ingrezza looks good in the LONG RUN."
If you look at the earnings report that came out last night it missed expectations with an EPS of $0.56. The report with adjusted EPS that Zachs has this morning says EPS of $0.79.
Is share price already factored in?
"i never doubted kevy for a second. 97M sales vs 83M consensus. 16700 TRX vs 12400 TRX a quarter earlier.ingrezza WILL become the next top selling CNS drug since abilify, seroquel, zyprexa, cymbalta(all 5b+ PS). once we expand indications TS(2.5b+), 3rd, &4th(2.5b+), ROW(2.5b+), we should easily do 10B+ in sales. its just a matter of time before we reach a mcap larger than BIOGEN. PT-$200"
"I wonder what this move up in the past couple of days could indicate. Could simply be people getting in before elagolix UF data readout, or it could be something else. Possibly buyout speculation with tax repatriation Holiday."
"when asked about m&a in conference, KG says ""We want to grow this company to into one of the, if not largest neuroscience companies in the world"". This WILL indeed HAPPEN. We will be as large as biogen in 5-10 years. If you project the cash flows of ingrezza&elagolix, we'll be looking at some very large inflows of cash which will be used to license/acquire more compounds. we have 800m cash sitting on sidelines and soon over 1b+ in cash. If we are not acquired(hopefully not), we'll eventually trade at a 50b+ mcap and will be the one acquiring other companies."
"In line revenue, beat eps, next q expenses going higher, reason why stock is down.What is the revenue and eps guidance for next q? I just saw the expense guidance in press release."
this is a steady riser. is it too late to get in though?
This board is so useless. Lots of newbies or shorts or just trolls. nbix is a CORE buy in biotech. Derisked by Ingrezza for TD alone which should rack up more than $2B on peak. $800m cash and growing revenues will allow them to look for potential acqusition targets.
Grew Ingrezza 32% Y/Y during the teeth of the pandemic. just amazing management to execute like they did in 2020
APPROVED!
Decent volume today. Keep it up!
This becoming crazy. I feel like there must be something going on. How many straight days of ~3% gains is this now?
This price is a steal for what the investor is getting !!!
"Valbenazine could generate $2.6B in top line revenue for both TD & TS, near term TD can generate $1,6B peak.Elagolix can generate $800M in royalties per year for both Endo & UF, $300M of that for Endo and that equates to near term $3.48 per share of top line royalty income and if you give it a 20X multiple = $70 PPSNBIX is undervalued at this price."
"I bought SAGE in the $40's a year ago; my wife was really unhappy when she saw our Schwab statement...now SAGE is $180 and she berates me for only buying 1,000 shares! NBIX could do the same thing..."
"I was not as impressed with the quarter. The growth in scripts was less than Q4. I would have liked to see more growth in scripts to it appears that growth is increasing, not decreasing. Long NBIX."
so allergan gets a CRL for their UF drug and abbvie announces positive extension data on elagolix for UF. also the new extension study showed an 88% response rate! thats vs a 68.5% and 76.2% response from the prior 2 UF studies. this new data is even more game changing! this means more eligible patients! in other news neurocrine announced ingrezza also helped patients in PD patients with levodopa induced dyskinesia. also their extension study showed a 75% response to ingrezza for TD! 75%!!!! that is almost unheard for psychiatric drugs! two drugs on its way to doing over 10b in combined sales. PT- $200
buy out on the horizon? no real news that has driven the PPS up 8 point in 2 trading days
"Extraordinarily strong grinding higher all day trade hints strongly to me that NBIX will now be ""exploring strategic options""."
got the following reply from investors relations.Hi -· We currently do not anticipate any impact to supply due to the impact of COVID-19.· We maintain adequate inventories of drug supply to further mitigate risk. Hope this helps.
In at $100.85 and stop will be below $98. There is some decent technical support at this level and it is oversold on the daily and weekly time frame. They also have a bunch of conferences next week to potentially pump this a bit. Long but with weak hands  on this one.
Please have a seat and fasten your seatbelt
Holie-smolie - $96.9M - What a number! I was hoping for $85M.Congrats longs.I think we should shortly see some revised pps targets$150 anyone!
"Wow, Mr. Market has just increased pre-P2 trial value of Luvadaxistat to $1.2B. If this is accurate the rest of NBIX's pipeline must be worth hundreds of billions!:)"
Double bottom reversal still in play. Combined with $ARRY buy out this is good entry point. Stay long.
"Another incredibly interesting point that came out during the Q1 CC was that they see their CAH drug as being a global development opportunity. CEO said in Q&A that they see it as their chance to establish a global presence by commercializing it in Europe by themselves. I think this is showing the company's commitment to becoming, as they said, one of the largest neuroscience companies in the world. I'm super excited at the long term prospects of the company, and kind of hope we don't get bought out in the near term before the company reaches it's full potential."
I think NBIX will make 25 to 30 cents in Q3 (depending on how much of the $40 million milestone payment they book). Revising my 2019 ESP to $1.55 from $1.40. Gorman is ahead of schedule and is not even trying to impress us much.
NBIX will be $120 before year end. Tremendous buy and hold stock!
Back over $80 soon; what a buying opportunity for a company headed to major biotech status.
Happy to see NBIX making its way back to 100. (10/17/19). Hope earnings give it a further boost.
how about no phase 3 for opicapine? nice!!
"Surprised at how little attention NBIX gets. I like it that way, but surprising. IMO it’s on the cusp of becoming a world class leader in the neuro space, which I think has unimaginable growth opportunities."
"I never thought I'd own another stock as good as AMGN. I was wrong, NBIX may be as good or better than AMGN!"
"Teva is launching an ad campaign for their competing drug for Tardive Dyskinesia. This could help raise awareness about the disease; which still has a huge unmet need. Short term NBIX stock price might take a hit, but longer term..."
"JP Morgan Healthcare Conference presentation on Monday, January 7th at 5:30pm. I hope they reveal something about drug sales by Abbvie."
NBIX reached a new All Time High at 84.68
Lately Nbix has price has slowed and zigzagged. But remember where we were last year. We may be the tortoise but Remember the tortoise won the race....
"I just listened to Kevin Gorman present at BAC/ML Healthcare Conference. I thought he did a fine job. Most of the time (30 minutes) was spent talking about Ingrezza and the salesforce. Gorman clearly knows what is going on in the field. When asked about the surprisingly good $300 million run rate for 2018; he replied, ""We are only just scratching the surface."" Ingrezza was launched in April of last year."
"Looks like Elagolix royalty is closer to 23% - WowFrom a few years ago:-""On a Thursday morning conference call to discuss Neurocrine, Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas suggested elagolix could account for peak annual sales in the U.S. and European Union of $1.2 billion in endometriosis, yielding a royalty of approximately $275 million to Neurocrine, and $1.9 billion annually for UF, for a royalty flow of $450 million annually.“Long term, this company has a lot of upside,” Karnauskas said. “It’s going to take time to get there because these trials take a while to run. Most of these products won’t be on the market until 2017.”Still, she characterized the potential opportunity for elagolix in UF as “underappreciated” by the Street."""
"nbix just announced preliminary results on ingrezza sales. revenue for the 4th qt comes in at $94M(64m ingrezza) which beats consensus by 18M or nearly a 40% beat. This would put neurocrine in profitable range. Also, despite, austedo launch, 80mg transition, and free 5 week ingrezza through inbrace program, management was still able to deliver another monster qt. with these results, i am more confident, that Ingrezza will become a multi blockbuster product. the next best CNS product since zyprexa, abilify, seroquel."
"From a TA standpoint, looks like a pretty good entry point to add some shares. I’ve said it before....approved drug, solid revenue stream, adequate COH, big biotech partnership & my fav intangible...west coast based. What’s not to like? Stay long my friends."
"No panic selling this morning? Too bad, I would have added more shares at $78."
If the stock was flat I would question the stock price given the good news across many fronts... but down close to $5 at 10:30 is insane. Hoping for a STRONG reversal.....
Day after day new All Time highs; I could get use to this.
Analysts composite 3Q earnings estimate $0.26? I'm thinking over $0.40 on $150 million in revenue. Should be back above $120 soon.
"“Train” stayed up on the plateau, finishing up $2. I’m pleased and hoping this is the new ‘normal’.Break through a new high at $76 and I’ll be ecstatic!"
AH spike due to NBIX joining SP 400. It will be especially important to see gains hold in these markets.
"surprised at the share price today. With ~240m in sales this quarter it looks like 2020 will almost certainly be the year they achieve $1b in revenue. I'm guessing it's related to Q1 guidance, which has been slower since launch."
"Ingrezza's expansion into other movement disorders(2mm+), TS, HD, PDD, schizophrenia is larger than both $VRTX's CF market and $ALXN's Soliris. If we consider TS/TD an OD, then in comparison to other OD companies(BMRN, VRTX, ALXN), neurocrine would potentially trade at a 40-50B mcap or at least a 450-550 PPS. In 2015, BMRN had a peak mcap of 23B and was doing 800m sales annually. Neurocrine is expected to reach those sales NEXT year...Soliris sales is estimated to peak at 5B.. Despite slowing growth, competition, OMS-721, and a 9B $GEVA's acquisition flop, it once traded at a 40B valuation.. In perspective, that is a 450 PPS for neurocrine.. ALXN's 5 year chart from 2010-2015, is a conservative portrayal of how neurocrine will perform going forward(from 4b to 40B).. the difference is, neurocrine WON'T poorly execute an acquisition($GEVA)... WON'T be SOLELY dependent on one product(soliris) vs elagolix&ingrezza.. The potential sales in elagolix+ingrezza is twice as large as soliris market. its just a matter of time that we will trade over a $500 PPS. give it 5 years."
Good things to shareholders who have been patient. Been with Nbix for many years and it’s paid off. I know the market can be fickle so just hang in there through ups and downs. Has great products and sales. Future is bright and that’s not a pump.
"is Ingrezza a lot better than Austedo? It is a lot more expensive.Neurocrine falls after Express Scripts excludes Ingrezza from formularyFri Apr 26 12:04:47 2019 EDTShares of Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) fell after Express Scripts (ESRX) listed the company's tardive dyskinesia treatment Ingrezza on its ""2019 National Preferred Formulary Exclusions."" In place of Ingrezza, Express Scripts recommends Teva's (TEVA) Austedo as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia. Shares of Neurocrine are down 5%, or $3.71, to $74.26 in midday trading. [Reference Link]:[https://www.express-scripts.com/art/pdf/Preferred_Drug_List_Exclusions2019.pdf]"
"FYI the TD market is large enough for BOTH Austedo & Ingrezza(IG). 600k patients are affected with TD. if Teva&NBIX each grab 5% of the market(30K) then they BOTH will do 2.25B(30k*74k) sales each. That doesnt include ROW, TS, OTC or other indications. If we compare austedo vs IG, we see that IG is SUPERIOR to austedo in every way, in efficacy, safety, and ease of use. Austedo’s threat of depression is REAL hence its blackbox label. Depression is a VERY common SE with dopamines modulators.. & best of all IG doesnt have any correlation with depression. IG once daily dose dominates over Austedo’s troublesome titration schedule. Since most TD patients are on a cocktail of meds, the simpler it is, the better it is for the patient. Lastly, IG has a higher efficacy than austedo.. if we compare kinect-extension to AIM-TD, then it shows IG is CLEARLY superior. Kinect has shown that the more time a patient is on IG, the better results it will yield. 6 weeks on IG SHOWS the SAME reduction in AIMS as 12 weeks on austedo.. 6 weeks vs 12 weeks!!! also if we compare the 12 weeks timeframe on IG, it shows that IG’s AIMS reduction is higher by one WHOLE point!!!! NBIX is very CHEAP at these levels. if we consider TD(2.5B+),TS(2.5B+), 3rd&4th indication(2.5b+), ROW(2.5b+) for IG, we're looking at 10b+ in potential sales by 2027. 150 PT by EOY. Also BIIB, you won’t be the largest CNS focused biotech for too long. NBIX is coming for you."
"oversold, bought at 90"
Rock solid. Doing everything right.
"it's interesting to note that even without the Abbvie milestone we hit positive cash flow for the quarter. The net income was 50m, and the milestone was 40m, so this represents the first quarter of profit from Ingrezza sales alone."
"I did, I sold at 109, so when do I rebuy?"
Has to be one of the Top 5 takeover targets for 2019.
Chardon Capital Markets has $139 target price on NBIX.
When NBIX breaks thru $91.82; it will take a crack at $95.
"Analyst estimates for June 2019 quarter; Revenues $164 million and EPS $0.13. I'm guessing they will beat both top and bottom line. Look for earnings of $4 in 2020 FY. At a p/e of 35, that's $140 per share. That's over 60% upside from current price ($87)!"
"it's pretty disingenuous to call this a miss when all the analysts changed their expectations after they preannounced their results. This was a great quarter, and the company continues to deliver each quarter."
"Why are NBIX insiders selling ? They sold 972,091 shares over the last 12 months...TXMD's insiders are not selling....I wonder why....."
"If you invest partially on TA, this chart is about as good as it gets. Add in what I’ve posted previously ( approved drug, positive cash flow, large COH, partnerships, & west coast base) and lets just say, there are way more risky biotechs out there. This one is itching to get to 100."
Elagolix will be a blockbuster drug and provide NBIX with steady royalty stream. Aprroval in 2Q almost assured.
very small reaction to positive UF p3 results... the market size for elagolix in UF is VAST.. more than 25% of woman are affected with UF.. and 10% of women affected with ENDO.. elagolix will easily be SOC and do 5b+ in sales in indications UF&ENDO.
"just some key takeaways from leerink.. Gorman says entacapone lacks efficacy&safety over opicapone and mentions that entacapone has a troublesome 6-8 daily dosing schedule. He also clarifies the applicable market for opicapone: he says 1m patients are affected with PD, 60% are on l-dopa, and half of those on L-dopa are not well controlled. that translates to about 300,000 patients for opicapone. see my post below on WHY opicapone will be SOC for adjunct l-dopa therapy.. If we price opicapone similarly to entacapone& tolcapone, we get a 60k price tag. Just 10k PD patients =600m annual sales(10k*60k).. opicapone is the best in class COMT inhibitor and surely the most under appreciated asset.."
"It's nice that the call is going to be so after the PDUFA date, so we'll be able to get the management's impressions on whatever transpires."
"I bought all the way up to $80.00....stay long with this winner. Up again today After Hours to $119.02 which is another All Time High. Thanks for Stifel's call, Demetrius..."
Sweet! New all time high!
Neurocrine Biosciences is up 7.00% to 124.65
"NBIX has my fav biotech winning attributes...proven disruptive technology with revenue stream, institutional support, cash reserves ($500 million), big pharma partnership & finally ( although anecdotal and likely to generate some rebuttals..) ...west coast based ....what’s not to like?"
I'm waiting for the cash to really start poring in and then the dividends to start flowing.My new price target is $220. I'm in at least till then.
"For Q1, Ingrezza sales reported were 71.1M, which is a 7.3M beat to consensus. Another solid QT by neurocrine's management. TRx were 12,500 vs 9100 a quarter earlier. Despite the hurdles i mentioned in the last post(PRE- ER), NBIX management unbelievably still managed to grow very robust TRx. Base on the current TRx numbers(12,500), we can assume there are roughly 4000-4500 patients on ingrezza. Keep on mind this patient number was achieved in 11 months of launch! Between austedo& ingrezza, out of the 500k-600k TD patients, the estimated penetration rate for both comes to roughly 60-90k patients or 30-45k ea. This implies a peak sales of 2.25B to 3.375B for TD ONLY. At the current trajectory of growth, we are well ahead of the curve to see roughly 30k patients by 2023 or 2.25B(30k*75k). If given time, label expansions, ROW, Ingrezza will eventually be on the list of top multi blockbuster meds of all time. Also, management has moved forward with T-FORCE platinum which FURTHERS strengthen’s their confidence in the TS program. We can expect an SNDA FDA meeting as early as 1H of 2019. TS is expected to do another 2.5B in sales on top of TD. I’d say TS is barely priced into current share price. If it was, we should be easily be trading above a 200+ PPS."
This is by far one of my fav stocks. For a biotech it just seems so solid. Even when it dips I stay calm & usually buy more. Just has good mojo.

$135 in a buy-out by AbbVieNBIX has the goods in Ingrezza and Elagolix
This pharma has very undiscovered value in the pipeline. NBI 74788 has high chances to succeed in classic CAH based on the data available for the older molecule NBI 77860. There are about 25K patients in US. If priced between $100-150K per patient this is easily $1B+ drug on peak with 25% penetration. There are NO currently effective approved therapies to target CAH. Corticosteroids are not the option in many cases due to heavy side effects.
"I was kind of hoping that Neurocrine would be in line this quarter as they have guided so I could buy more shares on the cheap, but it looks like this company has no intention of slowing down."
Two good days of share price increase before earnings…could we be looking at an earnings beat and better guidance?
Gorman went to JPM to sell the company Biotech M&A is going to be rampant over the next 6 months
Was this already priced in??? Stock is barely moving on this blockbuster news.

What did Gorman say in London this morning at the healthcare conference?
"Net loss of 5.9m only a year into the launch is crazy to me. With their 800m in cash and Ingrezza already closing in on breakeven, I hope they start deploying more of their resources to earlier stage compounds. I'm pleased that they're using it to fund the expansion of the sales force, but they've got so much free cash it would be great if they put more of it to use. By the time they need it for the launch of opicapone and tourrettes, Ingrezza in TD will be generating positive cash flow for them. I hope the they're actively searching for early stage acquisitions, partnerships, or developing new compounds in-house. They've mentioned earlier this year that they have a new compound from their labs entering the clinical stage, but we still have no information on it yet. Ideally, with their cash position, they could have multiple exciting early stage compounds in development."
It would be nice for NBIX to finish the year on a high note.
"Aside from a major move yesterday,11/4, NBIX is not showing any strength. More upsetting is when it’s SP is down on days like today,11/5 and the market is up 550pts. Over the last couple of weeks this has happened before, down with the market way up. I’ve owned this for many years and have sizable stake, so a major slide, minus $8/share and straight line down all day hurts badly. I don’t think earnings will be our savior either according to the analysts I follow. I’d love an upside surprise but I’m afraid that’s wishful thinking."
big drop...very little news to provide insights or clues to go forward.
Wednesday’s excellent action is a combination of two things in my opinion. #1 reflects my idea that NBIX was oversold and sentiment had been been influenced negatively by that. #2 once the tide turned I believe shorts started getting nervous and that snowballed in our favor. Over the next few days we’ll get confirmation of the correct direction and certainly hope that’s upward.
"ngrezza’s launch continues to be the best SMID CNS product launch in a very LONG time. 8 months in, and NBIX is already profitable. In fact, Ingrezza’s launch is better than both abilify & seroquel, which are on the list of top best selling drugs of all time. Although not exactly apples to apples, but In comparison, Abilify first 16 months of launch did a COMBINED 308M in sales.. and ended up doing an annual peak sales of 7.4B. Take in consideration that BMY had a partner(Otsuka) help market the drug.. and was also given a FDA approval intent letter MONTHS before actual approval day. Secondly, seroquels launch was no better.. 28 months into launch and seroquel was doing only 232M in annual sales.. and ended up doing peak annual sales of 6.2B. Keep in mind, both abilify& seroquel early sales also included ROW sales.. meanwhile, Ingrezza has yet to tap into ROW. Currently Ingrezza’s launch is far ahead of the curve for typical multi-blockbuster CNS drugs and I won’t be surprised if ingrezza gets into the list of 5B+ selling drugs. just a meager 10% penetration of the US TD market , gives ingrezza an annual peak sales of 4.44B(60,000*74,000). additionally, Ingrezza could also be expanded for the use in other movement disorders(2mm+), HD, TS, PDD, schizophrenia, etc. it will be just a matter of time when this starts to trade above $200 PPS."
"Nice Friday,5/29. Hopefully the newest FDA approval for uterine fibroids will give them a further boost next week. Be nice to see a new high.. only $3.50 more to get there.Institutions own the vast majority of this, they are the ones that move the needle up or down in major shifts."
"Also, does anyone know if this type of preliminary earnings report is normal? I have yet to see something like this happen, so can anyone with more experience let me know why a company would do this, instead of waiting the usual ~ 1 month."
Say goodbye to any takeout premium
"Many years back , I bought 300 $NBIX @ $5.75 per share . When she fell to the high $3's , I got scared and sold . Seven months later $NBIX was in the $40 range ! I've lived and learned ."
"I agree, very good and solid growth company.....strong buy , maybe a buyout by Celgene?"
"FWIW, NBIX is the ten largest holding of Fidelity Select Biotechnology. That's tenth out of over 251 holdings!"
"very impressive sales this quarter. Around ~45m more than Q1. At this rate, I think 2020 is gonna be the year Ingrezza hits $1 billion in revenue."
"Somethings cooking, might be tied to options contracts or something more... Don't even think of selling until NBIX hits $100."
What’s not to love?
"There was some great information about Olrissa launch in the Abbvie conference call. They said they anticipate less than 50 million in 2018. They also said they would launch a DTC campaign 6 months after launch. Here's what the CEO had to say in regards to label and launch activity. Okay. First, on ORILISSA, there isn't any monitoring requirements in the label. So -- but maybe let me back up a little bit and talk about what are the key attributes of this product in order for it to be successful, and then I'll talk about the ramp. So if you think about this area, what you would want to get the maximum value out of an asset in this area is, one, you want a drug that gives high levels of efficacy; has a relatively clean safety profile; fast on/fast off because many of these women are reproductive age, and they want -- if they choose to become pregnant or try to become pregnant, you want a drug that they can stop taking and then they -- therefore, they can move forward from a pregnancy standpoint. You want a label that allows for clinical diagnosis, not diagnosis by a lab, which is what we have. We wanted 2 doses because you have different levels of pain among these women, and so you want to be able to titrate the dose depending upon their level of pain and your ability to be able to control that pain over time. We've obviously gotten that in the label. You want the ability to be able to maintain therapy for a relatively long period of time, and we were extremely pleased with the duration of the low dose being 2 years. And you don't want monitoring or any kind of a black box for a drug of this size or of this nature, rather. So we've gotten everything that we hoped for in the label. We priced it in a way that it's designed to get relatively rapid uptake. It's priced at roughly 30% lower than Lupron, which is one of the competitive alternatives that's available. And so I think we priced it in a way that should enhance the ramp. Now having said that, there hasn't been a therapy -- a new therapy in this area in, I don't know, 15 or 20 years. And because of that, physicians aren't used to prescribing medical therapy for it. So -- and patients aren't necessarily used to seeking therapies other than pain management kinds of therapies for it. And so there is an education element that has to occur. Now we've started that disease awareness campaign already. We started it a couple months ago, and we're going to continue to run that disease awareness campaign. I think the early returns would suggest it's working well. 6 months post the approval, we will launch then a branded DTC campaign for the drug. And so it's more a function of just getting the patients engaged in a way that they'd go to their physicians and seek therapy for this condition; and number two, then educating physicians of what are the attributes of this product and how should it be used. And so that drives a different ramp than an HCV, as an example, where you get a very rapid uptake. So it has a softer ramp on the front end because of that. But I'd say if I look at every attribute of the product from a label standpoint, all the attributes of the product and where we priced it are designed to ultimately give you maximum value. And we believe this is a multibillion-dollar opportunity for us. -"
What is with the AH appreciation today?
Come to papa...GLTAL....we’ll gap up. Hopefully won’t drop back below 90 if “gap fills” and as I’ve posted below very bullish triple reversal chart pattern stays in play.
Strong showing by NBIX on a weak day for the markets.
"Although Abbvie never released an official PDUFA date, I think it's safe to assume that it will be by the end of July. They announce 6 month priority review October 27th, which would bring the initial PDUFA to April 27th. With the 3 month extension, we are left at a PDUFA date of no later than July 27th. In a recent conference, CEO Kevin Gorman noted that there is no mention of anything liver related (the reason for the extended review) in the NEJM article analysing the data. I think this is a pretty safe bet to approval in 3 weeks."
I had no idea such a large part of their market cap was based on the success of Luvadaxistat - never even heard of this product before today. Yet Mr. Market says it was worth at least $650M!
I think insider selling sort of quells the buyout theory at least for now. I still trust the company to be able to execute by themselves.
If we can break above 90 we’ll be back on track. Technicals will confirm triple bottom reversal. Hang in there. Been pretty painful 9 months. Good luck to those who struck around. I’m long 80K shares.
Please target price
NBIX reached a new All Time High at 91.14
"This is not priced in considering boxed warning risks. we received a clean label. no mention of hepatotoxicity or osteoporosis. By EOD this should move up considerably. elagolix is a 5b+ multi blockbuster with ENDO doing over 2b sales. elagolix is also being explored in UF which could put total peak sales above 5B. Also, ABBVIE has been very active in educating physicians& patients about ENDO. Also many celebrities(halsey, whoopi, tia, julianne hough, dolly etc) have come forth to speak about their endometriosis suffering. its not surprising that $ABBV has invested a significant amount of time & $ on awareness as ENDO & UF is a large market opportunity. going forward, elagolix will replace a huge chunk of humira's sales.. humira sales force are now moving toward marketing elagolix.. neurocrine could easily collect billions in annual CF."
That dip in $70s - low $80s was amazing opportunity to add or initiate position. lots of good things should happen by eoy. on the way to $120-130 by end of year. On positive TS P2 data we probably will be looking at $150+
Is there any reason whatsoever to keep this stock? it's on a steady downturn since July.
@Dennis. Suspect basing until next leg up
"Remember when KG said ""We want to grow this company to into one of the, if not largest neuroscience companies in the world"". This WILL indeed HAPPEN. We will be as large as biogen in 5-10 years. If you project the cash flows of ingrezza&elagolix, we'll be looking at some very large inflows of cash which will be used to license/acquire more compounds. we have 800m cash sitting on sidelines and soon over 1b+ in cash. If we are not acquired(hopefully not), we'll eventually trade at a 50b+ mcap and will be the one acquiring other companies. $200.00 here we come !"
"teva reports 44M in sales for austedo. this is in comparison to 30m in sales from a quarter earlier. this goes to show how much more of a dominate player ingrezza is in the TD field. austedo's sales increased 14M, while ingrezza sales increased 26M. also, it should be mentioned that austedo's recommended dosing (48mg) costs over 120k vs ingrezza's 74K (80mg). even though austedo's price per script(PPS) is higher & has a 2nd indication(HD), ingrezza still manages to have a higher net sales growth. based on austedo's &ingrezza's TRX #'s, the estimated combined patient penetration is roughly ~7-8K patients. although impressive(within 1yr of launch), this is only a fraction of the 600K patients in the market. a 10% penetration split between austedo& ingrezza looks reachable by 2023-2024 which could easily yield both drugs a combined 5B in sales. further expansion of indications beyond TS(2.5B PS), will put ingrezza on the table with the likes of abilify, seroquel & zyprexa(in terms of top PS CNS drugs)."
"Allergan's serious liver problems with Esmya, EMA review, behind this delay;looks like FDA mostly giving cover to Allergan."
This is the very best stock bar none !!! Buy all you can right here !!!
with no exceptions this is one of best risk / rewards in biotech out there. We are potentially looking at about $3B in cash flow in 2022-23. Gorman is man with a plan. Still majorly underfollowed and kept well in secret co lol.
"so KG just stated that all double sales from 40mg has fully transition to 80mg in the 4th qt. this is important, since price per patient were expected to drop roughly 30% but yet ingrezza sales grew 42.2% or a 78.5% growth in scripts(9100 vs 5100). also, David(EX-CFO) expected the 40mg to 80mg transition to fully integrate through a few quarters and since it happened all throughout the 4th QT, it makes the ER numbers look even better than they are now!"
Question to all you smart people: Is NBIX just an ABBV coat-tails play collecting milestone $ + royalties?
Bought more at $77 area; drug approval will make it fly back over $90.
Big news coming soon; this will spike to $120!
Love it
"This company will be acquired, like a lot of pharma cos these days. Probably at a 45#$%$ premium"
This company is so undervalued it’s actually hard to fathom.
Abbv should consider buyout at $190.00. About $18 billion.Feedback greatly appreciated.
No real reaction to the EPS miss; which was widely expected. I guess it’s all in the CC.
Run NBIX Run. My year end price target is 120 on this one and 100 on SRPT.
An approved drug. Sales trajectory positive. Partnership with a big dog (ABBV). $800 million COH. What’s not to like?
Ingrezza already has an annual revenue run rate of over half a billion!That's some start!
I may be wrong & often am but this month’s downdraft has nothing to do with the fundamentals of this stock. I’ve been buying on each morning’s drop.
"Not to be repetitious...but I will be for anyone who is unsure. This is why you want to own this stock, 1. Positive revenue stream with large COH ( no secondary ) 2. Disruptive technology (with expanding indications) 3. Partnership with large biopharma (ABBV) 4. West coast based . Don’t wait for Elagolix approval."
"Incredible quarter, sales growth, profits, cash build, another fda marketing approval....and all in the disaster of of Covid-19. Spectacular operational performance! Hard to believe."
Any buyout news?
