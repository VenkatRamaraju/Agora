amazon sending folks to align them for a acquire it seems. Can bid up to $100/share may be?
Who said Cathie Woods can't save us?? She trying really hard with 17 million shares and growing! She predicts huge upside going into next year!!
With the arc buy! We’ve got traction!
"This is How Skillz going to grow by 10,000% with one simple thing in the future when they will be ready to do that Skills currently focus on competition for cash, (Legal gambling) which not aloud in Google Play, if you under 18 and in some countries and states, In the near future Skillz will remove the GPS and restrictions to let everyone everywhere to play their games with options “not for real money” and will accumulate this hundreds of millions users to their platform legally and they will make money on this user base from brand sponsorships, in app purchases and in-game adsThey avoid doing it right now because they want to enlarge the tournaments sectors with more games, developers and users"
11.7 today if not into 12(s)??
Buy while you still can do it under $12!
Ready for take off…. Back to $30+ sooon
ARK bought SKLZ again yesterday in one of their ETF’s. They know technology well. That’s a pretty good endorsement to me.
Just played the games on the app. Very addictive but at the same time very unfair. Not like they advertised. I'm invested but a little nervous if people come out stating how unfair it actually is when you play for real money.
"Someone said: “When people are hating on you, you must be doing something right because they see you as a threat”. This message board displays this quote hahaha. Shawties are panickingggggg"
At least 18% up today
"Just got back into SKLZ. Owned the SKLZ early made a lot going from $11 to $30 and SOLD !. What I noticed is 2 things. First it looks like they might have moved up their earnings date , USUALLY A positive. More importantly Cathy Woods and MorganStanley HOLD monster positions and HAVE NOT SOLD ANY while the stock declined from $40 to $8. In fact Woods added some recently. With a monster position losing money seems this close to earnings she knows the report will be good. I expect this company will be sold in time to somebody , maybe DKNG ? Or someone else . Morgan Stanley""s investment bankers will find a home for Skillz and find a way for them and Cathy to get out at much better price than today!"
Don’t Drop
We don't need Cathie to save us!! The stock is severely underpriced given the growth prospects!! She of course recognizes that so she's holding 3 to 4 hundred MILLION dollars worth!! Surprised she didn't buy more at these discounted prices! 2 huge events NEXT year!! Entrance into INDIA first quarter and NFL contract!! BOOM!?
Skillz will be 17 by fri
I s it a good time to buy or should I waitb

"Stock has gotten back to APril levels, more or less, still holding for much bigger gains, back over $20.00 this year, yes, this year"
Anyone see Arkk fund bought 2.1 million shares of Sklz yesterday. Talk about a huge buy.
Q3 earnings will be released next Weds. So I assume the big institutional investors (including Cathie Wood) are loading up expecting good results. I'm calling $12 next week.
89 million shares are short per Ortex. 31.57% of the float is short. A squeeze can last for days...
89 million shares are now short per Ortex. That is 31.58% of the entire free float. They have increased it by 9 million shares in the last week alone to try and hold it from going higher. The shorts are trapped!
Crypto gaming coming soon to platform
Ive never actually seen so many scared shorts in any forum in my life gonna have to buy more
Great long-term hold!!! Growing quarter over quarter! Will probably be about 20 PPS by end of year just because of the MASSIVE opening in INDIA!!
Great time to buyy
"Winter soon, going up to $30 EOY"

"Cathy loaded 18,000 more shares yesterday!!! Virtually every day she buys more!!!!"
"This is SO UNDERVALUED! EASY +$11 Today!EASY above $15 Before ER, EASY +$30 after ER!"
Any expectations about the upcoming quarterly? Could it be a good catalyst towards $ 15?
"This is just the beginning just wait, they're coming for you shortie.Giddy up!!!!"
Paul must be the second shift paid basher. Hope he’s better than the first shift. Wonder if the hedgies pay a second shift bonus.

Do you guys think this gets back to $30 anytime soon? Seems to be stuck here.
After six months of declines in the stock price we are finally seeing strong momentum into earnings. 26-30 range due by EOY and next year all time highs. Shorts are coming out strong now….worried much 
After earnings back to 9$
Just imagine when they start implementing Cryptocurrencies ... enter now or stay outside looking.
5 million shares 1st hour of trading.Giddy up Sklz!!
One of the FASTEST GROWING COMPANIES in the top one hundred!! Can you even begin to imagine what the NFL contract is going to bring in!! I don't believe they'll be able to continue growing 100 percent year over year but 50 to 75 percent works for me!!
Cathy Wood bought 200000 plus shares today!!!
If that isn't a SPAM bot posting under 20 different names every 10 seconds then I really feel bad for the guy doing it
Shorts sweating buckets! To the moon baby
"Trivia Crack twice more downloads than Roblox, and Skillz not open to gamers under 18 Yet, and this is just one game out of thousands of games and the thousands of games is just a portion out of thousands of gaming studios that working for Skillz…. Giant in the making"

"—Suggestion: “Artificial, Absurd” and all your other 12 names…although great names to describe *yourself… -how ‘bout ya chill on “The sky is falling” shtick. And use 1 name and post less than 82 times a day. Your thoughts?"
Show me ur SkLZ!!
"Still see this company undervalued, read a great article about hedge funds dumping SKLZ along with ARK continuing to buy more, We will see a nice bull run start here over the next few months!"
" if you’re still holding Skillz, all longs unite for the upcoming earnings report! Can’t wait to see how well they performed with the edition of the trivia game."
Makes you wonder if there wasn't a earnings leak! We'll know if it quickly jumps 2 bucks before EARNINGS!!
Wood just bought a ton of this. I am in.
Waiting for earnings report. If it drops than I average down. Missed 8 this time. Good moves skills made lately. Ark added. Holding from 29 and averaging down.
"How do developers win with Skillz?Most mobile games don't turn a profit. Their developers make little money, and the ads and in-game purchases designed to make that money end up driving away users. Skillz avoids those inconveniences, leading players to spend more time daily playing on the Skillz platform than the average daily time users spend on popular apps like Tik Tok, YouTube, Facebook, or Snapchat, and twice as much time played than the industry average for mobile gaming.Over 30,000 game developers are making more money and growing their customer base faster by spuring traditional advertising and in-game purchases, and instead hosting their games on Skillz's eSports platform. Players pay a fee each time they enter a game or tournament. Roughly 85% of those payments go toward prizes, incentives, and developer profit share; the rest, nearly 15%, goes to Skillz.""most small and medium-sized developer studios own 100% of any game failures. If they have a hit game that hits double-digit millions in revenue, they have to typically sell it to a bigger company, due to not being able to support the game at scale.""Skillz eliminates these challenges for developers, handling business needs such as technical support, operations, and analytics on how players are using games. This allows developers to continue to do what they do best: Focus on making more great games."
Someone will acquire Sklz 100%
"It is extremely Dangerous to hold through the Loss Report! There is No upside potential.The question is will SKLZ drop by 45-50%, or will the drop extend to 70%."
"Moving into INDIA 1.5 BILLION, gee maybe we'll pick up a few players over the next year with several new games being released, NFL contract, 700 million and NO DEBT!! See you guys at 20+ sooner than you think!!"
Back over $20.00 after earnings....
market mostly red SKLZ staying green.
"Well shorts, you're down another 4.5%. Why don't you make it easy on yourselves, close your positions and give the longs all your money now. It will soon be ours anyway. Then you can file all the bogus law suits you want, get nothing and cry into your pillows at night."
—See what you can do to get this back to $18+
Shorts with bizarre fear inducing usernames are panicking on here lol
Follow the money.
You are absolutely BLIND if you don't see the explosive GROWTH in this one of a kind gambling gaming platform!! They've spent 200 million in Huge partnerships that'll come together next year!!
I follow the CEO on instagram and couple days ago he was at the meeting with cathie wood in vegas then cathie bought 2m shares ? She must know something we don’t yet.
"—I’d like it to go to $14.71 before earnings… You people on margin buy it up! Actually, get off margin."

"Cathie Wood bought another 202,000 shares on Monday, Oct 25th. 3 consecutive days of buying Skillz. She decided to buy one week BEFORE earnings. Most funds wait and buy after earnings. Has now bought 2.8 million shares in last 3 days. Holding 20 million shares now. Good Luck all!!"
