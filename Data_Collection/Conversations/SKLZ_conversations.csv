"According to bloomberg, most shorted stock SKLZ. Guys, be ready for turbulence ahead. Please keep buying this so that Wall Street have to cover the shorts..."
It seems like a squeeze could happen today
This is a long term play. It has always been touted as that. That being said. I'm pee'd off that it is not doing better.
"At one point, Amazon lost more than 90% of its value. But long-term investors still got rich."
"Do you think Morgan Stanley with 32,739,214 shares, ARK with 19,975,090 shares, Vanguard 11,490,548 shares, Blackrock 10,791,328 shares and other whales with avg price of 20$ (according to 13D/F fillings) going to let short sellers like Citadel rollover their hundreds of millions of dollars investments? And also investors who bought at second offering at 24$ (720,000,000$ worth of stocks). I'm sure GREEN days are coming, Skillz and partners are working on big news. I would not dare to short Skillz right now."

"SKLZ: 4B Cap, 70M net loss Q2RBLX: 47B Cap, 140M net loss Q2"
"The stock is heavily traded... investors, don’t make the mistake of reacting to trades ... don’t say you didn’t know"
Volume picking up nicely. We just might start a little run back to $15.
"MGM could be interested in buying SKLZ, according to Seeking Alpha article with CTFN as the ultimate source. I somehow doubt SKLZ board would be willing to approve it - unless the offer would be exceptionally good. There is too much growth ahead for SKLZ."
Green!?!
"Don Pugatch, has a target of $26per share for SKLZ."
Game ban from China.
I'm gonna call the WHAMBULANCE for 80% of the people on this chat. No risk no reward. They have tons of cash on hand and 2 solid acquistions. They are also about to move into Inda.
I love searching this company in Fintel.
