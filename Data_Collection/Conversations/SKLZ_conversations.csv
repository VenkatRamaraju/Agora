"That's why I told, patience is a must in the Share market. Hopefully, within another couple of weeks, everybody will gain ....."
"if you bought stocks based on unverified news, you are still ok in the long term as the company will do very well. But if you bought short exp calls and news turns out flat, u r rekt"
Very disappointed
IT'S ALMOST TIME MY FELLOW LONGS. TO 20 AND BEYOND!

"Do you think Morgan Stanley with 32,739,214 shares, ARK with 19,975,090 shares, Vanguard 11,490,548 shares, Blackrock 10,791,328 shares and other whales with avg price of 20$ (according to 13D/F fillings) going to let short sellers like Citadel rollover their hundreds of millions of dollars investments? And also investors who bought at second offering at 24$ (720,000,000$ worth of stocks). I'm sure GREEN days are coming, Skillz and partners are working on big news. I would not dare to short Skillz right now."
Pump over
is there any catalysts to this company soon?
The MGM offer has to be at least $18 per share.
Short bankrupt tomorrow
"$46 again before end of the year,1.4B India market enter, NFL Game, exit games partnerships, Arki acquisition…Etc, this is huge 200B a year market and Skillz is well positioned"

"Acquisition or not, and even regardless of fundamentals,too much of big monies tied up on SKLZ,,,,They need to recoup some anyway, that's good enough reason to expectthat they gonna pump SKLZ up to at least 20 level."
I'm gonna call the WHAMBULANCE for 80% of the people on this chat. No risk no reward. They have tons of cash on hand and 2 solid acquistions. They are also about to move into Inda.
what is the whole commotion about??
Breakout could be imminent
MGM offers $25.5 per share

After hours look juicy... bye bye shorts... positive trend is starting to form
This is a long term play. It has always been touted as that. That being said. I'm pee'd off that it is not doing better.
Still dropping after hours do I take a 50% loss and sell .
Nice reversal. If not buying now then when?
Sklz has gone up from almost $10 to $11.30 in a few days along with some good news. Promising.
"The last offer was supposedly $24 per share. That's too low. If there are negotiations going on, I think they are negotiating a better price. Maybe around $30. Just me doing some guessing."
I love searching this company in Fintel.
MGM buyout at $32 per share?Check with Wall Street Journal.
"MGM Resorts is also reportedly considering buying betting behemoth Flutter Entertainment and mobile esports company Skillz, according to CTFN, which reports on mergers and acquisitions. Flutter Entertainment is an Irish bookmaking holding company created by the merger of Paddy Power and Betfair. Flutter operates Fanduel, the largest U.S. online sports betting business.INVESTORS BUSINESS DAILY"
"paper trading calling out entry or enter after stock jumped, buy at the peak on $SKLZ, then when next day it dropped -15%, he said bought more today, same sheeeet Warrior Monk who now uses ""My Name is Nobody"" alias had been calling ""bought today"" on $SKLZ since $30+ back in March."
Every rally attempt has been getting shorted right back down... shorts have gotten very comfortable with this and for a good reason... but one of these days the rally will blow right past them and we're going to have a massive short squeeze!
we might wake up tomorrow with a buyout offer and go straight to the moon load up now you may not have another chance ! $MGM
Short squeeze
Nice.
This could pop to $20 anyday I've seen it happen with just the slightest news
"When the Market let you buy as much as you can buy at this low price for extended period of time, thestock will no rise and will continue to tank 95% of the time. Remember this golden rule and put your emotion aside."

THE SPRING IS COILED AND READY
Any official buyout announcement and the shorts are toast
Selling Ford & going all in on SKLZGood Luck Everyone 
"first day of confirmation that this is inflection point,,,,,,I expect, at least one dollar up......let's wait and see,,,,,"
$SKLZ just tweeted out about the NFL partnership announced in February. Can't imagine this move is based on that though...
intrinsic value is $17.50 - $18.00
Where is the support for this
Looks like $TDAC is pulling a sympathy move along with $SKLZ?? It started to move at the same time this afternoon as $SKLZ did. I don't see them merging.....but stranger things have happened. Both are up in AH and will do well tomorrow. Time to burn the shorts!! GLTA!!

FROM $40 TO $10 ... BOUGHT 1000 SHARES AT $10.20 HOPE THIS IS THE BOTTOM

Game ban from China.
Based on the 5 sell side analysts who offered a 12-month price target in the last three months. Analysts predict a 75.12% increase from today. I think this is Moderate and hold for a month or 2.
"Well, this is a nice surprise! Will be curious what tomorrow brings"

"For those who compare this company to ZNGA does not know SKLZ business model. ZNGA is a game developer. SKLZ is a platform. You can say SKLZ is a competitor of FB, but not ZNGA."
Let’s gooooo
Anyone else down almost 70% on this?
It need to go up 400% to equal the price on Feb 5
So many will be sorry for selling sklz
SKLZ will double up our cash at the current price shortly
good start this week as long as it keeps going up even a bit day by day will be good sign to see it solidify around 22.5
It seems like a squeeze could happen today
what is going on? this is going under 10 they said
Stock was at $11.10 just yesterday before the selloff. We should at least get there today
"✓ AARKI already working on the Skillz user acquisition. So MAU will grow at lower price for sure.✓ EXIT GAMES (Photon) will give 1v1 and multiplayer solution to Skillz and also opens door to it's 586,062 developers.✓ India market is in the next 3 months already! (Uhhh....time fly fast)✓ NFL game in 2022This is only available public information out there, but imagine all the work and possible partnerships behind the scenes. Just mindblowing. The staff grew from 170 people to 451 in 1 year! And currently have 338 open positions. Shorts made a killing by shorting Skillz, but longs will be rewarded as well soon enought. SKLZ will be most hyped stock in 2022! Mark my words."
"Dead meat for SkLZ. ""NYSE: SKLZ Investor Notice: Lawsuit Against Skillz Inc Announced by the Shareholders Foundation"". Target $2."

"Volume keeps going up, shorts will be bankruptcy maybe tomorrow"
"I love all the new people posting how cheap this still is, where were all of y’all for the past 2 weeks?"
"Something's happening here... whether or not the takeover rumors are real, it's worth a gamble at this level... stock is way oversold either way..."
Like longs have been saying.... this is undervalued if you are looking for a new industry niche ... it’s cheap like insane.... wait until the India announcement this year and the nfl winner ... not to mention arkki and exit games revenue and synergy
Slingshot engaged!! Boy o boy!!
Love losing money! So much fun! Fml
It was mentioned in cnbc (najarian)Everyone talking about buying calls Tomorrow is green finally… lets go

With MGM and high short position this should go to the moon!!!This is the best MEME stock high shorts.
I feel there are more to this market than we know. Ask for a proper guidance before investing in this pretty much complicated market. I've made over 6 btc from an allocation of 1.5 btc over the last 2 months using Mr Brad Johnson help. Things might get worse so just make the smarter move. He can be contacted via T*e*l*e*g*r*a*m; brad015
"Esports gaming platform Skillz hooks users more than Netflix and Facebook together, giant 250B revenue industry of mobile gaming is the fastest biggest growth industry on the market"
"""Lawsuit against SKLZ by shareholders""? OK. Fake news???"
"Holding a strong gain today, good job"
Been consolidating for a good while now. Run up is imminent!
"there is insider news on big hiring spree underway for upcoming big events, which match on their career site as well..."
Will average down from 19 now that a base in the 10s has formed. It's going to just spin for months here before it moves up again! patience!
So where is the news on this buyout that everybody’s talking about￼
"There are hundreds of millions of NFL fans worldwide, and 150 million people play Trivia Crack each year. As these new games come out, even a small percentage of players from these brands coming over to the Skillz platform will cause significant user growth for the business.Skillz is expanding outside of North America to help grow its user base. India is the company's first new major market, and holds roughly 365 million mobile gamers, more than the entire U.S. population."
Bought another 500 shares... sitting on 15500 shares and bullish as F
What’s the link to the news please
I just now saw trivia crack news. That’s a big deal. A very big deal.
RBLX: 50B Cap report 140M losesI can see SKLZ with international and premium new games go there Q4
"Love how paid bots and spammers being out of context again. Please, bash with facts at least."
meme stocks catching fire again....that money should ultimately find it's way back into sklz as this is a beaten down hypergrowth meme stock
"GOOD NEWS!!! Additionaly 150 million active users!SAN FRANCISCO, August 19, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The most popular mobile trivia game in history, Trivia Crack is coming to Skillz (NYSE: SKLZ), the leading mobile games platform bringing fair and fun competition to players worldwide, the company announced today. As the number-one trivia franchise in the world, Trivia Crack is a global phenomenon available in more than 180 countries, 34 languages, and has more than 150 million active users annually."
"I got 5000k at $18.5 so with me, it go up or down 5% or 10% I have to keep"
Hope we can jump on a short squeeze like BBIG and SPRT recently!
"Remember the last run ups we had? For a week straight, we made a 10-30% gain every day. DO NOT MISS OUT THIS TIME!"
"Shorts will need to start covering soon. Once the SKLZ train starts rolling, it rolls HARD. History repeats itself"
Didn't SKLZ get a deal with the NFL to create an app?
I would say a 12.5% jump in one day should say something is brewing
"This article is from 08/10/2020, GooglePlay states its adding online betting apps to its online platform. It states it will add games like $SKLZ within 12 months. This is the 12 month, when the announcement comes any day now I expect to see @ least a $5 jump is the stock price. https://www.virtualsportsbetting.com/news/google-hires-head-of-us-betting/"
If this is the beginning of the short squeeze the better buckle up Dorothy.
"$30 will be 12B cap, like Sofi"
I am a bag holder with an average of 12.9$
"Lots of people talking about potential buyout, usually this means someone leaked the secret. they will have to confirm or deny very soon !"
Whos buying more today. I am averaging down from 50% loss!
"picked up 10,000 shares down here. Will see if it bounces. Do not see much downside from this price.Good luck"
Bought 10k shares at 12.10. It is a dip.
Short squeeze or buyout offer will sky this baby. The Redditt crowd will make lots of $ on this one. AMC or GME is way to high. This one is a bargain
"wedbush: parabolic upside 25 $ target the analyst also reiterated his belief that “parabolic upside,” could be in the cards, if the company could add to the platform a single high-profile game like Activision’s Candy Crush"
"Short float is 20% need to reduce shs outstanding. I will buy 1000 tomorrow. Institutional are buying be ready, if we get a catalyst."
"What happenedShares of mobile-gaming platform Skillz (NYSE:SKLZ) were trading modestly higher for most of Tuesday's session. But around 1:30 p.m. EDT, the stock suddenly spiked higher, seemingly out of nowhere. As of this writing, the stock is up 12%. After a little digging, it seems that some chatter on social news platform Reddit could be responsible for the jump.So whatA Reddit user posted that they had purchased $4.8 million in Skillz stock. Normally, I'd be reluctant to mention something like this. But there's no other news from Skillz today. Moreover, the time of the Reddit post roughly corresponds to the jump in Skillz stock. Therefore, this possibility can't be dismissed."
Just a reminder that all growth stocks are at 6 month lows & at low PPS . This is all market driven not Sklzs specific. Market Makers doing what they do. Hard to be an investor these days or easy to Bea bag holder. Things will change & hopefully we are at the bottom.Always bottom! Come back in a year or so & don't worry about daily..
Jack sent me
"Buy the DIP 200% upside LGF.A : 2.5B Cap, 4B Revenue REAL : 1B Cap, 500M revenue"
"The warrants expire on the 16th of august , and a warrant can be converted in to a share on or before that day for a price of $11.50 It is better for the investors if they do not convert them warrants in to shares so the whole point of this downtrend is to keep the share price at or below $11.50 so the people who own the warrants don’t end up converting them in to shares This will shoot up when the warrants expire regardless if you think this is a good company or not even from a Technical￼ view on the chart it is ready to shoot up next week"
"You people who have sold or thinking about selling should put your money in a ARK Fund because they own over 15% of the float and Morgan Stanley owns 18% of the float, Vanguard family of funds owns 10% of the float, pick anyone of the three mentioned and you'll quit losing money.Not to mention a whole host of other Funds and Institutions who collectively own over 71% of the float and are adding more to what they already own own thanks to people like you.Those who don't have time, patience or perseverance should only be allowed to invest in mutual funds for their own good and for the good of the investing community as a whole."
I have 5k shares at $12.68. This is one I may have to Rip Van Winkle for a while.
"In the report, SKLZ is on the expected growth, the industry is so huge, and there was a sell off, this is for a purpose of buying out. We have guts to buy SKLZ, why sell now."

"MGM could be interested in buying SKLZ, according to Seeking Alpha article with CTFN as the ultimate source. I somehow doubt SKLZ board would be willing to approve it - unless the offer would be exceptionally good. There is too much growth ahead for SKLZ."
What happened? Why is the company unprofitable? What is the reason for the drop in revenue?
Well done longs. You have made it to the biggest short squeeze since GME and AMC. Arise my son arise!

I don’t know about you guys but I’m holding a substantial amount of shares (for me) at around $22 and during days like this I just close my monitor and focus on a good book.The last thing to do would be selling even a single stock. If you don’t know the reason then just simply research all the reports you can get from the internet for free.
"It would either have to be an extremely attractive buyout or a hostile takeover, SKLZ isn't going to be acquired for less then $40."
"Coming Soon - Big news..... Acquisition with MGM, if this works this will move up to $ 35 within a couple of weeks,"

"The company just filed a prospectus to offer up to 4.4M shares from time to time. Not very dilutive, but there could be a negative reaction nonetheless."
You got a healthy mix of new investors piling in at these gorgeous prices and shorts about to lose their shorts- count me in- short and long term!!￼
"I like SKLZ and CRSR a lot. I am looking to buy at 10 and 25. I do not want to jump in too early on either, but I like the long term prospects of both if the govt stops trying to kill the country by spending every $ it can print."

This won't move till after the 16th Warrants. I keep picking up more at this bargain price
In discussions with MGM for buyout
Reverse split needed
easy 10 bagger returns here...
"The market is severely under estimating the exit game partnership... I think it is even more powerful than Aarki... it will bring developers in various genres.... also, the Indian market will be massive and the latest exclusivity with the most popular trivia game in history trivia crack.... man so many catalysts"
This stock tested patience of many holders. Those who didn't sell are the luckiest one's. Patience is the key.
This is your last chance to load up. You will no see under $11 going forward.
5000 shares at $10.60 !!! Hope it is the right call!
TEAM REDDIT AND RUMOURS. LET MAKE THIS BABY EXPLOODDEEE
Hold … this is just the beginning
"Buyout? No thanks, $100 stock 2-5year game plan! Holding…."
"24$ buyout of SKLZ makes sense, this is the last offering. GNOG was buyout at 18$ was also the last offering. Casino profit hits the record profits this year, this is the reason why."
Can't wait till 15 to break even.
thought I bought the dip at 14 dollars . opps
NFL season starting today 
this is what I was waiting for!
"The stock is heavily traded... investors, don’t make the mistake of reacting to trades ... don’t say you didn’t know"
Bull Flag forming!
Buyout rumors
So it looks like Reddit caught wind of this. I am thinking a huge short squeeze coming soon
"tomorrow, regardless of Nasdaq, SKLZ will break out at least 50 cents,,,but the real gap up will begin from next day,,,so,,,add up more at the closing of first day of inflection pointI"
