This was a 24$ stock in July!!!! I just got on the train for ride back up:)))
"On the surface, SKLZ is looking good in every aspects, financially, business model, cash position and growth rate; then, why the stock keeps going down; is there some kind of inherent weakness underneath? Can anyone explain? Thanks."
shorties going to start covering
"I wouldn’t say for sure, but couldn’t this rise come from November 1, expectations???"
My 5/22 $10 calls have just begun to print
Takeoff!
Who bought the dip???Giddy up!!!
Hopefully $8 has now really been the bottom. Lots of room to crawl back up.
Institutions have been loading with chunks but somehow the swing traders managed to sell so many stocks.
Looollll
"Skillz has been the victim of a concerted short attack, including the publication of undoubtedly paid-for negative reports. The company provides a unique platform and can attract independent game developers who share directly in the revenues generated. Its main problem has been a lack of really attractive games. This problem appears likely to be addressed with the new ""shooter"" games and the competition Skillz is holding in conjunction with the NFL to develop NFL games prior to the start of next season (about 14 finalists have been selected and Skillz is now working with the finalists to refine their games to determine the winners (probably 3 games, to be determined jointly with the NFL). The stock price appears to finally have bottomed and has been showing some strength recently. Of course there are no guarantees, but Skillz has made a savvy acquisition and alliance, and retains the possibility of being a big-time winner"
"I just don't have the dry powder to buy everything I like, am just hoping retail investors aren't selling at a lost on this markets selloff, small caps are taking a whipping, but the issue is if you sell and think its going to continue lower, you'll more than likely get caught in the outside looking in , buying back at a higher pps.."

"SKLZ was the most dangerous stock to short back in the days, nothing change with the company plans, growth and movement but pumpers raze the expectation from the company in the short time but actually now it’s the right time to start position when price all time low and company expect to deliver by year end"
"Why are people happy about a buyout? I would be so upset, this is a multibagger. I?d be #$%$ with a buyout. 5-10x in 5 years"
SKLZ: Strong open tomorrow? It may see $10+ soon with good news to be released at anytime.
It’s most certainly Open Season at Skillz for Big Buck ($) Hunters! Looking for the bottom/Unbelievable!
Squeeze to 15
MGM reports it is actively considering buying SKILLZ! Hah! This will fly Monday.
"Stop being obsessed with Cathie Wood that the media wants you to. Do you guys even know the tens of other institutions holding with even a bigger price?Nevertheless, I’m trying to understand who are playing with the price beside the panic selling."
"@SKLZ: how to acquire 1.5million new players! So easy, Math Works here!!!Hey guys- instead of hoping, guessing and predicting what SKLZ will behave next, here is my logic of investing: if you like CoKe, juts like what Buffet did: go and grab a coke every time you like to drink. Similarly, if you like GME, spend 30 bucks to buy their games; if you like AMC, spend 15 bucks and watch movie there; if you like TSLA, go and pay 60k and get a car. But, for SKLZ, it’s so easy to participate and grow their fundamentals: just a few clicks and spend couple bucks there!!! Download bigbuck Markman and play a few tournaments. That’s it. Then your stonks rewarding is astronomical! There are 400mm shares there, and ~150mm are owned by individuals. If we can just convert just 1% those individual stonk owners into players, btw so natural, we will have 1.5 million new players! !! Math works here, guys!!!"
Load up boyz before it’s to late
"Why the market up, this one down because it would go back to 8.01 Where came from."

"Some major highlights that are coming for and more. The growth here is massive. Acquired Aarki, a growing demand-side platform with more than 465 million monthly users, rich data engines, and proprietary machine-learning algorithms that deliver industry-leading ROI to its advertiser customers. Aarki broadens Skillz’s footprint by combining Skillz’s leading monetization with Aarki’s advanced User Acquisition capabilities.Formed a strategic alliance with Exit Games, a private German company whose advanced technology allows developers to create and host real-time, synchronous, multiplayer games. Skillz’s $50 million investment for a minority stake in Exit Games will give the Company permanent access to Exit’s technology to power its esports tournaments and platform exclusively, as well as dramatically accelerate the development of multiplayer synchronous content on the Skillz platform.Officially launched our multi-phase partnership with the NFL, kicking off a developer challenge to identify new NFL-branded mobile game(s). Hundreds of game proposals were submitted, and in collaboration with the NFL, Skillz reviewed the concepts and selected 14 semi-finalists, who have moved into the development phase of the competition.Launched Big Buck Hunter: Marksman, successfully advancing the mobile version of the legendary arcade game through the first phase of scale testing.

"Nobody has a crystal ball, but in my opinion people will look back in 2 to 3 years at this time when shares were being traded below IPO price despite being a lot more valuable today than it was as a SPAC and realize how did they not see the potential then…. It’s a new company in the very early stages, when it gets established, it will take off exponentially.I’m holding a huge chunk and won’t pay any attention to all the negativity and intense short interest with very bias negative propaganda out there for a minimum of 2 years."

"Best thing you can do as Skillz investors to turn your investment to Gold mines quicker, Android is 70% of the market users, Google play has gambling apps but not allowed Cash tournaments, contracts Google play and send them feedback that you move from IOS to android and now you don’t have this option so you conceder to move back to IOS"

"Don't sell to the shorties.. 650 million in cash No debt95% gross margins Aarki Deal (lowering customer acquisition cost)Exit games partnership (entry into FPS and open world gaming)Trivia Crack Deal (150 million users)Big Buck Hunter NFL DealInternational ExpansionAndrew Paradise also has a stock incentive of 16,000,000 shares if he 5x's the company. Ian Lee ( from AIRBNB) is the new CFO. So the stock is down, I get it but hold on to the long term mindset. Don't lose money when you know this is going to $50 in a year or two. Almost all long term thinking has short term pain and almost all short term thinking has long term pain and short term relief."
Buy when others are fearful.
reversal coming
"Here is why I think this is down so much and it would also explain a lot about how volatile the market has been since the pandemic. The reason is because there are many new ""investors"" in the game since the crash. The reason say ""investors"" sarcastically is because they are not really that. investors invest long term and not short. All of these newbies have no plan and as a result, are being abused and taken advantage of by others shorting. Considering the market they are in, the deals that they have/working on, the amount of cash on hand, and finally experienced management, this stock is now under valued in my eyes. You can agree or disagree but I truly believe that the newbies are shooting themselves in the foot. Time will either prove me right or wrong."

It just needs ignition now to go past $12 at least. Hope for the best. Good night
$9.12 and still climbing after hours
"9.50 reverses the downward movement. 14.00 is the next buy signal if it does not reverse back down first. 19 is upward resistance point. If it can get back up into that area, It should get back into the mid 20's IMO. It still has no support line. My last buy point was 13 on the way down. I probably should pick up some more."
Reddit army is back 
two digit before friday?
If you are scared...you shouldn't be in the market. I know people who got scared in March of 2020 and sold only to watch the market and their stocks go up 10X. SLKZ has great fundementals....weather the storm. We will doubor triple from here.
Something cooking today...once we blow past $9 we gone
"Some posts below do not contain the right information about the recent SEC Filing. today announced a new multi-year performance stock unit grant (the “2021 Grant”) for Skillz Founder and CEO Andrew Paradise, based on his achievement of milestones related to the future market capitalization of Skillz. The 2021 Grant is structured to significantly enhance the Company’s market capitalization, and does not provide Mr. Paradise with any guaranteed or time-based compensation. Further, as described below, regardless of the Company’s revenue growth and performance, no portion of the 2021 Grant will vest unless, within the performance period, the market capitalization of the Company at least doubles from the Market Capitalization Baseline of approximately $4.7 billion.Paradise only gets the 16 Mio. shares if the Market cap in 2028 will be 5x higher than now."

"Option traders, they are going to pin it to $9."
"I am very bearish on SKLZ alone the way because of its business model and popularity, but I am open to reverse my stands if its outlook improve or stock price bottom out."
"SKLZ is now 18% of my total investments. At this price its a gift. If for any reason it drops, I will not hesitate to purchase more."
"I got time, I'm holding,"
"I’m long and will stay long, but what bothers me is Shorts don’t hang around for eights & quarters. I worked in an institution brokerage house and shorts wouldn’t risk any upside loss - especially when the stock is this low ( down 80% from the high) if they didn’t know something. For me, it just doesn’t smell right - there’s got to be another reason why it gets hammered everyday. Just my opinion."
Volume for the day will be 30 plus million i hope. And closing above $9.75
Cathie woods purchases 1 million shares of SKLZ I will assume that there was a detailed conversation with SKLZ ceo about the future and plans of the company ! I like it !! I like it a lot !!Good luck to all the longs and fk the shorts !!

"It doesn’t make sense to sell before a few earning calls and the release of the NFL game. Big buck hunter and trivia crack can potentially add so much to the revenue. I personally believe the NFL game alone could double revenues next year. If that happens, Wall Street money will pour into this stock like it’s nothing. i know it’s easy to panic sell but take a deep breath and understand that if you bought Amazon in 2008, you’d be down 50% in a year but up 30x if you held. SKILLz is no Amazon but I hope you get what I’m saying"
Is Cathie Wood still scarfing up the SKLZ shares?
NFL just tweeted Skillz to their 28M followers
"At the Sept quarter, visit rate up 50%, engagement expenses double & revenue flat sequentially.Those will impact the coming E/R. So, make your own judgement."
Go sklz go!!
"This is a very popular stock with retailer investors, and with so many layers of buyers from $9-17, this stock will trade at narrow range for the months to come."
Distribution is nearly completed; old trend will resume.
"Sold at 9.26 yesterday, buy back at 7.97."
I added to my sklz portfolio. This is a great buy right now.
If you are short cover.$10 first stop.Giddy up!!!!
"sklz is actually an inflationary hedge. Profit margin of 95% as they take a 14% cut from every game played. So prices of commodities and supply chain issues won’t affect their profit margin at all, while most other companies will suffer. Multibagger in the making "
do we even close the year above 11 is the question?lots of promise for sure.
RKT SKLZ CHPT the most undervalued stocks in whole market.
OMG what a gem of stock it is. Glad i added at $9.47
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"

"Blocks buying, so fore sure it was the bottom, now reversal with short squeeze"
Red day tomorrow
Boom 
"I dont believe it, its green on red market day, what's going on ? We reached the bottom time to add?"
"$SKLZ A huge factor in the likelihood of a partnership between Skillz and Peloton is that the Peloton needs a partner from gaming industry. It makes no sense for them to create their own games department. Besides, you won't surprise anyone with simple games on workout machines anymore, they have been for years on different manufacturers machines. And since Peloton positions itself primarily as an innovative producer of workout machines, they need something new, something that will be unique and first ever done. I just don't see any other way beside partnering with Skillz if they want to surprice anyone with their games. The demand for Peloton devices is going to be crazy. People will want to compete and make money from the comfort of their homes.Imagine challenging best athletes worldwide from your homeThis will be a real breakthrough and something that have never been done before."

"Skillz is a buy for aggressive growth investors, Skillz grew revenue during the second quarter up 52% over the prior year, Also Skillz second quarter Average Revenue Per User (""ARPU"") was up 62% YoYThere are many long-term reasons to invest in Skillz, which include:The Arki acquisition Skillz' investments in data scienceThe partnership with Exit Increasing brand awarenessNew contentInternational expansionThe company prefers to grow as fast as possible in order to penetrate what the company often cites as a massive $2.8 billion mobile esports gamer marketLast but not least the partnership with Exit Games over the longer term should not only bring on Exit Games' approximately 500,000 developers but it opens up a way for Skillz to build games in entirely new popular genres, such as Battle Royale and First-Person Shooter Games."
