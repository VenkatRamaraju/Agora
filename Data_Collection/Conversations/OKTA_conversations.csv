"Okta upgraded to Strong Buy from Outperform with a price target of $310 (from $300) at Raymond JamesRaymond James analyst Adam Tindle upgraded Okta to Strong Buy from Outperform with a price target of $310, up from $300. The firm's work via proprietary surveys at recent industry events, and strategic discussions with senior channel executives suggest an acceleration of core organic trends, an inflection in the adjacent CIAM market, and a re-rating in valuation on core acceleration alongside 2H21 beta products in PAM and IGA, Tindle tells investors in a research note."
Another great earnings results in tanking. No point in hold thru earning anywhere
"Okta upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $315 (from $275) at Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley analyst Hamza Fodderwala upgraded Okta to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $315, up from $275, as the analyst assumed lead coverage of the stock. An improving demand environment and more buy-in with developers should drive stronger growth and upside in estimates, contends Fodderwala, who notes enterprises are shifting a greater portion of security budgets towards Identity and Access Management, or IAM, where Okta is the ""market leader."" With businesses refocusing on larger, strategic initiatives to modernize their IAM infrastructure, Fodderwala believes growth is now stabilizing and should prove more durable than the consensus view as demand improves, the analyst added."
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
"This is normal action for OKTA after earnings, look back at the chart the last few years each quarter. Initial down, then nice recovery. Their business is great and they are in a great industry, that is undeniable. The stock is not cheap but it will work it's way up after a week or so of short term trade type selling. I have owned it since 24, I have seen this movie before"
"OKTA beat on revenues and EPS for the current quarter, Q3, and for FY22. Trifecta time. What's not to like?"
Any idea why the big drop today ? Down 3.5% as I type.

"Wonder why there is so little retail interest in this stock. It has 60%+ revenue growth for 5 straight years (and will continue doing so on new integrations at least), cybersecurity related and almost like a monopolist in its own little field. I am currently enjoying this upward movement with my modest position here."
"Prefer NTNX at this point. Both are leaders in their core market, but NTNX is much cheaper valued, trading at about 5x EV/Sales (forward) only!"
