"Revenue forecasts beat estimates all around but the market isn't just looking for growth (which is amazing), they are also looking for profitability. Fact of the matter is that if this company keeps growing like this, they will be profitable eventually. They simply need to spend now to build infrastructure to support all the growth (see Amazon circa 2006)."
Will recover and go up then go back to 246 like the immediate reaction in after hours just like CrowdPUKE  did today down 12 last night opened up down 8 rose to up 5 closed down 11+
Been buying all the OKTA dips. Long term once rates peak out in a few months this stock goes to 300 and beyond. Thanks to Cramer for bringing this stock to my attention a few months ago.
"My organization, 1500+ employees, just implemented Service Now which leverages Okta for authorization. Their product is one of the best of class in utilizing SSO for authorization integration. Excellent company with few competitors and loads of potential growth. GLTA"
Buy the dip - gonna turn green by 2:00PM tomorrow...
"Okta, the identity and access management (IAM) company, experienced exceptional growth in 2020, and investors responded by driving the company's stock price up 120% last year. But the company's share price dropped recently after Okta reported its fourth-quarter 2021 results. Investors pushed the stock down about 10% earlier this week, but the sell-off was a bit of an overreaction. The company reported a year-over-year revenue increase of 40% in the quarter to $234.7 million. That's still very impressive growth and there's likely more where that came from. Okta's management said that full-year fiscal 2022 revenue will jump 30% at the high end of guidance.Investors have also been nervous that Okta just spent $6.5 billion to purchase the cloud identity start-up Auth0. But the acquisition will help Okta expand its identity management business to new platforms and services that it currently doesn't reach. Sure, it's a large sum of money to spend, but it should help the company tap further into the IAM market, which is worth $55 billion. If investors step back a moment and stop looking at the short-term market volatility, they'll see that Okta had a fantastic year in fiscal 2021 and is still poised for more growth in the upcoming year. On top of that, the company's latest acquisition should boost Okta's position in the fast-growing IAM market and help the company stay ahead of its competition. That's why, for long-term investors, Okta's recent share price drop looks like a great opportunity to pick up some shares."
"Piper Jaffray reiterated BUY rating, increased the price target to $89. 12 analysts have buy rating and raised the PT. None has sell. This will take off soon."
What can I say Full of Bull? ~ Your handle is perfect.
"My company recently started using okta, my husband’s and daughter’s company also uses it. So I figured okta might have been gaining quite some customers, hopefully it’d have positive impact on their earnings this time"
Why is this down? Earnings good right?
"If tech is green tomorrow, hopefully it will go up more then competitors since it’s lagging today"
Man i wish i had more than 200 shares of this.
"Cathie Wood-led Ark Investment Management bought 123,385 shares, estimated to be worth about $27.44 million, in Okta Inc (NASDAQ:OKTA) on Thursday. Load it up. Revenue growth was great. Company is growing and growing companies have expenses that fuel growth. Will be back to 240’s in no time."

Okta is up 4.91% to 247.25
"Okta is and will become the inevitable authenticator of the World Wide Web. It could potentially become the entry to a machine connected to a specific network as well. Okta technology does appear to be on the verge of a winner take all new long-term target price of $1k. Once it approaches or reaches this share price it continues potential to aquaire will be what then draws further evaluation. As for now $1 does look achievable without any resistance over a period of time because their technology does present the most secure of any and all offers now and for the future other than biometrics, which to can be included for the most secure combination to exist in the world if it ever were to be combined."
"IMHO, this is a ticking time bomb and will explode to $300 in no time...I have owned this for 2 years now waiting for it to be acquired. I bought in after implementing a full OKTA SSO suite in a large enterprise...no one does it better than $OKTA!"
"bought more at 50 and change, thank you, be selling at 65 soon"
"okta was down 17 earlier, now down 2.35."
"It's like taking candy from a baby competing with ""investors"" who have only a cursory understanding of financial statement analysis, who instead rely on charts or a basic narrative understanding derived from casual reading of a few sell-side reports.

"Wow, this turd is now trading at 45x SALES, yes SALES/Revenue and NOT a dime of profits yet. A massive 200+ million in increasing losses at year end reported in Jan 2020. Wonder why Warren Buffet is not buying in yet ;-)Valued at jeez $24 BILLION with a nothing tech which allows someone to LOGIN (to multiple websites / SAAS providers using a single set of credentials using an open standard Federation model - SAML). With MS Azure IAM and similar offerings from AWS and GCP, it just does not make sense as it does the very same thing and a lot easier especially with MS Azure AD.If a company is already moving its Identity stores (AD for ex) to the cloud with Azure, AWS or GCP, why risk duplicating the same to 3rd Party like Okta and pay on top of that, when the same SSO functionality be achieved for free and risk free by their cloud provider.I bet this company will disappear in the near future. It was a great tech 3-4 yrs back and at $20 a share. Not anymore.And for the non-believers, do you own research. Do not just go by the upward momentum.I am neither long or short. But I know the IAM tech very well and am a true value buyer and this INSANE valuation for a ""nothing tech"" just does not make sense. Even if it were the only player in the world with some proprietary game changing tech, the valuation still would NOT make sense.Peace out."
260 easy in the short term. Lower guidance and cfo bailing is a buying opp period. I reloaded at 213. Longer term well over 300
that was a great earnings report. no matter what the stock does I'm holding
"This is normal action for OKTA after earnings, look back at the chart the last few years each quarter. Initial down, then nice recovery. Their business is great and they are in a great industry, that is undeniable. The stock is not cheap but it will work it's way up after a week or so of short term trade type selling. I have owned it since 24, I have seen this movie before"
"Why has OKTA been on free fall for the last two weeks? No major news in Yahoo Finance, MarketWatch or Benzinga. The only thing I could find was an article dated from yesterday saying ""Okta shares are trading lower after Piper Sandler downgraded the stock from Overweight to Neutral."" But that was yesterday. What explains the behavior for the last two weeks?"
Crushed earnings. Non GAAP earnings of .08 vs estimates of -.02 loss.
"OKTA is representative of the new innovative, disrupting companies which grow as quickly as possible to dominate the market, and later on they can focus on profit!"
They will cut a deal on debt service and we go up 600 points
Another great earnings results in tanking. No point in hold thru earning anywhere
didn't the cfo bail on this company during the qtr? skeletons come out tonight?
What happened? Looked away and down 9. Was there some news I missed. Staying long but wondered.
Nice shakedown. Almost 5% of the float short. Could be fun tomorrow.
More room to grow !!
this company missed numbers last qtr. cfo left? made a big acquisition. insiders selling like crazy. some accounting issues/changes to be reflected this qtr? big competitor just got $500 m private placement. hmmmmmm?
ultra huge block ($10M) on the bid at 253.50
"Breaking: Okta price target raised to $210 from $140 at DA DavidsonDA Davidson analyst Andrew Nowinski raised the firm's price target on Okta to $210 from $140 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares.

The analyst raised the price target to reflect increased confidence that cyber security spending will increase subsequent to the attack."
OKTA beat on every operating metric including a huge surprise in positive operating cash flow. A very large +83% increase in billings. Gosh I hope the chart watchers and momo guys sell this off - what a gift! LOAD THE BOAT!!!
This stock is $100 by December 2018

$ROKU $OKTA $AYX all strong buys. Look for a 5% plus gain in the next month!
I feel earnings were very good and the future looks bright. I feel this is a good buying opportunity.
Just some profit taking before earnings or weak hands selling. Chart looks great and staying long for the earnings .
This will be trading in 70’s tomorrow
Big fan of okta. Have done great with it on the past. Wondering if anyone could share any other interesting names ? Many thanks.
Nice spike up at 10:20AM. Smart money flowing in. I feel the future looks great and demand is huge.
What do you think about ER of OKTA tomorrow guys? Positive or negative?
"Headline on the wire after hours: ""OKTA announces strong results."" How strong can they be? The stock is already down $20!"
Who had this stock since 2017?
Earnings on June 6 should send the stock higher especially with the new guidance with joint projects with VMware and Facebook.

OKTA 5 year price target is $985! Let's ride this train. In at $136
How can they continue to lose so much money? It is like they are eating lobster on china and using new plates every meal.
whats up with the constant decline in price?
Investing in Bitcoin is the wisest thing to do now especially with the current rise.
"Berenberg raises Okta price target from $138 to $210 and maintains a Buy rating.Berengberg sees Okta as protected by its subscription-based model, well-positioned product portfolio, and successful acquisition of large enterprise customers. expects Okta's revenue to grow more than 30% in FY21.https://seekingalpha.com/news/3583792-okta-price-target-lifted-on-pandemic-resilience?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&mail_subject=okta-okta-price-target-lifted-on-pandemic-resilience&utm_campaign=rta-stock-news&utm_content=link-3"
OKTA needs Benjo to post daily about how it's going to fall to 20 bucks in a few months. It only seems to make it increase in value.
"Okta upgraded to Strong Buy from Outperform with a price target of $310 (from $300) at Raymond JamesRaymond James analyst Adam Tindle upgraded Okta to Strong Buy from Outperform with a price target of $310, up from $300. The firm's work via proprietary surveys at recent industry events, and strategic discussions with senior channel executives suggest an acceleration of core organic trends, an inflection in the adjacent CIAM market, and a re-rating in valuation on core acceleration alongside 2H21 beta products in PAM and IGA, Tindle tells investors in a research note."
"This is solid company with great growth potential. Their guidance is to play it safe, but I am confident they will exceed expectations like they just showed they can. Their customer base is very widespread and it will only get better as their product offering is very compelling."
lol the ah dip followed by earnings call rebound. should see 190s tomorrow
Lots of overreactions here. It down to levels not since since 2 whole weeks ago. Listen to conference call and tell me one thing that was negative? Would love someone to tell me
"I keep waiting for a pull back to buy more, but it never happens lol :)"
very impressive action for a very expensive stock. I have owned this since mid 20's
Any idea why the big drop today ? Down 3.5% as I type.
The direction of the OKTA ship has been righted in these choppy waters. Up we go again...
OKTA is on sale right now...buy your shares to today at discount. Ignore the noise and stay stong
So many cloud ....software .... app....tech.... Stocks that make no profit. Feels like 1999 again. Scary
Get out while you can from OKTA bc Software giant MSFT is building better company.
"Wonder why there is so little retail interest in this stock. It has 60%+ revenue growth for 5 straight years (and will continue doing so on new integrations at least), cybersecurity related and almost like a monopolist in its own little field. I am currently enjoying this upward movement with my modest position here."
"Okta call: ""As i said, the demand environment for our products has been very very robust. There have more deals, there have bigger deals."""
OKTA is a screaming acquisition target. It's the 800 lb gorilla in the space. My guess is MSFT. That tie up would be insane.

Great earnings report. Record sales and revenue. Let’s see how the stock reacts since they already pre-announced and OKTA ran. There may be some profit taking.
It will go up soon I think
An earning surprise should take $OKTA upwards just like $CRM did. I can easily see $300 with the recent momentum.
what is going on after hours?
"What seemed to #$%$ investors was the company's guidance for the rest of the year. While its top-line forecast was strong, getting a boost from the Auth0 acquisition, it expects wider losses ahead. For the current quarter, it forecasts an adjusted loss per share in the range of $0.35 to $0.36, which compared poorly to the analysts' consensus expectation for a loss of $0.11 per share. For the full year, Okta expects an adjusted per-share loss in the range of $1.13 to $1.16; analysts had been estimating a per-share loss of $0.44. These wider expected losses at least partly reflect the expenses involved in the integration of Auth0, but it's worth noting that Okta management's guidance has historically been conservative.Additionally, Okta shared long-term revenue guidance for the first time, calling for $4 billion in annual revenue by fiscal 2026 -- which assumes compound annual growth of at least 35% -- and a free cash flow margin of 20%.Given that guidance, the market's concerns about Okta's near-term losses seem overblown."
Just said they have not seen any change in the product demand from coronavirus. That they are seeing extremely strong demand reflected in their raised guidance.
Great buy here. Upgraded today and given a $280 price target. Future looks great for the company. They have entered a couple of new markets that has increased their TAM significantly.
Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) reported quarterly losses of $(0.09) per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $(0.16) by 43.75 percent. This is a 82 percent increase over losses of $(0.50) per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $83.6 million which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $78.84 million by 6.04 percent. This is a 57.72 percent increase over sales of $53.007 million the same period last year.
"It is true, after crashing over 56% from peak, Zoom is not as overvalued as something else such as bitcoin, $GME, $AMC, $SNOW, $SHOP, $TEAM, $SNAP, $DDOG, $ASAN, $CRWD, $ZS, $MDB, $OKTA, etc. However, for realistic investing purpose, it is foolish to compare Zoom to those things. When valuation for these extremely speculative bets is imploded, these bets could easily tank 90% or more, and even if Zoom tanks 70%, it is still a foolish bet nonetheless.Going forward, Zoom is only projected by stock analysts to grow annual revenue by 17.6% next year, and zero growth on annual EPS. If the future reality is slow growth or worse, the P/E ratio could easily reset to 15 or lower, and trigger a crash of over 80%.Any opposing opinions out there think for sure Zoom would continue peak pandemic type of hyper growth for many many many years to come, and further think that the stock analysts are all wrong ??? Please provide your thesis in details."
I have absolutely no idea why this stock is down after posting a surprise profit and great numbers.
"From MarketWatch: Don’t be surprised if cloud companies continue to report strong earnings. The goal for investors is to tune out the noise, as cloud-revenue growth is likely to defy the odds."
Street looking for a loss this quarter be careful out there
Why the jump? Any news?
"Did anybody notice % of institutions holding, has been at 150% for a while now and today dropped to 55% held thoughts on this ?"
They are still bleeding off the original 40K block on the bid at 253.50 ~ have bought 7K with 37K to go. Very clever by the market makers.
Bought back into OKTA long for a swing earnings play at 253.71
The numbers for the quarter look good to me.... not sure why the stock is tanking AM? Anyone here have insights on this?
Analyst Needham lifts price target to $50

"So I've been in good stocks before like GOOG, AMZN but sold them too early (made a lot of money though). But SHOP was the first stock I decided to hold and am doing well. The only thing is although I started buying at 38 and continued buying up to 103, I only accumulated about 1k shares (recently sold a few to buy OKTA). BUT after reading about OKTA, I decided it was time to buy what ever I could at 38. I've accumulated 3000 shares. Hoping to pick up at least 1000 more in the next week or so. Compared to AMZN and PCLN and GOOG - I only had 100-250 shares of those stocks and sold after 150 points up. Hoping SHOP hits 200 this year and OKTA over 100! Possible?"
"OKTA beat on revenues and EPS for the current quarter, Q3, and for FY22. Trifecta time. What's not to like?"
"Someone tells me their Auth0 integration is being delayed…if that’s true, it’s an impact on the stock"
$PING =$SAIL=$FORGthese 3 compete with each other! There will definitely be some consolidation n this area to compete with $OKTA!
New here. Can someone please explain how this goes from $61 down to $54?Why ?
"Needham & Company analyst Alex Henderson raised the price target on Okta, Inc (NASDAQ: OKTA) to $105.00 (from $96.00) while maintaining a Buy rating.The analyst commented, ""At its annual user conference, Okta punctuated a convincing argument why it is the clear leader in Identity Access by announcing two important new products and two major new features on its platform. The expansion of the capabilities and products cemented our belief Okta has already passed the break-away point, where its customer base, platform and Network Effects are sealing its dominant position in Identity, a critical central part of Security. We think OKTA is accelerating away from its smaller sub-scale competitors. The attendance at the conference demonstrates this point. We come away with increased conviction of Identity as a foundational centerpiece of an in depth security framework and see Okta as the clear leader. Accordingly, we are reiterating our Buy on Okta and increasing our PT to $105 from $96."""
Hmm. What’s going on here with the drop?
We use this product at our enterprise and its amazing. Imagine what it will become with the new Acquisition.
"We can all ignore what Benjo keeps posting. To Noah's post below, here is what the company does and why i think this is a good bet:1) Single sign on. Imagine password and account provisioning mess for an IT department in an enterprise company. 1000s of employees/apps, which employees get which app and how they access it. Okta does all that with integration out of box with 4000+ apps. Custom apps can be integrated easily with a web UI.2) Multifactor authentication. Most security breaches are due to credential theft. MFA adds a second layer of security. So if a threat is perceived user can be prompted to enter a code from their phone/sms or a push notification on mobile. This gives more trust. Okta helps IT by creating rules around threats which is super critical. See duo.3) Legacy authentication directories on cloud. (LDAP/active directory) which thousands of organizations use currently can be integrated with cloud applications. Imagine logging in to 1000s of apps with your corporate directory password. It helps enterprises to keep their legacy infrastructure and move what they want to the cloud.4) Authenticate through third party apps. Login to your okta account with your third party credentials.(Essential for enterprises with a different source of truth).5) customer portals identity management. Authenticate through Okta for your customers. It is a growing business and Okta has existing big customers in space. Say you were a pizza vendor and did not want to worry about authentication. Okta will manage it for you, provide mfa as well if needed. With added threat protection.Their are other use cases, to go into. Identity is at core of everything you do online. Get an Uber, authenticate, order food, authenticate, connect iot devices, authenticate. Someone like benjo needs to understand that most successful cloud companies were in a similar position as okta at this stage of their journey."

"3 upgrades so far - Oppenheimer, Deutsche Bank and ZACKS. This will be back in 80's next week"
why the sell off?
"They beat top and bottom line for the current quarter. Their Q1 forecast also neats on revenue but comes out short on eps ( i don’t much pay attention to EPS) As long as the revenue is going at a healthy pace, which it is, is more important. It is a growing company and is maintaining a healthy growth rate. It is also in acquisition mode so OPeX increase to be expected. Overall they are executing their plan. I would stay long. Second half of the year it will be tradings at $100"

What is going on after hour
This stock gave up everything. When will the stock market price stocks based on earnings and not on revenue? Even if the stock makes 5 dollars a share some day the P/E is already almost 48. I am not singling out this stock. Most of the non-large cap tech stocks are exploding exponentially. congrats to all the speculative longs. People like me cannot make money in this market due to lack of trust.
"The day before TTD reported, it was downgraded by Stifel, and next day earnings were fantastic. These anaylst can't predict the market reaction. They will probably report fantastic Revenue, with less EPS due to increased expenses for supporting future growth. Sound like Amazon use to?"
"Even though the stock is down from 60ish, if I would have told you in Feb this stock would be 51, what would you have said? Fundamentals and outside perception of this company is great. This is normal by my standards ( reasonable pull back) and this is still a small stock that can be moved easily by institutional trading volume"

I think this is run out of steam and heading back south glad I sold all shares at 246.5.
"Okta price target raised to $230 from $173 at Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs analyst Heather Bellini raised the firm's price target on Okta to $230 from $173 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst increased price targets across her Software and Select Internet coverage universe to reflect higher peer multiples, lower interest rates, and reduced equity risk premiums. Following a 30% contraction in the average enterprise value to sales multiples from the February peak, valuations across software have expanded 75% from mid-March troughs, surpassing July 2019 highs, Bellini tells investors in a research note."
BE AFRAID LONGS BE Very Afraid!!! Bail in the after hours or face a massive wipe out tomorrow!!!
Quite the over-reaction last night... this company is rock solid
"The entire market is rigged, so just stay with your own research and conviction."
"Either you believe in this company and you're in it for 3-5 years or longer, or just get out of the stock market."
I’m highly considering buying shares in this stock. My company is moving towards OKTA Verify for remote connectivity/work from home as its easy to use. Fast growing company that’s disrupting industries. I like that.
Look  at Fartinet & CrowdPUKE  today for the future of OTKA after earnings
Okta got political and banned Parler from using its services. Is it really smart to split your customer base in such an overcrowded software space? These crowded spaces have a way of thinning out.
"Next Thu makes me nervous... on one hand there is enough reason to believe this GREAT company beating estimates while on the other hand, the impacts that its customers received from the pandemic may also weigh on its top line growth. Hope the WFH tailwind will outwin the impact!!"
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
I felt earnings were very good and future looks great! Their area is in great demand and will continue to grow a lot in the future. I feel the stock will continue to keep rising. I feel this is a great buy on the pullback today.
"OKTA is a great company and I missed it at $150, so I’m ticked, but PING looks like a viable alternative buy (compare the Price to Sales ratio for both). I may be wrong, but OKTA getting a bit ahead of itself. Earnings better smash."
"59% beat!! If this closes red tomorrow, i will stop trading"
Stocks markets are going to close on the 5th for day of mourning. The same day OKTA reports earnings. Does anyone know if OKTA will then be moving the date of their earnings announcement?
I just bought 2000 shares at $37.75...wow what a risk is that!!! It will recover up to $40 tomorrow. Let's make a wish!!!
"we will be fine, in 2 years OKTA will reach $400."
"Guys, genuine question. I currently have lots of Okta shares. I have done my research and feel the stock will increase after earnings. I was wondering if anyone else has honest and sincere inputs on this matter. Appreciate your time!"
thx to person who sold me his or her shares at 178. this will be new Netflix.
Be very careful with OKTA going into earnings. It jumped last week and has been starting to drop since then. OKTA tanked after its last earnings report - despite good results. Massive sell on the news may occur again this time around.
"Okta upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $315 (from $275) at Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley analyst Hamza Fodderwala upgraded Okta to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $315, up from $275, as the analyst assumed lead coverage of the stock. An improving demand environment and more buy-in with developers should drive stronger growth and upside in estimates, contends Fodderwala, who notes enterprises are shifting a greater portion of security budgets towards Identity and Access Management, or IAM, where Okta is the ""market leader."" With businesses refocusing on larger, strategic initiatives to modernize their IAM infrastructure, Fodderwala believes growth is now stabilizing and should prove more durable than the consensus view as demand improves, the analyst added."
