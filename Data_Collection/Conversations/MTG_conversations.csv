"At 0.84x year-end 2020 Book Value, I suggest that longs email investor relations and suggest that the best thing that they could do-- is to be in the market buying their own stock today-- in a big way. A 16% earnings yield and a P/E just above 6. I have no idea what the market is thinking here."
Good monthly numbers!
Wow. Mtg having a nice move. Hit new yearly high. Surprise Eps coming this quarter? I suspect technical charts like this move and would indicate a higher price is coming.Finally has recovered all of precovid losses.

Would be nice if the common would see a nice quarterly dividend. That may increase the share price and reward those who have been supporting.
Sell 100 shares in pre-market an the price drops $1.02 lol￼
If best management can do is 1.1 times book value; then I say it time to sell to an entity that is more focused on shareholders. They issue tons of stock options and stock awards on top of extremely inflated compensation and the stockholders get 1.1 times book and 7 PE? Thought maybe new CEO would be a little more proactive to increase stock price; but appears based on his actions since earnings that he is just another one hoping to get rich on the gravy train.
"Stock price on 1/2/2018 was $14.33. At 12/31/2018 price was $10.80 for over a 32% drop in stock price. The BOD awarded the CEO 350,000 shares of stock for that performance and gave the entire management team hundreds of thousands of shares. They gifted the previous CEO 195,000 shares in November. Makes one wonder what their performance goals are cause it sure has nothing to do with providing value to stockholders."
I don't understand why MTG is down like this. I've held this stock for several years now. Question and please honest answers..... Should I keep holding or sell?
"The CFPB issued an ANPR yesterday regarding the ""QM Patch""which is set to expire in Jan. 2021. The industry knows this. The QM Patch allows DTI greater than 43% and if it expires, the business will go to the FHA instead of the PMI's. However, it is more likely that the rule/provision gets renewed and at a position more FAVORABLE for the PMI's. The Feds want more private capital not less. Big over reaction to news that could be viewed as a positive for the PMI industry."
Pre-market trading looking promising
Algorithms identifies that $MTG stock has recently hit a double top pattern. This means it could be a short-term trade idea for a stock to short-sell
MTG IS BREAKING OUT OF BULL FLAG PATTERN....ESTIMATED PRICE $15.89.
"""Compared to others, MGIC Investment Corporation is in a different league with regards to profitability, having net margins of 48.6%. To put some perspective around this, the industry’s average net margin is 5.47%. MTG’s ROE is 16.4%, which is also considerably better than the industry’s ROE of 10%. "" (from marketbeat)"
earnings are stellar as expected... book value added another $0.64 per quarter to $10.72EPS $0.42 will get MTG over $15...easy :-)
"MTG will no question report a strong quarter tomorrow morning. Stock should rally strong, just like BAC today."
"I've looked back at the entire history of MGIC as a public company (but excluding the crisis years 2008-2012, when MTG might have gone bust). The LOWEST price-to-book ratio --at the calendar year high-- was 1.40x year-end book value. In other words, looking at the high and low stock price during a calendar year, vs. that same year-end book value. The low was in 2006, and match in 2016-- at 1.40x BV. 2019's year-end book value should approximate $12.25. 1.40x 12.25 BV gets you to a price of $17.15. The average high over the last 4 years (2015-2018) is 1.66x BV on the high end and 1.02 on the low end. 1.66x 12.25 is $>$20. And we've already had the low for th year price-wise at 10.20, which is 0.83x year-end BV. MTG should be trading at $17-20, not $13 and change."
