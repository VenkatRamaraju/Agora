"The CFPB issued an ANPR yesterday regarding the ""QM Patch""which is set to expire in Jan. 2021. The industry knows this. The QM Patch allows DTI greater than 43% and if it expires, the business will go to the FHA instead of the PMI's. However, it is more likely that the rule/provision gets renewed and at a position more FAVORABLE for the PMI's. The Feds want more private capital not less. Big over reaction to news that could be viewed as a positive for the PMI industry."
"I've looked back at the entire history of MGIC as a public company (but excluding the crisis years 2008-2012, when MTG might have gone bust). The LOWEST price-to-book ratio --at the calendar year high-- was 1.40x year-end book value. In other words, looking at the high and low stock price during a calendar year, vs. that same year-end book value. The low was in 2006, and match in 2016-- at 1.40x BV. 2019's year-end book value should approximate $12.25. 1.40x 12.25 BV gets you to a price of $17.15. The average high over the last 4 years (2015-2018) is 1.66x BV on the high end and 1.02 on the low end. 1.66x 12.25 is $>$20. And we've already had the low for th year price-wise at 10.20, which is 0.83x year-end BV. MTG should be trading at $17-20, not $13 and change."
"Great quarter, now with those numbers in mind we know how much less money they will make because of their price cuts. Sad!"
"The board is silent, except for the daily Yahoo Finance notifications stating that MGIG is pulling a China Syndrome. But everybody’s out, right?"
"So MTG is trading at 92% of my estimate of year-end Book Value ($14.25). The 5-year average (using calendar year price high/low divided by book value) is 1.57x - 0.98. The lowest it ever traded at in the last 5 years was 73% of BV (in 2016, when MTG hit $5.44 and year-end 2016 BV was $7.48). That is a crisis type multiple. With stocks near 5-year highs, there is no reason why MTG should be trading below BV. The 5-year high was 1.84x BV, in 2017 when MTG traded at $15.64 and year-end 2017 BV was $8.51. 1.84x my estimate of year-end 2020 BV of $14.25 is $26/share, or a double from these levels! Realistically, downside is $11-- but upside is $26. My only question is what will be the catalyst to pop the stock higher? Buffett should be buying MTG but it's simply too small for him. Maybe he offers to take the company private."

"Market is NUTS. MTG has nothing but rising estimates after it has beaten estimates for how many quarters in a row now? Stock is close to book value. MTG should be in the high teens. New head of FHA was prior a board member at RDN. New FHFA head will like shut down the IMAGIN programs that Fannie has started. Yield curve is not suggesting recession at all right now. Just 2bp inversion from 2-to-5 year, and that spread has never been a reliable indicator. Fed funds-2yr spread is one-- and that is still very positive. Also positive is another that has been more reliable-- the 2-to-10yr spread. That spread is still very positive. Meanwhile according to the ISM, 17 of 18 industries are in positive growth mode right now-- meaning the economy is doing really well. The PMI for November is 59.3!! ""Demand remains strong with New Orders Index rebounding to above 60, the Customers Inventory Index declining and remaining low."" I guess investors just don't care."

Sinks is a complete failure yet they keep throwing more money at him????"
Makes absolutely no sense at all
"Conference call October 14, 2018 highlights: 1) The main driver of our future revenues insurance in force grew nearly 8% over the last 12 months ending the quarter at nearly $206 billion.2) our new business writings are up about 6% to over $38 billion3) strong demand for housing as consumers especially those below the age of 454) the number of policies that were delinquent, as of the end of the third quarter has fallen to its lowest level since 1997.5) there are only six private mortgage insurers6) the third quarter, we earned $181.9 million of net income or $0.49 per diluted share compared to $120 million or $0.32 per diluted share in the same period last year.7) The effective average premium yield for the third quarter of 2018 was 49.3 basis points, which was approximately flat to last quarter.8) our consolidated cash and investments totaled $5.2 billion9) At the end of the third quarter, MGIC's statutory capital is $2.5 billion in excess of the state requirement.10) Currently, we have $100 million remaining under share repurchase program that does not expire until 2019 ( notice: i believe this tool was used when stock fell under book value)11) expect that our insurance in force will continue to grow due to the level of new business we expect to write and the strong persistency.12) we'll still have those discussions internally about dividends back to shareholders. But at this point, we are not ready to announce anything. (notice: here I strongly believe that if pps is above book value, it is better to use free money instead of buyback for paying the dividend)13) we’re just not to be able to make any comments about the ILN or potential implications of it. (notice: about ILN pls refer to this link http://www.artemis.bm/blog/2018/07/31/mgic-watching-as-mortgage-insurance-linked-note-market-hits-2-2bn/14) lower expense ratio is driven by the reserve release15) Still have very favorable views about housing in general across the country. And originators in this cycle do not control the credit box. The GSEs do and most of our business goes to GSE route. So the GSE is the one controlling the credit box. So mortgage market is not competing at credit this point in time, which is different than prior cycles. And I think that's very favorable. So we feel very, very good about where the market is right now both from a credit standpoint and from a housing standpoint."
No reason for this to be dropping
"""Despite the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the housing market has been resilient and, given our market presence and the overall market size, we wrote $112.1 billion of new insurance in 2020, including $33.2 billion in the fourth quarter. As a result, insurance in force increased more than 10% year-over-year, despite the lower annual persistency associated with the strong refinance market. In 2020, we further strengthened our already strong capital and liquidity positions by reducing the amount of holding company debt due in 2023, increasing liquidity at our holding company, ceding additional risk through reinsurance transactions, and increasing MGIC's statutory and PMIERs capital positions."" Mattke continued, ""In 2020 our company wrote a record volume of new business while being challenged by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including higher losses incurred, especially in the second quarter of the year. I am very proud of our team members who remain focused on executing our business strategies and providing critical support for our customers and the housing market, especially for first-time homebuyers, as we all continue to navigate through the current environment."""
That was an odd dip on Friday. And Tuesday should be the monthly stats again. I would expect them to be pretty good again. THe 3rd q earnings will be the bigger announcement. Can they meet or Beat forecast?

I have MTG to $20 as the PT this year.
Everyones afraid of the recession. How many layoffs/ lost jobs are going to turn into late mortgage payments/ foreclosures thus losses for MTG?Sideways for a while to come
If best management can do is 1.1 times book value; then I say it time to sell to an entity that is more focused on shareholders. They issue tons of stock options and stock awards on top of extremely inflated compensation and the stockholders get 1.1 times book and 7 PE? Thought maybe new CEO would be a little more proactive to increase stock price; but appears based on his actions since earnings that he is just another one hoping to get rich on the gravy train.
Beat by .03. Revenues a little shy. 306 mil vs 310 mil cons.
"At 0.84x year-end 2020 Book Value, I suggest that longs email investor relations and suggest that the best thing that they could do-- is to be in the market buying their own stock today-- in a big way. A 16% earnings yield and a P/E just above 6. I have no idea what the market is thinking here."
"So the banks are all up 2% and hitting new highs and MTG and the PMI's are down 1-2% today. Makes ZERO sense. Stocks are almost 100% correlated, and rightly so. So either MTG and the PMI's rally next week, or the bank stocks decline. My bet is that the PMI's rally next week."
Would be nice if the common would see a nice quarterly dividend. That may increase the share price and reward those who have been supporting.

"from CC:our post 2008 business is producing and the favorable operating environment, we are experiencing especially as it relates to employment, wage growth and housing fundamentals. Our inventory of delinquency notices continuous to decline is at a level not seen more than 20 years.Existing insurance in force has very strong credit characteristics and is expected to generate meaningful returns for shareholders.We are writing high-quality new business in what is expected to be a low loss environment that is being added to an existing book of business it is performing exceptionally well.

"14-day RSI for MTG hasn't been this low since 12/24/18, when the market basically crashed. MTG subsequently rallied big-time over the following 3-months, up about 40%."
"I believe this is the case of a broken stock not a broken company. The way I see it this is a great company with great fundamentals and higly undervalued. I believe it will rebound sonner or later the same way it happened with ANET or WYNN just weeks ago, which i bougth on the low and got sweet profits on it. I am bying MTG and I believe sonner or later it will pay off."
"The new CEO started in April 2015 and on April 27, 2015 the stock closed at $10.60. For three years we have had low interest rates, strong home sales and refi, increasing property values in almost every market of the country and strong employment. The CEO averaged between $4.7 Million and $5.0 Million every year in compensation or roughly $15MM over that three year period. Why would a BOD reward an employee with $15MM to tank the stock from $10.60 to $10.05 unless this nothing more than a good ol boys club or he has a video of the BOD doing/saying something inappropriate. I wonder how well he will navigate the company when things get tough in the marketplace? The stock will revisit single digits and they probably will increase his comp to $7MM a year. I am shocked no hedge fund or institutional investor has not put pressure on the BOD to sack this worthless CEO."
I guess the market believes the Democrats are going to win

"Does it make sense that MTG is down 19% in just 6 trading days?? Analyst estimates have been rising over the last 30, 60 and 90 days-- and are up substantially over the last 90 days. Stock near $12 is at 7.5x 2019 estimate. Company is in the best fiscal and financial shape in its history-- best capital cushion of all-time. Business is very healthy. And many secular tailwinds that should be in their favor over the next 3-5 years. Year-end Book Value (BV) should be around $10. And MTG has traded in a range of 1.8-1.15x year-end BV since 2013, with the one exception being early 2016. Aside from early 16, MTG has not traded below year-end BV since the company's solvency was in question during 2009-2012. My view is that we are close to the bottom here-- 1.15x year-end BV is $11.50/sh. High end target should be close to $18 during THIS year. 2019 BV could be $11.50, putting 2019 high target over $20. That's a 70%+ return between now and sometime in 2019."
ok now what is the announcement to cause another 10% decline this morning.

Great job management. In a very strong housing market/economy you have shaved of more than $1.4 BILLION in market cap. I imagine the friends on the board will reward Sinks and company with bonuses and and another million free shares. Since Sinks took over they have awarded him with over 1.3 million shares on top of his $3 million a year paycheck and the stock has done absolutely nothing except decline. Just brilliant!
Biggest overreaction in the history of the stock market!!! No joke. A pilot program that will be most likely without a pilot in short order. No chance that this program gets any traction. The whole thing is a joke. Only beneficiaries are the ones who buy MTG and RDN late today and tomorrow.

"FINALLY I found out why MTG has been trading off since 12/22. MTG talked about the proposed changes to PMIERS requirements that are being recommended by the GSE's: ""If the GSE-recommended changes are adopted with an effective date in the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect that at the effective date, Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation would continue to have an excess of 'Available Assets' over 'Minimum Required Assets,' although this excess would be materially lower than it was at September 30, 2017 under the existing PMIERs, and that MGIC would continue to be able to pay quarterly dividends to our holding company at the $50 million quarterly rate at which they were paid in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, we expect cash at our holding company during the fourth quarter of 2018 would increase over what it is expected to be at December 31, 2017.

Very good monthly report again. Insurance in force up nicely.
earnings are stellar as expected... book value added another $0.64 per quarter to $10.72EPS $0.42 will get MTG over $15...easy :-)

MTG is up 5.00% to 13.23
MTG is a NO-brainer investment with great Profits so why doesn't it trade up to above $17 like I think it will?
I predict upgrades and new PT as high as $20 should be coming in.
I wish they start paying dividends on the common. That would help the price of this stock...
Time for MTG to be sold to another company
"MTG likely to do 2.00/share in earnings in 2020, as such, the stock should be $16 in short order. Keep in mind that the way the market is acting-- hasn't happened since 1995, when the S&P 500 was up 34%. The last time the S&P 500 rose at least 10% while at the same time the 10-year TNote fell by more than 100bp during the first 9 months of the year. The ""everything"" rally. Suggests no recession and a market that keeps going up."
One year ago the stock was $14. I bet the executive management team get rewarded another 1 million shares of free stock for their great management abilities bringing the stock down to $12. It makes one wonder why the BOD even has performance guidelines for these great managers.
Come on management let's start paying a dividend!!!

MTG investors getting ready for the monthly operating statistics again on Monday or Tuesday. Should be good. So should get a 40 cent pop on opening. THen will have to hold to see if any surprises in their quarterly earnings announcement. Will have one month of lower prices in it. But we can hope for a return to $12 cant we?

"I am no expert but this looks like a huge sector rotation by some hedge funds or mutual funds. Volume is too great to be just on this news. who knows if this move wouldn't generate more revenue since more could now afford policies? Volume is 3-4 time normal for Esst, RDN, all before noon. NO one moves funds like that with such neutral news. Mortgage insurers were always discounting rates. This was RDN's MO with single premium programs. truly this is nothing new, just now publicized and brought to the forefront by MTG. still a $20 stock--- unless there is some hidden gov. legislation out there."
OMG!! Is MTG “flinching”?

Good monthly numbers!
Wow. Mtg having a nice move. Hit new yearly high. Surprise Eps coming this quarter? I suspect technical charts like this move and would indicate a higher price is coming.Finally has recovered all of precovid losses.

Time for MTG to pay a dividend what do you think.
"MTG is getting slowly to the range, where BOD will reconsider instead of buyback of shares the dividend... as noted carefully during last CC"
"In 1994, as the US was coming off the recession of 1990-91, MTG had a BV of $7.18/sh. Stock traded that year in a range of 17.13-12.50. In 2 years, in 1996, BV went to $11.59/sh and MTG traded in a range of 38.88-25.81. In 1997, MTG hit $67/sh. Remember that housing was really bad from 1990-93, in fact 1993 was a great time to buy residential real estate. I see a lot of parallels to that today."
"The Board of Directors of MGIC Investment Corporation (NYSE:MTG) today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share.The dividend is payable on August 28, 2020, to shareholders of record on August 11, 2020."
Whats the word today. Other Mortgage insurers did alright today. what was news on MGt? False drop? Buy now?
Great quarter!!!
Looks like the shorts were trying to cover themselves today

"#MTG Looking good for higher prices. MACD, Stochastic oscillator and RSI are turning up at stoxline. Long over 12.23 for a run up to 14.28."
"MGIC Investment beats by $0.04, reports revs in-lineReports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.43 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.39; revenues fell 3.0% year/year to $302.28 mln vs the $301.73 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus."
I bought 55k shares in August of 2012 for 1 dollar a share.
"Management was so conservative in their commentary, not surprised that the stock is down a few pennies. However with new FHA head and new FHFA head coming in soon-- there is no question that private capital will take share. That is hugely positive news for the PMI's. But they don't want to get ahead of themselves, hence the conservative commentary. Once PMIER's is finalized on 3/31, look for MTG to initiate a dividend. BV could get to $12/share by year-end 2019, and a 1.6x BV at some point in 2019 puts MTG close to $20/share. I could easily see MTG at $20 in the next 12 months."
Anybody know why the spike on the open and why so strong this morning? Don't think it's just the housing data and I can't find anything news related to the company or the industry.
"Every month better and better :-) MGIC Investment (NYSE:MTG) reports February insurance in force of $210.8B, up 7.3% Y/Y and flow only of $24.1B, up 8.1%.Ending primary delinquent inventories decreased to 32,692 from 33,488 at the beginning of the month."
"Let's take a quick poll thumbs up for ""YES"" thumbs down for ""NO"" will MTG make it to its 1-year estimate of $15.85 in the next 12 months?"
39 million shares traded today what gives?
"Now that MTG is a cash generating machine and has been for awhile, when are they going to buy back some of their shares?!?"
"At the end of March 31, 2017 MTG had a 341 million share float, by the end of March 31, 2018 MTG had a 371 million share float. What caused their share float to increase by 30 million in one year?!?This 200 million dollar share buy back will barely bring MTG back to it's starting point of shares at the end March 31, 2017 of 341 million. I'm dissapointed..."
1/8/18Deutsche Bank Upgrades MGIC Investment (MTG) Hold -> Buy $18.00
This stock has done so badly-- and there is so much private equity money sloshing around-- someone should take out MTG at $20.
Why is MTG trading at this level $14.09?
"RICK11Looks like you've been holding on to dead $$$$... Even though the PE is insanely low, there is a price war in the industry...lower returns on Capital... $$ is be invested elsewhere for now....Rick11 months agoReplied to a reaction$MTG conversationHey genius--give me the date in 2010 that the stock was $1. I can prove my point that in April 2010 the stock hit $13.80. I don't see where the stock was ever much below $7 in 2010. I think you miss the point. Since 2010 the stock has under performed every pmi company--actually almost every insurance company, bank or finance company. Yet management GAVE themselves over 12 million shares in stock grants and who knows how many million more options plus their inflated salaries. Yes they are buying back shares now, but they issued a whole lot of shares since 2010 to put into management's pockets. I have a cost basis of $1.227 so I am up, but it would be up more if they even equaled the performance of their industry or the market. My RDN has done better than MTG as has my BAC, JPM. Perhaps you defend the results because you are one of the employees raping the company?"
2/6/20BTIG Research MGIC Investment Corporation (MTG) $18.00 Buy
10$ here we come!
"Down 10.62% a shocker, any news"
Another great monthly operating report. This should confirm a good 4th q earnings report. But it looks like market doesn't care for this year anymore. the risk is next year? Does inverted yield curve hurt them badly?
"great quarter. earnings should be up 10% for the year-- 1.96 and another 10% in 2020, would put 2020 earnings at $2.15/share. year-end 2020 book value could approach $14/share and a reasonable 1.6x BV (within the range of the last 5 years) gets you to $22 a share in 2020. earnings in 2021 could be 2.35-2.40 and $22/share would be only 9x that. My target is $22 in 12-18 months."
2/8/18Wells Fargo & Co Reiterates MGIC Investment (MTG) Buy
"Great numbers and which direction do we go, makes one wonder if stock fundamentals really do matter! Not to mention were in rally mode and bank stocks are moving nicely. This is by far the worst performing equity in my portfolio.....sad"
"Book Value for sure is a lagging indicator and PE in and of itself means nothing if the company isn't expected to make money. I've lost money on plenty of stocks priced lower than the cash they have on hand - they end up burning the cash trying to stay alive and eventually the little scale balances out. Less cash, lower stock price"
MTG is up 5.05% to 15.97
"New head of FHA confirmed last week, and a new head of FHFA in 6 months-- will be HUGE for PM Industry. Price competition overblown. I see MTG doubling in 18 months. >$20 by year-end 2019. Mark this post."
"GET IN NOW!!PMI COMPANIES GETTING READY TO ""ROCK N' ROLL'1. MGIC INVESTMENT. REPORTS DIVIDEND TO HOLDERS2. NMI HOLDINGS AND ESSENT GUARANTY REPORTS PROFITS IN A WEEK3. MGIC AND RADIAN REPORTS EARNINGS THE FOLLOWING WEEKBased on trends in lower delinquencies and stable revenues, expect analyst *estimates blowouts**Don't be waiting for the news to buy, when smart money will be taking profits."
Stock should be 20 a share with these earnings.
"Stock price on 1/2/2018 was $14.33. At 12/31/2018 price was $10.80 for over a 32% drop in stock price. The BOD awarded the CEO 350,000 shares of stock for that performance and gave the entire management team hundreds of thousands of shares. They gifted the previous CEO 195,000 shares in November. Makes one wonder what their performance goals are cause it sure has nothing to do with providing value to stockholders."

What did they say in the Web Conference?
"Well sold the last 500 shares for break even on this piece of junk. A year and a half wasted profits oh well live and learn. I like the space though have same amount in RdN and up 30% will be adding more when better entry point presents itself. GLTA if your still stuck, don't see this getting any better with the same management. Peace!"
"Did you see the 1.3 million share trade that crossed at closing? Hoping maybe we got the seller out of the way and maybe, just maybe buyer is still out there and will run it green tomorrow for a change."
Now MTG at 0.86x my estimate of year-end BV of $14.25. Company should be buying stock today.
I forgot to mention mgic is going to $10.80 today
MTG has been beating its earning continuously with strong revenue. This stock will be $20 this year.
"MTG is going to blow analyst estimates out for Q2 and H2 2021. I calculated that they will have net cash from DELINQUENCY INVENTORY reduction to ""loan losses and lae"" of $168 million after claims. $168 million is equivalent to analyst estimates for earnings for Q2, while I doubt they will show the savings in loan losses as full profit, the book value for the Q2 period is estimated to bring book value at $14.75 from current BV of $13.95"
I wonder what they want to hide in the bag with the CT order
"""MGIC Investment September insurance in force rises 6.0% Y/Y"" who else is tired of this headline does nothing for the stock price except move it in the opposite direction. Thankfully i moved half of this position at a loss into Radian Group and in 5 months made it back and then some. The CEO of this company should of been replaced years ago so sad!"
"Excellent company...you cannot lose money on cashcow, which is used to increase bookvalue by almost 5% per quarter... book value now $10.08 ..."
"Fair value for the stock is $20 per share after this report, most underrated stock I know."
"Big insider buying today-- 155,000 shares just today. CEO Tim Mattke buys 75,000 shares. President Sal Miosi buys 60,000 shares. Nathaniel Colson CFO bought 20,000 shares."
BTIG Research Reiterated Rating BUY for MTG with price target $18 on Sunday 4/22/18. MTG will be $12+ quickly.
"So MTG grew earnings 37% in 2017 and estimates are for 1.47 in 2018, a meager 8% increase over 2017. Really?? Can we say-- conservative?? My guess is that they do something closer to 15-20%, or closer to 1.60 in 2018. That means MTG is trading at 9x 2018 earnings. And say they do 10-15% earnings growth i n 2019, that would mean 1.80 in earnings-- and MTG at 8x 2019 earnings. At looking at BV-- current 8.51 BV would go to around 10 by year-end 2018 and possibly 12 in 2019. I think MTG hits $20 in the next 12 months."
"If homebuilder sentiment drops, can’t mortgage insurance companies still make money if people buy previously enjoyed homes? I thought they only lost money when unemployment goes up and people can’t pay their mortgages."
Down 6% with no news at all. RDN is down the same. Must be something industry related.
"Housing is in the best shape since May 2007, so obviously MTG stock is down :-)"
"what's going on with this company? IT'S Been a dog in my portfolio for 3 years. looking at 6 of the Las 8 quarters they have all been positive surprise earnings so what gives, looking to move over to Radian Group anyone?"
It seems that MTG earnings no longer matter!
What happened?
"Once again, I'm amazed that MTG is where it is right now. Year-end BV probably around $12. Earnings of $1.70. ROA 10%, ROE 19%. Last 4 year trading range on the high end 1.65x year-end BV-- which would put the stock at $20, and on the low end 1.05x, which puts the stock at $13. So the risk is minimal from here-- and the upside is significant. Risk/reward at $13-$20/share. Why is MTG down 2.5% today??? Makes zero sense."
"MGIC Investment beats by $0.13, beats on revs6:48 AM ET, 07/18/2018 - Briefing.comReports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.49 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.13 better than the Capital IQ Consensus of $0.36; revenues rose 7.1% year/year to $282 mln vs the $269.97 mln Capital IQ Consensus.Total assets were $5.59 billion as of June 30, 2018, compared to $5.62 billion as of December 31, 2017, and $5.60 billion as of June 30, 2017.

Primary delinquent inventory declined 12.8% year-over-year from 41,317 loans at June 30, 2017."
"ESNT is pushing through a 52 wk high today.................Why don't they just sell MTG since it's more profitable than ESNT, but its stock won't go up more than ESNT?"
"April 2010, MTG hit a high of $13.80. Tens years of strong stock market, strong, home sales, low interest rates and now MTG trades at $13.50. In April 2010, RDN hit a high of $18.68 and now trading at $24 for a 28% gain. Not great given the market but a whole lot better than 2% loss. MTG has a better rep in the MI industry but one would nt think so given performance."
"PMIERs 2.0 not as bad as feared-- great news for all PMI's. New rules take effect 3/31/19, I would expect dividend increases/initiations shortly thereafter."
2.9 million share block traded-- popping MTG up 6 cents/sh.
This is nothing other than the definition of insanity. Makes ZERO sense. One pilot program and the stock is down 16% in 3 days?? So wrong. They will report another strong 1Q in about a month-- stock is now less than 8x earnings.
was there some short covering this morning?
I've been a shareholder of MTG for 6 years now. I bought 3000 shares back in 2012 during their darkest days for 1.10 per share. I've watched over the last 6 years how this company turned into a cash generating machine. Today I had to sell all my shares for 10.40 to make the bleeding stop. It was a sad day for me to sell.I'll watch MTG from afar for now. I'll re-buy MTG once they hit their next level of support around the 5-6 dollar range as the chart looks terrible. I'm switching all these dollars into Oil and Gas now for the short term.

"Congratulations Management!! Since June 2015 you have moved the stock up a whole penny. Not sure how you accomplished such stellar performance given one of the best bull runs in market, strongest housing markets in years, historically low mortgage/interest rates but you all worked through all that and increased the stock price a penny in 3.5 years. You all deserve another several million shares of free stock and huge raises and bonuses,"

"From conference call : Mark DeVriesOkay, fair enough. And then are you thinking at all about dividend to shareholders as part of your capital returns?Timothy MattkeMark, it's one of the things that we talk about with our board pretty much every quarter just to talk about as an option and have done so far a while. I think a number of factors go into that. Obviously, we've been executing on share repurchase and I view that as preferred method concurrently. And so I'd say there's nothing imminent right now, but it's something that we always talk about as one of our options."
"Amazing to think that MTG was at this price level on Sept. 2008, right in the middle of the financial crash. A decade later and we are still here. Unbelievable."
