MAA Great stock to buy and hold. Div increase every year and growth in FFO. More people will rent then buy with the new tax bill and also change in market trend.
overpriced but good management

Buying here and hold to year-end. Renters are still going to pay their rents and dividend is a good hedge on inflation. Buy and hold.
This stock should be at 25 dollars.

Management in some of their complexes report innocent residents to corrupt police and intelligence leading to something happening in the complex known as gang stalking or counter intelligence stalking. It is very dangerous for residents and should not be happening. I raised the issue with management in Tennessee and they never did anything about it but shareholders should know what is being done with their resources. The gang stalking program is domestic terrorism.

Looks like MAA will be putting out a good earnings report later this afternoon. Buy and hold for nice profit this week.
