agilon health is down 7.18% to 32.86
(http://Fairstox.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
They are selling more stocks as private equity don't have trust in the company and want to recover it's investment in this crazy market where garbage is also getting gold's price.
So AGL is smaller in all respects than say BHG with the upside (target) being a larger % with BHG. So why the big share price differences?
"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Multistockalerts.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I donâ€™t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"
