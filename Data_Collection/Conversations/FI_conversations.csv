"So, I'm just finding out about this Merger, yeah, I know....I am way late to the party. I hold 1900 shares of FI, avg in at about $10...so stand to lose 19k?? The investigation makes it sound like Franks shares will not be dissolved??? Will there still be Franks shares after the merger? I'm I ok? DO I hold? Does anyone know what the hell is going on??"
Feel bad for folks trapped in this at 2.30 or higher. Will test 52 week low around 1.65 this week. Massive losses coming here. This is just the beginning

Taking people for a ride. Management had no clue how to run a company in this downturn. They forced all us older people into retirement. Now that's what they get at your expense.
