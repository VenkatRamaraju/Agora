"Timken with ~50% of its revenue from oversees is significantly impacted from the trade escalations. While trading at high single digits, it truly doesn't have much pricing power, more of a price taker. Its last couple of acquisitions are in the right direction of complementary lines with better margins are not near the size that enhance operations. Guidance has been cut and will probably fall to the low of that rangeBack to the mid to low 40's imho"

"Timken should benefit from the green energy push big time. The company makes some of the best precision bearings industrially available which are used in electricity producing wind turbines. As more countries push green energy initiatives the demand for wind turbines will increase the demand for these bearings dramatically. Furthermore, these bearings wear out over time so Timken will be building a growing customer list which will come back to buy again and again giving the company an incredible a locked in and growing revenue stream. In addition, did you know this well managed company is largely owner by family insiders? Management is not only good but they have a lot of their own money on the line so they have a personal incentive to develop every opportunity which would increase the shareholders value. Look for increasing dividends and appreciation to continue as this company grows and expands under the expertise of of proven winners. Still time to get onboard."

So competence is not an insurmountable issue.It has the important advantage over the orient of being closer to markets and be more culturally compatible. with the US. China might be interesting but if you look at Romania and the end of the Ceausescu regime, China acquires a completely different perspective. The USSR also unraveled at some point. Tiranny is not a reliable system."
