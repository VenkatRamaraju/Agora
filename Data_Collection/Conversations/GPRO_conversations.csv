What’s up with this stock? Nothing but good news since Friday and we are red? Bought more at 9.91. Way over my limit of money I wanted to invest in GoPro but this stock looks like an easy 5 point pop by launch. New desktop Quik any day now as well. Adobe deal?? GPRO has never been cheaper. Good luck!
Investors missing the story
September 14 Citi tech conference. GoPro is presenting at that conference. I hope they will have a launch date for new hardware by then. I think we get a surprise like new session or MAX 360 in addition to HERO 10. New desktop QUIK and editing software any day now. Good luck longs!
"5k60 is going to be amazing! Everyone is going to be uploading to the Gopro Plus Cloud and YouTube, Facebook etc"
GoPro just surpassed 1600 international patents. 1000 national. Yesterday it was a patent for unmanned vehicle(drone)technology. That’s two published drone related patents in as many months. Impressive. Wonder what GoPro is up to in the drone business ??
"HERO10 leaks! 23 mp sensor, 4K120, 5K60, and yes the new GP2 processor! Hyper smooth 4.0. Same size and design as HERO 9 but with blue lettering. The GP2 should really make this camera much faster and touch screen smoother to touch. New sensor with a more powerful processor supporting the firmware should make for better low light filming as well. I like what GoPro did with the 10. Basically a turbo version of the 9. LOL. Everything we needed. Not full of bells and whistles that no one will use but will have to pay for. Mid September launch. New desktop Quik coming any day now. Life is good"
"Doubled at 9.98. Staying long through new product launch then selling half my position, again. Street is really getting bullish on GPRO. Retail sales should stay strong as most majors report this week. GoPro presenting at 8/25 BMO tech conference . Good luck longs!"
This stock really should rocket up at any moment
GoPro GRIP. Anyone else seeing this on blogs/YT?? New GRIP mod will be released with HERO 10. Interesting. Seems that the 10 release will have some surprises with it. Looks good!
Fidelity increased their position by 23% last quarter ending 6/30
Anyone read the latest article from Zacks? Adobe and GoPro “partnership” ?? New “GoPro channel” ?? Allows content creators to make money by licensing content and advertising. GoPro will be “dominant” player in VR with new hardware and software. Is this a leak before announcement or did I miss the Adobe partnership?
Reminds me $SONO last year.Same profile. Niche product companies. Gopro has added advantage in subscription model.
just bought a hero 9... first gopro since first Session... wow... the stabilization is amazing... buying more gpro....
Super turn around …$25 by July 2022
"Added at the close, 9.54. DJI event is over today and no mention of a action camera. I don’t see it as a threat to GoPro but any announcement could make for a nice dip in GoPro stock. I was waiting to buy that dip. I guess this was a nice dip on down market and possible news from DJI."
We all know by now that this company's price-per-share is currently controlled by hedge fund players. It has nothing to do with the company itself. The recent rise and consequential dip was due to anticipation of any Hero 10 news which was not forthcoming at the time. Just hold on to your shares for the eventual news release.
My latest DD on GPRO. Potentially the most undervalued stock in the market right now:https://antoniolinares.substack.com/p/gpro-potentially-the-most-undervalued
gpro is a serious value play.. the value is really extremely cheap
"lets start with the bear case PE of30 ok its higher than average but its because its growing and its growing MASSIVELY!since the launch of this year service of gopro the revenue increased by 88% YoY!!!Gross margin +110%!!while costs have only increased 40-50% W O W!Gopro has a bad name to it, its like dbx. its a niche company player blablabla ... but seriously its beyond cheap. Growth is accelerating, even if by any means gopro stop growing and keep this level of revenue.at the end of the year they would have a PE of around 15 for a growth stock that climbs 88%+YoYThe ceo even said that growth is accelerating, as more people go outside now with the covid fear goijg away."
Looks like Wednesday the 15th is day of official announcement.from what I have read this is worth the upgrade. HERO 8 here so going to 10 with GP2 and front screen will be a nice step up. Never got to use my 8 much with covid wrecking 2020 travels sell it on eBay or have 2 GoPros  road trip!!!
