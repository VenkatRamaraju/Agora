Doubled at 10.74. Earnings 8/4. Hopefully this turns up as earnings near.
Two minute look on m N M D neededNept alsoBuddah
"Still holding my Oct/21' $15 call options, but also saw opportunity to buy ~ 7,400 shares when it was about 3.25% down at/near the open. Expect to see a) either a run up to earnings, or b) coil tightly at or near the $11 level and watch it spring post earnings."
Listening to BMO presentation. CFO just confirmed GoPro has what it needs to meet new hardware demand through end of 2021 and into 2022. GoPro will meet or beat previous financial guidance for 2021. I am looking forward to the GP2 processor capabilities in the new HERO 10 and MAX.
Looks like Friday was a head fake. Wouldn’t be surprised to see 12s by end of week.
last earnings this opened at 12 and sold down to 10. not sure what happens this time but def 10 is a great entry so thank you!
$12 this week
Fidelity bought a huge position last quarter
Over $12 this week
is there any reason why it should have fallen 4.5%?
Going down real hard today
Wish i would have bought more this morning.....great quarter.....
Looks like Wednesday the 15th is day of official announcement.from what I have read this is worth the upgrade. HERO 8 here so going to 10 with GP2 and front screen will be a nice step up. Never got to use my 8 much with covid wrecking 2020 travels sell it on eBay or have 2 GoPros  road trip!!!
"Zuoro, the cloud based subscription service running GoPro QUIk service, congratulated GoPro for surpassing one million subs on June 22. Looks like this quarter will see a good number of new subs. That 2 million plus subs by year end is looking more likely. HERO10 will make for a ride in subs after mid September launch. New drone? GoPro has received a recent patent on drone technology and applied for more. Interesting."
At least I can go back to selling Puts. LOL
"5k60 is going to be amazing! Everyone is going to be uploading to the Gopro Plus Cloud and YouTube, Facebook etc"
This may close in the red. Go figure.
A big one: almost 20K shares
Back in at 10.56…LONG! LOL. Nice trade. I really hope Woodman doesn’t F this one up.
This jewel in on it's way up up up up and away. GO GO GPRO.
Another good day to buy. I’m running out of money over here but had to add at 9.97. This stock will be 12-13 by September launch of new hardware/software. Assuming markets are back up. Good luck longs!
What is up with this Company? Every Co flys in this market with good news and reorganization’s. Not This one!! Dismal
"And now the bad news. Woodman couldn’t answer the question on virtual tech interview yesterday about what future products GoPro has for growth. He stuttered. Not his usual blow hard self. Glad I sold right after. Lowering of subscription expectations to 1.7 million by year end, down from 2 million, makes me a bit nervous. Can we get a management team that can really develop the potential of GoPro? Please!"
Buy order at 9.99 pls I love sales
Get in under $11…in 12 months This is $25
"#$%$ !! Come on GoPro, say something. Give your investors some hint of what is going on!!!"
It's launch time. Gopro Plus is qnq amazing subscription service. Most new subscribers are joining specifically because it stitches your auto 8-minute split videos into its original single take for replay on the Gopro site or full res download to your mac/pc. It's the best of all worlds : auto split for quick reframe and a full long version on the cloud as long as you have wifi auto upload enabled. No competitor has anything like this
One word : #$%$
"Definite price MANIPULATION going on here. Volume is high for only 2 hours. Earnings are ""Stellar"". Yet price per share is not moving by much."
34k and 26k shares Back to back
Undervalued company
"Ask 95 percent of the people in the us what a GoPro is and they will know what it is, yet it is trading with companies that barely even have a logo made up. Wow how the market works."
$10 either $8 or $12 But in this bear market anything possible..
we seem to be building a very solid base in the $9-$10 range. Not sure what it will take to move this up to new ATH and stick? We have smashed our numbers for 3 qtrs .
Reminds me $SONO last year.Same profile. Niche product companies. Gopro has added advantage in subscription model.
"Any details about the earnings? the jump after hours says it all, but i did not find any details yet..any help appreciated "
"Solid earnings on the 5th and will be the last time we’ll see this below 10, new hero camera success should see 15+ by Xmas"
GoPro just surpassed 1600 international patents. 1000 national. Yesterday it was a patent for unmanned vehicle(drone)technology. That’s two published drone related patents in as many months. Impressive. Wonder what GoPro is up to in the drone business ??
just bought a hero 9... first gopro since first Session... wow... the stabilization is amazing... buying more gpro....
only thing keeping gpro down is the subscription churn rate
September 14 Citi tech conference. GoPro is presenting at that conference. I hope they will have a launch date for new hardware by then. I think we get a surprise like new session or MAX 360 in addition to HERO 10. New desktop QUIK and editing software any day now. Good luck longs!
JUST IN:David Einhorn's Greenlight CapitalNotable Q2 Buys/Increases:GoPro Inc (NASDAQ: GPRO)Teck Resources Ltd (NYSE: TECK)ODP Corp (NASDAQ: ODP)SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY)Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ: EXPE)
Going down real hard
what's up with the new patent for drones...
The combo “buy and subscribe” works great for GoPro. It’s already proven for two years now
Perfect company
If GOPRO shows a profit .06 share tomorrow-the stock moves past $7 and on the way to 9 by year end. Finally right sized the company and with expanding margins with subscription growth and direct channel That points to upward move. With vaccine in Q4 and consumers with more cash-its all good.
Why this CEO is keep selling?
Just Memes and Hedges at play before earnings.
TV news said Pfizer vaccine going to be approved on Monday. That means a lot of people will vaccinate = geat for go pro
gpro is a serious value play.. the value is really extremely cheap
"Bought 10k more shares today. Tail winds stimulus money, return to travel and opened economy. A full year of operational excellence will prove profitable growth."
A big beat
Added at the close. 10.03. I think good news is building for end of September hardware and woodman sounded positive today in BMO conference saying that Quik for desktop coming soon and demand for editing tools seeing big demand. CFO confirmed chips needed for new hardware is available and reiterated 470-500 million in cash year end 21. Debt due in April 22 not a problem.
Someone just bought 7300 shares wow
What’s up with this stock? Nothing but good news since Friday and we are red? Bought more at 9.91. Way over my limit of money I wanted to invest in GoPro but this stock looks like an easy 5 point pop by launch. New desktop Quik any day now as well. Adobe deal?? GPRO has never been cheaper. Good luck!
So the really good news is the fact that GoPro raised guidance. Not a lot of people but a few have brought up the global chip shortage possibly delaying the HERO 10. CC after hours would have been a warning not a raise for rest of year if that was the case. GoPro obviously has what they need(GP2) image sensor etc. for new hardware. With that doubt removed we are on our way to new highs as release date is set for new product. HERO 10 and new 360 MAX look like easy bets. Good luck longs!
I like the spike i. Share price but volume is not explosive kind of volume I would like to see…. Let’s see if this retraces quickly or if this is going to ascend for a while…. Let’s get to at least $12 this week!
"Ok, so we're not seeing the blowout numbers to drive post ER surge in the price... I'll grant that.For the first time since buying shares I read the full earnings report and I must say I am impressed with the turnaround:1) free cash flow of > 300M as of Q4 is pretty impressive;2) transition to direct sales will continue to drive results in 20213) the $49/$99 subscription is evidently a no-brainer for retail customers, especially when they save so much on the unit and accessories4) enhancements to the app and the potential to convert free app users to paid subscribers - this will have the effect of converting to future purchasers of >$300 units5) reduction in capex was largely related to displays/costs associated with staging the GOPRO displays in retail locations... with transition to direct sales this capex reduction is likely to be a permanent savings6) appearance of direct sales underperformance is explained by better-than-expected rebound in retail salesThe Guidance given is resoundingly conservative for 2021 I believe. With a forward PE of 7-11 this is a steal for anyone who is wanting to hold this for 12 m or more. But even for the next 6 months I believe we'll see steady climb from $9 to $15, but believe we'll hit $20 before the end of the year.When asked what the plan was for leveraging the cash flow, the CFO I believe said they rolled some of it into debt retirement and planning for some that are due in 2025. This is building investor value.Summary - we're not going to see a short squeeze.... and No Reddit pumped craziness. BUT I now believe we'll see $20 before 12/31/2021. At this price point it's worth holding.Would love to get your reaction to my post. Rational discussion everyone."
NEXT ---- GOPRO 10.
I thought I missed out on the good earnings. Got a decent entry point
Call the Reddit army to the rescue
"GPRO has a real battle on its hands :-(...............This stock should be much higher. There are so many speculative companies out there with much less of a product, sales or story that are off the charts. These guys are in a clear turn around. They are at 1.5x revs.... that's ridiculous... The cash-flow alone is worth 3X"
It’s not going down today. Definitely.
"This is going to crash hard by 7/23, and then recover and break beyond its top barrier through the following week."
Photo editing
My biggest concern is not GPRO moving up 50-100% over the next year. Im more concerned with a major correction in the market that shakes the momentum out of everything. Apple (DOW 30) finally dropped to a reasonable 27PE for a strong market. However Amazon and other FANGS are still stratospheric.
got in at $9 ran up to $10 tehn dropped 8 in Feb. And it climbed all the way to $13.. didnt take profit. Now it back to $10 for the past 3 months. Obvious i average up a little and messed up my avg cost. Now im holding the bag..
https://mundoconectado.com.br/noticias/v/19577/dji-osmo-action-2-aparece-com-gravacao-em-8k-60fps-rumor
GPRO reminds me of GME. Decisions have been made by analysts no matter what the company does. Then boom
"Wow! The market doesn't give a S**t about this stock. Beat top line and earnings and the next day is ""ho hum."" I would understand if the price movement is minimum but the volume isn't even there... oh well. We'll have to wait for the market's reaction in the coming 30 days, we're going to wake up and suddenly see that the valuation has changed and we'll be in the $13. I was hoping to see it with knockout earnings..."
Well this is unexpected. Earnings tomorrow and new product releases on the horizon and stock can’t hold 10.00. GPRO has risen in far bigger sell offs before. Tomorrow is the tell. Good luck!
"To see what could and might happen to GoPro' price per share, just take a look at another camera company - SNAP, which went from under $8.00 per share to over $70.00 within the past 12 months. They also have a similar EPS."
Super turn around …$25 by July 2022
Time for a gamma short. Cheap 2 day options out of the money and heavily shorted. If we make a run past 11 there will be a bunch of buying to cover those calls sold
Einhorn takes it so slow
Was looking through current job openings on GoPro. 2-3 positions labeled “Confidential job title/description” obviously GoPro has some unexpected new tech launching soon. Interesting.
Any buyout news?
"Doubled at 9.98. Staying long through new product launch then selling half my position, again. Street is really getting bullish on GPRO. Retail sales should stay strong as most majors report this week. GoPro presenting at 8/25 BMO tech conference . Good luck longs!"
GoPro!!!
Finally going to be a go pro long after selling a put a couple of weeks ago.....feels good!
"“Companies like GoPro (GPRO) should benefit from the consumer rebound, but also have their own unique drivers of value over the next 2+ years. In the case of GPRO, the company launched its newest action camera, the GoPro9, under the umbrella of a new business model. The company offers a discount on the camera when customers purchase a subscription agreement that comes with additional services and benefits. The uptake of the subscription has been strong to date and offers the company a line of sight to a higher margin and more predictable revenue stream. The stock’s low double digit earnings multiple remains undemanding. We have seen this type of transformation play out in numerous situations in software, hardware and even retail companies such as RH. We see GPRO following suit and expect a return to travel later this year to be another reason for consumers to buy a new camera as they head back out on vacation.”"
How badly would this be doing if they had not had a good earnings report?
"How is it Ambarella does 350 mill a year and loses more than us qtrly and has a market cap of 3.6 bil. Triple us. Microvision does 2 mill a year , and has a market cap of 2.5 bill. The market really dislikes this company. Getting frustrated with my stock here."
My latest DD on GPRO. Potentially the most undervalued stock in the market right now:https://antoniolinares.substack.com/p/gpro-potentially-the-most-undervalued
Another 38k shares
I hope apple buys them out!
Am I missing something here? Clearly they are in a turn around.... what gives?????
Investors missing the story
"It's just a new OM iPhone gimbal on an extendable pole. Won't cause a dip in GPRO. Hold on, this stock is still worth way more than 10. On drones, I think GPRO know it will eventually need to get back into drones to stay relevant, so it's probably got a research group just working on stuff and getting patents where it can. Also if Skydio and GoPro get together, it's even better to have something they want."
Look for a positive surprise on earnings day
Fidelity has a huge position ..third largest holder. All bought in the winter of 2021
Fidelity increased their position by 23% last quarter ending 6/30
Nice article on Seeking Alpha today. Says a lot of very positive info. See's more upside even know its doubled this year. Thinks market is not recognizing their turn around.

This will be like Garmin. It will make a come back.
This is ready to fall Time to buy protective puts !
"lets start with the bear case PE of30 ok its higher than average but its because its growing and its growing MASSIVELY!since the launch of this year service of gopro the revenue increased by 88% YoY!!!Gross margin +110%!!while costs have only increased 40-50% W O W!Gopro has a bad name to it, its like dbx. its a niche company player blablabla ... but seriously its beyond cheap. Growth is accelerating, even if by any means gopro stop growing and keep this level of revenue.at the end of the year they would have a PE of around 15 for a growth stock that climbs 88%+YoYThe ceo even said that growth is accelerating, as more people go outside now with the covid fear goijg away."
gopro being gopro
"why with exceptional strong report moving 20% after h above $12 suddenly GPRO become garbage with low volume , what do i miss ?????"
It would be nice to hear some buyout news
Market is at its lowest…vaccines are done..it’s the time for the sun to shine…simple logic guys!
Slowly but surely
Anyone read the latest article from Zacks? Adobe and GoPro “partnership” ?? New “GoPro channel” ?? Allows content creators to make money by licensing content and advertising. GoPro will be “dominant” player in VR with new hardware and software. Is this a leak before announcement or did I miss the Adobe partnership?
Wow. I expected a much bigger pop at open. I took some profit at 10.78. Still long majority of my position but this whole COVID thing is going to cause a correction. I think that is weighing on GPRO now. Travel restrictions. Buy back in the 9s…or 8s.
YES!!!! Congrats to all that held in long! Here we go!
Don’t panic sell!
Anyone catch the Hawaiian plane crash into ocean? ABC news anchor is basically an ad for GoPro. Tik Tok account for GoPro has it. Free publicity! No one died
Boom!
"HERO10 leaks! 23 mp sensor, 4K120, 5K60, and yes the new GP2 processor! Hyper smooth 4.0. Same size and design as HERO 9 but with blue lettering. The GP2 should really make this camera much faster and touch screen smoother to touch. New sensor with a more powerful processor supporting the firmware should make for better low light filming as well. I like what GoPro did with the 10. Basically a turbo version of the 9. LOL. Everything we needed. Not full of bells and whistles that no one will use but will have to pay for. Mid September launch. New desktop Quik coming any day now. Life is good"
GPRO reminds me of Sonos $SONO last year when it was in lingering in 15-17 dollar range.GPRO is seeing even better turnaround than Sonos.
Another 7100 shares wow
I’d suspect the trading volume spike was short covering. Around the same time $PLTR had a spike in volume as well.
Brother arthur and I are here!!!! gonna go up up and up!!!
We all know by now that this company's price-per-share is currently controlled by hedge fund players. It has nothing to do with the company itself. The recent rise and consequential dip was due to anticipation of any Hero 10 news which was not forthcoming at the time. Just hold on to your shares for the eventual news release.
Price target $25
Great earnings. Probably see $18-20 going into Xmas shopping season if Hero 10 rolls-out.
"Motley Fool may be warming up to GPRO! Saw a nice article about the company's expansion into lifestyle niche products, low tech, brand-loyalty-building items like sunglasses, backpacks and T-shirts. A parallel might be the evolution of Thule products over the years. Personally speaking, I associate Thule with cutting edge travel gear, and would pick it over a no-name brand all things being even. Now, I find Thule to be expensive, so always looking for sale prices but prefer Thule over Yakima or Sears brand carrier boxes for my mini-van. Even have a Thule laptop case for its ruggedness and ""look."" Maybe GPRO can be that for the sporting enthusiast, semi-professional camera enthusiast. Over time would like to see a wider moat, because right now it's still very much a one-trick pony.... so there's risk there no doubt about it. But I'm bullish right now! On the price front, it's clearly settling, consolidating north of $10-11. Forget about seeing this at $9 unless there is bad news or Aug earnings are hugely disappointing. If you believe there's good new ahead, better get in while it's in the $11 range. Don't see it going down much before early Aug."
"Korr Acquisitions sends letter to GoPro (GPRO), says stock could be worth $9.49-$14.97 per share to buyer"
If Nick can invent a Camera that others could not. I’m sure he can get around problems. His strategy “buy and subscribe” works and you know it. So stop crying like a baby 
what does this company need to do....
The move up begins …buy at $10.15
Can see a move above $12 this week
For all you long-termers patience. Hold this through 2023 and we'll be handsomely rewarded
"One just bought 30,000 shares shares. Must be David Einhorn"
This stock really should rocket up at any moment
"GPRO has been taken down by the market underperformance of small caps. Tomorrow is the earning release and if the 100% growth and earnings numbers are confirmed $GPRO will fly. GoPro has had a “Why?” tag on it for a long time. Proof of why will rocket GPRO up, many don’t believe the GoPro turnaround is in tack and one extra quarter of proof could be all that is needed. We’ll see Thursday after market close."
"It appears the consolidation phase is over, and the market is beginning to realize the potential in Gopro and the negative sentiment is dissipating. This is going to be a cash cow in the future with its subscription business. I am currently looking at a $20-$25 price target. Once it gets to around $15 I will sell a long dated call to achieve my sell price target while also taking some money and risk off the table. This is a no brainer. I was hoping to get in around 10.25 to 10.30 today but never pulled back far enough and pulled the trigger at 10.72. I didn't want to chase it above $11. Should be a good purchase price in either case. I also have Coin (Coinbase) which has taken off. I am hoping to sell a call on that stock sometime this week and may put more money in here."
One of these nights something amazing will happen and the shorts will loose control. Who knows when though
DJI announced a tech reveal event for September 8. “Hi Five” they are calling it. If this is an osmo Action launch along with new phantom drone or gimbal we might see a dip in GPRO. I’m using that dip. Sold some GPRO today to help fund the buying. No way Osmo camera has an effect on GoPro dominance. Emotional sell off will be a gift. Good luck! BUY!
Got a feeling GoPro will be next after Krispy Kreme
"institutions lost faith due to lack of churn numbers from initial subscribers.... if they were good/great, Nick would have willingly provided it.."
"The current stock PPS obviously has nothing to do with Gopro as a company, but is evidently being played with much like a casino where the win/lose oucome and payout is being controlled by deep-pocketed vested interests (improved operations, but, sorry, no win recognition).The Gopro product is improving and doing well, yet the controlling Wall Street ""mob"" is evidently controlling the payouts. So hold tight. The tide will eventually change due to natural forces or ""mob"" agenda."
"Garbage stock. Like the camera, but this stock is depressing"
"Added at the close, 9.54. DJI event is over today and no mention of a action camera. I don’t see it as a threat to GoPro but any announcement could make for a nice dip in GoPro stock. I was waiting to buy that dip. I guess this was a nice dip on down market and possible news from DJI."
"GoPro has expanded its product lineup–breaking ground in and beyond its well-known hardware devices–to create innovations that incorporate computer vision, software ecosystems, cloud experiences, spherical technology, new metadata formats, machine learning, artificial intelligence and stabilization solutions."
"Already, in 2 hours, the volume has reached the average volume for a FULL day."

Ceo only holds 600k shares while selling 200k a month…..6 get out of this sinking ship
"On GPRO website now...click on investor relations for PDF:I’ll cut straight to it – thanks to consistent momentum throughout the quarter and a strong launch of HERO9 Black coupled with our GoPro subscription service, in Q3 GoPro generated non-GAAP EPS of $0.20, $100 million of operating cash flow, and we expect to be profitable for the full-year 2020. Revenue in the third quarter was $281 million, up 109% sequentially. We ended the quarter with $147 million of cash on hand and expect cash to grow north of $200 million in Q4. At the close of Q3, GoPro had 501,000 subscribers, a 35% increase sequentially, and we expect to exceed 700,000 subscribers by year-end."
Apple AirCam. I watched this YouTube video a few times. As a GPRO shareholder I was concerned at first. GoPro would be hard to beat if Apple did produce this camera. I would buy the gpro dip. But then I noticed something that confirmed it is a fake. SD card. Apple NEVER uses SD cards. I use Apple products exclusively and the cloud is the future. No way Apple goes backwards. Great mock up by a GoPro short. But this is NOT an Apple design. Lens was added from iPhone 12. Front screen an Apple Watch. Clever.
"If Trump became GOPRO CEO or on board, what how would the stock perform."
Any clues on the reason for this drop today?
GoPro GRIP. Anyone else seeing this on blogs/YT?? New GRIP mod will be released with HERO 10. Interesting. Seems that the 10 release will have some surprises with it. Looks good!
"You can't watch content creators on Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok without seeing GOPRO devices everywhere. I'm in."
Nobody is interested in this company or stock.
It’s renewing subscriptions are cheap and growing
Anyone have more/better info on the new processor chip “GP2” coming in HERO 10? Amberella has introduced a new SoC with 8k and capable of streaming 4 separate 4K streams simultaneously. New HERO Max 360? Socionext has been the fabrication partner for GP1 but so far has no designs that would support a GP2 with expected capabilities. I read that Socionext will launch a new series of chips during August 17-18 announcement of new technologies. GP2 has been around since first use in HERO 6… it’s time for GP2. And of course the new one inch image sensor from Sony is pretty much a given. New HERO new Max and maybe new session in September. This could be huge! Good luck!
Gpro should do a massive share buyback
Just bought a few more shares.....im fine where im at with gpro.
Pressure is starting to build !!!
"Made a video on why GoPro is an opportunity yesterday :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG5wBJo973Q&ab_channel=SafeInvesting-over 200% subscribers beat vs FB, twtr, with their single-digit beat...-great earnings-small capacity...-so much more..."
I’m thinking the capitulation will be over soon and we’ll start a steady strong uptrend. The news is good out of GPRO and the delayed reaction on the patent portfolio could bring an unexpected quick big rise after what we would not except just looking at the price action which definitely includes someone exiting their portfolio. Once that is done we should be pleasantly surprised
from Feb to August still up 30% that is why $11 won't hold.
Someone will offer to buy gopro
I bought a ton of call options and am not really having that great run like I did when holding the stock. Might go back to buying and holding stock
"Forward PE is 14 ! When was the last time You saw a TTM PE?!? Feels funny to see it, but hope we have permanently turned the corner. Need to have strong , growing earnings going forward."
"With close to 14% of the float short, there is a lot of money that will be thrown at supporting the sell side position. You may get cheap shares but when that breaks down it should get fun. One of these huge beat quarters will do it."
Mutual funds unload
