"Initial research shows solid performance, insider investments with a possibility of reaching 80 per share this year and a div to boot. Not a bad entry point for modest gain."
This stock is a great disappointment! Market up over 200 with great jobs numbers and this stock is at the low for the day!
I absolutely agree...nice steady come back. Hats off to all the employees and management involved...I see new target growth in future.
They hired this new person from Ohio. I'm long boys.
dividend thank you.
Thank you Mr. Stone for this GEM...I look forward again for a 2/1 split.GL Longs
"It always amazes me that these prophetic Visionaries, called analysts, hold so much sway over a stock that most of them do not own. They wreck havoc on a stock that either misses their prophesied mark by a penny or there is a possibility that they can guide down ever so slightly on the next quarter regardless of the reason. Even worse, investors fall for their prophecies and sell their stock, thinking that it will not mature in the future. I have learned a long time ago that if you have a good stock that has positive income, cash flow, little or no debt, you do better to hang onto that stock then to trade it one day and the next. Unless there is a fundamental issue, a real issue, that stock will continue to grow so long as there is a need for the product or service.Too often I have watched the stock lose $10 on one day and gain it back the next. Had I sold off I would have lost my gains. Nothing I have been able to uncover suggest that this should have a 12% downward spiral. I will hold my stock."
"No Respect -This stock is and will remain amazing as an investment.Professional investors give this Company respect, but generally speaking, it gets no respect among the populace.What Mr. Wm. Stone has done is beyond comprehension and will no doubt continue as his recent acquisitions become absorbed and begin to pay off for shareholders."
"--- WARNING --- Will everyone write a small post about SSNC, we will know if Yahoo is blocking or deletedthe posts here. I believe SSNC is under the radar BUT NOT OFF THE RADAR. Thanks for help.GL Longs"
I think I’ll wait till next week to buy as it gets closer to year low..
Great company with nice growth rate. It is a buy under $80
Pick up in new contracts in financial services and progress in healthcare could take SSNC to $70 before year end. $750 MILLION (!!) allocated to stock buy back so we have seen the lows for the year.
great earnings will reach new high tmo-congrats
How can no one be following this gem?!?!?!
Singularity appears to be a great prospect for growth! Great job SSNC.
SSNC is up 4.95% to 50.05
Concerns over debt financed big deal has put pressure on stock. This is a buying opportunity IMHO for any investor with a longer term (2 years plus) time horizon. Management did an excellent and confident presentation last week at DA DAVIDSON Vertical Day Investment Conference. Replay available at SSNC website. Deutsche analyst our with updated 12 month target of $72 up 35% from current level.
No doubt next earnings will again show this as undervalued.Bill Stone is a miracle worker on integration and creating ongoing and increasing value.
"I like boards with not much talk, so I guess SSNC is still under the radar. New highs, I’m in @ $61.44 today."
UBS recommending SSNC with $86 price target for 12/21.
Amazing stock. Getting ready to sky rocket.
Great 3Q '21 numbers and more to come !SSNC is not a trade but has been and will continue to be a superior long term investment.
Chairman Stone owns 13%-more than any other software CEO of a public company? Focused!
Perfect time to buy this
Thank you again Mr. Stone for letting me have more shares today.GL Longs
$SSNC Target Raised by Raymond James Financial Strong-Buy USD 78 » USD 93 Maintains Needham & Company LLC Buy USD 80 » USD 90 Target Raised by Morgan Stanley Equal Weight USD 70 » USD 75
SS&C is up 4.96% to 79.43
Bought today for the first time at $60.50. We'll see how she does. My guess is that if the market doesn't crash we will see a slow clime to $70 over the next 3 months.
this one is totally flying under the radar. Solid fundamentals and it even pays a dividend
"Some nice run up!Some unusually number of OCT 18th calls bought.Must be expecting big news, imo.GL all longs."
"UBS analysts has reversed themselves 180% from sale in the 50s a few months back to buy: While it may be some time before the company takes on a larger deal amid the integrations of DST, Eze, and Intralinks, attractive M&A still represents optionality. ""Margin expansion"" ranked 4th as investors are generally comfortable with management's ability to operate at scale and bring recent M&A up to company-wide levels. ""Hedge fund trends"" ranked last, with end market headwinds somewhat abating from earlier in the year, but also as the hedge fund client segment now represents a much smaller portion of revenues (<30%). Valuation: Maintain Buy rating; price target of $76 unchanged Our price target is based on 19x our FY20 EPS estimate of $4.02."
enthusiasm doesn't count when adding up Revenue Dollars.. Arghh..
SSNC is up 5.02% to 44.39
Really? Look at AH.
Just a great PR today Mr. Stone thanks again.GL Longs
Strange to be down pre-market after such a beat. Cash flow free by triple digit % year on year
Same thing happened on last earnings report! Leave this one alone!
Can anyone explain to me how this company beat expectations and is now down 19% before market open?
Following this stock and waiting for a good entry point.
Looks like they tried to clear out all the stops.
