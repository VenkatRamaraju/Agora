zzzzzz falling asleep on this one
Woody looks like he needs to get to a bathroom badly in the photo of him standing at the Nasdaq desk on the website. He looks quite terrified. LOL Beautiful shot they selected to use on the home page!

"From Simply Wall Street, 1/24/2019 -- Over the last three years ALOT has shrunk its earnings per share by an average of 4.0% per year. Declining earnings per share suggest that the business performance wouldn’t really justify a high pay packet for the CEO, who joined the company in 2014. Thus, we can conclude that Greg Woods receives more in total compensation than the median of a group of companies in the same market, and of similar size."
"Wow, this is really a disturbing report, with revenues declining 6% bringing the bottom line down as well by around 8%. Where is the growth, especially since the 2nd quarter ended with a big, strong backlog? No company can continue to cut costs to achieve greater profitability, effectively reducing the size of the enterprise. Rising revenue is key to growth, and even with more sales offices, sales continue to decline, flat at best. Yet management speaks as if this is a good report! Any other company's stock price would take a 40% haircut with a report like this. The color printer division has eliminated 3 product lines and replaced them with one, which can't be a winning formula. Gone are the Vivo, Zeo and Pronto printers, each which represented different markets and applications. One sole new printer has been added to offset the loss, representing lost market coverage."
"Way to go Woody, down 20% to 16 in one fowl swoop! Hideous earnings report, you need to focus on getting some bar code printer contracts, like Zebra did. They rose to well over 100 many years ago."
ALOT is down -7.74% to 21.45
"Jim- Curious why you do not like AstroNova? I was reading though the last quarter earnings release and it appears the company has significant momentum , specifically strong bookings, revenue, and operating income growth. What am I missing ? Thank you"

"Has the dismal 2Q quarterly financial report already been forgotten? The next one will not show any significant improvement, if at all, but is guaranteed to miss the projections and company guidance, as it does every quarter. There is no rationale for this issue to rise at this time, nor in the foreseeable future. Something big has got to change, possibly a new CEO to deliver what he's handsomely paid to do. More of the same with Woody, and Singular, the sole research firm, has not even looked at the issue in two years. The annual goal of 23 has been posted since 2014 and is still an impossible stretch. They need a re-evaluation."

"Today's announced ""Everest Chart Recorder"" is a re-launch of an existing product, which I believe was called the EV-2. Now it's the EV-5000. Way to knock out exciting new products! The ""Everest Chart Recorder"" was spawned from the original Everest system, which was released around 25 yrs ago. It was great in the 90s, but is now getting long in the tooth."
"The original company name Astro-Med from the 1970s had to do with cardiology products, cath lab data recorders, not the neurological Grass products. Grass wan not purchased until the late 1990s, and the cath lab business was already finished. The flagship cardiology recorder was called the K3, and they never gained any traction and sold it to a Texas firm for pennies on the dollar. The Grass name and it's ultimate divestiture to Natus was unrelated to the ""Med"" in the company name. Woody's explanation of that new name was way off base and he completely missed the target, that they were no longer medically related because of the divestiture of Grass. The founder always had the desire to get further integrated with the medical field, but the Cath Lab recorders were the limit, and those were marketed only into the mid 1990s, before the purchase of Grass Instruments and Telefactor Corp."

"Back into the abyss, inevitably. Over 50 years, the stock has had a few periods where it got some attention, most recently getting above 26. Following those periods, it rolls over and plays dead for LONG periods of time, and the MMs let it slide down in price very gradually."
"Time for Woody to take a pay cut like the other CEOs around the country during this Corona virus time. He still gets his stock options worth more than his salary, so it is the optics. Come on Woody, the last two quarters have been awful, long before the coronavirus even surfaced. Do the right thing...And where is the buy-back program during this time of deflated share prices???? It is approved by the Board, hit the market and buy some share for the treasury at these low prices."
"Following the gradual breakout well above all moving averages -- now trading in the 14s it appears there are some large buyers slowly taking large positions and moving up the pps to the low end of next anticipated price range. We are looking very bullish now, finally, after being caught in the Covid trap for well over a year."

"I wonder how Yvonne Schlaeppi, the newly appointed director is working out. She's replaced either retiring Machletchie or Everett V. Pizzuti, who's doing the same. Pizzuti does not often get deserved credit for having been a co-founder of the co. along with the late Albert W. Ondis back in the late 60s. Cheers to them and good luck to Everett!! New management gives little credit to the people who got the whole ball rolling, conceptually and in practice. They brought it to it's current state of two divisions, one for label printers and one for T&M that includes the cockpit printer business. The founders left the co. primed for expansion with everything established and awaiting additional incentives."

"I now question valuation here, when for years this co can't seem to get out of its own way. Always a disappointment, never a strong upside surprise. They slip through right on the edge with numbers that are almost reasonable but not quite. Like Cloudera, I believe Woods needs to be replaced, he should join Tom Reilly."
AstroNova is down 5.61% to 14.65
"Is the pps really going up, or is this just another market maker ploy? There has been no material news for it to rise a full point,nothing at all. Maybe Woody has made promises to analysts on the down low, which is highly illegal. Sitting on a big fat loss since buying in the 20s, like many other people, so there is a ton of overhead resistance at every level."
"Don't sell your shares into this upward blip on little volume. Let the newcomers pay the true value, over $17. Selling would drive it quickly back to the $16 level. A quiet institution is trying to build a position by adding just a few hundred shares at a time, trying not to push the price up much."
Continued Covid recovery and the return of the Boeing 737 Max should propel the financials strongly and drive the pps back higher toward where it should be valued for a company with so many tentatacles seeking business. The small cap funds will recognize this and drive the price up over the coming quarters. There are already occasional buys that are quite large for their float size.
AstroNova reached a 52 Week low at 9.14
"Greg Trumps' annual compensation is greater the net income from any net quarter in the past year. Anything unbalanced about this distribution of wealth? He receives more in one day than any other employee during an entire year. Think about it. Even the brand new CFO, a chrony of his is doing quite well out of the starting gate."
"Dougherty & Company initiates coverage of ALOT today with a ""Buy"" rating and $29.50 price target."
"Company Market Cap is worth far in excess of $100M, and is sitting at only $77M right now. Buying at this level is like an underpriced IPO that should skyrocket, it's just a matter of when. Share price has started breaking out, but thin trading makes the timing prediction impossible."

"The QuickLabel tagline is backward, it should be, ""The Labels You Need, When you Want Them, Not ""the labels you want, when you need them"". I'm surprised nobody ever flipped that around years ago."
"Following the dismal 2Q financial report, this POS looks to be weakening to the price range in the 12s. For years it has continued to fall short of projected sales and earnings. Even after several acquisitions, revenue is only slightly higher than before the multi-million dollar acquired companies. Label and printer companies galore, even the latest in Europe, but sales still fall in the mid $20M range every quarter; should have vaulted into the mid-$30m range quarterly by now. Sell 'em if you got 'em."
"Trending up, now bid 9, ask 9-1/2. We have broken out of the base."

"Why is this stock down ANOTHER 6% today? Did they put forth grim projections for the following months? Maybe they should be utilizing this opportunity for the stock buy-back program?

"This issue is going to slowly disintegrate back to 20 if they don't issue some pertinent news to keep up the interest. Fast run to 26, now slowly dying away. One institution bought shares and one newsletter had a positive mention that drove the 6 point run. Now the Market Makers are happy to buy the shares back at lower prices, while buying interest is waning."

"Singular Research must feel like a bunch of clowns right about now. They put out a forecast of $23 dollar shares within a year around 18 months ago, and the PPS is now lower than it was then. If I were in their shoes, I think I'd reexamine my prediction and at least revise it, or even update it! What a bunch of suckers who drank the koolaid Woody is dishing out."

"We need a new CEO, an experienced one from the tech world who knows how to drive a company up, whether it be by finding a new niche, or whatever it takes to get this POS to move higher with conviction and more public interest. After 5 yrs, the pps is the same as it was when Woody was promoted. He just trudges along with more of the same, we need a shakeup. Send him home, send him home!"

"The pps has reached the slippery portion of its slope. Could easily get back to the $11-12 range now, since they never deliver, quarter after quarter, and insiders sell every share that they're awarded with.

"Whoever was selling at $10.51 this afternoon is just plain foolish. This issue is breaking out in a slo-mo fashion because of the thin nature of trading due to the small float. Watch it, will be over $11 in short order, working its way back to a fair value."
