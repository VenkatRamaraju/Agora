Excellent presentation at Sidoti this morning! Let's see if it generates any interested parties...
"From Simply Wall Street, 1/24/2019 -- Over the last three years ALOT has shrunk its earnings per share by an average of 4.0% per year. Declining earnings per share suggest that the business performance wouldn’t really justify a high pay packet for the CEO, who joined the company in 2014. Thus, we can conclude that Greg Woods receives more in total compensation than the median of a group of companies in the same market, and of similar size."
No trading equals back into the 12s AGAIN. Woody needs a pay cut according to the Zachs analysis.
"Following the gradual breakout well above all moving averages -- now trading in the 14s it appears there are some large buyers slowly taking large positions and moving up the pps to the low end of next anticipated price range. We are looking very bullish now, finally, after being caught in the Covid trap for well over a year."
"I wonder how Yvonne Schlaeppi, the newly appointed director is working out. She's replaced either retiring Machletchie or Everett V. Pizzuti, who's doing the same. Pizzuti does not often get deserved credit for having been a co-founder of the co. along with the late Albert W. Ondis back in the late 60s. Cheers to them and good luck to Everett!! New management gives little credit to the people who got the whole ball rolling, conceptually and in practice. They brought it to it's current state of two divisions, one for label printers and one for T&M that includes the cockpit printer business. The founders left the co. primed for expansion with everything established and awaiting additional incentives."
"Mini Flash Crash took out all stop loss orders down to 18.50. One needs to keep an eye on those orders, and not keep them so close to the trading range. Now the MMs have all of those shares at low prices that they will sell at higher prices in a few days when they jack it back up. Buy at this price while it's still low."
"Don't sell your shares now in the mid 16s, when this is clearly moving back toward $20 soon. The MMs will steal your shares for $16-1/2 knowing that it will be back into the 20s soon after a 2-year hiatus."
"31-MAY-16 – Astro-Med, Inc. (ALOT:NA) We are discontinuing our coverage of AstroNova, Inc. as of this report. This was posted 18-months ago by Singular Research, yet their old target of $23 still remains in places like Yahoo, etc. What is the deal with this old price target that never stood a chance?"
ALOT is down 6.72% to 16.10
"Company Market Cap is worth far in excess of $100M, and is sitting at only $77M right now. Buying at this level is like an underpriced IPO that should skyrocket, it's just a matter of when. Share price has started breaking out, but thin trading makes the timing prediction impossible."
"NewsZebra Technologies Extends Contract with National Football LeagueBusiness Wire Business Wire•August 6, 2019 -- LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Zebra Technologies Corporation (ZBRA), an innovator at the edge of the enterprise with solutions and partners that enable businesses to gain a performance edge, today announced the renewal of its partnership with the NFL. This is the type of contract that should have been sought for decades now."
"We need a new CEO, an experienced one from the tech world who knows how to drive a company up, whether it be by finding a new niche, or whatever it takes to get this POS to move higher with conviction and more public interest. After 5 yrs, the pps is the same as it was when Woody was promoted. He just trudges along with more of the same, we need a shakeup. Send him home, send him home!"
"Time for Woody to take a pay cut like the other CEOs around the country during this Corona virus time. He still gets his stock options worth more than his salary, so it is the optics. Come on Woody, the last two quarters have been awful, long before the coronavirus even surfaced. Do the right thing...And where is the buy-back program during this time of deflated share prices???? It is approved by the Board, hit the market and buy some share for the treasury at these low prices."
"In hindsight, how did this stock ever get all the way up to 26? What was that valuation based on, there was never any enormous growth in the cards? The historical PE was around 12-14, when the co was growing faster than it is now."
"Way to go Woody, down 20% to 16 in one fowl swoop! Hideous earnings report, you need to focus on getting some bar code printer contracts, like Zebra did. They rose to well over 100 many years ago."
"Don't sell your shares into this upward blip on little volume. Let the newcomers pay the true value, over $17. Selling would drive it quickly back to the $16 level. A quiet institution is trying to build a position by adding just a few hundred shares at a time, trying not to push the price up much."
Woody looks like he needs to get to a bathroom badly in the photo of him standing at the Nasdaq desk on the website. He looks quite terrified. LOL Beautiful shot they selected to use on the home page!
"Sad for the employees that have their retirement money invested in this co. They could have 3 to 10 times more if the monies were invested in other companies, or even just an S&P index fund."
Starting to anticipate some good things coming down the pike...
"Volume 89,330Avg. Volume 27,980looks good to go"
"This morning, Dougherty, the only participant on the alot CC, downgraded ALOT to hold from buy. Their rating change must have been based on the content of the call. Nice going woody."
"Jim- Curious why you do not like AstroNova? I was reading though the last quarter earnings release and it appears the company has significant momentum , specifically strong bookings, revenue, and operating income growth. What am I missing ? Thank you"
"Market cap has fallen below $100M again, a metric that took decades to overcome. Woody took over a few years back and here we sit with a broken stock and company outlook. Nice going there Mr. Boston, you did a great job cutting costs."
"I now question valuation here, when for years this co can't seem to get out of its own way. Always a disappointment, never a strong upside surprise. They slip through right on the edge with numbers that are almost reasonable but not quite. Like Cloudera, I believe Woods needs to be replaced, he should join Tom Reilly."
"Screaming buying opportunity before it moves back to the $8-$9 range and higher. Look at the chart, now that is has based in the $6 range for over 6 months and business is turning back higher."
"Dougherty & Company initiates coverage of ALOT today with a ""Buy"" rating and $29.50 price target."
"Nice going, we're heading back to the 12s, which we haven't seen in many years. Nice going Wood, really knocking it out of the park...can't find any other costs to cut?"
Will the dividend be reinstated when they return to profitability?
"Boeing 737s are back in production and will drive their printer growth, which has been pent up for 2 years. Writing is now on the wall."
Something cooking -- appears to be showing strength on very little volume. Behind the scenes???
"After all those months of selling shs at over $26, now they dump the price and will only pay $24 for the same shares. Every time this stock gets a little rally they pull the same trick. Run it up, then sell it down, or pump and dump. All buyers are now bagholders sitting on a loss."
"Wow, beautiful rise today based on the good results. This co will now continue on this upward trajectory and continue with increasing sales and earnings that beat projections going forward. Last week this stock was way underpriced."
"Why is this stock down ANOTHER 6% today? Did they put forth grim projections for the following months? Maybe they should be utilizing this opportunity for the stock buy-back program? We are down almost 50% from the $26+ price from several months ago. Buying back some shares would help to support the pps, and illustrate management believe in the co."
"Fourth Quarter, the tradionally strongest, should be particularly strong this yr with Boeing back in the mix along with the latest high end Trojan products reported to be received strongly."
What kind of response is this to a strong ER that beat EPS expectations by over 100%?
"This issue is going to slowly disintegrate back to 20 if they don't issue some pertinent news to keep up the interest. Fast run to 26, now slowly dying away. One institution bought shares and one newsletter had a positive mention that drove the 6 point run. Now the Market Makers are happy to buy the shares back at lower prices, while buying interest is waning."
"What about all of the other models of Boeing aircraft that have been sold and/or ordered while the 737 Max is grounded? I'd think they'd still be ordering the printers, no?"
ALOT is down 12.20% to 7.38
"Looks like we're squarely trading in the 12s now, which is much more appropriate than the single digit days when we formed a long base. A solid breakout is still in the cards with a strong fourth quarter to be reported Thursday morning."
Continued Covid recovery and the return of the Boeing 737 Max should propel the financials strongly and drive the pps back higher toward where it should be valued for a company with so many tentatacles seeking business. The small cap funds will recognize this and drive the price up over the coming quarters. There are already occasional buys that are quite large for their float size.
