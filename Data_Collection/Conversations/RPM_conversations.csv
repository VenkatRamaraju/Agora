RPM Investor Day November 28....
"Bought 1,000 shares in 2003 at 13,76 a share. Reinvested my dividends and now have1570 shares valued at $ 107,000. The way you make money, the BEST way, is to buy and hold good companies and REINVEST those dividends over long periods of time. Compounding your wealth and not trying to time the markets is the key. Buy and hold UNTIL THE STORY CHANGES. It is so easy.... so easy... all the yammering about bulls and bears, get in get out, is just a bunch of baloney"
Great quarter! RPM raises full year guidance to $3.00-$3.10.With a multiple of 20 RPM is a $60 stock at the minimum...
As a masonry contractor we use some RPM owned products - they are great products and the best value. Construction is booming and RPM is helping as usual.

The world need RPM products. This company will not only remain strong but get stronger.
Bought more shares at $48 this morning. Any buy under $50 is easy money...
Disappointing that RPM is the only one of my investments that has yet to issue their tax docs. Just sort of makes you wonder about how deep the issues run with this co.
RPM declares quarterly dividend of $0.35....
RPM International Price Target Raised to $97.00/Share From $90.00 by Morgan Stanley
Time for a split
"Can this stock finally hit 10B in market cap and join the ""Large Cap Big Boy Group ""?"
RPM reports another solid quarter and raises guidance for next quarter. The strategy laid out by Elliot Management is being executed... This stock is just getting started now. I see $55- $60 as a floor...

Well...somebody sold me 1450 share at $60 per share. While ask is down to 63.I am going to say 60 if not 57.
If you bought at $46-$49 then RPM is paying you with a dividend and appreciation...congrats!
I would think that with all the bad weather events that this company would be overwhelmed with business. Why isn’t it?
Buy cheap and buy quality and DRIP and don’t sell unless you see it turn bad. I’ve done that over 50 years. The problem is you have to pay a lot of tax if you sell and get too old to enjoy fun things money will buy.
"A 10% dividend increase to $.35 is a big surprise. I was expecting a raise from $.32 to $.34... It makes a difference when you own a ton of shares....RPM International Inc. (RPM) today announced at its annual meeting of stockholders that its board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share, payable on October 31, 2018, to stockholders of record as of October 16, 2018. This payment represents a 9.4 percent increase over the $0.32 quarterly cash dividend paid at this time last year.This action marks RPM’s 45th consecutive year of increased cash dividends paid to its stockholders, which places RPM in an elite category of less than half of 1 percent of all publicly traded U.S. companies. Only 41 other companies, besides RPM, have consecutively paid an increasing annual dividend for this period of time or longer, according to the Mergent Handbook of Dividend Achievers."
Stock analyst should be held accountable. Another nice buy opportunity IMHO.
