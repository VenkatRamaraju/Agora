Good time to add today or wait for under $50 entry?
"Low volumes actually driving price after open, definitely big money trying to drop price for entry point."
$48.50 is my buy range!
RPM is down 5.56% to 62.29
"RPM is outperforming every stock in my long term portfolio.I hold BMY, WFC, GIS, CSCO, TGT, RPM, PCG and XOM. All pay decent dividends. RPM stock performance has been superior...."
"A 5% selloff is no big deal, and I expect RPM to trade below $60 here very soon.Let the stock settle and maybe we can pick some up around the $55 level. There is no doubt that Elliott Management is cleaning up the mess on ""Aisle #9."" Long -term holders will know what I am talking about...."
"RPM ""Map to Growth"" plan being executed. They are consolidating factories and becoming a more efficient company. RPM is expected to earn more than $4 in 2021, and a modest 20 P/E makes it an $80 stock..."
RPM reported $69.8 million in income VS $116.4 million in income last year. That is a -$46.6 million decrease in income or 40% year over year decrease in income. While sales revenue only grew a mere $40 million more.That is very bad for a company that has $1.8 to $2.1 billion in debt to pay. So back down to 60 if not 57.

"Considering year over year EPS was suppose to be 88 cents, it did worse than last year's 86 cents. 76 cents is a 12 cents MISSED!"
"RPM at $55 looks a bit rich to me. The entire market is expensive, and I would be more comfortable buying RPM under $50.I believe that opportunity will present itself sometime in 2017?"
If you bought at $46-$49 then RPM is paying you with a dividend and appreciation...congrats!
"Mousheg, your an idiot to begin with. Of course this thing is being manipulated like crazy, it has been artificially held low for nearly one year while the rest of industrials were blowing up and now out of no where they start to climb like crazy with very minor positive news. I have bought and sold this multiple times and think they are a strong business, but given the past history why all of a sudden does this explode while the rest of industrials are getting hammered supposedly because of trade fears."
"Men govern nothing with more difficulty than their tongues, and can moderate their desires more than their words."
23 yrs.....due for a split?
RPM at 52 week low is a steal...I like it at $50...I love it at $46...
RPM reached an all time high at 71.20
"Mousheg, by all rights the way that the markets are hitting companies that beat on earnings and revs, this should have dropped to 55, but for some odd reason it is responding positively, my guess is the stock is being fully manipulated. As quick as this stock has risen, it will be dropped."
Shares worth $50

"Big drops were caused by large block trades, two of them since open, one dropped the price by nearly two bucks, the other one by over a buck, probably traders selling back and forth."
"Over reaction today, great for long term buyers."
Disappointing that RPM is the only one of my investments that has yet to issue their tax docs. Just sort of makes you wonder about how deep the issues run with this co.

"I have been a bit disappointed by how RPM has reacted to tax reform, the overall acceleration of industrial sector and the earnings report coming out early next year which should be very positive with hurricane remediation work. I definitely want to hold through earnings. Any thoughts why we haven't seen the bump like many of the industrials? Do people question whether we will get any infra-structure spending now. I would assume with the train accident in Washington that infra-structure will get a lot more visibility."
Whatever happened to that consulting company that was supposed tohelp them manage their business?Anyone know?
"Received my copy of RPM's 2017 Annual Report yesterday. The huge drop in the Consumer Products Segment EBIT, from $268 million in 2016 to $59 million in 2017, would seem merit a fuller discussion by the Chairman and CEO in his letter to shareholders. Mr. Sullivan remarked on the 78% drop in segment EBIT as follows: ""Excluding the Kicker goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter and a severance charge of $4.3 million in the second quarter, as well as the Kicker earnout reversal last year, consumer EBIT decreased 0.8% to $251.6 million from $253.7 million a year ago.""When Kicker was acquired in 2012, they were reported as having sales exceeding $100 million per year. This ""goodwill impairment charge and earnout reversal"" must have approached $200 million. Kicker makes ""finger nail coatings"" for gosh sakes. Why was this level of goodwill booked at the time of acquisition? Did RPM grossly overpay for this business? Is it profitable? How was this over-estimate possible? Please help us understand. Let's have some Buffet-like remarks--- if it was a crummy decision, let's hear that and let's hear how this specific business is doing today. What's our plan? Did we put a for sale sign in the front yard?RPM is justifiably very proud of its dividend record, but this mistake left our dividend payout ratio at 86%.This goodwill impairment was likely discussed in the second quarter release, but it merits further and fuller disclosure and discussion by the Chairman/CEO."

"Pages 42 and 43 in the 2017 Annual Report discuss the Kicker impairment assessment. It may be difficult to summarize this $141 million hit, but to quote the report ""no goodwill remained on the Kicker balance sheet as of November 30, 2016.""

"A 10% dividend increase to $.35 is a big surprise. I was expecting a raise from $.32 to $.34... It makes a difference when you own a ton of shares....RPM International Inc. (RPM) today announced at its annual meeting of stockholders that its board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share, payable on October 31, 2018, to stockholders of record as of October 16, 2018. This payment represents a 9.4 percent increase over the $0.32 quarterly cash dividend paid at this time last year.This action marks RPM’s 45th consecutive year of increased cash dividends paid to its stockholders, which places RPM in an elite category of less than half of 1 percent of all publicly traded U.S. companies. Only 41 other companies, besides RPM, have consecutively paid an increasing annual dividend for this period of time or longer, according to the Mergent Handbook of Dividend Achievers."
"RPM at $52 now... The ""easy money"" has been made...."
SEC investigating accounting practices? CEO is adamant they will find nothing.This should be interesting.It would surprise me if a firm like RPM was cooking the books…Their earnings have been pretty steady over the years...

I would think that with all the bad weather events that this company would be overwhelmed with business. Why isn’t it?
Wow! Fif anyone see this coming? Any thoughts as to what it may mean down the road in tersm of capital expoenditure or M&A? Thx.
Hammer is getting ready to drop on RPM the next earnings announcement.
"Really? A three dollar drop from the opening. Is the CEO claiming that he is the Anti-Christ or something. They beat on earnings, they beat on revenues, they gave good guidance and they are in a sector which will only benefit hugely from the rebuilding of Florida, Texas, PR, and Mexico City. How can the price be so manipulated so quickly, is it big money realizing that they need to get a better entry point??"
Glad I dumped at $60. This stock is a dog. Even Elliot Management can't fix the issues. Sell...
some companies are run by incompetent mgrs...

"First Quarter ResultsThe company’s industrial segment net sales increased 8.0%, to $729.8 million from $675.8 million reported a year ago, with 3.2% in organic growth, while acquisitions added 4.3%. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.5%. Industrial segment EBIT increased 0.4% to $91.5 million from $91.1 million in the fiscal 2017 first quarter.“Our industrial segment results reflect a combination of higher raw material costs, unfavorable product mix, higher distribution expense and disappointing results from a struggling Latin America. Our European and Canadian businesses performed very well in the quarter. North American commercial construction markets, which have bolstered the industrial segment’s performance over the past several years, have become a bit choppy, with some areas performing well and others showing weakness. Our businesses serving the oil and gas industries were down in the mid-single digits, compared to double-digit declines over the past three years. We expect sales at those businesses to turn positive in the second half of this fiscal year,” stated Sullivan."

Buy cheap and buy quality and DRIP and don’t sell unless you see it turn bad. I’ve done that over 50 years. The problem is you have to pay a lot of tax if you sell and get too old to enjoy fun things money will buy.

Maybe, we get that chance to buy under $45 only to see the equity rebound to $55-$60 later in 2017?I will be patient waiting for the chance to add at a lower price."
