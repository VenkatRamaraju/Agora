Look for an Earnings beat
Add at $130
ugly day(s) coming.
made 6.22% for the year.... sell this dog and buy WM ... the div. is 1.78 and it made 23% for the yr.... 6.22% blows period.
Look at the Debt with rising Interest rates and competition from overseas products this American Icon is not going to go well
Wow even a large dividend increase and buyback announcement isn't enough to push this stock forward today. How low do we go?
ITW is down 6.07% to 128.06
I read the first page of comments and nobody mentioned the dividend. Dividend Aristocrat.
Buy time? $136 looks like a good entry point.
I love this company!
well done ITW!
with so many patents is there something that will make the news anyone know.
"Anybody else wonder who the analyst is who has a 95 dollar target and probably also the annual earnings target of 5.28? They earned 1.90 in Q1, which has historically been their worst quarter, even the high estimate is only in the 7.50 range, if they merely equal the Q1 results each of the next three quarters, the highest estimate will pale in comparison, and the lowest estimate will be blown away by Q3. Who are these analysts, are they just praying that the economy explodes? Is this a political battle being waged at Wall Street, those who believe that our economy will explode as all of the current numbers indicate and those who are holding to their belief that since Hillary lost, so is the country. Sorry to tell you guys and gals, but the economy is doing great and so is ITW."
Sell Short now
i'm thinking to sell 100 shares of Apple and purchasing 100 shares of ITW. thoughts about this move?
ITW reached a 52 Week high at 165.29

Anyone thinking 140 in next few weeks .... :)
ITW reached a new 52 Week Low at $133.09

ITW reached an all time high at 184.55
Seems stupid cheap.
"i got out at 120 , after seeing president of company sell his million dollars worth, of course that was just part of his holdings.tired of the big swings in price, might get back in after the election, I think it could go lowerbut after hitting this low today I would guess it will jump up tomorrow at least a dollar or more"
"Besides Goldman Sachs, no one even comes close to Morgan Stanley as the most corrupt financial house out there. Even with their neutral rating they still gave it a 146 Target Price."
"some profit taking has dropped the share price, and headwinds from the strong dollar will put pressure on ITW. In it for the long haul!"
ITW reached a 52 Week low at 122.64
added more ITW today. Hoping estimates on Friday are above expectations.
What's up?
Another new high today at 120+!Warren - See my posts below when the stock was 102 and 114. I am a very long term holder. i have not sold a share and don't expect to for a long time.
screaming buy this is a great company
Illinois Tool Works reached an all time high at 197.94
So much negativity built in. This is liable to get bump tomorrow following earnings. Dividend will help cushion this blue chip. Talk of 90s for this is highly dubious.
How do I find out ETF or Mutual Funds that invest in ITW?
"Actually any bump from Harvey and Irma will be a long bump, it takes months to create machine orders, specifying equipment, RFQs, FATs/SATs, PPAPs, etc.. It will take at least a full year to two years for orders booked today to see final payment, so the impact will be long term. Apparently, don't really understand the machining business do you? Maybe some of their residential divisions will see short term bumps, but those will be muted compared to the industrial markets."
does anyone think this is a good entry point for ITW?
ShaggyI'm waiting until the end of April to see what Apple will do. I'm still hot to buy ITW. I think it is a great stock.
"Updates from SEC’s web, the whole year performance of ITW was issued today. Note that the reported earnings and cash flows are two different concepts. People call the distinction ""accruals"", which stands for a firm’s prediction of unrealized benefits. see http://www.financial-education-hub.com/1/ITW. While, there could be prediction errors due to unintentional mistakes or deliberate distortion, causing weak realization of accruals. According to this intuition, for firms reporting the same earnings in 2019, those with high accruals are more likely to deliver poorer future performance."

Simple stupidity. That is all I can say.
ITW is up 7.28% to 150.63
"Longs if you want to preserve your money sell, I am buying in but only after the drop and that hasn't come yet."
"How will they tank the markets tomorrow? Heck anymore they don't even need to fabricate a storyline. They just start a selling frenzy and let it go on its own. Usually they have to create some kind of false narrative such as trade wars, higher inflationary pressures, higher wages, etc., etc. yet every earnings report we see, the numbers are pretty decent."
"On 2/05 Bank of America downgraded ITW ($135 s/p), anyone who listened to them lost out on $13/share gain."
"This is primarily day trader action trying to create a quick price swing, the volumes are high but not high enough to justify any capitulation by any of the funds or long term holds."
Fut down 16%........... So bad ?
"New high @ 237+! Toot, toot!"
"ITW upsized share buyback by 50% this quarter, even as share price tanks on ""trim to outlook on FX.""Conveniently, they can start buying back shares starting tomorrow.2Q18 earnings release: ""The company now expects to repurchase $1.5 billion of its own shares in 2018."""
"It was $10 sometime back, time to go back to $10"
Love this Company
"Buy today 10 minutes before closing and sell tomorrow morning. This is going to go for a good jump, but it’s not going to stay like that."
"ITW the best tools, right after my own tool."
"long term hold, should see an announcement here any day about the div raise"
Sell before it is too late.. going under 90 by tomorrow
New all-time @ 233 pre-market!
"Important for ITW to break out from the $145 range, and hold a higher high. That will lead to some price recovery to $160's this year. imho..."

Every stock message board has that one village idiot. For ITW’s message board I present to you: Satnam.
New all-time high today @ 210+. One of my largest holdings. Where is everyone?
"Remarkable results in the 2Q, very impressive management in a terrible environment."
"Q4 results confirm once again, how powerful the ITW business model is, and the great discipline of the management and employees!"

"When company buy own shares to manipulate crash, that is the time sell and run"
You just bought part of $8 Billion DEBT
When is Buffett going to by this?
"robby_roadkill, he is the village idiot on a LOT of message boards to include FAST, COHR and SONC that I can think of off of the top of my head. Surprised we didn't see better climb after the dividend increase and buy out increases."
ITW reached a new 52 Week Low at $120.75
"ITW should benefit substantially from the new tax bill. With it's diverse portfolio of products, I would think earnings/sales will go up when companies use the money savings on growing their companies in the States. I believe ITW will go up even more if an Infrastructure Bill is passed due to it's welding & fastener products. I hope more investors look at the potential of owning this stock as I have."
ITW reached an all time high at 185.35
Itw bad

ITW is up 4.96% to 147.15
Illinois Tool Works is up 4.95% to 177.22
We are down $11 since 9/21. Wow!! Guess new lows are coming!
"Surprised this is only down 1% after than awful earnings report - slashed guidance, missed everything, lower demand"
I added a little more shares at the open. Rev were very good!
"Four months ago I posted when ITW hit 102. Now we are 114. These guys are really on top of it, selling off below average earning divisions and expanding the good stuff. The quarter was excellent. Hang tight."
ITW is down 7.29% to 146.89
The cramer curse - has CEO on show last night and stock is down today.
"Company spent all money on buying their own shares, sell short"
ITW is up 4.96% to 156.62
"I would be worried about how the stock will fair today but since there was only one mega millions winner today and that was in South Carolina where I live that must mean I am now worth 1.6 billion dollars so I must go up to the company where I work and talk to the CEO about buying them out, so good luck to everyone else."
ITW reached a 52 Week low at 130.01
This is destined to go 125 but somehow manipulators are keeping it float. No way it is destined to go down
This CEO is egregiously overpaid. Stock drops from 179.00 and he takes home a huge amount of $’s. That suggests that the broad is incompetent relative to protecting the stockholders.
Sell Short this junk
Illinois Tool Works is down 7.29% to 146.89
HERE we go CRASH
This stock is awesome.
Illinois Tool Works is discontinuing its quarterly sales and earnings guidance. Going forward the company will offer only annual EPS and organic sales forecasts.
Why did ITW plummet after hours today. There's got to be a reason for a 2.35% drop!
does the trade war has effect on this stock?
ITW is down 6.08% to 133.14
ITW is down 7.32% to 139.48
"Too late to get in? I have been wanting to get in this stock every since it was $85. I know today is the ex dividend. Is it expensive here or do you see more upside? Was hoping for $110-112, but I'm begging to think were on our way to $125."
Names like this are what I want to be in when rates are rising. Have had a nice gain over the last few weeks.
"SELL BEFORE TOO LATE, it will make 52 week low each day now"
"Ni, yes it is all rigged. Forex impact is always a wild card, what is very unusual is that they even mentioned it, makes me think the insiders were trying to dump the price to create a buying opportunity for themselves."
"Does anyone seriously believe that ITW won't blow earnings out of the water? One only has to look at Fastenal's returns to get an idea of how a tremendously run industrial company will perform in the new low tax, low regulation economy. Furthermore, they will be no negative impact based on trade issues. Easy quarter to blow the doors off."
"Shoes, did you make the move?? If so, you are up 6% on your investment with ITW while you would be down 2.5% if you held your Apple position. Industrials provide a definite diversity to the techs."
going to run hard and long
A nice buying opportunity is presenting itself!
Stubborn resistance at 145
"Oscar, you had better buy before the lunch hour ends and you will be able to sell for at least a three to four dollar gain by close, and no the stock will only go up from here. The analysts will start pumping industrials now that they have beaten them up for nearly three months now because of ""trade concerns""."
Pretty heavy profit taking on ITW
$5 Stock Now
"Well they did get the kiss of death, Morgan Stanley decided to start following them, otherwise I would agree that it is a major buy here. The only reason that MS ever follows a stock is to trash it so they can drop the price of the stock to allow for great entry buys for their clients."

"120k's worth of my holding value gone in 3 month. People are calling it a buy opportunity. Not for me, for me it's crying opportunity."
"To the moon Ralphie, to the moon."
"Shoes, apparently you are wise beyond your years, waiting until the end of April may be the best thing for all stocks right now. I think once the fake news about a trade war disappears this will be a raging buy at whatever price it finally settles at."
Any dividend news?
Up large today on the tariff delay. ITW will go bombing to a new all-time when the Trump nonsense is over.

Illinois Tool Works is up 5.01% to 162.26
Why do they have high FCF low dividend and high debt?
What happend after hours????
"WAS hoping for a split , but don't see much upside to that if all it does it split the price as well a split would be great if i was going to hold it a long time."
"The news of ITW industry outlook in 2019 & 2020... ""7-10% earnings growth"" IMO, gives some industrials a forward P/E of 14 to 20 next year. Thoughts???"
Here we go $25
I'm not worried at all. This is a fantastic company.

"Shocking drop in ITW, the fundamentals will certainly be hurt: Automotive down, Welding down, Food Equipment group down, and the kick in the #$%$ from a strong dollar.This corona virus hit is broad and deep. ITW is a great company, great management. What to do? Major stock buyback? no question...."
"Firstly, this volatility is expected. Don’t forget that this is like a biotechs and tech stocks their infancy stages. I’ve seen and swings like this many-a-time.I bought $RHT when it was trading around $55, and watched it drop and stay in the $40s range, the same with $SQ, $WVE, $MXIM, $ITW, $ALKS... Keep in mind that aside from the shorts, there are investors who bought some of their $CGC shares on Margin. And I’m fairly certain the latter has something to do with the selling."
"This stock is GOING DOWN! Cheaper commercial kitchen equipment is pouring into the country from India and China, the boom in rental commercial cooking space that will fuel Uber eats and other new wave food services would have carried this stock to the moon but sadly Hobart, Vulcan, Etc are not garnering the sales the cheaper stuff is from overseas. Short this stock to 89."

Gentlemen: Why did the CEO sell 8.5 million shares. Is this a message to the small investor to unload their shares as the insider sure knows more than us small investtor
Illinois Tool Works is up 5.12% to 220.14
"Sorry you guys can't just laugh at the current situation. If you really thought that what ever ITW posted that they would let the stock go up. This stock as well as the entire market is so manipulated as the billionaire's club is in full force to tank Wall Street prior to the mid-term elections, in a desperate attempt to create the blue wave, and yet they will drive prices down only to drive them back up again, meanwhile profiting off of both directions. If you can't beat them at the game you may as well laugh at it. After the elections everything will go back to normal and the price of this will go back up to the 140s. Take a chill pill."
"I bought a position today, hopefully a good long term investment. Well run Fortune 500 company with strong financials."
Nice reaction to the earnings announcement. well done.
"This could get interesting, really didn't expect a miss though the analysts were a bit aggressive, still thought we had one more beat in the tank. May get hit at open but will recover, may take a big hit at open to create buying opportunities, looks like you called it right Stockguru, congrats."
