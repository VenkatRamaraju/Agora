ITW reached a new All Time High at 175.56
So much negativity built in. This is liable to get bump tomorrow following earnings. Dividend will help cushion this blue chip. Talk of 90s for this is highly dubious.
"Shoes, did you make the move?? If so, you are up 6% on your investment with ITW while you would be down 2.5% if you held your Apple position. Industrials provide a definite diversity to the techs."
This CEO is egregiously overpaid. Stock drops from 179.00 and he takes home a huge amount of $’s. That suggests that the broad is incompetent relative to protecting the stockholders.
This stock is awesome.
i am here want some details about this stock
"Firstly, this volatility is expected. Don’t forget that this is like a biotechs and tech stocks their infancy stages. I’ve seen and swings like this many-a-time.I bought $RHT when it was trading around $55, and watched it drop and stay in the $40s range, the same with $SQ, $WVE, $MXIM, $ITW, $ALKS... Keep in mind that aside from the shorts, there are investors who bought some of their $CGC shares on Margin. And I’m fairly certain the latter has something to do with the selling."
You just bought part of $8 Billion DEBT
"ITW should benefit substantially from the new tax bill. With it's diverse portfolio of products, I would think earnings/sales will go up when companies use the money savings on growing their companies in the States. I believe ITW will go up even more if an Infrastructure Bill is passed due to it's welding & fastener products. I hope more investors look at the potential of owning this stock as I have."
Here we go $25
"It will be good if the lunch time dump doesn't break the price below the morning low, if that happens this will recover to the 140 range by day's end."
does the trade war has effect on this stock?

ITW is down -5.00% to 144.03
ITW reached a new 52 Week Low at $131.54
Fut down 16%........... So bad ?
This is setting up just like RPM and FAST who have already given good guidance numbers and both saw double digit jumps.
"Important for ITW to break out from the $145 range, and hold a higher high. That will lead to some price recovery to $160's this year. imho..."
Illinois Tool Works is down 8.13% to 150.76
ITW reached a 52 Week high at 175.49

"I, governor Pritzker, Salute you!"
Wow even a large dividend increase and buyback announcement isn't enough to push this stock forward today. How low do we go?
"Remarkable results in the 2Q, very impressive management in a terrible environment."
Congratulations to ITW management team on the outstanding results. Great management matters. Go longs!
Any dividend news?
Sell Short now
"WAS hoping for a split , but don't see much upside to that if all it does it split the price as well a split would be great if i was going to hold it a long time."
"Sorry you guys can't just laugh at the current situation. If you really thought that what ever ITW posted that they would let the stock go up. This stock as well as the entire market is so manipulated as the billionaire's club is in full force to tank Wall Street prior to the mid-term elections, in a desperate attempt to create the blue wave, and yet they will drive prices down only to drive them back up again, meanwhile profiting off of both directions. If you can't beat them at the game you may as well laugh at it. After the elections everything will go back to normal and the price of this will go back up to the 140s. Take a chill pill."
Go ITW!!!!! been doing great things for years and will for years to come!!!
"i got out at 120 , after seeing president of company sell his million dollars worth, of course that was just part of his holdings.tired of the big swings in price, might get back in after the election, I think it could go lowerbut after hitting this low today I would guess it will jump up tomorrow at least a dollar or more"
Will this stock ever go up lol
"Shocking drop in ITW, the fundamentals will certainly be hurt: Automotive down, Welding down, Food Equipment group down, and the kick in the #$%$ from a strong dollar.This corona virus hit is broad and deep. ITW is a great company, great management. What to do? Major stock buyback? no question...."
Up large today on the tariff delay. ITW will go bombing to a new all-time when the Trump nonsense is over.
"Well they did get the kiss of death, Morgan Stanley decided to start following them, otherwise I would agree that it is a major buy here. The only reason that MS ever follows a stock is to trash it so they can drop the price of the stock to allow for great entry buys for their clients."
ITW is down 5.01% to $132.45
Illinois Tool Works is up 4.95% to 177.22
Why do they have high FCF low dividend and high debt?
"This could get interesting, really didn't expect a miss though the analysts were a bit aggressive, still thought we had one more beat in the tank. May get hit at open but will recover, may take a big hit at open to create buying opportunities, looks like you called it right Stockguru, congrats."
Nice reaction to the earnings announcement. well done.
ugly day(s) coming.
Sell before too late ...going under $50
added more ITW today. Hoping estimates on Friday are above expectations.
Sell before it is too late.. going under 90 by tomorrow
"I would be worried about how the stock will fair today but since there was only one mega millions winner today and that was in South Carolina where I live that must mean I am now worth 1.6 billion dollars so I must go up to the company where I work and talk to the CEO about buying them out, so good luck to everyone else."

Love this Company
ShaggyI'm waiting until the end of April to see what Apple will do. I'm still hot to buy ITW. I think it is a great stock.

"Oscar, you had better buy before the lunch hour ends and you will be able to sell for at least a three to four dollar gain by close, and no the stock will only go up from here. The analysts will start pumping industrials now that they have beaten them up for nearly three months now because of ""trade concerns""."
"Q4 results confirm once again, how powerful the ITW business model is, and the great discipline of the management and employees!"
"On 2/05 Bank of America downgraded ITW ($135 s/p), anyone who listened to them lost out on $13/share gain."
"Drive that price down baby, once earnings are announced this thing will jump 15 to 20%."
"Too late to get in? I have been wanting to get in this stock every since it was $85. I know today is the ex dividend. Is it expensive here or do you see more upside? Was hoping for $110-112, but I'm begging to think were on our way to $125."
with so many patents is there something that will make the news anyone know.
"This is primarily day trader action trying to create a quick price swing, the volumes are high but not high enough to justify any capitulation by any of the funds or long term holds."
Illinois Tool Works is discontinuing its quarterly sales and earnings guidance. Going forward the company will offer only annual EPS and organic sales forecasts.
Another new high today at 120+!Warren - See my posts below when the stock was 102 and 114. I am a very long term holder. i have not sold a share and don't expect to for a long time.

"robby_roadkill, he is the village idiot on a LOT of message boards to include FAST, COHR and SONC that I can think of off of the top of my head. Surprised we didn't see better climb after the dividend increase and buy out increases."

"Shoes, apparently you are wise beyond your years, waiting until the end of April may be the best thing for all stocks right now. I think once the fake news about a trade war disappears this will be a raging buy at whatever price it finally settles at."
Buy time? $136 looks like a good entry point.
"Ni, yes it is all rigged. Forex impact is always a wild card, what is very unusual is that they even mentioned it, makes me think the insiders were trying to dump the price to create a buying opportunity for themselves."
"Company spent all money on buying their own shares, sell short"

"long term hold, should see an announcement here any day about the div raise"
Illinois Tool Works is up 5.12% to 220.14
"Actually any bump from Harvey and Irma will be a long bump, it takes months to create machine orders, specifying equipment, RFQs, FATs/SATs, PPAPs, etc.. It will take at least a full year to two years for orders booked today to see final payment, so the impact will be long term. Apparently, don't really understand the machining business do you? Maybe some of their residential divisions will see short term bumps, but those will be muted compared to the industrial markets."
When is Buffett going to by this?
I love this stock!
"The news of ITW industry outlook in 2019 & 2020... ""7-10% earnings growth"" IMO, gives some industrials a forward P/E of 14 to 20 next year. Thoughts???"
"This stock is GOING DOWN! Cheaper commercial kitchen equipment is pouring into the country from India and China, the boom in rental commercial cooking space that will fuel Uber eats and other new wave food services would have carried this stock to the moon but sadly Hobart, Vulcan, Etc are not garnering the sales the cheaper stuff is from overseas. Short this stock to 89."
"Does anyone seriously believe that ITW won't blow earnings out of the water? One only has to look at Fastenal's returns to get an idea of how a tremendously run industrial company will perform in the new low tax, low regulation economy. Furthermore, they will be no negative impact based on trade issues. Easy quarter to blow the doors off."
"Some brilliant ""investor"" paid 244.88 at 7:01 this morning. Yow!"

"How will they tank the markets tomorrow? Heck anymore they don't even need to fabricate a storyline. They just start a selling frenzy and let it go on its own. Usually they have to create some kind of false narrative such as trade wars, higher inflationary pressures, higher wages, etc., etc. yet every earnings report we see, the numbers are pretty decent."
"ITW upsized share buyback by 50% this quarter, even as share price tanks on ""trim to outlook on FX.""Conveniently, they can start buying back shares starting tomorrow.2Q18 earnings release: ""The company now expects to repurchase $1.5 billion of its own shares in 2018."""
"Buy today 10 minutes before closing and sell tomorrow morning. This is going to go for a good jump, but it’s not going to stay like that."

"I bought a position today, hopefully a good long term investment. Well run Fortune 500 company with strong financials."
"The issue here is they self finance much of their sales. If the economy slows, it is a double hit to the company. Extra volatility ahead."

"Anybody else wonder who the analyst is who has a 95 dollar target and probably also the annual earnings target of 5.28? They earned 1.90 in Q1, which has historically been their worst quarter, even the high estimate is only in the 7.50 range, if they merely equal the Q1 results each of the next three quarters, the highest estimate will pale in comparison, and the lowest estimate will be blown away by Q3. Who are these analysts, are they just praying that the economy explodes? Is this a political battle being waged at Wall Street, those who believe that our economy will explode as all of the current numbers indicate and those who are holding to their belief that since Hillary lost, so is the country. Sorry to tell you guys and gals, but the economy is doing great and so is ITW."
Every stock message board has that one village idiot. For ITW’s message board I present to you: Satnam.
"Updates from SEC’s web, the whole year performance of ITW was issued today. Note that the reported earnings and cash flows are two different concepts. People call the distinction ""accruals"", which stands for a firm’s prediction of unrealized benefits. see http://www.financial-education-hub.com/1/ITW. While, there could be prediction errors due to unintentional mistakes or deliberate distortion, causing weak realization of accruals. According to this intuition, for firms reporting the same earnings in 2019, those with high accruals are more likely to deliver poorer future performance."
New all-time @ 233 pre-market!

Stubborn resistance at 145

Gentlemen: Why did the CEO sell 8.5 million shares. Is this a message to the small investor to unload their shares as the insider sure knows more than us small investtor
"To the moon Ralphie, to the moon."
Close under $90 today
"Longs if you want to preserve your money sell, I am buying in but only after the drop and that hasn't come yet."
This is destined to go 125 but somehow manipulators are keeping it float. No way it is destined to go down
