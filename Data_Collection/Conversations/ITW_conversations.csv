screaming buy this is a great company
"Important for ITW to break out from the $145 range, and hold a higher high. That will lead to some price recovery to $160's this year. imho..."
I love this company!
Nice reaction to the earnings announcement. well done.
Buy time? $136 looks like a good entry point.
Illinois Tool Works is discontinuing its quarterly sales and earnings guidance. Going forward the company will offer only annual EPS and organic sales forecasts.
"On 2/05 Bank of America downgraded ITW ($135 s/p), anyone who listened to them lost out on $13/share gain."
"Remarkable results in the 2Q, very impressive management in a terrible environment."
"I bought a position today, hopefully a good long term investment. Well run Fortune 500 company with strong financials."
i'm thinking to sell 100 shares of Apple and purchasing 100 shares of ITW. thoughts about this move?
long term hold for 275 in 2 years than a 4-1 stock split
"ITW upsized share buyback by 50% this quarter, even as share price tanks on ""trim to outlook on FX.""Conveniently, they can start buying back shares starting tomorrow.2Q18 earnings release: ""The company now expects to repurchase $1.5 billion of its own shares in 2018."""
"The news of ITW industry outlook in 2019 & 2020... ""7-10% earnings growth"" IMO, gives some industrials a forward P/E of 14 to 20 next year. Thoughts???"
When is Buffett going to by this?
"Great quarter, ITW!"
Wow even a large dividend increase and buyback announcement isn't enough to push this stock forward today. How low do we go?
Illinois Tool Works reached an all time high at 205.31
"Did they raise the dividend, does anyone know when they will raise?"
I'm not worried at all. This is a fantastic company.
New all-time high today @ 210+. One of my largest holdings. Where is everyone?
