Arrow Financial reached a 52 Week low at 24.51
AROW is up 5.59% to $34.35
"Last 2 quarters AROW earned over 80 cents in each of them. In comparison, they pay a measly $1.01 per year in dividends. Isn't it WAY past time AROW increases the dividend substantially? Thoughts?"
how many airbnb mortgages are held ? Since the properties are empty.
AROW reached a new 52 Week High at 39.50
AROW is up 4.96% to $32.80
Not too many visitors here. Seems weird folks don't really appreciate the extra 2% stock dividend each year like clockwork?
"Colin Read , Director of Arrow is creating a HUGE Liability since he is MAYOR of PLATTSBURGH NY.There were 2 branches of Glens Falls Bank in PLattsburgh.When Mr. Read ran for MAYOR he was ALREADY On the board of ARROW.HE NEVER, in any campaign literature said he is a DIRECTOR of ARROW.Since he has become MAYOR , the Bank has closed 2 branches inside the city Director Read is Mayor.Opening 1 newer, much smaller branch.As well, the CITY purchased the property of 1 location to tear it down and turn it into a parking lot.The City is using STATE MONEY via DRI grant of $10 million to do this.The Glens Falls property the CITY bought was said to be a ""deal"" But since purchase the property is rife with ASBESTOS. Once again, Director Colin Read, a Professor at SUNY PLATTSBURGH, A wine vineyard owner, and Mayoris neither MORAL nor ETHICAL in any matter.On top of the above, the MAYOR sees no issue with only 1 bid for the DRI project.Mayor Director READ has , in many actions as Mayor proven he is consumed by GREEDignoring his Fiduciary Duty to the Bank and The city of Plattsburgh constituents.He Should RESIGN IMMEDIATELY from either DIRECTOR or MAYOR.Hi Mayor position pays over $70k, his director Job over $55K.It appears ARROW is endorsing the Mayors actions by keeping him on the Board."
"Deals will happen each week now for the next several years period.New banks just cannot make any money, so the only way to grow will be buying older banks at fair prices. IBKC we sold all the move from $61 at the end of the year has been just too much to past up. Many small banks still way under book and many larger names have jumped back 15-20% in the past few weeks, this will lead to the biggest wave of deals since 2001.For those who are not adding huge capital at this time it will be a mistake.But right now, the game is going long- many small names, heavy, and just waiting, the same as we usually do. We are adding BTHT heavy under $11.00, MCPH heavy under $26, and ABBB heavy under $11.50, and QNTO under $12.00. “blackout periods creative great opportunities for good investors.”This is a great time, to go very long, small names.BankNewsletter.com"
Stock Dividend ... AROW usually declares ( if there will be one ) the stk div at the end of AUG.
gfn you could also throw in a special dividend now and then.
"Another 3% yearly dividend just declared...on top of the regular yield of 2.94%- amazing. Shocking that folks keep money ""in the bank"" rather than ""owning the bank""."
anyone picking up more shares?
How does this company justify not raising the dividend to reflect the rise in profits???

The churn of accounts is HUGE because ARROW can't match online banks synchrony nor CIT on rates. Why bother putting money with Arrow when much bigger banks pay far higher rates.LOCALLY NBT is a far better bank vs. Arrow.
