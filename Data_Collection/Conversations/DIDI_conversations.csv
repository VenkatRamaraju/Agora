Here's to hoping Kelly is OK today!
Easy $10 today
3.5 days to cover based on average volume..
"Wish you guys can READ this. Basically an insider stated that CCP did NOT find any evidence of security issue. They were mostly questioning ""Why/What/How"" they made the decision of going IPO in USAhttps://m.mingpao.com/pns/%E7%B6%93%E6%BF%9F/article/20211022/s00004/1634839841787/%E6%BB%B4%E6%BB%B4%E7%AD%893%E4%B8%AD%E6%A6%82%E8%82%A1-%E8%A2%AB%E6%8C%87%E9%81%AD%E5%8B%92%E4%BB%A4%E5%9B%9E%E6%B8%AF%E4%B8%8A%E5%B8%82-%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90%E6%96%99%E6%88%96%E6%B8%9B%E7%9B%A3%E7%AE%A1%E5%A3%93%E5%8A%9B-%E8%82%A1%E5%83%B9%E6%97%A9%E6%AE%B5%E5%81%9A%E5%A5%BD"
"Just buy Didi already, with the company currently sidelined you won’t have to wait long for strong rebound"
"own a small position and not following too closely, can someone please update me what just happened?"
Im cautiously optimistic still i think it is easy 20
I like companies that can make money.
"Did you know that Didi founder is the princess of Lenovo, the computer company that bought out IBM PC Unit to beat Dell to become the world's largest PC computer, never mind Compaq or even Apple. Other Chinese companies that bought out its US competitors include: Ninebot vs Segway; WH Group vs Smithsfield; Dalian Wanda vs AMC (the US cinema chain); Haier vs GE Appliances; Tencent s Riot (League of Legends); HNA Group vs Ingram Micro; Lenovo s Motorola Mobility.By 2022 EOD, Didi will buy out Uber that never turn a profit. Didi is the world's largest ride-sharing company, with 400M riders, a number larger than USA population."
When is earning date?

Yep.. it’s about time.
"But... But... where is 10, 15 or 20?"
"UBS CEO Goes ""Full Bull On China"" Despite Regulatory Crackdowns"
"recruiter email: Didi hiring Data Scientist - Machine Learning，provide Sponsorship，Location: Mountain View, CAGood sign :)"
Temp short term profit taking but they will miss the bigger run. 10+ next week I predict
"So I decided not to take a loan against my house due to the risk..thanks to all who commented..BTW, i do have a tent just in case LOL"
Harsh. Watch us rise 20% tomorrow or Thursday
"Just added 500 shares of DIDI, Buy and Hold !"
maybe 10 dollar today? then 15 in a week?
"If truth be told, even the strongest bulls on this board wouldn't add another DIDI share at this level.Can't really blame them!"
Look at that volume! There's NO ONE HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!I almost thought it was halted!
Should I take out a loan against my house and load up on Didi? Serious comments please...
Last chance to get it below 12
Duel listing in US/HK is actually good news. Meaning the Chinese regulators will allow the app back on sooner or later.
Yum yum yummy day!
Didi needs to give an update
"What if the worst part of the government's removing Didi from Chinese app stores was not the loss of any new users (though that is very bad), but rather stopping new drivers registering to drive for Didi? It's been four months now. The turn over of drivers on the rideshare/gig-slave taxi companies is one time per year. How many drivers have they lost to the other 200 taxi companies in China?"
How someone bets against the biggest ride sharing company the world! Called DiDi
$20 dollar sooner!
"so it doesn't want to go up hah, well..go down then, keep going down and down and down."
DIDI is one best Chinese stock to buy and watch
Looks like Xi Ping himself booked a ride on DIDI now usong app.Means it has no where to go but in the teens in 15 and then adulthood 25 and at a very fast pace.
I will tell you all this.. DIDI is still a good buy. Anything under $14 is a great deal. IPO was above that price. Get in now or be left out. GLTA.
I will sell my 15755 shares at 325
Didi will be the comeback story all next year and into 2023.
Didi earns 30 billions dollar a year but only half the market cap of Lucid who makes ZERO.um...interesting.
Almost every adults who can ride a tax already have didi app in their phone. 0.4 billion people still using it on daily basis. Stop downloading for a short time isn’t really a big deal.
DIDI is only one best Chinese stock to buy and watch
"DIDI NEWS, launch on south africa/nigeriaLooking to edge out its competitors, Chinese behemoth Didi is currently expanding across the continent, stepping up competition for market leaders Uber and Estonia-based Bolt. Evidence shows it is preparing to enter Nigeria, having begun operations in South Africa in March and Egypt just last month when the company posted a job opening for a driver center manager in Lagos – the same role it first advertised for when entering South Africa and Egypt.A key indicator of the company’s imminent expansion into Nigeria was hidden within the lines of the driver center manager’s responsibilities – “to collaborate with operations and Didi’s team to support the successful launch.”"
DIDI is the next millionaire maker.Reminds me of the time the whole planet was spitting on SNAP when it was trading at $8
Shorts are playing with low volume -very soon good news then in $14 range on 100m volume day
I think we hear something next week..it's time
"Very strong volume and positive move the last few days and especially today. Perhaps it is the fact that Jack Ma reappeared publicly and traveled freely and government regulators are easing up on these companies perceived by the investing experts and public. Also, the US and Chinese governments probably figured out the inter dependence of the two economies and the need to cooperate instead of escalating tensions. Didi is the top dog in China and if not for these issues, I believe Didi would be easily double digits and past its ATH. Thoughts. God Bless and stay well."
"Beijing has completed Didi data security investigation and should be restoring App in the first 2 weeks of Nov, 2021. Longs better get a bigger money ready."
Trading like we should 100m+
DIDI looks like it is about to drop. Be careful guys. I have been reading http://the-alphatrader.com/ and their stocks have been doing way better.
"Look at @David trying so hard… Will those $9.00 puts print…? Keep up the good work, you’re the best "
has anyone not sold yet? you have to hold for it to go up. just saying
"$Didi, world's largest ride-sharing company with 400M riders n 50M drivers, will be buying 150,000 ET5/ET7. Europe RoboTaxis to standardize on ET7 and ES8. And of course NIO Swap will be proliferating all over Europe, starting with Norway, like Morning Glory seeded by the westerly and easterly wind. What is there to fault, zip."
Just wait for soon DiDi to be listed on Hong Kong at 15+
I started buying when Jimmy Z showed up on this board. It’s paying off big.
"There’s nothing wrong with Didi that can’t be fixed next week, by a few buyers with an IQ above 70, who know the true value in this."
Buying will start soon earnings should be 9th of November. If earnings is good don’t ask what will happen.
What is happening now? Is this going up to $16?
Didi train is not stopping! All the way to $20
Almost party time
This is easy $25 once app is up!
buy the dip
DIDI is back to the mean.
Preliminary investigation seems to not have found much in terms of wrong doing on Didi's part.... Authorities suggest a balanced listing for didi in US and HK.
As soon as the news breaks this little Jem becomes the diamond of success hold on and enjoy the ride
"I believe that DIDI will go up, but it seems that will happen only when a good news releases. Hope to hear it soon"
time to fill the gap between 12.4 and 14.1......
just spoke with the friend in Beijing who works for DiDi It department. what he told me absolutely mind blowing.. this is going to hit 40 or 50 soon who knows...
"BlackRock Inc. and UBS Group AG have turned positive on China’s beaten-down equities, citing investors’ growing comfort with Beijing’s crackdown and an improving earnings outlook."
Booooom!!! the hongkong listing would bring this back to 2 digits again..We have liftoff Goooo didi!!
"delisting possibly coming, becareful kids. China's cybersecurity watchdog suggested ride-hailing firm Didi Global Inc and two other U.S.-listed tech companies explore listings in Hong Kong, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter."
why is everyone selling. only one way in this stock and that's up up up
Any price under $10 take it it’s a gift
"Smart investors are making After-hours green, stockup up in ready for the surge. Remember, Didi is the world's largest ride-sharing global company, with 550M riders currently. Founder is the princess of Lenovo, world's largest PC manufacturer. Too big to fail, so safe to own."
Chance to buy cheap shares
I’m curious when @David starts his shift? I just wanted to wish you a good morning sir. Looking forward to hitting your comment quota again today! Good luck 
"Time to give DiDi it true value, this is a company that have over $160 Billions revenue. We should be trading above $20 by now!"
It's only a matter of time until DiDi returns to ipo price of 14.
The seventh stock on our list of the 10 best stocks under $20 according to British billionaire Chris Rokos is DiDi Global Inc.
I was sure we were going to be back and I was holding strong Go Didi !!
Didi ranks 7th on the top ten best stocks under $20. Insider Monkey ranking of hedge fund ownership. Yay
"above 50 day average, higher highs and higher lows. Just normal up and down. Technically still very good. Fundamentally at very low valuation. Very high short position as compared to float. CAC will be deciding path forward enabling the reinstatement of the app soon. This is going up. If not, today next week. If not next week, next month."
I have only 2100 shares is that enough or should I buy more???
Starbucks BIG miss . . . blames it on China Covid resurgence.Where is DIDI again?????
Didi will go private at $14-15
This means DIDI investigation is over! GOING UP!
Didi one year price target $25 but will be more Like $50+ twice as big as Uber and Lyft
Yes our dragon is
DIDI is one best Chinese stock to buy and watch Bullish
"Didi and baba can not be stopped , only move is up"
What will happen if DIDI listed in HONGKONG MARKET? DIDI IN USA MARKET “NO VALUE” ?
"Serious question for Longs . . . If this was such a mind blowing phenomenal investment opportunity, don't you think more institutions, and professional investors would be driving the price UP??? Are you really that much ""smarter"" than the rest of the investing community??I understand you think this is the mother of all get rich quick stocks, but come on people . . . use your head!"
Month of November is going to be momentous in DIDI returns.
"(Bloomberg) -- China’s top financial regulator said he expects to achieve significant progress in the ongoing crackdown on fintech firms before the year-end, reinforcing speculation that Beijing’s campaign to rein in its tech giants may be receding.Good news coming and this will rocket! Easy $25"
"If you believe Didi is severely oversold, thumbs up. Down for no."
Just wandering around with no serious buying or selling. News will move it up or down. Potential for a powerful explosive upwards move with app reinstatement news powered by very large short/float. I actually want shorts to bet more heavily. It will ensure the large up move. May happen anytime (hoping in the next couple of weeks). Good luck to all longs and shorts….
Didi will soar in value long before they’re available in Hong Kong.
They did not say the investigation is over! They said the regulatory suggests to list it in Hong Kong. It means they might announce news soon to confirm that the investigation is over. Then the stock will jump up by 50% in one day!
Buy and Hold !
Why this is $40 B ?
Up 300% in a any minutes is very possible!!
Be patient!! DIDI will be a huge moneymaker for those who hold and wait. Shorts will be squeezed out soon!
"Return to 14 not so far, just have patience."
"took a position this morning. Based on last week's reports and unusual call buying, this thing could liftoff any day now. happy to be on board! downside is capped. great risk reward trade imo"
I'm thinking we see $11.25 today
Strong close wow
$10 today?
"NIO, XPEV, LI... all companies are trading in Hong Kong, this is a huge boost!!! DIDI is much better than Uber+Lyft together"
"Think about the listing on Hong Kong at $15, which is the fair evaluation, and blessed by China regulars. Have some patience for 15 to 18, and that’s not far fetched!"
QS has never made a dime either and they are up 30% this week
I believe that there is more institutional buying going on .
didi is a great company like uber
10.5 tomorrow
