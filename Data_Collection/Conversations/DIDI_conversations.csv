Any one holding since IPO?
"no more pain , tomorrow it will go up to $9 , this company is bigger and larger than Uber 40 times"
Aspex Management HK Ltd bought 2Million Stocks ($28 Million worth with an average price @14)of DIDI in Q2. Check the Security filings.
HSI is up again. Lol.. shorties gonna get clobbered this week
"Understand something here. The Chinese government does not care how much money Softbank loses, or Uber loses, and they especially don't care how much you lose. If the US listed shares go to zero, it makes no difference to the Chinese regulators, why would it? They demand power and obedience, and they are willing to inflict lots of pain to keep it. Didi went public in NY after they were told not to. If the government fails to punish them severely, they will lose power and lose face. They won't do that. Think.Nothing else matters much with this company, not profits, not essentiality, and not foreign markets. Over the last 30 years, the Chinese have constantly changed the rules and blocked foreigners from owning businesses in China, (unless they wanted to take the technology).And what happens? Everyone forgets that and continues to invest in China, ""because it is too big to ignore""Well, there it is. Whatever the government does here, there will be no permanent damage to the greater investment environment."
Options are interestimg seems looking for price of 10 plus soon
"Xi is loading up on Didi before his press secretary release Didi App back on Huawei, Apple apps, and others. Insider trading in China is a tradition, but is lacking US Congress."
How much is a DIDI REALLY worth?
The 6's are definitely in play now. Just look at the chart.
"Trust me, just buy it!"
Adding to my position today. Feels like we're very close to some really positive news. UBER raise is also a good sign from an industry perspective. Easy double this year once the cloud is lifted.
Things might be about to get interesting.Didi IPO Lockup Expiration:2021.10.01. That date is also China National day. the Even if the app is not released Next week should see better volume/volatility. This 7 -9 range is mind numbing.
"The inspectors in charge of examining the institutions will ""thoroughly search for any political deviations."" China will probe state banks' lending to faltering developer Evergrande struggling with over $300 billion in liabilities and lending to Jack Ma's beleaguered fintech Ant Group and ride-hailing firm undergoing cybersecurity probe DiDi."
i thought a pain went away but will come again
Since the CCP tech breakdown started every week a new rumor comes up from Reuters etc with a rumor to drive people sell cheap and every time the company denies it. Big funds are loading.
"DIDI close over $10 tomorrow, Asian stocks rocking tonight."
I wouldn't touch this stock with a 10 foot pole!
Buy DIDI asap and Hold !
Bought more Didi this morning. Why would anyone sell now?!
"It seems soon Didi Global's shares price may climb to the IPO mark. Market capital is steadily growing. At present, there is no wide fluctuation in share price for the short-selling!"
When I sell my didi $30 I am getting free Chinese massage 3 times a week for life paid by didi profit with happy face
"HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Didi Global Inc (DIDI.N) co-founder and President Jean Liu has told some close associates that she intends to step down, two sources familiar with the matter said, as the Chinese ride-hailing giant faces intense regulatory scrutiny following its New York listing earlier this year.Liu, 43, has in recent weeks told some associates that she expected the government to eventually take control of Didi and appoint new management, said the two sources.Liu, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) banker, told a couple of executives close to her in recent weeks - including those who had followed her to join Didi from the Wall Street bank - that she planned to leave and encouraged them to start looking for new opportunities as well, said one of the sources who was briefed on the matter."
DiDi average daily rides of 30M is almost twice if Uber and Lyft combined. Wait until it gets unleashed!!!
this stock reminded me of NIO... buy only long term if you can!
The slow move up will very soon be transitioning to momentum. Near-term target is $12. That's the price Softbank bought in back in May 2020. Stock is worth over $20+ once the dust settles with China.
how come DiDi is not profitable with all these users?
"DiDi business is starting up again. Dropped off more bikes in Yucheng City. New hiring ads in Nigeria, Egypt..."
Could be delisted from NYSE according to news.
What percentage of DiDi stocks are being held by American financial institutions? Does anyone have idea?
"Any stock you buy is gamble, buying DIDI is like a jackpot you can win big this dice has all 6 except one square is one take the risk accumulate at this price"
"Didi co-founder kicked out by Chinese government. She was from Harvard and is the princess of Lenovo founder. With that out of the way, Didi apps will soon be back live and its usa IPO paused will resume, starting at $18 and settling at $28 after a month of frenzy buying. Eventually, it will hit $500 at least given its global dominance, certainly in China 1.4B world largest car market and largest EV market. Didi will then buyout money losing Uber and Didi ticker will be around $1,500 before stock split. Put on your seat belt, lay flat on your back for extreme ""g"" to the stratosphere."
"Nice close in the blood bath market today , only Didi and baba held up ,,"
"Buy DIDI and hold it guys. There is not much downside at this point. DIDI will not close and shut down. CCP will make some recommendations and DIDI has committed to live up to those recommendations. They are actively fixing the concerns and once that is done, DIDI app will be online. This is the time to buy when everyone is fearful. Buy and hold. This is easy $40 stock."
"Once Didi turns profitable, which will happen this year, the price will go up substantially (just like Uber did)."
With Winter Olympics in China this February 4 2022.. There are four months to go and China more likely Didi will fly high again !!
This is $40 stock once app is up!
oversold and undervalued
"Didi has 400M riders despite Apps not available to new users. People are borrowing phones from neighbors to use those Didi apps for rides. 400M? Wow, that's larger than entire usa population on the move everyday, via didi."
"Didi app is running fine for 400M Chinese users, just no new subscribers because app is banned for now. So, Didi is still the largest ride-sharing corp in China and when apps is back, the largest in the world, buying out Uber."
"Estimated timeline of the investigation : Under China’s Cybersecurity Review Measures, a regulation jointly issued by 12 ministerial bodies last year, a “normal” investigation should take up to 60 working days. The conclusion of this review shall be enacted within 30 days, but can be extended by another 15 days “if the situation is complicated”. Related authorities shall be informed of the conclusion, and these authorities must provide their views within 15 working days.Link to the article https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3151968/chinas-probe-didi-aimed-addressing-national-security-risks-arising"
Longs may be shaken a little more for weak hands to lose their shares but stay strong. Future will be bright.
"Don’t care what happens today , the whole market bloody , you see Didi potential ,, it’s so popular and ready for a huge run up , not selling a squat!"
$FAMI Is a farming company which China support strongly not like education and tech. MC $47mCash around $100mAssets 5 times more than liabilities Revenue in 2020 - $30mNet profit in 2020 - $800kRevenue 6 months 2021 - $17mNet profit 6 months 2021- $1.4mThey are showing growth of 30% YOYWith $100m in cash and being profitable they are about to do some big moves IMO.Do your own DD!

DIDI is active in after hours We might see $9 plus tomorrow
Olympics will send DIDI to at least $25
"Also, clearly the big dogs are trading on inside info. I'm assuming positive news is about to break."
If the app is up it would have been announced by the news media. Just be patient and let’s not get ahead of ourselves. It will be announced and the stock price will go up immediately. Again just be patient.
"Huge blocks moving, something is up."
DIDI is getting free from all zombie regulatory issues soon. Let’s go DIDI
But-but-but . . . the apps back up?!? LOL
"DIDI's advantage over other Chinese stocks: 1) It's the largest ride hailing platform in the world with a presence in numerous countries. 2) It's shareholders read like a ""Who's Who"" of hedge funds and heavy-hitters (Always good to have strong hands holding a stock). 3) Extreme value (for now) after bad news tanked the IPO.........I'm IN!"
DIDI will break $9 tomorrow. Probably close over $10 or more. Metuan was slapped with a minor fine and Tech in China is trading strong today.
Volume moved up 7 million in last 10 minutes. This is great.
Will open $9 tomorrow and close above $10
Questions for Longs:How many analysts cover DIDI?How many Insiders own DIDI?How much profit does DIDI generate?What is the tangible book value of DIDI? (What does DIDI actually own?)These would be good things to know . . . right?
"This can double any day now, when China and DIDI kiss and make up"
$9 and $10 calls are active
"$DIDI rose 4.4% to $8.17 today, is a NIO counterpart and is the world's largest ride-sharing company. Didi bought out Uber-China and has 15M drivers vs Uber's 5M. At $8, it is like buying NIO at $4, a sure win situation. Didi has 400M active riders despite Beijing suspended new App download for Didi, pending data security compliance. It was IPO a few months ago at $18 and is expected to exceed Uber's $50 soon enough.Moreover, NIO and Didi might partner, with Didi using NIO's Robotaxis for ride-sharing. Can't get in at $4 NIO, then $Didi is that rare opportunity."
"All kinds of stocks are moving UP now, DIDI should rise UP much higher, Buy asap at bottom now and Hold !"
Are we ever going to see 10? 9? or please at least 8?
"XinHuaShe:We start investigate ""didi"" ""huochebang"" internet security's problem.Lmao,just start investigating,chives be patience,wait 3 months more"
"DiDi stock forecast 2025On June 30, Atlantic Equities analyst Xiao Ai initiated coverage of DiDi Global with an overweight rating and a target price of $25. The target implies an upside of 77 percent from its last closing price. Xiao thinks that DiDi’s position in the Chinese ride-sharing market is secure with more than 80 percent market share. The analyst also thinks that the continuing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic should benefit the company in the near term.The Chinese urban population and disposable income are expected to keep rising at a healthy clip. With nearly 80 percent market share, DiDi should be a major beneficiary of this trend. China’s shared mobility is also expected to grow at nearly 30 percent per year over the next five years, which is higher than the average growth rate for the global market. It's forecast to grow from 233 billion yuan currently to 862 billion yuan in 2025."
"Wonder what happened to the guy who said he bought $10,000 worth of $9 leaps expiring around this time"
"Look's Like , DIDI , Has Great Growth Rate , Across Asia , And Many Countries , Across The World , And It We May Start Making A Move Up To $8.50 , GLTA ,"
"Didi orders bounced back strongly in July: ""In July 2021, the total order volume of the net car platform reached 77.6564 million units, an increase of 10.7% compared with June, in which the volume of orders for DIDI also showed an increasing trend, with an increase of 13.1%."" You can search for the original article using the original Chinese text:""在2021年7月，网约车平台的总订单量达到了77656.4万单，与6月份相比较，增加了10.7%，在这之中，滴滴的订单量也呈现出增长的趋势，其增长的幅度达到了13.1%"". I can't paste URL - otherwise my comment is auto-deleted. BTW Didi orders dropped 13.4% in June after its apps were removed from app store. So this new data for July showed that it's almost back to pre-app-removal order volume. Its leader among Chinese ride-hailing platforms is quite solid."
DIDI the Meme stock!
"Fines and settlements announced for others, news coming soon?"
China fines Meituan less-than-expected US$530
"Didi will hit $200 after it buy out Uber-usa, it already bought out Uber-China. Didi's founder is the princess of the founder of Lenovo, who bought out IBM PC Unit. Thereafter, Lenovo beats out Dell and remain the top PC sellers to this date."
Is today pump and dump day or just anticipation of better days to come?
Golden Holiday ends-Didi Golden begins
Something is rotting in Didiville!
DIDI longs in December
"In 2016, Didi acquired Uber China for $35 billion. As part of the deal, Uber was given stake in the company, which has since grown to about 15.4% since its last report.Yes, Didi has all but gobbled up Uber’s China market share. And the Didi IPO could threaten Uber’s U.S. dominance even further, making Didi the potential world leader in ride-hailing.https://moneymorning.com/2021/06/30/didi-stock-priced-high-and-is-still-the-best-ipo-to-buy-this-year/"
"I read in South China Morning Post that Govt Reviews can take up to 60 working days to collect info, 30 working days to prepare and issue results, and 15 more working days in special circumstances. So the review max would be 105 working days or about 5 months. I believe Didi’s review started July 16, meaning it could go as long as Dec 16."
"DIDI is going to surprise a lot of investors!! Especially the shorts!! The $24 price target is at the low end, could see $45 by mid 2022!!!"
Eventually it will go higher than iPO. It needs a catalyst to turn around and that’s happening tomorrow after the Chinese market rebound.
Chinese Food Delivery Gian Meituan Cleared In Anti-Monopoly Probe After Paying $533 Million Fine
Has the rally begun ?????????
can't be held down for long
$Didi has no where else to go but up to meet its destiny at $88+
80 million shares short. I wonder if they will ever have to cover.
Buy at $12. I hope to find this level!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"I just added some shares! This is a great opportunity. Let's not forget how high the IPO price was just a few months ago. We will eventually get back there once the volatility calms down a bit. I must say at these prices, I'm happy to hold long term from here."
DIDi $10.5 by Friday
1K shares@$8.47. Strong hold.
Buying more and thanks DIDI for this dip
"Oct 1 - China National Day. Didi, NIO, BABA, and many Chinese stocks will soar. Don't say you were not foretold."
is aihs the new didi?
House of cards . . . up on zero volume.
Charlie Munger doubled down on BABA! That’s how worried he is about the regulations. He doesn’t make many moves I love it! Be greedy when others are fearful don’t forget that long term holders!
"Baba flying , look out , this surge fast "
"Read this on Didi Reddit platform (source: one of the guys works for Chinese brokerage firm).Counting from the 2nd July, 3 September will be 45 days since the trial began. On 3 Sep, the results will be sent to relevant third parties added 15 days (working) which is 24 September for reply.If there is a disagreement, if they can't come to a conclusion on 24 September, there will be a delay of further 45 days which brings the date to 31 Dec. Fingers crossed. Days between now and next week are crucial. Goodluck all."
"All kinds of Chinese Stocks are moving UP fast today, DIDI should catch up with them, Buy asap and Hold for sure !"
When is the 45 days done ?
"Whoever is hanging around to see Didi under $7.50 is a Moran and maybe young traders , this is a volcano  at its consolidated price waiting for tailwind, we’ll the app release, then he’ll break loose to the moon "
President Xi is gonna give the longs a good ole smackdown. You have been warned.
Where is that guy? Oh Didi ah DaDa. I just love him. He is very innocent. Hey god please forgive him.
"Once the app goes back up, this will be over $14 fast"
They had some interesting insights about DIDI on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
DIDI did not close over $9 today. Wrong. Maybe tomorrow. It will happen very quickly and suddenly. The firesale will be over soon.
Oh DiDi oh dada! I love my DiDi.
Believe that CAC provided input first week of Sept wrt what all needs to be changed in DIDI software in order to meet the intent of laws being enacted Nov1st and past violations. Sept 7th was when Didi started working on fixing these things. They have 30 working days (extendible by additional 15 working days) to fix all the issues. There will be public disclosure only after everything has been fixed. Don't expect the public disclosure to happen until around end of Oct or first week of Nov (depending upon if they seek extension of 15 days). App should be on-line second half of Nov. All of above is deduced from public information and i don't have a crystal ball or any inside info.......
"Thank you, China. You made me broke"
"Insider news is that once Beijing reorganizes Didi's management, its App will be back online. Liu as the princess of Lenovo's founder were on an unpatriotic path as Lenovo is considered, unlike Huawei. Once the reorg is complete in a few weeks, Didi is expected to quickly rise to $20 per before settling to an opearational $65 per. Didi is expectedly to eventually buy the money losing Uber as Lenovo bought IBM PC unit."
We will know in days to come.
"Everything will be okay, and one year later, you will find DiDi at 25, most likely."
"All US indexes are red/down at this minute, but $NIO and $Didi are up."
"If you can download DIDI app give a thumbs up ok , and say which country you from ."
APPLE have 1 billion invested in DIDI also UBER owns 16/20 % of DIDI . So don’t worry about your investment we good.
Evergrande made the payment. DIDI tomorrow to the moon!!!
Maybe China finally realizes they are killing the golden gooses that move their economy....I think they have....I think DIDI will get smacked not punched by the govt. and their app will be allowed back with some face slapping changes....when that announcement comes this hits 12.
Meituan just got a slap on the wrist from regulator expect similar for Didi
lETS rIDE
Worry not...a downturn for Didi is just around the corner.You have been warned.
Between Oct 15th through Nov 15th. 30 to 45 working days after Sept 7th.
This weekend we could get the verdict and/or green light for DIDI. This is a big weekend l think
This ham sandwich ain’t going nowhere until the big boys let it
"This stock isn't worth $5 let alone $7! They don't own anything. They never made a dime. They have an app. Big deal. When China throws down a MASSIVE multi billion dollar fine, when the 4 Billion shares are unlocked, when DIDI gets delisted in the USA, these shares will be under $2 bucks and STILL be overvalued!"
Selling continues. There is no bottom now. All time low is now in play.
once this breaks $8 its going to fly like an unchained hawk
Wow DIDI is at $8 !!! In this rate it may reach 10 in 20 years or so.
DIDI categorically denied the Barron/Reuter’s report about Liu leaving the company. Obviously “insiders” spread rumors to scare and shake those week hands.
By December DIDI we will give us a great ride in 15 - 20 range.
DIDI to the Moon
DIDI is similar to NIO . NIO few years ago went down from $19 to $2 then just few weeks later up to $6 then $9 then $35 you could check out the chart
"Two things need to happen for this stock to really pop:1) China needs to complete their ""security review"" and dish out the fine, whatever it is. The market hates uncertainty more than anything.2) The CCP and SEC will have to find common ground when it comes to auditing US listed Chinese companies. This is a much longer term issue, which probably wont be resolved for another year or two, if ever. The good news is that I think if we can get issue one out of the way, DIDI should at least rally back to a reasonable price."
"Meng Wanzhou, Princess of Huawei touch down Beijing yesterday. Possible signal of softening/better commercial relations U. S./China. May explain unconfirmed activity release APP DIDI-RIDER"
All Chinese stocks up except this. Don't say App is not up.
Last chance to buy below $12
"https://news.yahoo.com/m/8e56340e-2203-3a72-a30e-0cb368b8a0f0/chinese-food-app-meituan.htmlDidi shares expected to leap after App resolution, as Meituan demonstrated."
Amazing how DiDi not trading at $15 yet! Buy as much as I can in this level.
"Teacher Ma is in HKong to get into the EV business and Didi is his first stop. Learn to stock up on Didi, grasshoppers!"
Up after hours by 0.18. Tomorrow looks like a dollar up day. Shorts are going to be roasted….
"Apple invested $1B into Didi to get a ride share eto the stratosphere, google it."
To restore market confidence China should allow the DIDI app online immediately. The markets are looking for some redemptive action.
Didi will open at $12 tomorrow n fall back down to $10 by EOD.
Take the Great Ride with DIDI . It has started.
"Did you know Lenovo bought IBM PC Unit and Lenovo outsells Dell since then? Co-CEO of Didi, a harvard grad, is the princess of Lenovo founder. Didi bought out Uber-China and will with its recent IPO destined to buy out Uber-USA and Lfyt, both never turn a profit till now, in contrast to Didi."
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-still-calling-10-120000250.htmlSell everything of US equity and buy into Chinese equities, e.g. $NIO, $Didi, $Baba as safe haven. Only Chinese market will rise when US's crashes since those tickers consumers are 95% located in China. Remember 4000 swap stations in China and 400M didi riders in China. As a proof, all western economies have negative growth in during Covid peak but China has 3% positive growth is proof enough."
"Beijing and the Xi's court have bought enough at this $8 price, ready to cut the tied-downs for Didi high-flyer to take flight again. Common prosperity at works."
I own 30k DIDI at average 9. I hope tomorrow it momentarily goes to 8 or below because I am buying Ling options for 9/31/21 for $10k. That’s how much I believe in DIDI.
Tomorrow will be a blast. Next stop is $10 (which is the barrier)
"I closed my short position 10 days ago at $7.95. Yea, I was a bit early (missed the drop to the $7.30's) but I made $118,000 and decided not to get greedy. I still think when this puppy drops, it will drop HARD!Buyers beware!"
Added more @$7.70.
Feeling good about DIDI right now...real good.
"The key numbers for Didi’s usage (from the F-1) are big:493M annual active users.156M monthly active users in the recent 2021 quarter.15M annual active drivers.41M average daily transactions.Didi is getting towards higher profitability by using EV to lower cost, then self-autonomous taxis."
anyone owns didi is mostly bagholder. bigtime
"Congrats to all the faithful. IMO, this is just the begining."
The app is back !!!
"Houston, get ready for takeoff...."
"I am sorry for the long speculators who won't be told. This is not a meme stock that can move because you buy a few shares and scream, ""GO, GO, GO"" This company is subject to regulation by Chinese authorities, and punishment by the government of China for going public when they were told to wait. I think the fact that management and directors gave themselves 3.3 billion usd in shares in that ipo, also angered the CCP beyond measure."
Get ready for the big fail!
Let DIDI become the third Meme stock
Didi will be big during 2022 Olympics. New users will need to access app. All will be good . Transportation during Olympics is huge. Please short so we can destroy. $18.00 during Winter Olympics.
We have moved from miserly 8m to 20m traded -next step 50m-100m
Get in now before winter Olympics. When the world is watching all will be good. Transportation will be a major focus. Didi will be big. $18-$22.00 just getting started.
Xi is gonna do the same to Didi that he did to Baba!!HHAAHAHAHHAAA
"The only sleeping giant on the NYSE is DIDI,,,"
Fifth up day with increasing volume. 40 percent float short. Sitting on a powder keg. One kindle and it will blow.
Chinese group issued a stern denial of rumors circulating in the media Monday that its co-founder and president plans to step down.
"Found article posted on internet:After a Fall From Grace, Didi is Still on Top, but BarelyHow Competitive are Other Ride-Sharing Apps?Customers simply want a service that will allow them to travel from A to B as quickly as possible. If other apps fail to pick up customers in a timely manner, they become less competitive. I tried Meituan, one of Didi’s biggest challengers, to find out how long it'd actually take to get a ride. I set my destination to Sanlitun SOHO, and on the app, it showed I'd be able to get a ride within 4 minutes. But after waiting nearly 15 minutes, the platform was still telling me to wait patiently while they found a driver.you can google the whole article&https://www.thebeijinger.com/blog/2021/09/17/didi-dead-not-yet#"
Tomorrow may be a big day. DIDI will not grow slowly for no reason. It must be a large institution slowly buying.
"I have been hearing the longs say ""tomorrow"" for months. In the mean time, I shorted the hell out of this stock and made $118,000. Easy money. I closed my short position at $7.95 because this has turned into a MEME stock. Logic no longer applies."
"Meituan Stock went up +20% within 3 days after the news. So everyone knows DIDI is going to shoot up… So before the news, we can see $16. So After the news!!! It will rocket. Its now or never… last chance folks."
"Didi 90% chance above IPO $18 by December 2021. Buying another 20,000 shares on open."
Interesting development. Suddenly etrade reduced its margin requirement on DIDI from 100% to 65%. That’s a good sign
"Beijing won't delist Didi simply because if it does, no more future IPOs allowed for any Chinese firms in the usa. From cost-benefits perspective, that's a no brainer from the wise socialist capitalist oxymoron in Beijing."
"Yes, it's not sexy to see a stock of a flagship company drop...But that's the time to buy...A) Around 180Million, middle class Chinese citizens are invested in those stocks.B) Deputy prime minister, Liu, which is President's Senior Economic Adviser, just said. Quote: ""The principles and policies to support the development of the private economy have not changed"" Simple equation for me. The ""hint"" is free of charge."
Once we break $10 easy ride to $15. Patience
When do those 4 billion shares get unlocked? I just noticed the total share amount
There are simply no buyers at ANY price!
when the app goes back up this will be $10+
"Chinese President Xi Jinping will launch an inspection on the ties between China's state banks and other financial honchos with big private-sector players that VP Wang Qishan allegedly helped avoid for years, the Wall Street Journal reports. Wang Qishan for years had installed people close to him in important positions at state-backed financiers.China aims to address the economy's dependence on debt-fueled construction sprees, prompting turmoil in China's property sector. Xi will focus on the links with private firms like Evergrande Property (OTC: EVGPF) (OTC: EVGPY), DiDi Global Inc (NYSE: DIDI), and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA) backed Ant Group that was recently under regulatory crossfire.China's top anti-corruption agency will review the files of 25 financial institutions regarding their lending, investment, and regulatory records and seek explanations on specific deals or decisions related to the private firms.Things are getting seriouser and seriouser...I would not want to be a Didi executive at this time. Very dangerous.The data security investigation and anti-monopoly reviews are bad enough. They are still at huge risk, and as insiders said, they are cooperating as a ""matter of survival""."
ap coming back
We will never sell until 150s
"All things Didi hinge on singular event: Status of App online, which is inevitable for a U$40B company at $8, so valued at $200B if at $50. In short, Didi will fluctuate narrowly before rocketing into the stratosphere."
"Incredible tail winds, bad news already digested by market. The move will be sudden and all the ones that wait or are caught short will be very sorry."
Buy DIDI asap and Hold for sure !
"This is going to be interesting. 35% of float (please note that float is the correct metric to focus on and not outstanding) and any one (or more) of three triggers for a short squeeze any day: Earnings, annoucment of fine that is widely anticipated, and/or the biggest of them all: Release of the app in china. 80 Million shares will need to be bought by shorts. Will spike. How high, who knows. Can go up to 25 in one week......."
"Didi = 弟弟 = Brother, which is NIO, backed by Hebei municipal goverment, with approval from Beijing."
"DIDI is up 3.83%, but is under-performing most other Chinese equities today. Come on, let's go!"
Short interest increased 5% to 83.9 million shares. That group of fish is getting way too complacent having controlled the stock for months. Let's drive this above the 50 DSMA of $8.42 and a move towards $9+....It's our time!! 
This will be a two digits stick sooner than most people think ..
I think it will close at 7.98 today. step by step
"Was in the border town of Mexicali, Mexico yesterday. Out of the blue, I was surprised to hear some guy mention he was taking a DIDI to the border. Point being, this company does have a global presence. It's future will be bright......We just have to hold on through this decline."
"I have no idea when this company’s problems will be resolved….One thing I know with certainty both as a private investor occasionally in Asian companies and as an instructor of taekwondo for 30 years ( And as I modestly say pretty darn successful in both) The Chinese culture is a very proud culture they do not like to lose. In fact loss is considered a significant disgrace. So it’s with that mindset that I believe wholeheartedly the Chinese government while making their point will also do everything possible to make this the most successful ridesharing company in the world, it’s a matter of pride…And of course the politicians that will benefit financially from their success. I had a good friend here in Greenwich Connecticut where I live from Goldman Sachs roll his eyes and laugh when I picked up 25,000 shares of NIO at three dollars a share. What I’ve learned over 30 years is that the experts know a lot less than then care to admit….But with that Ivy League degree nobody question s them….Good luck to all"
All the best to all DIDI holders!!!
Uncle sam has taken half of today's move.
"cheaters are in control of price movement and at closing too. geeeses, enough is enough"
"Dragon Dawn is on the mark somewhat confirmed by Uber CEo on CNBC:Insider news is that once Beijing reorganizes Didi's management, its App will be back online. Liu as the princess of Lenovo's founder were on an unpatriotic path as Lenovo is considered, unlike Huawei. Once the reorg is complete in a few weeks, Didi is expected to quickly rise to $20 per before settling to an opearational $65 per. Didi is expectedly to eventually buy the money losing Uber as Lenovo bought IBM PC unit."
"Insider Story: Beijing City Government is massing Didi stocks at half price before announcing it is having a board member to control Didi operation n compliance on data security. This is done stealthily so that share price buy back will be at depressed price. Once purchase is complete, it will be publicly announced and Didi will soar back to $18 in days, before rising to stratosphere."
"Where are the cheer leaders , you are welcome"
DIDI will close over $9 tomorrow.
"Didi Stock Forecast for 2025Didi has everything it takes to be on top of not just the Chinese rideshare sector, but China's economy. It has more in the pipeline than growing outside of China, and it could potentially be game-changing.The company made future trends its priority, focusing on artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and Big Data, all working together to create a smarter fleet. Didi could potentially be in command of an entire transportation ecosystem. It's already bought Uber in China and is showing no signs of slowing down.It's focusing on groundbreaking, industry revolutionizing projects.The company is worth about $68 billion right now, but it could be worth upward of $230 billion by 2025.While its IPO didn't go as planned, it's still showing signs of life. Because it's controversial, hardly any analysts cover the stock. But the few that do have set a 12-month target price between $18 to $20. That's a potential 160% return.The way Didi is expected to grow, its stock could have returns similar to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) within the next five years. Analysts give the stock a minimum price target of $161 by 2025.Those are some serious gains, but again, not without risk.Follow Money Morning on Facebook and Twitter."
"Wall Street expect DIDI to be 25 dollar in the next 12 months , did you know."
"Xi and his court needed to load more of Didi at this bargain price, then it is too late to board the rocketship Didi to the stratosphere when Xi is done feasting."

Hope I get to buy some more in the pre market before the take off
Great volume for just 2h 15m. 
Big run rest of the week. I predict passing 8.50
"#1 in the world Ride-Hailing company, should be traded right now like Uber, around 45$ a share. Only those with Patience will gain."
"Chinese media start bragging how successful state companies are,now almost all state company's Secretary of Party Committee are chairman.DiDi is the next target"

"As I see it, the stock will match it actual worth (around 40$ a share), as a world leading ride hailing company, in a reasonable time. There is a reason for the latest climb of flagship Chinese stocks. The Chinese authorities seems to finalize their requests. 180Million Chinese citizens hold those Chinese stocks. Soon will be winter olympics in China. It's of everyone's interest (except of short sellers that will get burnt), that those stocks will climb to their potential."
DIDI will go up gradually. Ride hailing is doing fine after the golden week per CNBC Asia. We should be back to IPO levels by the EOY and improve for the Chinese New Year and Winter Olympics. I can only see upside for this stock. Just be patient and stay the course.
Just stay the course - long. DiDi will be at $16.
"No storm or rain can stop Didi or baba from burning shorts today in the USA stock market , we are trading real bluish"
Don’t play with Chinese stock

Long way to go this is $100+ stock
"Anytime after China National Day DIDI will rise UP to $45+, Buy and Hold !"
Didi has no where to go but UP.
A lot of buyers and no sellers lol
"DIDI one day up, next day down, like a yo-yo. No definitive direction."
$9 by Friday.
Remember folks . . . you can lose EVERYTHING in this stock. The reality is that DIDI doesn't own a thing.It's an idea. A concept. AND it's NOT an original one!Where could this end up?
up we go!
"Prior to dropping below 7, Didi hung around this level for a long time. I assume there were a lot of buyers here. My guess is there will be significant resistance at this level."
Man oh Man....We could sure use a rally.
No one knows or can justify why DiDi is not evaluated at double if Uber!
Didi $10 this Friday
Ist hour = Amateur hour!
"Hey short sellers. Even though DIDI is going down but there certain amount resistance that’s there whenever it goes down. It’s a very good sign for long positions. If any good news comes this stock is going Dhoot up in no time. So all the short sellers, watch out. You bad days are coming soon."
China will not delist because it will tarnish their global/USA investors indefinitely
DIDI will explode up 30% very quickly once fine is levied and app back online. This will be very soon! All shorts Beware!!!
Headed to the 6's.
don't tell me some of you believe Xi's/CCp's biased media? I wouldn't believe the positives coming out of there but would believe negative news against the Gov.
Didi Price/sales = 0.22 Uber Price/sales = 6.71 and its unprofitable businessLyft Price/sales = 7.62 and its unprofitable businessMarket Madness...
"Didi the dodo. Even the oh didi oh dada guy has given up. As soon as I sell, it will start moving up…."
