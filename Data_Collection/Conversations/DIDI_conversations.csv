Our beloved Chairman Xi Jinping is enjoying lunch made of crispy DIDI
I added shares of DIDI just now and keep buying ! Buy and Hold !
Predict will be 20s once the app is back online and uncertainty clears up. Gift horse.
Everyone chill out
Beginning to see good signs of conciliatory cooperation between Didi and Chinese regulatory bodies. Good signs to relieve tensions.
"25m rides a day,95% of market much bigger than Uber or Lyft"
Wild speculation by Bloomberg regards Government investment has been debunked
This is $40 stock once APP is up!
Company with major growth just hold for 3-5 yrs you might change your life
"My friends DIDI is a stock you do not want to miss on. Buy what you can, but I will also caution you not to put more than 15% of your total portfolio into DIDI. This is just a good rule of investment to diversify. I see too many people post, I invested everything and now lost it all, my wife will divorce me, etc etc etc., Use your best judgement but only put about 10% - 15% of your portfolio into any stock., regardless how good it is :)"
5- 6 percent a day and we’ll be at 20 by next Friday
Buy DIDI asap and Hold for sure !
It is clear Bloomberg is engaged in wild speculation about China listed companies.
A share with $14 IPO price can’t stay below $15 for too long.
"Go to their website you will see they are operating in Argentina , Australia , Brazil , China ,Columbia,Japan, Mexico ,Russia, and many more countries ,, Didi is bigger than how shorts wants us to think  shorts are toast"
"37 million. Volume is back!!!!Time to fly with the hedge funds.Shorts: Please short it harder, pleaseee lol"
"BEIJING, July 28 (Reuters) - Chinese billionaire Sun Dawu was sentenced to 18 years in jail on Wednesday for crimes including “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” and illegally occupying farmland, a court said, the latest stiff punishment of an outspoken corporate boss.Another example that no amount of money can buy a company's way of trouble once the current Chinese administration has decided that you must be punished. The penalties are coming fast and furious. Sun was forced to donate a large portion of his fortune to charitable projects. Sun had built a major conglomerate in the northern Chinese province of Hebei, employing 9,000 people in activities ranging from poultry processing and pet food to hospitals, schools and resorts."
Some one bought so much stock in little time.. Looking good.. Go DIDI
"What you think is everything! Venture capitalists had already pumped in about 10 billion dollars to make it up, create a big dream and then cash out for profit, even though so far DIDI never make a dim!"
didi Will be big ! You heard me here say it!
"This stock will not be at $9 for too long., get in now or be left behind! Buy NOW!!!!"
"We go past 9.72, next stop 11.30ish Technical indicators looking good feeling good  We're going higher "

"When Yahoo is spreading fud, you know DIDI is definitely going up. Bye bye shorts."
back to 10
Soros so sad.
"DIDI worth at least $20/share. Guessing the real news is the app will be back up online very soon and DIDI in full compliance, meaning it shd be IPO price ($14) or higher."
"Auto ; You Maybe Right , Chinese GOV. , Look's Like They May Have Iron Out , Their Problem's With DIDI , And Announcement's Maybe Out Next Week ; Great For Worker's And GOV. ; Will Add More Share's Next Week ; GLTA ,"
Supposedly Didi is expanding into Nigeria and a few other countries. Have you guys seen that?
"The meeting requested that leading platform companies like BABA Tencent Dada Meituan DIDI ""take the lead and do demonstrations"" and actively fulfill their employment responsibilitiesIt is necessary to improve the system and mechanism to protect the rights and interests of workers, fully listen to workers' opinions and suggestions, unblock the channels for workers' appeals, optimize platform algorithm rules, and improve the income distribution system, working hours, and labor safety and health system. Establish and improve the labor complaint mechanism to ensure that employees' complaints are responded to in a timely manner and handled objectively and fairly.$BABA $MPNGF $TCEHY $DADA $DIDI $HUYA $BIDU $TME"
AND........We're comin' back!
Short people are still here spreading rumors. DIDI revenue is 42.2 billion RBM( about $6.5 billions) and profit is 5.5 billion RMB ($846 millions) in first quarter of 2021. The revenue increased more than 13% in second quarter.
USA is voluntary CapitalismChina is Authoritarian Capitalism.... Read Obama's book : Authoritarian Capitalism will prevail.
These companies should be delisted. Going much lower.
See NIO chart for future results...
We need the app back . How much longer?? 
Up to $9.29 after hours......Nice.
"With Beijing government having a stake in control, profitability is insured. Investors should see good return. That's good news to longs."
Sue Cramer
DiDi was upgraded today by MS and raised the price to $40
"Bought in at $8, add at $9 and bought the dip today! This is a $50 stock! Strong fundamental, buy and hold guys."
I see a positive green day tomorrow!
Was that 10 dollars?
"Ai 2021CNBC and Cathie woods alone can not stop China and Didi , way ahead of the USA , USA adopting chinas regulatory style ,, do not be fooled, wake up bulls investors stop being scared and burn shorts we own the float, let’s take this thing to $78"
"My way of investment: 1)Never invest money you don't have, I'm not here for the casino2)Never invest money In just one stock, for the same reason. 3)You better buy stocks of a strong and established company, which declined enormously (like DIDi) for the longer term. Vast majority of times the situation will flip around. It could take few weeks, months etc', as sooner as better of course, but in vast majority of cases it worth the wait, as it may give you even ten times more for your investment."
This is minimum 300bil Company
Cramer said buy as many shares if DIDI as you can. Cramer endorses this stock.
"Stock market is going to rebound UP, buy DIDI asap and Hold ! I keep buying now !"
30% less daily users since crackdown... well done China...
Buy whenever others are fearful. I buy 3000 today to test the water because everyone is afraid
can the App be released on weekend? .. looking forwrd for next week nd next big run.
"It seems to me that it will not be able to get over 9.00 or 9.50 bucks , but I do think that it will get there by the end of the month( maybe 9.70 or 10)"
just bought 10000 shares
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
It doesn't take China to take THIS long to investigate DIDI. I think the investigation has already been completed and Didi is working on changing it's app and policy to comply. Any day now we should be able to see their APP downloadable again... Stock should hit $30+ then
My portfolio rn lol
"Let me tell you the logic behind DiDiCCP said DiDi broke the date security,how DiDI dare to do it??Because international capital behind DiDi,after this incident ,will DiDi does everything CCP says???maybe,maybe not.So why CCP takes this underliying threat？？Let DiDi dies will be best choice to CCP.Also,DiDi has no any technology leading，anyone with money,can ezly does it's job.DOn't forget it's in China,you are dealing with CCP,it can do anything to protect itself ."
"It is just a start today, Buy DIDI asap !"
China needs Wall Street investment also avoid needless law suit Didi will move back to $18 and upward beyond
"If the deal goes through where the Chinese government essentially buys back the company & the IPO. The buy back price would have to be at least $18 per share or in lament terms a 50% increase from the price now at this current moment! Congrats everyone, lets start popping the bottles! Its been a long wild ride but one that was absolutely worth it!"
The people shorting it today covered at 3.30..some...will regret when positive news comes out because they are still short
DIDI is just itching to get back to its IPO price.......And beyond!
"Didi website is now up in all search  engines We also noticed that there are just few hadfull of shorts around  us longs own the float , waiting on launch to $78"
"Here are some interesting facts we've found about the Chinese regulatory environment related to big tech from Angela Zhang, who is a Chinese Law professor at the University of Hong Kong. $BABA $TCEHY $PDD $DIDI $JD1/Regulations were following a global trend to regulate Big Tech2/Policy swings between lax and harsh enforcement is not unique to Big Tech or this administration3/There are pros and cons vs. the governing style of the West. They can act faster, but the structure sometimes creates situations where quick action is necessary.4/The government derives its authority from 1. Economic growth 2. Nationalism 3. Social stability5/Chinese firms are very active to avoid damage and to shape policy which, like in the US, can actually entrench them further.6/China sees the platform economy as its ticket to re-balancing their economy and to future economic growth.7/They can't wait to regulate as there are too many dire consequences that would affect long-term economic growth, social stability, and therefore the legitimacy of the government.8/Business leaders in China are often rewarded for taking action before getting approval from the government. In China, regulation tends to come after innovation, which is different from the US or Europe.9/The recent regulation was destabilizing to the economy and it's possible that the government didn't foresee the impact it would have on the markets. If regulation is not executed correctly, it will affect the their key priorities (mentioned in #4)."
Can we see $10+ today?
G I hope I don’t come across as a cheerleader but what I said yesterday about being patient and being rewarded is accurate ….Also what I should’ve been more clear about when I said I was on CNBC eight years ago I should’ve been clearer I was on there one time talking about a medical stock that I’ve long since sold. jazz pharmaceutical I bought that way back in 2009 It was 1: 05 dollars a share and I I got out at $140 plus in 2014…I guess someone actually thought I knew what I was doing so I got an invitation lol. I have no idea if the stock will perform as well as jazz pharmaceutical but I could certainly hope one day it does
A news said didi already lost 30% market to its competitors in China ???? Will their apps be up before end of the end of this year ? All factories are busy to export Christmas goods to the world now. Then they will be busy again to finish all the orders before shutdown for 1 to 2 weeks during the lunar new year holiday.
su: Monday could be back to normal as they already have set up union
"load up load up guys, green days are ahead, my boat is sooo full"

"$41 BILLION market cap / 15,914 employees = $2,576,347. That makes no sense.No taxi in the world is worth that. Even if you are running 24/7/365 in London (which you are not) this thing is over valued, like much of China. Just ask the Evergrande bagholders."
Another amazing day for DIDI! What a great way to start out this week!
It's looking like $11.00 is where the train will stop today boys.
DIDI's trying to pop pre-market......Boy could we use it.
DIDI is my once in a life time gamble. I think it’s going to go to $25 before the end of 2021.
"Hi all , I have bought 500 shares of Didi on the day of listing and have lost almost 50 percent and still holding. I can see so many lawsuits being filed but I am unsure if that is only for those with substantial holdings. Can anyone please comment if a small investor like me needs to do anything to recover losses. Thanks."
"This is my first & last time investing in Chinese stock, if this made me big money then ill change my mind or else never looking back again! Go DIDI go!!"
"To all those thinking Didi is losing money, this about this. They pumped more than $1.5 billion last year on self driving and yet had a Q1 net positive EBITDA of $830mm. The company was trading at $95billion valuation in private markets before going public at $67billion valuation. Way undervalued to start with and now at another 50% discount because of media created FUD. Please look at the facts and don’t be judgmental about the company based on emotions"
"Business wise talking - The Chinese authorities, worked so hard for so many years to be an economical competitive power. That's a fact. Another fact is, that companies like DiDi are their flagship companies. Therefore their financial stability, reliability and success would determine China economical success. That's a simple equation, that the Chinese authorities fully understand.DiDi stock, as a highly successful and very profitable Chinese company, in any normal sircumstances had to worth now around 24$ a share, triple than today. And a balanced forecast, see it as 160$ per share stock, in any reasonable growth just in a few years.The very cheap price(third than should be in Normal sircumstances) embodies already the ""fear element"", very much like the real estate cost at the US in 2010.So for me, not to buy this dirt cheap stock, of highly successful and chinese flagship company, was a no-brainer.I do respect, each and every point of view, but the chances here, with that successful company, are too good for not to buy that stock while it's still to low. It's not a recommendation, it's my point of view... See ya in a few years."
2022 Beijing Winter Olympics! Do you think Didi will be a big part of that? Transportation?
Next stop 11.30ish
lets hope for great Monday
Once again
Going to $10!
$10 today
Twisted reporting by the US media. The government will own a nominal portion of the share and a board seat from a government backed enterprise. This is common practice for Chinese companies.
"Stock market is moving UP, Buy DIDI asap !"
"If Chinese government is one of the stakeholders, I don't think they will want to be part of delisting drama. So, my guess is that there won't be a delisting.I have a feeling that Didi apps will be relisted over the weekend or in the coming week.Fine would be Chinese government taking the stake in Didi for free? LolWhatever, I loaded my boat. Good luck everyone !"

Will hit 100+ this year
"Why DiDi and now? As I see it, Chinese authorities, worked very hard to be an important player in World's economy. In a matter to be so, you must show reliability, stability and seriousness. They can not allow themselves to do something too freaky, or abnormal, as they know they will look foolish and not be trustworthy anymore. that would destabilize, Macro wise, all that structure they been built. Therefore, as I believe, as someone who visited China many times, for business reasons, the Chinese authorities will want to showcase they are good and reasonable. They will want to show that Chinese stocks of flagship companies (or even smaller) are something you have better buy and not get rid of. It's against their own interests.So my conclusion is, that beside of the actual strength and solidity of this company, I believe the application will be installed any day now with the bless of the Chinese authorities. While the stock right now, already priced like the app is absent, in about third or less of what it should be normally, or 1/20 of as what reasonable forecasts believe it would get very soon now.So for me, it's a strong buy."

"Didi’s founder heads up data security committee, yielding to China’s regulatory demands as ‘a matter of survival’Didi’s founder Cheng Wei will head the Information and Data Security committee, while CTO Zhang Bo will be the executive deputy director"
Hold

This thing can't even get to 1/5 of it's average daily volume.That in itself is VERY telling!
"I love my Didi , fly us longs to the moon , shorts toasted tomorrow"
"Believe stock market is going to rebound UP, Buy DIDI asap and Hold ! I keep buying today !"
Let's not forget the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. Didi will be huge!!! Now is the time. Invest before the Olympics.
"Didi’s founder heads up data security committee, yielding to China’s regulatory demands as ‘a matter of survival’Didi’s founder Cheng Wei will head the Information and Data Security committee, while CTO Zhang Bo will be the executive deputy directorThe committee will oversee data security, cyberspace and information security, personal information protection, algorithm security, content security and overseas business privacy, according to a memo"
Oh DiDi oh dada. I love my DiDi.
We are on the way to AMC by DIDI.
The real questions is does this get bought back at 14 or 18?
Talk...talk...talk...DIDI will be one of my best investments of the last couple of years...just wait and see...
It's only a matter of time until DIDI gets the green light to continue business as usual. China can't survive without DIDI because it's already over populated and people need to get around and DIDI is the most reasonable solution IMHO.
What would it mean to investors if the city of Beijing takes over company?
With apps back online DIDI stock is worth minimum $20/share.
Why is $DIDI gaining today? Is there a specific reason? Let me know!
"This is going to be interesting. 35% of float (please note that float is the correct metric to focus on and not outstanding) and any one (or more) of three triggers for a short squeeze any day: Earnings, annoucment of fine that is widely anticipated, and/or the biggest of them all: Release of the app in china. 80 Million shares will need to be bought by shorts. Will spike. How high, who knows. Can go up to 25 in one week......."
Didi is most probably doing business right now !
"It's a very simple equation... A)Do you think China still would like to be a very strong and influential economical power or not? Yes or No?2)Do you think, that beside of the Fact that DiDi, which is a Chinese flagship company and rated #1 in China, in all the regard to it occupation, which is already enough to get the stock to double or triple it worth now (unlike many other stocks which are pumped much much more for no real reason), well do you think it will not spread itself all over the globe with it superior technology?Yes or No?If the answer is Yes - buy now or you might have lose the train, to 24$ per share first and hopefully to 160$ per share in a few years as being forecasted by analysts. And you might have really regret it for not buying it in dirt cheap.If the answer is No - don't invest or be a shortist. That's an option too. No one here is ""saint"" for buying stocks, including myself. I believe the actual worth of the stock, in it actual condition (just for being #1 among quarter of world's population) worth triple the price right now. As I said, other stocks are pumped for no real reason, unlike this successful flagship company.So yes, like anyone else, I'd like to see dark green in the end of the day, but never mind what, I believe that this company has much more flesh in it, than just comments on internet site, so as one which is here for the long term, few days of green or red, wouldn't change my position, till we first get to 24$ and then might have climb to 200$ when the app would spread all over the globe."
morning star.... we're going higher 
Any large investment in DIDI would need to be a minimum of $12 per share which is Softbank's cost. I think it ends up at IPO price of $14. Interesting to see how this plays out...
Chinadaily (communist party newspaper) writing articles about how to use didi now.
Wynn Casino & MGM in Macau (territory in China) will be most likely hopeless to renew their casino licenses. The Chinese government tighten more control. Their stock prices tumble all the way down to new low.Absolutely a political risk.
"Didi just set up shop in Egypt ride hailing around the pyramids they are continuing to build their brand worldwide business as usual everybody is worried except them, Remember one of the greatest investor on earth Warren Buffet said ( When others are greedy be fearful when others are fearful be greedy well others are fearful right now BE GREEDY!!!!!!!!"
Can anyone share today’s news on DiDi?
back to 16 dollars
"Today’s announcement from Ministry of Transportation along with 5 other ministries is the best news this stock has had. Ministry provided clarity on the expectations. The usage of words like self identify and joint efforts of all 11 ride hailing companies and specifically the warning to stop fake promotions to lure drivers was very positive. Since the app was down, other ride hailing companies struggled to find drivers and allegedly lured DIDI drivers. The government asked other companies to stop such practices. Overall, great news for DIDI"
"DIDI will be sued into bankruptcy with all these class action lawsuits. That will happen right after the Chinese Government levies the largest multi BILLION dollar fine in their countries history.Which will happen shortly before DIDI is delisted from any US Stock Exchange.And ALL of this on top of ZERO growth, ZERO Profit, Negative EPS, and government control over increasing drivers commissions (increased costs).Gee, what could possibly go wrong with buying DIDI?LOL"
Buy DIDI asap today for sure !
"I want to remember this day, when I buy 3000 shares of DIDI for 8.45 ."
"Reasons to buy DIDI:1. 90% of china market.2. Innovative. They are doing very well with driverless car driving. While this is in the future, imagine them having taxi service with no drivers. China is very well advanced in this technology. 3. They are worldwide. They have been expanding fairly successfully into other countries.4. This stock is 40% below IPO price. You are getting a better deal than the original investors. 5. Many big name companies have invested at a much higher rate, including AAPL. 6. Their app will be approved sooner or later. CCP is not there to punish but to or less looking out for the better of their people. Do not look at every action they take as a negative. It is actually good for their people, good for the companies and good for the investors. So my friends., Buy and Hold DIDI. This could easily double your money within 1 year or less. This is the type of stock you want to have in your portfolio. Buy with confidence and thank me later :)"
The day I breakeven and make a bit of profit is the day I might shed happy happy tears! This has been one hell of a ride. Lost all my savings. Never gave up on this gaint. More good news to come. Hold on guys. China takes these tech firms and rewards them if they listen to their master.
Big upside. Maybe a triple by end of next year. Big upside.
"is this getting day traded""?"
DIDI at $8 is like when NIO was at $2.
how much they made last Q?
d i d i just launched its service and app in Egypt with 100 million population.https://middleeast.in-24.com/News/amp/210102
government has to make am $18/share takeover offer to undo public offering.
"Government cracking down is a good thing. There will be better drivers and better vehicles, this means better customer satisfaction and customer safety. This is good for any ride hailing company. I also think there is some competition control, so companies are not fighting against each other, which is good for everyone. Buy DIDI with confidence. This will be $18 and beyond soon."
Let's not forget the analysts price target is 161 Once things get squared away. 
"To be frank, after Xi became top leader of China, he implemented a lot of changes, some are good, some are bad, but he has been in Office for almost 10 years, do you see China is much stronger than 10 years ago, i think most of the people would agree. he cracked down on corruption, mafia, which hurts a lot of people, bad people, but leaded to a safer and better china, he cracked down on entertainments, recently on property and tech companies, we do not know whether it is good or bad yet, but set a compliance standard and enforce it through. In general it is going to benefit consumers and of course themself CCP, to the tech giant, I am not sure."
"The shortists will be vanished as soon as the stock will get Onwards and upwards towards 24$. To short an already successful and established company, while it stock is dirt cheap, unlike many other stocks which are really pumped for no real reason or actual strong activity, it's a huge risk for the shortist, never mind what. We are here for the long, 24$ first, 160$ later. We are patient:)"
"Read this on twitter:08:47 AM EDT, 09/02/2021 (Caixin) -- GUANGZHOU, China traders circulate rumor of app relisting within next two weeks for rideshare company Didi Chuxing (NYSE:DIDI) after meeting with regulators and tentative agreement to address labor and cyber-security concernsDon't know if it's true"
"If the app goes back up, this could be interesting."
What a great day for DIDI today! Congrats to everyone who has added on the dips! I'm going to try and add a little more if the opportunity appears.
"Some investors interpret this news incorrectly and they will regret. Just bear in mind they summoned all ride hailing firm for the brief , it’s not just Didi. For them to be invited to get a brief on how to correct means there’s opportunities for them to be on the right side of the regulations. If they want to get you , there will not be such gesture to tell you what you should watch out for. Just ask jack M . No warning etc and just pull the plug on ant IPO."
Iill tell this is 5X minimum
Chinese Stocks listed both in the US and HK such as BABA and TCEHY all traded higher Monday in HK. DIDI will be higher on Tuesday.
"At this point, I don't have the will left to cheer up this stock. I just want my money back and am out. This only seems to be going down and down."
Hedge funds are just trying to shake weak retail hands. Stay tight and get ready for the flight 
Based on the number of shorts sweating it this weekend will need to gobble up some shares on Tuesday.
Didi is dominating the Chinese market alone with more than 90% occupancy not to mention they are operating business in other countries. Eventually the regulator will give the green light to its operation once the company make adjustment to compliment the requirement of the cyber data security issues. The fair market price as of today is around $24-$28.00/share and we will see it by the end of 2021.
Anybody see how fast it went up near closing ?
"'In an Ironic Twist, China’s Government Might Rescue DiDi Global' byDavid Moadel from Invester Place."
Is anyone else aware tomorrow is the 45th business day of the investigation and it should be concluded? The government said 45 days at most but there is little indication things will wrap up tomorrow..Your thoughts??
Single statement-our app. is released is enough
9 dollars is barely a move. We need to be back in the teens and soon.
"Buy DIDI asap with good news ! DIDI is as like as NIO, now is supported by government !"
HEADED TO $5!
"I expect we close at the low, and open below 8 tomorrow.Just look at the charts."
"Ready to break out this week , I see $78 easy"
Must see $10 today ...
$11.50 stock by the end of the day today 09/01/2021 i'm calling it right now. Buckle up and enjoy the ride boys. We're back like we never left. The stock market is a machine to move money from the impatient to the patient.
Didi has 25m rides a day so it loses about 0.13m a day-BIG DEAL.
Look like US listed Chinese stocks are upward from now on
Hong Kong China stocks popping up big!!!! Didi will be up 5-10% tomorrow!!!!
Any one holding since IPO?
"A loss of THIRTY PERCENT of it's users is HUUUUUUGE! When you add the largest fine in history (Billions) from the Chinese Government, it will have become clear that the Government wants DIDI's monopoly ended. This is game over."
Who bought the dip!!!
Didi denies reports that Beijing city is coordinating companies to invest in it
"This stock of an amazingly successful and strong company, is one of the stocks I believe would benefit their holders in a short while, more than vast majority of stocks traded. I bought it in 8.55$, I wouldn't care less if it get to 8$ or even 7$.I'm here for the 24$ as a beginning.See you in a year from now, no one can short for long term a very successful company."
DiDi 25 by the end September!!!
Notice that every article is negative and the stock keeps going up?
"Assuming we dont see WWIII, this stock is a win. All things Chinese are out of favor, but its in neither countries interest to completly decouple their economies. In fact, not even sure its possible at this point. Our financial and economic markets are tied at the hip. We dont have to be best of friends, but we at least need to be cordial. What would Target, Walmart and Amazon actually sell if we pulled Chinese products? How many jobs would the Chinese lose if we did so? This low key cold war will end soon."
"It is just a start today, UP to $15+ soon, Buy DIDI asap and Hold !"
If DIDI closes above 9.70 We will open over 10.50 Tomorrow
"Super buying point , this will be up on Monday as usual"
$10 tomorrow!

Back on Aug. 3, Chinese state media criticized online gaming as ""spiritual opium"" for adolescents, sending Tencent stock, NetEase and Bilibili sharply lower.On Sept. 8, China regulators called in NetEase and Tencent to remind them to comply with new rules. The South China Morning Post reported Sept. 9 that China will halt approval for new online games."
"That stock of this worldwide leading company, is similar to a geysir right now... Any mediocre news, that have to appear any time soon, could have lift it in 20-30% in a matter of hours. And any good news, might have double it value in a short time. You know exactly how it works... First know about it the ""relatives"" and you see a very strong buy... when the rest of the public knows about it, it's already climbed good 20-30% if not more. And the short sellers? They will be vanished, right at the spot, just like rumpelstiltskin.I'm here no to play games, but to take the gains. Experience wise, understanding the psychology behind it, I have no doubt in my mind that the ""annunciation"" could have come any second/hour/day now, because it would serve both Didi and the Chinese administration. The stick has been felt very well, it's about the time for carrots."
What’s the news today?
Here comes 10 dollars…. 48hour count down
"It's one of those ratest stocks, of a very successful company, a gem, which you find in a very low price, while the rest of the market is pumped with stocks of companies that only hope to succeed like DiDi one day.Therefore if/when it would get down a bit more I would buy more for averaging it. But i don't believe I would have the opportunity to do so."
$10 today 
Catalyst for next week app. release +big investment by Government for data control
"Just purchased more calls today. If you can’t handle the volatility, don’t invest in this stock."
Just buy it this stock more powerful than others like Uber & LFT riders more than triple
"Looking good billy ray, feeling good Bobby Joe"
"""IF"" you had the stomach today....."
"The reward is worth the risk for me. I'm all in on DIDI, bought 8000 shrs at $8 96 and going to hold and wait to see how things turn out. I understand this is a high risk bet but I'm going to take it...."
"That's right, Baby!"
Bankers will want to get in at a better price.. they always win
"Listen carefully to the words of former president of Google China from today (CNBC), you are being manipulated by a bargain hunters. Don't say afterwords that you ""didn't know"", that someone ""freighted you of"", when you have an opportunity to get a world leading company stock(not just a sidekick company) in third of the price it should be traded today and 1/20 of the price it should be traded after the app would be installed and the company would expand in just a few years, as claimed analysts."
I just install Didi
4.82 billions shares outstanding.... LOL a lot of selling coming... I have only 200 shares at $8.88. will add slowly for long term hold.
"If it goes red, I'll be buying more. Won't be this cheap for much longer."
Buy DIDI asap with good news !
"A little advise from me to you:1)Short sellers - dear short sellers, never short a flagship, strong and successful company, which is a world leader, when it stock already declined by 2/3 in a good market... Yes, you may have some success for a short while, but the chance to get burnt is enormous. You have plenty of pumped stocks, which are ten time their real worth, only for their wish to be successful someday like DiDi already is. You have better short them2)Weak hands - don't invest in stocks, you better go once in a while to casino and spend 20$, for the excitement. Stocks is business, not a roulette, you invest in a business of someone here. You believe in it, stay. 3)""Longists"" - that stock would probably give you, what you need and maybe even what you want... Just take your time and enjoy the coffee. Strong climb could start any day now...~Anything I say, it's not a recommendation to buy, it's my point of view based of personal experience in buying dirt cheap stocks of strong and successful companies~"
Can we see $10 today?
16-20$ end of year 
"Not letting go of this bargain, did the same with nio"
They just want some business practices to be fixed. Only concerning thing is they want to reduce the commission but on the whole there is light at the end of the tunnel from major business risk perspective
10s soon!
"Former president of Google China just stated today(CNBC), that the regulations were no different of those taking place in the US (regarding Facebook for example). The Chinese administration highly supportive of it globally successful tech companies.And now to his core statement: ""the punishment already handed, therefore current prices are only bargain hunting... And I would repeat his words: ""Current prices are only bargain hunting""China google president, knows exactly what he is talking about (and it wasn't any different of my point of view for buying that bargain)"
Not selling a single share! A no brainer with regulatory reviews now concluding.
9.79 next move
"I came from China, I keep buying DIDI now, buy asap with good news and Hold for sure !"
"~Successful Flagship company~Normal price should be: 24$ +/-Target price by analysts: 160$ +/-But the ""fear element..."" Unless if would be a 3rd world war and then all our stocks will go to sleep, this stock of this solid company, is as said today former president of Google China: BARGAIN!I'm only pity of the weak hands... they don't know that when we are talking about a successful solid company, the graph eventually always straighten with the success. We are talking of a world leading company here!"
Didi could go on HK exchange or go private-WIN WIN for investors
Going to 11
"5% +10% -Yes, everyone want to see green, but it makes no much difference... Matters would be resolved in days. the situation won't stay static.Therefore, happen the stock would get down somewhat more in a day or two, I would average (my shares been bought in 8.55$ so there is no need). Happen it would stay the same or higher, good, but it won't change much. Stocks are not for cowards. You believe in that company's strength? believe the Chinese authorities don't want to shoot themselves by destroying their flagship companies and their own worldwide economical reliability? So hold.You don't believe? Get out, or don't get in, or be a short seller.But don't be a weak hand, don't lose your money because you have been pressured. If you are afraid of the hit, don't get into the kitchen in first place."
"Due to some people's lack of interest in the facts and figures, I point out that a 30% decline in monthly riders means a reduction of over 2.1 billion usd per month. in gross revenue. (Whilst Uber counts its ""take"" from drivers as revenue, Didi counts the amount the customer pays.)Pundit, I would say that is a big deal, and their lost market share goes up every day that passes. Bad trend.Didi claims to take only about 20%, so in terms of actual revenue that is about 420 million usd added to losses monthly. This is getting very dangerously expensive even before the fines and punishments are announced."
Didi is going to emerge better stronger company
Didi is better then Uber is everyway

I've been waiting months to come on this boards to catch you dumpers with lies and deceiving facts thank you for the opportunity"
App. can be released anytime-shorts will be roasted
"Low volume, shorts are getting desperate. This will fly to 15$ when they start covering. It shot up to 10.50 with a 30m volume, imagine when all 80m shorts cover. 15$ ? 20$?"
"Chinese authorities met with DIDI management team, and urged them to improve “protection of workers rights”. This is a clear signal that the company will be back to normal business soon!"

"Hey, a question for the longs.How many ""insiders"" own DIDI?That would be worth knowing . . . right?"
"I am a holder of Long CFDs. But at the rate at which Didi is going, I think it is going to be another Evergrande. I just want to get my money and I am out of this #$%$"
"Bought for 8.55$That successful company, could have worth now triple that price, if not for the unclear steps of the Chinese government. But because of my guess that China policy makers, don't want to be another N.Korea, but to keep and being serious and reliable factor in World's economy and culture, so my guess, which is not better than yours, is that they would react in that manner and let their flagship companies to keep and flourish in a matter to be competitive. If I'm right, that stock would accommodate itself. I wouldn't advise you, if to be bullish, neutral or bearish with that stock, I just have shared my personal assumptions, which lead me to buy that specific stock.Good luck to the bullish and bearish:)"
we closed green today and that's all that matters.....get ready for lift off.....

"Didi orders bounced back strongly in July: ""In July 2021, the total order volume of the net car platform reached 77.6564 million units, an increase of 10.7% compared with June, in which the volume of orders for DIDI also showed an increasing trend, with an increase of 13.1%."" You can search for the original article using the original Chinese text:""在2021年7月，网约车平台的总订单量达到了77656.4万单，与6月份相比较，增加了10.7%，在这之中，滴滴的订单量也呈现出增长的趋势，其增长的幅度达到了13.1%"". I can't paste URL - otherwise my comment is auto-deleted. BTW Didi orders dropped 13.4% in June after its apps were removed from app store. So this new data for July showed that it's almost back to pre-app-removal order volume. Its leader among Chinese ride-hailing platforms is quite solid."
Article out there on DIDI being least expensive driver service in South Africa. It is relatively new there and growing.
DiDi Shares Quiet; The Information Earlier Reported 'Could Didi List in Hong Kong to Stop Bleeding for Shareholders?'If it happens what share holders would get? just wonder!!
I’m thinking about adding more shares at these levels. I have a little bit more funds cleared yesterday. I got in at around 8.00. Maybe the low 8s. So currently I’m still in the green. It depends on how the markets are doing. I’m definitely going to be watching this one. This is still very much of an opportunity knowing where this was with the ipo price. I have no doubt we will get back to the ipo price again and more once China gets through with it’s regulations phase.
Buy and Hold !
Here's the problem kids . . . even if you try to sell now (if you have over 1000 shares) you can't. There are simply no buyers.

"Great news on US-China front--> ""China and the United States should ... show strategic courage and insight, and political boldness, and push Sino-U.S. relations back to the right track of stable development as soon as possible,"" state media said, citing Xi."
"That’s a strong flexible tower , looks like it’s growing too"
"In a matter to evaluate the futuristic stock price of this flagship company, it's not enough to be an analyst, we all know that those shares could be around triple their current value if not for the Chinese authorities interference. Therefore more important is to understand the psychology behind what's going on.A)We all know China is ""not exactly"" democratic system. There is a leadership there which demands an obedience and honor.B)from the other hand, the Chinese authorities, fully support, their flagship companies(as said yesterday former president of Google China) and know that it's part of China showcase of success. They of course do not want to undermine China economical achievement, as that would backlash at the Chinese authorities. therefore disrupting well known and successful flagship companies is quite the opposite of their global targets.C)So we all know where it goes from here... The Chinese flagship companies would accommodate themselves and everything will go on from that point forward... Those that would buy successful and strong companies stocks in dirt cheap prices, as i see it, will benefit of that. P.S.As much as I know and researched(not a guarantee), things should be resolved on Didi's aspect in about a week from now. The relevant ""accommodations"". And that's what we as a stock holders waiting for, that clarification which will boost the stock."
"Why mandate vaccine when mask mandate is still in effect ,, ? There is no reward or merit to be vaccine,, by the way the vaccine does not prevent Covid or any delta. CNBC has no clue ,,, get a real job shorties , why even listen to CNBC and Cathy woods ?this is a perfect time to buy Didi cause China is way ahead of the USA"

On 3 Sep, the results will be sent to relevant third parties added 15 days (working) which is 24 September for reply.If there is a disagreement, if they can't come to a conclusion on 24 September, there will be a delay of further 45 days which brings the date to 31 Dec. Fingers crossed. Days between now and next week are crucial. Goodluck all."

I own 30k DIDI at average 9. I hope tomorrow it momentarily goes to 8 or below because I am buying Ling options for 9/31/21 for $10k. That’s how much I believe in DIDI.
