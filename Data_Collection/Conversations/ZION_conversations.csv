Wasn’t there some post here yesterday about Zin losing some kind of a lawsuit and that was why it was down so much. It’s not here anymore. Was it a lie and the poster removed it?

Why up 5%? Undervalued compared to similar regionals but this thing doesn't trsde logically. Been watching closely for 2 years. More of a national bank because of it's 7 affiliates. Should be up around $110. It was never in trouble during the housing crash in 2008 because it wasn't making fraudulent loans while serving a religious/conservative population. I picked some up today because it's not pulling back. Actually hoping for a pullback anyway because this thing has no logic in it's price. What's the deal? I had to buy it today because property values are soaring in it's covered areas far beyond the national averages.

"A stock warrant gives the holder the right to buy shares at a certain price before the expiration. ... Warrants can be bought and sold up until expiry. If the current stock price is below the strike price, the warrant may still have some time value and can, therefore, be sold for something.Aug 3, 2019"

"ZION reported earnings today after market close. Earnings missed badly - only .04/share vs .92/share in 2019 Q1. They did add approx $250 million to their bad loan reserve, which affected earnings. Like all regional banks, they did not provide forward guidance for 2020 Q2. Short term, all regional banks will be under pressure due to COVID-related loan defaults & reduced profits due to interest rates being near zero. 2020 Q1 only had one month affected by the virus-related shutdowns (March). The entire 2020 Q2 period will be affected. Times will be tough for banks."

Why so many shorts in Zion?
The RICO violation was settled years ago and some of the executives responsible were removed long ago. Not an issue now. This stock has been cut in half over the last 3 months. It's going up fast as soon as COVID goes away.

"ZIONW is not a stock. It is a warrant that lets you buy one share of ZION stock for $36.55. These warrants expire on 05/22/2020 (next friday). Since Zion current share price is approx. $27, these warrants are essentially worthless. Before the virus-related shutdown 3-4 months ago, ZION stock was $45-$55/share & these warrants were worth a lot more."

"Since the Fed has removed merger restrictions on small banks, somae are screaming buys. For example, Jacksville Bancorp, Virginia National Bankshares, Northewest Indiana Bank and Minden bancorp all earn over 1% on assets and are underleveraged with excess capital. None were in TARP. All have yiedls that are good and earningfs are growing. The averge price to BV is 1.1 and the bank stock index is 1.8. Some of them will be acquired at 2x BV. Good times. They trade thin so do not be greedy."

TCF hold.ORIT add all day under $16.25.Our 4th largest holding now.OPY we sold another 15% so down to just 20% of all monies, still a ton and replaced it with feb and march 30 call options, just much better risk reward and wanted to raise more cash now cash at 27%.OPY should have a blowout quarter this week, but just crazy not to hedge with options so cheap on them. Very rare a small firm like this has options but it does, the stock could POP to $31 plus on blowout earnings or $41 in a deal enough said risk reward so good.CIZN earnings after the close today, same old, same old, buy more up to $22.00, safe bank 9th largest holding now. Almost no bad loans.SF great earnings today, hold the balance 85%, of position still, looking for $75 plus a share. Great markets they are in and very safe firm, maybe they buy OPY both have the best research teams on the street and that will matter next year.FRFC and CHBH we would add like crazy as safe as they get, FRFC up to $44.50 and CHBH up to $53 such low P/E”s on both and great yields that will go up for sure.We have “shorted a bunch of CFG over $47 and BANR again over $57 as hedges and trades for all accounts. 10% EACH huge “shorts” for us.BankNewsletter.com203-942-5905Douglas hughes PresidentDhughes33@charter.net"
"A must have, be able to hold 5 years......NMHKY helthcare facilities in UK *(largest private healthcare in Europe). They have a great corrective plan & government is working favorable. Have enough cash & assets to weather it. Going to look much better in 2021. I am in @ 4k for $0.31 per share. Buy $1,000 today÷ $0.44 per share × $4.00 per share *(2 to 5 years, maybe before) =$9,090.90. It's jumped to $5, $1.50 & $0.80 in the last 3 weeks. In time *(2 to 5 years) I believe $4.00 is easy, possibly $8 to $10 in 2 to 5 years. Risky but this one can turn 10k Into 100k5 year low was July 1st 2016 at $12.21"

"Yes magicjay, that is the definition of a stock warrant. Currently ZIONW is approx .02/warrant with purchase rights at $36.55 until 05/22/2020.. ZION is approx $27/share. So ZION stock price needs to go up by more than $9.55 (36%) in the next 5 days. Good luck with that, you would need to hope for a buyout. Extremely high probability that ZIONW will expire worthless. If the strike price were closer to the stock price & there was more time left on the warrants, the price would be higher."
