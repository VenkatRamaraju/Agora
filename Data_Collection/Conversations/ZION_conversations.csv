"ZION reported earnings today after market close. Earnings missed badly - only .04/share vs .92/share in 2019 Q1. They did add approx $250 million to their bad loan reserve, which affected earnings. Like all regional banks, they did not provide forward guidance for 2020 Q2. Short term, all regional banks will be under pressure due to COVID-related loan defaults & reduced profits due to interest rates being near zero. 2020 Q1 only had one month affected by the virus-related shutdowns (March). The entire 2020 Q2 period will be affected. Times will be tough for banks."
I thought bank stocks liked rate increases?
Short position on Zion is about 15%. This is HUGE compared with other banks. Anybody know why?
This stock was almost $20 a year ago? How did it fall so far? Is it worth the risk?
P/E of 10 and great earnings report... just added more shares.
Who believes this is gonna hit $35 on Monday?
What is the difference between ZIONW vs ZION. Can i buy ZIONW keep it for long term like 5 to 6 months ?
Why up 5%? Undervalued compared to similar regionals but this thing doesn't trsde logically. Been watching closely for 2 years. More of a national bank because of it's 7 affiliates. Should be up around $110. It was never in trouble during the housing crash in 2008 because it wasn't making fraudulent loans while serving a religious/conservative population. I picked some up today because it's not pulling back. Actually hoping for a pullback anyway because this thing has no logic in it's price. What's the deal? I had to buy it today because property values are soaring in it's covered areas far beyond the national averages.

What happens to ZIONW after the warrant expires Friday? Anyone know?
"Yes magicjay, that is the definition of a stock warrant. Currently ZIONW is approx .02/warrant with purchase rights at $36.55 until 05/22/2020.. ZION is approx $27/share. So ZION stock price needs to go up by more than $9.55 (36%) in the next 5 days. Good luck with that, you would need to hope for a buyout. Extremely high probability that ZIONW will expire worthless. If the strike price were closer to the stock price & there was more time left on the warrants, the price would be higher."
I taked a big gamble on the warrant at 0.16 last friday. Let's hope it is going to paid short term!
"A must have, be able to hold 5 years......NMHKY helthcare facilities in UK *(largest private healthcare in Europe). They have a great corrective plan & government is working favorable. Have enough cash & assets to weather it. Going to look much better in 2021. I am in @ 4k for $0.31 per share. Buy $1,000 today÷ $0.44 per share × $4.00 per share *(2 to 5 years, maybe before) =$9,090.90. It's jumped to $5, $1.50 & $0.80 in the last 3 weeks. In time *(2 to 5 years) I believe $4.00 is easy, possibly $8 to $10 in 2 to 5 years. Risky but this one can turn 10k Into 100k5 year low was July 1st 2016 at $12.21"
Added more sharesssss
ZION reached a 52 Week high at 65.97
ZION upgraded today by DA Davidson to Buy from Neutral. No price target mentioned.
Banks still pouring out dividends and feds have removed restrictions on dividend payout. Just hold long and get the div the price will keep up.
Good deal on the way....high volume today.. feel like skyrocket coming
"ZIONW is not a stock. It is a warrant that lets you buy one share of ZION stock for $36.55. These warrants expire on 05/22/2020 (next friday). Since Zion current share price is approx. $27, these warrants are essentially worthless. Before the virus-related shutdown 3-4 months ago, ZION stock was $45-$55/share & these warrants were worth a lot more."
Anyone following how much Zion's generated income will be from them handling the PPP loans? Public record shows they were one of the largest ppp lenders in the US.
