"OGN NEWS: ''Avestria Ventures Closes Fund IBY Business Wire— 9:30 AM ET 08/26/2021Avestria Ventures is a San Francisco-Bay Area venture capital firm focused on women’s health and female-led life sciences companiesSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Avestria Ventures, a Bay Area-based life sciences venture fund, has closed Avestria Ventures Fund I.Founded by veteran life science industry executives Linda Greub and Corinne Nevinny, Avestria invests in early-stage women’s health companies and female-led life science ventures.Avestria seeks to generate strong returns by focusing on these two under-invested sectors. Although the NIH has accepted sex as a biological variable since 2016, less than 1% of the venture capital invested in the $4T US healthcare industry was directed towards women’s health in 2020 according to Pitchbook Inc. Similarly, only 2.3% of venture capital was invested in female-led companies last year, even though female-led teams generate a 35% higher ROI than all-male teams.“Men still represent approximately 85% of the investment partners at venture capital firms,” Greub summarized, “and many of them are missing out on great investment opportunities when they underinvest in women’s health and female entrepreneurs.”Avestria closed Fund I to new investors due to the June 16th acquisition of its portfolio company Alydia Health for up to $240M by Organon , a global women’s health company. Uqora, a second Avestria portfolio company, was acquired on July 1st by Pharmavite for an undisclosed amount.“We believe that both of our focus areas – women’s health and female-led life science companies – are ripe for innovation,” Greub concludes. “And the two exits we’ve already had indicate that strategic investors are beginning to draw the same conclusion.” """"OGN STOCK WILL RISE IN THE FUTURE."
High debt is of concern. Should pay debt off fast.
STOCKS that Warren Buffett owns: KR and OGN.KR has been UP almost everyday and continue hitting new HIGH everyday this week. OGN has not followedthat trend....including today's. OGN sell off as it is ex-dividend today....and it should rebound soon.It was $36 in the week and it is 33.45...Expect to see rebounding to 36 by early next week....
"great stock, just people don't know about it"
Cool. I bought this before Berkshire.
I would expect the hedge funds are pushing OGN down hoping to shake out the little guy. The 13Fs show they totally missed OGN as an investment and now need your shares!
"End of the quarter selling/window dressing? Not much volume, so little indication."
Too funny the Fast Money people are pumping MCD at 21X and Cisco at over 20X. J&J 19X. Better buy OGN at 6X
"Good read in the NY Times on Sunday ""The Drug Lottery"" by Farah Stockman"
After looking at the ABBV earnings things look good here....HADLIMA launch in U.S. in 2023 (HUMIRA biosimilar) with sales targets greater than $1B. Launched in Australia and Canada.
"Organon's $9 billion in debt is nothing -- ok, very little -- for a company that generates billions in revenue and has a low interest on their debt. Merck's previous spin-off, Medco Health Solutions, which was eventually acquired by Express Scripts for a nice profit, also involved seemingly substantial debt."
"Where is the growth going to come from?NEXPLANON, a leading LARC1 targeting greater than $1B of sales, U.S. market exclusivity through 2027. #2 hormonal contraceptive. +9% CAGR (2019 / 2014; pre COVID-19)Prioritize China• 15-20% infertility rate ~ 40-50M women• Estimated 500K IVF cycles in 2021Anticipated HADLIMA launch in U.S. in 2023 (HUMIRA biosimilar) with sales targets greater than $1B.

I really think in any given day some traders plan to move roughly a million shares back and forth. If they use 10 to 1 leverage it only requires a few million in capital. The volatility and bid ask spread pay for the interest costs.
Why is this in the red today ? When most of the market is green

"moving higher on less than average volume. Hold onto your shares, this is very undervalued.."
9.6 billion in debt? No thanks.Looks like Merck managed to lighten their debt load via this spinoff.Dividend is nothing more than a lure for bagholders.
Ratings and Price targets since June JPM neutral. $38. Citi buy $35. MS equal weight $35 BA buy. $43.
"Anyone listening Citigroup's biopharma conference?JERSEY CITY, N.J., September 01, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Organon (NYSE: OGN), announced today that Kevin Ali, Chief Executive Officer, and Matthew Walsh, Chief Financial Officer, are scheduled to participate in a fireside chat at Citi’s 16th Annual BioPharma Virtual Conference on Friday, September 10, 2021 at 9:45 a.m. EDT."
Over a mil shares short were covered last mo. with another 4.1 mil yet to be covered. Shares have been heavily leaned on soon after BAC started OGN with a buy and a $43 PT. I expect these shorts are hoping you’ll give up your shares if they lean on share price long enough! Hold tight and buy more as you are able. Wall Street games!
"Technically not looking great. Looking at a cross of the 50 and 200-day simple moving averages today. Trading below the 20, 50, 100, 200 day moving averages. If price closes below $33, I would look for a drop into the $31 area. All just tea leaves, I suppose."
"trades at P/E of 5, over 3% dividend. seriously undervalued."
Today would be a perfect time for a decisive up day on big volume. Let's see if investors can pull it off.
"P/E is 5, and it pays over 3% dividend! Crazy how undervalued this is.."
"Fair amount of off exchange/dark pool trading. When you see trades out to fractions of a penny, they are almost always institutions trading off traditional exchanges.....36.8526.Trades in fractions of penny's are not allowed on the NYSE. Most online trading and traditional brokerage firms don't allow individual(non-institutional) trading in fractions."
"I like this stock, but won’t buy more before it dips below 30 lol"
"Hadlima (adalimumab) was launched in Australia and Canada. I believe it will be introduced in the US in 2023. Hadlima (adalimumab) is a biologic medicine that helps the pain and swelling of arthritis. It is a biosimilar to ABBV's Humira. Hadlima is used to treat Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Juvenile Inflammatory Arthritis, Psoriasis, Crohn’s Disease, Hidradentitis, Iritis, and other diseases.The market is $20 billion plus for this drug based on ABBV sales information. So I would expect Organon to pick up billions in sales over the next few years. 2019 was the first year the drug faced competition from biosimilars in Europe. As a result, ABBV international sales fell by 31%. In the United States, Humira accounted for $16.1 billion of ABBV sales, as compared to $14.9 in 2019."
I think the biosimilar market will be huge. fir OGN. Merck basically did the same thing as ABT when it spun off ABBV. This stock is set to do very welll. Now is the time to get in before they start having good news and revenue increases.
Been waiting for a nice drop in the stock price. Bought at 32.00 this morning.... about a 9% retracement from the day after the earnings blowout.
"Look at the company: women’s health is a major market now. The stock has great value, volatile though, but in my opinion a goof long term stock. I plan to buy more shortly."
"OGN: """" was upgraded and price increased by Citigroup who Adjusts Organon's Price Target to $43 From $35, Reiterates Buy Rating"""". MT NEWSWIRES 6:27 AM ET 8/18/2021 """" In addition: OGN initiated a first dividend of Ex-dividend Date Dividend amount $0.28 since IPO.... Need to buy today 8-18-2021 with record date : 8-20-2021 in order to be paid.I am a buyer of OGN as Warrent Buffett owns millions of OGN as disclosed in SEC filling in the last quarters."
BAC initiates with a $43 PT today! Over 5 mil shares short! Who would even think of selling under $39
"Yahoo says OGN’s payout ratio is 0%, so I guess they count increase the dividend to 1000% no problem lol"
Someone likes it today
why did they spin-off ? are they getting rid of some not so good divisions ? I justbheard about this stock ..
"I thought this might interest some from the SEC report....For stocks, trades execute either “on exchange” (i.e., on one or more of 16 registered national securities exchanges that list and/or trade stocks, sometimes called “lit” exchanges) or “off exchange” (e.g., on one or more of 34 ATSs that trade NMS stocks or by off-exchange market makers). Exchanges play a central role in price discovery, as the exchange quotes (composed of interest from registered market makers and displayed orders from non-marketmakers) are the reference price for trades that execute off exchange. Less than 60% of overall equities volume is typically executed on exchanges. Retail brokers commonly send the orders of their individual investor customers to offexchange market makers, one example of a practice called “segmentation.” For stocks, offexchange market makers may execute individual investor orders by taking the other side of the trade principally (“internalizing” the trade) or may route the order to other trading venues for execution. For options, off-exchange market makers act as “consolidators” by purchasing individual investor options order flow. They cannot execute that flow off exchange because The Options Clearing Corporation (“OCC”) generally only accepts for clearing standardized listed options that traded on an exchange. Instead, they choose the options exchange on which to execute the orders, perhaps based on where they (or an affiliate) are most likely to trade with the order as principal.Off-exchange market makers have more flexibility compared to on-exchange participantsbecause they are not subject to the rules of the exchanges on which they quote. For example, exchanges are required under Rule 612 of Regulation NMS to price displayed orders for stocks in penny increments, whereas wholesalers can execute more freely in sub-pennies when transacting off exchange. At the same time, off-exchange market makers use the public quotes submitted by on-exchange participants when setting the prices at which they execute individual investor orders off exchange. Off-exchange market makers use segmentation to mitigate one of the key risks traders face—prices moving against their positions after executing a trade. Some in the marketplace may possess superior information about underlying asset values and will only buy when posted prices are low relative to their information, and sell when they are high. Other participants may, by virtue of greater quantities of data, have statistically greater predictive ability regarding the direction of prices. Because market makers are more likely to lose money when interacting with such order flow, they have an incentive to distinguish order flow that does not correlate with future price movements from order flow that does. The bid-ask spread, the difference between what a buyer is willing to pay and a seller willing to accept, normally compensates market makers for the risk that prices may move against them. To the extent that market makers can segment order flow that is less correlated with future prices, they can offer a lower spread when trading with this order flow. Besides differing in the motive for trading, such orders are more likely to be small, uncorrelated with one another, and thus “one and done” (i.e., not the first in a series of orders intended to transact a large amount of stock), which also allows for a tighter spread. Off-exchange market makers typically offer payment to the retail broker-dealer for the right to trade with its customer order flow (i.e., payment for order flow). These payments can create a conflict of interest for the retail broker-dealer. In contrast to fees and rebates charged or paid by exchanges (discussed below), off-exchange payments are individually negotiated prior to trading between the retail broker-dealer and the off-exchange market maker, and the rates and amounts can vary substantially depending on the broker-dealer and its customer order flow. Offexchange market makers may give the retail broker the choice of how to allocate those funds—either by applying some or all of that payment to improve the prices of its customers’ orders or by allowing the retail broker-dealer to keep part of the payment for itself.Most exchanges offer a form of payment for order flow wherein they compensate firms that provide liquidity with rebates and charge firms that take liquidity. For stocks, some exchanges have retail liquidity programs that allow special order types to interact only with designated “retail” orders, which may be supplemented by pricing incentives. For options, these come in the form of “marketing fees” as well as transaction rebates. In contrast to wholesalers(as well as ATSs), pricing incentives offered by equity and options exchanges are considered to be rules of the exchange, so these pricing incentives are subject to the filing requirements of the Exchange Act."
