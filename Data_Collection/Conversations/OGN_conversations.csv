SEC Form 4 released today!! Director Carrie Smith plus many other insiders bought $OGN on 6/3 @ $36.05. The bottom is in. Load up or miss out on sub-$30 pricing.
"Took some $28.00'sOrder on $27.50'sCan't know the bottom, but I am willing to put my money down at these prices."
OK so it is 1 OGN stock per 10 MRK we own with any fractions being distributed as cash. When will the OGN show up in our holdings? How long does it take?
Imagine this....mid October rolls around and Berkshire has increased its stake and the price is still mid 30s....what would you do then?
"Quite the action today lol, all my pharma stocks are up :-) Pharma is very good to own when inflation comes… I have a huuuuuge 5 shares position in OGN lol (from my 52 MRK shares)"
"P/E is 5, and it pays over 3% dividend! Crazy how undervalued this is.."
Will this company pay dividend ? .
"What should wake people up is when we see volume above 3 million shares. Last few weeks the algos seem to have this locked in for 1.5 to 2 million shares a day. There are plenty of institutions taking small positions and some large (Vangaurd 11.4%, 28.9 million shares). The 13F filings filter in each day, but they will be due by mid August (45 days after end of quarter)."
TRC must think there is value here or the would not be buying.
Insiders buying on 6-4-2021: several directors bought shares at $36.05Most recent: Director Fatima bought on 8-19-2021 at $33.79Follow the insiders buying....
Organon & is up 6.25% to 31.80
"I wonder if Berkshire (Buffett) was unloading this turkey at the highs today, probably will continue to feed the fish down she goes... toilet flush that turd"
Smart money knows this is a #$%$ and it belongs in the teens.
For whatever reason my post on Organon being a S&P 500 member and its weighting won't seem to post. I estimate roughly 25 million shares of Organon will need to be held by passive index players.
"Yea, the stock price is nicely above my cost basis."
Do people know what an Investor Relations Department is? Do you know that you can call or email them if you are looking for investment related answers? Organon has a group of employees who work to answer investors questions.
"You can see the manipulation happening in the daily chart/volume spikes. There is no reason to dump a bunch of shares at this point (and with today's technology), but if you look at the chart, multiple volume dumps have occurred. The dumps tell me there are relatively larger players just trying to work the stock lower."

"Obviously not tied to any index trading today. Indices up, Organon down. Computerized algo institutional trading occurring watching trades out to 4 decimal places. No small investor is entering trades out to four decimal places.....For example....29.9034."
Cool. I bought this before Berkshire.
"Organon also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 for each issued and outstanding share of the company's common stock. The dividend is payable on September 13, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 23, 2021.Affirmed our full year 2021 guidance. Looking beyond 2021, we remain confident in our ability to organically grow revenue in the low to mid-single digit range, as LOE risk will largely be behind us and Women’s Health and Biosimilars are positioned to deliver double digit growth."""
"sold this Merck spinoff today - slow growth ahead. Berkshire probably bought for value proposition. Yahoo data shows no growth next 5 years, zacks showing 5% growth. Spinoffs like this are done by mother stock to release the anchor of slow growth and spin to bagholders is letting go of slow grower"
I expect that many odd-lot holders are dumping.
what makes you think this tiny company will pay a divvy?
Morgan Stanley (no Chardan) puts a 33 dollar price target on OGN.
Net income $1.70/share. Annualized $6.80Dividend $0.28/share or $1.12/share annualizedThat is lower than 20% dividend:net income guidanceP/E around 4.5Today's trading will be informative
I am sure it did not help that MRK got downgraded due to the spin off. Price target reduced from 77 to 75.
Won't be surprised if the stock sees 32 by the end of the day
"Evercore ISI declared OGN outperform. That's why it's spiking this morning.The price range of $40-$48 per share implies an upside of ~40.6% to the last close.Some smart old-school ""big house brokers just Dumped the OGN right after the market opened"". FOMO!That's the difference between an investor and a broker."
big negative volume on open...but let's see if this is the tipping the point for reversal... Boolean
Citigroup calls it a BUY
a $20 stock
"Volatility is different from risk and many investors don't know the difference between each other.A lot of FUD about OGN. I'm happy buying the dips, selling the rips."
"Longs here make me laugh...Probably will not see 40 even with good earnings,. Typically you get about 20% pop with good earnings. You do have to admit that PPS is cheap based on 1.6B guidance from last quarter, but we shall see. about 2% of out is shorted (~5.2M). Wonder whose lending shares out unless they are planning to accumulate at this early stage...Hope springs eternal for longs...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always..."
stuck in a $30-35 trading...expect will be for months
being down 2 1/2 percent here if like an up day for other stocks
We are on our way.
That was easy.
The spammers and pumpers are circling.
"Congrats holders! I got my shares thru the MRK spin. I know nothing about OGN so sold today at 32.50. Small gain off my basis, but like I said I know nothing about OGN so I'm out. GLTA!"
maybe both? he had merck so he must of got the spin off.
"OGN will acquire someone decent for growth ,,,, add div. and decent earnings = $38 $40, add in new target of $48."
"Be careful trading this in extended hours. I've seen this thing green in extended hours on low volume for the last few days, only to close red with heavy volume and heavy losses. This company has over 250 million shares and around 10% have been sold thus far. Still room for more selling and perhaps will get at a much better price."
"Barrons article says OGN will be a long term winner, accumulating now while those who don't want the dividend are selling at any price. Thank you and your welcome. See you over $100 next year."
"Volume appears to be steady. Just the algos ticking up the price. But remember, there are other exchanges and dark pools. Who really knows what the current fair price is."
this is just a generic co with old merck products
not sure what to do with my 11 shares. Can't really make nor loose real money with such a small investment.

The buying of roughly 5 million shares is done and the price slides
$37+ by ex divi on 8/20. .28 Still extremely cheap!
"Just started looking at OGN. Do they handle only drug manufacturing? A CDMO? thx,"
Appears as though MS didn’t see earnings this good and was caught off guard! They need more time to accumulate shares before it hits $40! Holding tight!
Do we still have to vote on the TRC tender offer ?
"Fayez Sarofim, noted investor, has also taken a position in Organon. Per J3SG."
"Here comes the push.....4 people viewing this board as the ""managed"" sell off starts."
what is our cost basis? has anyone seen form 8937 yet?
"Q1 2021 Organon did $1.5 billion in sales. Merck revenue was 12 billion. Organon was roughly 12.5% of Merck sales. Remember the spin off ratio was 1-10 shares.Q2 2021 Merck just reported 11.4 billion in sales post spin off of Organon. They reported sales were up 22%. Full year expectations are for 46 to 47 billion. Pre spin off forecasts were for 52.5 billion. Which seem to be in line with roughly $6.0 to $6.5 billion in sales for Organon. So if we expect some sales growth post pandemic with orders in Q2 2020 and using a 12.5% of Merck sales as a guide, I would expect to see Q2 organon sales of roughly $1.6 billion in sales.$1.6 billion in sales and net margin of 23% equals roughly 370 million in profit. 370 million / 253 million shares outstanding is EPS of 1.46. Add that to 1.58 for Q1 and we have 3.04 for the first six months. We are trading at a six month multiple of 9.5. If the company earns nothing for the last half of 2021 the multiple is under 10. If we see earnings approach 6.25 to 6.50 we are trading for 4.5 times. Completely silly especially if the company follows through on their previous announcement they will pay out a dividend in the low 20 percent range of 2021 adjusted net income. The ""adjusted"" part is open for discussion based on spin off/one time expenses.20% of $6 is a 1.20 dividend. 1.20 on a $29 stock is a yield of 4.13%"
"@HowieThanks for taking the time to research and report thoughtfully on this; appreciate it very muchThere is a good example from recent history of what we may expect from the Organon spin off: Viatris, which I have followed closely and developed some understanding ofVTRS trades at a P/E of ~4 as does TEVA, and after much head scratching and painstaking analysis, I concluded that the P/E penalty from the negative top line growth in these generic/off patent pharma portfolios is quite severe, and my DCF modeling corroborated thisBased on the above, I would expect Organon shares to eventually settle in a $28-35 range; that said, if management is able to find ways to credibly reverse the top line declines and actually find some growth, it mag turn out to be a different story altogetherThey weren’t able to do this in many years of trying under MRK (which is a well respected management team), so I am relatively skeptical that there is a silver bullet that new management has, but let’s see"
"Just got in, Great company with a huge upside, ton of established products in the pipeline. This is a money maker company !"
How awesome would it be if they announced a buyback authorized up to 50 million shares and they nocked off 10 to 20 million shares under 30.
What changed from yesterday? I was hoping to buy more under 30.
You guys bought too high
"Per BarronsOrganon isn't as cheap when valued against projected 2021 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, of $2.3 billion, based on its enterprise value of equity value plus net debt. Then, it trades around eight times, in line with mature drug companies."
P/E of 5 Huge beat on earnings!
"Some interesting from BK filling.” Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRK A said on Monday it has shed its holdings of drugmaker Biogen Inc BIIB and paint maker Axalta Coating Systems Ltd AXTA, while taking a new stake in another pharmaceutical company, Organon & Co OGN.The changes were disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed holdings as of June 30.”."
"Don’t care much for the day to day developments, except this type of crazy volatility does present some good buying opportunities. I will be buying more"
"Looks like the price has kind of stabilized (not free falling like the first week), so I added today at 30.57. Seems like a decent price."
"Consider the track record of Merck spin-offs, i.e. MEDCO/Express Scripts, and you see a solid value play over time. I expect the same for OGN. GLTL"
The bottom is somewhere between 15 and 20 bucks
10 Q filed....The company is affirming the full year guidance which included expected revenue in the range of $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion and Adjusted EBITDA margin in a range of 36.0% to 38.0% for full year 2021. 2.25 to 2.5 billion in EBITDA. A fair valuation is 10 to 12 times EV to EBITDA. 253 million shares x 30 = 7.6 billion + 9 billion net debt = EV of 16.6 billion. If we were at 22 to 25 billion that would be an additional 7 billion or a double from 30 to 60/share.
I will be interested to see the 13F filings coming by Aug 15.
"Howie, how do you know the div well be 4%? Have not seen anything on that."
OGN is a big value stock with low PE and great dividend. Buy.
"I want to get familiar with OGN. Very little financial information. That tells me this leadership team is weak. Three segment products. Women $1.6B revenue, Biosimilar (unclear), Established ($4.5B). A total of minimal $6B. The current market cap is $8B. This is an extremely undervalued stock. If revenue remains the same in 2021 without any growth, the stock price should be at $40-$60. Either the management team failed to communication effectively or the products are not as good as said under Merck."
when are they going to announce their dividend policy?????
i think the ebita is around ten bucks a share?
"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, bought $OGN according to 13F.."
How many shares for 100 MRK?
This company alone makes over $8.00 per share. Look for a nice dividend coming!
"Upon the separation, Organon will have approximately 9,950 employees worldwide, with approximately 4,030 employees focusing on sales, marketing and key commercialization activities and approximately 730 employees focusing on clinical development, safety, and medical affairs and product registration. Additionally, we expect to operate six manufacturing sites globally and have approximately 3,020 manufacturing employees."
$56 stock price potential now...great time to buy!! if they announce divie will be a long term winner!
per yahoo analysts have a 39 target. Based on what?
Question for investors that received cash in their accounts in lieu of fractional OGN shares:What was the price that MRK used to credit the cash for the fractional shares? Is it in line with the OGN.WI closing price from last night? or did they use a different theoretical value?
Interesting price action today
Not Bad OGN IR team....Make sure to add some closing remarks to Q3.
Bought 250 shares. Looking to add more if price falls to 28 handle
Someone succeeded in taking down my post on Daily Average Volume. Organon has higher daily trading volume than Amazon (1.6 trillion market cap) since the start of trading.
3.7% yield is a beautiful thing
Welcome me to the family 
Another 5 percent day!
"Look at the performance of top selling Organon brands. Q1 2021 vs Q1 2020 (mUSD) - sales based on Merck 10Q:Implanon/Nexplanon $183 $195 NuvaRing 45 63 Zetia 92 145Atozet 122 122Arcoxia 56 70 Nasonex 43 71 Sungalair 107 155Organon’s portfolio will be led by the Nexplanon/Implanon contraceptive implant, which saw sales decline by 14% in 2020 to $680 million, mainly due to women delaying or canceling elective surgery during the pandemic. In 2019, the product enjoyed 12% growth. Looking beyond the pandemic, Organon expects Nexplanon to be the company’s first blockbuster product in women’s health.Its other contraceptive product, NuvaRing, hauled in $236 million last year as sales plummeted by 73% on generic competition that kicked off in the U.S. in December 2019."
If MRK didn't think it was worth keeping who am I to argue. Selling my shares as soon as they show in my Robinhood account.
tomorrow should give back half of today's gains
OGN BGS ATLC ATLCP
bet by .30 if this was a tech company it would be up 100.
Investing is about buying future dollar bills. There are thousands of choices. OGN is the second cheapest stock in the S&P 500 in terms of earnings.
this is dead money.....mrk just selling off old products they don't want and forming this company..
When will Humara drug come off patent protection? ORN has the generic to replace this best selling drug and should accelerate in value when this becomes an option for patients.
"amazing, drops $10. from it's high in 5 days with no bounce."
mrk must be dumping their remaining shares
Why is this stock so cheap ? With Berkshire endorsement it should be trading up . Hopefully gets a major review in Barron’s today
shouldn't comes as a surprise it was pushed under 30 for options expiration
"A break solidly above $32 on high volume and decent strength into the close. I could imagine price retesting $32, but everything appears to me to suggest the path of least resistance is higher. This is what the stock price needed, I think."

"OGN NEWS: ''Avestria Ventures Closes Fund IBY Business Wire— 9:30 AM ET 08/26/2021Avestria Ventures is a San Francisco-Bay Area venture capital firm focused on women’s health and female-led life sciences companiesSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Avestria Ventures, a Bay Area-based life sciences venture fund, has closed Avestria Ventures Fund I.Founded by veteran life science industry executives Linda Greub and Corinne Nevinny, Avestria invests in early-stage women’s health companies and female-led life science ventures.Avestria seeks to generate strong returns by focusing on these two under-invested sectors. Although the NIH has accepted sex as a biological variable since 2016, less than 1% of the venture capital invested in the $4T US healthcare industry was directed towards women’s health in 2020 according to Pitchbook Inc. Similarly, only 2.3% of venture capital was invested in female-led companies last year, even though female-led teams generate a 35% higher ROI than all-male teams.“Men still represent approximately 85% of the investment partners at venture capital firms,” Greub summarized, “and many of them are missing out on great investment opportunities when they underinvest in women’s health and female entrepreneurs.”Avestria closed Fund I to new investors due to the June 16th acquisition of its portfolio company Alydia Health for up to $240M by Organon , a global women’s health company. Uqora, a second Avestria portfolio company, was acquired on July 1st by Pharmavite for an undisclosed amount.“We believe that both of our focus areas – women’s health and female-led life science companies – are ripe for innovation,” Greub concludes. “And the two exits we’ve already had indicate that strategic investors are beginning to draw the same conclusion.” """"OGN STOCK WILL RISE IN THE FUTURE."
BUFFETT probably is very surprise to hear about OGN declared its first dividend of .28 and I thinkhe might add more position to the OGN stock... He is in favor of both VALUE and GROWTH stocks.FYI: health care sector which OGN is a part of is now the leading sector among all sector performances right now. Money managers are moving monies into this sector and so do I.Great dividend plus recommended by Citigroup with a BUY rating and price increased from $35 to $43 this morning...
The only people making money on this spin-off are the consultants and Wall Streeters who pushed the deal...plus the over paid exec's. Just a bunch of off patent drugs with low margins and small hope for growth.
"Do yourselves a favor and search for ""Independent from Merck, Organon CEO lays out newco's women's health ambitions, M&A plans"" on google. Fierce Pharma article."
MRK close 75.87. OGN-WI last trade was around 35.41.....BUT remember the spread was generally more than a dime and there are multiple exchanges and the accurate share prices are not always reported. Institutional arbitrage is the name of the game.
Looks to me like hedge funds shorting knowing people will be dumping their shares they can bring it way down and i have been buying all this way down and i am really loosing. I sure hope some large funds start buying
Hum...... that .28c div is expensive to pay for .......
anyone know TRCs prime broker?
When will the interim result be published? Thanks
The move higher appears to be on. Momentum algos will chase and raise the price. 100K plus share order after it crossed 30.
4 in a row tomorrow with 40 by EOY....Waiting for knock down shares from MMs (Market Manipulators)...They usually show up week or two after a run up shaking the trees to cover shares from weak retailers...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always....
"CNBC mentioning Buffett holding. The stock is cheap, but people, the guy didn't tell you that it was likely because Berkshire held Merck and all Merck shareholders received 1 share of Organon for every 10 shares of Merck they held on May 17, 2021."
"Hadlima (adalimumab) was launched in Australia and Canada. I believe it will be introduced in the US in 2023. Hadlima (adalimumab) is a biologic medicine that helps the pain and swelling of arthritis. It is a biosimilar to ABBV's Humira. Hadlima is used to treat Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Juvenile Inflammatory Arthritis, Psoriasis, Crohn’s Disease, Hidradentitis, Iritis, and other diseases.The market is $20 billion plus for this drug based on ABBV sales information. So I would expect Organon to pick up billions in sales over the next few years. 2019 was the first year the drug faced competition from biosimilars in Europe. As a result, ABBV international sales fell by 31%. In the United States, Humira accounted for $16.1 billion of ABBV sales, as compared to $14.9 in 2019."
Told you!!! See my last post on OGN.
still heavy dumping of this one...I did buy too early...will wait for now. Boolean

Net income fell to $427 million, or $1.68 a share, from $542 million, or $2.14 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding nonrecurring items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.72. The results beat the Wall Street EPS consensus of $1.42, according to FactSet.

Organon volume of trading is almost 8 Million shares compared with Merck with just over 6 million shares at this time. Organon has only 1 tenth the number of shares as Merck as per the distribution of 1 share per every 10 Merck shares. I would assume massive dumping is the reason for the volume. Hopefully after the dumping is completed the shares might recover to a higher price as selling pressure ends. There should be about 253 million shares issued to investors in Merck. The dumping might take a few more days assuming some dumping was done when the stock was trading on a when issued basis.
I just want to know who thought that name was a good idea. #fired
"fact is, OGN makes far too much money, has p/e, p/b, p/s ratios that are currently out of this world in a good way... fact is, the pps deserves to be a lot higher, and it will be. it's just a matter of time, a matter of when the forced sellers are finally done selling, and the market wakes up to a sleeping giant with trading multiples that are ridiculously low. this should settle in the 45-55 range.... just may take a month or two"
New price target $39
Looks like Merck shareholder institutions don;t want to hold OGN. MRK and OGN are different company. That's the reason PPS is down. Once they finish selling PPS will start to head up quickly!Buy here on cheap based on valuation. Good profit margin but slow growth the reason for MRK to spin off!Selling at discount based on any valuiation!GLTA in stock casino!
Looks like the funds have started adding OGN for their index funds

Here is my Gary post of the day....Organon worth 70 dollars.
"Watching this go into the dumpster after the Merck spinoff. BUT holding and waiting for a bottom to pick up more shares at a bargain. Why?Merck reported there will be about 250 million shares outstanding once the spinoff occurs. This means that its pro forma market capitalization is about $8.9 billion (i.e., 250 million shares x $35.75 per share).However, this is not a fully diluted number. Moreover, the latest 10-Q filing from Merck on May 5 shows there are 2.532 billion MRK common shares outstanding. This implies that on a 1-for-10 spinoff basis, there will be 253.2 million shares outstanding. That raises the market value to $9.05 billion.This is too cheap a valuation. For example, Merck trades for about 16 times its trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA. On an adjusted EBITDA basis, it is at about eight times or so. Therefore, even using a 20% discount, Organon stock should be at 6.4 times adjusted EBITDA.That would put its market value at $17.92 billion. After deducting the net debt of $4.635 billion, the equity market value is $13.285 billion. This is 47.6% higher than when-issued market value of $9 billion. And with the selloff it's getting even cheaper.Merck shareholders that haven't done any due diligence are simply selling their newly acquired shares. I smell opportunity."
OGN trading 33 and change. Don't expect to use this page as the price is static. Lots of noise in the first few weeks of trading. The management did ring the opening bell on the NYSE.
So Buffet just took a position in this company. Interesting buy!
sell the news
when do we start getting dividends
I thought this stock would trade for more.....
Does this company have more revenue than its market cap? Why stock price is going down?
"Stock trading for 6 times expected earnings, with a yield north of 4%. There will be buyers by the end of the day and I wont be surprised if it closes north of 34. The same trading algorithms/patterns will push the stock down in the first half of the day and buyers will likely come in late. Remember, that OGN has to be acquired by S&P 500 index players."
above 28.25 will be a big improvement for this.
"at anybody what does this company actually do?received shares from Merck,and cannot find any info."
"This drop in price in a company that is GUARANTEED to come close to matching last year's revenue, that will pay out a significant dividend, and is likely to have a better chance at growing the business alone then as part of Merck is nonsensical----but a fantastic buying opportunity. I have increased my position 10 fold already from what I got in the spinoff. 2 recent price targets of $35, and $48. I have no idea why the stock is dropping, but my guess is that the shareholders are selling their spinoff shares and taking the money. That's actually what I did first, but I sold around $33.50, and like I said, now have 10 times the shares I sold at a much lower price. I have more buy orders in for today also."
this premarket drop looks like the sign of REVERSAL DAY...I don't believe the drop will portend the outcome today. We shall see...the only concern is the % drops have been severe and consistent so catching the proverbial falling knife is not how I will play this... Boolean
i picked up new shares since i saw what the pe is. looks like this management team should be running merckespecially after frazier swallowed the shyneeze narrative and the greatest research labs in the world did nothing for the biggest threat to human health in 100 years
20 bucks come Friday. Short interest is up huge
Too funny the Fast Money people are pumping MCD at 21X and Cisco at over 20X. J&J 19X. Better buy OGN at 6X
Has anybody else here not received their cash in lieu of OGN fractional shares? 29 shares of Merck in Vanguard account shows 2 shares of OGN but no cash in lieu credited in the transactions for the remaining fractional shares.
More manipulation is expected leading into Aug 12. 5 trading days left. Nothing to really read unless we see more than 3 million in volume.
what was promising is the market violently sold off at the close and this pushed off the lows at that same time
Looks like it is finding its footing around $28.00....... Still waiting a bit before loading up substantially..... the sale might not be over........ but no way to find out if that is true or not....... MF usually load up AH....... and just don't know what's going on.
So glad I Invested at high 28. I received a small amount from the split and then decided to get more. Thank you for all your postings Howie.
Start of a new quarter. Come 9/30/2021 I would anticipate we will have seen a 20% plus move.
Give me a good reason why I shouldn’t sell
Schwab rating went from A to B to NR / Not Covered in less than 2 weeks.
debt very high
ABBV Investor here which means I also have my eye on MRK and now OGN.I did a quick search on the debt per share of OGN and did not find anything conclusive.More often than not when a parent company does a spinoff they tend to load it up with debt to increase the health of the parent company. Anybody have any hard #'s on this ?
It is worth reading the Viatris conference call transcript to get a sense of what we will likely hear tomorrow.
This is a small cap company…if I read it right it’s selling at 1 x sales so it should have a lot of upside?
"Let see how long this post stays up for....It is obvious that a concerted effort to push the share price lower in the last few weeks leading up to the Mini Tender Offer deadline has occurred (similar volume, similar patterns, etc). It is now below the 28.63 price three trading days prior to the deadline."
"Here is an interesting relative valuation comparison. Eaton (ETN) vs. Organon (OGN)Trailing Twelve Month NumbersOrganon Revenue $7.8 billion, Eaton $17.76 billionOrganon EBITDA $2.58 billion, Eaton $2.73 billionOrganon Op Cash Flow $3 billion, Eaton $2.88 billionOGN Shares Outstanding 253 million, ETN Shares Outstanding 398 millionOGN Market Capitalization $7.44 billion, ETN Market Capitalization $61.86 billion."
Close to 2 million shares in 15 minutes and we were positive.
look at that buying near the close. from 28.28 to 28.80 now
Great earnings and now a dividend- should be $60 stock sometime soon. Worth at minimum a 10 PE.
"Tomorrow is the day this goes live. I don't believe the ""When Issued"" trading of both Organon or Merck was very effective. It would be interesting to hear from Merck Investor Relations on their thoughts."
Well lets see how long the price stays under the MINI TENDER OFFER PRICE of 28.63. Prime broker should be doing their job picking up 3 million shares for TRC.
Revenue forecasts of 6.1 to 6.4 billion.Cap Ex going forward is targeted at roughly 3 to 4% of revenue.Debt expense 400 millionDividend 285 million.
assume they will announce dividend on 12th w earnings?
Howie..........Where did you dig up the info on $ 1.50 divvy a share?Just curious.
the bond market has been rallying lately. inflation data coming out tomorrow. the bond market does not seem to think it is rising as fast as thought. this could be good for this
Added some at 28.95 this morning.
Big beat. Plus DIV announcement. Boom!
why did they spin-off ? are they getting rid of some not so good divisions ? I justbheard about this stock ..
Anyone else who hasn't received their OGN shares yet?
"It is all in the story, forget fundamentals.....Organon or Beyond Meat? Both market caps at roughly 7.5 billion. Beyond Meat (BYND) less than 500 million in revenue, Organon over 7 billion in revenue. Earnings and Cash Flow.....forget it.....Beyond Meat, no earnings negative and negative free cash flow of more than 100 million, Organon earnings of 1.8 billion, cash flow of 2.7 billion."
"Do you guys remember when Hoffman LaRoche wanted to buy ILMN for $49.00 a share........ and the company said ""No Way""!Check the pps for ILMN today........So........No way TRC........ we keep our shares....... and if you want some...... buy on the open market."
Ex divi on 8/20 .28
I took a 25% position at 33 so looking to average down when it appears the fire sale is over...I knew I could be early and was why I took it 33 but was wrong on the price but right on the small percentage of goal...I still like the play. Boolean
This stock is heading to the teens. Get out while you can and buy it again later
here we go again.
Imagine if Robin Hood/Reddit gets news of this drop?
"Marisa H: the expectation of an OGN dividend is speculative. OGN now controls the cash flow of an established product line. But in funding the spin-off OGN increase its debt significantly. So, will it now use cash flow to pay down that debt, to reward shareholders, or both? The bet is on a modest dividend comparable to OGN's contribution to MRK's 3% dividend. If OGN announces such its share price will likely rise, if not it will likely fall or stagnate."
"Pretty good trading action in the first 15 minutes. I have to laugh if it is buying on it showing up on the Berkshire 13 F. I suppose it is, maybe those after hours trades going off north of 35 yesterday were some trying to get ahead of the action. Looks like Berkshire was holding roughly 15.5 million MRK shares on May 17, the record date for the spin off. By 6/30 they dropped their holding in Merck to 9.2 million shares.Well we will have to wait and see. It isn't the smallest Berkshire portfolio holding as of 6/30.....P&G, Liberty Latin America, Mondelez, SPY, VOO all smaller"
Timber!!!!!!
"Finally, people selling off the stub may be done. I added down to the bottom, but sort of wish I had realized people would be selling for several days not just the one. Generally it does take people a few days to notice the split and when this small a stub, they tend to sell it. Long and strong"
"$40 on Thurs,"

"Are OGN press releases not permitted due to 30 day ""quiet period"" like an IPOand stocks within a 30day window before reporting qtr. earnings?? Or is thereNO 30 day quiet period for ""spinoffs""?? Thanks for honest replies."
OGN does have a nice pipe line. What do you think this is worth seriously?
Only regret is not buying more below 30$ haha
Pretty soon Wall Street analysts will start their coverage of Organon. My advice to any short sellers out there; CAVEAT EMPTOR.
tanking-really? the P/E is like 5. just loaded up on the stock and the calls
market ready to tank..all boats will sink in next couple of months..my target is $20 for this
A couple of executives were able to get some stock at 28.63. Looks a lot better than 36.05.
You guys will chase this #$%$ to the teens.
STOCKS that Warren Buffett owns: KR and OGN.KR has been UP almost everyday and continue hitting new HIGH everyday this week. OGN has not followedthat trend....including today's. OGN sell off as it is ex-dividend today....and it should rebound soon.It was $36 in the week and it is 33.45...Expect to see rebounding to 36 by early next week....
"Short still ok with PPS below 35. I suspect they shorted somewhere between 33-37...BTW, shorts will have to pay 28 cent div on Friday if they don;t close out positions before then....What a disaster this stock is with such low PE and not much to show with growth. We will see where we are in a years. It could double then again it may not and stagnate in the 30s...Mostly accumulation rather than short covering here is last couple of days...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always..."
Vanguard stepped up to the plate buying at this level according to 13 G
I would expect the hedge funds are pushing OGN down hoping to shake out the little guy. The 13Fs show they totally missed OGN as an investment and now need your shares!
Choo choo! 15 bucks!!!
nice pop today

"Here are some numbers on the Organon business. Sales have declined for the last three years, but the management believes there will be positive growth going forward. Read the FORM 10 that was put out.You can search for Organon FORM 10.2020 Sales 6.5 billion2019 Sales 7.8 billion2018 Sales 8.3 billion In 2020, the Organon Products segment generated approximately $2.3 billion in operating cash flowand spent $255 million on capital expenditures. The Organon Products segment also generatedAdjusted EBITDA of $3.1 billion on $6.5 billion of sales, representing an EBITDA margin ofapproximately 47%. We expect that 2021 operating cash flow from the Organon Products Segment willbe comparable to, though slightly down from, 2020 before the impact of estimated interest expense.We anticipate we will continue to generate significant cash flow and expect our operating leverage toimprove in the future.There will be roughly 253 million shares outstanding. Sales per share of roughly 26/share. Adjusted EBITDA/Share of roughly 12.25. Net Income of roughly 2 billion pro forma. With 253 million shares.... Earnings per share of roughly 6 to 8/share.Dividend payout will be target in the low 20% range. Assuming 20% and a Net Income around 2 billion, that is roughly 400 million in dividend payments. 400 million to 253 million shares is 1.58/share. Stock is trading at 36 today. 4.4% yield."
Debt greater than market cap
I think we could see 1.20/share dividend. At 29.45 equals a yield of 4.07%253 million shares x 1.20 = 304 million in dividend payments which is 22% of a forecasted 1.4 billion in Adjusted Net Income.
Quarterly Earnings Growth (yoy) -43.20% -Why is the earnings growth down so much?
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but the way I read the PR, MRK would create Organon shares on 5/17 based on 1/10th share of OGN for each share of MRK outstanding. That had nothing at all to do with the distribution of the shares. The ""special dividend"" would be paid and distributed after the close of the market on June 2nd. So---tomorrow at some point OGN will begin officially trading(even though it has been trading as a W-I---when issued stock already) and each MRK shareholder as of the close of business today will receive their shares of OGN. I suppose the share price of MRK will drop reflecting the distributed value of Organon since that's normally the way dividends work. I guess I'll find out if I'm right tomorrow since I bought all of my MRK shares recently after the 5/17 creation date."
"Don't be surprised if the next 13f shows berkshire owning little to no OGN. Berkshire cut their investment in MRK significantly no reason to think they wouldn't do the same for OGN. At least MRK is expected to have double digit growth and price target almost 20% above where it is now in a year per yahoo projection. OGN no growth but has a good and probably stable dividend.In fact Berkshire probably got out of the OGN they were allocated as a MRK holder, at the recent highs in the 36 range. Time will tell.Occam's Razor and do what makes good common sense, you will win everytime."
Barron's out with an Undervalued piece. Forbes has a nice article on Organon as well in case you missed it.
"Look at the company: women’s health is a major market now. The stock has great value, volatile though, but in my opinion a goof long term stock. I plan to buy more shortly."
Maybe it is time for Gensler and the SEC TIP line to get an email. Announcement OBSV up 30% and OGN down? Are the market rational or gammed? Two or three deals have been announced and they stock continues to be down day after day.
"they posted more data on AMTD for OGN. Earnings of 1.55/1.48/1.53/1.55 for Q1 through Q4 2021. Of course, Q1 was under MRK and an estimate that won't be confirmed. sales in the 8B plus area. Cash of ca. 80MM but we know that's wrong. cash flow of ca. 2.5B. 250.6MM float. 253.2MM OS shares."
"So if you don't think some will go to extended lengths to make money, if my comment about TRC is continuously removed, and they are willing to issue a tender offer below market price, it should give you an idea of what large funds would and can do to make money. TRC is miniscule compared to what is out there."
A few hundred thousand shares around 36 to get the ball rolling. Should be a good day.
if it means anything 9trading website sees support for OGN @ 31.18 with a pivot price of 32.70 Good luck with thatmakes more sense to me at or below 30
"Spun off from MRK just about 45 days ago - majority of MRK stock holders sold the position. First set of EPS, Revs, etc. will be out in early August. Citi just issued a buy on Friday. Most analysts are waiting to issue their recommendations until they see the first quarter post MRK. I believe that OGN will announce a dividend of about 3% in early August when they release earnings and I believe that the loss of revenues will be less than expected and that earnings will be better than expected. I believe it will be trading at 34-35 right before and after earnings and possible higher. Will need to be bought by more funds to balance their S&P 500 ETFs. With a market that is at all time highs, I believe that this a conservative pick with potential of 10-20% appreciation short term."
20 dollar stock! Sell
how much of OGN if any did Merck retain? anyone?
"$80 a share fair value at a PE of 10 - Industry average 25-30. Considering the earnings and now a dividend, this is a bargain, and I strongly feel the stock will see $100 in one year based solely on fundaments of earnings, earnings growth, dividend (and likely increased dividends), and WAY below industry overage PE- ridiculous at a PE of 5???"
"my unsolicited opinion: there’s value under 27, but at 30 I’d move on to something else"

If this was so bad like probably TRC paid bashers say on the YB........ why is TRC trying to buy 1.8% of the company ??? Huh ?
"Unfortunately you have one incorrect number. Net debt is $9B not 4.5B.So, EV is currently at $16.5 B which is something close to 7.2 x EBiTDA in 2021 so still with potential of -20-25 drop in share price."

15 dollar stock
"There is so much uncertainty with the stock as it is a new spin off. The price action with Viatris may have contributed to the decline in the stock. Guidance can change once the company has been independent for a few months. A large number of shares were dumped early today at low prices. Without a dividend some investors do not want to own this stock. After a few months, Organon will likely announce a dividend to please the investors. As with Viatris, a Pfizer spin off, a dividend helped firm up the stock price. I would not be surprised if the stock hits today's low range under $28 again. I am interested in buying more of the stock under $28 as it should be able to reduce its debt and increase its dividend over time. As this is not an IPO with a backstop firm protecting the opening share price, it has no promoters to keep the price up."
Buy order for OGN in at $28.60. Seems like a decent price to make a purchase. Wonder if it will get there today?
I own 10k shares of MRK. After the spin got 1k of OGN @14.04/share. I see some people say they got OGN at 30 or so per share. Can someone explain to me how mine is so low. I have been in MRK very long time. Is that the reason?
"Anyone listening Citigroup's biopharma conference?JERSEY CITY, N.J., September 01, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Organon (NYSE: OGN), announced today that Kevin Ali, Chief Executive Officer, and Matthew Walsh, Chief Financial Officer, are scheduled to participate in a fireside chat at Citi’s 16th Annual BioPharma Virtual Conference on Friday, September 10, 2021 at 9:45 a.m. EDT."
TRC stated in the mini-tender offer that its offer price of $28.63 per share is approximately 4.5% lower than the $29.98 closing price per share of Organon common stockI will buy apple for 100 ok shareholders?
Last few days the algos keep taking the price higher. Seems some want to sneak into a pre 4% yield and 1/4 the multiple of the S&P 500. My bet is we don't see sub 30 again unless the market drop 5% plus prior to year end.
Merck turned in strong Q2 growth in China. Will we see a similar uptick within Organon?
this is down a whopping $10 due to all this uncertainty selling. at this point this could be a great value. no way of knowing
"Larry Ramer's negative piece says the relative valuation under 5 times earnings is warranted given the expectation of low growth, low growth acquisitions and low cash balance."
"When the music stops playing, I would prefer to own companies that have strong cash flow relative to price."
Talk is $1.30 dividend. When that will happen will be something I need to see to believe.
3.6% yield growing 3 to 5% worth? 5 times with the 10 year US treasury at 1.35% (rates lower internationally)? Nonsense.
"I normally cry bunk at the folks who claim ""manipulation"" from ""the big funds in the sky"".However, OGN is manipulated on almost a daily basis through small-volume waterfall sales on the shoulders of the trading day, especially just after 9:30 AM but also after hours where there is frequently a tamp-down effort. I think it's a project of opportunity created because there is very little following of OGN as yet and no hard financial data. Obviously that will change August 12. Also the current volume. On quite a few trading days volume is much lower than average and very thin at the trading day shoulders. This is when the tamp-downs always happen.Hopefully management bring some positive results out on the 12th allowing analysts to chime in with some buy ratings, and volume will come up putting an end to this little project...."
"fidelity says $1.88 dividend (overview), next page over (detail), it says OGN doesn't pay dividendsanyone know what is going on here?"
Partnership between OGN and OBSV announced.
"According to this article this should be above $50. If the numbers are correct, it is very cheap here at $29"
This happens with every single pharma spin-off. People have zero patience. Well at least it will provide a good buying opportunity when the bleeding eventually stops (might not happens before they announce first dividend or full quarter earnings)
Going nowhere...dead money!!
still long way off May highs of $38...
So Buffet's into OGN. Well it is after all a cash cow with PE trading around 5-6 and generating 1.6B in profits...Hard to figure where PPS will be with low single digit growth. Seems like value invetor like Buffet and Vanguard are loading up...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always...
positive earnings leak?
"by any metric still undervalued, see 40 by eoy, nice initial divy. and 20% gain with a conservative stock. nice pick in this mkt"
