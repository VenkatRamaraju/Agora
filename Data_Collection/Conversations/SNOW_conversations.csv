"There are soooooooooo many companies trading at between 40 and 100 times REVENUE. Historically, as in every single time in history, stocks have crashed at levels far below this. Absolute insanity."
What a snow job
Not more than $80
"Less than 1M shares traded, no news and up $9.00+... Really?? even if you're long you can't believe this is going to stay here"
Up $65 since Oct 4th... makes perfect sense
It's going to get burst any moment. I am looking for $200 !
ready for $200
100B market cap for this!?How crazy is this market??
"up once again? On 150,000 shares?? Only up? Never down? Something aint right here."
"Question: why are we paying nearly 120 times annual revenue for this company? even if they grow 37% per year, if would take like 5-10 years for this company to be a 100 billion dollar company... Puts on Monday? Snow can easily go to less than 100 if the markets sour"
"You've probably heard people say Tesla is expensive. And it is, but let me quickly breakdown how insanely different Tesla is from Snowflake: TSLA is trading at 19x annual sales revenue. SNOW is trading at 130x annual sales revenue!!!! This is almost 7 times more overvalued than Tesla, but it doesn't have close to the potential of Tesla. If Tesla is an expensive stock (which lets be honest it is, but at least it's buyable), then Snowflake is just priced at pure insanity. Snowflake could easily be trading at $50 just 12 months from now."
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
You cannot grow a company fast enough to justify a current price to sales ratio of 117x. This stock price has to crash at some point. SNOW117.40xIndustry23.42x
I was lying. I just cant do it. I can't buy something that is tradintg at over 100 times revenue. I just cant do it
I bought snow @337 a year ago. Should i sell it now to breakeven or hold it for few more weeks/months?
Back to $295 next week. I love FOMC.
"What a nice day, how are we doing bears?"
$1B in insider sales post ipo(not inclusive of the sales during the IPO). Tells me enough. Will buy this below $200 but not here.
I have been told for 40 years that fundamentals matter. That ALL stocks will eventually trade on their fundamentals. That profits matter. I was actually taught that is what makes the stock market work. That profits are what will propel a stock higher. I just don't get it anymore I guess. I am too old to understand all this making more money not working than working. I don't understand how a computer image can sell for millions of dollars. That I can OWN a picture on the internet if I just pay someone millions or hundreds of thousands of dollars. I guess that is the new thing. I am gonna head to the mountains and go deer and ginseng hunting. It doesn't seem right to be able to invest 10 bucks and have that ten bucks be worth hundreds of millions in ten years or what ever it is. I think Ron Paul was our last chance.
Like I said before .. big money buying small amounts of shares to drive it up. When they cash out it's going to fall like a rock
"Very easy to make money in this new age market. Too many amateurs with zero regard for valuation. Following their favourite “fintwit guru” and blindly buying companies at obscene valuations. Wake up amateur, the growth is baked into the price until 2050. The Most fairly valued stock in the market is $BABA, Canadian banks, and a handful of others. $UPST, TSLA, $SNOW are being bought by clowns who don’t even know what the companies do and can’t make simple calculations"
To $30!
Something is definitely not right here. The Nasdaq index is going down today while SNOW is going up?
"Investors should buy the best hyper growth stock ZM while it is still super cheap. If Zoom were to trade at Snowflake (SNOW) level of valuation, ZM would be trading at more than $1200. If that happens, longs would be up 400%, but shorts would be down 400%. It is obviously better to be on the long side of this excellent hyper growth stock. Best hyper growth company Zoom is growing very fast and trading at very cheap valuation. And Zoom is already profitable. Cathie Wood bargain hunted and bought more Zoom (ZM) stocks. You should do the same to bargain hunt and buy ZM stocks while ZM is still super cheap. There are a lot of companies like SNOW, PLTR, LMND, NET, AI, TEAM, CRWD, ZS, etc. that are not even able to turn profitable. It is not smart for anyone to be short selling very profitable hyper growth cheap stock ZM when there are many money losing companies like $SNOW that are a lot more expensive on the market that are a lot better short targets. Investors should take the opportunity to buy the best fast growing very profitable Zoom while it is still super cheap right now. If anyone wants to short, one should short money losing companies like SNOW. Zoom quarterly revenues are 3.75 times larger than SNOW. And even Zoom profits alone are larger than SNOW revenues. But SNOW market cap is $102 billion while ZM market cap is only $82 billion. ZM is a super cheap stock! If we use SNOW valuation to calculate for ZM, ZM would be trading at $380 billion market cap and that translates to a lot more than $1200 stock price for ZM. If shorts want to short stocks, shorting almost four times more expensive money losing company SNOW makes a lot better sense than shorting super cheap great profitable company ZM. Smart investors should take the opportunity to bargain hunt and buy ZM just like Cathie Wood. It is not smart to still be on the short side of this super cheap growth stock. Excellent company Zoom grew revenues by 1000% in the past four years. Zoom has been growing fast way before pandemic. And Zoom will continue to grow after pandemic. Zoom is only starting to get into the $1.4 trillion Enterprise Communication market. There are still many years of growth ahead for this great hyper growth company Zoom. Ark Invest research expects this great growth company to grow another 4 folds in the next 5 years. Buy ZM."
Based on the earnings in software tonight I expect a big down day in SNOW tomorrow
"Buy when this drops to 200, and it will. You'll be happy you waited. You definitely won't lose your money and you stand to get in at a great price. Everyone will be taking losses."
JPM raises target to $350 - you know what that means. They're planning an exit.
I don't think that SNOW has another 10% in gains in it. Looks pretty bad here. I actually found http://alert-sounds.com/ the other day and their stocks are way better...
IBM vs SNOW.. Hmm which one is a better buy?? One pays a dividend of $6.50..One pays nothing. One has 75 billion in revenue and is a n internationally known and well known company. One went public a year ago. Yet both are valued at around 100 billion dollars. The world is a very evil place.
After being short this stock and understanding its movements its very simple. This stock is 100% correlated to nasdaq... when qqq go up it goes up when qqq down it goes down... algos are manipulating the stock based on that algorithm
This stock is now trading at 126x sales. I'm in total shock how these institutional owners are pushing the stock higher and higher on such measly volume. Do they understand that at some point are going to have to sell their shares? Are the retail investors so clueless that they would purchase shares here at this level?

Biggest software IPO of all time and crickets on here. Something is not right.
"I am sure Buffett has some stop loss orders at $200. Once the big guys bail, this stock will crash to $30 or less."
Anyone done a calc on what 10B in revenue does for EPS? Cuz that's what they say they're aiming for. Fine if you don't believe it's possible (I'd like to hear reasons why) -- if not the current price momentum might be justified if you discount future earnings.
but of course this 800 million dolaar company should be worth more than IBM. If IBM were valued the same way SNOW is IBM would be worth somewhere around 7.5 trilliono dollars!!!!!!!!! IBM has 75 times as much revenue as SNOW!!! And it pays a nice $6.50 dividend!!! Nothing makes sense in this world anymore.
This is absolutely a group of institutional investors colluding with one another in the options market. There is no other explanation.
I don’t care what you tell me this isn’t worth $100B.
no volume yet up another 6 bucks.
