For those that need a good laugh.pops23 hours agoReplied to a reaction$SNOW conversationWow!God is punishing you for short selling. Short selling is the devils work
PUMP PUMP.. pump this should be at $50 most
Predicted $300 by today. Was hoping for $300 before earnings. I took $300 after.
should be down 50 points tomorrow given downward guidance
"Strong support area around $242, in todays market specially! And to top it off it kept the gain and some towards the close! Momentum is definitely here and will continue to $255 plus area."
and herre comes the obvious end of day sell off. TIMBER!!!!!!!!!!
"I wish I could have invested in this stock (at the right price), but right off the bat it's trading a decade's valuation ahead of itself. Any founders, VCs, and employees hit the powerball jackpot early. IMO The best deals right now can be found in the de-SPAC market, if you know where to look."
so SNOW sees a path to 10B revenue by 2028!problem is it is valued for that TODAY in 2021.
"Some of the news/articles written about SNOW are proof that people are trying to manipulate the price of the stock. The one yesterday from Yahoo Finance talking about how SNOW is about to enter 'the most rewarding stage' is such a joke. And Yahoo Finance is highlighting the story again today and the Editiors pick. The only ones to benefit are the insiders, friends, employees and early investors who bought stock at or under IPO price. The current valuation can't even be justified using the projections given for the next 5+ years. Good luck to the retail investor without the deep pockets to manipulate the stock and pay for press."
"Okay, I decided to sell it, there is no immediate catalyst to move it from its current doldrums!!"
OMGMy supercomputer just reveled to me a stock price of $550 in 4 months
ALL IN TODAY LETS GO! $RIDE $RIOT $TRUL.CN $HYFM $SNOW
Warren and Charlie pumping ! Yawn
"Let's presume you make $10 Billion in revenue by 2028. And let's give you the benefit of doubt, meaning, you actually earn $3 B in profit on that revenue. That would be a PE ratio of 24.6 on todays market cap. My team will pass until 2028, and let's see where you are. Cheers!"
Can it surpass $300 before earnings?
The reporting on this stock is pathetic. Some sources saying earnings beat EPS of ($0.66) while other claiming a miss on EPS of ($0.15). Earnings where ($0.64). Some sources saying guidance beat for next quarter on $270.5M while other saying a miss on $292.33M. Guidance is $280-285. Talk about confusing...
"WOW! Snow is gonna get destroyed once they announce earnings. Just the way it is at a market top. People buy with the expectation that it will go up once they announce their wonderful numbers, and the big boys use that as an opportunity to get ythe hell out."
"SNOW stock price moves with the markets up & down to aGreat extend, which is not really good for the stock. It means it can give up all the gains in a matter of minutes and incurs losses at the same time. There just doesn’t seem to be any kind of conviction trades or a base to build on! It all seems like a day time trading! Although I am a investor here but having some doubt about its ability to garner support to move up and sustain gains!!"
"Put 2 dollars, get 1 dollar back. Amazing business model, definitely justifies 100x multiple."
Snow flakes now 
$SNOW announced support for Unified ID 2.0 to allow customers to optimize data-first advertising strategies by directly activating audiences on any platform with Unified ID 2.0.
"Finally it made a move, sold my position , will return when things settle down after the correction!"
Interesting reaction after hour:https://finance.yahoo.com/m/1e68908a-2d87-3ea0-86f5-7bd0722aed1e/snowflake-drops-on.html
"this is bs. first off why did i sold? cuz i knew this report wasnt going to be too desirable and judging from experience from various high profile stocks, with a not so amazing report usually comes with a drop but no not snowflake. did they predetermine that they are jumping in snowflake no matter what after earnings?"
i thought PLTR was overvalue but this was hyperovervalue lol
"Got my limit buy in at $199.5, lets go back to May"
$420 in 3 months.
"199 next week, then below 87"
"With this valuation, one might have thought Snowflake just cured cancer or something."
let's ask Cramer tonight in the Mad Money. he thinks the CEO is gonna make us Money.$$$$$$$
"Shorts are slow roasting, LMFAO.Enjoy your pain."
$254 Mil revenue is a joke for a $85B company. When this market implodes it will be because of valuations like this.
"So the insiders have had a good three months of selling. Demand has increased, and the balance has tipped. That means insider selling is lowered in the the equation from now on - and up we go."
Simply wild over valuation - who would buy something like this?
Back to the 400s we go.
this stock is 145 times of revenue and people say PLTR is overvalued...
"The way I see it, you can bash this stock on a Yahoo comment board.Or you can buy it and make some money. I chose the second option and I'm quite glad I did."
"Doing technical analysis can be quite different which is why most newbies/traders neglect day trading their coins and stick to holding which is very dangerous as when the market goes bearish, advise any newbies/traders to buy the dip for traders who are still wondering to enter the market or old time traders who are holders to seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 96% trade accuracy"
"$SNOW Weakness Said Tied to Cautious Analyst Note - Cleveland Research Report said partners are seeing sales cycles elongate on increased competition from hyperscalers, particulary GOOG BigQuery"
Bought at $250 and waited forever to break even. Should I sell now or wait?
"What is going on, any news?"
Looks like $300 next week imminent
Glad I only sold half my shares yesterday...
Next $314!!!$314!!!$314!!!
"Is $DDOG worth $33 billion? No, of course not! Is $YMM worth $17 billion? No, of course not! Is $SNOW worth $78 billion? No, of course not! But, they are worth that much because their floats are so small. Similarly, $NEGG, $AMZN lite, will be valued very highly, because the founders hold 99% of the shares."
Meme stock in the making
"Snowflake has an $82B market cap, only $700M in revenue, and they're losing money. And then you have sell side analysts who are cheerleaders. Sorry, it looks like it's time to take the other side of this trade in after hours."
"Yeah, as someone said below it was a report from Cleveland Research that caused the sell off!https://www.stocktargetadvisor.com/blog/snowflakesnownye-drops-on-cleveland-research-report-warning/"
Even mighty NVDA is trading at 25 times sales. Which is ridiculus but it aint 90x. Burn God burn
This is disaster
Oh wow! Even the analyst are starting to question SNOW valuation and future growth. Why does everyone always think that what ever stock they watch is the next AMZN? That blows my mind. SNOW is worth what it will be worth basically forever. People are just SOOOOOOOOOO greedy. They think it should be worth the same as MSFT or APPL or TSLA or NFLX....HAHAHAH... Say bye bye to this one.
Congrats to all longs whom got in a few days at down to $249
I guess the bad news about earnings has been whispered. I figured earnings were going to be horrible. That is why they released the news article about getting to 10 billion. BYE BYE SNOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am loving Montona. CEO must be hiking while the stock hits the bottom of Grand Canyon
Great time to BUY People it will be over $ 300.00 next month
Over bought
at this rate. gonna end up in the green! just some manipulation pre earnings
$275 today $300 easy next week.
$VENA $PLTR $SNOW call has begun. Let the fun begin
Yes ll I have to be is patient for this to get 10 billion in revenue in 2028. The stock can stay flat and get under 9 times sales. I have put every dollar I have margined to the max on this stock. The sun will come out and my fortune will melt away.
P/S over 100. I’m done with these kind of stocks for now. Jmho
"Where are we going today, my friends? :>)"
6.4 million shares on no news? You have to be kidding me.
50 times 2025 revenue estimates at this price is an crazy valuation
"$Oracle Oracle Cloud, the best!"
Grossly overvalued. Latest numbers still confirm it. I'm sure it will stay propped up like it has been. This is one of the chosen stocks that the big dogs park capital and then sell expensive options against it all day long.
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
TDC should be over $300 tomorrow.

It's over for this. I am buyer around 75.
Joke company... same Irrational trading happened in wayfair between 300-330 and I was short it. Eventually these overpriced stocks FALL
"Look at that increase in Fortune 500 customers and then ask yourself, why are the shorts making such a fuss today? LOL, it's because this is their best chance to cover before tomorrow's open. Please go ahead and short more; there are plenty of folks who will be glad to buy them up. My order is out there but you haven't dropped it as much as you claim it will drop."
worth to buy @ $26-$40/Share......
Sorting the wheat from the chaff. If u understand what they sell there is no competition
How are ye 'flakies who bought at $400+ doing? Believe in their five/ten year plan? Pie in the sky!
"People used to say the same about AMZN, it always was a bubble but look at it now"
"Don't own the stock, but with the poor earning report that missed the estimate. I will consider it as a great gift to exit."
"Trash numbers for a highly overrated company, and yet it goes up in AH. Welcome to Wall Street lmfao. Without Buffett, Snowflake would be below $100.."
SNOW options almost pay as well as ZM ... quickly becoming another favourite of mine 
103% y2y with revenue forecast for next quarter above previous estimates.
Yeah baby!
"Don’t worry, Kramer fitting to pin this stock!"
Wow I should have been buying dips all year I got trapped at 295 and just sort of forgot about it
How come no discussion about insiders constantly dumping shares ?
Once it loses $300 $290 comes. Quick.
"Been watching SNOW way before the IPO. Had to pounce on it after it cratered last May.These shorts are such a joke this bashing of great growth stocks has been going on forever(think aol message boards through the land lines back in the late 80's, I can still here thethe weird network connection sound). Don't let the laughable short post shake you out,if you do the jokes on you."
This stock is so irrational… it makes no sense at all.
"What a big fat bloated pig.ZM's yearly profits is more than SNOW's yearly sales, growing faster too. Yet SNOW is priced nearly as highas ZM."
"SNOW - ""In short, if you want a reason to worry about Snowflake, don't worry that its revenue is ""only"" more than doubling year over year. Worry about the fact that analysts don't think this company will earn any profit on that revenue before 2026 at the earliest"" - instead just buy $PLTR"
"These guys have got to be paying Cramer to talk them up. Terrible chart OMG . AWFUL !!! They lose more money then they bring in ?The more they sell the more they lose , Watch they will blame the government when they blow up as people do . WHo could have seen it ? DUH"
"Really, how can this company have a $80b market cap ? Because of Buffet ?"
Twlo > Snow? 
SNOW the absolute best and only at what it does. So good that CFO’s don’t care about writing a check every month that may increase 10x from previous period. It’s that impactful.
Why is snowflake doing not so good? Remember somebody buyed THEM for not Long time ago?
It's all option related. Next week is earnings. I say it bounces back at least 50% by the end of the day
when is this fantasy market going to correct. PE of sp500 and NASDAQ over 40. this stock is fantasy #1.
"Another great withdrawals today, really appreciate all you’ve done for me, you are the best. I promise to spread your good work."
why are we down 6% ...dilution or some other news ??
No news. What’s the reason for the drop????
I don't understand way it going up like this because They lose more money then they bring in
"I was going to buy this after I saw the most successful investor of all time and several hedge funds go long, but then some random guy on yahoo said it was going to lose 90% of its value."
Back to $240
Hi Bagholders...How does it feel to have bought this crapola yesterday?

Who is feeling bullish on snow tomorrow
This was amazing for me. I was very sad to be to late to party. And pum 11% drop. I’m in
If you are selling snow because of valuation and traditional earnings metrics u will continue to lose. This is a growth monster and you continue to be bulldozed until revenue slows. But until then thanks for the cabbage bro ￼￼
Reason for todays drop: The person usually in charge of manipulating the stock and keeping the value over inflated took today off to enjoy their new yacht.
dodged a bullet there phew ..was going to buy last night

"$ADBE $WIMI If we have a good day today, I think that we will keep going up from here $SNOW"
SNOW looks like it wants to go :)
Does anyone think SNOW will go above 360 for next year? It’s all time high has been 429!
"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Fairstox.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I don’t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"
"SNOW is still is the most overvalued tech stock in the market. They keep showing lots of growth in the ""unearned revenue"", but that's because they spend tons on marketing to get customers to sign up and pre-pay for the product, but then those customers end up never really using it. If that wasn't the case, the earned revenue would be growing much faster than the unearned revenue. Eventually, the truth will come out, but I think they can still keep the charade going for a while longer."
arrogant CEO so rude during conference call!
Almost a million shares traded. Is it some lock out expiration? Why the sell off?
"So exactly why did this drop from 285 to 250 in two days and now within two more trading sessions it has already recovered 85% of the drop and looks to power higher? Cleveland Research was it? Oh yea, those were the guys who said that brick and mortar retail were doomed because of Amazon before Covid, yet now after Covid, those retailers are two to three times higher than they were before Covid. Sure, legit?"

I feel that this pullback today is a good entry point to get in. I feel the future looks bright for this company.
"It is interesting that a company like Cloudflare, Inc. (NET) has shown a loss in net profit while growing similar to Snowflake and it is up over 60% this year. Why does Wall Street treat them differently?"

Are we getting a second take? 
Gl to anyone buying at these prices
A nasty overall market correction is coming.
Get into ZOM folks! Next double digit stock
It's snowing!
going to 199 today as I predicted. LOL.
Some say when all are tearing down a stock. By the End of the day it usually finish’s up. I’m starting to believe them. Another thing I noticed is all the put options got bought up for today. Banks never lose. You were warned. Triple witch.
wow. my posts state bias media headlines and they get deleted???? talk aboutcorrupt control of free speech. The media only allows what they want. That's communism.
"$WIMI Train to the station, don't snooze, it's time to wake up, other children are jumping high, you should rise$IBM $SNOW"
https://trendytoros.com/stocks/opinions/snow/
Correction is coming
my guess insider lightening up
This will drop ah and come back up. Always does this.
They do 1-1.5 billion in revenue and have a 90 billion mkt cap...Hmn....don't know about this one.
"$SNOW is great company but it went out way too much in IPO. Need a year or so to justify its valuation assuming 100% revenue growth YoY. Not sure it's moat is better than $PLTR since $PLTR deploys custom Apollo to lock in customers forever. $SNOW data warehousing, might be more easily replicable, just like AWS cloud that's being copied by $MSFT $GOOGL $BABA etc. Time will tell but I think $PLTR is more robust"
"""As of Aug. 23, Snowflake stock is not a buy"". I applaud the analyst at IBD for an honest analysis of SNOW. I expect nothing new to be announced on Wed that hasn't already been touted in attempts to keep this bubble inflated."
Does anyone knows how SNOW is different from other cloud companies because its look very clouded to me :)I want to learn so please only wise answers. Thanks in advance.
Wonder where it is by the end of the day - and Monday's moves... Maybe a chance to buy more? Not surprised by the $249 dip then bounce. Might not slip below that again...
This is just falling back on low volume . When there is significant moves on volume it is up not down. That is a big bullish sign. It's gonna be whippy for a while so just prepare yourself for it
People - the huge drop is due to the removal of SNOWFLake from the app store and android
What does everyone think of buying above $110? Stock has had an impressive run. Think it continues?
Insider selling the last two days. $85M total.
Short this overpriced garbage at will.
Wonder what the posting removal policy is on YMB. I write some generic comment on insiders sales being 60% of revenues for the quarter and removed. Annoying.
Keep buying on down days. I know something you don’t.
PLTR > SNOW
I felt the need to wake some of you up... Now let's go get it! $SNOW $WIMI $SNPR
"Hundreds of billions of fed QE dollars are constantly pouring into these types of loser stocks... This is causing market manipulations, like this one, with complete disregard for valuations. When the fed stops QE, these types of stocks will tank..."
"Snowflake: Yearly revenue: $720M. Market cap: $83B. They are not profitable, and there's no sign of profitability for at least 5 years, according to research reports. They don't pay a dividend either. So SNOW has been hyped by sell side analysts since the IPO, and it's a nice company with a friendly CEO who started other public companies. So what? It's overvalued by about $125!"
"SNOW is just a gigantic bubble stock. SNOW bubble stock market cap is already $77 billion dollars. But SNOW only has tiny $228 million of revenues last quarter while the losses were $203 million dollars. SNOW Price-to-Sales ratio is bubble 104. I am not talking about PE. SNOW has only losses and no earnings, so there is not even a PE to talk about. SNOW is spending $2 just to make $1 of sales. SNOW does not even have a viable business model at all. SNOW is just losing money like there is no tomorrow. Investors would be better off investing in real profitable growth stocks like AAPL, MSFT or FB."
Guys PAYO is money maker let's go guy's
8 years just to get to 10 billion???? You gotta be kidding me??? How about 100 billion in 8 years. Jesus Christ.
100B tomorrow ????
Soo... how about SNOW?
SNOW will go down like SAVA tomorrow.
$85 billion market cap?
losses are growing just as #$%$ as revenues. When does it stop?
Would it make sense to take profit and REINVEST it all with my initial investment or just hold? $SNOW $VENA
Nice ride from $200 and this will certainly be over $300 tomorrow. Never seen an enterprise software company with so much growth potential.
"I'm happy I own SNOW. Sure, it's overvalued but the BEST companies will always be overvalued because they keep exceeding expectations and raising their forecasts. SNOW is going to do that for the next two to three years."

Ptoterra is starting to the sky! next will be huge pomp!
$snow got crushed...now PLTR next with tomorrow FBI glitch news will be a catalyst
if this can hold 250 for 3 days or more as of now i will be surprised.
Buy now?
Purchased 509 shares today.
"Great run, time to start selling CC’s"
Snowflake reports earnings on August 25th. The last 2 reports were EPS and revenue beats.
"Like i said, everyone is covering right now"
"In the event, SNOW brings about the long-awaited avalanche at the edge with the growth in EVs it will double to what I view as a $500+ target price. It remains a matter of when and now if as the cloud continues to evolve at a more rapid pace in and on the other side of the overwhelmingly and omnious pandemic that has claim too many human lives in the span of one year."
Anyone still around who bought in at $400 and still sitting on a huge loss?
"Frank, book of revelations has already for told the future for SNOW.Mark, Luke and Matthew were snake oil salesmen."
$PLTR half the market cap of $SNOW and revenue is twice as much? thus PLTR is 4 times cheaper than SNOW? interesting...
PROFIT TAKING TIME STARTS NOW!!!!
Down in a record high market. SNOW will really flush in the looming September correction. SNOW is out of catalysts and hovering over a deep abyss.
Expected -15cents a shares on rev of ~$257mil / quarter. And its being traded at almost $300 ? How does that make any sense?
Will they pump Fraudflake to 429 again?
They had some interesting insights about SNOW on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.

"Frank, the CEO, is well connected. That's the only reason this stock stays pumped. The company itself is worth a fraction of the market cap. They are mostly just a managed cloud database provider. Nearly all their revenue just gets handed over to the cloud providers (disk storage, CPU capacity, network capacity, etc.). They are being judged by revenue growth, which is the most favorable metric to use for a middle-man type of business model. The company should be judged by it's margins and profitability, given the business model they have. Their revenue growth is decelerating the last few quarters, and operating expenses increase significantly in relation to revenue growth each quarter. The revenue growth should be accelerating with such a young company that has been growing it's customer base so rapidly. The unfulfilled performance obligations is actually increasing faster than the revenue growth, which is concerning. It means one of two things is going on; either the customers are signing up and not using the product (not good news), or the customers are planning to use the product a lot more in the near future (very good news). If it were the latter, revenue growth should have already started to explode higher in the most recent quarter. If I'm wrong, please point to the documentation (financials, SEC filings, snowflake website links, etc.) that proves it, or at least explain your position, based upon the documentation."
Buy and forget for few years
"Great day ahead. Congrats longs, happy I added that recent dip! "
wall street is crazy. really bad numbers and up!
Yep. Some investment group Cleveland Research said slowing growth.
Bought 100 shares today of SNOW.Added to my MSFT position too.
This company is very good at losing money. Why in the world are they bidding up an $85B company with $250M in sales?
Short the open at least in first 5-10 min then wait for a massive pullback
Watch. These sell off could lead to a cup and handle.
112 price to sales? You gotta be kidding me
Just sold all except 5 shares. In hopes that it'll pop after ER.
Interesting play
$SNOW will run to $300 before earnings on 25 August.
Too pricey.I'm thinking.....50% haircut.What'r you thinking?
Another $200 million dollars of operation losses. This company simply does not have a viable business at all.
something to do with MSFT...
It's how much you keep from each dollar that makes Snowflake special... Hence great numbers will cause a great move
Got room for more on the ride to $300
hedge fund mfs price manipulation
"Cleveland Research is the same organization that for two years from 2018 to 2020 said that malls and all brick and mortar retailers were dying on the vein driving prices down for the entire period of time, now those same stocks are three times higher than they were before Covid. They are paid hacks for the hedge funds."

Did earnings leak? Did they lose an important customer?
"Shorts who have been stung by ER , are trying to recover some money today!"
What is this stock's valuation LOL... Someone please try to justify these numbers to me.
Buy under 250 and sell at 300 next week. Works for me.
i dont see why this deserve this after hours jump. net lost of est 15c per share while actual is 64c loss per share which completely eclipse its 21% growth
added 37 shares
This is way overvalued. Buy something that’s profitable like apps which is growing just as fast and is actually profitable and at a major discount still

Sorry longs but this one is $nkla of the cloud....
"SNOW is a $83 billion dollar market cap bubble stock! It is a money losing company that has never made a penny of profit in any quarter. For a $83 billion dollar market cap company to have insignificant tiny $1 billion dollars of annual sales, it is a really pathetic. The price-to-sales (PS) ratio is extremely expensive 83 for SNOW. Real cloud giant Amazon (AMZN) PS ratio is only 4. SNOW is so expensive that SNOW stock price has to fall 95% just to be on par with real successful cloud giant AMZN valuation. Not to mention AMZN is profitable while SNOW cannot even turn profitable. SNOW is only worth $15 if we apply AMZN valuation to SNOW."
Negative operating income worries me. Hope it is not just a bubble

"Buy C3 AI (ticker AI) has very low debt, plenty of cash, and high short interest. over 850,000 new shares shorted on Monday and Tuesday. Also failure to deliver shares on a constant basis."
Price/ Sales = 127
Probably drop 70% when the shine fades.
$340 gets me a bass boat!
"People that called snowflake a cash grab bubble while they have no idea what the company actually does are ignorant. Their approach to their respective sector is revolutionary. The best way to describe it is comparing good old cable TV and Netflix. Sure, both do the same thing essentially but the latter do it in a completely unique way, catering to the needs of the customer. Go long on SNOW and forget it. We are looking at a potential tech giant here. Even at these outrageous price points of the stock, they will be a 10bagger a decade from now"

Cmon green!
They had some interesting insights about SNOW on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
great set-up for a drop to $248 on earnings today.
A company that lost close to $200 millions last quarter is getting a big push up and up. Thousands other companies while making both sales and profit numbers are just on cruise control modes. This is a fraudulent system.
Snow job. Software Maker Sets Path To $10 Billion In Revenue By 2028. And I have some land in Florida in 2028....
Should be over $300 tomorrow after investors get to think about the numbers. Time will tell...
Good buy here and I ain’t wrong often
A day before earnings. This will drop by noon. Profit taking. I suggest you do the same.
"And we didn’t even have to buy a $250,000 ticket!"
why it drop?
negative by end of day. numbers werent strong enough for most people.
Go $100
Show me -$30

"Barrons article today states that SNOW's revenues are apparently taking a hit, as reported by Cleveland Research."
300 by next week
DLTR after yesterdays overblown drop.
Who buy at 297
only 1 positive from ER. revenue a bit higher next quarter. BIG DEAL. shorts should avoid this manipulated stock
SNOW - should easily retest $240 are we saw a few days ago. I will re enter at $225 area. No complaints - been a phenomenal run on this stock
"Hey, SNOW is up $7 or 2.7 percent. PLTR? Not so much."
300 coming very soon
Everyone will buy snow tomorrow because it is the future. Yes I’m long and not a short.
"Sold puts today, didn't realize it was earnings day. Sometimes things just work out, lol"
"The majority of analysts have 12 month price targets of $270 for SNOW, the average price is less than that. They are losing money, and with an $84B market cap and $730M in revenue, they're very overvalued."
5 rockets fired at Kabul airport. U.S. military brought the CRAM missile defense system online. So exciting!
"please compare snow to viacom.Snow,no dividend,viac 2.5 % divSnow 712 million in revenues.viac 27 billion .Snow.no pe ratio.viac 8 pe ratio"
What an overhyped dog. And the tax loss selling hasn't even started yet.
Not comforting but I think this may be the downward handle for bolt upward . Has been consolidating for 6 months and I believe back of cup filled post earnings. Hoping this is final shake out before nice run. Sorry I used think and hope in same post
"Crazy, Average cost at $302, have been waiting for over 6 months to get nearer to that cost, now it drops 10% again all of the sudden."
Snowflake is up 6.06% to 300.97
anyone know when this BS casino stock will be valued correctly by the BS analysts??

TF.. 84B and their loss is growing more than revenue. #$%$
350 tomorrow!
What’s melting? 
"SNOW is stuck in mid $240s forMore than a month, just not able to establish sustainable support in the $250s area. I am evaluating myOptions now, there are cheaper and better day time Trading stocks than SNOW!"
SNOW can be a proof of price manipulation tactic of Hedge funds
"12 month high was over $400, with numbers like this we may see that again. Hang tight!"
"You got to hold on! Revenue beat, customer growth you just got to hold on.. I think snowflake is transforming into a behemoth qtr by qtr"
Overvalued?
Definitely sell this rally tomorrow…. Way overpriced!!!!!
"sell SNOW, BUY PLTR"
The flake don’t break
"facebook is on the verge of a 100 billion in revenue and super profitable. They are worth 1 trillion dollars. They are still growing like a weed. I doubt SNOW will be as wildly successful as facebook. Based upon facebook valuations, SNOW should be worth about 100 billion dollars WHEN they get to 10 billion in revenue. That would be an increase of around 40% roughly. So 40% in 8 years isn't bad right? Remember, 10 billion in 8 years equals 100 billion market cap. IF they can match FB which might be difficult."
"I hope this will be down tomorrow, because most of the times it is up in the morning after the earnings."
(http://financialdeals.tech) has been the best thing that’s happened to my portfolio! The stock picks are top-notch and well researched. I highly recommend them for any trader out there!
900M in annual revenue(being generous) trading at 73B market cap? what is wrong with yall?
Reasons why Snow is heading for 300 and beyond: 1: Insider selling as a flush is done. From now on there will be insiders selling little by litlle with no effect compared to the increasing demand. 2: A lot of buying near 200 (and buying in general) is for a yearlong investment. Investors want to be in from the 1st year of something gigantic - otherwise there is no point in buying now. That means selling is not an issue although the price fluctuate. 3: Demand is clearly ramping up. Average volume is now above 4mil - three months ago it was 2 mil. 4: 13 mil shares short by june end (probably a little less now) will add fuel to the upside. 5: Earnings will not dissapoint (at least I hope not:-)). SNOW is the stock to buy and hold if there ever was one.
