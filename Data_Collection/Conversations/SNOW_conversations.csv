Anyone still around who bought in at $400 and still sitting on a huge loss?
$ZOM is the next double-digit stock! Get in now!
"Where are we going today, my friends? :>)"
$85 billion market cap?
This company is very good at losing money. Why in the world are they bidding up an $85B company with $250M in sales?
"SNOW is still is the most overvalued tech stock in the market. They keep showing lots of growth in the ""unearned revenue"", but that's because they spend tons on marketing to get customers to sign up and pre-pay for the product, but then those customers end up never really using it. If that wasn't the case, the earned revenue would be growing much faster than the unearned revenue. Eventually, the truth will come out, but I think they can still keep the charade going for a while longer."
i dont see why this deserve this after hours jump. net lost of est 15c per share while actual is 64c loss per share which completely eclipse its 21% growth
Price/ Sales = 127
Who buy at 297
Snowfake behavin meme’ish
Reason for todays drop: The person usually in charge of manipulating the stock and keeping the value over inflated took today off to enjoy their new yacht.
This is way overvalued. Buy something that’s profitable like apps which is growing just as fast and is actually profitable and at a major discount still
"12 month high was over $400, with numbers like this we may see that again. Hang tight!"
Down in a record high market. SNOW will really flush in the looming September correction. SNOW is out of catalysts and hovering over a deep abyss.
"Frank, the CEO, is well connected. That's the only reason this stock stays pumped. The company itself is worth a fraction of the market cap. They are mostly just a managed cloud database provider. Nearly all their revenue just gets handed over to the cloud providers (disk storage, CPU capacity, network capacity, etc.). They are being judged by revenue growth, which is the most favorable metric to use for a middle-man type of business model. The company should be judged by it's margins and profitability, given the business model they have. Their revenue growth is decelerating the last few quarters, and operating expenses increase significantly in relation to revenue growth each quarter. The revenue growth should be accelerating with such a young company that has been growing it's customer base so rapidly. The unfulfilled performance obligations is actually increasing faster than the revenue growth, which is concerning. It means one of two things is going on; either the customers are signing up and not using the product (not good news), or the customers are planning to use the product a lot more in the near future (very good news). If it were the latter, revenue growth should have already started to explode higher in the most recent quarter. If I'm wrong, please point to the documentation (financials, SEC filings, snowflake website links, etc.) that proves it, or at least explain your position, based upon the documentation."
Another $200 million dollars of operation losses. This company simply does not have a viable business at all.
They do 1-1.5 billion in revenue and have a 90 billion mkt cap...Hmn....don't know about this one.
Buy now?
"Great day ahead. Congrats longs, happy I added that recent dip! "
Congrats to all longs whom got in a few days at down to $249
"Snowflake: Yearly revenue: $720M. Market cap: $83B. They are not profitable, and there's no sign of profitability for at least 5 years, according to research reports. They don't pay a dividend either. So SNOW has been hyped by sell side analysts since the IPO, and it's a nice company with a friendly CEO who started other public companies. So what? It's overvalued by about $125!"
"The way I see it, you can bash this stock on a Yahoo comment board.Or you can buy it and make some money. I chose the second option and I'm quite glad I did."
Smart money moving to MSFT now
I feel that this pullback today is a good entry point to get in. I feel the future looks bright for this company.
should be down 50 points tomorrow given downward guidance
Once it loses $300 $290 comes. Quick.
"You know what’s not melting? CHPT. In fact they’re getting a huge infrastructure investment soon, for 500k EV charging stations"
"$SNOW Weakness Said Tied to Cautious Analyst Note - Cleveland Research Report said partners are seeing sales cycles elongate on increased competition from hyperscalers, particulary GOOG BigQuery"
Wonder what the posting removal policy is on YMB. I write some generic comment on insiders sales being 60% of revenues for the quarter and removed. Annoying.
A company that lost close to $200 millions last quarter is getting a big push up and up. Thousands other companies while making both sales and profit numbers are just on cruise control modes. This is a fraudulent system.
why are we down 6% ...dilution or some other news ??
"Put 2 dollars, get 1 dollar back. Amazing business model, definitely justifies 100x multiple."
Correction is coming
Not comforting but I think this may be the downward handle for bolt upward . Has been consolidating for 6 months and I believe back of cup filled post earnings. Hoping this is final shake out before nice run. Sorry I used think and hope in same post
Nice ride from $200 and this will certainly be over $300 tomorrow. Never seen an enterprise software company with so much growth potential.
"Apparently the Cleveland research report was spot on. Growth is clearly slowing, so we may see a stock price under $200 in time."
Expected -15cents a shares on rev of ~$257mil / quarter. And its being traded at almost $300 ? How does that make any sense?
Stock future decline after retail sales drop more than expected..what is going on!!!!
900M in annual revenue(being generous) trading at 73B market cap? what is wrong with yall?
