"105 to 80, GXO was 63 now 58, so 80+58=138 premium from when I bought XPO @114.86/shr or 20% gain. LTH for both"
Bought initial position today at 84.09.....I owned XPO a few years ago...kept kicking myself for selling it.
Hello GXO!TJ
Not much of anything happening right now to move this one. Hoping for a little per announcement news for a little pop before Nov earnings.
Down 3% yesterday I bought another 20 K at 8435. Lew
"About GXO ""Despite its market leadership, GXO holds only 5% of the fast-growing $430 billion potential addressable logistics market in Europe and North America.""This is what they will be carving into, and with/because of Shopify, it can happen incredibly fast. There's a complexity to Shopify and it's model, that the financial media had troubles catching up to, and I would say that the same could be said of XPO. They had to split into TWO different companies to make things easier to understand.Nobody knows quite how long it will take for the whole valuation thing will quite work out, so I'm incentivized to hold onto my shares of both companies...which were one company until a few short days ago, No point in over-stirring the pot, and for differing reasons, each could remain a real buy, one as a value stock, one as a growth. Value stocks are a really easy way to kickstart a portfolio, but require a bit more patience. Two-in-one might not be such a bad thing.And I'm not sure that either the Retail sector or the Logistics sector analysts are tuned in to each other's respective sectors. In a weird way, the split have have given them further anonymity, as the company has dropped in value to create the new one. It's harder to fallow two companies that are suddenly half the size of one, and the expensive one is based in Europe....Shopify has also been remarkably successful at shaking off the short sellers and traders, this newest move will be great for xpo and gxo. IMHO. Last year my brokerage discontinued coverage of xpo, and advised to sell. So glad I held on!"
This will be an interesting one for years to come
"Holy cow (per Phil Rizzuto) this thing gives you whiplash. Drops for a couple of weeks, and then a neck brace needed in the past 4 hours. What gives? Pure algorithm-induced volatility or new business?"
What you’re seeing right now is a lot of institutional buying. Don’t expect this to keep this type of growth but GXO is a great long term hold…
I worked in logistics for 20 years and this seems like a scam. Exactly how are they going to make money?
"I was watching for the point where Schwab had $GXO listed for trade, got 200 shares at $60.0352 early Monday the 2nd. Picked up 200 additional $XPO Tuesday the 3rd at $83.80 and am very happy with 400 shares of each. It was also really interesting to watch how the spinoff worked."
My decision to convert my XPO to GXO has paid off so far…GXO up 22% since the split from XPO as of today 
holidays season is approaching . XPO and GXO will be loaded with orders in the coming months... 
and another final trade today from one of the analysts on half time today. a jump but its fading at close
how to evaluate GXO? any esrnings from GXO available?
"If i wanted to keep only one of these, which one should i keep? I am kind of leaning to the trucking company....."
Will GXO start trading soon?
Good one. 150 shares. See you in future.
Crazy day
Maybe price decline is attributed to the risk of reopening which is highlighted by the delta variant. But this is a long term play. Supply chains are key to economic growth
"There's always a period of adjustment after an event like this. Portfolio rebalancing etc. The two equities have to find their own price. It can sometimes take a while. For example, aapl didn't recover their pre-split price for about 9 month. Some people will move into xpo, others into gxo, others simply want to grab their winnings. Maybe institutions will take some profits now.Their could be some volatility with with both companies, since they are both unknowns now. Two companies means twice the risk, so there's trimming going on.You have to shrug it off, shift focus. do something else or you can drive yourself mad. Check in every week, or month. If you look at xpo's 5 year chart, you will see why I've spent a lot of the past five years ignoring the price movement. It's exciting, but you also have to be able to sleep and night. Investing should NOT cause distress. It's important to handle the emotional side of things. I love my businesses, and give them the time they need to get things done.Fortunately for us all, Shopify's foray into Europe should send profits trickling in fairly quickly. This is LTP, long term play, and these are brand new days! Love your companies. Give them time to shine. Look at xpo's 5yr chart! I trimmed some profits when it began crasing Sept2018, and it didn't hit $85 again until Jan2021. Aapl traded sideways for 9 months after the split. Great time be building a position, or simply leaving your investment to mature.Yes, a little bit down down today. Volumes were also down 30% over yesterday. The dust needs to settle. The administrative end is still being looked after. Red green red green.. Investors are far less excited by normal daily price movement, than the traders and scouts since we think in terms of quarters, years and decades.. Eventually we move so far away from our entry price that we don't even think about it. Its a function of Time, and not becoming impatient, just like Warren Buffet says.@Abdul. I'm not against trading (although I don't), but I always suggest that people should avoid shorting and trading Shopify. It's been tragic seeing so much money thrown away. Shopify, xpo and gxo are nimble and creative in a way that few companies are, and now that they are partnered AND are both disruptors, Shopify will teach them some of their...tricks...to discourage traders and short selling. Nobody build a brand quite like Shopify, and they're very generous. XPO, pre-split, needed to grow revenues 50% to catch up with their nearest competition, I can't escape the sense that they and Shopify and gxo of course fit heavily into each other's plans. At the 6RS website, ""In no particular order"" they have listed the top 20 logistics company they are doing business with, and xpo is one of them. I'm trying not to read too much into it, but XPO is number one on the list, and Europe is where they plan to make serious coin with SHOP. I just know that I'm right.$SHOP now has more than 3 million merchants. That's 715,000 more than they had on 10June.21. More than half are US merchants, which bodes well for $XPO, and the balance are from everywhere else, like Europe..It's gonna be great!"
"Hello New GXO Shareholders! I've been long on XPO since Jan2017, only 4 months longer than one of my other darling stocks, Shopify where I do most of my research and hanging out. SHOP & XPO have been connected to XPO through Shopify's wholly owned subsidiary 6 River Systems, a robotics company that Shop acquired for about $500mln in late 2019, and which has been developing business independently of Shopify as well. I think of them as Shopify's secret weapon.I was checking out an article about some of GXO's blue-chip customers, and noted that Nestle was near the top of the list. Nestle is also one of Shopify's earliest ShopPlus merchants! So then I searched GXO + Shopify, and found 6RS's shout out to GXO on ipo: "" 6 River Systems 8,271 followers 1d ""Our team would like to congratulate GXO Logistics, Inc. on their launch and going public on the NYSE. Thank you for being our partner and including us in your big day. "" I like that last sentence, a lot.So XPO was one of the earliest testers/adopters of the Chuck System. The relationship won't be touted on Shopify finance pages, because 6RS moves in the background. But I have stated that I believe the power hub of Shopify is shifting to the Shopify Fulfillment Network (SFN), which is 6RS. Shopify likes to do things away from spotlights. I wasn't concerned about the recent release of various executives, because of the real action is happening at 6RS.Mr Jacobs and Mr. Lutke are two very smart men. I'm sure Mr. Wilson is too. Talk about unlocking value!GXO is partnered with Shopify, right out of the gate. This is the first time I've seen it in print, no more speculation, and I'm pretty excited! Go $SHOP Go $XPO Go$GXO !!(Sorry for the global posting, I don't do it very often, but this is pretty big, and is not new territory. I think that when Tobi announced that he wanted to ""play"" with logistics, I posted that he should buy xpo)"
Seems like a lot of hype
We've been locked out of the board for a week.
"I moved all of my XPO investment to GXO. If you listen to CEO Wilson on YF video interview on 8.2.21, the growth potential is incredible. GXO already opens 50 centers a year and will use M&A to fill geographical/vertical gaps across the globe. The in-sourced logistics market is $300 billion, which they can tap into on top of the current $130 billion outsourced market which GXO has only 5% penetration. CEO Wilson is articulate in delivering the plan for GXO, I am now a long term holder."
Looking for 70’s to buy
"Mayling, what do u mean by locked out of the board?"
"Steve Weiss CNBC Halftime Report today said he is was a holder of XPO before the split into XPO/GXO, says GXO the only pure-play logistics public company. He has bought more GXO post split. Analysts will start to publish recommendations, stock price will keep going up without any major market pullback."
@Mayling GXO sounds interesting. I would like to start a position at around $65
DOES ANYONE KNOW THE ESTABLISHED COST CASIS FOR GXO AUG 2 ...WHEN IT CAME ON THE EXCHANGE?
"GXO.wi started trading, however, account doesn't show GXO.wi but show only XPO. I wonder , how anyone can sell or trade this new stock"
Why the heavy selling pressure? Down down down.....??
Rockstar of the day! 70.53 +4.15 (+6.25%) At close: 4:00PM EDT71.00 +0.47 (0.67%) After hours: 05:23PM EDT Go GXO!
"Today Steve Weiss on CNBC final trade, buy!"
Stephanie Link on CNBC halftime Final trade GXO
What will happen to $XPO once the split is complete? Will it go down by the $GXO price? Help here!
"If it's helpful to people here, I've calculated the 3Aug split date with the following values.XPO $84.68, say $85GXO $64.90, say $65The ratio 1716:1000 can be worked out precisely, but I just took Yahoo's opening numbers and created two new lots, one at each price, so that we have a way to measure values as they unfold. It's easier to do with GXO because it's new, but the continuity of GXO meant that I needed a starting value by which to examine the both companies.Happily, xpo is up about 9.55%, and gxo is a very attractive 18.55% since 3Aug Of course, this can all fluctuate from day to day, but it's a very nice start! Once the share-shuffling is done, I think it will be fun watching them in tandem. Will XPO become less volatile, or more? It's sort of a given, with GXO. Go GXO! Go $XPO!"
This is the one that will make the $$$
Why are we getting wacked today????
Damn what’s up with that after hours movement? Don’t see any news
"GXO has wind fall now, up 35% in a few days. It’s the time to Take profit before everyone else runs for the exit. Come back one month later when it trades lower. Sell"
Don't get all excited. This just could be ETF's and funds that have to buy up shares since this is now a new issue.
XPO is getting whacked too.
Mentioned on CNBC 1/2 time....GXO has little or no competition. Should continue to outperform .
great long term . These are traders that are going off of Goldman's 68 dollar price target so that they can get in cheaper.
"Mr. Maguire: There is a great future in logistics. Think about it. Will you think about it?Benjamin Braddock: Yes, I will.Mr. Maguire: Okay. Enough said. That's a deal."
Deutschland bank has GXO target $81. GXO will be the biggest pure play contract logistics company in the world. 17% EBIDA growth through 2022. Buy at the opening.
Why the 5% pop after hrs?...?
Liftoff…just the beginning.
"I had xpo for a great run.. Then gxo in 70s, big position. Should be great return, will see. For me, by far best pick in that area"
deutche bank and trust have 81 and 100 dollar price targets
BACKING THE TRUCK UP!
"Bought more today, Mr. Bradley Jacobs has made me a lot of money. Staying with this one , riding it and going to the whip."
"GXO is outperforming XPO in the last three weeks. It does not matter, combined value counts and Mr. jacobs, outstanding chairman, for both companies. I am bullish on both compnies."
"From the GXO Blog. ANF is an important player in a cool move. It's a Shopify kind of move. And sure enough, ANF is one of Shopify's 9 main players in the new Influencer's Program announce about two weeks ago (paywall at Business Insider)We're gonna see a lot more smooth moves like this. Very exciting. I am posting this separately on relevant boards, so it doesn't get taken down as spam. 13Oct 79.21+3.35 (+4.42%) at close.https://www.gxo.com/news_article/gxo-and-abercrombie-fitch-to-open-high-tech-warehouse/"
"I don't know if it means anything, but I notice that xpo/gxo and Shopify both have approximately the same number of shares outstanding. Shopify has a few less, but that will soon be looked after as they have recently filed for a new mixed shelf offering = $10Bln Just lining up the apples and oranges..."
"I’m somewhat of a new shareholder with XPO (early June). Now that I have both companies after the spin-off, which do people like more XPO, GXO or both equal?"
Going g to 10.00 per the data
"wish i had more shares, only have 105 at 68. been hoping this would pull back but it won't stop!"
"This silly little investment thesis I've got going involving ... SHOP $XPO $GXOLas year, I began regularly visiting the other exchanges on which Shopify trades, and reporting back to the chat what the foreign volumes looked like (growing). Tonight I did the same for xpo and gxo. Guess what? It doesn't appear that XPO start trading OTC on foreign exchanges until Spring2016. Their second busiest exchange Frankurt, got busier after Tobi said he wanted to ""play"" in logistics. There isn't a lot of foreign activity, and like Shopify's did, I think it will grow over time. In XPO Munich Mar2021, there was a single block buy of 640 shares. It's easy to keep track of numbers like that, but not if you're trying to make quick trades.XPO has about 3% short of float, gxo none, but now the bet has changed, and it will become much riskier for traders and short sellers going forward. IMO.GXO hasn't traded on as many exchanges yet, but on Monday, there was a block purchase of 6.94k shares, in Berlin, only 100. As these numbers grow, they will become a great foil to traders and market players, sometimes causing inexplicable price movements in North America. i.e. Dusseldor has a bad day, shares of shopify are sold off. Meanwhile, back on the NYSE, SHOP is having a pretty good day on average volume, and SHOP.TO sellers are in heaven because the US dollar is so strong, and the price moves violently on the small float, sometimes with, but often independently of the market. It makes it difficult to traders to get purchase on the stock as its spheres of influence become larger and more diffuse. I think that because of exchange rate fees, plus the exchange itself, these purchasers are less likely to be traders, Inherently stronger hands. Shopify is very good at shaking off traders, although they perhaps have an edge because of their dual uplisting on they NYSE and TSX. XPO created a similar duality by spinning out GXO I predict that BFCM will be phenomenally again, and maybe they will even work the SFN and logistics into the youtube show.. Last year they initiated the carbon offset program (which I am now registered into as a ShopPay consumer), so maybe we can look forward to somehow linking the twoMaybe something like call and answer challenges, or linking their distribution into a part of the show.Meanwhile"
Love GXO and XPO  >>> Pandemic lesson #1 was the important and efficient logistics infra
Down approx 2.80 per-inc after hours on 9/23. Profit taking!?
