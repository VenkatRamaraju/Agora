It's a great technology I know and use in my research. This to see it's public now. Good investment for the long-term.
Time for a super squeeze on this perfect opportunity! $$$

Wow  I’m loving this stock
This one is going to be dilute dilute the shares
Why the big drop today?
Earnings at 61.2 mils vs est of 55.9 mils. Webcast to follow.
TXG-+-Going down to $26.00 or $24.00 in two weeks.:;:Warning
"BOA Global Research Report this morning - ""We are positive on the market for single cell analysis and think that, as a market leader, TXG will benefit from increasing customer investment, a growing number of applications, continuing need for new biological insights, and rapid pace of technological innovation. We believe that TXG shares warrant a premium to other life science tools companies due to its leading position in a new high-growth market, business model driven by high-margin consumables, and superior organic revenue growth rate."""
TXG reached an all time high at 91.81
"Why does this company have a $19B market cap, and no earnings? It's very overvalued by any metrics."
TXG and FLGT best in this space imo.
The value of this one might be over stretched.
"10x is at the forefront of single-cell genomics and is the market leader. Their multiome and spatial transcriptome line up (visium) are unmatched and are blowing the competition out of the water. Plus, this company models like a printer company. You have to keep buying their reagents and kits. All their products, kits, software (cellranger), customer service are top-notch.With genomics booming and single-cell diagnostic becoming the norm, I wasn't surprised to see this was hoarded by ARKK and ARKG.I think there is lots of growth potential. Long 10x!"
Out of all the stock in my portfolio I am most excited about this one. Will hold and will not sell. They are at the start of a new technology and have a lot of room to run. IP is deep and opportunity a plenty. They will burn money on R&D but that is ok.
ITC ruling is a win for 10x as new chips are already produced in the US and the royalty imposed on the the previously imported chips is not high. https://www.usitc.gov/secretary/fed_reg_notices/337/337_1068_notice_12182019sgl.pdf

Sold all. I be waiting you somewhere !!
I made a video about 10x Genomics ($TXG)Check it on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrnREVMLxw0
Looks like we are consolidating. Just went through this with AMZN moving sideways for 10 months without an ounce of upside until a week ago. Hopefully 10X does not churn for 10 months.
cant wait to short this at lock up :)
How much of a drop are we expecting from this sell off?
10x Genomics reached an all time high at 160.74

Why is TXG down?
"10X Genomics (TXG) PT Raised to $60 at CowenNovember 8, 2019 8:19 AMCowen analyst Doug Schenkel raised the price target on 10X Genomics (NASDAQ: TXG) to $60.00"
I am starting to see articles that Tech investments are dead. That probably means we are at the bottom. When everyone starts talking about something it is usually over.
Don't know what is going on with this stock. Quarterly report seemed pretty good. Future growth is good. This company looks like it will soon be making a profit.

Cathie Woods has been selling 10X last week and this week? Stock is finally popping and she is selling? Her criteria is stocks that will do well over the next 5 years. Well that is 10X!!! They have a bright future. Maybe she is just spreading her money out.

This technology has so much potential. The money is in the consumables. Once a lab starts using your juice and plastics it is hard to move to another platform. Your customers are almost on a subscription model with reliable sales every month.

I have a 1 month target for txg at $175 based on its enterprise value and its differentiating technology. Price seems to be shuffling its feet at $150 and should start running toward $175 pretty fast. Strong buy.

Good guidance. Earnings are up. What s happening?

There are no BNGO investors here! You are guys are lucky.
Quietly climbing the ladder to $200.....Under accumulation....
"While the underlying businesses are excellent for many of these ARK fund related stocks, the valuations were out of hand. When TXG was selling north of 50X’s revenues, not earnings, people always justify the lofty valuations by saying its “different” this time, or Kathy Wood knows something revolutionary about investing. The plain fact is that many of the biotech high flyers like TXG, TWST, etc, were reflecting valuations that they hope to justify years down the road. Again, there is nothing wrong with the company’s pipeline or future, it just got way ahead of itself from a valuation perspective."
is 60 yet?Waiting to happen
Well that was short lived. I’m holding. Not a Bag. Still up. Have to say I’ve noticed this has big moments and then they’re￼ gone.
Last chance to get in cheap
lockup is March 10.
I call $155.75 tomorrow

10x Genomics reached an all time high at 180.27
Why down today?
"Genomic Buys are TXG, FLGT and NEO. Great for 2020."
"I think Txg is in a good position to start revolutionizing the genome sequencing market by producing personal devices that could take a tiny blood sample, isolate a few cells and spit out genome info. Could start with partial sequencing then develop comprehensive seq device. We'll see if they can execute it like Jobs did for the personal pc market in the 70s/80s."

10x Genomics reached an all time high at 148.03
Out of all my stocks this one is the most exciting to me. I am in the same industry of Bio-Med and their products are well positioned to dominate the market. They are a bunch of smart people working there. I actually know a few former colleagues who have gone there and they have nothing but good things to say about them.
Txg is a rare gem. Its technological capabilities are equal or superior to that of illumina and others. It should easily surpass all of them and its market value should adjust upward in a hurry.
10x Genomics is up 8.05% to 181.76
Earnings 4th qtr: 75.3 mils vs 70 mils consensus. Annual $245.9 mils vs $241.3 consensus. Expected in 202045% earnings increase to $350 mils with over $420 mils cash on hand. This will rocket up tomorrow I am sure.
Cathie Woods will be loading up on 10X tomorrow.
Last TXG shares released from lockup yesterday. Increased volume today reflects shares completing the movement from weak to strong hands.. Stock getting ready to make a major run upward in the coming weeks.
At this rate 10x Genomics will be 5x Genomics.
"What moves this stock? No real news is ever announced. Been here for just under a year buying in at $53, just not sure if I plan to stay past the 1 year long for tax purposes. Much upside to come? How?"
Lift off!!!

A $22B market cap with $300M in revenue and no earnings? This is way overvalued.

Like clockwork Cathie Woods bought yesterday on the dip.
10x is one of the companies that represent our future.
Best Genomic stocks continue to be TXG and FLGT.
Extremely impressive presentation at JPM conference giving TXG a big bounce. Expect forthcoming analyst upgrades based on robust future prospects.

This is one of my 5 year horizon stocks. Going to own and and forget about it for the next five years.
I was sure we would go up today.... Not over yet.
Still good short?......

bet this goes to 90 or so within a month since everyone is saying it will tank

"Update from Cathie Woods10X Genomics (TXG) traded down 21% on Thursday after reporting first quarter earnings. Although the company delivered ~50% revenue growth and reiterated annual guidance, investors seemed to focus on COVID-related lab closures that impacted single-cell sequencing experiments. 10X mentioned that many of its customers wouldn't reach pre-pandemic utilization rates until the second half. Moreover, it highlighted that significant investments will increase operating expenses and impact margins through year-end. Our conviction in 10X Genomics as a pioneer in single-cell and spatial genomics is strong and intact."
"TXG is getting pummeled in the Covid unwind trade but in reality TXG's business will be MUCH improved by a vaccine. Once the world returns to ""normal,"" labs re-open and the purchase of instruments and consumables grows well beyond the limited incremental revenue from Covid-19 research. Expect the stock to recover today's losses quickly when analysts update after this week's earnings call."
10x Genomics is up 5.39% to 119.63
I wonder if this will fly over 150 range in next 1-2 years given its huge potential in genome products sector which is unique and ground breaking....but still so far no profits yet....any thoughts?
"When break 78 resistance, otherwise back to 60"
nice pop....why??
Good luck to 10X Genomics!

This was way better than I had hopedOnly .10 loss per share as opposed to the .26 expected. One year ago it was a loss of .41 per share.This is huge because we will see this go from a Hold to Buy.

"I bought @$50 because a friend who runs a genetics lab said the tech would be ubiquitous but the market hasn't caught on.It's hard to argue the market hasn't caught on @$200, so I'm thinking of selling. Can anyone convince me TXG is undervalued at this price? Note: I'm not asking ""Will the stock go up from here? or ""Will the company grow and have greater success?"" I'm asking whether its positive potential is significantly undervalued @$200 (especially in light of long-term threat from competing tech).Thanks."
Think Morgan Stanley sold.

Any speculations as to range of revenue in a few days? Will revenue at $56 mil or more?
I don’t get it. The earnings weren’t bad. I feel like the whole market is mess up!

Good Entry point at $60
"Depending on the company, the IPO lock-up period typically lasts between 90–180 days before these shareholders are allowed the right, but not the obligation, to exercise the option. Lockups are designed to prevent insiders from liquidating assets too quickly after a company goes public."

Great time to buy.....The 3 day rule says buying time again.
Great presentation at AGBT. Expect that the increased throughput offered by the new products and existing product enhancements will lead to greater sales of high margin consumables than are in any current revenue models. This was a fact clear to every scientist in the room but it will be interesting to see how long it takes for Wall Street to come to the same conclusion.

Hope I’m right. GLTA"
should be a sell off today and tomorrow because ipo expire tomorow 10 mill shares @$39 at this price most of investor will be cashing in.
