Great presentation at AGBT. Expect that the increased throughput offered by the new products and existing product enhancements will lead to greater sales of high margin consumables than are in any current revenue models. This was a fact clear to every scientist in the room but it will be interesting to see how long it takes for Wall Street to come to the same conclusion.
nice pop....why??
"10x building tools and technologies for research. For the first time, scRNA sequence is enabling a cell-by-cell Molecular and cellular Characterization of hundreds of thousands of cells within the same sample. Complex systems, like those found in the immune system, can be explored without limits. Researchers around the world will definitely use the award winning chromium system. Their earnings announcement is Scheduled February 17 with expected EPS of -0.07 and expected revenue of 100.40 million USD. I’m hoping for a beat on EPS of over 20% and a beat on revenue of over 30%. Hope I’m right. GLTA"
"TXG is getting pummeled in the Covid unwind trade but in reality TXG's business will be MUCH improved by a vaccine. Once the world returns to ""normal,"" labs re-open and the purchase of instruments and consumables grows well beyond the limited incremental revenue from Covid-19 research. Expect the stock to recover today's losses quickly when analysts update after this week's earnings call."
"10X Genomics (TXG) PT Raised to $60 at CowenNovember 8, 2019 8:19 AMCowen analyst Doug Schenkel raised the price target on 10X Genomics (NASDAQ: TXG) to $60.00"
cant wait to short this at lock up :)
"Update from Cathie Woods10X Genomics (TXG) traded down 21% on Thursday after reporting first quarter earnings. Although the company delivered ~50% revenue growth and reiterated annual guidance, investors seemed to focus on COVID-related lab closures that impacted single-cell sequencing experiments. 10X mentioned that many of its customers wouldn't reach pre-pandemic utilization rates until the second half. Moreover, it highlighted that significant investments will increase operating expenses and impact margins through year-end. Our conviction in 10X Genomics as a pioneer in single-cell and spatial genomics is strong and intact."
Extremely impressive presentation at JPM conference giving TXG a big bounce. Expect forthcoming analyst upgrades based on robust future prospects.
"great model, much like printer style, not only they buy printer from you, they also have to reagularly buy the paint, this company won and knows how to monetize its victory, i dont think i need to say much more, a lot of other companies should learn how to deliver like this"
Earnings at 61.2 mils vs est of 55.9 mils. Webcast to follow.
Is this the first time Ark has investes in these?
Slowly climbing but has good support by Batman
"10x is at the forefront of single-cell genomics and is the market leader. Their multiome and spatial transcriptome line up (visium) are unmatched and are blowing the competition out of the water. Plus, this company models like a printer company. You have to keep buying their reagents and kits. All their products, kits, software (cellranger), customer service are top-notch.With genomics booming and single-cell diagnostic becoming the norm, I wasn't surprised to see this was hoarded by ARKK and ARKG.I think there is lots of growth potential. Long 10x!"
10x is one of the companies that represent our future.
"BOA Global Research Report this morning - ""We are positive on the market for single cell analysis and think that, as a market leader, TXG will benefit from increasing customer investment, a growing number of applications, continuing need for new biological insights, and rapid pace of technological innovation. We believe that TXG shares warrant a premium to other life science tools companies due to its leading position in a new high-growth market, business model driven by high-margin consumables, and superior organic revenue growth rate."""
"Earnings stock drops, No news stock goes up. Go figure?"
Should I hold through earnings? 5 billion for a market cap seems really high?
TXG will be $300 by the end of the year
High volume on this one. Anyone know what's going on?
I don’t get it. The earnings weren’t bad. I feel like the whole market is mess up!
Sold all. I be waiting you somewhere !!

Any speculations as to range of revenue in a few days? Will revenue at $56 mil or more?
Anybody have any thoughts. Feeling discouraged about this one
Ark bought what do you guys think?
"Waiting for 20x Genomics, Inc. IPO"
Why the big drop today?
"Txg a hidden gem. Hard to fathom this has fallen to this low level and still somewhat languishing. Not much longer, I believe."

Evercore initiates coverage with an outperform rating and a price target of $70
It's a great technology I know and use in my research. This to see it's public now. Good investment for the long-term.
Got in at $55. Don’t know much about this company though.
A $22B market cap with $300M in revenue and no earnings? This is way overvalued.
any update
