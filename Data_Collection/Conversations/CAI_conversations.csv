"So after buyouts do they always stay still???? Someone lmk I’m uneducated on this, if it were possible for the stock to have a move up or down options would go nuts. Let me know please sorry for being a dummy((:"
winning by antagonizing our allies and trade partners. that is some real maga!
CAI is down -7.17% to 22.00

Why is the stock stuck on 56ish? It can’t go down or up?
The preferreds should be above par ($25.00). Container rental demand is much higher this quarter than expected which bodes well for CAI. https://seekingalpha.com/news/3614323-triton-internationalplus-2-after-favorable-guidance-update

I think $32 is fair value. PE = 8 and equal to the book value. I suspect the company will continue buying back shares until that price.
This message board has no life in it. Hopefully today’s earning report is capable of some CPR.
@optional Would be interested on your take for a fair value for CAI. My Online broker has a fair value estimate of $38.50.
Took a sizable position at 23
"This stock is too cheap, the PE is below 5 with riding revenue. Not sure what Sellers have mind."
"does anyone know what is behind the extreme bearishness in this sector? all 3 stocks (trtn, tgh, CAI) have taken a huge beating in proportion to the market, and I don't see that anything has changed aside from fear of marginally higher interest rates. news searches aren't revealing much. can't tell if this has based or is still in free fall."
CAI is down 9.63% to 19.85
CAI is up 6.87% to 25.91
TRTN sells for book value.CAI sells for 40% of book value. They do exactly the same thing. CAI should pay a dividend or sell itself to TRTN at 90% of its book value ($32).
Fantastic Q4. And the outlook for 2021 is great. We are definitely in an upcycle in container leasing and I like CAI is a leader in this sector. I'm increasing my holdings because we are underpriced at these levels.
J Mintzmyer said onTwitterBetting that whomever sold box lessors today is feeling mega-stupid.... Huge resounding buy signal for the entire containership and box space as Mitsubishi Capital buys out $CAI for a 47% premium. Who is next? $TGH or $TRTN ? How long until $DAC or $GSL gets a bid? #shipping
Sayonara CAI! It was good knowin' ya!

"Wow our p/e should be 15-18...” locked in at very low rates for multiple years. As a result of these favorable factors, we expect to continue to deliver exceptional high teen or greater ROE’s for our shareholders."""

Why is this stock stuck still
why is CAI down undervalued so much? Aappears 28.50 or so ought to be about correct
"Does anyone else get the feeling the company is ready to announce a secondary share offering? I get that feeling based on the price action after the recent run up. It looks like potential buyers are selling short to get ready to buy shares on the offering and at times, the underwriters and others who would be in the selling group are trying to support the shares so the price does not drift too low prior to the offering. This is pure speculation based on the seemingly wide swings and sometimes a fairly large gap opening up between the bid and ask."

"Was the quarterly really THAT bad, or are shorts at work again? Comparing the also recent results with TGH caught flatfooted in a challenging environment absolutely doomed to improve in succeeding quarters, I think CAI is oversold. Consider especially now low container pricing against reduced supply of them, unsustainable suddenly. This company has less dependence on that anyway, more options in play. Great time to get on the better horse."
Traded over $56 today. Any news on whether the Bid will be raised?
"CAI- selloff continues, but why ? I don't get it"
CAI is up 8.23% to 29.97
"Hmm, why would CAI drop in price the day before ex-dividend day. More drops coming on 6/9 or 6/10 after ex-dividend?"
No matter how you look at it these guys are growing dramatically. A year ago this quarter they missed analysts estimates by .22 and lost .09 for the qtr. Today they made $1.03 per share for the qtr.- Look for another increase in institutional buying in the weeks to come.
CAI is up 8.54% to 24.08
"this makes no sense at all. CAI historical pe prior to 2015 collapse is around 8. nothing indicated collapse, only continued growth. what the eff!"
CAI is down 6.80% to 17.13
"Really pleased. I have a small holding in this. Opened it last week when I saw the report from the Port of Charleston. I have a larger stake in the big player, but the spike in this one almost makes me wish it was the other way.Lol, making money in both. Love this industry.GLA"
"they did say that although unit sales/leases should be strong going forward, they seem to expect prices to come down, and they also said that they expect their debt servicing expense to go up, and that there is increasing competition. I'm not saying this is expensive at all, but an investor could deduce from what CAI said in their earnings pr/conf call, that they and the sector have topped, and to expect lower earnings for the next few years going forward."
CAI is down -4.96% to 22.40
If someone could answer would be very helpful… does this price freeze or will it move?
What will happen after mitsubishi buy over at $56? The current shareholder?
is 19.70 sustainable ?

buying more to dollar cost average.
"Chart shows classic descending triangle with base side at $20. 50 day ema has negative slope that is above 200 day ema, but not for long. Financials look better than the chart, but the trend is in, and it's negative. A dividend--which CAI can afford--would help. The private sale of a big chunk of the float by a principal didn't help either. Buy at $20."
"Be careful with after hours trading in thinly traded stock like this. Earnings are decent but just in line with expectations and down from last quarter (adjusted number, not with the huge one time gain). Based on previous action, CAI could head back below $20 tomorrow, especially if the whole market is weak and gives up some of today's large gains before the weekend. However, if it does, that might be a good long term entry point. Downside risks are still rather weak rail component and chance that management overbuys containers again during good times."
CAI is up 8.79% to 13.31
i farted
I believe this stock is very undervalued. Freight companies are making big money and are loaded with cash. Why would they not pay $60 a share for earnings of 8? How could management refuse such an offer? The purchasing company does not need to make any radical changes. After the contracted deliveries and new charters are executed Cai stock is definitely worth 60 per share to for example Zim.

the entire market appears to be in turmoil.......... no idea where cai is going.....
"New to container leasing, long trtn. Why would newbie want to buy $tgh or $cai when $trtn offers lower PE valuation AND pays 4% dividend? Which of the three stocks have delivered best total return for investors over the last 1, 3, 5 years, and which of the three are expected to deliver the best total return going fwd? Is best strategy own $trtn long term, swing trade $tgh and $cai?"

"Sale of 2,146 railcars for around $200 million was announced today (Feb 26, 2019). About $50 million of equity capital will be made available to invest in other assets and to buy back shares. This Company has the best capital allocation performance in its industry."
10 p/e gets us to $70 a share
so that seems like it might be a pretty big beat...am I mistaken? ah is awfully quiet.
INCREDIBLE EARNINGS RELEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GREAT NUMBERS...... CAI GOING TO 20!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thoughts on 28.32 as entry point????? Seems like the stock is undervalued at this point given the likelihood of a STRONG q4 earnings number and the very real potential the company is acquired in 2018? I am in and plan on accumulating
An indirect measure of demand for containers is the demand for container ships (most of which are leased).https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.doPrices for the ship leases are up almost 150% (on average) over the last 6 months.This will benefit CAI. As the demand for containers is roughly equivalent.

"I looked back at past price movement and this stock can go from 37 to 44 in a matter of days! maybe these large price declines for no apparent reason is just ""normal"" for this stock? I hope so cause I m down big in just a short period of time! Good luck to all,"

Any news today?
Lol at the people buying at these obscene levels! .. why not wait for it to calm down and retrace back to upper 40’s?!
"so, everybody. barron's had a bullisch peace on $trtn and i think $cai is ready to deliver strong results tomorrow. i just bought more today. CEO is buying shares in the second quarter and so do i. it trades well below tangible book, has a great cash flow and all operations are running well. container is doing great, logistics is running hot in the US at the moment, railcar leasing is doing great with oil prices back at 70 again. what can possibly go wrong?"

Is this stock gonna come down? Why should I hold this?
Looks like CAI was out of cash and needed to borrow..Free cash flow is negative 15.00 a share.Over stepped their limits. How in the world are they to repay the over 2 billion they are in debt. One bounce down and they would have been broke..My guess 15.00 very soon.. Just can't get behind them on a day the Dow was up 300and they were down 5%
Riley Financial put a $60 price target on CAI on 3/26/21.It seems about right to me given the earnings we are about to see (over $7 this year and over $8 next year).A lowball PE = 8.5 gets you there.
Maybe manipulation afterhours. Feel like this still has a chance to go to $29 tomorrow. Everyone sees the market scare is over. This thing was near $40 recently and continues to outperform

"As I speculated 3 months ago, they have now announced a new share offering. This is not suprising given how fast the stock has risen and its excess over book value. It definitely makes sense for the company to pay down debt with the stock price so overpriced at this point. I like the company but not the shares up at these levels. Earnings will be down next quarter without the special items and normalized look like they are growing at about a 10% rate -- assuming the rail assets don't push that down. That should translate into a stock price back around $30 or slightly lower with annualized earnings probably between $2.80-$3.00 next year."

"Fill me in boys.I got into this company a week ago, just by looking at the chart going zig - zag. It was down so I guessed, it will go up. On Friday it went up.Coming week, will it go back down?Why did it go up 6%?I used same analogy but did more homework on ATHM and VST, but I am getting burnt there."
"4 month old article, but still useful. Says we are probably going to get an earnings beat for Q4 (and Q1). TRTN sells well above NAV, so CAI will also do so eventually."

Stocks being purchased at $25. Way too overvalued right now.

Looks like a great earnings report. Stock is up almost 9% in after hour trading. Could also be a great read on what TRTN will report on Friday.
Bought more shares. Too juicy.https://fbx.freightos.com/That shows the average price to rent a 40 ft container (40ft = 2 TEU).This will take a while to impact CAI (they only get these new prices as old contracts roll off).But if these prices last for a year (and I expect them to last for two years) then CAI is raking in cash for a long time forward. A public index for freight rates.

it makes little sense maybe a connection to the tariff being impossed on solar but it has little impact sector wide as container-shipping as a whole is concerned

I think this is looking good. Forward PE = 8. P/B = 1.1 and good growth. Charts seem like the sell-off is now over. Analysts have a target of $39 and I keep getting that number for fair value too.One analyst upped his recommendation from hold to buy this month. I suspect at least one of the other two holds are having a reconsider as we speak. I think 30% appreciation for next year is reasonably likely from here.
"Is this good news?!: ""CAI International, Inc. (CAI or the Company) (CAI), one of the world’s leading transportation finance and logistics companies, today announced that it had completed the purchase of 1,225,214 shares of its common stock, or approximately 6.0% of its outstanding common stock, from an affiliate of Andrew S. Ogawa in a privately-negotiated transaction. Mr. Ogawa is a member of the Company’s Board of Directors.The stock was purchased at a price of $22.81 per share, which represents a 2% discount to the closing price on May 1, 2018, and the shares will be subsequently retired.""As a board member, what does he know that we don't? Why would he sell with the stock price at a relatively low price in the market(and a 2% discount) if the prospects are so bright for CAI? If there is no reason to worry, then the company got a great deal. Otherwise, this could prove to be a reason to question any higher valuation."
