CAI is down 8.47% to $23.30
leases are for 10 years... if they can maintain $7-$8 profit for the next 10 years... what is the share price?
"so, everybody. barron's had a bullisch peace on $trtn and i think $cai is ready to deliver strong results tomorrow. i just bought more today. CEO is buying shares in the second quarter and so do i. it trades well below tangible book, has a great cash flow and all operations are running well. container is doing great, logistics is running hot in the US at the moment, railcar leasing is doing great with oil prices back at 70 again. what can possibly go wrong?"
HOW
I believe this stock is very undervalued. Freight companies are making big money and are loaded with cash. Why would they not pay $60 a share for earnings of 8? How could management refuse such an offer? The purchasing company does not need to make any radical changes. After the contracted deliveries and new charters are executed Cai stock is definitely worth 60 per share to for example Zim.

"Was the quarterly really THAT bad, or are shorts at work again? Comparing the also recent results with TGH caught flatfooted in a challenging environment absolutely doomed to improve in succeeding quarters, I think CAI is oversold. Consider especially now low container pricing against reduced supply of them, unsustainable suddenly. This company has less dependence on that anyway, more options in play. Great time to get on the better horse."

"they did say that although unit sales/leases should be strong going forward, they seem to expect prices to come down, and they also said that they expect their debt servicing expense to go up, and that there is increasing competition. I'm not saying this is expensive at all, but an investor could deduce from what CAI said in their earnings pr/conf call, that they and the sector have topped, and to expect lower earnings for the next few years going forward."

Yahoo either carries so much garbage on it that it trips up the functionality of its site, or it's not protecting it from massive hacking.Can't comment in depth due to that, as it's impossible to type properly.In thin trading, shorts are only ones selling, and have to be very happy after today. Maybe they're responsible for what I just described above.Burn the crooked parasites. BUY FROM THEM!!!"
lol the best stock to trade

"As I speculated 3 months ago, they have now announced a new share offering. This is not suprising given how fast the stock has risen and its excess over book value. It definitely makes sense for the company to pay down debt with the stock price so overpriced at this point. I like the company but not the shares up at these levels. Earnings will be down next quarter without the special items and normalized look like they are growing at about a 10% rate -- assuming the rail assets don't push that down. That should translate into a stock price back around $30 or slightly lower with annualized earnings probably between $2.80-$3.00 next year."
I think $32 is fair value. PE = 8 and equal to the book value. I suspect the company will continue buying back shares until that price.

Fantastic Q4. And the outlook for 2021 is great. We are definitely in an upcycle in container leasing and I like CAI is a leader in this sector. I'm increasing my holdings because we are underpriced at these levels.

Traded over $56 today. Any news on whether the Bid will be raised?
Looks like CAI was out of cash and needed to borrow..Free cash flow is negative 15.00 a share.Over stepped their limits. How in the world are they to repay the over 2 billion they are in debt. One bounce down and they would have been broke..My guess 15.00 very soon.. Just can't get behind them on a day the Dow was up 300and they were down 5%

"Does anyone else get the feeling the company is ready to announce a secondary share offering? I get that feeling based on the price action after the recent run up. It looks like potential buyers are selling short to get ready to buy shares on the offering and at times, the underwriters and others who would be in the selling group are trying to support the shares so the price does not drift too low prior to the offering. This is pure speculation based on the seemingly wide swings and sometimes a fairly large gap opening up between the bid and ask."
CAI is up 12.40% to 14.73
"Zacks rating are a joke. But Ford Equity Research upped CAI to a #1 buy on 8/21 (less than 9% of their rated stocks get a 1). In addition, MarketEdge which does technical analysis moved it to ""long"" on 8/31."
"Be careful with after hours trading in thinly traded stock like this. Earnings are decent but just in line with expectations and down from last quarter (adjusted number, not with the huge one time gain). Based on previous action, CAI could head back below $20 tomorrow, especially if the whole market is weak and gives up some of today's large gains before the weekend. However, if it does, that might be a good long term entry point. Downside risks are still rather weak rail component and chance that management overbuys containers again during good times."
CAI is up 7.45% to 44.56
With that beat shouldn't this be soaring after hours? What gives?
I think this is looking good. Forward PE = 8. P/B = 1.1 and good growth. Charts seem like the sell-off is now over. Analysts have a target of $39 and I keep getting that number for fair value too.One analyst upped his recommendation from hold to buy this month. I suspect at least one of the other two holds are having a reconsider as we speak. I think 30% appreciation for next year is reasonably likely from here.

"Is this good news?!: ""CAI International, Inc. (CAI or the Company) (CAI), one of the world’s leading transportation finance and logistics companies, today announced that it had completed the purchase of 1,225,214 shares of its common stock, or approximately 6.0% of its outstanding common stock, from an affiliate of Andrew S. Ogawa in a privately-negotiated transaction. Mr. Ogawa is a member of the Company’s Board of Directors.The stock was purchased at a price of $22.81 per share, which represents a 2% discount to the closing price on May 1, 2018, and the shares will be subsequently retired.""As a board member, what does he know that we don't? Why would he sell with the stock price at a relatively low price in the market(and a 2% discount) if the prospects are so bright for CAI? If there is no reason to worry, then the company got a great deal. Otherwise, this could prove to be a reason to question any higher valuation."

They had some interesting insights about CAI on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.

Can we service all the debt? What if costs rise? I like the dividend coverage otherwise
"Really pleased. I have a small holding in this. Opened it last week when I saw the report from the Port of Charleston. I have a larger stake in the big player, but the spike in this one almost makes me wish it was the other way.Lol, making money in both. Love this industry.GLA"

"Chart shows classic descending triangle with base side at $20. 50 day ema has negative slope that is above 200 day ema, but not for long. Financials look better than the chart, but the trend is in, and it's negative. A dividend--which CAI can afford--would help. The private sale of a big chunk of the float by a principal didn't help either. Buy at $20."

"I read that half a million TEU of containers will be tied up in Hanjin vessel seizures and must wait for the courts to sort out the disposition. Suddenly there IS a shortage of available containers, and leasers will be able to name their price in 100% utilization, at least until that's freed up. Ideas on how this plays out?"
If someone could answer would be very helpful… does this price freeze or will it move?

"In the last 3 quarters, earnings estimates have jumped from .13 per share to .56 last quarter and now up to .70 for this next earnings quarter.Here's a quote from Briefing.com about the coming quarter and year. "" Demand for new containers picked up late last year and continues to be strong as the peak shipping season gets under way. Delays at various ports around the world are contributing to strong demand for new containers. In addition, CAI is putting new containers on lease at record levels. In fact, management forecast that 2017 will be the strongest lease-out year in the company's history""."

No matter how you look at it these guys are growing dramatically. A year ago this quarter they missed analysts estimates by .22 and lost .09 for the qtr. Today they made $1.03 per share for the qtr.- Look for another increase in institutional buying in the weeks to come.

"Volume was remarkably low in this stock on Friday, as on many days. In the late AM, I put in a limit order for 400 with Fidelity at 8.09, even though I'm overweight with it, buying the dip again. Late in the session, the low went to 8.10 and I got a partial fill, 59 shares. The close was 8.11. The buy was unreported at NASDAQ, and Fidelity itself set the official low at 8.10, not 8.09. In my view, they did it in-house to steal an undeserved commission, and why? Because they don't make enough already? The cost of those shares to me was 8.225. They do this petty harassment to me all the time, and I complained in 2 online chats to give them an opportunity to fix it. They stonewalled, insisting it was a good fill. I alerted SEC. Not holding my breath... It's abusive and manipulative, and you should be warned about them, thinking they can do anything they want.Not worried. Price is ridiculously low anyway, but that should offer some clues as to why.Buy a bunch and make some $ while it's so low and just as easily pushed up. Show 'em!"
J Mintzmyer said onTwitterBetting that whomever sold box lessors today is feeling mega-stupid.... Huge resounding buy signal for the entire containership and box space as Mitsubishi Capital buys out $CAI for a 47% premium. Who is next? $TGH or $TRTN ? How long until $DAC or $GSL gets a bid? #shipping
Bought more shares. Too juicy.https://fbx.freightos.com/That shows the average price to rent a 40 ft container (40ft = 2 TEU).This will take a while to impact CAI (they only get these new prices as old contracts roll off).But if these prices last for a year (and I expect them to last for two years) then CAI is raking in cash for a long time forward. A public index for freight rates.

Then compare their charts from the last session.Then tell me I'm wrong...
"It looks as if CAI superiority in this industry by its diversification is beginning to be recognized, and they are the right size to grow, plenty of room for it. They played the slowdown extremely well by shifting new investment into rail and logistics capabilities. Again, the size offers that flexibility. Smart bunch. Extremely undervalued (check outrageous book), and container trade will pick up again very soon, though they need that less than competitors do. Safe bet in uncertain times."

An indirect measure of demand for containers is the demand for container ships (most of which are leased).https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.doPrices for the ship leases are up almost 150% (on average) over the last 6 months.This will benefit CAI. As the demand for containers is roughly equivalent.
Why is this stock stuck still
Thoughts on 28.32 as entry point????? Seems like the stock is undervalued at this point given the likelihood of a STRONG q4 earnings number and the very real potential the company is acquired in 2018? I am in and plan on accumulating

Riley Financial put a $60 price target on CAI on 3/26/21.It seems about right to me given the earnings we are about to see (over $7 this year and over $8 next year).A lowball PE = 8.5 gets you there.
