Looks like ENTG was pushed down again intentionally. No reason for 5% drop on a 17% increase in revenue and meeting expectations. Just added more as I've seen this before.

Any thoughts on ENTG earning. After reading 10k and earnings transcript going forward looks bright. I hope this week things turn around not sure where the bottom is but must be getting close. probably build a base here and start to move up. Great company/good earning/products in high demand and the list goes on. Let's see what this week brings

Analysts range for Q 4 is $.64-.67.....I'm thinking we will beat (perhaps report $.70) and add another $.20 (at least) to next year's estimate.

I am now looking for Q4 EPS of $69non-GAAP giving us $2.51 for FY 2020.Preliminary 2021 now looks to be between $2.98 and $3.10; however I'm looking for company to continue buying back shares and perhaps making another acquisition....still have a shot at my previous $3.25 reach number....but it'll take some doing.Still comfy with multiple between 30 & 33 X next year....target price $89-$102....decent enough for me to hold....as ENTG is a special niche company with unique products.

"One should think of ENTG as a ""technology enabler"" to the global semi industry. They continue to deliver excellent results....and the company should earn upwards of $2.50 this year and above $3.00 next year....in fact, with demand in the semi industry picking up, ENTG may be able to earn $3.25 next year. They deserve a P/E of at least 30."

"ASML delivers a huge beat in first Q EPS and revenues, guides for strong growth....this is all good for ENTG which at $110-$111, is undervalued by aprox 20% on a go-forward expectation."
Nice write-up in this weekend's IBD...confirms strength in chip markets through 2023 and ENTG as a significant player in that growth....I've owned this stock for a decade and they always execute exceptionally well vs market growth dynamics. I would not be surprised to see EPS growth in mid 20% range for the next three years....along with perhaps one or more accretive acquisitions.

"Entegris Reports Record Sales and Earnings in First Quarter of 2018! And what does Record sales and Earning due for Share Price... drop 1.5% of course, on an up-market day!?! What the h3ll is up with this SP action???"
Note to self: ENTG is in long-term buy range as its relative valuation vs ASML is exceptional. Check these two companies EPS growth rates over the past 10 years and you’ll see the obvious valuation disparity.

"More stringent material controls to help EUV lithography scaling (higher purity, better materials handling) should help Entegris a lot. Apple has made the jump to EUV with their A14 Bionic (5 nm) with TSMC, soon others will follow. This is a big step for the industry."
"My 10-year ""look ahead"" analysis for ENTG shows an annual compound total return of between 17-18.5% before any possible accretive acquisitions or share repurchases. This analysis assumes a two year 21% EPS growth rate, two additional years at 20%, a fifth year at 18% and the final five years tapering to 16%."

Take over next week
$ 140 MM breakup fee will be a nice add to the company's war chest going forward. Beats doing a financing and paying IB fees.
