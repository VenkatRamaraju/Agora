Why drop
Looks like ENTG was pushed down again intentionally. No reason for 5% drop on a 17% increase in revenue and meeting expectations. Just added more as I've seen this before.
Congratulations from GS not bad Sequential growth WS LOVES GROWTH. Guy I know told me about ENTG and I don't understand WHY I have never heard of them. I think its a winner also CMTL few know about them get a new contract every week.
Whay do u guys think is it a good time to buy now?
Entegris reached an all time high at 79.72
"One should think of ENTG as a ""technology enabler"" to the global semi industry. They continue to deliver excellent results....and the company should earn upwards of $2.50 this year and above $3.00 next year....in fact, with demand in the semi industry picking up, ENTG may be able to earn $3.25 next year. They deserve a P/E of at least 30."
We going to the moon!!!! 
Nice write-up in this weekend's IBD...confirms strength in chip markets through 2023 and ENTG as a significant player in that growth....I've owned this stock for a decade and they always execute exceptionally well vs market growth dynamics. I would not be surprised to see EPS growth in mid 20% range for the next three years....along with perhaps one or more accretive acquisitions.
"My 10-year ""look ahead"" analysis for ENTG shows an annual compound total return of between 17-18.5% before any possible accretive acquisitions or share repurchases. This analysis assumes a two year 21% EPS growth rate, two additional years at 20%, a fifth year at 18% and the final five years tapering to 16%."
Entegris reached an all time high at 137.48
$ 140 MM breakup fee will be a nice add to the company's war chest going forward. Beats doing a financing and paying IB fees.
"Under $130 it's a high P/E fast grower available at good, not great, value. I'd be a buyer under $130 as it fits into a fast growth, high quality space. They also have a nice moat around their business model."
ENTG reached a new All Time High at 34.35
"Entegris EPS beats by $0.04, misses on revenueApr. 21, 2020 6:03 AM ETEntegris, Inc. (ENTG)Entegris (NASDAQ:ENTG): Q1 Non-GAAP EPS of $0.55 beats by $0.04; GAAP EPS of $0.45 beats by $0.05.Revenue of $412.33M (+5.4% Y/Y) misses by $4.01M."
Where is share price headed??Its now $94 and change
I am now looking for Q4 EPS of $69non-GAAP giving us $2.51 for FY 2020.Preliminary 2021 now looks to be between $2.98 and $3.10; however I'm looking for company to continue buying back shares and perhaps making another acquisition....still have a shot at my previous $3.25 reach number....but it'll take some doing.Still comfy with multiple between 30 & 33 X next year....target price $89-$102....decent enough for me to hold....as ENTG is a special niche company with unique products.
ENTG is up 4.95% to 37.63
Why is this one drifting lower in a hot market ....I'm a long term holder with a nice profit...what next
Thank You INTC
Picked up a little more 116.80-semi's shortage hurting.Earnings 4-29
Thank you TSM !!!
Note to self: ENTG is in long-term buy range as its relative valuation vs ASML is exceptional. Check these two companies EPS growth rates over the past 10 years and youâ€™ll see the obvious valuation disparity.
10 bagger in 3 years. guaranteed. they have a beautiful business plan.
VERY high volume and up over 4%. Some news out there I am not seeing ?
how arent more people here talking about this stock
"ASML delivers a huge beat in first Q EPS and revenues, guides for strong growth....this is all good for ENTG which at $110-$111, is undervalued by aprox 20% on a go-forward expectation."

Entegris reached an all time high at 91.92
"Question for the board: what caused the sizable 40% increase in long-term debt from 2017 to 2018?Long Term Debt $934,863 (2018) $574,380 (2017)Thanks!"
Bought this stock around $83 and starting to wonder. Do we have a lot of people shorting this stock?
"Entegris Reports Record Sales and Earnings in First Quarter of 2018! And what does Record sales and Earning due for Share Price... drop 1.5% of course, on an up-market day!?! What the h3ll is up with this SP action???"
ENTG reached a new All Time High at 33.40
Analysts range for Q 4 is $.64-.67.....I'm thinking we will beat (perhaps report $.70) and add another $.20 (at least) to next year's estimate.
"Alright, who's selling, and didn't hold their ground?"
"Something going on here. A revenue and earnings miss and stock up 2 days in a row on above average volume. Is there a takeover in the wings? In any event, it was nice to pick up the breakup fee...that can be used to help fund acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends.All good from where I sit."
Any thoughts on ENTG earning. After reading 10k and earnings transcript going forward looks bright. I hope this week things turn around not sure where the bottom is but must be getting close. probably build a base here and start to move up. Great company/good earning/products in high demand and the list goes on. Let's see what this week brings
50% of the gains in the last 11 months wiped out in 6 hours due do 1 chip mfg backing off guidance by 10%. Unbelievable!!!
Sold all 118.20 small loss-afraid of semi's. GLL
"More stringent material controls to help EUV lithography scaling (higher purity, better materials handling) should help Entegris a lot. Apple has made the jump to EUV with their A14 Bionic (5 nm) with TSMC, soon others will follow. This is a big step for the industry."
Is there anyone out there that can explain the drop today? Pretty good volume.....no news at any website. What's up?
