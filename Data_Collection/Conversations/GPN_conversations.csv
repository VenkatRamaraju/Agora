So what’s the fundamental difference between GPN and SQ?
The debt 10 billion and longterm liabilities 14 billion is keeping this stock down.. even with nice rev and earnings growth.. the company is not profitable
GPN reached a new All Time High at 109.15
I am so over with GPN . Never recovered from pandemic. Still down over 20 percent from all time high. Moving up and down like a turtle. I am cashing out. Bought SQ and PYPl already covered for the lost . Best luck with y’all . I am out !!!

GPN reached a 52 Week low at $94.81
I think it's still a good time to buy GPN stock.Because they're expanding mobile integration payment solutions to Samsung and will drive its Samsung Pay cash service: https://www.globalpaymentsinc.com/en-ca/accept-payments/mobileSo GPN will most likely go up for a while. Plus I don't see any downside risk shortly.Which will make it a great Fintech stock to consider right now.
What it is going on? I don't get it

hmmbond yields drop caused this or what?V and MA and most of the banks are down
Does anyone have any idea on why the large move after hours today?
"Looks like FISV and V earnings and comments are causing this. Silly to sell now, wait for a calmer period. Good luck."
Worldpay is a better company. WP

"Glad I didn't make a move yesterday when I was researching both GPN and FIS - both looked like a good buy but I couldn't make up my mind - GPN was down 7.6% and FIS 6.7% today. Not sure why as I can't find any news or any insight after reading the previous comments on this board. A guess off the top of my head would be something to do with a new competitor in this space. Not sure who but I don't know what else would cause both of these to plummet - especially since by all analyst calls they were significantly undervalued before the day began. BOA/Merrill has a $226 target, Morningstar $186 and CFRA $229 on GPN. While in the same order - FIS's targets are $173, $142 and $180. Either both stocks became better buys today or we're missing some information."
"Just the shorties playing the game and purposefully keeping this down.... One fine day, this will start shooting up... An easy 200 target....possibly higher.. Not budging a bit here...."

Oversold reaction today to SQ's purchase of Afterpay. Traditional credit card processing will continue to rule all digital payments as I see the buy now and pay later gimmick to just be that...a gimmick. Sounds good but the market wont be that big for it.Back up the GPN truck. The lower it goes the more ripe it is for a takeover so downside here is very limited.
"Forward PE of 16 for a growing company is pretty cheap right now. Once tax loss selling is over, we will trade at least 25% higher."

It has dropped to level in last March. How things can be worse than last March with the world being unlocked slowly?

"I suspect the drop is collateral to the PAX Global Technology Ltd. drop. Those PAX payment terminals are causing security concerns, and folks are calling for them to be replaced. I'm not sure how this would negatively impact GPN, so I suspect it'll bounce back quick."
Up >10% in three trading days since my first small buy of GPN. Not too shabby %^ ).
What are we missing here? This is quite a drop on decent quarter results!!!

"I've been with Heartland for 18 years. Today at ONE of my locations I inquired about cancellation an proceeded to have the rep cancel. I was unaware I was in a contract that expired in two weeks.. I inquired about the fee and was told that since my contract expired in Dec 2019 I would be charged the 300$ fee.. I then requested to cancel the request to cancel and was told .. ""TOO LATE"" ... Looks like I will be changing processors for my larger accounts whom also were with Heartland.. What a low life way to operate a business.. then again.. I wouldn't expect more from a CC processor, but in the end they will end up losing out.. Heartland had great customer service.. Global Payments Inc..."
Totally manipulated

"I totally think it is the Square-AfterPay deal that did this stock in. Here's how I see it.. Only pureplay companies in competition with Square are Paypal and GlobalPayments. ApplePay and Google Pay are dpertments within companies doing other things. Visa and Mastercard are not directly competing, even though they will lose some market share when people decide to pay with the payment apps that act like debit cards.Banks are getting disintermediated, but because it is going to take a longer time for that to happen, they are not affected by today's news of SQ buying AfterPay. SQ still doesn't have as many customer as all the banks combined.Credit Card companies are only beginning to get affected by the SQ purchase, so they lost only a little price-wise today.AFRM and Klarna are now up for grabs. I think people are thinking PayPal might make the move next, which is why PayPal isn't affected much.That leaves Global Payments without a partner, so it crashes. Come on, GP -- make the move before PayPal does.I think Global Payments will rebound a bit after today's bath, but after it bounces, I might slowly leave. Their numbers are great (for now), but the future is somewhat uncertain."

"Folks look at the one year chart; for 3 earnings reports in a row, the stock sold off hard! Not sure why?? Need to read each report. But this seems pretty odd! I did look at the chart yahoo has in the summary page and they beat on all 3 by about a 5 cents on average. After the reports it recovered for a good gain on each one?? Beat me, seems odd to me?? It recovered 3 times will it recover for a forth time?"

GPN best value in fintech right now!
I am really surprised that this stock reacted negatively post earnings with a deal with AWS. Very little news and analyst coverage in regard to this once hot stock. The stock seems to have hit a major cold streak and I would be interested if anyone had any additional insight they would be willing to share.

BUY GPN
Global Payments is down 4.92% to 148.29
"With all the consolidation in this industry, I wonder if GPN would ever consider buying SQ?"
Any idea on the large drop in GPN today and yesterday and why this stock has underperformed the markets in the past couple of weeks?
