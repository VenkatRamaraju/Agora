It's alive?!
What's wrong with it? Why it's broken since May?
GPN reached a new All Time High at 120.96
Global Payments is up 8.98% to 189.49
What it is going on? I don't get it
"Great price for an industry that is only going to grow, with many different countries supporting it."
This absolutely makes no sense but is on par with other companies in this space minus Square.
"watch gpn stock closely, excellent stock, check out this technical analysis and chart https://businesswatch.news/2019/01/06/global-payments-inc-gpn/"

"BofA Securities Adjusts Global Payments' Price Objective to $226 From $221, Keeps Buy Rating"
I am really surprised that this stock reacted negatively post earnings with a deal with AWS. Very little news and analyst coverage in regard to this once hot stock. The stock seems to have hit a major cold streak and I would be interested if anyone had any additional insight they would be willing to share.

What is the support for this stock? Looking to buy in.

How is FOUR shift for payments not just as good as GPN?Either GPN is much too expensive or FOUR is much too cheap.

Global Payments is down 4.91% to 183.92
got in at 170 today looks like its sold out should be a good value at this price
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/down-12-1-4-weeks-140002805.htmlOversold territory
what it is going on? they beat the expectation
I think it's still a good time to buy GPN stock.Because they're expanding mobile integration payment solutions to Samsung and will drive its Samsung Pay cash service: https://www.globalpaymentsinc.com/en-ca/accept-payments/mobileSo GPN will most likely go up for a while. Plus I don't see any downside risk shortly.Which will make it a great Fintech stock to consider right now.
"I think its a decent time to get in if you are value hunting. Isn't Warren Buffet level of safety but its a mobile payment company what do you expect, ride it up to the peak and sell for a quick 20% profit. Not bad."
GPN best value in fintech right now!
Global Payments is down 4.94% to 172.79
Another strong quarter!!
Global Payments is up 5.46% to 165.70
"Institutions own 90% of the float, they can do whatever they want….. I say they can go **^* themselves!"
How do you like another dominating payment company qiwi in the east? Video showing Qiwi leading payment techo in the former russian blocks.
GPN has had a great run this year and yet nobody here is talking about it. Great company.
Great company at buy point
"Bought some in the $172-173 range, mkt overreacted."

"Try ENVA if you’re in GPN, PE of 3. Low float, monster earnings,"
"Why the low dividend on this? When the TSS deal goes through, they have, before purchase costs, $6.25 of profit combined. RAISE THE DIVIDEND PLEASE."
Always drop
analysis compare this to $GPN with 290M float so why do they write BFT may only double?
why is gpn not going along with the market
GPN reached a 52 Week low at 130.84
"Buy the dips, there’s very few"
BUY GPN
"I really don't get it - good strategy expansion, in the future all the payments will be electronic and in the undeveloped countries more than in the west as they don't have infrastructure ... good results WHAT A @@@@@?"
GPN reached a new All Time High at 105.99
back to $190+
GPN reached a new All Time High at 116.64
"Long-term debt of $10.2 billion increased 20.7% from the 2020-end level. Concurrently, management approved a 28.2% hike in the quarterly dividend based on which the company will now pay out a dividend of 25 cents per share compared with the prior payout of 19.5 cents. This make the drop?"
This will bounce back soon. Be patient
"""Institutional investors hold a majority ownership of GPN through the 89.25% of the outstanding shares that they control. This interest is also higher than at almost any other company in the Data Processing Services industry."""
"Just the shorties playing the game and purposefully keeping this down.... One fine day, this will start shooting up... An easy 200 target....possibly higher.. Not budging a bit here...."
"I think this is the reason all the companies in the space are down.........Square to buy Australia’s Afterpay in $29 billion deal as ‘buy now, pay later’ trend takes off."
80 pe... NO THANK YOU
Have a look to MU they did the same on best results ever 20% drop - sheer manipulation
Anyone know why there is so much downward pressure on this stock?
The last three months have been absolutely brutal.￼
Global Payments is down 5.04% to 184.14
Oversold reaction today to SQ's purchase of Afterpay. Traditional credit card processing will continue to rule all digital payments as I see the buy now and pay later gimmick to just be that...a gimmick. Sounds good but the market wont be that big for it.Back up the GPN truck. The lower it goes the more ripe it is for a takeover so downside here is very limited.
Ouch again. Oh well.
Totally manipulated
Up >10% in three trading days since my first small buy of GPN. Not too shabby %^ ).
It’s going to rocket up 10% tomorrow.
GPN reached a new All Time High at 109.15
"I've been with Heartland for 18 years. Today at ONE of my locations I inquired about cancellation an proceeded to have the rep cancel. I was unaware I was in a contract that expired in two weeks.. I inquired about the fee and was told that since my contract expired in Dec 2019 I would be charged the 300$ fee.. I then requested to cancel the request to cancel and was told .. ""TOO LATE"" ... Looks like I will be changing processors for my larger accounts whom also were with Heartland.. What a low life way to operate a business.. then again.. I wouldn't expect more from a CC processor, but in the end they will end up losing out.. Heartland had great customer service.. Global Payments Inc..."
Looks like 2020 will be another strong year for GPN

"Global Payments Inc CEO Jeff Sloan said in an interview he would be open to a large acquisition again, two years after acquiring peer TSYS in a $21.5 billion all-stock deal, while continuing to chase small bolt-on purchases to bolster growth.""I certainly see deals as big as TSYS in our future,"" Sloan, who has led the Atlanta-based payments processor since 2013, told Reuters last week. He also emphasized that an acquisition or merger would have to open markets to #GPN that they currently are not in. Sounds like #FIS fits that bill quite nicely!"
Global Payments is up 4.95% to 172.90

"Poor Jeff Sloan, he has to find a new gig at age 54. Square will win. Global will lose. Cheers!"
I think my computer monitor may be broken. It's showing that GPN is up today...I though it always went down. :)

"Today's jobs number was just what the space needed to make a comeback. GPN, FISV, FIS all up."
Why can’t this catch a bid?

Any idea on the large drop in GPN today and yesterday and why this stock has underperformed the markets in the past couple of weeks?

"I totally think it is the Square-AfterPay deal that did this stock in. Here's how I see it.. Only pureplay companies in competition with Square are Paypal and GlobalPayments. ApplePay and Google Pay are dpertments within companies doing other things. Visa and Mastercard are not directly competing, even though they will lose some market share when people decide to pay with the payment apps that act like debit cards.Banks are getting disintermediated, but because it is going to take a longer time for that to happen, they are not affected by today's news of SQ buying AfterPay. SQ still doesn't have as many customer as all the banks combined.Credit Card companies are only beginning to get affected by the SQ purchase, so they lost only a little price-wise today.AFRM and Klarna are now up for grabs. I think people are thinking PayPal might make the move next, which is why PayPal isn't affected much.That leaves Global Payments without a partner, so it crashes. Come on, GP -- make the move before PayPal does.I think Global Payments will rebound a bit after today's bath, but after it bounces, I might slowly leave. Their numbers are great (for now), but the future is somewhat uncertain."
Why is this so expensive? Not even a growth stock
Worldpay is a better company. WP
The debt 10 billion and longterm liabilities 14 billion is keeping this stock down.. even with nice rev and earnings growth.. the company is not profitable
"Been following this stock for a month since I bought a number of losing calls on this dog. Seems like once a week it rallies $4 or $5 a share to maybe $171-$172, on Fridays, then quickly goes back to the $165-$167 range. Strange."
This stocks worth 250
OMG. Steal at this price. Who wants free money!!!
Does anyone have any idea on why the large move after hours today?
Ouch. Times ten.
Profit taking after earnings call. Volume trading below average volume
This #$%$ stock has been painful to hold.
"Folks look at the one year chart; for 3 earnings reports in a row, the stock sold off hard! Not sure why?? Need to read each report. But this seems pretty odd! I did look at the chart yahoo has in the summary page and they beat on all 3 by about a 5 cents on average. After the reports it recovered for a good gain on each one?? Beat me, seems odd to me?? It recovered 3 times will it recover for a forth time?"
add here way oversold under $180
Multiple Technical patterns suggests significant upside

Been following this stock the past week or so and think I'm happier owning PYPL.
