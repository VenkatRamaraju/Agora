bought more with the earnings beat.This stock is a winner. Time to load up!
"I suspect the drop is collateral to the PAX Global Technology Ltd. drop. Those PAX payment terminals are causing security concerns, and folks are calling for them to be replaced. I'm not sure how this would negatively impact GPN, so I suspect it'll bounce back quick."
"Why the low dividend on this? When the TSS deal goes through, they have, before purchase costs, $6.25 of profit combined. RAISE THE DIVIDEND PLEASE."
Any idea on the large drop in GPN today and yesterday and why this stock has underperformed the markets in the past couple of weeks?
What are we missing here? This is quite a drop on decent quarter results!!!
Anyone know why there is so much downward pressure on this stock?
Oversold reaction today to SQ's purchase of Afterpay. Traditional credit card processing will continue to rule all digital payments as I see the buy now and pay later gimmick to just be that...a gimmick. Sounds good but the market wont be that big for it.Back up the GPN truck. The lower it goes the more ripe it is for a takeover so downside here is very limited.
The debt 10 billion and longterm liabilities 14 billion is keeping this stock down.. even with nice rev and earnings growth.. the company is not profitable
"Glad I didn't make a move yesterday when I was researching both GPN and FIS - both looked like a good buy but I couldn't make up my mind - GPN was down 7.6% and FIS 6.7% today. Not sure why as I can't find any news or any insight after reading the previous comments on this board. A guess off the top of my head would be something to do with a new competitor in this space. Not sure who but I don't know what else would cause both of these to plummet - especially since by all analyst calls they were significantly undervalued before the day began. BOA/Merrill has a $226 target, Morningstar $186 and CFRA $229 on GPN. While in the same order - FIS's targets are $173, $142 and $180. Either both stocks became better buys today or we're missing some information."
"I totally think it is the Square-AfterPay deal that did this stock in. Here's how I see it.. Only pureplay companies in competition with Square are Paypal and GlobalPayments. ApplePay and Google Pay are dpertments within companies doing other things. Visa and Mastercard are not directly competing, even though they will lose some market share when people decide to pay with the payment apps that act like debit cards.Banks are getting disintermediated, but because it is going to take a longer time for that to happen, they are not affected by today's news of SQ buying AfterPay. SQ still doesn't have as many customer as all the banks combined.Credit Card companies are only beginning to get affected by the SQ purchase, so they lost only a little price-wise today.AFRM and Klarna are now up for grabs. I think people are thinking PayPal might make the move next, which is why PayPal isn't affected much.That leaves Global Payments without a partner, so it crashes. Come on, GP -- make the move before PayPal does.I think Global Payments will rebound a bit after today's bath, but after it bounces, I might slowly leave. Their numbers are great (for now), but the future is somewhat uncertain."
Global Payments reached a 52 Week low at 146.85
"Forward PE of 16 for a growing company is pretty cheap right now. Once tax loss selling is over, we will trade at least 25% higher."
"I think this is the reason all the companies in the space are down.........Square to buy Australia’s Afterpay in $29 billion deal as ‘buy now, pay later’ trend takes off."
"Long-term debt of $10.2 billion increased 20.7% from the 2020-end level. Concurrently, management approved a 28.2% hike in the quarterly dividend based on which the company will now pay out a dividend of 25 cents per share compared with the prior payout of 19.5 cents. This make the drop?"
hmmbond yields drop caused this or what?V and MA and most of the banks are down
Bought calls for 9/17 at $170 and $175!
What is the support for this stock? Looking to buy in.
what's up with this stock did I just buy another Alibaba #$%$ storm
"Just the shorties playing the game and purposefully keeping this down.... One fine day, this will start shooting up... An easy 200 target....possibly higher.. Not budging a bit here...."
Oversold and good company get ready for nice bounce
Up >10% in three trading days since my first small buy of GPN. Not too shabby %^ ).
The last three months have been absolutely brutal.￼
What's wrong with it? Why it's broken since May?
"I think its a decent time to get in if you are value hunting. Isn't Warren Buffet level of safety but its a mobile payment company what do you expect, ride it up to the peak and sell for a quick 20% profit. Not bad."
"Looks like a good entry point to me, gonna start buying shares as well as call options."
Bought at 144
Tomorrow it will be in green reversal going to be happened
It has dropped to level in last March. How things can be worse than last March with the world being unlocked slowly?
BMO Capital upgraded GPN to Outperform with $206 price target 
I am really surprised that this stock reacted negatively post earnings with a deal with AWS. Very little news and analyst coverage in regard to this once hot stock. The stock seems to have hit a major cold streak and I would be interested if anyone had any additional insight they would be willing to share.
"Looks like FISV and V earnings and comments are causing this. Silly to sell now, wait for a calmer period. Good luck."
Ouch again. Oh well.
analysis compare this to $GPN with 290M float so why do they write BFT may only double?
Doesn't make sense at all.
"wow, just falling from the cliffany news in US on financial sector?"
All cash $500M acquisition 
"Been following this stock for a month since I bought a number of losing calls on this dog. Seems like once a week it rallies $4 or $5 a share to maybe $171-$172, on Fridays, then quickly goes back to the $165-$167 range. Strange."

"""Institutional investors hold a majority ownership of GPN through the 89.25% of the outstanding shares that they control. This interest is also higher than at almost any other company in the Data Processing Services industry."""
It's alive?!
