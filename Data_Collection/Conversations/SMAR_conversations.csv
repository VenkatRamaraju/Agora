Up on a Down day....Gltal
This hitting 49 tomorrow?
This should pop to 60s easily today
SMAR is red today. Why?
"Something is really wrong at Smartsheet $SMAR1) New accounting risk factors2) Auditor finds material weaknesses 3) Auditor fired the day before Q1 ends4) Audit partner had a bad history5) CFO “retired”6) Stock at all-time highs7) Massive cash burn- copied from ""CrowdedTradeCap"""
"Beat on revs and earnings, outlook inline with forecast. Stock should be flat tomorrow if anything."
careful
"I think that if the market continues to rise, SMAR may end in green, but I doubt that the market remains so strong until the end, it has risen all this week and all the shares rose a lot except SMAR, it is very logical that the winners want liquidate your decisions to collect your profits."
"Weeeee...It's 1999 all over again. Anyone remember that year? That's when many tech companies with no profits, like SMAR, MDB and others, basically went parabolic based on ""hope"". Since hope is not a strategy, and we're in a global slowdown and a bear market rally, it won't be long before all the market gains reverse. Don't take my word for it though, just look at Federal Express's report out this evening."
This seems like a solid high growth buy for really good future potential returns.. I understand it is expensive.. but overvalued..? Will start DCAing in.
Good report but weak guidance.
Price target raised to $60?
Well it looks like past repeat itself.Same was 2018 when every company reported better then expected ER and stock was still falling.Make me think...perhaps market will correct itself soon.Let see how other companies will do after good ER
Got in at 45.88 and looking for 50 tomorrow.
"Shorts, The more you short, The higher it goes & The longer you hold, The more you'll Lose. Guaranteed!Cover and go long. This raging bull will not stop until Mid $50's.Everyone in every industry is using their technology specially when working remotely from home.DO NOT HOLD IF YOU ARE SHORT. YOU'LL ONLY LOSE MORE."
"While I hold CLDR MDB and SMAR, I think all 3 are good HOLDs for up coming years."
"This board is like the stock price, lifeless it seems."
"$46 is a fair valueif you want to bottom fish or go long on SMAR, do not touch it unless it goes under $40...possibly around $37 - 38 level."
This was $50 pre covid. This wasn't just inflated from covid. It'll be back up over $50 soon.
Strong report I think it will move up tomorrow.
"Sorry but this to be this red after all the below was a massive short attack Smartsheet Fiscal Q2 Adjusted Loss Narrows as Revenue Rises Issues Q3/FY2022 Guidance; Brokerages Lift Share-Price TargetsBY MT Newswires02:59 PM EDT, 09/08/2021 (MT Newswires) -- (Updates with the stock move and analyst stock rating upgrades in the last two paragraphs.)Smartsheet ( SMAR Loading...Loading...) reported late Tuesday a fiscal Q2 adjusted loss of $0.05 per share, narrower than a loss of $0.06 per share a year ago.Analysts polled by Capital IQ were expecting an adjusted loss of $0.13 per share.Revenue increased 44% year over year to $131.7 million. The Street called for $125.5 million.Following the release of fiscal Q2 results, several Wall Street firms increased their respective share-price target for the firm, including Citigroup, Oppenheimer, Wells Fargo, Canaccord Genuity, Truist Securities, BMO Capital, JPMorgan Chase, Jefferies & Co., and Needham."
Chart looks great. About to break out above resistance. Been adding modest numbers of shares. It's volatile and the market is scary. Definitely will look to buy into strength if it continues tomorrow.
"Know nothing about the company, but its chart looks like a disaster waiting to happen. I'd recommend studying the last 10-Q closely before the 9'4 earnings release to see if any underlying fundamentals have developed."
huge earnings report this afternoon watch out.
When is Er coming ?
"Seems to be trading in tandem with the rest of the cloud space, but that's ok."
"Lockout date- 10/24/2018Smartsheet (SMAR)10/24/2018 Number of Shares 11,633,920 Initial Share Price $15.00 Offer Size $174,508,800 Date Priced 4/27/2018"

"It appears they work half a day--go to lunch and never return, like a downward staircase! :("
Well I def lost money bought calls at 205 to be at $50
"Wow, there must be some shorts getting violated right now for these new negative posts to be coming up"
insiders are selling at the alarming rate. anyone knows anything?
Longs got crushed!
SMAR is down 9.24% to $20.43
"Can't believe the overselling here, the company grew it's revenue and on the way to grow more!"
LYFT ipo price 65.00. !!! can you digest this ?? market has gone crazy. If anyone buys at ipo price they are gonna loose when it dips a fewdays after. 80% of these companies in the market are a playing game backed by wall street and sec to steal your money.
Keep going down. Any bad new?
Great report!!
I am considering selling at a lost and buying more CLDR which is undervalued. I do not have much in this stock.. 20 shares only.
bought more today
How far does it drop as we get closer to lockup date? Any guesses?
LONG & STRONG. Solid company with lots of cash and little debt.
how is this even red.. with earnings beat and upgrades.. BS on this one
ZI is good option 
Congrats to all Longs! Great Company here!!
next software company to get acquired
"After earnings it will move north of $30 $SMAR is a great small company . It has a small float circa 2 millions. They have a great product investment bankers and many other businesses will need smart sheet's software. As soon as earnings will increase, this stock will be circa $100 in less than two years."
4.5B valuation for a google spreadsheet company? Short away.
Smartsheet is down 4.93% to 68.41
TOLDYA !!! TOmorrow should be up to 60. GLAD I BOUGHT GLAD I BOUGHT GLAD I BOUGHT !!!!!!
What is wrong with this stock?
"When should I sell this? 20x revenue is ridiculous. My original hope was that this company would eventually be bought out by a Salesforce-type company, just like Tableau. Big applications to any business - but its a long journey for them still and they have a high burn rate. Anyone getting out or sticking with?"
Strong on a down day
Love this stock. Flies below radar and keeps going up.
Sounds like good days just ahead!
"Share offering announced this morning, 6.5 million shares. This means dilution for existing shareholders. I'm out."
Not good https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1366561/000173752119000028/xslF345X03/wf-form4_156703753685723.xml
this could be the next Splank SPLK and Salesforce (CRM) like the company
This baby going and maybe buyout by someone
75 short term
60 coming. don't be late.
"Advances in Quantum computing, are a perfect fit for all fintech. co.s ."
Selloff is not a SMAR related issue - it's a market-wide liquidity issue. Don't get overly excited/depressed based on short-term movements.
Seems that the SP would increase with the possibility of a government contract. Go figure.
"I love how Carvana can report both earnings and rev that misses by 80% and turn around at hit all times highs, but this stock has gone sideways AF"
"Massive institutionalBuying over the past 5 trading days, massive . Look up SMAR on Fintel.comStock Broke above the moving average on heavy volume. Shorts run for the hills b4 too late . Big money coming out of profitable semis trade now headed back into software ! My next big play probably DOMO. Undervalued here"
Book value $4.50..........with a negative cash flow...........I think I'll pass the dip for now........Dip lower for sure.
only fools selling today. they will regret it soon.
Volume picking up I see this going up next week 10-15%

Does it bother anyone that their expenses are rising faster than their revenue?
Chief Revenue Office sold thousands of shares in August. Prior to earnings. See Form 4 from Sec.Gov:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1366561/000173752119000028/xslF345X03/wf-form4_156703753685723.xmlStay away from this Ponzi scheme company
Good ER
AH is amazing
It’s usual to see spike in operating expenses when a company is expanding. One should concentrate on the phenomenal growth they have exhibited. This stock should move up further from here.
SMAR reached a 52 Week low at 33.58
Just bought shares.. It should reward i believe very strong stock
"Smartsheet Is Maintained at Outperform by Oppenheimer,Smartsheet Is Maintained at Buy by Canaccord Genuity,Smartsheet Is Maintained at Overweight by Morgan Stanley,Smartsheet Is Maintained at Buy by Needham,overreaction, all analysts believe that SMART is a buy at this price"
down nearly 10% with no news? sweet!
"Jefferies analyst , Brent Thill has a hold rating on Smartsheet's stock and his price target to $50 ."
(http://Rightpicker.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
so much for Smart !
PLAN forget the rest
Smartsheet reached an all time high at 62.80
"I think that Slack Technologies is the problem that is dragging the software companies, all the pairs of SMAR are falling, only Anaplan is the one that survived the fall. Good luck we will need it."
65$ tomorrow
I am hoping to drop more
Has this  finally awoken??
"GAAP was bad and a miss, that's why the drop"
Smartsheet is up 7.39% to 67.18
earnings are pretty good hopefully there is buying tomorrow.
why are we dropping
Told ya yesterday 35 sounds like a buy
tommorow open at $52
i entered the order to sell my few shares before market opened (i needed some cash)............ and i missed this..GL to all the longs..
50 in no time
What's going on today?
looks like upward momentum is still intact. Maybe the $57 will arrive soon.
another earning release showing the company still losing money!!!
"#SMAR Technical indicators are looking bullish. Fundamental growth is strong, according to stockFA. Long over 28.25 for a run up to 33."
$20 and below
"Breakout, $57 in few days from here"
Earnings date?????
Jumping off the ship https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smartsheet-inc-smar-president-ceo-011505959.html
Least talked about stock in a white hot category. Steady growth with incredible customer satisfaction
SMAR is up 10.00% to 23.20
"Just got through the Call transcript. It is interesting that all the analysts on the calls either maintained or raised their targets and most are still buy, outperform, overweight, etc.(after the call) Although the best part was when Jennifer the CFO dropped the ""s...t"" bomb. LOL I loved it. I think a lot of the trading today might have been based on just missing the projections probably many didn't listen to the call details just the headlines. Majority of companies have been missing projections during this quarter. Will be interesting to see but definitely don't seem to warrant a -22% drop. For short term people who were hoping to get rich in 2 months maybe the news was enough to lock in gains. I am in with a small commitment after the drop, based on their % increase in the Over 50K and 100K customers. No debt and enough cash is not a bad way to be right now. GL"
What happened today?
Something is habbening.
SMAR is down 8.64% to $27.70
Smartsheet reached an all time high at 76.27
Smartsheet is down 8.38% to 46.05
After beat its down
"It will close above $50. Solid fundamentals, but victimised by Corona just like everyone else. Buy and Hold, you will be rewarded!"
This is nothing more than a short squeeze. I'm betting it may fall just as fast tomorrow or next week. This ER report did not warrant this move today.
It would help if company officers and directors would stop dumping shares.
This one is going to fly when earnings come out!
wonder y the nose dive...report was great!
SMAR reached a 52 Week low at 34.01
Yuuugeee numbers market doesn’t care about price to sales ratio lol
What an overreaction..... SMAR will open 50+ tomorrow and close between $52-$54
"Any thoughts why SMAR has been in steady decline for the last week? The selling volume is not heavy but it is steady, with little or no buying."
Smartsheet reached an all time high at 79.96
Ugh...what’s going on here?!?
shorts are desperate to keep it down.
"opportunity to buy , this stock lose all the points won on April and May , need go up again , next week fly to $60"
Will hit 90
SMAR is good but shouldn't be better than PLAN. I totally expected this reaction.
Smartsheet reached an all time high at 61.41
"Great product that my company uses. They are forcing us to upgrade plans as ours is being ""sunset"", and the new plan is over 250% more than what we are currently paying. I'm sure they are doing this with all of their clients. We are going to pay it as we have no choice because there is no alternative out there and it's have to have software for us."
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
lmao nearing 9% gains already
Anyone selling here?
Still burning through cash. For the full year they are expecting to be negative cash flow of $40mm not good
Hope is not a good strategy....
Should be a huge pop to 60s
"SSR kicks in, it'll go up tomorrow"
Next big runner Digital Turbine (APPS) great earning and guidance. The stock is being accumulated as Market catches up. GNUS was outstanding. Don't miss APPS.
I was right then
I'm going long
Smartsheet reached an all time high at 81.70
Will close around $72. Sorry longs.. very unfortunate to be long
In couple of weeks it will be over $60!
Beat eps and revenue handsomely

Lockup period looms be careful. There will be a time to buy soon.

Not happy with all the insider selling...Really did you have to sell so much?
Fill the gap and start over.
Not that great of a company and prob will be bough by someone large.
"Long play doesn't seem very wise here, PUT action seems like a dip may be in store."
"I was planning to buy some and set a price before the earning. But, I cancelled it because of what happens to PVTL. It is a cloud company as well. It has crushed 43% this morning!! Yuck!!."

Fairly inactive board…was expecting several cheerleaders and maybe a short or two. This is gearing to takeoff.
"SMAR Sale of 500,000 shares at $15 per share by Director Frei Brent on 05/01"
Bought more today
Don't get excited. This is purely technical rally. When momentum gets shifted we will close below 70
"Burning cash, the more they sell.. the more they lose. This is not a $6 BILLION company. Sell!"
Look at that 5 day chart!
"DOCU and SMAR, which is better?"
they should buy out asur stock
I just want to know why it went down!! Why the sell offs?!
Hi all... new to this stock... kind of a quiet board for an earnings day... any reason why?
Bought on the -20% after hours dip after the last earnings call. We are back to exact price the day before last earnings call. So we meet again!
$40.00 here we come !!
"The chart looks very interesting today. Someone has been trying to push it down so badly but it keeps on come back. By looking at the daily chart, it is on an uptrend for sure."
"Big institutions and major holders have sensed blood in waters, they have patience and we want quick money. Eventually, we are gonna sell if it doesn't tick up. When we are frustrated we sell and move on but the big boys are gonna grab all our lunch and they will eat it. Well, hope I am not one of those frustrated guy who is seeing red in my account."

"The reviews on Smart sheet are no better than it's competitors, and in some cases worse. This evaluation seems 2x too high. IMHO"
Am I too late to the party?!
Got in today... had been waiting to buy.
I see a businesses using this tool all the time!
I don’t understand this drop in SMAR. What are we missing? I miss the CC.
I’ll sell some puts tomorrow. Looks overreacted to me
what's going on today?
Back to 40
Currently trading 28X sales; love this company but come onnnnnnn
"Gentlemen and ladies, start your engines we are going north of $30 after earnings Time to accumulate"

"Additionally no real mention of what the new acquisition will add to the bottom line. Since when do you buy a company and not provide guidance on how it will affect revenue, cash flow or profits?"
"Very strong upward trend on good volume, the sniff is on!"
"$SMAR IPO unlock of 89m shares occurred a few days ago. This is the vast majority out of 102m total shares. First to file form 4 is the Head of HR who sold 97.3% of her holdings on Oct 30. More filings to come I'd guess. As unlocks go, this one looks like a whopper. There are 10:1 supervoting shares held by the original backers which convert to regular vote when registered for sale so they can sell down nearly 95% and still control 51% the company. I expect heavy amounts of shares to come to market near term. The software does cool things for sure, but is not absolutely required for most work teams. And at enterprise pricing of 25/month per head they have a broken business model because the commissions and customization costs for each project easily run 10-20k. If you assume a team of 20 people for 2 years paying that $25, it's only 12k of revenue so they'll never make money. And what if the team is only 10 people and/or the project lasts only 9 months... the negative op leverage gets huge. Since they face huge competition from much larger players such as $TEAM and $NOW, they can't raise rev/head so they're stuck with a model that can't make $."
Smartsheet is up 7.53% to 53.00
"William Blair - OUTPERFORM: Strong Start to the Year; Subscription Revenue Growth Accelerates to 57%Good beat-and-raise quarter: Smartsheet reported strong first-quarter results that werehighlighted by 55% revenue growth and 52% billings growth. The company reported NDRRof 134% for the second quarter in a row, showcasing its ability to continue expanding at arapid clip within its customer base. Smartsheet also raised its full-year revenue and billingsguidance and now expects 48% revenue growth and 47% billings growth for the year. Recallthat the company’s fiscal second quarter is a big billings quarter for the company as severalof its larger customers have renewal dates in the period. We also highlight that subscriptionrevenue accelerated to 57% growth in the quarter, up from 56% last period.Strong expansion trends continue in quarter: Smartsheet delivered another quarterof 134% NDRR, flat from last quarter and up 400 basis points from the year-ago period.Smartsheet continues to expand within its existing customers, both by increasing seats andup-selling premium capabilities-based offerings to customers. Capabilities-based offeringswere 9% of total subscription revenue in the quarter, up from 8% in the previous period.In the quarter, 34 companies increased their ARR by at least $50,000, including 13 of thesecompanies that increased ARR by more than $100,000. Smartsheet’s average ACV across itsdomain customer base is still about $2,700, and we believe there is plenty of room to growwithin the existing customer base.Seat growth driving much of the expansion: Although Smartsheet’s premium offeringsare growing and increasing in number in the product portfolio, the primary driver of growthcontinues to be seat expansion. While we believe Smartsheet’s premium offerings are animportant part of the growth story, the seat expansion trends speak to the large size ofthe market opportunity ahead for Smartsheet as more customers replace legacy workmanagement tools like spreadsheets and email. Over time, as Smartsheet grows withinenterprises and gets implemented wall-to-wall, we would expect many of these customers toalso adopt the company’s premium capabilities-based offerings, adding to the growth rate."
"I would not be surprised if Microsoft buys this out. As someone who has used the tool for years, Smartsheet is increasingly replacing excel and Microsoft Project for many use cases."
Great revenue jump. But the operating margin rate didn't move up a single poing. Not a positive thing really.
% Held by Institutions = 178.48 ??? Bad data but this must mean it's way up there right??
Made some when IPO -￼ presently in for 2nd time & confidence is high! Know people who know people BUY
Drop back to 20 ish so we can load up
SMAR is down -10.60% to 28.34
Not sure what else the market wanted. Beat highest revenue estimate by over 10% and on EPS. Expectations must have been sky high for this stock.
Things are not looking good....https://seekingalpha.com/article/4289832-smartsheet-growth-enough-anymore?ifp=0

What happened?
Zack rank is #2 (buy)
Nice today.
Cheap stock tomorrow

What can we expect from earning? Please
"Dont forget that when stocks cut guidance, they typically overshoot to the downside. If the market takes a breather here its not hard to get this stock to 35-40, thats still a 10+X forward multiple which is fair for a company with revenue growth in the 30’s and highly negative operating losses. So dont think this is a huge overreaction, it was priced for perfection and thats not reality. Now it needs repriced."
Cotton is Buying SMAR Thursday on the open...the stock has corrected 28% since its run up to 32 after the IPO. The float is very small...and we think it will move up to 28 within a few weeks...and make a new high by September .We use technical and fundamental analysis..
Anyone know what earnings will look like?
Setting a trailing buy order $1 off from current price… follow the downward trend and capture shares at the start of the inevitable uptrend to come. It’s just a matter of time for the overreaction to correct itself.
I’m waiting for 35
"Well that was a doozy of a reversal. All the momentum software names are being taken down. Lots of names, especially the ones that went public in the past 4 to 5 years. And the Big Daddy of them all, CRM, is definitely going down. Call it Peak Cloud LOL"
"Definitely looks like the frenzy of selling has run it's course, for now. Got in near $41 and hoping for good things."
