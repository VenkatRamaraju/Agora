I was right then
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
"I would not be surprised if Microsoft buys this out. As someone who has used the tool for years, Smartsheet is increasingly replacing excel and Microsoft Project for many use cases."
Setting a trailing buy order $1 off from current price… follow the downward trend and capture shares at the start of the inevitable uptrend to come. It’s just a matter of time for the overreaction to correct itself.
Will hit 90

how is this even red.. with earnings beat and upgrades.. BS on this one
Selloff is not a SMAR related issue - it's a market-wide liquidity issue. Don't get overly excited/depressed based on short-term movements.
"Can't believe the overselling here, the company grew it's revenue and on the way to grow more!"
"William Blair - OUTPERFORM: Strong Start to the Year; Subscription Revenue Growth Accelerates to 57%Good beat-and-raise quarter: Smartsheet reported strong first-quarter results that werehighlighted by 55% revenue growth and 52% billings growth. The company reported NDRRof 134% for the second quarter in a row, showcasing its ability to continue expanding at arapid clip within its customer base. Smartsheet also raised its full-year revenue and billingsguidance and now expects 48% revenue growth and 47% billings growth for the year. Recallthat the company’s fiscal second quarter is a big billings quarter for the company as severalof its larger customers have renewal dates in the period. We also highlight that subscriptionrevenue accelerated to 57% growth in the quarter, up from 56% last period.Strong expansion trends continue in quarter: Smartsheet delivered another quarterof 134% NDRR, flat from last quarter and up 400 basis points from the year-ago period.Smartsheet continues to expand within its existing customers, both by increasing seats andup-selling premium capabilities-based offerings to customers. Capabilities-based offeringswere 9% of total subscription revenue in the quarter, up from 8% in the previous period.In the quarter, 34 companies increased their ARR by at least $50,000, including 13 of thesecompanies that increased ARR by more than $100,000. Smartsheet’s average ACV across itsdomain customer base is still about $2,700, and we believe there is plenty of room to growwithin the existing customer base.Seat growth driving much of the expansion: Although Smartsheet’s premium offeringsare growing and increasing in number in the product portfolio, the primary driver of growthcontinues to be seat expansion. While we believe Smartsheet’s premium offerings are animportant part of the growth story, the seat expansion trends speak to the large size ofthe market opportunity ahead for Smartsheet as more customers replace legacy workmanagement tools like spreadsheets and email. Over time, as Smartsheet grows withinenterprises and gets implemented wall-to-wall, we would expect many of these customers toalso adopt the company’s premium capabilities-based offerings, adding to the growth rate."
"Just got through the Call transcript. It is interesting that all the analysts on the calls either maintained or raised their targets and most are still buy, outperform, overweight, etc.(after the call) Although the best part was when Jennifer the CFO dropped the ""s...t"" bomb. LOL I loved it. I think a lot of the trading today might have been based on just missing the projections probably many didn't listen to the call details just the headlines. Majority of companies have been missing projections during this quarter. Will be interesting to see but definitely don't seem to warrant a -22% drop. For short term people who were hoping to get rich in 2 months maybe the news was enough to lock in gains. I am in with a small commitment after the drop, based on their % increase in the Over 50K and 100K customers. No debt and enough cash is not a bad way to be right now. GL"

"It appears they work half a day--go to lunch and never return, like a downward staircase! :("
This seems like a solid high growth buy for really good future potential returns.. I understand it is expensive.. but overvalued..? Will start DCAing in.
Significant sales hiring has been done tha last two quarters. Sales and Marketing spend went up from 62 million in Q1 to 77 million in Q3. A significant bump. This is a significant investment. in addition FEDRAMP auth as well as GSA approval significantly increases revenue opportunity in the next quarter. Combine that with the overall trends of 1. Shift to cloud 2. Adoption of work management 3. Remote workforce enablement and productivity etc we will see a significant uptick in the next few quarter. It could be the immediate quarter or possibly two quarters from now. But significant growth will be there.Brandfolder literally has no competition. Should see significant revenue uptick.
"The reviews on Smart sheet are no better than it's competitors, and in some cases worse. This evaluation seems 2x too high. IMHO"
Well it looks like past repeat itself.Same was 2018 when every company reported better then expected ER and stock was still falling.Make me think...perhaps market will correct itself soon.Let see how other companies will do after good ER
"Weeeee...It's 1999 all over again. Anyone remember that year? That's when many tech companies with no profits, like SMAR, MDB and others, basically went parabolic based on ""hope"". Since hope is not a strategy, and we're in a global slowdown and a bear market rally, it won't be long before all the market gains reverse. Don't take my word for it though, just look at Federal Express's report out this evening."
I don't understand anything the market is going up strongly and SMAR continues to drop a company that was going up $ 1.18 ten minutes before opening the market.pure $%#&
