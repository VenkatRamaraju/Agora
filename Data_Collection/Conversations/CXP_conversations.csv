"Had this REIT for 12 yrs as a friend (who became financial planner) needed clients so i ""threw him a bone"". The 6+% Div was attractive but through the yrs., i smelled the EXECUTIVES were making money off its investors (selling them out) as the NAV diluted and 12yr yield, NAV + DIV yielded less than 1% by my calculations) (while EXECs profited)"

"the typing got screwed up there...i asked ""increase in value"" towards the bottom"
Great for the share price but what about the dividend?
Is that hostile takeover bid legit? Do those guys really have the money to bid at 19.5?

"Anyone else think the repositioning of the portfolio (sold $3.3B in non-core assets/markets and invested $2.6B in high barrier markets since 2011 per investor presentation from March 16, 2017) is to position company for sale/merger?"

"I invested to throw a bone to a friend entering the investment business. I enjoyed the attractive 6% return. Then i got the feeling the ""CREATORS"" of this REIT were making millions as the NAV sank continually....though the div. continued, i felt like this was a madoff situation. yes, it was up to me to sell and i take the blame for my ""trust"" in legitimate people running this. now, the question is, does this REIT have any real chance of survival and/or any real chance to value.....and lastly, the future of shopping malls seems bleak so how will that effect the portfolio?increase in"
