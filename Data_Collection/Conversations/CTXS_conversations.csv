"They don't produce sh1t but have managed to con enough businesses and the govt that their product is needed for secure comm. I hate the Citrix scam,"
"I might be off, but if the revenue and EPS are above expectations, why is this down by 8%?.. What'd I miss?"
"Dude, what happened today. It was up almost 2 points and then CRASHED, down 4 pts from 2 hrs ago with no explanation. Strange reaction to new product release."

Now you have Google Sketchup and Adobe pulling support for Citrix... Citrix needs to convince Microsoft to allow Windows 10. Would solve these application support issues.
"At what point during the last year has this stock not recovered, and moved higher. It always eventually moves up slow and steady."
"Share price just crossed over the sma and ema. If price climbs again tommorow, in buying."
"Microsoft just renewed interest in allowing all the Microsoft apps to run better though Citrix’s platform. They are helping bridge the gap between ‘work at home’ at an enterprise level, and the availability of tablet and phone devices in the household. I would love to access my work stuff on an iPhone! Would make me so much more productive, and would give me that comfort I already have. This is gonna be a goldmine. If they market their endpoint solution, geared at security as well."

Initiated a position today. GL!
"Stocks are down, people who don’t have the option to wfh can’t work. Unemployment rate increases. Citrix works to keep things continuous, enabling companies to allow for wfh. This is a winner right here. It’s a corona resilient company. Maybe not thriving, but doing well."

CTXS reached a new All Time High at 93.80
"As disappointing as it is on earning day. This isn’t Citrix fault, look at the whole damn market. We’re all losing if your a long term or short term investor"

"So if $TEUM is not legit, this news is fake, made up? Again it is $CTXS, a legit Corp.Pareteum and Citrix Agree Mobile Workforce Global Cloud Strategy DeploymentNEW YORK, NY – Mar. 20, 2019 – Pareteum Corporation (Nasdaq: TEUM), a rapidly growing global cloud software communications platform company with a mission to connect every person and every(thing)TM, today announced a new sales transaction with Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:$CTXS). The agreement will see Citrix migrate employees to a cloud-based deployment of Pareteum’s iPass SmartConnectTM solution, which has been fully integrated with Citrix’s existing single sign-on solution to provide users with an enhanced security experience. A phased rollout is currently underway.Using the Pareteum solution on corporate-issued and BYOD devices, Citrix’s mobile employees will be able to seamlessly and securely connect to millions of Wi-Fi hotspots globally, automatically transitioning back to cellular when Wi-Fi is not available. By integrating the Pareteum offering with its existing single sign-on solution (Okta), Citrix will be able to manage access controls such that employees will only need to securely sign in once to get connected to Wi-Fi across the globe.Shawn Genoway, Sr. Director, IT, Citrix, commented, “Our move to a cloud-based deployment of Pareteum’s iPass SmartConnect aligns perfectly with our overall cloud strategy. With a growing mobile workforce, we needed a way to keep our remote workers cost-effectively connected, while ensuring our data is secure at all times. We now have a solution that allows mobile workers to stay securely connected and productive, wherever they are trying to get online.”"

what happened to this ???
Nice bump leading up to earnings. This one hasn't gotten as much of a WFH boost yet but I think that's going to change very soon
Why Citrix stock hasn't rebounded yet? A large number of companies will keep employees working from home for several months. I'm keeping my shares unless I am missing something.
"Who would not be interested in Citrix right now? They've got a great product. Half the people working from home will be staying at home, and they will ultimately be using Citrix as their hub."
"I started following ""lionstock-aletrs” (Gooogle it - off course without any space or dash in between the words) and their notifications are better than anyone else."
"I’ve been circumcised as an adult, yet this is more painful."
"Great, what's going on?"
looks like a good buy here.
Citrix software Xenapp and Xendesk is the best work from home product out there by far.

Is it just me or does the bid on Wrike seem too much for the revenue value it is expected to reach? It seems they are paying the equivalent of 8 to 10 years of revenue up front.
Hoping 3% up today
"and just like that, in about thirty days, all the buy-out rumors vanished (yet again)."
Anyone here?????
"Citrix Systems downgraded at Morgan Stanley on lack of 'meaningful' cloud progress :(Despite yesterday's ""solid"" Q3 earnings report, Morgan Stanley downgrades Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) from Overweight to Equal Weight and cuts the price target from $165 to $140.Analyst Sanjit Singh notes that the company's SaaS business has now decelerated for four straight quarters as ""migrating existing maintenance customers to cloud has progressed more slowly than expected.""Singh says the ""lack of more meaningful cloud progress likely further elevates the debate on the durability of long term growth."""

CNBC will discussing CITRIX .
Citrix follows all the dinosaurs and zombie stocks. Too many Indians and no Chief.
"Earnings are not good and the debt is astounding... I will say though, a company of this size and with this amount of debt could make a great acquisition for a larger company. Investors seem pretty hopeless on this one I'm not too sure this will rebound but who knows nowadays."
I'm counting on a rebound in CTXS. Citrix is a great tool especially now when a lot of people are working remotely.

WOW WHAT A GIFT GOT 150 0@ 151 VOOM VOOM VOOM
Citrix powers a trend that will grow far beyond today's crisis. At home or remote workplaces are a win-win situation. Look for more upgrades- $160 will be easy.
$200 soon
Maybe green today is over sold I think people is going to buy back
Just initiated a position in CTXS. Also bought some NTNX.Two great stocks with lots of potential!
Shorts are squealing and the limp sell-side analysts have lost you a lot of money
goin back to the level where it belongs
Earnings Thursday. I believe another beat is in store for CTXS. Here we have an undervalued cloud stock.
I’m buying back 500k good luck everyone
what a ride!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Looking at FFIV down $20 since Earnings that they raised.
Just made $0.90 in real GAAP earnings - valuation still seems extreme.
"This and $VMW are the only two cloud stocks worth it to buy and reasonably priced IMO (aside from Google and MSFT), everything else is just massive hype and way over-extended."
It’s lame always going down
Man this company is a DUD! Just lost some money today on an auto-stop loss. Won't ever invest in this company ever again or recommend them to anyone! VMware is way better!
CTXS is down 4.94% to 110.22
Maybe a possible rebound is imenent?
this should show decent growth
Still quite extended - only $0.90 in earnings - need to raise the dividend. Fair value around $120 ?
Citrix Systems reached an all time high at 159.26
"I can't see any pickup, SAS hurts Citrix. Companies moving towards the cloud also kills Citrix, they have very few products that are immune to convergence."
"This is $90 stock at best, too much competition IMHO"
