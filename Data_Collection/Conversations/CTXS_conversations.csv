"CTXS landing on Google cloud, huge opportunity to buy. Looking at tremendous growth potential. Upgrades are on it way $125 in six months"
"Been holding 500 $CTXS shares @ $15.66 since 2005. Selling 100 shares today to put into some beat up stocks with better growth potential. If a WFH global pandemic didn't get this baby going, not sure what will."
This stock is going to file bankruptcy?
"I might be off, but if the revenue and EPS are above expectations, why is this down by 8%?.. What'd I miss?"
We’ve hit the bottom 
Big Announcement coming by end of the week… this is real. Your last chance before it hits 123 next week
good time to buy
I won’t be surprise 3-4 months from now Google ends up buying Citrix. Guys it is once in lifetime opportunity
"So if $TEUM is not legit, this news is fake, made up? Again it is $CTXS, a legit Corp.Pareteum and Citrix Agree Mobile Workforce Global Cloud Strategy DeploymentNEW YORK, NY – Mar. 20, 2019 – Pareteum Corporation (Nasdaq: TEUM), a rapidly growing global cloud software communications platform company with a mission to connect every person and every(thing)TM, today announced a new sales transaction with Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:$CTXS). The agreement will see Citrix migrate employees to a cloud-based deployment of Pareteum’s iPass SmartConnectTM solution, which has been fully integrated with Citrix’s existing single sign-on solution to provide users with an enhanced security experience. A phased rollout is currently underway.Using the Pareteum solution on corporate-issued and BYOD devices, Citrix’s mobile employees will be able to seamlessly and securely connect to millions of Wi-Fi hotspots globally, automatically transitioning back to cellular when Wi-Fi is not available. By integrating the Pareteum offering with its existing single sign-on solution (Okta), Citrix will be able to manage access controls such that employees will only need to securely sign in once to get connected to Wi-Fi across the globe.Shawn Genoway, Sr. Director, IT, Citrix, commented, “Our move to a cloud-based deployment of Pareteum’s iPass SmartConnect aligns perfectly with our overall cloud strategy. With a growing mobile workforce, we needed a way to keep our remote workers cost-effectively connected, while ensuring our data is secure at all times. We now have a solution that allows mobile workers to stay securely connected and productive, wherever they are trying to get online.”"

"Sure, not taking the bait! Some companies wanted to sell, announce it, and when the stock is pumped enough, they withdraw that decision."

"Leadership shakeup, preannouncement of Q3 earnings and the CEO is out... https://investors.citrix.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2021/10-06-2021-210522640"
Anyone here?????
Elliott Mgmt back in the stock announcing a >10% stake and demanding mgmt amd strategic changes to boost the stock price.
This jumped 5% after earnings today
Last few days have been rough. Nice to see some green for one day
I have noticed that no one is talking about Citrix for days. What are the latest thoughts? I have been waiting for a rebound.
Earnings Thursday. I believe another beat is in store for CTXS. Here we have an undervalued cloud stock.
Why Citrix stock hasn't rebounded yet? A large number of companies will keep employees working from home for several months. I'm keeping my shares unless I am missing something.
