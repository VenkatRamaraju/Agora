I purchased today at 126.74. I believe that this emotional overreaction by the market will be short-lived and it will be up 5-10% by the end of the month.
Citrix Systems is down 4.90% to 109.17
"Considering trillions lost in market, what Citrix software provides is saving trillions in tech industry. This stock is super cheap and should be trading at $250."
"Who would not be interested in Citrix right now? They've got a great product. Half the people working from home will be staying at home, and they will ultimately be using Citrix as their hub."

"This and $VMW are the only two cloud stocks worth it to buy and reasonably priced IMO (aside from Google and MSFT), everything else is just massive hype and way over-extended."
CTXS is up 5.82% to 102.20
"thought we were going to 20? happens all the time after earnings. back to 100 by end of day, better than 95"
Why! there is no reason!
Earned $0.78 for the quarter without all the funny adjustments. PE is just way too high.
Nice bump leading up to earnings. This one hasn't gotten as much of a WFH boost yet but I think that's going to change very soon
CTXS reached an all time high at 119.35

"This company has been rumored to be bought-out for SEVERAL years, and several different times.....and this time it's not any different. (it will all blow-over in a few days/weeks)....and be trading back at 97 to 98 again."
This jumped 5% after earnings today
Shame on you by forcing your employees to work overtime during this pandemic outbreak!!People need to stop buying their products.
Citrix powers a trend that will grow far beyond today's crisis. At home or remote workplaces are a win-win situation. Look for more upgrades- $160 will be easy.
CTXS is down 4.91% to 95.77
"I just got in on 3 shares today at 138.5 and it dropped a little after that. Overall, this looks like it has good long term potential given the growing SD-WAN markets."

"So if $TEUM is not legit, this news is fake, made up? Again it is $CTXS, a legit Corp.Pareteum and Citrix Agree Mobile Workforce Global Cloud Strategy DeploymentNEW YORK, NY – Mar. 20, 2019 – Pareteum Corporation (Nasdaq: TEUM), a rapidly growing global cloud software communications platform company with a mission to connect every person and every(thing)TM, today announced a new sales transaction with Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:$CTXS). The agreement will see Citrix migrate employees to a cloud-based deployment of Pareteum’s iPass SmartConnectTM solution, which has been fully integrated with Citrix’s existing single sign-on solution to provide users with an enhanced security experience. A phased rollout is currently underway.Using the Pareteum solution on corporate-issued and BYOD devices, Citrix’s mobile employees will be able to seamlessly and securely connect to millions of Wi-Fi hotspots globally, automatically transitioning back to cellular when Wi-Fi is not available. By integrating the Pareteum offering with its existing single sign-on solution (Okta), Citrix will be able to manage access controls such that employees will only need to securely sign in once to get connected to Wi-Fi across the globe.Shawn Genoway, Sr. Director, IT, Citrix, commented, “Our move to a cloud-based deployment of Pareteum’s iPass SmartConnect aligns perfectly with our overall cloud strategy. With a growing mobile workforce, we needed a way to keep our remote workers cost-effectively connected, while ensuring our data is secure at all times. We now have a solution that allows mobile workers to stay securely connected and productive, wherever they are trying to get online.”"
I think an argument can be made for a stake at these levels.

"Stocks are down, people who don’t have the option to wfh can’t work. Unemployment rate increases. Citrix works to keep things continuous, enabling companies to allow for wfh. This is a winner right here. It’s a corona resilient company. Maybe not thriving, but doing well."

Just got a dope alert from (https:// www.tradenow.xyz)
I have noticed that no one is talking about Citrix for days. What are the latest thoughts? I have been waiting for a rebound.
"Earnings are not good and the debt is astounding... I will say though, a company of this size and with this amount of debt could make a great acquisition for a larger company. Investors seem pretty hopeless on this one I'm not too sure this will rebound but who knows nowadays."
CNBC will discussing CITRIX .
Would CTXS systems be in demand should coronavirus get worse in the U.S. Employees told to stay home and work scenario?
"Not seeing any news. Not a big short ratio, but are we seeing a mini-squeeze?"
Pump and dump
Why Citrix stock hasn't rebounded yet? A large number of companies will keep employees working from home for several months. I'm keeping my shares unless I am missing something.
Initiated a position today. GL!

Earnings Thursday. I believe another beat is in store for CTXS. Here we have an undervalued cloud stock.
I should of known to get out of this when I was close to breaking even after 1 + year of holding this!I was getting notices from Lawyers regarding misleading investors. Caveat Emptor on this sketchy company! I took my losses and lost a lot. GLTA that decide to hold this worthless company.

This has been a nice little rally but 143-144 today feels like a peak. Who would be buying this here now??
Is it just me or does the bid on Wrike seem too much for the revenue value it is expected to reach? It seems they are paying the equivalent of 8 to 10 years of revenue up front.

"Microsoft just renewed interest in allowing all the Microsoft apps to run better though Citrix’s platform. They are helping bridge the gap between ‘work at home’ at an enterprise level, and the availability of tablet and phone devices in the household. I would love to access my work stuff on an iPhone! Would make me so much more productive, and would give me that comfort I already have. This is gonna be a goldmine. If they market their endpoint solution, geared at security as well."
