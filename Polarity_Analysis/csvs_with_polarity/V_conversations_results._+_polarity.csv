547,"There is no fundamental reasons why this is going down post-earnings. It handily beat increased earnings expectations, as well as on revenues. Its forward EPS is also similar to MA with their outlook actually getting brighter as more folks purchase online. Today's jobs and wags report is positive. And V just announced a 7B share buyback. Look at all the other financials, they are doing very well recently (e.g. BAC, C, GS even WFC) despite or in spite of all the tax code changes or gov shutdown.The only reasons I can think of are due to the bots trading against the humans. They will force the price down until most people lose money and then it will reverse back up after all the relevant options expire this week.Remember too that markets are irrational and these financials are mostly held by big institutions with the money to run trading bots to sweep all the retail money.Let me theorize here on whats going on and what is likely to happen on market open, so you folks see if this will pan out as follows:- Visa price will be sold down by the bots and algos until a point where the largest volumes of options becomes worthless. Given the bullish expectations we had more call options being overbought than puts, this implies that prices will fall to where most of the OI in calls are and stay there until they expire. In other words, the bots will frustrate most people most of the time.- That means I expect the price to fall rapidly on open to somewhere in the vicinity of 119 and even slightly below.- Then it will bounce a bit and stay near there until Friday close- On Monday or Tues open, after all the calls expire, it will shoot back up and progress above 125I have put this to the test, with a small purchase of near-term puts to ride it down short-term.Likewise, I am holding a 2:1 ratio of longer term calls to capture the high probability of upswing over the following week(s).I'm also intentionally posting this to let the bots (and other traders too) read this, and see how they might react or maneuver.My theory may be right in which case I make money, or I might lose a bit if my expectations are totally upended, but it will still be a worthwhile experimental lesson.Good Luck to all.",0.9119

Looking at what goes on in the past, even if this stock is bound for 200, those who entered recently will take a big loss. Otherwise, smart money would wait for support after a healthy pull back to enter. I personally have a slightly bearish option spread that I'm selling premium off of until it does ultimately retrace, which then I'd go long.

By 2020, many people could be leaving their wallets behind and paying for almost everything using their mobile phones.This infographic discusses the growth of mobile payments since 1997 when vending machines that took payments by text were first introduced. Since 2010, the amount of money that's passed from consumers to merchants via smartphones has gone up nine-fold. By 2017, more than $721 billion will change hands via mobile1.More importantly, though, more people and more merchants will feel more comfortable to use mobile, whether it's those NFC chips in your phones that let you hold your phone up to a scanner at a store or via transaction apps, by 2020 Visa believes mobile payments could become the preferred method of both consumers and merchants.",0.9779

This means that in the middle of 2021 the Company will have the revenue that it had in 2019 and this is a positive prognosis. The alternative is a prolonged lock down that sacks the revenue another 30 % for several years and reverts Visas sales back to the numbers of 2015 and prior. V and MA are transaction loggers and insurance Companies. Misbehavior and fraud make up a large portion of the % that they charge and false orders, criminality has gone up since the lock down. ( credit risk is NOT the only risk in business ) Visa doesn't have a banking license like PYPL and SQ and venturing into BTC will do little for it's 400 B valuation. The transaction numbers are too small to move Visa and the BTC App market is over saturated with providers. V and MA need the GDP to recover. The GDP outside of the USA means little to nothing for Visa. The Company will make money even if sales slip 40 % and they won't default but the valuation won't be 400 B in the case of slashed sales. Card issuers need people to physically swipe cards and go OUTSIDE. The Internet alone can't uphold the market cap. Square got saved by its App. Visa doesn't have an App Wallet and it should develop one even if the market is saturated and it's 10 years too late to the Internet. Developing a mobile wallet will cost approx. $40 mil and could add $80 B to the valuation I.e. 2000 times the risk reward.",0.903

Visa Inc. shares hit a new all-time high last week, and the card company will be looking to show that it remains on the cutting edge of digital payments when it reports earnings next Tuesday afternoon.What to expectEarnings: Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Visa V, +0.25% to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.32, up from $1.20 a year earlier. According to Estimize, which crowdsources projections from hedge funds, academics and others, the average estimate calls for $1.36 in EPS.Visa has beaten the FactSet EPS consensus in the past 14 quarters.Revenue: The FactSet consensus calls for $5.7 billion in revenue, while the Estimize consensus projects $5.7 billion. A year prior, Visa reported $5.2 billion in revenue.Stock movement: Visa shares have risen following six of the company’s past 10 earnings reports. The stock has gained 36% so far this year, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.25% has climbed 17%. Of the 39 analysts tracked by FactSet who cover Visa’s stock, 35 rate it a buy, three call it a hold, and one rates it a sell. The average price target is $186.92, 4.2% above current levels.What else to watch forAnalysts see positive indications for the card companies coming out of recent bank earnings. Barclays’ Ramsey El-Assal points to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s JPM, -0.99% and Wells Fargo Corp.’s WFC, +0.46% accelerating purchase-volume growth, which along with “other leading indicators similarly point to a broadly healthy spending environment in the U.S.”El-Assal has an overweight rating and $170 target price on Visa shares.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/visa-earnings-as-facebook-seeks-to-change-payments-visa-stays-the-course-2019-07-17",0.9855
