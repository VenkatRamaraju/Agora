90,"Someone posted yesterday they were disappointed in the transaction with AER as GE was giving up GECAS. That is simply not the case. The amazing thing about the transaction is it pretty much leaves GECAS and GEs ability to generate cash flow from it the same. GE is getting 46% of a company, AER, that earns right now roughly $1 Billion per year. I tried to do some research on GECAS and the last thing I found was from 2018 when they said they earned roughly 1 billion. Assume that 1 billion carries to the new entity which would get AERs profit to 2 billion so GE will still be earning roughly 1 billion from it's 46% stake in AER and will have reduced its debt by $24 billion. This appears to be a rather ingenious transaction for GE.Also, Tusa is a liar. He said this adds 21 billion of debt to industrial GE. As the GE board member said yesterday GE Capital has 10 billion in cash which also comes over so the net debt is already down to 11 billion and then they will also own half of a company with a 15 billion market cap. Tusa must have known this when he reiterated his $5 price targe.",0.9638

113,"I do not think the GE management and its advisors are surprised at all today with the GE stock move down.And I agree with many posts saying about the same already:Reverse split would discourage retail investors looking for a higher quantity of ""affordable"" stock price entree and also of holding of the reversed split stock. It would also discourage day traders participation by loosing more of emotional retail investors and related stock volatility. The Retail fleeing will make room for lower stock price and ""noise free"" entree of additional institutional interest - this remains to be seen over time.I do not think Larry Culp would consider reverse split unless better days are coming up and unless he was advised to do so by institutional investors and analysts.I like the overall GE turnaround based on adaptability and futuristic plans. I also trust Larry and his flexibility. So I am going to hold the GE, likely for few more years. I will sell only if there would be a substantial, material reason(s) to do so, including GE and its stock going no where.Good luck to all!",0.99

150,"What GE really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for GE (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if GE just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

If sustained, GE will be able to afford a dividend rise.Is that what's going on here? Because if it isn't, the argument that shares of GE are becoming overvalued and its nearing time to sell becomes stronger if its shares are really trading within the vertical range they have since 2018.

312,"Best thing that ever happens is double whammyreverse split takes the stock to perhaps $104 a sharethe AerCap deal reduces debt 24 million more and gives Culp 111 million shares to sell.If AerCap doesn't go broke - GE has a big great deal. Culp plans to sell part or all of the 111 million AerCap shares.Couldn't wait for the small 100 share investor to evaporate. That is causing a 5%-10% swingin the daily stock moves - up and down. Just look at today with 135 million shares sold in 90 minutes and a 94 point downward market swing. Pure FEAR.For real investors all the above could not matter less.Fundamental GE business is firmly rooted on the 4 divisions (Aviation, Renewables, Health, Power).All of these divisions have great market position. Each division exceeds $20 billion in sales (Aviation closer to $35 billion). Each could really contribute to FCF going forward if you do not measure in 202 quarters and instead measure in a couple of years. Most of these divisions if they were standing alone would dwarf most other companies on the stock exchange in pure sales volume.... Profits will follow. Obviously measured in days as a person owning GE is a ridiculously poor bet. Long term - awesome!Once again you are seeing analysts shout obvious sightly thought out opinions. They continue to show poor judgement. Some say better place to invest exists (bitcoin, Tesla, AMC, Gamestock for example). Wouldn't trade one GE share for any of these outright gambles. Some say GE is in trouble. Ridiculous! At $70 billion gross 2021 sales and $45 billion in the bank for use any way they seek to use it - GE is in exceptional condition to take a severe upward trek!Some analysts say too G has too much debt but ignore the $70 billion paid back against the earlier total. Culp is delivering and the company has managed lots of serious debt replacement in the past 24 months.Some say the firm (GE) is selling off the parts and there will be nothing left. Any serious fool can see that there will be 4 firmly exceptional divisions going forward. All will be future profitable divisions of GE. Any and all will dominate in their markets - including Power which owns 50% of the world market and has new low pollution generators to replace older models.....And some analysts cannot understand that taking the stock up 8 clicks(8-1 Reverse split) comes closer to $104 a share - joining other important stocks. A stock rolling in the mud at $6 to $13 is not very exciting for serious investors. And has anyone thought about FCF of $10 billion (totally possible in just Aviation and Health not counting Renewable and Power results) )with only 1 billion in outstanding stock makes earnings much more exciting going forward. At 20 times earnings- the stock would be trading at $200. At 25 times earnings the stock would be trading at $250. Doesn't that excite anyone or are we in a sea of fools?So let the stock tank today and recover tomorrow. At 135 million shares traded in 90 minutes - there is genuine panic in the market. Fear today - greed tomorrow.It scares the bejesus out of small investors and short buyers - and rightfully so. That leaves it to the rest of the serious long termed buyers..",0.9938

631,"A REVERSE SPLIT = A REVERSAL OF FORTUNEA reverse split is a sign of a shrinking company. Eight to nine billion shares is way to much for the much smaller GE of the future. It has been my experience that in the vast majority of cases where the company has instituted a reverse split the stock declined before the reverse split and for some time after the reverse split. In many cases, the post reverse split shares declined by as much as 70% to 80%. Also, companies that declared reverse splits often register shelf offering to raise capital at the new higher price thus diluting the effect of the reverse split . GE HAS MASSIVE DEBT AND IS MOST LIKELY THE REASON FOR THE REVERSE SPLIT! Many companies that declare reverse splits declare chapter 11 because of the onerous pressures that required management to declare a reverse split in the first place. It is my experience that at the very best it takes a company many years to recover from a reverse split. A reverse split company is more likely to file chapter 11 than it is to survive and in my view GE is no exception.IN MY OPINION A REVERSE SPLIT IS ""NEVER"" A GOOD THING FOR SHAREHOLDERS!!!",0.9227

Not healthcare and certainly not the hopey changey thing about Windmills and the “green” deal. That’s pure pipe dream. Unless aviation moves higher and more IMPORTANTLY that the outlook for aviation improves this year this stock is dead in the water. I just don’t see aviation making a comeback in 2021. Look at Alcoa they mine aluminum and they see that being down this year. That’s an important driver as airplane structures are mainly aluminum. Don’t believe me yet? Look at Arconic. They specialize in making airline parts and they are getting hammered too after a big run up last year. As I’ve said before almost every company that has reported so far has gotten hammered. GE will be no different. Will GE survive? Yes! But that doesn’t mean that this stock is moving north anytime soon. If you didn’t have the China Virus last year I would bet this would be trading in the 17 - 22 range. But here we are. HOPING to get above $11 again.,0.9959

This stock was split several times over the years (traditional split) without giving any real thought to the bloated share count it was creating. The financial crisis required more dilution and the shares count grew terribly out of control.We know the goal of improving cash flow and the need to raise cash. So buying back shares is not anything that could be considered. Reverse stock split is the only way to bring this back in line.I know many have the reaction (myself included) to paint reverse splits as a negative and desperate move by a company. That is the more traditional use of a reverse split. That is not what this is looking to do. I see this as a strategic move that accomplishes a big big objective without having an impact on the balance sheet.The 8 or 9 to 1 reverse split with take the company from 8.8 billion shares outstanding to .9 to 1.1 billion shares....Without doing the math for you, let me suggest doing this to see the impact... I took a look at Honeywell focusing on these three areas...Shares Outstanding695.5MEPS (TTM, GAAP)6.71P/E Ratio (TTM, GAAP)31.65xSource is TD Ameritrade Summary Page for HoneywellDo the 8 or 9 to 1 reverse split on GE's data to get these numbers....Then extrapolate GE's stock price from there....you will be pleasantly surprised at what you see....Now go look at Honeywells stock price. Now this isn't going to happen overnight...We might see a split adjusted price to $100 or so and then drop before improved EPS are attained....With improved cash flow (happening now) and the turnaround well underway, growth will start to take hold and we will significant improvement in the stock price...Look for growth deals to be made in the renewable energy sector to get the company growing again..... Larry Culp is doing a brilliant job and seems to have his board on board with the vision.....In two years this will be a $200 stock (25-30 by todays share count). If we get those numbers we will then start to see a slow increase in the dividend....Patience....he knows what he is doing.....reducing share count without spending cash.....Hope this makes sense to those concerned with the reverse split",0.9983

772,"Two things important for GE stock and volume1) the earlier people shorting the stock from last June to around the end of January are not playing that game now.They have lost a lot of money as the stock moved mostly upward fro m$6 to - $13 and their cash position has been decimated.A lot of the volume in the past month was people ""churning"" in and out of the market. That is not the case now.But there are still short trades with computer programs making lightening in and out minute by minute decisions.These are different because the bet is huge, the risk is low, and they are fairly safe bets on small changes. These will not really affect the GE stock moves if you look at it long term.2) The GE stock has heated up over the past 3 weeks moving from a low around $10.50 to $13. This move is really not supported by earnings or earnings rumor. It is based on the long term belief in Larry Culp, the effect the vaccine is making on the pandemic, the belief that within 6 months things will return to a better place, and the obvious new energy GE has shown on Renewables,improved carbon emmiting generator products in power, their new super sensitive scanning MRI and monitoring equipment (supposedly a game changer)the new 9X turbo jet engine that has passed government certification and approval All these and more giving GE dominance in the very environmental sensitive energy market.and you can add a 3rd thing3) GE has taken all the fat out of their game.Reduced employment from over 330,00 to 160,000 closed numerous redundant manufacturing plantsreduced the pension obligation to under 20% and around only $20 billion unfunded - possibly lowerreduced the GE Capital portfolio from a bloated $5 billion a while ago to around $10 billionimproved the GE Capital portfolio financing only top quality things they mostly make and sellgetting the long term life insurance annuity portfolio under control and reducing exposurereducing the overall corporate debt to a very manageable $20 billion or near thatLeaving the $8 billion in Baker Tool 33% ownership as an unused equitybeing savvy enough to keep the dividend a one centbeing also intelligent not to go out on a buying spree or spending their cash on stock buybackSo a long term investment in GE is a bet on old fashioned common sense.General Electric has made all the right moves to move back to a very high price based on a much better Free Cash Flow.It is mostly a matter of time - not if but whenAs an investor, I have the patience to wait for the results.",0.9917

1168,"Freight Of The World: Global Cargo Airline Picks GE Engines To Power New Boeing 747 Jetsby The GE Aviation BlogThe global freight carrier Atlas Air Worldwide said on Tuesday a quartet of new Boeing 747-8 freighters it ordered from Boeing in January will be powered by GE jet engines. The deal, which includes engines and overhaul services, is valued at $800 million at list price over the life of the 20-year maintenance contract.“The 747-8F powered with GEnx engines gives us the best and most versatile widebody freighter in the market,” said John W. Dietrich, Atlas Air Worldwide president and chief executive officer. “Our partnership with GE Aviation supports our longstanding focus on leading edge technology. We look forward to continuing to provide world-class service to our customers.”Atlas is the world’s largest operator of Boeing 747 freighter aircraft, with 53 of them in its fleet. The Boeing 747-8 is the latest and the most advanced version of the Boeing 747, also known as the Jumbo Jet, which helped redefine air travel over the last half-century.Above: A GEnx-2B engine at GE Aviation's test center in Peebles, Ohio. Image credit: GE Aviation. Top image: An Atlas Air Boeing 747-8. A new deal between GE and Atlas Air includes engines and overhaul services, is valued at $800 million at list price over the life of the 20-year maintenance contract. Image credit: Atlas Air.Each of the new planes carries four GEnx-2B jet engines, a close relative of the efficient engines that power another advanced Boeing jet, the 787 Dreamliner. Atlas said its new planes will have 20% higher payload capacity and 16% lower fuel consumption than the previous version, the 747-400.Airlines and other GE customers have ordered more than 2,500 GEnx engines since they entered service early in the last decade, making it the fastest-selling, high-thrust engine in GE’s history.The engine owes its popularity, in part, to advanced technologies and materials that helped it achieve the highest reliability and utilization, lowest fuel burn and longest range capable of any engine in its thrust class, according to GE. For example, the GEnx is the world’s first commercial engine with both a carbon fiber composite front fan case and fan blades. The material — which GE first used for fan blades on the GE90 engine — helps make the fan module lighter and corrosion-resistant, simplify maintenance, and improve reliability. GE Aviation has also developed a 3D-printed component for the engine that helps to further reduce its weight. The GEnx is also the quietest engine GE produces.“The GEnx-2B engines have proven their reliability and durability since entering service almost a decade ago, and GE Aviation is committed to providing full support for these engines long into the future,” said Jason Tonich, vice president and general manager of global sales and marketing at GE Aviation.",0.9988

Maybe a 1 for 2 but not much more than that. JMHO from experience.LessReply62MarkMark16 hours agoMany longs have bought to average down price. to get a bigger multiplayer as shares rose. so a reverse split does kill the time it takes to recover. your losses from higher purchases. stock will recover much slower at 90 to 100 share price.

1669,"Motley Fool report is spot on. Just read it. I've been saying this for some time. OK, why I say $3-$5 this year. Btw, I am not an expert and I have no short positions. Sorry for long note but hopefully this will help those who are on the fence. I worked at GE back in the 90s as a young lad and learned so much about management from the great Jack. Great company to work for back then. My division got sold off for pennies because we were not #1 or #2 in the industry and holy cow he threw us out like trash but he meant what he said, no BS. Tons of integrity and self empowerment. Some of the smartest people I ever worked with at GE. Enough of background so u know I am not pulling this out of my butt. GE under crushing debt and if rates rise it will be hammer time. Larry is a great turnaround CEO only if he can monetize the existing business. No doubt he will make the company leaner and more efficient but that won't be enough. He has to raise revenue. Ok, can he raise revenue in jet engines, healthcare and power. 3 core business. Jet Engines: business travel, core part of airlines is not coming back ever as virtual tech improves, unless u believe ecommerce will slow down and more malls will pop up.Healthcare: Very possible but only if they innovate. They stop innovating long time ago... e.g., MRI is dying tech. I can't believe we still use that old tech... We put a man on the moon and that's the best we can do? when was the last time u got an MRI and doctor said, wow that was helpful. every time I get it, the doctor doesn't even look at it. u get the point... lots of old tech at GE. Power: This could be a possibility. As demand for electricity increases via EVs and bitcoin mining (j/k) they can supply electricity via nuclear power plant unless Tesla innovates faster via solar renewables. We had nuclear power and the liberals said no. very expensive... nothing like natural gas. Bottom Line. The turn around of this company is not just about ""cleaning up the mess"". It is about competing with their disrupters. This is where Cathie Wood is right (I don't own a single share of her ETF). GE could be obsolete in 10 years. Can Larry turn GE into an innovation company like it once was, remember this was the company of Edison... OMG. I am gonna say NO because all the young bright minds don't want to work for GE. I love GE, that's my generation Apple. But to young kids they would rather work for amazon or tesla etc... GE doesn't have the same pop like it once did so it will lose out on talent acquisition and there lies the death of this company. Btw, this applies to all legacy companies but they just don't have a mountain of debt like GE so they will last another 30 years vs GE only 5 years and then done. I am making broad statements here with some exaggeration to make the point... u can hopefully piece this together. I've lost lots of money listening to the ""suits"" do your own research, don't believe what you see or hear on MSM.",0.9994

By bringing together GE Transportation, a global digital industrial leader and supplier to the rail, mining, marine, stationary power and drilling industries, with Wabtec’s broad range of freight, transit and electronics solutions, we will have the capability and expertise to invent smarter ways to move and improve the world.”The transaction, which will position Wabtec as a Fortune 500 company with operations in more than 50 countries, is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2019, subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions. Once the transaction is completed, the combined company is expected to have significantly expanded margins, a highly attractive profile based on an improved business mix, expanded global reach, and faster innovation in key growth areas.",0.9938

All of the competitors do NOT CLOSELY have comparable size or scale.... Kind of like turning a power boat around compared to turning the Queen Mary. Completely different things! And counting the tires on the car and adding them us is about as foolish as adding capitalization to debt to get a EV figure. Who cares????The facts are:GE is a work in progress. Added to that change in the General Electric fundamental direction we have just passed through the eye of the needle as 12 months on corona lock down should pulverize most businesses.It did not pulverize General Electric. How much strength they show....But here is the real comparison....Use free Cash Flow. Everyone seems to thing dollars in pockets matters and planning, investment, research, and future are drags on the basic company. Do not believe that FCF is the real test - but lets look at FCF....Aviation will return to the 2019 FCFof $6.8 billion and not too long from now.Healthcare will maintain their 2020 FCF of $3 billion.Renewables is the question mark. If you take a potential 5% profit on $15 billion sales you get $750 million.That number could be larger if they reach 8% profit like Vestas has on perhaps a $20 billion sales this year which is possible with GE sales pouring in. That number of 8% x $20 billion would then be FCF $1.6 billion. Renewables are the real wildcard.Power is the next wild card. GE has a lot of customers all over the world not abandoning their existing power grid. GE in 2017 had FCF of 1.95 billion. A loss in 2018 and a modest FCF $386 million in 2019 were not good things. Last year after selling off coal, power division was only able to squeeze out FCF of $274 million. Lets see if Culp with his newer energy efficient products can push GE Power to new heights.So the second huge question mark on where power will land in 2021. Because I have total faith - I place my money on a really solid GE turnaround. GE has larger sales in all segments. GE has deeper pockets. GE has more talent. GE is better situated worldwide to reach key buyers in all segments. GE is in a rebuilding phase coming out of the pandemic.What that all translates to is a 2021 FCF that may reach $1 a share or a $20 a share stock price. That is calculated at 20 times earning. For the more speculative crowd, that number could reasonably reach 25 times earnings or $25 a share.Watch out!!2022 will be a bombshell. It isn't too far off for serious investors. GE could easily return to FCF over $13 billion and $1.50 a share. That would make the $30 price very believeable. And the stock price can possibly much higher. I wonder how 2023 will look? beyond awesome?GE is headed right and all the experts with all their figures cannot tell you more.Using oddball formulas like EV (market cap plus debt) is a real distraction from real actual and potential numbers. Either you believe in GE and the chances made to get them to reach new levels - or you are speculating the best is now and the future is much slower.I prefer the glass half full - not half empty.",0.9989

There are $1.3 billion non recurring charges last year now going to the GE bottom line.3) pensions: every 1/4% (quarter point) upward inflation interest improves GE pension fund by 2.4 billion. GE is now vested at 81% in their pension fund which is above the 80% normal for industry standards. Since we see interest rates moving upward - every point would benefit GE $10 billion or about another 10% in their pension obligation.

He understates.He veers to giving clear and honest statements.The ""experts"" are selling themselves as ""experts"".They shoot with hardly any facts That is because they can not be called out.Neither you or I can reach them so they can hide ad after say they were wrong or surprised or even worse - claim they knew.I think Culp knows a lot more than the ""experts"". I project he will get closer to $3 billion profit in the 4th quarter 2020.If that was just $3 billion FCF for the 4th quarter - it would be no news.But Culp also told us the 2021 year they would be profitable all quarters.Simple math would take the FCF for 2021 to around $10 billion .At 20 times per share or a multiplier of $1.10 per share profit for 2021- the stock would be least at a $20 price.It is fashionable to under-estimate the number and then act surprised when the company exceeds the 9 cents a share on Tuesday.In this case the public already knows what the number will be ($2.5 billion) or maybe even more.So Tuesday either General Electric matches the estimated $783,000 profit predicted by ""experts"", and we find Culp is a basket case and does not know what the numbers he promised are actually supposed to be.Or Culp told us the profit was going to be at least $2.5 billionMy money is on Culp.

2225,"Here s the psychology of buying stocksHave you ever looked into the fresh shallow water in a clear pool or stream and seen a school of fish swimming in mass.The second one fish senses anything wrong - the whole school swims as fast A POSSIBLE AWAY FROM THE DANGER.After 10 minutes pass and the school of fish feel safer, they will return and go on with their own world.So this pattern is exactly how stock trades. All stock sales (buying or selling) are motivated by either greed or fear.Like the fish, the moment a group hears something to fear- they dump stock and head to a safe place like money on the sidelines.But it is always inevitable that after a short while, perhaps after a few trading sessions, the greed takes over and a lot of people buy stocks. The reason the above is so important is the understanding on how stocks move up and down.Nhat no stock can keep moving in an upward direction. At some point it becomes overpriced and people start to sell. The real result is the stock moves up and down dozens of cycles each day.It takes time to get accustomed to a higher price for any stock. A buyer is weighing the price against the higher greed price. As the stock drops, the buyer is consumed with greed and buys. But the stock also moves the other way.So when I hear someone want a stock to move a point in a day for a $13 stock - that is very unusual. I thing a 5% move in any stock in any day is far more that I want to see. And it is mostly true that few stocks can support 4 or 5 upward sessions without dropping back to a lower level before they move u again.GE hs risen in the past 26 weeks from $6 to $13. That is more than doubled ans there is not actual higher earnings to support the move.There is a lot of buzz that the stock is moving up to at last $20 a share so the last couple of dollars stock price movement is mostly the belief that better times are coming up.Nothing wrong with hope as long as you don't get consumed that GE will be $13.50 next week, $14 the following week, and then be at $15 by the mid April.It takes time and a balance emotional investor to ride a rising stock and ""know when to hold and when to fold"".For now GE is a ""hold"" - but t some time in the distant future it will reach a point where it will be a ""fold them"".Greed and fear always dictate the situation.",0.9789

Although it may be a good business move for not only the company, but in the long run the regular investor as well, they should have rode the GREAT news of the AerCap Deal at least until next earnings report. In my opinion, GE share price would have at least rose to 17-18$ by then, no? I’ve been with GE since 2012 and have bought shares at 30$ and as low as 6.50$. I believe in this Company and I am very excited what Culp is doing to simplify GE’s model, lower its debt, and look after their employees and their customers. Future earnings and revenue should greatly sharpen as time transpires. We just need to be patient and it will happen, especially with energy efficiency talks growing rapidly and GE leading the way with wind turbines off shore in the U.K., no? Until public opinion grows extremely bullish (another 3-4 mo or so), the share price will gradually climb until it finally explodes to what it should be worth with their prevailing winds.

The company wants to bring that $70 billion figure down by about 35% to $45 billion by 2023, largely by cutting its roughly $43 billion in borrowings nearly in half.If the company is successful, that should bring its net debt down to about 2.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), compared to net debt of about 6 times EBITDA today.Happe said the company has ""multiple paths"" to reach its goal, including proceeds from its many divestitures and expected growth in free cash flow. GE will also own about 46% of AerCap after the deal closes, subject to a lockup of up to 15 months. Happe said that the company is likely to monetize that stake ""when the cycle recovers"" for airlines post-pandemic.General Electric is in the middle of a multiyear turnaround. The company is currently worth about one-sixth of its $600 billion market cap at the turn of the century, weighed down by its massive debt load and some market-topping acquisitions.The new GE will be smaller and more focused on aviation, healthcare, power, and renewables, with most of its financing and debt tied to those industrial businesses.Happe said that she expects current-quarter cash flow for GE to be ""meaningfully improved"" from the first quarter of 2020, a key metric analysts have been following in tracking the turnaround.",0.8894

2758,So i've sadly been involved with many reverse split companies and the stats are mind numbingly bad. Typically they go down in price till the reverse split then continue down afterwards. You have to keep buying without looking at the dwindling account till one day the price moves decisively back up and then you can get out with your shirt still on. But only if you keep averaging down and they dont go BK. This said reverse splits are typically reserved for companies with shares below a buck and in a struggling or very competitive environment. Then or of course theres corrupt management. Example Look at FCEL energy two 1 for 12 reverse splits in the last i think 4 years. Sure it popped up to 30 per share recently now back to 16.50. If you bought 100 shares in 1992 when the company first started they were trading at 207.00 per share. You held thats 20.700 invested. Two one for twelve splits now you got 4.16 shares. Ill let you do the math but it over 5000 per share for you to break even. My advice is to wait till after the split and wait more till after it tanks further then consider a long position or avoid this issue all together.If you have strong conviction just make sure you keep adding if your in love here. Full disclosure I hold no position in GE and after this blunder would only play the volatility through options. I took the time to to post this because of my experience with reverse splits. For a time it seemed like I was cursed and every stock I bought would would announce a reverse split then go bankrupt. Most recent example CHK a 1 for 200 RS. Yeah I was in that one to.I hope all make money here.Cheers,0.9924

2907,So i've sadly been involved with many reverse split companies and the stats are mind numbingly bad. Typically they go down in price till the reverse split then continue down afterwards. You have to keep buying without looking at the dwindling account till one day the price moves decisively back up and then you can get out with your shirt still on. But only if you keep averaging down and they dont go BK. This said reverse splits are typically reserved for companies with shares below a buck and in a struggling or very competitive environment. Then or of course theres corrupt management. Example Look at FCEL energy two 1 for 12 reverse splits in the last i think 4 years. Sure it popped up to 30 per share recently now back to 16.50. If you bought 100 shares in 1992 when the company first started they were trading at 207.00 per share. You held thats 20.700 invested. Two one for twelve splits now you got 4.16 shares. Ill let you do the math but it over 5000 per share for you to break even. My advice is to wait till after the split and wait more till after it tanks further then consider a long position or avoid this issue all together.If you have strong conviction just make sure you keep adding if your in love here. Full disclosure I hold no position in GE and after this blunder would only play the volatility through options. I took the time to to post this because of my experience with reverse splits. For a time it seemed like I was cursed and every stock I bought would would announce a reverse split then go bankrupt. Most recent example CHK a 1 for 200 RS. Yeah I was in that one to. I hope all make money here. Cheers,0.9936

That would be a lot more similar to a 50-50 merger with AerCap being the survivor.Or perhaps the deal includes GE feeding AerCap new business when GE needs to finance an airplane engine.If Culp really sold Biopharma for $21 billion with no strings attached, and if Culp sold GECAS for $24 billion and retained 46 % ownership with no strings attached - then he sold a $3 billion Biopharma yearly sales and a $5 billion GECAS yearly sales for only a total of around $8 billion yearly sales for a payment of about $45 billion (21 + 24 billion = $45 bilion) .and the rest of the empire (airplane, renewables, health, power) is still whole.That would be a very swift deal in my opinion.The only problem is we do not know what was included in the deal and GE may have some strings attached to take the sweetener out of the actual deal.",0.8651

Another elite company that provides tuition reimbursement is Mattress Firm.If I were a present day high school graduate... Who cares about $15.00 per hour flipping burgers or picking up trash in a Food Lion parking lot. A good percentage of parents have not invested in 529 plans; nor have they put back for education.When I went to work for GE back in the day; I had $300.00 to begin my education. GE provided some flexibility in my schedule as long as I worked my 40 hours and my portion of required overtime. GE took care of the rest of my tuition as long as there was a Grade C or above.

In fourth-quarter 2020, its earnings met estimates, while sales surpassed the same by 3.1%. In the quarters ahead, the company is poised to gain from its portfolio-restructuring program, expansion in digital business, efforts to deleverage balance sheet and solid liquidity position. Moreover, its efforts are on track to reduce the exposure to the GE Capital business. For 2021, it anticipates adjusted earnings per share of 15-25 cents. Industrial organic revenues are predicted to increase in low-single digits in the year, while adjusted organic margin is expected to expand 250 basis points. Also, Industrial free cash flow is expected to be $2.5-$4.5 billion in 2021. General Electric is working diligently to improve its liquidity and manage its leverage.",0.9884

I believe that GE and institutions are smarter than me so I will trust their vote. They are the ones that will decide, not retailer like your and me. There is nothing for anyone to gain or lose ""immediately"" upon an RS, it's simply a different number of shares with the same overall value. What is their exact reason for an RS, I don't know, could be to reduce volatility, maybe they buy back stock after frightening holders into selling driving the price down. I don't know, but everyone (except a small # of shorts) want the stock to go up, so why do a RS ?. There has got to be a hidden, underlying reason somewhere.

3870,"General Electric is selling off its aircraft leasing business, closing the books on its once mighty GE Capital unit, the financial arm of the company that had been its largest business and one of the world's most dominant financial institutions.GE is selling the aircraft leasing business known as GECAS to rival AerCap (AER), an Ireland-based company that will become by far the largest company in that industry with an estimated 25% to 30% share of the market. GE will receive $24 billion in cash and stock that will give it about a 46% stake in the combined company.The company plans to use proceeds to reduce its debt load by about $30 billion, part of a multi-year effort to slash $70 billion of debt from its balance sheet. It is the latest and among the most dramatic steps GE is taking to reshape and slim down the now struggling company.GECAS, which buys aircraft and leases them to airlines and other operators, had been providing most of the revenue for the GE Capital unit. But sales fell about 20% last year as the Covid-19 pandemic caused a plunge in air travel and massive losses across the airline industry. GECAS' cash-starved airline customers paid only about 84% of the unit's invoices in 2020. It resulted in a $786 million loss for 2020 after a $1 billion profit in 2019.",-0.2774

3898,"Here is something to watch carefully.With the news just announced that General Electric was moving half the GE Capital sales for 2020 to AerCap of Ireland, it may remove $4 billion of GE Capital sales on a $10 billion total volume in 2020.And it would also remove the GE loss on their balance sheet of $785 million on the $1.8 billion loss for GE capital in 2020.It would also remove GE borrowing $5 billion to support GE Capital (GECAS is their leasing aircraft portfolio in General Electric).What does all this mean.. Unless you really understand GE Capital as a stand alone unit - it is impossible to understand the effect on General Electric.But there are three things known for sure..... It will cut the GE debt by at least $5 billion. It will cut the inter-company loans between GE and GE Capital which has always been totally confusing.and It will definitely remove as much as $1.8 billion loss in 2020 from the FCF on the GE balance sheet.It is a lot of Harry Houdini I am sure - but to the analysts and the public anything to make the GE balance sheet simpler and anything to remove a negative FCF from the GE Capital division is positive for the GE price.And don't expect any help from the Stephen Tusa JP Morgan bear who is predicting a $5 stock or any other analyst. They a pathetic. All they can scream is too much debt, too little Free Cash Flow, not diversified enough since they have sold off lots and shrunk the company, and now Tusa's ridiculous statement that he is worried about a totally acceptable 81% pension funding. I am convinced they have never read the 10K quarterly filings. One lady analyst in December even said on The Street on TV that trying t understand GE financials is just too complicated for her. She doesn't read them!That is the poor quality you are relying on to handle your money and your investments. Pitiful..The next question will be the new Free Cash Flow number for 2021 and how the Wednesday March 10th conference will present their projectionsPerhaps the announcement a month ago the the FCF would be $2.5 to $4.5 billion was accurate then.But does that mean the next Culp prediction this week will now be adding the $1.8 billion GE Capital loss into his thinking and therefore making the new FCF now a $4.5 to $6.5 billion for this year?Remember when you are working with a $75 billion sales for 2020 company that was recently $100 billion in yearly sales in 2018 - it takes very little to return the company to over a dollar a share profit. Part is actual earning and part is just plain how you report the sales and costs. I business we call it the cut line or how the results for the quarter and year re accounted for.Add to that the potential for upward pricing Renewables, and power, and the normal understatement by Culp in predicting results - this could be a game changer. It could put the profit FCF potentially at maybe $7 billion or more and that would mean around $0.80 a share.At 8o cents a share - and using the very conservative 20 times earnings would translate into $16 a share and at 25 times earning it would easily come in at $20 stock price sometime mid 2021.So the AerCap announcement is really a dynamite blast if it means what I think it means.Culp is removing losers from his balance sheet and that makes the stock power upward.So this deal is very mysterious but it appears to move GE into a far better space with GE capital and GECAS - their airplane leasing division. It remove the 1,600 aircraft presently financed by GE on their balance sheet.",0.9973

Renewables had losses in 2018and 2019 when they were spending $500 million creating and improving in their wind turbines in their plants. They have perfected the radical game changing Halaide 13W and installed a test model in Rotherdam. If they had not spent that $500 million money their figures would be close to a break even. For my part - I am all for the expense if it leads to progress and profit.The point of all the above is to see that s the world returns to pre pandemic it is not a far reach for GE to achieve their $8.8 billion FCF this year in 2021 and the stock to return to $20 a share.You can add to that three things.Payroll was halved, GE now tops anyone in renewables and there fore will be profitable going forward at perhaps 5% to 8%, and Aviation has a lot of existing and very stable military and commercial engine service contracts to keep them profitable - not to mention Rolls Royce and Pratt & Whitney are seriously wounded financially and reputation going forward.Also three other important changes are the reduction of long term debt, the taking control of GE Capital and reducing that independent part of the company's exposure, and also important definitely getting a reduction on paying into their pension fund more money to get them at least 81% funded.And lastly the management change has given General Electric a whole new culture and direction. Culp underpromises and over performs. I love the surprises that proel the stock up a point or more.What can anyone subtract from the above numbrs and direction to prove to me that GE's future is not only a $20 stock - but more likely in 2022 a $30 stock as they improve their Free Cash Flow.",0.9924

Technical program traders saw the pattern breaking down 10-moving average also joined to short the stock.If you listen to the conference call, all are positive news. I am gain more confidence after I saw the GE’s price movement quickly moved from $12 to $14.5 last week. It made me believe GE is alive again. GE could reach $16 due to the trend momentum if the company didn’t announce the reverse split. This has temporarily caused the up trend to trade sideways in short term. With GE’s recovery is in progress, the up trend momentum will come back. When that comes, nothing will stop it go higher. GE will be best stock which positions for next few year’s recovery.

4219,"This is a story about GE, That doesn't talk about shr. price ,dividend,or earnings.this is the story about GE ENGINES.Part 1From the turbosupercharger to the world's most powerful commercial jet engine, GE's history of powering the world's aircraft features more than 100 years of innovation.GE Aviation: Powering a Century of FlightWhen the United States entered World War I in 1917, the U.S. government searched for a company to develop the first airplane engine ""booster"" for the fledgling U.S. aviation industry. This booster, or turbosupercharger, installed on a piston engine, used the engine's exhaust gases to drive an air compressor to boost power at higher altitude.GE accepted the challenge first, but another team also requested the chance to develop the turbosupercharger. Contracts were awarded in what was the first military aircraft engine competition in the U.S. Under wartime secrecy, both companies tested and developed various designs until the Army called for a test demonstration.In the bitter atmosphere of Pikes Peak, 14,000 feet above sea level, GE demonstrated a 350-horsepower, turbosupercharged Liberty aircraft engine and entered the business of making airplanes fly higher, faster and with more efficiency than ever before. That mountaintop test of the first turbosupercharger landed GE's first aviation-related government contract and paved the way for GE to become a world leader in jet engines.For more than two decades, GE produced turbosuperchargers that enabled aircraft, including many in service during World War II, to fly higher, with heavier payloads. The company's expertise in turbines and turbosuperchargers figured into the U.S. Army Air Force's decision to select GE to develop the nation's first jet engine.Since then, the aircraft engines division of GE Aviation has scored many firsts. Among them: America's first jet engine, the first turbojet engines to power flights at two and three times the speed of sound, and the world's first high bypass turbofan engine to enter service.Today, GE Aviation is a global provider of engines, systems, and services, with revenues exceeding $30 billion. As a leader in aviation technology, GE Aviation continues to design, develop and manufacture jet engines, components and integrated systems for military, commercial and business and general aircraft as well as aero-derivative gas turbines for marine applications. In addition, GE Aviation is the world's leading integrated engine maintenance resource.GE Builds America's First Jet EngineBecause principles and challenges in turbosuperchargers apply to gas turbines as well, GE was a logical choice to build America's first jet engine.In 1941, the U.S. Army Air Corps picked GE's Lynn, Massachusetts, plant to build a jet engine based on the design of Britain's Sir Frank Whittle. Six months later, on April 18, 1942, GE engineers successfully ran the I-A engine.In October 1942, at Muroc Dry Lake, California, two I-A engines powered the historic first flight of a Bell XP-59A Airacomet aircraft, launching the United States into the Jet Age. The thrust rating of the I-A was 1,250 pounds; the thrust rating of the GE90-115B is more than 90 times as great at 115,000 pounds.The I-A engine incorporated a centrifugal-flow compressor, as did the increasingly more powerful engines developed by GE during the next two years, culminating in the J33 engine, which was rated at 4,000 pounds of thrust. The J33 powered the U.S. Army Air Corps' first operational jet fighter, the P-80 Shooting Star, to a world's speed record of 620 miles per hour in 1947. Before the end of that year, a GE J35 engine powered a Douglas D-558-1 Skystreak to a record-breaking 650 miles per hour. The J35 was the first GE turbojet engine to incorporate an axial-flow compressor--the type of compressor used in all GE engines since then.However, the Air Corps, concerned about disrupting supplies of turbosuperchargers, placed production of GE's jet engines with other manufacturers. GE then set about designing another. The resulting J47 put GE back in the business of building jet engines. But demand for the J47 to power almost all the new front-line military aircraft, particularly the F-86 Sabre Jet, meant the Lynn plant could not keep up. GE needed a second factory.GE selected a federally owned plant near Cincinnati, Ohio, where Wright Aeronautical piston engines had been produced during World War II. GE formally opened the plant on February 28, 1949, with the second J47 production line, to complement the original line at Lynn. Later, the plant would be known as Evendale and would become GE Aviation's world headquarters.With the Korean War boosting demand, the J47 became the world's most produced gas turbine. More than 35,000 J47 engines were delivered by the end of the 1950s. That engine scored two major firsts: it was the first turbojet certified for civil use by the U.S. Civil Aeronautics Administration- and the first to use an elec",0.9989

Welch and Immelt and many like them in corporate America think too much about how to gather wealth from stock options on the backs of shareholders and not enough about how to build shareholder equity and buy their shares on the open market the way common shareholders do. The best run publicly traded companies in America limit the use of stock options as a form of compensation, limit dilution of common shareholders, limit the need for share buybacks of the share dilution caused by issuing shares for stock options, and grow shareholder equity and the ability to pay a dividend with growing positive cash flow. The excessive use of stock options in publicly traded companies concentrates wealth into the executives who have the power to reward themselves in that way, dilutes common shareholders, and robs shareholders of the opportunity for a dividend or reinvestment by the use of cash to buy back the shares they issued to themselves to overcompensate themselves for no productive difference or better performance; furthermore, this bad widespread practice incentivizes risks that do not justify the rewards for shareholders and are only justified by the recipients of stock options.",0.9954

So, an okay to moderate deal was priced into the stock. However, what was announced this morning was a significantly better deal. The leasing unit was sold at around $50 billion in value -- $26 billion in cash, upfront (which is a lot better than $30 on ""terms""), and the rest in stock in the new company.GE stock should be up by at least a dollar a share based on that news, maybe $1.50 at least during the day, with a close at $15. This drop has all to do with the reverse split which demonstrates how retail investors don't like that move. I think it's wrong but it's not $1.80 per current share wrong. Institutions are smart enough to know this and I suspect they are buying and will continue to buy because this is a short term opportunity to get the shares on sale.

Both are fabrications looking for fools....Yes the last $20 billion of GE Capital will be debt on the company books directly now. But there is also a $21 billion asset in the AerCap stock - the 111 million shares of AerCap stock owned by GE. The change in the financials is zero. Zero. Zero.Steven Tusa says GE will be 8 times indebted in capital debt to capital assets.. That is simply a lie.GE Capital is $115 billion. GE debt shoud now be around $25 billion left after the AerCap deal and they are heading to 2.5:1 - debt to profit ratio.That means if GE returns to $10 billion FCF in 2022 and owed $25 bilion in debt - that is a true 2.5:1 debt of profit ratio.But never forget that GE has uncommitted with assets unused. Tthe Baker stock is sellable at $7 billion.The AerCap stock will be sellable at about $21 billion. And there is still on standby $45 billion cash against their $70 billion debt.So play with your numbers, throw a fit, sell and scream, but nothing will changeSame for the 8:1 reverse split. Everyone is in a ""tizzy"" for nothing. General Electric will be the same the day after the split happens.And that split will definitely be for the best as we get rid of all the Robinhood traders.Today the volume was just under 300 million shares traded.I never thought the e were that many buyers of GE stock. That today volume represents 1/25th of all GE stock traded today.Since over 60% is locked up in long term funds pension and hedge fund holdings - it really unveils how many day traders and unsophisticated trders are out there.

The CF6 family grew to include the CF6-50, CF6-80A, CF6-80C2 and CF6-80E1. In the 1980s, the CF6 family of engines emerged as the most popular engines powering wide-body aircraft, including the Boeing 747 and 767, the Airbus A300, A310, A330 and the McDonnell Douglas MD-11.The CF6, in service since 1971, continues to add to its impressive record of flight hours, more than any other commercial aircraft engine ever accumulated. To put that in perspective, it is the equivalent of one engine running 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for more than 26,000 years.The CF6-80C2 engine, which entered service in 1985, has set new standards of reliability in commercial service and has been instrumental in the rise of GE as a leading supplier of large commercial engines.Perhaps the greatest compliment afforded the CF6-80C2 was the U.S. government's selecting the engine to power the U.S. president's 747 aircraft, Air Force One.The CF6 engine family, in service since 1971, continues to add to its impressive record of flight hours, more than any other high-thrust commercial jet engine ever accumulated.

Then Assistant U.S. Attorney General Demers noted at that time, “The indictment alleges a textbook example of the Chinese government’s strategy to rob American companies of their intellectual property and to replicate their products in Communist Chinese factories, enabling Communist Chinese companies to replace the American company first in the Chinese market and later worldwide.”Looking back a bit further, yet contemporaneous with the activities of Ng, we see that in October 2018, Chinese Ministry of State Security officer was arrested in Belgium and then subsequently extradited to the United States for his part in targeting and attempting to steal trade secrets and intellectual property from GE aviation.ALARM BELLS FOR COMPANIESWhile it is heartening to note the three separate efforts to steal General Electric’s technologies resulted in indictments, alarm bells should be sounding for every defense contractor regardless of sector.The alarm?

That might make sense....I doubt that this is a straight $30 billion sale of GECAs to AERCAP. I t has too much debt for AERCAP and AERCAP is too small for that sort of deal in the middle of a pandemic and a slow-down aircraft leasing industry. Their sales in 2020 were under-performing and poor..More importantly, someone on this thread said that the GECAS-AERCAP dela would erase $25 billion or 1/4th of the GE Capitalization. Totally wrong.GECAS may be valued at $30 to $40 billion, but it only generates $5 billion per year at GE Capital and it doesn't seem to make money. It is also about 1/2 of the total GE Capital holdings of around $10 billion.And another analyst (CFRA Research) falsely said that by selling GECAS and BIOPHRMA - General Electric was getting rid of the crown jewels. They said the RENEWABLES AND POWER divisions were losers.Wrong. RENEWABLES AND POWER are the new horizon for General Electric. Both have a ton of growth and promise. While they have not made a lot of profit in the past - they can make a lot of profit going forward.GECAS at $5 billion yearly sales and BIOPHARMA t $3 billion yearly sales are just 8% sales of the $100 billion General Electric was recording in 2018. And the large growth of RENEWABLES from $8 billion sales in 2018 to $15 billion sales in 2020 and probably approaching $20 billion sales in 2021 more that offset the GECAS AND BIOPHARMA loss of sales volume.I think GE RENEWABLES will soon be clocking 8% bottom line of $1.6 billion Free Cash Flow in 2021. And remember - GE has not said it was selling GECAS. It is entering into a strengthening deal to change the GE Balance sheet. That is magic in the account industry of how giant industrial companies wring out the best numbers.Look for Larry Culp to squeeze every drop of profit and balance sheet readjustment that is possible going forward while keeping the four crown jewels of the present General Electric.And for serious investors and stockholder - what could be better for the stock than profits going forward, debt erased, and improve balance sheet in the near future ....",0.9982
