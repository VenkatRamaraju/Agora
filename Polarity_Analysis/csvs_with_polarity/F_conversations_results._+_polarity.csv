More than 20,000 superchargers available globally. This is like adding the equivalent income from owners of gas stations such as Shell or ExxonMobil or Chevron to a car company.8. Home charging units installed by Tesla.9. The only car company with over-the-air upgrades.10. Auto-pilot and self-driving.11. Tesla Gigafactories.IMO Ford needs to design its EV so it can use Tesla's 20,000+ charging stations and add more charging stations worldwide compatible with the Tesla chargers.

You have an excellent insurance policy . The only potential draw back which is about a likely as winning the lotto is Ford actually makes outsized profits , restores the dividend and the stock jumps mutiple point. In the meantime all this celebration , dare I say relief from the Three Stooges after more than a two point drop is really uncalled for, as the stock has not rebounded much off the low. Again we see as I sated for weeks lower lows , and lower highs. With Ford it is far better to be cautious and see the earnings . Anything can happen but you have to follow the logical path. The annual meeting will not reveal anything amazing. And we will be waiting for sales numbers for April, May, June. And next earnings call.

In addition, it also plans another 10,000 chargers, called Waypoints, that will be open for public use.Rivian is laying the groundwork for its customers as it nears the launch of its first electric vehicles R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV this summer. The announcement is also well-timed with President Joe Biden’s electric vehicle push and a call to build more than 500,000 new electric vehicle charging stations by 2030. A robust charging infrastructure is essential to help grow the adoption of electric vehicles faster without which buyers will stay away. Seen as a Tesla competiitor, Rivian’s Waypoint chargers will be open to the public. In contrast, Tesla, which has a network of over 20,000 superchargers, offers the service only to the owners of its own brand such as Model 3, Model S, Model X or Model Y.Rivian has raised about $8 billion since the beginning of 2019 and is valued at $27.6 billion.

709,"Here is my own summary of a May 10 (4:45 PM) ""Zack's Equity Resarch"" article titled ""Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Moves -0.93%: What You Should Know"":1. The recent loss on Monday by Ford was similar to the automotive (autos/tires/trucks) sector loss. So, nothing to worry about... just par.2. There will be an expected EPS loss of $0.40 in Q2. That, too, is in line with guidance from Ford. However, revenue is expected to be up by over 28%. In my opinion, that's OK until this chip shortage is really sorted out.3. Zack's estimate for 2021 (full year) earnings is $0.95 per share with annual revenue of just over $125 billion. This, to me, indicates an inflection point even though the numbers, I believe, are somewhat conservative. The end of this year could be a breakout period.4. It looks like other analysts will be revising the stock price higher with updated revenue estimate revisions. That's always good news.5. Forward P/E valuation is 12.49 compared to the 16.39 sector average. So, relatively speaking, F is traded at a discount. That's good to know.6. My favorite valuation metric is the PEG ratio (price/earnings to growth ratio). A PEG ratio of 1.0 or lower indicates a fair or discounted valuation. The PEG ratio for Ford is 0.57, very low; in my opinion, Ford is VERY undervalued compared to the automotive sector average PEG ratio of 1.64. 7. Currently, the (cyclical!) automotive sector represents a ""hot"" sector now with plenty of growth potential.LONG on Ford. Currently, this is my favorite stock for the coming years. Yes, years.",0.9928

719,"Guys & Gals, what's everyone's honest opinion on self driving cars? I honestly think they are missing the demand for self driving cars. I don't want a car that can auto drive above 15MPH. 15MPH works for me and no faster. I could have some wine with my meal, whistle my trusty Ford steed, get in the passenger side, and travel to the bar, go dancing, then have my trusty steed open the door for me and I could rest in the back seats while it takes me home and parks. It could have a flashing neon sign that flashes ""Bar"" in red so everyone knows it's on owner collect mode. But, I would only want it to do that at 15MPH. I've crashed my mountain bike at 15MPH, both with and without beers. It's an acceptable speed to crash at. In my Ford Autosteed, I imagine the braking distance at 15MPH is very short and worst that can happen is I roll into that uncomfortable space in the rear seat footwell area. If it sees a loco Tesla (think KARR (Knight Automated Roving Robot) from Knight Rider) Ford could have a Tesla Danger proximity sensor, that arms some form of defensive taser to fry the Teslas formidable loco-processor before it intentionally swerves to hit me. Obviously, this should not be needed if all self driving cars were capped at 15MPH.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYs_DkFIqx8",0.3078

Tesla nearly 700 remember that is after a SPLIT. So we wait for Ford to show us something besides smoke and mirrors. There sales were pathetic compared to GM and Tesla. With Ford it is always something , and wait till next quarter. As I said the Three Stooges Yasu Taco Baell, Steve posts photos like a little kids and Unkommon Little man were quick a day afer sales to start with just wait till next quarter.Look Ford did well enough the problem as it has been and will be is UAW labor costs. The idea now is if Ford can hang on long enough unti EV dominate they will be able to cut the work force dramatically . This will cut the outragous labor costs and increase profit margins . Will see. As for Managment I don`t get the rah rah. Farley has been there for what 15 years ? Hardly new. And booted from Toyota. It is true Steve does not grasp that Ford does not get much of the pie. 17 Million auto sales but what did Ford get. Increase in China but how many cars did they sell. Yes, if Ford only made the 150 without UAW labor they would be a great small company bringing in tons of money.Invested in GM , self evident to anyone but the Three Stooges Yasu, Steve, Unkoomon Littleman Why .

Ford warned last week that it expects the chip shortage to hit its worst point in the current quarter, with some improvements in supply likely in the second half of 2021.

GM may not want too or need too. Negotiating shortfalls ? What does that mean ? Paying more for chips so he has sales numbers but not profits. That could be Ford has done it before and lost money.

Once substantial inflation arises governments will pull the regulation lever and vaporize crypto value to slow inflation by reducing currency that can be spent on goods and services without damaging the official currency. And I am sure these same young and restless will be very angry when this happens all the while not considering that they themselves where the ones chose to revolt and rail against the establishment. LIKE in VEGAS THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS IN THE END ! Advice: sell 25% of your holdings in crypto and turn it back into fiat currency now so you don’t get caught off guard when regulators act.,0.8639

As of now for Ford to move to the 13 plus it is going to take a heck of a surprize and annual meeting to cause that move. Another suggestion I made which was spot on was wait for mkt correction before earnings buy and sell covered calls out a bit. That would work have worked.You can listen to THE THREE STOOGES BUY BUY at highs or someone who actually owns stocks , me.

What Happened: Speculation on the joint venture found more fire last month after SK Innovation agreed to pay rival LG Energy Solution $1.8 billion to settle all legal disputes relating to EV batteries in the U.S. and South Korea.Ford and SK Innovation, a key supplier, will announce the details on Thursday, as per the Reuters report.The development comes amid President Joe Biden calling for government aid for new battery production facilities as part of a $174 billion EV proposal during a visit to a Ford plant in Michigan on Tuesday. SK Innovation is expected to complete the Georgia plant's construction later this year. Its second facility next door is expected to begin battery production in 2023. Why It Matters: Batteries are going to play a key differentiator role in the electric vehicle race. Automakers are relying on different strategies and partners to achieve similar goals — higher range and small packs at lower costs.Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) for instance currently makes batteries in partnership with Japan's Panasonic at its $5 billion Nevada factory. It also has South Korea's LG Chem and China's CATL as suppliers for its Shanghai factory and is now reportedly in talks with China’s EVE Energy Co for a battery tie-up.See Also: Tesla Seeks To Improve Supply Of Low-Cost Batteries In Deal With China's EVE Energy: ReportRival General Motors Co (NYSE: GM) has a battery joint venture with LG Energy and is building plants in Ohio and Tennessee.Price Action: Shares of Ford closed 0.25% lower at $12.11 on Wednesday.",0.9944

""because it is better"". ""It's just better."" she repeated a few times.Then, she concluded with the implication that in the very short term, we Americans are about to adopt EVs from now on because of the impending success and acceptance of the F-150 Lighting.

From the Detroit Free Press, aka Ford’s PR Department:On an otherwise quiet Saturday in April, a high-profile section of Detroit's Corktown neighborhood rumbled with activity thanks to a massive concrete operation involving 250 truckloads of cement at Michigan Central Station.An estimated 25 trucks — pouring every hour for 10 hours — ended up laying a total of more than 2,000 yards of concrete, Rich Bardelli, project construction manager, told the Free Press on Sunday.Ford is planning to spend four more days on a similar schedule over the next month or so for a total of 11,000 yards of concrete poured, he said.Ford Motor Co. continued its restoration efforts with plans to open Michigan Central Station in late 2022. Superior Cement trucks lined up outside the iconic building on Saturday, April 24, 2021 and spent 10 hours pouring concrete in the sub-basement.The concrete is stabilizing part of the sub-basement of the station that had been underwater for decades. Ford previously had work crews pump out nearly 227,000 gallons of water that flooded the station's basement and its little-known sub-basement. ""It was our first pour like this to take care of the basement area,"" Bardelli said. ""This is one of the first big pours we've had.

1940,"In an ""Autoblog"" article called ""Ford F-150 Lightning debut to be projected on 64,000-square-foot screen at HQ"" by Ben Hsu (May 10, 5:30 PM), I came away with these summarized points, in my own words:1. The ""secret"" why the 12-story Ford World Headquarters (the so-called ""Glass House"") is now covered with white fabric/material is because its temporary purpose as a 64,000 square foot projection screen to debut/announce the ""F-150 Lighting"" model on May 19. I consider that impressive!2. The article emphasizes that the Ford HQ fronts ""One America Road"". I agree that, too, is very symbolic and significant.3. The public event will be live at Ford HQ, the Las Vegas strip, and New York's Time Square. That's showmanship!4. This event is atypical. There's some ""out of the box thinking"" going on here. For that reason, I like it.5. The author remarks on a ""paradigm shift"" and a ""philosophical leap"" to celebrate a big change in Ford's direction. That may be an accurate description!6. As you all know, the F-150 has been the best selling vehicle in North America for 40 years. Ford, in my opinion, is not ""messing around"" with its best selling model.7. In my opinion, this event is all about brand awareness. IMHO, that's a very good way to market to the entire world, a GLOBAL statement. 8. How many corporations would dream up something like this? Not a traditional staid relic of the past... [irony intended]... but a vibrant leader in the nascent EV GLOBAL market.9. Could this be viewed as a wildly patriotic public relations stunt? Probably. But, I think it's earned and justified; I don't mind at all when a classic American car company wants to crow for attention when real innovation can be showcased and applauded.10. A GLOBAL audience will be watching. This is a GLOBAL message.LONG on Ford. For those who are patient, you will be rewarded.",0.9915

2050,"Some leaks of the Ford Electric F-150 event, looks like Ford is going all out. Will be a major transitionary message for the brand moving into an EV future. We should get a nice run-up going into and after the event.""In an ""Autoblog"" article called ""Ford F-150 Lightning debut to be projected on 64,000-square-foot screen at HQ"" by Ben Hsu (May 10, 5:30 PM), I came away with these summarized points, in my own words:1. The ""secret"" why the 12-story Ford World Headquarters (the so-called ""Glass House"") is now covered with white fabric/material is because its temporary purpose as a 64,000 square foot projection screen to debut/announce the ""F-150 Lighting"" model on May 19. I consider that impressive!2. The article emphasizes that the Ford HQ fronts ""One America Road"". I agree that, too, is very symbolic and significant.3. The public event will be live at Ford HQ, the Las Vegas strip, and New York's Time Square. That's showmanship!4. This event is atypical. There's some ""out of the box thinking"" going on here. For that reason, I like it.5. The author remarks on a ""paradigm shift"" and a ""philosophical leap"" to celebrate a big change in Ford's direction. That may be an accurate description!6. As you all know, the F-150 has been the best selling vehicle in North America for 40 years. Ford, in my opinion, is not ""messing around"" with its best selling model.7. In my opinion, this event is all about brand awareness. IMHO, that's a very good way to market to the entire world, a GLOBAL statement. 8. How many corporations would dream up something like this? Not a traditional staid relic of the past... [irony intended]... but a vibrant leader in the nascent EV GLOBAL market.9. Could this be viewed as a wildly patriotic public relations stunt? Probably. But, I think it's earned and justified; I don't mind at all when a classic American car company wants to crow for attention when real innovation can be showcased and applauded.10. A GLOBAL audience will be watching. This is a GLOBAL message.""",0.9891

I’m a truck driver so take what I say with a grain of salt. My large position is in HITIF, a retail focused vertically integrated company from Canada. They are aggressively expanding their footprint in Canada, they have 84 current stores that offer a clean and professional service selling everything from flower to smoke to the bongs to smoke it out of. They are adding no less than one store per week. With passage of meaningful legislation the US market will be ripe for the picking in the next 12 months.They already are posting positive EBITDA and are increasing their net profit margins. They also have the leading E-commerce platforms that are able to offer products in the US and world wide. The founder and CEO has the biggest share position in the stock with nearly 17% of the shares, if the sp goes down he loses more than anyone. He has never sold a single share and doesn’t plan to, ever. They are massively undervalued, current prices are under 50 cents a share. Fair value alone is around $4 according to analysts.

While 1% might seem a little disappointing, the big YOY increase of 23% in higher profit, retail sales is very positive. Ford also reported a high percentage of those purchasers were first timers to the brand. Ford's F150 recorded an overall 9% YOY increase despite parts shortages, and weather related plant shutdowns. Ford's retail sales of the pickup were also up 24% YOY, and overall retail market share of the pickup also increased by 3%.Based on the above, I think Ford will beat the Q1 EPS consensus estimate.Next months announced plant shutdowns seem to have taken a little steam out of the equity, but there will be a great deal of positive news in the coming days, weeks, and months. IMO, the trajectory will still continue upward, and will accelerate into H2.Just a couple tidbits:Argo AI, which Ford owns approximately 2/3, has indicated they may IPO.

Revenue and earnings per share (EPS) forecasts were both revised downwards, with the analysts seeing grey clouds on the horizon.Following the downgrade, the consensus from twelve analysts covering Ford Motor is for revenues of US$123b in 2021, implying a perceptible 4.3% decline in sales compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are supposed to crater 27% to US$0.73 in the same period. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$144b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.97 in 2021.

GM has the same but they discharged all their debt in the bankrupcy . No , nobody cares how they did just that they did. Eventually the labor cost will catch up to them but for now not so much.

2800,"In a ""ZACKS"" May 10 article (6:39 AM) titled ""Auto Sales Finally Rebounding: Can Carmakers Bounce Back?"", author Ritujay Ghosh describes the automotive market as quite rosy.Here is my own summary of the key points:1. At this time, there is a huge rebound in the demand for cars.2. A number of different car companies have seen major growth in revenues.3. It appears that customers are willing to spend more on more expensive models.4. April was a GREAT month in car sales, quoting J.D. Power, that ""new vehicle sales reached 13.6 million, increasing by over 110% over year. (Yes, last year was the year of COVID; but the change is still dramatic.) 5. Of all new vehicle sales, trucks and SUVs will account for 76% of USA sales. In my view, that means that Ford will be very well positioned. 6. On top of that, new vehicle sales are expected to increase by over 20% over 2019 base line sales, well before ""the COVID effect"".7. Inventory is LOW. If you add Jim Cramer's animated pro-Ford sentiments that this is the best car market that he has ever seen in his life, I believe the near future for Ford, certainly for the next year or so, looks very, very promising for LONG investors. The value train will be chugging along...",0.9958

AGAIN theissue is Ford does not gain when the going is good.Do not start with the Covid recovery from 5 . That was pure speculation. And a bounce from bankrupcy pricing. Ford has not moved on fundamentals, other than it is exactly where it has been a Company that promises a lot but has not delievered. Though prior it paid a divdend. WHICH if you read my history I stated it would be gone 2020 . That was long before we knew about Covid. The divdend elimination helps pay for the FORD family and UAW pay increases. Next for weeks now I have explained to Unkoomon Little Man that were going to have to see March sales and tread with caution. Sell covered calls . He mocked my Sept 18 calls. Yes, I made a mistake and closed too soon. Still made a killing. But could have made thousands more. Selling Ford calls is like taking candy from a baby . Up around 6 thousand for the year already . Pennies to Steve UAW probabaly more than he spent for the 1999 Toyota he drives. Though he does fantasize a lot about them. Can you post actual photos on here ?

We'll see if Ford guides within the previous $1B to $2.5 potential profit cut for the year. One thing to keep in mind, when it comes to analyst's full year profit estimates, Ford had actually guided well above street consensus. It's possible even with a cut in profit, that the street number can be met or even beaten. I think things are shaping up to have a really strong 2nd half of this year. Last year Ford experienced a record breaking Q3, but not so much for Q4 with the new pickup truck plant retooling. There was also new models like the Mach E, and Bronco Sport entering production.

Yes, but that's not the kind of dip we are talking about. A dip happens when a rising stock gets far away from a moving averge, is overbought, and then returns to that average. That drop from the high back to its moving average is the dip you could consider buying into. I use the ten day moving average. Others will use the 20, 50 or even the 200 day moving average as their buy in points. On the daily charts, Ford's 10 day moving average is at $12.32. The Dow's 10 day moving average is 31,616. Either prices will drop to their 10 day moving average or the 10 day moving average will up as price moves sideways.

I'm unsure where F is going to get the money to compete with all the electric company wannabes that have blank checks to make it. Tesla has pretty much a blank check as they can always do secondary offerings, while dilutive, funds future growth. Sell a couple million TSLA shares, and build a new facility just like that. F to get the same bang for the buck would have to sell 116 million shares to build a new plant.While I like F, I feel its never going to ever be anything more than a good source for a dividend.Other than the hype on F right now, what really is supporting its stock price?

Scammers employ a number of different tactics to lure you into their scheme. Generally speaking, their goal is to trick you into making an outbound call to an expensive international toll number. The ‘One Ring’ Phone ScamIn this scam, the perpetrator dials their target and hangs up just before the call is answered. These “one-ring” phone scammers intentionally end the outbound call immediately after the first ring. They usually use a robocall autodialer or internet phone that can supply falsified caller ID information to make the number appear legitimate to prevent suspicion on the part of the victim. The scammer may leave more than one missed call so that the victim assumes someone they know is trying urgently to reach them. Because telemarketers and phone spammers typically do not call more than once, potential targets tend to call back a number who has called them repeatedly. If you see a series of missed calls from one phone number you do not recognize, run a reverse phone lookup in order to search for the owner’s identity before you return the call.",0.8451

(Two government studies show NO safety improvement with Daytime Running Lights.) The dealer did this with a software change. They do this for all government vehicles, police cars, and other law enforcement.2) Eliminated the DANGEROUS feature in the navigation system that will not allow a PASSENGER to enter an address when the vehicle is in motion. A simple plug-in module available on the Internet accomplish this goal. Much safer now.3) Added a simple plug-in override module so the engine will not turn off at stop signs and traffic lights. This will improve engine life. Engine stop-start technology will save you about 1 gallon of gas in the LIFETIME of the vehicle. Constant restarts is hard on the engine.4) Removed the beeper. Now I can have my car door open with the key in the ignition, or drive with something oversized in my trunk without having the “nanny beeper” driving me bananas.",0.9905
3619,"A very strong week for mkt ! Is everybody clueless ? Except the Morons , Steve, UnkommonLittleman , Yasu ?As Ford has fallen as I said it wouod after the terrible sales numbers . As I said the Three Stooges are no more than Black Jack players that got lucky , if they actually own shares of Ford . Questionable .Even if Ford surprizes or meets earnings , who knows what guidence they will give or if they will outline a plan anyone understands who invests . Sure The Stooges will undertsand the plan LOL nobody else will as Wall Street has said before.Basically other than a big surprize the upside will be tuff , especically if mkt pulls back. We saw the results with a very minor down day . As I have said repeatly Ford only goes up marginally on strong mkt days. when mkt falls it reteats albiet slowly but continues down after the mkt rallies .This Company is , has been and continues to be very mismanaged. The UAW wage structure remains its major problem. It simply is not substainable with commodity products.Unless something like a Bronco comes along and roars with premium pricing [ like the Jeep was when I looked at one selling for sticker no discount] we will muddle along until Ford can reduce costs . Via Mexico or whatever . If not they will simly survive as they have for last 10 years. Worse the Fords have found they can eliminate the dividend and do fine.Many idiots here have commented oh but Fords want dividend. Sure they do. But when a board member is paid 500 thousand plus stock options plus free travel, food, drink, cars and it is not even their primary job.They still do quite well.

This truck's original MSRP was $60,600. The truck appraised for $54,000!!! A 3-year-old truck appraised for just $6,600 less than ORIGINAL MSRP. With rebates and dealer discounts, you literally could have bought this truck for less than $54,000 BRAND NEW in 2018!Now, WHY do you suppose the market for this truck is so high?? The answer is what I have been telling you permabull clowns for two weeks now. Ford cannot produce enough vehicles to satisfy demand. We have ONE, count them, ONE new Super Duty truck on our lot when, normally, we have 20+. And guess what else? There are NONE in transit and NONE currently being built at the factory for future delivery. We have a total of 57 new vehicles on our lot when we normally have 300.

In sympathy with Tesla, GM, VK automotive in general . Yes, the drop to 5 was very justified . Based on Pre covid 4 th quarter loss, UAW wage increases , terrible 5 years of medicore profits . I should clarify the statement , Ford was headed to the 7 to 8 range before COIVD. Finacially after the scare it seems to have stabilized. It does have new products coming out. But now the whole automotive sector is faced with a chip shortage . The good news this year things could still turn around. The bad news contrary to those who don`t know , a lot of the hype is just that hype about Farley . He has had a lackluster career at Ford 16 years. Was basically booted from Toyota and landed at Ford. Most of Ford problems are UAW inflicted. I am not sure what a CEO can do about profit margins with UAW labor . Maybe they can correct the constant recalls [ though many are do to cheap parts to yes compenstate for high labor costs ] get launches off on time. The Train Station we have no info on that 8 billion boon doggle. Farley so far is just following whatever plan Hackett had, which nobody understood . As I said for the last 11 years here . Ford should have one last run in her before BK. We did get to 17 fell a bit returned and then down she went .EV well ok that is something new , maybe a game changer for awhile in the end a commodity product. Outside of EV changes Ford is not going to 30 . Maybe we can get to 20 a long shot. But at some point we have had the longest bull market in history in cars and stocks. It will end. Ford claimed it could be profitable with total sales of 12 million we found that not to be true.

3848,"STEVE going to start you off with a high school paragraph on sales and profit .Differences of Sales and ProfitsProfits and sales are not the same thing. If you think sales and profits are the same thing, you're in for a major shock. Sales start the process of earning money. It goes something like this: The company sells a product or service to a customer. The customer pays either immediately or within an agreed upon time period. Expenses to make and sell the product are subtracted from the money generated by sales. General and administration costs are subtracted as are depreciation and interest. What remains is called profit. Put simply, sales minus expenses equals profit. Sales are also called revenue. Profit is called income, net income and operating income.IF YOU GO BACK WHEN you first came to my class you Yasu , Unkoomon I explained over and over to you Stooges that posting sales numbers and that the FORD 150 was the NUMBER ONE SELLING VEHICLE has no bearing on the stock price. Now I am dumbing this down for you. Yes you need sales. But how much incentives did Ford provide ? Also , I hammered this home for Ford to increase the sales of the 150 a significant amount is difficult uunless the mkt total vehicles grows. It did but Ford actually gets less and less of the toal vehicle market each year.Again try to understand this amazing fact 32 BILLION loss on 3 million cars sold. I was on this board when the clowns like you kept saying I DO NOT UNDERTSAND IT We sold A LOT OF CARS.NEXT WAGES AND LABOR . LABOR is the most importance cost of a vehicle. You can only control fuel costs for factorys , heating , cooling, maintance , transportaion and so much more to a small extent. BUT if you I am building a car and my labor is 15 verse yours at 30 most other things are equal .SAME AS ANY BUSINESS. My brother best friends with CEO of his hospitial guy makes 6 million and what does he tell my brother , we have too keep out RN unions. We fired our janitor staff , food service and brought in contractors. There paying around minimum wage and they can get the job done. And no they have no problems getting people to work .",0.997

Retail sales of F-Series pickups, powered by the all-new F-150 and a new hybrid variant, rose 23% from a year ago. Ford said that demand for the hybrid F-150s increased steadily through the quarter. Overall F-Series sales, including fleet results, were up 9.2% in the quarter despite chip-related production disruptions at the two U.S. factories that build the F-150. Sales of SUVs to retail customers also surged in the quarter, rising 37% on high demand for the new Bronco Sport and the electric Mustang Mach-E. Ford sold 6,614 Mach-Es in the quarter, with vehicles selling just 7 days after reaching dealers, on average -- exceptionally quick by industry standards. The larger Explorer was also a standout among the Blue Oval's SUVs, with overall sales (including both retail and fleet sales) up 15.9% from a year ago. The results bode well for Ford's first-quarter earnings report, expected later this month. Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to report a profit of $0.15 per share for the quarter, up from a loss of $0.23 per share in the first quarter of 2020.",0.9911

Slowly eliminating the UAW power to bargin . Parts [ the battery which is a sense is the heart of the car] will be made in seperate plants .At reasonable wages.This is going to allow Ford , GM to profit in a commodity business.
