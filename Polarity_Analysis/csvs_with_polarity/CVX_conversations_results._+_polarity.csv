The IRGC does not believe that, at this time, the U.S. will launch military action against Iran, unless it closes off the strategically vital oil chokepoint, the Strait of Hormuz.

538,"Reason Oil Will Continue to Run the World: ""83% of the World Has Just Started to Consume OilThe idea that the world has really just started to consume oil is one that is very difficult for some Westerners to accept. It's easy to see why: we have all the oil that we need and want. Americans consume over 2.6 gallons of oil products every day, and there are 255 million oil-based cars in the country. But, most of the world doesn't have it as easy as we do. A rising 83% of the world is undeveloped, and the transport demands for the poor are just now coming to light. The developed, OECD nations use 50% of the world's oil but are just 17% of the population. The rich consume 1.6 gallons of oil products a day, while the poor consume just 0.32 gallons. Given the importance of oil, this five-fold disadvantage for the poor is indeed a moral issue: oil-dependent Westerners are the ones leading the anti-oil charge. Our hypocrisy just isn't selling in the developing world, Mr. DiCaprio (a must read). Why would it? Poor people wanna be rich too. From 2010-2030, the poor nations are projected to add 800 million new registered vehicles.After vehicles, the second emerging oil market to watch could be jet fuel. Boeing affirms that commercial aircraft in the world will double to over 40,000 by 2032, with Asia-Pacific becoming the focal point of aviation. Jet fuel demand in the region has more than doubled to over 2 million b/d since 2000. A key reason why we have seen horrific crashes in Asia recently is demand surging faster than pilot training. Indeed, twinned with electricity, oil is the cornerstone of modernity where more demand indicates higher standards of living."" article by JUDE CLEMENTE",0.5998

544,"March 31, 2020Dear Stockholder,Normally this proxy statement comes to you in a new year amid market conditions that bear some resemblance to those of the prior year. Clearly that is not the case in 2020. We want to update you on how Chevron is responding to the unprecedented challenges the world is currently confronting.We recognize investors have concerns about the broad decline in equity markets globally, and the uncertainty and turbulence created by the global pandemic. In our industry this exogenous demand shock is exacerbated by an unanticipated supply surge, creating an abrupt imbalance and a sharp downturn in commodity prices. As chairman and lead director, we want to assure you that your Board of Directors is fully engaged, and the company is taking decisive actions in response to these dynamic market conditions.Your company is positioned to be resilient during these difficult times. Chevron entered this period of turbulence with a strong balance sheet, a low dividend break-even and a disciplined approach to managing capital and costs. We purposely built options into our plan to respond to unexpected conditions, and we’re activating these now.We are reducing our 2020 capital and exploratory spending guidance by 20 percent by deferring short cycle investments and pacing projects not yet under construction. To maintain balance sheet strength, we’ve suspended our share repurchase program and expect to complete assets sales signed last year. In addition, the company is taking action to deliver $1 billion in cost improvements by the end of 2020.These moves reflect our long-standing financial priorities and are focused on protecting the dividend, supporting the balance sheet, and prioritizing capital that drives long-term value for stockholders. Even in the face of the current headwinds, we intend to clearly demonstrate Chevron’s resilience to you, the stockholders whose investment supports everything we do.Sincerely, LOGO Michael K. WirthChairman and CEO",0.9452

On the global oil market, volumes are no longer the only factor of importance. It is quality and crude grades. These two factors are not being recognized, and it seems that traders and analysts believe Trump’s version of reality at present. OPEC’s spare production capacity is not sufficient, as Iran and Venezuelan heavy crudes are in short supply.The U.S. is not able to substitute any of this in the short-to-mid-term. When the market hits the brick wall at the end of this year, this quality problem, in combination with increased instability in the Middle East, will not only create a nightmare scenario for consumers but could also push crude oil above the current $70-85 per barrel range.

813,"JP Morgan Quant Expert predicts Secular Bull Market in oil companies driven by algorithm initiated short squeeze in March 2021JPM quant trading and valuation experts Marko Kolanovic predicts the next 12 years will be the most profitable era for oil investors in the past 100 years due to inflation, the weakening US Dollar (caused by stimulus), a booming stimulus-driven recovery, and under-investment in oil production caused by environmental concerns.The fundamentals will be compounded by automatic trading by algorithm driven super-fast traders called Quants. The market will begin automatically rebalancing out of short positions in mid-March due to the recent rise in energy company stocks, oil prices and excess liquidity.The best picks to cash in on this cycle are $OXY, $XOM, $CVX, $ET, $ERX & $XLE. The following is an excerpt from his article. Quants and Momentum InvestingIn a market where algos and trend-followers have emerged as one of the dominant price-setting forces, it is hardly a surprise that the JPM quant focuses on their influence as the driver behind a commodity supercycle. Indeed, he writes that after ""CTAs played significant role in the 2014 oil price downturn"" more recently, ""CTA funds have been adding Energy exposure. The reason is that 12-month momentum turned positive on Oil, and going forward signals will remain solidly positive."" And since vol-control funds are some of the dumbest money around and their actions can be anticipated well in advance, JPM notes that ""a further decline in volatility will likely result in larger and more stable cross-asset quant allocations. A larger momentum impact may affect Energy equities, which is the only sector that still has a strongly negative momentum signal and is hence heavily shorted in the context of factor investing."" That, JPMorgan believes, will ""change in mid-March, when the momentum signal for energy equities turns positive"" which may be a hint to the redditors out there: if you want to squeeze the systematic shorts, do it where it hurts and buy some energy stocks to crush the CTAs. You have about a month to do so because JPM's model momentum factor ""will need to rebalance in March by closing ~20% of its allocation to Energy equity shorts, and adding ~2% to energy longs, for a ~22% net buying in Energy.""What is the quantitative significance of these flows? Kolanovic calculates that if one roughly assumes that there is about ~$1Tr in equity long-short quant funds and that half of these funds are not sector neutralized, ""the flows could be quite significant, roughly $20-$30bn."" As shown in the chart below, the ratio of energy shares shorted vs all other S&P 500 shares shorted, closely followed the commodity supercycle. Remarkably, most recently the number of shares shorted for energy was 4 times the S&P 500 average (note that given the decline of the sector’s weight, energy share prices declined, and the effective $ amount shorted was only 2 times larger). In other words, one doesn't even need to squeeze the shorts: come March - absent some major new crisis - as a result of broader market technicals the prevailing shorts will close them out on their own and go long.Another ""flow factor"" behind the ""supercycle"" is rotation by discretionary funds and retail: In the period from 2010 to 2015, the Energy sector had a 10.6% allocation in conventional equity portfolios. Since then, this has declined to a 3.1% weight currently (Figure 4). The largest decline was in active allocations, which declined from 7% to 1.5% (while passive allocations decreased from 3.6% to 1.8%), which is understandable - investors dumped ""dead stocks"" to chase growth and momentum, but the tide is now turning, and ""any retracement of this decline, on a US equity fund asset base of ~$14T would result in significant inflows and re-pricing."" According to Kolanovic, as economies reopen, inflation moves higher, and yield curves steepen, active funds are expected to first close cyclical shorts, and then rotate from long secular growth towards value and cyclicals. His next point is critical: given that equity assets significantly increased over the last 10 years, and the energy sector significantly decreased, even a small rotation could produce an outsized move.",0.9834

The market has overreacted in our view, making energy stocks look cheap at current levels.In December, crude demand growth for 2020 was estimated at 1.25 million barrels per day (averaging forecasts from the EIA, IEA, and OPEC). That would have been a modest rebound from the prior year, but lower than the recent trend (demand growth averaged 1.6 mmbpd in 2016-18). Now, the same forecasters are calling for just 960,000 barrels per day growth in 2020, implying a 300 mbpd decrease due to the virus. But the full impact could be more severe. By comparing the recent outbreak with SARS (2003) Capital Economics has estimated a 400 mbpd impact, noting this is probably an underestimate because China’s economy is more globally integrated today. In addition, while the coronavirus appears to have a lower mortality rate than SARS, there have been far more infections and there is still the possibility of a full-blown pandemic. As such, it appears the likely effect on crude demand will be more substantial than what most forecasters are anticipating.However, there may be too much optimism on the supply side as well. Before the outbreak of the virus OPEC and its partners had already pledged to reduce output by 500 mbpd in the first quarter relative to the group’s previous ceiling. And while the latest figures do show a decrease of that magnitude in January, most of this came from Libya (where ongoing civil unrest is affecting production and transport). It is therefore much less likely that volumes will jump back up when the additional cuts are scheduled to expire on March 31. And it isn’t clear the group will let the cuts expire at all--the coronavirus could justify an extension, perhaps through the end of the year.",0.9828

By Teresa RivasGoldman Sachs takes a look at the oil majors ahead of second-quarter earnings, and the firm's advice is simple: Buy Chevron and ConocoPhillips stock, and sell Exxon Mobil. Why? It all comes down to cash.Analyst Neil Mehta updated his estimates for Chevron (ticker: CVX), ConocoPhillips (COP), and Exxon (XOM) on Wednesday, ahead of the energy giants' coming earnings reports, and warns that the results will reflect a challenging quarter. Companies are dealing with weaker pricing margins, and while lower production and cost-cutting efforts can offset that pressure to an extent, there could still be some pain evident in the numbers.Yet perhaps the most important metric to watch is free cash flow -- or the minimization of free cash burn -- as this will be key to the companies' debt profiles. ""We expect ConocoPhillips and Chevron could see net debt broadly unchanged at quarter-end, thanks to capital discipline and boosted by asset sales closed during the second quarter, while Exxon could see large debt builds,"" Mehta writes.That fact informs part of his bullish calls on ConocoPhillips and Chevron. He reiterated Buy ratings on both (ConocoPhillips is also on his Conviction Buy List), with price targets of $56 and $112, respectively, and notes that both look well leveraged to an oil recovery, whenever that may be.As for Exxon, Mehta has a Sell rating on the stock and lowered his price target by $2 to $42. He sees the ""shares as expensive on valuation, relative to U.S. majors, as well as see free-cash-flow generation and dividend coverage as challenged,"" and even with their year-to-date decline, he's too concerned about the near-term risks to its recovery to recommend it to bargain hunters.It isn't hard to see why Mehta and others are focused on cash: Energy companies had been struggling with low commodity prices for years, well before the pandemic, and now the threat of dividend cuts amid capital crunches may be driving some of the longest-suffering investors away from the stocks. (Shareholders certainly aren't there for big gains -- Exxon stock today essentially trades where it did in early 2004.)Oil prices have been making some strides recently, but investing in theenergy sector has remained quite difficult. Yet while Exxon and ConocoPhillips are each off about 35% year to date, Chevron stock has only fallen 26%, helped in part by its strong balance sheet, although some warn that's not enough to compensate for the industry's woes.Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com> Dow Jones Newswires",0.9358

There are multi signals that the uranium sector fundamentals are getting the attention from professional resources investors now.Some signals:""Soon we'll be sending private letters to many natural resource investment funds and groups, globally. Our letters, to new groups who might not be aware of the uranium supply debacle, will outline the broken status of the uranium business and the key points for them to perform their own work to see if we reach similair or differing conclusions. We'll offer each group networking opportunities and ways that we believe they can most effectively participate in recapitalizing a broken mining sector and supply chain"" Andrew Weekly, CEO SmithWeekly ResearchLarry McDonald on uranium:""I am also looking for financial players to get more serious about throwing weight around in this sector. A group with decent capital at a multi-strat HF or a medium sized fund could allocate a few hunderd mill and create their own reality in this sector, IMO. The order of operations would be to buy up positions in call option like U miners, then buy the U trusts trading at discounts and then hit the spot market hard. I think you would make money on all legs of that if you committed a few hunderd mill to it""==> An other investor spending a lot of time in macro and micro due dilligence work on this sector like me, ""intercepted"" a strategic chats a few weeks ago between professional traders of different financial institutions talking about preparing themself to come in action in the uranium sector. And like Larry McDonald saying to first buy the uranium company stocks and related financial instruments, second buying the U trusts (Uranium Participation, Yellow Cake) and then buying Uranium in the spotmarket (Professional investors with 3000000 million USD (100000lb x 30$/lb) on hand can buy physical uranium --> the minimum buying is 100000lb U3O8!)In the meantime the uranium etf's need to buy more underlying uranium company stocks and issue additional etf shares to keep up with the demand from investors ==> That's a big upward pressure on all those underlying uranium companies in which those etf's invest today and in the coming months (and couple of years).For instance:- ""Investors were piling into 100% Pure-Play ""North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF"" $URNM on NYSE yesterday, adding another 175,000 ETF shares - Now at 1,325,000 & AUM US$60.3M, over 20X higher than its US$3M inception just over a year ago""- ""Global X Uranium/Nuclear ETF $URA on NYSE added another 300,000 shares yesterday to bring their issued to 17.1M with US$276M in Net Assets - A 160% increase from its March low""Conclusion: A lot of money is coming into a very tiny sector to invest into. Multi-bagger moves higer coming.Be prepared and be patient.Don't try to swing trade uranium stocks.

1020,"Interesting news for the energy sector going forward.JP Morgan Quant Expert predicts Secular Bull Market in oil companies driven by algorithm initiated short squeeze in March 2021JPM quant trading and valuation experts Marko Kolanovic predicts the next 12 years will be the most profitable era for oil investors in the past 100 years due to inflation, the weakening US Dollar (caused by stimulus), a booming stimulus-driven recovery, and under-investment in oil production caused by environmental concerns.The fundamentals will be compounded by automatic trading by algorithm driven super-fast traders called Quants.The market will begin automatically rebalancing out of short positions in mid-March due to the recent rise in energy company stocks, oil prices and excess liquidity.The best picks to cash in on this cycle are $OXY, $XOM, $CVX, $ET, $ERX & $XLE.The following is an excerpt from his article.Quants and Momentum InvestingIn a market where algos and trend-followers have emerged as one of the dominant price-setting forces, it is hardly a surprise that the JPM quant focuses on their influence as the driver behind a commodity supercycle. Indeed, he writes that after ""CTAs played significant role in the 2014 oil price downturn"" more recently, ""CTA funds have been adding Energy exposure. The reason is that 12-month momentum turned positive on Oil, and going forward signals will remain solidly positive.""And since vol-control funds are some of the dumbest money around and their actions can be anticipated well in advance, JPM notes that ""a further decline in volatility will likely result in larger and more stable cross-asset quant allocations. A larger momentum impact may affect Energy equities, which is the only sector that still has a strongly negative momentum signal and is hence heavily shorted in the context of factor investing.""That, JPMorgan believes, will ""change in mid-March, when the momentum signal for energy equities turns positive"" which may be a hint to the redditors out there: if you want to squeeze the systematic shorts, do it where it hurts and buy some energy stocks to crush the CTAs. You have about a month to do so because JPM's model momentum factor ""will need to rebalance in March by closing ~20% of its allocation to Energy equity shorts, and adding ~2% to energy longs, for a ~22% net buying in Energy.""What is the quantitative significance of these flows? Kolanovic calculates that if one roughly assumes that there is about ~$1Tr in equity long-short quant funds and that half of these funds are not sector neutralized, ""the flows could be quite significant, roughly $20-$30bn."" As shown in the chart below, the ratio of energy shares shorted vs all other S&P 500 shares shorted, closely followed the commodity supercycle.Remarkably, most recently the number of shares shorted for energy was 4 times the S&P 500 average (note that given the decline of the sector’s weight, energy share prices declined, and the effective $ amount shorted was only 2 times larger). In other words, one doesn't even need to squeeze the shorts: come March - absent some major new crisis - as a result of broader market technicals the prevailing shorts will close them out on their own and go long.Another ""flow factor"" behind the ""supercycle"" is rotation by discretionary funds and retail: In the period from 2010 to 2015, the Energy sector had a 10.6% allocation in conventional equity portfolios. Since then, this has declined to a 3.1% weight currently (Figure 4). The largest decline was in active allocations, which declined from 7% to 1.5% (while passive allocations decreased from 3.6% to 1.8%), which is understandable - investors dumped ""dead stocks"" to chase growth and momentum, but the tide is now turning, and ""any retracement of this decline, on a US equity fund asset base of ~$14T would result in significant inflows and re-pricing.""According to Kolanovic, as economies reopen, inflation moves higher, and yield curves steepen, active funds are expected to first close cyclical shorts, and then rotate from long secular growth towards value and cyclicals. His next point is critical: given that equity assets significantly increased over the last 10 years, and the energy sector significantly decreased, even a small rotation could produce an outsized move.",0.9839

Which of the Big Two is “gassier?” In the U.S. it's no contest as Chevron’s production mix in the first quarter was 75% liquids to 25% dry gas and Exxon’s gas/oil mix was very close to 50/50. When we include international region, however XOM’s gas/oil mix drops to 44/56 and CVX’s increases to 33/66.So, Exxon has a greater exposure to natural gas, and is thus better positioned in the current environment. Obviously if one wanted pure natural gas exposure, one could buy stocks in companies that have a much higher proportion of gas as a percentage of total production, like Range Resources and Chesapeake.

They take over the joint venture chemical business. Capitalize on the midstream business and gives them the opportunity to sell any of the refinery segments that don’t align. The share price will move up for all stakeholders. Best time to do this is when interest rates are low and oil prices are on the rise.

1346,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday renewed a license allowing Chevron, the last U.S. operating energy company in Venezuela, to continue drilling in the country for another three months through Jan. 22.The license has been a subject of intense debate within the Trump administration as it pursues a campaign to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro. Its renewal represented a win by some in the administration, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who see keeping a U.S. company in Venezuela as an asset that could lead to a speedy recovery after any ouster of Maduro.Other Trump administration officials believe allowing Chevron to stay results in oil output that helps keep Maduro in power by allowing him to pay down debts. Several administration officials favor allowing the license to expire even after Trump’s hawkish former national security adviser John Bolton, who had been an opponent of the license, stepped down last month.Chevron executives “remain focused on our base business operations and supporting the more than 8,800 people who work with us and their families,” said spokesman Ray Fohr. The company is reviewing terms of the latest license.The renewal effectively adds no new restrictions, according to a review of past licenses.Chevron (CVX.N) has been in Venezuela for nearly 100 years and has about 300 direct employees there. Its joint ventures with state oil company PDVSA support about 8,800 people. The ventures produce the equivalent of about 200,000 barrels per day of oil, and Chevron’s stake in them recently averaged about 34,000 bpd, the company said.In January, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA in an effort to oust Maduro. But it issued Chevron a six-month license to operate, which has now been renewed for two three-month periods.Crude oil output in the OPEC nation has dropped from well over 2 million bpd in 2014 to just over 1 million bpd by the end of 2018, the result of lower prices and what critics say is years of underinvestment and mismanagement. Blackouts and U.S. sanctions have accelerated the collapse: The country now produces just 600,000 bpd.",0.8162

These were bonds and they we’re supposed to be safe.For those who say he’s making the same mistake by investing in $XOM $CVX & $OXY, I couldn’t disagree more.

It is extremely interesting to understanding the price movement in oil yesterday:$SU conversationShort data: March18 ,2021Today, Short sellers employed all of their tools in order to bring oil stocks and future contracts down.After failing to create a sell off in oil stocks ,they started to shorting April and May contacts for future oil.They brought WTI to 59$ from 64$.Biggest single drop since April2020.As you see in below data, compare to share price drop, the volume was extremely low.This volume does not match with share price drop.That was just a pure and irresponsible manipulation.Most media in the World censored this extraordinary event in capital market.We are talking about tens of Billions of $ contracts and options which they are trying to kill them, plus covering their short position with creating fake sell off(scaring shareholders).So far, we haven’t had sell off.Low volume.They prefer spent and burn few billion dollars and sell stocks at discount, but meanwhile save tens of billions of money in other side.Extreme and irresponsible manipulation which will have consequences in future of oil market ,especially in next OPEC+ meeting and their next policy.Explanation about below data:Vol: The total volume numbers of first hand shares which is coming into market for trading.It is different than total volume that you see in yahoo or elsewhere.Because in total volume one share can change many hands between traders.But original amount of coming shares and shorted shares are constant for day.For Canadian Stocks the volume is just for US market.SU : (Vol 2.326M shares), (Short 0.769M shares ), (33% of coming shares for trade)SU :XOM (Vol 12M ), (Short 5.715M ), (48% )CLR (Vol 1.129M ), (Short 0.703M ), (63% )CVX (Vol 3.363M ), (Short 1.784M ), (53% )OXY (Vol 8.277M ), (Short 5.32M ), (64% )CPG (Vol 0.693M ), (Short 0.314M ), (45% )CNQ (Vol 0.664M ), (Short 0.217M ), (33% )ENB (Vol 0.885M ), (Short 0.57M ), (64% )BP (Vol 3.458M ), (Short 1.265M ), (37% )CVE (Vol 1.543M ), (Short 0.978M ), (64% )CDEV (Vol 7.627M ), (Short 4.025M ), (53% )FANG (Vol 1.087M ), (Short 0.505M ), (47% )CPE (Vol 1.615M ), (Short 0.697M ), (43% )MRO (Vol 10.09M ), (Short 5.662M ), (56% )SLB (Vol 4.484M ), (Short 1.632M ), (36% )HAL (Vol 2.948M ), (Short 0.971M ), (33% )RIG (Vol 12.58M ), (Short 7.285M ), (58% )TOT (Vol 0.553M ), (Short 0.378M ), (68% )PXD (Vol 0.859M ), (Short 0.51M ), (60% )COP (Vol 2.865M ), (Short 0.808M ), (28% )BKR (Vol 1.79M ), (Short 0.659M ), (37% )LPI (Vol 0.417M ), (Short 0.181M ), (44% )PDS (Vol 0.054M ), (Short 0.02M ), (38% )#XOM, #CLR , #CVX , #OXY , #CPG , #CNQ , #ENB , #BP , #CVE , #CDEV , #FANG , #CPE, #MRO , #SLB, #HAL, #RIG , #TOT, #PXD , #COP, #BKR , #LPI , #PDS",0.987

2471,"Here’s what you need to do with your profits from $AMC and $GME. The market has taken on the false narrative that a virus caused the entire world’s infrastructure to change overnight to all solar and wind. This is simply a false narrative. There’s no doubt that the industrialized world will transition to green energy, but this will take a coordinated effort for the next 15 years.What do we do in the meantime? We change government policies to discourage oil and gas production. Part of this is to limit supply to drive up the price of gasoline and diesel fuel. This makes green alternative energy more tenable because it is cheap relative to oil and gas.In the US, the easy policies of the old administration actually hurt the oil and gas industry. They drilled and drilled until the US became the world leading exporter of oil and gas. Then COVID happened and world wide demand dropped by 8% - that’s right only 8%.So far in 2021, demand has recovered by 5%. As of right now, we are only using 3% less oil and gas than we were. Does that sound like a dead industry? Absolutely not.The meteoric stock price rise of solar companies and $TSLA is a bubble. The profits are not there.Now with oil at $53 and Nat Gas at $2.85 - oil companies are profitable.With oil and gas supply being limited by policy - we can expect oil to be $75 by 2022 and over $100 by 2023 - 2035. This is the last golden age of black gold. The last bull market of oil before the oil majors buyout the green energy companies with the treasure troves of cash they are going to generate over the next 15 years.So...take your profits and buy $OXY $XLE $XOM $CVX $ET & $GEL.
