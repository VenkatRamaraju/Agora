I've often compared Chuck Robbins with Satya Nadella. Has anyone forgotten how MSFT languished in the high 40's and low 50's for YEARS before Nadella? But he had SOFTWARE to work with, while Robbins has a much harder lift with HARDWARE. Software isn't nearly as costly to develop and you can sell it over and over and over for HUGE profits....Networks are expensive - very expensive - and carriers do NOT change their hardware more than absolutely necessary. So now CSCO is trying to implement changes using SAS, rather than selling new components containing new software. John Chambers had relatively little competition when he was CEO but now the list of Cisco's peers and rivals is long indeed. I know a lot of investors are frustrated with the stock - one even said that they haven't made acquisitions - seriously? I think Robbins is the right man for the job and I have faith that he will turn this company around one way or the other and get the stock price where it belongs. If you just look at the PE and compare it with some of the high fliers, the price should be three times what it is now, all things being equal.

1012,"Demtirds lie.President Joe Biden claimed on the campaign trail that he would not raise taxes on individuals making less than $400,000 annually, but his administration now admits that the number could actually be much lower with tax hikes on the horizon.A tax increase is coming for some individuals and for major corporations, just as was expected from Biden and Democrats. The federal government needs more funds to ramp up its planned spending, which includes another round of massive legislation. This opens up a big opportunity for the GOP, but we’ll get to that later.Bloomberg reported this week: “Unlike the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus act, the next initiative, which is expected to be even bigger, won’t rely just on government debt as a funding source. While it’s been increasingly clear that tax hikes will be a component — Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said at least part of the next bill will have to be paid for, and pointed to higher rates — key advisers are now making preparations for a package of measures that could include an increase in both the corporate tax rate and the individual rate for high earners.”",0.9778

He’s apparently on a flight back home to Texas right at this very moment.”“I’m sure there’s going to be a lot of media waiting, asking questions, but to, like, literally flee your home state while people are freezing to death, to go to Cancun is a very Marie Antoinette,” McCain added. “One of the worst optics I could come up with in an era where there’s been a lot of bad political optics.”",0.8977

The presence of those metals may cause discarded panels to exhibit the hazardous waste characteristic of toxicity, and thus be classified as hazardous waste under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and California’s more stringent Hazardous Waste Control Law. This classification makes it expensive and burdensome to store, handle and transport end-of-life panels for recycling or disposal under current regulations.Starting on January 1, 2021, decommissioned solar panels will be regulated like other universal wastes in California, which include batteries, electronic devices, mercury-containing equipment, lamps, cathode ray tubes, and aerosol cans. The new rule will make it less expensive and burdensome to collect, process and recycle them.-------------------------------------------------------------------read on.....The pro-solar website EnergySage writes: There are some chemicals used in the manufacturing process to prepare silicon and make the wafers for monocrystalline and polycrystalline panels. One of the most toxic chemicals created as a byproduct of this process is silicon tetrachloride. This chemical, if not handled and disposed of properly, can lead to burns on your skin, harmful air pollutants that increase lung disease, and if exposed to water can release hydrochloric acid, which is a corrosive substance bad for human and environmental health.------------------------------------------enjoy.....you SnowRooms are walking into a nightmare.....you just don't know it...",-0.8444
