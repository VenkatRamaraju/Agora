With an auto producer that PE could be extended to cars produced. For example, Toyota produced 8.8 million cars last year to achieve earnings. Their PE is 9.21. This indicates that Toyota needs to produce 8.8 million cars times 9.21 years of earnings to meet market cap. This total is 81,480,000 vehicles.Tesla produced 500,000 cars last year. Their PE is 1,628 and this is not a fully diluted PE. Multiply the two and the total is 814 million cars. Fully diluted and this number nears 900 million. There is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years. World auto production in 2019 was 91,786,861. Tesla, at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits, would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a PE similar to Toyota.

57,"It’s been a great run and I’ve been a Tesla bull for a while, but I’m selling now because I don’t see how long this can go on for.I held on for a long time when virtually every analyst was screaming sell. There was just something about the stock that told me “no, hold on”.I already made 6-700%+ and that is very hard to ignore, plus with so many other players nipping at their heels I think it’s time to liquidate at least partially and spread the bet. I bought some at 240 way before the stock split so I’m quite happy.It’s mad that the split stock is now trading near pre split price. That doesn’t make sense to me given the underlying value in the company. To justify the valuation they would have to hit no hiccups at all in the next decade. I think there has to be a pop at some point and it may be a good point to sell, wait then buy back in. I already did that a couple of months back over a dip and made a bit of extra cheddar.I may of course really regret it and miss out on more. Could be wrong and good luck to all of you that have held on for the ride and done well. It’s a crazy stock that often defies logic so I’m past trying to understand it.

61,"So who's paying for the replacement of 135,000 recalls?""Tesla says its faulty touchscreens that led to a recall were only built to last 5-6 yearsTesla agreed to recall more than 134,000 of its cars over faulty touchscreens this week.US regulators said the failing displays could affect essential components like the rear-view camera.Tesla agreed to the recall, and said its screens shouldn't be expected to last more than 5-6 years.Visit the Business section of Insider for more stories.Tesla agreed this week to recall more than 134,000 vehicles with flash memory units that may wear out unexpectedly, rendering the cars' touchscreens useless in some cases, but it didn't go down without a fight.In a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration made public on Tuesday, Elon Musk's electric automaker claimed its screens weren't failing prematurely - they were just designed that way.Tesla's legal chief, Al Prescott, pushed back against the regulator's definition of a ""defect,"" arguing that the eMMC memory devices in question were only built to last five to six years. He said that lifespan is standard for infotainment systems in the industry.""While the wear rate is heavily influenced by the active use of the center display system, even more so when the vehicle is in drive or charging, given a reasonable average daily use of 1.4 cycles, the expected life would be 5-6 years,"" Prescott said.

71,"Tesla Recall Email (Full Text):""In order to ensure your safety, Tesla will proactively retrofit a power steering component in all Model S vehicles built before April 2016. (No other Tesla vehicles are affected.) There have been no injuries or accidents due to this component, despite accumulating more than a billion miles of driving.To be clear, this recall does not apply to any Model X or Model 3 vehicles, only to Model S vehicles built before April 2016.We have observed excessive corrosion in the power steering bolts, though only in very cold climates, particularly those that frequently use calcium or magnesium road salts, rather than sodium chloride (table salt). Nonetheless, Tesla plans to replace all early Model S power steering bolts in all climates worldwide to account for the possibility that the vehicle may later be used in a highly corrosive environment.If the bolts fail, the driver is still able to steer the car, but increased force is required due to loss or reduction of power assist. This primarily makes the car harder to drive at low speeds and for parallel parking, but does not materially affect control at high speed, where only small steering wheel force is needed.Our records show that you own a Model S affected by this voluntary recall. At this time there is no immediate action you need to take and you may continue to drive your Model S. Tesla will contact you to schedule an appointment when parts are available in your region. The retrofit will typically take around an hour.Thank you for being a Tesla customer, and we apologize for this inconvenience. If you have any questions, please contact us by phone at 844-248-3752 or by email at ServiceHelpNA@tesla.com.""Commentary: We know the recall involves replacing 3 bolts. The cost will be ~ $1/car. They say the recall takes an hour. In reality that is 30 minutes of a repair tech's time ($25) and 30 minutes of useless waiting around while they wash your car and give you coffee. ($10). (all numbers pulled out of my tush, but you get the idea) $36/car * 123k cars = $4.4M for the whole affair. If the bolts didn't meet Tesla's spec much of that will be eaten by the vendor. Either way, its not a material expense.",0.6649

78,"""So tired of hearing the “Tesla isn’t profitable without emission credits” baloney. Capex was over 3 billion in 2020. Emission credits a few hundred million per quarter. What that means is if Tesla would stop pouring money into building the most efficient factories in the world they’d be wildly profitable now."" ~ juanMYGAWD so tired of seeing clueless cult members post cluelsss nonsense. A. Every car maker has capex. If what you say were true, all other car makers would have several fold higher profits than they report. tesla is nothing special in that regard.But unfortunately for you morons,...B. New capex is not expensed. For you clueless cult members, that means the $3 billion spent on capex in 2020 is not deducted from revenues on the income statement, so it has little immediate bearing on tesla's bottom line.Capital expenditures like equipment and new plants are put on the balance sheet and depreciated over years. For you clueless cult members, that means only a small fraction is deducted on the income statement. Depending on the asset and current tax rules (like during pandemics when the government might encourage capex or not) it may take 5 to 39 years to deduct the cap ex.If you look at tesla's cash flow statement in the Q3 10Q it shows about $1.7 billion in depreciation over the 9 months. That's an accumulaiton of deductions over its entire life of buying assets. For the qtr that would be depreciation of about $500 million.Ford shows over $7 billion for the first 9 months or $2.33 billion per qtr. If it didn't dedect this, it would have reported earnings of $5 billion for the qtr. or $20 billion per year with a PE like tesla has, it should have a market cap of 1400 x $20 billion or $28 trillion.What tesla's cash flow statment also says is, were it not for tesla issuing $10's of billions in stock because it makes no profits, it would be close to insolvent.",0.9775

118,"Reminder - Bailie Gifford & Co is one the largest shareholders in $TSLA . The fund is the largest shareholder of $NIO and started their position in 2018. Here’s why they believe $NIO could reach a valuation of $300 billion: What it does:NIO designs and jointly manufactures smart, high performance, premium connected electric vehicles. Why we own it:- An emerging, uniquely Chinese brand champion that aspires to completely reimagine the experience of car ownership and shape a community of 'joyful users' with premium member services offered through NIO House and NIO Life.- A vast market opportunity, China accounts for 60% of incremental EV sales globally with huge pent-up demand given the chances of citizens obtaining a licence plate for a non-EV in e.g. Beijing are 1-in-800. Nor is the market limited to China.- An aspiring founder who naturally thinks in a long time frame and invests personally in his distinctive vision.- An attractive business model. THere is considerable space capacity in the Chinese automotive industry and NIO is happy to outsource the manufacture of its product to high-quality partners while retaining control of key intellectual property. How it could be worth many times more:- Over ten years, 1m premium vehicles a year (RMB400bn), licencing IP to a further 1m (at least RMB40bn) and an affluent community of 5-10m embrace.- NIO Life ancillary offerings (clothing, clubhouses, entertainment) at RMB30k each p.a. (RMB200bn+).- Margins are 2x traditional premium vehicles (20%) giving a post-tax cash flow of ~100bn RMB and valuation of $300bn Short 10 Questions: 1.) Can sales double in the next five years?Just the fothills. Progress toward 0.5m cars per year and approaching 1m members cumulatively. 2.) Ten years and beyond?Mass-market IP licencing, premium memberships, autonomy. Joint ventures with Changan and GAC capable of 2m cars per year (1/3rd of market)? Level 4 autonomy to be commonplace in China before the West? 3.) Competitive advantage?Deep connection with its member community. Aspiration brand and lifestyle choices. Technology. 4.) Is the business culture different?Yes. Bringing joy to customers through design, value, community, exceeding expectations, honesty. 5.) Customers like you? Contribute to society?So far, emphatically yes. Demand has been greater (and broader) than even the company expected. 6.) Are returns worthwhile?Not at the moment. Still investing heavily behind the vision. 7.) Will they rise or fall?If NIO becomes primarily an IP licensor with low manufacturing investment, returns could rise steeply. 8.) How is capital allocated?Technology (Primarily software), R&D and expanding the NIO House network. 9.) Could it be worth 5x as much?100m affluent customers by 2020. Car ownership per capita 3x lower than most developed economies. 10.) WHAT DOESN'T THE MARKET UNDERSTAND?Lazy anologies to Tesla (the visions differ) combined with fearfulness at the short-term capital needs.",0.9984

225,"There has been a lot of hope and hype about growth for Tesla, but I suspect that a lot of it is misplaced. We now know that almost their entire growth last year was around China. Their sales in Europe were down for the year, and outside of China, any growth was modest or a result of entering a new market.The problem is that much of that growth has been (continually) at the expense of reputation, with consumers and regulatory bodies. The quality of their cars has come into question in Europe (see Netherlands taxi cab story), In the US (see stories about recalls in US) and now China (see stories about Tesla risks wearing out welcome in China). Now there are even reports that highlight the (long known) fact that Tesla has been hyping their range. Now there is serious competition and it is growing rapidly just as the 'wow' factor for Tesla is wearing off. What will be interesting to watch is when the same 'wow' factor wears off on the share price. Of course a move from $900 to $800 isn't really a sign of that yet, but a break down to $600 or $500 would be a pretty serious outcome.The lack of profits and declining margins on growing sales was a warning shot. When sales start to stabilize and profits still don't show up, well, investors may take notice. (And when I say investors, I don't mean day traders and swing traders. I mean investors who are buying into the idea that Tesla has some sort of magic battery or secret cool factor.These things only last so long . . . In Europe's top markets, Tesla had 10% share last quarter, and while the data for this quarter is way, way too early, Tesla currently makes up just 2.5% of the market. No one company has to be better than Tesla when 9 out of every 10 EVs is sold by other companies.

308,"To show how overvalued Tesla is (and yes they are a great company with a visionary leader) let’s compare this to the biggest company in the world, Apple (who also had a visionary leader in Steve Jobs). In 07, Apple released their first touchscreen iPhone. They climbed to a market cap of 175B, while making close to 35B in revenue. Their P/E ratio at that time was less than 40 and they were trading around 6x sales. Fast forward to 9/2012, Apple reached a market cap of 650B (after 5 whole years and before crashing down to 365B) while making 156B in revenue with a p/e of about 12. In comparison, Tesla is expected to close out this year on 31B of revenue, while it has a market cap of close to 850B, trading close to 30x sales and has a p/e close to 1700!! This makes Tesla 5x (500%) more overvalued than what the biggest company in the world was when they released their most innovative product. Then, everything else that’s going on with the economy. People losing their jobs (unemployment at historic highs), small businesses closing left and right and last week they were expecting 70k jobs to get added to payroll, but instead 120k jobs were reduced. I get the market is forward looking but it must be looking 2+ years ahead these days and for Tesla, 5+ years ahead. Yes this will likely be a 1T+ company and bigger down the road, but with 100% certainty, they are wayyyy too ahead of their time. A crash is certain (for the whole market) but who knows when. I’ll stay on the sidelines in the meanwhile. The only thing driving this crazy market (especially this stock) is fear of inflation, FOMO and stimulus (not fundamentals). Just look at all of FAANG stocks and compare historic P/E ratios to this year. I see some people saying p/e is something created from way back when, well news for you, it’s not going away and reality is going to hit sooner than later.",0.6796

334,"The inventory issue will be the final nail in the financial coffin. Let’s examine the 114 X/S sitting in inventory in Canada. Right now they are Finished Goods on the Tesla Balance Sheet as at end of Q3.., now, it is highly probable that Tesla will have to offer significant discounts to move that inventory.Remember, this is a company desperate to raise cash due to pending debt obligations. Having a $130k cdn car ( $100k Usd) sitting in some parking lot in Canada does nothing to raise cash. Rather, they drop the price through discounts to monetize the car and raise cash, but take a loss on the car ( Hurts GAAP earnings)The Balance Sheet is overstated... the inventory is too high and only way to move cars quickly is to incent people. Tax credits are gone ( Ontario) or are dropping off quickly due to Tesla hitting 200K mark for US tax credits.., a perfect storm against Tesla profits.I would really appreciate others on this thread going out to their local Tesla store, look at Model 3 and S/X inventory available through the sales reps Tesla system ( just say you want a car within 2 weeks or so.. they’ll show you inventory)Also, I plan to keep watching for the first October production Model 3 to land in Toronto. Then, by asking enough customers when they ordered the Model 3, we can get a sense of whether Tesla is still filling backlog, or now filling very short term orders.Once I see only September or October orders being delivered, I know backlog is exhausted, then, by counting new deliveries per week we get a good sense of ongoing Model 3 demand. My intuition and the fact there are 33 inventory Model 3s in Toronto available for sale ( I could have one in 5 business days if I found one that I liked the combo of FWD/AWD, colour and wheels, I could have it by next Friday! ). That means either:1. Previous customers have walked away from their orders ( probably due to loss of Ontario tax credits)2. Tesla is keeping production numbers > actual demand and building inventory.., most people look at weekly production numbers and ASSUME that means that is equal to actual demand... what if Tesla now building cars in excess of actual orders ( like most car companies do).., big difference is Tesla does not have financial strength to play the inventory holding game!!!! Anyway, Canada and Toronto does not tell the whole picture. Dallas was a partial corroboration of my findings. If others can gather info from their local Tesla store ( take an hour or two o time), a bigger picture will emerge.I am a short via Puts. But I gather real data to confirm or refute my thesis.

And I just would like to share with you some of my reflections because it is related to you ladies/gentlemen who is shorting TSLA. I punderstand why you are upset after such a record year in all fronts for TSLA, a record breaking business results, stock at all time high, stock price x7 in one year, largest shorting loss ever. Please understand, we long term investors have not done anything intentional to make you upset. We have invested in a good stock, and it's been good to us, and we just try our best to defend the stock we own with what we consider as fake new and stories.I have heard all kinds of name calling toward me: cult members, greedy, immoral, fat pig get slaughtered...etc. Let me tell you something, It just won't work. As I have said over and over again, I am so much in the money I have enough capital strength to ride out the peak and valley. Why don't you guys stop trying to save me from myself. I would really appreciate it.Have a great happy new year! Instead of spending all days and nights bashing TSLA and its shareholders, why don't you spend some quality time with your family, relax, get some exercise, eat well, walk your dog so he/she does not feel neglected, and contribute to our GDP in a positive manner.Last but not least, do not bet against TSLA. As the previous shorting efforts have resulted in record loss which I will not reiterate here.",0.9864

356,"Congrats to all the Tesla stock owners who have gotten rich off the stock. Sadly I was way too late to the game. To those future owners who are going to get destroyed when this stock collapses, I offer my condolences to you ahead of time. Everyone one of you knows that you can not make a rational, logical reason why Tesla should be above $300. Even $200 is stretching it. Though Tesla is the main game in town if you want an EV today, in 5 years that will not be the case. Consumers will have dozens and dozens of alternative models from Europe, Asia, and the US to choose from that fit their tastes. Even if Tesla remains the number 1 brand for EV, the odds of it taking more than even 20% of the market share is small. So ride the wave up but be careful. I admit these levels make me too scared even to entertain buying Tesla. Sure it might go up $1000 more in the next 6 months. The house could collapse in a few months down to $400.

The electrical distribution system was not designed for this and it hasn’t been a problem so far. The transformers and wires were sized using something called a “diversity factor” - an assumption that not everyone would be using full power at the same time. Go take a look outside your house if you live in a city/subdivision and have an overhead power line supplying your street. If the secondary (low voltage) wires are the size of an extension cord and there is a 50kVA transformer feeding 10+ houses, then the infrastructure is not sufficient to support widespread EV use at your local level.

To balance their losses, they have had to close their long time positions like those ones on Tesla, bringing down the price. But this is only a drop in the ocean. Tesla is strong and will only need a few hours, if not days to climb back up, and remain even tougher than before. ""Deceiving"" earnings won't bring it down, Tesla is still a leader, has massive market shares in batteries, and, because no one is talking about it, just introduced the new model S and X. Those new cars are not only better looking (inside and outside), they also have longer range (from 628km to 840km autonomy for the higher version), a top speed of 320km/h for the Model S Plaid +, and 0-100 in just 2.1 seconds.

And unlike previous years, there has been no letting him off the hook to deflect away from delivering on the M3.

713,"Tesla’s share of the critical European battery-electric-vehicle market crumbled in the first month of 2021, and China has taken the top spot from Europe in the EV race, according to new research.Tesla’s trajectory in Europe is in decline. The U.S. car maker delivered 1,619 battery-electric vehicles to 18 key European markets in January, representing 3.5% of all battery-electric vehicles registered that month, according to a report based on public data by automotive analyst Matthias Schmidt. In 2020, Tesla delivered 1,977 vehicles in January — more than a 5% market share.Schmidt called Tesla’s January performance “consistently low,” noting that the company’s European delivery schedule sees volumes peak at the end of each quarter. However, the analyst noted that Tesla’s 12-month rolling volumes have now fallen behind Hyundai and Kia, which are now the third-most popular EV group in Europe.The tide turned for Tesla in 2020, with Tesla dropping behind both the brands of Volkswagen Group and the alliance between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi.Last year, Tesla made up just 13% of the European market despite a smaller proportional decline in the number of vehicles it delivered — around 10%.More broadly in January, China raced past Europe to reclaim its crown as the world’s largest market for electric vehicles. There were 179,000 battery-electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles registered in China in January, compared with 110,000 in Europe. The boost in China comes after a standout year for Europe. There were 1.33 million electric-vehicle registrations in Europe in 2020, topping 1.25 million in China, amid a pedal-to-the-metal push to increase EV adoption from European governments and supercharged demand from consumers.China is home to a strong domestic electric-vehicle sector, including manufacturers Nio, Xpeng and BYD.Schmidt’s report shows that Volkswagen Group, which manufactures VW, Audi, Skoda, Seat, and Porsche, remains the most popular battery-electric vehicle group in Europe, with more than 22% of the market share after delivering 10,193 vehicles.It is closely followed by Stellantis , a group formed earlier this year through the merger of PSA — which included Peugeot and Citroën — and Fiat Chrysler. Stellantis delivered 9,005 vehicles.Behind Stellantis is Hyundai and Kia, increasingly popular in Europe, which delivered more than 7,087 vehicles. That puts the Korean group ahead of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, which delivered 6,018 cars, though Renault’s Zoe remained the most popular battery-electric vehicle in Europe in January.Then comes Mercedes-owner Daimler, BMW, and Volvo, which all delivered more battery-electric vehicles than Tesla in the first month of the year.Germany remained the single largest market within Europe for electric vehicles. The 16,315 battery-electric vehicles registered in the country in January were more than the totals of the next-two largest markets, France and the U.K., combined.",0.9698

738,"Lots of NIO shareholders come to $LI and $XPEV trying to convince people to sell LI and XPEV and buy NIO as if the entire market use yahoo commenting system.But let's get past the hype that seems to blow NIO shareholders minds. NIO in the presentation said that they'll use Nvidia's chip and another company's battery to make their cars even better than Tesla's cars. They avoided saying who created the battery but the battery company is Qing Tao and was confirmed at Qing Tao. At first glance it sounds great. But adopting Nvidia's chip and another manufacturer's battery means that NIO didn't produce any of these tech in-house and have no way to prevent every EV company out there from also adopting Nvidia's chip and Qing Tao's battery.Another concern is Qing Tao, up to this point, has not been able to declare that their battery works on vehicle yet. One analyst quote, ""Chinese startup Qing Tao Energy Development says it’s created the first solid-state battery production line in China, with one big caveat: Its batteries don’t work with electric vehicles (yet).""Another analyst quoted, ""Right now, they are using the batteries for “special equipment and high-end digital products”, but Nan says that they are talking to “a number of large automobile manufacturers” about using their solid-state batteries in electric vehicles.""One analyst went on to comment about the presentation, ""In this statement, NIO’s CEO William Li, didn’t choose his words carefully, he didn’t say NIO is making.. but rather NIO adopts.. This definitely indicates that NIO is simply buying the battery from a supplier (likely CATL), rather than making their own. If this is true, then the timeline of Q4 2022 for delivery of the first Solid State Battery in a car, will be heavily exposed to delays by the 3rd party.""This presentation from NIO day is a great bullish news for Nvidia. Not so much for Nio. As for other company Qing Tao, well they might never be able to release their product at all 2 years from now. Remember $QS said that they had a breakthrough and they can't release their product until 2024 at the earliest? It's not easy, and I would pick QuantumScape over Qing Tao any day.I understand NIO shareholders want to think NIO is the next $TSLA, but let's be clear. NIO is no TSLA. Not even close. TLSA would create its own chip and its own battery. That's how it prevents other EV companies from also using them.",0.9989

925,"Many try to diminish the importance of Norway's sales data, but I think that is a mistake. Here are some data and insights.Norway has about 5.3MM people in totalThey have about 2.8MM passenger cars registered.To date Norwegians have purchased about 372,041 EVs (about 13%)This makes Norway, the biggest adopter of EVs in the world. There is a strong argument to be made that this little country is a useful model for what might happen in other countries as EVs are adopted competition increases.To date, Tesla has sold 58,915 of all EVs sold including:111 Roadsters13,829 Model X21,120 Model S23,855 Model 3Its worth noting that the bulk of sales happened before there was any significant competition. If you take out the Model S/X sales, Tesla's sales are mediocre at best, and in the last two years, they sold less than 2,000 model S in Norway and 3,000 Model X. Put another way, now that there is choice, those vehicles don't make the grade for the vast majority of buyers. (As an aside Porsche sold 1,200 Taycan's just last year at almost double the price!)Tesla has 15.8% of the EVs sold in the country over that three year period.Now you can massage the numbers anyway you want, but here are some conclusions from my analysis you can look at EU-EVs to see some nice graphs:1. The number of competitors has jump significantly. In 2018, six auto groups represented over 95% of sales. In Q4 2020, those same six groups represented just 80%. Renault was the largest in Q1 2018 at 40%, now it is VW by a large margin at 29.2%, Tesla maxed out at 29% in Q1 2019, they are currently (Q4 2020) at 16.3%2. Nissan and Tesla were both beneficiaries of early adoption. Now the field is spread very widely in a 'normal' market where there is competition and Tesla has moved to third place in marketshare in Norway in 2020 behind VW, Hyundai and Renault/Nissan. VW is the only company to show dominance.3. The idea of domination is probably passed. Tesla can claim such a thing in the USA, VW can in Europe but other than that, there is broad adoption or such small numbers as to be a misnomer. In Norway, VW brands clearly dominate having gone from 16%, 25% and now 30% marketshare over the past three years. Tesla went from 18% to 30% to 11%. 4. Finally there are a lot of arguments about capacity and those have yet to be borne out for any manufacturer in any meaningful way. Competition is ramping up everywhere, and all suppliers appear to be constrained by supply. That data will become clearer this year and next when substantially more production comes online.Overall though the reason that Norway is important is because it is a small window into the future of EV sales and competitive markets.You can ignore it. You can misrepresent it, you can acknowledge it, but it is still happening and it isn't favorable for Tesla.Guru.",0.9959

After the latest fundraising, SpaceX is valued at $74 billion, according to CNBC.The latest raise values SpaceX 60% higher compared with the previous round in August when it raised nearly $2 billion at a valuation of $46 billion.Why It Matters: Notably, the funds were raised just one cent shy of $420, an infamous figure that caused plenty of trouble for Musk in 2018. In December, it was reported that SpaceX was seeking a valuation of $92 billion in a new funding round.The company plans to send four space tourists to orbit Earth on “the world’s first all-civilian mission” during the fourth quarter this year.Related Link: Elon Musk Unintentionally Sends 'Marscoin' Cryptocurrency Soaring 1,800% With A Tweet",0.9797

1288,"Latest prices of Tesla $TSLA Nio $NIO Xpeng $XPEV and Li Auto $LI Tesla has slashed prices of its made-in-China Model Y cars to woo drivers in the world’s largest electric vehicle market, ratcheting up pressure on its global and Chinese rivals that focus on the premium segment.The Long Range version of Model Y starts from 339,000 yuan (US$52,074), excluding a government subsidy, 30 per cent cheaper than the price quoted six months ago when presale orders could first be placed.- Xpeng Motor’s P7 all-electric sedan, start from 229,900 yuan after government subsidies. - Li Auto’s ONE SUV sells for 328,000 yuan, - NIO’s ES6 SUV starts at 346,600 yuan. Prices are several notches higher for foreign marques, - Mercedes-Benz EQC going at 499,800 yuan- BMW’s iX3 retails for 469,900 yuan.I think the biggest competition to Telsa, Xpeng, Nio and Li Auto is the PRC traditional auto manufactures as BAIC, SAIC, Geely and BYD for example. I am personally and professionally bullish about the PRC EV market and think 8 - 10 companies will dominate like Telsa, Nio, Xpeng, Li, WM, BAIC, SAIC, Geely and BYD and then there will be least expensive (but not that profitable) and the top end luxury foreign JVs like Mercedes, VW doing well too to make up about 12-15 companies leading EV in PRC.For Nio, Xpeng, Li and WM, they will continue to do very well and have significant upside both in business and stock valuations.",0.9768

You don't slash prices, lay off employees on 3 separate occasions, close stores, and move cars to Europe where you have lower margins if there is demand in North America. Tesla barely made a profit last quarter selling 90,000 cars. Imagine how bad Tesla will miss making a profit moving these lower margin models overseas were transportation costs and other costs will be much higher than in the US. Model 3 has cannibalized Model S and X sales and pre-orders for Model Y are under 12k hence the reason the ""expensive"" referral program is back. Musk has mortgaged his properties and his plane for personal liquidity. This is just another stock pump and his all-in moment. Tesla will lose 100's of millions of dollars and his only hope is deliveries will hide the fact that all demand has been pulled forward and Tesla cannot produce enough cars at high enough margins to survive.

1304,"Not much upside and 80-90% chance that top hit at 880$. IBD advised that 6/7 indicators showed that Tesla is reaching a climax run. After a climax run, comes a BIG pullback.P/E ratio- all time highP/S ratio- all time highRSI- off by one point from 2013 all time highTesla expected to make 31B in revenue but has a 800B market cap!! If anyone can find any other stock that has ever done this in the history of stocks (tech, auto, whatever) please give me the name. Apple disrupted the cell phone market when they developed the first touch screen iPhone (35B in revenue at the time - 175B market cap), Amazon disrupting brick and mortar business (amongst all other things)(had a 3600 p/e at one point but were making 55-60B in revenue and had a ~150B market cap), Google- I’m sure you’ve heard of them (highest p/e they ever had was around mid 50s), Netflix disrupting streaming business (traded at a about 450 P/E at their highest, while making close to 4B in revenue and had a 45B market cap- highest PS ratio of about 12). So just compare Tesla to any other major tech company and you’ll see the insane overvaluation here (even though as it stands Tesla makes most of their money from selling cars!). Up close to 900% since March. People need to get a close look and see that numbers like that can only be compared to .com bubble. Welcome to the EV bubble. You have companies like NKLA with no revenue valued close to 10B. There’s a new EV company every other day and competition is EVERYWHERE. Tesla could sit at this price for the next 3-5 (or more) years and still be grossly overvalued.Reality is Tesla is expected to make 31B this year, 45B next year and 65B in 2023. With this growth, fair value they should be around 300-400B market cap and that’s still being very generous. Don’t worry, there was plenty of blind FOMO buyers in the .com bubble as well. They would speak the same language as the pumpers here. Keep in mind that it took investors 10-15 years to make their money back (and that’s if they invested in amazon). Looks like history will repeat itself. This coming earnings report should do the job! Y’all better hope they smash expectations by at least 100%! Since they barely met 2020 delivery expectations, I expect a modest beat at best, then let the massive selling begin (sell the news)!Leaving off with this. On 12/3 Musk stated to his employees that Tesla needs “to cut costs or the firm's stock price could be “crushed like a soufflé under a sledgehammer.” - that was around 550$ SP.

Rising interest rates are a positive as they indicate investors are fleeing bonds and buying stocks. I like $NNDM and $TSLA. NNDM because it has patent protection and therefore 0 competition. I wonder if NNDM will go into the new ARK space fund? It is required for making guidance systems. The recent direct offering at $12.80 is also a floor. Whoever bought that offering will also be buying in the open market below $12.80. I also like TSLA, but at $500, not $750. However the 200 dma is $450 and rising quickly, so I may be too pessimistic. I like TSLA because their competition is ICE manufactures, not other BEVs. There is a shortage of batteries. TSLA is also the leader in self driving. Self driving is all about data collection and artificial intelligence. TSLA collects 100 times more data than their nearest competitor.

That would be truly impressive, especially after 2023 with all the competition from other car manufacturers. If share count doesn't change, that would suggest GAAP earnings in 2026 of $8/share. Again, that would be very impressive growth of 11 times 2020 earnings.That would put TSLA's earnings just about where GM's are expected to be in 2026 (which is only about 25% more than expected 2021 GM earnings). Yet, TSLA is trading at 15 the times of the price of GM.BTW, I am long GM. I ""expect"" that if GM performs as I project, it will be worth as much as $100/share in 2026. But, I wouldn't be willing to pay $100 per share for GM NOW.Can you see the problem we have with this? Yes, growth is good. 6 years of 50% per year would be possible only in the absence of any sort of significant competition. Maybe it's possible for 6 years. I think it's highly unlikely. But even then, with TSLA selling over 5 million cars per year at current vehicle prices, it would have to grow more than 10 times from that to justify the current stock price. (More likely it would have to sell more than 10 million per year if it is selling a $25k vehicle).This just doesn't seem like an expectation that a reasonable man could have. It's as if you have concluded that Elon Musk can walk on water (not frozen) and therefore TSLA is worth $1000/share, $5000/share, $15,000 per share or whatever.It just doesn't make any sense.",0.9934

In 1924 the State of California learned that Abner had helped to sell stock illegally in a desperate bid to raise money for the company, and though Abner was eventually acquitted on a technicality, the company folded during the ensuing legal struggle.For all their innovations, Doble [change name to Tesla] cars were hindered by two significant problems. The first was the price: the chassis alone sold for $9500, and adding a body virtually doubled that figure, making the car a luxury item in the 1920s. In 1922 the brothers had begun work on a lower cost model, projected to sell for less than $2000. This was named the Simplex, and was to be powered by four uniflow single-acting cylinders. One prototype is known to have been constructed, but the car never approached production stage. The other problem was Abner Doble himself, who was said to be such a perfectionist that he was seldom willing to stop tinkering and actually release an automobile for sale. http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a6228/jay-leno-and-his-doble-steam-cars/",0.8339

1694,"I'd love to share some thoughts on TSLA as I'm a money manager and a long time trader (yes both buy and sell) of the stock. Im not going to offer advice just give some clarity b/c as always it seems this message board is all over the place.Today's drop in share price is NOTHING to be concerned about. The security (TSLA) is acting just as anyone who is knowledgable would tell you. It had a TREMENDOUS run up over the past couple of weeks and some (not anywhere near all) people who held onto this are taking gains. This does NOT mean this is the beginning of the apocalypse and anyone who is reading that should be warned it's probably shorts who are littering this board. Yes, NIO is very attractive and will continue to grow. But TSLA is not just about selling cars as many of those EV companies are. They also rake profits on a SaaS platform whereby anyone using their open source for their batteries and internal displays need to utilize. So, essentially in many cases the more EV cars on the road, the better it is for TSLA.As for news....if you don't think there is anyone BIG news upcoming then you just don't know TSLA. I have had the opportunity to speak with Elon Musk in the past and in that ONE conversation he said that he prides himself on being able to move the stock price through a series of ""events"", some of which have been tweets obviously. Well, in about a week or so, you will be getting the ""deliveries"" for 2020 which will be announced BEFORE earnings report, which is due at the end of January. I'm 99% certain they blow past the 500K benchmark set forth and this will take the share price close to if not exceeding $700. Of course, weeks later, there is the Earnings Report which, if some other posters talking about option activity sinking the share price, will end up being a catalyst soon thereafter.All this to say stick to your guns with TSLA. If you're NOT a trader, then don't try to do it. Shorts have lost an exorbitant amount of money and if you think truly that the S&P is going to ""allow"" or ""permit"" a company to join that will tank and take the index with it, then you're just plain foolish.Hope this helps...",0.9978

A number of things come to mind, we know that many people around the world want to buy a TSLA, many would wait if a new technology was imminent . He cannot have that, he wants and needs current sales to be robust. On the other hand, he also needs to keep good news flowing to support the lofty shareprice. I am convinced he has that news, we will learn some of it today, there will be more in the future, he will walk the fine line as he sees fit. Those who short TSLA , especially on weakness , should bear in mind and take very seriously his formidable warrior abilities. I, for one , I am not dismayed about the tweet, it is classic, typical Elon. There is more reasons I can think of for the tweet, but for now the above will suffice.The above being said, those of you who have followed my posts, know that I anticipate much more reasonable share price action than the extremists on the board. The extreme pumpers who spoke of $600 and more this week NEVER were going to be right. Those who think the stock will be at $1000 by year end are also wrong. I also believe the extremist bashers will continue to be wrong It is going to be interesting , that is always true for TSLA .................Less",0.9978

Still a frothy value. I think people are going to play both sma lines for a day trade. It's just too bad cathie wood got caught with her hand in the cookie jar.

Even if Tesla develops meaningful ancillary profit streams over time (e.g., recurring services revenue, battery sales to other automakers, an autonomous ride-hailing network, etc.), the company would probably need to grow sales to at least 10 million vehicles annually to justify its current valuation.

Even if Tesla just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

Most of them have never made a profit and the stocks have been soaring. Is this what the TSLA fans think TSLA is about? The beauty of the ""software as a service in the cloud"" model is that most of the costs (developing the software) is fixed regardless of the number of customers. Client acquisition is also a big expense, but, there there are large economies of scale and the dominant player is at a great advantage. Gross margins and operating margins are huge.But, despite all the protests that TSLA isn't just a car company, the fact is that nearly all its revenues comes from selling cars (or EV credits) and it is really just a car company. Growth will not greatly improve margins. You are not going to find buyers of a $25,000 car paying $10,000 for a self driving software package.

If Tesla hadn't gone up 10 times from it's price last March, but instead just rose a modest 24% each year, it might well have been an a successful track to increase in value 10 times by 2030.But, Tesla soaring stock price has drawn in a huge amount of capital into the EV market. The market always overdoes it when there is technological change creating a new product. There will end up being excess capacity and all the EV makers will be fighting for market share and profits will be meager at best. At least 1/2 of them will end up in bankruptcy. This is the lesson of the past. The 1960's had the color TV boom. Every household was going to buy one. And they did and the TV makers went bust or were bought out by the Japanese.Aluminum was the growth industry of the 1950's as lightweight aluminum was revolutionizing products.

2301,"Observations about @elonmusk's $420 LBO announcement:First, the context is odd: Musk promised on the conference call that $TSLA will be forever profitable. So why does he need to go private to ""end negative propaganda from shorts""? And why let them off the hook at $420?Musk suggests there will be no controlling shareholder in the LBO. He also says financing is already arranged. Ergo, he implies a syndicate of lenders has already signed documents for the deal. This is odd for two reasons...First, Musk recently rebuffed an investment offer from Saudi Arabia. If you're passing the hat for the largest LBO syndicate in history, why say no to a big check?Second, a $70B syndicate would involve numerous banks, dozens of lawyers, and multiple boards of directors. It's been [over] 12 hours since the announcement, and none of these parties has confirmed Musk's claims.Which raises a general point: a $70B dollar deal is a Jupiter-sized briar patch of legal and regulatory rules. It's a minutely choreographed thing, with legal risk for any party that says or does the wrong thing at the wrong time. With that in mind:Why did $TSLA not request a trading halt until an hour after Musk's tweet? Why did the company belatedly post an email from Musk, rather than an official statement? Why did Tesla not file an 8-K disclosing details of the purported LBO?Musk says he will not sell in the deal. What about his ~$800M in margin loans? Will lenders accept illiquid collateral?

All of that just proves Wall Street finally believes the indisputable global EV leader Tesla is actually a tech company that just so happens to make cars. So when the short-term shortie dopes on this discussion board cluelessly claim Tesla is only a car company that should be valued as such, just ask them: Given that Wall Street is now temporarily shifting some money to cyclicals (e.g., car companies), and if Tesla is only a ""car company,"" then why has Wall Street put Tesla in reverse price-wise while rising the stock price of the cyclical antiquated ICE car companies? [Cricket sounds ... ] There's your answer: Even the hopelessly clueless Wall Street finally figured out Tesla is a tech company that happens to make cars. All of Tesla's so-called ""competitors"" don't have the foggiest clue how to catch up to the innovative global EV leader Tesla which is many, many years ahead of all the ICE-makers. Just imagine the next few years: Each antiquated ICE gas-guzzling automaker may come up with some half#$%$ EV that sells maybe 25k or 50k units a few years from now. All the antiquated ICE companies will have tons of growing pains with their half#$%$ EV joint-ventures. Why would anyone want to spend their hard-earned money on some antiquated ICE gas-guzzling manufacturer's first shaky attempts at an EV when Tesla's been designing and manufacturing EVs for 21 years? Answer: They wouldn't. The great thing about the antiquated ICE automakers' announced attempts at EVs is that it's now bringing huge global attention to EVs. That's more free advertising for EVs. And when the world thinks ""EVs,"" it instantly thinks Tesla. And when the world thinks Tesla, it thinks ""EVs."" This is all going tremendously in Tesla's favor. If you ask Elon, he's loving this.

When reality finally sets in, ask yourself are you really willing to pay $850 or $$4,400 pre split per share of stock with your hard earned money? Less than 6 months ago analysts thought $1,000 was high before the split. Too much competition to think Tesla has a lock on the auto industry going forward.

2537,"Observations about @elonmusk's $420 LBO announcement:First, the context is odd: Musk promised on the conference call that $TSLA will be forever profitable. So why does he need to go private to ""end negative propaganda from shorts""? And why let them off the hook at $420?Musk suggests there will be no controlling shareholder in the LBO. He also says financing is already arranged. Ergo, he implies a syndicate of lenders has already signed documents for the deal. This is odd for two reasons...First, Musk recently rebuffed an investment offer from Saudi Arabia. If you're passing the hat for the largest LBO syndicate in history, why say no to a big check?Second, a $70B syndicate would involve numerous banks, dozens of lawyers, and multiple boards of directors. It's been [over] 12 hours since the announcement, and none of these parties has confirmed Musk's claims.Which raises a general point: a $70B dollar deal is a Jupiter-sized briar patch of legal and regulatory rules. It's a minutely choreographed thing, with legal risk for any party that says or does the wrong thing at the wrong time. With that in mind:Why did $TSLA not request a trading halt until an hour after Musk's tweet? Why did the company belatedly post an email from Musk, rather than an official statement? Why did Tesla not file an 8-K disclosing details of the purported LBO?Musk says he will not sell in the deal. What about his ~$800M in margin loans? Will lenders accept illiquid collateral? What about change of control provisions on $TSLA's debt? Who will fund the mandatory tender? Why did Musk's initial tweets portray this as a done deal, if his subsequent email revealed it to be merely his intention?Were these plans in the works when Musk publicly predicted a ""short burn of the century"" and a short squeeze larger than Volkswagen? Were they in the works when he aggressively purchased $TSLA shares in the premarket?If this deal is real, it won't be wrapped up for at least 6 months, and probably longer: a) need to assemble an independent board to vote on the deal (a court ruling this year decided that $TSLA's board is not independent of Musk), b) need a proxy statement with extensive risk disclosures (some think this is why $TSLA couldn't take the Saudi PIPE in the first place), c) need a shareholder vote, d) need antitrust review, even if perfunctory.Meanwhile, cash burn continues - in order to avoid default on their ABL, they must have cash/avail on Jan 1, 2019 sufficient to cover both 2019 convert maturities as well as a $400M buffer. That comes to $1.8B. At June they had $2.2B of cash and are burning close to $1B per quarter. Tough math.Musk says shareholders won't be forced to sell. How does that work? A private company with thousands of shareholders is still required to make SEC filings. How will unaccredited investors retain shares?The fact that none of these details was alluded to by Musk is further evidence that Musk has not discussed the deal with lawyers. Which brings us back to the question: how do you line up $70B in financing without involving a legal team?",0.9902

And if you can afford a Tesla but have never driven one, drive one today. I am on my second (first was S, second is an X, both pre-owned) and have turned many friends on to it, and they all are as passionate as I am. It just drives way better, and is way safer and smarter and just BETTER. More and more chargers and superchargers are popping up so the charging issue is all but gone and soon gas stations will include charging stations as well. I charge mine using the 220V outlet for my dryer in the garage, works like a charm. Lost my free supercharging when I traded in the S for the X, but it's worth it, the X is just Ludicrous.And can I buy a Tesla in brown or green? No, will I be able to in the future? Probably. Can I buy a Tesla convertible? No, but someday I will. Can you buy a Tesla in New Orleans? Don't think so. Can you buy one in every state? No, but someday but you will be able to. Can I watch a Tesla commercial on t.v.? No, but would that increase sales and awareness? Maybe. Tesla in some ways is in it's adolesence, and I see the future as bright. Is the future bright for Tesla stock? I don't know.that All I know is that I'm guessing that at best, a small per centage of people that can afford a Tesla has driven one, meaning a huge per centage of people that can afford one has not driven one.The future is bright, even with the imminent competition.

So if they run out of orders for the high priced models and options prior to 3-6 months worth of at least 5k production of the higher end models will they be forced to start building and selling the lower priced models sooner than expected?

If Musk really have investors lined up to buy all the remaining shares of the stockholders that can't/won't keep their shares after going private at 420, why aren't they already loading up on the open market for a huge discount? Why would they wait and pay a huge premium at 420? Why didn't they jump in on Friday?This isn't a hostile take-over where Tesla is in a position to set the price. No, Musk is explicitly putting Tesla in the showroom and is desperately eager to go private.

Doubling that number in 2019 to over 100,000; also impressive, 200,000 in 2020 would be unprecedented. And all extremely do-able. The problem arises when Mr. Big Mouth starts throwing unsustainable exponential growth claims, then falls flat on his face. The story should be that Tesla is doubling Model 3 production year-to-year, not ""Tesla Fails to Meet Guidance, Again"" And all this is needlessly brought on by the extraordinary claims of a megalomaniac. Being good and successful is not enough, Elon needs to be ""special"".

I'll explain this again. - in Q3-2018 Tesla was selling lots of high end fully loaded Model 3s in the USA.Buyers got the full $7,500 tax credit. With a little help from ZEV credit sales they posted a profit.In Q4 2018 they had to offer lower end versions of the Model 3. The profit deteriorated.In Q1-2019 they ran out of high end buyers in the US and started shipping overseas.Tesla also cut prices across the board US tax credits were reduced by 50%. But they had to cut prices and offer cheaper version in China before they delivered a single unit there. For Q1-2019 they lost $700 million. Partly due to a large number of cars being in transit. But that does not account for the whole loss. Q2-2019 - Tesla cut prices again.They offered a lease for the Model 3. Leases are not sales, they are not usually lucrative. They then sweetened the lease and lower the payment to $399..They enhanced the Model S/X product. They even offered the base Model 3 ($35,000) for a few days. US tax credits are set to be cut again in July - that might help pull some sales forward. Tesla is offering free unlimited charging on a few cars.It's May and Tesla still have 2018 leftovers. Q3-2019 is going to be a bloodbath. The US tax credit will be only worth $1,875 Chinese buyers will have a compelling reason to wait for the much less expensive Domestically built Model 3s. Europe will have had 6 months of Model 3 sales, the motivated buying will have subsided, A trade war could mean more tariffs on American Made cars going to China. Suggestion: Forget the fluff (robo taxis) and watch the actual story unfold. Wait for real numbers like quarterly sales and the financial reports.

I belong to the latter, having shorted a share that has been one of the best performers in this century.Tesla Inc. is coming to the end of its first year selling China-made cars with a commanding position in the world’s biggest electric-vehicle market, but Elon Musk shouldn’t rest on his laurels.While Tesla regularly topped monthly premium EV sales tallies this year, helped by the sedans churned out from its multibillion-dollar plant opened to much fanfare in Shanghai last December, 2020 was also marked by rivals catching up. In 2021, the breadth of the competitive attack that Tesla faces will be greater than ever.Whether Tesla can defend its lead in China will be key to its wider growth and earnings trajectory. While still in its infancy, China’s electric-car market dwarfs that of other countries and the government is intent on further expansion amid commitments to reduce fossil-fuel use. Tesla’s fate in China will also show whether it can grow into a truly global carmaker, an ambition investors are banking on after pushing the company’s shares up almost 700% this year.Chinese automakers are notorious for building copycat cars that look just like the real thing but deliver underwhelming performance and quality.

If a big piece would go down, people would go in anxiety mode, everything would depend on how much You still believe. If You don't, You would die the momment this would go down a large piece. The momment when most people will stop believing in this, this stock will crash, but if people still believe in the ""Safe, high tech, zero emission future"" It won't crash. You have to understand that years and years younger generations been exposed to climate change, food additives, air pollution, and everything else to the point where everyone worries so much about their health, that believing in a Company like Tesla, all the news that Elon say's, how he say's takes away people minds out of years and years anxiety, Corona virus is a good thing for a company likes this too. People live in their own heads most of the time, worrying about everything, this company is like miracle for them. It's a problem soliution that they had for a long time, it's a wishfull thinking. Until Musk will say everything will be allright, people will believe that, because they had to. You want to believe that too. Another thing is Youtube, more and more people are sharing Musk and his companies news, so more people are getting into this everyday, it will grow little by little. As more people are getting exposed to what Musk and Tesla is. Memes are combined to reach out young audiences, as they are more likely to join Tesla becouse of the worries and fears they already have as I wrote prior to this. World is in ""Danger"" and Musk looks like the one who could ""Save"" everyone, even if he can't it doesn't matter, kids will be already exposed to this using memes. Musk is not stupid, everything he does is pure live advertising. The momment when he smoked weed, it's all about getting more and more people into this. Smoking weed looks a cool thing to younger audiences, as well as other pot smokers, they natturaly want to be a fallower as he looks like one of them. Everything about this company is more about human psychology, and emotions, not about numbers and revenue. Numbers do affect everything, but as long as this company just down fall by messing up something very bad, it will only go up. If you don't believe me, look up to a Elon Musk hall of fame video, watch it till the end, the way he ""Cares"" and almost cries, the way he messed up at the beggining of the journey with rockets, 3 fails, he spent his own money, and so on. Watch yourself, how do you feel after watching video like this? And imagine how a kid feels when he sees something like this. It's a dream, emotions that flow, he looks like real hero. Even if he is not, that I don't know, I can only assume he is a good gay. Anyway, I hope it may help someone to just to think how belief works, and what can it do.

I’m not sure why, but my hunch that Tesla ( the corporation) pays a fine is a tactical SEC decision that will bear fruit down the line.

3076,"Tesla was ordered by the Chinese government to shut down its Shanghai factory over concerns about the coronavirus, a closure that will delay Model 3 production and ultimately put slight downward pressure on profits in the first quarter, the automaker's finance chief Zach Kirkhorn said during an earnings call Wednesday.Prior to the call, Tesla reported Wednesday $105 million in net income, or 56 cents a diluted share, compared with $140 million, or 78 cents a share, in the same year-ago period. Tesla earned $386 million, or $2.14 a share, in the fourth quarter when adjusted for one-time items. Tesla generated revenue of $7.38 billion in fourth quarter, just 1% higher than the $7.2 billion generated in the same period in 2018.Model 3 production will be delayed by a week and a half, Kirkhorn said. Novel coronavirus, a new form of the family of viruses known as coronavirus first cropped up in Wuhan in late December 2019. Since then, thousands of people have contracted the virus, causing the government to take measures such as shutting down transit and factories throughout the country, including Foxconn. Automakers Ford and Toyota have said they will idle some of their Chinese assembly plants for an extra week, the NYT reported.""We are in the early stages of understanding if, and to what extent, we may be temporarily impacted by the coronavirus,"" Kirkhorn said. ""At this point we're expecting a one, to one and a half week-delay in the ramp of the Shanghai build Model 3 due to a government required factory shutdown. This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter, but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages.""Tesla is also closely monitoring if the coronavirus will cause interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont. ""So far we're not aware of anything material, but it's important to caveat, this is an unfolding story,"" Kirkhorn added.The first deliveries of Tesla Model 3 sedans produced at the Shanghai plant began in early January, one year after the U.S. automaker began construction on its first factory outside the United States.The deliveries to customers was a milestone for Tesla and a critical step for the company in its aim to carve out market share in the world’s biggest auto market, as well as lessen the financial pain caused by tariffs.",0.7805

This was primarily achieved through substantial growth in vehicle deliveries as well as growth in other parts of the business. At the same time, vehicle average selling price (ASP) declined by 11% YoY as our product mix continued to shift from Model S and Model X to the more affordable Model 3 and Model Y.ProfitabilityOur operating income improved in Q4 compared to the same period last year to $575M, resulting in a 5.4% operating margin. This profit level was reached while incurring SBC expense attributable to the 2018 CEO award of $267M in Q4, driven by an increase in our market capitalization and a new operational milestone becoming probable.Positive impact from volume growth and regulatory credit revenue growth YoY was mainly offset by lower ASP (including price reduction of China-made Model 3 and price reductions of Model S and Model X before the introduction of updated models) but also by a series of notable items. These included a portion of Q@4 SBC charges, vehicle warranty accruals, additional supply chain costs, Model S and Model X changeover costs and other items.CashQuarter-end cash and cash equivalents increased to $19.4B in Q4, driven mainly by our recent capital raise of $5.0B (average price of this offering was -$632/share) and free cash flow of $1.9B, partially offset by early debt repayments (early conversion of convertible notes).",0.9797

The share price is determined as an average of the closing prices for a specified number of trading days prior to the periodic purchase. A discount of 5% to the average market price is common. Dollar cost averaging results from the automatic and periodic purchases. A direct purchase plan is similar to a DRIP except the shareholder must make arrangements to automatically transfer money to the direct purchase plan.Setting up a direct purchase plan would establish a steady source of new capital flowing in from those who are most supportive of the company's goals - its current owners (shareholders).

3151,"The favorite narrative is that Musk is environment-friendly, and that EVs are ""zero-emission"", however, there's a largely untold (or dismissed) story about how unfriendly the mining of battery ingredients are for the environment as well as Tesla's choice of battery ingredients. With every decision there's a plus and a minus. And conveniently leaving these CO2 emissions out of the calculations are necessary to promote this false zero-emissions story. Moreover, The CO2 emissions from mining for these ingredients is a CO2 incursion not applicable to ICE vehicles. It's been told that the total construction of EVs (mining for battery ingredients included) coming off the assembly line (before having driven a mile) have emitted more CO2 emissions than a comparable ICE vehicle coming off the assembly line, and that it takes a number of years of comparable driving before the total CO2 emissions of an EV vehicle finally falls below that of an ICE vehicle (yes, of course, the burning of gas is highly CO2 emissive too). I'm sure there's other sources of CO2 emissions in the construction of an EV, but here's a few to consider: - High CO2 emissions from mining for Lithium - High CO2 emissions from mining for the extra 350% copper required for building an EV - High CO2 emissions from mining for other battery ingredients - the choice of Aluminum in batteries vs Manganese results in a higher risk of battery catching on fire, which is also highly CO2 emissive. Tesla cars catching on fire remains one of the most common complaints (including by Chinese consumers as recently as January 2021) - Choosing to leave Cobalt out of the battery, although it preserves a rare mineral and saves money, it also increases the chance of a battery fire, which, again, is a highly CO2 emissive event - Choosing to include Aluminum in Tesla batteries, though it results in higher range and increased risk of fires, it also results in a lower car lifespan, meaning Tesla owners will be either buying cars more frequently, or replacing the battery. Its been reported that 8 years is a rarely achieved lifespan for Tesla EV batteries, and replacing one not only costs @ $16,000 but it incurs another set of high CO2 emissions from building yet another battery.

3164,"Tesla likely hit a peak Friday, or it could keep rising for huge gains for a few more days, with even bigger daily point gains. Selling at the very peak of a climax top is essentially the great fishing story for investors. Many will claim it, few will achieve it.Investors may want to sell some Tesla stock into strength, because when a climax top occurs, shares can fall to earth even faster than they rise.After a climax run, stocks often suffer huge declines that take years to recover from. Qualcomm (QCOM) finally surpassed its 2000 climax top peak last year.Tesla stock had a climax-type run in late 2019 to early 2020, peaking on Feb. 4 at a split-adjusted 193.80. Shares then plunged 64% to 70.10 on March 18, with the coronavirus market crash no doubt contributing to the losses.Perhaps Tesla stock will have a climax top, sell off and rebound rather quickly once again. But do you want to sit through a 30%, 50%, 80% decline on hopes for a rebound? If Tesla stock corrects or crashes and then bounces back, investors can always buy it back. After the coronavirus crash, Tesla stock offered buying opportunities slightly below and above the February peak.",0.9809

Then it recovered for about 1/2 hour, then resumed falling more. That happened 2 or 3 times during the day and ended the day at the low, down almost 23%. I don't remember any major stock avoiding the fall that day. I was actually not surprised, because on the Oct 16, a program called Wall Street Week featured, among other guests, Marty Zwieg. He was a highly respected market analyst. Louis Rukeyser asked him about the market. That day, Friday Oct 16, the Dow had fallen about 100 points, almost 5%. HE said something slightly out of character ""I am worried........"". He was usually very careful not to be so direct. Rukeyser did not press him to elaborate. I think Louis knew full well Marty might be right on and a much lower market was very close. Little did they know the extent and sharpness of the fall the following Monday. I have never lost the impact of that market psychology leading up to that Monday. I now have a very similar sense for Monday, Oct 29, 2018. If not that day, then sometime during next week. That fall could be sudden and short lived like 1987 or it would be like Oct, 2008 when the steepest part of the fall lasted much of October. I seem to remember 2 or three days that month, the Dow fell about 1000 points during a day. I think the crash we will see next week will be more similar to 2008.",0.8749

Adding that he just weakened Tesla's ability to negotiate a strong buyout, Tesla almost needs to negotiate any kind of deal for a partial buyout now. Musk's only hope is that the Trump SEC is as dysfunctional as the rest of the government. This one is easy for the SEC to determine as Musk just revealed that the text was incorrect. If Tesla Board is smart, they will remove Musk from the daily management and start mitigating a very expensive error for the company.

The Trump is more desperate than ever to artificially fix markets...and Powell can't think straight either. This is the bloody streets that many waited for on the sidelines...bloodier than anyone expected. While many sectors have been impacted by the virus slowing down their businesses, consumers are spending less on smaller luxury purchases and just focusing on necessities. One necessity is still an automobile and anyone who was planning to get a new car, is still going to get a Tesla. Consumers that had a Model Y reserved are still going to take delivery on time....they're even going to likely get a better financing rate as well. So while there will a significant reduction in consumer wants-spending at malls, stores, and any other personal items that aren't a true need....I believe Teslas will keep rolling out of showrooms. And if you're one of the people that have a Tesla on order...investing in TSLA now will help pay for your Tesla. The key is to keep your mind focused on the long term rewards with TSLA and other tech stocks that took a hit. This is the biggest investment opportunity for anyone who's been waiting to invest in the stock market.

It's time to buy....everything is undervalued now and way oversold. Bull volume is going to come out ahead sooner than the skeptics want you to believe. The country has locked down in the past few days and the virus spread will slow now. If you're skeptical, invest in 10-25% chunks of your and slowly to your portfolio over a few days. Keep in mind...the outlook at $TSLA, $AMD, and many others has not changed at all....they are still focused on long term goals and companies have taken huge steps to keep their employees safe. Their products will continue to sell. Volatility is always temporary. Buy the bottom and keep holding. TSLA is still a $1500+ target for 2020.

As a reminder to bulls, Musk said in 2016 that by 2020 we will be producing 1 million cars and and reality is barely making to half of that mark. It seems, all along Musk trying to burn shorts by setting these unattainable goals and giving false promises to investors of TSLA. Over last year or so, everyone on winning side (investors, traders) got used to this bubble but one day reality will hit and its gonna be bad. Research telling by 2024 there will be just 10% of car volume will be EV. And not that all will be tsla and there is some serious competition out there in that space. TSLA has few IP blocks which has kept them ahead in this tech sector - EV car, Autonomous driving software/hardware and battery technology. For each of this IP block there are some serious competitors and for me interesting thing is they have their own design/architecture and not just copying what TSLA doing. Typically competition copies leader and catch up with them sooner or letter (Example Intel, Irbot). But interestingly Tesla competitors surely gonna distinguish themselves. By 2024 or before that each IP block will be well developed, there will 2 to 3 decent options and it wont take long for companies like Toyota, Honda, GM, Ford (may be apple) to integrate and put some great product out there for consumers. To make matter worse for TSLA, car sales are going to be significantly down in coming few years (~30%). There are all kinds of projections which indicates 30% of population will never return to office work and that should directly impact car sales. So 10% of EV car volume by 2024 will be just 7% and out of 7% even is mush gets 70%, that will be just 5% of total EV cars for TSLA. So everyone make money as long as you can so that total gains surpass that big loss going to come soon. Good luck!!",0.9961

An Apple engineer should be credible and able to work the system to report a serious malfunction like that.

Surely they could go back and capture the event in the logs if there was a malfunction like that. This accident occurred within 10 miles of Tesla HQ in Palo Alto.

Using one of these solar panel sizing calculators, say in Texas (a relatively sunny state) it says you'd need at least a 15kW system. In less sunny states it would be much larger.If the average cost of a system is $3/kW, that's $45,000.If you were to finance the system for 20 years at 5% the payment would be about $300/mt.I know Texas is a deregulated state so you can get electricity off the grid anywhere from $0.04 to $0.10/kwh depending on how well you shop. Let's assume $0.07/kwh. At an average usage of 2000 kwh's, that's a monthly cost of $140/mt.That's less than half the payment for the ""free energy"".It gets worse.If you take the $45,000 and invest it in something that returns 5% per year (yours truly regularly gets 10 to 20%/yr out of it),.... That's $2250 per year or $187/mt.That would pay the electric bill (and dinner for 4 at the all you can eat Chinese buffet,... where the owner walks out after cabin boy and his date leboy have been there for a couple of hours and says - ""you go home now,.... you eat too much,.... you too beeg,... you eat all my flied lice,... you go home now.) and you'd still have your $45,000.Let's say you cut your energy usage in half and buy half the solar panels.

3978,"DETROIT (AP) — Tesla Inc. is balking at recalling about 159,000 vehicles with potentially defective touch screens, so U.S. safety regulators are moving to force the company to take action.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Wednesday sent a letter to Tesla saying it has tentatively determined that the screens are defective and pose a safety risk because they can cause backup cameras to go dark and defrosters to malfunction.The agency wouldn't comment beyond the letter, which is a rare step toward a public hearing and eventual legal action. Experts say the letter means that Tesla has resisted doing a recall that NHTSA feels is necessary.“It's obvious to me that Tesla told NHTSA to go pound sand, so what they're about to get, they've earned it,” said Frank Borris, a former head of the agency's Office of Defects Investigation who now runs a safety consulting business.Messages were left Wednesday seeking comment from Tesla, which is based in Palo Alto, California.Last June, the agency opened an investigation into complaints that the giant touch screens would go dark in certain 2012 through 2018 Model S cars and 2016 through 2018 Model X Tesla vehicles. It upgraded the probe to an engineering analysis in November.The letter says the agency has determined that the screens are defective because their computer processors have a finite number of program-and-erase cycles. NHTSA says the screens would fail in five to six years, which isn't sufficient for safety-critical features.“The lack of a functioning windshield defogging and defrosting system may decrease the driver's visibility in inclement weather, increasing the risk of a crash,” the letter said.In data submitted by Tesla, the agency found more than 12,000 customer complaints, field reports, warranty claims and other claims related to the screens, the letter said.NHTSA also determined that the failure rate for the screens is higher than the rate for vehicles involved in prior recalls for similar problems.Tesla tried to fix the problem with several over-the-air software updates, but NHTSA said it tentatively believes the fixes are insufficient.“I think it's planned obsolescence, which requires physical replacement of a part which Tesla tried to gloss over by sending a software update,” said Jason Levine, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety.The screen failures also can cause the loss of audible chimes and alerts that are part of Tesla’s “Autopilot” driver-assist system.The letter says that if Tesla formally decides not to do a recall, it has to provide NHTSA with an explanation. The agency can schedule a public meeting on matter and could turn it over to the Justice Department for legal action, Borris said.Borris, who reviewed the letter, called it very thorough and said NHTSA has a strong case should Tesla decide to challenge the agency in court.",0.9517

Why: Too much real competition with many leading EV makers reaching 100,000 in volume in 2022, TSLA 2023 numbers going forward are going to get revised down. GM comes out as a surprise competitor whom may actually be better positioned than tesla (with many partnerships building cheaper cars and they currently hold the title for a best selling EV in China now) ! NIO has battery tech that seems to be better than Teslas, but Tesla's biggest problem is the $25,000 sub car market, you know the main part of the car market for the average consumer. Many EV manufactures are much closer to the goal of a mass market $25,000 < EV. GM is emerging as major competition for Tesla , NIO, XPeng, Li, BYD right now ! GM's stock will go up more than tesla's this year and possibly more than those other EV manufacturers as well. Everyone wrote off ICE manufactures but GM has been making incremental upgrades the whole time. Don't count out ford with the Mach-e either. As far as I'm concerned Tesla will maintain its market share on the higher end EVs but doesn't have a chance against EV competitors that already have sub $25,000 EVs. Tesla makes 4 vehicles out of --> 100 <--- different types needed to replace ICE.

4236,"Wood and her team seem to have a ""special talent"" for finding and promoting the MOST over-valued speculative-bubble-stocks in this market, and Wood's ""worship"" of the con-artist Elon Musk is particularly troublesome. If Wood can't see that Elon is an obvious fraudster, I question the rest of her abilities at recognizing honest hardworking scientists, engineers and business people making real progress with technology.Understanding how Musk is a con-artist is just a matter of looking. Take, for example, his introduction of ""solar shingles"" when he was trying to use Tesla's stock to bail out the bankrupt SolarCity (saving his cousins and himself from losing millions). The solar-shingle roll-out was Theranos-level fraud. There was no product, no research and development; it was a mock-up of fake shingles (on fake houses -- all done on a Hollywood movie studio set); there was NO energy being generated by any of the tiles, yet Musk stood in front of the crowd explaining how all those roofs around them were generating energy.Or look at Musk's claim -- way back when the stock was under $400, pre-split -- that he had the ""funding secured"" to take the company private. The CEO of a multi-billion dollar company telling millions of followers on social media a complete lie just to juice the stock price -- and the Board and shareholders didn't boot him out after that nonsense?!Or even consider how Musk seems compelled to lie about relatively little things -- and can easily be caught in those lies -- such as the defense he used for calling Unsworth a ""pedo guy""; Musk claimed the term ""pedo guy"" wasn't any insult suggesting one was engaging in certain criminal sexual behavior, but that it was a term, common in his native South Africa, that just means ""creepy old man."" People in South Africa reacted, ""Say what?"" -- it's a bald-faced lie that the term is such an insult in South Africa.Or look at Musk's statements about the bankruptcy that almost happened when Tesla was trying to ramp production of the Model 3. Musk claimed, after the fact, that Tesla was ""single digit weeks"" away from bankruptcy during the Model 3 ramp -- the problem is, this ""single digit weeks"" from bankruptcy never showed itself in the company's SEC-filed financial statements; they always showed they had solvency out about a year or more. Their auditors never required any ""going-concern"" warning with their audited statements. The only conclusion: there are two sets of books and Musk was aware of a bankruptcy risk being just days away, while the other set of books -- provided to the SEC and public-investor -- showed much better solvency.Or just look at the bovine excrement Musk pushes to SpaceX investors -- it's too long of a topic to discuss here, but The Common Sense Skeptic has made an excellent video series (available on YouTube) that debunks the sort of nonsense Musk spews while promoting SpaceX.Musk is a con artist, plain and simple. While that doesn't mean the entire company of Tesla is like a Theranos, it is very likely similar to Enron's type of fraud. Enron did approximately $80 billion of legitimate business a year before its bankruptcy; it was a relatively small amount of accounting fraud at the top -- which hid the true financial condition of the company from shareholders -- that brought the company down. Tesla is a real company, just not a profitable one. While it has shown losses for most of its life, I see enough evidence to conclude those losses were actually a lot LARGER than have been reported; and those quarters of ""profitability"" that got the company into the S&P 500 were all just an accounting fabrication.Silicon Valley start-ups have a saying, ""Fake it until you make it."" It's essentially an admission that ""lying"" is OK while you're trying to build a business. That can work with some technology companies because the profit margins in certain technology companies can be so high, a company can actually make up (and permanently bury) for its previous lying while growing the company. I think Musk has used this ""fake it"" strategy with Tesla -- the problem is: Tesla is a CAR company, with low margins; there is no high-margin pot-of-gold at the end of its growth-stages. My conclusion (looking at a lot more evidence than the few items I mention here): Tesla is a house-of-cards with massive losses ""hidden"" using accounting tricks. (I actually suspect SpaceX and The Boring Co are being used in ways similar to the way Enron used its ""SPVs."") Ultimately, I expect it will implode like Enron did. $TSLA",0.9688

4390,"In the latest delivery report released on Thursday, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) beat most analysts' delivery estimates by handing ownership over to about 88,400 customers in Q1 (Form 8-K filing is here). This was, as expected, a record for any 1st quarter. It easily beat 1Q19 since Model 3 deliveries did not begin in Europe and China until mid-February last year, so Tesla's numbers benefited this year from worldwide deliveries of Model 3 for the entire month of January and early February.However, the ratio of vehicles built versus delivered in the quarter was the worst since 1Q19. While Tesla indeed delivered 88,400 units, it represented 86% of the total production of 102,672 vehicles resulting in a surplus of 14,272 units. Combined with excess inventory from prior quarters, Tesla's unsold inventory spiked to 26,961 units, an increase of 112% from 4Q19.First, we can see the huge increase in unsold units that soared 120%. Part of this increase occurred in China in Jan/Feb where Model 3 deliveries were 83% of production (5,487 deliveries vs. 6,583 units produced. We are still a few weeks away from verifiable March numbers). Europe also appears to have ended with a large surplus inventory. During the quarter, seven ships transported units to Zeebrugge, Belgium with a few continuing on to Southampton, England. TeslaMotorsClub.com member Troy does an excellent job of pulling verifiable data together to track most European sales. For Q1, his spreadsheet (here) shows 22,728 deliveries which are almost identical to 2019 at 22,759. Norway and The Netherlands have been replaced in the top spot by the U.K. This may not account for other smaller EU markets. But if each ship carried an average of 4,000 Tesla vehicles, we can see that a good portion of these unsold units is probably sitting in Europe, waiting to be delivered to buyers in Q2 due to the coronavirus shutdowns in many of those countries.Second, in the press release last week, Tesla oddly chose to combine Model 3 with Model Y production and delivery figures. Some would think they did this to hide relatively low figures for Model Y out the gate. But if we look back to 3Q17, in the above chart, Tesla had no problem reporting just a few hundred cars in Model 3's initial quarter. It would seem Tesla is actually trying to mask the severe drop in Model 3 global sales which were the worst in a year since Q1 2019. That number last year was unusually low for several reasons. First, 4Q18 marked the end of the full $7,500 FITC in the U.S. which pulled Q1 sales forward into Q4. Second, Model 3 deliveries in both China and Europe did not begin until about halfway through the quarter in mid-February. This, of course, made 1Q20 deliveries look better in a YoY comparison.It has been and still is my belief that moving the introduction of the Model Y forward to March from later in the year was due to the slowing of orders for the Model 3 and to fill a drop in revenue that Tesla has known was coming in the first half of 2020. This became very clear last year when total U.S. revenue dropped $2.2 billion from 2018 levels.",0.9865

BAD accounting practice aka aggressive approach ($TSLA, start up/tech companies):- DO NOT expense the items on #1 and capitalize them by putting them in assets as ""CAPEX - Capital Expenditure""- Once a stock price gets super high, write off bad debts/old model parts/warranty claims as ""one-time"" charge as they are not related the ""current"" production line.- Raising Billions of dollars to inflate the balance sheet via stock sales which don't show up on liability section- Start adding non-related business/investment into the company so it confuses the company's shareholders, analysts, accountants and regulators.Which one has the long term value?

4576,"Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) investment in Bitcoin (BTC) is a sign that the automaker has “run out of viable internal uses” of its capital, according to GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson.The Tesla Analyst: Johnson kept his Sell rating on Tesla’s stock and maintained his price target of $67 on the stock.The Tesla Thesis: Johnson, a long-term Tesla bear, came down heavily on the Elon Musk-led company for its .5 billion dollar investment in BTC.“TSLA took a large chunk of the cash (i.e., $1.5bn, or ~12.2% of the ~$12bn in equity raised in three offerings in 2020) generated from three secondary equity offerings in 2020, and invested it in a highly volatile and allegedly manipulated crypto currency,” wrote Johnson.The analyst said the company had run out of viable internal uses of capital as it did not invest it in research and development or capital expenditure. As per Johnson, the Bitcoin news was released at a time when the company is facing “negative business developments” and is a distraction.The GLJ Research note pointed to declining car sales in China, quality control issues, delay in the German factory, and the inability to obtain the full $1.2 billion in subsidies in that country as the negative factors.The analyst said in his view BTC is an “environmental disaster” as it consumers as much power as the entire country of Switzerland.GLJ noted the potential regulatory pitfalls of the Bitcoin purchase, which they admitted were unlikely.“We see this as a sign of desperation from a CEO whose company is facing real competition for the first time ever,” said the analyst — adding that even if Tesla were to sell its BTC holdings today, it would pocket up to $200 million in profits “that fall 100% to the bottom line, offsetting any losses in its core business of selling cars.”",0.8399

We expect to further ramp to a rate of 10,000 Model 3 vehicles per week, and an annual Tesla vehicle production rate in excess of 500,000, at some point in 2018.Nov 2017 10Q Based on our current progress, we expect to achieve a production rate of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018, although the precise progress of the ramp is difficult to predict given that our production growth rate is similar to a stepped exponential, so there may be significant rate increases from one week to the next. In order to optimize the incremental improvement of our automation processes and the efficiency of our capital expenditures, we will implement the capacity to further ramp production to 10,000 units per week only after we have achieved a 5,000 units per week run rateFeb 2018 10kBased on our current progress, we are targeting a production rate of 2,500 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018 and 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter. It is important to note that while these are the levels we are focused on hitting and we have plans in place to achieve them, our prior experience on the Model 3 ramp has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time. We are systematically addressing bottlenecks and adding capacity and resources in places like the battery module line where we have experienced constraints, and these actions should result in our Model 3 production rate significantly increasing during the first half of 2018. In some cases, we may not achieve the manufacturing labor efficiencies until we ramp up to fully automated manufacturing lines, which may take us longer than anticipated. In order to optimize the incremental improvement of our automation processes and the efficiency of our capital expenditures, we will implement the capacity to further ramp production to 10,000 units per week only after we have achieved a 5,000 units per week run rate.",0.9985

Chances are they might even be safer, though it's tough to say that definitively.""The propensity and severity of fires and explosions from ... lithium ion battery systems are anticipated to be somewhat comparable to or perhaps slightly less than those for gasoline or diesel vehicular fuels,"" according to the results of an in-depth investigation into the relative fire risks of the two types of vehicles conducted by Battelle for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last fall.About 174,000 vehicle fires were reported in the United States in 2015, the most recent year for which statistics are available from the National Fire Protection Association. Virtually all of those fires involved gasoline powered cars. That works out to about one every three minutes.Tesla claims that gasoline powered cars are about 11 times more likely to catch fire than a Tesla. It says the best comparison is fires per 1 billion miles driven. It says the 300,000 Teslas on the road have been driven a total of 7.5 billion miles, and about 40 fires have been reported. That works out to five fires for every billion miles traveled, compared to a rate of 55 fires per billion miles traveled in gasoline cars.Can the fire risk for electric cars be reduced?Yes. And Risser and others say that is likely to happen.Research is taking place for new materials that might not only make batteries lighter and more efficient, but could possibly make them safer. ""Gasoline is a very risky material. We have had 130 years of designs and experience to make a gasoline powered vehicle as safe as possible.

That is $1.5B of potential revenues per year. Even if 50% is spent on payouts thats still a cool $0.5B and will keep increasing over the years. Think about that!2. Giga factory 3 in China operational: Will announce that production has started and will re-iterate expected #s by the end of this month. This will begin to address the demand in China and the Pacific at a lower cost/vehicle.3. Revenues and profit/loss will be better than expected. It will once again demonstrate (fud and misinformation from shorts, notwithstanding) that every vehicle they sell makes money (or is profitable). The expansion of infrastructure: giga factories, new service/repair centers, additional charging stations etc etc are capital intensive and thats why the expense exceeds their revenues. However, that should slow down once the China factory is in full, operation = more cars sold = more revenues = less loss or even profits in the next year or so.4. TSLA will also show that even in this tough market where all vehicles sales from other companies are going down, demand for TSLAs still remains robust. This talk about 100K vs 97K sold in Q3 is just utter none-sense promoted by dis-tractors. The number is still record high from Q3 last year or Q2 this year. # likley to go up in Q4 once G3 in China ramps up production.",0.9921

It took one earnings report for growth to slow (and just a smidgen) and a market reversal to send the stock into a downward correction. In two days it lost 14% of it's over-blown value. It is off more than 20% from its high. Tesla has a similar story in the stock price (nowhere else, mind you), in there is no fundamental support behind the stock price. The valuation is made up, I suppose upon a belief of future earnings. It takes small bad news to send the stock cratering, like rather innocent tweets, and the stock caves 3% immediately.

It's way ahead of the competition, its EVs are superior in quality and performance, and total addressable market has only been 2 percent tapped.

Waymo said that accurately wording the technology could also save lives. Of late, Tesla has been mired in safety-related controversies, which picked up much more steam after a fatal crash in South Korea led to two people being injured and one fatality.At the beginning of 2020, Tesla faced 14 scrutinies by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for accidents that involved its autopilot systems.Why Does It Matter: Waymo clarified that erroneously branding driver assists as fully autonomous sends a wrong message to auto buyers and enthusiasts. The post suggested that misleading impressions could inflate the ability of the vehicle and result in an unnecessary risk to drivers, passengers, and others on the road.""Unfortunately, we see that some automakers use the term 'self-driving' in an inaccurate way, giving consumers and the general public a false impression of the capabilities of driver assist (not fully autonomous) technology,"" Waymo said.""That false impression can lead someone to unknowingly take risks (like taking their hands off the steering wheel) that could jeopardize not only their own safety but the safety of people around them.""",-0.2528

They realize the EVs threat is going to come faster than even they expected. Proof: Tesla continues expansion into China and German factory locations. But here's the biggest IMO: in April 2020, $TSLA will hold their Battery Day event and I expect Tesla to announce their accomplishments over the past year since they acquired several technologies to help improve battery range dramatically. We could see a 30% improvement in range in Tesla vehicles coming out after April and on top of that, we will see a reduction for price to drop below $100 per kilowatt hour. This will be huge. I believe TSLA pps will go from today's low of $600 drive the price up past $1000. The oil sellers realized they don't have much time left as profits will drop significantly for them within 3-5 years as the world will have a massive EV transition. 5 years is what I give all other auto manufacturers to finally have EV models that will also be successfully selling to compete with TSLA to a degree, but this will be a bigger blow to the oil industry....not kill it.....but significant pain to their profits. In the past couple of weeks, you had one of the biggest auto makers announce they are fully committed to EVs more than ever....GM. Oil saw this too and after they had their emergency meetings to deal with a crisis that will start for their industry sooner than they expected, they foolishly decided cutting oil prices will help scramble for as much profits as possible for the few years left for them to take advantage of their monopoly over the auto industry.

5387,"guys serious questionI have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound.

Further, let's assume a 5% net margin (vs 1.89% most recently). Now, the worldwide market for new vehicles (number of vehicles x average selling price) is around $2.8T. So, TSLA would get $1.4T and would earn $70B (@5% net margin). Now since we've assumed growth stops at 50% marketshare, a reasonable PE would be 12 (No more growth, just dividends). So, 12 x $70B is $840B, which is basically what the market cap is today. Good job.Now TSLA has other businesses and they could get more than 50% marketshare. And the market for new vehicles in 2030 is expected to be $3.4T, not $2.8T and they can make money from subscriptions etc. But seriously? Tesla vehicles are great, but Tesla's stock no longer is.

He told them to order the parts. Two weeks later they put it on a lift and call him. Say there's also body damage and they can't touch it. Also canceled his parts order and told him he has to return the loaner and take his car to an authorized body shop. He asked multiple times if body damage is structural or cosmetic, but they wouldn't say. Also won't help him get it to a body shop. He called multiple approved body shops in the area and none of them would take his car because they already have such a backlog of model 3 waiting for parts. He also emailed the Tesla body shop. Remember when Elon was going to revolutionize body shops by opening his own so you could get your car fixed the same day? total bs. The poor guy hasn't even gotten the Tesla body shop to respond. He doesn't know what to do. Faced with paying for a rental for months. Absolutely loves the car though. Just can't drive it anymore. I suppose he could go see it on visiting day.

I have analyzed thoroughly and see that TSLA is sitting in the perfect position for the ""ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTIES"" ( the option mm's and their followers/players) to effect the VERY significant , most significant in fact option unwind in the history of TSLA. You see that this friday , the JAN 15 options will expire. These were the former leap options that have been around for a couple of years or so, so they naturally have a lot of open interest , but in fact, they have more open interest than ANY series of options that TSLA has experienced EVER. So much interest , that if you choose the strike price which renders the LOWEST dollar value of ALL the combined options outstanding for JAN 15 expiry added together. ( what all the calls and puts of the whole series would be worth if TSLA closes at that strike price), they would still be worth $14.3 BILLION . That compares with the analgous figure of $380 million for the Jan 22 expiration , a small percentage of the dollar open interest of the jan 15 exp. At yesterday's close of aprox $850, the jan 15 options would be worth aprox $22.6 BILLION . Now I have seen TSLA swallow $2 BILLION of change from the LDV without trouble when it has news or huge momentum, but never has it had to swallow such a difference before.

5767,"Rumor: Tesla Model 2 Already Developed in China & Goes to Production in 2022On January 8, information was leaked from the Chinese media that Tesla had already developed a new car model, and would soon be ready to begin production at its Giga Shanghai. The affordable compact car is expected to be produced and delivered in 2022.According to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, some of the best works of art in the world were created in China, so he believes that projects created in China will also be popular around the world. The Chinese have always been distinguished by originality, speed, and intelligence, so China is a great place to develop, create, and implement the most original and unexpected solutions.At the ceremony of handing over the first made-in-China Model 3s to owners, which took place on January 7, 2020, in Shanghai, Musk announced that Tesla plans to establish its own R&D center in China, where the company will create a car for the whole world. Musk said:“Something that would be super cool...so we’re going to do it...is to try to create a China to actually design an original car in China for worldwide consumption. I think this will be very exciting.""As early as mid-January 2020, Tesla began recruiting employees for the new development center and called on them to help the company build Chinese-style cars.Today, the Chinese media, citing reliable sources, reported that the new Tesla car model already was approved as early as September 2020. Product verification is expected to be completed in March 2021, with production and first deliveries scheduled to begin in 2022. Tesla will build its new model at Giga Shanghai.According to sources, the chassis of the car is based on the Model 3 chassis, which will also speed up and simplify the start of production. Perhaps this is what made it possible to develop a new model so quickly. Estimated price will range from RMB150,000 to RMB200,000 ($25,000 - $30,000).When Tesla opened recruitment for the R&D center in mid-January 2020, the team used an image of an interesting new concept car. We've never seen anything like it before. Whether Tesla will develop something similar at the new Chinese R&D center, or it's just a picture that has nothing to do with Tesla's future projects, we do not know. But the new China-made model is sure to be as stunning as the entire Chinese Tesla project.Good luck and GOD bless,",0.9984

5818,"Terrific analysis by Morningstar’s John Rekenthaler. Bottom line: TSLA is a collectible: Most of the company’s terrific stock market performance owes to its business results. In 2010, Tesla’s annual revenues were a modest $117 million. Early believers were undeterred, believing that the firm’s sales would skyrocket. They were correct. Last year, Tesla recorded $31.5 billion in revenues, making for a 39% annualized 10-year growth rate. Tesla would not have appealed to Ben Graham, but he would have appreciated the reason for the stock’s success. Recently, though, Tesla’s stock price has sometimes appeared to diverge from its corporate affairs. In 2020, for example, Tesla gained 780%, although the firm’s revenues and profits finished slightly below analysts’ estimates. True, those results were achieved during an unanticipated global recession, so there was good reason for the stock to rise. But the amount seems excessive. So, too, does the stock’s 19% increase on March 9, a day without significant company news.It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that, to some extent, Tesla’s stock has become a collectible--a security that is prized not solely for its company’s virtues but also for the belief that it will appreciate because others desire it.",0.9951

So did 60 others.Those that weren't laid off in Big Layoff 1 or Big Layoff 2 want to leave because they see the writing on the wall. Top talent is already gone. Gigafactory 1 will soon be Panasonic's. Gigafactory 2 is an empty fraud subject to clawbacks. Gigafactory 3 is an open field in China.The stores are all closing. The Model S and Model X lawsuits continue to pile up because of design and manufacturing defects, including those from buildings cars in a tent. The Model 3 has more flaws than the S or X, but those lawsuits haven't even hit yet for the most part.There isn't enough reserved for warranty repairs. The DOJ was investigating Model 3 production numbers long ago, and is likely triply interested now. The Parulekar accounts payable wire fraud case is still mostly sealed. And there's likely been an SEC referral to DOJ over Musk.Then there's the cash crunch. Today, $920 million in cash vanishes. They misled investors on cash position in the 10-K so they probably only have a couple hundred million left (if that), so the company is running on fumes and has to delay small claims hearings over $5K disputes.Can someone on Wall Street please explain where the $50 billion in value remains for this company?Because if that wasn't enough, the cars also have a tendency to A) change lanes on their own; and B) spontaneously combust, killing people, as if we're back to the days of the Ford Pinto.",-0.163

They rise because the inflation is backed into the cake. That being said stupid people sell gold or sell because of margin calls and smart people buy metals and mining stocks. The inflation will be huge. The money velocity is EXTREMELY low at the moment, yet money creation rises exponential.

Most of you probably bought tesla post stock split or above $1000 PRE STOCK SPLIT.I got in Tesla beloe $100s. So I continue to add I to NIO and sell Tesla. Why? Because Tesla is not better than over 10 automakers combined in terms of market cap, especially not Toyota. Tesla is great though, but I never expected tesla to even pass 500 when I got in initially when they were on the verge of bankruptcy.I don't care if Tesla drops because my average is so low that I can laugh at you late buyers post run up. I can't even justify the current market cap.For NIO I can because it's a luxury EV/tech/infrastructure company that has all the components of Tesla except better in an economy that will surpass America aka China.So I can actually justify the market cap moving up because this is Chinas future cash cow. Everything Cathue woods priced in for Tesla is 10-25 years forward and has not been priced in for NIO yet.Hate me? Too bad.

Tesla was unable to secure a long term contract with Ivanhoe Mines3.) Tesla does not offer a PHEV - a low cobalt alternative, 4.) GM is working on a battery chemistry with no Cobalt. 5.) All of the other ca makers sell millions of profitable vehicles and can sell EV s at a loss almost indefinitely. 6.) Tesla depends on EVs. January 2018 (((( When BMW AG revealed it was designing electric versions of its X3 SUV and Mini, the going rate for 21 kilograms of cobalt—the amount of the metal needed to power typical car batteries—was under $600. Only 16 months later, the price tag is approaching $1,700 and climbing by the day. ))))2018(( A big part of the GM plan is altering the chemistry of its EV batteries to eliminate cobalt, the most expensive component used in today’s batteries and one whose price on the world market is rising rapidly. ))(*) The actual cost disadvantage is unknown. The $1,000 figure comes from Bloomberg there is not way to verify it. (**) Most long term contracts provide for material cost increases. In the case of Panasonic and Tesla one of these parties has likely taken on the risk. If Panasonic offered Tesla a fixed price for the cells then Panasonic priced the risk into the cells. If there is a clause in the contract that allows Panasonic to pass along material price increases - then Tesla will pay more for the cells. Of course, either party can hedge Cobalt prices in the short term. Panasonic would have hedged Cobalt for the duration of the contract with Tesla. One way Panasonic might hedge the price of Cobalt would be with a long term contract with their suppliers. If Panasonic can contractually pass on price increases to Tesla based on commodity prices then Panasonic might go for a long term contract with their suppliers to get lower prices.

Still, if one bought at the peak and held on, one would not have too bad a loss considering that INTL has been paying dividends.INTC might have been considered a ""bubble"" in 2000, but it's rise was quite measured and related to fundamental changes (like the introduction of new chips).

6443,"SHAREHOLDER ALERT : Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC Notifies Investors of Class Action Against Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 9, 2018ACCESSWIRE ACCESSWIRE•August 22, 2018NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / August 24, 2018 / Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed Tesla, Inc. (""Tesla"" or the ""Company"") (TSLA) and its CEO, Elon Musk (""Musk""),on behalf of shareholders who purchased or otherwise acquired Tesla securities between the now extended dates of August 7, 2018 to August 14, 2018, (the ""Class Period""). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: www.bgandg.com/tsla.This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.The complaint states that on August 7, 2018, Musk stated on Twitter: (1) ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420;"" (2) ""Funding secured;"" (3) ""Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares & go private;"" and (4) ""Investor support is confirmed."" Following these tweets, Tesla shares went up as much as $45.47 per share, or 13%, during intraday trading before closing at $379.57 on August 7, 2018.Since then, both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla's board of directors are reportedly investigating the truth of Musk's tweets, and whether in fact funding had been secured. Several large investors and banks have said that they are unaware of any funding. Following the news of these investigations Tesla stock has dropped to close at $355.49 per share on August 10, 2018.The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) contrary to Musk's statements that funding had been ""secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share, no such funding had been secured; and (2) contrary to Musk's statement that investor support to take Tesla private ""is confirmed,"" there was no such confirmation.The complaint continues to allege that on August 13, Musk tweeted ""I'm excited to work with Silver Lake and Goldman Sachs as financial advisors . . . on the proposal to take Tesla private."" However, on August 14, Bloomberg issued an article titled ""Goldman Is Said to Have No Mandate When Musk Tweeted,"" and said that neither entities were working with Musk when Musk wrote that the firms were advising him.A class action lawsuit has already been filed.

With a low of 511 yesterday and then 600+ in premarket, the likes of Morgan Stanley got what they wanted from TSLA and many other stocks. TSLA has so much support above 785 and it can get back faster than the drop over the past few days. The same reasons it got it up to $950+ is the same momentum that will drive it right back up extremely fast when bullish volume returns. The bonus: Model Y deliveries begin today. Today, AMD, APPL, TSLA, NIO have the most bullish volume in premarket....if you bought any of these yesterday, you're already up 10%+ from their yesterday's lows. If you're waiting for the bottom, stop listening to the media frenzy. No one can time the bottom perfectly. What happened in 2008 and 1987 and other huge selloffs are not always the same...and this past week's drop is very different. The virus fear and potential impact to the economy is causing panic, largely induced by the media and a president who doesn't have the ability to calm a nation. Our economy is very healthy and this is not a correction whatsoever. People want to call it that because they've been hoping the world burns so their short positions make some money. The demand for products from $TSLA, $AMD, $AAPL, $NIO are going to continue to change the world and their innovation is why their value is going to keep climbing in the near and long term. The virus will not stop their business. We're not in a plague or apocalypse...keep this perspective. You've got a 50% discount on almost every stock and you're going to make 50% back within a month IMO...likely faster as many know the recent highs of TSLA and others that hit before the virus fear. No other reason for any of the price drops....no recalls, no product failures, no sensational fraud......all of these companies were and are at the top of their game. You are the market...so you decide the price of a stock. Buy and just hold. Never sell in a dip. It's really that simple. Keep buying and holding TSLA and AMD, AAPL, NIO...any others you believe in.

6603,"$TSLA $NIOI only bag on Trump because I voted for him in 2016. He's a smart business man and he promised many things that I thought would finally be acknowledged. And before you Trump supporters get mad, here's why. And you can come try to convince me to revote for him.1. He acknowledged the decline of the U.S dollar purchasing power. He also acknowledged that cronie capitalism was a thing, and that wallstreet was screwing over Americans. While we here are investors, I would give up a lot of my money if everyone jumped on the boat to be agaisnt cronie capitalism. This trade off is worth it. The biggest contradiction was that he uses things like GDP and the stock market to reflect Americas wellbeing. But that's exactly what he was agaisnt. I believe he did this in order to win votes and to please his supporters. But this goes exactly what he was agaisnt.2. Trade with China. In my honest opinion, I would have loved to see more pressure on China and their companies. Why? Even though I invest in companies like NIO and Baba. I only invest in Chinese companies I do extensive research on. To make Chinese companies listed on U.S stock exchanges abide by more rules is a great thing for Both Chinese companies and investors. You get more trust in the company. He did a poor job, with the trade war. Promised deficits, now it's at all time highs. I see no reason to believe this will not happen.3. The U.S debt. Debt effects everyone. And Trump acknowledged the debt and wanted to cut back and bring back jobs. Did he bring back jobs? No, the jobs created were low skill, low requirement jobs that were not necessarily needed by society. That is why the unemployment rate was hit so hard during the COVID-19. Because these jobs created were non essential for a reason. You get this when you increase our debt ""fake jobs and service based.""Is this Trumps fault? No.Large corporations have more power and decide where they hire people.Zoom is another step towards the solidification of outsourced remote work. So not only is our manufacturing being hit but our physical labor is too.Again, not Trumps fault, a problem in the making for decades.Trump has increased the debt by over 36% and will continue to do so. This is not okay because while Trumps supporters will be dead in 100 years. The future of America will have to pay for these things.If you expected China or any other nation to produce things for free, you're dead wrong.4. A win win or a lose lose:The U.S might still be NO.1. But this is being challenged tremendously. And if you don't believe me. Look outside, social unrest, distrust in the goverment, decline in political participation, tons of negative propaganda about China (this shows insecurity to me, not security. When you have to slander a threat rather than beat them shows WEAKNESS.)This is not Trump's fault. But Trump wants to participate in an unwinnable battle with China. Nope. You can't beat them. Because America is the people, not the clown politicians. And how are your people doing? More divided than ever (you win by working as a team and having structure, having social norms that allow strangers to have similar morals and beliefs), we are losing on metrics from wealth inequality, education, technology, SKILLED LABOR ( unemployment rate doesn't matter if you're raising a bunch of idiots that can't transition into the future.)To be fair, if Trump could be president till the day he dies. Perhaps maybe if he busted out the real facist side of him and acknowledged the real problems he did pre election. MAYBE then U.S would be a winner again or head in the right direction. People are so dumb that they need to be told what to do.And because Trump can't do this. It's a win win or a lose lose. You can't be NO.1 forever and history has proven that. Rome? Whatever, people these days have the attention span of a gold fish and are too busy swiping right that they can't even fathom the predicament we are in.We need to work with our allies and get China on board. If we don't everyone loses. This is how wars start. It's okay, you don't have to be number 1 forever, especially if you didn't ensure your place as no.1 by making the sacrifices you tool to get there. And this isn't Trumps fault. He acknowledged this pre election. But now, he has taken the wrong steps towards creating a better future. It's better off being a win win than a lose lose. I actually like Bidens approach to create skilled labor jobs and focus on education. We have to make the sacrifices now to ensure a better future. Why did America give up on investing in our future? Trump. You can't win the battle of capitalism and technocracy with China. They're leagues ahead and people in America are too stupid to realize that.5. Handling of the COVID-19. I don't know if the COVID-19 is real nor fake. But you had a good chance at unifying a divided country by separating petty differences. You didn't, you made the country more divided.",0.9963

They also sell solar panels & solar roof shingles that store power in power walls in your garage. I was a victim of the Texas power outages last week & I’m seriously thinking of buying a new roof with Tesla solar shingles & 4 Tesla power walls for my garage, so I can get off the grid & become energy independent. The power companies are going to be raising the rates for all Texas electricity customers because they just paid $9 per Kwh for 3 days when they normally pay $0.06 per Kwh. Those of us whom can afford to get off the grid & buy the Tesla roof & power stations will be making that investment instead of paying more for our electric company’s mismanagement of Texas power resources last week. This is why I invested in Tesla last week. I am similar to Warren Buffet in that I only invest in companies that make products or provide services that I’d actually buy. I wasn’t a huge fan of their cars, but I do plan to buy their solar shingles & power stations so I’ll never have to live through the blackouts I suffered through last week & because I don’t want to pay the higher rates for electricity over the next few years.
