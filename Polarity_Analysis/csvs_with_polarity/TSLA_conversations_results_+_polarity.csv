11,"Here is my latest forecast:In a very short time Musk will announce the total elimination of sales people. No Delivery Specialist. There will be Product Specialists available to ""assist"" customers. Every step of the sales process will be remote handled by a Central location....EVERY STEP. No discussions face-to-face, only by phone or through emails. It will be like shopping at a 7-Eleven. Pick your poison. Stand in line. Yep. This is what's become of the ""World-wide disruptor"".IMO, Tesla can no longer afford to pay store folks like professionals. They'll become glorified clerks. After all, the last job most all of them had was selling handbags at a Mall store. I'm not kidding. Every bit of sales talent remaining in Tesla walked out the door when McNeill took a hike. I think Musk takes over from here. Besides, I can't think of a sane, knowledgable sales guy in any part of the auto sector willing to take a chance with this bunch. It's a career-ender, IMO. Then again, every sales chief left with a ton of stock options they cashed in on. McNeill didn't need the money as he already had it. But Walker? Blankenship? The others? I don't think you zealots are thinking big picture here. You're so enamored with the hype you gladly sell your souls, those that have them! Certainly none of you has real money invested in Tesla as most all of you don't have the liquidity in the first place. You'll simply lie about it.",0.9128
12,Tesla car is great but well you don't see them dominating in the street in Europe. I see most EV cars in Europe are not tesla. In UK it's Toyota that's dominating. To justify current price they need to be absolutely dominating in entire world but I am not seeing it.,0.9037

25,"""Markets can remain irrational longer than one can stay solvent."" Most people know that Tesla is overvalued. But shorting it, especially in the short term is risky. If you are Long or Short, make sure it is less than 5% of your portfolio.Remember that only 5% of day traders make money in long run. And this crazy EV hype with small companies will end. Companies that will do with EV will likely be VW, GM, TM and others followed by $TSLA. I would touch $NIO, LI etc with a 10 foot pole.

JUST LIKE APPLE WITH LAPTOP AND PHONE TESLA ECHO SYSTEM. THE TESLA APP STORE WILL BE DEVELOPED ALSO. THIS 800 price doesn’t have the Tesla battery packs either for your home. Tesla is building a whole new world that millennials want to be a part of and in some ways they are more powerful then Apple. The Tesla consumer is die hard The solar roof is just like the model s when it came out...expensive...and when ppl realize what a value a energy producing roof is...they will flock to it.....and when they do it will allot Tesla to lower prices Stay long 1000 would still be under valuing the expansion that is about to occur with Tesla BUY THE DIP.

70,"Hello followers and happy new year. I have been on an extended holiday, and have just returned. I have analyzed thoroughly and see that TSLA is sitting in the perfect position for the ""ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTIES"" ( the option mm's and their followers/players) to effect the VERY significant , most significant in fact option unwind in the history of TSLA. You see that this friday , the JAN 15 options will expire. These were the former leap options that have been around for a couple of years or so, so they naturally have a lot of open interest , but in fact, they have more open interest than ANY series of options that TSLA has experienced EVER. So much interest , that if you choose the strike price which renders the LOWEST dollar value of ALL the combined options outstanding for JAN 15 expiry added together. ( what all the calls and puts of the whole series would be worth if TSLA closes at that strike price), they would still be worth $14.3 BILLION . That compares with the analgous figure of $380 million for the Jan 22 expiration , a small percentage of the dollar open interest of the jan 15 exp. At yesterday's close of aprox $850, the jan 15 options would be worth aprox $22.6 BILLION . Now I have seen TSLA swallow $2 BILLION of change from the LDV without trouble when it has news or huge momentum, but never has it had to swallow such a difference before. It is going to be interesting to see this expiration. Have fun my followers!",0.9938
71,This is what happens when a CEO gambles his company's future in Bitcoin. Musk just opened another way to short Tesla. Musk put a his chips on the table and is now getting called. So how much does Tesla lose if Bitcoin falls back to $3000?,0.6102

76,"Tesla is headed to the mid to high $500's. WHY !!? Because we counted out GM, F, VW, Toyota and Honda a bit quick i think!. Keep in mind that Legacy car companies did not start to compete with Tesla until this year 2021, before they were still hoping Tesla might fail but have all but given up on that and now and are 100% behind EVs tech. So the competition has really only started this year. When values were calculated for Tesla 2022-30 we all just assumed they would just double their sales for ever! .. or at least until 2030, but that actually seems ""impossible"" now that the sleeping giants of the car industry have awakened. PS. GM, F, VW, and others are outselling Teslas in China, Germany, Norway and the EU. with this in mind we need to be more modest about 2022 - 30 sales and this re calculation will have a pull back in Teslas ""perceived value"" I personally think the Top was. $800-$850 and we will slowly travel back to the high $500 over 2021 as sales figures come in for the EV/ice companies. Assuming that someone who has bought 4 GMs (or F,VW etc...) in a row is going to buy a Tesla are just plain wrong. Legacy car companies currently have 98% of the car market, assuming that somehow that will be gifted to Tesla is also wrong",0.9716
77,"Tesla stock at $700 is fundamentally undervalued relative to the company’s long-term earnings growth potential in the massive transportation, solar energy generation and renewable energy storage end-markets.The technicals underlying TSLA stock imply that shares are close to a near-term bottom, and will soon reverse course back into a healthy long-term uptrend.",0.9433

Oil will still have its place for a long time! None the less, Oil was a vehicle to get us to where we are today. Now we are entering a new Phase of humanity.

Busses, Ships, Planes, Tractor Trailers, Trucks, Cars etc. Supporting Doc, (https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11356594/himalayas-visible-india-coronavirus-pollution/ ) There is Winter again (which I predicted late last April) in the northern hemisphere! Texas!? Ask any avid Snow Machiner, Snowboarder or Skier How their experiences making Powder turns has been over past 7 yrs!! VS this winter!! Alaska is colder this winter. Hopefully This will lower the ocean temperatures so the salmon can continue their amazing journey to their spawning grounds. These are just a few benefits of lowering carbon emissions. Farming I am predicting will see a significant growing season this yr. Yes there will be some flooding in areas however with lower carbon levels in the air the micro #Climate change will assist the farmers to uphold a better farming season. I incourage investors to do their part and find companies that are working hard to implement great changes for the upcoming leap for humanity! I am not a financial advisor. Better our Planet!",0.9976

Most people buy old used cars and there aren't many used Tesla cars. The cost and resale value of Tesla will probably be high and the cost of insurance is the highest among cars of similar cost.

This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound.

They realize the EVs threat is going to come faster than even they expected. Proof: Tesla continues expansion into China and German factory locations. But here's the biggest IMO: in April 2020, $TSLA will hold their Battery Day event and I expect Tesla to announce their accomplishments over the past year since they acquired several technologies to help improve battery range dramatically. We could see a 30% improvement in range in Tesla vehicles coming out after April and on top of that, we will see a reduction for price to drop below $100 per kilowatt hour. This will be huge. I believe TSLA pps will go from today's low of $600 drive the price up past $1000. The oil sellers realized they don't have much time left as profits will drop significantly for them within 3-5 years as the world will have a massive EV transition. 5 years is what I give all other auto manufacturers to finally have EV models that will also be successfully selling to compete with TSLA to a degree, but this will be a bigger blow to the oil industry....not kill it.....but significant pain to their profits. In the past couple of weeks, you had one of the biggest auto makers announce they are fully committed to EVs more than ever....GM. Oil saw this too and after they had their emergency meetings to deal with a crisis that will start for their industry sooner than they expected, they foolishly decided cutting oil prices will help scramble for as much profits as possible for the few years left for them to take advantage of their monopoly over the auto industry.

In an interview with Barron's in early 2020, Baron said he expected the electric-vehicle to reach 1.5 trillion market value by 2030. Tesla stock soared more than 740% last year and is now halfway to that valuation. It also is the biggest driver by far, of the 149% gain for the $7.1 billion Baron's Partners Fund (BPTRX) which beat the Russel 3000 by 128 percentage points.The Baron Partners fund began buying Tesla in 2014. It last purchase was in Feb 2016 for less than $40 per share. The stock is now $850. Co-managers Ron and Michael Baron have trimmed the funds on Tesla position since then. At the beginning of 2020, it had grown about 17%, The fund sold 20% of its stake throughout 2020 but the stock rose so quickly that by the end of the year, nearly half of the funds assets were invested in Tesla. We are more confident in Tesla's business fundamentals than we were at the time of our first purchase says Michael Baron, adding that the firm is nonetheless mindful of portfolio concentration.",0.9804

Competition is coming.Good luck as these realizations come to the fore.(It is also worth noting that the operating costs for the new facilities has not yet started to accumulate, but the company's growth in unit sales (61%) contained a significantly larger portion of ever cheaper cars and Tesla's market share continues to dwindle due to both competition based on feature/function as well as price.).

Was just excelling around with the last 30 days trading data trying to give myself a better feel on the 30 day chart, here's what I found.Using Yahoo data - over the past month, 1,122,874,238 shares traded. 1.12 BILLION! Average daily volume of about 51 million shares traded.Not sure what the public float (tradeable shares) is post split, if anyone knows that number it would be a nice one to know.Those 1.12 billion shares were bought and sold at an average price of $573.85. I didn't use the average closing price for the day to arrive at that number, for each day I averaged the day high and low, then averaged that price over the past 30 days to calculate that number.From that, I would expect there to be a sh#t ton of support at $573 should we ever need it, lol. As I type this it's about to go through $649. So.....the shorts would like you to believe the sky is about to fall. Some overpaid analyst would even like you to believe the stock price is going to about zero soon.A drop to $573 from the ATH....is 12%. Barely a haircut, and hair grows back.And we are currently trading less than 1% below the ATH price.And tomorrow and Monday, the SP500 funds need to acquire roughly 112 million shares, by my calculations. Or roughly 2x average daily volume over the past 30 days.Plus all the other good stuff coming - deliveries number (expect a beat) , Q4 numbers (expect a beat), whatever new or refreshed that's going to roll off the S and X lines after the retool, and 6 months later we have Berlin and Austin bearing fruit.Just my take - limited downside to $573 at worst on the speculated 'dip' some are talking about.

Rather, they drop the price through discounts to monetize the car and raise cash, but take a loss on the car ( Hurts GAAP earnings)The Balance Sheet is overstated... the inventory is too high and only way to move cars quickly is to incent people. Tax credits are gone ( Ontario) or are dropping off quickly due to Tesla hitting 200K mark for US tax credits.., a perfect storm against Tesla profits.I would really appreciate others on this thread going out to their local Tesla store, look at Model 3 and S/X inventory available through the sales reps Tesla system ( just say you want a car within 2 weeks or so.. they’ll show you inventory)Also, I plan to keep watching for the first October production Model 3 to land in Toronto. Then, by asking enough customers when they ordered the Model 3, we can get a sense of whether Tesla is still filling backlog, or now filling very short term orders.Once I see only September or October orders being delivered, I know backlog is exhausted, then, by counting new deliveries per week we get a good sense of ongoing Model 3 demand. My intuition and the fact there are 33 inventory Model 3s in Toronto available for sale ( I could have one in 5 business days if I found one that I liked the combo of FWD/AWD, colour and wheels, I could have it by next Friday! ). That means either:1. Previous customers have walked away from their orders ( probably due to loss of Ontario tax credits)2. Tesla is keeping production numbers > actual demand and building inventory.., most people look at weekly production numbers and ASSUME that means that is equal to actual demand... what if Tesla now building cars in excess of actual orders ( like most car companies do).., big difference is Tesla does not have financial strength to play the inventory holding game!!!! Anyway, Canada and Toronto does not tell the whole picture. Dallas was a partial corroboration of my findings. If others can gather info from their local Tesla store ( take an hour or two o time), a bigger picture will emerge.I am a short via Puts. But I gather real data to confirm or refute my thesis. So far, my thesis about inventory seems to be on point!",0.9956

All of the other ca makers sell millions of profitable vehicles and can sell EV s at a loss almost indefinitely. 6.) Tesla depends on EVs. January 2018 (((( When BMW AG revealed it was designing electric versions of its X3 SUV and Mini, the going rate for 21 kilograms of cobalt—the amount of the metal needed to power typical car batteries—was under $600. Only 16 months later, the price tag is approaching $1,700 and climbing by the day. ))))2018(( A big part of the GM plan is altering the chemistry of its EV batteries to eliminate cobalt, the most expensive component used in today’s batteries and one whose price on the world market is rising rapidly. ))(*) The actual cost disadvantage is unknown. The $1,000 figure comes from Bloomberg there is not way to verify it. (**) Most long term contracts provide for material cost increases. In the case of Panasonic and Tesla one of these parties has likely taken on the risk. If Panasonic offered Tesla a fixed price for the cells then Panasonic priced the risk into the cells. If there is a clause in the contract that allows Panasonic to pass along material price increases - then Tesla will pay more for the cells. Of course, either party can hedge Cobalt prices in the short term. Panasonic would have hedged Cobalt for the duration of the contract with Tesla. One way Panasonic might hedge the price of Cobalt would be with a long term contract with their suppliers. If Panasonic can contractually pass on price increases to Tesla based on commodity prices then Panasonic might go for a long term contract with their suppliers to get lower prices. And now Panasonic can increase prices to Tesla even though they are not paying more for Cobalt.",0.9909

The results, for auto makers, were pretty good -- unless you were Tesla.Fifteen EVs were tested, and just four auto makers made it into the 300-mile-on-a-single-charge club: Ford Motor(F) , Hyundai Motor(HYMLF) , Porsche Automobil Holding (PAH3.Germany), and Tesla (TSLA). Having Tesla on the list isn't the surprise to investors. The EV pioneer has been building EVs for more than a decade, and the company boasted about breaking the 400-mile-per-charge barrier this past June.The surprise is how poorly Tesla vehicles performed compared with EPA estimated ranges. ""Every Tesla we've tested has failed to hit its EPA range estimate,"" reads the Edmund's press release.Tesla and Edmunds weren't immediately available to comment on the findings.A Tesla 2018 Model 3 performance edition was supposed to get 310 miles a charge. Edmunds got 256 miles. A 2020 Model 3 standard range was supposed to get a range of 250 miles. Edmunds got 232 miles. A 2020 Tesla Model X long range was supposed to get 328 miles. Edmunds got 294 miles. A 2020 Tesla Model Y performance configuration was supposed to get 291 miles of range. Edmunds got 263 miles.Edmunds got 318 miles of range from the Tesla 2020 Model S performance vehicle tested. That's the model that put Tesla in the 300-mile range club. The EPA estimated range for that vehicle is 326 miles of range on a single charge.Tesla vehicles tested, on average, scored about 9% worse than predicted range. The other 10 EVs beat expected range by an average of about 19%.",0.9814

(I saw this link on my cell phone earlier today. Hat tip to whoever posted it then.)tesla had been slowly inviting reservation holders to configure and order their Model 3 vehicles in waves, based on factors like ownership status and geographical location. The company invited all reservation holders to order in late June, which would seemingly open a floodgate of new orders. Just yesterday, the company abandoned its reservation system altogether, and anyone in North America is now welcome to configure and order a Model 3 -- no reservation required.The timing of those events strongly suggests that order conversion rates among Model 3 reservation holders is rather poor, since if a significant proportion of reservation holders were placing orders, Tesla would already have its work cut out to produce and deliver those orders. Tesla still has approximately 420,000 Model 3 reservations.Responding to criticism about cutting off an analyst during a recent earnings call, CEO Elon Musk had said that it would take Tesla two years to ""satisfy existing demand.""But that would require a 100% order conversion rate, and Musk tends to incorrectly equate reservations (with refundable deposits) with sales. Customer deposits represented a third of Tesla's cash position at the end of the first quarter. The answer to RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak's question on Model 3 order conversion rates is of utmost concern to investors right about now, but only Tesla has that information and Musk refuses to share it.The evidence is mounting Last month, Second Measure Research estimated that the order conversion rate was a mere 8%. https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/07/11/walk-ins-welcome-anyone-can-now-order-a-tesla-mode.aspx",0.662

Plus they still need to support all their ICE vehicles for a while. As an example, Ford who are still making ICE vehicles, let say they stop producing them in 2026. So the last cars they sold in 2026 need to get support (parts manufactured) for at least 10 years. This is ONE of the reason why Tesla is so far ahead.

1455,"In the latest delivery report released on Thursday, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) beat most analysts' delivery estimates by handing ownership over to about 88,400 customers in Q1 (Form 8-K filing is here). This was, as expected, a record for any 1st quarter. It easily beat 1Q19 since Model 3 deliveries did not begin in Europe and China until mid-February last year, so Tesla's numbers benefited this year from worldwide deliveries of Model 3 for the entire month of January and early February.However, the ratio of vehicles built versus delivered in the quarter was the worst since 1Q19. While Tesla indeed delivered 88,400 units, it represented 86% of the total production of 102,672 vehicles resulting in a surplus of 14,272 units. Combined with excess inventory from prior quarters, Tesla's unsold inventory spiked to 26,961 units, an increase of 112% from 4Q19.First, we can see the huge increase in unsold units that soared 120%. Part of this increase occurred in China in Jan/Feb where Model 3 deliveries were 83% of production (5,487 deliveries vs. 6,583 units produced. We are still a few weeks away from verifiable March numbers). Europe also appears to have ended with a large surplus inventory. During the quarter, seven ships transported units to Zeebrugge, Belgium with a few continuing on to Southampton, England. TeslaMotorsClub.com member Troy does an excellent job of pulling verifiable data together to track most European sales. For Q1, his spreadsheet (here) shows 22,728 deliveries which are almost identical to 2019 at 22,759. Norway and The Netherlands have been replaced in the top spot by the U.K. This may not account for other smaller EU markets. But if each ship carried an average of 4,000 Tesla vehicles, we can see that a good portion of these unsold units is probably sitting in Europe, waiting to be delivered to buyers in Q2 due to the coronavirus shutdowns in many of those countries.Second, in the press release last week, Tesla oddly chose to combine Model 3 with Model Y production and delivery figures. Some would think they did this to hide relatively low figures for Model Y out the gate. But if we look back to 3Q17, in the above chart, Tesla had no problem reporting just a few hundred cars in Model 3's initial quarter. It would seem Tesla is actually trying to mask the severe drop in Model 3 global sales which were the worst in a year since Q1 2019. That number last year was unusually low for several reasons. First, 4Q18 marked the end of the full $7,500 FITC in the U.S. which pulled Q1 sales forward into Q4. Second, Model 3 deliveries in both China and Europe did not begin until about halfway through the quarter in mid-February. This, of course, made 1Q20 deliveries look better in a YoY comparison.It has been and still is my belief that moving the introduction of the Model Y forward to March from later in the year was due to the slowing of orders for the Model 3 and to fill a drop in revenue that Tesla has known was coming in the first half of 2020. This became very clear last year when total U.S. revenue dropped $2.2 billion from 2018 levels.",0.9865

1644,"There is a problem with Solar City. As much as I like green technology, and am concerned about global warming, I have not personally invested in a home solar system. I used to feel bad about that. My excuses were 'lame' practical things like my house is already built, and there are some ""sleeping dogs"" in it's 60 year old electrical system that it's best not to wake. That and the fact that I understand solar energy in principle, but I have no idea who makes the best panels or most reliable inverters, and I have no rational basis to chose a contractor to outsource these worries to. I don't want to lease a system from Solar City, but I also don't want to buy a bunch of hardware to discover that it is becoming obsolete or has hidden reliability issues. Those excuses might be lame, but I've decide that they are legitimate and probably not unique to me. Thinking about the big picture, it is clear that home solar was a transitional technology. It was useful for small demonstration projects to prove the technology, but it won't scale. The issue is that valuing the power at retail rates, whether it is being bought or sold, does not compensate the power company for the valuable service it provides as a regulator and market-maker for electricity.Again, this was fine for small demo projects, where the amount of power involved was just noise to the power company, but the recent cuts in Nevada's incentives for home solar -- and Solar City's petulant flounce out to that market -- show that power companies can't and won't provide this free service to everyone if home solar goes mainstream. But Solar City's business model assumes these government incentives will continue.Something has to break.As the cost of solar tech drops, the fixed overhead -- in terms of engineering, sales, tech support, permit processing, government inspections, retrofit installations, etc -- of tiny demo home demo projects will becomes prohibitive.For solar power to scale, it has to transition from home systems to larger installations with the economies of scale to better carry the overhead. Ultimately, acres and acres of cheap desert land will be paved over with large solar farms. Perhaps, as a transition technology, we'll see regional solar installations such as shade structures in airport parking lots, or larger scale point of use solar systems for big flat roofed commercial buildings. But they will be measured in mega-watts. KW scale systems are inherently expensive toys. We simply can't value large quantities of solar electricity production at the retail rate. It has to be priced wholesale. Even that is being generous, since a natural gas fired 'peaker' produces power that is inherently much more valuable, since the operator can control *when* it gets produced.In short, Solar City's model of massively scaling up home solar production is fundamentally flawed. It counts on government incentives to overvalue the electricity produced. Those incentives were the right policy, and did their job to get the solar revolution started, by making demonstration projects possible, but they were never intended to scale.The Solar industry and utility companies will need to think through what to do for the next step. I still think solar power is the long term solution, but building millions of tiny power plants, each one essentially a one-off prototype, with only an ignorant part-time manager (the home owner) is a stupid way to execute.",0.9997

1777,"Rumor: Tesla Model 2 Already Developed in China & Goes to Production in 2022On January 8, information was leaked from the Chinese media that Tesla had already developed a new car model, and would soon be ready to begin production at its Giga Shanghai. The affordable compact car is expected to be produced and delivered in 2022.According to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, some of the best works of art in the world were created in China, so he believes that projects created in China will also be popular around the world. The Chinese have always been distinguished by originality, speed, and intelligence, so China is a great place to develop, create, and implement the most original and unexpected solutions.At the ceremony of handing over the first made-in-China Model 3s to owners, which took place on January 7, 2020, in Shanghai, Musk announced that Tesla plans to establish its own R&D center in China, where the company will create a car for the whole world. Musk said:“Something that would be super cool...so we’re going to do it...is to try to create a China to actually design an original car in China for worldwide consumption. I think this will be very exciting.""As early as mid-January 2020, Tesla began recruiting employees for the new development center and called on them to help the company build Chinese-style cars.Today, the Chinese media, citing reliable sources, reported that the new Tesla car model already was approved as early as September 2020. Product verification is expected to be completed in March 2021, with production and first deliveries scheduled to begin in 2022. Tesla will build its new model at Giga Shanghai.According to sources, the chassis of the car is based on the Model 3 chassis, which will also speed up and simplify the start of production. Perhaps this is what made it possible to develop a new model so quickly. Estimated price will range from RMB150,000 to RMB200,000 ($25,000 - $30,000).When Tesla opened recruitment for the R&D center in mid-January 2020, the team used an image of an interesting new concept car. We've never seen anything like it before. Whether Tesla will develop something similar at the new Chinese R&D center, or it's just a picture that has nothing to do with Tesla's future projects, we do not know. But the new China-made model is sure to be as stunning as the entire Chinese Tesla project.Good luck and GOD bless,",0.9984

1834,"There has been a lot of hope and hype about growth for Tesla, but I suspect that a lot of it is misplaced. We now know that almost their entire growth last year was around China. Their sales in Europe were down for the year, and outside of China, any growth was modest or a result of entering a new market.The problem is that much of that growth has been (continually) at the expense of reputation, with consumers and regulatory bodies. The quality of their cars has come into question in Europe (see Netherlands taxi cab story), In the US (see stories about recalls in US) and now China (see stories about Tesla risks wearing out welcome in China). Now there are even reports that highlight the (long known) fact that Tesla has been hyping their range. Now there is serious competition and it is growing rapidly just as the 'wow' factor for Tesla is wearing off. What will be interesting to watch is when the same 'wow' factor wears off on the share price. Of course a move from $900 to $800 isn't really a sign of that yet, but a break down to $600 or $500 would be a pretty serious outcome.The lack of profits and declining margins on growing sales was a warning shot. When sales start to stabilize and profits still don't show up, well, investors may take notice. (And when I say investors, I don't mean day traders and swing traders. I mean investors who are buying into the idea that Tesla has some sort of magic battery or secret cool factor.These things only last so long . . . In Europe's top markets, Tesla had 10% share last quarter, and while the data for this quarter is way, way too early, Tesla currently makes up just 2.5% of the market. No one company has to be better than Tesla when 9 out of every 10 EVs is sold by other companies. The number of models (and companies) is growing rapidly and Tesla laid the foundation for that sea change.Good luck with your decisions, but the bloom may be off the rose.Guru.",0.9965

That comes to $1.8B. At June they had $2.2B of cash and are burning close to $1B per quarter. Tough math.Musk says shareholders won't be forced to sell. How does that work?

2282,"There are two very different schools of thought clashing over the $TSLA valuation. On one hand, the old school - Buffett, Bury, etc. with their eyes always on present-day fundamentals, on the other hand Cathie Wood who's all about scouting for 'exponential growth' potential.These are all very smart people, but what if old-school financial conservatism is tantamount to short-sightedness in the high-tech age? After all, Buffet did miss the Big Tech boat in the early 2000s. The outcome of the argument might have a big influence on how we value stocks in the future. If Wood's valuation model is proven right, it may have massive ramifications in the markets.One of Wood's main points is that, in industries exposed to disruption by AI, holders of the most relevant data (used to train AI models) will have a decisive competitive advantage. This is her main reason for judging that other EVs will not be able to compete on fully-autonomous for years, by which time Tesla would capture the market.How do you marry this with traditional benchmarks and how do you even figure out the quantity and quality of data held by companies?

After a climax run, comes a BIG pullback.P/E ratio- all time highP/S ratio- all time highRSI- off by one point from 2013 all time highTesla expected to make 31B in revenue but has a 800B market cap!! If anyone can find any other stock that has ever done this in the history of stocks (tech, auto, whatever) please give me the name. Apple disrupted the cell phone market when they developed the first touch screen iPhone (35B in revenue at the time - 175B market cap), Amazon disrupting brick and mortar business (amongst all other things)(had a 3600 p/e at one point but were making 55-60B in revenue and had a ~150B market cap), Google- I’m sure you’ve heard of them (highest p/e they ever had was around mid 50s), Netflix disrupting streaming business (traded at a about 450 P/E at their highest, while making close to 4B in revenue and had a 45B market cap- highest PS ratio of about 12). So just compare Tesla to any other major tech company and you’ll see the insane overvaluation here (even though as it stands Tesla makes most of their money from selling cars!). Up close to 900% since March. People need to get a close look and see that numbers like that can only be compared to .com bubble. Welcome to the EV bubble. You have companies like NKLA with no revenue valued close to 10B. There’s a new EV company every other day and competition is EVERYWHERE. Tesla could sit at this price for the next 3-5 (or more) years and still be grossly overvalued.Reality is Tesla is expected to make 31B this year, 45B next year and 65B in 2023. With this growth, fair value they should be around 300-400B market cap and that’s still being very generous. Don’t worry, there was plenty of blind FOMO buyers in the .com bubble as well. They would speak the same language as the pumpers here. Keep in mind that it took investors 10-15 years to make their money back (and that’s if they invested in amazon). Looks like history will repeat itself. This coming earnings report should do the job! Y’all better hope they smash expectations by at least 100%! Since they barely met 2020 delivery expectations, I expect a modest beat at best, then let the massive selling begin (sell the news)!Leaving off with this. On 12/3 Musk stated to his employees that Tesla needs “to cut costs or the firm's stock price could be “crushed like a soufflé under a sledgehammer.” - that was around 550$ SP. Well we’re now ~55% higher and I am sure Tesla didn’t magically make any drastic changes to their cost cutting within a month. Should be a big warning sign ",0.9957

Even if Tesla just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

Both innovative and massively growth companies, that are literally everywhere. When they had 600+B market caps, they were raking in 100s of billions of dollars and more profits than what Tesla makes. Meanwhile, Tesla is expected to hit 30B in revenue for 2020 Qs and 45B in revenue by the end of this year. Very understandable that Musk and Tesla are revolutionary, but so was Apple. When they released the first iPhone in 07, was Apple trading at a p/e of 1500+ and 27x sales?! This isn’t a growth company that’s expected to triple their revenue this year. They had a 26% increase in revenue from last year and are expected to increase 45% by the end of this year. Solid growth, but this evaluation is just insane and reality will hit.

If any of you here think this is a viable idea and you can move it up the attention chain, please do. Here's what I am proposing:1. Increase the strength of Tesla's survival cells to be equal to or greater than an F1 car. I know this initially sounds crazy, but the Tesla material science team has already made new alloys, and the SpaceX engineers are also world class material scientists. I bet they can make a composite honeycomb that could at least triple the current survival cell strength without increasing weight. 2. In a highway pileup situation where tractor trailers are unsighted (fog, dust storm, snow storm, a hill, a curve, etc.) Tesla Autopilot could could send a geofenced alert to a free phone app that would warn everyone within a mile of stopped highway traffic with a unique alarm sound. 3. Use the 360 degree array of sensors to detect side or rear collisions and sound an alarm, pretension the seat belts, preposition the headrests and maybe, if it is helpful - deploy one or more external kevlar airbags to optimally increase the surface area of the collision and direct the forces in a manner that the safety cell is most effective.",0.9904

There is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years. World auto production in 2019 was 91,786,861.

The Trump is more desperate than ever to artificially fix markets...and Powell can't think straight either. This is the bloody streets that many waited for on the sidelines...bloodier than anyone expected. While many sectors have been impacted by the virus slowing down their businesses, consumers are spending less on smaller luxury purchases and just focusing on necessities. One necessity is still an automobile and anyone who was planning to get a new car, is still going to get a Tesla. Consumers that had a Model Y reserved are still going to take delivery on time....they're even going to likely get a better financing rate as well. So while there will a significant reduction in consumer wants-spending at malls, stores, and any other personal items that aren't a true need....I believe Teslas will keep rolling out of showrooms. And if you're one of the people that have a Tesla on order...investing in TSLA now will help pay for your Tesla. The key is to keep your mind focused on the long term rewards with TSLA and other tech stocks that took a hit.

Keep in mind...the outlook at $TSLA, $AMD, and many others has not changed at all....they are still focused on long term goals and companies have taken huge steps to keep their employees safe. Their products will continue to sell. Volatility is always temporary. Buy the bottom and keep holding. TSLA is still a $1500+ target for 2020.

A 1,500 kwh battery pack would have a mass of 8,000 kg (about 17,600 pounds) and a volume of 7,000 liters (about 247 cubic feet).1,500 kwh translates to about 2,010 horsepower-hours. Odd units, but useful. A 1,000 horsepower electric motor could operate for two hours at full throttle, long enough to get between two Supercharger stations about 100 miles apart.Build a short trailer, maybe 10 feet or less, and fill it with battery packs. Hook it up immediately behind the cab and then hook the tandem trailer, with the payload, behind it. A 20,000 pound trailer would account for about 25% of the maximum allowable loaded weight of the truck.The driver would hop from one Supercharger station to another. At each, the driver would unhook the battery trailer and swap it for a fully charged trailer, leaving the discharged battery trailer to recharge for the next driver to stop.Multiple charging bays and battery trailers would be needed since a 1,500 kwh battery would require at least 12.5 hours to fully recharge at the 120 kw rate of a Supercharger. Figure on having at least one battery trailer at each Supercharger station for each EV truck which stops during the day.OTR trucking companies would love the free fuel. They may not be so keen on losing 25% of the load capacity of the truck by weight or lost time to unhook a battery trailer every two hours and hook another in its place instead of driving 750 miles or more before needing to fill up with 150 gallons of #2 diesel fuel.",0.9939

3109,"MAJID and $nio, Despite the incredible longevity of the Tesla battery, there are those Tesla owners who still may want their car battery replaced once they begin to see performance decline. While Tesla does not recommend battery replacement, there are a few options regarding battery replacement.The first option is to pay out of pocket for your battery replacement. According to Interesting Engineering, the replacement cost for a Tesla battery is anywhere between $3,000 and $7,000. The price of a battery replacement is mostly dependent on the model and age of the vehicle, but there is good news regarding replacing the batteries in a Tesla.First, the entire battery pack doesn't need to be replaced. Elon Musk designed the Tesla so that should the need ever arise for a battery to be replaced, it wouldn't require any wasted effort or capital. To replace the car battery in a Tesla, only the battery modules need to be replaced and not the entire battery pack, as is the case with most other electric vehicles.The second option for replacing a battery in a Tesla is to have it covered by warranty. You may have heard of Tesla's warranty guarantees ""infinite mile"" coverage, but that is only on the drive unit itself, i.e., the actual body of the car. The infinite mile guarantee is a relatively new Tesla policy that retroactively covers all previously manufactured Teslas as well. This first of its kind warranty was spurred by a chain of events wherein multiple Tesla models were running into problems with longevity regarding substantial parts within the drive unit. But the one part of the car that never faltered was the battery.The Tesla battery is under warranty for eight years, or 50,000 miles, whichever comes first. As you may recall 50,000 miles is typically when Tesla's begin to show the first signs of gradual failure. While some consumers point to the 50,000-mile mark as a point of contention, most Tesla owners never even notice a change in their battery's ability.Overall, the battery capacity of the Tesla is significantly more impressive and more durable than its predecessors and contemporaries. The Tesla battery is a feat of modern engineering that seems to be one of the company's greatest achievements. All indications from Tesla, whether it's a snippet of early press, or the recent ""infinite mile"" claim, point to their battery technology as being far and away superior to other cars.",0.9981

As part of the policy, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets. Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt. Digital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale. As we currently intend to hold these assets long-term, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase.",0.9911

3197,"Okay, I know the popular line is oil is dead...but is it really realistic to say a product with 95 million barrels per day in global demand (and quickly rising back to 100 mm BPD) is dead?Secondly, the oil companies have developed a huge business and engineering infrastructure that will help them in the transition to green energy over the couple of decades.The investment thesis is as follows:Intro- Oil production is lower than global demand as evidenced by the lower trend of US & Chinese oil stocks. Going forward oil supply will be constrained by government policies to encourage investment in green energy, however, due to global reliance on fossil fuels, oil demand is not projected to fall until 2055 - it will continue to grow at around 2% per year. Thesis-The combination of decreased production and rising demand create the catalyst for the final long term secular bull market in the oil and gas industry with prices between $100-$150 starting in 2023. Details-Diversify your recent gains into the oil & Nat gas sector while the market is undervalued. The Green energy transition is limiting oil supply through government policy. Demand is rising as Covid cases are dropping and vaccines are rolled out. See the US IEA inventory report and the China inventory report.Secondly refer to the recent Goldman Sachs report about the start of the secular bull market in oil. Expect $100-$150 oil beginning in 2023 through 2040.The cash flow generated by these prices will drive further innovation in green energy from oil companies and further result in the strategic buyout of wind and solar companies by the existing oil industry.An example of this trend is $OXY. They have developed the worlds first carbon neutral crude and the world’s most advanced carbon capture and sequestration technology. Warren Buffett owns OXY preferred. Today you can buy excellent companies or ETFs with high distributors at 1/2 price.$GEL for $6.00; $ET for $6.00; $OXY for $21 or $XLE for $41.Take some profits and invest in oil companies. It’s the only undervalued market sector remaining. The bull oil market is here for the next 12-15 years.",0.9943

3220,"Observations about @elonmusk's $420 LBO announcement:First, the context is odd: Musk promised on the conference call that $TSLA will be forever profitable. So why does he need to go private to ""end negative propaganda from shorts""? And why let them off the hook at $420?Musk suggests there will be no controlling shareholder in the LBO. He also says financing is already arranged. Ergo, he implies a syndicate of lenders has already signed documents for the deal. This is odd for two reasons...First, Musk recently rebuffed an investment offer from Saudi Arabia. If you're passing the hat for the largest LBO syndicate in history, why say no to a big check?Second, a $70B syndicate would involve numerous banks, dozens of lawyers, and multiple boards of directors. It's been [over] 12 hours since the announcement, and none of these parties has confirmed Musk's claims.Which raises a general point: a $70B dollar deal is a Jupiter-sized briar patch of legal and regulatory rules. It's a minutely choreographed thing, with legal risk for any party that says or does the wrong thing at the wrong time. With that in mind:Why did $TSLA not request a trading halt until an hour after Musk's tweet? Why did the company belatedly post an email from Musk, rather than an official statement? Why did Tesla not file an 8-K disclosing details of the purported LBO?Musk says he will not sell in the deal. What about his ~$800M in margin loans? Will lenders accept illiquid collateral? What about change of control provisions on $TSLA's debt? Who will fund the mandatory tender? Why did Musk's initial tweets portray this as a done deal, if his subsequent email revealed it to be merely his intention?Were these plans in the works when Musk publicly predicted a ""short burn of the century"" and a short squeeze larger than Volkswagen? Were they in the works when he aggressively purchased $TSLA shares in the premarket?If this deal is real, it won't be wrapped up for at least 6 months, and probably longer: a) need to assemble an independent board to vote on the deal (a court ruling this year decided that $TSLA's board is not independent of Musk), b) need a proxy statement with extensive risk disclosures (some think this is why $TSLA couldn't take the Saudi PIPE in the first place), c) need a shareholder vote, d) need antitrust review, even if perfunctory.Meanwhile, cash burn continues - in order to avoid default on their ABL, they must have cash/avail on Jan 1, 2019 sufficient to cover both 2019 convert maturities as well as a $400M buffer. That comes to $1.8B. At June they had $2.2B of cash and are burning close to $1B per quarter. Tough math.Musk says shareholders won't be forced to sell. How does that work? A private company with thousands of shareholders is still required to make SEC filings. How will unaccredited investors retain shares?The fact that none of these details was alluded to by Musk is further evidence that Musk has not discussed the deal with lawyers. Which brings us back to the question: how do you line up $70B in financing without involving a legal team?",0.9902

The valuation is the biggest bubble ever and will cost many shareholders big losses....-90% is my prediction. Jan 20 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's vehicle registrations in the U.S. state of California jumped nearly 63% during the fourth quarter compared with last year, largely due to the success of the company's Model Y, according to data from Cross-Sell https://info.cross-sell.com/tesla-special-report-0, a research firm that collates title and registration data.The automaker reported better-than-expected 2020 vehicle deliveries earlier this month, driven by a steady rise in electric vehicle adoption, even though it narrowly missed its ambitious full-year goal of half a million deliveries during a punishing year for the global auto industry.The report released on Wednesday showed registrations in California, a bellwether for the electric carmaker and its largest U.S. market, recovered from a third-quarter low of about 16,200 vehicles to around 22,117 vehicles in the three months ended December.At about 11,417, registrations in the state for Tesla's Model Y compact crossover utility vehicle surpassed those for the Model 3. California registrations for Tesla's Model 3 mass-market sedan fell 34% on a yearly basis to 7,044.Total fourth-quarter vehicle registrations in the 23 states, where data was collected, stood at 44,749, with Model Y accounting for nearly half the registrations.Registration figures might not accurately reflect the number of vehicle deliveries during the quarter as registrations in the United States typically take about 30 days from the time of sale.Tesla, whose shares surged over 700% in 2020, is expected to report fourth-quarter results after market close on Jan. 27.

3359,"Many try to diminish the importance of Norway's sales data, but I think that is a mistake. Here are some data and insights.Norway has about 5.3MM people in totalThey have about 2.8MM passenger cars registered.To date Norwegians have purchased about 372,041 EVs (about 13%)This makes Norway, the biggest adopter of EVs in the world. There is a strong argument to be made that this little country is a useful model for what might happen in other countries as EVs are adopted competition increases.To date, Tesla has sold 58,915 of all EVs sold including:111 Roadsters13,829 Model X21,120 Model S23,855 Model 3Its worth noting that the bulk of sales happened before there was any significant competition. If you take out the Model S/X sales, Tesla's sales are mediocre at best, and in the last two years, they sold less than 2,000 model S in Norway and 3,000 Model X. Put another way, now that there is choice, those vehicles don't make the grade for the vast majority of buyers. (As an aside Porsche sold 1,200 Taycan's just last year at almost double the price!)Tesla has 15.8% of the EVs sold in the country over that three year period.Now you can massage the numbers anyway you want, but here are some conclusions from my analysis you can look at EU-EVs to see some nice graphs:1. The number of competitors has jump significantly. In 2018, six auto groups represented over 95% of sales. In Q4 2020, those same six groups represented just 80%. Renault was the largest in Q1 2018 at 40%, now it is VW by a large margin at 29.2%, Tesla maxed out at 29% in Q1 2019, they are currently (Q4 2020) at 16.3%2. Nissan and Tesla were both beneficiaries of early adoption. Now the field is spread very widely in a 'normal' market where there is competition and Tesla has moved to third place in marketshare in Norway in 2020 behind VW, Hyundai and Renault/Nissan. VW is the only company to show dominance.3. The idea of domination is probably passed. Tesla can claim such a thing in the USA, VW can in Europe but other than that, there is broad adoption or such small numbers as to be a misnomer. In Norway, VW brands clearly dominate having gone from 16%, 25% and now 30% marketshare over the past three years. Tesla went from 18% to 30% to 11%. 4. Finally there are a lot of arguments about capacity and those have yet to be borne out for any manufacturer in any meaningful way. Competition is ramping up everywhere, and all suppliers appear to be constrained by supply. That data will become clearer this year and next when substantially more production comes online.Overall though the reason that Norway is important is because it is a small window into the future of EV sales and competitive markets.You can ignore it. You can misrepresent it, you can acknowledge it, but it is still happening and it isn't favorable for Tesla.Guru.",0.9959

He is brilliant, talented, CUNNING, cruel, and not a very nice person, certainly not a sterling example of transparent honesty. He has had to wage war with ""the shorts "" and industry enemies who sought to destroy TSLA and for many years had the upper hand, but in the last year he has turned that around in a big way. So while I don't worship him as many do, I certainly have a deep respect for his warrior ability. I see his tweet as just the latest chapter in the story of the ""war"". He certainly does not intend to sink the stock, but rather to walk the fine line he perceives in the best interest of the company that is his baby and his source for riches.. A number of things come to mind, we know that many people around the world want to buy a TSLA, many would wait if a new technology was imminent . He cannot have that, he wants and needs current sales to be robust. On the other hand, he also needs to keep good news flowing to support the lofty shareprice. I am convinced he has that news, we will learn some of it today, there will be more in the future, he will walk the fine line as he sees fit. Those who short TSLA , especially on weakness , should bear in mind and take very seriously his formidable warrior abilities. I, for one , I am not dismayed about the tweet, it is classic, typical Elon. There is more reasons I can think of for the tweet, but for now the above will suffice.The above being said, those of you who have followed my posts, know that I anticipate much more reasonable share price action than the extremists on the board. The extreme pumpers who spoke of $600 and more this week NEVER were going to be right. Those who think the stock will be at $1000 by year end are also wrong. I also believe the extremist bashers will continue to be wrong It is going to be interesting , that is always true for TSLA .................Less",0.9978

Which is very good for ship currently, less short term competition2. The company that installed the scrubber technology will get paid per agreement on the fuel savings that the vessels make. (put another way, no fuel savings = no payment) and the scrubbers will be owned by ship in a few years.

We expect to further ramp to a rate of 10,000 Model 3 vehicles per week, and an annual Tesla vehicle production rate in excess of 500,000, at some point in 2018.Nov 2017 10Q Based on our current progress, we expect to achieve a production rate of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018, although the precise progress of the ramp is difficult to predict given that our production growth rate is similar to a stepped exponential, so there may be significant rate increases from one week to the next. In order to optimize the incremental improvement of our automation processes and the efficiency of our capital expenditures, we will implement the capacity to further ramp production to 10,000 units per week only after we have achieved a 5,000 units per week run rateFeb 2018 10kBased on our current progress, we are targeting a production rate of 2,500 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018 and 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter. It is important to note that while these are the levels we are focused on hitting and we have plans in place to achieve them, our prior experience on the Model 3 ramp has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time. We are systematically addressing bottlenecks and adding capacity and resources in places like the battery module line where we have experienced constraints, and these actions should result in our Model 3 production rate significantly increasing during the first half of 2018. In some cases, we may not achieve the manufacturing labor efficiencies until we ramp up to fully automated manufacturing lines, which may take us longer than anticipated. In order to optimize the incremental improvement of our automation processes and the efficiency of our capital expenditures, we will implement the capacity to further ramp production to 10,000 units per week only after we have achieved a 5,000 units per week run rate.",0.9985

3768,"Okay longs, let's think about this... With Model 3 getting closer, how does Tesla mitigate the Osborne Effect? (where the announcement of a newer, cheaper better version cannibalizes sales of the existing product) It's a serious concern. It's named after the demise of Osborne Computers.A few mitigating factors:1: The large number of reservations ensure that even if you order an M3 the day they start shipping, you won't get the car for 1-2 years. Meanwhile MS and MX are available today.2: MS and MX will be more established & reliable designs that appeal to risk averse customers. As early adopters pivot to the M3, mainstream customers will move from BMW, Mercedes and Lexus to MS and MX.3: Lack of a hatchback and flat loading platform. The M3 prototypes have a traditional deep trunk and the rear window is fixed. This is actually a huge negative for utility. (The auto industry goes to great lengths to avoid the 'station wagon' label. But if we are honest, that's what most 5 door cross-overs and Prius-like cars are) The Bolt is a station wagon. Even the MS has that utility if you fold the seats down. Yet the M3, conspicuously, does not. I think people who want that utility will continue to be drawn to MS and MX.Shameless Prediction: Once M3 ramps production and works the kinks out of the new platform and batteries, Tesla will announce the Model Y. It will be a Model 3 with crossover/station wagon functionality restored. At the same time, they'll announce MS and MX with 2nd generation batteries, based on 2170 cells, in the 150 to 200 kwh range.

We’ll think about it. And then two months later we went back to him and said “Elon, you’re totally screwed. The Germans are building a gigafactory twice as big as yours, the Chinese are building four of them bigger than yours, the Japanese are building two and the Koreans are building one. So unless you’re willing to pay to buy our cobalt and our nickel at whatever the price may be in the future, you’re not going to be able to build any batteries in your own gigafactory and your whole company is going out of business, and we’re going to make money shorting your stock.”Increasingly, media and investor speculation on the potential for supply chain constraints to materially restrict Tesla and other EV manufacturer’s ambitions is rising in terms of frequency.Remember, Elon Musk’s vision and promotional language states unequivocally that the affordability of Tesla automobiles hinges on the ability of the company to lower the cost of lithium ioin batteries.

Indirectly it pushing it's employee into gray area or even out right fraud. Today they pushing lemon car as new car to customer, tomorrow they will do even more just to make number.

(TSLA), which currently has a fully diluted market cap of approximately $429 billion, which is nearly 90% of those of Toyota, VW, GM, Daimler, BMW and Ford combined despite unprofitably selling fewer than 500,000 cars a year to their nearly 40 million. The core points of our Tesla short thesis are:• Tesla has no “moat” of any kind; i.e., nothing meaningfully proprietary in terms of electric car technology, while existing automakers—unlike Tesla—have a decades-long “experience moat” of knowing how to mass-produce, distribute and service high-quality cars consistently and profitably, as well as the ability to subsidize losses on electric cars with profits from their conventional cars.• Excluding sunsetting emission credit sales, in 2020 Tesla will again lose money, as it has every year in its 17-year existence.• Unit demand for Tesla’s cars is only maintained via continual price cutting.",0.9557

SO chances of all TSLA owners switching to TSLA insurance is very high. Insurance is $100 per month at a minimum. 500K x 100 = 50M reve per month = 600M per year. Not bad at all and the thing is its going to keep increasing. I know all the smart ones will point out revenues does not = profits. But the insurance is more like 150/month. and because the repairs are mostly done by TSLA shops, there will be a much better margins and efficiency. I was paying 290/month for model 3 with AAA, and it is $156/month. I asked the AAA guy why so expensive, the answer was teslas are expensive to repair and take longer time. Clearly an opportunity for TSLA to cash in. Its almost like punishing the owners of TSLA for most likely other peoples fault. They should be increasing premiums for non-TSLA owners.

Then it recovered for about 1/2 hour, then resumed falling more. That happened 2 or 3 times during the day and ended the day at the low, down almost 23%. I don't remember any major stock avoiding the fall that day. I was actually not surprised, because on the Oct 16, a program called Wall Street Week featured, among other guests, Marty Zwieg. He was a highly respected market analyst. Louis Rukeyser asked him about the market. That day, Friday Oct 16, the Dow had fallen about 100 points, almost 5%. HE said something slightly out of character ""I am worried........"". He was usually very careful not to be so direct. Rukeyser did not press him to elaborate. I think Louis knew full well Marty might be right on and a much lower market was very close. Little did they know the extent and sharpness of the fall the following Monday. I have never lost the impact of that market psychology leading up to that Monday. I now have a very similar sense for Monday, Oct 29, 2018. If not that day, then sometime during next week. That fall could be sudden and short lived like 1987 or it would be like Oct, 2008 when the steepest part of the fall lasted much of October. I seem to remember 2 or three days that month, the Dow fell about 1000 points during a day. I think the crash we will see next week will be more similar to 2008.",0.8749

4395,"Here’s what you need to do with your profits from $AMC and $GME. The market has taken on the false narrative that a virus caused the entire world’s infrastructure to change overnight to all solar and wind. This is simply a false narrative. There’s no doubt that the industrialized world will transition to green energy, but this will take a coordinated effort for the next 15 years.What do we do in the meantime? We change government policies to discourage oil and gas production. Part of this is to limit supply to drive up the price of gasoline and diesel fuel. This makes green alternative energy more tenable because it is cheap relative to oil and gas.In the US, the easy policies of the old administration actually hurt the oil and gas industry. They drilled and drilled until the US became the world leading exporter of oil and gas. Then COVID happened and world wide demand dropped by 8% - that’s right only 8%.So far in 2021, demand has recovered by 5%. As of right now, we are only using 3% less oil and gas than we were. Does that sound like a dead industry? Absolutely not.The meteoric stock price rise of solar companies and $TSLA is a bubble. The profits are not there.Now with oil at $53 and Nat Gas at $2.85 - oil companies are profitable.With oil and gas supply being limited by policy - we can expect oil to be $75 by 2022 and over $100 by 2023 - 2035. This is the last golden age of black gold. The last bull market of oil before the oil majors buyout the green energy companies with the treasure troves of cash they are going to generate over the next 15 years.So...take your profits and buy $OXY $XLE $XOM $CVX $ET & $GEL.

That would be an incredible assumption because of the desire for variety in the cars we like to drive. I don’t see Tesla able to profitably develop such variety.

Everyone gets excited to buy the future so at some point people buy the right companies but up too far (overbought) and/or start buying indiscriminatingly (ie. the companies that won't prevail in their industries).But it doesn't change the fact that the idea of the investor is right to begin with. When things inevitably come back down (and nobody knows when that is so it doesn't have much practical application) if you want to bet that Tesla will be one of the companies that will get demolished by the market and not all those companies that are far less diverse, far less innovative, far less capitalized and far less faithfully supported by both consumer and investor alike, then you can make that bet.

A short squeeze can occur when there is a lack of supply and an excess of demand for the stock due to short sellers covering (liquidating) their positions.[1]Short squeezes result when short sellers of a stock move to cover their positions, purchasing large volumes of stock relative to the market volume. Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes a further rise in the stock's price. This newly increased price can in-turn trigger additional margin calls and short covering, which in turn may drive up the price further still in a vicious feedback loop. Short squeezes tend to happen in stocks that have expensive borrow rates. These expensive borrow rates can increase the pressure on short sellers to cover their positions, further adding to the reflexive nature of this phenomenon.",-0.9024

4751,"Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) investment in Bitcoin (BTC) is a sign that the automaker has “run out of viable internal uses” of its capital, according to GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson.The Tesla Analyst: Johnson kept his Sell rating on Tesla’s stock and maintained his price target of $67 on the stock.The Tesla Thesis: Johnson, a long-term Tesla bear, came down heavily on the Elon Musk-led company for its .5 billion dollar investment in BTC.“TSLA took a large chunk of the cash (i.e., $1.5bn, or ~12.2% of the ~$12bn in equity raised in three offerings in 2020) generated from three secondary equity offerings in 2020, and invested it in a highly volatile and allegedly manipulated crypto currency,” wrote Johnson.The analyst said the company had run out of viable internal uses of capital as it did not invest it in research and development or capital expenditure. As per Johnson, the Bitcoin news was released at a time when the company is facing “negative business developments” and is a distraction.The GLJ Research note pointed to declining car sales in China, quality control issues, delay in the German factory, and the inability to obtain the full $1.2 billion in subsidies in that country as the negative factors.The analyst said in his view BTC is an “environmental disaster” as it consumers as much power as the entire country of Switzerland.GLJ noted the potential regulatory pitfalls of the Bitcoin purchase, which they admitted were unlikely.“We see this as a sign of desperation from a CEO whose company is facing real competition for the first time ever,” said the analyst — adding that even if Tesla were to sell its BTC holdings today, it would pocket up to $200 million in profits “that fall 100% to the bottom line, offsetting any losses in its core business of selling cars.”",0.8399

This is several years away at best and then who knows how long it would take to be profitable. Using a $50K car for a taxi is not wise - it will be vandalized, #$%$ in, puked in, and messed with. Do you ever see Uber drivers in $50K luxury cars? Nope - and there is a reason for that. Charging network? Um.;.. the argument all along is that people charge at home.

What is your opinion ?Tesla valuation completely detached from fundamentals On the contrary, Tesla's stock is now so far detached from the company's fundamentals that it now exists ""in a kind of valuation twilight zone."" After all, the e-car maker is now more valuable in terms of market capitalization ""than the entire auto industry was at the start of 2019."" With a current market capitalization Tesla is even ahead of Warren Buffett's investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway ($542.4 billion), except that Berkshire reported EBIT of $106 billion in the last fiscal year, while Tesla's was -$0.6 billion. This fact alone is remarkable. In addition, however, Tesla is increasingly having to fight for its market position in Europe. After all, the competition has now also realized that electric vehicles have great potential for the future. Furthermore, the car market is generally tied to the development of the economy and would grow at its pace, if not slower. ""To justify the current price, Tesla would have to dominate the global car market in the next few decades, and there is little evidence of that,"" Cornell Capital summarizes. The three scenarios But what does this mean for the future of Tesla stock? In order to come up with three future scenarios here, the analysis firm took a closer look at the electric car maker's numbers and derived a base, bear and bull forecast from them. Spoiler: None of the scenarios foresees a further increase in Tesla's share price. For the base case scenario, Cornell Capital Group assumes ""rapid growth and industry-leading operating margins for Tesla."" For this case, Tesla stock should end up at a price of $144.71. Measured against the current share price, this would represent a whopping 77 percent drop. The bull scenario also assumes stronger growth, but only arrives at an implied share price of 301.11 U.S. dollars. And then there is the bear scenario, which continues to assume that Tesla is a ""successful carmaker"", but sees the share price at just 72.71 US dollars - a discount of almost 89 percent. According to Cornell Capital, this analysis shows that ""Tesla is not only overvalued, but unleashed."" So what to do if the stock market experts have their way? Sell Tesla shares short.",0.9862

I am on my second (first was S, second is an X, both pre-owned) and have turned many friends on to it, and they all are as passionate as I am. It just drives way better, and is way safer and smarter and just BETTER. More and more chargers and superchargers are popping up so the charging issue is all but gone and soon gas stations will include charging stations as well. I charge mine using the 220V outlet for my dryer in the garage, works like a charm. Lost my free supercharging when I traded in the S for the X, but it's worth it, the X is just Ludicrous.And can I buy a Tesla in brown or green? No, will I be able to in the future? Probably. Can I buy a Tesla convertible? No, but someday I will. Can you buy a Tesla in New Orleans? Don't think so. Can you buy one in every state? No, but someday but you will be able to. Can I watch a Tesla commercial on t.v.? No, but would that increase sales and awareness? Maybe. Tesla in some ways is in it's adolesence, and I see the future as bright. Is the future bright for Tesla stock? I don't know.that All I know is that I'm guessing that at best, a small per centage of people that can afford a Tesla has driven one, meaning a huge per centage of people that can afford one has not driven one.The future is bright, even with the imminent competition.

Tesla is strong and will only need a few hours, if not days to climb back up, and remain even tougher than before.

At the same time, stores that already have Model Y on display are overwhelmed with potential customers, while other automakers' stores resemble a desert.Meanwhile, Giga Shanghai is ramping up production of Model Y. In images taken by Jason Yang, hundreds of Model Ys can be seen, which are located in the central parking lot and occupy a disproportionate part of it. A flyby of the plant also reveals that SUVs are located in other parts of it.The SUV segment is extremely popular, so the demand for Model Y will continue to grow over time.

5128,"Despite hype, Nissan Leaf outsells Tesla Model S 2-to-1 All eyes continue to be on how quickly the Tesla Model S has been accepted by consumers, beating the expectations of critics who said it was too expensive and that the EV range would always be a hinderance in places other than California. But among other electric vehicles, how do its sales stack up? According to Hybrid Cars, the Model S will pass the 100,000-sales mark in December and be this year's top-selling plug-in vehicle. Consider that this large luxury sedan that just happens to be electric typically sells for north of the $100,000 mark. And consider, as they do, that about 60 percent or so have gone to American buyers and that means roughly 60,000 US buyers have picked up a Model S - that beats the sales of other large gas-powered luxury sedans. Tesla does not officially release monthly sales figures. Despite the excellent year-to-date numbers, the Model S still hasn't caught up to the other big names among electrics, the Chevrolet Volt and Nissan Leaf. And it's estimated that if you factor in the first-generation Volt and its Opel, Vauxhall, and Holden derivatives, General Motors has sold just over 100,000 of its range-extender EV since it first went on sale in December 2010. Sales have been off significantly this year, mostly due to production stopping in spring to retool for the 2016 Volt that recently went on sale in some states. But since the Nissan Leaf went on sale around the same time as the Volt, it's maker has managed to move almost twice as many, or about 200,000 cars globally. This, even as the Leaf's US sales were off more than 40 percent through November. Blame that on the Leaf's age, the 2016 model's noticeably longer range and that used Leafs are dirt cheap these days. The bottom line is that while the Tesla Model S has been a hit as far as electric vehicles are concerned, it hasn't caught up to the popularity of the Nissan Leaf yet. And with a second-generation Leaf due in the near future and the Tesla Model X possibly affecting Model S popularity, it's too soon to see where that car's momentum will stop.

Convertibles are commonly held as part of an arbitrage strategy for those holding short positions in the stock. Tesla clearly states this in their 424's for the Convertible issuances. High short float = more interest in Bonds = more successful financing rounds for the issuer (i.e., Tesla).(2) Underwriters of the Convertible issuance received significant Greenshoes ($120M in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 notes and an option to buy up to an additional $180M in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 notes, which were fully exercised). They are allowed to do whatever they want with these shares, including lending out for short sales as outlined in the Prospectus.

I was a victim of the Texas power outages last week & I’m seriously thinking of buying a new roof with Tesla solar shingles & 4 Tesla power walls for my garage, so I can get off the grid & become energy independent. The power companies are going to be raising the rates for all Texas electricity customers because they just paid $9 per Kwh for 3 days when they normally pay $0.06 per Kwh. Those of us whom can afford to get off the grid & buy the Tesla roof & power stations will be making that investment instead of paying more for our electric company’s mismanagement of Texas power resources last week. This is why I invested in Tesla last week. I am similar to Warren Buffet in that I only invest in companies that make products or provide services that I’d actually buy. I wasn’t a huge fan of their cars, but I do plan to buy their solar shingles & power stations so I’ll never have to live through the blackouts I suffered through last week & because I don’t want to pay the higher rates for electricity over the next few years.

5512,"Well, I was way wrong in my delivery estimates. Those who predicted 22k were spot on. Congratulations. I didn't sell though, despite my promise to Kevin that I would. I'd have sold if the miss was due to lack of demand, but I believe Tesla's explanation that it was due to autopilot hardware changes. (Reading between the lines, I think the truck decapitation accident caused the original autopilot vendor to get fired... It's a little harsh, but it speaks to a corporate culture with high expectations for individual accountability. In the long run, that's a good thing.) Still, I'm pleasantly surprised by the $10 jump. I was expecting a drop. Explanations for it?1: Despite the miss, Tesla's annual deliveries still rose 50% year over year. 2: The large number of cars in transit and the 3 month wait for new MS orders, bode well for Q1. (An astonishing 100% increase over Q1 of 2016 is within reach)3: The FF reveal event both validates the market and underscores how far TSLA has come since their first MS reveal.4: The gigafactory tour in Nevada yesterday (with the announcement that cells are being produced) pleased investors and/or frightened the shorts.Personally, I'm most interested in #4. The current battery cell design was locked in 5+ years ago. With M3 they are cutting in a whole new form factor and that gives them an opportunity to include a whole bunch of incremental improvements. I'm happy to see that they are ramping production now, and will use the cells first in stationary storage applications. There is always a risk in cutting in a new design. Those stationary storage packs can validate the new cells and provide the reliability and endurance data needed to optimize the battery warranty before M3 ships.

So why does he need to go private to ""end negative propaganda from shorts""? And why let them off the hook at $420?Musk suggests there will be no controlling shareholder in the LBO. He also says financing is already arranged. Ergo, he implies a syndicate of lenders has already signed documents for the deal. This is odd for two reasons...First, Musk recently rebuffed an investment offer from Saudi Arabia. If you're passing the hat for the largest LBO syndicate in history, why say no to a big check?Second, a $70B syndicate would involve numerous banks, dozens of lawyers, and multiple boards of directors. It's been [over] 12 hours since the announcement, and none of these parties has confirmed Musk's claims.Which raises a general point: a $70B dollar deal is a Jupiter-sized briar patch of legal and regulatory rules. It's a minutely choreographed thing, with legal risk for any party that says or does the wrong thing at the wrong time. With that in mind:Why did $TSLA not request a trading halt until an hour after Musk's tweet? Why did the company belatedly post an email from Musk, rather than an official statement? Why did Tesla not file an 8-K disclosing details of the purported LBO?Musk says he will not sell in the deal. What about his ~$800M in margin loans? Will lenders accept illiquid collateral?

Consider, each new EV produced whether by Tesla or every other vehicle manufacturer rushing to the party, will take out oil demand for fueling that car. As electricity is needed to fuel that car now, oil is essentially being replaced by natural gas as over 1/3 of all electricity generated in the US is via natural gas. Lower demand for oil would reduce associated gas. Lower supply and greater demand results in higher prices. Ever consider the increase in cash flow for natural gas producers once fixed costs are met? Ever studied how volatile natural gas prices are since it is a relatively inelastic commodity? We keep building homes heated with natural gas, power plants fueled by natural gas and LNG export facilities for natural gas exportation. Plus natural gas is a necessary feedstock in producing petrochemicals (plastics and such), fertilizer and is the most likely viable source for producing hydrogen.

Since the Chinese government has mandated EV cars for their population, this is a really strong move for the company. Furthermore, many might not be bullish on BTC, but there are also many who think this will go over $100K. if that happens, this will create a massive ROI on the BTC position for TSLA. i completely understand people thinking that amount of cash is better deployed in the overall business, but I don't think Musk is actually gambling on this, if he were he'd have bought into Dogecoin, not just tweeted about it. lastly, many of the same BTC holders are of the same demographic as TSLA purchasers. dump the stock if you want but understand the strategy and economics of the BTC purchase before just blurting out whatever you might think of Musk and/or TSLA. my only thought is will TSLA skyrocket if BTC does too? or will this still just be shorted regardless? if it's the former, then don't even sweat the position where TSLA is trading today. if it's the latter, yes, this could be trading closer to $750 very soon. i guess only time will tell.",0.9987

5705,"Musk's option compensation plan provides for 12 tranches of grants totaling a little over 100 million shares with an exercise price of about $70. The 12 tranches have a market cap requirement starting at $100 billion with $50 billion increments up to $650 billion. This market cap has to be sustained for both 30 day and 200 day moving averages. Right now, the 30 day moving average requirement is satisfied for all 12 of the tranches. The 200 day moving average is now around $400/share, well below the $650 market cap level since TSLA didn't move up to $650 billion in market cap until December, 2020. But, if the stock stays above about $675 for another 4 months, the market cap requirement will be satisfied for all 12 of the tranches. The important thing to understand, once this is achieved, it doesn't matter what happens to the stock price as far as the vesting of the options go.The second requirement for vesting of tranches involves 8 revenue levels and 8 adjusted EBITA levels. Any one of these can be used 1 and only once to activate one tranche of grants. So far, it appears that the first 2 revenue milestones ($20 billion and $35 billion) will be satisfied in 2021 as 4th quarter 2020 revenues were over $10 billion. The next levels ($55 billion and $75 billion) might well be satisfied when TSLA first sells 1 million and then 2 million vehicles respectively. This would be 4 of the 8 revenue milestones. If say by 2025 TSLA TSLA sells 5 million vehicles at an average price of $35k, all 8 of the revenue milestones will have been satisfied.But, Musk doesn't need to have all the revenue Milestones satisfied. The first 5 adjusted EBITA milestones either have been or will shortly be satisfied already as the adjusted EBITA was already at $1.85 billion for 4th quarter 2020 and the milestone of more than a total of $8 billion for 4 consecutive quarters requires only a modest increase in EBITA in the next 2 quarters to be reached. It's reasonable to expect adjusted EBITA to exceed $14 billion (the top of the 8 milestones) by the end of 2022.Achievement of 8 EBITA milestones and 4 revenue milestones will be enough to vest the options (assuming the market cap milestone is satisfied, which seems certain baring a sharp decline in TSLA stock. Musk will then have options to buy 100+ million shares at $70/share.If TSLA really is a $800/share stock at that time, this grant will be worth over $70 billion dollars. Not a paid payday for at most 5 years work. If you have a corporation which does great, except it costs nearly $15 billion year to pay the CEO, it is going to be hard to have much left over for the common shareholders.What will the next pay package require? Not likely that Musk will be so foolish as to settle for options when he already has 100 options ""in the bank"".",0.9949

The market always overdoes it when there is technological change creating a new product. There will end up being excess capacity and all the EV makers will be fighting for market share and profits will be meager at best. At least 1/2 of them will end up in bankruptcy.

All they did was charge you more for a smaller battery, but not require a premium package (which by the way, is no longer available - you can no longer buy long range w/RWD)IMO, this could turn into a brilliant move and get more buyers to move up market to lock in $44k option with full tax credit, instead of waiting for $35k with partial credit.

To those future owners who are going to get destroyed when this stock collapses, I offer my condolences to you ahead of time. Everyone one of you knows that you can not make a rational, logical reason why Tesla should be above $300. Even $200 is stretching it. Though Tesla is the main game in town if you want an EV today, in 5 years that will not be the case. Consumers will have dozens and dozens of alternative models from Europe, Asia, and the US to choose from that fit their tastes. Even if Tesla remains the number 1 brand for EV, the odds of it taking more than even 20% of the market share is small. So ride the wave up but be careful. I admit these levels make me too scared even to entertain buying Tesla. Sure it might go up $1000 more in the next 6 months. The house could collapse in a few months down to $400.

Prices are several notches higher for foreign marques, - Mercedes-Benz EQC going at 499,800 yuan- BMW’s iX3 retails for 469,900 yuan.I think the biggest competition to Telsa, Xpeng, Nio and Li Auto is the PRC traditional auto manufactures as BAIC, SAIC, Geely and BYD for example. I am personally and professionally bullish about the PRC EV market and think 8 - 10 companies will dominate like Telsa, Nio, Xpeng, Li, WM, BAIC, SAIC, Geely and BYD and then there will be least expensive (but not that profitable) and the top end luxury foreign JVs like Mercedes, VW doing well too to make up about 12-15 companies leading EV in PRC.For Nio, Xpeng, Li and WM, they will continue to do very well and have significant upside both in business and stock valuations.",0.9768

5901,"DO NOT SELL!!!!!! HOLD YOUR SHARES!!!!!! BE REWARDED!!!!!! Use your focus on Tesla's fundamentals to your advantageSmart Tesla shareholders have already used these coming fireworks as an opportunity. You can see simply from the nearly $200 per-share rise in the automaker's stock price since the S&P 500 announcement that those who might have sold their stock have instead held off, knowing they'd have guaranteed buyers come Dec. 18.Those who are interested in a long-term investment in Tesla will have two things to consider. In the absence of company news to the contrary, there's reason to believe the path of least resistance for Tesla's share price in the next two weeks will be upward. Following the addition on Dec. 21, many short-term traders will then sell off their stock for a profit, potentially creating a short-term dip. What might make the most sense for those looking to add Tesla is to buy half now and then wait until after the S&P 500 event is done to buy the other half.The key thing to remember, though, is that in the long run, the disruption caused by Tesla's addition to the S&P 500 won't matter much. If Tesla's fundamental business fails to perform well, then naysayers will be proven right. But if Tesla executes on all its potential, further gains lie ahead.",0.9899

5934,"Steve ((((( Do not be confused by the Shorts misinformation campaign. The Model 3 will be profitable day 1 )))100% false. Tesla will fail to launch on July 1, 2017 . So on ""day 1"" the Model 3 will not produce any revenues nor will it incur any costs. It will not be in production. BTW on the first day of production the Model 3 will almost certainly produce a positive gross margin (not a profit) and will tend to push Tesla toward profitability. But that is based on assumptions related to the life of the Model 3 and how many units Tesla will sell. If Tesla spends $2 billion on the program and depreciates the costs over 5 years ($400 million per year) and assumes 200,000 units sales per year - then each units needs to cover $2,000 of fixed costs related to depreciation. That is on top of other fixed costs like R&D, overhead, managements, marketing, The first cars produced tend to have the highest margins because the buyers are motivated and want the new vehicle and Tesla can load them up with high margin options. As time goes on the margins tend to shrink and the ""tire kickers"" come in looking for a bargain. For a full line manufacturer this is offset by new products being offered for other segments. For Tesla it will be magnified because they have a very limited product portfolio.",0.9703

Going forward oil supply will be constrained by government policies to encourage investment in green energy, however, due to global reliance on fossil fuels, oil demand is not projected to fall until 2055 - it will continue to grow at around 2% per year. Thesis-The combination of decreased production and rising demand create the catalyst for the final long term secular bull market in the oil and gas industry with prices between $100-$150 starting in 2023. Details-Diversify your recent gains into the oil & Nat gas sector while the market is undervalued. The Green energy transition is limiting oil supply through government policy. Demand is rising as Covid cases are dropping and vaccines are rolled out. See the US inventory report released every Wednesday and the China inventory report.Secondly refer to the recent Goldman Sachs report about the start of the secular bull market in oil. Expect $100-$150 oil beginning in 2023 through 2040.The cash flow generated by these prices will drive further innovation in green energy from oil companies and further result in the strategic buyout of wind and solar companies by the existing oil industry.An example of this trend is $OXY. They have developed the worlds first carbon neutral crude and the world’s most advanced carbon capture and sequestration technology. Warren Buffett owns OXY preferred. Today you can buy excellent companies or ETFs with high distributors at 1/2 price.$GEL for $6.00; $ET for $6.00; $OXY for $21 or $XLE for $41.Take some profits and invest in oil companies.

Musk has lied about the status of the company and given the Saudi's confidence that he will be cash flow positive, etc., causing them to make the investment decision or 2. They are investing based on some perception of future growth in selling high end electric cars.If we give Musk the benefit of the doubt here (I don't personally, but you may), and assume there is a great future selling $50,000 mid size cars, then it will be 2-3 quarters before the market gets a sense of the demand after the 'noise' is reduced. Here are the 'noise' items:(a) Manufacturing capability - Can they produce quality cars at capacity without huge capex? (b) Demand - Are there customers who will buy midsize sedans at $35,000 to $50,000 after the early adopters have been satisfied?(c) Government incentives - What will the impact be of government incentives and their end?(d) Run rate financial condition - Can the finances of the company stabilize enough to understand/differentiate between capital costs and operating costs so that it is possible to evaluate the profitability and potential cost savings.(e) and just to throw in one more, will the cars remain appealing from a design standpoint once there are a vast array of alternativesSo I think it will be a few quarters before a true evaluation of the company can happen.

5987,"Goals for new year include electric trucks, 'robotaxis' Tesla will ring in 2021 with a ""war chest"" of around $20 billion, plenty to fund ambitious plans that include the launch of its futuristic-looking, all-electric pickup and heavy-duty trucks.Tesla (TSLA) is fresh from a $5 billion equity tap, its second in three months , which Chief Executive Elon Musk said he and other Tesla executives debated but in the end thought it was ""probably a good thing"" as it would retire debt and increase the security of the company.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas calculated that $20 billion, saying in a note Thursday that was his estimate for pro-forma gross cash balance. At the end of third quarter, Tesla said it had $14.5 billion in cash and equivalents, a bump of $5.9 billion from the second quarter.""We forecast Tesla to spend (about $50 billion) in combined capex and R&D"" from 2021 through 2025, a figure that could prove to be ""very conservative,"" he said. That also compares with $27 billion spending target at General Motors Co. (GM) over a similar time span, Jonas said.Besides the plan for the new pickup and commercial trucks, the year for Tesla also includes seeing to completion its two new factories, one outside Berlin, Germany and another outside Austin, Texas.Tesla said it was ""on track"" to start deliveries from the two new plants in 2021, with the Texas factory tasked with building the Cybertruck and the heavy-duty Semi in addition to Model Y and Model 3 vehicles for the East Coast. Tesla's factory in Fremont, Calif., is currently its sole vehicle-making plant in the U.S.There are also plans to focus on developing a fleet of ""robotaxis,"" expand its insurance offerings, and continue to develop its in-house battery cells it hopes to be cheaper and better-performing batteries.While Tesla has not given official word of its sales goals for 2021, it came close enough for some.On a call discussing third-quarter results with investors, one analyst estimated 2021 sales between 840,000 to 1 million vehicles, and Musk responded by saying that sales likely will be ""in that vicinity"" and that the analyst was ""not far off.""Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn then added that Tesla will provide official 2021 guidance when it reports fourth-quarter results in early 2021, seeming to prevent Musk from saying more. Tesla has kept its target to sell half a million vehicles in 2020.Tesla shares have broken strings of record closes this year, with the latest boost coming from a Dec. 21 inclusion in the S&P 500 index. Tesla's market valuation hovers around $600 billion. The stock also went through a 5-to1 split in August Optimism on Tesla has also lifted shares of other electric-vehicle makers such as Nikola Corp. (NKLA) and China's Nio Inc. (NIO), Li Auto Inc. (LI), and XPeng Inc. (XPEV), which have soared past their initial public offering prices. EV maker Fisker Inc.

They have thrown critical thinking and skepticism out the window and happily burn their life savings on a car company which has never built a car profitably in its 17 year history, but builds vehicles with severe and extremely dangerous defects.There is no doubt that Tesla stock will crumble into the single digits...and perhaps go to zero as the company loses the only valuable asset it ever possessed: its first mover advantage.

So the Musk clan ponies up their borrowed money from share-backed loans or, in Elon's case, options exercised at the time of the last TSLA share issuance.I am guessing the so-called acquisition isn't about ""synergies"" at all, but simply a way to bury the disaster that is SCTY inside TSLA books.

6184,"For Tesla, Deliver, Don't Promise, in 2018BY MarketWatch— 10:44 PM ET 12/29/2017Elon Musk is best when he sketches out Tesla(TSLA) Inc.'s distant future. In 2018, Mr. Musk should focus on the mundane present.The new year will present Tesla's greatest operational challenge. Rather than issuing promises of an electric semi truck, a new sports car and a pickup truck, as he did in recent months, Mr. Musk needs to figure out how to produce hundreds of thousands of mass-market sedans at a profit.If he can't, Tesla could find itself trying to raise capital in a less-friendly market, meaning his highly loyal shareholders could be hurt by a wave of stock issuance. So far, the investors have forgiven Tesla for its production problems. Shares were up 47% in 2017, and Tesla's market value of $53 billion rivals that of Ford Motor(F) Co. and General Motors Co.But the gaudy stock performance belies a more-troubled picture.Tesla delivered just 220 of its Model 3 mass-market sedans in the third quarter, well below its forecast of 1,500. Tesla, which will report fourth-quarter deliveries next week, said in November that it hopes to achieve a production rate of 5,000 cars a week by late in the first quarter of 2018, after previously predicting it would hit that milestone this year.More downward revisions to growth expectations are possible. Analyst consensus calls for Tesla to deliver about 180,000 Model 3s next year; it will be very hard to hit that estimate without a quick ramp-up in deliveries.The Model 3 was supposed to generate big profits for Tesla but is nowhere close to doing that. Analysts expect an adjusted loss of over $10 a share in 2017 and the same in 2018, according to FactSet. A year ago, those analysts expected a loss of 97 cents a share in 2017 and a profit of $1.59 a share in 2018.Tesla investors have always been willing to forgive overly aggressive forecasts. But heavy capital spending to bring the Model 3 online, as well as Tesla's 2016 acquisition of SolarCity, have strained the balance sheet. That, along with fresh electric-car competition from rivals, means increasing urgency to actually deliver on these promises.The stock has sold off nearly 20% from September's recent high. Tesla needs to keep its share price high, since it uses the capital markets to fund its operations. More debt doesn't seem like a practical solution--Tesla issued $1.8 billion in bonds due in 2025 over the summer; those bonds now trade below par. And the lower the stock price, the more any new equity raise would dilute existing shareholders.Don't underestimate the challenges Tesla faces. The company has never produced a fraction of the cars it needs to deliver, and it has never made a profit while selling far more expensive vehicles. Producing more cars won't solve the problem without quantum leaps in production efficiency.In the coming year, Tesla will be judged on operations, not hype.",0.9871

These bets are the only way to make any real money on stocks that pay no dividend, holding yields nothing.You might own a Tesla and love it (and they are very nice cars), you might think Elon is a genius visionary pioneer (and in many ways he is), but you base your investment decisions on research and experience, you try to see beyond the hype. You analyse the factors that have lead to the bull run and figure out if they are genuine and/or sustainable.Figuring out where the market top (or bottom) is for a given stock is the holy grail of investing. It is trying to emulate what institutional traders do, in an attempt to extract margins surfing that wave both ways up and down, just like they do.Traditional investing and holding applies only for stocks that pay a dividend high enough to justify the investment. All else is speculation, buying in the hope that in time others will buy too and push the price up, or vice versa.Don't be misled by the reported short interest volumes, there are countless derivatives out there that are not counted in. And don't expect the price to tank all of a sudden - the whales are selling but drip-feeding the trades slowly through sophisticated selling alogos, they don't want the price to crash.

6374,"Let me say this one more time that why I believe Tesla is the next Apple and Amazon. The era of sole EV sales is coming (large market like India and China announced 100% ban of ICE by as early as 2030). Tesla is the leader (years ahead) in battery technology, battery management systems, self-driving tech (read data vs. other companies are still doing road tests), and is catching up on production rate (confirmed 5k production of battery last night). And most importantly, Tesla doesn't sell one single ICE car. Nor does it own one. When Nokia and Blackberry realized that smartphone might be the actual future, it's already too late. The executives in those companies had to come up with reasons to persuade their boards and shareholders that they might need to take huge losses to 1) close down the assembly line for their ""dumb"" phones (at a lost of course), and 2) steer the companies' resource to invent in their own smartphones, operating system, app store, etc. without a clear idea if their new products will actually sell (the answer we know now is no). After years of struggle, Nokia and Blackberry smartphone divisions (cash positive even after iPhone's release) were both sold to other companies. Same ideology can be applied to all other ""disruptive"" companies because they don't own any legacy production line and product. Amazon doesn't own one single physical bookstore, and Netflix doesn't own one single DVD store. They can pour ALL their resource into expansion (at a lost of course in the beginning) without being worried about cannibalism. Let's look at car manufacturing. All other ICE manufacturers will face the same brutal cost-spiking profit-shrinking process, aka giving up their ICE assembly line, building EV powertrain line, and ramp up EV production. They can't just magically close down all the assembly lines and switch to EV without losing huge. Given that they are all public trade company (like Nokia, Rim), this process won't be looking good on their balance sheet and to Wall St. Every EV they produce will cost them not only the cost of raw material and assembly line, but also the loss of ICE car sale (assuming that people will actually buy their car, look at Chevy bolt sales vs. Model 3). By that time, once again, it is already too late. Talk about the so-called ""competition"" all day long, but to me, there's no such thing.

With an auto producer that PE could be extended to cars produced. For example, Toyota produced 8.8 million cars last year to achieve earnings. Their PE is 9.21. This indicates that Toyota needs to produce 8.8 million cars times 9.21 years of earnings to meet market cap. This total is 81,480,000 vehicles.Tesla produced 500,000 cars last year. Their PE is 1,628 and this is not a fully diluted PE. Multiply the two and the total is 814 million cars. Fully diluted and this number nears 900 million. There is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years. World auto production in 2019 was 91,786,861. Tesla, at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits, would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a PE similar to Toyota.

Again, that would be very impressive growth of 11 times 2020 earnings.That would put TSLA's earnings just about where GM's are expected to be in 2026 (which is only about 25% more than expected 2021 GM earnings). Yet, TSLA is trading at 15 the times of the price of GM.BTW, I am long GM. I ""expect"" that if GM performs as I project, it will be worth as much as $100/share in 2026. But, I wouldn't be willing to pay $100 per share for GM NOW.Can you see the problem we have with this? Yes, growth is good. 6 years of 50% per year would be possible only in the absence of any sort of significant competition. Maybe it's possible for 6 years. I think it's highly unlikely. But even then, with TSLA selling over 5 million cars per year at current vehicle prices, it would have to grow more than 10 times from that to justify the current stock price. (More likely it would have to sell more than 10 million per year if it is selling a $25k vehicle).This just doesn't seem like an expectation that a reasonable man could have.

He took technology invented and shelved by a scientific genius called Tesla and is taking credit for putting it into an electric car. Elon has done nothing. He sends rockets in space like North Korea. He digs tunnels that will not be used except by human rats and he uses a pit of personal cash to manipulate the stock market. He pumps up Tesla stock and shorts others we will not mention.Problem is he is burning money and making non except what he can brain wash investors to give him. When the barrel empties there is going to be a lot of hunger and whining from the gullible people he has dipped into. The Chinese have set him up and all the auto companies have caught up and passed him. He produces one car. A sedan which will soon lose its luster of novelty. Be ware . Be wise.

Of course, when you add it to the already OBVIOUS multiple departures of the very smartest , best people from TSLA in recent week, months and the last year etc, it really reinforces the concept that justifies the drop in TSLA shares from the $300's to the present level. The real question is whether the valuation should be further reset by the market to a sub $200 level , as many in wall street feel is appropriate and on its way to happening, of should it linger in the current range.

6845,"From Seeking Alpha!Summary • Despite having less than 1% of global auto market share, Tesla's market cap is now greater than that of all non-Chinese automakers, combined. • Tesla is clearly priced for massive growth, yet half of its current products are aging and its development pipeline is sparse. • The Tesla Semi, new Roadster, and Cybertruck have all been unveiled; they are already facing significant competition from other automakers. • Even if Tesla's most ambitious assumptions were to play out as planned, it would not be enough to justify the current valuation. • Tesla is already seeing declining market share in the most mature EV markets; as this trend continues in 2021, the growth narrative will likely come under pressure.At present, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has just four electric vehicle models in active production: the Model S, the Model X, the Model 3, and the Model Y. The Model S and Model X, while extremely innovative at the time of their introduction, are now aging platforms in decline, leaving the Model 3 and Model Y to carry ever more of the load. While both have proven popular, their addressable market is finite, as evidenced by Tesla’s having had to resort repeatedly to price cuts to keep demand from ebbing throughout 2020, even in the supposedly near-limitless Chinese market.CEO Elon Musk has stated that Tesla aims to produce 20 million vehicles per year by 2030, far beyond the wildest peak annual demand projections for the Model 3 and Model Y, combined. To achieve its goal, Tesla will have to bring a host of new offerings to market over the course of the next decade. Yet the company has struggled of late to expand its product development pipeline. As I discussed in a recent article, the Tesla Semi, which has yet to enter production more than three years after it was unveiled, is one clear example of this issue.",0.9958

I own the stock and have done well with it, but now after seeing that and being in the market for a new car I am considering buying a Tesla. I was considering buying something this summer but maybe i will wait and get on the waiting list, this charging station is very close to my office so it would be cool to go get lunch with some coworkers and charge the car while we eat!I'm sold, you would be too if you saw what the station looked like, cool branding, filled with Tesla's, convenient location, the list goes on and on!",0.9957

6853,"So I was reading a post about how TESLA would have a 1 trillion in profit in a few years because they would be selling 20 million cars a year. First off if my math is correct one would need to make $50,000 profit per vehicle to make it to 1 trillion. At present if you figure the average cost of a vehicle is $80,000 and they were 30% profit that would lower profit to $24,000 per vehicle. In addition 20 million cars is more cars than sold in 2019 by 3 million so it would require not only completely cornering the market on vehicle sales but also would require a 20% increase in sales. Furthermore, how many of the autos sold cost $80,000? an average car is closer to $35,000 so that would substantially cut into your profits. I'm guessing $50-$100 billion in profit may be realistic at some point but it will take quite a while to scale to that as well. I like TESLA and Musk and I think they are moving in the right direction on things but at this price the stock is so far over value that I am afraid it is really going to hurt the company. Many of those who made it what it is will be so rich they wont need to be there any longer and if it comes crashing down many will leave with a horrible impression of the TESLA name.",0.9918

7057,"Bloomberg NewsTesla to Start Making Cars in India, Targeting Vast MarketBy Saritha RaiFebruary 14, 2021, 9:15 PM PST Updated on February 15, 2021, 2:47 AM PSTGovernment minister says automaker has picked southern stateElon Musk all but confirmed entry into India in JanuaryTesla to Start Making Cars in India.Tesla Inc. is said to be closing in on an agreement to make electric vehicles in India for the first time. Katrina Nicholas reports.Tesla Inc. is closing in on an agreement to make electric vehicles in India for the first time, opening up a new growth opportunity after setting up production in China.Tesla has picked Karnataka, a southern state whose capital is Bangalore, for its first plant, the state’s chief minister said over the weekend. The automaker has been negotiating with local officials for six months and is actively considering car assembly in the suburbs of Bangalore, people familiar with the matter said.Tesla didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment and did not confirm the minister’s statement.The company is conducting due diligence for office real estate in the region and plans to set up an R&D facility, said the people, asking not to be named because the matter is private. Tesla has focused on Bangalore because it’s shaping up to be a hub for electric vehicles and aerospace manufacturing talent, they said. Tesla has incorporated its Indian unit and registered offices in downtown Bangalore.Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk all but confirmed Tesla would enter India in January after months of speculation. The world’s richest man on Jan. 13 tweeted “as promised” in response to a report on a Tesla-focused blog that the automaker was in talks with several Indian states to open an office, showrooms, a research and development center -- and possibly a factory.That revelation sparked euphoria from locals, such as Nikhil Chaudhary, a 20-year-old student at the University of Delhi who helped start India’s Tesla fan club in 2019.Despite the hype, Tesla’s foray into India may well prove challenging. The country hasn’t yet rolled out the welcome mat for EVs like neighbor China, where Tesla set up its first factory outside of the U.S. and now dominates sales of premium EVs.EVs account for about 5% of China’s annual car sales, according to BloombergNEF, compared to less than 1% in India.“Considering the price of a Tesla, Elon Musk probably won’t be able to sell an EV to most of the population in emerging economies,” said Pedro Pacheco, a Munich-based senior research director at Gartner Inc. “However, looking at the size of the population and the potential for economic growth, Tesla will probably target a fast-growing group of affluent individuals that, in absolute terms, compares quite favorably to what we see in many developed countries.”Charging SpotsPalo Alto, California-based Tesla may also use any Indian factory as an export base, leveraging several markets at the same time, Pacheco said.The expensive cost of a Tesla is viewed as a sticking point by other market watchers, too. Mumbai-based Basudeb Banerjee, an analyst at Ambit Capital Pvt, noted that the “size of the luxury car market in India is minuscule with brands like BMW, Mercedes, Audi and Jaguar Land Rover accounting for just 30,000 to 50,000 sales annually.”And despite India’s broader potential, charging infrastructure remains another impediment to large-scale EV adoption.According to the International Energy Agency, around 60% of the world’s public slow- and fast-charging spots are in China. As Chinese carmakers roll out competitive EV models and develop a diverse ecosystem, the country is “heading toward disrupting the current global auto industry landscape,” UBS Group AG analysts wrote in a report last month.Tesla Hands Over First China-Built Cars to Employees in ShanghaiA Model 3 vehicle moves off an assembly line during a ceremony at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Shanghai, in December 2019. India has been making similar moves, but not yet on the same scale.In 2015, it launched a Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and EV (FAME) plan, with a 9 billion rupee ($123 million) commitment to subsidies that cover everything from electric tricycles to buses, according to the IEA. A second generation of the FAME program introduced in 2019 was larger, with 100 billion rupees to encourage EV purchases and build out charging infrastructure.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-15/tesla-to-start-making-cars-in-india-targeting-sprawling-market",0.9993

7069,"Investors Double Down on Stocks, Pushing Margin Debt to RecordSource: Dow Jones NewsBy Michael Wursthorn Bruce Burnworth used to clip coupons and look for deals before his investment in Tesla Inc. made him a millionaire.He is part of a widening class of affluent Americans who are doubling, or even tripling, down on this year's highflying stock market. The S&P 500 has soared 66% since bottoming in March in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, while dozens of individual stocks, like Tesla, have surged even higher.Some investors have been tempted to chase bigger gains -- and have exposed themselves to potentially devastating losses -- through riskier plays, such as concentrated positions, trading options and leveraged exchange-traded funds. Others are borrowing against their investment portfolios, pushing margin balances to the first record in more than two years, to buy even more stock.Mr. Burnworth, a civil engineer in Incline Village, Nev., who is nearing retirement age, is using all of those strategies after turning a roughly $23,000 options gamble on Tesla last year into a nearly $2 million windfall. His growing Tesla stake had enabled him to borrow against his position to convert Tesla options into shares that have soared sevenfold this year. He says he also helped his daughter buy a home and purchased a Tesla sport-utility vehicle for another family member.",0.9101

7091,"Ok, I went for test drive of Model 3:For disclosure, I drive an Audi Q7, my wife an Audi TTS, my son a BMW M2, and my daughter a new Jeep Rubicon. So, I do know a few things about premium cars. First, my overall impression of the Model 3 was that it is a pretty decent car. Fast off the line, brakes very well, good visibility. I’m 6 feet tall, I found the lower seat to be a bit “ short” ( no pun intended) in that the edge of seat did not come to the underneath of my kneecap.. for shorter distances probably no issue but I could see long trips having my right leg tire from less support.i liked the regenerating aspect of the braking.. solid marks there.Tried the Autopilot on the highway. Wasn’t a big fan of it, but then again I have 12 second auto steer on my Q7 and I don’t use it. I did not like the fact that I had to divert my eyes off the road to the middle screen to see basic things like speed. A HUD for some basic things should be standard in a premium car. I found the screen to be fairly well laid out, but I question having all vehicle controls run through one system like that. If anything goes wrong with the screen, you are pooched in terms of driving. To me, that’s a bad design to have that much reliance on one screen.I hate the look of Aerowheels.. the car I drove was RWD and had the silver wheels. Much nicer look IMO.Fit and finish looked fine. I did not see any visible issues from my brief walk around of the test car.So, overall I found the acceleration and braking to be very good, and the car handled well at 120 km per hour on highway. A bit more wind noise than I am used to with Audi or BMW, but not horrible. The interior was well appointed but I think the seats could be better ( support wise). Being in Canada, the seats are heated, but steering wheel isn’t. That surprised me that they left that off. So I guess I would say I was pleasantly surprised at quality of this car from a driver perspective. Would I buy it? Hmmmm.,, probably not because I am concerned about viability of the business and it’s sustainable nature, but the car itself was above my expectations as a driver. I am used to be a bit more luxury features in a car of that price point, but the driving asiects of the car were goodI’ll post some more intel I found out about deliveries, discounts etc in another post",0.9959

Before that massive correction, the feeling was much like it is today - everyone thought they would get rich on stocks and not have to work ever again. No one believed the market could actually go down. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft - they all faceplanted. People would buy the dip over and over - all the way down - for 2-1/2 years - ha! (Hence the term catching the falling knife). Where did all the money go that people took out of the stock market? Real estate... between 2000 to 2006 there was a massive real estate run up...which of course led to the massive, sub-prime mortgage fiasco in 2006 which plunged the US into a deep, deep recession. But anyway, realistically any young investors today under the age of about 35 probably have no first hand recollection of those events so I thought I would throw it out there. It is possible for the stock markets to massively correct and go dead for 10 years. It is possible to see your massive next egg slowly diminish away, so if you have made a ton of money over the last 10 years you might want to consider not being greedy and putting all of it - or some of it - in safe, conservative investments.

I like TSLA because their competition is ICE manufactures, not other BEVs. There is a shortage of batteries. TSLA is also the leader in self driving.

Be more conservative on discretionary spending for goods and services. Continually research/shop for “needs” and curtail/reevaluate the “wants”.

7346,"2030 EV sales forecastDeloitteWith one eye firmly on progress so far, Deloitte has analysed the most recent indicators to develop an up-to-date prediction of the EV market for the next ten years. We know that BEVs already outperform PHEVs globally, and predict that by 2030, BEVs will likely account for 81 per cent (25.3 million) of all new EVs sold. By contrast, PHEV sales are expected to reach 5.8 million by 2030. A recovery from COVID-19 will see ICE vehicles return to growth, up to 2025 (81.7 million), then experience a decline in market penetration thereafter.Our global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales (see figure 2). Annual car sales are unlikely to reach pre-COVID-19 levels until 2024. However, the pace of recovery is forecasted to be a result of a slowdown in ICE sales; EVs will continue to have a positive trajectory during the COVID-19 recovery period and may well end up capturing a disproportionate share of the market in the short term.",0.9852

The margins on the cars will be 90%, yielding $180 trillion in Pure Free Cash Flow per Year (PFCFpY). At a very conservative 20x multiple, we achieve a value of $3.6 QUADRILLION!!!!!!

We could see his signaling, but it was confusing even to us. I don't see how FSD ever gets to understanding this - which makes me think the robotaxi business is a non-starter. The second situation where it got confused and required my friend to take over was on a highway where they had redirected the lanes (1/2 lane over) to make room at roadside for what looked like sewer work behind a barrier. The lane shift had new lines and somewhat stripped / scrapped old lines. FSD couldn't understand what was going on.I went into this with an open mind. And while system is impressive in 95% of road scenarios, it utterly fails in the last 5%.
