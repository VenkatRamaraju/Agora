This is how inflation is kept inside the financial system( for the most part). So it doesn't matter how much the FED prints.2) Now Helicopter money, or stimulus checks they like to call it. That can be inflationary. However household debt is so high right now that people either put the cash in the bank(JPM) Pay off their house/auto/credit card with it(JPM).

That would mean JPMorgan is generating more than enough profit to invest in its businesses and meet regulatory capital requirements, and can even reduce some of that capital.The new prediction is up from a 65 percent medium-term scenario that JPMorgan offered last year.""It does feel like we have reached an inflection point for capital,"" Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said at the event.""",0.994

The report broadly describes how “two separate Russian espionage groups” were involved in the “the intrusion into a U.S. political party.” But there’s no specific details explaining the attribution of Russia as being behind the hacking. Eight pages of the report consist of information meant to help network administrators try and identify possible intrusions, prevent them, and what to do if they identify code the U.S. government has identified as Russian.Read more: http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/02/the-us-has-yet-to-provide-evidence-russia-directed-a-hacking-operation-to-undermine-election/#ixzz4UbdeIJAF",0.6122

I certainly get it, the pressures clients can place on them are vast. For it is the typical investment ideas one knows and recognizes as his/her own that dictates the norms that are to be followed. Ideas of how they are meant to be, act, and react, are almost always established by the roles they are expected to play, set and communicated to their clients from their very early years, 20, 30, 40 years ago…Under such light, the question of how these money managers fit in a market place which has changed so much and is still changing every year is an unavoidable question to have. For how can one be part of this brand-new investment world and we see nothing new about them? Thankfully, there was one analysis I watched which I liked. It was $JPM ‘s Kolanovic-head of derivatives and quantitative strategies. He was great at conveying a number of ideas and themes, but perhaps the most prominent was his use of such realism devices as his knowledge of all aspects that move markets today. Whether it’s fundamental, behavioral, technical or CTA’s (momentum plays). Marko was the antidote to the managers that are stuck in past generations. In this environment, one needs to realize, having the knowledge of all players that move markets is in fact a very powerful “weapon” to have. Marko is certainly not the only one but a minority in today’s investment world. By all accounts, to me, Marko, is considered an expert in this investment world and that is accentuated further when juxtaposed with the old-fashioned managers who are not.",0.9917

So think again how much growth you expect from Tesla I am not talking about right now I am talking about 1 Y later's expectation. Tesla needs to grow x13-15 just to break even with WFC.

With all his selling and the stock is at 103-106 last week so he lost another 400 million by exiting and the stock went up over 10%. The airlines killed him because he sold at the low again and lost billions. If he stayed in the position he would have several billions more cut from his losses in the airlines. Lastly. Look at Goldman Sachs yet another sell on his list and this time he exited the financial stake u like JPM where he kept a substantial amount of shares. But the Goldman sell was another bad move because he sold and the stock is flying where at one point it was 227 after earnings. Talk about a bad move, he has made several bad moves with selling and he always preaches buy instead of sell when things are low. Imagine if he added instead of sold his shares in these companies. He would have made billions instead of losing billions. Not sure who is making these decisions on board but these are huge mistakes going against his principals of being greedy when others are fearful. Everything he sold is up. George Soros looks like a genius and he has been buying up JPM at these levels along with all of the major institutions and hedge funds that is why it went up when Buffett was selling and continues to go up.",0.9703

The actual price should be at least over $50/share. I hope SEC will correct BAC price ASAP after the investigation.One super hacker has been secretly manipulating Bank of America (BAC) stock price, controlling its price, dragging its price down for the past five years from approximately middle of 2013 till present 09/2019. After 12/12/2016, his manipulation activity became more frequent. He has been obsessed with one lady and hates her to own BAC stock price and several other stocks. He made her other stocks either bankruptcy or became penny stock or became a few dollars stock. He can’t make Bank Of America bankruptcy due to the bank is too large and billionaire Warren Buffet is the largest shareholder.This hacker has been sharing the lady’s computer IP and all browsers at his computer and monitoring all her online activities. If you watch carefully, you will discover when all bank stocks price went up a lot in the past several years, Bank of America stock price only went up a little or even dropped down mysteriously for many times in the past. BAC shows very weak to go up while other bank stocks went up a lot. On a good earning date with good news, BAC stock price dropped down mysteriously while other bank stocks’ price went up a lot. I noticed such suspicious activity twice on earning report date.This hacker/stalker made BAC lost many chance to go up in the past while other bank stocks’ price went up a lot. I think SEC should correct BAC stock price to $50We have filed report on FBI ic3.gov and SEC.gov, but this hacker hacked into those government sites to delete all our reports. She mailed letters to FBI, SEC, stock company Chairman and attorneys, but this stalker/hacker hacked into USPS post office computers and transferred away her mails. He knows all her writings and her online searching activities through hacking her computer secretly. Trying to cover his BAC stock price manipulation crime, this hacker/stalker has been secretly manipulating several other bank stocks’ price as well. I hope someone will notice Bank of America all shareholders, investors including billionaire Warren Buffet and Bank of America headquarter CEO, JPM CEO, media , FBI and SEC for investigation this crime. Warren Buffet is the largest shareholder of Bank of America stock with 927,248,600 shares . It made him lose at least over $10B. But Mr. Buffet doesn’t know BAC stock price manipulation conspiracy.

(OPY)Summaryearnings up 68% in the latest quarter.stock buybacks are continuing.P/E going forward of just 6 !trading at only 85% of book value.Oppenheimer Holdings ($26.40 OPY) Tangible book value grows by 15% each year, due to strong earnings and low dividend payout ratio.Again virtually no one covers this name on the buy or sell- side since 2014; this is still why this is miss-priced massively.Record earnings out today of $0.86 for the first quarter up 68% from the same period prior.75% of their earning or $2.60 a share of their earnings today is stable interest swap income. If short-term interest rates stay between 2.30% and 2.50%. If they go above 2.50, they make even more money. So basically their core earnings today are like a regular bank.If earnings were going at a bank by 68% it would trade at 2.5 times tangible book, OPY trades under tangible book.Many significant funds like Blackrock own about 5% of the shares, so the float is about half of the 13 million shares that can trade each day.Many people think OPY is an investment bank when it is a right-sized asset management firm with a small investment bank on the side.With the current market so strong and IPO pipeline so strong they could earn as much as $5.00 a share this year and next. Next quarters earnings will be over $1.00 a share, that lowers the P/E to six, that does not make sense, it should trade at a P/E of 10 or more.They just moved their main office last year, and the rent savings will go to the bottom line now, also helping with earnings power going forward.Results the last several quarters have beaten any estimates, but no one seems to care.Even without incentive fee income, they are in much better shape from just two years ago, as short-term interest rates are way up and are staying up for the foreseeable future.Costs for technology upgrades also are now behind them which was a vast number, $65 million.Costs for 98% of regulatory and legal issues are now behind them.With the great first quarter market move, the biggest in over a decade, this will favorably impact their asset management fees for the second quarter of 2019.The main reason they are superior to their peers, even if the market sells-off again big in 2019, they now have a more stable earnings platform, as an everyday vanilla bank, generating about $2.60 plus in earning per share alone just on interest swap income, that’s there for many years to come. Most people don’t understand this is a considerable advantage to their peers.The risks they have to take to make numbers are much less than any of their peers.The CEO controls the voting so only he can sell the firm and owns over 22% of the stock.Downside risks as with any investment bank can vary and do, but OPY runs a tight ship for over 40 years.If short -term interest rates were to turn down sharply go under 1.50%, now about 2.40%, then this would hit their earnings by about 25%, but this is most likely this is not going to happen anytime soon. The most critical factor is going forward, stable earnings, that have a chance to expand actively if the market stays strong and deals keep coming.We would go long now today, under $26.50 and hold till it hits full value at around $50 in a sale or just fair amount of at least $45 a share.Valuations do matter even while they don’t seem to in today's world on many stocks, OPY has a cheap valuation, strong earnings growth, stable earnings underneath the growing part, proven management with a significant stake in the firm and they always add to their holdings and never sell.Since it is just a $337 million market cap company today no one is following this firm anymore in many years, but us. That is where the opportunity lies.Compared to any of its competitors it is about 50% cheaper right now. It has better earnings growth than any that I can find, and they are growing faster and have more stable earnings power.The company still has over 200,000 shares left in there stock buyback, and they have paid higher prices already this year than it is trading at now.I am sure they will buy shares substantial soon and add a new buyback, as it will grow book and earnings handsomely from these levels. The downside is limited from these levels as well due to these factors.They are adding about $1.00 to book value every quarter going forward from here, that alone is all you need to",0.9997

Dimon said on Friday that the $1.5 billion JPMorgan plans to spend on business investments in 2021 ""includes a little bit inChina,"" despite the current tension between governments. Speaking to reporters after posting quarterly results, Dimon said, the conflict between the U.S. and China ""hasn't changed our goals."" He allowed that ""maybe the time table has stretched out a little bit. Obviously, it is going to be a lot more complicatedfor international financial companies going forward."" Dimon has been talking for years about how China is becoming a bigger market on its own and is increasingly powerful, both in the world economy and as a banking competitor to JPMorgan. He wants to make sure JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, is involved. And, as with other multi-year expansions by JPMorgan, whether spreading commercial banking offices throughout the U.S.and in Europe or opening retail branches in new cities, Dimon does not want the bank to be a fair weather entrant who retreats after signing on new clients.

3343,"It is easy to say it's a fools game to ""time the market""; however, it doesn't take a genius to look at a a bit of history over the last one hundred years of the stock market to realize that ""all time highs"" is not the right time to start adding positions in stocks; any stocks. There is going to be a 15-40% correction within the next few years. It ""always"" happens after one of these 2 year ""super""run up periods. Don't take my word for it - just check the history of the stock market. My advice: Sell your big winners, no long term bonds, build short term CD ladders to get a little something on your cash, and be patient. The next good buy opportunity for blue chip stocks will come much sooner than most people realize. When you get a 15% correction, put 1/3 of your cash to work. When you get a 20% correction, put another 1/3 of your cash to work. Save the last third of cash in case that 20% turns into a 2000 or 2008 type of rout (40% routs happen rarely, but do happen). Also, when these 15-20% corrections hit; don't buy right away. Allow the corrections to take a foot hold and stabilize (usually 6-9 months into the correction will work); then put your first 1/3 cash position to work. Waiting will minimize the ""falling knife syndrome"". Concentrate on blue chips. Nasdaq high fliers rapidly become low fliers so stay away from new company tech stocks and small caps during this period (opportunities to add positions in these will come a bit later). Always keep in mind two of the most useful words ever coined for investing in stocks: ""Buy Low""!!!!!!! Don't let any CEO make you sit on your stock positions when all instincts tell you that the stock prices are too high. Let history be your teacher, not some CEO. Pearls Gen Z'ers - I'm giving your pearls. The philosophy above has worked for me since 1978 when I bought my first position in GE.

A Justice Department spokesman said the agency intends to fill the positions ""promptly"".The unit is part of a broader Justice Department initiative to dramatically expand the scope of market manipulation the agency targets for criminal prosecutions, beyond traditional insider trading and futures manipulation into a range of asset classes, sources told Reuters.The effort, if successful, raises the stakes for traders with potential jail-time, while",0.9945

3596,"Gonna get into a couple bank stocks. I have shunned them for years and years because I have preferred businesses whose business is straightforward- they make something and sell it. Banking seems to me an artificial business largely built around the economic policies that the government happens to operate under.But it seems like the policy environment is pretty stable and the banks seem to be pretty reliably able to make money, and I don't get the impression that interest rate shifts pose much risk of major impairment of bank profits.So I'm getting in. But which ones? Barrons had an article about them, and I kind of gravitated toward two. JPM and C. I know Citibank was a big mess in the past but it sounds like they are pretty much back on solid ground.One thing I liked about these two is negative enterprise value. But I'm not familiar enough with this industry to know whether that is indeed a virtue of these (like it would be in most businesses), or if it is just an artifact of different ways in which the banks show their financials. In terms of ""different ways of accounting"", I see one bank showing most of its liabilities as accounts payable, and another as ""other liabilities"". I would guess that since they are similar businesses that is simply a case where there's more than one way to document those liabilities. I would guess what those liabilities are the balances accountholders have in their checking or savings accounts with the bank. Anyway, you will be able to tell I am a greenhorn as far as bank investing. Curious what JPM shareholders feel about the other banks, if you own other bank stock(s) than JPM, which ones and why?",0.9939

It includes at least two dozen officials who served under Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W.

3625,"Here is my analysis and why such unexpected happen after market simple 5% flash crash (Normally it go up 3% in one day and so 5% is not that serious).So We all know info go quick. Everyone know Volatility going to raise and so everyone try to exit similar time. That increase no of contract $XIV and other need to cover.Now here is where problem is. Normally they find big enough player to buy for 5-10% premium and so loss is very small. This time they haven't found anyone (I will put why in my contradiction theory). So they found buyer that wipeout 90% value overnight only and VIX jump because of this. Worst case scenario played out.Now My contradiction theory.Reason:-1.> Trade happen right at close. Which mean someone knew and ready with buy order of that size to match sell order so it quickly execute. 2.> It all most wipeout entire value but not gone negative of $SVXY & $XIV (Both endup with $4 NAV)3.> Bond market already reverse bigway main reason for market drop & so Market going to recover as well.4.> VIX unlikely remain that high, You need few billions and almost gureenteed profit. There are lot of big fishes out there and it consider peanut in today's market term.5.> Biggest holders said they have hedge and not suffer any losses.So What is my contradiction TheorySimple:- Trading revenue keep going down because volatility remain lower. This make harder for big firm like $GS, $JPM, $MS, $BAC,$C and other to make profit. So They plan entire event. First starting with Sell off and then determine exact price where inverse VIX wipe out. Knowing there is billion to make and yet finding buyer who only ready to buy at price that remove all most all equity on such fund everything is well planned and executed.Benefit:- 1.> Bring volatility back (Volatility Index double in seconds, Never happen before) This mean big player will make billions in trading.2.> Long term reason for low volatility gone. Since this index fund always gone up, lot of retail using as profit instrument and holding very long term. Now such fund not going to become big enough that it impact and run market volatility low.In other word Big player win big time. They all make billions from these index fund, able to reverse their trading profit and remove long term volatility killer.All retail investor suffer big big time.( If you short or long put then overnight lottery but they know how to take that money back)",0.9915

Today at 89 she still swims walks 3 miles a day. She eats almost anything she wants like a Warren. But always drank lots of cold water my cousin was a doctor and he always said drink 8 cold glasses a day, not sure why cold, but common sense says it cleaner then and tastes better cold for sure.He died in this eighties but was always in great health and in great shape as a surgeon you had to be.anyway, she always said do things in moderation, anything you want and you will be fine. She always read books like Warren, always investing in stocks like warren and usually never sold like Warren. She always bought value and held for the long - term out running in the woods today I saw the most people I have in 25 years, people of all ages no one running like me but at all hiking, it has been building the past month but today was crazy, so I think this virus will in the long run probably save 1,000,000 lives or more, people are so out of shape in the USA it is not funny you see kids in high school walking the track for their mile run day with sandals on if that was my kid I would have a heart attack, some schools no gym now, just crazy people get out there get in shape today period, no more excuses. Get out there today, stay healthy, and stay alive.But what really strikes me is people this weekend most driving in their cars by themselves all wearing masks today. But at the parks by me at least almost nobody has them on. So we really as a country we have lost our way.Airlines want you to wear a mask know, as things open up, how was this not mandatory or not being done the past 45 days. Everything is done backward, sideways, everybody has a different opinion. I have never seen something that seems simple, use common sense wear masks period if you go out. Yet our leaders don't wear them in hospitals, I really not sure what all this means yet other than massive USA debt for all. Even Warren Buffet said last night he has no idea how this will end but it probably won't be good he said. So, in fact, he sold stocks last quarter and bought none. Even his stock was much higher last quarter when he bought but he did nothing with this time, which means he likes cash more today. That is a statement itself.But there are always good values he said, so if you stay in your lane, don't buy on margin and buy when things are 30%-50% below tangible book, and the business is doing good, you should do more than fine.Remember what you pay is almost always the most important factor for your risk-reward and returns, but also so you don't get shaken out if you buy too high and it gets hit, usually, you get shaken out. You must stick to what you know and buy heavily when the time is right which is usually once every 5 or ten years.Right now the values are in the Smaller bank stocks and there are plenty, even Warren owns mostly banks, even thou they are the bigger ones, if he could he would be buying the smaller ones hand over fist today. Not all but just the select few names with the strong asset quality that have around been around 150 years like, AROW under $22 if it gets back there and OPY under $18.50 it is $18 today. OPY is 33% under tangible book value earning 10% return a year on its capital and they bought 409,000 shares back at $20.60 in march so in May they will buy many more. AROW, is just over the tangible book but earning like a 12% return on capital on a consistent basis for 100 years plus. These two are as safe as it gets at today's levels in an over-all high priced stock market.Douglas Hughes5/7/2020.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. 854 people get AROW breaking news and analysis by email alertGet email alerts Comments 0 • Sort by Newest Bhughes7918 Add Your Comment: (NEW!

The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was admitted to the ICU in March 2020 for COVID-19 and put on respiratory isolation. The patient was treated with steroids, broad spectrum antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia and bronchodilators for possible COPD exacerbation and hydroxychloroquine with zinc. The patient continued to deteriorate for the next 12 weeks with an increase in oxygen demand from continuous low-flow oxygen to high-flow and eventually intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during that time.At week 13 of hospitalization and multiple unsuccessful attempts at oxygen weaning, an emergency single use IND for lenzilumab, Humanigen’s Humaneered anti-human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody drug candidate, was approved by the FDA and administered to the patient. Seven days following the administration of lenzilumab, the patient’s oxygen decreased from high-flow to low-flow nasal cannula and the patient was able to walk outside of his hospital room with physical therapy.

He overcharged members of the military on mortgages and mortgage refinancing transactions. He overcharged customers for overdraft fees. He manipulated bidding on California and Midwest electricity markets. He overcharged homeowners for flood insurance. He billed customers for nonexistent credit card monitoring services. He charged minorities higher rates and fees on mortgages than those paid by white borrowers. He failed to pay overtime to company workers. Yes, JPMorgan Chase had to pay more fines than any other financial institution in the country, but the profits more than offset its fraudulent and criminal activity.It is Dimon, along with fellow oligarchs Gates and the billionaire investor Leon Cooperman, who has recently led the attack on Warren. Dimon chastised her for her “wealth tax” plan and for allegedly vilifying “successful people.” Cooperman accused Warren of seeking to wreck the American dream.
