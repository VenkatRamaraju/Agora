Chung rates NIO shares Hold and has a $57.60 price target for shares.This is good news for high-growth EV stocks such as NIO, which is down about 30% year to date.

93,"What is happening is that Wall St. hates Cathie Wood, so they are shorting her ETF's to pieces which means all the individual stocks within her ETF's are headed south. Tesla will take all EV's down lower, and Musk's crypto plays aren't helping. Wall St./GS and hedge funds are in control. I can't remember seeing where DOW and S&P rise again and again while anything tech heads south. Inflation fears are way overblown, as they shouldn't cause tech stocks to crumble like this. GS is up and yet during real inflation, you want to be far away from banks. Went through high inflation in the mid 1970's. Banks love low inflation normally, because if they can borrow money at 1% and loan it out at 1.5%, that is a huge huge spread for them. I remember when banks had to pay 15% for a jumbo CD, but they could only loan money at 17% which was a much smaller spread that the 1-1.5% spread. I doubt inflation will hold like it did in the 1970's. but it could be an interesting ride for awhile. US is bashing China, yet China is playing the game much better than the US. Chinese EV's are selling more and more. Nearly all the buses are EV in China now and all the motorbikes are EV's. NIO is growing at a good pace in China and will succeed. Look at NIO's debt and then go look at GM and Ford's debt. Learn Mandarin folks. Go to you tube and watch some WHEELSBOY and his reviews on cars in China. Hang on to your hat.

The Chinese government has developed new regulatory standards for electric vehicle battery swap stations, and NIO -- which operates one of the country's largest battery swap networks -- helped to write the new regulations. The new rules will go into effect on Nov. 1.￼NIO REPORTEDLY HELPED WRITE NEW REGULATIONS GOVERNING BATTERY-SWAP STATIONS IN CHINA. THE REGULATIONS WILL GO INTO EFFECT IN NOVEMBER. IMAGE SOURCE: NIO.That's not why the stock is down today, of course. It's always hard to be sure, but I think it's probably down for a couple of reasons. First, U.S. electric commercial vehicle maker Workhorse Group reported first-quarter results that were well below Wall Street's expectations, at least with respect to revenue. The company shipped just six of its new delivery vans in the quarter, as various issues complicated its effort to ramp up production. Analysts had expected a much higher total. Did that sour some investors on the electric-vehicle segment as a whole? While NIO's business is in a much better place than Workhorse's, it's possible that Workhorse's woes were contributing to the broader EV stock sell-off on Monday.Now whatIt's also worth noting that segment leader Tesla has been under selling pressure recently. Tesla's stock was also down over 5% at 2:30 p.m. on Monday, and while the reasons for that are unrelated to NIO's business, investors have tended to buy and sell Tesla and other electric vehicle stocks as a group in recent weeks.",0.9875

Following the company's recent swoon, the Street is forecasting upside of as much as 53%.The ""Why NIO?"" question is pretty simple to answer: EVs are the future of the auto industry, and China is the largest auto market in the world. By 2035, the Society of Automotive Engineers of China has predicted that half of all auto sales will be new-energy vehicles, with roughly 95% of those being EVs.

Blame it on the side effect of the second vaccine shot.Here is my routine earnings call summary covering what wasn’t necessarily broadcasted or detailed by analyst publications with my thoughts added in parentheses. Hopefully, more details will be broadcasted in the coming days. NIO earnings call is always full of content. This one continues to show consistent vision, great progress on execution and built-in conservatism in projections. I definitely expect more great things to happen down the road.It took NIO 26 months to deliver the first 50,000 vehicles. It took nine months to deliver the second 50,000 vehicles.100 kWh battery pack widely welcome and take rate on new cars exceeded expectation; 10,000+ users already; 100kwh upgrade for existing cars available in June5 days of production suspension certainly had a negative impact in April (which was already reflected in the 7,100 units delivery result); those days were used to modify production line in preparation for ET7 mass production.During the Shanghai Auto Show, 180 NIO user volunteers worked at the NIO booth to explain products to visitors; 15 NIO users worked with experts to give 14 sessions/speeches on NIO Life; NIO user artwork show.Vehicle margin: current level comfortable and healthy; achieved earlier than expected.Chip shortage: There will be a delay in the impact of the Japan semiconductor company fire to be felt in mid-May. Expect inflection point in third quarter. Hundreds of NIO suppliers/partners just had a meeting. They are all very supportive of NIO’s business operation. (My interpretation: We are not promising or guaranteeing anything. But, our suppliers got our back.)Extraordinary General Meeting: Increase number of board members to be more diversified. Grant the NIO user trust the right to nominate directors to the board. (My thinking: William Li’s vision to build NIO into a user enterprise is genuine, which is reflected in all the moves he took. This is another significant step which will be recognized and appreciated by the affluent people in China. A lot of NIO users are successful entrepreneurs, small business users, company executives who desire to be part of the force to nurture NIO’s growth and see it become a first class global company. Also, there is a lot of eagerness from NIO users to become NIO shareholders. NIO’s continuous focus on user experience and user participation in management will undoubtedly have the chain effect of attracting a bigger user base and investor base in China once the company turns profitable and lists in China. Geely started to say they will build clubhouses etc. and was already called a copycat instead of being genuine. I admire Li’s originality and believe his genuine innovation will go further than profit driven copycats.)Competitor: NIO is very confident of overall competitiveness in premium brand market. NIO will be more competitive in the long run.ET7: Pushed up the schedule for suppliers, possible to start delivery in Q1 2022. NIO’s history of one new product per year showed massive capability and expertise in pushing high quality products out timely.Neo park: Government fund infrastructure, not NIO. Hundreds of companies will be there. NIO will be the most important. Huge benefits come from talent concentration, operational and supply chain efficiency improvement, etc. Example: when battery and whole car factories are next to each other, $100 per car saving just in battery logistics cost reduction. On the 1 million unit capacity, it can be tapped by anyone. If NIO gets there fast enough, it can be NIO’s. The same manufacture cooperation model. NIO focuses on process, technology, quality assurance, invest in some equipments; not on land, factory, staffing and operation.SINOPEC deal: No revenue or profit sharing agreement at this point. Use SINOPEC sites and share service personnel. Partnership isn’t exclusive for either company. NIO has sufficient location resources.Balancing gross margin and market share: No price cut to gain more market share. Brand reputation and community are important. NIO wants to be the Porsche which sells a small portion of VW’s units but accounts for 40%+ profit. Global premium market is 10+ million units. Massive room for growth. NIO wants to be a long-term winner.In-source chip design and production: This is a long-term topic, no specific plan to share.R&D expense: It goes with ET7 development stage. It will go up from Q2 while approaching ET7 production. Will increase investment in NT2/NT3 as well. Multiple products being developed in pipeline.Raw material cost: Well controlled because routine cost reductions more than offsetting the increases. Overall cost is still going down.Solid state battery progress on track.I can’t wait to have my very own ET7 when it hits US and become a proud NIO volunteer if I’m lucky enough to qualify.",0.9997

Although investors might worry that price cuts instituted in the country on Tesla’s Model Y crossover EV might eat into NIO’s business, Feng says that, to the contrary, in China Tesla tends to serve a useful purpose by attracting owners of traditional internal combustion engine cars to the idea of owning an electric vehicle. But once they’re interested, customers often prefer to buy a NIO.Why? Name recognition is one factor. Feng says that within China, NIO has 80% brand awareness, and is admired for its interior design, handling/suspension, and “post-purchase service” — in particular its technology that permits batteries in NIO cars to be “chargeable, swappable, and upgradeable” (to batteries with longer range). 55% of NIO owners today subscribe to the company’s “Battery-as-a-Service” plan, buying their cars, but subscribing to the batteries that run them.

We want you to once again feel the joy of owning a car.The question we ask ourselves is simple: Since driving a car leads to more pollution, and owning a car can be laborious, why should we still own cars?The answer is: People long for personalized experiences, just as they do with all other aspects of life. What if your car knew you and your preferences, and managed to make it less stressful to travel in traffic?We want to give the car manufacturers' premium services a whole new meaning. This means that we will produce products and offer services based on what customers need and want from a vehicle. This means that we deliver a fantastic ownership experience that will give you the same excited feeling as when you bought your first car.When this experience exceeds expectations, electric vehicles will simply be the most natural choice for everyone, and it will give us a more sustainable future. Then our vision of a cleaner planet can become a reality.In the beginning, cars gave people a whole new freedom by being able to get around on their own.In the future, the cars will go one step further and ensure that they do not have to steer the car themselves.

NIO president says EV maker has capacity expansion plans: https://cnevpost.com/2021/04/20/nio-president-says-ev-maker-has-capacity-expansion-plans/NIO has further plans for capacity deployment and aims to announce them by May 1, Qin Lihong, co-founder and president of the Chinese electric vehicle company, said Monday.Qin made the remarks in an interview with Chinese media when asked if NIO was building a second factory.The NIO plant's capacity rose to 7,500 units per month at the beginning of the year, and deliveries last month were close to 7,300 units, with an actual capacity of a little more than 7,500 units, he said.NIO can produce 150,000 units per year and expects to reach it in less than a year, he said, adding that capacity is never a problem to worry about in China.In late January, CnEVPost reported that the construction of NIO's second plant has entered the construction bidding stage.The Hefei Public Resources Exchange Center issued a tender announcement to recruit contractors for the construction of a new energy passenger vehicle body parts project for Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Co.The announcement did not specify that the project is NIO's second plant, but cls.cn quoted the project manager as saying, ""This project is the second plant JAC is building for NIO, and the current production capacity is no longer enough.""The announcement shows that the estimated contract price of the project is about RMB 350 million ($54 million), with a planned construction period of 370 calendar days.The construction of the project includes a new painting workshop, PDI workshop, energy center and sewage treatment station, parking lot for finished vehicles, shipping yard for finished vehicles and related supporting auxiliary facilities.3. NIO president says long-term preparations must be made for chip shortage:https://cnevpost.com/2021/04/20/nio-president-says-long-term-preparations-must-be-made-for-chip-shortage/With many black swan events happening in the world that are affecting chip supply, ""we have to be prepared for the long term, which is a new subject,"" Qin Lihong, co-founder and president of Chinese electric vehicle company NIO, said Monday.Qin said in a media interview on Monday that many people think of chips as a problem, but in fact chips are a series of problems. For example, there are 80 chips used in the NIO ES8 car, containing 40-50 categories.The recent shortage is not of computing chips for autonomous driving, but of basic chips, such as weight-sensing chips for seats, he said.Instead of having a shortage of one chip for several months in the past six months, a different chip has been facing shortages every week, according to Qin.""There are a lot of black swan events happening in the world that are impacting chip supply. I think we have to be prepared for the long term in this regard, and this is a new subject,"" he said.Super Long NIO. Cheers!",0.9975

After hitting a high of $66.99 Jan 11 on the momentum imparted by the announcements at the Nio Day event, the shares consolidated the gains until early February.The market-wide tech sell-off in February proved a dampener for Nio, as the stock tumbled from a high of $64.60 on Feb. 10 to a low of $31.91 on March 5, a peak-trough decline of a little over 50%.Subsequently, the stock has bounced off the bottom around $35 three times, completing the triple bottom.If Nio shares sustain the uptrend, immediate resistance lies around $41.

Nio clocked a total of 7,404 SUV sales in April — with the ES6 model selling the most at 3,302 vehicles, EC6 sales were 2,484 units and ES8 sales at 1,618 units, the report said.

The park will invest RMB 50 billion in the first phase, and the total annual output value will reach RMB 500 billion. It will have an annual capacity of 1 million vehicles and 100GWh of batteries. The park covers an area of 16,950 mu (11.3 square kilometers), about 12 times the size of Tesla's Fremont facility, and is divided into an intelligent manufacturing area, an R&D living area, and an ecological and cultural area. The goal is to build an intelligent electric vehicle industry cluster that is world-class in scale, innovation, talent, and efficiency, according to William Li, founder, chairman, and CEO of NIO. After the Neo Park is completed, NIO can save RMB 3,000 per vehicle in logistics costs, Li said, adding that currently, the average mileage of NIO's entire vehicle logistics is 901 kilometers, which is much less than the likes of Mercedes-Benz and BMW.""

515,"3 Stocks That Offer Explosive Potential GainsAll of these companies have major catalysts ahead of them.NIOnvestors looking for stocks with explosive growth potential sometimes seek out companies in sectors like biotech, where the outcomes can be almost binary. In the realm of cutting-edge healthcare, each hopeful new product or treatment will either be a success that could lead to monster profits, or fail to pass regulatory muster and earn nothing. Enough failures, and such companies' stock prices can go to zero. These three companies, on the other hand, have massive growth opportunities, but much less of that all-or-nothing risk. They either have successful businesses already, or are quickly growing in sectors that seem to have unstoppable momentum.Some of the catalysts that will be driving their share prices are more short term, while others will likely take years to play out. But there are good reasons to expect that electric vehicle (EV) maker NIO (NYSE:NIO), EV charging network leader ChargePoint Holdings (NYSE:CHPT), and North American steelmaker Nucor (NYSE:NUE) could produce significant gains for shareholders in the years ahead. NIO ET7 electric luxury sedan. THE NIO ET7 ELECTRIC LUXURY SEDAN IS EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE STARTING IN 2022. IMAGE SOURCE: NIO.NIO: A massive and growing marketAs recently as early 2020, Shanghai-based NIO was flirting with bankruptcy. But a push by the Chinese government to accelerate the growth of that country's EV industry contributed to a strong surge in sales. The company more than doubled its vehicle deliveries in 2020 compared to 2019, though that still only amounted to about 44,000 electric cars. Its production growth rate is accelerating, however. In the first quarter of 2021, deliveries soared by more than 400% year over year to over 20,000.EV sales in China surpassed 1 million in 2020, and the government's goal is to expand that annual number to 5 million by 2025. According to a forecast from sector research organization BloombergNEF, China's EV sales could reach 10 million by 2030, and approach 20 million by 2040.The opportunity that degree of market growth represents hasn't been lost on investors. NIO stock is up more than 1,000% since its period of financial struggles a year ago. But its shares are also down by more than 40% from their recent peak. NIO's current $60 billion market capitalization is still pricing in an enormous amount of anticipated growth.The automaker will begin selling its ET7 luxury sedan early next year, and it recently announced plans for a new production factory. Its unique battery-swap subscription service, and an agreement with Ford (NYSE:F) to allow Chinese Mach E buyers to use NIO's charging network, will also add to its revenue streams.

596,"Positive comments coming from UBS:NIO IncSolid 21Q1 result with margin strengthQ: How does the result compare to expectation?Beat. Nio reported Q1 net loss of Rmb451mn, better than our estimate of Rmb811mnand VisibleAlpha consensus of Rmb1,110mn. Revenue came in at Rmb7,982mn, about6% ahead of consensus and our estimate, mainly due to stronger-than-expectedproduct mix, brought by 100kWh battery pack variant (25% adoption rate) and Nio Pilot(~50% adoption rate). Vehicle GPM came in at 21.2%, a historical new height andahead of both our estimate of 17.4% and consensus of 16.7%, largely due to thissuperior product mix.Q: What’s the most noteworthy in the result?This result contrasts with some peers who missed on Q1 result and may ease someinvestor concerns on Tesla Model Y impact on Nio ES6. The ability to shift product mix upin this rising competitive environment has indeed demonstrated Nio’s capability tosecure customer loyalty, due to its continuous brand building efforts. On the expenseside, R&D came in with Rmb 687mn only, 17% down q/q and >30% below our andconsensus forecast. In view that the company needs to accelerate its ET7 developmentfrom Q2 onwards, this part of cost saving might not sustain, as R&D is necessary anywayin our view. Overall, we consider -4% OPM for a company at this stage with 7k/monthvolume a decent achievement.Q: Has the outlook changed?Probably slightly upwards. Management guided Q2 delivery of 21-22k, which webelieve is largely in line with market expectation. As the product mix shifts upwards,there might be some upside potentials for its FY21 GPM assumptions.Valuation:After pulling back by 20% YTD, the stock is currently trading at 11.5/7.4x 21/22E EV/sales, compared to 11.4/8.2x of Tesla.

609,"3 Top Robinhood Stocks to Buy in MayNIO: A massive market opportunityThere is huge potential for growth in the electric vehicle (EV) sector. Chinese EV maker NIO (NYSE:NIO) is a leader in the world's largest automotive market. There will be plenty of competition, but the company's sales are growing quickly, and it has begun construction on a new manufacturing facility. NIO delivered 20,060 vehicles in a strong first quarter, a jump of over 400% from the prior-year period. Deliveries in April 2021 grew 125% over last year's April shipments and this speed bump in growing sales has been a factor in the recent decline in the stock price. In late March, the company told investors it is being affected by the global semiconductor shortage -- a headwind being felt by many automakersNIO has several things investors should be excited about. Its new ET7 luxury sedan that will be available early next year expands its offerings beyond its current SUV designs. It is also expanding a network of battery swap and recharging stations that should help demand grow throughout the country, and bring NIO a growing income stream from the service. And NIO plans to expand beyond China. It recently announced an upcoming news conference where it will detail plans to enter the European market, beginning with Norway.NIO is still growing toward profitability and is worth a look for investors comfortable with risk as the EV market is expected to soar.

Its walking in the footsteps of Apple. This company has epic foundations. Winning formula E and developing a super car (EP9) holding a lap record around the Nurburgring, more than once. Take a look at NIO House in Beijing - it is the epitome of what NIO represents. It’s a lifestyle beyond the car. NIO cars will soon have a 1000km solid state battery and incase that isn’t enough then feel free to visit one of the 200+ battery swap stations, increasing every day + 300,000 fast charging stations over multiple cities in China. A swap station will have a fully charged battery in your car in 3minutes. They have now competed TWO MILLION SWAPS! This tech, while slower to scale than super chargers, is exactly what the EV market is lacking. This is one the greatest stigmas for EV, having to WAIT on your battery charging and worry about degradation. Imagine the continued scope for new service plans and flowing revenues with this model. Oh, and don’t forget a healthy tapped 2nd hand car market. Encore - Sinopec. As for the new ET7 sedan - Nio Partnered with NVIDIA to put their DRIVE Orin-powered supercomputer dubbed ADAM into their car. This supercomputer, will feature four high-performance Orin SoCs in each of its EVs to achieve an industry leading performance of 1,000+ TOPS!!

A total of 11 8MP cameras, a 1,550nm LiDAR sensor, five mmWaveRad, 12 USS and two GPS / IMU as well as one V2X and one ADMS sensor are installed in the NIO ET7.Aquila, is the name for the first high resolution camera (8 MP) that is installed in a vehicle. In comparison, Tesla uses a 1.2 MP camera. The higher resolution and display enables the NIO ET7 to recognize objects and obstacles at a greater distance and to let the system react accordingly. NIO underpins this with numbers, so the system is able to recognize vehicles at a distance of 687 meters; Tesla at 229 meters. Traffic cones would be seen at a distance of 262 meters (Tesla 87 meters) and people at a distance of 223 meters (Tesla 74 meters).As I said before, you also buy into a service as much as a car with Nio.

What’s Tesla doing? **tumbleweed**As for the market - do any of you truly understand how underpinning the success of a company is with the power of the Asian market? It’s ENORMOUS. It’s economy is now bigger than America, 40% of Tesla cars are sold here and with good reason. The demand is unprecedented. The supply simply can’t meet the demand. There’s room for both but Nio will dominate China and make waves in Europe and America. Heck, it would be immensely great with the Asian market alone. Before you know it you’ll be gopping at your neighbours NIO car, while you ping your 5 minute microwave (made in China) meal waiting for your Tesla to charge.

673,"TX Immediately following the fatal Tesla crash in Texas this weekend, reports from both local and national media outlets emerged citing the statements of Harris County Pct. 4 Constable Mark Herman, who remarked that police were 100% certain that there was no one in the driver seat of the ill-fated Model S when it crashed. Herman also commented that the Tesla fire was so severe that it took over 30,000 gallons of water and four hours to extinguish the flames from the crash, and that firefighters had to reach out to the EV maker for help in battling the fire. These statements have since been debunked (at least to some degree) by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who noted that data logs that have been recovered so far from the ill-fated Model S indicate that Autopilot was not enabled during the crash, and that the vehicle did not have any Full Sell-Driving functions activated. Musk’s update essentially threw a wrench on the pervading narrative that Autopilot likely caused the tragic crash. And now, even the reports about the Tesla fire have been thrown into question–by the man whose team extinguished the blaze no less. In a statement to the Houston Chronicle, Palmer Buck, fire chief for The Woodlands Township Fire Department, noted that contrary to some reports in the media, the Tesla Model S fire did not burn out of control for four hours. Interestingly enough, Buck remarked that his team actually managed to put down the fire within two to three minutes, which was enough for authorities to see that there were occupants in the vehicle. After these first two to three minutes, it was only a matter of keeping the batteries as cool as possible by pouring small amounts of water into the damaged battery pack. Buck described the fire department’s strategy in the following statement. “With respect to the fire fight, unfortunately, those rumors grew way out of control. It did not take us four hours to put out the blaze. Our guys got there and put down the fire within two to three minutes, enough to see the vehicle had occupants. After that, it was simply cooling the car as the batteries continued to have a chain reaction due to damage.“We could not tear it apart or move it around to get ‘final extinguishment’ because the fact that we had two bodies in there and it was then an investigation-slash-crime scene. We had to keep it cool, were on scene for four hours, but we were simply pouring a little bit of water on it. It was not because flames were coming out. It was a reaction in the battery pan. It was not an active fire,” Buck said.As for the rumors that the fire department had to call a Tesla hotline for tips on how to handle a battery fire, the Fire Chief stated that these reports were untrue. “We did not (call Tesla), and I do not know where (that rumor) came from. There is a chance someone else did, maybe the Harris County Fire Marshal, but we did not call (Tesla). Tesla has an emergency manual for first responders,” Buck said. He also noted that he is not aware of Tesla having a hotline for tips on how to control a battery fire. Buck also provided some new details about the Model S crash and how the fire department was involved. According to the fire chief, the first calls about the incident did not involve reports about a car at all. Instead, initial reports were about a fire in the woods. And while the Model S fire was notable when the firefighters arrived, it only took minutes to control the blaze from the vehicle. “The first calls that came in were a fire in the woods. Then we got at 9:30 p.m. where we got the first call when someone said, ‘I see a car in a tree, and it is on fire. They reported a car hit a tree, and it had exploded… That is when we added extra units (to the response). There is a big lake, and (the accident) was just to the left of the lake, closer to the exiting part of the street, not the end of the cul de sac. It was at an undeveloped lot. “(The Tesla) was heavily involved in flames. When the fire was put out, it was noticed there were two bodies (inside), and they were deceased. They continued extinguishment of the woods around (the car), putting out the trees and pine needles and what have you. I was there probably five to 10 minutes after that and at that point, every once in a while, the (battery) reaction would flame and it was mainly keeping water pouring on the battery,” Buck explained, adding that this was a process recommended by Tesla in cases of burning batteries.While a number of the initial reports about the tragic Tesla crash this weekend have been debunked by Elon Musk and now, the fire chief for The Woodlands Township Fire Department, the incident continues to attract some degree of drama. As per recent reports, Harris County Pct. 4 Constable Mark Herman has stated that investigators would be serving a search warrant on Tesla to gain all data from the ill-fated Model S.

676,"""The Chip Shortage Could Be on Its Way Out. Here’s Where Things Stand for the Auto Industry.By Al RootUpdated May 18, 2021 11:46 am ET / Original May 18, 2021 11:19 am ETBARRON'S NEWSLETTERSBarron's Tech\A shortage of semiconductors is delaying automotive production by millions of units around the globe, costing auto makers billions in profits—just as demand is surging after the Covid-19 pandemic. But recent commentary from car and chip makers suggests that there might be a light at the end of the tunnel for the industry and for automotive investors.Investors have heard plenty about the current state of capacity problems for months. Roughly 2 million cars—or about 10% of quarterly global automotive production—weren’t built in the first quarter because of no chips. Ford Motor (ticker: F), one of the auto makers feeling the shortage most acutely, said in late April that it expects to lose about 50% of planned second-quarter production.It has been much harder for automotive investors to get a sense of when these supply chains issues actually will improve. But Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO (NIO) and chip maker Semiconductor Manufacturing International (0981.Hong Kong) are now offering some signs of hope for the industry.Last week, NIO management sat down with Citigroup analyst Jeff Chung. The analyst says NIO expects the situation to ease in the June-July time frame. That’s a brighter outlook from late April, when NIO said on its first-quarter earnings conference call that the chip shortage was getting more severe.https://www.barrons.com/articles/chip-shortage-cars-nio-ford-51621351133?siteid=yhoof2",0.9792

710,"China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) earlier this month approved the National Standard for Battery Swap Safety Requirements for Electric Vehicles (GB/T 40032-2021), making it the industry's first mandatory standard governing the development of the battery swap model.The standard, drafted by companies including NIO, Beijing Electric Vehicle Co Ltd, and Geely, will come into effect on Nov. 1 this year, specifying safety requirements, test methods, and inspection rules for battery swappable electric vehicles.The SAMR said the standard is the first basic national standard in the battery swap field in China's automotive industry, which will help improve the safety level of electric vehicles using battery swap technology in terms of mechanical strength, electrical safety, environmental adaptability, and other aspects to ensure the safety of battery swap electric vehicles.The process for the development of the standard, released by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) on May 10, shows that it began pre-study in November 2018, drafting in February 2020, and soliciting public comments in March 2020.According to the standard, models with snap-on batteries need to be able to support at least 5,000 battery swaps, while models with bolt-on batteries need to be able to support at least 1,500 battery swaps.Currently, battery swap-enabled vehicles are already in production, with NIO being the only vehicle company to deliver such vehicles on a large scale to the general consumer.Beijing Electric Vehicle is offering a large number of these vehicles to the cab market.Since last year, the battery swap model has received strong support from Chinese policy, with several government departments mentioning support for the construction of battery swap infrastructure.Last April, China set a requirement that subsidies for the new energy vehicle industry must be priced under RMB 300,000, but battery swap-enabled models are exempt from this requirement, allowing the high-end NIO to continue to enjoy past subsidies.As for why China supports the development of the battery swap model, Vice Minister of MIIT Xin Guobin mentioned the advantages of the model at a conference last year. Here is what he said: First, the battery swap model allows the body to be separated from the battery, which can reduce the cost of purchasing a vehicle for consumers. Second, the battery swap time is shorter than the time to fill a tank of gas, which can make consumers travel more conveniently. Third, the battery operation company will monitor, maintain and manage the battery centrally, which is conducive to extending the life of the power battery and improving the safety of the battery. Fourth, such batteries can be charged at preferential rates during off-peak hours, thus reducing charging costs. Fifth, consumers can consider how large the capacity of the battery rented that day according to the daily mileage, saving energy. Sixth, the battery swap model can also give rise to new service models.",0.9799

Just because you’re long doesn’t mean you’re immune to stress in seeing your investment drop!! With huge potential, amazing financials and a sound management team, there is no reason why this stock should be dropping. So why is it? Its dropping because fellow investors are getting nervous and selling at a loss to try and salvage some of their investment. They are selling because there are plenty of forces out there manipulating false news, spreading rumours about poor products, management, financials etc. to scare you into selling. When you panic sell you’re helping drive the SP down! Unless you’re desperate and need the money, DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS!!! You would never take your money and light it on fire, so why would you sell at a loss? That’s exactly what you’re doing. So how can we see our investment in this company grow? If we ALL band together as fellow investors and do the following we will see SP stop dropping and can get this turned around so we can all sleep stress free!1. Stop Selling your shares - at least for 1 quarter (3 months for those who don’t know what a quarter is) let your investment sit.2. Put a Sell Order with a High limit for min 1 quarter – How do you do this? Its simple and will take you a few minutes…Go into your trading account or call your broker and put a sell limit on every single share. Put the sell limit price super high and specify the sell date out by minimum 90 days. For Canadian stocks the furthest date you can specify is 90 days and for US stocks its 180 days. Here’s a link for your ease on how to prevent your shares from being borrowed by shorts (https://www.contracts-for-difference.com/borrowing-lending-shares.html) If we ALL do the above two steps, short sellers will be extremely limited in their ability to short the stock. They won’t be able to borrow your shares to drive price down!!! Yes, for all new investors, that’s exactly what they are doing…go to google and research “Shorting a stock” here’s a link for ease (https://www.fidelity.ca/fidca/en/investor/shortingstocks). You will quickly realise that if you follow the above to steps you will stop your shares from being borrowed. Now, after you’ve done the above two steps…go now and start doing research about the company, their products, their future, what is the potential of their product etc. This company makes products which ARE the future. They are going to change the way we live!!! PLEASE STOP getting tricked into selling your shares to shorts and see your investment grow! Now sit back, stop stressing and your hard earned money will start to grow. God Bless our investment! BUY, HOLD, and PROSPER!",0.9989

Nio will become profitable in less than 2 years and only needs China to do so. Maybe in the short term bears will say it's bad. But judging by the ammount the FED has printed and will continue to print. I'm bullish on stocks as a store of wealth easily accessible to all. Minimum wage will increase as well. It'll be another bu run supplemented by the devalue of the dollar. Don't worry though. Other countries are going through bailouts as well, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It just means that assets will continue to rise over time. If you realized how fast your dollar loses value, where will you put your money?Gold & silver? Not a bad choice, but a burden to carry or rely on others to hold.Stocks? Very easy to access, store of wealth, future companies that will generate revenue will be great choices. Nio will be profitable in less than 2 years. Tapping into new energy and EV.Housing? Low interest rates do not validate the all time high housing prices. And so far it looks like we will have a continued inflation of the bubble going over the proposed stimulus towards this bubble. So maybe. Assets will go up, stocks will go up.

'Buy them only if you’re prepared to lose all your money.'Andrew Bailey says he is being blunt about crypto assets. 'Buy them only if you’re prepared to lose all your money.'Cryptocurrencies “have no intrinsic value” and people who invest in them should be prepared to lose all their money, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said Thursday.Digital currencies like bitcoin, ether and even dogecoin have been on a tear this year, reminding some investors of the 2017 crypto bubble in which bitcoin blasted toward US$20,000, only to sink as low as US$3,122 a year later.Asked at a press conference about the rising value of cryptocurrencies on Thursday, Bailey said: “They have no intrinsic value. That doesn’t mean to say people don’t put value on them, because they can have extrinsic value. But they have no intrinsic value.”“I’m going to say this very bluntly again,” he added. “Buy them only if you’re prepared to lose all your money.”The Standard ChannelMore>>Bailey’s comments echoed a similar warning from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority.“Investing in cryptoassets, or investments and lending linked to them, generally involves taking very high risks with investors’ money,” the financial services watchdog said in January.“If consumers invest in these types of product, they should be prepared to lose all their money.”",0.7444

910,"The Nio normal: Chinese electric carmaker seeks to plug buyers into lifestyle appREUTERS 3:31 AM ET 4/27/2021 By Yilei Sun and Tony MunroeSHANGHAI (Reuters) - In Shanghai, aerospace executive Lu Hao didn't just buy a sleek electric SUV from Nio, China's answer to Tesla. He bought Nio's whole vision of a future where social media, e-commerce and the daily commute converge in one lifestyle app.In the morning, the 31-year-old eats cereal bought from the automaker's Nio Life online store while chatting on its app with other Nio owners. He wears Nio gear for the drive to and from work, and in the evenings relaxes at home with a glass of Nio wine and more chat with Nio owners about how to get the best out of their cars.""Buying Nio stuff has been a part of my daily life,"" said Lu, ""the prices are good and it is a habit to wear Nio clothes to events."" Over the past two years he has spent over 220,000 yuan ($34,000) on Nio Life products, on top of the 470,000 yuan he forked out to buy his ES8 SUV to replace a Ford Mondeo gasoline sedan. Automakers around the world have long sought to tap into brand loyalties with goods like branded t-shirts or caps. But Shanghai-based Nio's ambitions are much grander: a startup now valued at $70 billion according to its New York stock listing, it operates its own digital currency with tradeable credits that clients can gain from buying a car, attending events or even simply posting their stories on the Nio app.""Communities tend to lean towards loyalty ... that's exactly what Nio is tapping into,"" said Tu Le, analyst at China-based research firm Sino Auto Insights, referring to an app that Nio executives say now has around 150,000 daily users.""If Nio can continue to build the community, launch great products, and not have any major quality spills they are well-positioned to be a major player in China.""However, Le cautioned, ""Nio still hasn't figured out to convert more of the Nio community that haven't purchased a Nio vehicle into Nio (car) buyers, which is concerning.""THE NIO LIFEBacked by Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd as well as global investors betting on an electric car boom in the world's biggest auto market, Nio's huge market value - just above that of Germany's BMW - provides a stark contrast with thus-far tiny sales.It sold just under 44,000 cars last year in China, a fraction of BMW's 2 million-plus global sales, and remained firmly in the red though it narrowed net losses significantly to $860 million.Shanghai's Lu might be among the more enthusiastic Nio owners, but he is far from alone. More than 80% of Nio customers participate in online or real-life Nio community activities, using Nio credits, apps and showrooms, according to executives who said Nio has sold over 3 million Nio Life products so far.""Deep and close contacts with customers help us adjust to the changes of auto industry more quickly,"" Nio's co-founder and president Qin Lihong told Reuters in a recent interview. Qin said Nio will build a user community in foreign markets when it does branch out overseas - Europe being a likely market at some stage - but will adjust to local environments.The same community message has been picked up by others.Geely, China's biggest private automaker, launched a new electric Zeekr brand with a similar strategy of city centre showrooms and lifestyle product lines. Meanwhile BMW, which has a long-time lifestyle product line, launched its car-owner app in China in last September.Nio designed its app, which make its credits different from hotel's points or airline's miles, in such a way as to try to attract customers to interact more with the company, Nio's user relations executive Calvin Shen said. ""Buying a car is a less frequent activity than taking a flight or shopping at supermarket, so we need to create more everyday activities to keep customers in touch,"" Shen said.Buyers like Shanghai's Lu are on board with that, using some of his Nio credits to secure tickets for this year's edition of company's annual 'Nio Day' celebration. The Chengdu event, livestreamed on the app, saw the unveiling of the company's first sedan, the ET7 - now set to join Lu's collection of Nio goods.($1 = 6.4879 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Yilei Sun and Tony Munroe; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.

955,"April 22, 2021 03:24 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- News -- Since completing a triple-bottom formation around $35 on April 15, NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) shares have been recovering. The stock received some support from positive headlines this week out of the Shanghai auto show. Nio On The Cusp Of A Breakout? Completion of a triple bottom pattern, technically, is bullish for a security, signaling that a possible reversal is in the offing. The stock rebounding off the same level for the third time suggests it has a strong support and bears are giving up. After hitting a high of $66.99 Jan 11 on the momentum imparted by the announcements at the Nio Day event, the shares consolidated the gains until early February.The market-wide tech sell-off in February proved a dampener for Nio, as the stock tumbled from a high of $64.60 on Feb. 10 to a low of $31.91 on March 5, a peak-trough decline of a little over 50%.Subsequently, the stock has bounced off the bottom around $35 three times, completing the triple bottom.If Nio shares sustain the uptrend, immediate resistance lies around $41. Outside of this level, the stock may also find resistance around the $48.50 and $55.50 levels. Nio's Auto Show News: At the press event of the 19th International Automobile Industry Exhibition, widely known as Auto Shanghai 2021, Nio announced a Power North plan, the Blue Sky Lab fashion project and the interior of its flagship sedan ET7, which is slated for a commercial launch in the first quarter of 2022.At the event, William Li, the founder, chairman and CEO of Nio, presented optimistic projections about the Chinese EV market.Li said he expects new energy vehicle penetration to increase from 10% now to 20% in two years.Ahead of the Shanghai auto show, Nio announced a collaboration with Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company Limited (NYSE:SHI) for setting up its Power Swap Station 2.0 at the oil giant's gas filling stations.Upcoming Nio Catalysts: The coming few weeks are key for Nio. The company is scheduled to report its first-quarter results April 29.Analysts, on average, estimate a loss of 16 cents per share, narrower than the 25-cent-per-share loss in the year-ago period. Revenues are expected to jump over 400% year-over-year to $1.02 billion.On the earnings call, the company is likely to shed more details on new products and services, and chip availability. The company was forced to shutter its plant for a few days in late March and early April due to chip supply shortages. Nio's April deliveries update is due in early May. This number could be of particular interest to investors due to the five-day factory shutdown that began March 29. Rumors abound that Nio may announce its European expansion plan May 7 or 8. As the EV maker prepares for its maiden overseas foray, investors may be keen to find out more details regarding the timeline, targets, localization of production, distribution and pricing.Confirmation from the company regarding a potential secondary listing in Hong Kong is also seen as a positive for the stock. With the listing, the company is setting up the possibility of expanding its investor base and in turn financing sources.",0.9981

1044,"JP Morgan calls NIO's Q1 results 'clean beat' during industry headwindsPhate ZhangMay 1, 2021Despite the challenges faced by global car companies due to chip shortages, the Chinese electric car company NIO still delivered Q1 results that exceeded expectations. In JP Morgan's view, that was a clean beat and a surprise.NIO's unaudited earnings report showed that its revenue for the first quarter was RMB 7.98 billion yuan ($1.22 billion), beating market expectations of 6.65 billion yuan and up about 482% from a year ago.NIO's adjusted loss per ADS was RMB 0.23, a 75% reduction from RMB 0.93 in the fourth quarter.The company's gross margin was 19.5 percent in the first quarter, higher than 17.2 percent in the fourth quarter. Its vehicle margin was 21.2% in the first quarter, compared with a negative 7.4% in the same period last year. In a research note Friday, JP Morgan analyst Nick Lai's team said NIO ""surprisingly"" managed the industry headwinds well in the first quarter.The team wrote:Narratives at the company's 1Q21 result call today -despite a clean beat - mostly surrounded two major industry headwinds, which not only sent China auto stocks down, but in some cases pressured the companies' margins (e.g. Great Wall, BYD, SAIC): 1) chip shortages and production outlook, and 2) profitability from here in light of elevated material prices，production lost due to tight chip or battery supply and heightened industry competition.Nio, surprisingly, has managed all these well in 1Q21 with record-high vehicle GPM (21.2% vs JPM's earlier estimate of 17.3%) driven by content increases (through high take rate for100Khw battery and Nio pilot options) and contained BOM (bill of materials).The team said they will continue to look for signs of ""sequential improvement"" in chip supply and expect the problem to be fully mitigated by the end of the year or the first half of next year.Before the problem is fully alleviated, the chip supply situation could change from the current ""shortage"" to a potential ""tight"" and such an inflection point is likely to occur this summer, the team said.According to the team, if this scenario materializes, it should mark the bottom of the auto company's share price performance.In the long term, JP Morgan maintains a positive thesis on NIO and expects the company to achieve 106% and 93% volume growth in 2021 and 2022, respectively.",0.9975

1051,"The last couple of months have not made me question my commitment to NIO. It has only made me question the integrity of the market, and understand that things don't just keep going up. NIO is going to make me/us so much better off than I/we have ever been, and I am saying the absolute truth. This is coming from more research than I have ever invested in any stock.It is the perfect time for EV's, in the perfect country (China sells more than half of the world's EV's). The Chinese government has mandated/projected 5 million EV's sold/year by 2025, which is a 40% gain per year to reach that level. China bought about 1.2 million EV's last year, and projections are for over 5 million in 2025!!! That is an increase of about 40%, and if you projected NIO's stock price by 40%/ year, you are going to be around $300 by 2026. I actually think NIO will do better than that because they will eat up market share when they start to sell mid-range cars, increase their margins, start to sell their iconic ET7, and achieve their level 4 autonomous driving platform. I have been biting my nails the last couple of months, yet I haven't sold my NIO because I know this is the current GOLD STANDARD in the EV commodity, similar to Amazon in the early 2000's. I have been watching this go down, and all that has been impressed in me is that this is an oil well that is in it's infancy, with most people having no idea how big the well will become. I really believe that this will eventually be in the top 3-4 companies in the world, with the potential to be bigger than Apple! Fun fact! NIO just passed the 2 billion kilometer mark for NIO drivers!! This is data to be used in the development in their autonomous driving platform. Data IS the driving force (please excuse the pun) in autonomous driving! Li Bin has a vision that includes being the best autonomous driving platform. The Holy Grail in the future! NIO has 2 of the top 3 experts in autonomous driving. Research Ren Shaoquing (#1 in the world) and Zhang Jianyong (#3 in the world)! Both work for our NIO! Research who is the MOST cited in the world for autonomous driving! NIO acquired Momenta, an autonomous driving company from Ren Shaoquing, and made Ren a vice president under Li Bin. A quiet MOMENTOUS moment!! Battery swapping in the only country that has given subsidies for battery swapping, and oh, by the way, China chose NIO's battery swapping model as the standard!! I know I am considered a pumper, but it truly comes from the heart and research, and NIO is by far my biggest holding. My position built up in time as I learned more about NIO and Li Bin.

In an article Wednesday, state-owned media outlet People's Daily summed up their feelings about the show.Commentary from state-owned media is highly watched in China because they often imply policy signals and are an important reference for investors looking at industry trends.In the article, the People's Daily said that at this year's Shanghai auto show, for the first time, smart electric cars are no longer just a concept, but perceptible mass-produced products. At this year's Shanghai auto show, almost all foreign and Chinese brand car companies launched mass-produced smart electric vehicles, and more than 20 new smart electric vehicle brands, including Zeekr, Voyah, IM Motors, Hengchi, HiPhi, and R bran, took the stage with their main models that will be launched this year and next year, the article wrote.Huawei, DJI, Horizon Robotics, BlackSesame, and nearly 100 other companies in the chip, radar, advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous driving solutions, connected vehicles, and high precision mapping industries are also launching mass production products and solutions, the article mentions.""At this momentum, it is possible for China's new energy vehicle sales to break through 2 million units this year, or even exceed 2.5 million units.""

Having recently reported first quarter results, the company reported a new high in deliveries. NIO stock has shown volatility over the last few months. The stock was as high as $62 in Feb 2021 and declined to $35 in April 2021. As of close on Thursday, the stock was changing hands at $36.68. Needless to say, NIO is doing very well and it’s not stopping here. The company expects deliveries between 21,000 and 22,000 in the second quarter and total revenue between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion. Considering the way NIO is growing, the deliveries and revenue seem achievable. That, of course, will lead to a rise in the EPS.

1250,"Why NIO Stock Is Down TodayIt's not just Tesla, though that's part of it.￼John Rosevear(TMFMarlowe)May 13, 2021 at 2:13PMAuthor BioWhat happenedShares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO (NYSE:NIO) were trading lower on Thursday, after a Wall Street analyst said that the ongoing global shortage of semiconductors will continue to hold NIO's production down for a while longer.As of 1:30 p.m. EDT, NIO's American depositary shares were down about 7.5% from Wednesday's closing price.So whatCitibank analyst Jeff Chung, who recently hosted a call with NIO management, wrote on Thursday that the chip shortage has remained ""the key constraint"" for NIO's production in May. NIO, along with Ford Motor Company, BMW, and Honda Motor, has suffered from the effects of a February fire at Japanese chipmaker Renesas, which has reduced some auto suppliers' access to chips even further for the time being. According to Chung, NIO said that it felt the impact of the Renesas fire peaked in early May, and management now expects supplies to begin to improve in June or July. Chung maintained his previous hold rating on NIO's stock and his earlier price target of $57.60. ￼NIO BUILT ITS 100,000TH VEHICLE IN APRIL, BUT A CHIP SHORTAGE HAS SLOWED ITS PRODUCTION IN MAY. IMAGE SOURCE: NIO.That's probably part of why NIO's stock was down on Thursday. Another factor is almost certainly the ongoing decline of electric-vehicle category leader Tesla, which seems to be pulling down other EV names for the time being. Now whatNot all the news was bad, though. Chung also noted that NIO said market demand has recovered well since the Lunar New Year holiday period in February, and that it's confident that the pace of new orders will continue to increase. While it's always hard to watch a growth stock lose ground in big moves day after day, I think that investors holding NIO can take some comfort from the longer-term story, which remains --",0.9854

The press conference covered the latest outlook on production and shipment. The contents of the press conference are summarized below. Once again, we would like to give our sincerest apologies to neighboring residents, partner companies, relevant authorities and all those involved for the trouble. Overview of the press conference*Timeline for restarting production- As of 9:00 am April 17, 2021, production restarted at the N3 Building. As of April 17, 2021, our production capacity is just under 10% in comparison to the production capacity before the occurrence of the fire. We aim to recover the capacity to 30% by the end of this week, 50% by the end of April and return to 100% by the end of May.*Manufacturing and shipment statusIn regard to shipment of products manufactured in the N3 Building, we will gradually return to the shipment levels before the occurrence of the fire by starting the shipment of work-in-processes which was being produced at the time of the fire. Although this will depend on the product, following the lead time of a typical product, we stated at the March 30 press conference that we expect 100% recovery of product shipment of products manufactured in the N3 Building to customers approximately 100 days after the fire. At this current time, we expect there to be a delay of about 7 to 10 days from the approximately 100 days after the fire for 100% recovery of product shipment. On the other hand, the effect of alternative production is expected to come sooner than initially anticipated, and the amount is larger than expected, contributing to the production.Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/6-notice-regarding-semiconductor-manufacturing-162500878.htmlSuper Long NIO!",0.9945

The university is located in Hefei, Anhui Province, which is also home to NIO China's headquarters and the JAC NIO facility. Under the agreement, NIO will provide resources and a platform to serve as an educational internship base for USTC, which in turn will support the establishment of a postdoctoral workstation at the joint lab.NIO says it hopes to train and deliver globally-oriented high-end talents for the smart electric vehicle industry and is committed to keeping more outstanding young talents in Hefei.",0.9983

1430,"NIO (NYSE: NIO) to Tap Another Monetization Avenue as Ford (NYSE: F) Opens Up Its EVs to the Chinese Company’s Charging InfrastructureBy Rohail SaleemApr 13, 2021 11:06 EDT SHARE TWEET SUBMITNIONIO (NYSE:NIO 38.18 2.80%), one of the leading manufacturers of electric cars in China, appears to be on a roll lately. Coming on the heels of a major partnership with China’s largest network of gasoline stations, NIO has now secured another monetization avenue for its charging network via Ford (NYSE:F 12.165 -1.74%).To wit, while opening the reservations for its Mustang Mach-E in China, Ford has also announced a sweeping partnership with NIO:It’s Official Now: NIO and Sinopec’s Strategic Partnership To Go Live on the 15th of April“Ford will also work closely with charging partners such as the State Grid. Mustang Mach-E users can access over 300,000 high-quality public charging piles, of which 160,000 are fast charging, in more than 340 cities across the country through an exclusive APP. NIO’s nationwide fast-charging network will also be accessible to Mustang Mach-E users.”As stated earlier, NIO is set to formalize its strategic partnership with Sinopec on the 15th of April. The arrangement would facilitate the deployment of second-generation battery swap stations across Sinopec’s vast network of gasoline stations. This, in turn, would allow NIO to lock in a substantial number of existing and future customers to its ecosystem, thereby creating a monopoly of sorts in the largest market for electric vehicles. As a refresher, NIO’s Battery Swap 2.0 stations can perform 312 automated battery swaps per day, with each swap taking place in under 3 minutes. The company plans to build at least 500 such stations across China in 2021.Of course, given the proprietary tech involved in utilizing battery swap stations, Ford is unlikely to tap into this growing network. Nonetheless, NIO does offer its customers a variety of charging solutions. These include a dedicated home charging solution, called the Power Home, and a mobile charging solution, called the Power Mobile, whereby an EV may be charged through a fleet of charging trucks. Moreover, the Power Express is a 24-hour facility available on-demand to NIO customers whereby EVs are picked up, charged, and then dropped off at a pre-chosen spot. Finally, NIO customers can also access China’s network of over 300,000 charging stations.In a bid to make its EVs more affordable, NIO allows users to buy its electric cars while renting batteries under the ambit of its Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS) facility. For a fixed monthly payment – $141 per month for the 70 kWh battery pack – users can slash over $10,000 off the retail price of NIO’s EV models.",0.9962

""It's not decided, but I see it as an interesting opportunity,"" CEO Luca de Meo told the FT. ""We need to find a pragmatic solution, but from a business point of view, there's a point separating the battery from the car."" The French automaker is part of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, which is one of the biggest car manufacturers in the world and a leader in EVs (think the pioneering Leaf and best-selling Zoe). Backdrop: Interestingly enough, Renault was once a trailblazer in battery swapping technology for electric vehicles. Starting in 2010, the carmaker became the primary partner for Better Place, an Israeli startup that hoped to revolutionize the e-mobility industry. The company initially set up shop in Israel, Denmark and Hawaii, but was plagued by financial difficulties and mismanagement, and eventually went bankrupt in 2013. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) also began conducting its own battery swapping trials in 2013, but it dropped the project a few years later as consumers increasingly expressed interest in its Supercharger network. While the process seems simple, making a business out of swapping is a bit complicated. Batteries are the single most expensive component in any EV, but they're still in a rapid stage of development and manufacturers have been reluctant to standardize anything. In fact, at Tesla's Battery Day event last September, the EV maker said it plans to integrate batteries into structural elements of future cars, comparing them to the fuel tanks located within the wings of an airplane. Enter NIO: The Chinese EV maker just recorded a milestone of 2M battery swaps to date and plans to double its Chinese network to more than 500 stations in 2021. Each NIO (NYSE:NIO) battery swap takes only a few minutes (and comes with a full charge), compared to the 35 minutes it takes a Supercharger to load a Tesla battery from 10% to 80% (it's even slower at home). Besides quicker turnaround times, battery swapping technology also allows EV makers to decouple the cost of batteries from their vehicles, meaning drivers aren't worried about depreciating battery capacity or the value of their cars.",0.9938

1538,"(Bloomberg) -- As the semiconductor shortage hobbling the global automotive industry has worsened, its cost as a hit to sales has almost doubled to $110 billion, up from an earlier estimate of $61 billion.That’s the latest assessment of AlixPartners, a global consulting firm closely monitoring the widening crisis. It also now says the world’s carmakers will lose 3.9 million vehicles of production to the chip shortage this year, more than its prediction four months ago of 2.2 million. That’s about 4.6% of the 84.6 million vehicles that AlixPartners had projected in total production for 2021.Automakers issued warnings in earnings reports in recent weeks that the chip shortage would get worse before it gets better. Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. each predicted the second quarter would be the worst of the calamity, as they are forced to idle factories for lack of the essential components. But the industry isn’t likely to see signs of recovery until the end of the year, according to the AlixPartners assessment.“It’s still deeply impacting the third quarter,” Mark Wakefield, head of the firm’s global automotive practice, said in an interview. “We don’t really have it getting into a recovery mode at all until the fourth quarter.”The timing takes on added importance because the chip-related production cuts are driving up prices of new and used vehicles, contributing to higher inflation in the U.S. Another researcher, LMC Automotive, predicts global production will be cut by almost 3 million vehicles in the year’s first half alone.Read More: Record Surge in Used-Car Prices Is Key Culprit in InflationFord Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley said Thursday the company is redesigning its vehicles to use the most common and “accessible” chips. It also is planning to boost semiconductor inventory and sign contracts directly with chipmakers, rather than go through an auto supplier.“We really see the second half improving,” Farley said at Ford’s annual shareholders meeting. “We’re starting to get more confidence in the chip supply.”The crisis that grew out of pandemic-related production cuts has been exacerbated by a fire at semiconductor factory in Japan and this winter’s historic cold snap in Texas that curtailed output.“There are up to 1,400 chips in a typical vehicle today, and that number is only going to increase,” said Dan Hearsch, managing director of AlixPartners’ automotive practice. “The top priority for companies right now is mitigating the best they can the short-term effects of this disruption, which may include everything from renegotiating contracts to managing the expectations of lenders and investors.”Supply ChainAlixPartners, which helped guide GM through bankruptcy more than a decade ago, estimated in January that the chip shortage would cost the auto industry $61 billion in lost revenue. As the crisis has worsened, the firm has begun working with automakers to overhaul supply-chain management to try to avoid this happening again.The first lesson automakers are learning, Wakefield said, is they are no longer “the 800-pound gorilla” in supplier relations, especially with chipmakers who also serve tech giants that pay higher prices for more advanced semiconductors for mobile phones, laptops and video games. Suppliers like that can’t be strong-armed into dancing to Detroit’s tune.Automakers are now in a situation “where they’re eye-to-eye and not the big dog on the street,” Wakefield said. “Reducing costs has been a priority at automakers. It’s great to save money, but not if you can’t build cars.”",0.992

If you haven't figured that out by now you have no business in the stock market. Check out IBD and look at the strong groups.

1755,"The last couple of months have not made me question my commitment to NIO. It has only made me question the integrity of the market, and understand that things don't just keep going up. NIO is going to make me/us so much better off than I/we have ever been, and I am saying the absolute truth. This is coming from more research than I have ever invested in any stock.It is the perfect time for EV's, in the perfect country (China sells more than half of the world's EV's). The Chinese government has mandated/projected 5 million EV's sold/year by 2025, which is a 40% gain per year to reach that level. China bought about 1.2 million EV's last year, and projections are for over 5 million in 2025!!! That is an increase of about 40%, and if you projected NIO's stock price by 40%/ year, you are going to be around $300 by 2026. I actually think NIO will do better than that because they will eat up market share when they start to sell mid-range cars, increase their margins, start to sell their iconic ET7, and achieve their level 4 autonomous driving platform.I have been biting my nails the last couple of months, yet I haven't sold my NIO because I know this is the current GOLD STANDARD in the EV commodity, similar to Amazon in the early 2000's.I have been watching this go down, and all that has been impressed in me is that this is an oil well that is in it's infancy, with most people having no idea how big the well will become. I really believe that this will eventually be in the top 3-4 companies in the world, with the potential to be bigger than Apple!Fun fact! NIO just passed the 2 billion kilometer mark for NIO drivers!! This is data to be used in the development in their autonomous driving platform. Data IS the driving force (please excuse the pun) in autonomous driving!Li Bin has a vision that includes being the best autonomous driving platform. The Holy Grail in the future! NIO has 2 of the top 3 experts in autonomous driving. Research Ren Shaoquing (#1 in the world) and Zhang Jianyong (#3 in the world)! Both work for our NIO! Research who is the MOST cited in the world for autonomous driving! NIO acquired Momenta, an autonomous driving company from Ren Shaoquing, and made Ren a vice president under Li Bin. A quiet MOMENTOUS moment!!Battery swapping in the only country that has given subsidies for battery swapping, and oh, by the way, China chose NIO's battery swapping model as the standard!!I know I am considered a pumper, but it truly comes from the heart and research, and NIO is by far my biggest holding.

We need to find a pragmatic solution, but from a business point of view, there’s a point separating the battery from the car.”De Meo, who opened the three-day FT virtual event where Stellantis chief executive Carlos Tavares and Jaguar Land Rover boss Thierry Bolloré are due to speak on Wednesday, also said Renault was on track to hit its 2022 cost-cutting targets later this year.The battery-swapping technology also allows manufacturers to decouple the cost of batteries from new electric vehicles, preventing drivers from being concerned about depreciating battery capacity or value.While none of the largest carmakers have adopted the technology, there are signs the system could work.Chinese electric vehicle start-up Nio is at present the industry leader, having carried out more than 1m swaps so far since launching its service.The brand plans to double its Chinese network to more than 500 sites in 2021, and also wants to open a swapping station in Norway later this year to spearhead its foray into the European market.""",0.9937

Earnings per share will be $ 0.14; In 2023, revenue will increase 73% to $ 16.6 billion, earnings will increase 6-fold and earnings per share will be $ 0.88. Assuming that the NIO can achieve this goal, its expected rate of return in 2023 will drop to 68 times.AssessmentsI have something to say...Rakesh said that, due to NIO's leadership position in the field of switching power plants in China, this will help it maintain a strong growth momentum. At the exchange station, car owners can charge their electric cars or choose to spend a few minutes to replace the battery. It is important to note that Weilai adopts a separate sales model for cars and electricity, where batteries are sold to customers as a service and battery replacement services are included in battery sales.Rakesh estimates that the cost of setting up a NIO plant will be between $ 450,000 and $ 1.5 million, and will spend $ 300,000 to store batteries. However, as the entire industry implements “standardization” according to government policies, these two costs will fall. Rakesh pointed out that Weilai plans to set up 500 exchange stations by the end of the year. In addition, the company is also cooperating with Sinopec to build up to 5,000 exchange stations in the future. In addition, Weilai will allow owners of Ford Mustang-E electric vehicles to use their charging stations, thereby expanding Weilai's customer base and helping to amortize charging station costs more quickly.",0.9947

This will be the Next Move if the US is to Catch Up to China.""Up to 20% Of Electric Vehicle Owners In California Switched Back to Gas, According To Study""Benzinga EV Insights , Benzinga Staff Writer April 30, 2021 5:41pmWhen thinking about the switch from a gas car to a battery-powered one, the main concern is charging. With a gas car, pumping a full tank of gas can happen in minutes, while charging an electric vehicle can take up to an hour for a full battery. One of the fastest places to charge an EV battery is at a Tesla Inc TSLA 4.79% Supercharger station.A new study published in the journal Nature Energy, covered by Business Insider, shares that nearly 1 in 5 California EV owners switched back to gas after owning an EV.The main reason for switching back was difficulty acquiring a charge for their EVs. Out of the owners that switched back to gas, more than 70% didn't have access to level 2 fast charging at home. This can charge most electric vehicles from empty to full in 6 to 10 hours, depending on the size of the battery and exact charging speed. Nearly 2/3 of EV drivers in the survey said they did not use public chargers. The reason why was not given, but normally it is more expensive and less convenient to charge at these destinations. Also, because EVs take longer to charge, it can be harder to find an open spot. Companies such as Nio Inc - ADRNIO 1.71% are working to make charging faster via battery swap technology. This allows an EV owner to replace the empty battery with a full one in a time that's comparable to filling a tank of gas.Benzinga's Take: Without fast home charging, owning an EV can be difficult. On a standard wall outlet, most EVs will only gain 3-4 miles of range per hour.Unless daily driving is minimal, this will not be enough for most Americans. If a larger wall outlet can be installed, 30-plus miles of range per hour can be gained, which can handle even the longest commutes.But with home renters, apartment owners and others that don't have the option to install faster charging at home, other charging alternatives may be needed.",0.9887

1914,"NIO hired a blockchain and security software engineer in the U.S.Original title: NIO hired a blockchain and security software engineer in the United States. Source:In the past few weeks, the NIO (NYSE: NIO 37,975 0.12%) has skyrocketed in several ways. The company recently started building the huge NeoPark to locate its supply chain. In addition, the company is also preparing to officially enter the European Union on May 6 to establish its business in Norway. In that context, a recent job offer indicates that NIO now plans to delve into the field of cryptocurrency.According to a LinkedIn post, NIO has now hired a blockchain and a security software engineer in San Jose, California. This recruitment event aims to assist the NIO in the design and construction of a blockchain system. While this position is temporary, we believe it is a sign of NIO's deeper involvement in the field of cryptocurrency. The blockchain-based data storage system is inherently very secure, because its state is synchronized with all participating nodes in real time, thus eliminating the possibility of a single node destroying the entire data set.However, we have reason to believe that NIO's blockchain plan is likely to exceed the scope of data security. As we all know, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA 676.21 0.39%) not only owns Bitcoin (BTC), but also accepts cryptocurrency as a payment method for its vehicles. In addition, China will become the first country in the world to introduce a digital currency backed by a central bank. While the digital renminbi is not expected to use blockchain, it does show that China's political community has a new disposition for cryptocurrency-based solutions.Given NIO's well-known desire to establish itself as a lifestyle brand, it may be feasible for the company to seek to supply its NIO cryptocurrency coins in the near future. The company is already offering branded leather bags and clothing as part of its NIO life plan. The NIO currency will allow the company to attract its customers more deeply into its ecosystem, while also increasing its non-vehicle profit margins.In the first quarter of 2021 financial report, NIO's total revenue was $ 1.2183 billion and vehicle revenue was $ 1.1303 billion. This means that the company earned $ 88 million from other sources, including NIO Life. In this context, the launch of the NIO coin will significantly increase the company's lifestyle and non-vehicle profits. We believe that this story will bring many interesting developments in the near future.",0.9971

(NYSE:NIO) could significantly reduce the construction costs of its local battery swap stations if it can take advantage of the subsidies announced by the Chinese city of Chongqing, cnEVpost reported Tuesday.What Happened: Chongqing will provide subsidies of up to RMB 500,000 ($78,000) for each battery swap station built and put into operation in the city, according to the report that cited a document released by the city’s finance bureau.Builders are eligible to apply for subsidies if the annual cumulative number of battery swap stations built and put into service by them in Chongqing reach at least 15, as per the report. However, cnEVpost added it is not sure if Nio is eligible for the subsidy.The individual cost of Nio’s second-generation battery swap station is reportedly RMB 1.5 million ($236,850), half the cost of the company’s first-generation product. Nio’s battery swap station construction costs will be significantly reduced if it can take advantage of the Chongqing city subsidy, the report noted.Nio built its first second-generation battery swap station in the city on May 9.",-0.6453

Revenues are expected to jump over 400% year-over-year to $1.02 billion.On the earnings call, the company is likely to shed more details on new products and services, and chip availability. The company was forced to shutter its plant for a few days in late March and early April due to chip supply shortages. Nio's April deliveries update is due in early May. This number could be of particular interest to investors due to the five-day factory shutdown that began March 29.Rumors abound that Nio may announce its European expansion plan May 7 or 8. As the EV maker prepares for its maiden overseas foray, investors may be keen to find out more details regarding the timeline, targets, localization of production, distribution and pricing.Confirmation from the company regarding a potential secondary listing in Hong Kong is also seen as a positive for the stock.

Photo: ReutersChinese electric-vehicle (EV) start-ups NIO Inc and Xpeng are best placed to rival industry leader Tesla for global market share because of their competitive technological advantages and strong shareholder support, according to JPMorgan Asset Management. Never mind that they may take years to earn their first dollars.“They have three key competitive advantages, [namely] significant production expertise, strong software integration skills such as Advanced Driver Assistance System, and strong backing,” said Oliver Cox, Hong Kong-based money manager at JPMorgan Asset Management. He cited Tencent Holdings and Meituan as their powerful financial backers.The two US-listed EV start-ups are setting the pace in the mainland China market, which is set to dominate the global EV industry in the coming years amid a bullish outlook painted by auto analysts. Under the “Made in China 2025” industrial plan, 20 per cent of new cars will be new-energy vehicles (NEVs), which encompasses pure electric, plug-in hybrid and fuel cell cars.The view should come as a warning for Tesla, which has stumbled on several regulatory hiccups and a quality backlash. The Shanghai Auto Show also suggests Chinese EV makers are gunning for its scalp, with Geely Auto unveiling its Zeeker 001 model, and Volkwagen its ID.6 along with a slew of mini EVs.Competition for market share is heating up as more than 500 players have entered the fray with the industry on the cusp of a major growth spurt, including new entrants like smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. China recorded a 12 per cent jump in NEV sales to 1.17 million units in 2020 and sales almost doubled last quarter. UBS forecasts electric car sales will reach 6.6 million in 2025 and 18 million by 2030.Cox co-manages the US$1.22 billion Pacific Technology Fund, which has risen 89.4 per cent over the past year, according to Bloomberg data. The fund added NIO and Xpeng some time between September 2020 and February this year, according to reports to fund holders, amounting to a combined 2.9 per cent of its net assets.NEWKNOWLEDGEWho's leading China's electric car market?Get the full pictureShares of Beijing-based NIO and Guangzhou-based Xpeng have risen by 1,168 per cent and 122 per cent respectively over the past 12 months.

With the latest funding, Innovusion has raised more than $100 million.Lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors use laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around the car. They are seen as essential by many automakers for higher levels of driver assistance, right up to making cars capable of self-driving.Nio unveiled the ET7 earlier this year.It is one of two models the EV maker plans to sell in Norway, where government tax breaks and subsidies have made the country a global leader in per capita EV sales.Innovusion Chief Executive Junwei Bao said its Lidar sensors would be offered as standard on the ET7, with the latest funding helping to scale up production and provide financing to some suppliers.""The supply chain needs a boost because Lidar is a new animal, so we'll use some of the funding to support them,"" he said.Innovusion's sensors can spot some objects at a range of up to 500 meters (1640 ft) and can register all but the darkest objects at a range of 250 meters.Junwei Bao said Innovusion's sensors were being evaluated for deployment by other carmakers.Other Lidar makers like Ouster Inc and Luminar Technologies Inc have gone public via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs).",0.9742

FILE PHOTO: The logo of car manufacturer Tesla is seen at a branch office in Bern, Switzerland October 28, 2020. REUTERS/Arnd WiegmannSHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has halted plans to buy land to expand its Shanghai plant and make it a global export hub, people familiar with the matter said, due to uncertainty created by U.S.-China tensions.With 25% tariffs on imported Chinese electric vehicles imposed on top of existing levies under former U.S. President Donald Trump still in place, Tesla now intends to limit the proportion of China output in its global production, two of the four people said.Tesla had earlier considered expanding exports of its China-made entry-level Model 3 to more markets, including the United States, sources told Reuters, a plan that had not previously been reported.Tesla currently ships China-made Model 3s to Europe, where it is building a factory in Germany.Shares of Tesla fell as much #$%$3% early on Thursday.Tesla sold 25,845 China-made vehicles in China and overseas in April, down from 35,478 in March, according to data from China Passenger Car Association.Tesla's Shanghai factory is designed to make up to 500,000 cars per year, and has the capacity to produce Model 3 and Model Y vehicles at a rate of 450,000 total units per year.In March, Tesla refrained from bidding on a plot of land across the road from the plant as it no longer aimed to boost China production capacity significantly, at least for now, three of the people said, declining to be named as the discussions were private.In a statement to Reuters, Tesla said its Shanghai factory was ""developing as planned.""The Shanghai city government, a key supporter in Tesla's establishment of a wholly owned factory in China - the first and only foreign passenger car plant not required to form a joint venture - did not respond to a request for comment.Tesla had never declared an intention to acquire the land, which is about half the size of the 200-acre (80 hectare) plot housing Tesla's current facility and would enable the company to lift capacity by another 200,000 to 300,000 cars, said two of the people.Tesla's China sales are surging despite mounting regulatory pressure in the country after consumer disputes over product safety and scrutiny over how it handles data.It generated $3 billion in revenue in China in the first three months of this year, more than tripling year-earlier sales and accounting for 30% of total revenue.LAND PLANSLed by mercurial Chief Executive Elon Musk, Tesla is known for shifting gears on strategy, including in China.Construction documents posted on a government website in March show Tesla is revamping its plant in Shanghai to add capacity.Tesla still has land, designed for production but now used for parking, at its Shanghai site. One of the people said Tesla could expand its capacity beyond 500,000 on its existing site. Another said Tesla may acquire more land for more car production lines in the future.Separately, Tesla is building facilities to repair and reproduce key components such as electric motors and battery cells and build EV chargers at its Shanghai plant.The Shanghai government has been talking to several companies to sell the land for new-energy commercial vehicle production, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.Tesla faces intensifying competition in China with domestic players such as Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc, which is considering making mass market products under another marque.Even before the trade war tariffs, relatively few China-made cars were shipped to the United States.",0.9943

2260,"The Chip Shortage Could Be on Its Way Out. Here's Where Things Stand. -- Barrons, 11:20 A shortage of semiconductors is delaying automotive production by millions of units around the globe, costing auto makers billions in profits -- just as demand is surging after the Covid-19 pandemic. But recent commentary from car and chip makers suggests that there might be a light at the end of the tunnel for the industry and for automotive investors.Investors have heard plenty about the current state of capacity problems for months. Roughly 2 million cars -- or about 10% of quarterly global automotive production -- weren't built in the first quarter because of no chips. Ford Motor(F) , one of the auto makers feeling the shortage most acutely, said in late April that it expects to lose about 50% of planned second-quarter production.It has been much harder for automotive investors to get a sense of when these supply chains issues actually will improve. But Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO (NIO) and chip maker Semiconductor Manufacturing International (0981.Hong Kong) are now offering some signs of hope for the industry.Last week, NIO management sat down with Citigroup analyst Jeff Chung. The analyst says NIO expects the situation to ease in the June-July time frame. That's a brighter outlook from late April, when the EV maker said on its first-quarter earnings conference call that the chip shortage was getting more severe.That means investors should be hearing better news on second-quarter conference calls. Chung rates NIO shares Hold and has a $57.60 price target for shares.Semiconductor Manufacturing International's first-quarter conference call held May 13 offered another ray of hope, saying that supply constraints will last ""until the end of the year."" While that means there are months left of supply constraints, it also means an end is indeed coming.This is good news for high-growth EV stocks such as NIO, which is down about 30% year to date. Higher interest rates and more EV competition in China have played a role in the decline of EV stocks, but the chip shortage has constrained exactly what investors want to see: growth.Shares of traditional auto makers such as Ford Motor(F) and General Motors(GM) are up year to date, mainly because auto sales are recovering from pandemic-induced lows. Still GM and Ford stocks are down over the past month as concern over the chip shortage and its impact on profits has crept in. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are essentially flat over the same period.Improvement in the chip situation has the potential to remove one overhang from the auto sector. Investors are anxious to see the situation improve. After all, demand for cars is strong right now, and car companies need to strike while the iron is hot.",0.9973

2354,"EV's in many cases are already cheaper than ICE cars. These studies that point to 202727 as the year that EV's become competitive with ICE cars is a ridiculous study. It isn't just the initial cost that should be compared but rather the overall cost for the time period of your vehicle. Take NIO's entry into Norway. First, the vehicles NIO is selling in Norway are comparable to S class Mercedes. A 450 S class in Norway costs 90K. What does an ES8 cost? Now let's look at the S class fuel bill. With gasoline at $7/gallon in Norway and 20 mpg with that Mercedes, let's drive the two a bit. With the 100 kwh battery, the NIO can get 300 miles between charges and kwh rates in Norway are 10.4 c per kwh, so a full charge would cost $10.40. Now, let's look at the Mercedes 450S averaging 20 MPG. With 300 miles of driving, that Mercedes requires 15 gallons of gas. At $7/gallon in Norway, that totals $105 in gas to go the same distance a NIO ES8 will go on $10.50 cents worth of electricity. That is a $94.50 savings in the NIO every 300 miles. That means in 30000 miles of driving, the NIO saves another $9450 dollars in cost savings, and the NIO was a cheaper purchase in the first place, has a longer warranty and way less maintenance . You don't have to wait until 2027. Imagine the ET7 with the 150 kwh battery allowing 580 miles between charges costing only $15.60 to charge. You do the math. Right now, in America, gasoline averages $3/gallon where average kwh rates are about 13.5c/kwh so a hundred kwh battery can be charged for $13.50 in America, take you between 300-400 miles. How many gallons of $3/gallon gas in your 25 mpg car will it take? Well...for 300 miles, you would use 12 gallons of gas in a 25mpg car x $3/gallon =$36 of gas vs $13.50 worth of electricity. Looks like ICE cars cost about 3x as much per mile or more at least. People buying ICE cars now are just asking to hold obsolete money suckers in the future.",0.9471

2359,"In the stock market what happen in the past means little if you are tanking in the present. A good example would be anyone who bought into the hype of the Chinese EV car sector at the end of last year. Those that bought before the big run started made out good even if they were not smart enough to sell some or all before the 50% crash. Now you have for months seen pumpers posting all their blue sky and new models and NIO day and all the reasons NIO would get back to its old high. How has that worked out?They don't mention ever since there has been a stock market there are groups that got way ahead of themselves and in time got cut back to where they should be priced. That is what happen to the Chinese EV stocks. You can throw most all of the EV battery stocks in there too. Call them Tulips.Those who got sucked into the hype are now down big time. They would have been much better of YTD in GM or F. Both of those companies actually make their own cars unlike NIO. Those companies actually make money so they do not have to dilute the current shareholders. Both are going big into EV cars.History shows it is not easy to make money in the auto business. Just too much competition. By the time NIO ever gets up to making a decent amount of cars not only will F and GM pass them in cars built, but so will BMW Mercedes and Volkswagen.I would actually put money into Volkswagen before any of the Chinese EV companies.Before you buy the OLD HYPE, you better look at it from all angles. NIO has crashed 50% and has lost all momentum. All Chinese EV stocks are out of favor now. Just think if you buy NIO then they do yet another dilution what will happen to the stock. Remember this trustworthy management team told you once before they didn't need any more money and diluted for the third time less than a month after telling that to the shareholders.Can NIO go up form here? Yes of course it can. Does it look to anytime soon. Look at how it has acted you you determine that. I think it is dead money.

Additionally, NIO would be able to lock in a substantial number of existing and future customers to its ecosystem, thereby creating a monopoly of sorts in the largest market for electric vehicles.As a refresher, NIO’s Battery Swap 2.0 stations can perform 312 automated battery swaps per day, with each swap taking place in under 3 minutes. The company is able to achieve this feat by eliminating the lift step required by the first-generation stations. These stations will begin to be deployed from April 2021, with NIO planning to build at least 500 Battery Swap 2.0 stations in China by the end of the current year.On the fundamental front, things are also brightening up for NIO. As an illustration, the company reported this month that it delivered 20,060 EVs in the first quarter of 2021, translating to annual growth of 423 percent. The company continues to ramp up the production capacity at the JAC-NIO facility. By the end of 2021, its annual production capacity is expected to cross 300,000 units.

We focus on long-term investments with an emphasis on big caps, tech, healthcare, and dividend stocksSummaryNIO just finalized an agreement with Sinopec to build 5,000 battery swap stations.NIO has remarkable management with experience in the auto industry.NIO is differentiating its product much like Apple did in the past.Leading the RacePhoto by mevans/E+ via Getty ImagesThesis summaryIn my latest article on NIO Inc. (NIO), I reached a target price of at least, $80 using a DCF model. I also mentioned there are some key areas, which are hard to quantify, that make NIO a compelling investment. Today I expand on these ideas, focusing on BaaS, NIO’s CEO, and the company’s overall marketing approach. These ideas are hard to put into numbers, but, in my opinion, prove that NIO has a bright future.BaaS: Stronger Than EverNIO and Chinese state-owned oil and gas giant Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company Limited (SHI) announced on Thursday the signing of a strategic partnership to build battery swap stations. Both companies posted news of their agreement on their Twitter feeds while sharing images of the unveiling of their new battery swap station 2.0 at Chaoying station in Beijing, which has now begun operating. It is the first second-generation battery swap station for the Chinese EV manufacturer, and its 201st overall, since the first was inaugurated in 2018.EVs May Have Short Ranges, But NIO Stock Has A Lot Further To GoNIO: Remaining Bullish After Strong March DeliveriesNIO Stock: Should You Buy The DipAlthough the details and scale of the deal with NIO are not clear yet, Sinopec has stated that they aim to have 5,000 battery swap stations in their network by 2025, as they aim to transition to a higher presence in electricity and non-oil business. On NIO's side, the company’s goal, which it has described as conservative, is to have 500 battery swap stations by the end of 2021.This is the largest so far, but not the only partnership of NIO’s in this space. A few weeks ago, NIO reached an agreement with another state-owned infrastructure company, Beijing Shoufa, to build stations in the Beijing area. NIO president Qin Lihong said on Thursday that they are aiming to add nearly 100 more third-party partners this year.The idea of battery swap stations is that consumers can drive into the station with an uncharged battery and have it automatically replaced by a fully charged one in just a few minutes. The 2.0 version of these allows drivers to complete the battery swap without leaving their car and can perform up to 312 swaps per day.A mass rollout of these stations is a key part of NIO’s BaaS strategy (battery as a service). With this model, customers do not purchase the battery with the car and own it, but rather pay a subscription fee to “rent” charged batteries and replace them as they become uncharged. By not including the battery, the initial purchase price of the vehicle is reduced by up to almost 20,000 USD. As more and more swap stations are deployed, the convenience gap between electric and petrol-fuelled vehicles could gradually disappear.NIO is not alone in the battery swapping business, nor did it invent it. Israeli start-up Better Place tried to develop the concept in collaboration with Renault (OTC:RNSDF) in 2007 without much success. Today, a handful of companies around the globe are trying to deploy such systems, like Blue Park Smart Energy, a competitor in China with government influence, or American start-up Ample, which has begun operating several such stations in California, catering for fleet vehicles.Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) started with the idea of battery swapping in 2013 but abandoned the program in 2016 in favour of its superchargers. At the time, it may have appeared like the right strategy given the limited amount of EV’s on the road. Superchargers are much more efficient than regular ones, achieving a range of up to 200 miles in 15 minutes, and they are smaller and much easier to deploy than battery swap stations. This has allowed Tesla to provide over 20,000 superchargers to its customers around the world. However, with EV presence increasing fast, the economies of scale may cause a shift in which is the most efficient of the two solutions.It remains to be seen what will happen with regards to the standardization of these battery swaps, as for now, customers can only swap batteries at their manufacturer’s station.Though not the creator of the technology, NIO appears to be moving fastest towards dominating what could be the future of EV refueling, and it could be shaping up a",0.9972

Although Nio’s deliveries fell by -2% month over month to 7,102 vehicles in April 2021, with sequential growth for May also likely to be limited, Nio recently indicated that the chip situation could get better around June or July. This means that delivery growth should pick up over the second half of the year, likely improving sentiment around the stock. Nio’s valuation also looks much more attractive, with the stock trading at just over 10x 2021 revenue – not unreasonable for a company that is projected to more than double sales this year and grow sales by another 60% in 2022, per consensus estimates. Longer-term growth could also hold up as Nio is expanding its geographic footprint, indicating that it would begin delivering vehicles in Norway from the fall of 2021. Moreover, we think Nio should hold its own in the Chinese EV space, despite mounting competition, given its wider product range versus rivals (Nio currently sells the EC6, ES6, ES8 vehicles), unique innovations such as battery swapping, and also due to its positioning as a lifestyle brand, with an emphasis on quality customer service.",0.9846

But with that, the price of the new batteries could be higher. Zeng said sodium-ion batteries are likely to be more expensive than lithium-ion batteries because they are a new concept.Last year, CATL built the 21C Innovation Lab in Ningde, Fujian province, with an investment of RMB 3.3 billion to focus on research and development of next-generation batteries, including lithium metal batteries, all-solid-state batteries, and sodium-ion batteries.The sodium-ion battery that Zeng says will be released soon could be from this lab. NIO's battery supplier CATL says it will release sodium-ion batteries around July-CnEVPost(Source: CATL)Sodium-ion batteries work mainly by moving sodium ions between positive and negative electrodes, similar to lithium-ion batteries.But because the electrode material used in sodium-ion batteries is mainly sodium, it is more abundant and cheaper than lithium.When lithium batteries are prevalent, a problem that cannot be avoided is also a growing concern - China's lithium resources are highly dependent on imports.Globally, the distribution of lithium resources is extremely uneven, with about 70% distributed in South America.",0.9886

2621,"Why NIO Stock Is Up TodayTesla lost a lot of ground in China in April, and that gave NIO an opportunity. What happenedShares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO (NYSE:NIO) were moving higher on Friday, after data showed that it beat Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on one key sales metric in China in April. As of 11 a.m. EDT today, NIO's American depositary shares were up about 6.9% from Thursday's closing price.So whatNIO was the best-selling brand in China's fast-growing all-electric SUV market in April, according to new data from the China Automotive Technology and Research Center. While Tesla's Model Y was the best-selling electric SUV in China in April, with 5,520 units sold, NIO's three electric SUV models sold a combined 7,404, enough for a 23% share of the market.A red NIO ES6, an upscale mid-sized electric SUV. WHILE NO SINGLE NIO OUTSOLD TESLA'S MODEL Y IN APRIL, COMBINED SALES OF THE SIMILARLY SIZED ES6 (SHOWN) AND CLOSELY RELATED EC6 WERE 5,786, TOPPING THE MODEL Y'S 5,520. IMAGE SOURCE: NIO.Of course, that data comes with an asterisk (or at least an excuse): The Model Y production line at Tesla's Shanghai factory was reportedly shut down for about two weeks in April, so supplies might have been tight.That said, demand might also have been a factor. Tesla's China sales fell by about 67% in April from March, as CEO Elon Musk's feud with the Chinese government in the wake of a series of accidents and protests sent many potential buyers to other brands. Now whatAuto investors who are inclined to dismiss the Tesla data should note that while Tesla managed to move 25,845 Shanghai-built vehicles in April, more than half of those (14,714) were exported. Clearly, the level of Chinese demand for Teslas is in question right now. That's bad news for the Silicon Valley carmaker's ambitious growth plans, but it seems to be giving NIO a nice opportunity to gain market share.",0.9797

2709,"Motley Fool has released another positive news on 3 HYPERGROWTH STOCKS and NIO is one of them. Below is the snippet: “NIO: Implied upside of 53%A third hypergrowth stock that Wall Street professionals believe could soar over the next year is China-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer NIO (NYSE:NIO). Following the company's recent swoon, the Street is forecasting upside of as much as 53%.The ""Why NIO?"" question is pretty simple to answer: EVs are the future of the auto industry, and China is the largest auto market in the world. By 2035, the Society of Automotive Engineers of China has predicted that half of all auto sales will be new-energy vehicles, with roughly 95% of those being EVs. The Chinese EV market is ripe for the picking, which should allow NIO to secure a piece of a really large pie.NIO has been successfully ramping up its production, as well. After delivering a little over 20,500 EVs in all of 2019, the company increased deliveries to 43,728 in 2020. If not for chip shortages, which are hampering the entire automotive industry at the moment, NIO would probably be delivering 9,000 to 10,000 vehicles a month at the moment. Even with the chip issues, NIO's revenue is expected to more than double its sales to $5.2 billion this year.The company also deserves serious credit for its battery-as-a-service (BaaS) operating model, which should be a long-term operating margin and loyalty driver. Buyers who sign up for the program can receive replacement or upgraded batteries in the future. In turn, they pay a monthly fee to NIO and receive an upfront discount on their vehicle. NIO is effectively trading away some near-term margin for considerably higher BaaS margins and loyalty over the long run.Then again, a $59 billion valuation for a company that's delivered 95,701 vehicles since its inception seems a bit excessive. Although it's done well with its early stage ramp up and has laid to bed any funding concerns, next-big-thing technologies like EVs won't be without hiccups. Between increasing competition and a steep learning curve, a wait-and-see approach might be prudent, even with Wall Street's aggressive price target.”Go NIO.",0.9959

The process for the development of the standard, released by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) on May 10, shows that it began pre-study in November 2018, drafting in February 2020, and soliciting public comments in March 2020.",-0.1118

The association confirmed Wednesday that a wholesale figure of 25,845 published the day before combined local sales and exports. It was the first time it broke down the sales that way.Some analysts have questioned whether there would be enough demand in China to absorb most of the Shanghai's factory's planned output of 500,000 vehicles a year. While a portion of the company's Chinese production could be earmarked for export, the bulk of buyers would likely need to come from China -- the world's largest auto market -- for the factory to be sustainable. Demand from the rest of Asia is relatively weak and Tesla is planning new production plants in Europe and the U.S., its other main markets.By separating out export numbers in April, however, it is clear that Tesla might not have the commanding lead over rival EV makers in China that the wholesale data previously implied.In some cases, analysts have mistakenly assumed the wholesale figures reflect Tesla's sales in China.",0.9758

(NIO) earlier this month on April 6 and wrote that, ""We have been successful so far avoiding the long side of NIO. Prices have held the $35 area twice in March, so that is the level for the bulls to defend. A break of this support zone could open the way to declines in the $25 area, according to the Point and Figure chart.""Prices have held $35 three times and that is the chart. In this daily bar chart of NIO, below, we can see that prices have successfully held the $35 area the past two months. Prices are turning upward and are currently testing the declining 50-day moving average line. The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows the beginning of new firmness and tells me that buyers of NIO have become more aggressive.

Every single one I had conviction and have profited in hundreds to thousands of percentages with each. $XPEV is no different for me. The market momentum in the past month or so is driven by unfounded fear...this week's knee jerk selling due to already known inflation is disproportionate to the concern. EV stocks have gained popularity from last year as many new investors had fomo. That money moved to new viral crypto gambles this year as institutions pulled strings to make profits from all of their own losses from those viral plays they missed out on. So they have been driving the prices down in the EV sector for months to cheapen the price, knowing full well the adoption of EVs in China is going to be absolutely tremendous. In the next few weeks, you'll see filings by many hedge funds that have picked up millions of shares of XPEV and NIO. Every MM knows 5-10x upside to both of these stocks, as they both had great earnings this quarter with plenty of cash on hand, higher deliveries every month, and increased revenue. The entire market moved in sync today to bring down the prices as overblown fear was the catalyst, but the VIX sunk more than everything. People have liquidated from crypto and that money is going to also enter the stock market after learning how a couple of viral tweets doesn't just fly you to the moon, but can also bring you crashing down even quicker. Tech stocks have been overly punished in general. XPEV specifically had even indicated today they had already taken steps to allocate parts to minimize any disruption to production. Recent delivery numbers prove that XPEV is achieving that goal. EV stocks will come back very strong and these prices are a gift for all those that have been looking for a long entry.

2842,"After Selling Nio Stake In Q4, Hillhouse Capital Buys Shares Of EV Stock In Q15/18/21, 10:43 AMMay 18, 2021 11:43 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- NewsNio, Inc. (NYSE:NIO) shares were sought after by institutional investors in the first quarter in an apparent bid to capitalize on a pullback in the electric vehicle stock. What Happened: Asia-focused private equity firm Hillhouse Capital bought 127,000 shares of Nio in the first quarter, a 13F filing by the firm revealed. Hillhouse's stake in Nio at the end of the quarter was valued at $4.958 million.Incidentally, the private equity firm sold off its position in Nio in the fourth quarter.In the third quarter of 2020, the firm held 2.412 million shares of Nio, valued at $51.18 million.Hillhouse also bought 658,595 shares of Nio's Chinese EV peer XPeng Inc (NYSE:XPEV) in the first quarter. The stake was valued at $24.05 million. The firm had no position in XPeng in the fourth quarter.Related Link: Germany Could Be Nio's Next Stop After Norway Foray, Reports SayWhy It's Important: Nio and XPeng are two prominent players in the growing Chinese EV market. These companies have capitalized on the momentum with product lineups, particularly with respect to technology and customer service.Both Nio and XPeng are planning overseas expansion. XPeng has already started exporting its vehicles to Norway, while Nio recently announced its entry into Norway by setting up an office and service infrastructure in the European country.Nio and XPeng are likely to benefit from the acceleration that is expected in EV adoption. If these companies can match their vision with execution, in all likelihood, their shares could emerge as attractive investment options.",0.996

2857,"In order to be bullish on NIO. You must be bullish on China. And seeing how the U.S only now focuses on infrastructure investments that China did years ago shows me the U.S is lagging.

Along with NIO global branding will succeed, but it doesn't need to in order for NIO to become profitable in less than 2 years.EV and new energy are methods of generating wealth that the EU and China have shifted towards years ago. Only now the U.S has finally decided to put a large investment into this market. The problem is that China is leading in patents for new technology than the U.S by multiple folds. The infrastructure bill you see now with the Democrats is good imo. You don't have to agree with how the money to supplement it is arranged or with it at all. But it's here, and it will happen.China already started this decades ago and the blueprints have been shown in Xi Jinpings 2025,2035, goals. So china has the head start that the U.S does not. Thus allowing China to capitalize on these untapped markets unlike the U.S. China will not make the same mistakes other rivaling superpower powers during there time because China learned. China has already done what the U.S is planning to do now decades ago. This is why instead of defaulting to gasoline, they opted in for EV and new energy infrastructures that scale along with new markets. So I am very bullish on China. If this does not succeed, then China fails. So far, it seems as if China is winning.",0.9972

Although I am a believer that the tech sector, including EV, will have a rebound later this year which may even surpass their highs previously, I am nibbling again in the EV sector, as I feel it will have the most growth in the future. In the meantime and for some time now, I have invested in utilities both in funds as well as individual utility stocks, especially in states like TX as well as MO and others such as SO, Nextera, NRG, AES and a few others, as these will benefit in a large way with every new EV sold, as folks who buy the EV's will be paying higher utility bills to charge their vehicle (still at much lower cost than gasoline costs), and these utility companies have basically very long term companies and guaranteed profit. I personally feel any buy of NIO below $38 will be looked on as a genius buy within a year. What it does right now, is kind of meaningless, as it is being sold off due to the rampant gambling and margin calls both to individuals and to hedge funds. It has zero to do with the value of the company. This is a lesson in the market for many as they are learning that you should only invest in the market with monies you do NOT need in the near future, but the market is full of short termers who borrowed and are now in desperate straits selling everything to stay afloat. It seems like folks would learn, but those that bought higher, and they did so with long term horizon and no need for that money right now, IMO, you are just fine and will see blue skies again. I would be more worried about the 0 and 1 gamblers on crypto.

The site's auction failed several months ago when there was only one bidder, the report said.Tesla signed a memorandum of cooperation with Lingang in July 2018, announcing the construction of its largest overseas factory outside the United States, the Shanghai Gigafactory, with a planned capacity of 500,000 units. On Jan. 7, 2019, Tesla officially opened the Shanghai Gigafactory with a first phase capacity of 250,000 units. The plant is mainly used for the production of Model 3 and Model Y.On January 7, 2020, Tesla delivered the Model 3 produced at the Shanghai plant to 10 Chinese consumers for the first time and launched the production of Model Y.According to Tencent News, Tesla was previously required to invest RMB 14.08 billion over five years and achieve an output of more than RMB 75 billion by the end of 2023 and generate RMB 2.23 billion in annual tax revenue.Otherwise, Tesla would have to hand over the land but would receive corresponding financial compensation regarding land rental, buildings, and equipment.On April 28, Tesla made an announcement that it had repaid the $614 million loan related to the Shanghai factory expenses early and the related contract was terminated. After this, the unused $758 million under the fixed asset credit line in Tesla's debt and finance lease schedule will no longer be available.A Reuters report on Tuesday mentioned that people familiar with the matter said Tesla has stopped buying land to expand its Shanghai plant due to uncertainty over tensions between the US and China.",0.8683

Mutual understanding, mutual support and precise previews are contributing to NIO's smooth operation and its local partners' fight against the epidemic,"" Zhang continued.NIO announced last year that it would enter the European market in the second half of this year.

The reasons seemly are still under investigation, but looks like that it will be in relation to brake lost control. More importantly, seemly Chinese government by this chance is taking more and more strict monitoring upon Tesla cars as the cars like mobile scanner which can take lots of road/building information within China. Some rumors even indicates that special military building/ high level government area are not allowed for the entry of Tesla cars from this year. 2. To further improve the local NV industry to compete Tesla(and other similar companies around the world), Chinese government on 20 May 2021 released a draft order for the improvement of the power charging and exchange station structure, which seemly is a big advantage technology of NIO. NIO is on the wind in China in my view. 3. In addition, lots of technology companies are rushing into EV industry (like Huawei/Baidu/Alibaba) to battle in EV industry. 4.

People that are researching Chinese stocks consider that as a great benefit any time they are considering investing in China. There are other political considerations as well, and some of them are negative. Do your DD in this regard, but NIO is registered in the Cayman Islands, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and has a Chinese subsidiary of the American accountant firm Pricewaterhouse, Coopers to do their accounting! Still, sh-tuff can happen, so that is a consideration (Taiwan?).I'm looking out 5 years, and these things I know:The Chinese government LOVES NIO! The Golden Goose of the future! The iconic car company that they have never had!! They have made many accommodations that appear to assist NIO, and other Chinese EV companies, as well as all EV companies.. Many of these policies are in an effort to transition from ICE (internal combustion engines) vehicles to zero emission vehicles because they have the worst air on the planet (Beijing). As a result, they have been paying government subsidies for EV's. -Then, the government decided to give subsidies for vehicles costing over $42 thousand dollars-ish only if you had battery swapping, which felt like they were targeting NIO specifically as they were the only one selling an EV over that price point with battery swapping!! As a result, Tesla had to cut their prices under that price point to ensure they could still get the subsidy for their lower level Model 3. Tough on their margins to cut 3-4 thousand off of their prices! NIO has never cut their prices!-In order to buy an ICE vehicle in China, you have to win a lottery, which is about a 1 in 100 chance. -If you win the lottery to buy an ICE vehicle in China, you then have to purchase a license that costs $13-14 thousand dollars JUST FOR THE PRIVILEGE TO BUY AN ICE vehicle! Licenses for EV's are FREE, and given out to everyone who wants to buy an EV!-Once you buy an ICE vehicle, then many of the major highways have limitations to drive your new ICE car. Major highways only allow you to drive ICE cars on odd/even days, depending upon the last number on your license plate. May 1st, 3rd, and 5th, etc... you can drive only if you have an odd number as your last number on your plate. The same for even numbered days, which makes me think, ""Why would anyone in China buy an ICE vehicle??"" They say China will sell over 5 million EV's/year by 2025, but my brain asks ""Why would anyone buy an ICE vehicle with all of these hurdles to cross??"" 25 million cars bought/year, and I bet they will buy more than that at a faster rate than projected!I am a pumper (NIO is my biggest holding), but only telling the truth!

3272,"NIO in April 2021: Fresh sales record, new major partnershipEqualOceanMay 13, 2021The company saw several competitive products of premium EV sedans at the Shanghai Auto Show.NIO in April 2021: Fresh sales record, new major partnership-CnEVPostChina's NEV sales penetration rate rose to 11.4% in March.NIO's share in China's NEV market reached 3.4%.Notwithstanding, the Chinese premium EV market is entering a 'no apple to fall' situation.NIO is now building EV infrastructure with Sinopec.This collaboration could strengthen the company's advantages on infrastructure, costs and services, attracting more customers.Amidst the coronavirus pandemic last year, the global economy was severely compromised. However, China's economic recovery is moving now at a lightning speed that overshadows other nations.Passenger vehicle and EV sales locally carried the leading positions in March 2021, presenting surges of 80% and 352%, respectively.In the same month, monthly EV sales first reached 11.3% of total car deliveries in the country. The rocketing EV sales mirror the overall strong consumption recovery. NIO in April 2021: Fresh sales record, new major partnership-CnEVPostNIO broke its monthly record, delivering 7,257 vehicles in March. Meanwhile, NIO's EV market share was down to 3.4% mainly due to the booming sales of Wuling Mini, a product of SAIC Motor, Liuzhou Wuling Motors and General Motors' joint venture.In 1Q, NIO delivered 20,060 units, meeting the sales expectation of between 20,000 and 20,500 vehicles.On the other hand, the company's founder and CEO William Li claimed that due to the chip and battery shortage, the monthly production will remain at less than 7,500 units in the following months. He nevertheless believes that the supply chain issue will be eased in 3Q 2021.Chinese EV market: no apple to fallNotwithstanding NIO's strong delivery results, as mentioned in our last report, the EV market is expected to see more intense competition as different manufacturers are going to release new models in 2021.In April, a few brands launched similar products to NIO – and demonstrated them at the Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition. It is not hard to tell that these brands are entering the premium EV market and eager to occupy a share. Below is a crop of the new vehicle models with competitive functions. NIO in April 2021: Fresh sales record, new major partnership-CnEVPostOther than the brands portrayed above, Baidu said that for every month in the rest of 2021, it is expected to have a new EV model equipped with self-driving solutions based on the Apollo platform.Luckily for NIO, some of these models won't be sold within a year due to the production timeline and will not impact its sales too much in 2021.Collaboration with SinopecLeaving aside market dynamics and competition, NIO's new form of cooperation with Sinopec is also worth mentioning. Even though some of the EV maker's previous strategic collaborations are not important, this new project definitely stands out.On April 15, the founder William Li and other major management figures at NIO and Sinopec announced that they have released the second generation swap station in a Sinopec gas station in Beijing.Based on their agreement, NIO will deploy many of its planned swap stations at Sinopec's sites. We think this initiative will create synergy effects for NIO in two ways.Siting: Most of NIO's current swap stations are geographically located in non-core urban areas, due to the difficulty in site selection (probably it's hard for NIO to find open-air places to build stations in the city center). By using Sinopec's sites, the construction of swap stations can solve the problem.Brand marketing: another significant benefit of building a swap station in Sinopec's gas station is to achieve accurate marketing. Hypothetically, every driver will be exposed to NIO's swap station when they are filling up their cars at some Sinopec's gas stations.This is highly harmonic with NIO's broad strategy, whereby promotion is one of the important purposes of developing a swap station network. ConclusionWith the economy bouncing back, China's automotive industry is recovering first, along with increased demand for both combustion engines and EV motors. The competitive landscape is becoming more intensified.NIO, in turn, is actively reinforcing its business through infrastructure-related collaborations.This article was first published by Niko Yang on EqualOcean, an investment research firm focusing on China.",0.9978

Power station, the 158th overcharge station. Its completion is not only a powerful supplement to Changsha's power exchange resources, but also marks the full opening of the second generation of Weilai power exchange stations in Hunan. The overcharging station is equipped with a total of 12 overcharging piles for all electric car owners to use, charging free parking for 2 hours, charging fee: 0.85 yuan / kWh ~ 1.3 yuan / kWh. Weilai Power Station Exchange｜Hunan’s first second-generation station is located at Red Star Macalline Shaoshan Store. Located in the parking lot of Red Star International Convention and Exhibition Center, Shaoshan South Road, Changsha City, Hunan Province, it is strategically located, close to the Agricultural Expo Center and only two minutes away from the South Bus Station. The transportation is convenient, the provincial government section, the red star business district, and the Desiqin business district. It will effectively serve users in Desiqin, the provincial government and the South Railway Station area. On the day of the event, Wei Lai’s founder, chairman and CEO Li Bin @William李斌 also came to the scene. He said: We will speed up the power replacement layout. At the same time, we welcome everyone to recommend the energy layout site, and thank the Hunan users for their support to Weilai. At the opening ceremony, the head of Hunan regional company Yan Jie@严杰JACK thanked everyone for coming to attend our opening ceremony in the rain. At the same time, Jie also shared the energy layout plan of Hunan region, the main urban area of Changsha. There are swap stations for 5-8 kilometers, and most prefecture-level cities have swap stations put into operation. The interchangeable high-speed service areas between major cities can be used for power replacement. At the event site, Wu Yibin, Chairman of Daxiangwei Che Youhui@大湘蔚车友会 shared with us some stories and experiences of being an investor in the supercharging station, and welcome everyone to work together to create an energy layout. At the opening event, users jointly cut the ribbon for the unveiling of the first second-generation power station swap in Hunan, and witnessed this beautiful moment together. NIO's second-generation swap station is the world's first mass-produced swap station that realizes automatic parking of vehicles. It is a software-defined intelligent power swap system combined with end-cloud. A total of 239 sensors and 4 cloud systems are deployed in the whole station of the second-generation NIO power station to work together to comprehensively deepen the application of visual recognition technology. Different from the first-generation power station, the new second-generation power station has undergone a comprehensive upgrade. The number of batteries in a single station has reached 13, and it is equipped with 100-degree batteries. The replacement station will also use the PSAP automatic parking technology to realize one-key automatic parking into the replacement platform. The user does not need to get off the car, and the battery can be exchanged with one key operation. Car owners will get a smarter and more convenient battery swapping experience, and they can start off after a full battery in the time of a song. Up to now, NIO has deployed 218 power stations nationwide, 159 overcharge stations totaling 1,188 overcharge stations, 339 destination charging stations, and more than 380,000 third-party charging stations have been connected. There have been 9 replacement power stations, 6 overcharging stations, and 6 destination charging stations in the Hunan area, with 1502 third-party charging piles connected to them. We will also continue to work hard and continue to deploy the charging and swapping network so that 5-8 kilometers of the main urban area of Changsha can be used by swap stations, making it more convenient to power up than to refuel!

Source: CnEVPost)Chinese electric vehicle company NIO officially announced Thursday that it will enter Norway, its first stop to test the overseas market. Before the launch, William Li, founder, chairman and CEO of NIO, said in an exchange with media that the company expects to enter five European countries next year.Li did not disclose which five countries. When asked if NIO will enter France, he said that NIO will eventually go to France, but the countries where NIO's products will enter in the future will be announced in new launch events.NIO will enter more markets, but will advance step by step and do long-term planning, Li said. At the end of last year, NIO started to build a Norwegian team and formally formed NIO Norway in March, Li said, adding that NIO's entry into the global market was planned, but last year's Covid-19 and some of NIO's own events caused the progress to be a bit later than expected.NIO's entry into Norway was more than a year later than originally planned, and now it's time, so NIO has been speeding up the matter since the second half of last year, Li said.According to Li, it is more difficult for NIO to develop the European market than the Chinese market, and Chinese brands generally face more difficulties in their internationalization efforts compared to previous years.Although globalization is currently facing challenges, NIO has a simple idea that good products and services will be recognized globally, Li said.NIO's overall globalization strategy is well-prepared, and the company has planned for the long term while remaining patient and not holding out for a one-hit wonder, according to Li.Overall, NIO's entry into overseas markets will certainly be challenging, but not as much as one might expect, Li believes. NIO's vehicles have been designed with overseas markets in mind, and some details and software will be adjusted to suit local conditions, according to Li.NIO is already thinking five years down the road, and entering the global market requires even more of a long-term perspective, he said.As for why Europe was chosen as NIO's first stop in overseas markets, Li said he had learned that many fans in Japan and South Korea wanted NIO to enter the regions, but the company had no team there before, and the team previously established in Europe and the United States made it easier to enter those markets.NIO will not build smaller cars specifically for Europe, and in the future NIO may build smaller models in China and will consider entering local markets at that time, he mentioned.",0.9911

Li believes this is not a sprint race, but a long run, and NIO is confident of long-term competition.Earlier today Li said at the auto show launch that the manufacturing and testing of ET7 are in full swing.To date, NIO has 203 battery swap stations, 144 supercharging stations, and nearly 1,100 supercharging piles in China.In addition, NIO has more than 1,800 destination charging piles and access to more than 380,000 third-party fast charging piles.",0.9928

Also, next millionaire maker is:ACRX - May 21, 2021:- It appears the COVID backlog of elective surgeries is starting to move and the company reported that April was the “best commercial month since the launch of DSUVIA.” What is more, is seeing movement on the delayed formulary reviews and now has 432 approvals for DSUVIA.- First and foremost, the company has made significant progress on the payer front and expects to hit their year-end target of 615 formulary approvals.- Zimmer Biomet (NYSE:ZBH) has committed roughly 70 commercial team members to push DSUVIA in the oral and dental surgery space. Recently, AcelRx was informed by the American Dental Association about a billing code that can be used for DSUVIA, which should help with implementation.- The company reported the fastest-growing users of DSUVIA in the plastic surgery specialty, followed by orthopedics. This is most likely due to the massive backlog of elective surgeries from COVID-19 that are starting to be addressed.- In addition, the company is seeing strong interest from the oral and dental surgery arena, as well as eye surgeries, ENT, and palliative care, who could benefit from DSUVIA’s ease of use.- Perhaps the biggest opportunity for DSUVIA is penetrating the hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers. DSUVIA has some clinical data published recently that validated its potential in these arenas and should help sway some P&T committees to consider employing DSUVIA into some treatment paradigms. The data showed that DSUVIA expressively reduced the total volume of opioids administered that led to faster discharge times.- In fact, when comparing DSUVIA to patients receiving standard IV opioids, patients dosed with DSUVIA prior to extubation required 50% fewer opioids in the PACU with 36% of them being opioid-free versus 8% in IV opioids. It is this level of data that could help AcelRx and DSUVIA disrupt the well-entrenched IV opioids in the hospital and ambulatory surgery center setting.- Another update to note is that the company’s contract manufacturer has taken control of the automated packaging line, which is being installed in their U.S. facilities. AcelRx expects to have the initial commercial batches being produced in the third quarter of 2022. AcelRx believes this move will considerably decrease the company’s cost of DSUVIA sales.- The company also reiterated their commitment to expanding DSUVIA’s footprint and expects to have an out-licensing transaction completed for DSUVIA in the near term. A commercial partnership should come with a substantial upfront payment, commercial milestones, and royalties.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4430374-acelrx-pharmaceuticals-moving-closer-to-an-attractive-risk-reward",0.9976

Four more spaces will come in 2022 in Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim, and Kristiansand, as the after-sales service network goes nationwide, the group said.""From its founding, NIO's vision is to be a global brand with high-quality products and services to the users worldwide,"" said William Li, NIO's founder, chair, and chief executive. ""Norway is a sustainable and innovative country and resonates with our vision.""Also: Tesla Has Been Losing Market Share in Europe. That May Change Dramatically.The company said that it will establish a ""full-fledged ecosystem"" in Norway, going beyond vehicles and servicing to include a lifestyle brand and community app. The group will also invest in charging infrastructure, with plans for four battery-swap stations in Norway connecting five major cities by the end of 2022.The first model to be available in Norway will be the ES8, NIO's electric sport-utility vehicle, with the ET7, a premium electric sedan, to come in 2022. NIO will compete for the attention of Norwegian drivers with its Chinese rival XPeng, which delivered more than 100 vehicles to the Scandinavian country in December 2020, with more coming in 2021.Norway is an EV-obsessed country in an EV-obsessed region.There were more electric vehicles sold in Europe than in any other part of the world in 2020, with 1.33 million electric-vehicle registrations in 18 key European markets last year, according to automotive analyst Matthias Schmidt. Those 18 markets include 14 major European Union states plus the U.K., Norway, Iceland, and Switzerland.Plus: Forget NIO and XPeng. This company and Tesla will be the top two electric-vehicle plays by 2025, says UBS.The EV explosion in Europe came amid a pedal-to-the-metal push to increase the adoption of cleaner transport from European governments, including offering generous incentives to consumers, which supercharged demand. However, China, which is home to a strong domestic electric-vehicle sector, reclaimed its crown as the world's largest EV market in the early months of 2021.But EV adoption has penetrated far deeper in Norway than in any other part of Europe. Battery-electric vehicles were nearly 53% of the mix of Norway's national auto market by the end of the first quarter of 2021, with plug-in, hybrid-electric vehicles at more than 29%, according to Schmidt, who publishes the European Electric Car Report.NIO will face tough competition in a red-hot European market.
