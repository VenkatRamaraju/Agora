7,"Wabtec is a key player and leader in the rail industry worldwide. I understand the GE integration has created major challenges, but I also believe the GE products give Wabtec more competitive advantages than they had prior to the merger. Still researching the company, but I like the idea of buying industry leaders when they're dealing with short term challenges. That's where I see Wabtec today. Not buying yet, but definitely under consideration in the low $60's. Once the GE integration is wrapped, wouldn't mind seeing WAB bring GBX into the fold as well. There isn't any replacement for rail, so the long term looks great in my opinion.",0.9863

18,"Wabtec(WAB) was excited to announce this that it had completed its merger with GE Transportation, immediately following GE Transportation’s spinoff from GE(GE). GE shareholders will see small amounts of Wabtec in their portfolios. The final ratio is a bit lower than what had been estimated. For each share of GE stock owned, shareholders received 0.005371 shares of Wabtec stock, approximately one share of Wabtec stock for every 186 shares of GE stock. Many small shareholders will receive cash in lieu of shares. Shareholders should be aware that this spinoff is taxable. People should ask their tax advisor what this means, but our understanding is that the full amount of the distribution is taxable, but it also reduces the basis on their GE shares by the value received.

85,"We are reaching a 3 year low for WAB with a top range of 113 and nominal price from the high 70’s to low 80’s. This is prior to the GE acquisition. Pressure on the stock is due to a second round of negotiations with the union and some risk as GE may need proceeds from WAB stock to continue operations. On 6/3 a strike may occur if agreements with the Union are not made. The drop in stock price reflects this event and once the trade deal is set I would expect a 2-3% rise in share price. WAB last quarter was strong, but its too early to tell how long it will take WAB to gain efficiencies of the combined companies. GE transportation was a customer of WAB and there are saving to be expected and redundancies to shave cost. Long term and at these levels WAB is a good buy. Technology in Rail have lagged other areas of transportation such as autonomy but eventually this will have to change and WAB is the leader in train control with products like PTC.",0.9842

206,"I agree 100% regarding top management's pay being very high. I only hope it's tied to performance. If it is then I'm fine with that.I do have a concern regarding strikes. When I left the service and had no job my brother talked me into his job with a roofing company. It was a union shop, paying dues.I never had to work getting dirty but I did. A job is a job while living with my spouse's parents. I had a union card for roofing and sheet metal. In my town the Ford plant, a container plant and GE was on strike. As i went to work daily the workers would be getting warm next to a 55 gallon container keeping warm for over 16 months without pay.The container company closed, then the Ford plant next and finally the GE plant. All due to workers demanding a pay raise during a recession. It was bad timing on their part. Then came our company demanding higher hourly wages. I was happy just to have a damn job to pay my bills. No, I decided along with my brother, to continue working during our strike. I don't regret for a minute crossing lines to keep the company, with it's obligations to complete projects, on time. My dad was a loyal union electrical member all his life. He could work side jobs due to his expertise while on strike.My bottom line is, you have to choose what is right for your families well being. You can stand with your signs and burn wood when it's cold in that 55 gallon metal container. But in the end the company closes shop or moves to another location.The roofing company I worked for, after 75 years of business, folded. End of story",0.8861
