In any organization.What are you complaining about?These people gave their best years, energy and talent, while taking a huge risk to their name and livelihood.now,When the company can pay (yes also from the investors' money) they are worthy of reward. Before everyone else.The fact that we have now, recently, invested several thousand dollars in the stock, does not give us the right, at least in my opinion, to complain about their compensation policy.I feel like my investment is being managed by the best of the best on the planet.All that is left is to wait patiently, support and make a profit.

123,"From Motley Fool today. Good reading. Famed stock picker Peter Lynch offered investors this wisdom: Buy what you know, research what you plan to buy, and adopt a long-term mindset. That's great advice. When you buy a stock, you buy a portion of the underlying business. It doesn't make sense to buy a business you don't understand -- that's basically gambling.In my experience, one of the easiest ways to learn about a business is to research how its products are used in real-world scenarios. For instance, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) both provide some pretty complicated technology, but it's easier to grasp when you consider how these companies have aided the fight against COVID-19. Here's what investors should know.NVIDIA: SupercomputingNVIDIA provides graphics processing units (GPUs) and high-performance networking solutions designed to make data centers faster. The company also provides pre-trained AI models and frameworks across a range of industries, allowing developers and researchers to build intelligent applications.NVIDIA headquarters building facade.IMAGE SOURCE: NVIDIAFor instance, NVIDIA Clara is designed for healthcare, using artificial intelligence to improve drug discovery, medical imaging, and genomic analysis, and to create smart hospitals.Using NVIDIA Clara, a research team from the University of California at San Diego won a Gordon Bell Prize for their research on COVID-19. Specifically, they blended AI and high-performance computing to create the clearest picture to date of the coronavirus. NVIDIA GPUs made it possible to pack twice as much data into the image as any prior simulation in molecular dynamics. One researcher called the visualization ""critical for vaccine design,"" for both COVID-19 and future pathogens.Additionally, NVIDIA assisted the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in building AI models to improve tracking, testing, and treatment of COVID-19. Specifically, the models were trained on data from high-infection-rate locations, enabling them to accurately diagnose coronavirus cases from lung scans.More recently, the Argonne National Laboratory announced that researchers would be using 24 NVIDIA DGX A100 systems -- supercomputers designed for artificial intelligence -- to accelerate the discovery of COVID-19 drug therapies.Of course, these examples illustrate how NVIDIA can dramatically impact healthcare, supercharging research efforts and medical imaging. But on a higher level, they demonstrate NVIDIA's critical role in addressing computationally complex problems. That value extends beyond medicine into areas like smart retail, manufacturing, robotics and autonomous vehicles, and virtual reality and graphics -- as well as other scientific domains like space exploration.Palantir: Data analyticsPalantir specializes in big data analytics. The company's software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms help clients manage, integrate, and draw insights from massive data sets. As a result, Palantir has played an important role in helping government and healthcare agencies combat the coronavirus.Imagine trying to coordinate the delivery of medical supplies and personal protective equipment -- face masks, gloves, gowns, and hand sanitizer -- across thousands of healthcare institutions, each with rapidly changing levels of supply and demand. That's the type of problem Palantir's software was designed to solve.Person viewing a map of interconnected data points.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGESMedical suppliers use the Palantir Foundry platform to monitor global supply chains, allowing them to identify potential shortages and work proactively to prevent problems. Similarly, public health agencies use Palantir to track the spread of the virus, assess the effectiveness of response strategies, and collaborate with hospitals and suppliers.In the U.K., Palantir has helped the National Health Service (NHS) coordinate its vaccine effort. Facing a logistics nightmare, the NHS selected Foundry to simplify ordering, allocation, tracking, and delivery of over 29 million doses of COVID vaccine.Palantir has also played an important role in the U.S. vaccine effort. Its platform has powered the integration of data from government agencies, drug manufacturers, and distributors, then referenced that data against demographic, employment, and public health information, allowing officials to allocate vaccine doses efficiently and effectively.In fact, during Palantir's most recent earnings call, Global Head of Business Development Keven Kawasaki noted that the company helped the U.K. and U.S. run ""two of the most successful vaccination programs in the world.""In general, these examples highlight Palantir's ability to improve healthcare by enabling data-driven decision-making. But that value proposition is applicable to virtually every industry, and it should help Palantir grow its business in the coming years.",0.9998

For purposes of estimating the TAM in the commercial and government sectors, we exclude institutions in countries or regions where we have chosen not to sell our software.CommercialOur estimate of the TAM in the commercial sector is $56 billion.This estimate is arrived at by multiplying the number of potential customers around the world — defined broadly as approximately 6,000 companies with more than $500 million in annual revenue — by an assumed annual contract value for each potential commercial customer based on organization size and our internal data of existing customer spending.We developed further support for this estimate by analyzing third-party industry estimates of projected spending in the software categories we believe our platforms address. Over the years, we have expanded our platforms into new product categories, increasing their potential value across our existing and potential customer base. Our market opportunity has increased as a result. Our software platforms address a broad range of requirements within organizations, including data management, integration and orchestration, application development, security, system and service management, analytics and artificial intelligence, supply chain management, enterprise resource management, and content and workflow management. We estimate, based on data from International Data Corporation, that global spending in the subset of these software categories that we believe our platforms address will be approximately $158 billion in 2020.",0.9871

This is a perfect analogy for what they are doing by giving away the Foundry software for free. As a “”GIFT”” then...attack. Not literally attack like the real event but more of an approach to get in the door of these companies they want to be associated with. Palantir knows that their software is good and by (gifting) it they put it into the hands of their costumers.. if the product speaks for itself as highly as they speak of the product then the companies that got the product become dependent on the product, and that’s when they are tied up. Netflix gives you a month for free when you join. They get you through the door and then they charge you. Same goes for APPLE Music, HBO, Disney+, appleTV+ and millions of other subscription based companies... I think it’s brilliant. Now there’s a rotation in stocks and companies that are dependent on the pandemic to be valuable. Like ZOOM and PELOTON.... however those companies just lowered their guidance because of the re-opening of every day life. Their financials are giving up this data, and Palantir wants in my opinion to ride that wave of re opening. Now that companies are spending money to reopen in a post pandemic ecosystem they want to do it efficiently and if Palantir delivers they will become dependent on PLTR and that is very very good",0.9948

You know when you have an empty water bottle and you squeeze the bottle while turning the plastic to create air pressure at the tip? Well the same thing is happening to PLTR. Once there’s enough pressure in the bottle and you turn the tip it makes a bang sound and the cap flies off.... that is what is happening to PLTR.

420,"A few thoughts regarding Barrons recent hit piece on PLTR. The thing that's important to keep in mind is that Eric J. Savits and/or the author of the article/subterfuge on Palantir is paid by Barrons which arguably has ties to the investment firms noted in the article. Likewise, Savits, Barrons, and an analyst's job isn't to be the umpire of the financial world whereby their purpose is to help protect the little retail investor from the big bad wolves of wall street; rather, their job and/or purpose is to render opinions that invoke either fear or greed in the masses. In turn, Savitz, Barrons, the analysts, and the firms they all work for are hoping to profit off of your emotions. I know, I know, I know, it may not seem right; however, it is how the game is played. So, take what the author of the article and his analyst buddies say with a grain of salt then buy more Palantir. https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-stock-slides-amid-growth-concerns-51620834965?siteid=yhoof2",0.9758

NO, PLTR has added several new customers more than we know about. They say the option traders are more advanced into seeing what a stock is going to do and if you look into the options. There is more than a 2 - 1 calls then puts, showing the price will increase next week. And there has been a large amount of institutions buying in over the last couple of weeks. Why would they buy into PLTR now? Think about it. Blink Charging gets awarded a contract to install charging stations in one city in Texas a couple of months ago and the stock moves up $3.00 - $4.00 in the day. PLTR has been receiving several contracts for 10s of Millions and nothing. People are scared to buy there stock because the writers are writing nothing besides negative information.

Some providers have handed data printed on paper in 40 garbage bags upon exit, because the client didn't specify the format in the contract.

Finally, their products and the market for each matured, their steady efforts to produce top and bottom-line growth paid off, and they were rewarded by Wall Street.

Looks like it is Palantir's ""arena""...Biden's cybersecurity order means new boon for enterprise cloud stocks - WedbushMay 13, 2021 7:10 PM ETTelos Corporation (TLS)By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor56 CommentsPresident Biden has signed an executive order to bolster U.S. cybersecurity after the ransomware attack at Colonial Pipeline - and that's giving Wedbush's Dan Ives another chance to tout potential beneficiaries in the enterprise software sector.The move could mark an inflection point for the group, he says; ""Clearly the federal government has reached a tipping point around beefing up its cyber security protection in a strategic move long overdue. This move will have a crossover impact into the private sector as well and ultimately benefit the pure-play cyber security vendors in our opinion with new standards now in place.""The pipeline attack follows fairly closely on the SolarWinds hack, marking two major, ""brazen"" nation-state attacks on core infrastructure in six months.And Ives says he's ""befuddled"" by the lack of core next-gen security infrastructure in place around utilities and other key federal assets.The shift to the cloud has left even more data and endpoints potentially exposed, and attacks are increasing at an ""eye-popping"" rate, he says - a broader sector growth catalyst for the next 12-18 months.And it's a belief that the Biden Administration is likely to catalyze more federal spending that ""benefits Beltway players such as Telos (NASDAQ:TLS) and Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) in particular.""",0.993

706,"I’m not one to make posts... but I’ve been in the marketplace for over 20 years. A little background about me... around 1996 I was fortunate enough to become a venture capitalist for the first time with a fiber optic company. I turned $100,000 into $10,000,000:) YES.. extremely lucky, and once in a lifetime opportunity-so to speak. Over the years I’ve invested in the health sector, internet, biotechnology, etc... all Pre-IPO... I invested in Facebook at $45 a share before it went public, and the unthinkable happened! It dropped to about $17:( I thought the world was coming to an end! However, approximately 10 years later, it’s now over $300 a share:) the lessons I’ve learned are extremely valuable when it comes to the stock market! The worst thing you can ever do, is PANIC! Now, with that said, I would like to share my thoughts:)Palantir is such an underrated stock, and SO cheap at these levels, that I KNOW that the stock is being incredibly manipulated right now!! If anyone really knew the true capabilities of what Palantir can do, the stock would have a zero at what it’s trading today and be where it should be amongst the other tech giants in the marketplace! Trust me when I say: the hedge funds, and other institutions are loading up on this stock at these levels, but they know they won’t be able to get it here for much longer!! I know it, they know it, and now all of u know it!! Palantir has been in business for about 20 years now!!! It hasn’t even scratched the surface when it comes to their potential! If everyone who owned it, held it, what do you think the price would be for those who want to buy it??? The math is simple!!!! Like I learned from the one past example, those who bought at $17, are now boasting $300! I don’t believe it will take Palantir long at all to hit triple digits, because they’re business model and products are like no one else out there!",0.9972

Please humor me while I tell you the story of being heavily invested in retail stocks during the majority of the Trump administration, stocks such as Williams Sonoma, American Eagle, Signet Jewelry and a host of others to include fashion houses Capri, Tapestry and Ralph Lauren. The retailers languished as did the designers, supposedly because Amazon was going to take over the world, that was the common theme for nearly three years, no one could compete. So going into December 2019, retailers were at very low P/E's most in the single digits even during the traditionally strong Christmas season, it just appeared that things would never change, yet they did in 2020, Covid and it got much worse, I saw Signet go to five dollars a share, I saw Williams Sonoma go to 25 dollars a share and American Eagle made it to 8 if I recall correctly, Tapestry to 12. I held, didn't see anything else that wasn't already pumped to invest in. Now due to reopening narratives, Signet, a company that couldn't break 35 for years (after divesting of their financing arm and seeing a huge loss in revenue and profits due to it) now all of a sudden is breaking 68 dollars a share, a price double what it was before Covid and three percent unemployment. American Eagle is three times higher than it was pre-Covid, Williams Sonoma is at all time highs and also nearly three times higher than pre-Covid. What has changed? The political environment, unemployment double what it was, an economy that is now a wounded bird nothing else. Yet for some reason retailers now are considered the hot stocks gathering P/Es that tech stocks couldn't imagine now.",0.9746

Tiny debt, ton of cash, new clients, massive growth of revenue... the company could be profitable now if they chose short-term goal instead of long-term one. But they will not sacrifice great future, because few short-term investors want their money now. Alex Karp said that well, if you want short-term profit, you can go somewhere else. This company's strategy is not make tiny profit today, but to reinvest and make huge profit tomorrow. Their potential runway is very long and there are huge tailwinds. So hold or sell, but don't bash here all day. And those management options? If you have great product, if you are years ahead of the competition, and if you want to keep this trend in future, you must pay your engineers to keep them work for you and motivate them and to reward them for good work. Palantir is 17 or 18 years old company so they have good working product, but if they want to expand to comercial sector and take a big piece of that cake, they must in some ways act as a startup (reinvesting ton of cash, big options etc).

The goal is to make a profit, but there are bumps in the road. To me, it means believing and understanding the company's activities, monitoring performance, identifying and listening to reliable and professional people, load at opportunity prices and being mentally strong along the way i.e. patient. This is what I do with gains or losses. In the message board here, I identify investors doing so. At the same time, there are young investors, who on red days are stressed and leave the stock. This is due to a lack of understanding / belief in the company, investment in the company as a result of rumors of quick profit and mainly a lack of mental strength.

Obviously, this post is for long-term holders.I thank everyone else in advance for not answering.Everyone is expecting a big rise in the stock ahead of the first quarter reports for 2021.I'm not sure that is indeed what will happen! I will try to explain.The indicators that I will diagnose the company are:Revenue-These are long-term contracts, and the question is what will the company choose to refer for the reporting quarter?What can we learn about the future revenue vector from sustainable agreements?Revenue distribution-I expect an increase in the commercial sector.I will also try to understand the source of income (Licenses, manpower, cloud storage agreement with Amazon, how much of the revenue came from IBM sales people?).Expenses -Critical to understanding the direction of the company.If this item increases, it can significantly reduce profit or lead to loss.It is therefore necessary to understand the distribution of expenses.In other words: Did the agreements we heard about (and many others we did not hear about) lead to accelerated employee hiring? Did they receive shares / options in accordance with the company's policy?Investments -We have heard about investments in various fields. What is their impact? Is a revenue vector expected from them? How much was referring in the quarter?In summary, profit and / or revenue can be good even if they are less than expectations. The most important thing is to examine the essence of the numbers. Deep inside.Hope I did not disappoint you in this opinion.Correct me if I'm wrong.English is not my first language and therefore apologizes in advance for syntax errors.Amir",0.9834

A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Monday, shares of Palantir Technologies Inc (Symbol: PLTR) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.6, after changing hands as low as $18.18 per share.

2015,"Credit Esther for the topic. Posting to get some other view points:At first blush the identified TAM by Palantir of $119 Billion is still massive and provide ample runway for HUGE pltr returns considering current penetration.Then I read Zero to One and many Thiel Talks podcasts and he referenced what Google did early on to prevent the monopoly target on their back. It was eye opening and made me think “is palantir doing the same”. My immediate answer was “yes”. Reason being is that the $119 B market was specific to Govt and Commercial Enterprises who have $500 million in revenue or more“Our estimate of the TAM in the commercial sector is $56 billion. This estimate is arrived at by multiplying the number of potential customers around the world — defined broadly as approximately 6,000 companies with more than $500 million in annual revenue”- What I felt was this was vastly underestimated because we know darn well that a modular approach is now an option and procuring via AWS is also an option. That brings into play customers who generate revenues of $100 million to $500 million and the number of those institutions vastly outnumbers those with $500 million or above. Lastly - Mr. Sankar COO validated this for me with his comments in last earnings call of feeling the “commercial defense sector market” was now open to them and it’s $200 billion in annual spend.The market opportunity has been dramatically under played. These guys know what they’re doing. It’s investors who don’t know how to research and connect dots who can’t put these things together. Several of us on this board have.Long and strong",0.9932

As the company raises money before it comes public, those options increase in value. When company goes public and options vest, Karp then has to exercise those options and buy the shares outright. But if Karp does not have millions of cash somewhere to exercise the options then his only option is to exercise and sell the shares. And if he does that he would also own taxes on gains on the shares he decides to sell because he doesn't have the money for the outright options exercise. So he is forced to just liquidate just to cover both taxes and exercise his shares. That usually results in liquidating the shares from the excercised options.",0.9778

2855,"My fellow PLTR homies,1. Last night, I decided to watch a few YouTube videos about Palantir2. I listened to an interview with Mr. Karp3. Mr. Karp is REALLY MAD at Silicon Valley4. For some reason, he has a LOT of HATRED in his heart for Silicon Valley entrepreneurs5. This ""Political Disagreement with the Valley"" is his main reason for moving Palantir headquarters from Silicon Valley to Denver, Colorado6. Basically, he wants to work and profit from multi Billion dollars contracts with the government and military who love to use Palantir Services, however, Silicon Valley doesn't like the government being ""Big Brother"" to control the American people and their freedom.7. My impression of Mr. Karp is that he doesn't want to be politically correct or socially ""responsible"", and that's why he moved Palantir headquarters to Denver, Colorado.8. The big obstacle for Palantir is that the stock owners (meaning US the American public) are expecting him to make money, show more profits, and sign up more CIVILIAN and PRIVATE COMPANIES... instead of just military and government contracts9. So, it seems that Palantir might face Social Obstacles trying to sign up private contracts with companies such as Walmart, Kroger, Amazon, Facebook, etc... because of the push back by the American people... 10.

2885,"First, I am a long, but tired of listening to know nothings on this board so I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS PROBABLY GOING ON INSIDE PLTR BECAUSE I LIVED THROUGH IT... back in 2001 I worked at a start up. We had lots of options, we went public. The stock was at $70, 3 months later the stock was at $12, still the exercised options at higher prices created a huge financial burden due to the AMT tax. When the lockdown expired, people were selling stocks at $12 bucks in order to cover the tax on $70 of exercised stocks that they had bought with penny options and held. It was a HUGE issue in silicon valley during the dotcom implosion as employees that held to their exercise stock were in the hole with the IRS for tax bills that sometimes where 10, 20 times the value of the stocked they owned. So even liquidation wasn't a solution to their problem. I have no proof, but I suspect something similar is happening at PLTR. Some options probably were expiring, they exercised at higher price, they held, now their bosses are selling, the stock is getting hammered, they are looking at huge tax bills and they are having to liquidate at basement prices. I will tell you from personal experience, IT AIN'T A HAPPY PLACE TO BE WORKING IN. This will not just affect stock price, it will affect the work culture.

We’re thinking about it and we’ve even discussed it internally. If you take a look at our balance sheet there’s $2.3 billion in cash at quarter-end including $151 million in cash flow in Q1. So it’s definitely on the table from a treasury perspective as well as other investments as we look across our business and beyond.”Glazer went on to note that “in terms of accepting bitcoin from our customers, we do accept it as a form of payment.

3151,"To the rookies here who keep saying ""omg insiders are selling, stock is garbage""... Please educate yourself. I have worked for a tech start up and issued RSO = restricted stock options. When these RSO's become vested, they become taxable by the IRS. A lot of these people don't want to use there own bank accounts to pay a large sum of taxes, so they sell the shares needed to pay the taxes. This happens with EVERY single tech that goes public. Look at FB, in 2012, Zuckerberg sold 2b in stock. The majority of that was to cover taxes from stock becoming vested. 2nd, an insider just can't sell tomorrow, they are held to different rules by the SEC to prevent fraud. They issue they want to sell XYZ shares, a date is chosen at random and it sells that day. It is usually 3-4 months out, when I went to sell, they chose a date 4 months away that it will sell. If the stock is down, the person can't just cancel the sale and say never mind, it is 100% sold. Like I said, some of are selling for some profit, most are selling to cover taxes. If you saw insiders liquidating 100% of positions, that is alarming, most are selling 5-10% of the position which tells me 100% it is just for taxes. No different than the company I worked for back in 2012, and no different than FB. Go look at Peloton insider sales after they went public, same thing, insiders selling. When you get your salary, you pay taxes on it. When they get there vested stock, that is like a ""bonus"" and they pay taxes on it. Stop freaking out about insiders selling, it has nothing to do with the company. The company is 2 for 2 on earnings, they beat EPS and Revenue back to back and raised guidance to a 30% yoy growth for 5 years.Why is the stock down? The stock is down because they are issuing TO many shares to the employees. So wallstreet and retail did not like seeing Karp get 1.1b in a pay package. Keep in mind, this pay package is paid over 12 years. He gets 2.5% vested stock each quarter, and guess what, he will pay taxes on those 2.5% of shares every quarter so I expect him to probably sell stocks every quarter for that reason.Once they stop issuing so many shares to the staff, you will see profits and the stock can rise. Karp told CNBC, this is mandatory for the time being to retain top talent and eventually this will level off like other tech companies. The key thing is, how long will this last because as long as this last for another 1-2 years, expect us to sit anywhere from 15 - 25 range if they still stay this large of compensation.",0.9956

Meanwhile the ceo has become a billionaire with all his free awarding shares which he then proceeds to dump in the market. Am I wrong. Look up ceo total pay last yr including his dumping of 100s of mill of free shares. Luv the products but the way the ceo awards himself and insiders 100s of millions of shares each and every yr makes me think twice about investing in this. Its like the ceo is using the company as his own little piggy bank. Am I wrong. Ceo has become a billionaire while 0 profits in 19 yrs. look up ceo total pay last yr including his dumping of 100s if millions of shares. Have a puke bucket ready when you see it. Meanwhile the pps has cratered from 45 to 20. Please explain how and why im wrong as I would luv to load up again as i did at 11 but sold at 20 before all profits were gone. Again explain to me where im wrong as I would luv to buy again but the whole self awarded free shares in the 100s of millions which they then proceed to dump makes me wary. Would luv to be proven wrong but the way the ceo set it up with all the free awarding shares in the 100s of millions which they then proceed to dump each and every time gives me a bad feeling about this again look at ceo total compensation last yr including his dumping of of 100s of millions of free awarding shares.

3439,"Motley Fool article on why Palantir is a buy:“I've been cautiously watching Palantir from the sidelines since its IPO, and I missed the big jump last year when shares went from sub-$10 to briefly over $40. Since then, the stock has been reduced to a much more modest valuation and the price is down some 40% from its peak. And after seeing the Q4 update -- the first for Palantir as a public company -- I'm ready to start (still very cautiously) dipping a toe in the water. My caution stems from the well-documented fact that the bulk of Palantir's business is derived from government contracts. There's also a lot of new stock being doled out as employee compensation that could throttle growth of a stake in the company. But Palantir expects its sales to grow an average of 30% a year through 2025 as data analytics demand picks up steam. Palantir has also made changes to speed up the rollout of its software for commercial companies, and it's posted some early successes on this front. Plus, Palantir is highly profitable (on an adjusted basis that backs out non-cash items like employee stock-based compensation, operating profit margin was 32% in Q4). The company also has loads of cash: $2.01 billion at the end of 2020, offset by debt of only $198 million. For a high-growth software technologist in a fast-growing industry, that kind of liquidity paired with a profitable operation is powerful. Granted, even after the recent taming of the stock price, Palantir trades for 32 times expected 2021 revenue (assuming the company grows sales by ""only"" 30%, although management said to expect ""30% or more"" growth). It's still a costly price tag, but not terribly unreasonable if the company does in fact deliver on its five-year plan. Thus, I'm ready to start nibbling a little here.“",0.9934

The pop to 30 was irrational unfortunately. Or the love of the stock to the likes or kathi wood could just propel this company but that’s a paper tissue narrative. It’s a tough call. What it her motive for buying. Will earnings be positive in a year ? A billion with of deals won’t be signed.

As time goes by, we will get to a point where we have some balance where these 1000 trucks are fully loaded with PLTR stock6. Just like me, these 1000 trucks don't want to unload until the time is right7. Now, the 1000 truckers (including myself) will wait... and wait... and wait... until buyers are willing to pay $30 per share...8. At that points, I become a little greedy and I start to gently unload my truck by selling 10% of my PLTR holdings and wait....9. Is this a good strategy to load and unload the PLTR truck?10. Is this how Cathie Wood loads and unloads her PLTR truck?Peace!",0.8888

3566,"First of I am a long investor in PLTR. What happened today was typical of big money selling off and locking in profits to drive the price down and clear out short term investors then buy the shares back at a better price. Look at the low volume today. I expect tomorrow to be high Volume and would be surprised if we are not back to 36 or higher because there is no trading Monday and earnings are pre-market on Tuesday. So if you were waiting for a pull back in order to get in, today was that opportunity. Last thought, I would not fear the lock up expiration. If earnings are not as expected and we see lowest or high 20's after earnings do you think people will unload their shares when they see that it hit $45. Also I think Thiel and Karp have a ton of money to buy those shares on Fri the 19th if they beat earnings and get a pop to reward not only their employees but to drive out the shorts and reward us longs for our loyalty!! I want to wish you all good luck. In 25 years of investing and being in on some very good trades early in aapl, goog, Tesla. I can tell you PLTR is 100 stock in 18-24 months. I do think that values are stretched past 45 but at 40-45 is a good value if they beat on earnings especially with IBM being a great start into the corporate world with the GOVT being a solid income source forever.",0.9972

You only lose when you sell impatiently. Avoid emotional highs (where the market is doing great so you keep buying up everything) & emotional lows (omg it’s red= let me sell and cut my losses). 4.

Why don’t you disrupt your own industry? It’s broken. Why do you disrupt it with some of these new technologies? Why don’t you harness social media? Why don’t you invite people in—even your competitors—to brainstorm about these new ideas, to help spread the word?” And so I did that, and it’s been amazing.

4309,"The investment opportunity in PLTR really is quite simple. Currently trading at a 45% discount from all time highs, you have the chance to get into a SaaS leader in a big time AI data space that isn't going to be regulated but is actually contractually partnered with allied governments. Logically speaking, in the future of business across all sectors, you either operate using AI or you get wiped out by competitors that do. So companies have the option of creating their own ai budget, hiring, training, implementing which takes TIME which is equal to dollars lost. Or, they install a software that is the leader and most advanced in the space they require to not only thrive but survive vs competition. The fact that people don't seem to understand base level logic is mind blowing. When multi billion dollar companies are up against it penny pinching as interest rates rise down the road and the economy becomes even more competitive, there's no longer two options there's only one. Take from this what you will but for those who understand business forget the numbers and media for a minute and just use you brain, simply, make a choice.",0.9867

People are reading tea leaves due to Facebook job postings and there have been MANY more large Enterprises that have Palantir experience in the job descriptions.I believe a relationship with Facebook is imminent. The threat for child exploitation, child trafficking, etc is real on FB and Palantir helps in this regard already with orgs specifically addressing this real threat in a growing virtual world.I also believe the relationship of Thiel with Facebook (Series A and Series C investor) helps the relationship come together. I expect THE SAME from the likes of Tesla (to take autonomous driving, robo taxis, etc) to the next level and continue to help Tesla outpace Chinese brands like Nio, Xpeng, etc. because after all, Palantir doesn’t get down with China.I also expect the same with SpaceX as flying people around will require extensive data analysis and predictive outcomes..I expect the same with PayPal as PayPal has gone heavy on Bitcoin and the managing/security of the dark web on Crypto will require policing and that’s right up the Palantir playbook. So sit tight my friends. But don’t get restless waiting for a Facebook announcement. Not all commercial contracts are public.

4578,"Forwarded as received from one Reddit memberAll of Palantir?s (weekly) blockbuster deals/contracts/partnership are being downplayed by financial media.Disclaimer: This isn?t DD nor is it financial advice. This post is for educational purposes only. My views are my own. Let?s talk about Japan, a notoriously a difficult market to enter for a slew of reasons. Successfully entering the Japanese market in any capacity is a big deal, especially for a western company. This has been completely buried by the financial media as we continue to see minimal positive coverage of Palantir. Once the Japanese market starts bearing fruit for Palantir the implications are huge. Rio Tinto, a mining giant recently signed a ?significant? multiyear agreement to license its Foundry analytics platform for mining. Again, the trend we?re seeing in the financial media is to downplay these big deals. Mining is extremely competitive, if one company adopts a tech that can save money or affect the bottom line others will have no choice but to line up. In a [press release](https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-license-deal-mining-gian-rio-tinto-51611847014) Rio Tinto said that the deal ?is an important step in our digital transformation; enabling fast-paced, forward-looking decision making across our operations leading to improved results in safety, cost and production.?A giant, in the mining industry is using Palantir to digitally transform their business. The language is important. We?ve been hearing about digital transformation for years but all that?s meant for most is switching retail sales to online sales. Palantir is truly transforming the digital world. By taking data (which company?s usually have in droves and do almost nothing with) and turning it into a tool to increase productivity, efficiency and safety has major implications, not just for mining but for every company. Palantir seems to have found the new gold rush and they?re the only game in town. The latest partnership with IBM is yet another blockbuster announcement that?s been totally downplayed IBM is [fortune 50 company](https://fortune.com/fortune500/2020/search/), ranked 38th. For some perspective Disney is 49th and Facebook is 46th. But we?re not talking about IBMs achievements I?m getting at IBM?s gigantic customer base. IBM?s customer base include governments all around the world and even more impressively, the entire Fortune 500. As a partner Palantir now has a direct line to companies like Walmart, Amazon, Exxon, Apple etc etc. To say the implications here are massive may be an understatement. Just a quick factoid, Apple had to partner with IBM to fuel its enterprise growth, and their partnership did just that. What I believe is the most downplayed of all of this is the fact that Palantir is a downright monopoly. Right now we?re hearing that the market doesn?t know exactly what Palantir does or how to price it. This is typical #$%$ from Wall Street. Don?t these guys make billions of dollars from assimilating information like this before anyone else? If demo day showed us anything it?s that no company can currently do what Palantir does. In Theils own words Palantir is truly a 0 to 1 company, not a 1+. When I see Palantir through an objective lens and not Wall Street?s I can safely assume that Palantir, a monopoly, can achieve a 1 trillion dollar ($500 SP) market cap and above. With the explosive deals coming in weekly that would seem sooner rather than later. A couple of months ago I thought a 10 year timeline may have brought Palantir close to that number but I wasn?t factoring in some key statistics. The main one that I don?t exactly know how quickly a monopoly can grow. And that monopolies that were around back in the day didn?t have such a big market. I don?t think industries were as big as they are now with completely new sectors that have emerged since then. $1T MC was just an idea in the 80?s and 90?s. Now we have a handful of companies with trillion dollar market caps. Apple?s is 2.2 trillion while Microsoft is closing in on 2 trillion. With Palantir being a monopoly, inflation, and world trade opened to its fullest capacity I think Palantir achieving a $1 trillion market cap could be sooner than I initially thought.",0.9995

4637,"From 2012: SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Facebook Inc jumped nearly 13 percent on Wednesday, as investors breathed a sigh of relief that expiring trading restrictions on a huge block of shares failed to trigger an immediate wave of insider selling.“While the lockup is expiring, there is nothing requiring anybody to sell,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. “Given the low price, these long-term holders are deciding to hold the stock, and that is lifting it here as the fear of the expiration subsides.”Roughly 800 million Facebook shares were eligible for sale on Wednesday after restrictions on insider selling were lifted on the biggest block since Facebook’s May initial public offering.The lockup expiration greatly expands the 921-million-share “float” available for trading on the market until now.“We’ve seen this before with other lockups. People sell them leading up to the lockup period expiring, and then they have a bit of a relief rally,” said Ryan Jacob, chief executive of the Jacob Funds, which does not own Facebook shares.In August, shares of the online reviews website Yelp Inc surged by more than 20 percent on the day that insider trading restrictions expired. That stock’s rally was boosted as short-sellers scrambled to cover their positions when the expected flood of selling failed to materialize, say analysts.",0.8728

4820,"I've been in the investment business for 30 years and worked with wall street traders in my prime. It's not simply ""coincidence"" that there is a strong support level for this stock at 22.50, which is exactly 50% from the high of 45.00. This is where large institutions and fund managers will step in and either start or add to existing positions. Of course the price can go lower than 22.50, as seen on 3/5 when it went down to the low 20's, but the panic selling that day was bought up quickly. Follow the money.This is precisely why Ark and other companies kept adding shares around the $23 level (and lower) as it was getting closer to 22.50. Ask yourself, at what level do institutions wait to buy, 50% from the highs, 60%, 70%? They won't ""wait"" for 60% or 70%... Could PLTR go lower than $20, of course anything is possible, especially in this rate environment, but it's highly unlikely at this point. All of the angry posters on here saying the stock will go to $10 have zero experience.Bottom line, no doubt this will be a rocky road near term, but the market has already shown us the pressure points on this stock. Plus, the market has already shown how quickly the stock bounced from $20 on 3/5 low to $27 on 3/15, less than two weeks. So relax, use the dips to buy and you will be rewarded, not only long term, but within weeks. Leave emotion at the door and use logic.

People seem to forget that Tesla since it’s conception operated at a loss for many of the same reasons. Tesla just this year became profitable but it’s stock was always seen as an overvaluation by those who couldn’t see the long game. Palantir is long, no short term profits here. They are a leader in their industry that has just truly left the development phase and are moving quickly into distribution.

(NASDAQ: PLTR) shares were advancing Thursday after the data analytics software company announced a strategic partnership.What Happened: Palantir said it has entered into a six-year strategic partnership with French automotive supplier Faurecia to help the latter accelerate its digital transformation and move toward carbon neutrality.The French company will use Palantir's Foundry software to obtain better insights on data from manufacturing to purchasing, and from engineering to finances.The software will help reduce Faurecia's material consumption, improve R&D competitiveness, secure purchasing excellence and track and measure overall CO2 neutrality efforts, according to Palantir.""The range of uses for Foundry across Faurecia shows the breadth of practical applications for our software in the manufacturing and automotive sectors,"" said Palantir COO Shyam Sankar.Why It's Important: Palantir's revenue guidance for fiscal year 2021 suggests a slowdown in growth to 30%-plus compared to 40% growth in the fourth quarter of 2021.The commercial segment's revenue growth slowed in the fourth quarter.Partnerships such as the one with Faurecia are likely to accelerate revenue momentum, eventually helping the company to outperform expectations.",0.9791

We're giving people more unemployment money than what they earned while working, and telling them they don't even have to look for a job to get it. We're giving families that make as much as $150,000 a year stimulus checks.

So you have oversold conditions at a longer term moving average and a candle showing bearish sentiment is slowing down and being overcome by bullish sentiment. No promises, I'm not a financial advisor, make your own decisions, but IMHO I think it is more likely the share price has a several dollar increase on Monday than a decrease.

Finally, AWS offers ANALYTICS services as well7. Since Palantir deals with data analytics, it makes sense to team up with AWS to use the many AWS services and help generate REVENUE using the millions of companies who are also using AWS services 8.

To me, everything he says resonates deeply and I would follow the guy off a cliff. Of course there are obvious drawbacks - if not constantly fact-checked, these guys end up chasing chemtrails and blaming the govt for 9/11, and the only way to really tell the difference is to look at their history - are they delivering on their grand visions? Well, with PLTR, the answer is a resounding ""yes"", they are frigging changing the world to the better already (finding Bin Laden??).

I think it's more likely that it will re-test the $40s (and maybe surge to $50) after the earnings and forward guidance are announced. PLTR continues to be undervalued in the $30s.

Think of 17 years = Gathering specific requirements from the government, DESIGN, CODING, TESTING, DOCUMENTATION, etc...4. Any competitor has to deal with a LOT of time to try to catch up with PLTR5. Google is SCARED of the fact that team (AWS + IBM + Palantir) are now working together to Bring down the Google house of cards (DATA is what Google collects from all of us)6. There is a possibility that Amazon or IBM may ACQUIRE Palantir for 100's of BILLIONS of dollars7. Many people don't know what Palantir software does. Here are some examples:...a. Many businesses have millions of customers' DATA located in many files, databases, and profiles. ...b. Palantir will gather this historic data, analyze it, and actually tell your sales team that this customer will be ready to buy a $25K car because his/her current car is old and historically this person NEVER spends more than 30K to buy any car....c. Palantir will tell your sales team that this person prefers to fly United Airlines and goes to a Beach vacation during the month of July. So, your sales team will be presented with a nice offer to fly to Virginia Beach, with United Airline, Hotel, and free museum tickets to Virginia Beach any week during this coming July....d. Obviously, Palantir works with the government/military and many of the services that Palantir offers to the government/military are NOT available to the public... BUT, Palantir can leverage that experience to create Commercial software because of these government/military contracts8. Now you know why Google who COLLECTS and ANALYZES data from your email, search, Google Drive, etc... is SCARED of team (Palantir + IBM + AWS)9. Fair enough?Peace!",0.9855

These same ""Cheer Leaders"" said the same thing when PLTR traded at $30, $35, $40, and $45... Then: BOOM, the price is back to reality and trading at $23 to $25 AGAIN5. Conclusion: If you bought at $23, SELL when it goes to $27 and buy again when it goes back to reality around $23 to $256. Today's stock market is not setup for LONG TERM anymore...7.

No. Will it be the correct move much more often than not? Absolutely.These big hedge funds can manipulate prices any given second, a little PR here & there, and boom: price is manipulated.

7495,"Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community and United States Department of Defense, fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, and cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor (responsible for the GhostNet and the Shadow Network investigation).Other clients as of 2013 included DHS, NSA, FBI, CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point, the Joint IED Defeat Organization and Allies. However, at the time the United States Army continued to use its own data analysis tool.[36] Also, according to TechCrunch, ""The U.S. spy agencies also employed Palantir to connect databases across departments. Before this, most of the databases used by the CIA and FBI were siloed, forcing users to search each database individually. Now everything is linked together using Palantir.""[36]U.S. military intelligence used the Palantir product to improve their ability to predict locations of improvised explosive devices in its war in Afghanistan. A small number of practitioners reported it to be more useful than the United States Army's program of record, the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS-A). California Congressman Duncan D. Hunter complained of United States Department of Defense obstacles to its wider use in 2012.[68]Palantir has also been reported to be working with various U.S. police departments, for example accepting a contract in 2013 to help the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center build a controversial license plates database for California.[69] In 2012 New Orleans Police Department partnered with Palantir to create a predictive policing program.[70]In 2014, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) awarded Palantir a $41 million contract to build and maintain a new intelligence system called Investigative Case Management (ICM) to track personal and criminal records of legal and illegal immigrants. This application has originally been conceived by ICE's office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), allowing its users access to intelligence platforms maintained by other federal and private law enforcement entities. The system reached its ""final operation capacity"" under the Trump administration in September 2017.[71]Palantir took over the Pentagon's Project Maven contract in 2019 after Google decided not to continue developing AI unmanned drones used for bombings and intelligence.[72]International Atomic Energy Agency EditPalantir was used by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify if Iran is in compliance with the 2015 agreement.[40]",0.9959

7519,"How much do investors really want to keep punishing this stock? Corporate insiders sell shares all the time. Over at Facebook, COO Sheryl Sandberg sells shares pretty much every month like clockwork. It's not as though the insiders at PLTR have sold off all of their shares: they sold a portion and kept a portion. And I'm sure they have share options as part of their compensation package and will be obtaining and selling more shares in the weeks, months, and years to come. But again: How much do we really want to keep punishing this stock? Do investors really believe that this is a $10 or $20 stock? If so, it never should have gone to $45, as it did in January, and it never should have run for 16 straight trading days from late January to mid February with closing prices above $30. Yesterday, for two minutes, investors thought PLTR was a $30 stock. Today, for 15 minutes, investors thought it was a $20 stock. Obviously, it can't be both, and it's unlikely to be either. PLTR is going to become a $50 stock, then an $80 stock, and then a $100 stock. Then, over time, it will become a $200 stock, a $300 stock, and so on. Basically, all it will take to become a solidly $50 stock is news of one or two new major clients, such as an Apple or a Facebook or a foreign government, and a Q1 earnings report that reflects net-positive earnings per share.

I truly believe we'll all look back one day and realize this was just a moment in time. I added 2k shares at $26.25 and thought I was getting a steal. That steal won't be recognized for some time it seems. The earnings report was strong but this stock based compensation negative and the subsequent sales that are being promoted by Yahoo like a feature film while contracts with 3M and others are hardly a blip is putting pressure on the stock. Lastly - I'm of the belief that this is where the stock market saying of money moving from the inpatient to the patient is reality. While our options traders and short term swing traders get burnt and move on, the institutions use that as an opportunity to grab shares without having to move the needle. We may have weeks more of this BS but I do believe that over the next 2-3 earnings calls we'll finally reverse this back to the upside and for the long haul. Gluck everyone!",0.9913

8058,"How does a company continually make no profits and proceed to stay in business? It seems counterintuitive at best. However, companies can become successful even without turning profits for extended periods of time – and can even simultaneously continue to attract investors.There are three basic ways big companies survive without profits.Purposeful Reinvestment – Earnings are significant and large, but the company chooses to put most of its revenues back into the business to keep propelling growth. Amazon is the king of purposeful reinvestment, infrequently reporting a profit in its more than twenty years of existence and following an overt strategy focused on continued growth over profits. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has the revenue and base to allow profits, but it argues that without constant investment in its business, the company would be overtaken by competitors in different fields.Hopeful Expansion – Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is a good example of this category. With recent acquisitions such as Vine, Periscope and MoPub, Twitter is trying to carve out a larger social media presence but is dealing with considerable expenses, including almost 45 percent of revenue paid out in compensation as stock options. As opposed to Amazon, the intent is to reach and sustain profitability.Initial Growth – The company shows incredible growth and promise in its early stages and secures venture capital...",0.9975

(NYSE:PLTR) today announced a multi-million dollar expansion of its relationship with 3M. 3M has chosen to expand its use of Palantir's Foundry platform to support its digital transformation, assisting in the build out of a dynamic supply chain that enables the global manufacturer to respond nimbly to changes in demand across tens of thousands of products.“In an increasingly complex world, the success of our business depends on our ability to respond quickly to changing facts on the ground,” said Brig Knott, 3M’s Vice President, End to End Service, Operations & Lean Six Sigma. “In the midst of a global pandemic and significant changes to our demand across products, the Foundry platform enabled us to react quickly and effectively. We’re excited to expand this work across the 3M enterprise.”“3M has been at the forefront of digital transformation, and we’re excited to deepen our relationship with this innovative and global company,” said Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Palantir.This expanded relationship builds on the work Palantir already supports across 3M’s efforts in supply chain alerting, demand forecasting and business planning. “Palantir has played an important role for our Enterprise Operations digital migration strategy; we’re eager to keep pushing the boundaries to ensure a continued focus on our customers,” noted Shaun Braun, 3M’s VP of Digital Transformation.",0.9905

The fact that this is holding up at this price despite what's happening in the market at the exact same time of the lockup expiration is not only a miracle but a show of strength. You have funds ADDING regularly while the many of you complain of stagnation. For starters, this is up 150% since DPO only 5 months ago. The earnings report was a thing of BEAUTY outside of the stock based compensation (which means very little in it's infancy as a public company). The insider sales have happened at EVERY SINGLE company regardless of vertical. Facebook, Google, Appl, AMZN take your pick people. The village nit wits that want you to believe this is some malpractice by PLTR leadership are a joke and only attempting to scare you.This is primed and pumped to be a CASH COW...The upside to this pandemic has been many more people are at home and investing out of boredom. No boss or anyone else to look over your shoulder while you frequent message boards or your holdings account. That downside is every Tom, Dianna and Harry wants to be a day trader, looking for immediate returns. Invest in this long term and be graced with profits that you've only previously dreamt about.

You don’t realize how this opens up an entirely new addressable market that was not even included in the investor day presentation.Palantir made a shift from having companies need to buy Gotham or Foundry in full. To deciding to offer Foundry up in modular form. Meaning they give organizations who didn’t have the budget, approval or foresight to its full capabilities org wide. The option to bite off components of Foundry and in smaller deployments.That modularity was a genius move as many medium/large business may not be able to justify massive enterprise wide deployment. However, by letting these companies dabble with aspects of Foundry they know it will lead to more wide spread adoption across other functions of those business and allow organic growth of Foundry within those accounts.Now bring in AWS partnership and you have your Trojan horse into those many medium/large businesses that were not a part of your TAM as the TAM was entirely Enterprise customer focused. Which is where the small PLTR sales team and IBM reps will pitch PLTR.AWS enterprise agreements require customers to spend x amount of money per year but that money can be spent across their platform products as well (which now includes Foundry)That’s right if you have an AWS Enterprise Agreement you are obligated to maintain a certain amount of spend across their platform products in order to maintain your EA and it’s negotiated discounts.Customers will literally be using Foundry, making palantir money simply out of necessity which will lead to further adoptionLastly - My tech sales counterparts who work for Amazon (AWS) are incentivized handsomely for selling adoption into partner solutions. Aka we just gathered an AWS sales force as well to go along with our IBM team and our direct team.AWS accessibility of Palantir for customers is a big deal.",0.9959

You don’t realize how this opens up an entirely new addressable market that was not even included in the investor day presentation.Palantir made a shift from having companies need to buy Gotham or Foundry in full. To deciding to offer Foundry up in modular form. Meaning they give organizations who didn’t have the budget, approval or foresight to its full capabilities org wide. The option to bite off components of Foundry and in smaller deployments.That modularity was a genius move as many medium/large business may not be able to justify massive enterprise wide deployment. However, by letting these companies dabble with aspects of Foundry they know it will lead to more wide spread adoption across other functions of those business and allow organic growth of Foundry within those accounts.Now bring in AWS partnership and you have your Trojan horse into those many medium/large businesses that were not a part of your TAM as the TAM was entirely Enterprise customer focused.

It is often difficult to take in all that is said during a live ""Earnings"" call, but in the quiet of your own time, you can spend the time digesting and understanding what was communicated. Not only have I taken the time to read the transcript, but I have also complete follow-up research on key points I want to understand better. For example, there is so much chatter about the US government being a single point of failure because so much of Palantir's business is with them. For this reason, they must diversify their customer base to grow and thrive. Although this would most certainly be beneficial, it belays the fact that the US government alone spends 4.4Trillion per year - 12% for Defense, 23% for Healthcare, and 25% other (as an example). Palantir only did 610Million in business with the US government (in 2020) because in the prior models they focused on the IT sector within the government. However, with the investments in the end-to-end workflows (Apollo and Foundry), they can now focus on nearly 250Billion worth of business with the US government. The deal with IBM was made possible because the investments made to improve the cradle to grave process (or as they say mud to space) delivered 84% gross margin - do you know what that means? They can now bring on channel partners because there is enough compensation there for everyone to be paid accordingly. Furthermore, this means that they can now extend this offering to other channel partners. Another note-worthy nugget was the fact that they already have 2.8B in the sales pipeline with an average contract duration of 3.8years. Do you understand what that means - customer stickiness! And the final point I will draw attention to was their projection for sales of 30% compounded annually for the next 5years (2025). A question was asked by one of the shareholders - can Palantir sustain such growth? Shyam’s response was thorough and he ended with this line....""And these are examples of why we're confident in our long-term growth of being greater than 4 billion in 2025"". For these and many more reasons I will be a long-term holder of this stock.",0.9978

Now play with the idea that long institutions and insiders now own close to a majority of the shares and they won't sell anytime soon - what volume is then required to make this move quite drastically upwards? My bet is that it won't take much, as the actively traded shares are actually not that many, less than 600 million, which is basically pre-lockup levels. With a loooong list of catalysts ahead, probably including but not limited to, Apple, Facebook, this is perfectly positioned to have FOMO applied to a limited number of shares.
