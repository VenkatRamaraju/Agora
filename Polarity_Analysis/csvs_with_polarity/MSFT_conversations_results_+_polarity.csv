In addition, don’t be surprised if a big private-equity firm jumps into the group. Keep in mind, a lot can happen between now and the time that Microsoft actually makes a bid. It is currently focused on TikTok’s US operations — around 100 million monthly users, mainly Gen-Zers and social-media influencers in this country who use the short-video app to post everything from dance videos to commentary to political satire. But TikTok’s audience is expected to expand; sports franchises are said to be interested in posting.That said, a Microsoft bid is far from a done deal. The company has looked at whether buying just the US portion makes sense since TikTok has 800 million users globally. Moreover, it will have to convince President Trump that the app is secure from Chinese influence.While all this plays out, TikTok’s future in the US is ticking away.“",0.9963

556,"Tech Valuations Are Stretched, But Investors Are Still Bullish, Survey Finds -- Barrons.comDOW JONES & COMPANY, INC. 5:59 AM ET 1/6/2020 Symbol Last Price Change CRM 166.17down 0 (0%) MSFT 158.62down 0 (0%) FB 208.67down 0 (0%) CSCO 47.63down 0 (0%) INTC 60.1down 0 (0%) QUOTES AS OF 06:30:00 PM ET 01/03/2020 Tech stocks had a great year in 2019, and institutional investors remain bullish on the sector for 2020 -- maybe a little too bullish.That's one of the conclusions of a recent investor survey conducted by Wolfe Research tech strategist Steve Milunovich. He writes in a research note Friday that Wolfe expects high single-digit overall stock market returns this year driven by central bank easing, moderating trade tensions with China and the probability of a moderate Democratic Presidential nominee. The tech sector, he adds, should do well in that environment.But Milunovich adds that he's recommending a market weighting in tech shares, asserting that the sector is "" overbought near term,"" that earnings expectations may be too high for 2020, and that the ""malinvestment created by money printing"" will come home to roost, perhaps in 2021 rather than 2020.Milunovich finds other warning signs. ""The stock market cap-to-GDP ratio is about 150%, the highest since 2000, and a number of valuation metrics are near extreme levels,"" he writes. ""Central banks' easiness is a source of near-term support but long-term risk. We would argue that easy money led to the bubbles of 2000 and 2008 and that we may be in the midst of a credit bubble.""And he points out that tech stock valuations are at the highest they've been since 2000. His research note includes a list of 39 companies trading for more than 10 times next 12 months sales -- most of them enterprise software companies.Nonetheless, Milunovich reports that his latest tech investor survey found 67% of respondents bullish on the market, with 6% bearish and none ""very bearish.""In the survey, investors were asked to name their favorite stocks -- and their least favorite. -- Salesforce.com(CRM) was the most popular long. Milunovch notes that the stock has underperformed while digesting its June 2019 acquisition of data analytics provider Tableau Software for $15.7 billion, and that ""there is anticipation of a catch up."" -- Microsoft(MSFT) was next on the list. ""Given Azure momentum, there is little negative to say other than tougher compares and an expanded multiple,"" he writes. -- Nvidia (NVDA) was third on the list, but it also showed up among the ranks of the least liked. ""We agree with the positive view given growth in AI and new product offerings for inference [artificial intelligence] and the edge."" -- Rounding out the top five list: Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook(FB) , despite regulatory concerns. Milunovich notes that the compensation plan for new Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai ties stock vesting to the stock's relative performance.As for the stocks investors like the least, the roster is dominated by legacy tech. -- IBM (IBM) tops the list, with Oracle (ORCL) next. ""Investors aren't yet convinced by IBM's Red Hat acquisition nor Oracle's autonomous database offering,"" he writes. -- Cisco(CSCO) recently cut top-line guidance by about $1 billion, and ""a quick recovery is not expected."" -- Intel(INTC) also is among the least loved. Despite ""reasonable"" valuation, Milunovich finds that the chip giant has ""execution and [market] share challenges."" -- And then there's Nvidia again. He notes that ""the bear case includes high valuation and rising competition from Intel(INTC), AMD and startups.""The survey also asked about tech trends.""The hottest tech trend is 5G,"" he writes. ""Marketing of 5G handsets could lift sales later in 2020, but we think the real impact will be in enterprise IoT applications later. Public cloud continues to benefit hyperscalers [like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud] and their component suppliers while disadvantaging legacy vendors. AI is more ingredient than product but could prove highly disruptive. Investors seem calmer about regulation, which was the top issue last survey.""Write to Eric J.

The type of Cloud Customers MSFT has means retaining records forever in The Cloud. There are different levels of Cloud Costs. MSFT offers Advanced Protection that I believe they have described as unhackable. Forget that for a minute. When Windows 10 kicked off there where a Plethora of Free Cloud Storage offers from MSFT, PC Purchases HD and Backup Drive 3rd parties. People lives are on the Azure cloud form peoples Photo's to Developers life's work. Azure integrates into a Windows 10 PC like a regular C Hard Drive. That means it is very important. Those free offers end date is right in this time frame. MSFT sent messages saying that if you do not pay for Cloud Storage your data will be removed soon by a certain date. If you buy Office 365 it includes the Cloud Space. Users face losing everything or simply clicking a buy Office 365 with the same User name and that is it, your One Drive Azure Problem is fixed and well worth it for the cheap price they charge. This year it is not only a wave of Business Cloud but all the too many zeros for me to type of Personal users paying to keep the data they stored during Free Cloud Promo Offers that are now expiring. I my not be a fancy analyst but that sort of means a surprise in Office 365 Personal & Small Business sales just to keep all the Data they have up on Azure Cloud. That in combination with the big boys being faced with a looming W7change to W10 or pay whatever extended service special deal extensions may be earnings catalysts in my opinion.",0.9844

Even if Microsoft just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

1311,"Make Dollars Not Pocket Change Shorting Microsoft Stock. While investors go long in expectation that the stock will appreciate in price, traders go short in anticipation that the stock will tumble. Short selling makes it possible to sell what one does not own. The short seller achieves this by borrowing the stock from a broker, and immediately selling the stock at its current market price, with the sale proceeds credited to the short seller’s margin account. At a future point in time, the short seller will cover the short position by buying it in the market and repaying the loaned stock to the broker.The difference between the sale price and the purchase price represents the short seller’s profit or loss. Let’s assume you short 100 shares of hypothetical stock ABC at $10 per share; after a period of time, the stock has declined to $5, at which point you buy it back. Your gross profit on this short sale is thus $500 ([$10 - $5] x 100 shares). Your net profit will be lower, owing to the costs involved with short selling. What are these costs (apart from the obvious one, trading commissions)? Margin interest, for one, which is the interest paid on the margin debt incurred for the short sale (explained in the next section). Then there’s the actual cost to borrow the stock, which can be quite high for stocks that are heavily shorted or difficult to borrow. Plus the short seller also has to pay the lender of the stock any dividends or rights declared during the course of the stock loan.The best thing to do right now is not buy Microsoft until it's much lower.

1561,"Hot Stock In The Spotlight : – Microsoft Corporation, (NASDAQ: MSFT)March 5, 2019 - by NNT TEAM - Leave a CommentThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a technical indicator used in the analysis of financial markets. It is intended to chart the current and historical strength or weakness of a stock or market based on the closing prices of a recent trading period. The indicator should not be confused with relative strength. The RSI is most typically used on a 14-day timeframe, measured on a scale from 0 to 100, with high and low levels marked at 70 and 30, respectively.

A short while later we decided to marry. In an effort to clear debt before tying the knot, she sold her shares to pay off her car loan. Upon learning she did so, I was supportive of her becoming debt free but said we could have worked on the loan together without selling the stock. Fast forward 30 plus years of marriage, that 20 share purchase today would be 5760 shares worth roughly $1,180,800 paying $11,750 annual dividend.

Perhaps the strongest evidence came at a 2001 conference at the National Press club, where ex-military, NASA, FAA, and intelligence officials came forward to give their experiences. On Wednesday, May 9th, 2001, over twenty military, intelligence, government, corporate and scientific witnesses came forward at the National Press Club in Washington, DC to establish the reality of UFOs or extraterrestrial vehicles, extraterrestrial life forms, and resulting advanced energy and propulsion technologies. The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena.

1743,"WHY BUY SENS NOW!From Healthcare providers who implant Dexcom, Abbott and Eversensedaily.""I have been reading these posts for about a year and think it might be helpful to weigh in. I am a Nurse Practitioner and a Diabetes Specialist. I have placed several of the 3 month Eversense sensors in the past and am a stock holder. I bought it a few years ago when I was being detailed on the technology knowing it would be a game changer. (I also bought in early to Dexcom and Tandem). Patients love this technology and were quite upset when the sales force was pulled due to Covid. It was really starting to catch on. Patients were asking for it and more insurers were covering it. The technology absolutely works and patients much appreciated the autonomy. Sensors are cumbersome and have to be changed about every 10 days. Some fail or dislodge. Eversense is a game changer. My only hesitation (and for my colleagues as well) was the 90 day insertion period. It is a surgical insertion and the site locations are limited. Many of us wanted to wait to push until a 180 day sensor was available in order to limit number of insertions per year and risk of scar tissue over time for longer term users. Insertion, however, is easy to do and was starting to be reimbursed.I do think that Eversense will end up with a pump partner for a closed loop system. IMO, Tandem makes the most user friendly pump and is paired with Dexcom. It is the best functioning set on the market. Medtronic led with the first closed loop system, but their pump is cumbersome and their sensors have always lacked accuracy issues. The new Omni pod is interesting. They have accuracy issues in the past, that they seem to be resolving with their new pump. They are the only tubeless pump and might be a good partner for the Eversense. So would the Tandem pump.Anyway, I agree with those who think that this stock is a long term hold and will substantially increase in the next few years. The product just works.",0.9936

2008,"What Microsoft really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Microsoft (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Microsoft just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

HP is also a leader in its fields, although the ones it plays in aren't as fast-growing -- nor, arguably, as exciting -- as Microsoft's key arenas. With that being said, HP offers a fatter dividend than Microsoft does, and my view is that sentiment around Microsoft continues to be very favorable, while the market seems to be quite down on HP after its most recent earnings results. This could mean that although Microsoft is arguably the better business, HP could potentially provide better stock returns than Microsoft over the medium term if, say, Microsoft hits a speed bump and HP manages to deliver a nice recovery from here. However, if I were to choose one of these two stocks to buy and hold for the next couple of decades, I'd have to give the nod to Microsoft.",0.8152

2105,"All this talk by the talking heads about frothy tech valuations and comparisons with the 2000 tech bubble is so ridiculous and overplayed. Companies like Microsoft and few others don’t have frothy valuations. The upside to the cloud growth hasn’t even been defined yet. In other words, it is possible that we experience strong growth year after year for several years and we may still not know where the top is.A more appropriate comparison with the 2000 tech bubble would be EVs / battery makers. There are obviously strong players like $TSLA who have a deservedly rich valuation, but there are also so many companies who don’t have any products in the market and may not have them for several more years. Then there are companies who aren’t even planning to own means of production and have partnerships with other manufacturers to make the cars and sell under their brand. Sorry, but this is not a simple phone or French fries. Owning the factories are critical to success, IMO. And it is these EV / battery stocks that are trading at such rich valuation that I think has already reached bubble levels.TL;DR - Microsoft is not like other big tech and possibly has years and years of high growth in the cloud space. I don’t see any froth in its valuation. OTOH, I’d be very wary of investing in EV / battery stocks, especially ones that aren’t producing / selling vehicles in 2021 or beyond.All that said, I’m still quite bearish on $MSFT because I believe that the talking heads are influencing the investors and keeping them from an otherwise attractive company like Microsoft.",0.9881

2164,"Valuing Microsoft Stock The number one tech giant.Some people may be turned off by Microsoft — which is quietly holding the top spot as the most valuable publicly traded company — because of its seemingly high valuation. But I don’t think that should be the case. The company is incredibly consistent and has several additional assets that warrant a premium.First, analysts expect double-digit sales growth for the rest of this year and next year. Estimates call for 12.4% growth this year and 10.4% in 2020. The same can be said for earnings growth, with estimates calling for 14.2% growth and 12.6% growth this year and next, respectively.Based purely on the growth, some might argue that MSFT stock is not worth 25 times this year’s earnings. But then you consider the fact Microsoft has beat earnings estimates for 14 straight quarters. Or the fact that it has $127.6 billion in short-term cash and investments vs. just $4.9 billion in short-term debt. Or that its total current assets outweigh total current liabilities $156.8 billion to $50.3 billion. Then, one realizes just how powerful this company is from a balance sheet perspective.While free cash flow has stagnated over the last 12 months, the trailing 12 months of operating cash flow (OCF) has solid growth. Up about 10% over the past year, MSFT has more than $46 billion in trailing OCF. That figure is up almost 45% over the past three years.Microsoft has become a cash-flow giant with a massive balance sheet and solid growth. Plus, it’s not afraid of M&A. This tech titan will be around for a while and deserves its blue-chip premium.",0.9957

Some business-centric data hinted on a possible bottoming out of the U.S. manufacturing.Second, U.S. corporates have performed better-than expected in fourth-quarter 2019. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be up 0.8% on 4.3% higher revenues year to date. This is a complete turnaround from earnings decline of 3.2% year over year on 3.5% higher revenues, projected at the beginning of the reporting cycle.More importantly, despite the outbreak of the coronavirus, total earnings of the S&P 500 index for the ensuing first-quarter 2020, are now expected to be up 1% on 5% higher revenues year over year.Third, an accommodative Fed and continuation of easy money policies have restored investor confidence on risky stock markets.

Every US government agency I am aware of still uses Windows and MS Office software almost exclusively. 12 years in private industry working for companies from Fortune 500 sized to small business and I rarely used anything that wasn't an MS Windows computer with MS Office. For over 30 years MSFT has maintained virtual lock the office software market and they've started transitioning to a potentially more lucrative subscription model. MS Azure cloud infrastructure that rivals Amazons AWS which is likely how they won the DoD contract. Microsoft also dabbles in the computer gaming industry with the Xbox and around 15 million Xbox game pass subscribers. They also have a their fingers in the telecommuting pie with Microsoft Teams and Skype. They also own Linked-In, the major professional social media site which racked up $6.8 billion in revenue in FY 2019. They also own GitHub, the premier online content management and software development site.

Contract that to India and the plethora of High Tech companies founded and/or led by people from India. One country has free elections the other does not.

It's 216-220 now. 80% a year beats the dow and the sp500 by 3 and beats the nasdaq by 2. My husband opened a position with Microsoft in 2009 when it went under 20 dollars (pe ratio was like 10, even though the revenue was still increasing lol) with 25,000 dollars and is worth over 350,000 now since he reinvests most dividends.

The strategic change was drastic, but CEO Satya Nadella has shifted Microsoft's focus rapidly since taking over five years ago. The ability to shift strategies is key because tech companies have to adapt and evolve over time. In the long term, Microsoft's financial performance speaks for itself and shows how well the company adapts.

When it goes down $ six or 7 dollars as it is doing it today All am doing to bring up my cost basis by buying more. I only make more as it goes up. I lose when it goes down.

The report came in as very good news and yet investors sold shares heavily after hours. This kind of behavior is typical of professional investors who operate by the maxim ""buy the rumor and sell the news."" What that notion describes is a tactic used by fund managers who need to unload their positions and move money to different stocks. During such times they often have a lot of shares to sell—too many to be sure they won't hurt prices as they sell. To optimize their profit-taking activities, they try to find a time when the shares are likely to have a lot of buyers. What better time than when earnings are great and market sentiment seems to be strong? However the timing of this strategy coincided with a moment when even retail investors were growing nervous (See Caleb Silver's article from last week ). It seems many other traders and investors had the same idea""",0.9926

They experienced a slow down in Azure cloud service revenue however so did Amazon the market leader, additionally that are the only big tech company I have seen that are still trading well below the Analyst price target, Tik Tok is just a tiny reason in the overall formula of why MSFT is a Buy and why we should hopefully see a strong breakout at some point in the near future however this market were in does not seem to follow any sense of logic but I am sticking to my guns with this one.",0.9413

As an example, in the first calendar quarter of 2020, revenue from AWS grew 33%, while Azure grew 59%. But that's not the only tool in Microsoft's bag of tricks. The company also provides a host of other services via the cloud, like Microsoft 365, Teams videoconferencing software, Windows Virtual Desktop, and Dynamics accounting software, to name a few.The diversity of Microsoft's business also makes it attractive. It has exposure to consumer markets and enterprise products (like Xbox gaming and its LinkedIn professional network) in addition to its business and personal software and fast-growing cloud segments.That strength was on full display in Microsoft's fiscal fourth quarter, ended June 30. Even in the face of the pandemic, revenue grew 13% year over year, with each of its business segments contributing to the better-than-expected performance. Azure grew 47% while Xbox jumped 65%, both boosted by the remote-work and stay-at-home economy. This wide assortment of businesses and its high-growth cloud segment make Microsoft an attractive addition to any portfolio.",0.9938

Looking back, I was fortunate to have hit a growth spurt that I thought was not possible for such a large cap stock like MSFT. I had two entry points; the first in 1Q '18 and I sold out in Oct '18 for a respectable gain of ~11%; and the second entry in Jan '19 at almost the same exit price (within $1) now with a paper gain of ~36%.Since Mar of 2018 to now with the same share count at each entry, I have accumulated a mixture of realized / unrealized gains of <50%. However the recent 7 month holding period vs the 6 mo first one is triple the gain in the same time span.How can this information help you? IMHO, the reason for the take off of MSFT in the past 7 mos is directly attributable to explosive cloud / Azure revenue / margin growth. I am about to write covered calls - the Jan 2020 $150's for $5 to get some protection for the ~ accumulated gain of >60%. As a new investor to this or any stock, coming off a price of $94 in Mar of 2018 to >$140 16 mos later indicates to me the stock is probably ahead of itself - that is why I am about to sell the covered calls.As long as Azure & Cloud grows exponentially, entry points need to be measured carefully. Since MSFT just did its second breakout this past Friday, in a matter of a couple weeks, I would be cautious here and watch for dips. Earnings are in Oct and there appears to be support @ $140.50 with resistance between $142 and $143 so it is tight right now.My observations / conclusions are four for what they are worth:1. I agree MSFT is a long term hold;2. MSFT is well overbought right now and earnings dependent for the most part;3. since appreciation is a % game, I would be more inclined to keep some dry powder with smaller / measured bites than the three tranches you are planning;4. a more measured cost basis approach will take the pressure off your decisions if they are too big / overpaying.- perhaps $40k each purchase on dips / market pull backs. Remember MSFT pulled back to $120 in early June.I am simply a private investor attempting to accumulate wealth for a tax deferred account and hope my suggestions provide you some food for thought that can help. Good luck.",0.9995

And now with their delivery of superior 7nm cpus the weight on the AMD scale is rapidly increasing as the weight on the intel side of the scale is decreasing by the exact same amount because intel and AMD are in a duopoly situation where ones loss is the others gain and vice versa., When the pans shift positions it is rapid and catch many by surprise.. only those closely watching the situation realize what is occurring... one way to confirm this movement is by stock price movements, another is by the press and a third by the excitement generated.. I think all of these combine to create the inflection point that Lisa spoke about almost 70 days ago... many in denial as is always the case Nokia looked invincible until rimm blackberry with its tiny keyboard and powerful antennas and low battery consumption squashed them and the excitement of new users was plainly evident. Invincible blackberry was squashed by apples touch screen and GUI interface as blackberry stockholders and execs were in denial about apples threat while customers of the iPhone were buying its stock as rapidly as possible.. AMD is marching along a similar trajectory today with an ever increasing and excited customer base and moving ever closer now to the launch of the 7nm EPYC datacenter server that is going to capture a major percentage of Intels crown  jewel 5 Billion per quarter datacenter business within a few weeks.. the pans of the scale are moving rapidly now and the early adopters already are forcing wall st to realize what is going on.. again I encourage all to buy and hold over time with no margin or options for this game while being planned for many years by AMD is only in the very early innings with the underdog team starting to score goals rapidly while the undisputed leader is playing without a goalie in the net...$BB $AMZN $MSFT $NVDA",0.9984

3926,"US government should be hiring MSFT to protect Americans fro these foreign cyber attacks. All this happening as China cancels the cyber attack truce with the USA.By David Scheer and Dina Bass February 28, 2019 It’s a short -- but startling -- passage tucked inside Microsoft Corp.’s periodic cybersecurity report: State-sponsored hackers attacked several financial services firms and stole “large sums of cash.”The account provides another reminder that hackers are successfully preying on parts of an industry where customer confidence is paramount, and that’s sometimes reluctant to disclose serious attacks. Yet even as the report lays out what happened, it omits sensitive details, such as which government backed the assault or which firms were targeted.Microsoft said it knows about the case because its experts helped victims in the aftermath. In a series of similar incidents, hackers gained administrative access to computer systems by infecting a machine with a “highly targeted, obfuscated backdoor implant,” possibly with a spear-phishing email. Then they sent cash to foreign accounts. In some instances, the hackers went undetected for more than 100 days, and once found, unleashed malware on the victims’ systems, halting operations.FireEye Inc., another cybersecurity firm, described a similar series of attacks in a report published about five months ago. A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment on whether the incidents are related.In that report, FireEye said a North Korean hacking group had infiltrated more than 16 firms in 11 countries including the U.S., stealing more than $100 million. The group’s victims included a Chilean bank that lost $10 million last May. North Korean diplomats and official media have denied that the country plays any role in cyber attacks.",-0.7966

They will be able to use Arc to run Azure data services on OpenShift, Microsoft is expanding to multi-cloud environment why? It’s simpler for those that aren’t familiar with cloud and more data storage as well no cluster and no fuss easy navigation is the future. 3. They are adapting their AI capabilities to allow users to find all possibilities and all solutions to equations, problems, and anything of that sort. 4.

4142,"Hold it for your life, Microsoft will triple.Top ERP Systems for 2019 going strong? #1: Microsoft Dynamics 365. A few years ago, the Microsoft Dynamics product roadmap and ecosystem were a mess. Choosing between Great Plains, Navision, Axapta, and other options was very confusing — even for resellers and system integrators. With the Dynamics 365 platform, however, Microsoft finally has a cohesive cloud ERP strategy. Though the product lacks the maturity of NetSuite and other native cloud ERP offerings, it is a very flexible and scalable solution with relatively easy integration to third-party systems. Organizations large and small are quickly adapting the platform. The offering’s biggest weaknesses are the fragmented and loosely managed ecosystem, relative immaturity of the cloud solution, and flexibility that can be a curse during a transformation. Large companies looking to standardize operations or move to a centralized shared services model may not find the product to be a good fit.#2: SAP S/4HANA. This system has a large market share, especially among Fortune 1000 companies. While the product is relatively immature as the company continues to migrate functionality from its ERP Central Component and other legacy SAP products, it continues to be a de facto option for large organizations that want to scale and standardize. Relative to other options in the market, the system’s framework offers the potential to provide better real-time analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The biggest things holding it back from the #1 spot? The system is often overkill for smaller and mid-size organizations, and SAP failures such as Lidl continue to cast a dark shadow.#3: Oracle NetSuite. The Oracle-owned company was the pioneer of cloud ERP. Unlike Salesforce and Workday, NetSuite has always focused on addressing broader ERP functionality, including financials, inventory management, CRM, HCM, and light manufacturing. A decade ago, NetSuite was a good option primarily for small and some mid-size companies. While that’s still the case, we are seeing more demonstrated scale of the product at upper-mid-market and larger organizations. It continues to broaden and deepen its functionality to meet the needs of manufacturing, project management, forecasting, and other advanced functions traditionally limited to the bigger ERP systems.#5: Salesforce and #4: Workday. Microsoft got a head start and fully gearing up to compete with Google Stadia will turn an Xbox Live sub into Game Pass Ultimate for $1 https://www.cfo.com/enterprise-resource-planning/2018/11/what-are-the-top-erp-systems-for-2019/",0.9892

We still have no clear idea how much will the revenue and profits grow. In my estimate, Cloud will grow exponentially for the next 4-5 years before the competition becomes tight. Also, people need to understand that there are different cloud offerings. Companies like CRM offer software on cloud. Microsoft OTOH provides Cloud Infrastructure, Platform, and Software Services and hence, has a far bigger portfolio than most other Cloud service providers. Also, Microsoft’s offerings are far more sophisticated than a data center.

4431,"YahooFINANCEMicrosoft Stock Benefits From Large BuybacksMark R. HakeInvestorPlaceSeptember 16, 2019, 9:40 AM GMT-5Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock has done very well this year, up almost 35% so far. MSFT stock is still reasonably priced despite the stock rise. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 23 times. MSFT stock sports a healthy 1.34% dividend as well.Microsoft Stock Benefits From Large BuybacksSource: ShutterstockInvestors may not know that one of the main reasons for MSFT stock’s success is its large share buyback program. In the year ending June 30, MSFT spent over $19.5 billion on share buybacks. This is an increase of 82% over the previous 12 months.The share buybacks were even larger than the $13.8 billion MSFT spent on dividends in the year to June. What was the main reason for this?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft’s Free Cash Flow Funds the BuybacksMicrosoft produced a massive $38.3 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in the year to June. Microsoft spent $33.35 billion on share buybacks and dividends from this FCF.Keep in mind that FCF already includes money spent on huge costs and investments. It includes $16.9 billion spent on R&D, $18.2 billion in marketing, all of MSFT’s operating costs. It also includes $13.9 billion spent on capital expenditures.10 Recession-Resistant Services Stocks to BuySo FCF is truly “free” money left over after all these expenses. Microsoft can spend this free cash flow on dividends and share repurchases to benefit shareholders.So what do share buybacks do for MSFT stock shareholders?Buybacks Bring Many BenefitsBuybacks help MSFT stock keep climbing. Microsoft is constantly in the market buying shares. Microsoft bought back 150 million shares in the year to June. This represents about 2% of its total prior shares outstanding. So over time with less supply and with constant demand, the price rises.The buyback activity also keeps Microsoft stock from drastically falling out of bed. It is not uncommon for large corporations like MSFT to take advantage of market breaks. They become buyers of last resort in a sense. They buy more when their stock is cheap. This provides a sense of security to investors.In addition, dividends per share increase over time. For the same dollar amount spent on dividends, the dividend per share can be increased. Another way to put it is buybacks allow the dividend per share to rise faster.Shares repurchased allow earnings per share calculations to rise since the denominator falls. This helps the stock have a lower price-to-earnings ratio. It can lead to a higher stock valuation if the market reprices the stock to its former P/E ratio.Share repurchases also sterilize the increase in shares from stock options and restricted stock issued to employees and consultants. In fact, some large companies like Microsoft have separate buyback programs just to “fund,” so to speak, these share grants.Finally, buybacks increase the remaining shareholders’ stake in the company. This is important for large shareholders and also when the company spins off assets to its shareholders.Bottom Line on MSFTMicrosoft has $11.6 billion left in its present share repurchase program. I expect that MSFT will complete the program by the end of this calendar year.Expect Microsoft to announce another higher share repurchase program before then. I suspect it will be larger than the previous $40 billion buyback program which started in December 2016.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Microsoft will most likely lose that battle (as it's been fighting all day to hold the 50DMA due to news from CAT and NVDA... seriously?). Microsoft will provide its usual solid earnings beat but will state that even though cloud growth is still good, it is not compounding on itself like it use to. Anticipate a small 3-5% pop, pushing it back over the 50DMA. Amazon will miss the following day on either guidance or modest earnings beat and Microsoft will be tested yet again at the 50DMA. Powell will get on the mic come Friday use big language and equivocate in his usual manner of ""let's wait and see"" rather than have a confirmed plan of intent and keep the markets guessing for another six weeks.

Windows Central reports that Microsoft will unveil a disc-less “Xbox One S All-Digital Edition,” with preorders expected to be available in mid-April. This new console is said to be available in stores in May, ahead of Microsoft’s typical E3 show in June.Codenamed “Xbox Maverick,” details on the disc-less console appeared in November. Microsoft is also rumored to be creating an option to ship this disc-less console with games pre-installed, so new Xbox owners can choose the games they want installed before the console ships.No more Blu-ray driveIf the report is accurate, Microsoft’s disc-less Xbox One S will be designed for digital copies of games. It will likely mean this new console is cheaper than the existing Xbox One S, as the costly Blu-ray drive is being removed.

5078,"MSFT will be hired by the US government:Microsoft Describes How Government Hackers Stole ‘Large Sums’ From Financial FirmsBy David Scheer and Dina Bass February 28, 2019 It’s a short -- but startling -- passage tucked inside Microsoft Corp.’s periodic cybersecurity report: State-sponsored hackers attacked several financial services firms and stole “large sums of cash.”The account provides another reminder that hackers are successfully preying on parts of an industry where customer confidence is paramount, and that’s sometimes reluctant to disclose serious attacks. Yet even as the report lays out what happened, it omits sensitive details, such as which government backed the assault or which firms were targeted.Microsoft said it knows about the case because its experts helped victims in the aftermath. In a series of similar incidents, hackers gained administrative access to computer systems by infecting a machine with a “highly targeted, obfuscated backdoor implant,” possibly with a spear-phishing email. Then they sent cash to foreign accounts. In some instances, the hackers went undetected for more than 100 days, and once found, unleashed malware on the victims’ systems, halting operations.FireEye Inc., another cybersecurity firm, described a similar series of attacks in a report published about five months ago. A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment on whether the incidents are related.In that report, FireEye said a North Korean hacking group had infiltrated more than 16 firms in 11 countries including the U.S., stealing more than $100 million. The group’s victims included a Chilean bank that lost $10 million last May. North Korean diplomats and official media have denied that the country plays any role in cyber attacks.

5089,"What Microsoft really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit fo Microsoft (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Microsoft just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

5244,"I would like to offer predictions today.Big tech’s dominance is finally over. Their decline began in 2020 and in a few short years they’re going to be in a free fall as the public confidence in them rapidly erodes. A major realignment will take place and MICROSOFT is going to emerge as the dominant leader because of a spectacular growth in its revenue and profitability. Coupled with the fact that CEO Nadella is a level headed person focused on Microsoft’s growth and not activism, investors will see the value in its stock. I believe even more investment will flow into the $MSFT stock starting this year.My prediction for other stocks:1 Investors will start realizing that $AMZN’s valuation is significantly higher than its peers. I believe the stock won’t surpass the ATH it saw in 2020. It is quite likely that the stock price may decline during 2021.2 $AAPL stock will likely grow higher during 2021, but its high flying days are over. Apple car is just a concept and it will be several years before a physical product is launched. In the meantime, Tesla Cybertruck and a possible low priced car may already be in the roads, thereby making Tesla the undisputed leader. It will be very difficult to penetrate its market. I see no innovation from Apple and investors will see that too.3 Stocks like $GOOG, $FB, $TWTR will likely stagnate and commence MASSIVE declines. I expect that regulations by governments around the world will act as catalysts to their decline.4 Other tech stocks like $WDAY, $NOW, $CRM will likely have more realistic P/E.",0.9655

I didn't stick with it, else my investments would be over $2-3 million dollars. Now, I am having the same feeling about MSFT (Microsoft). And I hope I am going to stick with it and buy on dips. Why?1. From being a Windows and Office play, they are becoming a cloud and technology as an enabler play. 2. Almost everything is moving to tech. Even a restaurant booking and ordering systems will be online. Everything someone how flows something to MSFT revenue. 3. MSFT has been really bad with hardware, phone, laptops. Surface is okay, but not an iPad killer. I feel they will do something in this space. Either they will get into partnership with Mobile operators and get into the tech side, and if they do something interesting in hardware space, and do it right, it alone could be worth APPL - 10 years wish list. 4. Getting rid of all retail stores and moving online has huge savings on rental plus the physical inventory. This will have few bps positive impact to bottom line. 5. MSFT is going into various verticals - like healthcare. Kind of speaks to my point number 1, but this is more than that. If they start coming up with technologies that help you analyze virus, DNA, they become a healthcare company. They are also doing stuff in fintech space. Not many know, but they were looking at acquiring YES Bank in India (didn't go thru), but shows intent. These are just my thoughts. Maybe I am biased to my own thoughts.

So, for example someone making $15 per hour and working 40 hours per week will get about $46 more per week or slightly over $180 per month. From September through December that will come out to about $830. Consumer spending accounts for 70% of U.S. economic growth. In a consumer based economy, more money is earned and less money is paid in taxes, people likely will spend more on goods and services as a result businesses generate more on revenue, they reinvest more and hire more employees, unemployment goes down, economy revitalize and grow again.
